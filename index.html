                              <span>One year on, how have things improved?
It&#x27;s been a year since Nintendo launched its higher-tier Expansion Pack service for Nintendo Switch Online, which brought a select library of Sega Mega Drive / Genesis games and Nintendo 64 titles to Switch alongside access to otherwise-paid DLC such as Animal Crossing: New Horizons - Happy Home Paradise.
Priced at $49.99USD / £34.99 for an individual yearly subscription — an extra $30 / £17 on top of the standard annual Nintendo Switch Online subscription offering — the sentiment among Switch owners at launch wasn&#x27;t particularly warm, with criticism directed at a small initial library of N64 titles, various distracting (and, in some cases, game-hampering) emulation issues, and a general feeling that this new tier didn&#x27;t offer enough value-for-money to justify the higher asking price.

Update : It&#x27;s almost here! Dead Cells&#x27; Boss Rush mode should be up and live on Switch tomorrow, October 26th. The developer has been working hard on getting yet another free update ship-shape for console owners, and we don&#x27;t have to wait much longer at all.
Some of the new features coming alongside the Boss Rush mode are a new customisable statue, a new ranged weapon, a new skill, a new mutation, and eight more outfits.

While we&#x27;re still waiting for an official release date for River City Girls 2 in the West, WayForward has dropped a brand new trailer featuring Marian, one of the game&#x27;s new playable characters. And she looks quite a bit different from how many might remember her.
Marian is, of course, the main heroine of the Double Dragon series — which was also made by the original creators of the Kunio-kun (River City) series, Technōs Japan. Marian is often the damsel-in-distress in Double Dragon, but that&#x27;s not the case in River City Girls 2. And she comes packed with abs of steel and fists we don&#x27;t want to mess with.

We&#x27;re in the final stretch before Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet launches on Switch next month. Later today, we&#x27;ll be finding out about a brand new Ghost-type Pokémon, but before we get to that, The Pokémon Company and Nintendo of America have dropped a new commercial for the game.
&#x27;Your World Your Way&#x27; is all about capturing the open world of the Paldea region. Generation IX is the first open-world mainline Pokémon gen, taking a leaf out of Pokémon Legends: Arceus&#x27; book.

It wouldn&#x27;t be a normal week as a Nintendo fan these days without the announcement of yet more Pokémon Scarlet and Violet news now would it? Ever to stay on brand, The Pokémon Company has announced that more details are to be shown today.
After sharing the spooky short found above — showing one trainer getting all kinds of scared by the haunting presence of a Gengar — The Pokémon Company has set up a mysterious livestream for today (25th October) at 14:00 BST / 15:00 CEST / 9:00 EST, simply titled &#x27;????&#x27;.

The filing is in response to a message described as anti-union that was sent by Activision Blizzard’s communications executive, Lulu Meservey, to 18,000 employees last week. The CWA had previously filed a charge of unfair labour practices in September 2021, accusing the company of violating US labour laws and stopping employees from discussing working conditions. Last year’s complaint was closed just a month later.

                              <span>What are you doing for the next ten minutes? Nothing much? Alright, here&#x27;s what you&#x27;re doing: playing Greaser, a wee free visual novel about riding a Cronenbergian biomechanical motorbike along an endless unreal desert highway. It&#x27;s playable in your browser so kick-start on over to Itch.io right now. I don&#x27;t know what else you&#x27;re doing this morning that&#x27;ll get your engine running more than adventure, self-discovery, and erotic motorbike maintenance.

                              <span>EA held their first Behind The Sims Summit last week, revealing plenty of Sims updates, including a very early look at the next game in the series, Project Rene. Despite this big news, discussion around the event has focused on EA’s lack of community representation, as they only included one “black simmer” onscreen during a stream full of other content creators. Black content creators have been a significant part of The Sims&#x27; online presence for years, creating custom content, mods and more.

                              <span>One of Overwatch&#x27;s most popular annual events was Halloween Terror, which brought not only Halloween-inspired skins and rewards to the game&#x27;s loot box system but a unique PvE experience. 
Halloween Terror has returned, this time to Overwatch 2 and much like the years of experiences before it, this year&#x27;s event comes with skins, rewards, and a semi-sequel to the first game&#x27;s Halloween PvE experience, Junkenstein&#x27;s Revenge. The new PvE mode for Overwatch 2 is now called Junkenstein&#x27;s Revenge: Wrath of the Bride and you can jump in starting today, October 25.

&quot;Return to Adlersbrunn alongside four fresh faces to experience an all-new story as the Bride of Junkenstein seeks vengeance upon those responsible for the death of her creator,&quot; a blog post about the limited-time co-op mission reads. &quot;Complete challenges to unlock special rewards like the Nightfall Over Adlersbrunn Name Card, the Jack-o&#x27;-Lantern Weapon Charm, Battle Pass XP, and other spine-tingling rewards. Dr. Junkenstein will also be making a grand reappearance in the original Junkenstein&#x27;s Revenge co-op Brawl, returning for a limited time to Halloween Terror 2022.&quot; 
Halloween Terror will run until 11 a.m. PT/2 p.m. ET, November 1. If you watch two hours of streams on the Overwatch 2 category on Twitch, you&#x27;ll receive the Werewolf Winston Spray and if you watch four, you&#x27;ll receive the Werewolf Winston Legendary Skin (pictured above). 
Alongside this event, Blizzard is also running a Double Match XP weekend for Overwatch 2 starting October 28 and lasting until October 31. All players who login to Overwatch 2 sometime during the Halloween Terror event through the end of Season One will receive the Cursed Captain Reaper Legendary Skin and Health Pack Weapon Charm as well.

                              <span>Wherever there are online video games, there will be people trying to cheat. It’s human nature, and as much as it annoys the rest of us, we’ll never be rid of it. So we should all expect, at some level, video game companies to put in the work needed to protect us  from aimbots and wallhacks and autoclickers.

                              <span>A battle for every area
Bandai Namco Entertainment has put out a new gameplay showcase for One Piece Odyssey, where we get a good glimpse of how the Straw Hat Pirates fight their turn-based RPG battles.
Before the fighting starts, we do get a look at the locale for the new adventure. One Piece Odyssey follows Monkey D. Luffy and the crew in a journey after they&#x27;re shipwrecked at sea.
In the trailer today, we see the city of Alabasta and some of the locales the pirates will run through. Each character has an overworld ability, allowing them to access certain areas or take advantage of certain resources. From being stretchy or handy with a slingshot to just being small, everyone has their own talent for navigating the island.

All&#x27;s fair in turn-based battles
Once the fighting starts, the crew dukes it out in a traditional RPG style. It&#x27;s got a traditional vibe to it, with a little bit of One Piece style.
It looks like one of Odyssey&#x27;s battle mechanics is the scramble area battle, where characters are placed in different zones to duke it out. Some characters are able to attack other areas from long-range, and it looks like fighters can also move from one area to another one their own is clear.

Basically, an all-out brawl. But with type effectiveness and other factors in play, it seems like an interesting battle system that could make for fun combat encounters. I dig the idea of the crew getting split and having to fight their way back together. Plus, there are some conditions called Dramatic Scenes that give extra rewards for clearing them.
I&#x27;m not a huge One Piece fan, but this look at the battle set-up has me intrigued. We&#x27;ll see how Luffy and the crew&#x27;s battles turn out in this new RPG when One Piece Odyssey launches for PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on January 13, 2023.

Overwatch 2 is ringing in the season of scares with a return to Halloween Terror, its annual Halloween event. The festivities kick off tomorrow, October 25, and run through November 9.
A new limited time co-op mission is in store for this year, dubbed Junkenstein&#x27;s Revenge: Wrath of the Bride. The bride, as you can tell from the images, is a special Sombra skin.
With every new event comes a bevy of cosmetics, to both unlock and purchase in Overwatch 2. Special challenges will unlock rewards like a name card, weapon charm, and some Battle Pass XP if you&#x27;re still working on it.

It originally debuted at $1000, undercutting the RTX 3090 Ti at $1500, but third-party models could cost much more - such as this $1200 PowerColor Red Devil. Today though, with that whole &#x27;impending release of better graphics cards&#x27; thing, the 6950 XT is down to $800 at Amazon, which is an awesome deal for the level of graphics performance on offer.

                              <span>Folks, I’ve got some bad news. Victoria 3 is not a game where you play the clone of the clone of Posh Spice. I was all geared up for some science fiction-tinged Spice Girls shenanigans, but I was left bitterly disappointed. However, I’d already installed it, so I decided to check it out and see what kind of game it actually is. Turns out that Victoria 3 is a grand strategy game, just like its Paradox stablemates Crusader Kings and Hearts of Iron.
Trying to classify Victoria 3 is pretty damn important. Unlike, say, the Total War series, Paradox’s grand strategy titles are differentiated by a lot more than their time periods. Hearts of Iron its WW2 military ticker on its sleeve, while Crusader Kings (my personal fave) is secretly an RPG, just one that happens to cast you as the ruler of a country, rather than a random wandering murderer. Figure that out and you grasped the appeal of the game, especially for people who may lack interest in - or be downright put off by - the historical era it covers.

                              <span>The Corsair 5000D is a rather good PC case, but as it&#x27;s fairly new it&#x27;s normally quite expensive - like $165 on Amazon expensive. So it brings me good cheer to announce that Woot are doing the case in white or black for just $99.99, the lowest price we&#x27;ve ever recorded for this model.

                              <span>The Angel of Darkness gets blamed for a lot of the Tomb Raider franchise&#x27;s failures in the early-to-mid 2000s — whether it&#x27;s the downfall of Core Design, the box office flop of the second Angelina Jolie movie, or the continuity reboot the series needed before anyone would agree to publish another one of its games. While I have to admit there&#x27;s some pretty damning circumstantial evidence there and that not every accusation is exactly unfounded, the game&#x27;s memetic unpopularity even among people who never played it still feels harsher than is warranted.

                              <span>Horror games are great and all that, but what about games that make you the monster? Yeah. Chew on that for a second.

I&#x27;m not just talking about games that belong to the horror genre, either. In fact, spare those asymmetrical multiplayer games that are all the rage with their worryingly young audiences, there are few actual horror games that let you assume the role of the villain. But that doesn&#x27;t mean there isn&#x27;t a deluge of titles where you play as a creature so vile, so menacing, that the residents of their worlds undoubtly view the player as evil incarnate. Far from it. The games on this list may not all be spooky in tone, but your character is still the stuff of actual nightmares.

                              <span>Alright folks, bear with me, because it doesn&#x27;t look like this one is going to get less messy. As reported by Tech News Space, it appears that Robert Kurvitz, the lead developer and writer on Disco Elysium, is suing Studio ZA/UM, the development studio of Disco Elysium, via his own company Telomer. Kotaku AU seem to have corroborated this, finding a record on the Estonian Ministry of Justice&#x27;s website showing Telomer has filed an application against ZA/UM Studio to &quot;obtain information and review documents&quot;, which you can see for yourself here.
This comes after Martin Luiga announced (in a frankly kinda weird post) the dissolution of The ZA/UM Cultural Association, and that Kurvitz, writer Helen Hindpere, and art director Aleksander Rostov were no longer working at Studio ZA/UM.

                              <span>House Castle has been on a bit of a horror binge this month, what with it being Spooky Season and all. Not because we&#x27;re die-hard horror buffs - if anything, we&#x27;re both lifelong wimps when it comes to this stuff. But buoyed by a growing resolve to tackle our collective cowardice head on, October has seen us watch, play and read several of the big horror classics we&#x27;ve been too chicken to attempt in the past. Over the course of it all, though, there&#x27;s been a gnawing, slightly dreadful realisation slowly bubbling away beneath the surface. Far from being scared by these horrible things, I&#x27;ve often come away feeling no emotions whatsoever. I have remained unmoved, neither frightened, unnerved, or creeped out. Just plain, simple indifference. The Japanese Ring? Nothing. I Saw The Devil? Nah, mate. Lake Mungo? More like Lake Yawngo.
I was beginning to think I&#x27;d lost the capacity to feel anything at all. Heck, the real horror show this month has been the collapse of the entire UK nation state, and yet I still cannot bring myself to muster anything beyond a tired sigh. Then I got to the second act of Resident Evil Village&#x27;s Shadows Of Rose DLC and, oh yes, hello fear. It&#x27;s been a while, hasn&#x27;t it?

Disco Elysium is widely regarded as one of the best narrative games of all time, and fans have been anxiously awaiting any news of a follow-up from its developer, Studio ZA/UM. Recently, however, there have been some internal issues with the studio, with the studio fracturing and many of the key Disco Elysium devs &quot;involuntarily&quot; splitting from the company entirely, namely writer and designer Robert Kurvitz, co-writer Helen Hindpere, and lead artist Aleksander Rostov.  It appears that the inter-studio drama will continue for a while, because now Kurvitz has filed a lawsuit against what remains of ZA/UM.

The 1993 film Jurassic Park is fun for the whole family! It has dismemberment. It has people getting a face full of raptor. There’s Jeff Goldblum! There are kids in it, allowing the little buggers to have some escapism in a horrific world of science gone wrong.
It’s definitely not the most audience-confused license out there. Robocop had plenty of dick-shooting and melty-men, and everyone on the schoolyard talked about it. At least Robocop had a plot that lent itself well to video games. Jurassic Park was too suspenseful to be a side-scroller, but that didn’t mean companies weren’t going to try.
Most of them were bad. The ones that people say were pretty good? Those were bad, too. The SNES version? It’s not great. But someone on the development team obviously had a lot of fun wi…</span>

                              <span>PC port joins console editions
Good news for PC shmuppers today, as City Connection has announced that Cave shmup Akai Katana Shin will be arriving on Steam on December 15, in alignment with its previously announced re-release on PS4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch.
As we have previously reported, Akai Katana Shin originally launched on Xbox 360 in 2011, itself a remaster of Cave&#x27;s great 2010 arcade release. In typical Cave fashion the dazzling shmup features adrenaline-pumping, bullet-hell action, a beat-heavy soundtrack, and a melodramatic storyline that features a put-upon people, sick of being sacrificed to the titular totem, rising up against their oppressors in a bid for freedom.
Check out a preview of the re-release from April’s FES 2022 stream. The action starts at 33:30.
https://youtu.be/yNZTTM3sZG4
The new release will feature high-resolution visuals, a widescreen presentation format, and three individual modes to please both Akai Katana veterans and newcomers. Akai Katana Origin will replicate the 2010 arcade in all of its 4:3 glory, Akai Katana Slash will feature revised enemy patterns, new mechanics, and the aforementioned 16:9 screen ratio, while Akai Katana Climax will feature a blend of the previous modes, readjusted for balance. City Connection has noted that Akai Katana Shin will support multiple languages, including English, French, and Spanish.
Akai Katana Shin launches December 15 on PS4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch. A physical release will follow in 2023 on PS4 and Nintendo Switch only.

I wasn’t expecting a third Yomawari game. The first two games were two years apart, so I expected that they’d either remain at that pace or the series would simply end. Five years later, we have Yomawari: Lost in the Dark, and there hasn’t been a step missed. You almost wouldn’t believe this is five years removed from Yomawari: Midnight Shadows because the art and graphics are almost identical, and it features the same incremental tweaks that you’d expect.
And that’s for better or worse.
Yomawari might be my favorite horror game series around, and it’s not because the gameplay is exciting. Holy crap, it definitely isn’t. However, as far as horror games go, Yomawari knows how to do storytelling in a way that takes advantage of the interactive medium and inco…</span>

                              <span>Steam Deck lending a hand(held)
PC gaming platform Steam has smashed its current all-time record for Most Current Players, with a staggering 30 million players plus jumping online over the course of this past weekend.
The numbers peaked on Sunday, October 23, with an amazing 30,032,005 players online.
While no one game, in particular, can be tipped as responsible for this player platoon, mass multiplayer titles — such as Electronic Arts&#x27; Apex Legends, PUBG Corporation&#x27;s PUBG: Battlegrounds, and Valve&#x27;s own long-running Steam icons DOTA 2 and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) — remain the most popular and most played titles on the PC-based platform. In regards to sales, the most popular Steam purchases in recent weeks have been Activision&#x27;s Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, Sega&#x27;s Football Manager 2023, and Paradox Interactive&#x27;s strategy sequel Victoria 3.
Gaming, or simply just hanging out, on Steam has seen consistent forward momentum since Valve launched the platform way back in the fall of 2003. This growth has accelerated since the COVID-19 pandemic and its aligned global lockdown legislation. More recently, the launch of the powerful handheld console, Steam Deck, has also seen more players remaining logged in and online for longer periods of time — whether gaming, chatting, or just idly ramping up their own electricity bill.

Bethesda is working on a next-gen update for Fallout 4, bringing the open-world post-apocalyptic RPG to newer console hardware.
Announced today as part of the Fallout 25th series anniversary celebration, Fallout 4 will get a next-gen upgrade. This will be for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Windows PC too.
The upgrade for newer generation hardware will include a performance mode for high frame rate options, extra quality features for 4K resolution, some bug fixes, and Creation Club content.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;X5aJfebzkrM
No exact date or more specifics on the Fallout 4 next-gen update were given. But Bethesda notes that it will be a free update, so no need to buy a second copy.
With the update currently set for 2023, we&#x27;ll likely hear more about it as we get closer and into the new year.
Irradiated future
Fallout 4 was first released in November 2015, as Bethesda&#x27;s newest entry since Fallout 3. It took an interesting approach to its story, which involved an early segment set before the bombs dropped.
Ultimately, Fallout 4 proved to be divisive. And as is the case with many other Bethesda open-world RPGs like Skyrim, the mod community set about doing a great deal of work building on what they&#x27;d been given.
The results have been pretty impressive, though. With that comparison point in mind, it will be interesting to see what kind of step-up this will be, especially on the PC side.
But considering we&#x27;ve seen a veritable legion of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim releases over the years, it&#x27;s nice to see Fallout getting some love too. Once the next-gen update for Fallout 4 rolls around, I might just check it out, and maybe see what that Far Harbor DLC is like for myself.

The creation of Super Smash Bros is a multifaceted miracle, and Masahiro Sakurai is here to give us a breakdown thanks to his YouTube channel game design series.
Sakurai recalls how he started work on the Nintendo 64 era following his efforts on Kirby Super Star, and moved on to &quot;independent study&quot; for 3D visuals. As usual, Sakurai provides a very digestible look at this endeavor, including a brief overview of some of the more technical hurdles required in the generational leap.
At first, Sakurai proposed two games for the N64: a &quot;free for all four player fighting game&quot; (you guessed it), and an &quot;RC robot adventure game where you hack security cameras.&quot; The catch?

                              <span>Let&#x27;s get this dude in a cardboard box
Top-tier thesp Oscar Isaac has reiterated his desire to get a Metal Gear Solid movie off of the drawing board and onto the silver screen — Speaking in an interview with ComicBook.com, the Star Wars, Ex Machina, and Annihilation star spoke of his continued ambition to make this ongoing project a reality.
&quot;We want it to happen,&quot; said Isaac in an abridged quote. &quot;Be excited. What&#x27;s the script? What&#x27;s the story? What&#x27;s the take? [...] Hopeful that comes to fruition because there&#x27;s so much potential for that. It&#x27;s an incredible game. It&#x27;s my favorite.&quot;
There have been murmurs of a big-screen adaptation of Hideo Kojima&#x27;s masterpiece PlayStation title ever since its initial 1998 release. Right now, the possibility of a Solid Snake movie seems more likely than ever, with Isaac on board to star and Jordan Vogt-Roberts (The Kings of Summer, Kong: Skull Island) penciled in to direct. With only a few names on deck, and no production schedule or release window even hinted at, we likely have some years to go before we hear the famous codec jingle rattling in our local IMAX theater.
In the meantime, you can check out Mr. Isaac&#x27;s turn as Marvel&#x27;s brooding avenger, Moon Knight, on the Disney+ network. In addition, his new, neo-noir graphic novel, Head Wounds: Sparrow, is available to order now from Legendary Comics.

I&#x27;ve been waiting for Victoria 3 for about as long as I&#x27;ve been interested in grand strategies. I&#x27;m a certified economics and international relations nerd. I also loathe most politicians as they have all sold us out for their own profit, but I still find politics fascinating. I&#x27;m essentially the person that the Victoria series is made for but try as I might, I was never able to get any more than skin deep into Victoria 2. So I waited patiently, for my turn in the pool.
I even got deep into Hearts of Iron IV for a bit, but it still wasn&#x27;t my precise cup of tea. Finally, last year, Victoria 3 was announced and even though it didn&#x27;t have a release window it was like the clouds had parted and I knew my time was coming.

                              <span>There&#x27;s a lot going on in Sumeru
It feels like the new Sumeru region just arrived in Genshin Impact via the 3.0 update, but 3.2 is nearly upon us. This Genshin Impact 3.2 overview trailer does a decent job of reminding folks of the vibe of Sumeru, as well as some of the new happenings with the upcoming patch.
Here&#x27;s a Genshin Impact 3.2 overview:
Nahida and Yoimiya will be the first characters to arrive with the patch (Nahida is kind of a big deal, as she&#x27;s the Dendro Archon of the region)
Yae Miko, Layla, and Tartaglia (Childe) come next
New events are coming, as well as the marquee &quot;Fabulous Fungus Frenzy&quot; competition
Adventurer&#x27;s Trials (with oddball goals) are coming
The Dendro Hypostasis will allow players to fight Hypostasis of every element
A &quot;Replication System&quot; mechanic will be implemented in the Serenitea world, where you can copy and paste over designs
It&#x27;s too early to call Sumeru my favorite region: but the team has done a great job of making the story feel cohesive, and creating a crescendo of stakes. As more updates come out, it&#x27;ll probably help its case. It&#x27;s definitely one of the more varied zones in the game, and the events have been practically nonstop for it since 3.0.
Genshin Impact 3.2 hits on November 2.

After we had both closed the curtain on Resident Evil Village, myself and our own Jordan Devore said the same thing: this game could have some rockin&#x27; DLC. While the core story mode of the newly minted Winters&#x27; Expansion is short, the rest augments the game in a way that will ultimately help its legacy, and future playthroughs.

Resident Evil Village: Winters&#x27; Expansion (PC, PS4, PS5 [reviewed], Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S)
Developer: Capcom
Publisher: Capcom
Released: October 28, 2022
MSRP: $19.99
While this review will mainly be focused on &quot;Shadows of Rose,&quot; the additional storyline featuring Ethan&#x27;s daughter, there are two more features of the Winters&#x27; Expansion: third person mode for the core story, and some extra mercenaries content.

Those naughty MultiVersus dataminers are at it again, delving into the code of Player First Games&#x27; madcap platform fighter and pulling out clues pertaining to upcoming characters and stages — In fact, just this weekend, one such digger ventured into the new update and surfaced with a reference to the iconic 1985 classic, The Goonies.
Directed by Richard Donner and written by Steven Spielberg, The Goonies tells the tale of a group of misfit children, who embark upon a wild adventure of danger and intrigue while exploring the legend of notorious pirate One-Eyed Willie. The Goonies has transcended generations due to its dopey slapstick comedy, Indiana Jones-esque action, and litany of quotable lines and memorable characters. Today, decades after its release, it remains something of a rite of passage for young film fans.
https://twitter.com/multiversusie/status/1584180607177101317?s&#x3D;20&amp;t&#x3D;CI339P3hx-XJ070QVSuVqg
The data pulled from the new MultiVersus update includes a &quot;Character Universe&quot; code — essentially a folder in which data is stored by IP, (for example &quot;DC Comics&quot; or &quot;Gremlins&quot;), this would suggest the possibility of one or more Goonies characters might be in the works for the star-studded fighter, though we are probably more likely to get Sloth than we are Mama Fratelli. Of course, this code could also be a &quot;just in case&quot; placeholder, with no confirmed plan to bring in The Goonies anytime soon. We shall see.
The Goonies is the latest in a number of unannounced IPs and characters to be found lurking within the MultiVersus code. Previous datamines have uncovered dialogue and/or references pertaining to DC Comics supervillain Joker, The Ghost with the Most, Beetlejuice, and The Wizard of Oz&#x27;s very own Wicked Witch of the West. To date, none of these characters have been officially confirmed by Player First Games.
MultiVersus is available now in open beta on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

The Bayonetta 3 pay dispute controversy has taken yet another turn, as aggrieved actor Hellena Taylor has confirmed that they were initially offered more than they originally claimed to reprise their role as the gun-toting, angel-slaying witch in her upcoming Nintendo Switch adventure.
Although Taylor originally claimed that she turned down the role after receiving an &#x27;insulting&#x27; offer of just $4,000 USD to portray the sultry superhero, the voice actor has now confirmed that they were initially offered $10,000, with an additional $5,000 added after negotiation with producer Hideki Kamiya. This is a package in keeping with SAG/AFTRA guidelines, but Taylor suggests is unfair given the inevitable financial success of the long-anticipated sequel.

                              <span>What&#x27;s in a name?
Square Enix has filed a trademark for a mysterious new project, which has led some fans to nervously anticipate the return of a classic IP — The Japanese publisher laid claim to the term &quot;Symbiogenesis&quot; earlier this month on October 13, ultimately being granted licensing rights last week.
The term Symbiogenesis is an evolutionary theory that concerns the act of two early-evolving organisms coming together to form a singular entity, that then continues to evolve while taking on the attributes of its two base organisms. Importantly, however, it also forms the basis of the plotline for the cult RPG series Parasite Eve, which has been missing in action for quite some time, much to the chagrin of its devoted fan community.
Launching on PlayStation in 1998, Parasite Eve is a video game sequel to Hideaki Sena&#x27;s 1995 novel, and concerns the investigations of a New York police officer, Aya Brea, who is investigating the arrival of a mysterious, otherworldly woman — linked to a series of horrific fires across the city. In the game, symbiogenesis is the antagonist&#x27;s tool of choice, having discovered to way to cause a collision in human cells that results in spontaneous combustion. Though followed by a sequel in 1999 and a shooter spin-off (The 3rd Birthday) in 2010, Parasite Eve fans have been eagerly awaiting the series&#x27; return.
Now, for full clarity, there is no official word that this trademark is a new title in the acclaimed series, but the attendance of Square Enix, as well as the use of a very specific term, will go some way to encourage fans to start eagerly fidgeting in their seats. Hopefully, the legendary developer will see fit to confirm the details, one way or the other, very soon.

Just recently, actor Brendan Fraser offered up his thoughts on why 2017’s The Mummy failed to garner both critical and commercial success. The movie, starring Tom Cruise and Sofia Boutella, was meant to serve as the jumping off point for Universal Pictures’ ‘Dark Universe’, which would effectively link together multiple projects based on the classic ‘Universal Monster’ movies. After The Mummy gained overwhelming negative reception from critics and consumers alike — sitting at an appalling 15% critic score and 35% audience score respectively on Rotten Tomatoes — Universal Pictures abandoned its ambitions for an interconnected cinematic universe.
When prompted for his thoughts on the movie, Fraser stated the following (courtesy of Variety):

                              <span>Size definitely matters in this one.
In the world of Monster Rancher, bigger doesn’t always mean better, but it certainly doesn’t hurt. The newest entry in the series, Ultra Kaiju Monster Rancher, takes this philosophy and turns it up to epic proportions, creating a world filled with monsters the size of mountains that need to be fed, trained, and loved to reach their full potential. This is Monster Rancher gameplay but on a much grander scale.
This new title is the result of a team-up between two much-loved franchises; Ultraman, the long-running Japanese superhero show, and Monster Rancher. However if like many people in the English-speaking world you’re not as familiar with the former as you are with the latter, don’t be worried. While several Ultraman forms show up in this game, it is much more of a Monster Rancher title than a tokusatsu game. Many of the iconic monsters from Ultraman are available for you to raise and fight, but no specific knowledge of the series is necessary.

                              <span>Eight paths, eight characters.
Octopath Traveler II is set to come to the Switch on 24th February 2023, and in the run-up to this brand new journey, Square Enix has been sharing some information on the eight different heroes whose paths you can, erm, travel.
We got a taste of what each of these characters will bring to the game in the Octopath Traveler II announcement trailer which released as a part of this year&#x27;s Nintendo Direct Showcase. While the trailer did a good job at revealing the eight characters&#x27; names and the kind of jobs they hold, it provided little more information about what we can expect to find on their paths or how their abilities will play out in battle.

Video games are embracing the spook, but one indie darling that doesn&#x27;t need to go out of its way to do that just for Halloween is Massive Monster&#x27;s Cult of the Lamb. But it&#x27;s doing it anyway!
Today, 24th October, the Blood Moon Festival kicks off. This is a brand new, limited-time event where you get a brand new ritual, new base decorations, and new follower forms. Now look, we&#x27;ve played enough Zelda: Breath of the Wild to know that a Blood Moon isn&#x27;t good news, but this sounds like the tables have turned here. Perhaps we need to become cult leaders in Hyrule...

If you&#x27;re looking for a game to play this Halloween, you can&#x27;t go wrong with Infernax. This NES-inspired action platformer is full of gruesome bosses and sprite work that will make your stomach churn and can be hard-as-nails at times. But tomorrow, developer Berzerk Studio is giving us more of a reason to revisit this gem with a brand new character — The Stranger.
The Stranger is a mesh of all sorts of things. Hockey mask on his face, knife in hand, he&#x27;s absolutely the embodiment of every slasher movie character ever. And we&#x27;ll be able to play as him from tomorrow, 25th October.

Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope launched last Friday to significant positive reception, garnering a solid score of 8/10 in our own review.
A day one patch was made available for the title, as is seemingly the norm these days, but its contents are so exhaustive, it&#x27;s probably worth while checking it out for all the lowdown. Ubisoft itself states that the update is not mandatory, but highly recommended.

If there&#x27;s a Nintendo console that&#x27;s absolutely loaded with stellar RPGs, it&#x27;s the Super Nintendo. This little system is filled to the brim with classics from Squaresoft), Enix (prior to merging with Square), Nintendo, Capcom, and tons more. Terranigma, from developer Quintet, is one of the standouts, despite not releasing in North America, but that hasn&#x27;t stopped fans — and its creators — from continually celebrating this masterpiece.
Yesterday, manga artist Kamui Fujiwara shared what he calls &#x27;Terranigma Special Movie&#x27; on YouTube (thanks, ResetEra!). Fujiwara, who designed many of the SNES game&#x27;s characters, and other artists who worked on the original game, got together to gather a bunch of artwork and compile it into a lovely 22-minute tribute video for the game&#x27;s 27th anniversary.

Square Enix is capping off its return to the strategy RPG genre this year with a remaster of one of the best — Tactics Ogre: Reborn. And many outlets and YouTubers got some hands-on time with the game prior to its launch on 11th November. And it&#x27;s looking good — particularly on the Switch (thanks Gematsu!).
While the game is going multiplatform for this remaster — which is an enhanced port of the 2010 PSP remake of the Super Famicom game — the chance to replicate that PSP feeling by playing handheld? That&#x27;s what we&#x27;re all after, isn&#x27;t it? Early impressions seem very positive from the get-go across all platforms, and it&#x27;ll be interesting to see how it fares today after being one of the genre&#x27;s biggest titles for years.

Splatoon 3 features some reasonably extensive customisation options for its characters, allowing players to choose any combination of hairstyle and clothing items they desire, regardless of gender identity.
It turns out, however, that Nintendo once considered implementing facial features to the game beyond eye and eyebrow customisation, such as freckles and scars. This comes via Automaton, which reports that files discovered in Ver. 1.0 of the game contains clear evidence of textures used to create freckles and scars. Twitter user @thebigsadkad has uploaded the files on Twitter as evidence of the inclusion:

                              <span>PlatinumGames embodies style, imagination, and risk-taking. Spawned in 2007 by Capcom veterans, including Resident Evil creator Shinji Mikami and Devil May Cry and Okami mastermind Hideki Kamiya, the studio became a haven for these minds to create new franchises under the freedom of independence. Early success like MadWorld turned heads, but Platinum’s third title, Bayonetta, cemented it as one of the game industry’s premier action studios.
Launching in Japan in 2009 and hitting U.S. shores in 2010, Bayonetta revamped and, in some ways, improved the stylish action of its spiritual predecessor, Devil May Cry. The bewitching adventure reinvented and reinvigorated the stylish action genre; Platinum created its magnum opus in only two years. Unfortunately, sales didn’t match the reception, and Sega, the game’s original publisher, passed on a sequel. Despite fans’ cries, Bayonetta seemingly ended the series before it could take off.
Nintendo stepped up to answer those pleas by agreeing to publish a follow-up. Bayonetta 2 arrived in 2014 as a Wii U exclusive. The sequel proved Bayonetta wasn’t a one-hit wonder, becoming one of the year’s best games with some fans believing it surpassed its predecessor. The success also proved the family-friendly Nintendo had no problem letting the franchise remain true to its Mature-rated self.

                              <span>Update, 10/24/22:
Former Bayonetta 3 voice actor Hellena Taylor has released a new thread of tweets clarifying some of what she said in regards to Platinum Games&#x27; &quot;immoral&quot; compensation offer to return to voice the titular character in the threequel. These tweets follow a report from Bloomberg that refuted Taylor&#x27;s original claims and added clarification from sources as to how Jennifer Hale, the new Bayonetta voice actor, came about getting the role. They also follow a statement released by Platinum Games that essentially asks the community to support Hale and her statement. 
In Taylor&#x27;s thread, released October 24, the voice actor says that she feels &quot;the need to defend myself and my reputation in the industry&quot; since &quot;some people are calling me a liar and a golddigger.&quot;

                              <span>The Cooler Master NR200P is one of the best small form factor PC cases on the market, but it normally costs around £100 - a fair amount of money. Today though, you can pick up the case for nearly half off, as CCL are selling this model for just £54.
For context, the last time we wrote about a big discount to this model, it was down to £76 - so this is the best deal we&#x27;ve ever seen on the NR200P by some margin!

                              <span>A new Linux driver introduced by Intel earlier this year was the In-Field Scan for making use of new silicon failure testing functionality with upcoming Intel server CPUs. The IFS driver and associated hardware capability is for detecting potential problems not caught by parity or ECC checks on systems in production. In-Field Scan was merged in Linux 5.19 but then shortly thereafter the driver was marked &quot;broken&quot; due to some driver design issues coming to light. New patches for IFS have been posted to improve the driver&#x27;s design and remove that &quot;broken&quot; tag...</span>

Good morning, friends, and welcome to this week&#x27;s Whatcha Been Playing? You find me, nay, us, at a strange crossroads in the long and winding road of Destructoid. As you may have heard — and indeed, read — Jordan Devore has finally decided the time is right to disembark, having been on-board for an amazing 15 years. While Destructoid is going through some major changes, this was not the reason for Devore&#x27;s exodus... He simply believed the door was open and the time was right. I agreed with his hypothesis, and I know that he already has some exciting life prospects and plans ahead, and he is taking the right steps to ensure that he can make the most of them.
I mean, he&#x27;s going to the coast today. Am I going to the coast today? No. So there&#x27;s one example.
Regardless, Jordan w…</span>

No matter how much space I have to process it all, this was never going to be easy to write. After more than 15 years and 15,000 posts, my time at Destructoid — a blog I joined while I was still just a teenager! — has come to an end.
It&#x27;s been a wild ride since the day Niero randomly took a chance on me, and I&#x27;m proud of what the team has accomplished, and will accomplish.
Deep down, I knew I wouldn&#x27;t be here &quot;forever&quot; — but I also knew that I wouldn&#x27;t really want to do this job anywhere else. I didn&#x27;t just want to write about games; I wanted to write about games on Destructoid. On the internet, there&#x27;s no shortage of places to call home. This one&#x27;s been mine for a long time, and it has become an unshakable part of my identity.

                              <span>The strategy RPG is making its way to Nintendo&#x27;s portable console
Tactics fans keep getting more games, and that now includes a surprising port from Aksys Games. Record of Agarest War is making its way to Nintendo Switch in March 2023.
This strategy RPG originally released in 2007 in Japan, eventually making a western debut on the PlayStation 3 in 2009. It&#x27;s since been ported to many other platforms and now, years and years later, it pops up again on Nintendo Switch.
You can check out the trailer here:

No details have been listed yet about whether this will have any new enhancements or features.
Generations of war
If you&#x27;re unfamiliar with Record of Agarest War, it&#x27;s a strategy RPG with a dating twist. Developed as a collaboration between Compile Heart, Red Entertainment, and Idea Factory, you play as several different protagonists embroiled in conflict.
But the way you navigate through the plot is, well, through generations. As the first protagonist, you can romance and marry one of several party members. Then, your child goes on to be protagonist number 2. This plays out across several generations, with the chosen bride affecting the next hero&#x27;s stats and aspects of their appearance.
So yes, fans of Fire Emblem: Awakening&#x27;s child-unit min-maxing might want to take note. This is a bit of a surprise, as Agarest War has been a more niche series in the pantheon of SRPG discussion. But the genre has been surging, with both new titles and remasters of old classics. It looks like Aksys wasn&#x27;t going to let Agarest War sit on the sidelines for this tactical resurgence.
The news arrived as part of an Aksys announcement stream, alongside several other game announcements. Cuddly Forest Friends is set to arrive on Switch in 2023, Spooky Spirit Shooting Gallery heads to Switch in summer 2023, and Tengoku Struggle -Strayside- is set for Switch in 2024.

                              <span>&quot;This update will be smaller than some of our larger updates that bring new content into the game&quot;
A Fallout 76 Halloween event is happening very soon, and it&#x27;ll be ushered in by a &quot;smaller&quot; update to boot.
Here&#x27;s the full rundown from Bethesda:
&quot;Tuesday, October 25th we are planning on releasing a new update to Fallout 76. This update will be smaller than some of our larger updates that bring new content into the game. With this update, we’re bringing new items into the Atomic Shop to release over the coming weeks, addressing a number of bugs, and kicking off a brand-new Challenge event for the 25th Anniversary. We are currently looking to begin maintenance for Fallout 76 at 10:00 a.m. ET on October 25. We will be sure to share update with you in the Bethesda Studios Discord and the Fallout Twitter so that you know precisely when you can log back in. Starting October 25, you can hunt down costumed Scorched throughout Appalachia to loot Mystery Candy, Spooky Treat Bags, and of course, legendary items. Track down Scorched at their usual haunts, keep an ear out for their spine-tingling sounds, and you’re bound to find at least a few who are dressed up for Halloween.&quot;

It&#x27;s been a busy month for Fallout 76 amid the 25th anniversary celebration, and the game just hosted the Invaders from Beyond seasonal event, which ended on October 18. Currently the team is going from event to event: and even if some of them are on repeat at this point, there is some movement beyond the mega-patches.
We&#x27;ll have to wait until the day-of most likely to see what this &quot;smaller&quot; patch actually entails, but suffice to say like most of the micro-updates, they&#x27;ll involve tons of bug fixes: some of which address issues that have been lingering for a while, or crept up in the patch before it.

Something very special from the Arcade Archives this week, as Hamster takes time out from its recent Namco obsession to deliver not only a Tecmo title, but a fun, silly, and particularly obscure one at that — Available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch its forgotten fighter Angel Eyes!
Released to Japanese arcades in 1996, Angel Eyes — or to give it its full title Tōkidenshō Angel Eyes — is a super cult 2D fighter that was renowned for sporting an All Anime Gal cast of scrappers. A selection of fun character tropes, including a school girl, a volleyball player, a kunoichi, an arrogant &quot;ojou&quot; woman, and a young girl with a giant teddy bear (predating Enchantress by several decades), fight it out in cute &#x27;n&#x27; colorful action, set against the backdrop of some equally stra…</span>

                              <span>Fans of the Resident Evil 4 dog known as Hewie wil never forgive you, Capcom
Resident Evil 4 is known as one of the most iconic games of all time. It&#x27;s got stylized gameplay, it&#x27;s got quippy one-liners, and it&#x27;s got a sexy protagonist in the form of Leon Kennedy. Fans of Resident Evil 4 love every frame of that game, so naturally, they&#x27;ve been closely analyzing any footage of the highly anticipated remake until its release in March of next year. One of the most famous details that players encounter early on in the game&#x27;s story is a dog stuck in a bear trap in the woods. Players have the option of either leaving the dog, killing it, or setting it free -- naturally you can imagine which option became the most popular.
IGN reviewed some shocking new footage of the Resident Evil 4 remake, however, and staunch dog-releasers are not going to be too thrilled about what they see. The video shows the player walking the familiar route through the woods, only to find that the dog has already been killed, in a really gruesome way, I might add. It&#x27;s pretty upsetting stuff to see by any standard, but knowing that dog has so many fans (who have affectionately named him Hewie) makes it all that much harder to stomach.
https://twitter.com/CanYouPetTheDog/status/1583248767217995776
While this certainly looks like it&#x27;s in the Resident Evil 4 remake in some capacity, I&#x27;m of the belief that you&#x27;re still able to save the dog after all, and this video is a ploy to get more buzz about the game. Maybe I&#x27;m just in denial, but I have a hard time believing that Capcom would intentionally leave out one of the most beloved details of their entire game. If it is the case that we won&#x27;t see Hewie alive again, at least it makes the experience of having saved him in the original game all the more special.

Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle was a fun surprise, mixing together some unexpected ingredients in Mario, Rabbids, and strategy for a good strategy game. And Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope doesn&#x27;t just repeat; it builds up into a delightful experience that feels all its own.
Sparks of Hope initially follows a similar formula to Kingdom Battle. Mario, Luigi, and Peach are hanging out with their Rabbid counterparts and floating helper Beep-O when a giant space monster attacks. The gang finds out that galaxy&#x27;s at stake, as the evil Cursa is converting minions to her side to gain control of hybrid Rabbid-Luma creatures called Sparks.
The team sets off, with some new tactics and weapons in tow. Those six, alongside newcomer Edge, Bowser, and Rabbid Rosalina, form the Spark…</span>

                              <span>Hans Niemann, the chess grandmaster at the centre of cheating allegations—which you can catch up on here—has filed a suit in a Missouri court suing world champion Magnus Carlsen, his chess app Play Magnus, the website Chess.com, Chess.com’s Daniel Rensch, and streamer Hikaru Nakamura, for $100 million.

With every bit of new info we get on Callisto Protocol, the more excited I am to try it out. Despite being a complete scaredy cat, I&#x27;m excited to try it out with its stealth mechanics, action-packed gunfights, and the overall promise of a creepy sci-fi adventure a la Dead Space. Callisto Protocol is now only a few months away from its release date on December 2, and the developers at Striking Distance Studios have announced that the game is ready for players to enjoy. The game has officially gone gold!
Callisto Protocol is the upcoming space horror action game from Glen Schofield, a game dev veteran who has worked on titles like Call of Duty and, of course, Dead Space. It can be scary to branch off and start a new indie studio, but f…</span>

Taiko no Tatsujin: Rhythm Festival Switch just hit the scene, and as a long time Taiko no Tatsujin player, I couldn&#x27;t resist.
At first glance, Rhythm Festival doesn&#x27;t offer a ton of bells and whistles. The &quot;story mode&quot; really is propelled by a points/rank-up system, which provides you with additional kernels of dialogue with our hero, Don-Chan, and their relationship with other adorable characters. It&#x27;s extremely cute, and although it meanders a bit, it has a lot of heart to keep people interested: especially when it comes to families playing it together (which is what we did in our household).
As usual, your job is to drum two core notes (red and blue, or don and ka respectively): which are denoted by inside and outside drumming on an actual drum set peripheral. I mentioned the …</span>

                              <span>A who&#x27;s who of survival horror
As part of yesterday evening&#x27;s Resident Evil Showcase, Capcom announced that it would be holding a short early access test session for its delayed multiplayer title Resident Evil Re: Verse. The beta will take place between Sunday, October 23, and Tuesday, October 25 on PS4, PC, and Xbox One platforms.
The purpose of this short beta is to test the crossplay capabilities of the multiplayer shooter ahead of its release on October 28 — cutting it a bit close, perhaps, but nevertheless. Anyone with a copy of Resident Evil Village can participate in the beta, all you need do is download the client from the store of your choosing and you&#x27;ll be ready to rock once the switches are flicked on the servers. Boom schlack-lack.

Originally intended to launch as the multiplayer component of Resident Evil Village, Re:Verse has been repeatedly delayed as the developer worked to stabilize the build and its contents. The multiplayer game — essentially an evolution of the popular &quot;Mercenaries&quot; mode — will see a legacy of familiar stars from the Resident Evil franchise fighting it out in a series of modes set against the backdrop of some familiar locales.
In addition to the last-minute beta, Capcom also offered up initial details for Re:Verse&#x27;s post-launch content. Launching with six &quot;Survivors&quot;, five &quot;Creatures&quot;, two stages, a challenge mission, and a 30-level battle pass, Resident Evil Re:Verse will receive several initial updates, each adding more characters, stages, costumes, missions, and modes. There are currently three updates planned post-launch, but dates and details were not forthcoming.
Resident Evil Re:Verse launches October 28 on PS4, PC, and Xbox One.

There&#x27;s more in store for the world of digital monsters. Digimon game producers Kazumasa Habu and Takahiro Yokota confirm that &quot;multiple&quot; Digimon game projects are in the works.
The news arrives alongside the confirmation that Digimon World: Next Order is getting ported to the PC and Switch. In a video from the duo, they confirm that there&#x27;s more in store for Digimon.
&quot;Currently, we have multiple Digimon game projects in the pipeline,&quot; said Habu. &quot;And Digimon World: Next Order is actually handled by a new producer that joined the Digimon game team this year.&quot;
https://twitter.com/digimon_games/status/1583141278513889281
No details on what those projects are yet. As for Digimon World: Next Order, the 2017 game is getting some quality-of-life features for its PC and Switch port.
One addition is a &quot;Beginner Mode&quot; difficulty setting. Alongside that, the Digimon team is also adding a run option. Finally, some cardio in the digital world.
Digimon World: Next Order will hit PC and Nintendo Switch on February 22, 2023.

Digital champions
There&#x27;s been a few Digimon games steadily trickling out, including one this year. Digimon Survive finally launched this last July, after a series of delays.
And before that, the frequently praised Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth made its way to Nintendo Switch and PC.
Now, Next Order is next up on the docket and more projects are potentially on the way. Although we don&#x27;t have any details, this still seems like good news for Digimon fans who have been holding out for more from the franchise.

Digital retailer Epic Games Store has revealed the two new titles that it will be offering up to all users free-of-charge next week — Come October 27, we will be getting a little creep, and a little carnage, with the arrival of horror adventure Saturnalia and tabletop strategy sim Warhammer 40,000: Mechanicus.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;v1qGfWjlv8s
Making its grand debut on October 27, Saturnalia is a mood-piece horror title developed by Italian studio Santa Ragione and encapsulating the country&#x27;s love of oppressive, colorful, and unnerving tales of the macabre. This roguelike adventure will see the player control an ensemble cast of characters, who find themselves trapped within a labyrinthine village under the power of some ancient, otherworldly evil.

Pairing asymmetrical multiplayer experts IllFonic with the Ghostbusters license is a match made in the spirit realm. Previous outings Friday the 13th and Predator: Hunting Grounds pit Jason and Predator against camp counselors and mercenaries with flashes of greatness, but technical issues and uneven design choices held them back. With Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed, the team has applied everything it’s learned about compelling asymmetrical multiplayer to a property that perfectly lines up with the game…</span>

                              <span>Standing here, I realize that this Super Replay will be a cut above the rest because we’ll be slicing and dicing in Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance! Join us today on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central to enjoy two hours of what will be a full playthrough of the cult favorite action game streaming weekly each Friday. You can also catch up on previous episodes by visiting our new Game Informer Shows YouTube channel or watching the embedded video below. 
Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance serves as a sequel/spin-off to Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots that puts cyborg ninja Raiden at the helm. Instead of sneaking around in boxes, players eviscerate foes in fast-paced, stylish action courtesy of developer Platinum Games. Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look. Will I acquire a new appreciation for the game nine years later? How many watermelons will I slice? You’ll have to tune in to find out. 


Join me, Marcus Stewart, as I revisit Raiden’s beloved solo adventure.

Going into my hands-on time with Pokémon Scarlet, I was expecting some changes based on the ninth generation’s embrace of open-world gameplay and a “do what you want when you want” mentality with its three primary story paths. Pokémon has yet to take the massive generational shift I’ve dreamed of for years and has instead opted for half-steps with each new entry. Scarlet isn’t the transformation I hoped for, but it’s significantly more than a simple half-step, representing arguably the most considerable shift in mainline Pokémon history.

                              <span>Capcom held a special Resident Evil showcase yesterday, revealing more about the upcoming Resident Evil Village Gold Edition, that game&#x27;s Shadows of Rose DLC, and its remake of Resident Evil 4. 
Capcom revealed that it was remaking the beloved classic earlier this year, giving it a March 24, 2023 release date. Now, the company has released a second trailer for Resident Evil 4 and simply put, this game looks stunning. It wasn&#x27;t a surprise when Capcom revealed it was remaking Resident Evil 4 – it was next in line after all – but given how well-regarded the original is, plenty of people were skeptical this remake would live up to its legacy. Capcom is deadset on proving skeptics wrong if yesterday&#x27;s trailer is any indication. 
Check out the new Resident Evil 4 remake trailer for yourself below:

The popular Game of Thrones prequel was already quite popular among pirates and this release is drawing even more attention.

                              <span>EU Advocate General Maciej Szpunar has published his advice on potential liability for streaming platforms when subscribers use VPN services to bypass geo-blockades. According to the opinion, streaming services are not liable for VPN &#x27;pirates&#x27;, as long as they implement reasonable geo-blocking technology.

                              <span>This week, the Uncharted: Legacy Of Thieves Collection came to PC, marking the first time Nathan Drake&#x27;s Tombraider-but-a-bro adventures have arrived on our fair platform. It is also, err, a collection of the last games in the series. The bundle comprises Uncharted 4: A Thief&#x27;s End and The Lost Legacy, a standalone Uncharted adventure featuring ladythieves Chloe Frazer and Nadine Ross (they are thieves who are ladies, they don&#x27;t steal women). Uncharteds 1-3, on the other hand, are nowhere to be seen. In fact, the only way to play them on PC right this second is to buy an expensive PlayStation Plus Premium subscription and stream them via the cloud as part of the Nathan Drake Collection - a far from ideal solution.
This puts us PC lot in a bit of a pickle. Naturally, if you haven&#x27;t played any of these PlayStation exclusives until now, you&#x27;re missing three entire games worth of story context. So, is it worth starting with Uncharted 4? The short answer is, &quot;Yes&quot;. The long answer is, &quot;Yeeeeeeeeeees - probably&quot;.

It&#x27;s about starting a job in a museum and archive based around a former tobacco plantation, and run by the extremely wealthy descendants of its owners. It&#x27;s not about what great people they were. It didn&#x27;t feel like trauma porn, but obviously I can only speak as a ludicrously white person from another country.
What it is definitely good at it is representing real historical research, and who gets to write the history that suits them.

                              <span>Anyone who’s played the charming Tunic knows that it’s a little cryptic. There’s an immediately nonsensical language to try and decipher, for one thing. Then you’ve got an in-game manual that’s been pulled apart, with pages strewn around the world to find before you can figure out how to do everything your little fox is capable of. Well, now audio designer Kevin Regamey has explained a whole other secret side to Tunic, and it turns out the game’s soundtrack hides a whole other language.

                              <span>As Ed detailed in his review earlier this week, Gotham Knights is a bit of a disappointing dud. I&#x27;ve also been picking my way through Gotham City as various members of the bat family, weightlessly punching dudes in alleys before crafting new sticks that hit 2% harder than the one I was using before. Despite a relatively good looking rendition of the iconic gothic metropolis and a pretty engaging story, Gotham Knights ultimately failed to capture my imagination. 


It didn&#x27;t help that throughout my time with Gotham Knights, I was thinking about the Arkham series. Rocksteady&#x27;s trio of Batman-em-ups are essential superhero games, titles that redefined the genre and provided a template that still feels contemporary to this day. Aslyum, City and Knight fully immerse you in the Batman fantasy, successfully crafting a depiction of the caped crusader that was deadly, capable and - perhaps best of all - human.

The early access version of the game will allow you to fully travel around the Kerbolar system - can’t quite believe I typed that - which has been given a major overhaul since the first game. There’ll also be more than 350 new parts to build your spacecraft with. You can watch a lengthy chat with the Kerbal team about their early access mission below.

                              <span>Last night, I caught up with a dear old friend the classic way: over a round of Left 4 Dead 2. Valve&#x27;s cooperative FPS is still a great hangout game after 13 years but while waiting for my pal to log on, I did think I might refresh it by browsing the Steam Workshop and installing some popular mods. Turns out, modders have made lots of anime girls and VTuber avatars to replace friends, enemies, and even guns. What an experience! It is startling to discover that the blue-haired anime approaching you is not a teammate but, in fact, a vomit-filled Boomer.

                              <span>In typically British, self-deprecating fashion, I’m happy to admit I’m not very good at Soulslike games, the massively successful Elden Ring included. That’s why I raised an intrigued eyebrow while sipping my seventeenth cup of tea today, after I saw Twitch streamer Luality playing FromSoftware’s latest with just a drawing tablet. Taking on the challenge with admirable confidence, Luality used a virtual keyboard on the tablet’s left side for movement, and bound strokes of the stylus to attack its enormous monsters.

                              <span>There&#x27;s a particular battle in the first chapter of Tactics Ogre: Reborn that I&#x27;ve been banging my head against all week. It&#x27;s an uphill fort siege where you&#x27;re facing off against an evil necromancer who&#x27;s shooting down powerful, magical fireballs at you from above, alongside his never-ending army of undead skelly archers. The challenging terrain alone would be a test of anyone&#x27;s mettle in this tough, turn-based strategy game, especially when trying to parse all the different heights of its grid-based map. But having every enemy unit resurrect themselves after three turns unless you exorcise them with a single-use item or the lone Priest you&#x27;ve just recruited (who you may or may not have neglected to bring into battle with you) on top of all that? That smacks of the kind of late-game tomfoolery that more modern games of this ilk would normally save until their final acts. 
Tactics Ogre: Reborn, on the other hand, likes to make its players sweat early. It was, after all, forged in the fires of the mid-90s SNES era, and looking back at old GameFAQ guides from 2010 (when it was remade for the PSP), it&#x27;s clear this fight was just as much of a roadblock back in the day as it is now. Think of it as what yer lad Genichiro was to Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice - a hard, and often gruelling endurance test of everything you&#x27;d learned so far, but one that would ultimately set you up for the rest of the game upon claiming victory. I&#x27;m still not quite there yet, but having spent six hours noodling around the rest of Reborn&#x27;s opening chapter, this granddaddy of Japanese strategy RPGs sure does hold up in the cold light of 2022.

So if you were thinking of hanging your Steam Deck up like a piñata today and whacking it with a big stick to see what goodies are hiding in there, just grab the client beta update instead. You can opt in by heading to Settings, selecting System, and then the Steam Update Channel.

                              <span>Frosty survival game The Long Dark is releasing the first part of its paid expansion, Tales From The Far Territory, in December. The expansion is part of devs Hinterland Studio’s efforts to make further improvements to the game’s Survival Mode, and will be split into multiple releases over twelve months. I’m getting a Stranger Things season four vibe from what’s been shown so far. You can see for yourself by watching the short, and quite dark, teaser trailer below.

                              <span>About three years after I graduated, I returned to the city where I went to University. Immediately after arriving, I embarked on an early-evening pilgrimage of sorts, my only goal to wander once familiar paths in an attempt to capture a spark of the life I no longer lived. As I ambled past houses that used to be homes, local haunts and darkened lecture halls, it was the differences that stood out the most. Pubs with names I didn’t recognise. Shops in locations that were more convenient than the ones I used to rely upon. Huge buildings that had seemingly sprung out of deserted scrubland. The city felt intimate yet alien. I was both a stranger and a local, a foreigner in a place I’d once adored.


I was thinking about this experience a lot when I was invited to play a short hands-on demo of Capcom’s upcoming Resident Evil 4 remake. Here is a remake of my favourite game ever made, a title I have replayed countless times in the 17 years since its original debut, and all I can do is think about the little things. Tiny alterations that feel much larger when surrounded by something so immediately recognisable. This was the same Resident Evil 4 I’ve always known, but one that feels bigger, better and more dynamic. I left my session excited to play more, cautiously optimistic that Capcom may be in the process of crafting their best remake to date.

                              <span>Square Enix and developer Creative Business Unit III have released a new trailer for Final Fantasy XVI called “Ambition,” and it features plenty of details about the realm of Valisthea, its multiple kingdoms, Eikons, and much more. 
Since its reveal in 2020, Square Enix has been slowly doling out information about this hotly-anticipated RPG. With beloved Final Fantasy XIV director and producer Naoki Yoshida in the producer seat for this title, many are excited to see what a single-player mainline Final Fantasy looks like from him and his team. A few trailers have been released, further detailing this medieval fantasy adventure, and now, Square Enix has released a new four-and-a-half-minute video to showcase even more of what to expect.

One of my biggest gripes with the mainline Borderlands series is its humor. I’ve had some good laughs while playing, but Borderlands’ jokes land more like a shotgun blast where some hit and others don’t. That’s okay in bursts, but shotgun blast after shotgun blast can get exhausting.

Technically, the summons are called Eikons in this version of Squeenix&#x27;s long-running JRPG series, and from the looks of the trailer, you&#x27;ll be battling as them directly in big, dramatic battle sequences. A bit like in Final Fantasy X, just with an infinitely higher number of enormous explosions. Let&#x27;s take a look, shall we?

One is Bethesda’s first instalment of their take on the retro-futuristic post-apocalypse in Fallout 3. There’s also Shiro Games’ ode to classic console RPGs, the Evoland series.

                              <span>As a James who’s always forgetting things, I’m probably the main target audience of the Silent Hill 2 remake – one of yesterday’s many Silent Hill game and film announcements. Nevertheless, I wouldn’t have expected such high demands from its PC system requirements, which have appeared on Steam.


Highlights include the AMD Radeon RX 5700 and Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 – a former flagship! – listed among the minimum specs, alongside a 12GB RAM requirement, and Windows 11 as the recommended OS. Those with a GeForce RTX graphics card could get some performance help, though, as the requirements’ notes say that meeting the recommended spec will allow for 4K resolution “using DLSS or similar technology”. That’s not quite a formal confirmation of Nvidia DLSS support, but strongly indicates it, maybe along with similar upscaling systems like AMD FSR or Intel XeSS.

                              <span>Overwatch 2 hero Bastion has been missing-in-action for over a week now, but Blizzard have now set a date for his return, alongside fellow missing hero Torbjorn. In an update on the Overwatch forums, Blizzard confirmed that the missing characters should be returning to the game on October 25th, alongside the Junkertown map, which has also recently been disabled due to graphical performance bugs. Their return coincides with the game’s next planned update.

                              <span>The Intel Core i5-13600K fills a familiar role in the latest 13th Gen/Raptor Lake series of CPUs. There are chips in this family with many more cores and even higher clock speeds, like the £700 Core i9-13900K, but this is the one most upgrade-seekers will probably look to first: a mid-range champion to take over from the Core i5-12600K.

                              <span>Valve have updated their Steamworks documentation for developers with a commitment to refresh their suggestions for regional pricing more often. This change in frequency is an effort to reflect global and local economic conditions affecting regions. While the company reminds developers that they are free to set their own prices in different regions, Steam provides regional pricing suggestions based on the price of a game in US dollars. Those recommendations should be updated more regularly, Valve said.

                              <span>I watched a badminton match where one player was so dominant, his opponent looked like he&#x27;d largely given up. The commentator said, &quot;Yep, the belief has all but vanished&quot;, as it panned over a guy who simply wanted to be anywhere but that court. At the time, I&#x27;d already sunk some hours into Gotham Knights and taken a quick break from the action to keep tabs on a tournament and collect my thoughts. But as I turned away from the telly to dive back in for another session, I couldn&#x27;t help but think that if the same commentator had been in the room with me too, they would&#x27;ve repeated themselves. I&#x27;d simply had enough.

                              <span>In every story where a wish is granted - whether by some primary-coloured goon sticking out a lamp, a creepy piece of fairground entertainment, or a piece of cursed bushmeat - there&#x27;s always an ironical sting in the tale. You wish for health and it turns out you can&#x27;t die. You wish for a personal chef, but it turns out he only does offal. You wish everything you touch to turn to gold, then it&#x27;ll turn out there&#x27;s no way to turn it off - or it kicks in just as you go to the toilet, that kind of thing. You should, as the saying goes, be careful what you wish for.
I&#x27;m sorry I wished for New Tales From the Borderlands, everyone.

                              <span>As we reported earlier this week, alongside The Sims 4 officially becoming a free-to-play game, Maxis also gave a sneak peek of Project Rene, the next incarnation of the Sims franchise. We&#x27;re all calling it The Sims 5, but the vagueness of the reveal means it could be some kind of... platform? MMO? And personally I think 4 being free-to-play means bets could be off on it being a new standalone. But what do I know? It&#x27;s very early for Maxis to be showing it off, a point hammered home by VP of franchise creative Lyndsay Pearson as she talked about it. And the fact that it is so early makes it look even more like a bid to stop player eyes wandering over to newer pastures...

We&#x27;re still working to get our proposed RPS Game Club off the ground, for example, but finding a good quality source of regular game keys for it has proven to be an elusive endeavour, to say the least. I&#x27;d imagine this will probably be a project for 2023 now (a delay, how quaint!), given how close we are to the end of the year, but I&#x27;ll keep you posted as soon as we&#x27;ve got more to share on it.
Things that are happening though, is the return of The RPS 100, which you may have seen us post about earlier in the week. This is our annual countdown of our favourite PC games of all time, as voted for by the RPS Treehouse. This year&#x27;s list is quite different to the one we did last year - we do, after all, have pretty much a brand-new team in place now - and I&#x27;m looking forward to sharing that with you all next week. We even got our art team to make a special fancy header image for it this year and everything! Plus, if you were one of the people put out by our (accidental) glossing over of a certain immersive sim last year, you really won&#x27;t want to miss it.

                              <span>The piracy liability trial between several major record labels and ISP Grande Communications is underway. When the parties presented their opening statements, Grande informed the jury that it will present a witness who has spoken to multiple innocent infringers. That came as a surprise to the labels and prompted a request for the court to exclude &#x27;hearsay&#x27; evidence from the jury.

                              <span>Deep Rock Galactic is a game about going to work, assuming your job is to extract space minerals from a shattered planet occupied by trillions of giant, murderous bugs. If it isn’t, it’s not too hard to pretend, and DRG’s another-day-at-the-office wit lends it a likeable levity that’s partly why I’ve played it almost every week for a year and a half.

                              <span>The last time we saw Amicia and Hugo de Rune in A Plague Tale: Innocence, the two homeless orphans were escaping the clutches of the Inquisition, trying desperately to find a cure for the cursed Prima Macula in Hugo’s blood. They were also fighting for their lives against thousands of bloodthirsty rats eager to devour them. These two have lived through more danger and trauma than anyone should have in a thousand lifetimes, and after the first game’s sort-of happy-ish ending, it got me thinking: when will these kids ever catch a break?
Turns out the answer is never. Asobo’s follow-up A Plague Tale: Requiem is just as gory and bleak as its predecessor and as the siblings continue to battle through a violent world that wants them dead, they&#x27;ll both face difficult moral decisions in the name of survival. Oh, and there are more rats. Like, a lot more rats.

                              <span>Konami might have just accidentally leaked the reveal of one of the new Silent Hill games due to be announced later this evening. Earlier this week, the publisher announced there would be a Silent Hill Transmission stream taking place today, October 19th, which would provide &quot;the latest updates&quot; on the series. At the time, there were no streaming links available, but in setting their YouTube page live this morning, Konami jumped the gun and included some of the game names being revealed. And it&#x27;s the big one, folks. Spoilers within, obvs.

Arguably the biggest news from the presentation is that Bloober Team, the developer behind The Medium and other horror games, is remaking Silent Hill 2. The trailer for the game showed scenes from the iconic game with all-new visuals. The Silent Hill 2 remake is coming to PC via Steam and will be a PlayStation 5 console exclusive for at least a year after launch.


Konami followed up with Silent Hill Townfall, a new game from developer No Code, the creators of Observation and Stories Untold. The teaser shared for the game offered little in the way of game details, but the implication is that it will be someth…</span>

The publisher is airing a special presentation that promises new Silent Hill reveals today at 2 p.m. Pacific/5 p.m. Eastern. Could it be the much-rumored Silent Hill 2 remake by Bloober Team? Confirmation of the seemingly leaked Silent Hill: The Short Message? Whatever it winds up being, come and watch the event along with us!
Editors Marcus Stewart and the freshly returned Kyle Hilliard will be streaming and reacting to the Silent Hill transmission on Twitch beginning about 10-15 mins before the festivities begin (roughly 3:30 p.m. Central/4:30 p.m Eastern). Come hang with them along with the rest of the GI community and share excitement (or disappointment) at what Konami has in store. Missed the stream? Watch the YouTube version below!

                              <span>It&#x27;s the middle of the month, which means it&#x27;s time for another batch of Game Pass games to be detailed. For a start, today sees the day one release of A Plague Tale: Requiem, the followup to everyone&#x27;s favourite Middle Ages ratventure. There are similarly big games to come before the end of the month, however, including Persona 5 Royal.

                              <span>I used to think Ghostbusters was a fantasy about having a cool car and a slidey pole in your house. Now that I&#x27;m an adult I realise it&#x27;s actually a fantasy about having ample free time to hang out with your friends in New York. But I suppose it&#x27;s also about bustin&#x27; ghosts, which is what Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed&#x27;s asymmetric multiplayer replicates. It&#x27;s out today.

That&#x27;s because, during today&#x27;s Sims Summit livestream, Maxis also announced that the next The Sims is in-development. Currently codenamed Project Rene, it&#x27;s a few years away, although we saw some early footage of its creative tools in action.

                              <span>Robot damage hero Bastion has been unplayable in Overwatch 2 for the past week due to some unfortunate shenanigans with his artillery ultimate. It was only meant to be temporary, Blizzard said. Yet this increasingly lengthy absence from the game&#x27;s resulted in some players treating the poor droid as though he&#x27;d passed away rather than becoming glitched out for a little while.

                              <span>My initial instinct when playing Payday 2 was to be sneaky. If I could creep through banks, jewellery stores, and all the rest without being detected, surely that’d be awesome. Only, the pursuit of that was anything but awesome. It was a gruelling slog of planning and restarts with rarely a sliver of success. So, I chucked my silencer away and donned the biggest suit of armour I could find. Unsurprisingly, the biggest joy in Payday 2 is going loud, and it turns out I’m a big fan of playing stealth games that allow you to skip stealth entirely.

Hailing from some of the devs behind Blizzard’s successful digital CCG Hearthstone, Marvel Snap takes the House Of Ideas’ superheroic formula and runs with the current multiversal obsession of the MCU. The game also mixes in the art and variants you’d expect from Marvel’s comic book output.

                              <span>The PC continues to collect PlayStation mascots like they’re Maccies Monopoly tickets. This time it’s adventuring iron-quiffed quipper Nathan Drake, courtesy of Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection, which is out on Steam on November 19th. And where there’s a Steam game, there’s usually a Steam Deck game, so Liam and I have both busted out the handhelds to see how well this remastered bundle of Uncharted: A Thief’s End and Uncharted: The Lost Legacy takes to more portable hardware. That includes the best settings to use if you want to play it on your own Steam Deck.
You can watch Liam’s video below to see how he got on, along with footage of how Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection runs in situ. After swapping notes we’ve settled on a settings guide that will get you consistently decent performance across both the individual games; if you’d prefer it in text form, read on.

                              <span>Guildford in the UK isn’t a place that you’d expect to feature in games. It’s very much your typical British town, replete with shops, restaurants, and many, many double yellow lines. That’s why it’s pretty astonishing to see a section of Guildford recreated on a distant world in sci-fi exploration sim No Man’s Sky. Why Guildford though? Well, it&#x27;s because devs Hello Games are based there. Their office and the surrounding streets have been constructed in-game by No Man’s Sky player Joan, a.k.a. Rasdar07, and shared in the base building chat on the game’s Discord server.

                              <span>I loved Overwatch when it first came out. When the original game was fresh and new, I was experimenting with the characters just like everyone else. I found my niche in support, and got to be a pretty decent player with Mercy and Lúcio (I was particularly proud of the latter, because I flatter myself that he&#x27;s quite difficult to play well). Then, you know, life happened. I didn&#x27;t have as much time to play, and I just kind of stopped playing Overwatch.
I appear to have nodded off or something, because there are now 35 heroes on the roster, and Overwatch 2 is out. What. Who allowed this? I wish to speak to someone in charge. Jeff? Jeff From The Overwatch Team? Are you there? Jeff is still in charge right? Wait, wh-

                              <span>A few more classics have made their way onto EA’s list of games they’re shutting down online services for, with Mirror’s Edge the most notable casualty for PC players. The shutdown will come into effect from January 19th, 2023, just overshooting the 13th anniversary of the game’s launch on PC. It’ll presumably affect the dystopian parkour game’s online leaderboards, and downloadable Ghosts of other players.

I first reported on this free pumpkin carving game from Adamgryu (of A Short Hike fame) way back in 2020, when it was only the 999th festival, and Alice0 took a stroll around it last year, too.
This year the pumpkins are back, and better than ever. Download the Pumpkin Fest for pay-what-you-can on Itch, carve your very own pump with the tools provided, and place it among the efforts of others in a peaceful spooky scene. You can take a walk around and vote for your favourite pumps. But this isn&#x27;t the only pumpkin game to enjoy! I&#x27;ve found a couple of others, too. It&#x27;s the reason for the spooky season.

Good job that Capcom have announced they’re streaming a Resident Evil showcase this Thursday, October 20th, then. They’ve even roped in Resident Evil Village’s Merchant to narrate the trailer for it. Watch below for a quick look at what’s coming up in the showcase stream.

                              <span>Warner Bros. Games has announced Mortal Kombat: Onslaught, a mobile-exclusive Mortal Kombat experience. The game is described as a collection role-playing game where players build a roster of fighters from the Mortal Kombat universe and “unleash them in massive real-time group battles.” It’s more than just battles, though – Onslaught is also said to feature a cinematic story experience where fighters have to defeat a “dark and dangerous threat.”
This is not the first time Mortal Kombat has appeared on a mobile device. Mortal Kombat Mobile was released in 2015 alongside Mortal Kombat X and eventually adapted characters and features from Mortal Kombat 11 as well. Mortal Kombat Mobile has been downloaded over 150 million times since its launch, so it’s no wonder WB Games wants to release more games from the franchise.
October 8 marked the series’ 30th anniversary, and Mortal Kombat: Onslaught seems to be a celebration of that. Not only is it the newest mobile game in the series, but it’s also the most recent title since the release of Mortal Kombat 11 Ultimate in 2020. As far as the future of the series is concerned outside of the mobile market, Netherrealm has been pretty quiet lately. Outside of our interview with franchise co-creator Ed Boon where he said we&#x27;d have to wait a little longer, the most recent news we’ve received has been this tweet:

Mortal Kombat: Onslaught is coming out sometime in 2023. If you want to sign up for more updates, you can visit their website here. If you’re hungry for more Mortal Kombat, check out this trailer celebrating its 30th anniversary.</span>

                              <span>Sony announced the PlayStation 5 DualSense Edge controller in August, and now, it has revealed that it will be released this January for $199.99. 
When it was first announced, PlayStation didn&#x27;t reveal too much about its take on the Xbox Elite Series controller type, but it was clear that it was a &quot;pro&quot; version of the DualSense controller, aimed at PS5 enthusiasts. Now, the company has detailed more of what to expect in a new trailer you can check out below: 


The controller will be available to preorder from select retailers starting next week, on October 25. It will be released on January 26, which is the same day the &quot;replaceable stick modules&quot; will be available too. Those will cost $19.99. 
&quot;The DualSense Edge wireless controller features a host of hardware and software-based personalization options, including button remapping, the ability to fine-tune stick sensitivity and triggers, options to swap between multiple control profiles, and a unique on-controller user interface,&quot; a PlayStation Blog post reads. &quot;It also sports the signature comfort and immersive features of the DualSense wireless controller, like haptic feedback and adaptive triggers.
&quot;You can make the DualSense Edge wireless controller uniquely yours with the included three changeable set of stick caps and two changeable sets of back buttons. Everything will come bundled in the included carrying case, and you can even charge the controller via USB connection while it&#x27;s stored in the case to make sure you&#x27;re always ready for your next play session.&quot; 
PlayStation has included a breakdown of everything you get alongside the carrying case too: 
DualSense Edge wireless controller
USB braided cable
2 Standard caps
2 High dome caps
2 Low dome caps
2 Half dome back buttons
2 Lever back buttons
Connector housing
Carrying case

                              <span>Fortnitemares, the annual Halloween-inspired event in Fortnite, is now live and it brings werewolves, Evil Dead&#x27;s Ash Williams, and Rick &amp; Morty&#x27;s Summer Smith (Morty&#x27;s sister) and Mr. Meeseeks to the game. 
Epic Games announced the event with a quick gameplay trailer teasing what to expect alongside a look at how being a werewolf works in Fortnite. Plus, you can get a quick glimpse of Ash using his infamous chainsaw (it&#x27;s unclear if it&#x27;s attached at this point), likely alluding to the fact that this chainsaw might be a weapon pickup around the battle island, akin to the recent Kamehameha or E-11 Blaster Rifle mythic weapons in recent weeks.

An MPA investigation to identify the site&#x27;s operator was met with sophisticated countermeasures. It ended at a UK property that has been publicly linked to other crimes worth billions of dollars. And a site called KickassTorrents.

Going into A Plague Tale: Requiem, developer Asobo Studio’s follow-up to 2019’s A Plague Tale: Innocence, I was prepared for the usual jump in quality and scale that most sequels embrace. I underestimated just how significant that leap would be, though. Calling Requiem a standard sequel is a disservice; Asobo has created a Plague Tale epic. It feels Odyssean in scope and storytelling prowess. Although much of it came together for me by the end of my 20-plus hour journey through medieval France, the game feels stra…</span>

                              <span>Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope doesn’t release until Thursday, October 20, but the review embargo lifts today. However, I’m still journeying through Mario’s latest tactical crossover, so I’m not ready to give a full verdict as of yet. In the meantime, however, here are some impressions based on roughly the first half of the game.
As a fan of Kingdom Battle, I’ve enjoyed what I’ve played of Sparks of Hope. It retains the core strategic gameplay of the original, so if you liked the first game, you’ll probably enjoy this as well. Removing the grid and having freedom of movement feels liberating, however, and is one of the big game-changers. It&#x27;s interesting because this doesn&#x27;t change my approach to playing a turn-based tactics game. Heroes still have limited ranges and can’t move after attac…</span>

Silent Hill’s future has been the subject of numerous rumors over the last couple of years, and it appears we’re finally getting a clear answer on what’s next. Konami is broadcasting a Silent Hill Transmission this week.
The event airs Wednesday, October 19 at 2:00 p.m. Pacific/5 p.m. Eastern. A tweet only states the presentation will feature “the latest updates for the Silent Hill series.&quot; The tweet links to a new Silent Hill website, but it currently doesn&#x27;t offer any more information. 
In your restless dreams, do you see that town?
#SILENTHILL Transmission on Wednesday, October 19th, at 2:00 PM. PDThttps://t.co/8Knoq9xYsa
October 16, 2022
Konami reportedly has multiple Silent Hill projects in development at various studios, a rumor recently corroborated by Silent Hill movie director Christopher Gans. The most persistent is that Bloober Team, creators of The Medium and Layers of Fear, is remaking Silent Hill 2. Late September, it was reported that a title called Silent Hill: The Short Message had been rated in South Korea. 
The last full-fledged Silent Hill game was 2012’s ill-recieved Book of Memories for PS Vita. Of course, there was also 2014&#x27;s P.T., the formerly playable teaser for Hideo Kojima&#x27;s canceled Silent Hills. 
For years, Silent Hill fans have had to settle for rumor and innuendo in regards to what’s next for the series, so hopefully, Wednesday’s presentation rewards that patience with some exciting announcements. What do you expect to see at the Silent Hill Transmission? Let us know in the comments!</span>

                              <span>Your host Wesley LeBlanc discusses Persona 5 Royal, the hugely successful Atlus-developed RPG originally released in 2019 as a new version of the original 2016 Persona 5. After years of hopeful waiting, Persona 5 Royal has finally made its way to Switch, and we&#x27;ve been playing it. 
In today&#x27;s installment of New Gameplay Today, your host talks about the lasting legacy of Persona 5 Royal, what makes the game so special, and how it looks and feels on Switch. Enjoy nearly 15 minutes of Persona 5 Royal from the game&#x27;s opening moments (so you don&#x27;t have to worry about spoilers too much if you haven&#x27;t played the game elsewhere!). 


Personal 5 Royal hits Switch on October 21, which is the same day the game hits Xbox and PlayStation consoles and PC too. You can check out our thoughts on the game on PlayStation 4 in Game Informer&#x27;s Persona 5 Royal review.

Then I played it again to see another ending, even knowing I am a big scaredy baby. Ugh. I will regret having played this next time I clean my flat at night.

                              <span>I refer to Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines as &quot;my favourite video game of all time&quot; with such frequency that it&#x27;s basically a catchphrase of mine. The thing is, though, I really dislike slogans; they&#x27;re meant to stir up emotions while bypassing our capacity to think critically. So I thought this retrospective was a good opportunity to remind myself of why I still love this janky, weird ARPG about sad bloodsuckers so much, even 18 years after its release.

                              <span>Is it just me, or did Persona 5 never feel quite at home on the PlayStation 4? Sure, it looked gorgeous on a big TV, its bright colours popping all over your living room, but it always felt bit wrong to me. I think it&#x27;s all about pacing. Persona 5&#x27;s blend of turn-based combat and life sim elements hardly moves at a breakneck speed. There&#x27;s a lot of reading. A lot of listening to your pals chat about their hopes and fears. A lot of pressing one button to progress a line of dialogue onto the next. Shoving that on your 65&quot; 4K TV always seemed a bit overkill.


Basically, I never got into Persona 5 when it first launched on PS4. I played about three hours of it and then binned it off in favour of something else. In 2020, during a moment of first-lockdown madness, I bought Persona 5 Royal for full price, thinking maybe my issue with the original release was that there wasn&#x27;t enough of it, but surprisingly discovered it still wasn&#x27;t for me. At this point, I&#x27;d invested £100 into my &quot;Do I like Persona 5?&quot; experiment and was quickly realising the result was a pretty firm &quot;No, mate, you don&#x27;t&quot;. So when I sat down with the PC version of the game on the Steam Deck to test it out, I figured I&#x27;d play it for a few hours and then never touch it again. I was wrong. I was so very wrong.

                              <span>I finished the original Persona 5 roughly four years ago, and it immediately earned my most coveted award: Edders Really Liked This A Lot, Perhaps More Than Anything Else. Since its updated and expanded Royal version dropped on PlayStation some years later, I&#x27;ve been afraid to make my return. You&#x27;d think I&#x27;d be itching to delve back into what&#x27;s essentially the definitive version of the Phantom Thieves&#x27; adventure, and yet it&#x27;s precisely because it blew me away the first time that I&#x27;ve been reluctant to go back.
Now? Now I feel silly. After playing the early portions of Persona 5: Royal, which finds itself coming to practically every remaining platform this week, including PC, my goodness me, it&#x27;s wonderful to be back in Shibuya with the gang. Already it&#x27;s the Persona 5 I adored, with new cutscenes and pacing adjustments to make it – somehow – even better. Have you never played Persona before? Good! Let me twist your arm. Gi-give, no - give it here!

No, this isn&#x27;t Valve following up their Switch emulator gaffe. Wave hello to the GB Operator.

                              <span>We might finally be getting another Silent Hill game after a decade of mostly, well, silence. Konami have announced that a “Silent Hill Transmission” is set for this Wednesday, October 19th at 10pm BST / 2pm PDT. No details have been shared about whether you’ll be able to tune in on YouTube or Twitch for the stream, but Konami shared a link to a page on their site so you should be able to watch it there.

                              <span>In a bizarre twist to Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 40 series GPU rollout, it turns out there will be no 12GB version of the RTX 4080 at all. Nvidia announced an &quot;unlaunch&quot; of the graphics card, which would have sat below the RTX 4080 16GB and the RTX 4090, effectively cancelling it. The 16GB version will still release as planned on November 16th.


&quot;The RTX 4080 12GB is a fantastic graphics card, but it’s not named right&quot;, reads Nvidia’s statement. &quot;Having two GPUs with the 4080 designation is confusing. So, we’re pressing the &quot;unlaunch&quot; button on the 4080 12GB.&quot;

It&#x27;s part of what&#x27;s coming in the newly announced Batman DLC for Minecraft, as well as the ability to fight Batman&#x27;s rogue gallery including the Penguin, Poison Ivy and The Joker.

If you don&#x27;t have access however, there&#x27;s still time as you can still apply and more players will be let in over the course of this weekend. You might also enjoy watching some streamers play so you have a better sense of it ahead of its release in November.

Today’s Minecraft Live stream showed more of what to expect from the new season of Minecraft Dungeons, including four-player multiplayer for the Tower, a new merchant who handles enchantments, and a free new jungle biome level. I just like the look of the mob-themed onesies, personally.

                              <span>To celebrate Dead Space’s 14th anniversary, Motive Studio held a special livestream showcasing its upcoming remake of the game. The presentation featured an extended guided walkthrough showing off new gameplay footage as well as a rundown of features designed to make the game more terrifying than ever. 
The video’s side-by-side comparisons illustrate the major differences between the original and the remake. One big change is that the Ishimura is now a seamless, interconnected ship that players can explore more freely. For example, using Isaac’s rocket thrusters to soar through areas you could only walk through before. A new system called the Intensity Spawn Director remixes necromorph spawn points, ensuring they’ll ambush veteran players in unexpected ways and, sometimes, in greater numbers. Dead Space also features improved necromorph dismemberment, new side quests designed to flesh out the supporting cast, new alternate fire modes for weapons, new puzzles, and more. 


Dead Space launches on January 27 for PlayStation5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</span>

Also, Wesley explains why he isn&#x27;t enjoying Scorn, the slippery and wet puzzle game we all thought was a first-person shooter. Lastly, Jill talks about her new indie game website, The Indie Informer, and shares what she&#x27;s been up to since departing Game Informer earlier this year.

                              <span>In a new trailer, the Pokémon Company and Nintendo unveiled the mystery Pokémon teased in a video earlier this week. Their name is Bellibolt, and they’re the signature partner of Iono, the newest gym leader from Pokémon Scarlet and Violet.


In Wednesday’s initial video, Iono introduced herself as not just a gym leader but also a streamer. She then asked her fictional followers to guess what her mystery partner Pokémon was based on a handful of details, including its type, the placement of its eyes, and the fact that it’s “so cute.” If you had trouble guessing, don&#x27;t feel bad; today, we’ve learned that her partner is a new Pokémon altogether.
Nintendo and The Pokémon Company released a series of follow-up tweets, giving us new information about Bellibolt that sounds like it was pulled right from the Pokédex. One of the images reveals that they have a new ability called &quot;Electromorphosis,&quot; which allows Bellibolt to power up their next electric-type move after being hit by an attack.
Say hello to the new EleFrog Pokémon, Bellibolt!

You&#x27;ll be able to add Bellibolt to your team when Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet come to switch on November 18.

                              <span>Star Trek: Resurgence is the latest title to get pushed into 2023. The narrative-driven sci-fi adventure will now launch in April to ensure it receives a final coat of polish.
Developer Dramatic Labs announced the news on Twitter, stating it’s taking the extra time to ensure “a truly immersive Star Trek experience”. You can read the full statement below (click the image to enlarge).
Resurgence was first announced during The Game Awards 2021 and is a choice-driven adventure game that follows a similar design template to Telltale Games’ titles (Dramatic Labs consists of ex-Telltale employees). The story unfolds shortly after the events of Star Trek: The Next Generation as players control two original characters, an officer and a commander, to solve a mystery aboard the U.S.S. Resolute. The narrative and your relationships change depending on your choices, and gameplay features light combat and puzzle-solving. Resurgence is currently slated to launch on PlayStation and Xbox consoles and PC. 
We played a demo of Star Trek: Resurgence during Summer Game Fest in June, and you can read our hands-on impressions here. You can also keep up with the plethora of big titles that have been delayed to 2023 by checking out this list.</span>

                              <span>Your hosts Wesley Leblanc is joined by Game Informer editor Marcus Stewart to discuss Scorn, the new puzzle horror game from developer Ebb Software and publisher Kepler Interactive. The two discuss the game&#x27;s narrative, or lack thereof, how Scorn works as a puzzle game, and ultimately, whether or not it&#x27;s a game the two plan to continue playing. 
If you&#x27;re someone who&#x27;s been following Scorn since its reveal years ago, or someone looking for an interesting Xbox console exclusive, look no further than today&#x27;s New Gameplay Today. Enjoy!


Scorn hits Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC on October 14 (coming to both Xbox Game Pass and PC Game Pass too!) so if you&#x27;re reading this and are interested in checking the game out for yourself, you can download it today!

                              <span>It&#x27;s probably a coincidence that I have a headache, but it seems appropriate for how out of my depth One Many Nobody was starting to make me feel. You&#x27;ve likely seen similar games, but this one mixes the usual 2D pixel puzzle business with some hazardous platforming, and a cloning system that rapidly move beyond the obvious &quot;standing on your own shoulders&quot; uses.
The balancing of all that didn&#x27;t quite work for me, but I&#x27;m generally fairly averse to puzzle games and demanding platformers, so you ought not to count that against it. If you&#x27;re more the type to take apart a puzzle step by step than to wing it while your subconscious yells from the sidelines, this could even be a real gem.

                              <span>Star Trek Online turns you into the captain of your own starship. This MMORPG neatly captures the essence of years of Gene Roddenberry’s hopeful, futuristic space romp, rolling in plotlines from the TV shows and movies to create a bizarrely playable blob of nerdy entertainment. It pits you against the Borg. It lets you visit Deep Space Nine. You can even battle the powerful and scary Crystalline Entity that wiped out Data’s homeworld. As a Trek fan, I enjoy Star Trek Online far, far too much.

                              <span>Overwatch 2 won’t be seeing any significant rebalances to its roster of heroes until the free to play shooter enters its second season in early December, Blizzard have confirmed. The game’s developers shared a blog post updating players on how the company are monitoring gameplay, maps, and competitive rankings in the immediate post-launch period. There will, however, be a targeted adjustment to tank Zarya in the next major patch going live on October 25th, Blizzard said.

The footage shows off the complete time traveling Cereza puzzle we showed in our previous video detailing the game’s new features. We also present a combat challenge room in its entirety, plus as a few stylish skirmishes with the Homunguli in Tokyo’s ravaged city streets.

                              <span>Bayonetta 3’s story has been one of its most speculated elements, and a new trailer shows off over four minutes of cutscenes and fresh gameplay. The multiverse takes center stage this time around, and we finally get real looks at the alternative versions of Bayonetta and what they bring to the table.
In addition to Bayonetta and Viola, we see what appear to be three Bayonetta variants. One has a youthful, almost teenage popstar look with strawberry-blonde hair and a hip-hop-esque fashion sense. Another version is clad in almost samurai-like armor. No matter the Bayonetta, the action unleashed by them looks as bonkers as you’d expect. For Jeanne fans, stay tuned until the end of the video, where we get a surprising look at a gameplay segment starring Bayo&#x27;s BFF.

                              <span>Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales is making its way to Steam and The Epic Game Store next month. On November 18, you can swing through Harlem as Miles from the comfort of your PC desktop.
Set one year after the events of Marvel’s Spider-Man, the story follows Miles as he battles the Roxxon corporation and the mysterious Tinkerer. A new trailer shows off the game’s PC features, which are comparable to the first Spider-Man game. Improvements include ray-traced reflections/shadows, unlocked framerate, ultra-widescreen support, Nvidia DLSS 3/DLAA support, Nvidia Reflex, and DualSense controller support. Check it out below.


Here are the PC specifications as well (click the image to enlarge). 
We scored Miles Morales a 9 out of 10 when it was released in November 2020. Former editor Andrew Reiner wrote in his review that: 
&quot;For a second act, Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales satisfies. Taking to the web-line and soaring across a wintery New York skyline is every bit as enthralling as it was before, and Miles develops into a fantastic hero. This follow-up doesn’t have as much of a sinister punch, but it delivers some great plot twists and concludes with another eye-opening post-credits sequence that teases an exciting future for Insomniac’s Spider-Man series.&quot;</span>

                              <span>Final Fantasy VII The First Soldier, the mobile multiplayer battle royale, is being shut down in January. The news comes a month shy of the game&#x27;s one-year anniversary, having launched for iOS and Android in November 2021. 
Square Enix states that it feels it hasn’t delivered the experience it aimed for, so it will begin winding down service starting today. A roadmap on the game’s website lists a three-step sunsetting schedule. Today, you can no longer purchase Shinra credits from the shop, but you can still spend the credits you own until the game shuts down. On November 1, support for non-English localization ends (meaning text will only be displayed in English going forward). Finally, on January 11, The First Soldier goes offline for good.
Here&#x27;s the full End of Service announcement via Twitter:
The First Soldier was revealed in February 2021 alongside another mobile FFVII RPG, Ever Crisis (which has yet to release but has a closed beta planned for this year). The third-person battle royale took place before the events of FFVII and pit 75 players against each other as SOLDIER candidates. In addition to using firearms, players wield magic and even summons. Square previously stated The First Soldier was an attempt to attract a wider fanbase to the FFVII universe while giving existing fans a new way to enjoy its mythos. 
Unfortunately, this isn&#x27;t the first Square Enix published multiplayer game to get the axe this year. Babylon&#x27;s Fall, Platinum Games&#x27; live-service action RPG, is also being shutdown in February, less than a year after its ill-received launch. 
While The First Soldier is going away, plenty of FFVII content is in the pipeline. As previously mentioned, Ever Crisis remains on the docket, and Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII Reunion releases on December 13. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, the follow-up to Remake, is scheduled to launch next winter.</span>

                              <span>The Pokémon Company and Nintendo have released a new Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet trailer all about Iono, the electric-type gym leader of Levincia and the most popular streamer in the Paldean region. 
If you&#x27;re expecting a look at Pokémon Scarlet and Violet gameplay or the reveal of some new Pokémon or gameplay mechanics, temper your expectations because this video is all about Iono. Check out the gym leader Iono trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, there&#x27;s a lot going on in this new video. Iono is very much a Paldean influencer, which is a fun addition to the universe of Pokémon, but she&#x27;s also a gym leader that we&#x27;ll be facing off against in the game. As for her type, it&#x27;s Electric, and while not confirmed, it seems the video is hinting toward a gym challenge for her. Before actually battling her, we might have to successfully complete her &quot;who&#x27;s that Pokémon?&quot; test.
In this instance, she describes her very own Pokémon pal, but we don&#x27;t get the answer. Perhaps we&#x27;re meant to know what it is based on her description or maybe she&#x27;s describing a Pokémon we haven&#x27;t yet met. Only time will tell. Fortunately, we don&#x27;t have to wait too much longer to meet this &quot;Supercharged Streamer&quot; because Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet hit Switch on November 18. 
In the meantime, check out this 14-minute Pokémon Scarlet and Violet gameplay trailer from last week, and then watch this video all about Wiglett, a new Diglett-like Pokémon. Check out this trailer all about competitive play after that, and then read our Pokémon Scarlet and Violet preview for more details about Paldea, Terastallizing, and more. 
Do you have an idea of which Pokémon Iono is describing in today&#x27;s trailer? Let us know in the comments below!</span>

                              <span>Witchfire has been one of the most promising-looking shooters since its reveal in 2017. The dark fantasy romp was slated to launch in early access later this year, but a shift in design has forced developer The Astronauts to push that launch into next year.
The Astronauts has decided to rework Witchfire’s arena-style combat into an open-world format. Creative director Adrian Chmielarz writes in a blog post that the change makes Witchfire a “better” game. 
“The feature is now 95% implemented. It makes the game better. It is kind of hard for me to imagine the player did not have that freedom before. Sure, you can still be trapped by the witch in this or that spot, and some doors will be closed until you find a key, and it might be too dangerous to enter areas closer to the boss before you are ready– but the world is wide open for you to explore in almost any order, and you can both push forward and retreat as you please.”
Chmielarz also teases more Witchfire news to emerge in the next week or so. It won’t be gameplay footage but rather content promoting the game’s art and world in some fashion. 
Witchfire blends gunplay with the supernatural as players wield guns and magic to fend off otherworldly threats. The game is set in an alternate reality where you’re tasked with hunting down a witch at the behest of the church. The Astronauts previously developed The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, and the studio is made up of ex-People Can Fly employees. 
Witchfire is still slated to launch on PC via The Epic Game Store in early 2023. You can watch the most recent trailer from this year’s Summer Game Fest here.</span>

                              <span>Amateur mad scientist Gabe (aka saveitforparts) has repurposed his Raspberry Pi-powered Tricorder and taught it to detect Starlink satellites passing overhead. The device doesn’t actually get satellite internet, but it can pick up Starlink’s beacon signal via  Ku-band radio beacons. What do all these words mean? Starlink is a satellite internet constellation operated by SpaceX. […]

                              <span>In the early &#x27;90s, the fighting game genre was a far cry from what it is today. Inspired by series like Final Fight, Kung-Fu Master, and Karate Champ, the fighting genre emerged in arcades, buoyed by a few significant players in the space. One of those franchises was Mortal Kombat, a bloody, gory fighting game that took concepts from other fighting games and dialed them to 11. The series became notorious for its spine-ripping, heart-grabbing, limb-chopping action, but beneath the controversies and the hearings was a technically sound, capable fighting game. 
The Mortal Kombat franchise has continued to grow and evolve, showcasing massive staying power in a sometimes ruthless industry. Now, 30 years into the series&#x27; existence, Mortal Kombat has proven it&#x27;s here to stay as one of the preemin…</span>

                              <span>Viola, a newcomer to the series and Bayonetta 3’s second playable protagonist, is a figure shrouded in intrigue. This punk rock-inspired warrior hails from another universe and is an Umbra Witch in training. She doesn’t have the same handle on her abilities as Bayonetta (nor her confident elegance), so Viola sports a vastly different playstyle that reflects her inexperience. 


Instead of being adept at using a variety of weapons like Bayonetta, Viola only uses her katana and throwing darts. She also summons her demonic companion Cheshire for backup. What she lacks in finesse, though, she makes up for with raw power.
Playing as Viola, her style feels noticeably more deliberate. She’s still quick, but her sword attacks feel more measured and, most of all, impactful. This approach tells me t…</span>

The game introduces several big additions, quite literally in some cases, to the game’s already winning formula, and you can check them out in this exclusive gameplay video. 
Before we jump on what’s new, the core of Bayonetta 3’s combat remains the same, so veterans will find it easy to slip back into the fun dance of chaining combos, peppering foes with gunfire, unleashing torture attacks, and split-second dodging to trigger the time-slowing Witch Time effect. However, one of Bayonetta’s new tricks is Demon Masquerade. Weapons are now imbued with the power of Bayonetta’s many Infernal Demons.

According to Sega’s Japanese website, the bundle features the Rioreus equipment to outfit Sonic. You’ll also get a grilled meat set, which not only lets you cook up tasty meat but also play mini-games to raise Sonic’s strength. It&#x27;s a small bundle but a neat way to return the favor after Capcom introduced Sonic-themed content in Monster Hunter Rise last year. Check out Sonic in his armored glory in the photo gallery below.

The Monster Hunter pack will be available to download on November 14, almost a week after Frontiers launches on November 8. For more Sonic Frontiers, check out the latest trailer featuring the reveal of Super Sonic.</span>

We&#x27;d also love it if you included your location (city, state, or country will do). We&#x27;ll look through the questions and pick a few to include in our next issue, which releases on November 8.
For each issue, we ask our community a question for our SoundOff section. This time around, we want to know...
&quot;Which video game franchise has the best soundtrack?&quot;
You can answer this question and/or include any other feedback you want. Thank you again for your support throughout the years, and we hope many of you get the chance to have your letter printed in an upcoming issue!

                              <span>It looks like Crash Bandicoot 4: It’s About Time is heading to Steam, with Activision Blizzard announcing the news in an unorthodox fashion. The publisher also appears to be teasing the reveal of a new Crash game 
The publisher sent a special Crash-themed pizza box (from &quot;Aku Aku&#x27;s Steam-In Pizza Shack&quot;) to influencers, such as YouTuber Candian Guy Eh. His unboxing video shows that the box is taped with a not-so-subtle message that Crash 4 heads to Steam on October 18. The game, which launched in 2020, is currently playable on PC only through Battle.net. 
Additionally, the box was also taped with a message that read, “Hungry for more? Try our new Wumpa Pizza for $12.08!” Given that The Game Awards is set to air on December 8, it appears highly likely we’ll find out the nature of this title (rumored to be a party game called Wumpa League) during the annual show.
Are you excited to play Crash Bandicoot 4: It&#x27;s About Time on Steam? What do you think the rumored new game will be? Let us know in the comments!</span>

                              <span>With Persona 5 Royale set to launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox, and Switch on October 21, Atlus has announced the multiplatforms release dates for Persona 3 Portable and Persona 4 Golden. Thankfully, fans only have to wait a few months before all three acclaimed RPG’s become available on modern platforms. 
On January 19, Persona 3 Portable arrives on PlayStation 4, Xbox consoles, Switch, and PC via Steam. That same day, Persona 4 Golden will hit PlayStation 4, Xbox platforms (including Windows), and Switch. Both titles will also be available on Xbox Game Pass at launch.
Persona 3 Portable is the enhanced PSP port of 2007’s Persona 3 (which originally released on PlayStation 2). It launched in 2010 and has never been ported beyond Sony’s handheld. Similarly, Persona 4 Golden is a PS Vita title and the definitive version of its entry, Persona 4. Golden launched in 2012 and has only migrated to Steam, but that didn’t happen until 2020.

                              <span>To celebrate our Bayonetta 3 cover story, we&#x27;re bringing back good old-fashioned Replay to revisit its direct predecessor, Bayonetta 2. You can tune in on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central to join in on the fun, or catch the archive when it hits on our Game Informer Shows YouTube channel. 
Released in October 2014 as a Wii U exclusive, Bayonetta 2 is a sequel that almost didn&#x27;t happen. Despite a strong critical reception to the first game, sales didn&#x27;t meet expectations, leading to publisher Sega passing on a follow-up. Thankfully, Nintendo swooped in to fund and publish Bayonetta 2, locking it in as a third-party exclusive. Bayonetta 2 features improved combat, new features, an even nuttier plot, and a near-bottomless well of action. Join me, Marcus Stewart, as I dig into my personal GOTY for 2014 and chat all about our Bayonetta 3 cover.

                              <span>Mortal Kombat was released three decades ago, in October of 1992, and its gory style of fighting has persisted through the years, through controversies, movies, and more. 
The NetherRealm-developed series celebrates its 30th anniversary this month, and the studio has released a new trailer to highlight the legacy of the franchise and bathe players in nostalgia and hype. If you&#x27;re looking for a special Mortal Kombat announcement, though, keep your expectations in check. Maybe something like that comes at a later date this month – who knows? – but today&#x27;s trailer is all about Mortal Kombat&#x27;s 30-year history in video games and other entertainment mediums. 
Check out the Mortal Kombat 30th Anniversary trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, the video above doesn&#x27;t announce any new movies or games, or even DLC for Mortal Kombat 11, but that&#x27;s okay because it&#x27;s still a great watch nonetheless, especially for longtime fans. 
Here are some fun Mortal Kombat 30th Anniversary logos as well:

Launch into the action quickly with an existing difficulty preset, or tinker with everything from economy to combat challenge to survival difficulty to perfect your experience.&quot;
