One of the more intriguing titles on my (and many others) watchlist is Round8 Studio&#x27;s Lies of P — this gothic retelling of the famous tale of Pinocchio is currently in development for PC and console platforms, and promises a dark-yet-faithful take on the story of the puppet child and his endeavor to become human.
Publisher Neowiz has taken the bold step of releasing a huge gameplay showcase, which features no less than 40+ minutes of Lies of P in action. The video spotlights the opulent but miserable architecture, grim splendor, and frightening oppression of the city of Krat, the backdrop to our young hero&#x27;s quest. Pinocchio must battle violent automatons, engage with what remains of the local community, and harness the power of falsehoods in order to come …</span>

The year in games is closing out with a reunion. Crisis Core -Final Fantasy VII- Reunion, a remaster of the original PSP game, arrives for PC and consoles on December 13, 2022.
Previously set for sometime in the winter season, Square Enix revealed the remaster will arrive just ahead of the new year. Shown off during today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct, Crisis Core looks like it&#x27;s bringing all the action and antics of the original game to bear once more.

The new trailer spotlights not just the combat, though. Many of the characters who show up in Crisis Core -Final Fantasy VII- Reunion are also crucial to the overall FFVII plot. Sephiroth, Cloud, and Aerith are all here, as well as a host of Shinra employees. Heck, even…</span>

                              <span>From September 18 to October 1, 2022
If you want to get in on a shiny Eternatus Pokemon Sword and Shield event, you&#x27;ll have to go to an actual store in the near future.
Following a tease that it would be happening in some regions, information on the distribution event is fully live now on the official Pokemon site.
All the details on the Pokemon shiny Eternatus distribution:
It&#x27;s located at GameStop (in the US and Canada) or EB Games (in Australia and New Zealand)
As per usual you don&#x27;t need to buy anything, and the code will be distributed by way of a card
The event runs from September 18 through October 1
The Eternatus you&#x27;ll get from the event is level 100, with timid nature and the pressure ability (move-wise it sports dynamax cannon, eternabeam, sludge bomb, and flamethrower)
Nintendo also provides re-iterated instructions on mystery gift redemption:
To claim your in-game gift, follow these steps:
Launch your Pokémon Sword or Pokémon Shield
Select Mystery Gift on the X menu.
Select Get a Mystery Gift.
Select Get with Code/Password to save your game and connect to the internet.
Enter your code or password.
Watch as the gift arrives in your game. (Pokémon will appear in your party or your Pokémon Boxes. Items will appear in your Bag.)
Be sure to save your game.
Overall it&#x27;s a pretty simple process: other than going to the store! At least this event is for a shiny legendary, and not a quirky character from the anime.

A classic entry in the Tales series is getting new life on newer consoles. Tales of Symphonia Remastered brings the story of Lloyd, Colette, and company to PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch in early 2023.
Revealed during today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct, Tales of Symphonia Remastered brings the GameCube-era RPG to modern systems. It will get a version on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One, and be playable on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S via their respective versions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;Vl5CZTuMGnw
Tales of Symphonia originally released in 2003 and was brought over to North America in 2004. The remaster will feature both graphical enhancements and improved gameplay, though no details have been given just yet.
Alongside a physical edition, Bandai Namco is also publishing a Chosen Edition of Tales of Symphonia Remastered. This will come with a special metal case, art prints, and stickers. Both editions are up for pre-order on the Bandai Namco store here.

Back to Sylvarant
Tales of Symphonia is a fondly remembered entry in the long-running Tales series. It was likely the introduction to the series for many players, myself included. It&#x27;s definitely a lengthy role-playing game, but it has an incredible cast of characters and a really fantastic story.

Seeing another Tales game get a modern port, much like Tales of Vesperia did a while back, is great. While Tales of Arise laid out a path forward for the series, I&#x27;m excited that newcomers will have an easy way of playing Symphonia too. Honestly, just keep this train rolling and dive back into some older entries while we&#x27;re at it. My fingers are now crossed that Abyss is on a list somewhere at Tales HQ.
Tales of Symphonia Remastered arrives for PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch sometime in early 2023.

Finishing in style, today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct closed out with a brief trailer and a release date for the highly anticipated The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. The exciting follow-up to the widely loved The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild will launch on Nintendo Switch May 12, 2023.
The evocative new trailer, which you can check out below, begins with some traditional wall carvings, instantly recognizable as belonging to the Zelda universe. These solemn images then transition to a short but breathtaking clip, that sees our indelible hero, Link, as he barrels through an ornate pair of double doors and freefalls into the great beyond. We are then presented with some short snippets of world-traversing action before the trailer concludes with its warming new logo and title. Very exciting.

                              <span>A whole bunch of Resident Evil is coming to the Switch
Nintendo Switch owners will get a chance to check out the modern run of Resident Evil, thanks to the cloud. Resident Evil Village arrives October 28, with three more Resident Evil games coming in 2022, all via the cloud.
The first up is Village, which launches on October 28 and will get the upcoming Winters&#x27; Expansion on December 2. A demo is available now, so you can test out how the cloud processing works for your setup.
Winters&#x27; Expansion adds a new third-person option to Resident Evil Village, as well as a new story following Rose Winters and some new Mercenaries content.

Also coming to the Nintendo Switch via cloud are three more Resident Evil games, all hitting this year. The modern remakes of Resident Evil 2 and 3 will come to Nintendo Switch alongside Resident Evil 7, all available through cloud streaming.

Scary clouds on the horizon
Seeing these games come to Nintendo Switch at all is pretty exciting, though the cloud addendum puts a bit of an asterisk on it. These are some pretty hefty games, and it&#x27;s understandable that the Switch alone probably can&#x27;t do all the heavy lifting. It&#x27;s far from the first game to try it out, either.
But these cloud versions have had a history of being pretty spotty, and in some cases don&#x27;t hold up well to comparisons. At the very least, it&#x27;s nice that the demo gives players an option to try the current implementation out, and see if it&#x27;s the way they want to experience Ethan Winters&#x27; Hand-Slammin&#x27; Holiday Adventure.
Resident Evil Village arrives on the Nintendo Switch via cloud on October 28, 2022. The other three Resident Evil entries will hit the Switch via cloud before year&#x27;s end.

                              <span>It&#x27;s called Kirby&#x27;s Return to Dreamland Deluxe
Kirby&#x27;s Return to Dreamland Deluxe is confirmed thanks to a Nintendo Direct! It&#x27;s coming to Switch next year, and will bring back the 2011 Wii game as a re-release.
In this Switch version, Kirby will sport new copy abilities, and there&#x27;s local play for up to four players. Everyone can be Kirby this time, denoted by different colors of Kirby models. A collection of minigames is available, including Magolor&#x27;s Tome Trackers, and Samurai Kirby. Four-player play is confirmed for all minigames.
Nintendo has some further details for us: &quot;The heroic puffball’s Wii game is returning … this time in deluxe proportions! One day, a mysterious spaceship crash-lands on Planet Popstar. To help the mysterious Magolor, Kirby and his friends set off on a captivating quest. When inhaling certain enemies, Kirby will gain access to a wide range of Copy Abilities – with the new Mecha Copy Ability making its debut! The game supports multiplayer for up to four players on the same system by sharing Joy-Con controllers. Plus, everyone can play as Kirby at the same time while using their favorite Copy Abilities! There’s also a collection of subgames to play, including returning ones like Samurai Kirby and new ones like Magolor’s Tome Trackers.&quot;
It&#x27;s out on February 24, 2023, and really, I can&#x27;t wait! The original was fantastic as a good clean Kirby game, and it&#x27;s about time my wife and I fully replayed it.

                              <span>We didn&#x27;t get any gameplay today
Just what we all wanted! Nintendo legend Shigeru Miyamoto himself appeared on this morning&#x27;s Nintendo Direct to confirm that Pikmin 4 would be out in 2023. No more aimless waiting!
Miyamoto said that although we weren&#x27;t getting any gameplay today, we did get a single screenshot. According to Miyamoto, the gameplay is &quot;simpler&quot; this time around, with a focus on &quot;dandori;&quot; or &quot;strategically deploying and commanding the Pikmin.&quot;
It&#x27;s been a while since Pikmin 3, that&#x27;s for sure! This is all Nintendo had to say on the matter outside of the stream: &quot;The first sneak peek at the next game in the Pikmin franchise revealed a tranquil park and a napping Bulborb, but it was still missing one important element … Pikmin! Where could they be? More details about this new title for Nintendo Switch will be revealed ahead of its 2023 launch.&quot;
So there you have it: a coy confirmation that we&#x27;ll get some sort of proper update on Pikmin 4 before it comes out. Though, the lack of gameplay today (as well as the lack of date announcements before May 2023) likely ensures that this will be a mid-to-late 2023 game. Again, all we have right now is &quot;2023.&quot;

                              <span>We&#x27;ve been expecting you, Mr. Bond
During today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct presentation, the publisher revealed that one of the most popular Nintendo 64 titles of all time, Rare&#x27;s GoldenEye 007, will be heading to the Nintendo Switch Online service at some point in the near future. Rare would also announce that the same release will be made available on Xbox platforms via the Xbox Game Pass service.
Many had wondered whether the 1998 classic would ever show its face on the Switch, or any modern gaming service, given its tangled mess of licensing deals. It seems, however, that Rare, Nintendo, and Xbox have managed to cross the i&#x27;s and dotted the t&#x27;s, and the multiplayer classic will soon be available to Nintendo Switch Online subscribers and Xbox platforms. Online multiplayer has been confirmed for the Switch release, but the Xbox Game Pass version may be local only.
GoldenEye 007 is &quot;coming soon&quot; to Nintendo Switch Online and Xbox Game Pass.
You can check out the full range of upcoming Nintendo Switch Online titles in the video below

Other upcoming N64 games include Mario Party, Mario Party 2, and Pilotwings 64 in 2022. And next year, Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscribers are also getting 1080 Snowboarding, Excitebike 64, Mario Party 3, Pokémon Stadium, and Pokémon Stadium 2.

                              <span>Nintendo has delayed it a bit
The Nintendo Switch Sports golf update has been delayed, according to Nintendo via their Nintendo Direct stream this morning. As a reminder, golf was touted as a free addition to the game shortly after launch, but now it&#x27;ll arrive &quot;this holiday.&quot;
We did get a detail though! Eight players can play online in the same course at the same time — and folks can get kicked out. You can also &quot;hit the fairway across 21 holes from the Wii Sports series.&quot;
So far, the post-launch support for Nintendo Switch Sports has been fairly low-key, as it came with a lot of features at launch to begin with. There&#x27;s still a wishlist from fans to be sure (including more long-term rewards), but Golf should nicely round out the long-term impact of the game.
The big July update pretty much took care of a lot of those aforementioned wishlist items, including the shoring up of soccer (which thankfully now has full, rather than partial, leg strap support), and a general cleanup in terms of the overarching control scheme. Online play was also tweaked, including an indicator that informs players if someone has a weak connection.

The multi-pathed story of Octopath Traveler is back with eight new adventurers and their stories. Octopath Traveler 2 sets out with new heroes and quests on February 24, 2023.
Eight new travelers will feature in this game, and their specific paths will change depending on whether it&#x27;s day or night. Their stories will once again intertwine, and of course see all of them uniting to take on evil.

The Warrior, the Dancer, the Merchant, the Scholar, the Thief, the Cleric, the Hunter, and the Apothecary will set out on journeys in a bustling new era.

Well, now we know what that Final Fantasy Theatrhythm Final Bar Line trademark was all about earlier this year!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;1ODX-GwpBHU
Thanks to today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct, we know it&#x27;s a new entry coming to Switch, and it&#x27;ll sport two-player local play, along with online support. A few of the songs confirmed in the trailer for Final Fantasy Theatrhythm Final Bar Line are:
One Winged Angel
Torn from the Heavens
Suteki Da Ne
Final Fantasy Theatrhythm Final Bar Line is out on February 16, 2023. Oh, and paid DLC from the NieR, Saga, Live a Live, and Octopath Traveler franchises are confirmed. You can get a look at everything included in the digital deluxe and premium digital deluxe editions below. It&#x27;s uh, a lot! And these editions are extremely Square Enix.
I don&#x27;t know if anyone else in the west has fond memories of this series, but I certainly do. I even imported a copy of Theatrhythm Dragon Quest on 3DS just to play it in 2015, as it was never released in the west. Really, as long as the tracklist is handled properly (read: and a ton of key songs that deal with the game in question aren&#x27;t gated behind DLC or some bonus of some kind), Square Enix can just keep making these. Hopefully this one turns out alright come February.

                              <span>What is a marooned Inkling to do?
During today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct, the publisher announced the first splatfest for its brand new release Splatoon 3. As per usual, players will be asked to choose their teams and then battle it out to decide the winning answer to a fun question, with points decided by public vote and in-game action.
The first splatfest for Splatoon 3 is a question of desert island activities, and asks what you would bring to a desert island, should you ever find yourself marooned. The choices are Gear, Grub, or Fun. Honestly, that&#x27;s pretty darn bizarre. Only one of them will keep you alive... unless you Eat Fun.
Regardless, the first splatfest will take place on the weekend of September 23 and, as usual, will run from Friday through Saturday in North America. It is to be assumed that the European edition will run Saturday through, as was the case of Splatoon 2.
Splatoon 3 is available now on Nintendo Switch.

                              <span>A trio of Front Mission Remake projects are coming to Switch
Nintendo gave us the rundown on the trio of Front Mission Remake titles today during this morning&#x27;s Nintendo Direct. Wait, three? Yep!
The initial remake (titled Front Mission 1st: Remake) is out in November (originally slated for &quot;summer&quot; of 2022), with the sequel coming &quot;next year.&quot; These were already announced. However, there&#x27;s also a Front Mission 3 project announced &quot;for the future.&quot;
Here&#x27;s a recap of what to expect from Nintendo: &quot;You’ll pilot giant machines called Wanzers in tactical turn-based combat. As you progress, you’ll obtain Skills that can help you gain the upper hand against opponents. Continue the battle in the sequel, Front Mission 2: Remake, previously unreleased outside of Japan! Take advantage of additional features, like more terrain effects, weapon and armor attributes, and over 80 new skills. You can also test your mettle at the Colosseum and use the Network system to gain intel on events as they unfold.&quot;
There&#x27;s no shortage of strategy games available on the Switch, whether it&#x27;s restored classics or brand-new projects. The third game, however, is really the one I&#x27;m waiting for. It&#x27;s one of my all-time favorite strategy games, and that box art is burned in my mind. I mean, it&#x27;s just a mech and a brown color scheme! But it stuck with me.

During today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct presentation, Koei Tecmo announced that a remaster of 2008 Wii horror title Fatal Frame: Mask of the Lunar Eclipse is coming to Nintendo Switch — alongside PlayStation, Xbox, and PC ports — in early 2023.
This release will see the title, the fourth installment in the Fatal Frame franchise, receive its first official western release and once again sees a luckless hero traipse through a terrifying haunted house and battle an army of ghosts and demons, armed with the mythical Camera Obscura.
This remaster includes &quot;an all-new Photo Mode, along with new and altered costumes, and enhanced graphics including the improved rendering of shadows and light,&quot; according to Koei Tecmo. &quot;In addition, in-game movies and character models have been brushed-up to deliver a story that shines, both narratively and aesthetically as the three remaining girls attempt to rediscover their past before becoming victims once again.&quot;
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;XwxRTmO_lrY
Fatal Frame: Mask of the Lunar Eclipse will launch on Nintendo Switch as well as PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (Steam) in early 2023.
The game has been one of Koei Tecmo&#x27;s &quot;most requested remasters for over a decade.&quot;

                              <span>The next Fire Emblem isn&#x27;t that far off
Nintendo is known for kicking off their Nintendo Directs with style, and announcing Fire Emblem Engage is no exception.
Shown off with a brand new very detailed accompanying trailer, we get a sense of the dragon-based conflict within this game world, as well as some gameplay to boot. Here&#x27;s the full description of what to expect:
&quot;In a war against the Fell Dragon, four kingdoms worked together with heroes from other worlds to seal away this great evil. One thousand years later, this seal has weakened and the Fell Dragon is about to reawaken. As a Divine Dragon, use rich strategies and robust customization to meet your destiny – to collect Emblem Rings scattered across the world and bring peace back to the Continent of Elyos. Summon and fight alongside legendary heroes from past Fire Emblem games, like Marth and Celica, and add their power to yours in this new story. The turn-based, tactical battle system the Fire Emblem series is known for returns with a fresh cast of characters you can customize and Engage with to carefully craft your strategy.&quot;

Ha! That bit about summoning prior heroes is such a great way to pack in some nostalgia, and sell the game in a variety of ways with all sorts of key art from classic characters. It&#x27;s out on January 20, 2023. As a reminder, it&#x27;s been three years since Fire Emblem: Three Houses.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;3ExaJIB5Phk
Nintendo also announced a Fire Emblem Engage Divine Edition
The special edition for the game will include the actual game itself, a steelbook, art cards, and an art book.

                              <span>Which is &quot;mostly focused on games launching this winter,&quot; with a surprise perhaps?
It&#x27;s time for a Nintendo Direct watch post, can you believe it?!
No, it&#x27;s not a &quot;Pokemon Presents&quot; or some other form of Direct-adjacent stream, it&#x27;s a full &quot;Nintendo Direct,&quot; period, that&#x27;s 40 minutes long. As a reminder, here&#x27;s what Nintendo is giving us in terms of the details of the Direct:
“Tune in at 7 a.m. PT on Tuesday, Sept. 13, for a Nintendo Direct livestream featuring roughly 40 minutes of information mainly focused on Nintendo Switch games launching this winter.”

That&#x27;s 10AM ET!
What could Nintendo show us today?
We gave our thoughts yesterday on what we could see, but as a recap, Bayonetta 3, Pokemon Scarlet and Violet and potentially Advance Wars are all games that are launching, or in the latter case, could launch by the end of the year from Nintendo itself. Of course there&#x27;s other stuff slated for Switch from third parties, and there should be at least one or two surprises baked in.
&quot;Mostly focused&quot; implies that we could see updates for games beyond &quot;this winter.&quot; We haven&#x27;t had a real update on Metroid Prime 4 for a while, and of course there&#x27;s the elephant in the room of Zelda: Breath of the Wild 2. And Nintendo could give us at least one massive tease that&#x27;s years off, just like it teased Bayonetta 3 a long, long while back.
In any case, you can watch the Direct below and comment along with the community!

Square Enix and PlatinumGames have officially announced that their ambitious RPG Babylon&#x27;s Fall is to end service in 2023, a scant year after the live service adventure&#x27;s launch.
In a statement on the official website, the development team says that it will close servers on February 28, 2023, after which, the game will be rendered unavailable to play on all platforms and all online data and player records will be erased. Further sales of the title and any of its post-release content have been officially halted as of the statement&#x27;s publication.
&quot;With the desire of delivering an exhilarating online multiplayer action RPG set in an elaborate high fantasy world, we launched the game’s official service on Thursday, 3 March 2022, and have contin…</span>

Retro Fighters is coming out with a new version of the Brawler64, a modernized N64-inspired controller, and it should pair well with the Switch Online library thanks to its button placement. The Brawler64 Wireless Bluetooth Switch Edition is compatible with Nintendo Switch and PC and it&#x27;s currently drumming up support on Kickstarter.
That said, the crowdfunding campaign has 20 days left to go and the funding threshold has already been crossed with $12,000 pledged. It&#x27;s happening. Backers will get their orders shipped before retail customers, with an ETA of February 2023.
There are three colors — Classic Gray, Transparent Blue, and Arctic White — and the Brawler64 Switch Edition is tied to $45 pledges, …</span>

Do you wish more games followed in the footsteps of Monster Hunter, especially after big-budget hits like Monster Hunter: World and Iceborne? While Capcom has been on fire, there&#x27;s room for more, and EA of all companies is making a move with Omega Force.
Electronic Arts announced its partnership with Koei Tecmo for an Omega Force-developed hunting action game that&#x27;s set in &quot;fantasy feudal Japan.&quot; According to the companies, they are aiming to deliver &quot;the next great hunting game&quot; with this &quot;AAA&quot;-budget original IP.

                              <span>Bah gawd, that&#x27;s the PlayStation boot music
Sony is joining the list of publishers rolling out a showcase this week. A new State of Play is set to air tomorrow, September 13, with updates on all things PlayStation.
Announced just 24 hours ahead of its air time, the Sony State of Play will go live at 6 p.m. ET / 3 p.m. PT on Sony&#x27;s Twitch and YouTube channels.
In its announcement, Sony notes that the Tokyo Game Show is just around the corner. For the State of Play, Sony says to expect some updates from its Japanese partners, along with a &quot;few other surprises&quot; from developers around the world.
The show is expected to come in at about 20 minutes of reveals, new updates, and gameplay for 10 games. Platform-wise, Sony identifies the PlayStation 5, PS4, and PlayStation VR 2.

The week to come in showcase streams
This puts Sony at the opposite end of tomorrow&#x27;s news cycle from Nintendo, which is hosting its September Nintendo Direct at 7 a.m. PT / 10 a.m. ET.
In the week ahead, several more publishers and developers are planning streams for the Tokyo Game Show 2022. Square Enix, Capcom, Konami, Bandai Namco, and more will all host streams throughout the week.
As for what Sony still has to show, there are several games in its own studio pipeline. God of War Ragnarok is currently aiming for its launch in November, while other projects like Insomniac&#x27;s Marvel games are further down the line.
Japanese partners could cover a broad swath as well. Square Enix has made several State of Play appearances, as has Capcom. With just about 20 minutes set for this Sony State of Play, across 10, it will probably be a pretty fast and to-the-point show.
We&#x27;ll see what Sony has in store for its September State of Play tomorrow, at 6:00 p.m. ET.

A bunch of players have been diving into Splatoon 3 this weekend, grinding for new levels, gear, and abilities. But make sure that you have the SplatNet 3 app handy, and you can access a bunch of extra goodies.
SplatNet is the Nintendo Switch Online companion app for Splatoon. For Splatoon 3 it&#x27;s SplatNet 3, and you can access it easily by just downloading the Nintendo Switch Online app and linking your account.
While a separate app might seem a little annoying, it&#x27;s a little extra work that opens up a ton of extra offers and goods.
SplatNet QR Codes
For one, the SplatNet 3 app can scan QR codes that unlock additional content. The Splatoon 3 team has already published one, which will give you a new banner for customizing your Splashtag…</span>

Well, that was one heck of a Nintendo Direct, wasn&#x27;t it? While it perhaps wasn&#x27;t the massive Zelda blowout we were all expecting, Nintendo had no shortage of first-party reveals and exclusives, amidst some big Indies and multiplatform releases.
Let&#x27;s start with the biggie, then — Breath of the Wild 2 sheds its number for a brand-new name: The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.

Today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct Showcase was full of release dates that either felt very close or very far away. None more so was this the case with news that the classic arcade shoot &#x27;em up Radiant Silvergun, from acclaimed Japanese developer Treasure, would be coming to Switch. What&#x27;s more, it&#x27;s landing on the console today!
A classic in its genre, Radiant Silvergun will provide you with five different weapons to take down a constant onslaught of enemies in ships of varyingly ridiculous sizes. The game comes in a retro pixelated look, wearing its arcade and Sega Saturn heritage on its sleeve.

Get working on your martial arts moves, as the Kung Fu action brawler Sifu is coming to Nintendo Switch on November 8th.
The Direct Showcase revealed a small trailer of the game (above), demonstrating the appealing hand-to-hand combat in all its crunchy action. Sifu will see you taking on hoards of opponents as you attempt to avenge your father, and looking at the trailer, it seems that this Switch port will not lose too much of the kinetic energy that the game holds on PlayStation. Which would be lovely, as our friends over at Push Square awarded it 8/10 and called it &quot;brutal but brilliant&quot;.

Hazellight Studios&#x27; Game of the Year winner at the 2021 Game Awards, It Takes Two, is making the jump to Switch on 4th November. This was one of the many announcements that was heavily rumoured by multiple people last week, but it&#x27;s fantastic to see this acclaimed title finally hop over to the hybrid console.
This platforming adventure game sees a married couple, who are on the brink of divorce, get turned into dolls by their daughter. Rose then play-acts with the two dolls in an attempt to fix her parent&#x27;s relationship. The game is a co-op experience designed to be played split-screen with a partner — or friend, or whoever you want (or online, even!). The game&#x27;s multiple levels are inspired by different genres and each one requires you to co-operate with your partner in order to progress.

The Nintendo Direct Showcase has just confirmed that the next Splatoon 3 Splatfest is coming 23rd September 5pm PT/1am BST - 25th September 5pm PT/1am BST.

During today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct Showcase, Capcom revealed that several Resident Evil games will be coming to the Switch. These include Resident Evil: Village, Resident Evil: Biohazard (7), Resident Evil 2, and Resident Evil 3.
The catch, of course, is that all games will be available as Cloud Versions, which isn&#x27;t ideal, but we&#x27;ll take what we can get.

It feels like Wave 2 for Mario Kart 8 Deluxe&#x27;s DLC pass only just launched, but we&#x27;re already looking ahead to Wave 3. Nintendo confirmed during its September Direct that eight more courses will be arriving at the start line this Holiday season. That makes it the perfect family game to fall out over before the celebrations, then!
The brief trailer showed us two of the upcoming eight tracks that we&#x27;ll be burning rubber on in the near future — Merry Mountain from Mario Kart Tour and Peach Gardens from Mario Kart DS! Merry Mountain is the perfect Christmas course, which will put a smile on our face, while Peach Gardens is a returning favourite.

The new trailer (above) doesn&#x27;t give much away in terms of new gameplay, focusing on some stone wall art in the opening section before following Link as he leaps into the sky and onto a stone bird-looking flying creature.

                              <span>Today, publisher Square Enix and developer Platinum Games finally did what everyone had been predicting from the start: they announced Babylon’s Fall will shut down within its first year. While I’m hardly surprised, it still sucks. People paid $60 for this game just six months ago, and less than six months from now it…

                              <span>I only just realised, while mentioning the dev&#x27;s next game, that we never posted about excellent indie horror game Mothered. Not to be confused with the unrelated Remothered games, it&#x27;s the tale of a young girl returning home after surgery to find everything is weird and her mother is some sort of eerie mannequin. It might be my favourite horror game of 2021? Now&#x27;s a good time to raise Mothered because: 1) it finally has a demo for newcomers; 2) for veterans, that demo actually hides a secret expansion continuing the game&#x27;s story.

                              <span>Troubled live-service action RPG Babylon’s Fall will close its doors on February 28th 2023, Square Enix and developers Platinum Games have revealed today. The game had struggled to make an impact since its launch on March 3rd earlier this year, with concurrent player counts dropping to zero at times. It hadn&#x27;t looked good from the early days when, as we pointed out, Platinum Games were tweeting statements that Babylon’s Fall’s wasn’t &quot;in danger&quot; just two weeks following its launch.

Set in Japan during its feudal period but with a fantasy twist, EA and Koei Tecmo describe the as-yet-untitled project as “the next great hunting game”. Dispel those mental images of theHunter: Call Of The Wild and Big Buck Hunter though, because it sounds like this is more in the vein of hack-and-slash monster hunting shenanigans.

Unlike the mere low-res images of abandoned Steam Deck designs we’ve already seen, however, these were mostly functional PC gaming machines. That’s according to Valve engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais, who shared a video of an early, more rounded-looking Deck booting to SteamOS and loading up Half-Life 2.

                              <span>Correctly striking a succession of notes in a rhythm game gives me a huge high, but I&#x27;m more familiar with feeling the corresponding low. A succession of missed notes whizzing past sounds like an ode to my failure, and in mashups that mix demanding rhythms with another genre - like Crypt Of The Necrodancer, say - these reminders of my musical inadequacy often drown out even the simplest pleasures. 

Often but not always. Metal: Hellsinger&#x27;s mix of rhythm game and Doom 2016-style shooter kept me tapping my foot as I battled through hell - even as I failed regularly, and even as someone who doesn&#x27;t care for metal music.

                              <span>As one of the most influential and beloved shooters of all time, GoldenEye 007 is a special game for many who played it in the late &#x27;90s. However, it&#x27;s been a long time since the game has been playable on modern consoles. That changes soon, as the revolutionary first-person shooter received a duo of announcements today. First, we learned about a Switch version as part of the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack N64 catalog. However, we also learned the title (which was developed by now-Microsoft-owned Rare), is also coming to Xbox as a part of Game Pass and Rare Replay.
When the game arrives on Xbox, it will include the classic campaign, complete with the original difficulty settings and cheat codes (no word on if &quot;DK Mode&quot; will be renamed to something more generic like &quot;Big Head Mode&quot; for the Xbox version). The Xbox version will also include the split-screen local competitive multiplayer mode that made the game such a mainstay for get-togethers in the N64 era.


Unfortunately, it does not appear as though the online multiplayer available in the Nintendo Switch Online version will make the jump to the Xbox version. However, the Xbox version of GoldenEye 007 does include improved control options (including dual analog stick support), native 16:9 resolution up to 4K Ultra HD, a consistent refresh rate, and full achievement support. 
GoldenEye 007 is coming to Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One as part of Game Pass. Everyone who already owns Rare Replay will also be able to download the game at no additional cost. We don&#x27;t know exactly when GoldenEye 007 arrives on Xbox, but according to Rare, the game will land simultaneously on Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch Online.</span>

                              <span>I never thought I would write these words: I&#x27;m leaving Game Informer.
For nearly 30 years, I looked forward to each workday, eager to see what game news would break, what I would be writing about, and on the best days, what I would be playing. In the time it took to create 330 monthly magazines, I was privileged to work alongside some of the most talented and amazing people I&#x27;ve ever met. For a kid who couldn’t get enough of video games growing up, I was living a dream. I knew how lucky I was and never took it for granted. I worked hard. I wanted Game Informer to be the place to go to celebrate games. I think we accomplished that tenfold and have created an outlet unlike any other.
In the weeks ahead, I’ll transition from writing game news to creating it. I’m entering the world of game dev…</span>

                              <span>We&#x27;re rapidly approaching the midway point for Mario Kart 8 Deluxe&#x27;s Booster Course Pass content. With two of the six promised waves of new courses already out, Nintendo has begun teasing what players can expect with the third wave, which is due out this holiday season. During today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct, we learned the first two courses coming in the third eight-course wave of new tracks.
Fittingly, the first course we learned about for Wave 3 of the Booster Course Pass is Merry Mountain. This holiday-themed track first made its debut in Mario Kart Tour in 2020 as part of the Winter Tour. Meanwhile, for those looking for something not holiday-themed, Nintendo is also bringing Peach Gardens, a track that first appeared in Mario Kart DS in 2005.
Wave 1 brought fan favorites like Coconut Mall (Wii), Choco Mountain (N64), and Sky Garden (GBA), while Wave 2 gave us access to tracks like Kalimari Desert (N64), Mario Circuit 3 (SNES), and Mushroom Gorge (Wii). Each wave has also given us two tracks from Mario Kart Tour, with Wave 2 also including an all-new course in Sky-High Sundae. 
Mario Kart 8 Deluxe – Booster Course Pass Wave 3 is scheduled to arrive this holiday season.</span>

                              <span>In the lead-up to Nintendo Switch Sports, Nintendo promised two major free updates following the launch. The first free update, which came out earlier this summer, added the ability to use the leg strap accessory for entire soccer matches instead of just shootouts. The second, more anticipated free update is set to add a new playable sport to the package: golf. Originally set for release this fall, Nintendo today announced a small delay to the update, saying it now arrives this holiday season.
The Nintendo Switch Sports version of golf lets you tee up across 21 holes carried over from the Wii Sports series. You can play locally with other players or hit the links with up to eight players online in the new Survival Golf mode. In Survival Golf, whoever takes the most strokes each round is eliminated.
This free update to Nintendo Switch Sports arrives this holiday season. For more about Nintendo Switch Sports, you can check out our full review here.</span>

In The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, players can explore the surface of the version of Hyrule they traveled across in Breath of the Wild as well as various floating islands in the sky. In the new trailer, we see Link go from the sky to the surface, then from the surface to the sky.
There&#x27;s still so much we don&#x27;t know about Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, but in addition to the official name, we also now have a release date. The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingom arrives exclusively on Nintendo Switch on May 12, 2023.</span>

                              <span>Dauntless developer Phoneix Labs has announced a new title that, needless to say, is dramatically different than its monster-slaying RPG. Fae Farm is a cozy life simulation that whisks players to a world of magic and wonder where you&#x27;ll flex your green thumb as a farming savior. 


As the name suggests, the bulk of the experience involves running a farm as an adventurer and newcomer to a community in the land of Azoria. Though you’ll work to bring peace to this troubled land, you’ll also kick back and leisurely explore various environments, collect resources, and build homesteads. Fae Farm is built with cooperation in mind. The title features drop-in/drop-out co-op, both locally and online, allowing players to farm and quest together. 
“With Fae Farm we wanted to take our favorite elements of the sim genres we love, infuse them with magic and beautiful art, and wrap everything in a light-hearted cooperative experience,” said creative director Katie De Sousa in a press release. “I can’t wait to see what kind of cozy homesteads players build in Azoria.”
Fae Farm is slated to release during Q2 2023 exclusively for Switch.</span>

                              <span>Today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct was loaded with surprises, including an enhanced port of the 2011 Wii game, Kirby&#x27;s Return to Dream Land. On this colorful adventure, Kirby uses a variety of copy abilities to solve puzzles and platforming challenges. These abilities, like a sword and whip, can also be used for combat encounters. This updated version of the game also includes a new Mecha ability, which adds long-range rockets, a close-range dash, and a mighty blast to the arsenal.
Up to four people can play cooperatively using Joy-Cons on the same system. Multiplayer is also available in the expanded minigame collection, giving players a new challenge called Magolor&#x27;s Tome Trackers.
Kirby&#x27;s Return to Dream Land Deluxe launches exclusively on Switch on February 24, 2023. Preorders begin today.</span>

                              <span>Capcom is bringing its best horror games to Nintendo Switch later this year via the handheld&#x27;s cloud gaming capabilities. Resident Evil Village, Resident Evil 7: Biohazard and the recent remakes of Resident Evil 2 and 3 will all be available on the eShop before the end of 2022. While we don&#x27;t know every game&#x27;s exact release date, Capcom announced that Resident Evil Village Cloud is launching on October 28. Additionally, a free demo of Village will be available later today on the Switch eShop if you&#x27;d like to test the quality of the cloud version yourself. 
This release coincides with the global launch of the Resident Evil Village Winter&#x27;s Expansion, which introduces new story content surrounding the protagonist&#x27;s daughter, which is also arriving on October 28. However, the expansion won&#x27;t be available to play on the Nintendo Switch cloud until December 2.</span>

                              <span>I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m writing this: Pikmin 4 is real, and it&#x27;s out next year. 
Let&#x27;s get right to it – check out the official Pikmin 4 announcement trailer below: 


Here&#x27;s what Nintendo had to say about Pikmin 4 in a press release following today&#x27;s reveal: 
Pikmin franchise revealed a tranquil park and a napping Bulborb, but it was still missing one important element … Pikmin! Where could they be? More details about this new title for Nintendo Switch will be revealed ahead of its 2023 launch.&quot;

Pikmin is a very special franchise to many people, but despite its niche popularity, it&#x27;s never quite reached the heights of other Nintendo franchises. In total, the franchise has sold more than 8 million copies. Pikmin 3 Deluxe on Switch proved the franchise still had some (fruit) juice in it by selling roughly 2 million units in less than a year – a quarter of the series&#x27; entire sales – and fans speculated this had proved to Nintendo that it was time for a proper sequel. 
Pikmin 4 was mentioned by series creator Shigeru Miyamoto back in 2015 when he told Eurogamer that it was in development and &quot;very close to completion.&quot; Time passed and then Hey! Pikmin, a 2D Pikmin spinoff, was announced and then released in July of 2017. Some speculated that this was the Pikmin 4 Miyamoto was referring to back in 2015 but in June of that year, Miyamoto told Eurogamer that &quot;it is progressing,&quot; seemingly confirming that he did not view Hey! Pikmin as the fourth sequel. Unfortunately, that was the last Nintendo or anyone there referred to Pikmin 4...until today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct!

Nintendo showcased a short and sweet teaser trailer that gave us more of the luscious world of Pikmin before flashing to a title screen that revealed Pikmin 4 is coming to Switch next year. As for exactly when, that remains unknown  – Nintendo simply stated 2023. But hey, that&#x27;s better than wondering when, if ever, Pikmin 4 would actually come out!

                              <span>Square Enix has announced Theatrhythm Final Bar Line, the next entry in the Final Fantasy rhythm series. This first console entry in the series includes modernized visuals for the backgrounds and nearly 400 songs included in the base game.
The soundtrack includes favorites like &quot;One Winged Angel,&quot; &quot;Torn from the Heavens,&quot; &quot;Suteki Da Ne,&quot; and plenty more. With 385 songs included in the base game, Square Enix understands it might be difficult to sort through them all, so it included a way to sort by game. The game can be enjoyed by two players locally or four players online.


Theatrhythm Final Bar Line comes to PlayStation 4 and Switch on February 16. Square Enix also announced that players can look forward to paid DLC from the Saga, Nier, Octopath Traveler, and Live A Live series for a total of 90 additional songs. There&#x27;s also a Season Pass which will add 27 extra songs.</span>

More specifically, the first post-launch Splatfest will begin at 5 p.m. PT/8 p.m. ET, on Sept. 23 and end at 5 p.m. PT/8 p.m. ET on Sept. 25. As for what we&#x27;ll be fighting for, you can choose to be on team Gear, Grub, of Fun (in regards to what you&#x27;d bring with you to a deserted island). It should be a great time if the pre-launch Splatfest held recently is any indication.
Check out the Splatfest trailer for yourself below: 


The trailer above also reveals that some additional Splatoon 3 updates are on the way, too, although it stopped short of telling us exactly what to expect.

                              <span>On November 4, Hazelight and Electronic Arts&#x27; It Takes Two launches on Switch. This heartwarming adventure originally released in 2021 on PC and PlayStation and Xbox consoles. It received a 9.25 out of 10 review from Game Informer and also won The Game Awards&#x27; 2021&#x27;s Game of the Year honors.
It Takes Two can only be played cooperatively and can either be played on a single Switch via splitscreen or on two Switches via local wireless or online via the free friend&#x27;s pass.
In my review of the Xbox One version, I said &quot;It Takes Two may not be the platforming juggernaut that it aspires to be, but it more than makes up for it with its big heart, wealth in variety, and gorgeous imagery. All of its individual actions are things we’ve done in other games, but when applied to this distinct cooperative approach, they take on a whole new life and are used in wonderful ways over a long adventure. The action will have you laughing and screaming at your TV, and the story stays strong throughout, creating the backbone for an entertaining adventure that roars with excitement and should keep you glued to the controller to see if this couple’s lost love can be rekindled.&quot;
Preoders for the Switch version begin today.</span>

You can check out the reveal trailer below:


As you can see, Octopath Traveler II is looking great, as expected. Rather than picking up with our previous heroes, this sequel presents us with eight new travelers: the warrior Hikari, the dancer Agnea, the merchant Partitio, the scholar Osvald, the thief Throné, the cleric Temenos, t…</span>

                              <span>Cyberpunk 2077 is having a bit of a resurgence at the moment. CD Projekt Red&#x27;s 2077 anime, Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, developed by Studio Trigger and Netflix is out (as of today!) and the Phantom Liberty expansion for the game is due out next year. While Phantom Liberty has been confirmed to be 2077&#x27;s first and only expansion, it seems CDPR is not yet ready to part with this world. 
During the CD Projekt Group H1 2022 earnings call, CDPR&#x27;s vice president of business development Michał Nowakowski said the studio is committed to doing more with this IP, as reported by IGN. 


&quot;We decided to develop one major expansion for Cyberpunk, which is going to take advantage of all the capabilities of the new-gen consoles,&quot; Nowakowski said during the call. &quot;Having said that, we&#x27;re totally, fully committed to developing the Cyberpunk IP further, beyond this particular Cyberpunk expansion. We&#x27;ve put a lot of effort and time into building this franchise and we definitely want to continue to build upon what was built right now – with new stories, new experiences, new content, basically. Not just the video game format...in terms of expansions, there&#x27;s just going to be one major expansion. However, there&#x27;s going to be new stuff in the future.&quot; 
As for what exactly, only time will tell but considering a Cyberpunk 2077 anime is already out, perhaps the studio is looking to dive more into the entertainment medium with this IP. As IGN notes, there&#x27;s also The Molasses Flood, a Boston-based studio that CDPR acquired earlier this year, which is working on an existing CDPR IP. This could be something related to The Witcher, of course, but perhaps it&#x27;s something related to 2077. 
In the meantime, read about why now is the right time to play Cyberpunk 2077 and then read about what to expect in next year&#x27;s Phantom Liberty expansion.

                              <span>Developer Platinum Games and publisher Square Enix have revealed that Babylon&#x27;s Fall will shut down next year, less than a full year after its March 3 launch this year. 
More specifically, Platinum Games will terminate the game&#x27;s service on February 27, 2023. As for why, the team didn&#x27;t really outline the reason but it&#x27;s likely due to the game&#x27;s poorly received launch and its lack of players since then. Square Enix tried to remedy the game&#x27;s issues by sending players a survey asking them how the team can improve the game and shortly after, Platinum Games said it has &quot;no plans to reduce the scale of development on Babylon&#x27;s Fall.&quot; It seems things have changed because Babylon&#x27;s Fall will fall early next year.

                              <span>Hot on the heels of the announcement of a long-awaited Nintendo Direct, PlayStation announced that tomorrow will also feature a special livestreamed presentation of its own. Now, in addition to that aforementioned Nintendo Direct tomorrow morning, we&#x27;re now also receiving a PlayStation State of Play stream in the afternoon.
The news comes as Tokyo Game Show looms, giving publishers a massive convention to piggyback off of. According to PlayStation, tomorrow&#x27;s show will feature updates from some of the company&#x27;s Japanese partners, as well as surprises from developers all around the world. Tomorrow&#x27;s presentation is set to last approximately 20 minutes and will feature new updates and gameplay footage from 10 games across PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation VR2.
This PlayStation State of Play stream is set for tomorrow, September 13 at 3 p.m. Pacific/6 p.m. Eastern. You can watch it live on PlayStation&#x27;s Twitch and YouTube channels. Of course, if you miss the show, we&#x27;ll have all the biggest announcements covered right here on Game Informer.</span>

You can count on FromSoftware to deliver memorable music, and if you&#x27;re in an Elden Ring mood but aren&#x27;t quite ready to commit to (yet another?) playthrough right now, you can at least soak up the vibes while going about your day-to-day. The Elden Ring soundtrack is now streaming on Spotify, YouTube Music, Amazon Music, Apple Music, and other platforms — here&#x27;s a handy catch-all link — and at 67 songs, it&#x27;s a big collection.

It&#x27;s the obvious pick, but thinking back, I can&#x27;t shake the game&#x27;s main theme. Ahead of a long journey, it felt so empowering and ominous. Every time I would start up the game, I&#x27;d just hover there on the menu, waiting for the music to hype me back up before continuing.

                              <span>A space adventure for day traders
Mass Effect is one of those series that we&#x27;ve played so many times, sometimes it can be fun to load up a mod for the sake of switching things up a bit. You could always go for the expanded armory or expanded galaxy, or even try the Take Back Earth mod if you really want to make it interesting. Of course, I&#x27;m sure there are some crypto bros out there who are also Mass Effect fans, or at the very least, some people who want to try to game a stock market in a low-stakes environment. Or maybe they just hate the probing mini-game. Who&#x27;s to say?
Either way, this Mass Effect Legendary Edition mod might be for you. It&#x27;s called Nos Astra Mineral Exchange (created by beccatoria and Team Pyjak), and adds a whole galactic stock market to Mass Effect 2, which allows players to trade money and resources. (Thanks, PC Gamer.) Basically, you can either trade minerals and mine them, or just forgo the probing altogether.

There are also new missions attached to the mod as well, which include new voice lines for existing characters with AI dialogue tool xVASynth thanks to the work of modder Gaige Barker.
To gain access to the newly available stock market, players will first need to head to the Crescent Nebula, then to the Asari world of Illium, then to the capital city of Nos Astra, and then finally to the docks entrance where public trading terminals can be found. There&#x27;s also a terminal on the Shadow Broker&#x27;s ship, if that&#x27;s more convenient.
The mod&#x27;s site even details the Mass Effect 2 stock market&#x27;s exchange rate, which is the kind of thing I don&#x27;t really get, but go nuts if you&#x27;re into that sort of thing. Nos Astra Mineral Exchange is available to download on NexusMods or Mod DB — just make sure you have the ME3 Tweaks Mod Manager ready to go first.

Retro-loving publisher City Connection has announced that it is to publish a newly developed remake of obscure arcade release Psychic 5. As reported by Gematsu, Psychic 5 Eternal is currently in development for Nintendo Switch and will be playable during this week&#x27;s Tokyo Game Show festivities.
Originally developed by NMK and released to Japanese arcades in 1987, Psychic 5 sees a party of cute anime characters navigate a maze filled with hazards and perils, en route to a showdown with the nefarious Demon King. While all five characters have their own playstyle, gameplay places heavy emphasis on the smart control of incredibly &quot;floaty&quot; jumps, which require the player to glide their chosen hero around the various traps and obstacles that stand in their way.

The odd little adventure would not receive a home port and was rarely seen outside its native Japan, but has garnered a devoted fanbase in modern times, with fans attracted to its tricky gameplay and fun aesthetic. Psychic 5 Eternal — developed by CRT Games — will sport improved visuals, a new widescreen option, co-op two-player action, and a fully rescored soundtrack, handled by the original composer, Shinichi Sakamoto. Players will be able to switch between the remastered and original versions of the game on a whim.
Psychic 5 Eternal is currently in development for Nintendo Switch. Given that it will be playable at Tokyo Game Show later this week, one would assume that an announcement of its release date should be relatively forthcoming.

A new Fall Guys season is taking off this week, and it&#x27;s headed for the stars. Fall Guys launches Season 2 this week, dubbed Satellite Scramble, goes live on September 15.
As you can guess, this new season is all galactic. Space-themed variations of other Rounds found in Solos, Duos, and Squads will roll out, as will some new Costumes and Challenges.

A mission to repair the Fall Guys satellite can net a few rewards: a Space Bean nickname, some Kudos, a Satellite Explorer nameplate, Space Icons pattern, and a Satellite backpack at the highest tier.
But the big attraction, of course, is the new Rounds. Several new levels will join the Fall Guys rotation.

                              <span>Following the launch of PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, multiple video game publishers bumped up the price of new-gen versions of some of their games. While Ubisoft resisted that trend to this point, CEO Yves Guillemot tells Axios in an exclusive interview that it is making $70 the standard price for bigger triple-A experiences published by the company. 
We already knew that the new-gen versions of Ubisoft&#x27;s long-in-development pirate game, Skull and Bones, would retail for $70, but now it appears to be the start of the standard pricing for Ubisoft. In that interview with Axios, Guillemot stated that &quot;Some of the games will come at the same price as the competition. The big AAA games will come at $70.&quot; 
In 2020, Ubisoft CTO Frédérick Duguet said that games released in 2020 would not reach the $70 mark (and they didn&#x27;t, outside of special editions). Then, last year, Duguet said, &quot;In terms of pricing, we&#x27;ve been analyzing the competitive dynamics of the past quarter, and we are still looking at new opportunities, but we have not made any decision yet.&quot; Today&#x27;s Axios interview with Guillemot is the first indication that Ubisoft has come to an official decision regarding its pricing.
Ubisoft is far from the only gaming company increasing prices. Publishers like 2K Games, Activision, and Sony have been selling select games for $70 since the introduction of the new consoles in 2020. Meanwhile, just last month, PlayStation announced it was raising the price of its PlayStation 5 consoles in select, non-U.S. markets. Skull and Bones, the first $70 Ubisoft title, is set to launch on November 8. It&#x27;s worth noting that new-gen versions of Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage are currently listed on retailer websites for $50.
You can read the full interview with Guillemot, which touches on subjects like the Ubisoft&#x27;s troubled workplace culture, the company&#x27;s current approach to NFTs following Ghost Recon Breakpoint&#x27;s integration of them, and plenty more here.</span>

                              <span>When Danny Peña was a child, he would spend hours playing games at his local New York arcade before he received his first console, an Atari 2600, from his grandmother. Peña knew early on that he wanted to do something in the games industry, but he didn&#x27;t know what. All along the way, he was told that video games won&#x27;t pay the bills, but he didn&#x27;t let that deter him. Flash forward a couple of decades, and Peña returned to New York to show his mother a billboard featuring his face in Times Square – a monument to his success in the games industry, but not one that was easy to achieve. Now, with a new children&#x27;s book called Danny Loves Video Games about his life and career set to release this week, I sat down with Peña to chat about his road to this point.

Since the studio&#x27;s founding in 2007 under Ross, 343 Industries has worked on several Halo games, including Halo 4, Halo: The Master Chief Collection, Halo 5: Guardians, and Halo Infinite.

Metal: Hellsinger knows precisely what it is from the second it begins: a love letter to fast-paced first-person shooters, especially Doom, and a tribute to metal music and the culture surrounding it. It’s a no-frills shooter that asks, “What if you had to blow bodies to pieces to the beat of a metal album made by genre greats?” It excels at answering that question. It’s not perfect – the bosses are uninspired at times, and it could use an extra dash of variety in combat design – but my criticisms mattered little to my overall enjoyment of my 1…</span>

                              <span>Nintendo has revealed that it will livestream a Nintendo Direct tomorrow.
More specifically, the Direct will begin at 7 a.m. PT/10 a.m. ET tomorrow, Sept. 13, and it will run for roughly 40 minutes. That&#x27;s one of the largest Directs of the year, so it will likely be jam-packed with new looks at previously announced games and new ones, too (perhaps a Zelda port or two, if rumors about this Direct are correct). As for what to expect, Nintendo says the Direct will &quot;mostly&quot; focus on Switch games launching this Winter. 
Tune in at 7 a.m. PT tomorrow, 9/13, for a #NintendoDirect livestream featuring roughly 40 minutes of information mostly focused on #NintendoSwitch games launching this winter.

The key word here is &quot;mostly&quot; because that leaves just enough room for Nintendo to discuss and/or announce games coming next year. Only time will tell, but fortunately, we don&#x27;t have to wait long because the Direct is less than 24 hours away. 
If you&#x27;re in the U.K., please see the tweet below: 
As a mark of respect during this period of national mourning, we will not livestream tomorrow’s Nintendo Direct. It will be published as a video-on-demand on our YouTube channel at 16:00 (UK time) tomorrow.

                              <span>Splatoon 3 is already shaping up to be another hit for the franchise and Nintendo. Selling 3.45 million copies since Friday in just Japan, Splatoon 3 had the best launch ever for a Switch game in Japan, as reported by Eurogamer. 
This includes both digital and physical sales. It&#x27;s safe to say the squid (and Octoling) community are off to a great start with the threequel that&#x27;s exclusive to Switch. According to Eurogamer, however, despite the game also being number one on the U.K. boxed charts, as reported by GamesIndustry.biz, overall launch sales are down 9% compared to Splatoon 2 there. The U.K.&#x27;s boxed chart only included physical games, though, so it&#x27;s possible that decline isn&#x27;t present when digital games are taken into account. There&#x27;s no word on how Splatoon 3 is fairing in the U.S., but it typically follows trends in the U.K. 


&quot;Nintendo Co., LTD...announced that domestic sales of the Splatoon 3 game for the Nintendo Switch system have surpassed 3.45 million units in the first three days since launch on September 9, 2022,&quot; a Nintendo press release reads. &quot;This is the highest domestic sales level for any Nintendo software within the first three days.&quot; 
It&#x27;s no surprise Splatoon 3 is selling well in Japan and elsewhere – it&#x27;s great! And you can read about why in the Game Informer Splatoon 3 review.

For the current-flagship Intel Xeon Platinum 8380 &quot;Ice Lake&quot; processors, Ubuntu 22.10 does deliver some performance advantages over the current Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS release. However, Ubuntu 22.10 still trails in a distance behind Intel&#x27;s own Clear Linux platform for the most aggressive out-of-the-box performance.</span>

                              <span>Fantasy action RPG Forspoken has been delayed more times than most games, although it’s finally pencilled in for a January release date. We’re still quite a way off from then, but Sony have released a smattering more gameplay footage today, detailing the moves you&#x27;ll be pulling as heroine Frey &quot;I&#x27;m seeing freaking dragons&quot; Holland. Alas, said footage has been crushed down to only a handful of GIFs over on the PlayStation Blog, but our friends at Eurogamer have a bigger, chunkier hands on preview that tells us more about why it won&#x27;t be mega cringe. Alas, we weren&#x27;t privy to this Forspoken demo, so have a watch with us below.

                              <span>I did a lot of talking at Gamescom, whether that be to developers or muttering to myself deliriously as I typed stuff up in the evening. Talking to devs especially is a wonderful thing, especially when you&#x27;re playing their game and it resonates with you. But getting hands-on with an early portion of American Arcadia rendered me virtually silent, to the point where I had to apologise to the devs for being so quiet.
And I wasn&#x27;t being rude; far from it! I was just so engrossed in the game&#x27;s mixture of side-scrolling platforming and first-person puzzling. Keep this under surveillance, because I think it&#x27;s going to be a real hit when it lands.

                              <span>Gloomwood is, so far, a very good game, but it is also not much of a game - in the literal sense that it has launched into early access incomplete. There&#x27;s currently just enough of it to play that it makes you feel both bereft and quite annoyed when it suddenly clangs its great iron doors shut in front of you. &quot;Let me in!!&quot; you scream, as you hammer on the silent portal. &quot;I really like Thief! I get you! I want to throw more decapitated heads as lures!&quot;
If you are one of those people who bases their gaming personality on liking the original Thief series, Gloomwood will have been on your radar for a while. It&#x27;s a grimy, steampunk-ish stealth immersive sim with a deliberate low-poly vibe, and it picks up the abandoned Thief football to absolutely run with it. But, though the current EA build is but short, it feels like Gloomwood is aiming to punt that ball into outer space. There&#x27;s so much more room to be playful and experiment than I expected, and it&#x27;s so much fun that if you&#x27;d never played a stealth sim in your life I&#x27;d recommend Gloomwood. Except I wouldn&#x27;t, because it feels like I&#x27;d be doing you a disservice to recommend it now, when the fun will be so quickly snatched away.

                              <span>It&#x27;s a very odd feeling, building a catapult all on your lonesome while watching fiery death rain down on your enemy&#x27;s castle in the valley below. I suspect it&#x27;s probably a similar experience to watching the carnage of Chivalry II play out from the safety of a nearby bench. The newly announced Warlander from Nier Replicant devs Toylogic certainly has the medieval setting in common with Torn Banner Studio&#x27;s first-person hack and slash, but this free-to-play multiplayer warfare game is an altogether different beast. You control your warriors in third-person, for starters, and its more cartoonish visuals allow for, well, daft cataclysmic events like a flaming meteor shower to hone in on a player&#x27;s position without appearing completely over the top. As it prepares to enter its first open beta later today, September 12th, I went hands on with a brief demo build to see what it was all about.

                              <span>&quot;Oh, come on!&quot; is a phrase you hear a lot in Sunday Gold. It&#x27;s often uttered by your knuckle-dusting healer Sally, and is invariably followed up by, &quot;You havin&#x27; a laugh, mate?&quot; and &quot;Facking hell!&quot; - partly because Sally is from Laaaandan and is thus obligated to speak lik&#x27; tha&#x27;, innit (because how else would you know this is a game set in Laaaandan), but also because the thugs, security guards and cybernetic dogs she&#x27;s often fighting in this seedy tale of corporate dystopia are some of the most frustrating enemies known to video games. The type who are seemingly resistant to every single weapon type in your arsenal, or who invariably have big, scripted healing sequences just when you&#x27;re about to nail &#x27;em. 
It&#x27;s a phrase I often found myself echoing while playing Sunday Gold for review, too, both during its tedious, war of attrition-style turn-based battles, and while trying to figure out some of its more obtuse puzzles. BKOM Studios have tried to fuse one too many things together in Sunday Gold, and the result is a messy, somewhat artificial blend of Deathloop&#x27;s style, Invisible Inc&#x27;s tension and a more action-led focus on the cerebral role-playing of Disco Elysium. There&#x27;s still much to admire in its stylish visuals and atmospheric music, but I also haven&#x27;t been this cross playing a video game since Felix The Reaper, and that&#x27;s saying something.

                              <span>Ubisoft’s subscription service doesn’t have the user-base of something like Microsoft’s Game Pass. Now, it seems, the French publishers are hoping that plonking in some indie games among its multitudes of Assassin’s Creeds and Tom Clancy shooters will attract a more varied clientele. They’re also running a free trial period for Ubisoft+ until October 10th, including for lapsed subscribers, so that’s something.

It’s 23°c outside and folks are already thinking about PC gaming deals they might want in the damp, dark, dying days of November. Hey, I’m not knocking it, and I’ll even put together this guide that early Black Friday birds might find useful. I just don’t even think of what I want for dinner later.

                              <span>Square Enix are taking more steps to implement the controversial blockchain technology in their games. Squeenix have teamed with blockchain company Oasys, who describe themselves as “environmentally-friendly”. This is because of their less energy-intensive “proof-of-stake” mechanism compared to “proof-of-work” methods such as those used in Bitcoin mining. Oasys&#x27;s plans fits with Squeenix’s intention to develop tokenised economies built on blockchain in their future games.

An ESRB 18+ rating that lists &quot;real gambling&quot; appears to be in effect for the upcoming back-to-basics Assassin’s Creed set in 9th century Baghdad. If you missed the first look at Mirage over the weekend then you can watch the cinematic trailer below.

                              <span>Thermal Design Power (TDP) je na nových procesorech konfigurovatelné a sestává se s PL1 pro spotřebu při dlouhém trvání a PL2 pro krátké trvání. Na serveru cnx-software.com vyšel minulý týden návod, jak nastavit limity PL1 a PL2 na procesorech Intel a AMD. Pokud nemůžete nastavit PL1 a PL2 v Biosu, v Linuxu je možné použít powercap-utils a rozhraní Intel RAPL (Running Average Power Limit). PL1 a PL2 jde přečíst pomocí powercap-info a zapsat pomocí  powercap-set.</span>

The application, built on the VLC media player, doesn&#x27;t host or link to any content, but that hasn&#x27;t stopped rightsholders from complaining. In fact, the software&#x27;s website is currently blocked by ISPs in Spain, which is completely unjustified according to Ace Stream&#x27;s management.

                              <span>Despite broad public protests, Cloudflare initially declined to cut its ties with Kiwi Farms. When death threats came into play, the company quickly changed its position. The removal of Kiwi Farms will likely increase calls for voluntary curation of the web, and may reach way beyond Cloudflare. Domain registrars, registries, and ISPs may actually be better targets. What could possibly go wrong?

                              <span>Sony have been regularly releasing games on PC for a while now, with an often quick turnaround between &#x27;announcement&#x27; and &#x27;it&#x27;s out now&#x27;. The exception is the Uncharted: Legacy Of Thieves Collection, which was confirmed for PC back in September 2021 but which still hasn&#x27;t arrived.

It&#x27;s not going to be quite the massive open world adventure &#x27;em up that the last few entries have been (don&#x27;t worry; one of those is on the way as well), but a more classic AssCreed experience to mark the series&#x27; 15th anniversary. This milestone has made me realise that the Creedsperience has taken up almost half of my current lifespan. Or, to put it another way, I fear that playing Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage may induce a pathetic but very real existential crisis in me.

                              <span>A not-insignificant part of the Ubisoft Forward livestream tonight was dedicated to Assassin&#x27;s Creed. To celebrate the doughty action-adventure&#x27;s 15th anniversary, senior community developer Alice Terrett was joined by a, to his credit, very excited Danny &quot;it&#x27;s the Daddy&quot; Wallace, to lay out an almost MCU-like timeline of every Assassin&#x27;s Creed thing happening for the next good while. It includes new DLC for Valhalla, and a mysterious horror-ish tease. But top of the list, after next year&#x27;s more trad and compact Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage, is Assassin&#x27;s Creed: Codename Red, the next big flagship open-world RPG for the series. And it&#x27;s set in feudal Japan.

                              <span>About a year ago we learned about the existence of something called Assassin&#x27;s Creed Infinity (or, more precisely, Project Infinity, but we&#x27;re all just calling it Infinity). The suggestion that Assassin&#x27;s Creed might become a live service online game akin to Fortnite was quite upsetting to me. Thankfully, VP executive producer on Assassin&#x27;s Creed Marc-Alexis Côté (aka MAC) appeared on tonight&#x27;s Ubisoft Forward livestream to explain more about Infinity, and I am slightly less alarmed but no less confused. Rather than a game, MAC says that Infinity is &quot;going to be the single entry point for our fans into the Assassin&#x27;s Creed franchise in the future&quot;.

As you may have guessed from the title of this post, it&#x27;s also on sale at Amazon for a very reasonable price: £59 gets you a 500GB model compared to a UK RRP of £101.

I don&#x27;t miss those 5am sunrises either. So we can surely all agree that the sensible course of action would be to lock sunrise to 7:30am and rotate the whole clock around that. Anyway!

Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage
This game was officially revealed last week following extensive leaks, and as expected, Ubisoft had a lot more to share about it during today&#x27;s Ubisoft Forward showcase. Basim Ibn Ishaq, the master assassin from Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla, is taking the lead role this time, but he&#x27;ll be much younger. This game follows his journey from a thief on the luscious and diverse streets of Golden Age Baghdad in 861 to an apprentice of the Hidden Ones to a master assassin. It also represents a return to the series&#x27; roo…</span>

                              <span>Following numerous leaks over the previous few weeks, Ubisoft officially revealed that Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage is real. As expected, Ubisoft revealed a lot more about Mirage during today&#x27;s Ubisoft Forward showcase, including the game&#x27;s protagonist, setting, and more. 
If you&#x27;ve been paying attention to leaks and rumors, you likely already had a good idea of what Mirage will be, doubly so after today&#x27;s presentation. Basim Ibn Ishaq, the master assassin from Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla, is in the lead role this time around. However, he&#x27;s not the polished warrior you might remember him as because Mirage takes place years before Valhalla. In this game, he&#x27;s a young thief, and his playground is the luscious and diverse streets of Baghdad, Iraq. Set in 861, a period when Baghdad was the epicenter …</span>

                              <span>Ubisoft and Netflix have announced an expansion of their partnership that was first announced in 2020 with a live-action Assassin&#x27;s Creed series that is still on the way and the Rabbids Invasion: Mission to Mars movie that arrived on the service earlier this year. Today, we learned that Netflix subscribers will have exclusive access to three upcoming Ubisoft mobile games as a part of their existing memberships, with no ads or microtransactions. This announcement comes as Netflix prepares to enter the gaming space with its first releases later this year.
First up, is a sequel to Valiant Hearts, a World War I puzzle-adventure. This new title is in development by the team behind the first game and will bring a new story exclusively to Netflix members in January 2023. That same year, a sequel to Mighty Quest, the roguelite hack and slash, will arrive for subscribers. Finally, Ubisoft is currently working on a new, original Assassin&#x27;s Creed mobile title, which, again, will be available exclusively to Netflix subscribers.
In addition to the Assassin&#x27;s Creed live-action series, Ubisoft and Netflix are currently collaborating on three animated series: Captain Laserhawk: Blood Dragon Remix, Far Cry, and Splinter Cell. While Netflix is set to enter the games industry later this year, we&#x27;ll have to wait until at least next year to experience these three new mobile titles for Netflix subscribers.</span>

                              <span>Huge reveals in video games, movies, and TV are currently unfolding at D23 Expo, Disney&#x27;s annual consumer show held in Anaheim, California. Yesterday we received our first looks at an unnamed Marvel game, a new Tron title, and Mickey Mouse and crew teaming up in a platformer. Today, Marvel and Lucasfilm unloaded a flurry of announcements and trailers for projects hitting in 2022 and beyond.
On the Marvel Cinematic Universe front, we learned Fantastic Four will be directed by Matt Shakman, who worked on Wandavision and It&#x27;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia. Dominique Thorne&#x27;s Ironheart will take on the villain The Hood (brought to life by Anthony Ramos) in the Ironheart Disney Plus series. Sam Wilson&#x27;s first mission as Captain America in New World Order will be against The Leader, with Tim Blake reprising this role 14 years after 2008&#x27;s The Incredible Hulk.
We also learned who the Thunderbolts are in the forthcoming film. The team consists of anti-heroes Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh), Taskmaster (Olga Kurylenko), Valentina (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), Red Guardian (David Harbour), U.S. Agent (Wyatt Russell), Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen, and Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan).
Marvel also treated us to our first looks at Secret Invasion, starring Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury and Emilia Clarke in an unknown role. And in just one month, we can watch the classicly designed horror film Werewolf by Night on Disney Plus. You can see both trailers below.
The Star Wars news is a bit lighter, consisting of our first look at The Mandalorian&#x27;s third season, which looks absolutely bonkers in the best way. We also got a glimpse of the animated anthology Tales of the Jedi, hitting on October 26. The Bad Batch&#x27;s second season hits on January 4, yet no new footage was shown. Andor also received a new trailer for the first season hitting in 11 days. The second season&#x27;s filming is already underway! Again, you can see all of the Star Wars trailers below.

                              <span>During today&#x27;s Ubisoft Forward presentation, the publisher showed off new footage of a boss battle in Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope. The crossover game, which combines the iconic Mushroom Kingdom crew with the zany Rabbids, looks to expand in the first 2017 turn-based tactical game in the series, Kingdom Battle, in myriad ways, including the new Sparks that can add various buffs to the heroes and debuffs to the villains.


This time around, we got a look at battles on a train, including Bowser joining the team. The battle takes place on the train as the crew tries to cleanse an angered Wiggler of corrupted darkness eyes as it runs alongside the train. Ubisoft also announced that it has post-launch plans including free DLC with the third content drop introducing a new playable hero: Rayman.
Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope comes exclusively to Switch on October 20.</span>

                              <span>In the world of Marvel Comics, the word &quot;ensemble&quot; invokes thoughts of the Avengers, X-Men, or Fantastic Four. Recently, we learned Skydance New Media and Marvel Entertainment were working on an ensemble Marvel video game. The internet&#x27;s rumor mill believed this game would focus on Reed Richards and his fantastic family. Yesterday, during the Disney &amp; Marvel Games Showcase, we learned this ensemble wasn&#x27;t Fantastic Four, Avengers, or any known Marvel team whatsoever. Skydance is creating its own team of four heroes, set to the backdrop of World War II.
The timeframe has Captain America front and center fighting against Hydra and Nazi troops. Through a narrative twist, Wakanda gets involved, and players gain control of Black Panther, but not the one you know. This Black Panther is Azzuri, T…</span>

                              <span>As previously announced, Amy Hennig&#x27;s game for Marvel was shown during this evening&#x27;s Disney games showcase. As was leaked, it&#x27;s about Captain America and Black Panther working to fight against Hydra during World War 2. What I didn&#x27;t expect at all was that the game still wouldn&#x27;t have a name, although there are a few other details to glean from the most teasery teaser trailer.

                              <span>For my money, if you want a story about a society set inside a computer, look to ReBoot. But I suppose Tron might satisfy, too. A new visual novel set in the neon universe called Tron: Identity was announced during this evening&#x27;s Disney &amp; Marvel games showcase, and it&#x27;s being developed by Bithell Games. There&#x27;s a very brief teaser trailer below.

Also, player-built factories, and several other features which should make players focused on the logistics of warfare very happy. There&#x27;s a new trailer below ahead of its release on September 28th.

Like everything, it&#x27;s also a roguelike, but it&#x27;s transparent and fair enough that I can reluctantly forgive that too, not least because I&#x27;ve found myself enjoying this one the more it went on. It&#x27;s a lighter, cheerier sibling of Into The Breach that&#x27;s half tactical fighter, half puzzler, and its default difficulty setting is close to perfect if you&#x27;re looking for something less intense that will still catch you out now and then.

That&#x27;s Betrayal At Club Low, the latest game from Cosmo D, set in the same strange city as Off-Peak, The Norwood Suite, and Tales From Off-Peak City. This time, it&#x27;s an honest-to-goodness RPG, full of skill checks, strange solutions, multiple endings, and so very many dice. And it&#x27;s great. And it has a demo.

SadFutago’s The Nier: Automata Church mod is finally ready to download from NexusMods.

                              <span>Despite lamenting the other week that the rest of 2022&#x27;s gaming calendar was looking a bit weak sauce after endless delay announcements, September is shaping up to be an absolutely monster month for indie releases right now. As Alice Bee noted earlier in the week, there are just too many cool, interesting games coming out for us to review effectively on the site at the moment (although rest assured, we will do our darnedest to cover as many of them as we can).
Part of the challenge is working out what&#x27;s worth reviewing, and what we think is worth highlighting for you, our readers. The other part, though, is often entirely selfish on our part, just playing and writing about cool games we like.

                              <span>Overwatch 2 won’t be locking new heroes behind a paid battle pass, it’s emerged. Blizzard VP Jon Spector confirmed that heroes will be available through a free track for the battle pass.

                              <span>Most of the quests and tasks in Disney’s Dreamlight Valley are fairly simple and straightforward, with characters like Goofy often telling you exactly what to do or how to do it. But there are some exceptions, and they just happen to involve crudites and ratatouille. Instead of struggling as I did, let me just tell…

                              <span>Disney Speedstorm, the upcoming free-to-play kart racer starring a who’s who of Disney and Pixar icons, got a new trailer highlighting the terrifying (or hilarious, depending on your reaction) inclusion of Monsters, Inc.
Monsters, Inc. is represented with its own themed course that takes players throughout the corporate office and the department of doors. We also got to see Mike Wazowski, Randall, and Celia behind the wheel as playable racers, joining the previously announced Sulley, Mickey Mouse, Mulan, and Jack Sparrow. 


Disney Speestorm still has no release window, but it’s slated to launch on Switch and PC.</span>

                              <span>During today&#x27;s Disney &amp; Marvel Games Showcase at the D23 Expo, we got a look at the first game from Skydance New Media. While we didn&#x27;t get a name or release date, we did get a cinematic trailer from which we can try to extract information. The biggest news right out of the gate is that this game stars Black Panther, Captain America, and two additional heroes.
This new triple-A game takes place during World War II. As the camera pans over a table covered with things like a brochure for Paris and a flyer for a jazz performance, the items quickly take a turn for the insidious with things like a dagger, a pistol, documents, a hat featuring the Hydra insignia, and, finally, Captain America&#x27;s iconic shield scratched by what appears to be claws.

                              <span>Gargoyles is back! Well, sort of. The 1995 Sega Genesis side-scroller based on the beloved 90’s animated series is getting the remaster treatment, bringing Goliath and his team (much to their chagrin) back into the spotlight.
Unfortunately, the reveal didn’t come alongside a trailer, a list of platforms, or a release window. However, it sounds like we should expect a similar treatment that the Disney Classics Games Collection received. Those games were enhanced with high-res graphics, a rewind ability, a level skip, and art galleries showcasing concept sketches and other historical goodies. 
You can see the announcement at the 12:33 mark.</span>

The gameplay trailer offers a montage of tactical card-based combat, as well as choice-driven relationship building. Give it a watch below. 


We also got word that a series of animated shorts serve as a prequel to the game’s plot. The first episode arrives on October 31 on Marvel&#x27;s YouTube channel.


Firaxis previously announced Marvel’s Midnight Suns will have a staggered launch, so the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC versions will launch on December 2. Meanwhile, the Switch and last-gen versions hit sometime later.</span>

                              <span>Disney and Bithell Games have revealed Tron Identity, a new PC game coming to Steam sometime next year. 
This reveal kicked off today&#x27;s Disney and Marvel Games Showcase, a first for the company. Unfortunately for those looking for more information about the game, the reveal trailer falls more in line with being a &quot;teaser&quot; than anything else. It does feature the Identity Disc, which is typically used for combat in the Tron world, but that&#x27;s about it. However, in an interview after the showcase, Bithell Games&#x27; Mike Bithell said the game takes place &quot;in a world where Flynn created an Ark, where Flynn created a second grid for them to go to, promising that he&#x27;d come back.&quot;


&quot;As we know from [2010&#x27;s Tron: Legacy], though, he didn&#x27;t,&quot; Bithell continued. &quot;Tron fans will also know that time moves…</span>

The trailer also showcases roughly a minute of new gameplay, which reveals more about the strategy card game. It looks quite dynamic, with plenty of fun animations to accompany your card&#x27;s individual moves.

As you can see, Marvel Snap is set to hit PC, iOS, and Android devices next month, on Oct. 18. 
&quot;The adrenaline-pumping, superpowered card battler lets fans assemble their Marvel dream team of heroes and villains and then battle their way through the multiverse to glory – all in just three-minute play sessions,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;Marvel Snap is super easy to learn, but will take a lifetime for even the best of players to master.

                              <span>Disney and DLaLa Studios have revealed Disney&#x27;s Illusion Island, a 2D platformer starring Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Donald, and of course, Goofy. 
Revealed during today&#x27;s Disney and Marvel Games Showcase, Illusion Island looks a lot like Disney&#x27;s Mickey Mouse show that consists of various shorts starring original Disney characters like, well, Mickey and all of his friends. 


It seems that in Illusion Island, we&#x27;ll be controlling Mickey, Minnie, Donald, and Goofy based on what obstacles might be in our way. Mickey, for example, seems to be able to bounce off of walls, whereas Minnie has a grapple hook-like rope useful for clearing large gaps. Donald can swim – duh – and Goofy uses condiments (it kind of looked like mustard, but it might also be paint) to float and bounce above the stage below. 

All of it looks like good fun, but it&#x27;s not all smiles and happiness on Illusion Island. That&#x27;s because our heroes must endure three trials to retrieve the coveted Book of Knowledge. We&#x27;ll learn exactly what those trials are when Disney&#x27;s Illusion Island hits Switch exclusively next year.</span>

Ooblets offers a smile-inducing amalgamation of monster collecting, farming simulation, and relationship building. However, this delightful chill pill becomes tougher to swallow thanks to a tedious, grind-heavy progression that tests your patience in less enjoyable ways.  
The adventure whisks players to Badgetown, a quirky village where residents harmoniously live alongside Pokémon-esque creatures called Ooblets. Despite your newcomer status, the townsfolks turn to you to restore the city to its former glory. That involves tasks s…</span>

                              <span>Following the rocky and bug-filled launch of Battlefield 2042 last year, EA announced that Respawn’s Vince Zampella was named as the head of the Battlefield franchise amidst wider franchise changes that include the creation of a Battlefield universe. Then, a few months later, EA announced that its next Battlefield game had entered pre-production using “valuable lessons” learned from Battlefield 2042. 
While exactly what the next Battlefield game is remains confirmed, a new Battlefield-centric blog post from chief experience officer of EA Byron Beede and the Battlefield team sheds new light on a possibility. The next game might be a narrative-focused one set in the Battlefield universe. 
“Many of you know that Marcus Lehto joined the team earlier this year,” the blog post reads. “Today, we announced the name of his new Seattle-based studio, Ridgeline Games. Marcus will bring his long legacy of creating fascinating worlds and gripping narratives to Battlefield. Backed by a world-class team, he’ll be leading the charge to develop a narrative campaign set in the Battlefield universe that will engage fans in new and exciting ways while remaining true to the classic elements of the series.” 
As you can see, the blog post doesn’t indicate that Lehto’s narrative game is the next Battlefield, but it’s a possibility, as is a new multiplayer-focused project like Battlefield 2042. Only time will tell. 
There’s a lot more in the blog post, including the announcement that creative director Lars Gustavsson, who has been with the franchise since its start more than two decades ago, is leaving EA, so be sure to head there to get the full rundown.

                              <span>This April, a coalition of entertainment companies convinced a judge to sign a pirate site blocking injunction that affected every ISP in the United States. This document was later found to be unenforceable but it was public access to court records that first pushed it into the public eye. As the case enters a new phase to block more domains, a level of secrecy had been requested by the plaintiffs.

Beede also wrote that they are &quot;all-in on Battlefield&quot;, with DICE continuing to work on Battlefield multiplayer and a third studio, Ripple Effect, &quot;creating an entirely new Battlefield experience.&quot;

The changes come after months of testing as one of Valve&#x27;s Steam Labs experiments.

Now Bethesda have announced that they&#x27;re launching new dedicated servers for the free World War 2 shooter, which will all run the six original maps with no mods.

Which sounds like a big deal, but really both studios are just reporting a change to their terms of service and privacy notices since they were bought by Embracer Group last month.

I’ve definitely enjoyed it more than on its release in 2019, and its DLC adds more to think about and manage during what were once long lull periods. There&#x27;s a lot to like about its final form. There&#x27;s also a lot to... I don&#x27;t quite want to say hate, but I&#x27;m also not quite sure why. It&#x27;s one of the most evenly mixed bags I&#x27;ve ever rummaged around in.

                              <span>We enter the new pod-century on the Electronic Wireless Show podcast a man down, as Matthew won&#x27;t be here for a few weeks. Not to worry, though, as myself and Nate are ever ready to hold down the fort. This week we&#x27;re talking about our favourite cinematics in video games, a fitting subject because last weekend I saw the greatest piece of cinema yet conceived by man: Michael Flatley&#x27;s Blackbird.
I do spend quite a lot of time explaining Blackbird to Nate, but after that we do talk about some cutscenes and cinematics in games (as well as litigating the difference between the two, and Nate tries to remember the first time he saw a cutscene in a game that was in-engine rather than being pre-rendered). And today the Cavern Of Lies is a Cavern Of Justice, after we received a troubling missive from one [squints] Brond Coatwear?

                              <span>I saw a panel of thriller authors a couple of months back and one of them made reference to &quot;the fat chapter&quot;, and the others all went &quot;Ohhhh, yes, the fat chapter!&quot;. Thriller writers deal in short, snappy chapters, and the fat chapter is the one that ends up getting a load of events or exposition shoved into it, somewhere in the second half, because they wouldn&#x27;t fit anywhere else. Every year in games there&#x27;s a fat month, where loads of games come out and loads of them look really good and there is never enough time godammit.
This year that month is September. There are so many games out this month that look so much my jam that I want to spread &#x27;em on my morning toast, but September is also the month that a lot of RPS staff have holiday booked - including me, for two weeks, which means that if these games do get reviewed it probably won&#x27;t be by me. But know that I have my beady little eyes on &#x27;em.

                              <span>Temtem’s inspiration has always been clear. We didn’t beat around the bush when it entered early access back in 2020 - Cian Maher called it the best Pokemon game in years - and I won’t beat around the bush now. It’s still the best Pokemon game in years. It borrows so much from Nintendo&#x27;s behemoth, but it also takes some much-needed lessons that Game Freak fails to recognise, taking the formula to its highest evolution yet.

Some players have been getting themselves very worked up over the inclusion of a paid pass in a full-priced game. Yet there’s been a plan to include a battle pass in Temtem for years. Check out the game’s launch trailer below while you wrap your head around it all.

                              <span>It cannot be a coincidence that 1997 is a pivotal year in the world of Jack Move. In the game, it&#x27;s the year everything went dark in this turn-based Japanese-style RPG, with a solar storm biffing the world&#x27;s electronics. It threw the world into chaos, giving rise to the megacorps that now control the dystopian cyberpunk society where our heroine Noa is trying to make a living. In the real world, of course, 1997 was the year Final Fantasy VII came out, the seminal JRPG that Jack Move owes a great deal to (right down to its menu plink plink sound). Developers So Romantic have said outright that it&#x27;s been one of the main inspirations for Jack Move, and its shady corporate powers and grungy urban landscape certainly feel of a piece with ShinRa&#x27;s grip on the city of Midgar. 
But the bigwigs at MonoMind aren&#x27;t out to poison the world and suck the life from it in Jack Move. Instead, they&#x27;re more concerned with using their newfound technological powers to find eternal life – a classic &#x27;upload your mind to the metaverse&#x27; kind of tale you&#x27;ll probably recognise if you&#x27;ve read any of the cyberpunk 101 novels such as William Gibson&#x27;s Neuromancer or Permutation City by Greg Egan. Jack Move&#x27;s story doesn&#x27;t tread any new ground in this respect, but Noa and her hacker pal Ryder are a fiery spirited pair that make this six-hour tale of espionage and rebellion against its cartoonish villain well worth dipping into. Yes, you read that correctly. A JRPG you can polish off in a single day of play. Bliss.

                              <span>I keep thinking about Roadwarden like a tourist city that I visited for not quite long enough. Sure, I saw the main sights and had a great time soaking in the ambiance, but I know that I missed so many hidden gems. I want to go back and explore, maybe this time with a local guide who knows its secrets.
At its most basic, Roadwarden is a text-based RPG. You play as the titular roadwarden, who sets out from the city to investigate an unmapped peninsula with little more than their horse for company. Your goal as set by the people who sent you is to investigate the region and report your findings in preparation for the expansion of trade guilds in the area. But you can also set your own goal, shaping your character’s approach from the start in a way that helps with roleplaying a particular kind of adventurer throughout. And once you get to that adventuring, dozens of sidequests open up covering everything from gathering fruit to curing the plague.

                              <span>Vodeo Games, the first game development studio in North America to unionise, are shutting down. The team behind turn-based RPG Beast Breaker announced their closure on Twitter, after being unable to find financial backers for another project. Beast Breaker wasn’t a game I was familiar with but its little mouse protagonist looks charming, as you can see in the trailer below.

                              <span>Every corner of Skyrim houses a locked chest, but where are all the keys? Only a handful actually have keys to open them. So do the chest&#x27;s owners lockpick them every time they want an apple or knife? Are these chests merely decorative, their contents deemed inaccessible and long forgotten? A new mod for Skyrim Special Edition answers this playfully by adding a load of hidden keys to unlock these chests. Some of the keys look quite well hidden in this object hunt, so you&#x27;ll need to poke around, rummage, and turn things over.

                              <span>When we last saw Amicia and Hugo de Rune at the end of A Plague Tale: Innocence back in 2019, things were looking up for the orphaned rat wranglers. They&#x27;d escaped the clutches of the French Inquisition and the hordes of plague rats following in their wake, and the pair were hopeful about finding a cure for the cursed macula flowing through Hugo&#x27;s veins.
Alas, when I pick up their journey in chapter six of Asobo&#x27;s upcoming sequel, A Plague Tale: Requiem, Amicia is having a particularly terrible time of it. Not only is she suffering from an open head wound, leaving her unsteady on her feet, but rumours are flying in the nearby pilgrim camp about something bad having gone down in the last city they passed through. Exactly what is hard to say with five chapters&#x27; worth of context missing from my preview build, but the pack of guards who are hot on the siblings&#x27; trail quickly make it plain: several men died back in that city, and they&#x27;re pointing the finger squarely at Amicia&#x27;s knife, slingshot and crossbow.

That&#x27;s a reasonable price for even one of these games, let alone the 18 games included in this bundle.

Above all, a deeper level of customization lets players fine-tune their own wintry apocalypse. PlayStation enthusiasts might recognize the phrase “Play has no limits” from a string of ads. Ragnarök’s lead UX designer, Mila Pavlin, echoed the same sentiments and voiced her dedication to centering players of all walks of life. “This is a fantasy epic,” Pavlin says. “This is about a father and son. This is about fate and the Nine Realms. And the ability to go into that, regardless of your background, and be able to experience all this rich detail and history and story? That drives me every day.”

                              <span>All of the new heroes coming to Overwatch 2 will not be immediately playable at launch, and that&#x27;s because you&#x27;ll need to unlock them on the free track of the game&#x27;s battle pass. 
Overwatch commercial leader and vice president of Blizzard Jon Spector revealed this on Twitter last night following leaks and rumors that stated the new heroes would need to be unlocked in the battle pass, which is a paid premium pass that rewards players for leveling up through it akin to passes seen in Fortnite and other games. That&#x27;s partly true in that yes, new heroes will need to be unlocked through the battle pass but Spector clarified on Twitter that those heroes will be on the free track of the battle pass. 
&quot;Addressing some incomplete info posted early about our Overwatch 2 Battle Pass – we&#x27;ll be sharing all details ahead of launch, but want to confirm that new Overwatch 2 heroes will be available on the free track of the Battle Pass.&quot;

September 8, 2022
As you can see, you won&#x27;t need to pay any money to unlock the new heroes in Overwatch 2. However, it could still take some time to unlock these heroes depending on where they are on the free track. Only time will tell but fortunately, we don&#x27;t have to wait too much longer to find out because Overwatch 2 is out Oct. 4. 
In the meantime, read about how Xbox boss Phil Spencer says Overwatch will come to Xbox Game Pass and then check out why we think Overwatch 2 feels like a completely different game. Read about how cross-progression is coming to Overwatch 2 after that.

                              <span>Microsoft announced in January that it was moving to acquire Activision Blizzard for a colossal $68.7 billion, making it far and away the most expensive acquisition in gaming history. Now, of course, regulators like the U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority and the U.S.’ FTC must approve of this, and those investigations are ongoing. But suppose all goes according to Microsoft’s plan. In that case, the company will own Activision Blizzard, the publisher and developer behind Call of Duty, Overwatch, World of Warcraft, and more, by the spring or summer of 2023. 
Shortly after the company announced its plans to acquire Activision Blizzard, Xbox head Phil Spencer confirmed his company’s intent “to keep Call of Duty on PlayStation” following the purchase. He reaffirmed this commitment earlie…</span>

                              <span>Before Vanillaware made its name with titles like 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim and Dragon’s Crown, it found early success with a little game called GrimGrimoire. The side-scrolling strategy title garnered a cult following when it hit the PlayStation 2 in 2007, but it got another shot in the spotlight this year with the Japanese launch of GrimGrimoire OnceMore in July. Now we know when players in the U.S. and Europe get to experience Lillet’s spellbinding adventure again or for the first time. 
GrimGrimoire OnceMore comes to the west in Spring 2023 for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and Switch. The game stars Lillet Blan, a witch-in-training who attends the famed Tower of Silver Star magic school, where things have gone awry. It’s up to her to uncover its dark secrets in an adventure that unfolds over a repeating five-day cycle. Though a side-scroller, players battle enemies by summoning and commanding Familiars in real-time strategy battles that unfold in a 2D perspective. 
OnceMore features HD graphics, a new skill tree, an improved user interface, an art gallery, and other unspecified features. 


Fans may remember Odin Sphere making a similar comeback in 2016 with the Leifthrasir edition, and it’s cool to see GrimGrimoire get the same treatment. Are you excited to replay GrimGrimoire? Will this be your first time giving it a try? Let us know in the comments!</span>

Since its debut in 2015, the Splatoon series has delivered unique, colorful gameplay cribbed by scarce launch content and disappointing time restrictions for specific modes. While post-launch content greatly bolstered both games to this point, I’ve always been disappointed by how little was initially on offer. Now on its third entry, the series may feel a bit less fresh, but Splatoon 3 remedies the series’ long-standing launch content woes while retaining all the fun that made the series such a success.
Stepping back into the stylish shoes of your custom Inkling feels great; splattering your brightly colored ink looks, feels, and sounds satisfyingly messy, particularly when you’re splatting an enemy. Few games match the smo…</span>

                              <span>Gotham Knights pits a dysfunctional Bat Family against a litany of their greatest foes, but one of the biggest conflicts the group must confront comes from within. How did Warner Bros. Montreal adapt and reimagine these characters to keep them true to their comic origins while still surprising players? A new video breaks down its storytelling process. 
The development team explains the narrative&#x27;s themes of trauma, loss, chosen family, and how it uses the Knights&#x27; long, complicated relationships to make each hero feel fully realized as individuals and as a family. WB Montreal also discusses Alfred&#x27;s pivotal role as a father figure to the team, the social moments that unfold in the Belfrey hideout, and its approach to cinematic design. 


Gotham Knights launches on October 21 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. You can see more on the game by checking out the Gamescom trailer spotlighting the villains players will battle.</span>

                              <span>The Hitman games are often good and usually fun, it’s fair to say, particularly the recent World Of Assassination trilogy. Ian Hitman’s turn in the two films released about his adventures has been rougher to recommend, though. That’s why it’s simultaneously disappointing and awesome to learn that Guardians Of The Galaxy, The Suicide Squad and – shudder – Slither director James Gunn narrowly missed his target when he pitched a Hitman movie.

                              <span>Third person skater shooter Rollerdrome has some really cool weapons, but what is it that makes them so special? I mean, there’s only four of them, and you’re forced to constantly perform tricks to regain ammo, which doesn&#x27;t make them easy to use. I think it’s because of their more literal significance in the game. Rollerdrome threatens you with multiple enemy types called Houseplayers, all formidable, especially in the heat of battle when they combine their efforts. Luckily, the four distinct weapons you’re equipped with act as an equaliser; each weapon is a solution for a particular enemy. Developers Roll7 could have easily added a bunch of copied and pasted guns from every generic shooter, but instead they were more intentional about the weapons they included, with each weapon complimenting the gunplay and the game as a whole.

This makes Rockstar’s cowboy epic/improvised teleconferencing software the latest game to work with AMD’s upscaler without mods; an unofficial FSR patch for RDR2 has been out for a while, but this update should make it even easier to simply enable or disable FSR in the settings menu. Alongside its rival, Nvidia DLSS, which Rockstar also added last year.

The deal will see Tencent bring some of Ubisoft’s most well known game series to mobile, and to PC in China. Tencent’s investment in Guillemot Brothers Limited follows speculation last month that they were looking to take out a bigger stake in Ubisoft, even becoming the single largest shareholders.

                              <span>I&#x27;m an enormous fan of the premise of Steelrising (which is good, because enormous fans are also a weapon in it). In it, we&#x27;re whisked to an alternative history where King Louis XVI stopped the French Revolution before it properly got going by, err, killing everyone with steampunk robots. You&#x27;re Aegis, a feminine robot created to entertain and protect Queen Marie Antoinette. Marie, safe outside Paris but somewhat peeved at her husband&#x27;s new penchant for extreme mass murder, sends you on a Soulslike mission to sort it all out.
This takes some doing, but luckily Aegis is a very advanced robot, the bestest of all the robots. Slight but adaptive with it, and even having an advanced AI, Aegis can carve a swift path through the more than usually twisted metal in her way. It&#x27;s a bit too easy, in fact.

Both studios claim PQube withheld money from them.

                              <span>What sounds like the entire Assassin’s Creed line-up for Saturday’s Ubisoft Forward presentation may have been leaked online. Unnamed sources have supposedly told TryHardGuides that three new AC games will be announced during the event, with an instalment set in feudal Japan being among them. Bloomberg backs up the report, stating that the other games purported to be in development include one set in the 16th century that could be dealing with witches, and a mobile game set in China.

                              <span>The AMD Ryzen 5 5600 is a cheaper, better-value version of the Ryzen 5600X - the CPU took the world by storm when Ryzen 5000 launched back in 2020. With six cores and 12 threads to access, you get good performance in modern game engines, while the higher single-core speeds introduced with this generation of AMD processors allows for better performance in single-core-limited (often older) games. It&#x27;s a potent combination that makes the 5600X - and the 5600 - the best value AMD CPUs for gaming out there. 
Normally the 5600 retails for £173, in comparison to £185 for the 5600X, but today it&#x27;s down to £150 on Amazon, coming within £10 of the best price we&#x27;ve ever seen on this model.

See, Out Of Hands has a slight fixation on the ol’ phalanges. Witness for yourself in the trailer below.

In addition to millions in damages, the plaintiffs demand user disconnections and pirate site blockades.

I resolved to get one for myself, but things went mad and I only eventually managed to get one through my work.

There&#x27;s also the Edgerunner update dropping today, a tie-in for the Netflix anime Edgrunners (more info on that was also revealed tonight), and free-to-play mini game featuring Roach the horse, because we all like Roach the horse.

Indie sci-fi citybuilder The Wandering Village will let me do that when it enters early access on Steam on September 14th.

I got a sneaky early peek at Lucid behind closed doors at PAX East earlier this year, and let me tell you, its gorgeous pixel art and emphasis on air dashing through crystalline barriers with a honking great axe looks rad as hell.

But most of my thought is going on farming, planning my crop rotations to optimise fertility and yields. Finally, I have a use for everything school taught me about the three-field system and the nitrogen cycle.

You can take a look at Moonbreaker in action from its announcement at last month’s Gamescom below.

                              <span>The latest playtest build of the next in EA’s Skate series appears to have leaked, continuing the pattern that seems to have been established for the game over the past few months. Footage from the build was shared by Reddit user Parzalai, who said they had been banned from their EA account for leaking a previous build. Modders have been running their own multiplayer servers based on leaked builds of skate. for months, so it’s not surprising to see further leaks spring up from the game’s playtests.

                              <span>The sight of a two-carriage train is normally something that prompts a deep sigh of despair from me in real life. Nine times out of ten, it&#x27;s a sign that something&#x27;s gone wrong further up the line - that someone, somewhere, has sent out a train with half its usual number of carriages, and is therefore destined to ruin everyone&#x27;s day in the process by cramming us all in like a pack of sardines. 
In Afterburn&#x27;s adorable train puzzler Railbound, however, two carriages are a cause for celebration. In a game that&#x27;s about guiding numbered compartments onto the back of an engine (using a limited number of track tiles to get them there in the right order), two-carriage puzzles offer the perfect amount of cerebral head-scratching. They&#x27;ve got a bit more bite than simply guiding a single carriage to its destination, but they&#x27;re not so complicated that they&#x27;ll repeatedly make you reach for the hint button to help you fill in the gaps. Railbound has a tendency to be a bit too abstract in its later stages, but more on that in a sec. All you need to know right now is that there are plenty of smart ideas to wrap your head around here, and that you&#x27;ll be grinning from ear to ear by the time you reach the end of the line.

After four packed days of demos, panels, interviews, and lots of fruit smoothies, Liam and I are completely PAXed out, but we&#x27;re not done quite yet.
Below you&#x27;ll find something a little different from our usual daily round-ups. For our last day at PAX, we&#x27;ve done a super, uber, mega round-up on the entire event. We list off our favourite panel moments, the best game demos we played, and our general opinion on how the overall convention went. Click play below to see one of our last videos from the event:

                              <span>A group of independent movie companies has filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against AT&amp;T. The Internet provider, which has over 80 million subscribers in the US, faces far-reaching demands. In addition to millions in damages, the filmmakers want the ISP to terminate the accounts of repeat infringers and block access to sites such as The Pirate Bay and YTS.

The technology can be used to fight counterfeit products but has many other use cases as well. The tokens are compatible with regular NFT platforms and will be tied to the EU&#x27;s own blockchain services infrastructure.

                              <span>The Elgato Stream Deck MK.2 is a kind of funny thing, a little plastic box with 15 plastic buttons. Each button has a tiny screen behind it, and when pressed can do any number of things - launching a program, changing to a new scene in a stream, adjusting your media volume, muting a microphone or sending out an alert. It&#x27;s ideal for automation, giving you an easy way to trigger scripts or shortcuts that speed up the dreary parts of your job or your favourite game, and of course for game streamers it&#x27;s invaluable. The MK.2 model normally costs £139, but today at Currys you can pick one up for £97 using the code GAMING30.

                              <span>BioShock Remastered, BioShock 2 Remastered and BioShock Infinite have all fallen afoul of some questionably titled “quality of life” updates that publishers 2K Games released last week. These updates added a new 2K Launcher to all three BioShocks that appears when booting them up from Steam, but as found by GamingOnLinux, something about this launcher doesn’t take kindly to Linux-based operating systems. Linux-based operating systems like the Steam Deck’s SteamOS.


As it happens, then, there&#x27;s a chance – if you’re trying to play on Valve’s handheld PC – that all these updates will do is swing a bloodied 9-iron into the Deck’s ability to launch the affected games at all. Whoopsie doodle.

                              <span>Back in the mists of time of 2014, the original Tales From The Borderlands followed the classic Telltale episodic template, with a new chapter dropping every three or four months. Gearbox Software&#x27;s upcoming New Tales From The Borderlands, however, is going to be doing things a bit differently. As our PAX West team found out over the weekend, NuTales will still be split up into an episodic-style chapter structure, according to director of production James Lopez, but you won&#x27;t have to wait several months before you can play them altogether.

                              <span>A truly dynamic story is a goal game designers have strived toward for decades. Worldwalker Games&#x27; Wildermyth gets closer to that goal than most. In this spellbinding RPG, players guide bands of heroes through a lifetime of adventure, embarking on dozens of short, whimsical quests wherein they grow, age, and quite literally evolve, with the potential to transform into walking trees, celestial beings, and anthropomorphised crows.


Wildermyth is an inspired example of narrative design, with some nifty tactical combat to boot. But when Nate Austin, his wife Annie, and his brother Doug began developing the game around eight years ago, the weight of emphasis between storytelling and combat was very much the other way around.

The store page has since been taken down, but not before it was spotted by a few eagle-eyed Twitterers. Seeing as the next Ubisoft Forward showcase is scheduled for this coming Saturday, it’s entirely possible that we’ll be seeing some concrete deets about Heartland then.

They’re appropriately blurry, considering the series&#x27; penchant for mistiness, but still recognisably Silent Hill. Once again, it’s claimed that the game is being developed by Layers Of Fear studio Bloober Team.

These far-reaching measures apply to a movie that hasn&#x27;t yet been released and hasn&#x27;t been pirated either.

                              <span>Google has removed several popular YouTube rippers from its UK search results. The company took this action following a notice from local music group BPI, which pointed out that local ISPs are required to block the sites due to a High Court order.

                              <span>Soldier Boyz is the newest supported game of the Hypno engine, and it’s ready for public testing!
Released in 1997 by Hypnotix and published by DreamCatcher Interactive and MCPA Interactive, this full-motion rail shooter is based on the 1995 film of the same name. The game starts when the daughter of an American billionaire is kidnapped by a group of Vietnamese terrorists. Then, it’s up to Major Howard Toliver, ex-Marine and highly decorated Vietnam veteran, to gather a deadly team for the dangerous mission of rescuing her. He recruits six prison inmates serving life sentences for a chance at a full presidential pardon.
Keep the body count rising to survive five territories by playing as each Soldier Boy (and Girl),
but beware and don’t waste a “friendly” since they provide vital survival information!
ScummVM currently supports the English release of the game (which is the only one we know about) and features more responsive controls than the original. We couldn&#x27;t find a demo but there is a trailer. Please contact us if you have a demo or any other release.
To play the game with ScummVM, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.
