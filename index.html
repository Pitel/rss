It&#x27;s like I&#x27;m really there
One of the things I love about games is how much they lean into genre fiction. Games have never been afraid to lean hard into sci-fi, fantasy, westerns, apocalypse stories, and so on. This means we get a lot of stories that stand out with their unique characters, mechanics, and lore, but one of my favorite aspects of games has to be how settings take on a whole personality of their own. Rather than serving as a backdrop for the action, so many game settings take a front seat in the story, driving home its themes and moving the plot forward.
Perhaps my favorite example of great settings in games comes from the BioShock series. Cities like Rapture and…</span>

                              <span>Early development underway with Unreal Engine 5
Not to be confused with a certain high-profile Super Smash Bros. Brawl mod, Project M from NCSOFT is an upcoming Unreal Engine 5-developed, console-bound &quot;interactive movie experience&quot; with an eye-catching trailer. I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m exactly picturing a full-fledged game yet from this limited proof-of-concept, but the premise of a &quot;man seeking vengeance&quot; — combined with these high production values — speaks to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;1SApk_2ktfg
The footage is heavy on the &quot;is revenge ever really worth it&quot; theme? and shows a few action sequences that would look at home in one of Supermassive&#x27;s cinematic horror adventures like The Quarry. For some players, there&#x27;s not enough interactivity, but I don&#x27;t mind as long as the pacing is tig…</span>

                              <span>You could help test the long-awaited online campaign co-op
Halo fans who have been waiting for Infinite to get some campaign co-op might not have to wait much longer. 343 Industries announced its going to test out online Halo Infinite campaign co-op in July.
The test flight will be for Halo insiders, 343&#x27;s program for experimenting and getting feedback on Halo games. These public flights offer a chance to test things out, stress them a bit, and provide some feedback to the team.
If you&#x27;re hoping to get some network co-op in, you&#x27;re able to sign up for the program here on the Halo Waypoint.
https://twitter.com/Halo/status/1534233991972257792
Keep in mind, this is just the insider test that&#x27;s rolling out in July. 343 Industries is still targeting later this year for the official launch of campaign co-op. And note that that&#x27;s network campaign co-op, too, so no split-screen just yet.
Carrying on the fight
Campaign co-op has been an elusive addition for Halo Infinite. First it slipped the launch window, then was pushed into 2022, and now it seems to be aiming for an August launch.
The Forge, Halo&#x27;s extensive custom map and content creation tool, has also been pushed back a few times as well. At least with test flighting on the way for co-op, odds seem good that 343 Industries is closing in on a launch.
That might help 343 set a better tone for Halo Infinite moving forward too. The post-launch rollout has had some bumps, with the team acknowledging a &quot;bumpy start&quot; to Halo Infinite Season 2 last month.
Campaign co-op and the Halo series are synonymous for me, so it&#x27;s safe to say that the full launch of online campaign co-op would definitely get me to boot Infinite back up. The latest Halo has been something I enjoy going back to every couple of months for a few quick matches of Team Slayer and Big Team Battle, but I&#x27;d love to see 343 finally roll out the heavy hitters it&#x27;s been working on.

The news was shared on social media today, confirming a new look at Midnight Suns will be in the Summer Game Fest Live show. SGF kicks off on June 9 at 11 am. PT / 2 p.m. ET.

The social account for Midnight Suns is also doing a skin code giveaway for the game. Liking or retweeting this post will net you a code for a new hero being revealed during tomorrow&#x27;s event. I can verify it works, though it didn&#x27;t give me any hints as to who it&#x27;s for in the message.

                              <span>Diablo Immortal is being pilloried by players for the price of its microtransactions, and for how closely tied your progress is to spending real money. One player on the game&#x27;s Reddit page has suggested that it would cost between $50k-$80k (around £39k-£64k) to fully max out a character in the free-to-play action RPG. Meanwhile, the game&#x27;s director has been responding to feedback on Twitter in an attempt to address those &quot;not liking a game based on misinformation surrounding it.&quot;

                              <span>One of my favourite gaming keyboards is discounted at Amazon UK today. The Logitech G915 Lightspeed TKL is an ultra-slim, low profile mechanical keyboard that feels like the best laptop keyboard you&#x27;ve ever used. Lightspeed means Logitech&#x27;s reliable 2.4GHz wireless, while &#x27;TKL&#x27; stands for tenkeyless, a compact design that ditches the numpad for superior ergonomics and longer battery life. 
Altogether, it&#x27;s a beautifully-designed mechanical keyboard, with a high price point being the only strike against it - and despite that, the full-size G915 has been our &#x27;best wireless keyboard&#x27; recommendation for three years running. Today though, the G915 Lightspeed TKL is down to £109 after a £90 discount, making it an excellent time to upgrade your setup with a swanky new keyboard.

                              <span>Logitech make some of the best gaming kit in the business, and right now their G Pro X wired gaming headset is going cheap on Amazon. It debuted at £110 but now costs £57, nearly half-off its UK RRP. This headset distinguishes itself with a comfortable design, good neutral sound and a choice of leatherette or velour ear pads - with the latter being a godsend for spectacle-wearers like myself.

                              <span>Owning Halo Infinite is like having a subscription to a magazine where each issue has part of a model stuck to the front. The first issue brought the game&#x27;s multiplayer modes, the second issue brought its singleplayer campaign, the third issue finally fixed its Big Team Battle mode, and the fourth issue - by which time you&#x27;ve possibly lost interest - will bring online co-op for its campaign.

If you&#x27;re one of those still reading this metaphorical magazine, you can get beta access to the co-op mode this July if you sign up to Halo Insider.

                              <span>Is there a name for the subgenre of games divided into little levels where you try, die to a seemingly impossible challenge, instantly retry with a button press, die, then retry and die over and over until you nail it and feel like an absolute champion? Disc Room is one of those games, and it&#x27;s a good one. First released in 2020, it hit Game Pass this week, inviting more folks to dodge through a giant alien spaceship filled with buzzsaws. I certainly recommend having a go and discovering what your insides look like.

                              <span>When I look outside my window, I often see our two cats scrabbling up our back wall as they hop over the fence to visit the neighbour&#x27;s garden. Up and down they go, covering distances seemingly impossible for their tiny, wiry frames, yet without coming to any harm whatsoever. It&#x27;s an instinct the team at BlueTwelve Studio know all too well, having modelled their unnamed cat protagonist in their debut adventure game Stray after a couple of their own feline companions - and colleagues, it turns out.
&quot;About 80% of the team are cat owners, or are being owned by a cat depending on how you see it,&quot; says producer Swann Martin-Raget. &quot;We actually have two cats that are joining us almost everyday at the office and are working with us. The main character is based on one of the director&#x27;s cats called Murtaugh. He&#x27;s not an exact copy, but he&#x27;s the main reference. We also have Oscar, who is a Sphynx, a furless cat, so he&#x27;s a very good reference for animation because we can clearly see all the movements. We also have a lot of strays that we&#x27;ve adopted, but yeah, we definitely are huge cat lovers and these animals are fascinating to us.&quot;

A site called Try Hard Guides say they’ve allegedly received early footage of the game, which is called Overdose. Details are very thin on the ground otherwise, but hey, Koj has been teasing a new horror game for months now, so maybe we&#x27;ll see something emerge from the mists during one of this week&#x27;s notE3 streams.

It&#x27;s an interactive story you control with split-second decisions and quick time events; it is mostly plot. Broadly, it is the story of a group of camp counselors, one night in a quarry-based summer camp, and how baffling organisational choice can lead to ruin.

                              <span>Going into my chat with Steve Piggott and Rasmus Löfström of Torn Banner Studios, I thought I had a reasonable grasp of the developer’s trajectory up to that point. After finding success in 2012 with their breakout hit Chivalry: Medieval Warfare, Torn Banner had gone on to compose the difficult second album Mirage: Arcane Warfare – an Arabian Nights-inspired take on Chivalry’s multiplayer melee combat. Mirage had not been as well-received as Chivalry, yet despite this stumbling block, the studio had found its feet again with Chivalry 2, a souped-up sequel to their earlier work with more nuanced combat, bigger maps, and support for 64-player battles.
It turns out that, while broadly correct, I wildly underestimated Torn Banner’s reversal of fortunes. In the five years between the launch of Mirage and Chivalry 2’s impending Steam release, Torn Banner has gone from a studio on the brink to being more successful than its leadership ever imagined.

Since last week&#x27;s gameplay reveal for Street Fighter 6, spotlit as a part of Sony&#x27;s State of Play showcase, publisher Capcom has been drip-feeding new clips and info regarding the flashy-looking fighting sequel.
We&#x27;ve already seen — and I should add officially seen — footage on several new and familiar faces in action, and even gotten a sneak peek at the new fight intros and interactive Vs screens. In regards to lore, Capcom has also confirmed that Street Fighter 6 is set after Street Fighter III, and thus represents the most recent chronological entry in the lore of the World Warriors.

Activision is unveiling more details about its next Call of Duty today. Amid the Modern Warfare II news, there were also some new details about the upcoming Warzone experience, dubbed Warzone 2.0. It&#x27;ll be using new tech and gameplay, and that means some old stuff like player inventory will need to stay in the old Warzone.
Development on the new Warzone experience will take the game into the same engine behind Modern Warfare II itself. As part of this, Warzone 2.0 will feature new content and systems with &quot;brand-new progression and inventories.&quot;

Warzone 2.0 is set to launch later this year, sometime between the launch of Modern Warfare II on Oct. 28 and the end of the calendar year. But if you want to keep playing with…</span>

The Call of Duty series has seen a lot of changes over the years. With every entry in the series, the franchise evolves in one way or another, especially with three different studios to make their own mark on the series&#x27; legacy. Now with the October 28 release of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II (not to be confused with the 2009 game with the same name), Activision is looking to overhaul the series by adding a whole host of new features to go along with the reboot, as reported by Polygon.
A new engine
Probably the biggest change coming for Call of Duty is a brand new engine. Because the CoD games are developed separately by three different studios -- Sledgehammer Games, Infinity Ward, and Treyarch -- Activision wanted to make sure that all of the games moving forwa…</span>

                              <span>John Smith, 1882?
Focus Entertainment has announced an official release date for its gory, gothic shooter Evil West. This grisly and alternate take on undead life in the American Frontier will hit PC and console platforms September 20.
Developed by studio Flying Wild Hog, who sure know their way around an exploding head or three, Evil West sees players don the hat and poncho of a lone gunslinger, one of the last remaining members of a clandestine monster-hunting society. As a terrifying and bloodthirsty battalion of vampires, ghoulies, and legions of the undead emerges to lay waste to the Old West, it is up to our hero to lay down a law that goes way beyond a sheriff&#x27;s badge, and put these decaying varmints back in the ground. Permanently.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;2O35NOsTIoE
One or two players can saddle up for a hyper-violent campaign that will follow our outlaws as they forge a path through America&#x27;s formative towns, cities, and wildlands, facing off against an army of ungodly creatures and offering all a date with oblivion. In typical Flying Wild Hog fashion, Evil West is loaded for bear with a huge arsenal of explosive, anachronistic weaponry, while players will also earn perks and upgrades to help turn the tide of battle in their favor.
It&#x27;s a really cool setup, and I&#x27;m liking what I&#x27;m seeing in both the chaotic, cathartic gameplay and the atmospheric old-west-horror cutscenes. Evil West already looks to be one of those titles that might not be making a huge impact on the radars of the gaming community, but will prove to be one of the year&#x27;s slickest and most compelling shooter experiences.
Evil West launches September 20 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

Atlus is gearing up for the launch of its kinetic and stylish-looking sequel Soul Hackers 2, which is coming to PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms this summer — and for those of you hardened hacker-heads, the publisher has also revealed a cool, (and somewhat pricey), collector&#x27;s edition.
The Soul Hackers 2 Collector&#x27;s Edition, which will be made available to western audiences, includes a physical copy of the game on the platform of your choice, along with several fun additions including an exclusive SteelBook case, a digital soundtrack on a themed USB stick, art cards, a pin badge set, and a Shark key chain, the centerpieces of this edition are a three-inch figurine of the series iconic mascot Ai-Ho, and a cute plushie of Mimi. The set will retail for $199.99 USD.
If you&#x27;re interested in bagging this special edition, then you should mark your calendars for Friday, June 10 at 10:00 PT / 13:00 ET, for this is when Atlus will open pre-orders over on the official Shop Atlus store. The Collector&#x27;s Edition is an online store exclusive and Atlus suggests that quantities for each platform are limited, so set your watch and be online when the pre-orders go live to ensure that you get your name down. While I think the pricing is pretty steep, I have to admit that Mimi plush is very cute.
Soul Hackers 2 launches August 26 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

                              <span>Here&#x27;s a pretty good look at Aionios
So far what we&#x27;ve seen of Xenoblade Chronicles 3&#x27;s locations look on point, and this week Nintendo is showing off more of the world of Aionios.
Shared by way of Nintendo&#x27;s YouTube account (and Twitter), at least one zone has the classic Xenoblade look and feel of a lush water-filled environment (similar to Gaur Plain), and &quot;Aionios&quot; itself is most definitely appropriate nomenclature for a Xenoblade universe. As a reminder, Nintendo describes Aionios as &quot;the rich world where you’ll begin your journey to end the cycle of violence between two opposing nations in Xenoblade Chronicles 3.&quot; Those two nations are Agnus and Keves. Through the clip below, we&#x27;re able to get a glimpse at some of the verticality of exploration, some teases into a few structures that will likely have story ramifications, and of course, several enemy designs.
For me, it&#x27;s hard for the team to really top Satorl Marsh from the first game. It&#x27;s such a gorgeous area and it&#x27;s the first thing I think of when I hear the phrase &quot;Xenoblade Chronicles.&quot; Walking through it was a joy in the original and made me recall some of the best zones from &#x27;90s JRPGs, and going back through it in the Switch edition was a treat.

It&#x27;s not often that I get to talk about Shadow the Hedgehog, so I&#x27;ll definitely take this opportunity and run with it.
Like Waluigi (albeit less lovingly so), Shadow is often seen as an oddity of the universe he&#x27;s in, especially given his insane backstory and penchant for using guns. When juxtaposed to Sonic and most of his &quot;friends,&quot; he sticks out like a sore thumb. His polarizing reaction really doesn&#x27;t need an introduction.
But like all black sheep, he has a legion of fans, and his edgelord nature has been used to great effect in some Sonic media. One of my favorite semi-recent takes was Shadow showing up in the otherwise goofy Sonic Boom as a serious character, only to have Robotnik refer to him as a &quot;fan favorite&quot; and talk about how much p…</span>

                              <span>A shiny new look for Days Gone devs
Bend Studio, the Sony subsidiary behind survival horror wilderness title Days Gone, announced that it has started development on a brand new project — one that it hopes will advance the open-world adventure, excitement, and engagement of its aforementioned monster-bashing biker epic.
&quot;We are currently working on a new IP that includes multiplayer and builds upon the open-world systems of Days Gone, but brings you a whole new world that we are extremely excited to craft for you,&quot; said community manager Kevin McAllister in comments to PlayStation Blog. &quot;We cannot wait to reveal it to you when the time is right.&quot;
The comments come almost a year to the day that Bend Studio announced it would venture into new IP territory for its next project, news that came as something of a consolation prize to the controversial story that a Days Gone sequel was canned by Sony, despite the team feeling very passionate toward the idea of creating one. As I said at the time, you sometimes have to &quot;do the thing to do the thing&quot;, and if Bend delivers a major hit for Sony with this new project, then perhaps the parent company will see to making Days Gone 2 a reality.
In related news, Bend Studio also revealed its new branding, complete with a snazzy new logo. The company has opened up numerous job listings for a wide variety of designers, coders, artists, and animators. You can check out the vacancies over on the official Bend Studio website.

                              <span>The animated tease is the most interesting part so far
So the unveiling of Sonic Frontiers gameplay didn&#x27;t really go as planned for Sega, but they did tease an interesting departure from the open world formula: animated story sequences. Thanks to a new Sonic Central stream, we got a small tease of Sonic Frontiers story details.
There&#x27;s two teases afoot, actually, both in the same day. One comes from the latest IGN video, which provides a snippet of the story:
&quot;After flying into a wormhole with Tails and Amy, Sonic finds himself separated from his friends and all alone on an isolated island, with nothing but an AI voice guiding him to collect the Chaos Emeralds.&quot;

So the obvious takeaways here are that Tails and Amy are a part of Frontiers, and that we possibly won&#x27;t get an overload of &quot;friends.&quot; Remember the tenuous original story tidbit shared by Sega back during the announcement, too, which was subsequently removed from Polygon&#x27;s report due to Sega deeming it &quot;incorrect:&quot;
&quot;In Sonic Frontiers, Sonic’s long-time nemesis Dr. Eggman discovers an ancient technology on the Starfall Islands and installs his AI program SAGE to hack in and take over. But there is more to this technology than he realizes, and unintended consequences immediately come to bear. Sonic must race against time to discover the truth, save his friends, and maybe even save himself at the same time.&quot;

The second recent tease comes via a short clip in the Sonic Central stream that&#x27;s literally just a few seconds, we see Knuckles at the top of the stairs seemingly guarding an emerald [probably the master]. The full short will be shared &quot;later this year, prior to the release of Sonic Frontiers.&quot; Remember, this story will be penned by Sonic comic writer Ian Flynn, and right now, it&#x27;s the most intriguing part of this new entry.

The surreal community survival experience The Tomorrow Children returns to PlayStation later this year. Q-Games will launch The Tomorrow Children: Phoenix Edition for PS4 and PS5 in 2022.
The Tomorrow Children first launched in 2016, in partnership with Sony Interactive Entertainment. Yet one year later, the online social action game closed its doors.
In the time since, Q-Games has reacquired the IP of The Tomorrow Children, and now looks to relaunch its game for both a new and returning audience as The Tomorrow Children: Phoenix Edition.

The Tomorrow Children: Phoenix Edition is set to arrive on PS4 and PS5, with some PlayStation 5-specific enhancements.

                              <span>Back to the farm
Nintendo has been struggling to provide Switch Online perks to users for some time, but one such perk is occasional game trials: sparing preview versions of full games during certain windows. The next one will be a Stardew Valley Switch Online trial, limited to Australia, Europe, and Japan currently.
With my European and Japanese Switch accounts (they&#x27;re helpful for reporting!), I was able to see the notification in the &quot;news&quot; sections at the bottom of the Switch UI. The trial will run from June 13 (12:00 JST) through June 19 (17:59 JST). Australia even has an eShop page up for it.
If you somehow haven&#x27;t played Stardew Valley yet, now is the time, provided you&#x27;re able to take part in the trial. It&#x27;s tough to really put into words how magical this game is that hasn&#x27;t already been said, but suffice to say a few hours with it should give you a clue as to whether or not you&#x27;re going to be spending another 100 hours with it.
Also note that you should be able to take advantage of the extra My Nintendo mission points once the trial is live. As a reminder, if you want physical rewards, you can find our full Platinum Point guide here, which has been updated with details on weekly missions: bookmark it for when you need quick points for a reward.

                              <span>A week of tasty tidbits from indie developers
Valve has announced the return of its annual summer tradition, the Steam Next Fest, which will once again offer up a huge selection of trials and demos pulled from a wide variety of incoming indie titles.
From Monday, June 13, Steam users will be able to download and check out &quot;hundreds&quot; of demos free of charge. Valve did not release a full list of the available titles, but a short trailer — which you can check out below — references a huge variety of spunky young developers and publishers, all of whom are no doubt hoping that you will find a few minutes to check out their wares.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;Gnu-nh4NI0Y
According to the above video&#x27;s description, the Steam Next Fest trailer spotlights (deep breath) Arksync, BROK the InvestiGator, Cult of the Lamb, Daydream Forgotten Sorrow, Exophobia, Foretales, Gestalt Steam Cinder, Glimmer in Mirror, Harmony&#x27;s Odyssey, King of the Hat, LEGO Bricktales, Misc. A Tiny Tale, Nine Sols, Eyes in the Dark, Fays Factory, and Ghost Song. Of course, these titles make up just a sliver of the demos that will be spotlit during the event.
Steam Next Fest will end on Monday, June 20, so you have a full seven days to check out as many demos as you choose. As this &quot;non-E3&quot; week is already a pretty busy one in regard to live streams, news, and reveals, it might be hard to find space for &quot;hundreds&quot; of releases, but, hopefully, all interested parties will find at least a few new games to add to your Steam wishlist.

                              <span>Should be live any day now
Although it isn&#x27;t fully live currently, a Fire Emblem: Three Hopes demo popped up on the Nintendo store recently. While it currently errors out if you try and download/access it, the listing clearly points to a demo reveal that will likely happen in the near future, so keep an eye out for it: especially if you pre-ordered already.
Typically, Warriors demos involve several early stages, potential access to the world map, and the ability to free play until a certain point in the game. At that point, you should be able to carry over progress into the full version. So for fans, it should be a meaty dive into what Three Hopes has to offer, and provide a glimpse into the new take on the storyline, as well as any potential gameplay adjustments.
Of course, it&#x27;ll also be an important showcase for something that&#x27;s deeply impacted Warriors games, especially on Switch: performance. While some can live with framerate issues, others can&#x27;t, and Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes demo will need to put its best foot forward if it wants to sell more people on the game leading up to launch. Performance hasn&#x27;t stopped Omega Force and company before, though!
Again, when it goes live, you&#x27;ll find it here, or on the eShop proper.
[Update: Nintendo has confirmed that the Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes demo is live as of 10:00AM ET June 8, 2022! You can play through the game&#x27;s first three chapters, and can carry over progress when it launches. Split-screen two-player co-op is confirmed by Nintendo.]

                              <span>&quot;I think [you] can enjoy the story 100 times more&quot;
Should you play Bayonetta 1 and 2 before 3? Well, you don&#x27;t have to! But producer Hideki Kamiya thinks you should.
We&#x27;ve been through this before in the past. As recently as four months ago, Kamiya noted that folks who played the original two games would get more out of the threequel, which is still slated for later this year. Now he&#x27;s taken to Twitter this week to reiterate that this is still his stance.
Here&#x27;s what he says, roughly translated:
&quot;Somehow I wanted to say this again, but if you are thinking of playing Bayonetta 3, I definitely want you to play Bayonetta 1 and Bayonetta 2 by now ... I think that person can enjoy the story 100 times more.&quot;

Kamiya notes that with the second game, he &quot;intentionally created a story where you can play it in any order&quot; and not be too lost. But with Bayonetta 3, he worked on the story in such a way that he assumes enough people are aware of the series to have played it, and wanted to make the world-building elements &quot;more profound&quot; with that background informing the audience. He goes on to share this &quot;introductory video&quot; of the first two games (which is in Japanese).
Naturally, if Bayonetta 3 is anything like its predecessors, it&#x27;ll stand on its own two feet as an action game, even if you skip the entire story. But I really want to see what the third game has up its sleeve now that we have a full-on universe on our hands at this point.
Kamiya answers the question: &quot;Should you play Bayonetta 1 and 2 before 3?&quot;

While we wait for the next entry in the Dark Pictures Anthology, Supermassive Games is dishing out even more choice-based horror in its familiar cinematic style. And this time, it&#x27;s the big one — the moment fans have been waiting for since Until Dawn. From the outset, The Quarry tries to recapture that lightning in a bottle in terms of scope, story, and execution, and this supernatural end-of-summer-camp adventure hits the mark.
Evil is afoot, and your decisions will once again dictate who makes it to sunrise.

The Quarry (PC [reviewed], PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S)

The Quarry is a standalone new IP — it doesn&#x27;t belong to Bandai Namco&#x27;s Dark Pictures series — but there are so many shared traits. And the refinements are stacking up.

Whenever a Nintendo sports game comes out, I perk up. No, they&#x27;re not all winners. But in the modern era of &quot;solved design&quot; (I&#x27;m using quotes liberally here) and roster-update-centric sports games, and the extreme homogenization of the genre, a silly soccer game with Mario characters in it is going to at least spark some interest on my end. Mario Strikers: Battle League ended up delivering, but there&#x27;s a proviso. Make sure you have some people to play with, or be open to going online.

                              <span>The not-so-Nice Guys
In a week expected to be jam-packed with rumors and leaks, the loudest whispers of the past 24 hours concern Metal Gear creator Hideo Kojima and his studio, Kojima Productions — according to the word around town, the studio is preparing to reveal a brand new horror title, going by the name of &quot;Overdose.&quot;
The rumor was sparked by professional spoiler Tom Henderson, who has an uncanny knack for being very right in these matters. Writing on Try Hard Guides, Henderson claims to have already seen the first teaser trailer for Overdose, which sees a young woman — played by Margaret Qualley of Death Stranding, The Nice Guys, and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood — picking her way through a creepy corridor by torchlight.
While this remains a mere rumor at present, Henderson&#x27;s word has been proven correct on numerous occasions. In fact, (as noted by VGC) Henderson has gone on to claim that Kojima Productions has directly requested the removal of his words, in a tweet that has itself been removed. If Kojima and pals are preparing to reveal Overdose, then one would surmise that we can see it during this season&#x27;s gaming news digest — perhaps during Thursday&#x27;s Summer Game Fest, hosted by Kojima&#x27;s speed-dial buddy Geoff Keighley.
Either way, it&#x27;s exciting news, people have been linking Hideo Kojima to horror for many years, (lest we forget P.T.), and he has already proven he knows his way around a creepy character or two in the Metal Gear and Death Stranding titles. If Overdose exists, then it could prove to be the realization of the scary, Silent Hill-type adventure that has eluded the studio thus far.

                              <span>Meet Apollo, the god of music
Hades is one of my favorite games of all time. It was my go-to game at the start of the pandemic, and after all was said and done I think I put close to 400 hours into that bad boy. I have played and replayed Hades to death, so anything new to help switch it up is a welcome change. Enter Apollo — the Greek god of music who was left off of the game&#x27;s original lineup, but has since been added to the game by way of a mod thanks to AlexKage&#x27;s project, OlympusExtra, which was originally spotted by ResetEra.
The mod adds Apollo to the game as if he were just like any of the other gods, including Boons (solo and duo), a Keepsake, a Wrath (you know, the environmental attack the gods spring on you when you&#x27;re in a two-Boon chamber), and of course, plenty of dialogue. An artist named Reikiix did Apollo&#x27;s portrait, which honestly looks so good you can&#x27;t tell that it wasn&#x27;t part of the base game.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;IbeHCKiDB7M
Apollo&#x27;s specialty is a blinding effect, which makes enemies more likely to miss their attacks. I can imagine that would go really well with Aphrodite or Athena&#x27;s Boons if you want to go for a low-damage or even no-hit run. There are already some videos out there of modders playing with the Apollo mod, so those might be worth checking out if you want to see what he can do to help Zagreus escape the Underworld.
OlympusExtra is still in its early stages — not only will Apollo&#x27;s inclusion of the game be more built out in the future with some more voice lines and duo Boons on the way, but other gods will also be added to the mix, including Hera, Hestia, and Hephaestus. Hades has fostered a huge cult following since its release in 2020, and it&#x27;s great to see the modding community getting in on the action.

Rumors have circled before about a potential 1-2 Switch follow-up from Nintendo. Today, a new report emerged that claims it is real, but it&#x27;s also not testing well.
Fanbyte reports, via sources familiar with the project, that Nintendo has been developing a sequel to 1-2 Switch. The title eventually settled on Everybody&#x27;s 1-2 Switch, and rather than make its predecessor redundant, it reportedly looked to smartphones, inspired by the Jackbox games.
According to Fanbyte&#x27;s sources, several different minigames including musical chairs and Bingo. Yet when it play-tested, it apparently didn&#x27;t play-test well.

However, unlike previous games, this one is free-to-play, and was built from the ground up to be a mobile game first. While it did also come out on PC last week, the reality is this is a very different…

Big (tiny) news! One of our favourite indie games on the horizon just got a new trailer and a bunch of new screenshots, and we&#x27;ve got the exclusive! Misc. A Tiny Tale is a beautiful little gem of a game that was confirmed for Switch last year, and features two tiny robots, Buddy and Bagboy, on an adventure to collect cogs and help out other tiny characters you meet along the way.
You can probably tell just from the way it looks, but developer Tinyware Games has been heavily influenced by Pikmin, Banjo-Kazooie, Super Mario 64, and of course, cult classic Chibi-Robo, creating a 3D platformer that&#x27;s story-driven and character-led, just like the good ol&#x27; days.

Donkey Kong has been a mainstay in the Mario series for an extremely long time. The name was first given to the ape who wreaked havoc in the original Donkey Kong arcade game (who we now know to be Cranky Kong), but the Donkey Kong we now know and love is the son of Donkey Kong Jr.
This dapper tie-wearing ape has been around since Rareware&#x27;s Donkey Kong Country, and he&#x27;s been fighting Kremlings, guarding bananas, and enjoying some sports with his grandfather&#x27;s rival every once in a while ever since. But it sounds like DK&#x27;s family also enjoyed a spot of travelling.

We&#x27;ve been suspecting this for the last few weeks, and it seems like we were right! The Ashen Wolves will be joining the other three houses in the upcoming Musou game Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes.
To celebrate the release of a demo, which dropped today, Nintendo shared another new trailer titled &#x27;Awakened Rivals&#x27;, which shows us the return of Tea Time, some of your character — Shez&#x27;s — moves, and the returning DLC house from Fire Emblem: Three Houses. Unlike the other three houses, the Ashen Wolves won&#x27;t have their own route, but all four members — Yuri, Balthus, Constance, and Hapi — will be back and playable with their own preferred class.

Capcom&#x27;s second Arcade Stadium collection was announced in April, and we&#x27;ve been eagerly waiting to find out what games will be included in the package.
However, it looks like we might not need to wait! Capcom Arcade 2nd Stadium&#x27;s 32 game line-up has potentially been leaked through the Microsoft Store, as reported by our friends at Push Square, and the leak has revealed that there&#x27;s a fair bit of crossover with previous Capcom collections, including the first Capcom Arcade Stadium and the currently unreleased Capcom Fighting Collection.

                              <span>No more. No less.
After Bioware&#x27;s Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic wowed audiences with its in-depth storytelling and RPG mechanics in 2003, publisher LucasArts decided that a sequel would have to be made as soon as possible. Much akin to how Majora’s Mask came out barely a year after Ocarina of Time changed the game, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II was fired out as soon as developer Obsidian Entertainment could possibly make it and released a little less than a year and a half after its predecessor. Considering that an entirely new development team of just seven people took over for this entry while still meeting that narrow deadline, it’s truly a miracle that the final product turned out as good as it did. As a standalone that was evidently rushed to market, KOTOR II may overall feel weaker than its predecessor, but it also does a fantastic job of maintaining the high standards previously set in storytelling and gameplay.
Before we get too into the weeds, we think it bears mentioning that this re-release on modern platforms brings with it the opportunity to finally play the game KOTOR II was originally envisioned as before the demands of the deadline necessitated that the dev team cut content. A free post-launch patch — The Sith Lord Restored Content DLC — is coming which will bring this missing content back by reworking the entire final act of the game with a whole new level, hundreds of bug fixes, adjusted cutscenes, new enemy encounters, and expanded dialogue with important characters. Those of you who have played this in the past on PC may already be familiar with the content (which comes courtesy of a fan-developed mod) but suffice to say this is an exciting new chapter for a game viewed by many as not living up to its full potential in its original form. If you&#x27;re after the &#x27;complete&#x27; KOTOR II package, this re-release will offer that — if not at launch.

Techland has announced that its parkour survival horror game Dying Light is getting a brand new release! Dying Light: Definitive Edition has been announced and is out on consoles tomorrow, but Switch owners will have to wait a bit longer to get their hands on this definitive package.
Originally released in 2015, Dying Light was praised for its controls and its multiplayer, and the developer has continued to support the game up to today. The sequel, Dying Light 2 Stay Human — also due for a Switch release via the cloud this year — launched earlier this year with a more-expansive world and tons of quests.

A demo for the upcoming murder mystery game Yurukill: The Calumniation Games is now available on the Switch eShop!
NIS America and Izanagi Games&#x27; visual novel combines reading, murder, and shmup segments for a completely unique experience. The demo will take players through the first few hours of the game, which means you&#x27;ll get a taste of what you might expect from the full release. We say might because, with these kinds of games, you can never tell what you&#x27;re going to get, but we&#x27;re excited to get some hands-on time with the shmup segments to see just how everything blends together.

It&#x27;s been five whole years already since Nintendo&#x27;s Fire Emblem and Koei Tecmo&#x27;s Warriors series first collided, resulting in the rather magnificent Fire Emblem Warriors, a game we called &quot;one of the best Musou outings yet&quot; that &quot;combines enjoyable combat with real-time tactics, faithfully paying tribute to the two franchises it fuses together.&quot;
Yes, we may have been somewhat concerned in the run-up to 2017&#x27;s hack-and-slash spectacular, fearing that we&#x27;d get little more than a bog-standard Musou effort with a quick Fire Emblem reskin, but our fears proved unfounded as Omega Force and Team Ninja managed to serve up a delightful melding of two unexpected bedfellows. Here was a game that successfully took the strategy and relationship elements of Nintendo&#x27;s turn-based tactical RPG and fused them with the OTT action of Koei Tecmo&#x27;s long-running Musou franchise, resulting in a delightful experience that sits alongside the likes of Hyrule Warriors as the very best the genre has delivered in the past ten years.

                              <span>Violence is apparently the answer.
Name a sport. Go on, name one. Now presumably you’ve chosen some obscure sport that Mario hasn’t played because you saw where this bit was going, but that doesn’t change the fact that our red plumber chap hasn’t been in a hell of a lot of sports games — he mainly sticks to golf, with a little baseball on the side. Mario Strikers: Battle League attempts to carry on the legacy of the much-beloved Strikers series, but does this third entry achieve the hat-trick we’d all love to see?
When you boot up the game you’ll be presented with various modes. Quick Battle allows you to jump into a game right away, setting the duration, how skilled the CPU is, whether or not you want items and/or Hyper Strikes to be enabled (more on those later), and whether the game should take place in the daytime or at night. This is the basic mode that most people will bust out when playing with friends, and thankfully you can do so on a single console (with up to eight players at a time), local wireless, and over that new-fangled internet that you might have heard of. If you want to play a quick game of Strikers, this is likely where you’ll go.

Minecraft has already had a fair bit of experience away from its sandbox building origins. Minecraft Dungeons saw the blocky behemoth take to dungeon crawling, and Steve even jumped ship and made an impact in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.
Now it looks like the biggest video game in the world could be dabbling in the real-time strategy genre. Jeff Gerstmann — formerly of Giant Bomb — spoke about this upcoming Minecraft game in development over on his Twitch channel. Gerstmann said that the game was in testing at the time he saw it, and it puts players in control of a human-ish character who can give orders to other characters to fight off your typical Minecraft enemies:

Beelieve it or not, there&#x27;s a game on the way that&#x27;s all about our honey-making, pollinating friends, the humble bumblebee. It&#x27;s called APICO, and it&#x27;s a simulation game that tasks you with the running of an apiary — that&#x27;s a house for bees — and discovering all the bee species along the way.
As part of the announcement, developer TNgineers have also revealed a limited edition cushy, fluffy, fleecy bee plushie called Beeatrice. She&#x27;s beeing funded through Makeship, which means you have just 17 days to decide if you want to buy one before she&#x27;s gone forever!

A self-proclaimed Sonic fanboy, Alejandro has now taken to Twitter to share his take on what Shadow the Hedgehog would sound like if he were to do the voice acting. We have to say, it&#x27;s pretty awesome!

Following a series of video game company acquisitions made by Saudi Arabia&#x27;s Public Investment Fund recently, the state-run wealth fund has now spent $1.05 billion to purchase an 8.1% stake in Embracer Group.
That stake will make the PIF&#x27;s Savvy Gaming Group the second-largest shareholder in Embracer, according to Bloomberg. This follows recent investments by the PIF and its subsidiaries in gaming companies such as Capcom (5%), SNK (96%), and Nintendo (5%).

                              <span>The US Copyright Office&#x27;s inquiry on the option to add mandatory copyright protection measures in the DMCA has led to some interesting responses. They include a suggestion to add &quot;VPN detection&quot; tools to prevent people from engaging in &quot;geo-piracy&quot;. This request, unsurprisingly, comes from a company that offers a VPN detection service.

In a message from Oda yesterday, the mangaka announced the hiatus of the series will follow chapter 1053, which is scheduled to hit on June 26. At that time, no new chapters of One Piece would be available for an entire month, an almost unprecedented length of time for the pirating adventures, save for a similar gap when the series made a two-year time skip in the…</span>

Operatives everywhere toured Chernobyl&#x27;s dilapidated theme park in nothing but a ghillie suit, stumbled through the residual radioactive smog of a detonated nuclear warhead, stormed a Kazakhstan stronghold under intense blizzard cover, and saved the world with a single, well-aimed throwing knife.

Today, however, Techland revealed that its support for Dying Light is coming to a close, but not without one last surprise. The studio rounded up all of its support for the game in a brand new Dying Light: Definitive Edition that&#x27;s out tomorrow.

That’s because Nintendo announced Three Hopes has a demo available to download now.

What’s more, your progress carries over to the full game once purchased. 
Nintendo also released a new Awakened Rivals trailer to coincide with today’s news, and it features new looks at gameplay, in-game systems and mechanics, playable characters, and much more. Check it out for yourself below: 


“Step into the shoes of Shez as you join Fire Emblem: Three Houses characters, such as the Ashen Wolves, in epic, real-time battles across Fódlan,” the trailer’s description reads. “The house you choose will bring you through one of three compelling stories set in the Fire Emblem: Three Houses universe, each with a different outcome.”

                              <span>A new gameplay trailer for Deliver Us Mars, the sequel to Deliver Us The Moon, has taken off. The video provides looks at how players will traverse and survive the red planet, as well as the launch date they’ll get to do so.
Deliver Us Mars is coming on September 27. The space-faring adventure stars Kathy Johanson, an astronaut who enlists on a mission to Mars to locate stolen colonization vessels in search of a way to restore a dying Earth. She’s also chasing a mysterious signal that may be linked to her long-lost father. 


Like the first game, players will split time between solving environmental puzzles as well as platforming. The video shows Kathy scaling cliffs and other structures with her climbing ax, and the game also features scuba diving and zero gravity exploration. In addition to trekking across Mars’ dusty terrain, players will explore icy landscapes as well as interiors of ruined vessels and abandoned colonies. 
Deliver Us Mars will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC for $29.99. Publisher Frontier says to expect more information on the game at the PC Gaming Show on June 12.</span>

                              <span>After a teaser trailer last year, DC and Warner Bros. Pictures have finally released an official trailer for its Black Adam movie starring Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson.
Featuring arguably one of the brightest color palettes in all of the DCEU, this trailer provides some backstory to the anti-hero that is Black Adam before showcasing the strength of this character. And that strength is enough to seemingly rival Superman as Black Adam doesn’t so much as break a sweat when up against baddies, missiles, crowbars, and more. Check it out for yourself below: 


As you can see, this trailer explains how Black Adam came to be. Nearly 5000 years ago, some bad people enslaved the man who would become Black Adam. Those same people then killed him, but somehow, his son sacrificed his life to help his father become Black Adam – an ancient god bestowed with mighty powers. However, just as quickly as he gained those powers, he was imprisoned. The trailer reveals that in the modern-day, he is somehow freed from the tomb and ready to “unleash his unique form of justice on the modern world.” 
That unique form of justice will likely put him up against or on the paths of Aldis Hodge’s Hawkman, Noah Centineo’s Atom Smasher, Sarah Shahi’s Adrianna, Marwan Kenzari’s Ishmael, Quintessa Swindell’s Cyclone, Bodhi Sabongui’s Amon, and Pierce Brosnan’s Dr. Fate. The director of Jungle Cruise, which also starred Johnson, Jaume Collet-Serra, is the director behind Black Adam. 
DC’s Black Adam hits theaters internationally on Oct. 19. It hits U.S. theaters two days later, on Oct. 21. For more, watch this teaser trailer from last year.

Soccer is considered by many the world&#x27;s most beautiful game. There&#x27;s an elegance to the way players pass, score, and celebrate during their time on the pitch. While Mario Strikers: Battle League may share foundational DNA with its real-world inspiration, it focuses more on brutality over beauty. 
The setup for Battle League is simple: Players choose from the familiar suite of Mario, Luigi, and the rest of the Mushroom Kingdom, assembling teams of four controllable characters and an A.I. goalie. From there, you descend into customizable arenas in front of rowdy fans a…</span>

                              <span>Flying Wild Hog’s Evil West, not to be confused with Weird West from earlier this year, finally has a release date and it’s just a few months away. 
More specifically, Flying Wild Hog and publisher Focus Entertainment will release Evil West on Sept. 20. This news comes by way of a fancy new release date reveal trailer that you can watch below. It’s worth watching, too, because it looks great, complete with plenty of turn-of-the-century action, gore, and western antics. Oh, and monstrous vampires – can’t forget about those. 


“Jump right into frantic, gory carnage in a vampire-infested Wild West as the trailer introduces gunslinger Rentier on his mission to eradicate the supernatural terror,” a press release reads. “As the star agent in his father’s undercover monster-hunting organization, his fight is also a personal war against the nightmarish leading figures in the vampire world. Take on Jesse’s role as the final line between humanity and the vampire threat, rise up to become a Wild West superhero and save the United States.” 
Evil West will feature third-person action gameplay with an arsenal of guns and other weapons. It hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on Sept. 20. 

For more about Wild West, watch its premiere trailer for The Game Awards 2020 and then check out this gameplay trailer from last year’s Game Awards show.

Newegg dropped their price on the EVGA Supernova 1000 G6 PSU to $140, and Amazon followed suit soon after. That&#x27;s $50 below the usual price of $190, and a historic low for this model.

We&#x27;ve seen price drops on the higher-end models recently, as next-gen GPU rumours have begun to build steam, but this is the first time I&#x27;ve seen a great mid-range option receive the same treatment so I thought it was worth writing about!

                              <span>There have been more auspicious PC game launches than that of Diablo Immortal. Originally revealed to a booing crowd as a mobile-only, MMO-styled take on the APRG series, its later-announced Windows release has revealed the full extent of a F2P monetisation system that ties immensely powerful Legendary Gem upgrades to costly loot boxes. Not a great look, especially coming from a company facing multiple lawsuits, staff walkouts and sexual harassment allegations.


Strictly speaking, the PC version of Diablo Immortal is in open beta, with only the mobile version launching as the finished article. The good news is that this leaves more room for the technical issues and oversights I’ve encountered to be fixed; the bad news is that they exist in the first place, and range from absent PC settings staples to repeating performance hiccups.

                              <span>Most video games about cards are deck-building strategy games. Digitised Magic The Gathering-likes. Card Shark is a card game about playing cards, and, more specifically, about cheating at playing cards. When I previewed it I said that it turned out I was quite good at cheating, but now I have played the full build I can report that I&#x27;m bad at that, too. The worst I can say about Card Shark is that it doesn&#x27;t make failure fun.

The confirmation means that the KWS Edmonton United group become the first games industry professionals to unionise in Canada. Their decision follows on from the Game Workers Alliance group’s successful vote last month to unionise at Actvision Blizzard subsidiary Raven Software in Wisconsin, the first notable such group in the US to do so.

                              <span>The Ni No Kuni series has always been beautiful. With its Studio Ghibli-esque styling, imaginative character designs and amazing music made by the legend that is Joe Hisaishi, its world is a true joy to immerse yourself in. It’s why I’m ultimately so disappointed by Cross Worlds. Netmarble has taken this pure, effervescent fantasy dream land and pushed it off the monkeybars into a steaming pile of gacha mechanics and crypto currencies.
To be fair, it’s not all bad. Some of it is great even, but I’ve jumped between loving and hating so many different bits over my last week with the PC beta that ultimately I’m just sad. There’s a wonderful glimpse of something amazing that just never materialises as the mirk of mobile-based gameplay is just too thick to get through.

                              <span>Summer Game Fest organiser Geoff Keighley has advised people tuning in to this Thursday’s showcase not to expect any “megaton shock” game announcements. The stunning revelation that maybe you shouldn’t expect too many brand-new AAA game reveals following a global pandemic came through an audio broadcast on Twitter Spaces over the weekend, transcribed by VGC. “We’ve got lots of good stuff to show you,” Keighley said, “but buyer beware of some of the crazy rumours I’m seeing out there in terms of things people expect to get announced.”

Don’t worry if you own one edition and not the other though: Mojang have confirmed that players will receive access to whatever edition they don’t own in the coming days, free of charge. Both editions can be accessed from the Minecraft launcher. They’ll retain their respective features and stay separate from one another.

                              <span>...And the clock&#x27;s ticking, dude
As part of the Limited Run Games summer showcase, wherein the retailer revealed its long laundry list of physical releases for 2022-2023, it was announced that Dotemu&#x27;s cool-looking brawler TMNT: Shredder&#x27;s Revenge will be getting a hard copy on PS4, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.
All three versions will include a disc/cart-based copy of Shredder&#x27;s Revenge, a full-color art booklet, a set of character stickers, a reversible cover, and, in a nice little throwback, a voucher for a free personal pan pizza at participating branches of Pizza Hut. This neat bonus is, of course, a throwback to the release of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2: The Arcade Game on NES, which also included a free pizza with each purchase!

It seems like Limited Run really had to pull some strings and do some serious organizing in order to get the pizza tie-in promotion on board, and as such, the offer is only redeemable at North American outlets and is tied exclusively to the Limited Run edition of TMNT: Shredder&#x27;s Revenge. Still, it&#x27;s a very cute, unique, and nostalgic freebie, especially for those who can actually eat pizza, unlike your feather-stomached boy Moyse. Regardless, pre-orders are now live on the Limited Run Games store.
While no images were shown, Limited Run also has a full Collector&#x27;s Edition of the cartoon brawler in the works, which will include all of the above gubbins along with a Playmates figure of Shredder himself, replicated from the megaselling 1990s toy line. More details on this edition will be revealed in the near future.
TMNT: Shredder&#x27;s Revenge launches 2022 on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.

                              <span>Something to look forward to
E3 was already struggling before the pandemic hit, so its gradual departure over the past few years seemed to be a long time coming. While it may not have taken anyone by surprise, it was still pretty sad to see an event that had become such a staple of the gaming industry close its doors indefinitely. We&#x27;ve had plenty of other news streams to keep us busy, but it just hasn&#x27;t quite been the same. So naturally, we&#x27;re pretty excited to hear from the Entertainment Software Association (the organization that runs E3) that the event will be back fully in person in 2023 after three years, as they told The Washington Post.
As ESA president and CEO Stan Pierre-Louis told the site: &quot;We’re excited about coming back in 2023 with both a digital and an in-person event. As much as we love these digital events, and as much as they reach people and we want that global reach, we also know that there’s a really strong desire for people to convene—to be able to connect in person and see each other and talk about what makes games great.&quot;

E3 had already been in a transition period before the pandemic hit — the event had been struggling with attendance and its own identity for years. They were making big changes, like allowing fans to attend what was previously a trade-only event in 2015, but even that wasn&#x27;t enough to keep them afloat with many of the large companies opting for their own solo press conferences.
While it can be a lot of fun to have one huge event to look forward to every year, some have considered the benefits of sunsetting E3 for good, like more games being able to stand out when the press is paced more evenly throughout the year, rather than being dumped on us all at once.
As an LA local, I&#x27;d love to be able to go in person again for E3 2023, but I know for others it&#x27;s not that simple. I guess now it&#x27;s just a waiting game to see if the ESA actually pulls through on this one.

                              <span>Super Crash Bros.
In the week of summer streamin&#x27;, one can always expect a flurry of leaks and rumors, and 2022 is no exception. Regarding everyone&#x27;s favorite crate-smashing psycho, Crash Bandicoot, the word on the street is that publisher Activision and developer Toys for Bob are preparing to reveal a brand new brawler/platform fighter starring Crash and The Boys... umm...
The rumor was sparked by Window Central writer (and known spoiler) Jez Corden, speaking on a new episode of the Windows Central Gaming Podcast. According to Corden, Toys for Bob is beavering away at the new title, which is expected to be a chaotic platform fighter in the style of games such as MultiVersus, Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl, and, of course, Nintendo&#x27;s Super Smash Bros. While the conversation on the podcast was a little spirited and jokey, there was a clear inference that the title could be revealed during this week&#x27;s run of &quot;non-E3&quot; live streams.
Crash Bandicoot, as a franchise, has certainly gotten to the point where it has enough beloved characters to launch its own fighting game. And given that it has already run the gamut of kart racers, puzzle titles, and mobile spin-offs, it seems that stepping it the ring is one of the few genres left for Crash, Coco, Cortex, and co. are left to conquer. I have already decided that Ripper Roo is my main, and we don&#x27;t even know if he is in the Crash Bandicoot brawler... or even if there is a Crash Bandicoot brawler! I guess we&#x27;ll just have to keep &#x27;em peeled as the week progresses.

Out with the old, in with the new. Nintendo Switch Online Zelda rewards are now live, and you can grab them until July 4 at 6PM PT, when they&#x27;ll be cycled out for something else.
The Switch Online Zelda icons include several Link poses (of course), as well as a smiling Daruk, a Guardian about to destroy someone, Purah, the Zelda logo, and a piece of raw prime meat. Nintendo is putting out the first &quot;wave&quot; through June 13 at 5:59PM PT. After that we&#x27;ll get several more ways until we hit that July 4 marker, and Breath of the Wild rotates out. So if you don&#x27;t find a style you like this week, wait until the next wave! Also, if you&#x27;re interested, you can find the June Animal Crossing villager birthday icons below.
Need points for the Switch Online Zelda icons? As a reminder, if you want physical rewards, you can find our full Platinum Point guide here, which has been updated with details on weekly missions: bookmark it for when you need quick points for a reward. A handful of points is incredibly easy to get, as that’s basically just 15 minutes with Super Mario Run, or a quick sign-on to the 3DS or Wii U 3Shop. Also remember that any shipments are bundled together, so you can pay a flat rate for multiple items instead of paying it each time. Just know that items go out of stock on My Nintendo frequently, and some are never restocked.

Yesterday, Limited Run Games held its annual summer showcase, which was produced by the folk at Mega64 and revealed the boutique retailer&#x27;s upcoming catalog of physical releases. On the agenda were a wide variety of new and old releases, all of which will be making the leap from the digital archives to a whole new world of shelf-filling plastic.
There were familiar brands and IPs such as Shantae, Blade Runner, Doom, Tetris, and Star Wars lined up alongside radical &#x27;80s/&#x27;90s franchises such as TMNT, Bill &amp; Ted, Shadowrun, and even the classic horror adventure, D. Oh, and that PS5 port of Night Trap we all wanted is finally on the way, because that&#x27;s what we bought that $500 console for. Right?

                              <span>Season 1 kicks off in Battlefield 2042 on June 9
More tools for mayhem are arriving on the battlefield. Electronic Arts and DICE debuted a trailer today, showing what&#x27;s coming in Battlefield 2042 Season 1 on June 9, 2022.
In today&#x27;s trailer, the team gives us a good look at Exposure, the new map arriving in Season 1. It&#x27;s set in the Canadian Rockies and looks to make big use of verticality, allowing aircraft and wingsuits to really get around.
Also shown is the new Specialist, Ewelina Lis. Lis is particularly skilled at tackling vehicles, using a remote-controlled rocket launcher to wreak havoc on armor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;2Hfeb7eIzbo
Alongside those, new vehicles and weapons are also coming in Battlefield 2042 Season 1. Two new gunships, the RAH-68 Huron and YG-99 Hannibal, take to the skies. The BSV-M Marksman Rifle offers a new mid-range option. And the Smoke Grenade launcher offers some infantry ground cover.
But good lord, the Ghostmaker R10 Crossbow looks like a blast. Literally, because it has explosive ammo, alongside regular, light, and heavy ammo. The core content additions are available as part of the free Battle Pass track, though it will require playing to unlock. Additional cosmetics are in the Premium Battle Pass Track.
Seasoned veterans
There are also more fixes for stability, balance, gunplay, performance, and more. It looks like DICE is trying to make good on its commitment to improving Battlefield 2042 after its rough launch.
The focus comes at the cost of some initial pillars, like the removal of the 128-player Breakthrough variant. The team also shuttered all future content development for Hazard Zone, its Tarkov-style multiplayer mode, in favor of focusing on its other pillars.
With Season 1 for Battlefield 2042 finally going live, it seems like this could be the time for DICE to rally and try to right the ship. Exploding crossbow bolts are a good start, at least.

                              <span>There are a few PlayStation studios that we haven&#x27;t heard much from in a while, one of which is the Days Gone developers Bend Studio. That changes today with a blog post detailing the history of Bend Studio and giving a tiny hint at what the team is up to with its next project.
The post details the games Bend had developed in its nearly 30-year history, from the first days of the studio when it was known as Blank, Berlyn and Co., through the time it was known as Eidetic when it developed Bubsy 3D, the Syphon Filter series, and beyond. There&#x27;s a lot of great history about the studio packed in there alongside concept art and more. But, what comes next for Bend Studio is a break from any series or franchise it&#x27;s worked on or created before. 
&quot;We are currently working on a new IP that includes multiplayer and builds upon the open-world systems of Days Gone, but brings you a whole new world that we are extremely excited to craft for you. We cannot wait to reveal it to you when the time is right,&quot; writes Kevin McAllister from Bend Studio.
This is the second time Bend has mentioned its new project, with the first word coming from a tweet last year. While the next game from the studio won&#x27;t be Days Gone 2, nor a return to Syphon Filter, it at least looks to be learning and building from those prior works. Additionally, whether this new IP will be part of Sony&#x27;s new initiative to develop more live service games remains to be seen.
Bend Studio also took the opportunity to debut a new logo in the blog post, which you can see above. The logo treatment is a nice change in design from the previous iterations since it&#x27;s now modular and can be fitted into different aesthetics for various occasions.

                              <span>When you look at Metal Hellsinger, it may look like it takes many of the conventions established in games like Doom, complete with the heavy metal soundtrack players associate with the demon-slaying franchise. But with clever implementation of said metal music, Metal Hellsinger looks to transcend the spiritual successor label to become something else entirely.
By combining that fast-paced, frenetic first-person shooting action with rhythm-based mechanics that reward you for shooting in sync with the music, Metal Hellsinger delivers a wholly unique experience. While the gameplay conventions help separate the game from the pack, it&#x27;s perhaps the original soundtrack that is most eye-catching. As you slay your way through the demons of Metal Hellsinger, you do it to original recordings by some…</span>

You can see them right at the start of the Sonic Central stream below:


Sonic Origins contains Sonic the Hedgehog, Sonic the Hedgehog 2, Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles, and Sonic CD. Each game has been fully remastered and includes new features. In addition to different missions you can complete for coins to unlock historical assets from the past, the games can all be played free from the limited lives and in widescreen format, plus new animations have been added to expand on the stories of those original games.
Sonic Origins comes to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on June 23. For more on Sonic Origins, check out our 2021 interview with chief creative officer and head of Sonic Team Takashi Iizuka here.</span>

                              <span>Sega and developer Mediatonic have announced a special collaboration for the popular game-show-style battle-royale game, Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout. The collaboration brings costumes featuring the Blue Blur and his closest friends into the zany multiplayer experience.
Beginning in August, Fall Guys players can take the form of Sonic, Knuckles, and Tails during this new Sonic collaboration. For those unfamiliar with Fall Guys, this is far from the only collaboration the game has ever done, nor is this the first collaboration with the Sonic the Hedgehog brand. The initial appearance of the Blue Blur in Fall Guys came in 2020, but this new collaboration expands the offerings.
Starting June 21, Fall Guys not only comes to new platforms like Xbox and Switch, but it also goes free-to-play across all platforms. Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout originally launched in August 2020 and quickly became one of the most-played multiplayer games.

                              <span>WWE 2K22’s third DLC pack has arrived, calling up a fresh batch of wrestlers to the game’s growing roster.
The pack is appropriately titled “Stand Back” because it’s headlined by The Hurricane. The emerald green superhero is joined by former Diva Stacey Keibler, NXT UK’s A-Kid, and former NXT Tag Team Champion Wes Lee. 


Like past DLC wrestlers, each new face comes with MyFaction EVO cards, including a Booker T and Sapphire Seth Rollins. The Stand Back pack costs $9.99 on its own and is part of the $39.99 Season Pass (included in the Deluxe and nWo 4-Life editions). 
Per the game’s roadmap, the next, and penultimate, content pack arrives on June 28. To learn more about WWE 2K22, check out our review.</span>

                              <span>A massive 1.0 update for Battlefield 2042 is out now on all platforms, and it brings hundreds of changes, bug fixes, and quality of life improvements to the online shooter ahead of its Season 1 launch. 
And speaking of Season 1: Zero Hour, DICE will reveal gameplay today at 8 a.m. PT/11 a.m. ET on its official Battlefield 2042 YouTube channel, as reported by VG247. There, you’ll see a glimpse of these changes and improvements and a look at what the first season of Battlefield 2042 looks like. As for the update, here’s what Dice has highlighted: 
Multiple improvements to soldier gameplay which will result in overall smoother animations and movement.
Weapons received updated netcode to improve bullet hit registration. We’ve also done a further balance pass which includes increased projectile speeds for DMR’s and LMG’s, and improved accuracy for Shotguns.
Multiple new XP events have been added, such as for killing an enemy who recently wounded or killed a squadmate, or when an enemy vehicle you recently damaged is destroyed by a teammate and the occupants are killed
The number of available in-world vehicles has been increased for Conquest which should make it easier to move across the map

                              <span>Blossom Tales 2: The Minotaur Prince is coming this August, and a new trailer shows off the rogues&#x27; gallery of bosses fans can expect to confront in the sequel.
The follow-up to the 2017 Zelda-inspired adventure launches on August 16. Like the first game, players steer an adventurer named Lily through a choice-driven story told by a grandfather to his kids a la The Princess Bride. You’ll hack and slash through dozens of dungeons across both a main story and sidequests. For an idea of the retro-inspired dangers in store, check out the game’s latest trailer. 


Blossom Tales 2: The Minotaur Prince will be available on Switch and PC.</span>

                              <span>Apple nadále pokračuje v převodu svých počítačů z architektury Intel x86_64 na vlastní 64bit čipy Apple Silicon (aktuální řada M1 a čerstvě ohlášená M2). Firma nyní s novým vydáním macOS 13 připravila možnost běhu intelovských binárek pro architekturu x86_64 na svých ARM čipech, a to za pomoci vrstvy Rosetta a virtuálního stroje postaveného na Linuxu. Podrobně vše popisuje Apple na svém webu.</span>

                              <span>Madden NFL 23 is coming in August with some new tech set to change the game entirely on both sides of the ball. Our own Brian Shea recently went hands-on with the latest version of Madden and its game-changing feature FieldSense, which encompasses a variety of changes to gameplay and animations. You can check out a deep dive into everything FieldSense offers in the video above.
FieldSense, which is exclusive to the newest generation of consoles (PS5 and Xbox Series X/S), has a few different aspects that are covered in the video by senior game design director for Madden NFL 23, Connor Dougan. First is a set of new physics-informed animation as well as animation branching technology that brings a more realistic look to the action on the field. New gameplay techniques like 360 Cuts introduce more control for receivers and running backs, while Hit Everything is a feature that affects just about everything on the defensive side of the ball. For Quarterbacks, Skill Based Passing will let players fine-tune where they&#x27;re throwing the ball for more precise passes that can be kept away from pass defenders. There are demonstrations of those new concepts and more in the almost five-minute breakdown.
Madden NFL 23 lands on August 19 this year with the man himself, John Madden, gracing the cover. While FieldSense is only available on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, other versions of the game are also coming to PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.</span>

                              <span>Back at E3 2021, we learned that Plumbers Don’t Wear Ties, one of the strangest FMV games of the ’90s, was getting remastered for modern consoles courtesy of Limited Run Games. Now we know that John, Jane, and Thresher will return later this year. 
The news comes by way of today&#x27;s Limited Run Presents showcase. What the heck is Plumbers Don’t Wear Ties, you ask? The 1993 game is best described as an interactive romantic comedy firmly aimed at adults, thanks to its mild nudity and sexual innuendo. Players guide a plumber named John, who tries to win the heart of a beautiful woman named Jane in an adventure laden with ridiculous hijinks. That includes dealing with an unreliable narrator and confronting a, shall we say, creepy boss. The gameplay involves making simple decisions in a choose-your-own-adventure format and watching live-action cutscenes. 
To editorialize a bit, Plumbers Don’t Wear Ties is absurd and pretty bad. However, as footage of the game found its way on YouTube over the years, the game has found new life as a cult favorite “so bad it’s good” oddity, not unlike Night Trap (which got a similar remaster a few years ago). Since Plumbers Don’t Wear Ties had a limited release on PC and the poor-selling 3DO console, not many folks have been able to play it themselves. 
The Definitive Edition polishes up the adventure with 4K visuals and adds features such as deleted scenes, a progress chart, and new video interviews with the cast. 
Plumbers Don’t Wear Ties: Definitive Edition launches later this year for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. It will be available both digitally and in physical form, thanks to Limited Run Games. If you’re into FMV games, check out this deep-dive feature about the history of the genre.</span>

                              <span>Netflix has started a week-long celebration of its upcoming shows and movies coming to the streaming service, and on today&#x27;s edition of Geeked Week, a new trailer premiered for the new Resident Evil series. Beware, the footage does contain violence, gore, and adult language.


Resident Evil takes place in two time periods, 2022 and 2036, following Jade Wesker (Ella Balinska) before and after the T-Virus is unleashed on the public, causing all kinds of monsters such as zombie people, zombie dogs, and the biggest monster of them all, pharmaceutical corporations. There&#x27;s also a kaiju-sized caterpillar, and that&#x27;s pretty cool too! The series also stars Lance Reddick as Albert Wesker, Tetiana Gaidar, and Connor Gosatti. 
Here&#x27;s a brand new poster for Resident Evil featuring the Licker, an iconic creature that first premiered in Resident Evil 2:
You can start watching Resident Evil on Netflix beginning July 14.</span>

                              <span>Street Fighter 6 made a big splash during its PlayStation State of Play showing last week, revealing two more fighters, some sort of exploration story mode, and more. While we await more details on some of those features, Capcom has divulged some info on Ryu&#x27;s new look and the game&#x27;s place in the Street Fighter timeline.
The game&#x27;s official Twitter account shared a statement by director Takayuki Nakayama that confirms Street Fighter 6 takes place after the events of Street Fighter III. This places the game at the end of the series&#x27; timeline given that Street Fighter V is set before SF 3. 
As for Ryu&#x27;s new look, Nakayama explains his Buddhist robe, also called a kasaya, showcases Ryu&#x27;s newfound dignity despite the warrior feeling he&#x27;s &quot;not there yet.&quot; What that means is up to interpretation, but the attire does pair well with Ryu&#x27;s dashing beard if nothing else. 
&quot;Although Street Fighter 6 occurs after the Street Fighter III series, Ryu still feels that he&#x27;s &quot;not there yet&quot; - though he seems to have gained some dignity. The way he wears the kasaya (Buddhist robe) is reminiscent of his master, Goken.&quot;

                              <span>About nine months after its release, Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl is getting a big patch today, introducing two much-requested features that will hopefully make the brawler feel like a more well-rounded product. Developer Ludosity has announced it&#x27;s finally adding character voices and items to the game today.
Alongside voice acting and items, here are the latest patch notes! pic.twitter.com/gfTHwtz4Tj
June 6, 2022
Paired with some substantial character balance adjustments and stage changes, Nick Brawl&#x27;s fighters will now have voices, with many of the original actors for these characters reprising their roles. This includes what looks to be a big rework of Sandy, which you can see in the embedded tweet above. Here&#x27;s the complete cast list as revealed by the Nick Brawl Twitter account: 
Jim Cummings: Shredder / CatDog (Cat)
Tom Kenny: Spongebob / CatDog (Dog)
Bill Fagerbakke: Patrick
Carolyn Lawrence: Sandy
Alex Cazares: Oblina
Jim Meskimen: Nigel Thornberry
Richard Horvitz: Zim
Vivian Vencer: Toph
Dustin Sardella: Aang
Janet Varney: Korra
Fred Tatasciore: Reptar
Bentley Griffin: Lincoln Loud
Jessica DiCicco: Lucy Loud
Franchesca Marie Smith: Helga
Townsend Coleman: Michelangelo
Cam Clarke: Leonardo
Abby Trott: April O&#x27;Neil
Frank Welker: Garfield
Billy West: Ren &amp; Stimpy
David Kaye: Powdered Toast Man
David Kaufman: Danny Phantom
Janice Kawaye: Jenny
With the entire cast getting voiced, it&#x27;s safe to assume upcoming characters Hugh Neutron and Rocko will receive the same treatment. As stated before, items are also joining the game, but there&#x27;s almost no detail on what those items may be or what they do in battle. We&#x27;ll just have to play to find out.
The new Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl patch hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC today, with the Switch update coming later. PlayStation Plus members can claim a free copy of Nick Brawl until the end of June as part of the PS+ monthly game offerings alongside God of War and Naruto to Boruto: Shinobi Striker.</span>

                              <span>Last weekend&#x27;s Pokémon Go Fest delivered two days of catching fun, along with the debuts of Nihilego and Shaymin within the mobile game. Now, Pokémon Go and the Pokémon Trading Card Game are crossing over with events that will touch both games. For Pokémon Go, the event begins on June 16 and brings the chance to catch Wimpod and a new version of Pikachu wearing a TCG hat.
For the Pokémon Trading Card Game, the next expansion is themed around Pokémon Go, and will feature cards based on Team Mystic, Instinct, and Valor. We&#x27;ll have to wait to see just how many of the cards are true crossovers, but no matter what, it&#x27;s great seeing these two popular games work together.
For the mobile trainers out there, Wimpod is one of those Pokémon that requires 400 candies to evolve. When this number is hit, Wimpod evolves into Golisopod. The creature that looks a bit like a dead fish transforms into one of the coolest Godzilla-like beasts in all of Pokémon.
This event also sees Mewtwo returning to five-star raids. All Mewtwo caught from June 16 to June 23 will have the Shadow Ball charged attack. Those caught from June 23 to July 1 will have the Psystrike charged attack.
If you use the Mystery Box during the event, you&#x27;ll have the chance to catch a Shiny Meltan. The Mystery Box is only obtained by sending a Pokémon to Pokémon Home or Pokémon: Let’s Go, Pikachu! or Pokémon: Let’s Go, Eevee! It&#x27;s a bit of a hassle to get the Box, but it&#x27;s well worth it, as Meltan is great for battling.</span>

                              <span>Summer Game Fest kicks off in earnest this week, and one of the biggest presentations will be the Xbox &amp; Bethesda Games Showcase on June 12. If you watch the show and find yourself clamoring for more information, Microsoft has announced an extended version of the presentation a couple of days later.
On June 14, the Xbox Games Showcase Extended airs at 10 a.m. Pacific/1 p.m. Eastern. This supplemental event features 90 minutes of new trailers, interviews, and in-depth looks at the titles shown during the Xbox &amp; Bethesda livestream. Xbox Wire describes the presentation as “all-new,” suggesting it may be more substantial than just a rehash of the June 12 event with a few extra tidbits.   
We don’t know what the Xbox &amp; Bethesda showcase has in store, but appearances from Starfield, Forza Motorsport 8, and Redfall seem like solid guesses. You can listen to some of our Game Informer editors pit their predictions against each other in this episode of the Game Informer Show. 
To learn more about what’s happening and when during Summer Game Fest, keep an eye on our evolving showcase streaming schedule.</span>

Today though, Amazon UK has discounted the board to just 80 of your British pounds, a 60% reduction that brings it below some of the best value gaming keyboards. That&#x27;s an awesome price for a full-size UK layout with this kind of tech on board.

                              <span>Hello folks. Sorry it’s been so long since I’ve written one of these Letters From The Editor. Things have been… manic, to say the least. Manic in the traditional ‘busy’ sense (hello Elden Ring, PAX, V Rising and now notE3 planning), but also in the ‘man, there are so many cool things I want to talk to you about but aren’t quite ready to announce yet’ sense. I’ve been on the cusp of writing about these things every single month since, err, March, but then something falls through, the weeks go by, and we’re back to square one again. So I’m sorry about that, I really am. 
What I’m writing to you about today still isn’t one of those exciting things, unfortunately, but it is nonetheless very important. When we relaunched our RPS Supporter Programme last year, we did so on June 17th, which means its one-year anniversary is just around the corner. It also means that those of you who signed up for our yearly supporter tier will be coming to the end of your subscription soon, and I wanted to explain a little bit about the renewal process as it’s… err, a bit convoluted. Sorry again about that.

                              <span>After a night of being offline following the Collision event, Fortnite is back, once again shaking up the norm with new biomes to explore, skins to unlock, and gameplay techniques to master. In the final moments of last night&#x27;s event, we saw Obi-Wan Kenobi locked in combat with Darth Vader. The feared Sith Lord is one of the new skins that is unlockable when you purchase this season&#x27;s battle pass. At a later date in the battle pass bonus tier, archaeologist Indiana Jones will join the fight.
Fortnite Chapter 3, Season 3 is officially called Vibin&#x27;, and true to form, it brings a colorful, party atmosphere to its new story thread and areas of the map. On the eastern coast, you&#x27;ll see two new areas to explore: Rave Cave and Reality Falls. These Biomes feature giant mushrooms to bound across, as well as waterfalls and strange trees to interact with.
The tallest tree is called the Reality Tree and it&#x27;s in full bloom, spreading Reality Seed Pods across the island. If you grab a seed and plant it, a Reality Sapling will grow. If you weed it, you&#x27;ll be rewarded loot. The more times a sapling is uprooted, the better the loot. Yes, you can get Mythic weapons this way.
On the gameplay front, you can now use animals as mounts. If you see a wolf or boar, see if you can catch a ride. Ballers are also back thanks to the reappearance of the Screwballer amusement park ride. The Ballers have more health than before, can float on water, and are battery-operated, meaning you know how long the ride will be.
We&#x27;ll have to wait to see what other surprises and changes await us in Vibin&#x27;, but it&#x27;s off to a great start, and you gotta love seeing Indiana Jones and Darth Vader joining the character ranks.

                              <span>A few months have passed since we released ScummVM 2.5.1.
No matter if you expect the scorching heat of the upcoming summer or freezing blizzards in winter (depending on your favorite hemisphere): it’s release time again!
Our lovely developers added support, yet again, for a bunch of new ancient games that require testing:
Sanitarium
Hades Challenge
Marvel Comics Spider-Man: The Sinister Six
The 11th Hour
Clandestiny
Tender Loving Care (CD-ROM Editions)
Uncle Henry&#x27;s Playhouse
Wetlands
Chewy: Esc from F5
Besides these games, we’d appreciate it if you could check our release testing list - maybe you’ll even find your favorite game on there that has been sitting on that shelf for way too long.
And since ScummVM is about playing games in general, we’ve seen quite a bunch of changes across many, many engines - so this is the perfect time for giving your favorites another go.
The AGOS, SCI and SCUMM engine received some really extensive modifications which make all games using those engines very good testing targets as well.
All testing must be done with stable builds, not development ones. Please report any bugs or oddities on our issue tracker.
A detailed list of all exciting new features and fixes is available in our NEWS file.
Thank you very much for your support!

                              <span>Happy Pokémon Go Fest, trainers! We have two long days of catching Pokémon in front of us. To be a part of this festival, you need to buy the ticket in the in-game item shop for $14.99.
As we complete research challenges that lead to a mythical encounter with Shaymin, we&#x27;ll want to be on the lookout for three Pokémon who are leaving their regions and will only be here for the two days. Those Pokémon are: Tropius, Torkoal, and Galarian Mr. Mime. We&#x27;ll need to use incense to lure all of them out when they appear in their habitats.
As the Fest unfolds, each hour brings a different habitat with different Pokémon to catch. Many can be the rare shiny variant. Here&#x27;s what you will find in each, along with the shiny opportunities:
City:
Plains
Rain Forest
Tundra
Omanyte (shiny)
Swinub (shiny)
Wingull (shiny)
Meditite (shiny)
Wailmer (shiny)

                              <span>Let&#x27;s rock, baby! Season 6 of Video Gameography gets stylish as we examine the Devil May Cry series! Over the next few weeks, we’ll be covering the history and lore of Capcom’s premiere action franchise. This week we start from the beginning as we unpack one of the most influential action games ever, Devil May Cry.
Arriving stateside on October 16, 2001, the game stars Dante, a demon hunter (and half-demon himself) on a mission to stop underworld emperor Mundus from invading the human world. The game began life as Resident Evil 4, helmed by a hotshot young director named Hideki Kamiya who veered the game from survival horror to stylish action. While it proved too drastic of a departure for Resident Evil, Capcom knew they had something and reworked the project into its own franchise. Listen on to learn how Dante was conceived, our thoughts on the game’s story, and how we fared against the game’s legendarily brutal difficulty.

                              <span>Amazon Games has partnered with Disruptive Games, the studio behind Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 1 + 2 and Diablo II: Resurrected, to create a new intellectual property that will release on a variety of machines. Described by Amazon Games as an online multiplayer action-adventure with cooperative and competitive play, this new experience appears to be set in a post-apocalytpic or post-war world. This observation comes from two pieces of concept art that show crashed airplanes that appear to be heavily weathered.
The humans pictured in these artworks hold primitive weapons, such as a rifle with a bayonet. One of the characters appears to have mechanical legs. Several of these beings also wear headsets with tall antenna, likely for cooperative communication.
In a press release, Christoph Hartmann, the vice president of Amazon Games, says we can expect something different from this multiplayer experience. &quot;The talented team at Disruptive Games is creating a fresh take on the multiplayer action-adventure genre, with strong game design and rich world-building that we&#x27;re excited to help bring to players.&quot; 
On Disruptive&#x27;s official website, this new IP is amusingly codenamed &quot;super secret project.&quot; We&#x27;ll have to wait for more details, but the usage of concept art with game title implies it&#x27;s a long way off.</span>

                              <span>Jurassic World Evolution 2 delivers plenty of prehistoric thrills, and will soon get a massive update based on the forthcoming Jurassic World Dominion motion picture, but it isn&#x27;t the only new dinosaur experience on the horizon or that you can play right now.
I scoured the internet for dinosaur titles that are in the works and found five that look promising. The last one on this list is something you can download right now. Here&#x27;s what we can look forward to soon:


Jurassic Architect
. Jurassic Architect is currently in development for PC and looks incredibly ambitious, almost like a sci-fi and prehistoric Sim City. Sadly, no release date has been given.


Deathground


The Lost Wild


Paleo Pines


Dinosaur Fossil Hunter
If you are looking for something you can play on PC right now, Dinosaur Fossil Hunter was released last month, and offers a deep simulation where you are tasked to drive across open worlds to find fossil sites, and then use various gadgets to locate and dig for dinosaur bones. The collections you unearth can then be displayed in your own museum. You get to design all of the displays and arrange how the dinosaurs look.</span>

                              <span>Big things are once again happening in Fortnite. On June 4, players are invited to experience a timed event called &quot;Collision.&quot; This story-driven moment can only be played once and will kick off at 4 p.m. ET. Epic Games says the fate of the Zero point will be decided in this gameplay event, which I believe will lead into Chapter 3, Season 3.
The events in Fortnite are always fun, as they shake up the gameplay, change the environments, and introduce new characters to the battle royale universe. Collision hits just a week after Obi-Wan Kenobi is introduced. A mysterious tower has also appeared in the center of the island.
Epic Games is encouraging streamers and players to record the event, as it won&#x27;t be repeated. The last event brought us The Foundation (played by Dwayne Johnson) and Spider-Man. The island also flipped over and gave us an entirely new map to discover. What will happen this time? The teaser image above gives us a taste of a monstrous return.
If you have the Battle Pass, you have just one week to complete it and get Doctor Strange (and his alternate costumes in the bonus tier). Fly through the missions you can for big XP bumps.
If you log in at any point on June 4 after 8 a.m. ET, you&#x27;ll receive an exclusive loading screen and lobby track for Collision. You&#x27;ll be able to log into the Collision lobby 30 minutes before the event begins.
What do you hope to see from Season 3? Any character skins you are hoping to see added or return?</span>

                              <span>Resident Evil fans have had a lot to celebrate over the years. Biohazard and Village have brought the series back to its horror roots in unique ways. The Resident Evil 2 and 3 Remakes have been a perfect way to relive the glories of the past with contemporary improvements. But what comes next? Resident Evil 4 Remake is the answer, and we&#x27;re pouring over every detail of the new trailer in today&#x27;s spoiler-filled breakdown.


Alex Stadnik is your host for the video and welcomes Resident Evil 4 superfan Blake Hester to dissect every nook and cranny of Capcom&#x27;s surprise announcement from the latest Sony State of Play. As stated above, we go into a lot of spoilers of the original game, so if you haven&#x27;t played it yet, please bookmark this video and come back.
The boys kick things off by discussing their levels of surprise when the fourth entry in the iconic series makes its first appearance. They then break the trailer down scene by scene, letting you know what they think will be different and what will stay the same. They also ponder if the remake will feature a character similar to Mr. X, Nemesis, or Lady D instead of creating a straight one-to-one recreation. Finally, they wrap by discussing whether or not the game will get delayed and what their levels of hype are after seeing Leon&#x27;s return.
Are you excited about Resident Evil 4? The wait isn&#x27;t too long as Capcom&#x27;s next remake is launching on March 24, 2023, for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC!

                              <span>Sega revealed a quick 30-second teaser of Sonic Frontiers gameplay earlier this week, and IGN released a full seven-minute look at the open-world gameplay of the Blue Blur’s latest. Now, you can watch more than six minutes of combat from the game, and it looks like Sonic combat…in a 3D open world. 
As we previously saw, Sonic Frontiers’ world is beautiful and one of the most realistic-looking games in the franchise’s history. Today’s combat showcase takes place in the same area as the previous gameplay premiere but with decidedly less rail grinding and more spinball fighting action. As you might expect, Sonic fights in Sonic Frontiers like he always has – lots of jump attacks, spin moves, kicks, and more. However, it seems he does have a few new tricks up his sleeve. Namely, an in-air jolt attack that makes him dash all over the screen before doing an interesting rotating circle attack. Take a look for yourself below: 


As you can see, Sonic is up against some new types of enemies in Sonic Frontiers, and they seem to tank a lot more damage than the Blue Blur is traditionally used to doling out. That doesn’t appear to be a problem for him, though, as he aptly takes them out with ease. We also get a look at Sonic confronting a massive creature-like machine that stands extremely tall toward the end of the video. Sonic uses some interesting moves to eventually defeat that, too. 
Unfortunately, we don’t yet have a release date for Sonic Frontiers, but it’s coming sometime this year, so hopefully, we don’t have to wait too much longer. In the meantime, check out this trailer from last December, and then check out this other snippet of Sonic Frontiers gameplay that debuted earlier this week.

                              <span>Update, 6/3/22:
During yesterday’s State of Play showcase, Sony revealed Insomniac Games’ Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered would be coming to PC on August 12. It turns out Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales is actually coming to PC this year, too, according to a PlayStation Blog Post spotted by IGN. However, while Spider-Man Remastered will be released on PC this summer, the PlayStation blog says Miles Morales will “launch on PC in fall 2022,” so presumably later than August 12. 
Oddly enough, PlayStation didn’t reveal Miles Morales was coming to PC during yesterday’s showcase, an odd exclusion for a segment of the show that was all about Spider-Man’s big PC release. Nonetheless, you can play through both of Insomniac’s Spider-Man games on PC later this year.  
The original story continues below...
Original story, 6/2/22:
Have you been wanting to web-sling as Spidey on your PC? You’re in luck! Today, at Sony’s State of Play, it was announced that Insomniac’s Spider-Man is coming to PC in its remastered form on August 12. Previously, you could only play the game on PS4 and PS5. 
The remastered edition includes new assets, tech, and plenty of updates. In this edition, Peter Parker was recast to Ben Jordan to better match actor Yuri Lowenthal’s facial capture for PS5.
That’s right in just a few months, you’ll be able to experience the game that our own Andrew Reiner gave a 9.5, saying: “Like Batman: Arkham Asylum before it, Spider-Man raises the bar for one of the world’s most beloved heroes.” You can read his full review here.
Want more? You can watch the reveal trailer above, which showcases the announcement and all the awesome action in store for Peter Parker.</span>

Ramone Russell has been there front and center to tell us what is new in each edition of this annualized series. Ramone is Sony Interactive Entertainment&#x27;s product development communications and brand strategist, but I&#x27;ve always jokingly called him &quot;the face of The Show.&quot;
In the years I&#x27;ve interviewed Ramone about The Show, I&#x27;ve learned he has an inspiring story to tell. People always ask me &quot;How do I get into the video game industry?&quot; and there&#x27;s no easy answer to that. Everyone&#x27;s journey will be different, but it always requires patience and a drive to make it. That drive is the backbone of Ramone&#x27;s story.

Okay, I’ve never said that, but dangit, I wish I did because it looks like that’s precisely what Final Fantasy XVI is delivering. 
Yesterday, Square Enix released a new trailer during PlayStation’s State of Play showcase, and it was our biggest and longest look at FF XVI yet. This nearly three-minute trailer featured fresh details on this entry’s story, extended looks at combat and gameplay, and more. It also introduced us to several new characters that appear to be central to the narrative of FF XVI who can seemingly transform into, or at least embody, primals...or summons or gods or whatever you wa…</span>

                              <span>Sega has revealed its next miniature console, the Mega Drive Mini 2. 
This news comes by way of Video Games Chronicle, which reports that it will include 50 games from both the Mega Drive and Mega Drive CD, including ports of arcade games and games Sega calls “mysterious new work.” Sega revealed this mini console during a special livestream in Japan today. It included news that the company will release the Mega Drive Mini 2 on Oct. 27 (in Japan) with a roughly $75 price tag. Sega has not confirmed a release outside of Japan, according to VGC. 

VGC reports that these are the confirmed games so far:
Bonanza Bros (Mega Drive)
Fantasy Zone (because Fantasy Zone never hit the Mega Drive, this version is a port based on Super Fantasy Zone)
Magical Taruruto (Mega Drive)
Shining in the Darkness (Mega Drive)
Thunder Force IV (Mega Drive)
Virtua Racing (Mega Drive)
Mansion of Hidden Souls (Mega CD)
Popful Mail (Mega CD)
Shining Force CD (Mega CD)
Silpheed (Mega CD)
Sonic CD (Mega CD)
The Mega Drive Mini 2 follows 2019’s Mega Drive Mini, first announced in 2018. You can read our thoughts on it in the Game Informer Sega Mega Drive Mini review.

                              <span>You have Final Fantasy XVI on the brain if you’re anything like me. This game, which Square Enix’s Creative Business Unit III studio is developing, has admittedly been on my mind since Square Enix revealed it in 2020. However, it’s especially front and center today after the FF XVI trailer that aired during yesterday’s State of Play. 
That trailer featured new looks at gameplay, more information about the warring kingdoms, including the Empire, surrounding the story, and the key figures at the heart of it all. Yesterday’s trailer highlighted these characters because they seem to have the ability to transform into completely, or at least embody, the primals or summons seen throughout the Final Fantasy franchise – primals and summons such as Ifrit, Bahamut, Odin, Shiva, and more. Following that trailer, Square Enix has uploaded some new screenshots of the beautiful landscapes in FF XVI we’ll be trekking across, and they look fantastic. Check them out for yourself below: 

As you can see, they feature new looks at different parts of this world that we haven’t yet seen in trailers, which have focused more on the story and combat of the game than the actual setting. These screenshots shed new light on the setting, though, including multiple locales we’ll likely be visiting when the game is released next summer.

                              <span>A new trailer for Final Fantasy XVI was released during today&#x27;s PlayStation State of Play, and it revealed a whole lot of war, turmoil, and primals. 
It also gave us extended looks at gameplay and a summer 2023 release window, which might come as a surprise considering producer Naoki Yoshida said in April that FF XVI was near the end of development. The trailer, which dove deep into the story of FF XVI, focuses on the war that will soon be waged between warring kingdoms, with the Empire seemingly leading the charge. At the heart of this war are multiple key figures who appear to have the ability to transform into (or at least embody) primals, which have traditionally been summons in Final Fantasy games.
Check them out for yourself in the trailer below: 


Here are the primals/summons seen in the trailer: 
Phoenix
Titan
Garuda
Bamuh
Shiva
Odin
Bahamut
Ifrit
Elsewhere in the trailer, we get new looks at the game&#x27;s combat, which seems to contain some unique boss fights that will feature health bars on the top of the screen. The combat throughout the gameplay looks quite flashy, too, with plenty of spin attacks, fire, and more. At the bottom right is a weapon wheel of sorts that seems to be something players can customize, complete with items, a jump action, an attack action, and a slew of magic attacks to utilize. Hopefully we learn more about all of this soon!

                              <span>We haven&#x27;t seen the jaw-dropping, peaceful-seeming indie since last year. Just a few months after its debut at The Game Awards, the title seemed to be stalled after several hostile workplace allegations. However, today&#x27;s State of Play proved the game is still in development and aims to come out in Autumn. The unexpected release window is coming up quickly, but the gorgeous new trailer suggests Season: A Letter to the Future will be ready.


Season won&#x27;t task you with fighting monsters or saving the world. Rather, the game puts the player in the shoes of a traveler named Estelle, who is recording everything around her for posterity. There are hints that Season&#x27;s sweeping vistas, sun-drenched fields, and flowing waterfalls won&#x27;t be around for future generations. The trailer explains that no one knows what will happen when &quot;the season&quot; ends, which makes the job of documenting the world for the future so important. We see the protagonist going about this assignment is various ways, like writing in a journal, taking photos, and recording audio. She also stops off to speak with the people around her while exploring the landscape on her bike.
As the narrative designer, Meg Hutchison explains:
The title looks like it is shaping up to be a pensive and beautiful experience when it comes out on PlayStation consoles and PC this fall.</span>

                              <span>Sony&#x27;s State of Play debuted a quirky dating-action game called Eternights. In it, independent developer Studio Sai invites you to find love in the most trying times – during an apocalypse.  
The game challenges you to make the most of life during this catastrophic situation. That means finding life and saving the world. When a mysterious entity infects humans and turns them into monsters, you must race against the clock to find an answer for survival, especially if you want to save your new relationship. In the game, you scavenge, dungeon crawl, and date your way to answers. But be aware that you&#x27;re doing it all on a deadline, with a clock constantly ticking, reminding you to meet your deadlines.
Studio Sai promises dungeons with traps and puzzles, alongside fun dancing minigames. You also get to pick from a cast of five characters for your romantic pursuits, each with their own unique stories and skills to help you battle. The action showcased in the trailer looked fast-paced and featured mostly hacking and slashing away at baddies while using the face buttons to unleash powerful skills and magical abilities. There was even a motorcycle sequence to get your adrenaline pumping. You can watch the trailer above to see it all in action for yourself. 
So get ready to hold hands, makeout, and fight to stay alive when Eternights debuts on PS5, PS4, and PC sometime in early 2023.</span>

                              <span>Capcom brought out the big guns for Sony&#x27;s State of Play Presentation, first announcing a remake of Resident Evil 4 is coming next year, but Street Fighter 6 is also confirmed for 2023. Not only did the next installment of the legendary fighting game franchise make an appearance, but there was plenty of in-game footage shown, along with a second trailer showing a revolutionary new feature. 
First, the footage shown in the State of Play introduced a new single-player mode for SF6 called World Tour, which has players roaming the streets in an open world picking fights with other world warriors. The other is Battle Hub which is where players can throw down in matches online. Capcom states the mode will &quot;further expand the scope of player communication and engagement.&quot;

                              <span>If you thought football (both types) would continue being popular in the year 2030, you are apparently wrong. A new bloodsport called rollerdrome will apparently become all the rage in that year. Rollerdrome is in development at Roll7, the studio behind the OlliOlli series, and will be published by Private Division on August 16 for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and PC.
Anyone can compete in this deadly game, but the deck is stacked against them, as they take on house players (much like the American Gladiators show). The goal of each competitor is to achieve the highest score possible, by combining rollerskate tricks with eliminations. The player assumes the identity of Kara Hassan as she enters her first match. Your goal is to rise the ranks and hopefully become the Rollerdome champion – meaning you stay alive.
“It’s been amazing to see this project come to life from the original prototype that received a lot of love online, all the way to the brutal and intense experience it is now – thanks to the amazing work of the team at Roll7,″ Paul Rabbitte, creative director at Roll7, said. “We’re really excited for players to jump into Rollerdrome.”</span>

                              <span>A new trailer for Stray, the adorable cat game first revealed in 2020, was released during today&#x27;s PlayStation State of Play and it featured new looks at gameplay and the exciting news that we can play it next month. 
That&#x27;s because Stray will hit PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and PC on July 19. As for the trailer, it showcased more of the behind-the-cat, third-person (err, third-feline?) gameplay central to the game. As previously seen, this stray cat inhabits a very cyberpunk-esque world, filled with robots and more. As for the titular stray cat&#x27;s place in all this, it seems they&#x27;re on a mission to help inhabitants of this world and ultimately, find a way home. 
You can watch the trailer for yourself below: 


Here&#x27;s what publisher Annapurna Interactive has to say about Stray: &quot;In Stray, players take the role of a stray cat who must untangle an ancient mystery to escape a long-forgotten cybercity amidst the detailed neon-lit alleys and the murky environments of its seedy underbelly. Along the way, the cat befriends a small flying drone, known only as B12. With the help of this newfound companion, the duo must find a way out.&quot;

                              <span>Today’s State of Play is bringing an array of exciting projects that are on deck for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and the upcoming PlayStation VR 2, but few are as anticipated as Callisto Protocol, the upcoming horror game from Striking Distance Studios. The game got a new trailer at today’s presentation, along with a December 2 launch date.
For those not in the know, Striking Distance Studios is led by Glen Schofield, the same person who helped lead development of the original Dead Space way back in 2008. Even as EA is actively working on a remake of that original game, Schofield’s team is charting out a new universe of horror that is clearly inspired by the gameplay and visual palette of that older game.
In the new trailer, we get an extensive glimpse at the gory and terrifying gameplay in store for players when the game launches later this year. We see protagonist Jacob Lee as he makes his way through one scary-looking outer space locale to the next, often with the looming presence of the gas giant planet of Jupiter overhead.  
Jacob wanders through tight and dimly lit corridors before an array of monsters manage to get to him. We see an interesting mix of melee and ranged weapons that the scared hero can wield. But even with some helpful toys, things don&#x27;t always go well for Jacob. Striking Distance is pulling no punches in regard to what happens to their lead character if players don’t manage to pull him out of trouble. In one especially disturbing concluding sequence, we see one of the creatures tear a portion of his head and face off in what is almost certainly a preface to a game over screen.
The Callisto Protocol just happens to be this month’s cover story at Game Informer, and you can head over to our game hub to check out all the info we’ve got on the game as it becomes available.
In the meantime, check out the trailer in all its creepy glory, and watch for The Callisto Protocol&#x27;s release on December 2 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.</span>

                              <span>Tunic is finally making its way to Sony&#x27;s machines. Announced Thursday during the most recent State of Play livestream, the indie darling will be released on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 on September 27 of this year. 
When it was released on Xbox consoles and PC back in March, Tunic received near-unanimous acclaim from critics, who most often cited its Zelda-like exploration and Souls-like combat. It didn&#x27;t hurt that the game, which stars a little fox on a big adventure, was painfully adorable. As we said in our review, &quot;Tunic is a stunning achievement that manages to embody the best of nostalgia while being completely refreshing. It’s absolutely a must-play gem.&quot;
Check out the announcement trailer right here:

While the brief trailer didn&#x27;t show much in the way of gameplay, it did show various locations and characters from the game, and most importantly, a release date: March 24, 2023.
Most strikingly – and predictably – the new Resident Evil 4 looks leagues better visually than its 2005 counterpart. During the minute-long trailer, we see protagonist Leon Kennedy, antihero Ada Wong, Ashley Graham, Luis, and brief glimpses of antagonists Osmund Saddler and Bitores Mendez. The trailer also shows quick looks at Salazar Castle and the iconic village from the beginning of RE4 and the baddies that inhabit them. The voiceover seems to indicate the game&#x27;s story has been expanded and will act as a more direct sequel to Resident Evil 2, which also stars Leon as its protagonist. 
The trailer ends with a brief tease that VR content is also in development for Resident Evil 4. 
See the trailer in full below.


This is just the latest in the long line of Resident Evil remakes – which, if you&#x27;re being exact, starts all the way back on the GameCube with the remake of the original 1996 game. In 2019, developer-publisher Capcom released a remake of Resident Evil 2, which was then followed by a Resident Evil 3: Nemesis remake in 2020. And if you&#x27;re being technical, this is actually the second Resident Evil 4 remake in as many years – kind of. Last year, Capcom partnered with developer Armature Studios on the excellent Resident Evil 4 VR.</span>

                              <span>Xalavier Nelson Jr has a bit of a love hate relationship with screens right now. As development on his studio’s gutsy market game Space Warlord Organ Trading Simulator was wrapping up at the end of last year, he tells me he remembers “just being really angry at the concept of the borders of the screen”. He was, by his own admission, in “a vague fugue state” at the time, having spent months immersed in Space Warlord’s black and green trading interfaces. But the feeling of having his game “chained to these walls” at the edge of his monitor proved to be a surprisingly powerful one - so much so that it spurred Nelson Jr and his team at Strange Scaffold to create an entirely new kind of game in the months leading up to Warlord’s release: Witch Strandings.

That&#x27;s right. Taking cues from Hideo Kojima’s hiking postal sim Death Stranding, Witch Strandings is a game that not only asks what Sam Bridges’ cross-country cargo routes might look like if they were made with a fraction of Kojima’s development budget, but also how games can create experiences that are “larger than my screen,” says Nelson Jr. And the answer, it turns out, lies in your PC’s humble mouse.

                              <span>A new Horizon Forbidden West update was surprise announced during today&#x27;s PlayStation State of Play stream and it&#x27;s out now. 
It brings many new highly requested features to the game, including New Game+, transmog, and more. More specifically, this update, which can be downloaded now, will allow players to begin a brand new game with all of their endgame gear. If they find a new gear set they prefer, they can take on all the stats of it while keeping the look of their favorite set thanks to transmog. 


Elsewhere, this update allows players to completely reset their skills and redistribute skill points. That&#x27;s going to be especially helpful for players who need to reshape their build in a new difficulty now live in Horizon Forbidden West: Ultra Hard difficulty. 
Guerrilla Games has been hard at work fixing visual problems with the game through multiple patches, such as shimmering in foliage and elsewhere, and today&#x27;s update includes &quot;improved visual fidelity.&quot; There&#x27;s no word on exactly what that addresses but it&#x27;s probably safe to say the game will look better after installing the update. Finally, the last thing in today&#x27;s update is the inclusion of new weapons to find and new trophies to obtain. 


Horizon Forbidden West is out now exclusively on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 and today&#x27;s surprise update can be downloaded right now. While waiting for it to download, read Game Informer&#x27;s Horizon Forbidden West review and then check out this adorable Aloy nendoroid figure.

                              <span>&quot;Climb the mountain. Find out why the machines are attacking.&quot; Today&#x27;s Sony State of Play brought fans another look at Guerrilla Games&#x27; VR adventure, Horizon Call of the Mountain, though the trailer didn&#x27;t specify a release window. However, it did reveal some of the game&#x27;s big narrative plot points. The trailer, which you can watch below, was also filled with lush environments and showed off several impressive, first-person shots of the world&#x27;s monstrous machines.


You&#x27;ll be playing as Ryas, an entirely new character, who was once a Shadow Carja. He finds himself mysteriously released from prison by Blameless Marad, the Sun King&#x27;s right-hand man, to combat a deadly threat. Skilled at climbing and archery, Ryas ends up washed ashore after a Snapmaw attacks his two captors. The wild rapids look like they&#x27;ll be an experience in the PSVR2 game&#x27;s campaign, but players can check out even more rushing waters in the Call of the Mountain River Ride. This bonus feature offers to show you Horizon&#x27;s world in a totally new way. 
A post on PlayStation&#x27;s blog offered more insight for players who are ready to jump into the Ryas&#x27; story, saying:
But that&#x27;s not the only Horizon news from today&#x27;s event. The State of Play followed up Call of the Mountain with an announcement that Horizon Forbidden West is getting a huge update, with New Game + and more.</span>

Výpadek trval asi dvě hodiny, během kterých byl například částečně omezen provoz tramvají a pražského metra. Zároveň však došlo k poruše na jedné napájecí větvi v datacentru Master Internet, kde běží například také servery společnosti Internet Info včetně Root.cz.</span>

                              <span>Because I now live in a country that isn&#x27;t the UK, I get different bank holidays to staff in the UK, which it turns out is almost everyone else. This means I&#x27;m at work today and Friday. For other people outside the UK who don&#x27;t know, this weekend it is celebrating the Queen&#x27;s Platinum Jubilee. She&#x27;s the first UK monarch to manage 70 years on the throne, most of the other ones having killed each other or somesuch. The country, specifically England, has responded to this by going absolutely off the boil, represented even in digi-form with a virtual street party map in Minecraft. I wouldn&#x27;t normally write about it, but it gives me an excuse to republican-post on main when nobody is looking.

                              <span>Seregios can get stuffed. I recently faced off against the massive golden dragon during a hands-on session for Sunbreak, the upcoming expansion pack for Monster Hunter Rise, and it battered me repeatedly for the best part of an hour. It has become the flying white whale to my dual blade wielding Ahab, and I left the preview event determined to chop it to bits when the DLC finally arrives later this month.


Sunbreak’s new master rank quests aren’t messing around, basically. It seems Capcom have taken criticisms that the base version of Monster Hunter Rise didn’t provide challenging enough end-game content to heart, and have loaded the expansion with some truly agonising encounters purpose-built for returning veterans.

                              <span>Ever have an idea that you regret the instant you commit to realising it? That&#x27;s how I feel about my decision to rank all of Elden Ring&#x27;s major locations. It turns out that, not only are there a lot of locations in Elden Ring, but the definition of a distinct location is largely up for debate. The opening area of Limgrave, for example, could be as many as four separate regions (East Limgrave, West Limgrave, Stormhill and Weeping Peninsula) depending on how you interpret it. That&#x27;s not to mention all of the dungeons, caves, chapels, and other landmarks scattered throughout the Lands Between.
Yet like a newly minted Wretch squaring up to Margit the Fell Omen for the first time, I am prepared to plough on despite the pain that awaits. Below you&#x27;ll find a comprehensive ranking of Elden Ring&#x27;s major regions and legacy dungeons, based on the admittedly woolly criteria of how fun and interesting each location is to explore. So grab your map, put on your boots, and update your life insurance policy as we embark upon a grand tour of From Software&#x27;s magnificent fantasy realm.

                              <span>The Crucial P5 Plus is one of my favourite SSDs, as you might know from me writing about it last week. . Then, I was happy to announce that this rapid 1TB PCIe 4.0 drive had made it to £100 - a price it&#x27;s gotten near a few times before but not stayed at with any regularity. You can imagine my surprise, therefore, when I discovered that Crucial are now selling the same drive at their site for £80.69 - a genuine bargain and the lowest price we&#x27;ve ever seen by some margin.

                              <span>It’s officially summer, although you wouldn’t think it based on the amount of rain we’ve had up here in Newcastle this week. Still, that vague hint of warmth that lingers between the raindrops has got me dreaming of all those lovely things that make summer so appealing. Al fresco dining, excluding that bit where a wasp crawls into your glass of Fanta, which seems to happen to me a lot. Music festivals, minus the part where you queue for half an hour to have a wee. Oh, and obviously spending time on a beach somewhere hot, purposefully ignoring that horrible bit where you try to get your socks back on after taking a dip in the ocean and the sand scrapes against your skin.


OK, so maybe summer isn’t all it’s cracked up to be. Why do we even bother leaving the house, when we can stay indoors and play video games on PC instead? June is a little sparse when it comes to new releases (as is so often the case during these warmer seasons) but there’s still plenty on the horizon to keep you occupied.

                              <span>Intel&#x27;s 12th-gen motherboards are getting cheaper, which is handy if you&#x27;re planning a new build around one of Intel&#x27;s excellent 12100, 12400F or 12600F CPUs for gaming. One of the best deals we&#x27;ve spotted is for the Asus Prime B660M-A WiFi D4, which launched at £197 and is now down to £86 at CCL in the UK.
This motherboard uses better value DDR4 memory, two M.2 PCIe 4.0 slots and WiFi 6 on board, so it ticks a lot of boxes in terms of the essentials. You&#x27;re missing some things from higher-end Z690 boards - like PCIe 5.0, USB-C ports and 2.5-gig networking - but nothing that affects gaming performance, at least in the here and now.

                              <span>I used to draw Abe’s Oddysee levels. Then Abe’s Exoddus, when that came out. Also, before them, every other platform game I ever got my hands on. Take a sheet of plain paper, turn it horizontal, draw two long lines across it, dividing it into three strips. That’s a level; that’s a side-scrolling environment. That’s what I’d do, basically all the time, basically every day. You could call me a budding game designer, only I had no knowledge of how to transfer my genius creations into digital form. I’d tried before, with Doom, but the editor was incomprehensible. Sectors? Vectors? Call me a particularly stupid child, but I just wanted to draw two long lines on a piece of paper.


Enter Speedy Eggbert, a budget-priced platform game that scored “the world’s first generous 4% review” in PC Gamer magazine. But I wasn’t aware of that yet. I was, though, aware of its big, shiny box on the shelves of Game, with its gorgeously embossed Eggbert and a reverse emblazoned with screenshots and features, including the most enticing few words I’d ever seen – “MAKE YOUR OWN LEVELS!”

                              <span>A surprise God of War PC update has made it one of just three games to support AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) 2.0. This significantly improved upscaling option, introduced a few weeks back in Deathloop (and more recently making it to Farming Simulator 22), completely replaces God of War’s FSR 1.0 setting, giving Radeon GPU owners a performance booster that comes much closer to Nvidia DLSS on quality.

                              <span>Has anyone coined the term Limbolike yet? 2D side-scrolling platformers that are a bit Tim Burton-y, and possibly in monochrome. Y&#x27;know the ones? Silt is a Limbolike, only it&#x27;s Limbo under the sea. Other free-wheeling associations I have made include Minute Of Islands and, most weirdly, Gormenghast. But having mentioned the later, and because people who like Gormenghast really bloody like Gormenghast (a reasonable position), and respond to its evocation like Chekhov&#x27;s dogs let loose at the eleventh annual Ringing World National Youth Championship competition, I&#x27;m now going to have to temper expectations back down.

                              <span>Here we have another AOC gaming monitor, except it’s not just by AOC, but by posh car makers Porsche? It’s the Porsche Design AOC Agon Pro PD32M, a premium 4K / 144Hz beast of a display, and is in fact the second hardware collaboration between these unlikely bedfellows.

Its DisplayHDR certification also rises from 400 to 1400, fuelled largely by a switch to more advanced Mini LED backlighting: the same sort as the Asus ROG Swift PG32UQX, one of the best 4K gaming monitors.

It&#x27;s a bold play releasing a Soulslike in any year, let alone the year of Elden Ring. You could snap open any twelve month span like a bulrush and watch many thousands of little Soulslikes disperse into the atmosphere, with only a select few really making an impact.
Steelrising is one of these Soulslike seeds hoping to sink into our screens, sprout, and take root not only in the innards of our Panasonics, but our minds too. From what I&#x27;ve seen, it stands a chance of survival in a saturated land.

                              <span>After discussing a good deal on an incredibly rapid NVMe SSD, I thought I should let you know about something on the other side of the spectrum: a 500GB NVMe SSD going for just £36. This is the Crucial P2, a drive that&#x27;s been reviewed warmly here at RPS, and it&#x27;s a 34% reduction from the drive&#x27;s UK RRP.

                              <span>Readers may remember my delight over the demo for Little Witch In The Woods, and I&#x27;m happy to report that game is now out in early access. It&#x27;s already much more polished than the demo, with more yet to come. It&#x27;s a life sim with a bit of a Stardew Valley or Animal Crossing vibe, except instead of farming you are a witch called Ellie (size: small) living in a biome (type: forest).
In the story you start to free the nearby village from cursed vines, and this requires that you catalogue and collect ingredients for spells, and thence expand your repertoire of witchy recipes. At the same time you can trade spells and magical candy with locals for currency, which you can use to improve your little machines - a roaster, a caldron, a press for ingredients - to make even better things, more efficiently. It&#x27;s a satisfying process of mastery and exploration. But that is not the important bit. The important bit is that Little Witch In The Woods is disgustingly adorable.

                              <span>To be honest, I found Computex 2022 kind of underwhelming; this is usually the biggest event in the PC gaming hardware calendar, and had returned to Taipei after an all-remote 2021 show, but ended with only a smattering of major announcements in the bag. We got nothing on Intel’s Arc graphics cards, and Nvidia’s keynote revealed some new DLSS games but otherwise went light on GeForce deets.


That said, this year’s show wasn’t a bust either: there was fresh AMD Ryzen 7000 info, Corsair’s first crack at a gaming laptop and, at long last, some PCIe 5.0 SSDs you can actually buy. One day. In the future. That’s in addition to the wackier, moon-shooting tech on display, without which it just wouldn’t be Computex. So, in descending order - from the interesting and sensible to the blinking ludicrous – here are the PC gaming highlights from Computex 2022.

                              <span>I feel a bit sorry for Crossfire: Legion, which appears to have suffered the worst launch imaginable for a fast-paced competitive RTS game. Since releasing last week, its all time peak of concurrent players is less than 400, and the average daily concurrents have slid down to around 100 people in only a few days. Worse, a fair chunk of this already dwindling community has been sorely narked off due to an apparent misunderstanding over how one of Legion&#x27;s key features work.

                              <span>Ten years ago Google launched its DMCA takedown transparency report.

                              <span>Fast Four Word is a clever idea. It&#x27;s a Wordle-like in which you begin with a four-letter starting word and must enter a new word which changes just a single letter.

It&#x27;s a card game filled with anthropomorphic animals in medieval garb in which you can sneak and barter before or instead of scrapping. Find the trailer below.

                              <span>We&#x27;ve less than one week left until the Queen&#x27;s Platinum Jubilee long weekend, so please do remember to book your pets in to be dyed red, white, and blue before it&#x27;s too late. All the grooming parlours will be heaving with patriotic pups and pusses. Don&#x27;t forget to brew a giant pot of coronation chicken (or, like me, coronation tofu) to keep you going during the coming week of endless festivity and forced celebration. If you grow tired and that flag-waving arm starts to sag, you&#x27;ll be in for it. But first, what are you playing this weekend? Here&#x27;s what we&#x27;re clicking on!

                              <span>My favourite kind of Humble Bundle isn&#x27;t a collection of games, most of which I&#x27;ll never get round to playing. It&#x27;s a bundle of a single game I like with lots and lots of discounted DLC. 

Enter the Cities Skylines Colossal Collection, which offers up Cities: Skylines, 9 expansions and 21 add-ons for £16.22/$20/€18.95.

The update brings PvP arena combat in best-of-five contests that Amazon say are for “glory and riches”, but then quickly qualifies that they&#x27;re actually for unique stuff to decorate your in-game house with.

I wouldn’t even be one of those rebels who wear the long funny bike helmets. There would be no “Liam: A Star Wars Story” premiering on Disney+. Instead, I&#x27;d be the guy who changes the bedding at a grungy BnB on Tatooine. I would spend my days just sort of vibing on the fringes of all the excitement, blissfully unaware of the very important adventures occurring in a galaxy very-very-close-actually.


Maybe this is why Hardspace: Shipbreaker appeals to me so much. As a cutter, a nameless employee of the LYNX Corporation, you’re about as important to this particular vision of the future as the lad who polishes the floors on the Death Star. You are a nobody. But Shipbreaker relishes in how much that still makes you somebody.

                              <span>I’ve been keeping a curious eye on AMD’s Software Preview Driver for May 2022; GPU drivers often promise “optimisations” that are rarely felt in practice, but this one genuinely sounded like a performance enhancing drug for Radeon graphics cards. In a community post, AMD asserted this particular Preview Driver could provide double-digit percentage gains in games running DirectX 11; claims that were backed up by early independent testing, like the creator of benchmarking tool CapFrameX getting an extra 24% out of Crysis Remastered.


This week, AMD Software Adrenaline Edition 22.5.2 released, making that new Radeon driver available to anyone who didn’t fancy switching to preview builds. Armed with an RX 6500 XT (a low-end card that desperately needs a performance kick), I gave the new software a whirl – and found that, for all those big numbers, Radeon owners should probably lower their expectations.

                              <span>The word that comes to mind is &quot;slick&quot;. In a genre defined by busy screens and showy light spectacles, Drainus does well to distinguish itself with such excellent animation. The enemies, and particularly the way they spill from levels like the battleship one, demonstrate some of the best sprite work I&#x27;ve seen for ages.
It&#x27;s more than just stylish, too. As I&#x27;ve mentioned before, I&#x27;m bad enough at scrolling shooters, and outright averse to bullet hell, to make me less than an authority on which are the best. But Drainus held my attention for long enough that you should definitely give it a chance.
I&#x27;m not going to do a pun about the name. I&#x27;m not. I&#x27;m definitely not.

                              <span>A while back I finished Yakuza: Like A Dragon and felt a little bit lost. You know the feeling, right? When you snap shut a piece of fiction you’ve been reading for days, or months even, it can be difficult severing those relationships you’ve built with its characters. Unless there’s a direct sequel, you must pull your pants up and shelve those emotions and move on.
Not that I struggle with letting go of characters and stories particularly, but my brain makes an exception for the Yakuza games. More specifically, Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio&#x27;s games. I’ve reached a point where I’m ordering Lost Judgment with no intention of playing it for months - maybe even a year? It’s all a ploy to hang onto RGG’s characters and worlds for as long as I can; a sort of buffer to keep the unease at bay. Having nowhere to turn to next isn’t an option.

I’d only just started this job and was still setting up my email signature at the time (sorry, TF2 community), but thankfully all that shouting has finally been heard by the people who matter most. For the first time in two years, Valve tweeted through the official TF2 account today that they’re finally going to do something about the bots. My inbox is thankful.

You&#x27;ll be able to wish for her in the gacha from May 31st, but in the meantime, MiHoYo have set up a web event to let players get to know this mysterious newcomer a little bit better.

Despite only the briefest of hands-on sessions cut short by sod&#x27;s law, I simply can&#x27;t shake the game from my short back and sides-furnished skull. I think I need someone to roundhouse kick me into reality, before I fall asleep and wake up in the fantastical reams of Zenozoik for good.

                              <span>Valve have wheeled out another major Steam Deck software update, featuring some tasty changes that have been available to try on the SteamOS beta branch for a few weeks. Namely, SteamOS 3.2 tweaks the Deck’s fan curve to make it quieter (especially under light load), and adds the option to set the screen’s refresh rate anywhere between 40Hz and 60Hz – potentially saving battery life in exchange for a lower frames-per-second ceiling.

It&#x27;s a multiplayer variant where both players take it in turns to guess words on the same board, which means that each helpful guess you make is also helping your opponent.

                              <span>A digital artist has created a stylish mockup of a roguelike (maybe even a Roguelike) which looks like printed screenshots in a magazine. It&#x27;s a pretty little thing, though I should stress it is only a mockup to demonstrate a shader, not an actual game. But still, come, watch.

                              <span>After an extended period of time, we&#x27;re finally ready to announce that the game Chewy: ESC From F5 is ready for testing. This quirky game features the protagonist Chewy as he tries to outwit the evil Borks. Escaping from their high security zone, F5, will just be the start of his adventure.
If any of you have the game and are willing to test it out, we&#x27;ll welcome any feedback. You will need a daily development build. As always, please submit the bug reports to our issue tracker. 
Please note that the ScummVM version does have one major outstanding issue: the music used by the game is in a custom format we&#x27;ve been unable to properly support yet. So only sound effects and speech currently work at this time.

                              <span>A few days ago, Google announced the list of students accepted for this year&#x27;s Google Summer of Code.
We are very proud to welcome 4 students this year who will be working on various parts of the project during the upcoming months.
Pragyansh Chaturvedi (aka Raikou) will work on improving our DIRECTOR engine. His effort will help us to allow support for many 90s-era adventure games made with the Macromedia Director authoring tools. By implementing more internal functions used by DIRECTOR, Pragyansh&#x27;s main objective is to extend support for Meet Mediaband and The Journeyman Project (Win and Mac), making them fully playable without any glitches.
Michael Hayman (aka Quote58) is about to implement support for The Immortal. The game (released in 1990) can be described as a mix of genres involving RPG elements with action and puzzles. Many changes across different game variants (written in pure assembly code!) will make this an interesting challenge. This project is a continuation of a GSoC task initially started by a former student back in 2018.
Emanuele Grisenti (aka grisenti) will be working on a new engine, HPL1. The original sources for this engine got recently released by the original developer Frictional Games under GPLv3. The purpose of this project is to achieve a full port of this engine to ScummVM, with the goal of supporting the 2007 survival game Penumbra: Overture.
Avijeet Maurya (aka StableSteady) will pick up several incomplete engines: MacVenture, Avalanche, Glk-Scott, Pink and WAGE. Some of these engines are very close to completion, but not quite there yet. The main objective of Avijeet&#x27;s task is to identify all missing features and fix existing bugs. The goal for his project is to bring the above engines to a stable state.
The team is very excited about the upcoming weeks – and we hope you are as well.
Please give a warm welcome to our new students! Let&#x27;s make GSoC 2022 a huge success – together!
