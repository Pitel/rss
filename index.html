Gooooooood morning, and welcome to Whatcha Been Playing? I hope that this week has been a nice one for all of you, and that you have a totally tubular weekend lined up. If you&#x27;re fortunate enough to be off work, well that&#x27;s just peachy, and be sure to get all of the R &#x27;n&#x27; R that you deserve. If you are working today/tomorrow, then know that we&#x27;re keeping a seat warm for you, and we hope that you get away from the grindstone and join us later on today. We&#x27;re sending you the very best for your day, too.
Regardless of your plans, it&#x27;s great to see you stop by, and here&#x27;s to you and your Saturday, bucko.

Internal issues at Activision Blizzard are carrying over into public forums. Following a company-wide Q&amp;A with Blizzard president Mike Ybarra, workers have been voicing their frustrations online, as Activision Blizzard backs Ybarra&#x27;s statements.
Details of the meeting were shared with Game Developer, who reports that the company-wide Q&amp;A was scheduled to cover the results of an employee satisfaction survey. As part of the meeting, Ybarra and studio executives answered pre-screened questions about several topics, including the stack ranking that recently drew ire and rolling back remote work practices. Employees were also told they&#x27;d receive only 58% of their profit-sharing bonus.

Podporovány jsou i procesory RISC-V a x86. Často je Armbian lepší volbou, než zastaralé neudržované obrazy od výrobce. Na výběr je user-space buď Debian Bullseye, nebo Ubuntu Jammy bez snapu (je možné jej doinstalovat). Armbian je dále známý svým konfiguračním nástrojem pro příkazovou řádku armbian-config, kterým je podobný raspi-config v Raspberry Pi OS. Armbian měl také upravený htop, který ukazoval frekvence a teploty procesorů. Změna se již dostala do oficiálního htopu.</span>

The comments can provide relevant evidence in support of a repeat infringer lawsuit against ISP RCN, the companies argue. Reddit disagrees and frames the effort as a fishing expedition that is at odds with the right to anonymous speech.

                              <span>10 games were too few for this super library
I’ve made it clear by now that ranking games in a franchise or a system’s library is not easy. Even if these rankings are subjective, deciding which games are “best” wracks my brain for hours before I finish a rough draft. This is why I do not say lightly that all my lists to this point pale in comparison to the difficulty of ranking the best SNES games.
Lord Spencer elegantly described my 10 best Mario games list as “a list of nines rolling into tens.” As I jotted down my picks for this list, I realized they were all potentially tens. The SNES is so jam-packed with incredible titles that we upped the count to 15 to represent it. This is a system where legends were born, franchises were codified, and memories were made magical. No list can conta…</span>

Ghost Ship Games, the independent developer behind 2018&#x27;s smash hit Deep Rock Galactic, has announced that it has founded a new publishing wing, named, naturally, Ghost Ship Publishing. The new label is the next step in the evolution of the studio, following its purchase by Embracer Group in 2021.
&quot;Becoming a publisher is a way for us to give a bit back to the industry, and to help lift up both the Danish gaming scene and other small developers like ourselves across the globe,&quot; said CEO of Ghost Ship Games Soren Lundgaard in a press statement. &quot;Our goal is to assist fellow developers with funding and marketing expertise, while also helping them establish a solid business. Founding a publishing brand is a passion project for us, and we are very excited to make this a reality.”
https://twitter.com/GhostShip_Games/status/1626153169255297024?s&#x3D;20
&quot;Starting a publishing company is a natural next step for Ghost Ship,&quot; adds CCO Mikkel Martin Pedersen. &quot;We love games and the success of Deep Rock Galactic has now enabled us to help other developers create theirs. We can’t wait to get started.&quot;
Ghost Ship Publishing is believed to already have several titles waiting in the wings for release in 2023 and beyond. The new label will work with independent studios in order to help conceive, finance, and release their respective projects. Ghost Ship Games was originally brought under the EMbracer Group banner in August 2021, as part of a huge acquisition period that also saw the holding company pick up 3D Realms, Easy Trigger, Slipgate Ironworks, CrazyLabs, and several other fledgling studios.

Next week sees the compelling blockbuster Tetris Effect: Connected make its debut on both PS5 and the newly launched PlayStation VR 2 (PSVR 2) platform — In addition to these new editions, a fresh update for all versions will be bringing a selection of new modes to the iconic, wall-building puzzler.
https://youtu.be/BiL6U_iONN4
Available from February 22, the free update will bring four new modes to Tetris Effect: Connected. These include Classic Score Attack, (complete with PAL/NTSC speed toggles), Zone Marathon, which, as the name suggests, adds the Zone mechanics to Marathon mode, and Endless options for both Master and Purify modes. You can check out an explainer video above, demonstrating the new modes. The video also features comments from pro-Tetris players Blink and Yoshimi.
The PS5 edition of Tetris Effect: Connected will include additional features including support for Haptic Feedback on Dual Sense, PSVR 2 Sense, and the PSVR 2 headset. as well as 4K resolution support. The PSVR2 release will also support eye tracking, and will allow players to select their zone of choice by looking directly at the zone and performing a hard blink. Nice touch.
Tetris Effect: Connected launches on PS5 and PSVR 2 on February 22. It is available right now on PS4, PC, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, Luna, and Oculus Quest.

Though Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet already gave us mice for Valentine’s Day, it hasn’t slowed down in rolling out its weekly Tera Raid spotlight events. Case in point: Garchomp and Sylveon are currently featured as blue star Tera Raids from now through February 19th.
If you’ve been following these events as they’ve gone live, you know what to expect. Garchomp and Sylveon will have boosted appearance rates in Tera Raids at either 4 or 5-Star difficulty. They will spawn as any Tera Type in the game, so it’s impossible to choose a dedicated Pokemon to counter them like in 7-Star raids. That said, Sylveon will more commonly appear with the Fairy Tera Type, while Garchomp will commonly sport the Ground Tera Type. These events typically don&#x27;t boost the the appearan…</span>

Survival town-builder Outlanders is the latest game that will be leaving Apple Arcade to plant roots on new platformers. Pomelo Games&#x27; builder is dropping on March 7, 2023.
First released on the iOS Apple Arcade in 2019, Outlanders is a survival town-builder, a genre that has been growing in popularity since Shining Rock Software’s 2014 hit, Banished. Since then, the formula has been expanded by games like Frostpunk and Settlement Survival. The focus of these games is on resource management, as your townsfolk suffer from a fatal condition known as mortality. Fail to keep them fed and healthy, and they will succumb to their diseases.

Outlanders attempts a more relaxed approach, but you’ll still be tasked with filling hungry bellies. It has a narrative campaign that has you follow the paths of various leaders. There is no combat, but the media around it shows construction near a volcano. Like other games in the series, you manage the workload of the town’s inhabitants, and you can pass decrees to work the ungrateful peons to an early grave. Improvements have been made to the UI and graphics to make it better suited to the good old mouse and keyboard setup. A sandbox mode will also be available if you do better without having to worry about goals or expectations.
Outlanders is currently available on iOS via Apple Arcade, and will be coming to PC on March 7, 2023. There is currently a PC demo available on Steam if you want to kick the tires.

                              <span>It&#x27;s lonely out in space...
Epic Games Store has revealed the next game that it will be offering up to its community of customers free of charge next week — And for our next freebie we&#x27;ll be looking at the desolate sci-fi strategy title Duskers, which will be available to download by all from February 23.
Developed by husband-and-wife indie studio Misfits Attic and released way back in 2016, Duskers sees players managing a small squadron of drones as they attempt to locate, explore, and salvage a series of lonely and haunting derelicts in the deep regions of space. The gameplay in Duskers is two-fold, with players tasked with maintaining, upgrading, and micro-managing their drone units, before taking them out into the field, where they are controlled with rudimentary commands in a very &quot;classic sci-fi&quot; manner.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;dux33m_7M6w&amp;ab_channel&#x3D;MisfitsAttic
It is the players&#x27; duty to maintain the drones&#x27; well-being, both on and off the field. This includes helping them to negotiate environmental hazards, avoid malfunctions and fuel loss, and ensure that the drones are kept routinely repaired and ready to rock from sector to sector. It&#x27;s all very Silent Running, from a technical and aesthetic standpoint — Though I do not think Duskers features any actual gardening. Duskers would be critically acclaimed for its design and atmosphere on launch, even bagging several independent game awards and nominations.
Duskers will be able to download from Epic Games Store from February 23 until March 2. Until then, players still have the opportunity to bag current freebie Warpips, before its removal on Wednesday.

Firaxis has announced by way of Twitter that development has started on the next entry in the Civilization series. The last entry, Civilization VI, launched back – holy crap – in 2016. Despite this, it’s still receiving DLC, with its Leader Pass still dropping new content.

That’s all we’ve got so far, so here are some facts.
The Civilization series started way back in 1991. A new one being announced at this time isn’t a huge surprise, as new entries have been dropping like clockwork every 5-6 years. Each time, I can’t help but wonder what you could possibly add to the previous title to make it a new experience, and it’s always just enough to make it worth it. The biggest change was perhaps the …</span>

If you want to carry Alan Wake in your hands, but were put off by reports about the quality of the previously released Alan Wake Remastered port, it might be time for a second glance. Remedy Games dropped a patch on February 15 that addresses the game’s rampant performance issues.

Alan Wake was first released back in 2010 on the Xbox 360 before later being ported to Windows. It was gussied up for Alan Wake Remastered for Xbox, PlayStation, and Windows platforms in 2021. The Remaster was then ported to Switch last year in 2022. Despite it being over a decade old and having run on comparable hardware, grizzled Destructoid veteran Jonathan Holmes reported …</span>

In a surprising piece of news, developer Firaxis has announced the departure of two of its veteran players: game director Jake Soloman and studio lead Steve Martin. Both individuals have been with the studio for over 20 years, overseeing the development and release of acclaimed strategy titles including XCOM, XCOM 2, and, most recently, Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns.
&quot;I’m embarking on a new chapter; however, I am incredibly grateful to have had the opportunity to fulfill my dreams at Firaxis Games,” said Solomon in an official press statement. &quot;I’m thankful to everyone who enjoyed XCOM and Marvel’s Midnight Suns, and to my development and publishing partners who helped bring those games to life.&quot;

                              <span>The stage of history
Like a Dragon has seen its main series&#x27; star continually rise in the west, and now we&#x27;re getting a remake of one that never managed to make it over. Like a Dragon: Ishin! is a remake of the 2014 game, tackling historical fiction through the lens of its characters, humor, and action.
While the anachronistic premise can and does lead to some outlandish moments, the good news is that for the most part, Ishin comes together well. Aside from technical hitches and some tedium in the main story, Like a Dragon: Ishin! is an enjoyable romp through history with all the bizarre slice-of-life moments and dramatic fights you could want.

Shortly after launch, Game Freak and the powers that be ominously mentioned an update would come eventually to address some of Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet&#x27;s lingering issues, and that day has come. Well, it&#x27;s coming, &quot;by the end of February,&quot; according to the official post on the Nintendo support page. Let&#x27;s dig into the big stuff.

Today brings news of a new studio entering the world of video game development — Wildlight Entertainment has been founded by a party of developers, almost all of whom have previously worked with Respawn Entertainment on major league titles such as Call of Duty, Titanfall, and Apex Legends.
In fact, the key founder of Wildlight Entertainment is Apex Legends&#x27; original game director, Chad Grenier, who announced the launching of the new studio on Twitter yesterday evening. Grenier heads up a team of over 10 individuals, all of whom have taken their leave of Respawn within the past two years. These include CEO Dusty Welch, project lead Mohammad Alvali, engineer Justin Cook, lead designer Carlos Pineda, project manager Amelia Duarte, and art director Robert Taube.

Currently working in a remote capacity, Wildlight Entertainment has physical offices established in both Los Angeles and Seattle, and is already hard at work on its first title: a brand new, yet-to-be-revealed IP. While the pertinent details are on the hush-hush, one can only assume that the team behind Apex Legends, Call of Duty, and Titanfall will be looking to deliver a highly polished action title, perhaps with a similarly sci-fi/futuristic slant.
You can read more on the company and its team over on the new Wildlight Entertainment website, or follow the studio on Twitter for updates, job vacancies, and more news and info. For action/shooter fans, this will definitely be one of the developers to watch in 2024 and beyond.

                              <span>A small slice of Ryoma&#x27;s swordplay
Like a Dragon: Ishin! is not far off from launch. But if the wait&#x27;s just a bit too long, there&#x27;s a demo for Ishin out today so you can get a taste of the new-old combat.
The &quot;Combat Demo&quot; is out now for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. The two-part combat demo covers a roughly 20-minute section of the game, specifically spotlighting the combat of Like a Dragon: Ishin, which sees Ryoma bringing his sword, gun, and fists to bear against foes.
The slice of Ishin covers both a brawl at Kiyomizu temple and a face-off with some armored foes. This demo looks to spotlight not just the fighting, but what enemies are bringing to the table to try and stop Ryoma. If he&#x27;s anything like his supposed descendant, though, there&#x27;s not much that can.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;kqkDNGqWrvE
Sega and RGG Studio have also revealed a special &quot;Dragon of Dojima&quot; skin, that will make Sakamoto Ryoma look just like Kazuma Kiryu, suit and all.
Heading back to an older era
Ishin is a remake of the earlier entry in the series, one which we never saw ported over to the west. It&#x27;s historical fiction, using the likenesses of many Like a Dragon series characters, but with different names, playing figures from the time in dramatized versions of the events.
Still, just because Kiryu is actually Ryoma, doesn&#x27;t mean there isn&#x27;t some classic Like a Dragon to get up to. Alongside the brawling you can see in the Ishin combat demo, there&#x27;s also the usual substories and side-games you&#x27;d expect from the series. Plus, an Another Life section where Ryoma can live it up as a peaceful farmer. What&#x27;s not to like about a slice of farming life inside this classically action-heavy series?
Like a Dragon: Ishin! goes live on Feburary 17 for Deluxe Digital pre-orders, and on February 21 for every other version.

Frogwares has announced their decision to delay the release of the detective adventure Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened. Initially, they had planned for the game to be out the door by February or March, but now they’re predicting it could land as late as April.
Frogwares has released a video to go along with the announcement to outline the difficulties they have been having. The developer is based out of Kyiv, Ukraine, and because of the Russian invasion targeting the country’s energy infrastructure, the team has had trouble maintaining a work schedule. The video also outlines how some members have to alternate working remotely and in office, depending on which site has power at the time.

While I haven’t played any of Frogwares’ Sherlock Holmes titles, I have gotten into The Sinking City, which I mostly enjoy. I’m mostly held back by the fact that I’ve never read any of the novels. Frogwares started their adventure series based off Arthur Conan Doyle’s detective stories back in 2001. Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened is a full remake of their third game, released back in 2007. They’ve been at it for a long time, and the series has gained its share of fans.
Frogwares isn’t the only developer trying to put together a game during an invasion. Much of Digital Dreams Entertainment, developers of Mutant Football League, are trying to create a sequel to their Football title. Likewise, GSC Gameworld is still pushing toward a release for S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl, and has already had to delay it for the same reason.
Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened will be coming to PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch sometime in March or April.

                              <span>Have you ever wanted to explore new realities and compelling narratives but need that initial push? For those who wish to try something new, the developers of Dyschronia: Chronos Alternate at MyDearest want to help you with a chance to win your choice of a PlayStation 5 Digital Edition, a Nintendo Switch OLED, or a Meta Quest 2 (128 GB).
Dyschronia: Chronos Alternate takes place in the city of Astrum Close where the crime rate is only 0.001%. Protagonist Hal Scion is a young investigator who possesses a special ability called “Memory Dive” that allows him to see into and alter the past and he uses this ability to collect evidence for investigations. When the founder of Astrum Close is found dead, Hal must take up the case in order to solve this theoretically “impossible” murder. The game is currently available on the Meta Quest 2, is launching on PlayStation VR2 on February 22nd, and launches on Nintendo Switch later this year.
One lucky winner can choose between a PlayStation 5 Digital Edition, a Nintendo Switch OLED, or a Meta Quest 2 (128 GB) to jumpstart their journey into the cyber-noir anime world of Dyschronia: Chronos Alternate.

                              <span>When The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time arrived on Nintendo 64, it quickly became Brian&#x27;s favorite video game he ever played. However, due to a series of circumstances and several failed attempts, he never played the direct sequel, Majora&#x27;s Mask. Now, in preparation for the sequel to his current favorite game of all time, Breath of the Wild, Brian is going back and playing the sequels he missed to his favorite games of all time.

Episode 1 - Death Finds A Way
Episode 2 - In Defense of The Lost World
After the success of Resident Evil, Capcom followed it up with a spiritual successor called Dino Crisis. The title follows a similar blueprint to Resident Evil but ditches zombies in favor of blood-thirsty dinosaurs. The game stars Regina, a special ops soldier sent with a team to investigate an island research facility that has been taken over by these prehistoric lizards. Join host Marcus Stewart with Kyle Hilliard on the sticks as the pair get to the bottom of whatever the heck is happening on this island and blast these critters back to extinction.

                              <span>Jake Solomon, the director of Marvel’s Midnight Suns and the modern XCOM games, has announced his departure from Firaxis. 
Solomon has worked at Firaxis for 23 years and is best known as the lead designer of XCOM: Enemy Unknown and the director of XCOM 2, including its War of the Chosen expansion. He most recently directed Marvel’s Midnight Suns. 
In a statement posted to Twitter, Solomon doesn’t state a specific reason for his resignation but does tease his next project by stating, “My brain is on fire with a new dream. Time to go chase it.” Whether or not this dream keeps him in the game industry is a mystery for now. You can read his full statement below.
Some of our favorite memories of Jake’s time at Firaxis include this funny video of him visiting a game store to convince shoppers to buy XCOM 1. He was also a great sport on our Marvel’s Midnight Suns Rapid-Fire interview. You can read our review of his final project at Firaxis, Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns, here.</span>

Like a Dragon: Ishin is not a new game. It&#x27;s a remake of an old game – 2014&#x27;s Ryu Ga Gotoku: Ishin, released only in Japan on the PS3 and PS4. And yet, despite the age of its skeleton, in some ways, the game stands out as one of the more impressive games in developer Ryu Ga Gotoku&#x27;s (RGG) portfolio – even with a few noticeable weak points. 
Ishin takes place in the 1860s, at the end of Japan&#x27;s Edo period. You play as Sakamoto Ryoma – a real-life historical figure – who, amid his own revenge scheme, finds himself embroiled in the …</span>

                              <span>Tetris is a new original film coming to Apple TV+, the iPhone maker&#x27;s streaming service, and if the first trailer for it is any indication, it looks like a great time. 
Released yesterday, Tetris begins with the classic Europe song, &quot;The Final Countdown,&quot; which then aptly transitions to Korobeiniki, the main theme of Tetris (you know the one). The trailer then showcases how Taron Egerton&#x27;s character is deadset on bringing Tetris to everybody after playing it once. Unable to get falling tetrominos out of his head, Egerton&#x27;s character heads to the Soviet Union to convince the game&#x27;s creator that he can make him a millionaire. 
Check it out for yourself in the Apple TV+ Tetris trailer below: 


As you can see, Tetris looks great – funny, suspenseful, dramatic, and a seemingly great retelling of how the &quot;greatest game ever made&quot; made its way to our hands via the NES and Game Boy. 
Tetris is directed by Jon S. Baird and written by Noah Pink. It begins streaming on Apple TV+ on March 31.

In an age where remakes and retro-inspired projects try recreating what classic games of old felt like, Octopath Traveler II accomplishes something impressive. Despite being rooted in modern design with a host of conveniences, it effortlessly captures the spirit, style, and sense of adventure of the best RPGs from the SNES era, while still innovating and showing there’s life in turn-based battles yet. The feat is even more remarkable, considering Octopath II’s most significant changes are small and subtle.

Updated with Fashion Police Squad and Metroid Prime Remastered. Enjoy!

Nintendo Switch&#x27;s bulging catalogue of games covers practically every genre, and First-Person Shooters are no exception. It&#x27;s a welcome change because Nintendo systems have historically lagged a little behind other consoles in the FPS field despite hosting some classics. After all, GoldenEye 007 and Perfect Dark helped define the FPS on consoles, and the Metroid Prime series shifted the exploration of the 2D Metroids into a first-person perspective to great effect. Still, Nintendo consoles have often missed out on the best multiplatform shooters.

A big, heavy Pokémon deserves a big ol&#x27; plushie, right? That&#x27;s obviously what The Pokémon Center thought with Wailord, who has a big of a reputation among Pokemon fans for its size.
Well, it&#x27;s a whale, so it should be big, right? Right. So it makes sense that you can buy a 57 ¾ inch-sized Wailord plush — that&#x27;s just shy of 1.5 metres, by the way. That&#x27;s 1/10th of the size of Wailord itself, so if you buy ten, then you can get an idea of just how big is. So what we&#x27;re saying is, yes, a plushie could squash you.

Nintendo&#x27;s most recent eShop sale in Europe, dubbed &#x27;February Fest&#x27;, features a metric boatload of brilliant games — so many, in fact, that it&#x27;s easy to get a little lost in all the quality. Sure, it&#x27;s pretty easy to short the shovelware from the silverware, but with such a bounty of riches, it can be difficult knowing where to start with the good stuff.
Fear not, for we are here with a helping hand to point you in the right direction. In this list, we&#x27;ve collected every game on sale that we&#x27;ve reviewed and awarded a 9/10 or higher. There are plenty of great 8/10s available too, but we&#x27;ve stuck to what our reviewers considered to be the real cream of the crop. We think you&#x27;ll agree that over 80 games is probably enough to be starting with!

This week, our good pal and Video Producer Zion was lucky enough to visit Super Nintendo World in Hollywood.
The park is now officially open to the public after a period of technical rehearsals, with none other than Shigeru Miyamoto in attendance at the grand opening.

Update : Following stories earlier this week of further increases in the PIF&#x27;s investment in Nintendo, Bloomberg now reports that Saudi Arabia&#x27;s Public Investment Fund now holds 8.3% of Nintendo, according to filings. This makes it the company&#x27;s largest shareholder outside of Japan.
According to Bloomberg&#x27;s data, this puts the PIF holding ahead of Japan&#x27;s Government Pension Investment Fund stake in Nintendo, and comes second only to Nintendo&#x27;s own shareholding.

We&#x27;ve seen plenty of press previews ahead of the park&#x27;s opening today, 17th February, but the father of Mario himself, Shigeru Miyamoto, has made the trip over to the West coast of America to attend the grand opening.
Appearing on-stage during the event (in the time-stamped video above), which took place on Wednesday night, Miyamoto charmed the audience — with stars of the upcoming Super Mario Bros. Movie and other famous faces in attendance. Miyamoto was introduced by CEO of Universal Parks &amp; Resorts Mark Woodbury and surrounded by Mario, Luigi, and Peach mascots.

                              <span>Eight roads diverged in a wood, and I... well, I took them all!
A year after the Switch released, Team Asano—who made its name on the Bravely Default games on 3DS—released Octopath Traveler for the Switch. The fascinating HD-2D art style immediately grabbed people’s attention, while the clever implementation of classic JRPG gameplay quickly stole the hearts of many. Now that it’s been a few more years and a couple more HD-2D titles have gone through production, the team opted to take another crack at the original formula with Octopath Traveler II. We’re happy to report that this is every bit the worthy sequel you hoped it would be, Octopath Traveler II quickly makes a case for itself as one of the very best JRPGs on Switch.
The narrative of this sequel follows in the footsteps of the original, centering around the personal stories of eight people in largely disconnected narratives. Temenos, for example, is an incredibly condescending and sassy cleric who has to solve the mystery of a string of mysterious murders related to the Church of Sacred Flame. Agnea the Dancer, on the other hand, is a small-town country bumpkin with a heart of gold who sets out on a journey to prove her skills and become a famous dancing star like her mother was. Some of the stories here feature quite heavy themes while others are equally lighthearted, but all of them are compelling in their own way. Importantly, these stories still feature their starring party member in an isolated role; the other party members don’t get involved in the plot because you can technically go through any character’s entire storyline without ever adding anyone else to the party.

It&#x27;s now been well over a few months since the launch of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. While the gameplay was quite enjoyable at launch, there were admittedly some bugs and technical issues. Game Freak was quick to address some of these problems with a few updates, but it seems it&#x27;s not done just yet.
On the game&#x27;s official support page, Nintendo has announced Version 1.2.0 is scheduled to arrive at the end of February.

                              <span>What did the critics think?
This week marks the return of Bandai Namco&#x27;s epic JRPG Tales of Symphonia. It started out in the early 2000s on the GameCube and now many years later has received a remaster.
We posted our Switch review earlier this week on Nintendo Life awarding the title 6 out of 10 stars. As much as we love this classic, it feels a bit light on the remaster side of things and is starting to show its age - especially on a platform like Switch which already has a stack of other great RPGs.

Parent company Sega Sammy has now spoken about the game&#x27;s reception and sales success in a Q&amp;A with investors - revealing the latest entry has &quot;greatly exceeded&quot; the original sales estimation. Frontiers is expected to continue to sell over the long term as well with the assistance of discounts and updates in the form of DLC.

We also take a gander at fantasy FPS Dark And Darker, Steam&#x27;s most wishlisted &#x27;shooter&#x27;. I&#x27;m less keen on it than Hayden is.
 In the second part of the pod, we talk about the goals we&#x27;ve achieved in theHunter: Call Of The Wild, including a tale about moose and a deer that knocked me out.

                              <span>Quickplay strategy games have always been a thing, but they appear to be gaining in popularity lately. I will probably regret not keeping Ozymandias aside for the traditional &quot;summer strategy game for when your brain is a gas&quot; bit, but the scene is looking healthy enough to chance it.
You know that cliché feeling of &quot;just one more turn&quot;? Ozymandias is a bronze age 4X that builds momentum enough to turn that into &quot;just one more game&quot;. It is incredibly easy to learn, and despite looking a little dry and number heavy, becomes more effortless, more pleasant the longer you play. It also becomes more clear how much depth there is hidden away in such a light design. It&#x27;s about proving yourself the most prestigious civilisation, not through total conquest, but by exploiting the lay of the land, and leaning into your strengths.

                              <span>I like wizards because they&#x27;re the dramatic combination of powerful, cocky, and a bit dim. Through some quirk of bloodline or destiny, wizards can access impossible forces simply by saying magic words. This does not engender caution. A wizard&#x27;s not a real wizard until they have accidentally set themselves on fire or unleashed an ancient evil. And if you throw four of this dim demigods together? Well, you get the co-op wizard action of the Magicka games, where freestyling elemental combinations can (and often will) lead you to heal a boss or torch your pal&#x27;s face. Splendid chaos.

This comes amid a studio shakeup with multiple senior roles sliding around the corporate conveyor belt. Firaxis also revealed that they’re in early development on the next Civilization game.

                              <span>Late last year, turn-based indie RPG The Outbound Ghost was delisted from Steam after a statement from lead dev Conrad Grindheim claimed his relationship with publisher Digerati had “dissolved.” Soon after, Digerati filed a lawsuit against developer Conradical over a breach of contract and “several false defamatory” statements. When reporting on the original news, CJ thought the messy situation could get messier, and he was right. Grindheim has now DMCA’d his own game on console storefronts and accused Digerati of withholding royalties.

                              <span>I am legendary ronin Sakomoto Ryoma. I shout &quot;yosh!&quot; as I harvest six (6) gleaming radishes from my allotment. I shoot a bandit in the head with a revolver. I send my adoptive daughter to trade some homemade pickles. I partake in a brooding chat, then stamp on a dude&#x27;s head. I help a recluse regain his confidence. I have totally forgotten what I was meant to be doing.
Like A Dragon: Ishin feels like a step backward, but in a brilliant way. Kiryu and co. may have moved onto a turn-based future, yet Sakomoto Ryoma and his pals have turned back the clock to an Edo period of brawlin&#x27; and chicken betting that&#x27;s most reminiscent of Yakuza 0, only it&#x27;s not the roaring 80s but the bloody 1800s. There&#x27;s nothing here that will convert those who aren&#x27;t keen on the series, but if you&#x27;re an ardent fan or a newcomer eager to experience its wild swings between serious and silly, Ishin is an excellent place to start.

                              <span>Magic doesn&#x27;t always need to be like, cauldrons of bubbling newts. I&#x27;d say building a romantic connection with a wrestler entirely formed of green ooze, or training your M.E.A.T. at Mrs. Muscles gym counts as magic – pure magic, even. And that&#x27;s what Wrestling With Emotions: New Kid On The Block offers. It&#x27;s a wrestling dating sim with a splash of RPG, and almost certainly a game that&#x27;ll pin your heart in a bear hug and never let go.

That&#x27;s Octopath Traveler 2 in a nutshell, a JRPG that follows so precisely in the footsteps of its predecessor that you&#x27;d be forgiven for thinking it was suddenly 2019 again and that the last few pandemic years were nothing but a terrible existential nightmare. But alas, here we are in 2023 with another Octopath Traveler game that is, bar a couple of very light tweaks and additions, exactly the same game as what came before it, for better and for worse.

                              <span>Ve středu 15. února 2023 vyšla nová verze firewallu pfSense Plus 23.01. Zajímavostí této verze je, že jí autoři postavili na FreeBSD 14-CURRENT. Nutno dodat, že CURRENT je vývojová verze a oficiállní verze FreeBSD 14.0-RELEASE by měla vyjít až v červenci 2023. Konzervativní přístup se tímto u pfSence značně mění. Přínosem jsou zcela jistě nové ovladače síťových karet. Další velkou změnou je přechod na PHP 8.1.</span>

                              <span>Recently we finally received the GeForce RTX 4080 and RTX 4090 graphics cards for Linux testing from NVIDIA. For those that have been eager to see how the RTX 40 series hardware performs under Linux, here are my initial Linux gaming benchmarks featuring a variety of Linux native titles as well as with Steam Play for running Windows games on Linux atop Proton + DXVK/VKD3D-Proton. The GeForce RTX 4080/4090 Linux performance is compared against a variety of other graphics cards including the new Radeon RX 7900 XTX with its open-source upstream Linux driver support.</span>

It&#x27;s down to $99.99 for a 1TB model and $159.99 for a 2TB size, a new low price for each capacity and a great deal for our top PCIe 4.0 SSD recommendation. 
This SSD is only really rivalled by the more expensive Samsung 990 Pro, our overall &#x27;fastest SSD&#x27; recipient, with both options offering random write performance well over 1M IOPS and sequential read speeds of up to 7300MB/s, at the very limit of the PCIe 4.0 standard.

That&#x27;s a heavy reduction from its original $169.99 price point, and an awesome value for a drive that works well in PCs and even PS5s.

                              <span>Hot diggedy daffodil, am I glad I picked Casual difficulty in Veil Of Dust. Unlike some games, Veil Of Dust doesn&#x27;t make it sound like any sort of concession; the middle difficulty is called Challenge, and says &quot;it&#x27;s pretty tough - you&#x27;ve been warned&quot;. I took the warning seriously, and thank God, because even the easiest difficulty had me pouring dandelion tea down my brother&#x27;s throat like he was doing a kegstand (and in the game).
Áine and Shane are a pair of Irish siblings who&#x27;ve moved to Oregon to start a new life, which, in the main story, involves eating potatoes and trying not to get depressed. It&#x27;s difficult enough that I didn&#x27;t think I would like it at first, as even basic tasks deplete your stamina and sleeping in your 1860s hovel with a hole in the roof doesn&#x27;t restore very much per night. Áine can do spells, but they&#x27;re simple and only really take the edge off what is a very hard life. Magic isn&#x27;t a cure-all in Veil Of Dust, and using it has to be weighed up, just like everything else.

                              <span>From the heady mists of 1994 once came Master Of Magic, an all-time best 4X loosely summarisable as Civilisation crossed with Master Of Orion.
In the... uh, semi-heady fog of 2019 came the news that it was getting a remake, and I was muchly excited, for in the interim I&#x27;d actually learned the original existed and how good and somehow unrivalled it still was. And finally, in the slight damp of late 2022, that remake arrived. It is a remarkably faithful remake, to a degree I may not ever have seen for such an old game. Some details and flourishes aside, it&#x27;s basically the same design, with all the same parts.

Coincidentally, I&#x27;ve also finally got into Total Warhammer lately, and spent some time reacquainting myself with Warlords Battlecry, and in between building city walls and crushing stupid aryan elfs, I&#x27;ve realised what truly connects all three: balance. They all, correctly, reject it.

The team have described the initiative as a launchpad for indies in the “rapidly growing Danish games industry and beyond.” Ghost Ship Publishing haven’t announced any games yet, but we’ll get to see their upcoming projects on March 2nd as part of Deep Rock Galactic’s fifth-anniversary livestream.

Do you know what the most delayed game ever is? Because the title recently changed hands. This plus what we&#x27;ve been playing, a new hardware update, and a round of &quot;what video game should Shakespeare play?&quot;

The last game in his dark action-platformer series, Alice: Madness Returns, released more than ten years ago, and since then McGee has been funding development through a Patreon which, at the time of writing, currently has 3,192 paying members. In 2021, McGee released the first draft of a script, and now he’s back with a 414-page design bible, the announcement of a partner studio, and an odd plea to EA.

It’s good, though! I really like it, and as a huge Monster Hunter fan I’m pleased that there’s finally a worthy alternative to Capcom’s long-running series. Competition is good!

Now, you’ll just need to own Warhammer 3 for access to the campaign.

                              <span>It’s the dead of night. I’m in my little tugboat out on open waters. I can barely see three feet in front of my nose because of the thick blanket of fog, but I&#x27;m trying my hand at night fishing, hoping to hook something really good. I find a squid spot and start to fish, reeling in one or two fine-looking catches. The third one, however, is monstrous, a mess of jagged teeth and sickly pale flesh. Yes, this should make for a fine amount of cash. The more morbid it is, the more money I get. Suddenly there’s a deep rumbling in the ocean and panic starts to creep in. I chuck my prize into my cargo and speed back to town, the phrase ‘fuck round, find out’ circling my brain.
I’ve not been playing Dredge long, but I’m calling it one of my favourite games of the year, right now, in February. Black Salt Games&#x27; sinister fishing RPG is gripping and enchanting in a way I didn’t anticipate. I’ve spent hours exploring its murky waters and my constant shock at what unsettling creatures my hook brings in is seemingly never-ending. Its eldritch world keeps pulling me back with its mystery and malevolent horror, and its sense of atmosphere and tension is incredible. Basically, I&#x27;m completely enraptured, hook, line, sinker. Dredge already feels like one of this year’s greatest indie horrors and all this, from a fishing game of all things.

Valve have now quietly edited their original announcement blog post, walking back the hype while emphasising the community-developed aspects of the update.

I’ve put together this settings guide – based on the game’s early trial build – for those who want to join the hunt pronto, but above all else my advice is to wait until developers Omega Force get the promised performance improvements up and running. From what I’ve played, Wild Hearts’s bad shape is doing an otherwise enjoyable Monster Hunter-like a huge disservice.

Sega and Creative Assembly have announced that one of the most lavishly massive campaigns for any strategy game is finally exiting the beta stage for Total War: Warhammer III. Immortal Empires merges the worlds of all three Total War: Warhammer games into one giant map, complete with every faction released across the series.
February 17th marks a full year since the launch of Total War: Warhammer III. During that time, the team has been plucking away at the Immortal Empires mode within it, providing it to players to collect feedback on. They’ve made tweaks and additions, such as end-game goals, and now it’s time to see it in its completed glory.
Best yet, anyone who owns Total War: Warhammer III will have access to the campaign mode. Previously, you had to own its two pred…</span>

Some fucking sadist has chosen absolute chaos, and developed an edition of 2020 spider-hunting title Kill It with Fire for the VR market — Yes, you can now &quot;enjoy&quot; the destructive, terrifying, hide &#x27;n&#x27; seek nature of the Man vs. Arachnid release in fully immersive virtual reality fashion. Thanks?
Kill It with Fire VR will recreate the over-the-top action of the original release, as players search a variety of locations including houses, gas stations, farms, and, of course, bathrooms for the eight-legged critters. Track down a menagerie of creepy crawlies, before engaging in mortal combat with an arsenal of household implements, ninja weapons, firearms, and other super bombastic weaponry. The virtual reality edition of this absolute nightmare will utilize a new &quot;VRACHNID&quot; mechanic to allow for better detection.

&quot;Fans have been asking for a VR version of Kill It With Fire since the very first footage of the original game,&quot; notes Casey Donnellan, solo developer of Kill It With Fire and thus a monstrous person. &quot;I&#x27;m really happy that we can finally put horrifying spiders on a screen less than an inch from players&#x27; eyeballs!&quot;
All jesting aside, I actually really like spiders. Oh, I&#x27;m pretty scared of them, and one actually bit me last year, (always shake out your shoes, folks). But I do think our scuttling pals are pretty darn cool, as well as being fascinating, intelligent, and important creatures. Anyway, Kill It with Fire VR is scheduled to launch &quot;soon&quot; on PlayStation VR 1 &amp; 2, SteamVR, and Meta Quest 2.
I&#x27;m probably going to assign the review to CJ Andriessen. He&#x27;ll love it.

                              <span>Revenge is a dish best served all the time
34BigThings has announced that it&#x27;s dropping its loose interactive adaptation of Roberto Saviano’s novel Gomorrah today. The plot seems unconnected with either the book or the 2014 Italian TV show of the same name, instead utilizing a similar crime drama approach to the narrative.
In Gomorrah, you take the role Nina Miniero, the daughter of a Naplese crime boss. After Nina’s 18th birthday party is attacked and her father murdered, she takes the reins of the crime family and drives it on a collision course with revenge. You lead the family through various procedurally created missions, making each playthrough different. There are eight possible endings that you’ll reach based on your choices.
Gomorrah is presented largely as a choice-driven visual novel with visuals crafted by comic artist Luca Negri. Gameplay is largely resource management and decision-making. The team has stated that they weren’t able to work with author Roberto Saviano himself, but a screenwriter from the TV series provided some guidance.

I really enjoy the visual style of this game, and it sounds like an interesting experience. Something about it is giving me pause, however. I definitely don’t mind more menu-heavy gameplay, but it might just be that I’m not that big into violent crime drama. I’m familiar with neither the book nor the TV show. Still, at release, Gomorrah will run for $3, so it’s not a big investment if you want to take a peek.
Gomorrah is available today on PC, iOS, and Android.

                              <span>The Dragon of Dojima steps back in time
Sega and Ryu ga Gotoku Studio are currently gearing up for the launch of Like a Dragon: Ishin! A full remake of the 2014 spin-off title in the Yakuza/Like a Dragon series of action-RPGS — And speaking of yesteryear, the studios announced that a special DLC skin is included in Ishin&#x27;s Deluxe Edition, which sees the return of the eponymous Like a Dragon protagonist, Kazuma Kiryu!
The &quot;Dragon of Dojima&quot; DLC will allow players to dress Ishin&#x27;s hero like his centuries-later descendant, complete with his iconic silver-grey suit and snakeskin shoes. It should be noted that this is just an aesthetic skin, Sakamoto will not literally become Kazuma — But if you fancied turning the attractive, period-piece world of Edo Japan into an absolutely dreadful anachronism, then you&#x27;re sorted.
In this short trailer, you can see Sakamoto looking slick as he gets his ears cleaned out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;kqkDNGqWrvE&amp;ab_channel&#x3D;SEGA
Like a Dragon: Ishin! is a full remake of the 2014 PS3 release of the same name, and follows the adventures of Ryoma Sakamoto, who becomes embroiled in a local war of houses while investigating the murder of his sensei. Like a Dragon: Ishin! continues the hard-boiled drama, violent action, and a little of the tongue-in-cheek nature that is the trademark of the Like a Dragon series, but never saw the light of day outside of Japan, with Sega concerned that the game&#x27;s setting and characters might not localize well enough to warrant the effort .
One should remember that the series then was not the highly recognized brand that it has become today, specifically since the launch of 2015&#x27;s Yakuza 0, which was a huge hit on the PS4 platform.
Like a Dragon: Ishin! launches February 21 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

                              <span>Gluttony ho!
XSEED and Marvelous Europe have announced that they will be publishing BattleBrew Productions’ dungeon-crawling cooking title, Cuisineer, this summer. If you’re planning on watching the trailer, I feel I must warn you: it might make you hungry.
Cuisineer will combine the horrors of the food-service industry with the pleasures of dungeon crawling. Playing as cute-as-heck aspiring chef, Pom, you will plumb the dark recesses of the world for ingredients to serve to your customers. You’ll weaponize your utensils to take on bigger, badder bosses in an effort to build the best recipes for your discerning customers.
I’m sorry, I’m a bit distracted here. I keep looking at the food.

Beyond ingredients, dungeon diving will net you gold, items, and additional recipes. The dungeons are procedurally assembled, giving you something new each time you plumb them. As you gather wealth and renown, you’ll expand your restaurant so you can serve more customers and thereby gather even more wealth and renown.
This is cute. This reminds me of 2010’s Recettear in its combination of dungeon diving and business management. The gameplay loop of setting out into the world and returning to reap the rewards is an addicting one. Better yet, I’m enamored by the graphics. Not just the food, but just the bright colorfulness of its all, its chibi characters, and the pleasant-looking towns. Also, the food. I’m not hungry right now, but the way the highlights are drawn on those meals makes me want to eat and deal with the consequences later.
Cuisineer will be coming to PC in Summer, 2023.

                              <span>Where&#x27;s my gurl Juri at?
Here&#x27;s a delightfully nostalgic piece of memorabilia — Capcom has partnered with merchandise maker Big Shots to produce a series of rough &#x27;n&#x27; tumble plush toys based on some of the World Warriors of its iconic fighting game series, Street Fighter.
The initial Street Fighter Big Shots line features eternal rivals Ryu and Ken, as well as the All-American Guile, and the Brazilian beast Blanka. Each Big Shot is packed with premium polyester filling and printed on soft velvet polyester cover. Each character is available in two sizes — 22&quot; x 19&quot; or 16&quot; x 14&quot; — and weighs 1.5 lbs or 16 ounces, respectively. Either way, they&#x27;re built to take a kicking, so you can practice your Shoryukens until the cows come home.

Of course, fans of a certain age will no doubt be instantly reminded of the massively popular WWF Wrestling Buddies of the late &#x27;80s, which saw similar toys made of stars such as Hulk Hogan, Ultimate Warrior, Jake &quot;The Snake&quot; Roberts, and &quot;The Million Dollar Man&quot; Ted Dibiase. I personally never had one myself, but I remember them being around in abundance.
So, Big Shots, drop a Juri and I can finally make up for lost toy time. 42 years old.
The Street Fighter Big Shots are available for a limited time over on the official Big Shots website. The 16&quot; versions retail for $49.99 USD, while the 22&quot; version retails for $69.99, not including shipping charges.

                              <span>Plus, two other Forge spinoffs have windows
Riot Forge, the publishing arm for spin-offs of Riot Games&#x27; League of Legends series, has locked in another game set in Runeterra. The Mageseeker: A League of Legends Story is an action RPG following League of Legends champion Sylas, developed by Digital Sun, and arriving this year.
The Mageseeker will see players take control of Sylas, an escaped mage in search of vengenace and looking to take it out on Demacia. It&#x27;s a 2D action RPG where Sylas and the player will raise a mage army and eventually lead a revolution. Digital Sun, the tema behind merchant RPG Moonlighter, is making The Mageseeker. It&#x27;s set to arrive in spring 2023 for PC and console.

Additionally, the Riot Forge locked in release windows for two other projects. Song of Nunu, a character-action game from Tequila Works starring Nunu and Willump, is aiming for fall 2023. And Convergence, a single-player 2D action platformer starring time-bending champion Ekko and developed by Double Stallion Games, arrives in summer 2023.
Fanning the Forge
Riot Forge covers the ongoing third-party efforts to expand out the world of League of Legends. Games have been steadily rolling out of it, too; we&#x27;ve already seen the likes of auto-runner Hextech Mayhem and the Airship Syndicate-developed RPG Ruined King.
All the while, Riot Games is also crafting its own dive into the world of League of Legends. The fighting game Project L sits somewhere on the horizon, and other projects lurk around. Add on the likes of Teamfight Tactics and the successful Arcane series, and it feels like League of Legends has expanded far beyond its MOBA bounds at this point.
That&#x27;s probably a good thing, for those who dug stories like Arcane but aren&#x27;t keen on playing some 5-on-5 in the Rift. We&#x27;ll see what the Forge has in store as more of its projects roll out throughout 2023.

Following that big Nintendo Direct and the surprise release of Metroid Prime Remastered, even more games are on the way. Theatrhythm Final Bar Line is the big one, and should be relevant for quite some time with DLC songs that span Square Enix&#x27;s lengthy history, and dip into multiple IPs. Oh look, we have a review for it!
Tales of Symphonia Remastered is going to be a big deal for many other RPG fans, as is Digimon World: Next Order. Those come out on February 17 and February 22 respectively. Other than that, there&#x27;s the typical 40+ game eShop dump, so be prepared to once again sift through a ton of stuff to get to something you want.
The next big milestone for Nintendo is Kirby&#x27;s Return to Dream Land Deluxe on February 24, followed by Bayonetta Origins …</span>

It’s hard to believe Flying Wild Hog’s Shadow Warrior games started off as a retro revival of the 3D Realms’ 1997 Build Engine title. While the 2013 game made references to the original, it was very much its own thing. Then I skipped the second title because it would make me feel lonely to play it by myself, and now we’re at Shadow Warrior 3, and it’s unrecognizable.
That’s where we were last year, I guess. This is Shadow Warrior 3: Definitive Edition.
The Definitive Edition comes with survival mode and a new game plus, but otherwise, it’s the same Wang. I haven’t gotten intimate with this Wang yet, so thankfully, my experience will never not be definitive.

What do you get when you cross a bear with a huge bag of cocaine? Well, the answer&#x27;s yet to be revealed, as the upcoming film Cocaine Bear isn&#x27;t released until February 27. However, in the promotional run-up to its release the movie&#x27;s official Twitter account has unveiled a surprise new game in the form of Cocaine Bear: The Rise of Pablo Escobear.
You play as the bear, in search of red bags of cocaine to help you run faster. The end goal? Catch up to the humans and tear them apart. Delightful, right? This browser-based game requires gamers to be at least 18 to play, which is a much stricter age requirement than Namco&#x27;s original Pac-Man.

                              <span>Wild enough, and a lotta heart
When I first picked up Dynasty Warriors 2 from a Blockbuster Video over two decades ago, I never expected that I&#x27;d play so many Omega Force games throughout my lifetime. The cover called to me like a siren&#x27;s song, and I was introduced to what would become an endless onslaught of hack and slash games pretty much every year from there on out.
But many folks have forgotten that they also helmed the Toukiden series: an action romp planted firmly in the hunting genre. Well, now they&#x27;re back with Wild Hearts, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier about it.

Anti-piracy coalition ACE cooperated with the authorities to take down the piracy ring.

                              <span>Marvel’s Midnight Suns gets its second story expansion next week in the form of the aptly titled “Redemption.” It stars Venom, looking to right the wrongs he’s committed, but he’s going to have to overcome the powerful demon Mephisto to do it. 
The trailer shows Eddie Brock, having recovered from the events of the main campaign, making a deal with Mephisto to help rid himself of his darkness. Naturally, this goes about as well as you would expect, leading to Venom joining the Midnight Suns as a playable character to battle this formidable demonic threat. 


Redemption will be available on February 23. It comes included with the game&#x27;s season pass. Firaxis&#x27; role-playing strategy take on the Marvel universe has already received DLC in the form of a Deadpool character and mission pack. Despite the game receiving positive reviews (including cracking Game Informer’s Top 10 Games of 2022), it was recently revealed to have underperformed in sales.</span>

                              <span>Sound design is an often overlooked and underappreciated element of many games, but it&#x27;s an element Capcom takes very seriously in Resident Evil 4. As horrific as the game looks, it&#x27;s the soundtrack and creepy sound effects that do much of the heavy lifting in building fear and tension. To understand how the remake remixes and enhances the original game&#x27;s soundscape, I picked the brains of RE4 sound director Hiroshi Tamura and lead composer Kota Suzuki to learn how they&#x27;re making the game sound as good as it plays. 
Game Informer: A goal for the Resident Evil 4 remake is to create more believable soundscapes. Can you discuss what that means, with examples, and why that&#x27;s important to the team?
Hiroshi Tamura: For the remake, we wanted to pay great attention to the sound throughout the game…</span>

Wild Hearts may seem similar to Monster Hunter and other hunting genre games, but its focus on constructing gadgets in a world steeped in Japanese folklore and feudal-era Japan help it carve its own identity. Like Monster Hunter, you track big game, craft new armor and weapons, and do it all over again. But the otherworldly take on old-world Japan, filled with giant mythical beasts, is a profo…</span>

                              <span>Riot Games released a promotional video this morning revealing its plans to release three League of Legends spin-off games this year. Two of these titles, Song of Nunu and Convergence, had been previously announced, while the third game, The Mageseeker, makes it debut. 


The Mageseeker is set to arrive first sometime this spring. Developed by Digital Sun, the team behind Moonlighter, it’s described as a gritty 2D action RPG. It stars Sylas and takes place in Demacia. You can find The Mageseeker on PC and unspecified consoles. 
Convergence launches this summer and was first revealed at The Game Awards in 2019. Starring Ekko, it’s a 2D action-platforming adventure by Double Stallion that features parkour and time-manipulation mechanics. Convergence launches for PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Switch, and PC via Steam and Epic. 
Song of Nunu closes out the year. Releasing this fall, it centers on the young Nunu and his yeti partner Willump on a search to find Nunu’s mother. The charming adventure game focuses on the pair working together to solve environmental puzzles. Song of Nunu comes from the folks at Tequila Works, the developer of titles such as Rime and Gylt, and it will be available on PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Switch, and PC via Steam and Epic. 
Riot released its first League of Legends spin-off Ruined King in 2021 to generally positive reviews, so we&#x27;re curious to see how these other projects fair and if they&#x27;ll attract new, non-MOBA fans coming off Netflix&#x27;s well-received Arcane series. Which League of Legends title are you most interested in?

These triple buffering patches still haven&#x27;t been upstreamed as of the GNOME 44 release due out next month, but the patches continue to be carried within Debian and Ubuntu among other distributions.

                              <span>It’s probably not a huge surprise to say that Pentiment, Obsidian Entertainment’s visually intriguing mystery set in 16th century Bavaria, required a lot of historical research during development. What may surprise you, however, is how deep these historical details run throughout Pentinment’s DNA, right down the game’s text fonts. Obsidian design director Josh Sawyer told me all about how the team revived long-dead historical fonts, to give them a new life in a modern format.

                              <span>Last time, you decided that throwing knives are better than active reload. I enjoyed the spirited discussion over which throwing knives are good and which are bad. I can&#x27;t help but feel active reload didn&#x27;t get a fair shake because so few games do it outside Gears Of War, but the results are science and we must continue. This week, I suppose our choices are both about architecture, but in very different ways. What&#x27;s better: funicular fights or elaborate corridor architecture?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve never had much of a desire for &quot;I&#x27;m attending school&quot; sims, because I hated attending school and not having to do it is one of the prime benefits of growing out of your teens. Running a school though? That&#x27;s a challenge I don&#x27;t mind taking on. Twopoint Campus does a great plate-spinning take on a school admin sim, but if you want something with cards, a dark lord, and the option for organic school meals, then... well, then you&#x27;re making a very specific request. But it&#x27;s one I can fulfil with Spellcaster University. And it&#x27;s bloody difficult.

                              <span>Returnal is here on PC and lo and behold, it’s not as scary as it looked. In a hardware demanding, recommended spec kind of way, at least – those lanky alien tree-man enemies are greying what little hair I have left.
Like previous Playstation port Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered, it’s not the most easygoing game either, but I’ve cycled through my share of deaths and rebirths and can report that Returnal will make do with older graphics cards and middling RAM counts. It’s a mostly well-considered porting job too, with optional ray tracing, various upscaling tools, ultrawide support for 21:9 and 32:9 monitors, and pages upon pages of customisable display and control settings.

                              <span>The last thing you need when you’ve just crash-landed on an unknown planet teeming with predatory wildlife is to discover you’re also stuck in a time loop. But that’s the fate of deep-space astronaut Selene in Returnal, when she ditches her single-seater vessel on a remote rock called Atropos. Each time she falls foul of the local fauna, she pops back into existence right next to her broken ship, with no obvious means of escape. Forget Aliens vs Predator, this is Aliens vs Groundhog Day.
But what a day it is, as Returnal combines a best-in-class third-person shooter with a deep dive into the psychology of its protagonist. Selene’s journey into Atropos, through a thick jungle, a burning vermilion desert and beyond, sends her circling through a smorgasbord of emotions – from confusion to hope, despair to determination. And so often, her mood dovetails with your own highs and lows of elation and frustration, until every part of Returnal encases you in its loop.

You are the Sandman, and you are neither sprinkling happy dust on Danish eyelids nor delivering Liberace-haired boyfriends to vocal quartets. Instead, you’re an active fighter of nightmares, diving into the brains of restless kids to explore their most traumatic memories and, ultimately, defeat the monstrous embodiments of their fears.

                              <span>Wild Hearts developers Omega Force are looking to lower the blades of disgruntled PC players, penning a Steam news update that acknowledges performance issues with the early trial of their Monster Hunter-y RPG.


&quot;Omega Force are working continuously to improve performance and optimise the game for a wide variety of hardware specs across future updates&quot;, the note reads. It also confirms that support for both DLSS and FSR upscalers is on the way, and asks those who’ve found their hunts scuppered by dodgy performance to report their issues to EA’s support team.

                              <span>Loathe as I am to become one of those &quot;want to feel old?&quot; types of posters, this review requires me to point out that the original Pharaoh came out in 1999, almost 25 years ago. It was one of that era&#x27;s City Building series that included Zeus and all of the Caesars, a run of games so good that they earned the capital letters. Pharaoh also happens to be one of my foundational video games, and I played it when I was knee-high to my big brother&#x27;s desk, at a time when family homes had one (1) yellow-grey computer with a CRT screen. And now it&#x27;s back, baby.
Pharaoh: A New Era means I can play that game of my childhood on my shiny black RGB-lit bastard. Honestly though, the &quot;A New Era&quot; part is a bit much. Sure, the updated graphics are fabulous and the quality of life changes mean it plays like smooth peanut butter to the 90s&#x27; extra crunchy. It&#x27;s a good remake of a solid game, but the mummy in the casket is fundamentally the same.

                              <span>Riot have announced a brand new (previously leaked) League Of Legends spin-off coming this year. The Mageseeker: A League Of Legends Story is a 2D action RPG from Digital Sun, the dev team behind Moonlighter, which was a delightful fusion of roguelike action and shopkeeping. The Mageseeker is launching this spring, while the other LoL spin-offs have also received release windows for 2023.

I first became aware of this upcoming game while covering last summer&#x27;s Future Of Play Direct, and I&#x27;ve been itching to write something about it ever since. Happily, as part of RPS Magic Week, I&#x27;ve had the opportunity to speak with Florian Mann, CEO and co-founder of Spells &amp; Secrets development team Alchemist Interactive.

Now developer Balancing Monkey is back for another go at spacefaring management, but this time your city is built on top of a space whale, rather than being terrorised by one. Their follow-up, Beyond These Stars, will be hitting early access on PC later this year.

                              <span>I kind of hate mechanical hard drives these days. Yes, they&#x27;re cheap per gigabyte, yes they&#x27;re fairly reliable, yes they&#x27;re absolutely the way to go if you need to store a lot of data and don&#x27;t care how long it takes to access it. But. But. These drives are hard to go back to after you&#x27;re used to SSDs, with their near-instant access times, completely silent operation, resistance to shocks, drops and magnets and of course their overall SPEED. 
So when I had the chance, I bought the biggest SSD I could afford, a 4TB model at the time, and copied literally every bit of data from the four or five 1TB or smaller hard drives that I&#x27;d bought over the years and stuck into my increasingly full PC tower. It was expensive, and it took ages to copy everything across, but as soon as I turned my computer on for the first time and I didn&#x27;t have to listen to the clicks and whirs of a mechanical drive, I was completely convinced I&#x27;d made the right call to ditch spinning rust.

Now its developers say they want to release smaller and cheaper expansions more regularly, with quarterly updates filling the gaps in between.

It&#x27;s one of the games I&#x27;m most looking forward to in 2023, and its latest trailer just cements that. It&#x27;s three-minutes-long, has no music, and simply lets you revel in the &quot;satisfaction in reclamation&quot;.

                              <span>I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: if there’s a cute animal game that looks like it’s going to make me cry, then sign me up, I’m ready to go. In fairness, though, co-op adventure Blanc looks like it&#x27;s going to be a lot lighter than games like Endling: Extinction is Forever and the notoriously upsetting Shelter series at first glance, but I’ve learned to never let my guard down around these kinds of games. Those cute art styles are almost always a front for a brutal sneak attack on your emotions.
Blanc is very much aiming for your heartstrings with its adorable animal duo and picturesque snowy landscapes. The first half teases massive potential for a cutesy story with fun puzzle antics, but the game is majorly let down by a repetitive and often frustrating second half and lacklustre ending. After the promise of a warm, cosy adventure, I watched the end credits roll and couldn&#x27;t help feeling like I&#x27;d been left out in the cold.

                              <span>I am loving all the magical witchy games we’ve been covering for RPS Magic Week, but I wanna learn how to actually be a witch, you know? I wanna learn the witchy ways, and not just from some not-so-well informed TikToks. 
Thankfully, So May It Be has been my gateway to Witchcraft 101. It’s a sapphic dating sim about a bunch of witches just hanging out doing witchy things. You&#x27;re part of a small coven with your three friends, and you all meet online every night to chat about school, shitty part-time jobs, and of course, witchcraft. At the end of each evening, you can privately ask one of your friends to hang out the next day 1 on 1, getting to know them better and just doing cool witch shit.

                              <span>The upcoming theme park management sim Park Beyond gave us a lovely Valentine’s Day-themed trailer, except, wait a second, this isn’t lovely at all, Oh God. I’m sure Park Beyond will be a wholesome bit of fun - creating outlandish rollercoasters and managing the nuts &amp; bolts of a made-up business is always a good time. But, good grief, there’s something seriously disturbing about its latest trailer.

                              <span>It’s been five whole years since the Firewatch devs announced their tomb-raiding adventure, In The Valley Of Gods, and in that time the idea of the game itself has fossilised. The first-person archaeology game was put on hold in 2019 after Valve acquired Campo Santo and had them support other Valve projects like Half-Life: Alyx. Now Campo&#x27;s in-limbo game has a December 2029 listing on Steam, which almost certainly means nothing, but it’s fun to dust off some memories.

                              <span>Overwatch 2’s third season is well underway, adding more of the usual maps, modes, and cosmetics. The big surprise this season is the Valentine’s themed Loverwatch, a non-canon text adventure that allows you to court either Mercy or Genji. Naturally, I chose to date Genji (described as Overwatch’s “bad boy”), and the results were surprising. It’s cringe-y and occasionally grating, but it’s also surprisingly charming and stuffed with referential humour that OW fans will surely love.

                              <span>Most great platforming games dabble with gravity at some point. It&#x27;s one of those classic, age-old moments where you&#x27;re suddenly walking on the ceilings and jumping over gaps upside down to further test your skill and overall dexterity. Gravity Castle, on the other hand, has seemingly made it its entire premise, making for a brilliant Next Fest demo that&#x27;s still available to download on Steam right now. It also looks absolutely gorgeous, channelling Ico and the rest of Fumito Ueda&#x27;s oeuvre in all the right ways.

As you face down endless enemies, you draw and play cards representing individual attacks and power-ups, drafting new and more powerful cards as you level up. I dig it! In another time, this might have been a wee hit Flash game on Newgrounds.

                              <span>I think Wanted: Dead wants to be a singleplayer, third-person action game with kickass combat and a colourful cyberpunk universe that slides effortlessly between gritty and silly. And I&#x27;m guessing it wants players to experience the joys of shredding goons, and a story told through unpredictable cuts to karaoke and anime. I&#x27;m sad to report that it isn&#x27;t any of these things. Aside from the tiniest glimpses of cool when a combo comes together, the game clearly doesn&#x27;t know what it wants to be, or if it did once upon a time, its original vision must&#x27;ve gotten lost under a dogpile of ideas. I rooted for it when I first saw it way back when, and got excited when I heard it was being made by devs behind Ninja Gaiden and Dead or Alive, but what&#x27;s arrived is a jumbled mess that fights you at every turn. If I were Debra Meadon playing it for the first time live on Dragon&#x27;s Den, and someone sidled up behind me and pressed a katana to my throat, I would still carefully put the controller down and say, &quot;It&#x27;s a no from me&quot;.

                              <span>Magic is weird. And, since an Ordinary (non-magical person) suddenly getting magic is also deemed weird in Ikenfell, it stands to reason that it’s practically guaranteed to happen. We can only assume the odds become even higher as the Ordinary ventures closer to the big magical fantasy school, which protagonist Maritte quickly discovers. Upon approaching the gate in search of her missing sister, Safina, Maritte suddenly starts to sling fiery spells.
Those new spells certainly come in handy, as Maritte finds herself fired up (hehe, geddit?) and ready to fight through this Paper Mario-style tactical RPG. Along with some of Saf’s old friends, you explore the titular school and surrounding areas, searching for clues that might help unravel the mystery. Ikenfell has challenging combat and lots of little secrets hidden in its 8-bit world, but it’s the loveable bunch of pals (both allies and rivals) that really made me smile. Oh, and some of them have killer theme tunes that I can’t stop singing.

                              <span>Steam Next Fest may be over for another few months, but luckily some game demos are still alive and kicking. This is excellent news, as it means you&#x27;ve still got time to give Roots Of Yggdrasil a go, a chill, Viking citybuilder that has such strong Okami vibes with its inky, cell-shaded visuals, strong black outlines, and flute and harp-driven soundtrack that I kept having to remind myself I wasn&#x27;t just playing a spin-off of Clover&#x27;s seminal Zelda-like. I swear, if it weren&#x27;t for the smattering of autumnal trees in the tutorial level, its grassy plains, tall mountains and bright blue river would have been a dead ringer for Okami&#x27;s Kamiki Village.

                              <span>Everyone’s favourite lesbian road trip RPG Get In The Car, Loser! has released its second expansion pack and this one’s chunky. For the uninitiated, Get In The Car, Loser! begins the way all retro RPGs do, with a group of young misfits who decide to fight a world-ending calamity, or sometimes to fight God. The only difference here is that it’s named after one-of-many iconic Mean Girls quotes, and yes, your party features lesbians. The antithesis of Final Fantasy 15, really.

                              <span>Illumination has taken its promotion of The Super Mario Bros. Movie to the next level by launching a website and commercial promoting the brothers’ New York City plumbing business, and it&#x27;s actually pretty cool. 
You can visit the website here, which features a commercial promoting the Mario Bros. business. Older fans will likely recognize the catchy jingle as the theme song of the 1989 Super Mario Brothers Super Show, which is a nice homage. 


The website also features humorous testimonials, job opportunities, and even a working phone number. Calling this number (929-55-MARIO) plays a recorded message by the Charlie Day-voiced Luigi, which provides a nice sample of his performance as the green-glad sidekick. Texting the number returns a message, which, depending on when you sent it, may return a digital poster for the movie. GI editor Kyle Hilliard got this Toad poster when he texted the number yesterday:
In my case, I only got a message thanking me for my interest in Super Mario Bros. Plumbing with a link to a form submission on the website. I&#x27;m not sure what you get for submitting this form, but feel free to find out yourselves. 
The Super Mario Bros. Movie premieres in theaters on April 7. You can check out the official movie poster here. Watch the latest trailer featuring Donkey Kong and Cat Suit Mario here.</span>

                              <span>Dead Island 2 has been in development hell for years, and the fans eagerly awaiting its launch now have one less week to do so. Dambuster Studios has announced it’s bumping the game’s release from April 28 to April 21.
The news came in an announcement tweet declaring the game has gone gold, meaning it&#x27;s essentially complete and ready to be printed on discs. Dead Island 2 had previously been scheduled to launch on February 3 before it was delayed to April 28. Speaking of April 28, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor was recently pushed to that same day. It wouldn&#x27;t be surprising if Dambuster moved its launch forward to steer clear of Star Wars&#x27; blast radius. 
You asked for it, you got it. Dead Island 2 went gold and it&#x27;s coming out a week early.

But today, the game’s official Twitter announced the zombie slasher had gone gold and would be arriving a week early on April 21st, breaking the decade-long tradition of delay-related news.

                              <span>Amazon is having one of its semi-regular Warehouse promotions in the UK, where you can get a host of PC peripherals (and other stuff) at an additional 30% off the listed price. This makes it a good opportunity to pick up (often barely) used gear, like headsets, external drives, mice and keyboards, especially higher-end stuff that would otherwise be out of reach.

                              <span>I&#x27;m such a sucker for cartoony animation in games. I’ll play anything that looks like it’s been lovingly hand-drawn and bonus points if the animation is deece. Later Alligator is one such game I picked up for that very reason as the goofy gators in the game’s trailer and screenshots initially caught my attention. The animation is great for sure, but one thing I was not expecting is how funny and utterly charming this point-and-click adventure is.

                              <span>Too many spells in games are just variations on the old reliable fireball. Wizard sends projectile towards target. Target dies. Perhaps they deviate a little in how quickly they die, or how large the area of effect is. Maybe instead of a fireball it&#x27;s a thunderbolt, or a poisonous gas, or a beam of light. Pish, I say. Pish! Where&#x27;s the real magic? Where are the cataclysmic spells that take days or weeks of preparation, and then change the world with a single fateful ritual?
These games could learn something from The Last Spell, a roguelite turn-based tactics game about defending your village each night from hordes of mutant beasts that emerge from the purple fog surrounding the entire world. Whenever I start a new game in The Last Spell, I always rewatch the excellent opening sequence, which succinctly sets a harrowing scene of magic pushed further than we&#x27;re used to seeing in most fiction in general, let alone games.

Blizzard had already announced that this battle pass would have in-game currency for the first time, allowing players to buy their choice of cosmetics, rather than just the passes’ selection of skins and souvenirs. But fans on Reddit have accused Blizzard of deliberately misleading players with these rewards.

The bundle is a collection of 69 games, music, zines, and other creative oddities of the magical variety. Everything has been made by LGBTQ+ creators and all the proceeds will be split between the featured teams. So far, the bundle has passed a whopping $90,000 (or £74,000) in sales, with over a week left to go.

                              <span>Have you ever planned to do a bunch of personally improving stuff on a Sunday morning like go for a walk down to the old pier or read 30 pages of an extremely political sci-fi book about aliens made of wool, but what you do instead is sit on the sofa playing an aggressively monetised mobile game while repeats of Modern Family run on the TV? For six hours, you do this, and eat your dinner feeling sick with unrealised potential.
Match-3 games are compulsive for a reason, and I don&#x27;t have beef with them as a concept. I actually like them! But I don&#x27;t like that to play a match-3 game I usually have to play a mobile game that wants me to spent money on Fairy Dollars so I can buy barrels of Explosive Wand Dust, making it easier to earn stars and incrementally furnish the Magic Toilet Goblin&#x27;s bedroom, or whatever. It&#x27;s the empty consumerism vibe of freemium mobile games that makes me feel like I&#x27;ve been eating the time-spending equivalent of junk food. Spirit Swap, which has a demo out now in the form of an endless mode, isn&#x27;t that. It&#x27;s beautiful, difficult, customiseable, and it&#x27;ll swallow you time in a good way, not a faintly unsettling one.

                              <span>When I say that Blood Bowl used to be a dead game, Cyanide’s Gautier Brésard is quick to correct me: “I would say that it was a community-managed game.” In fact, for the two decades that the tabletop Warhammer bloodsport was out of print, fans worked diligently to ensure it wasn’t out of mind - creating a ‘living rulebook’ that ran to six iterations.
“Here is what may be the final edition of Blood Bowl,” read the opening page of that community manual. “This is the rulebook designed to send Blood Bowl into a perpetual format. The Games Workshop is no longer interested in providing true support for this game.”

                              <span>Last July, Gabrielle Zevin&#x27;s Tomorrow, And Tomorrow, And Tomorrow came out, a novel set in and around the games industry. The book follows three aspiring game developers from their time as kids to their careers in the industry, in part detailing the games they make along the way, and found itself on several best seller lists on its release. Over the weekend, veteran game dev Brenda Romero called out the novel for excluding her from the acknowledgments, despite the similarity, confirmed by the author elsewhere, between Romero’s board game Train and an in-book video game Solution.

The criminal prosecution caused disruption but didn&#x27;t bring the site completely to its knees. Z-Library continued to operate on the dark web and this weekend, reappeared on the clearnet, offering a &#x27;unique&#x27; domain name to all users.

At 159 pages it&#x27;s a big read, but in the spirit of showman P.T. Barnum, it has something for everyone. Almost 90% of the most dedicated Aussie consumers obtain content strictly legally, but it can also be argued that 40% of the population are pirates.

I can&#x27;t get enough of watching funny, smart, creative people work, and Double Fine Adventure offered a one-of-a-kind, candid and thorough glimpse of game development.

This week I walked through woods shining with snowbells, and my heart soared. And oh, when I saw that crocuses are out in the local park too? Absolute joy. The greatest of thanks to the park gardeners who plant those so we know that spring is coming, please, hold on just a little longer, enjoy these flowers and know that spring is coming. But what are you playing this weekend? Here&#x27;s what we&#x27;re clicking on!

Instead, two PrimeStreams-related lawsuits worth tens of millions in damages were quietly settled this week, despite what appeared to be a mountain of evidence. So what went wrong?

                              <span>2 Player Productions, the film crew behind the acclaimed Double Fine Adventure! series chronicling the making of Double Fine Productions’ Broken Age, has suddenly released a new documentary series following the development of Psychonauts 2. Best of all, you can watch every episode right now. 
The series, called PsychOdyssey, consists of a whopping 32 episodes, all of which are available to watch for free on Double Fine’s YouTube channel. Double Fine Adventure! earned praise for its raw, intimate look at the good, bad, and ugly sides of game development as the crew spent years filming in Double Fine&#x27;s studio as Broken Age came together. Psychonauts 2&#x27;s tumultous road to release, from crowdfunding campaigns to Microsoft&#x27;s acquistion of Double Fine, makes its creation a fascinating subject, and we&#x27;re excited to see how 2 Player Productions captured it.

Capturing the essence of an established fiction is tricky business, especially when translating into a new medium. It’s a big reason licensed games frequently miss the mark, sometimes failing to find the tone and nuance that made the original version shine. Avalanche Software navigates those challenges with a deft eye and an evident appreciation for the source books and films. Hogwarts Legacy…</span>

The reveal of Pacific Drive last year immediately grabbed me. I liked what I saw in the initial trailer, sure, but what I found especially intriguing was that most of the game happens through a first-person view of someone driving an old station wagon through a beautiful but distraught Pacific Northwest forest. Rarely do driving games force a first-person view, and even fewer deviate from being a racer. 
Pacific Drive does both, and after viewing roughly 30 minutes of gameplay during a virtual preview, I’m even more intrigued. In a way, Pacific Drive is a racing game, but you’re not racing against other players – you’re racing against a biome ravaged by a mysterious sci-fi force that controls anomalies set on…</span>

For each issue, we ask our community a question for our SoundOff section. This time around, we want to know...
&quot;Which developer do you always trust to deliver a great game and why?&quot;
You can answer this question and/or include any other feedback/questions you want. Thank you again for your support throughout the years, and we hope many of you get the chance to have your letter printed in an upcoming issue!

                              <span>The makers of Warhammer 40,000: Darktide have laid out their plans to improve the co-op shooter&#x27;s shopping and crafting systems. The gear system changes, due to arrive in the next patch, do sound like improvements to the current state of things. These plans do not sound better than entirely ending the tedious grinds of random rolls and making numbers bigger. Why improve when it would be better to remove?

                              <span>For three hours, Re:Call was high on my list of surprise recent indie hits. It has a great premise, for starters - change history by meddling with your memories and playing out different versions of events to arrive at the &#x27;correct&#x27; solution - and executes it brilliantly. Its GBA-style visuals and larger-than-life character portraits give it a real sense of charm and personality, and its mystery story of murder and corporate conspiracy had hooked me in real good. 
Then it abandoned its cool premise halfway through and became a different game entirely for its remaining run-time. I was heartbroken.

                              <span>Maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;ve been bouncing between a lot of weighty games lately, but I&#x27;ve found a great diversion in The True Slime King, a simple three button platformer that recently left early access.

Speaking pedantically, this isn&#x27;t &quot;as simple as it gets&quot;, but you&#x27;ll get what I mean if I describe it that way anyway. You move and jump, dodging spikes and lasers and ISO 13370 compliant death pits, and ideally collecting all the hard to reach thingies along the way. These are far from my favourite genre, but I&#x27;ve played enough to realise I&#x27;m partial to a good one, and this is a great one.

                              <span>The Division 2 has enjoyed a long life since its 2019 release, but it seems like the looter shooter has finally tripped. Just last week, Ubisoft delayed the game’s imminent Season 11 launch due to localisation issues that had been “impacting the experience for many players.” But in the process of fixing that issue, Ubisoft had accidentally “brought down the build generation system,” meaning that no updates were possible until the system was rebuilt. At least they’re being honest.

                              <span>I imagine Industries Of Titan started out as an ambitious concept. A hybrid of a factory layout/logistics sim, integrated into a city builder, combined with an RTS, all wrapped up in a satirical dystopia encouraging you to be the most appalling villainous hypercapitalist possible.
All of those parts are present, and as a bonus it&#x27;s incredibly gorgeous, with strong voice acting and a distinctive soundtrack that will haunt my head for weeks. Most of its parts are made to a high standard, it&#x27;s tragic that its final design just doesn&#x27;t work at all.
Of all things, IOT reminds me of Fragile Allegiance. You&#x27;re a &#x27;founder&#x27;, sent to an already colonised and abandoned Titan to build a new city at the behest of the Council. You&#x27;re a &#x27;founder&#x27;, sent to an already colonised and abandoned Titan to build a new city at the behest of the Council. First, by salvaging its ruined buildings for minerals and isotopes, then mining for surface deposits, all of which goes back into your building resources. Curiously, you never combine two resources to produce a third, you can only upgrade minerals through a tier system. Higher tier resources are more potent, meaning, for exmaple, a building site will accept 100 raw minerals or four higher tier units. It’s a bit strange, but it mostly works. Double clicking on your starting buildings summons an interior view, where you lay out machinery, little modules for workers and storage, power pylons and so on.

Pre-registration has now closed, but you might be able to gain access through the game’s FAQ page. While HoYoverse haven’t announced a release date for their cosmic fantasy adventure, eagle-eyed fans have spotted a potential April date on the IOS App Store.

                              <span>Vampiric survival game V Rising continues its early access with a free expansion coming in May. It&#x27;s meaty, overhauling a few areas of the game including magic progression, spellcasting, and lair building in preparation for the endgame. But it’s also “giving you more of what you already love” with new weapons and spells, boss battles, areas, and factions. Quite a lot to sink your teeth into, then.

                              <span>Start at the beginning, right? When faced with a self-imposed task as massive and daunting as writing a retrospective on The Sims franchise, going back to the very first game was the obvious launchpad. The original The Sims — now sometimes called The Sims 1 for the sake of clarity — was released in February 2000, and received regular updates via expansion packs through to October 2003. The game was the brainchild of Will Wright, the designer behind the SimCity series, who had decided to approach the world of his popular city-building franchise from a new angle. Switching from macro- to micro-management, Wright&#x27;s new spin-off project aimed to focus on the architectural design of individual houses. As time went on, his creative interests would shift again, to also take in the lives of the people inside the buildings.

                              <span>Recent multiplayer games seem to shut down almost weekly, but 16 years after release, good ole’ Team Fortress 2 is still chugging along with a new “full-on update-sized update” coming this summer. Valve’s hero shooter has been in maintenance mode for a few years, only receiving seasonal updates and patches to fix exploits and fight bots. So, judging by Valve’s “bleeding-edge communication” blog post, this will be the game’s first major content update in years.

There&#x27;s your chill little potion brewers that let you coo over a bubbling cauldron all nice and cosy like; there&#x27;s your darker, more supernatural witchy adventures that dig into the spookier side of the fae realm, and then you&#x27;ve got your lovely genre mash-ups that add spicy, magical seasoning to well-worn action tropes, like the excellent bullet-hell Metroid-like The Knight Witch I wrote about the other day. But if I thought that was pushing against my limits of gamepad dexterity, Contingent99&#x27;s 2018 roguelike Wizard Of Legend is on another level entirely.

                              <span>Katharine and I were lamenting earlier today that Square Enix seem inconsistent when it comes to releasing demos of their games on Steam. Forspoken&#x27;s demo only came to PC months after its console release, and Harvestella&#x27;s demo remains exclusive to Switch. Likewise, the Octopath Traveler 2 demo which was released on console yesterday was nowhere to be found on PC.

Uh, until today. It&#x27;s out on Steam now.

It retailed at $100, half the price of the ultra-premium Nari Ultimate, but today it&#x27;s significantly cheaper at Best Buy. You&#x27;ll pay just $35 for it now, a $65 discount and a great deal for an older but still great-sound wireless headset.

                              <span>Kingston&#x27;s 1TB DataTraveler Max USB-C flash drive is an unusual beastie, matching NVMe-SSD-grade speeds with a slim, portable flash drive form factor. This drive is capable of reads up to 1000MB/s, putting it alongside some of the best external SSDs, and it&#x27;s currently discounted at B&amp;H Photo Video to $80 for a 1TB size - not bad! 
Unfortunately this deal is only live for the next six hours, so I hope that you see this post in time!

                              <span>The Etrian Odyssey series is a huge blindspot for me, and I imagine many others. They&#x27;re a series of dungeon crawling JRPGs in which you pilot a party of adventures through first-person, grid-based mazes and turn-based battles.

GitHub warns that the lower court&#x27;s decision threatens to criminalize the work of many other developers. The EFF, meanwhile, stresses that an incorrect interpretation of the DMCA harms people who use stream-rippers lawfully.

                              <span>In this week&#x27;s episode of The Game Informer Show, the crew excitedly outlines a few big reveals from yesterday&#x27;s Nintendo Direct, including flying machines in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and a collection of Game Boy games being released on Nintendo Switch yesterday alongside a surprise launch of Metroid Prime Remastered. Following news of a canceled single-player Titanfall game set in its shared universe with Apex Legends, the guys speculate about what happened to the project and share their ideas for what the game could&#x27;ve looked like. 
During The Playlist, we discuss the first hour of Octopath Traveller II, Goldeneye 007, Metroid Prime Remastered, and The Legend of Zelda: Minish Cap.

                              <span>Nintendo surprised the world by finally shadow dropping the long-rumored remaster of Metroid Prime yesterday, so Kyle Hilliard and Marcus Stewart loaded it up to take a look at its various improvements and gush over the game which holds up incredibly well. Turns out Metroid Prime is still great and only improved by the visual upgrade and modernized contols.

                              <span>Nintendo has been slowly beefing up its library of games available to Nintendo Switch Online and Expansion Pack subscribers. 
What began as a library of just 20 NES games has grown to include dozens more. Plus, Nintendo has since introduced SNES, Nintendo 64, Game Boy, and even Sega Genesis games, giving players a chance to play some fan-favorite classics and some deep cuts, too. It’s hard to predict when new games might arrive as the company has maintained a somewhat inconsistent cadence in doing so, but that’s okay because this list is all you need. 
As Nintendo adds new titles, we’ll be sure to update this list to include them. If you’re looking for something specific, use this story’s Table of Contents to jump to the different consoles quickly. Here’s every NES, SNES, Game Boy, N64, Ge…</span>

                              <span>Nintendo has responded to our inquiries with the following comments.
On the reasoning for the $69.99 price tag for The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom:
On if this is the trend for Nintendo titles going forward:
Original Story (Published at 5:49 pm Central on February 8, 2023)
The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom could very well be the most anticipated game of 2023 and is certainly one of the most exciting releases in the history of the Nintendo Switch. During today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct, we got a new look at gameplay, plus the announcement of the Collector&#x27;s Edition and a new Amiibo figure starring Link. However, we also got some unfortunate news surrounding the upcoming launch of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.
In its press release for the Nintendo Direct, Nintendo announced that the upcoming Zelda entry will retail for $69.99. This makes Nintendo the latest major publish to test the waters of raising the price of its triple-A titles in recent years. This follows other major publishers like 2K Games and PlayStation, who started pricing their major releases at $70 with the start of the new console generation in 2020. Last year, both Xbox and Ubisoft announced that their triple-A games would cost $70 going forward.
We reached out to Nintendo for comment regarding the reasoning for the price increase and if this will be the trend for its triple-A releases going forward, but did not immediately receive a response. We will update this story if Nintendo provides a statement.
The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom launches on Switch on May 12.</span>

By now, Nintendo has brought a large chunk of its most popular and successful games of all time to Switch. Whether you&#x27;re talking the enhanced ports like Super Mario 3D World + Bowser&#x27;s Fury and The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD or the collection of emulated classics available through the Nintendo Switch Online subscription tiers, the Switch has rightfully earned its reputation as a place where you can experience both the newest titles from Nintendo, as well as many of its greatest hits. The latest title to time travel to Nintendo&#x27;s modern juggernaut system is Kirby&#x27;s Return to Dream La…</span>

                              <span>Professor Layton is making a comeback in a new adventure for Switch. Called Professor Layton and the New World of Steam, the next chapter in his saga will arrive at a yet-to-be-specified date.
A brief teaser trailer shows the professor trotting through an industrial backdrop. We don&#x27;t know what mystery he&#x27;ll unravel or which allies will lend a hand, but it&#x27;s nice to see the good gentleman back. 


Professor Layton&#x27;s last title to star him was 2014&#x27;s The Azaran Legacy. In 2017, a spin-off starring Layton&#x27;s daughter called Layton&#x27;s Mystery Journey: Katrielle and the Millionaires&#x27; Conspiracy was released for 3DS and was ported to Switch in 2019.</span>

Party Central will feature 40 songs &quot;from across the world’s most popular music genres.&quot; Players use the Nintendo Switch&#x27;s Joy-Con controllers in rhythm with the beat. The game will also have local and online competitive multiplayer and party modes. 
You can check out the reveal trailer below:


Samba de Amigo: Party Central is actually a sequel to the first Samba de Amigo, developed by Sonic Team and first released on the Sega Dreamcast in 1999. It&#x27;s since been ported to the Wii (though it wasn&#x27;t very good) and had a long life in arcades.</span>

While you can read all about that right here, we also got some news surrounding some additional ways fans can celebrate the launch of the follow-up to 2017&#x27;s Breath of the Wild.
First up, Nintendo revealed The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Collector&#x27;s Edition. This bundle features the physical version of the game, an artbook with concept art, a steelbook case, an Iconart steel poster, and a set of four pin badges. This Collector&#x27;s Edition will launch alongside The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and retails for $130.

Additionally, we learned about a new Amiibo figure coming out alongside Tears of the Kingdom. This Amiibo features Link and will grant access to materials and weapons when you scan it with Tears of the Kingdom. Players will also get a special fabric for Link&#x27;s paraglider.
The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom arrives for Switch on May 12.</span>

Still going by her birth name of Cereza, our hero is still a witch-in-training so she won&#x27;t be executing flash combos or summoning a litany of demons. Instead, Bayonetta Origins plays more like an adventure game. Along the way, she&#x27;ll befriend the demon Cheshire who handles all of the fighting. Cerezea lends a hand by magically binding enemies in place using her magic. Outside of combat, the pair combine their powers to overcome platforming obstacles. 


Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon comes to Switch on March 17.</span>

                              <span>Today during the most recent Nintendo Direct live stream, the company gave a new look at The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.  
You&#x27;re going to immediately jump past this paragraph to the trailer below, so here are the quick bits you need to know: there&#x27;s rail grinding akin to Sonic and Splatoon, a new homing arrow, a big, dumb goofy car Link can drive and a new hoverboard, and all around the game continues to look great. 
Here&#x27;s the trailer:


While we&#x27;re at it, here&#x27;s a whole host of new screenshots. 

Tears of the Kingdom will be released on May 12, 2023.</span>

                              <span>DNS-resolver Quad9 continues to fight back against Sony Music&#x27;s demands for pirate site blocking measures to be deployed at the DNS level. The non-profit foundation argues that blocking injunctions shouldn&#x27;t apply to DNS resolvers as that would create a chilling effect on the free and open Internet. Quad9&#x27;s defense is supported by an expert report from  Prof. Dr. Ruth Janal.

Michael Barone worked at Carrasquillo&#x27;s pirate IPTV service Gears TV, initially in a customer service role and later as an administrator. Compared to Carrasquillo, Barone played a relatively minor role, but was still important to the platform&#x27;s operations.

                              <span>The Adata XPG SX8200 Pro was one of the best value NVMe SSDs when it launched in 2019 - and indeed, we have the RPS review from erstwhile hardware editor Katharine to prove it. Nowadays, PCIe 4.0 drives are becoming more common and PCIe 5.0 is on the horizon, but the SX8200 Pro - in a newer 2TB size - is still an awesome value for the performance on offer. It&#x27;s down to £117 at TechNextDay when you use code TND-10, a healthy £35 below the next-lowest price at CCL.

                              <span>Intel&#x27;s Arc graphics cards debuted to surprisingly warm reviews late last year, including over at Digital Foundry where I endorsed them as a &quot;pleasant surprise&quot; that were &quot;already cards worth buying&quot; thanks to better-than-expected performance in modern titles. Six months of patches and performance improvements later, and these GPUs look even better - especially as neither AMD or Nvidia has launched mainstream desktop graphics cards from their most recent generation. 
 Today, the cheaper of the two cards, the Arc A750, is available for £250 plus shipping at Overclockers UK, a steep £80 reduction from their £330 launch price.

Not so, it turns out. The target specs have been released today and they&#x27;re relatively modest at both the low and high end.

It was confirmed last night during the surprisingly PC-relevant Nintendo Direct. A remaster will come to Steam this summer.

                              <span>Although the demo is relatively short, I’ve really been getting into the roguelike deckbuilding of Dungeon Drafters. I like the colourful pixel art, the classic fantasy enemy archetypes, how spell cards feel super punchy when activated, and I love love love the magical, fluffy wizard rabbit. 
Called The Explorer, this rabbit is not only super cute - his little brown booties are adorable, as is his helmet which has holes so his massive fluffy ears can poke through - but a bonafide badass in magic casting. This rabbit can majorly throw down.

                              <span>It’s been almost 30 years since the management RTS The Settlers was first released. The series is still going strong at Ubisoft, but its original creator Volker Wertich is returning to the genre with Pioneers Of Pagonia, a similar city-building sim. The game is currently in development at indie studio Envision Entertainment and it’ll be entering early access on Steam by the end of this year.

                              <span>What a week its been! Not a great one if you like zany battle royales, as it turns out. This week on the Electronic Wireless Show podcast we discuss the recent sunetting of Rumbleverse and Knockout City, and how long is a good run for games anyway? But in happier and more ridiculous news, we also get to talk about how massively popular Dwarf Fortress&#x27;s steam release has been. Good ol&#x27; Dwarf Fortress. Plus: the Dreadwolf is leeeeeaaakiiiiing.
Nate&#x27;s mini-game this week is offering us both dark bargains (I think I did pretty well out of mine), and in a Good Day To Ware Hard James explains why the graphics card market is broken, with a cowboy metaphor. This is a thing now.

                              <span>A lot (most) of the magic games we&#x27;re highlighting this week are in some manner lovely and nice, because witches these days tend towards the cottagecore (ily, Little Witch In The Woods!). It&#x27;s nice that witches have changed in our minds to &quot;unmarried lady who lives alone and is good with herbs and cats :]&quot;, when they used to be &quot;unmarried lady who lives alone and is good with herbs and her cat is the devil and she has sex with the devil&quot;.
There&#x27;s still room for witches with some threat to &#x27;em, though, and I love a weird horror game, so you can imagine that when I heard about The Salt Order my interest was immediately piqued. It&#x27;s a low-poly PS1-style game where an order of witches has tasked you with retrieving a grimoire from a cursed realm of endless trees. You are largely defenceless, except for the ability to draw on the ground with salt. &quot;In many stories that I knew as a child, salt was one of the very powerful magical protective elements against evil spirits,&quot; solo dev Khamelot tells me over email. &quot;During invocations, drawing a circle of salt could act as a basic protection. To prevent the spirits from entering one&#x27;s home, you could put salt in front of the openings of the house.&quot;

                              <span>We’ve all been busy here at RPS picking out our favourite demos in this spring’s Steam Next Fest. Looking at both the popular upcoming demo list and the most wishlisted list, survival crafting game Voidtrain sits comfortably in second place on both. I decided to download the demo and see what the fuss was about, and wow, is Voidtrain completely wild.
I thought Voidtrain might be relatively new, but it&#x27;s actually been knocking around for a couple of years. It’s been in early access on the Epic Games Store since 2021, and after announcing a Steam release for October 2022, the game got indefinitely delayed. Voidtrain&#x27;s Steam page currently has a vague release date of sometime in 2023, but the demo is a good reason enough to check it out while the team is still tightening some loose screws.

                              <span>Nintendo has been very robust in its support of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, regularly bringing out new content for enthusiastic racers over the last year to keep the experience fresh. That trend continues with the upcoming Booster Course Pass Wave 4, which is targeting a release later this spring.
While we don’t have all the details, today’s Nintendo Direct gave us a look at the new course set on Yoshi’s Island, which looks just as whimsical and fun as that locale ever has. We also learned that Birdo is joining the roster of available racers – the one-time Mario foe first appeared in a Mario Kart game with Double Dash, and so this appearance is a return to the road.
Subscribers to the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack service are able to access the new Booster Course Pass Wave 4 for no additional cost, but the pass is also available for separate purchase.</span>

                              <span>Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp will be released on April 21, as announced today during the most recent Nintendo Direct live stream. 
Re-Boot Camp has had an uphill battle hitting any release date. Originally announced for a release on December 3, 2021, in October of that year, it was pushed to spring 2022. And then, well, that didn&#x27;t happen. In March 2022, Nintendo announced an indefinite delay &quot;in light of recent world events,&quot; perhaps referencing the war in Ukraine, which had just broken out at that time. 
Check out a trailer below.


Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp is a remake of the Game Boy Advance games Advance Wars and Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising. It&#x27;s being developed by WayForward, known for its work on the Shantae series.</span>

                              <span>Today’s Nintendo Direct gave us a new look at Sabotage Studio’s Sea of Stars. This follow-up game to The Messenger is set in the same universe, but set many years prior to the team’s first game, and with an entirely different style and genre, recalling the early era of console RPGs, represented by games like Final Fantasy VI. 
Sea of Stars features some stunning pixel art visuals, and also boasts guest musical compositions from Yasunori Mitsuda, whose music enhanced such games as Chrono Trigger, Chrono Cross, and Xenoblade Chronicles 3.
The new trailer helps to show off the wide variety of locales players visit in the game, along with some intriguing turn-based battles.
Sea of Stars increasingly looks like a major treat for anyone who has fond recollections of that golden age of early console RPGs.
The game is headed to Switch on August 29, and a free demo is available later today on the Nintendo eShop.
Check out the new trailer below.</span>

The trailer for the remaster showed off the improved visuals and also noted that the game will be playable with the modern, dual control stick first-person controls. If, however, you would like to play it as originally intended, that will be an option. Nintendo is promising additional control options, as well.
The trailer also reminded that the game takes place on Talon IV, and focuses on using various visors to make progress.</span>

The news comes by way of today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct. The cult favorite mystery game has been remastered in HD, and presumably, the gameplay has been reworked, given it was developed for the dual-screened DS. The Capcom-developed adventure game follows Sissel, who passes away under mysterious circumstances. It&#x27;s up to his ghost to figure out how he died by way of solving puzzles.

                              <span>Nintendo leveraged today’s Nintendo Direct as a chance to provide a new glimpse at Pikmin 4. Like in the original game, we see a human-like lead character crash-landing on a mysterious planet in the trailer, but there’s plenty of new twists to keep things fresh.
We see a variety of Pikmin with different abilities, including Ice Pikmin that help to freeze enemies and targets. There’s also a cute dog-like creature that seems to ally with the player to smash through barriers, act as a mount, and other as-yet unrevealed capabilities.
Nintendo also appeared to reveal a release date for Pikmin 4, flashing up the date of July 21, 2023. It’s a good bet that players will be able to have those tiny sentient plant followers trailing behind them on that date when the game arrives on Switch.</span>

It will allow players to hang out in Inkopolis from the original Splatoon game, and even meet and interact with characters from the original game, like the Squid Sisters, who will perform during Splat Fests.
No date or details were offered for the second wave, but it showed a Squid Kid in what appeared to be a snow-covered city. It also seems to have a more melancholy, sad tone. The second wave will be called Side Dish.


The Splatoon 3 expansion pass will be available to pre-purchase today.</span>

Those were the words of Capcom&#x27;s Yasuhiro Ampo, the main director of the Resident Evil 4 remake. Alongside fellow director Kazunori Kadoi, their team has taken on the lofty task of reinventing the 2005 classic for a modern audience, recapturing the game&#x27;s magic while also expanding it with new features. During our cover story interview with the two designers, they spoke candidly about the early phases of the game&#x27;s development, their initial hesitation to tackle such an intimidating project, and how the team&#x27;s approach in identifying areas for improvement gave them the confidence to see the project through. 
Ampo and Kadoi have plenty of experience working on Resident Evil. Their combined credits span the original 1996 game to titles such as Res…</span>

                              <span>Ever since the first bundle arrived in 2014, The Jackbox Party Pack has been a staple in many households when friends and family come over. The zany, creative, and often-irreverent games have proven to be crowd-pleasers over the last decade of annual iterations, with Jackbox Party Pack 9 releasing last October. Today, Jackbox Games announced a tenth edition of its party-game bundle, The Jackbox Party Pack 10, which will arrive this fall.
Like its predecessors, The Jackbox Party Pack 10 promises five games that offer players the ability to be creative, funny, and intelligent, often in an effort to earn the approval of their competitors and/or spectators. While we don&#x27;t know what games will be included in The Jackbox Party Pack 10, Jackbox games will announce and detail the included titles in the coming months. The included games will be playable in English, Spanish, French, German, and Italian.
On top of that, Jackbox Games will highlight one previous Party Pack per month in the lead-up to the launch of 10. These celebrations will include behind-the-scene glimpses, special livestreams with the development team, and discounts in the official Jackbox Games shop.
The Jackbox Party Pack 10 arrives on all major platforms this fall.</span>

                              <span>Forspoken players still exploring Athia or those hoping to jump in the future should be happy to know that developer Luminous Productions has announced an impending patch to make the adventure smoother across the board. 
In a statement by game director Takeshi Aramaki, the update will improve Forspoken’s graphics, performance, and playability while also adding “general updates” and fixes to both the PS5 and PC versions. There&#x27;s no release date for the patch, nor does the message elaborate on the specifics of these improvements. 
“We are committed to making Forspoken the most enjoyable experience possible, and will provide an update about the timing of the next patch as soon as possible,” says Aramaki in the statement, which you can read in full below (click the image to enlarge). 
Forspoken earned a 7.5 out of 10 review score from Game Informer, with editor Kyle Hilliard writing, “Forspoken&#x27;s story and combat fail to reach the heights of its movement and exploration, but thankfully those two latter elements make up most of the experience. I sprinted, often literally, through the campaign in about 15 hours, and now I have a large world filled with nooks and crannies I&#x27;m eager to run through and explore. The narrative won’t linger with me, and I avoided combat in the open world often, but I loved making Frey leap and fly through Athia to discover all its treasure chests and secrets.” Check out our full review here.</span>

                              <span>To many, Cities: Skylines is the premier city-building simulation. When the PC launched in 2015, it quickly became a fan-favorite release for those who felt let down by modern SimCity titles. When the sim title arrived on consoles two years later, the less-intuitive controls didn&#x27;t detract too much from the experience, enabling it to still deliver a terrific city-building experience. Now, developer Colossal Order and publisher Paradox Interview have announced Cities: Skylines Remastered, which improves the experience for console players in myriad ways.
This new version of Cities: Skylines aims to let players create bigger and better metropolises than ever before. In addition to the obvious graphical and performance upgrades enabled by the newer hardware, players can take their city-planning skills to the next level with up to 25 buildable tiles instead the 9 on PS4 and Xbox One versions. Additionally, players can look forward to a quick-selection tool, user-experience improvements like precision placements and updated snapping options, a new environmental control panel, a map editor, and the ability to place structures freely.
Perhaps most importantly, anyone who owns the PlayStation 4 or Xbox One version and its DLC will receive Cities: Skylines Remastered and DLC (up to the Airports expansion) for free on their respective console family. Those who don&#x27;t already own the last-gen console version can grab Cities: Skylines Remastered for $40.
You can see a very brief teaser rattling off some of the improvements the team made for this new version below.


Cities: Skylines Remastered arrives on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on February 15. The remastered versions of the DLC will become available in the coming months. For more on Cities: Skylines, read our 2015 review of the PC version here and the 2017 console version here. You can also read our 2021 interview with the CEO of Colossal Order on the enduring success of Cities: Skylines here.</span>

Deliver Us Mars follows in the footsteps of hidden gem Deliver Us The Moon, a game with enjoyable puzzle-solving and storytelling that mostly overcame its technical and presentational shortcomings. The same is nearly true of this sequel set on the Red Planet, though its larger scope magnifies its problems. Thankfully, a captivating narrative does its best to keep this flawed mission on track.

Tune in at 2 p.m. PST tomorrow, Feb. 8, for a #NintendoDirect livestream featuring roughly 40 minutes of information mostly focused on #NintendoSwitch games launching in the first half of 2023.

The event runs for around 40 minutes and will highlight Switch games launching in the first half of 2023. In terms of notable first and third-party exclusives that we already know about, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon fall under that range. It’s plausible we’ll also see one last push for indies coming to Switch soon, such as Have a Nice Death, Ib, and Storyteller. 
Given that this is Nintendo, it&#x27;s always possible they&#x27;ll announce a big game out of nowhere that winds up launching soon after its reveal. What do you expect/hope to see in tomorrow&#x27;s Direct? Let us know in the comments.</span>

                              <span>Breaking news: OpenTTD 13.0 is now available! Depending on your perspective, we’re either two months early for our usual April 1st release, or a bit tardy for the Christmas 2022 release we intended. We think the wait has been worth it. This is one of the largest releases we’ve done in several years, with numerous features and improvements covering the user interface, gameplay features, and modding extensions for NewGRF and Game Script creators. Some of the highlights are: Variable interface scaling at whatever size you want (not just 2x and 4x), with optional chunky bevels for that retro feel. This includes better automatic scaling when using HiDPI or mixed DPI setups. Direct access to NewGRF/AI/GS settings from the new game window. Various small tweaks and improvements to several windows. NewGRFs can now provide engine variants that are shown hierarchically in the purchase list. Multi-track level crossings to keep road vehicles from stopping in the middle of the crossing. Custom league tables for GameScripts. More natural rivers which get wider as they flow downstream. And much more, which can be seen in the changelog or the previous release announcements! In addition to these features and improvements, we’ve fixed lots of bugs. (If you played with the RC2 testing release, most were fixed before then. See the changelog for full details.)

                              <span>A few months have passed since we released ScummVM 2.6.1. It&#x27;s time to prepare for a new release!
Our lovely developers added support, yet again, for a bunch of new ancient games that require testing:
Soldier Boyz
GLK Scott Adams Interactive Fiction games (C64 and ZX Spectrum)
GLK Scott Adams adventures 1-12 (TI99/4A format)
Obsidian
Pink Panther: Passport to Peril
Pink Panther: Hokus Pokus Pink
Driller/Space Station Oblivion
Halls of the Dead: Faery Tale Adventure II
Besides these games, we’d appreciate it if you could check our release testing list. Maybe you’ll even find your favorite game on there that has been sitting on that shelf for way too long - otherwise, there are some demos of these games available on our website.
And since ScummVM is about playing games in general, we’ve seen notable changes across many, many engines - so this is the perfect time for giving your favorites another go.
As usual, we are not just adding support for new games. We are constantly working on improving the engines we already support and, in particular, we’ve seen some incredible work being done on the SCUMM engine. Yes, there are the usual bug fixes, but this time we are also adding a feature that helps playing the SCUMM games in a truly original fashion: Support for the original loading and saving dialogs within the GUI!
Speaking of truly original: Remember those old CRT displays we had back in the day? With ScummVM 2.7.0 you’ll be able to replicate this experience on certain platforms thanks to our new shader-based scalers. Go ahead and give it a try!
All testing must be done with stable builds, not development ones. Please report any bugs or oddities on our issue tracker.
A detailed list of all exciting new features and fixes is available in our NEWS file.
Thank you very much for your support! Let’s make ScummVM 2.7.0 a great release - together!

                              <span>More Director games are ready for public testing!
ScummVM has made huge strides in Macromedia Director support. Many Director 3 games are now fully completable, and several Director 4 games are also now playable. 18 new games are officially supported, and we could use your help testing them. We also welcome reports of any other Director games which are fully playable or completable. To test these new games, please use the latest daily build of ScummVM. Any bugs or problems can be reported to the issue tracker.
Some highlights from the new list of games include:
Chop Suey by Theresa Duncan, an important classic of &quot;girl games&quot;.
Eastern Mind, the cult classic from artist Osamu Kato.
Ganbare! Inuchan, based on the comic by singer Kenso Kato, which was the first Director 4 game to be fully completable.
Over-Ring-Under, by the same developer as Alice: An Interactive Museum. ScummVM&#x27;s new support for CD audio in Director games lets players enjoy the soundtrack by Carl Stone.
The first five games by Japanese indie developer iTA-Choco Systems.
