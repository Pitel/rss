This is it, people. This is the year. The smoke and stench from refried rumours is overwhelming but soon it will clear to reveal... new Nintendo hardware.
No, not a grainy motherboard pic from a factory backroom or a render someone posted with &#x27;OMG the latest Switch 2 trailer is 🥹🥹🥹!!!!11&#x27; slapped on. No, not a secret-but-not-really Playtest or an alarm clock; a bonafide new Nintendo console with new Nintendo launch games!

With Sonic and co. currently making waves in the global box office with Sonic the Hedgehog 3, Samsung has revealed that it is launching a new set of &#x27;Pro Plus&#x27; MicroSD cards based on key characters from the franchise (thanks, Hot Hardware).
No release date has been set at the time of writing, but prospective customers can currently sign up for more information in addition to a cheeky 30% discount on the listed price.

Well folks, part of us had hoped that 2025 would mark the end of leaks and rumours regarding the upcoming &#x27;Switch 2&#x27;, but apparently not. Ahead of Nintendo&#x27;s expected announcement before the end of March, new images have appeared online that seem to reveal the successor&#x27;s motherboard.
Posted on Reddit by MHN1994 (who has since stated that they are not the original leaker and had actually found the images on Facebook), the post&#x27;s legitimacy is certainly up for debate (though many have rightly pointed out the comparisons to a previous leak showcasing alleged prototype components of the Switch 2), but the internet has gone wild with speculation on what this means for the upcoming console regardless.

The Lazy Bear Games and tinyBuild Switch eShop release Graveyard Keeper appears to be finally getting a physical release on Nintendo&#x27;s hybrid platform.
According to some new listings on sites like Amazon, the Stardew-style and graveyard management sim title will score a hard copy release in March 2025 with Atari seemingly handling the publishing. It also happens to be the &#x27;Undead Edition&#x27; including the &#x27;Breaking Dead&#x27;, &#x27;Game of Crone&#x27; and &#x27;Stranger Sins&#x27; DLC packs.

It&#x27;s being helmed by the original game&#x27;s director Hideki Kamiya (Devil May Cry, Bayonetta) and while he&#x27;s already shared a message, he&#x27;s now released another one as we enter 2025 - touching on the establishment of the new studio (Clovers) and sequel project.

The project is called &quot;Artemis&quot; (at least for now) and you won&#x27;t be seeing it any time soon. That&#x27;s because the studio is still working on the tech behind it all, and plans to release two other games before it. Meaning it&#x27;ll be 10-15 years before it actually comes out. 
Greene describes Artemis as an internet-like platform where users create and share things, but doesn&#x27;t say specifically what those things might be. He doesn&#x27;t know how his user-led &quot;multiverse of worlds&quot; will be moderated, or how it will prevent copyright infringement, or what makes this idea distinct from, say, Roblox. He is nonetheless &quot;full of confidence&quot;.

                              <span>It&#x27;s frightfully early in the year to be bustling, but I can&#x27;t get enough of the crowded streets of ancient &quot;Chinese-style&quot; RPG The Bustling World. The latest trailer is a series of sweeping yet intimate, colourful urban cross-sections, showing dozens of NPCs selling fish, shaking hands on balconies, shouldering barrels, dancing with fans, honing their feng shui, and various other pursuits that allegedly form part of full NPC life simulations. It&#x27;s like scrutinising a Hitman level from above, except that all of these people have evolving relationships and sleeping patterns and they might hunt you down if you murder any of their relatives. Me, I just want to play Where&#x27;s Wally.

Six times I’ve tried to pass your FPS test by killing three monsters to prove I’m human. Six times I’ve failed. For thousands of years, people have asked what it means to be human. It turns out it was never a philosophical issue after all. It was, I’m gutted to report, a skill issue all along.

                              <span>Ekphrasis is a concept from ancient Greece (who bloody loved a good concept) describing the act of creative writing inspired by a work of art. Is a Ryanair Boeing 737 safety manual art? Well, Johnson A Plane Man has done some ekphrasis with it, so I say yes. It’s a short browser Itch game that chronicles the life and times of a man named Johnson, his love for yellow life vests, his existential feelings of confinement (despite the high number of easily locatable exits), and such emancipatory joys that can only be found in yellow slides.

                              <span>Happy new year all! And what better way to kick off another undignified 12 month crawl toward the next Xmas holiday than with the news that one of my favourite dark fantasy storybook extravaganzas, Ghost Of A Tale, is getting a sequel.
The newness of this news is in question, admittedly. Developer Lionel &quot;Seith&quot; Gallat and his team have been working on another helping of haunted mouseketeering since 2022. But this is the first time they&#x27;ve properly blogged about it, sharing details of a gruelling switchover to Unreal Engine 5 and a couple of new screens. They still haven&#x27;t updated the title to make the obvious pun, but perhaps a title as pungent with whimsy as &quot;Ghost Of A Tail&quot; is beyond the trumpeted capabilities of Unreal Engine 5.

I still like ORAS Tabitha. 

Gen V is one of the best in the series.

I prefer GSC over HGSS.
Ultra Beasts were a bad idea. I&#x27;m not a fan of Gen VII in general.
And probably many more.</span>

                              <span>The Inverted Spear of Heaven is one of the more useful weapons you can yield in Jujutsu Infinite, but to do so, you&#x27;ll have to add it to your inventory first.


There are several ways to improve your character, such as equipping yourself with good gear that you can obtain from your grind. Some of them are good, and others not so, and the Inverted Spear of Heaven definitely falls among the first. It&#x27;s a Unique and versatile weapon that can be useful in both PvP and PvE, so let&#x27;s take a look at how to obtain it inside the game.


Best ways to obtain the Inverted Spear of Heaven in Jujutsu Infinite


Obtaining the Inverted Spear of Heaven is slightly more manageable in Jujutsu Infinite as it&#x27;s not a Special Grade tier item. Still, you&#x27;ll have to largely rely on your luck, but less so than you…</span>

                              <span>Not many hours are left for the NumeroFUT promo to go live in EA FC 25, and the first set of leaks have hinted at the special cards coming soon to Ultimate Team.


NumeroFUT will be a new addition to Ultimate Team as this campaign hasn&#x27;t been seen in older Ultimate Teams. Naturally, there&#x27;s plenty of reasons to be excited, but EA Sports has remained tight-lipped about the promo cards as of writing. Only the release date has been confirmed, and if you&#x27;re looking to find out more about the cards, you&#x27;ll need to rely on the social media leaks and rumors. 


Complete list of EA FC 25 NumeroFUT promo players


Unlike Winter Wildcards, NumeroFUT won&#x27;t be having any special set of Heroes and Icons. It will only include promo cards for active footballers, and a few big names have already been leaked. 



Rafael Leao


Robert Lewandowski


James Maddison


Eduardo Camavinga


Jonathan Tah


James Rodriguez


Pedro Neto


Dusan Vlahovic


Leon Goretzka



More names are expected to be added as the release date gets closer. Once we have more leaks, the names will be added to this list. James Rodriguez could be an interesting addition since he&#x27;s been reintroduced to Ultimate Team only recently. Just like Juan Mata and David De Gea, we could get this first special card during the upcoming campaign.


NumeroFUT will go live on Friday, January 3, at 6 p.m. UK time when the special cards will be added to the packs. A few items are also expected to be released via SBCs and objectives, so make sure to be on the lookout for those. Additionally, Season 4 rewards also feature a few NumeroFUT items with Marco Asensio available as early as level 11. That&#x27;s a great way to stack your club with a few promo items for free.

As with any gacha, you&#x27;ll want to focus on getting a strong start, and that means selecting units that are relatively overpowered in the early days. Doing so will help you clear out all the content quicker and earn more rewards in the process. During the opening week, I felt that the overall balance of the characters was decent, but some of them clearly stood out.


Starseed: Asnia Trigger tier list


To rank the characters, I have used four different tiers. While the SSR units are clearly better, you shouldn&#x27;t sleep on some of the more commonly available girls as well.



S-tier: Absolutely broken units in the current meta.

                              <span>In 2022, a group of Israel-based TV companies obtained a court order in the U.S. It compelled every ISP in the country to block three resilient pirate sites that blocking in Israel had failed to stop. Intervention by Cloudflare ended that dream and 2.5 years later, despite other measures targeting the sites, it appears that at least one is still going strong. The TV companies are now taking legal action against UK ISPs; they&#x27;re unlikely to put up a fight, they may not even turn up in court.

                              <span>The Egg of the King is a vital resource to find, and doing so will allow you to upgrade Griffin in Anime Adventures.


This particular item is tied closely to the Eggs of Sacrifice that you can earn via different in-game activities. To evolve Griffin, you&#x27;ll need Periapt of the King to access him first. Let&#x27;s take a look at how to get this item in the first place.


How to get Egg of the King in Anime Adventures


So far, the only known way to find Egg of the King is by using a Summoning Circle. The odds will be low as it&#x27;s a Mythic item. Odds-wise, you can obtain it from any available banners, but the Special one will have better chances with a 2x Mythic boost. Do note that it&#x27;s a matter of luck, and you may require a lot of diamonds to make the rolls.


Unfortunately, there&#x27;s no sure-shot way to obtain this item, which would certainly have been nice. Nevertheless, the item isn&#x27;t tied to a time-limited event, so you can have your fair share of tries even if initially unsuccessful.




How to use the Periapt of the King in Anime Adventures


As I said earlier, the Periapt of the King is closely associated with the Eggs of Sacrifice that you can find in Anime Adventures. The Egg of the King will be available in your items stash, and you can also search for it using its name. Once you select the item and decide to use it, a red portal will open, leading you to the Griffin NPC location. From there, you can use the Eggs of Sacrifice to evolve him.


If you&#x27;re unsure how to get Eggs of Sacrifice, check this guide out. As with Egg of the King, the Eggs of Sacrifice will also require concentrated efforts and a long time to find. You can also sacrifice Mythic items to quicken the process, but you&#x27;ll lose those units permanently.

                              <span>EA FC 25 has kicked off 2025 with a bang, as the New Year&#x27;s Kick Off SBC is now live in Ultimate Team.


Typically, fodder challenges don&#x27;t often offer amazing rewards, as they&#x27;re easy to complete. The New Year&#x27;s Kick Off SBC is a paradox, as it&#x27;s easy to complete, but the reward on offer is amazing. You can obtain a Jumbo Rare Players Pack by completing the challenge that typically costs 100,000 coins from the in-game store. 


Let&#x27;s take a look at how to complete the challenge and win the rewards. 


EA FC 25 New Year&#x27;s Kick Off SBC tasks


The New Year&#x27;s Kick Off SBC has a single task, and here are the conditions.

Bungie created three limited-time Emblems for the event featuring Commander Zavala, Ikora Rey, and Crow. The Emblems were supposed to be extremely rare at the event&#x27;s launch and progressively become easier to earn as the event went on. However, it doesn&#x27;t seem like that&#x27;s how everything played out in-game.


Destiny 2 has been having a rough go lately. The current Episode, Revenant, has been rife with issues. First, players realized weapon Perks weren&#x27;t being distributed correctly in what became known as Weightgate, and that was followed shortly after by Tonicgate, where players revealed that Revenant&#x27;s primary loot system, Tonics, …</span>

This specific technique is easily among the top, but acquiring it can be slightly tricky. Let&#x27;s take a look at how you can unlock this Special Grade technique and the boosts it can provide.


How to acquire Demon Vessel in Jujutsu Infinite


The process of acquiring the Demon Vessel is the same as any other Innate Technique. You&#x27;ll have to try out Innate Spins and hope to get lucky. Thankfully, there are several ways of obtaining an Innate Spin, and you can have multiple tries daily.


While codes and login bonuses can fetch you a lot of spins, make sure to enter AFK World to get more of them while taking a break.

                              <span>Completing the Periapt of Sacrifice should be a top priority if you want mighty units in Anime Adventures. Doing so will help you get the Eggs of Sacrifice, which will be necessary as you upgrade your units.


Let&#x27;s take a look at how you can farm the Periapt of Sacrifice and gain the eggs in a consistent fashion.


Best way to farm Sacrifice Eggs in Anime Adventures


The most consistent way to get the Eggs of Sacrifice is by using Eclipse Portals. These portals can be acquired from the Snow Kingdom Infinite mode. While the mode can be difficult for beginners, completing it won&#x27;t be an issue if you have units over level 100.


To make the most out of your urns, try to host the Eclipse Portals, as it will increase your final rewards. However, you can also join runs set up by other players, although the rewards will get lower. If the Eclipse Portal runs feel difficult, you can play with your friends or other players, making it easier to survive all the waves.


Additionally, speak with Zen to get a daily quest for seven Periapts of Sacrifice. To complete the mission, kill the demons that spawn in Eclipse Portals and Snow Kingdom Infinite mode.




How to use Eggs of Sacrifice in Anime Adventures


Once you complete a run, you&#x27;ll get a random amount of Periapts of Sacrifice. The number of eggs you get for hosting a run will always be higher. You&#x27;ll have to teleport to the special area of Griffin NPC to use the eggs. To do so, you&#x27;ll need the Periapt of the King.


To evolve, you&#x27;ll need around 200 eggs as each one progresses your Ascension by 0.5%. You can also sacrifice Mythical units that you don&#x27;t need to quicken the process. Sacrificing evolved Mythical units will provide the best progression, but you&#x27;ll lose the units permanently.

                              <span>There are many ways to power up in Jujutsu Infinite, and promoting your character after a certain point becomes necessary.


A dedicated ranking system is in place, which allows you to take your abilities to the next level. However, this system is slightly different in terms of how it works. Let&#x27;s take a look at how you can promote your character, along with the resources you will need.


How to rank up in Jujutsu Infinite


The process begins by completing as many quests or missions as you can. Completing them will earn you various rewards and EXP. The amount of EXP you get varies based on the nature and difficulty of quests, but completing them will help you grow your in-game character.


When you begin this process, you&#x27;ll have the rank of &quot;Non-Sorcerer.&quot; Once you reach level 60, you can talk with the Clan Head NPC to rank yourself up. There are five different ranks (or, as the game calls it, Grades), and you&#x27;ll need certain resources besides being at the necessary player levels. Once you fulfill the requirements and have the necessary resources, interacting with the Clan Head NPC will allow you to rank up.


All promotion levels in Jujutsu Infinite


The following table details all the prerequisites applicable for the five rank-up levels.


Grade
Requirements




Grade 4
Reach Level 60
Collect 25 Mission Essence
$5,000


Grade 3
Reach Level 120
Collect 50 Mission Essence
$50,000


Grade 2
Reach Level 180
Collect 100 Mission Essence
$100,000


Grade 1
Reach Level 240
Collect 150 Mission Essence
$250,000


Special Grade
Reach Level 300
Collect 200 Mission Essence
$500,000






Apart from in-game credits and EXP, you&#x27;ll also need to get a lot of Mission Essence. The requirements go up as you reach higher ranks, and here is our guide on the best ways to farm Mission Essence. Doing so will always keep you ready for the next rank as soon as your player level meets the requirements.

You walk into a poorly lit, seemingly empty hotel. In desperate need of someone to speak to, you hesitantly wander just a single room farther from the entrance, down a serene walkway.

Throughout 2025, many of gaming&#x27;s most treasured gems will be celebrating a significant birthday and to remind you of some of the biggest (and of just how old you are!), we&#x27;ve compiled this list of nearly 60 gaming dates for your calendars.
What do we mean by &#x27;significant&#x27; birthdays? Anything that ends in a five or a zero - fairly standard stuff. 10 years is the minimum for the list below (and believe us, compiling this list had us gawping in disbelief multiple times at five-year-old games which feel like they launched six months ago - Hades cannot be five this year!) and you&#x27;ll see a few games that will be heading into their fifth decade sometime in 2025.

Despite some increasingly convincing leaks, we still don&#x27;t actually know 100% what form Switch 2 is going to take.
It&#x27;s safe to assume at this point that it will retain the same basic form factor as the original Switch – a tablet-like console with detachable controllers – but a recent announcement from Chinese firm AYANEO has us secretly wishing that Nintendo might think outside the box with some aspects of its new machine.

Looking for the best new Nintendo Switch games releasing soon? Even in its twilight years, Nintendo&#x27;s hybrid console is delivering, but next year could well be ushering in the successor. That doesn&#x27;t mean the Switch is being left behind in 2025, though.
2024 was a quieter year for Nintendo, but it was still a busy one for the Switch. 2025 is already looking extremely healthy — we&#x27;ll be kicking the year off with Donkey Kong Country Returns HD, with a Wii U favourite in Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition filling out the first quarter nicely. 2025 should also give us a brand new Pokémon game in Pokémon Legends: Z-A. But, most importantly, the long-awaited Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is due to land in 2025.

                              <span>Italy launched its ambitious &quot;Piracy Shield&quot; platform in early 2024, hoping to finally curb the rampant piracy of live sports events. Throughout the year, the system has primarily targeted the domains and IP addresses used by pirate IPTV providers to stream illegal content. Official data made available to the public is limited but with help from data provided by an anonymous source, we can identify key trends from a very controversial year.

Two of them didn&#x27;t come out this year, which is an easy disqualification, but the reality is that I also don&#x27;t think any of them truly deserve a place in one of those hallowed chambers.

Yet all three are games that in some way defined my year, and I feel affection for each of them. Let me explain why.

Grip the fibrous handles, feel its jagged soul imprint upon your palm. Now pull! Rend the sinew, tear muscle from bone, hatch their fetid gift! The yoke draws near! Take up the slip and read the words upon its face.
Time to enjoy your lovely joke!

There are different gears you can equip, and some of them are pretty ordinary. Rotten Chains, on the other hand, is a Special Grade gear, and it is immensely powerful. Unlike most resources, you can&#x27;t trade for it or open chests to find it. Instead, you&#x27;ll have to put in the hard yards in order to secure the gear inside Jujutsu Infinite.


How to obtain Rotten Chains in Jujutsu Infinite


There are two ways to obtain Rotten Chains inside the game. You can obtain it by defeating the Finger Bearer Boss in a raid or craft it directly with the correct resources. After completing the Finger Bearer Boss raid, there&#x27;s a chance for Rotten Chains to drop as the mai…</span>

Completing quests in Jujutsu Infinite is pretty important if you want to improve your in-game progression consistently. Some of them often reward you with valuable resources that can be extremely useful on your journey. Unlike typical resources, the Gilded Apple can&#x27;t be found in chests or traded in the Curse Market.


Let&#x27;s take a look at how you can obtain this item.


How to find the Gilded Apple in Jujutsu Infinite


To begin the process, you&#x27;ll need to activate the Gilded Apple quest from the NPC in the Numa Temple area. This location can be found to the southeast of Shijo Town, where everyone begins their journey. The NPC can be found near the mission…</span>

However, it is expensive, so if you’re not willing to pay for such an enthusiast device, then a cheaper version is on its way.


Before you get too excited, it’s still an expensive proposition. The RetroTink-4K CE (cheaper edition?) will still run you $475 USD. That’s quite a bit cheaper than the $750 for the RetroTink-4K Pro, but it’s still quite expensive. Considering you can get a Nintendo Switch for cheaper, you can see how this is an enthusiast-only device.


To back up for a sec, the RetroTink-4K is a type of hardware that upscales the video output of older devices. Your TV technically already does that, but for an…</span>

The events during Heavensturn events are never particularly challenging, but those during the 2025 event are easier than they’ve been in recent years. Getting your hands on the Great White Tsuchinoko minion is remarkably easy, as long as you have some knowledge of eastern culture and customs, as well as some understanding of in-game lore.

                              <span>It’s always the same at this time of year, the ball is prepped and ready to drop in Times Square, families are getting ready to gather together, and a whole new year full of fresh possibilities is almost upon us. New Year’s resolutions are being made around the world, and one is more common than any other. 


After the holiday season, filled with excuses to gorge and reasons to skip exercising, it’s fair to say that everyone feels a little down about their eating and fitness routines to an extent. The new year offers a chance to set an achievable goal, and if you’re anything like it, it usually has something to do with becoming more physically active. 


It’s an achievable goal, but there are issues when it comes to implementing new fitness regimes into day-to-day life. Many of us work at …</span>

                              <span>Dragon Tokens have confused many Blox Fruits players since they randomly got added to the account of certain players, but it has their use inside the game.


Incidentally, the mysterious item wasn&#x27;t available in the account of every player. Instead, it got added to the accounts of those who have been Blox Fruits for some time now and had downloaded Update 24 before the developers pulled back. As I said, this item has certain uses inside the game, so let&#x27;s understand how it works.


How to get Dragon Tokens in Blox Fruits


Update 24 introduced several new things to Blox Fruits, which included an updated version of the Dragon Fruit. Unfortunately, the update was pulled back by the developers, and players who had the Dragon Fruit lost access to it. To compensate the players, they were handed something called a Dragon Token.


Again, this token is of two types. Players having a non-permanent or physical version of the Dragon Fruit were provided with a regular Dragon Token. Those who had a permanent Dragon Fruit were provided with a Permanent Dragon Token.


Incidentally, the price of Dragon Fruit has been raised from 4,000 Robux to 5,000 following the implementation of Update 24.




How to use Dragon Tokens in Blox Fruits


The use of a Dragon Token mostly depends on the type you have. If you have a permanent Dragon Token, you can use it to obtain a permanent East or West Dragon Fruit. The version will be completely randomized, but it&#x27;s a great return since you&#x27;re getting an upgraded version of the Dragon Fruit.


If you received a non-permanent Dragon Token, you can use it to get a non-permanent East or West Dragon Fruit. Again, the final item you get will be completely randomized. If you end up getting a duplicate Dragon Fruit in your inventory, it will be automatically changed to a Mythical Fruit.

But given the large history behind each member of the game&#x27;s cast, there are many more we would love to see. Here are 10 alternative skins we would love to see arrive in Marvel Rivals.


Black Suit (Spider-Man)

Although the character might be a hit gameplay-wise, Spidey&#x27;s Marvel Rivals default and alternative in-game suits are seen by many as a miss, with his PlayStation-exclusive Scarlet Spider being a saving grace. Well, that&#x27;s where the classic Black Suit comes in, as the simplistic look is both a fan favorite and one hell of a fit, so much so that Peter continued to wear…</span>

                              <span>It&#x27;s time to celebrate the end of 2024 and the start of a new year with a beautiful outfit in Dress to Impress. The Sparkling Resolution outfit features a dress, necklace, and sleeves but is only available until January 2, 2025.


How to get the Sparkling Resolution outfit in Dress to Impress


The Sparkling Resolution outfit is a limited-time set available in the Dress to Impress clothing shop for $6,000 in-game cash or the equivalent of 1,500 Robux. You can buy the set&#x27;s individual pieces or all three items at once starting from December 30 until the event&#x27;s end date, January 2, 2025.

You can view the Sparkling Resolution outfit by selecting the shoe and lipstick button on the left side of your screen and navigating to the dress button.


You have the option to buy each of the three items separately or all at once if you have enough cash. Below is the cost of every Sparkling Resolution piece:



Sparkling Dress: $4,500


Sparkling Sleeve: $1,000


Sparkling Necklace: $500



Purchasing all three pieces costs $6,000 in-game money, making it not only possible to acquire without spending real money but making it cheaper than sets like Myra the Magical Girl. However, it&#x27;s only available until January 2, giving you just a few days to get your hands on this exclusive outfit. 


It doesn&#x27;t come with a hairstyle or makeup, though, so you may have to use a few Dress to Impress codes to complete the set.


Like other outfits in Dress to Impress, you can customize the Sparkling Resolution set to match your current theme. Depending on the theme, you may have to change it to other common colors like white, black, red, or a mix of several hues. Similarly, if you&#x27;re not a fan of purple and want to try something new, you can experiment with various patterns and see what sticks.

In Jujutsu Infinite, chests help you get plenty of resources that are required to unlock power-ups like Domain Expansion and Innate Techniques. Some of these resources, like Maximum Scrolls, are rare items, and their spawn rates are extremely low. Naturally, you would want to use consumables to improve your luck, and a Jade Lotus is perhaps your best friend in this matter.

                              <span>When Grinding Gear Games dropped the announcement for Path of Exile 2 (PoE2), it wasn’t just about continuing the series. It was about shaking things up in a big way, making changes that fundamentally alter the way players would engage with the sequel to one of gaming&#x27;s most impactful ARPGs.


One of the biggest, most defining changes? The approach toward difficulty. From the slower, Souls-like campaign to the highly punishing Endgame, this topic is a firey one for the community. So, let’s talk about it: is the difficulty a bit too much, or is it exactly what the franchise needed to evolve?

                              <span>If you were to ask any fan of rhythm games what their favorite titles are, odds are that their first choices will likely be a selection of games that are now relegated to consoles past, lost to ever-progressing technology. It’s easy to believe that the genre itself is lost to history, but that’s not necessarily the case. 


Yes, games like Dance Dance Revolution, Rock Band, and Guitar Hero are undoubtedly reserved for those old-school gamers who still have their old consoles, or visit Dave &amp; Busters on a regular basis. However, that doesn’t mean that newer rhythm games don’t exist for current-generation Console or PC players, you just have to look a little harder to find them. 


And they’re worth playing for more reasons than simply passing the time, as well. Did you know that playing rhy…</span>

                              <span>Tilt your head to the sky, all you true believers out there: Marvel Studios rang in the new year with the first trailer for Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man, a new animated series set to put a new spin on Peter Parker&#x27;s rise to heroism. 


Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man has already crossed many boxes off the standard &quot;Spider-Man origin story&quot; checklist: a do-it-yourself superhero suit, high school drama, and a variation of Spidey&#x27;s age-old mantra about power and responsibility. However, the series&#x27; teaser made it clear as day that this retelling of the Wall Crawler&#x27;s early days is taking big swings and changing some things around.

                              <span>Some of the best swords in gaming are particularly iconic, such as the Keyblade and the Master Sword from The Legend of Zelda. They help give us a power fantasy in video games as they strengthen our heroes and strike fear into our foes. 


So here are the ten most iconic swords in gaming—and naturally—this is my humble opinion. Let&#x27;s go.


10. The Crucible (Doom Eternal)

The Crucible from Doom Eternal is the epitome of badass. This huge red sword with the flared blade tip is one of the main marketing images shown within the trailer of the game, as seen above, ramping up excitement for the 2020 sequel. It lets you slice and dice demons with its sheer power. It&#x27;s filled with demon energy and has some epic text on the blade that makes the…</span>

Editor&#x27;s note: This article was originally published in December 2023 as a review in progress. We had hoped to return to Palia once it hit version 1.0, but it&#x27;s still not there at the time of writing. Therefore we&#x27;re revisiting one year on to see how things have changed with some new text up top and a score below.

A full year on from its initial beta launch, now feels like as good a time as any to revisit Palia to see what’s changed. The good and bad news is… well, not that much.

Japanese publication Famitsu has held its traditional end-of-year interview round-up with game creators, speaking to 158 different people about their hopes and aspirations for 2025.
The replies weren&#x27;t totally focused on games – some of the interviewees spoke about what they were looking forward to seeing in the worlds of movies, music and tech in 2025 – but it was interesting to note that two of the Square Enix staffers included in the round-up mentioned Switch 2.

                              <span>Why don&#x27;t we just wait here for a little while?
Nightdive Studio&#x27;s The Thing: Remastered launched in North America back on 5th December, giving Switch gamers in that territory the chance to (re)acquaint themselves with Computer Artwork&#x27;s cult squad-based shooter from 2002. However, the European release has been tied up for weeks and it&#x27;s yet to appear on eShops east of the Atlantic.
The developer and publisher of the remaster took to social media with an update, indicating that the game — based on John Carpenter&#x27;s 1982 film, of course — has been submitted to Nintendo of Europe and the team is just waiting for it to appear. Presumably, it&#x27;s wedged somewhere in Nintendo&#x27;s holiday backlog, so it looks like it&#x27;s going to be a 2025 release around these parts:

                              <span>Unlike a lot of the team I&#x27;d imagine, my opinion is this: I thought the year was quite middling for games. Or at least, it was middling for my own personal taste, which is quite unsavoury at the best of times. Most of my best picks made it into the calendar proper, but a couple didn&#x27;t. One I hadn&#x27;t even played properly until after the vote, and the other? The other is a flawed pick, but one that I couldn&#x27;t stop thinking about.
Anyway, hope you all have a restful Xmas folks and a cracking new year. I hope Santa bought you some nice warm socks or a chocolate orange so dense, you could tee it off at your local golf club.

Grip the fibrous handles, feel its jagged soul imprint upon your palm. Now pull! Rend the sinew, tear muscle from bone, hatch their fetid gift! The yoke draws near! Take up the slip and read the words upon its face.
Time to enjoy your lovely joke!

Going off benchmarks I ran back at the end of 2022 on the same AMD Titanite EPYC reference server platform for two EPYC 9654 Genoa processors, I repeated the same tests using the newest releases of Intel Clear Linux and Ubuntu Linux for seeing how the performance has evolved.</span>

Algoritmus je tak rychlý, že dokonce přesahuje propustnosti operační paměti. Nejde však o kryptografický hash. Jestli je tedy potřeba ochrany před záměrnou změnou obsahu souborů, nejrychlejší kryptografický hash je patrně Blake3 (nástroj b3sum). Algoritmus xxHash se například používá ke kontrole integrity právě v zstd.</span>

All my major choices are in there, plus a few more that I haven&#x27;t played but I&#x27;d watched other people play, and had a swell time doing so. Still, there are always a handful that don&#x27;t quite make the cut, but still deserve a heaped Christmas plateful of praise at year&#x27;s end.

Take up the slip and read the words upon its face.
Time to enjoy your lovely joke!

I want to feel what it&#x27;s like to hike through canyons with too much sellable loot in my backpack.

                              <span>The fell moons rise, and in their cold glare emerges a parcel from the dirt. Bloat and gangrene, crimped as if by tourniquet. A dark promise wriggles within. Grip the fibrous handles, feel its jagged soul imprint upon your palm. Now pull! Rend the sinew, tear muscle from bone, hatch their fetid gift! The yoke draws near! Take up the slip and read the words upon its face.
Time to enjoy your lovely joke!

                              <span>According to a phrase popularized by Carl Sagan, extraordinary claims should be supported by extraordinary evidence. A new piracy scare story published on Sunday takes a different approach. The extraordinary claim is that fake IPTV portals run by law enforcement are entrapping &quot;ordinary users&quot; to obtain evidence of their crimes. Supported by exactly zero evidence, the report claims that hundreds of internet users have already been identified.

                              <span>&#x27;House of the Dragon&#x27; is the most-pirated TV show released on torrent sites in 2024. The popular &#x27;Game of Thrones&#x27; prequel replaces &#x27;The Last of Us&#x27;, which topped the chart last year. Amazon&#x27;s &#x27;The Boys&#x27; takes the second spot at a respectable distance, while Disney&#x27;s Shōgun is the hottest newcomer.

                              <span>My selection box isn&#x27;t really a selection box. It&#x27;s a tray of barely-nibbled leftovers, hastily lifted from my Steam backlog. One of the disadvantages of being news editor, you see, is that I have  developed a goldfish-grade attention span. In my hectic pursuit of the next scoop, or the next Elden Ring update changelog, I snatch and cast aside game demos like a pickpocket speedrunning the checkout line at Harvey Nichols. I&#x27;m dimly aware that some of these cast-aside games are Very Good. A few might even deserve to be played for longer than 30 minutes. I feel immensely guilty about that. Perhaps a little... existential, too. I have measured out my life in tutorial levels. 


So! Rather than digging out three of the games I&#x27;ve actually completed this year, such as The Crush House, Death Of A Wish and Mask Quest, I&#x27;m going to gamble on recommending a few I&#x27;ve barely scratched, but which sure feel excellent and have attracted a positive critical consensus. If I am false in this assessment, may Horace the Endless Bear bite my head off for my impudence. Let&#x27;s begin.

Grip the fibrous handles, feel its jagged soul imprint upon your palm. Now pull! Rend the sinew, tear muscle from bone, hatch their fetid gift! The yoke draws near! Take up the slip and read the words upon its face.
Time to enjoy your lovely joke!

Grip the fibrous handles, feel its jagged soul imprint upon your palm. Now pull! Rend the sinew, tear muscle from bone, hatch their fetid gift! The yoke draws near! Take up the slip and read the words upon its face.
Time to enjoy your lovely joke!

                              <span>In a landmark ruling, the Court of Milan has ordered Cloudflare to block pirate streaming services that offer Serie A football matches. The court found that Cloudflare&#x27;s services are instrumental in facilitating access to live pirate streams, undermining Italy&#x27;s &#x27;Piracy Shield&#x27; legislation. The order, which applies in Italy, affects Cloudflare&#x27;s CDN, DNS resolver, WARP and proxy services. It also includes a broad data disclosure section.

                              <span>Ho, ho, ho, Santa is in town. And he’s brought a gift with him. Here’s a shiny new package for you to unwrap, containing the first beta version of the upcoming OpenTTD 15 release. It comes faster, with road waypoints, fewer passwords, better scenario editor, and hopefully with a lot less bugs. To be a bit less vague, here are some of the highlights: Improved picker windows for stations/waypoints/objects/and more. Oh, and that does include road waypoints. Better perfomance in various places, including faster path signals that are now green by default. Password-less network authentication using keys. Several improvements for NewGRFs regarding cargo support. Better scenario editor with a town data importer and manual house placement. A large tree fully hung with ornamental bugfixes. Sadly though, not everbody was good this year. The old NPF pathfinder was finally retired, after YAPF being the superior default for many, many years now. There’s a lot of bugs left for you to find, though, guaranteed. Enjoy the beta, test all the things and report anything you find amiss, to make OpenTTD 15 the best OpenTTD 15 ever.

Novinek je zkrátka dost, jde celkem o 1198 commitů do darktable a rawspeed, celkem 505 zpracovaných pull requestů a uzavřených 45 hlášení o problémech. Pascal rovnou dodává, že dokumentace pro tuto verzi ještě není kompletní.</span>

Despite the win, the broadcaster was disappointed that the court had found the company behind Rojadirecta liable, but not company owner Igor Seoane. After the Supreme Court held that Seoane could be held liable, last Friday a court confirmed total damages of $33 million, with Seoane and the company jointly liable for half of that amount.

She wasn&#x27;t impressed. &quot;Detective,&quot; she said, glaring at me with eyes like gorgeous tennis balls, &quot;I want to open today&#x27;s advent calendar door.&quot; I was confused. &quot;Whaddya wanna do that for, missy?&quot; She sat back, relaxed, and pulled a gun from her purse. &quot;I need to stuff a body into it.&quot;

Due to the intervention of Dark Powers and also, half the Treehouse already being on holiday, we neglected to do a round-up of staff Xmas plays before signing off for the year.

If I publish this and it turns out we have two, please divide into rival factions and have a comments war over which is the real one. Apologies! Normal service will resume next year.

                              <span>Sonic the Hedgehog 3 is out in theaters now, and like the first two films, it has a post-credits stinger that gives us an idea of what’s to come in the next movie, which, it seems, is coming in 2027. However, Sonic 3’s isn’t quite as self-explanatory as those in the first two movies if you’re not already familiar with…

                              <span>The easiest way to hurt a pirate site, at least temporarily, is by taking away its domain name. Historically, domain name registries have been hesitant to take action but with the right approach, progress can be made. This week, anti-piracy group BREIN reported that following their complaints, the .nl and .eu registries took action against several &#x27;pirate&#x27; domains. On closer inspection, it appears that copyright has little to do with it.

                              <span>Coordinated by Italy last month, a huge law enforcement operation reportedly &#x27;dismantled&#x27; a pirate IPTV service with 22 million users. That&#x27;s an extraordinary number and shows why countries like Italy have adopted mass site blocking measures. Logic suggests that the removal of such a huge player from the market might reduce the need for blocking measures, if only temporarily. The data shows that in the wake of the action, blocking demands significantly increased.

                              <span>&quot;A tactically rich turn-based game with some meaty role-playing elements&quot;, was how Staff Sergeant James Archer characterised his Menace hands-on, back in September. The only thing missing from his account of the game was the bread needed to make that rich, meaty concoction a tasty, nourishing sandwich.
And by bread, I of course mean the strategic layer - the parts between the turn-based battles where you pick your next mission, improve your squads, deal with pop-up story events, appraise your standing with each NPC faction, and equip your strike cruiser with auxiliary systems. Developers Overhype have now shared a few details of how it all works. Mmmmm, such malty, yeasty strategicalness.

Instead, I want to talk about mini PCs – not just small-form-factor desktops, but properly tiny, box o’ chocolates-sized computers – which have, of course, been around for decades.
Recently, however, I’ve been wondering if mini PCs are finally on the cusp of having their moment as serious games machines. Between rising desktop component prices and ever-ballooning electricity bills, it would make sense that a smaller, cheaper system would take on a new appeal, and the success of handhelds like the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Ally show that convenience still trumps out-and-out performance for a lot of PC players. There have even been hints that Valve are resurrecting their Steam Machine mini PC concept, years after a flopping first attempt. Should you be interested?

Its structure most resembles Songs of Conquest or Heroes of Might and/or Magic, but with little RPG emphasis or base building, and minimal tactical fighting.
Taxonomy is arbitrary and often unimportant at the end of the day, but I am very glad to firmly rule it out of one category: It&#x27;s not a bloody card game. It looks like one, sure. You do most things with cards, and characters acquire more cards over time. But even if you absolutely, utterly, and correctly loathe card-based systems, this game has none.

                              <span>Two men on the board of directors for Epic Games have stepped down from their positions after the US Department of Justice investigated the board under antitrust laws. The pair of directors were originally appointed to Epic&#x27;s board by Tencent (who slurp upon a minority stake in the Unreal Engine company) but the United States government took a look at this and said: ah-ah-ah, you&#x27;re not allowed to have a director in your boardroom if they&#x27;re already fingers-deep in the pie of a competing company. Naughty Tencent! Naughty Epic! And, yes, naughty Riot Games!

The Winter sale that began yesterday is almost identical to the Autumn sale that ended just two weeks ago, for example. But you can still find one or two gifts if you bore deep enough into the ice. Me? I&#x27;m only interested in one thing. How many of these games are snowy and chilly enough to induce wonderful hypothermia? I&#x27;m on a frostbitten quest to find out. Here are the most winter-iest games you can pick up for cheap.

At least that&#x27;s what the interstellar pilots of Elite Dangerous are celebrating in the galaxy-sized multiplayer space sim. Earlier this month, the Thargoid menace finally landed in the Sol system, putting earth itself under threat for the first time, not to mention other human homeworlds and colonies. This meant players were invited to drop everything and head for home - to embark on one last great stand against the final, desperate, and dangerous alien attacker: a Thargoid Titan called &quot;Cocijo&quot;. Don&#x27;t worry, they got him.

                              <span>Frostpunk developers 11 bit studios have cancelled a new, console-oriented game in response to both &quot;shifting market trends&quot; - in particular, declining player enthusiasm for &quot;narrative-driven, story-rich games&quot; - and specific problems during development. As a consequence, a number of 11 bit staff are going to lose their jobs, though at least half of the affected development team are being offered the chance to move to other projects, including a few unannounced ones.

                              <span>At any given moment I am in the center of a wonderful vortex of skeletons. Bones splash and rattle and burst out of the ground in sharp, horrible spurs. My weakest skeletons, sensing their death coming, explode into fire and shards. My strongest skeletons fight so hard and with such alacrity that upon dying, they drag their spirits together and keep fighting as ghosts for a while. Foul little bone scorpions skitter around on fans of legs made from human hands. Somewhere in the middle, almost invisible among the noise, is the character I am actually playing: Path of Exile 2’s mean-spirited, callous, and gleefully enjoyable Witch.
This is a review in progress. It has to be. Even in its incomplete early access period, Path of Exile 2 is a great sprawling mass of a game. Three meaty acts of a planned six act campaign are followed by a trickier return tour through them, before the absurd endgame kicks into gear and the real work begins. If I came to you having played everything on offer I would be wild-haired, bloodshot-eyed and possessing perfect, incomprehensible knowledge. Let’s compromise: I have toured the dark caverns and the antediluvian crypts. I have been killed by various accumulated nasties. I’ve had a great time.

                              <span>The announcement of The Witcher 4 with The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt&#x27;s Ciri as protagonist has attracted a bit of discussion. Some of the reaction is online toddlers waxing wroth about a video game having a (somewhat older!!!) woman as lead character, and especially, shock, a video game in a series that has hitherto starred a man. And some of it is people commenting more thoughtfully on whether Ciri genuinely makes for a suitable Witcher protagonist, given that she isn&#x27;t the product of the typical Witcher genetic modification regime (which is heavily tailored towards men), and given that, without spoiling too much, she has gifts that make crumbly old Geralt&#x27;s sword-and-sorcery skillset look rather paltry. 


Speaking to Eurogamer this week, game director Sebastian Kalemba and narrative director Philipp Weber responded to a few of these comments, and also shared a little about Ciri&#x27;s situation at the start of the game.

                              <span>&quot;We are a people who honour democracy,&quot; said the dog, scratching himself. &quot;Per our custom, you may drink of our fresh water.&quot; The dog was called Senator Umeshefaat, and he was very civil, even if he was shedding his black and white fur everywhere. We spoke in his home village at dawn. Later, I examined the senator&#x27;s personal history more thoroughly and discovered he was &quot;hated by bears for cooking them a rancid meal.&quot; I suppose every politician has their enemies. 
That Caves Of Qud creates fun anecdotes out of simple encounters shouldn&#x27;t be a surprise. It has had 15 years of early access to establish itself as a small-but-mighty story generating roguelike of repute (there&#x27;s a reason it sits deservedly side-by-side with Dwarf Fortress in the same publishing house). After creating many characters, and dying and dying and dying again, I understand why it grips the brain with such fierce glee. It is a machine of grand imagination and adventuresome comedy. A deceptively powerful RPG that isn&#x27;t half as obtuse to newcomers as the screenshots make it out to be. Qud&#x27;s low-res bark is just a complement to its bite.

                              <span>Insults are so serious, these days. They&#x27;re all so insulting, whereas the kinds of insult I cherish are the ones that coax a belly laugh from both the roaster and the roastee. Here are a few stupid putdowns I&#x27;ve found or made up specially for Xmas, organised into tiers of savagery.

Sony and Kadokawa were reported to be in talks last month, fomenting all sorts of speculation about, say, the PC version of Bloodborne being ritually sacrificed to consecrate the PS6-exclusivity of Dark Souls 4. Now, the pair have emerged from the Cave of Haggling and announced... &quot;a strategic capital and business alliance agreement&quot;. What does this mean? Is it safe to scream yet?

                              <span>They say hope is the first step on the road to disappointment, and reader, I’ve made a pretty damn big step. Previously, on my mission to survive S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl with only wild mutants as my weapons, I’d discovered clues that someone else was attempting to tame the Zone’s beastly inhabitants. With one of their electronic tracking collars in hand and absolutely no preexisting knowledge of their location, I set out to find this kindred spirit, only for the Zone to once again slam a door in my face.
A cold, steel, very literal door to boot. It turns out that the scientist’s laboratory is locked up tight, and will remain so until I delve about twenty hours deeper into the faction war that’s bubbled up while I’ve been running around throwing irradiated rats at people in tracksuits. Fine. Fine! But I’m keeping the collar.

                              <span>Fists up, a big fighting game mod is due out this weekend. Marvel vs Capcom Infinite came out in 2017 and got some flak for its plastic figurine art style. But this year a modder began work on an overhaul that would grant the game pretty cel-shaded visuals. Since then the modding team has grown to 40 people and the scope of the mod&#x27;s features has ballooned. It&#x27;s now going to include new moves, stages, costumes, and a chaotic-looking 2v2 multiplayer tag team mode. All good news for biff &#x27;em up sickos, as the mod is due to release on Friday.

In October of this year, we got a look at some icky celestial faction and zero in the way of actual gameplay. And now? Now we finally get a look at how you do things. Like sucker-punching armoured space bears in the face with electro-pistols.

                              <span>After much teasing, the vicious tyrants of Arrowhead Games and their noxious puppets, the &quot;democratic government&quot; of Super Earth, have announced the very first Helldivers 2 licensed crossover. In yet another hollow display of solidarity and &quot;Liber-tea&quot;, they&#x27;ve teamed up with the loathsome fascists of Killzone, the elderly shooter series from Sony and Guerrilla Games.
From today, you&#x27;ll be able to buy weapons, armour and cosmetics belonging to Killzone&#x27;s despicable stormtroopers from the Helldivers Superstore, and there&#x27;s the suggestion of an additional Killzone-themed reward depending on the fortunes of the so-called Galactic War, a xenocidal bloodbath couched as an exercise in bringing &quot;freedom&quot; to the upstanding socialist Automatons, the blameless wildlife of the Tyranids, and the Wellsian cosplayers of the recently added Illuminate faction.
We here at Rock Paper Shotgun stand against Super Earth and Arrowhead&#x27;s wanton aggression, which absolutely isn&#x27;t a big satirical joke based on some Verhoeven film or other. Anyway, those capes. Find an image and further details below.

                              <span>Times Of Progress is a special game for me, because it&#x27;s the first news tip I have ever received from Sin Vega, Prime Minister of Strategy Gaming. Sin once described writing news articles for our former news editor Alice0 (RPS in peace) as like practising backflips in front of the kung fu master. Writing about a new city builder at Sin&#x27;s suggestion is like being invited to budget the development of Londinium by Julius Caesar.
The terror of screwing it up - together with other, more trivial distractions, like international games industry conferences - has stopped me from writing about Times Of Progress for months. Today I bite the bullet, and emerge from my lodgings to issue a hesitant speech to the masses, hoping like hell that Caesar is too preoccupied with the latest Gaul uprising to notice my errors.

                              <span>Italians who simply view pirate IPTV via illicit subscriptions have been warned for months that their activities could be reported to the judicial authorities for potential prosecution. As part of an investigation into a pirate IPTV subscription seller, a total of 23 people have appeared in court in recent months for simply buying a pirate package. Judges in two separate proceedings have now acquitted all 23 after concluding that this type of piracy isn&#x27;t actually a crime.

The order was issued in response to a lawsuit filed by Netflix, Bell, and several major Hollywood studios alleging copyright infringement.  The operators of the associated Soap2Day domains must pay millions of Canadian dollars in damages.

It&#x27;s a free visual novel with a macabre puzzling element. The setup is that you&#x27;re a toy inspector working for a jovial Grand Toy Maker, his face hidden above the top of the screen. Your job is to disassemble toys - five in all - according to his eldritch written instructions, and either &quot;salvage&quot; them or &quot;sentence&quot; them to the incinerator.

If you missed the reveal, perhaps because you value sleep over the spectacle of Geoff Keighley&#x27;s fashion friends, let me catch you up: in Nightreign, you pick one of eight preset characters and explore a parallel-universe version of Elden Ring&#x27;s Limgrave map, fighting lesser foes and levelling up quickly so that you can battle a boss at the end of each 15-minute in-game day.

The wind outside is howling, and so are the nightwraiths, but you&#x27;re just sitting there. Playing another &quot;cow&quot; card. Okay.
Guess you&#x27;ll be happy to learn that the Witcher 4 developers have more or less confirmed that Gwent will be making a return in the recently trailered Ciri-led sequel.

                              <span>At 9 years old, in the plastic seats of a Sega Rally arcade machine, I quickly learned that &quot;automatic&quot; is better than &quot;manual&quot; without understanding why. And now I know: changing gears is a fucking chore. This year, in my mid-thirties, I finally learned to drive. And weirdly, a racing game about destroying clapped-out old bangers helped me along.

If you don&#x27;t have stockings, a fireplace, or a pen, rest easy. I&#x27;ve had a word with Santa&#x27;s elves, and they say it&#x27;s permissible to hang a trash bag by your George Foreman grill or local equivalent, and leave a comment on an RPS article instead. Wot you want for Wintermas, then? Extra trash bags? New George Foreman grill? Whatever it is, Santa will provide. If he doesn&#x27;t, I&#x27;ll feed him to the Maw.

                              <span>Crimson Desert first galloped onto the scene in 2020, with a bombastic trailer at Gamescom 2023 showcasing some particularly beautiful medieval open world action adventuring. It&#x27;s got horses, fishing, plate armour and roving heroism, but one thing it lacks is a release date. Now, thanks to The Geoff Awards, that&#x27;s changed! Well, sort of - Crimson Desert is out sometime in late 2025.

                              <span>Stealth launching a game during an awards ceremony is cool. But you know what&#x27;s cooler? Stealth launching a union. As many in the games industry settled in for an evening of advertisements and blockbuster backslapping, one group of US workers quietly succeeded in organising something of their own. Employees at Zenimax Online Studios launched their union with 461 members, as announced on social media site Bluesky last night.

Turok: Origins will revisit the dino-hunting archery of ye olde Nintendo 64, reimagining it as a story of three native huntsfolk out to lambast large lizards. The big new angle is that it&#x27;ll be a third-person shooter and you can play in online co-op as a team of T-rex wreckers. You then slurp up their dino DNA to upgrade your character. Come and watch these crimes against nature in the trailer below.

Turns out that unmistakable hint was mistakable. My mistake. At last night&#x27;s Game Awards we learned that the next fighter to come to the game will be... Clive? From Final Fantasy XVI? Sure. Why not.

Dispatch is a story-focused strategy game where you’ll play a broke superhero trying to get himself a new mech suit by working at a hero dispatch center. Having trouble tracking a trailer down for this one, but you can find it here on Steam.
Wait. I’ve found it! Leaving that last bit in though. Consider it my gift to you reader. The gift of visible workflow at 4am.

                              <span>Back in the mid &#x27;90s, I was hooked on an PC racing game called Screamer. It got a sequel a couple of years later, and then the series went dormant. Until now, when it&#x27;s seemingly returning as a foreboding, anime-infused racer about defying death, once again called simply Screamer. Huh! Huh. You&#x27;ll find a trailer below.

                              <span>The Geoffies have delivered us a first look at the gameplay for Obsidian’s spacefaring RPG sequel, The Outer Worlds 2. It looks, as you might expect, very much like the first one, but a bit nicer. The game itself was announced back in 2021, but we’ve seen nary a vaguely satirical sign nor very large gun since. Now we have both, plus some punching. Here’s that trailer.

It’s just been announced at Wrasslin&#x27; Geoff’s Winter Hootenanny, aka the Game Awards, and there’s a 10 day PC playtest underway right now. Here’s a trailer.

It’s another single player open world RPG, and The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt’s Ciri is the protagonist. In fact, she&#x27;s the protagonist for a whole new Witcher saga, though there’s a tease at the end of the footage that crusty old Geralt may return as well.

Warning: it has shiny rock people in it, the worst videogame enemy.

If, like me, you really enjoyed the French developers&#x27; previous martial art sims, you might, like me, find this news deflating. Football? We already have that at home. It&#x27;s like a martial art, but all you get to kick is some... ball.
I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll ever entirely swallow my disappointment, but credit where it&#x27;s due, Rematch does look like both an enjoyable game and a quietly disruptive one. It&#x27;s also struck a chord with me inasmuch as it&#x27;s a new way into the culture of a sport which I have pretty mixed feelings about.

                              <span>A master thief creeps over cobbles in an early modern metropolis that splits the difference between Edinburgh, Glasgow and Liverpool. Lit by gaslamps that can’t quite dispel the industrial haze, they pass for a civilian - a rough one, admittedly, but not shady enough to cause an itch in the swordarm of any passing guard.
Until, that is, they take to the thieves’ highway - following the trajectory of their grappling hook upward to the rooftops, from which they can see the shape of the city, and the moon beyond. Up here, it’s a parallel world - the trees on street level answered by chimney stacks, and the distant hills echoed by the rise and fall of steep gables. “We’re super proud of these rooftops,” says Greg LoPiccolo. “It’s an amazing landscape that we put a lot of thought and effort into, and it’s a lot of fun to traverse.”
Back in 1998, LoPiccolo was the game director who saw Thief: The Dark Project to completion. Today - after an 18 year detour to Harmonix to lead projects like Guitar Hero and Rock Band, among other adventures - he’s the game director of Thick as Thieves. “It really is an opportunity to do something unique and cool and new, on the shoulders of this stuff that is now well-respected,” he says. “Thief has some legs, right? People still talk about it to some degree.”

The trailer also treats us to a few snippets of the game&#x27;s story scenes, shoot-outs and punch-ups. We get to see wise guys swinging knives, riding horses and glowering silently at sun-baked Sicilian countryside.

                              <span>Tonight is The Game Awards 2024, the first since Geoff Keighley killed E3 and consumed its heart in front of a group of screaming schoolchildren. Just saying, this had better be good, Geoff, especially after the 2023 show’s &quot;embarrassing&quot; shooing-off of developers whose acceptance speeches cut into that valuable trailer showcase time.
Who will need to please wrap it up this time? Which games will be revealed? Will there be a musical number to top last year’s Herald of Darkness performance? (That was fun, actually, fair play on that one.) You can find out right along with us, as we once again fire up the RPS liveblog-o-tron to report all the developments as they happen. Even the ones that happen at 3:45am, when I’ll be desperately trying not to collapse into my keyboard like a felled tree.

                              <span>At first I thought Marvel Rivals was basically rebranded Overwatch, in the way it&#x27;s a free-to-play PVP hero shooter. And in some ways, it is. Fights are like if you took a MOBA and forced both teams to bash heads constantly. Success lies in picking off Spider-Man or Squirrel Girl or Marcus Fenix so as they wait to respawn, you hop on the big area that needs capturing. Or you push the cart while tanky Hulk absorbs bullets with his biceps and John Marvel snipes from afar.
The more I played Rivals, though, the more it hit me that it&#x27;s specifically a messier, more complex Overwatch. A hero shooter with a surprising amount of polish and charm, sure, but also one that slides off my brain like water off Birdman&#x27;s back. I understand why it&#x27;s supremely popular at the moment and yet, I really don&#x27;t.

I’ve engineered a Bloodsucker attack that wiped out the worst of villains – someone who was mean to me – and I’ve progressed far enough to really open up the map, and with it, access to more of the Zone’s fiercest fleshwarps.
Also, rats. Buoyed by the successful Bloodsucker siccing, I’m back on the trail of some mysterious anomaly scanners, and word is I might find a lead inside a local maze of wrecked cars. It’s heavily guarded by some gangster types, but for once, I won’t have to dash off in search of some far-off muties and coax them back here using my neck as bait. Mercifully, a gaggle of overgrown rodents are already hopping around right outside the labyrinth’s entrance. I beckon them in like a bouncer on his last day, then sprint past the stunned gunmen, who can barely shoulder their rifles before being set upon by a pack of giant carnivorous hamsters.

                              <span>In more ways than one, today’s Total War: Warhammer 3 expansion marks a milestone for game director Rich Aldridge and his team at Creative Assembly. Omens Of Destruction’s three headline legendary lords each bring new campaigns and units for their respective factions, but it’s the fourth lord - a Khorne champion free to all players - that I imagine Aldridge will end up remembering the most fondly.
When Total War: Warhammer released back in 2016, it shipped with eight legendary lords - famous characters from Games Workshop’s fantasy setting that here act as faction leaders. The number grew steadily and, in terms of announcement order at least, today’s addition of Arbaal The Undefeated marks the series’ 100th. That&#x27;s a hundred campaigns, a hundred joint efforts of game design, animation, art, writing and voice work.
Aldridge has never been shy about the team’s ambition for the series to eventually offer up each unit from every Fantasy Battle 6th edition army book (&quot;The goal is to do everything, right?&quot;). But ambition is one thing, and considering the fraught conditions at Creative Assembly and parent company Sega over the past few years, it’s not just the addition of the 100th lord that feels like something to celebrate. It’s taken time, effort, and a siesmic shift in update frequency, but Total War: Warhammer III is in the best place it&#x27;s ever been.

                              <span>If Space Marine 2&#x27;s wanton devil-mulching left you hungry for more fantastical depictions of medieval zealotry, maybe take a look at Band Of Crusaders, an open-world party-based RPG in which you are the Grandmaster of a knightly order, trying to keep a bunch of wily Archdemons out of Europe. It seems to play a bit like XCOM, with an oppressive world map that is slowly encroached upon as you travel around recruiting soldiers, interacting with settlements, and picking real-time fights with hellfiends &quot;inspired by biblical descriptions and European folklore&quot;. Naturally, parallels with real-life xenophobia and sectarian hatred abound. Here&#x27;s the trailer.

                              <span>If your PC has ever started randomly roaring, and you check Steam only to find Space Marine 2 is panic-installing a 9 billion gigabyte update, then perhaps Valve&#x27;s new upcoming feature is for you. For most of us, Steam simply slurps down fresh gigs of installed games automatically when a new update is released (and sometimes schedules the updates according to its own capricious whims). But the platform is testing a new option in the beta client, which lets you set download behaviour to git new gigs only when you actually launch a game. This would be a terrible curse, for reasons I will explain, but it&#x27;s only going to be an option - not the new default.

                              <span>Creation is an act of kindness. One person sloughs off a piece of themselves, shapes it, wraps it, and sends it out into the world in the hope that it might mean something to someone else. Other people do this for us all the time and mostly we don&#x27;t even notice. The work is unseen and unremarked upon even as, through repetition, we come to depend upon it. Until, one day, that light that they shine can&#x27;t be seen. Maybe you left home, or maybe they did, but now it&#x27;s your turn to perform such acts of kindness. To carry the tradition forward for others - and for yourself.

Friends, it&#x27;s time to play Skeal.

Daft Punk ho oslovili proto, že na jeho seriálech vyrůstali, takže výsledné dílo, včetně &quot;jednodušší&quot; retro animace a naivní zápletky zcela záměrně připomíná staré japonské televizní počiny (n…</span>
