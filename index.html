                              <span>Another &quot;polished&quot; first-party release.
This week marks the release of Splatoon 3 on the Nintendo Switch. So far there&#x27;s been our own Nintendo Life review, as a well as a round-up of impressions, and now we&#x27;ve got technical analysis from John Linneman of Digital Foundry. So, how does the third game hold up on Switch?
Jumping right into it - the game uses dynamic resolution scaling and AMD&#x27;s fidelity effects FSR 1.0, and typically runs at 1920 x 1080 in docked, with it dropping to around 820p at its lowest. In portable mode, it maxes out at 720p with DRS dropping to about 75% of that.

Since the original Splatoon game, amiibo functionality has been supported. This feature returns in Splatoon 3, so what kind of unlocks can amiibo collector&#x27;s expect?
Destructoid has put together a list of all the unlocks. To activate your amiibo in Splatoon 3, you&#x27;ll need to find the amiibo stand in Splatsville. From there you scan your amiibo on your Switch controller, the amiibo will appear in game and you&#x27;ll receive an unlock. If you haven&#x27;t registered the amiibo yet, you&#x27;ll also need to go through that process.

A few other newer titles we&#x27;re sure many fighting fans would love to see make the leap across to Nintendo&#x27;s hybrid system include The King of Fighters XIV and The King of Fighters XV by SNK. The Japanese company has mentioned the possibility of it in the past but now seems to have retracted its previous statement due to &quot;the hardware specs and the technical limitations of the Switch&quot;.

                              <span>In 2000, a game called Boku no Natsuyasumi (“My Summer Vacation”) was released on the PlayStation. As the name suggests, it was about being a kid on summer vacation, and its slow pace and cruisy setting made it something of a cult classic, though one that sadly never saw an official English-language release.

                              <span>Id Software is making sure you can play the classics
Yes, Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory is getting some new servers in the year 2022. As more players are hopping on thanks to its free availability, id Software has deployed dedicated servers with a classic ruleset for players to run.
Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory was made available on Steam earlier this year, as part of the Bethesda launcher going away. And it&#x27;s also free on the Microsoft Store, too.
With the new platform and popularity likely comes players wanting to either experience the game properly, or rekindle their old memories. And so id Software has announced that it&#x27;s deployed some official dedicated servers for Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory, to facilitate all the nostalgic carnage.

These servers are running the vanilla Enemy Territory Campaign ruleset, with all six original maps and no mods. While id says there are servers with a variety of mods and custom maps that it highly recommends, some folks want to play the classics.
The classic, vanilla dedicated servers are set up across multiple regions, so players around the world can hop in. Four official servers have been deployed: Texas, the Netherlands, Canberra, and London.
All servers will even have a message of the day, saying the following:
&quot;Official &amp; Vanilla Servers hosted by id Software. Enjoy! These servers are unmoderated. For issues, help.bethesda.net&quot;

Back to the past
It&#x27;s really cool to see id Software supporting renewed interest in an older game like this. Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory was a bit of an outlier, from what I remember of its launch. Its class system and in-match experience might not seem strange now, but it was a cool take when it launched in 2003.

Awesome Games Done Quick will be back in 2023, to host another speedrunning charity event. But unlike the most recent SGDQ, it won&#x27;t be an in-person event.
Games Done Quick has confirmed that its 2023 AGDQ event will be hosted online, on January 8 through 15. While organizers state they would like to return to in-person, they have determined that &quot;to provide a safe and welcoming event to all&quot; it was best to move away from its originally planned location in Florida.
In a thread detailing the decision, Games Done Quick cites the state&#x27;s &quot;continued disregard&quot; for COVID-19 dangers, including anti-mandate policies. They also note increased aggression towards LGBTQ+ individuals, including the &quot;Don&#x27;t Sa…</span>

                              <span>No more Deltarune until 2023
As a veteran of internet culture and creative, interactive storytelling, Toby Fox has been revered for years now as the creator modern classic game Undertale, as well as his newest game Deltarune. The first two chapters of Deltarune were released back in October 2018 and February 2019 respectively, so it&#x27;s been quite a while since fans have seen an update on the game. This week, however, Fox took to Twitter to provide a much-needed Deltarune update.
&quot;We don&#x27;t be able to put out any new chapters of DELTARUNE this year,&quot; Fox said. Well, at least he&#x27;s straightforward. Then he teases &quot;something special&quot; coming up to celebrate the anniversary of Undertale and Deltarune Chapter 2, so there&#x27;s something coming relatively soon.
We&#x27;ll just have to hold out a bit longer. For what it&#x27;s worth, you can&#x27;t really blame Fox for taking his time considering he&#x27;s pretty much the only one who works on these games. Making a game at all is an impressive enough feat, let alone doing all the coding, art, music, and so on completely by yourself.

In the meantime, though you can get your next fix of Undertale at an awesome pop-up event — so long as you live in Southern California, anyway.
From September 15 through October 10, Requiem Café in Anaheim will be hosting an event in honor of Undertale&#x27;s seventh anniversary, which includes special themed food and drink items like colorful macarons and milk tea, as well as exclusive merchandise like shirts, mugs, tote bags, and more. The café is not taking any reservations for the event, but walk-ins are of course welcome.
If nothing else, a delicious peach tea with strawberry and spicy mango and some chocolate blood orange donuts will be enough to get me by. Make sure to check out the menu, because it all looks amazing.

Not gonna lie, I’m partial to a gimmicky video game experience. Whether it’s VR, huge arcade-style cabinets, or a giant chunky plastic peripheral you have to buy for your controller, I’m fascinated by it all. I’ve even followed the niche community of streamers who make unconventional controllers, like one player who’s been grooving her way through Elden Ring on a dance pad controller.
As hardware continues to improve, it’s cool to see how we can innovate on using the physical components we interact with to further immerse us in a game’s world. Of this ninth console generation, we’ve seen PlayStation take some impressive steps forward in this regard. Putting aside what I think about the new Last of Us remake, I have to admit that using the controller’s haptic fee…</span>

Potionomics is getting ready to open up shop. The shop management sim from developer Voracious Games and XSEED hits PC via Steam on October 17.
In the fantasy world of Potionomics, the story follows Sylvia, an eager upstart who has taken over a potion shop after her uncle has disappeared. Despite very little knowledge in the way of potion making and selling, Sylvia has to keep the shop afloat amid stiff competition.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;X6YDmnRZMYY
The loop of Potionomics runs through a few different genres. There&#x27;s the store management aspect, where Sylvia can put out new products and upgrade the store to better serve customers. Then there&#x27;s brewing potions, and trying to keep up with needs.
Once a customer wants to buy something, it turns into a card-based duel where Sylvia&#x27;s ability to haggle turns into a Slay the Spire-style encounter. And there are social links with the townsfolk, which given one moment in the trailer, could possibly bloom into romance.

A pinch of this, a sprinkle of that
Potionomics has a lot going on, but in the demo I played at PAX East, it really managed it all well. Every system fed into the other, and the feeling of setting potions to brew, opening shop, haggling for profit, and conversing with others felt smooth.
It&#x27;s why Voracious Games&#x27; store management sim has been on my radar since PAX. And luckily, the wait&#x27;s not long now for the final game. Though the regular game will be on Steam for $24.99, XSEED is also releasing a Deluxe Edition that will have a digital artbook and soundtrack for $39.99. And sorry, no haggling those down, aside from a brief launch window discount.

A demo is also on the way for the upcoming Steam Next Fest, so players can check it out before release. Either way, I&#x27;m ready to brew some potions and move some merchandise.

Paris. 1789. The Renaissance was so very long ago... Did it even happen?
Looking around the fallen capital, one would fairly assume not. The City of Lights, a place celebrated for its art, invention, culture, and architecture now resembles The Gates of Hell, a vision soon to be crafted by Rodin himself. The streets are awash with blood and bodies — innocent civilians, rebellious conspirators, and even the king&#x27;s own army lying in miserable piles of broken flesh.
And the king himself? This citywide massacre is his doing, the heart of his capital torn in two by a seemingly unstoppable army of robotic soldiers. Far from being the loyal guardians and entertainers of Paris, as initially designed, the automaton army has instead become her oppressor, stal…</span>

The PlayStation Store has been cluttered with extremely bizarre and lackluster games for a while now. However, what was bad just seems to be getting worse. A handful of indie developers are gaming the system by re-releasing essentially the same game over and over — offering a new Platinum trophy with every “game.” These titles provide nothing of value and only seem to dampen everything around them.
Games like The Jumping Fries, The Jumping Fries Turbo, and dozens more like it are crowding the PSN storefront, making it harder for customers to find what they want. Not only that but actual hardworking indie devs are being lost in the shuffle of these crappy titles, forcefully pushed down the list of New Releases, which is PSN’s only real visibility too…</span>

CD Projekt Red officially revealed Phantom Liberty, its first major expansion for Cyberpunk 2077, this week. And it looks like it will be the only one.
In a YouTube comments section, as spotted by sites like XGP, the official Cyberpunk 2077 account responded to a hopeful comment about further expansions beyond Phantom Liberty. The account expressed gratitude but said that Phantom Liberty is the &quot;only planned expansion&quot; for Cyberpunk 2077.
Following up on that, Polygon received comment from CD Projekt Red&#x27;s global PR director Radek Grabowski. He confirms that Phantom Liberty is &quot;the only planned expansion&quot; for Cyberpunk 2077, and there are &quot;no plans for more expansions beyond that.&quot;

                              <span>A fancier controller that&#x27;s a little easier on the budget
Xbox is adding a new variant to its line of Elite Series 2 controllers. For those looking for something a bit more straightforward and a little cheaper, the Xbox Elite Series 2 Core controller is on its way.
The Elite Series 2 has been popular, alongside its predecessor. But at $179.99 MSRP, it is also a bit hefty in the price tag. That&#x27;s where the Core comes in.
The new Xbox Elite Series 2 Core controller has the &quot;essential&quot; components of an Elite Series 2, with fewer bells and whistles. There&#x27;s still adjustable tension on the thumbsticks, a rubberized grip, and hair trigger locks. Button remapping is also fully available through the Xbox Accessories app. And it comes in at $129.99 MSRP, a full $50 cheaper.

                              <span>From ONE OK ROCK
A new Sonic Frontiers song has appeared, this time it&#x27;s one of Sega&#x27;s signature vocal-heavy Sonic songs. From the Japanese rock band ONE OK ROCK, it&#x27;s titled &quot;Vandalize,&quot; and will serve as the ending theme of the game.
Here&#x27;s what ONE OK ROCK&#x27;s lead vocalist (Takahiro Moriuchi, also known as &quot;Taka&quot;) had to say about the collaboration:
&quot;We partnered with Sega on Sonic Frontiers because we relate to Sonic and how he’s taken on the world after getting his start in Japan. We are based in the US and have performed in Europe, Asia and South America, so we are extremely happy to be able to work with the world-renowned Sonic.”

You can watch the preview clip below via Sega with in-game footage, or listen to the song directly through the band&#x27;s YouTube channel. The timing is perfect for ONE OK ROCK, as they&#x27;re currently touring the US right now, and their new album is out on Friday.
I&#x27;m in it! This is one of the cleaner, best-foot-forward showings of the Sonic Frontiers marketing campaign so far. If they led with this and the Cyber Space footage, I think the reaction would have been completely different.

                              <span>Family Fortunes
Tencent, continuing to expand its presence in the global gaming industry, has increased its stake in French publisher Ubisoft via a new partnership with Guillemot Brothers Limited (GBL).
As the name suggests, GBL is an enterprise made up of Ubisoft&#x27;s founding family, which holds in the region of 13% of Ubisoft stock. Tencent will invest €300 million ($297 million USD) into GBL, for a huge 49.7% share in the family business. In addition, Tencent will give GBL a long-term loan in order to purchase more stake in Ubisoft. And thus, by proxy, Tencent owns almost half of GBL stock, while GBL now has the cash to purchase up to 29.9% of Ubisoft stock, complete with voting rights.
Rumors have persisted for some time that Ubisoft was looking for a buyer, and that the Guillemot family…</span>

Another piece of Vanillaware&#x27;s back catalog is heading to modern consoles. Today, NIS America announced that GrimGrimoire OnceMore is coming to the Nintendo Switch, PS4, and PS5 in spring 2023.
Announced during today&#x27;s NIS America showcase, the stream closed out with news of GrimGrimoire getting an official English localization. While it released in Japan earlier this year, NIS America will also bring the updated GrimGrimoire over to North American players.

GrimGrimoire OnceMore is an updated version of the original GrimGrimoire, a 2007 PlayStation 2 game developed by Vanillaware and Nippon Ichi Software. Much like Vanillaware&#x27;s other PS2 classic Odin Sphere got an update with Leifthrasir, OnceMore is a r…</span>

The new Xenoblade Chronicles 3 patch is live (version 1.1.1), and the entire focus of it involves some bugged quests. While we wait for the English patch site to catch up, the Japanese site has the full details.
There&#x27;s two big fixes here that fans have been asking about since launch. So one of the quests (the Mysterious Raider in Severed Connection) actually deals with one of the lengthiest and well-hidden questlines in the game, which you can dig into with more detail here.
Another one involves a food-related bug. So in certain circumstances, some food effects (which buff the party/player and provide bonuses, like extra XP) didn&#x27;t apply correctly. Now, as of version 1.1.1, they should work. The team even has a retroactive fix for the talent arts button, …</span>

Sony Interactive Entertainment has released a new update for the cream dream that is the PS5 — Version *checks note* 22.02-06.00.00 brings with it new resolution options, social activities, along with the long-requested Game Lists feature, which finally makes its grand return.
If your display/monitor supports 1440p, then you&#x27;ll be pleased to hear that the PS5 can now output in this native resolution. Additionally, a Screen Share option will allow players in parties to watch each other&#x27;s embarrassing performances, while a cute sticker system allows you to send small icons and images to your friends via Game Base. Send me some stickers. In addition, the DualSense has had a minor tweak for stability, while Voice Command (in English) has been added to the YouTube app.
The Game List feature allows players to sort their games into folders, allowing you to group titles by genre, franchise, developer, or whether Juri is in them. PS5 users can have up to 15 lists in total, each of which can hold up to 100 games each — which is pretty funny once you consider a PS5&#x27;s SSD is full to capacity once you add three games and six screenshots — or just one Call of Duty title.
The Version 22.02-06.00.00 update is now live on PS5. For full details on all of the included features and tweaks, visit the official patch notes over on PlayStation Blog.

I knew these figures would come in handy, here&#x27;s the Splatoon 3 amiibo unlock list!

What amiibo do in Splatoon 3
So the amiibo functionality is very straight-forward in Splatoon 3, as it has been in the past. All you have to do is turn around when zoning into the main hub city: you&#x27;ll see an action figure-like amiibo stand. Interact with it, and the game will ask you to scan an amiibo figure. Scanning a Splatoon amiibo (full list below) will bring that character into the game world momentarily.
If that figure isn&#x27;t registered or is registered to a new game, you&#x27;ll need to go through the process to link it to Splatoon 3 (which usually just includes a few quick taps). In addition to proving cosmetic rewards (which range from sho…</span>

                              <span>Hoy there, small fry!
I remember when I first previewed the original Splatoon at Nintendo headquarters many years ago, and it felt like it was the beginning of something special. How special? Well, a lot of people probably didn&#x27;t predict that it would still be around seven years later, with Splatoon 3 keeping the spirit alive.
Thus far with a limited sample size, this has been a series of incremental changes, to be sure. But if Splatoon 4 rolls around, there&#x27;s less that needs to be done compared to what we got with Splatoon 2.

Splatoon 3 (Nintendo Switch)

                              <span>It&#x27;s out on November 4
Alongside of the new trailer, Nintendo has revealed a Pokemon Scarlet and Violet OLED model, which is set to debut on November 4.
Right now information is slim, but the trailer did provide a full look at the system, including the dock, which will be emblazoned with images of legendary Pokemon Koraidon &amp; Miraidon. The back will feature a colorful interpretation of the starter Pokemon, while the Joy-Con sport a scarlet and violet scheme, with the logos for each game [the school logos for the Naranja and Uva academies] on their respective controllers. Nintendo has confirmed to Destructoid that it will feature 64GB of internal storage, and will MSRP at $359.99.
A new piece of special edition hardware is customary for most major mainline Pokemon releases, so this was expected at some point: but maybe not as a shadow drop during a non-livestream trailer event. Also note that the special OLED is coming on November 4, which is a full two weeks before the launch of the pair of games on November 18. You can find a full gallery of all the shots below.
It&#x27;s also important to remember that Nintendo also released a Splatoon 3 OLED model this year. It came out on August 26, and is currently going for upwards of $400+ on the secondary market (the MSRP was $359.99).

As promised, the latest Pokemon trailer is live, and it deals with Pokemon Scarlet and Violet treasure hunting: a thematic aspect of the upcoming generation.

In this voice-overview-less trailer, we get to see how some of the overarching factions will play out, and we get a brief overview of a few gym leaders, as well as some upcoming creatures. According to Game Freak, &quot;in Pokemon Scarlet and Pokemon Violet, the school you’ve enrolled in hosts a special independent study project. The theme of this assignment is a treasure hunt.&quot;
According to the trailer, Pokemon Scarlet and Violet treasure hunting is a &quot;huge part of the [Naranja/Uva] Academy school year,&quot; but you&#x27;ll have to face off a…</span>

                              <span>He&#x27;s your worst nightmare
Tomorrow sees the next pop culture superstar join the roster of Warner Bros. Games&#x27; MultiVersus. The popular crossover fighter will welcome the mischievous Mogwai Gizmo to its ranks, joining a star-studded crossover cast including characters from Game of Thrones, DC Comics, Steven Universe, and more.
While developer Player First Games is yet to release an official gameplay trailer for the gremlin, it has revealed Gizmo&#x27;s gameplay card, which reveals that the Mogwai is a Support class character with an array of moves to attack his foes and aid his partners. Gizmo will come equipped with his Rambo-style &quot;Hunter&#x27;s Bow&quot;, as seen in the climax of 1990 sequel Gremlins 2: The New Batch. This tool will allow Gizmo to fire projectiles at the opposing team, and it can even be charged for full, flaming Tippex glory.

A support move, &quot;Song of the Mogwai&quot;, will see Gizmo hum his famous little tune from the Gremlins movies, this move will cause the spawning of music notes, which apparently cause harm to his opponents — pretty bizarre given the adorable nature of the critter&#x27;s singing. Perhaps Gizmo&#x27;s most useful tool, &quot;Gizmo-a-Go-Go&quot;, sees him leap onto his partner, piggyback-style, wherein he will instantly remove any debuffs or negative status that has been applied to his teammate. While hitching a ride, Gizmo can continue to fire his arrows at his opposition... I&#x27;ve said &quot;opposition&quot; a lot, because Gizmo has no enemies.
Gizmo will arrive in MultiVersus tomorrow, September 8, as the second DLC character of season one, (following Morty of Rick &amp; Morty fame). The remainder of the season will see Rick, DC Comic&#x27;s Black Adam, and Gizmo&#x27;s arch nemesis, Stripe, also join the fray... Huh, I guess he does have enemies.
MultiVersus is available now in open beta on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

Right now the Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak amiibo hunt continues to be a mystery in the US, with no retailer sightings beyond the collector&#x27;s edition: which comes with the lone Malzeno figure.
The others (the Canyne Malzeno Palamute and the Felyne Malzeno Palico) are nowhere to be found in the region.
Here&#x27;s a quick recap of how the Sunbreak amiibo situation is going worldwide:
You can pre-order them now on Play-Asia or Amazon Japan, but they&#x27;ll be shipping in late September/August depending on the retailer: some users are reporting that Play-Asia is canceling select pre-orders
Some UK/EU regions are reporting that they are available at retail, and are all out now with the releas…</span>

                              <span>We don&#x27;t want it, 2K
Fifteen years later, BioShock remains one of the most recognizable and beloved series in gaming, and publisher 2K is still releasing updates to support the series. Or, more specifically, to make the games run through their own launcher, as evidenced by the patch notes from both older updates and a new one (via PC Gamer). This time around they even labeled the patch as a &quot;Quality of Life Update,&quot; when all it did was enable linking to 2K accounts and added the new launcher &quot;which includes a store to purchase new content.&quot;
So they&#x27;re forcing yet another game launcher on us, but what really has fans peeved is that this new update has rendered the games unplayable for players running them on Linux. At first, it seemed to just be BioShock Infinite that was affected, but now it&#x27;s looking like the entire series is a bust. The Linux Gaming subreddit is full of players decrying the changes, and trying to find solutions to fix the problem. Some players are expressing their wish that Steam would let them access earlier builds rather than forcing them to use the most recent version, and I&#x27;m kind of surprised that wasn&#x27;t an option already.

Naturally, fans took to the review section on Steam to voice their discontent, where one user said that 2K&#x27;s launcher is riddled with bugs, crashes, and corrupted saves.
I have my BioShock collection on my PlayStation so I&#x27;m in the clear, but man, I am feeling the frustration on behalf of PC gamers. Here&#x27;s hoping that 2K gets the message soon and decides to scrap the launcher altogether, or at the very least releases a patch to fix the games for Linux users.
Recently I&#x27;ve been partial to arguments about why it&#x27;s important to own physical media, and I have to say this situation is only pushing me further into that camp. If I spent money on a game, I certainly want to be able to play it without the meddling of a company years after the game&#x27;s release.

Welcome back! It is a new Tuesday, which means tonight there will be a new episode of Spot Dodge: A Live Nintendo Podcast exclusively on Destructoid. Topics: Tonight, we’re discussing the rumors surrounding Zelda: Twilight Princess and The Wind Waker finally making it to Nintendo Switch. Aside from that, we speculate more on Breath of the Wild 2 and if the Zelda IP is about to make a big splash on Switch in the next year.
Jeff Grubb recently stated on his Nintendo podcast that a source told him Nintendo is planning a Direct during the week of Sep 12. He also mentioned the very high likelihood of Wind Waker and Twilight Princess being announced for Nintendo Switch during the showcase. I think these ports are long over…</span>

                              <span>Ubisoft is turning up the AC for this Forward
Ubisoft is set to discuss what&#x27;s on the horizon this weekend, during its Ubisoft Forward stream. And several reports say that a healthy amount of Assassin&#x27;s Creed will be there.
Bloomberg reports today, confirming other reports, that Ubisoft is set to announce several new Assassin&#x27;s Creed games this coming Saturday.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;L0Fr3cS3MtY
According to Bloomberg&#x27;s sources, Ubisoft plans to show off a mobile title and two major games. The first is code-named Red and set in Japan, being developed by Ubisoft&#x27;s Quebec City office.
The second is code-named Neo or Hexe, according to Bloomberg, and is set during the later Holy Roman Empire, specifically revolving around the witch trials. This is being developed by Ubisoft Montreal.
Both of these are reportedly part of Assassin&#x27;s Creed Infinity, a platform for the series that will contain multiple settings that has been previously reported on. Neither game is expected to release until 2024 at the earliest.
The future of Assassin&#x27;s Creed
Ubisoft has already confirmed it plans to showcase Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage as well. Though it hasn&#x27;t revealed further official details about that game, it has been the subject of leaks and reports as well.

Suffice it to say, we&#x27;ll likely be seeing a lot of Assassin&#x27;s Creed this weekend. And while it might not be everyone&#x27;s cup of tea, I&#x27;m actually pretty interested in all of this.
Assassin&#x27;s Creed taking a platform approach could be interesting. I enjoy the more recent games in the series but never got around to finishing Valhalla due to how huge it was. Focused experiences with a bunch of different time periods could be intriguing.
Either way, it won&#x27;t be long until we know for sure. Ubisoft is airing its Forward stream this Saturday, at 12:00 p.m. PT / 3:00 p.m. ET. You can watch it on Ubisoft&#x27;s Twitch channel here.

                              <span>Microsoft announced in January that it was moving to acquire Activision Blizzard for a colossal $68.7 billion, making it far and away the most expensive acquisition in gaming history. Now, of course, regulators like the U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority and the U.S.’ FTC must approve of this, and those investigations are ongoing. But suppose all goes according to Microsoft’s plan. In that case, the company will own Activision Blizzard, the publisher and developer behind Call of Duty, Overwatch, World of Warcraft, and more, by the spring or summer of 2023. 
Shortly after the company announced its plans to acquire Activision Blizzard, Xbox head Phil Spencer confirmed his company’s intent “to keep Call of Duty on PlayStation” following the purchase. He reaffirmed this commitment earlie…</span>

                              <span>Before Vanillaware made its name with titles like 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim and Dragon’s Crown, it found early success with a little game called GrimGrimoire. The side-scrolling strategy title garnered a cult following when it hit the PlayStation 2 in 2007, but it got another shot in the spotlight this year with the Japanese launch of GrimGrimoire OnceMore in July. Now we know when players in the U.S. and Europe get to experience Lillet’s spellbinding adventure again or for the first time. 
GrimGrimoire OnceMore comes to the west in Spring 2023 for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and Switch. The game stars Lillet Blan, a witch-in-training who attends the famed Tower of Silver Star magic school, where things have gone awry. It’s up to her to uncover its dark secrets in an adventure that unfolds over a repeating five-day cycle. Though a side-scroller, players battle enemies by summoning and commanding Familiars in real-time strategy battles that unfold in a 2D perspective. 
OnceMore features HD graphics, a new skill tree, an improved user interface, an art gallery, and other unspecified features. 


Fans may remember Odin Sphere making a similar comeback in 2016 with the Leifthrasir edition, and it’s cool to see GrimGrimoire get the same treatment. Are you excited to replay GrimGrimoire? Will this be your first time giving it a try? Let us know in the comments!</span>

Since its debut in 2015, the Splatoon series has delivered unique, colorful gameplay cribbed by scarce launch content and disappointing time restrictions for specific modes. While post-launch content greatly bolstered both games to this point, I’ve always been disappointed by how little was initially on offer. Now on its third entry, the series may feel a bit less fresh, but Splatoon 3 remedies the series’ long-standing launch content woes while retaining all the fun that made the series such a success.

                              <span>Gotham Knights pits a dysfunctional Bat Family against a litany of their greatest foes, but one of the biggest conflicts the group must confront comes from within. How did Warner Bros. Montreal adapt and reimagine these characters to keep them true to their comic origins while still surprising players? A new video breaks down its storytelling process. 
The development team explains the narrative&#x27;s themes of trauma, loss, chosen family, and how it uses the Knights&#x27; long, complicated relationships to make each hero feel fully realized as individuals and as a family. WB Montreal also discusses Alfred&#x27;s pivotal role as a father figure to the team, the social moments that unfold in the Belfrey hideout, and its approach to cinematic design. 


Gotham Knights launches on October 21 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. You can see more on the game by checking out the Gamescom trailer spotlighting the villains players will battle.</span>

After releasing a trailer focused on the competitive play of these upcoming pocket monster games, The Pokémon Company is showing off the wonders of the Paldea region and the treasures that await. The video also features a look at some of the rebellious classmates in the game as well as some of its gym leaders. 
Check it out for yourself below: 


As you can see, the trailer begins by introducing us to Starfall Street, which is where you&#x27;ll be able to face off against unruly students. Those youths are likely a part of Team Star, the local school troublemakers. This team seems to be categorized by type because as the trailer progresses, we meet Mela, the bos…</span>

                              <span>PlayStation told players in 2020 that it could add 1440p support for game resolution output to PlayStation 5 “if requested enough.” It seems that happened because it’s now available in a new update. 
With the launch of today’s new global PS5 system software update, not only is 1440p resolution available for applicable TVs and monitors, but Gamelists and other anticipated social features are too. There’s also a new audio comparison option to listen to the difference between stereo output and 3D audio in headsets and a new YouTube voice command preview. 
“The update includes several highly-requested features like 1440p HDMI video output and gamelists, as well as social features like the ability to request a Share Screen from a fellow party member, easily view new friends’ profiles, and receive a notification to help you join a friend’s game more quickly from a party chat,” platform experience senior vice president Hideaki Nishino writes in a new PlayStation blog post. “Additionally, you can now compare 3D audio and stereo audio on the same screen and more easily access in-progress Activities from game hubs.” 
For more information about these new features, head to this breakdown here. 
This system software update will allow players in the U.S. and U.K. to preview the ability to search YouTube through voice command. 
“Another feature we’re excited to bring to more PS5 players is the ability to search for content on YouTube through Voice Command (Preview),” the blog reads. “From anywhere on PS5, including during gameplay, you can say ‘Hey PlayStation, find [keyword] on YouTube.’ The YouTube app will open, and relevant search results will be shown.”

                              <span>Time was clearly of the essence.
After drip-feeding us Pokemon Scarlet and Violet reveals for the past few months, today saw the release of the newest ScarVi trailer (yes, that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re calling it, sometimes in our best pirate voice), which promised to be packed full of new information to get us pumped and ready to explore Paldea.
While it certainly stuffed a lot in, we couldn&#x27;t help but feel a bit like we were watching a person speak with their mouth full for three minutes. We finished the trailer feeling a little less AH! and a little more EH?

Nintendo has kicked off another round of &#x27;Ask the Developer&#x27;, a series in which key members of a game&#x27;s development team dive into the creative process behind some of Nintendo&#x27;s biggest Switch games. This time, of course, we&#x27;re looking at Splatoon 3, which is due to release later this week. You can read the full interview with the game&#x27;s developers right here.
In discussing how the series has grown with its audience and how Nintendo landed on the creative direction for Splatoon 3, game director Seita Inoue revealed a rather surprising source of inspiration for the game: Splatoon 2&#x27;s final Splatfest event, Chaos vs. Order (yes, we know it wasn&#x27;t the final final one..!).

There was a whole lot of new information for us in the Pokémon Scarlet and Violet trailer including new monsters, villains and pathways; though one feature that was hardly touched on was the games&#x27; newest exploration feature: &#x27;Let&#x27;s Go!&#x27;

With a new Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet trailer dropping earlier today, we were expecting to see a couple of new Pokémon amidst the fields. And we did indeed, even if it was only brief and we didn&#x27;t get time to get to know them! But don&#x27;t worry, we spotted you.
First up is the most obvious one, and the star of the &#x27;Path of Legends&#x27; story, Klawf. It&#x27;s a Rock-type crab — and a fairly big crab, at that. Known as the Ambush Pokémon, it&#x27;s said to have very strong claws that can hold an enemy in one place.

Lovers of small animals exploring towns at night are having a great time this summer, as The Spirit and the Mouse follows hot on the tail of Stray, a game about a cat (shouldn&#x27;t it be the other way around?).
Made by a tiny indie studio based in Montreal, Canada, The Spirit and the Mouse is an adventure game that features Lila (a mouse) and Lumion (a spirit), an unlikely team that have to work together to restore power to their village. The game is full of electricity-based puzzles and friendship-based storytelling, and promises to be a heartwarming experience. And if this all sounds a little familiar, it might be because we featured the game in our Nintendo Life Indie Spotlight back in April.

During the new trailer for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, it was revealed that the games will once again feature a new villainous team in the form of &#x27;Team Star&#x27;, which consists of the in-game schools&#x27; &quot;most rebellious students&quot; and will be made up of several squads.
Each squad will be headed up by a unique boss character, with the team&#x27;s bases dotted around the game&#x27;s Paldea region, so it&#x27;ll be up to you to determine which one you tackle first. As you head into the bases, Team Star will send out a barrage of Pokémon to stop you in your tracks, but you&#x27;ll be able to make use of the game&#x27;s new auto-battling system to dispatch these and head to the big honcho.

After much mystery surrounding Pokémon Scarlet and Violet&#x27;s multi-path possibilities, today&#x27;s trailer has shed some light on the story elements that we can expect to find in the game and revealed that the three different paths are just that: different paths.
The Paldea region will not be governed by the strict movement from Gym A to Gym B, with the trailer giving us a taste of what the three storylines will entail.

When the original Splatoon launched on the Wii U back in 2015, it was pretty groundbreaking. Nintendo making an online shooter? It sounded like a recipe for confusion, but as they so often do, Nintendo took a formula that had been refined to the point of parody and decided that it would be fun to be able to swim in bullets. Then they made the bullets ink and everything came together.
Splatoon 2 took this bullet breaststroke formula after just a few years and souped it up for the Nintendo Switch. It was an upgrade in every sense, but now we’re reaching the big number 3. So what are we looking at here? The Halo 3, or the Driver 3 of the Splatoon series?

The dock itself is white in colour and will feature the two new legendary Pokémon, Koraidon and Miraidon.

We know that the Nintendo Switch pretty much dominates game and hardware sales most of the time — but what about when we compare it to other physical media?
Well, it turns out — in the UK, at least — that not only is the Switch the most profitable gaming &#x27;format&#x27; in the country, but it&#x27;s also even more popular than other media and entertainment. GamesIndustry.biz&#x27;s Chris Dring has shared sales figures (from ERA and GfK) on Twitter that shed light on just how well the Switch has sold, in terms of revenue, compared to vinyl, CDs, DVDs, and Blu-ray.

Remember game magazines? Remember how awesome they were? Yes, a few of them are still knocking about to this day; in the UK, we&#x27;ve got the likes of Edge, Wireframe, Retro Gamer, and Switch Player to name but a few, but for those who grew up in the &#x27;80s, &#x27;90s, and &#x27;00s, magazines like NGamer, CVG, and Mean Machines were the absolute bee&#x27;s knees.
One thing they all had in common was their memorable video game ads. Often printed over one or two-page spreads, these didn&#x27;t simply showcase a bunch of key art and be done with it; no, they were creative and often hilarious. Some had a kind of quirky &quot;DIY&quot; element to them, with sellotape used to stick various images on top of one another to create a mock-up of what a certain game might look like.

                              <span>&quot;Don&#x27;t just make a tree and be done with it&quot;.
Over the past few weeks, veteran game developer Masahiro Sakurai has been posting videos to his YouTube channel &#x27;Masahiro Sakurai on Creating Games&#x27;, detailing various aspects of game development and how aspiring creators can apply it to their own work (don&#x27;t worry though, we won&#x27;t be covering all of them here!).
In his latest piece, Sakurai goes into how to effectively create in-game assets, using light to add depth to objects to really bring them to life. Interestingly, the key object that Sakurai focuses on for this demonstration is a tree, and he clearly showcases how varying colour hues, light sources, and atmospheric elements can elevate a tree from being a basic cut-and-paste object into something far more tangible and real. He ends this explanation by stating the following:

PAX West 2022 hosted the first ever Splatoon 3 invitational tournament earlier this week, where some of the best players from around the world came together to shoot, slosh, splat and roll their way to victory. As the first marker of Splatoon 3&#x27;s competitive play (in a professional sense, of course) the tournament would set the first notch on who is the team to beat in the upcoming Nintendo threequel.
After a series of well-fought matches, Nintendo officially crowned team Starburst the top dog of the tournament. The victors out-splatted three other top-ranked teams to take home the coveted Judd and Li’l Judd trophy — now that&#x27;s quite the mantlepiece addition.

The wait has been long, but finally, budding Inklings and Octolings can return to the arena on Friday as Splatoon 3 launches on Switch. And do you know what else comes with new game releases? Envy over all of the cool merchandise that we miss out on!
And Nintendo Tokyo has set our hearts on fire by revealing a rather adorable pullback toy based on Smallfry. For those not in the know, Smallfry is a type of Salmonid that first appeared in Splatoon 2&#x27;s Salmon Run, and is set to make an appearance in Splatoon 3 — you can even change his hairstyle in the upcoming game, at least going by the Splatfest World Premier demo!

Monolith Soft&#x27;s Xenoblade Chronicles 3 has received its first update since the game launched back in July! Nintendo released the patch notes earlier today on its Japanese site (thanks Perfectly Nintendo for translating!), and it seems that version 1.1.1 fixes several bugs throughout the game.
Many of the fixes in this patch are related to enemy encounters that wouldn&#x27;t end due to a bug or altering drop rates of items needed for Collectopaedia Cards, along with the usual &quot;various other fixes&quot;, so we hope these iron out some of this sprawling RPG&#x27;s minor kinks!

                              <span>The Hitman games are often good and usually fun, it’s fair to say, particularly the recent World Of Assassination trilogy. Ian Hitman’s turn in the two films released about his adventures has been rougher to recommend, though. That’s why it’s simultaneously disappointing and awesome to learn that Guardians Of The Galaxy, The Suicide Squad and – shudder – Slither director James Gunn narrowly missed his target when he pitched a Hitman movie.

                              <span>Third person skater shooter Rollerdrome has some really cool weapons, but what is it that makes them so special? I mean, there’s only four of them, and you’re forced to constantly perform tricks to regain ammo, which doesn&#x27;t make them easy to use. I think it’s because of their more literal significance in the game. Rollerdrome threatens you with multiple enemy types called Houseplayers, all formidable, especially in the heat of battle when they combine their efforts. Luckily, the four distinct weapons you’re equipped with act as an equaliser; each weapon is a solution for a particular enemy. Developers Roll7 could have easily added a bunch of copied and pasted guns from every generic shooter, but instead they were more intentional about the weapons they included, with each weapon complimenting the gunplay and the game as a whole.

                              <span>Red Dead Redemption 2 now has official FSR 2.0 support, as of the just-released 1.31 update. This makes Rockstar’s cowboy epic/improvised teleconferencing software the latest game to work with AMD’s upscaler without mods; an unofficial FSR patch for RDR2 has been out for a while, but this update should make it even easier to simply enable or disable FSR in the settings menu. Alongside its rival, Nvidia DLSS, which Rockstar also added last year.

The deal will see Tencent bring some of Ubisoft’s most well known game series to mobile, and to PC in China. Tencent’s investment in Guillemot Brothers Limited follows speculation last month that they were looking to take out a bigger stake in Ubisoft, even becoming the single largest shareholders.

                              <span>I&#x27;m an enormous fan of the premise of Steelrising (which is good, because enormous fans are also a weapon in it). In it, we&#x27;re whisked to an alternative history where King Louis XVI stopped the French Revolution before it properly got going by, err, killing everyone with steampunk robots. You&#x27;re Aegis, a feminine robot created to entertain and protect Queen Marie Antoinette. Marie, safe outside Paris but somewhat peeved at her husband&#x27;s new penchant for extreme mass murder, sends you on a Soulslike mission to sort it all out.
This takes some doing, but luckily Aegis is a very advanced robot, the bestest of all the robots. Slight but adaptive with it, and even having an advanced AI, Aegis can carve a swift path through the more than usually twisted metal in her way. It&#x27;s a bit too easy, in fact.

Unnamed sources have supposedly told TryHardGuides that three new AC games will be announced during the event, with an instalment set in feudal Japan being among them. Bloomberg backs up the report, stating that the other games purported to be in development include one set in the 16th century that could be dealing with witches, and a mobile game set in China.

                              <span>The AMD Ryzen 5 5600 is a cheaper, better-value version of the Ryzen 5600X - the CPU took the world by storm when Ryzen 5000 launched back in 2020. With six cores and 12 threads to access, you get good performance in modern game engines, while the higher single-core speeds introduced with this generation of AMD processors allows for better performance in single-core-limited (often older) games. It&#x27;s a potent combination that makes the 5600X - and the 5600 - the best value AMD CPUs for gaming out there. 
Normally the 5600 retails for £173, in comparison to £185 for the 5600X, but today it&#x27;s down to £150 on Amazon, coming within £10 of the best price we&#x27;ve ever seen on this model.

Not until I saw several scrunching up, pretending to be the eyes, nose and mouth of someone’s face in images from upcoming psychological horror card game Out Of Hands. See, Out Of Hands has a slight fixation on the ol’ phalanges. Witness for yourself in the trailer below.

I&#x27;ll come up with--&#x27; oh no wait its URL is thiefwithguns.com. Fair enough. It is an accurate description, and if you&#x27;ve enjoyed its demos during various Steam Fests, you&#x27;ll be pleased to know it&#x27;s now out in Steam Early Access.

America&#x27;s bad-ass actor dad played semi-imaginary rock anarchist (I know I&#x27;m being reductive, don&#x27;t leave comments) Johnny Silverhand in the main game, and he popped up to confirm he&#x27;s back for 2023&#x27;s expansion - which we now know is officially called Phantom Liberty.
There&#x27;s also the Edgerunner update dropping today, a tie-in for the Netflix anime Edgrunners (more info on that was also revealed tonight), and free-to-play mini game featuring Roach the horse, because we all like Roach the horse.

I don’t think I’ve ever built one on the back of a giant animal after the apocalypse, though. Indie sci-fi citybuilder The Wandering Village will let me do that when it enters early access on Steam on September 14th.

I got a sneaky early peek at Lucid behind closed doors at PAX East earlier this year, and let me tell you, its gorgeous pixel art and emphasis on air dashing through crystalline barriers with a honking great axe looks rad as hell.

But most of my thought is going on farming, planning my crop rotations to optimise fertility and yields. Finally, I have a use for everything school taught me about the three-field system and the nitrogen cycle.

                              <span>The latest playtest build of the next in EA’s Skate series appears to have leaked, continuing the pattern that seems to have been established for the game over the past few months. Footage from the build was shared by Reddit user Parzalai, who said they had been banned from their EA account for leaking a previous build. Modders have been running their own multiplayer servers based on leaked builds of skate. for months, so it’s not surprising to see further leaks spring up from the game’s playtests.

                              <span>The sight of a two-carriage train is normally something that prompts a deep sigh of despair from me in real life. Nine times out of ten, it&#x27;s a sign that something&#x27;s gone wrong further up the line - that someone, somewhere, has sent out a train with half its usual number of carriages, and is therefore destined to ruin everyone&#x27;s day in the process by cramming us all in like a pack of sardines. 
In Afterburn&#x27;s adorable train puzzler Railbound, however, two carriages are a cause for celebration. In a game that&#x27;s about guiding numbered compartments onto the back of an engine (using a limited number of track tiles to get them there in the right order), two-carriage puzzles offer the perfect amount of cerebral head-scratching. They&#x27;ve got a bit more bite than simply guiding a single carriage to its destination, but they&#x27;re not so complicated that they&#x27;ll repeatedly make you reach for the hint button to help you fill in the gaps. Railbound has a tendency to be a bit too abstract in its later stages, but more on that in a sec. All you need to know right now is that there are plenty of smart ideas to wrap your head around here, and that you&#x27;ll be grinning from ear to ear by the time you reach the end of the line.

After four packed days of demos, panels, interviews, and lots of fruit smoothies, Liam and I are completely PAXed out, but we&#x27;re not done quite yet.
Below you&#x27;ll find something a little different from our usual daily round-ups. For our last day at PAX, we&#x27;ve done a super, uber, mega round-up on the entire event.

                              <span>Console users will have to wait for a while
Would-be Gundam pilots will get to show off their skills this month on PC. Gundam Evolution, a free-to-play team-based shooter is going live on Steam on September 21 for North America.
The new Gundam game takes a six-on-six, hero-based approach to the wide, wide expanse of the Gundam universe. It&#x27;s a little bit of Overwatch mixed in with mobile suits.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;qVWpQDJtxHk
Gundam Evolution will feature mainstays from throughout the Gundam-verse, duking it out on the field of battle. Today&#x27;s trailer spotlights a melee-configured Zaku with some hefty axe swings, the Mahiroo from Turn A Gundam, and the titular Unicorn Gundam.
These, alongside classics from throughout the series, all have their own weapons and abilities they bring to the battlefield. Personally, I&#x27;m rooting for the Guntank. He may not be as shiny as something newer like the Barbatos, but darn it, the Guntank is cool.
Matches feature several objective-based modes, including Destruction, Domination, and Point Capture.
A new type of Gundam battle
The PC launch of Gundam Evolution is currently set for a global launch on September 22 in Japan, which puts it at 7 p.m. PDT on September 21 for North America.  The launch will also mark the start of Season One.
There will also be cosmetics to purchase, of course. So if you want to deck out your mobile suit to stand out from the crowd, feel free to do so. It worked for Char, after all.

While Steam players get in on the carnage right away, console players will have to wait. Currently, the team is planning to launch Gundam Evolution on December 1 in Japan, or 6 p.m. PST on November 30 in North America.
Once the end of November rolls around, Gundam Evolution will launch on both the current and previous generation of PlayStation and Xbox consoles.

                              <span>Hide your PlayStation 5 in plain sight
If you&#x27;re tired of the out-of-the-box look of your PlayStation 5, Sony has a new option rolling out. A controller, headset, and console cover for the PS5 are all getting gray camo, as part of a new collection for PS5 owners.
The Gray Camouflage Collection variants of the PS5 DualSense controller and Pulse 3D wireless headset. Alongside those accessories, there is a console cover for both the disc drive-less and disc-capable PS5.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;n0qDTET_tvY
In the accompanying PlayStation blog, Sony says the pattern subtly incorporates the iconic &quot;PlayStation Shapes&quot; into the pattern. And it&#x27;s true, they are in there, as little details you can notice between the splotches.
The Gray Camouflage Collection will be available this fall, with pre-orders starting next week. The DualSense wireless controller and PlayStation 5 console covers will roll out first, with a global launch on October 14. The Pulse 3D wireless headset is set to roll out sometime in December.
Tactical fidelity
Sony has been steadily rolling out a number of console covers. In June, the console manufacturer launched several different variants, including Starlight Blue, Galactic Purple, and Nova Pink. That&#x27;s alongside the previously available Cosmic Red and Midnight Black.
While I haven&#x27;t opted to pick up a new color for my PlayStation 5 yet, I did pick up a Midnight Black DualSense. It&#x27;s a pretty nice controller, and has lasted a good while.
As for the actual functionality of the camouflage, I cannot say. The sheer size of the PS5 might make obscuring its presence in your living room difficult.
Still, if you&#x27;re looking for different options for DualSense controllers, the Gray Camo will at least make your PS5 controller fairly distinct. No price has been announced yet, though console covers have usually gone for $54.99 and DualSense color variants tend to add a little extra.

                              <span>And the gorgeous and deadly Sabuko returns
Developer WayForward has released a brand new trailer for its upcoming release River City Girls 2, which not only introduces us to the narrative&#x27;s wretched hive of villainy, but also debuts the brawler sequel&#x27;s chaotic, knuckle-dustin&#x27; four-player co-op action.
River City Girls 2 will see schoolyard superheroes Kyoko and Misako take to the streets of gaming&#x27;s most violent town in order to, once again, serve up their own brand of dopey, two-fisted justice. Standing in their way are a slew of familiar and not-so-familiar faces, including returning gangland boss Sabuko, her obnoxious step-brother Ken, (which die-hard fans will remember from River City Girls Zero), and River City&#x27;s most hated antagonist — the sibling&#x27;s murderous father Sabu.

Fortunately, our hometown heroes will not be charging into battle alone. Not only will Kyoko and Misako be aided by long-time Kunio-kun protagonists Kunio and Riki, but Double Dragon&#x27;s Marian and River City Underground&#x27;s Provie will also be stepping up to the plate, bringing their own unique, hard-hitting combat styles. The trailer debuts RCG 2&#x27;s four-player co-op action, which will help the River City Girls even the odds further against armies of bullies, street criminals, gangsters, and other dangerous roustabouts that stand in the way of street justice. Put up yer dukes...
River City Girls 2 will launch later this year on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms. Be sure to check out our previous write-ups on both River City Girls and River City Girls Zero, as well as our interviews with director Adam Tierney, and awesome composer Megan McDuffee.

                              <span>Players can hop in either weekend for an early peek
Subnautica developer Unknown Worlds recently revealed its upcoming strategy game Moonbreaker. And if en end-of-September Early Access launch seems too far away, the studio is hosting several playtest sessions very soon.
Moonbreaker will hit Steam Early Access on September 29. Prior to that, though, Unknown Worlds and Krafton will host two playtest weekends, on September 9 through 11 and September 16 through 18.
The primary goal of these sessions will be to stress-test the servers. Getting signed up for the playtest is pretty easy, too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;ef5ajtJuKns
How to sign-up for Moonbreaker playtest
Log onto Steam
Find Moonbreaker on the store (link)
Click &quot;Request Access&quot; under the playtest section
Confirm!
Easy enough, right?
Paint it, black (or any other color you&#x27;d like)
During these weekend playtests, players will have access to the full game, barring some systems and the store. This also includes all Season 1 units and Captains. While those will be gradually unlocked in the Steam Early Access version, the Moonbreaker playtest will make them available right away so everything can be tested.
All progress will be wiped too, with one notable exception. Paint jobs will carry forward into the Early Access. Since painting the virtual miniature figurines of Moonbreaker seems like a big draw, that&#x27;s nice to see.

Unknown Worlds also warns that these tests are meant to push the servers to their limits, and so interruptions and emergency maintenance can occur.
It&#x27;s a pretty easy playtest to sign up for, though. And with the Early Access not far off, this is a nice way to test the waters to see if this new Unknown Worlds experience is worth checking out on launch. I&#x27;m already into the surprisingly detailed painting features, but for those who want some tabletop strategy without the real-world clutter, this seems worth keeping an eye on.

                              <span>Announced on a producer livestream
Everyone involved with Live A Live Switch has a lot to celebrate, as a recent livestream just confirmed that the game has shipped + digital sold over 500,000 units. The news was confirmed by series steward Takashi Tokita on air at roughly 16:30 in the below video. Takashi Tokita served as director for the original game (among other duties), and was also a producer on the 2022 Switch edition.
It&#x27;s hard to believe that Live A Live clawed its way up from a 1994 SNES exclusive only released in Japan, to where it is today. It was only a glimmer in the eye of many JRPG fans, back in an era when importing was even tougher to do; but now it&#x27;s easily accessible on a worldwide marketplace, on the widely successful Switch no less. It just goes to show you how far game preservation can come when it&#x27;s done with care.
As of late, Tokita has been sharing a ton of fan art for the game, as well as stories from fans all over the world. Many of those fans are located in Japan, but there&#x27;s a wide spread of folks from multiple regions: showcasing the staying power (and wide appeal to this day) of Live A Live. How many other forgotten classics could get the same treatment? It&#x27;ll be fun to find out.

                              <span>Farewell to a Downtown Nekketsu legend
Japanese developer Miracle Kidz! has reported the sad news that its president, Mitsuhiro Yoshida, passed away &quot;suddenly&quot; on August 30. Yoshida, who has been part of the games industry for many decades, is best known as the co-director of one of the most popular brawlers in history, River City Ransom.
Described by his Miracle Kidz! colleagues as the &quot;father&quot; of the Downtown Nekketsu franchise, Yoshida — alongside co-director Hiroyuki Sekimoto — may not have been responsible for the creation of the Kunio-kun franchise, but certainly helmed its most well-known and widely played entry. River City Ransom, (known in its native Japan as Downtown Nekketsu Monogatari) launched on the NES in 1989 and is one of the first titles to marry the belt-scrolling brawler action of the series with a non-linear RPG structure. The international success of RCR helped paved the way for a slew of sequels and spin-offs.
https://twitter.com/miracle_kidz/status/1565907621072470016?s&#x3D;20&amp;t&#x3D;1EUKMC8KdRfhUOeqUT2pDg
Yoshida would continue to work with the franchise, directing the goofy NES port of Nekketsu Koko Dodgeball (Super Dodge Ball), before starting up a studio comprised of many former employees of old-school developer Technos Japan. Since founding Miracle Kidz!, Yoshida has continued to work on several titles set both in and out of the Kunio-kun universe, and was reportedly working on a new game right up until his untimely passing.
As a mainstay of any NES owner&#x27;s catalog, River City Ransom has provided brawler fans with hours upon hours of double-fisted action — paving the way for the series&#x27; enduring appeal, recognized today in the form of WayForward&#x27;s popular River City Girls franchise.
We at Destructoid offer our condolences to his family and friends.

                              <span>It&#x27;ll drop at 9AM ET on September 7 on The Pokemon Channel YouTube
Nintendo and The Pokemon Company have been trying an array of strategies for promoting Pokemon Scarlet and Violet: from primo Pokemon streams, to mysterious teases, to hasty trailer drops with new info. The next Scarlet and Violet update is going to be via the latter. Announced on Twitter, a new trailer for Pokemon Scarlet and Violet is on the way, and scheduled for tomorrow, September 7 at 9AM ET.
Typically these will showcase new mechanics, creatures, and storyline additions, clocking in at a few minutes long, or up to six-ish minutes. Sometimes these are accompanied with voiceovers that provide a ton of new info, coupled with website additions that elaborate on what was discussed in the video. Either way it&#x27;s all getting dropped at once at 9AM ET, so everyone can enjoy it at the same time. When that happens, you can find the video here, where it will just appear.
I&#x27;m not really sure what to expect or what I even need to see at this point beyond some sort of game-changing evolution for the series. So far Scarlet and Violet look like competent Pokemon games, and the &quot;open world&quot; seems to be the biggest focus thus far.

                              <span>Mesa recently landed BPTC software fallback handling that is a requirement for OpenGL 4.2 support but BPTC is not natively supported by all GPU hardware, particularly on the embedded side. That software emulation support for BPTC is similar to what already has existed within Mesa for the ASTC and ETC formats too. A merge request is pending that also adds S3TC software fallback handling, which helps out some of the smaller, embedded GPU drivers too for getting more games running that are dependent on S3 Texture Compression...</span>

S3TC je historicky široce používaný kompresní mechanismus, který mívá velmi širokou podporu v grafickém hardwaru a jeho ovladačích, nicméně i tak existují GPU implementace, které S3TC neumí.

                              <span>CD Projekt Red has unveiled the first Cyberpunk 2077 story expansion called Phantom Liberty will be released next year. 
This was revealed during today&#x27;s Night City Wire livestream, which is also where CDPR, Netflix, and Studio Trigger revealed what the English Dub for Cyberpunk: Edgerunnners sounds like. CDPR revealed Phantom Liberty shortly after, and it looks great. Not only does it add more to V&#x27;s story, with them seemingly becoming a secret service-like agent for the New United States of America, but it also sees Keanu Reeves&#x27; Johnny Silverhand return to the fold.

This fall, you can outfit your PS5 with gray camouflage plates, a DualSense controller, or Pulse 3D headset. While it&#x27;s as camo as camo can be, eagle-eyed fans can spot tiny PlayStation symbols embedded into the lightest shades of the pattern for a nice touch. 


Pre-orders begin on September 15. The cover plates and DualSense launch globally on October 14. The headset becomes available in December. Sony has not listed prices for these items. 
Maybe one day we&#x27;ll get a camo version of the recently revealed DualSense Edge controller. In related news, Sony recently increased the price of the PlayStation 5 in multiple non-U.S. territories. It also acquired Savage Games Studios as part of its newly formed mobile division.</span>

I say it&#x27;s a trailer that&#x27;s kind of new because if you&#x27;ve been keeping up with Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, there&#x27;s a good chance you&#x27;ve already seen it. It&#x27;s the NSFW one released last week, but it featured Japanese VO with subtitles. Today, CDPR has released the same trailer with the English dub now.

Q: Will Cyberpunk: Edgerunners have English dubbing?

September 6, 2022
As you can see, the English dub sounds great. The studio also announced the series will feature 12 total dubs, including English, Japanese, German, Polish, French, and more. There will be subtitles for each of those languages and many more too.

Winding footpaths led to expansive hubs at a scale unlike previous games in the franchise. Ornate chests holding rare equipment and Jötnar Shrines with lore murals were just some of the items awaiting wide-eyed players across six realms. Golden path locales like Midgard and its massive Lake of the Nine, Alfheim, home to light and dark elves, Helheim, the underworld, and Jötunheim, the land of Giants, were sprawling zones in their own right, filled with enough content to keep players engaged. Yet, the optional but equally impressive Niflheim and Muspelheim realms pushed player skills to the limit with vigorous combat trials.

                              <span>The Pokémon Company has revealed that it will drop a brand new Pokémon Scarlet and Violet trailer tomorrow, Sept. 7. This news comes from a tweet made today on the official Pokémon Twitter account, and while it says the trailer drops tomorrow at 6 a.m. PT/ 9 a.m. ET, it doesn&#x27;t reveal anything else.

September 6, 2022
So as for what to expect, your guess is as good as anyone else&#x27;s. I wager we&#x27;ll be seeing some new Pokémon, perhaps some more information about the legendaries and how they play into the wider narrative of this gen, and maybe a new look at some gym leaders. Only time will tell, but fortunately, we don&#x27;t have to wait long. 
In the meantime, watch the latest Pokémon Scarlet and Violet trailer for a quick look at this gen&#x27;s competitive play, and then catch up on everything we learned from the recent Pokémon Presents livestream. 
What&#x27;s the one thing you really hope to see during tomorrow&#x27;s trailer? Let us know in the comments below!</span>

                              <span>The Elgato Stream Deck MK.2 is a kind of funny thing, a little plastic box with 15 plastic buttons. Each button has a tiny screen behind it, and when pressed can do any number of things - launching a program, changing to a new scene in a stream, adjusting your media volume, muting a microphone or sending out an alert. It&#x27;s ideal for automation, giving you an easy way to trigger scripts or shortcuts that speed up the dreary parts of your job or your favourite game, and of course for game streamers it&#x27;s invaluable. The MK.2 model normally costs £139, but today at Currys you can pick one up for £97 using the code GAMING30.

                              <span>BioShock Remastered, BioShock 2 Remastered and BioShock Infinite have all fallen afoul of some questionably titled “quality of life” updates that publishers 2K Games released last week. These updates added a new 2K Launcher to all three BioShocks that appears when booting them up from Steam, but as found by GamingOnLinux, something about this launcher doesn’t take kindly to Linux-based operating systems. Linux-based operating systems like the Steam Deck’s SteamOS.


As it happens, then, there&#x27;s a chance – if you’re trying to play on Valve’s handheld PC – that all these updates will do is swing a bloodied 9-iron into the Deck’s ability to launch the affected games at all. Whoopsie doodle.

                              <span>Back in the mists of time of 2014, the original Tales From The Borderlands followed the classic Telltale episodic template, with a new chapter dropping every three or four months. Gearbox Software&#x27;s upcoming New Tales From The Borderlands, however, is going to be doing things a bit differently. As our PAX West team found out over the weekend, NuTales will still be split up into an episodic-style chapter structure, according to director of production James Lopez, but you won&#x27;t have to wait several months before you can play them altogether.

                              <span>A truly dynamic story is a goal game designers have strived toward for decades. Worldwalker Games&#x27; Wildermyth gets closer to that goal than most. In this spellbinding RPG, players guide bands of heroes through a lifetime of adventure, embarking on dozens of short, whimsical quests wherein they grow, age, and quite literally evolve, with the potential to transform into walking trees, celestial beings, and anthropomorphised crows.


Wildermyth is an inspired example of narrative design, with some nifty tactical combat to boot. But when Nate Austin, his wife Annie, and his brother Doug began developing the game around eight years ago, the weight of emphasis between storytelling and combat was very much the other way around.

                              <span>A store page for The Division&#x27;s upcoming free-to-play looter-shooter spin-off The Division: Heartland went up on the Ubisoft Store yesterday, revealing new details about the game&#x27;s setting and multiplayer modes. The store page has since been taken down, but not before it was spotted by a few eagle-eyed Twitterers. Seeing as the next Ubisoft Forward showcase is scheduled for this coming Saturday, it’s entirely possible that we’ll be seeing some concrete deets about Heartland then.

                              <span>Images that allegedly show a Silent Hill 2 remake have been doing the rounds online over the weekend, featuring creepy nurses and the very shadowy back of protagonist James Sunderland’s head. They’re appropriately blurry, considering the series&#x27; penchant for mistiness, but still recognisably Silent Hill. Once again, it’s claimed that the game is being developed by Layers Of Fear studio Bloober Team.

This week, my eye has been caught by a shrimp breeding game, some lovely places to explore, some bleak places to explore, and a plasma rifle with a surprising number of functions.

We played some of our favourite games from the whole event and also recorded two incredible interviews you won&#x27;t wanna miss. Watch our daily round-up of everything we did for more info!

After watching yesterday&#x27;s TF2 panel, we were incredibly excited to put our own questions to the TF2 squad. Ellen McLain (the TF2 announcer), Gary Schwartz (Heavy and Demoman), John Patrick Lowrie (Sniper) and Robin Atkin Downes (Medic) answered all our questions including how they each created the voices for the characters and if they would they return for a completely metaphorical release of Team Fortress 3 which - spoilers - was a resounding yes. Watch below for the entire interview.

Local ISPs have been ordered to block 18 pirate sites but the same order also applies to domain registrars, including US-based Namecheap and GoDaddy. These far-reaching measures apply to a movie that hasn&#x27;t yet been released and hasn&#x27;t been pirated either.

                              <span>It&#x27;s the dawn of day three here at  PAX West, and what better way to wake us up than play the incredibly chaotic demo build of
 Friends VS Friends. We loved the trailer from Gamescom and Liam even chose it for his bestest pick in our Gamescom round-up video, so our expectations were high, and after playing a quick match at the Raw Fury booth, Brainwash Gang&#x27;s blood-pumping deck-building FPS shot straight to the top of our favourite things we&#x27;ve seen here at PAX so far.
If you&#x27;ve not heard of Friends VS Friends, check out the game&#x27;s trailer first (its incredibly slick animation is super cool, highly reccomended for your peepers) then watch our interview with Brainwash Gang developer Edu Verz who talked all about the game&#x27;s development.

It&#x27;s now the weekend so the show floor was significantly busier, but not enough to keep us from getting our mitts on some games. That&#x27;s right, we actually played some games today!
Have a click on the video below were we break down the day&#x27;s activities and also to see us get booted out from the show floor when it closed at 7. Here&#x27;s today&#x27;s daily round-up:

                              <span>Today&#x27;s PAX West interview is with the one and only Ron Gilbert, series creator of the iconic point-and-click adventure series, Monkey Island. We are big fans of Monkey Island here at RPS, so after watching him guest speak on the Adventure Games PAX panel today, we got a chance to chinwag with Gilbert and to chat about his upcoming comeback to the series with Return to Monkey Island.
Gilbert was lovely enough to tell us all about the next game in the Monkey Island saga -  what it was like to return to Monkey Island&#x27;s world after so long, what we can expect from the puzzles, and snippets of the game&#x27;s story. Watch below to see the interview in its entirety and make sure you watch to the end to see my impression of a pirate - you won&#x27;t wanna miss that.

                              <span>It&#x27;s day two of PAX West and to kick off our second day of game events and demos we got hands-on with a build of Neowiz&#x27;s Pinocchio RPG, Lies of P. The gameplay demo caused quite a stir when it was at Gamescom earlier this year, so we made it one of our priorities to check it out here in Seattle.
Neowiz are not actually at PAX so there wasn&#x27;t anyone on the team to give us some behind-the-scenes info, but I got stuck into the demo for a solid 30 minutes, brawling with the game&#x27;s angry robot lads that roamed the city&#x27;s blood-washed cobbled streets.
Overall, I had a great time with the demo. Yes, it is incredibly similar to Bloodborne in both its combat and environments but there are plenty of other elements that steer it away from FromSoftware&#x27;s horror-filled gothic RPG. If you want more details instead of that short summary then check out our video below where I talk about my time with the build, and about having my arse kicked by giant mechanical automatons. Enjoy!

                              <span>A few weeks ago we posted about a stellar deal on Lenovo&#x27;s BoostStation, an external GPU enclosure that lets you turn almost any Thunderbolt 3 laptop into a gaming powerhouse with the simple addition of a graphics card. Rather than the £200 or £300 prices we normally see attached to these enclosures, this one was available at just £93. Now that deal is back, once again via the Laptop Outlet store on Ebay. 
This time though, you&#x27;ll  need to use code FANCY15 to knock 15% off the price of the BoostStation, bringing it down to that alluring £93 price point once again.

                              <span>Seagate&#x27;s IronWolf and IronWolf Pro hard drives are amongst the best available, and now you can get an 8TB IronWolf model for £150 at Amazon, a historic low price. 
This is a huge amount of storage, ideal for archiving games and storing media like music and video, and well worth considering especially if your boot SSD is getting full. By comparison, the cheapest 8TB SSD is £669, making this more than four times cheaper.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been a busy day at PAX West, but nothing has been as wild as the Gearbox Software panel. Randy Pitchford made a return to the Seattle stage to let us know what&#x27;s coming up for Gearbox, but not without some shenanigans first.
After a classic Randy magic trick, a proud display of lock-down Lego builds, and a chaotic bidding war where he auctioned off the literal shirt off his back (which an audience member bought for an eye-watering $1200) we finally got to see some fresh New Tales From The Borderlands gameplay and had a lovely chat with director of production, James Lopez. Watch the video below for the interview in its entirety - it&#x27;s a good&#x27;un!

                              <span>Publisher 2K teased back in April that it was bringing back Telltale’s Tales from the Borderlands series but that this time, it would be developed in-house by Gearbox Software. Then, during Gamescom’s Opening Night Live event, Gearbox officially revealed the sequel, which is less a direct continuation of Telltale’s story and more a spiritual successor to the series, which is evident in its official name: New Tales from the Borderlands. 
That new trailer gave us a look at the new protagonists – altruistic scientist Anu, her street-wise brother Octavio, and local business owner Fran – as well as a look at just how Tales from the Borderlands this new entry is this time around. Sure, it’s a new cast and an all-new story in the world of Borderlands, but it’s clear it will play and feel familiar…</span>

                              <span>Fans of Splitgate, the sci-fi multiplayer shooter with portals, received some bittersweet news today. Developer 1047 Games has announced it’s finally bringing the game out of its lengthy beta and launching it in 1.0 next month. It also revealed plans to create another title within the Splitgate universe. But to facilitate work on this next project, it will cease feature development of Splitgate.
1047 explains in a press release that it’s developing a new shooter in Unreal Engine 5 set in the world of Splitgate, which means it will also feature portals. There aren&#x27;t any more details beyond this, but it will be the team’s full-time project going forward. 
As such, 1047 is launching Splitgate out of beta on September 15, but it will move away from creating substantial content after that. However, the team assures fans that Splitgate will remain online. The game’s launch will kick off a new season, which includes a new, free battle pass featuring an infinite number of levels along with new characters, skins, and other goodies. Splitgate’s weekly featured playlists, and item drops will continue, and the team will still work on smaller fixes and updates. 
You can read 1047&#x27;s full statement below (click to enlarge):
Splitgate launched in PC beta in 2019, but the game really caught fire when its console beta began in 2021. The game became so popular on PlayStation and Xbox that servers regularly became congested, to the point that 1047 decided to postpone the full launch and keep the game in an indefinite beta to focus on further stabilizing the online infrastructure as the project continued to receive more funding. Season 0 began last August, adding a new map, game mode, and other features.</span>

                              <span>Standing here, I realize that this Super Replay will be a cut above the rest because we’ll be slicing and dicing in Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance! Join us today on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central to enjoy two hours of what will be a full playthrough of the cult favorite action game streaming weekly each Friday. 
Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance serves as a sequel/spin-off to Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots that puts cyborg ninja Raiden at the helm. Instead of sneaking around in boxes, players eviscerate foes in fast-paced, stylish action courtesy of developer Platinum Games. Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look. Will I acquire a new appreciation for the game nine years later? How many watermelons will I slice? You’ll have to tune in to find out. 
Watch on Twitch!
Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Andrew Reiner and Blake Hester, as we revisit Raiden’s beloved solo adventure. If you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes. You’ll also be granted entry to the official Game Informer Discord channel, where our welcoming community members, moderators, and staff gather to talk games, entertainment, food, and organize hangouts!</span>

                              <span>DC Fandome, the virtual fan convention showcasing DC movies, TV shows, and, of course, video games, will not take place this year, Warner Bros. Discovery confirms. 
The first DC Fandome took place in 2020, serving as a livestream alternative to in-person conventions in the wake of the pandemic. It featured virtual panels with celebrities and filmmakers that provided new announcements, trailers, and early looks at all things DC media. In terms of video games, the 2020 and 2021 editions gave us substantial new looks at Gotham Knights and Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. 
In a statement to Popverse, Warner Bros. Discovery explains the decision by writing:
Fandome’s cancellation is an unfortunate blow in the ongoing transition resulting from April’s Warner Bros./Discovery merger. Although only two years old, Fandome has found great success, generating millions of views. Last year&#x27;s show was highlighted by new trailers for The Batman, Black Adam, and The Flash. Unfortunately, the DC film slate has largely been flipped on its head since then as several projects have been delayed (Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, Shazam! Fury of the Gods), in limbo (The Flash), or canceled (Batgirl). 
While we won&#x27;t see them during DC&#x27;s big event, Gotham Knights launches on October 21, and Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League arrives sometime in 2023.

                              <span>CD Projekt Red has revealed that it will air a special episode of Night City Wire next week to discuss what&#x27;s next for Cyberpunk 2077 and its upcoming anime, Cyberpunk: Edgerunners. 
For the uninitiated, Night City Wire is basically like CDPR&#x27;s version of a Nintendo Direct, except the showcases are specifically focused on Cyberpunk 2077. They were quite prevalent in the leadup to the release of Cyberpunk 2077, but now, with it nearing two years old, Night City Wire has grown to be rarer. The next one airs on Sept. 6 at 8 a.m. PT/11 a.m. ET, though, and will be &quot;about our upcoming anime Cyberpunk: Edgerunners and what&#x27;s next for Cyberpunk 2077.&quot;
Choooom! There&#x27;s something new on the horizon – a special episode of Night City Wire!
#Edgerunners and what&#x27;s next for #Cyberpunk2077. 🔥

                              <span>Developer Avalanche and Warner Bros. Interactive have released a new Hogwarts Legacy featurette that dives deep into the design of the titular school. It also features the first-ever look at the four house common rooms in Hogwarts Legacy, a sneak peek of some of the easter eggs in the game, and more. 
This new featurette runs more than four minutes long and gives players the most in-depth look at the actual school of Hogwarts in this game thus far. As noted in the video, the design of Hogwarts is based on the eight Harry Potter movies and the books written by controversial author J.K. Rowling, who will undoubtedly be making money from the sales of this game. 
Check out the featurette for yourself below: 


As you can see, Hogwarts is looking great, as are the four common rooms. What’s especially interesting is it gives viewers a look at the Hufflepuff common room, which has rarely been seen on screen in the wizarding world, as pointed out in the video. 
What’s more, the featurette also contains information about linking your WB Games account to your Harry Potter Fan Club account. Doing so will automatically bring your Fan Club wand into the game alongside your Hogwarts house, which can be determined on the Fan Club’s site through a special sorting quiz. You’ll also unlock some in-game rewards for doing so, too, including a special decorative house robe and a beaked skull mask. Check them out in the gallery below: 

For more, read about how Hogwarts Legacy has been delayed from 2022 to February 10, 2023, and then check out the unique PlayStation 5 DualSense features for Hogwarts Legacy. Watch this Hogwarts Legacy trailer from last week that showcases unforgivable curses and Sebastian Sallow’s Dark Legacy questline after that.

                              <span>At Gamescom I sat down with a lovely ice cold beer and two lovely lads who ran me through military real-time tactics sequel Men Of War II in a 45-minute hands-off presentation. As a total freshman to the series, I was a little intimidated by the prospect of sinking my feet into the trenches of a dense strategy bonanza, especially as things kicked off with a literal history lesson.
But after watching and absorbing one of the game&#x27;s early missions, I can genuinely say that I&#x27;d be confident enough to give it a go when it comes out. Even perhaps, confident enough to say that I&#x27;d genuinely enjoy it quite a bit as a total newbie.

                              <span>Oh my goodness, what a creepy, funny, and odd game Northern Journey is. I almost don&#x27;t want to say any more about it, not because it can be spoiled but because it seems appropriately respectful. Not in a reverent sense, you understand. It just feels like such a world should be preserved, even slightly feared, rather than trampled on by some idiot with a camera in her face.
To call Northern Journey &quot;retro&quot; would completely misrepresent it. It&#x27;s beautiful in an ugly, desolate way reminiscent of Kenshi or Morrowind. It&#x27;s translucent in its exposition but not obtuse, hostile, or obnoxiously hard. It&#x27;s a bit clunky, without that ever undermining the experience. It&#x27;s vaguely amateurish, yet almost consciously so, like a painter who knows their talent and intent is enough to overcome any technical flaws. This is a bloody treat and I&#x27;m so glad I got to play it.

                              <span>Real-time tactics game Men Of War 2 has been pushed to 2023 to incorporate more features and content sparked by feedback from closed playtests. Developers Best Way and publishers Fulqrum say the impact of having to pause development because of the outbreak of war in Best Way’s home country of Ukraine has led them to take extra time on the game for these to be implemented. Watch the latest trailer below.

The cheeky scamps at poncle have only gone and made me look like a right sausage today, surprise announcing another patch. This time, they’re adding in a new game mode, quick start, and a very odd new character.

                              <span>Another indie developer has come forward publicly with allegations that UK-based publishers PQube have withheld money from them. Thai dev team Corecell claim they’ve only seen some of the minimum guaranteed money agreed when they signed the European console publishing rights to their action-puzzle game AeternoBlade 2 over to PQube in 2019. 

Corecell say they attempted to resolve things with PQube but that didn’t work, and they had to terminate the publishing agreement in 2020. Since then, Corecell have tried to regain the rights to AeternoBlade 2 from PQube to no avail. Corecell allege that PQube did offer to return the rights to the game, but only if they would agree to keep the situation secret.

                              <span>Statistically, there’s a good chance you clicked onto this page with a Logitech G502 mouse. Between its Proteus Spectrum and refreshed Hero models, the G502 has sold boatloads, and was voted as RPS readers’ favourite gaming mouse in both 2019 and 2021. Not undeservedly either, as it’s sat atop our best gaming mouse rankings for years. Making more drastic improvements to it wouldn’t therefore seem like a pressing priority, but Logitech have had a crack regardless with the new G502 X series.


There’s a trio of redesigned rodents in this family: the standard G502 X I’ve got on review here, the wireless G502 X Lightspeed, and the G502 X Plus, which is essentially the G502 X Lightspeed with added RGB lighting. Since prices max out at £150 / $160 for the G502 X Plus, the two Lightspeed-equipped mice could be less expensive alternatives to Razer’s new DeathAdder V3 Pro and Basilisk V3 Pro – but as the cheapest and most direct successor the G502 Hero, it’s the G502 X that’s likely to see the most desk action. Does it deserve to?

                              <span>First impressions can be interesting. I didn’t know what to expect when I met David Ventura at the Backbeat booth, after a long opening day of the weekend-long Japanese indie gaming event BitSummit. I knew of his work - now the CEO of his self-founded studio Ichigoichie with developers based both in Japan and Sweden, Ventura has had his hands in a number of highly-influential rhythm games over the course of his career. This includes work on Gitaroo Man and Elite Beat Agents during his time in Japan at iNiS, having worked at the studio for a decade before moving to Sweden to work outside of games on educational music software. In 2018 he returned to games by founding Ichigoichie (stylised as 151A). Their first game, Hexagroove, blended strategy, rhythm and educational tools for a game that captured the building blocks of being a DJ.


Ventura was at BitSummit to showcase the successor to this game, Backbeat. It’s a bit of a departure from much of his past work, acting more like a puzzle game with a musical soul, albeit one where the act of creating and playing music together is imbued into every solution. As the crowd began to leave the bustling convention hall for the day, I went to the booth for one last demo, and the chance to speak to the person behind it all… who was sat at his demo kiosk playing the keytar.

Gizmo is the original source of the gremlins, and the sweetest character from the movies, but you still wouldn’t want to mess with the little fellow. He’ll arrive on Tuesday, ahead of the already announced Stripe, Gremlins&#x27; big (small) bad.

                              <span>Many archival and emulation projects are underway to preserve the wonderful history of Flash games, and best of all are those which try to recreate the original experience: just clicking a link then playing a game inside your browser. Now one unofficial Flash Player emulator is adding support for more classic games, ones made in the (relatively) newfangled ActionScript 3 language. So you can party like it&#x27;s 2008 by heading over to Newgrounds and playing You Have To Burn The Rope again, as well as Wonderputt and a handful of others.

                              <span>Inti Creates have earned themselves a reputation in recent years, through titles like Blaster Master Zero and the Azure Striker Gunvolt series, of creating visually-intricate and technical 2D platformers. Their games scratch the nostalgic itch while not reverting to the technical problems and gameplay hurdles that we’ve long since moved beyond. Part of what makes Gunvolt appealing is that it refines and expands upon a formula we see in the Mega Man X series, and it’s a similar intent that defines the company’s approach to their latest project, Grim Guardians: Demon Purge.

The game’s campaign network co-op, season 3 of multiplayer, and Forge mode have been pushed back, and couch co-op outright cancelled. And if there’s one thing about Halo that you don’t mess with then it would seem that’s couch co-op.

All we know for sure so far is that the game exists, it’s definitely called Mirage, and returns to the Middle Eastern setting of the original Assassin’s Creed. I rather like the blue highlights to the assassin’s robes in this one.

                              <span>As indie developers from Japan and around the world descended upon the former Japanese capital of Kyoto for Bitsummit 2022, some developers present at the event were showcasing their games a little closer to home. Having already been hyped up amongst Japanese games outlets for its unique visuals and inspirations from Japanese yokai and folk tales, Kitsune: The Journey Of Adashino was a rather hot ticket at the event, and with an English localisation and a release in 2023 or 2024 planned, it stands with the opportunity to shine a light on the Japanese indie gaming scene.


While it may perhaps be reductive to make a Studio Ghibli comparison to the game’s opening moments, the familiarity many have with those films compared to Japanese folklore makes the equivalence an easy one. My time with the demo was from a moment early in the game, when you’ve already set foot into this new world but don&#x27;t have much knowledge about the yokai-infested supernatural surprises that await you.

                              <span>Cloudflare suggests that it made a mistake by terminating the accounts of The Daily Stormer and 8Chan. These decisions made it harder for the company to defend itself against overbroad termination requests and invited a wave of follow-up demends, from activists to copyright holders. This isn&#x27;t a position Cloudflare wants to be in.

                              <span>The Alliance for Creativity and Entertainment has added the scalps of more pirate streaming sites to its growing collection. Earlier distress signals suggested that HDFilme and xCine might be in trouble, but their domains diverting to ACE leaves no doubt. Importantly, both sites were operated from Vietnam, an increasingly big player in global piracy that has the MPA worried.

As well as the Yeti and Snowball USB microphones that are most likely to be familiar to you, there&#x27;s also a rare 42% discount on the Blue Blackout Spark XLR mic - nice. 
However, the microphones I&#x27;d like to focus on today are those popular options, specifically the Blue Snowball Ice and the Blue Yeti X. These represent the top and the bottom of the Blue spectrum when it comes to gaming-friendly USB mics.

                              <span>The second-best way to make Twitter palatable (after simply unfollowing sources of bad tweets) is to follow a load of curated and bot accounts which trickle niceness into your timeline. Today I&#x27;d like to suggest adding Skybox Satellite, a Twitter account which shows glimpses of the skies wrapped around maps in GoldSrc games like Half-Life and Counter-Strike. It&#x27;s sometimes pretty, sometimes nostalgic, and sometimes impressive.

                              <span>Back at Geoff Fest, I spoke with Glenn Schofield about The Callisto Protocol, its gore system, spiky walls, and batteries. From what I&#x27;d seen and heard, I was keen to see more of the sci-fi horror game that&#x27;s not Dead Space but is also quite like Dead Space.
So, at this year&#x27;s Geoffscom I was able to see a 20-minute presentation of some new Callisto goodness and then chat with Striking Distance Studios&#x27; chief technology officer Mark James about what I&#x27;d seen. We touched on dismemberment, 3D printers, and Shaun Of The Dead, naturally.

There’s also the upcoming free Bastion update, which introduces memory maps for characters, the loyal and disloyal traits, and revamps childhood events. Have a watch of the trailer for Friends And Foes below, old buddy, old pal.

                              <span>Last week HyperX announced their first-ever gaming monitors, the Armada 25 and Armada 27, and within a couple of days I was being led into their Gamescom booth to try each of them for myself. After a disappointingly uncomfortable preview of the Samsung Odyssey Ark, it was nice to get to grips with a far more utilitarian pair of monitors – albeit not without a party trick of their own, namely HyperX’s Armada Gaming Mount.

Wowzer! Thanks for being with us for this record-breaking feat. We asked for suggestions and received many excellent ones, but in the end we went with a suggestion from Jonathon which, at the time we recorded, I did not realise would be instantly revealed by the episode title. Cheers to you all!

                              <span>Further investigation of Microsoft’s $68.7 billion takeover of Activision Blizzard is needed by the UK’s competition regulator, a statement on the government’s website confirmed today. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) began the preliminary stage of their investigation at the beginning of July, with a deadline set for September 1st. That initial stage of investigation found that the deal could “substantially lessen competition in gaming consoles, multi-game subscription services, and cloud gaming services”.

The images show what’s purported to be artwork of something called The Forty Thieves Quest for the rumoured Assassin’s Creed: Mirage, also known by the development name of Rift.

                              <span>Stories always came first for the team at NOVECT. The critical and commercial success of The House In Fata Morgana surprised many upon the title’s international release, including the developers themselves. Headlines were made when the game shot temporarily to the spot of most critically-acclaimed game of all time on Metacritic, despite being still relatively under the radar beforehand. Fata Morgana first released to the public in Japan in 2012, and gained a cult following before its eventual successful international release. The reason for it&#x27;s acclaim? Storytelling. Every single review praised Fata Morgana&#x27;s surprising and enthralling twists and turns as what made this visual novel a must-play title, even for non-fans of the genre.


At the time development started, NOVECT were less a development studio, and more of a group of univeristy friends with minimal coding experience but a love for telling stories; a hobby project run by friends on the side of university and normal jobs inside and out of the games industry, only becoming a fully-fledged studio later down the line. Fast forward to today, NOVECT are a firmly-established indie developer with games and multimedia adaptations of their work under their belt, and new project still mysteriously known as &quot;Project Code Name &#x27;M&#x27;&quot; now in the works. Originally starting development in 2019 and announced earlier this year, Project M had its first public demo at this month’s Bitsummit indie gaming showcasing in Kyoto.

                              <span>There were high expectations going into Buried Memory, patch 6.2 for Final Fantasy XIV - new raids, new story, and, most importantly, a new mode called Island Sanctuary to fulfil all of your farming dreams. There were Harvest Moon and Animal Crossing memes aplenty in the run up to release, with players hungry to customise their own cosy piece of Hydaelyn.


Meant as a casual mode to relax away from dungeons and grinding levels, Island Sanctuary has no Job level limitations and can be enjoyed by anyone. Even though you can craft your own buildings and gather materials, you don’t need to have played any gathering or crafting classes. With a base to customise, crops to tend to and a pasture full of animals to pet, it’s easy to see why comparisons were drawn to other farming games such as Stardew Valley.

                              <span>Today was due to be the day when some older Ubisoft games would see their online services decommissioned, but the company is granting them a temporary reprieve. You now have until October 1st to cram in some multiplayer for several early Assassin’s Creeds, the original version of Far Cry 3, Driver: San Francisco and others. Ubisoft say they’ve been “exploring what is possible to reduce disruption” over the last month, hence the shuffled date for decommissioning.

In any case, power supplies are important, mm&#x27;kay, and this 550W 80+ Gold modular one from Corsair is discounted here in the UK. Normally you&#x27;d expect to pay £78 for this model - and at least £65 for one of this spec from a notable brand - but at Currys you can combine a price reduction with the code FNDDGAMING to get this PSU delivered for only £40.

                              <span>After growing to become one of the most-leaked games in franchise history, Ubisoft has confirmed that Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage is real and we&#x27;ll be learning more about it next week.
That&#x27;s because the publisher is hosting a Ubisoft Forward on Sept. 10 at Noon P.T./3 p.m. ET, which has been previously advertised as the event where we&#x27;ll learn more about the future of Assassin&#x27;s Creed and more. It seems Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage will be the big highlight of the show, but it&#x27;s possible we learn more about Assassin&#x27;s Creed Infinity, which is Ubisoft&#x27;s in-development Assassin&#x27;s Creed live-service platform. We might even learn about non-Assassin&#x27;s Creed games, too. 
Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage is the next Assassin&#x27;s Creed game.

September 1, 2022
If rumors and leaks about Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage are correct, we&#x27;re in for a game set in Baghdad with Basim, a major character from Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla (if you know, you know), as the protagonist. Leaks indicate that he&#x27;s not yet an assassin at the start of Mirage and instead, a thief who comes to discover the Hidden Ones, which later become the Assassin&#x27;s order in the series. Rumors also point to this game being a much more stripped back take on the franchise, feeling more like older games in the series rather than the massive and sprawling open-world RPGs of late.
The potential for this to feel like a bridge between classic Assassin&#x27;s Creed and new Assassin&#x27;s Creed has me incredibly excited. I love the new games, especially Origins and Odyssey, but they&#x27;re downright exhausting. An Assassin&#x27;s Creed game I can beat in less than 80 hours? Sign me up!
In the meantime, read Game Informer&#x27;s ranking of every Assassin&#x27;s Creed game and then catch up on everything announced during the Assassin&#x27;s Creed 15th Anniversary Celebration stream that aired earlier this summer.

                              <span>Halo Infinite’s long-awaited campaign co-op will finally arrive on November 8 as part of the game’s big Winter Update. 343 Industries released a video today running down what it calls its largest content update yet, breaking down the Forge Beta, new multiplayer maps, and more. 


Online Campaign Co-Op
The biggest addition in the update finally goes live following a beta period in July. Campaign co-op, which supports up to four players, features cross-platform support, shared progression, mission replay, and a batch of new achievements. 
However, campaign co-op will be online only. 343 announced that it has chosen to cease development on local splitscreen co-op to reallocate those resources towards quickly implementing online updates and improvements based on player feedback.

                              <span>In a new blog post, Xbox head Phil Spencer discussed Microsoft’s intentions for Activision Blizzard’s IPs following its ongoing acquisition of the company. Among those plans, naturally, is to bolster the value of Xbox Game Pass by adding Activision Blizzard’s library of titles, including Call of Duty, Overwatch, and Diablo.
Spencer discusses expanding player choice through Game Pass by offering library titles for an affordable subscription fee, appealing to players of various budgets. Spencer hopes that including Activision Blizzard games will make the service more appealing to existing and potential subscribers. 
Spencer also reiterates Microsoft’s promise to keep popular Activision Blizzard franchises multiplatform, citing its handling of Minecraft as an example. Additionally, the company hopes to expand Activision’s portfolio to mobile platforms and make them available to play on other devices via cloud streaming. 
Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard is projected to be completed sometime during the summer of 2023. After that, it&#x27;s anyone’s guess as to how long it will be before we see these franchises land on Game Pass. On the Blizzard side, Overwatch 2 launches in free-to-play early access on October 4, and Diablo IV is seemingly years away. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II releases in October, but the series will reportedly skip 2023, meaning the first entry under the Microsoft banner won&#x27;t be until 2024 at the earliest.

Later in that same year, the studio revealed Deathpool, a second original character that imagined what a child of Deadpool and Death would look and act like.

                              <span>After growing in early access for two years, Ooblets finally sprouts in its 1.0 form today. The cheerful game blends monster collecting (the Ooblets), farming simulation, and light town management as you restore a wacky village to its former glory. Though an overall laid-back experience, there’s a lot of spinning plates involved, and it can take time to figure out how to maximize each day to keep your farm brimming with valuable crops, your roster full of different Ooblets, and your wallet stretched with Gummies (the game’s currency). That’s where I come in. I’ve spent many hours playing the final version of the game, and I’d like to offer some helpful tips to make your early hours in Badgetown as enjoyable and efficient as possible.

Endnight Games&#x27; post on Twitter (seen above) says, in recent months, an exact drop date has been hard to pinpoint, but the newfound scope led to the team&#x27;s hard decision:
Based on trailers, Sons of the Forest is the studio&#x27;s most ambitious title yet, with a vast open world, a new AI companion, updated visuals, and multiple warring factions scattered throughout the landscape. It looks to be even more brutal and terrifying than the last game, and I can&#x27;t wait to get my hands on it. 
Sons of the Forest splatters onto our screens next year, February 23, for PC.</span>

                              <span>Britská společnost ARM podala žalobu na jednoho ze svých největších partnerů, firmu Qualcomm. Ta vloni koupila za 1,4 miliardy dolarů společnost Nuvia a s ní převzala i vývoj procesoru Phoenix, do kterého se vkládají velké naděje. ARM ale tvrdí, že licence není přenositelná a s nákupem tedy automaticky nepřechází na Qualcomm.</span>

Těm, kdo se chystají stavět si novou mašinu, zbyde více peněz na hardwarové komponenty, nebo si budou moci koupit nějaké extra licence, které zprvu zavrhli.

                              <span>With the Apple M2 running Asahi Linux you may be wondering whether it&#x27;s better to use the GCC compiler as is the default on upstream Arch Linux or whether going for LLVM Clang will yield better performance given all the LLVM/Clang usage by AArch64 vendors, including Apple&#x27;s own Xcode compiler toolchain making use of it. If you are wondering about GCC vs. Clang for building binaries on the Apple M2, here are some benchmarks.</span>

Mark Vanstone has the code, straight from this month’s brand new edition of Wireframe magazine, out now. Most early games started out as coin-ops, but in 1984, Nintendo first released Excitebike on the NES. Later that year, Nintendo ported Excitebike to arcades […]

                              <span>The RX 6950 XT is AMD&#x27;s flagship card, a 4K gaming powerhouse that can put almost any game to shame - as long as you don&#x27;t turn on ray tracing, anyway. The card launched at £1100 but often sold for far more, but now we&#x27;re starting to see things slide the other way - and the top AMD GPU now costs only £800 at Overclockers in the UK. That&#x27;s £300 below RRP and a new low-water mark.

                              <span>Nightdive&#x27;s remake of 1994 classic System Shock hasn&#x27;t had the smoothest development run, first having some money issues in its Kickstarter a while back, then having to reboot itself with twenty-twenty-something release dates chucked out there more as hopeful concepts than assurances. 
Having gone hands-on with a short 20-minute-ish demo of the game at this year&#x27;s Gamescom, I can confirm that the remake is real and seems faithful to the original despite some heavy tinkers in the modernisation station. For nostalgic fans it should make for an exciting revisit to cyberspace, but I&#x27;m unsure whether it&#x27;ll land quite as well for newcomers seeking a showdown with Shodan.

                              <span>We&#x27;ve got a pretty good line in interesting folk traditions here at RPS. I grew up in a county where staying up all night at the stone circle to welcome the Summer Solstice was an annual tradition (later augmented by a woman wearing antlers offering a selection of downers and hallucinogens), and as a child I had an unnecessary encounter with the Salisbury Hob-Nob. For the past few years Alice0 has gone to the Burryman&#x27;s Parade, gracing us with pictures of that most wholesome gentleman. Rural traditions are fun if you&#x27;re part of them, but to outsiders they can be unsettling at best. 
This is relevant to my thinking about Saturnalia, an upcoming survival horror game by Italian studio Santa Ragione, where a small group of outsiders try to escape a village on the night of an ancient ritual. I&#x27;ve been playing a preview build of Saturnalia for the last week or so, and also got to talk about it with the studio director Pietro Righi Riva. &quot;I usually tell people, &#x27;Oh, you should make a game in like six months&#x27;, and I have tried to do that in the past,&quot; he tells me. &quot;This one just kind of got out of hand. I found an email yesterday, as I was looking for finishing the credits, about me discussing some story items in April 2017.&quot; And, while I am sure that most developers don&#x27;t wish they&#x27;d been making a video game in the middle of the pandemic, I think the extra time may have allowed Santa Ragione to make something excellent.

                              <span>Stranded: Alien Dawn is Haemimont Games’ second sci-fi sim on the trot, and despite being set on a planet that actually has air this time, it could well make Surviving Mars’ well-funded colony building feel like an afternoon playing with Lego. In Stranded, as I saw from a hands-off preview at Gamescom 2022, you’re certainly not planetside by choice, having crash-landed on an uncharted world with just four surviving astronauts left to scavenge, hunt and build their way towards something resembling a life.


“Like RimWorld”, I thought to myself upon hearing the pre-demo pitch, and subsequently wrote in my notes four separate times before ceasing to bother. If only mere words could convey just how much “like RimWorld” Stranded: Alien Dawn is – other 3D-ified clones exist, like last year’s Going Medieval, but here, even the exact spaceship-wrecking premise matches that of Ludeon Studios&#x27; seminal survival sim.

Katharine and Liam had a great time poking around PAX East back in April and we’re now making our way over to the west coast to make more exclusive videos for RPS premium supporters.
This time, Liam will be joined by myself (hello!) as we cover the show floor from top to bottom, from when the doors open on Friday, September 2nd until they boot everyone out the evening of Monday, September 25th. We’ll be interviewing developers, attending panels, and sharing our thoughts on the best upcoming games on the show floor.

It’s a collection of their many minigame interpretations of the classic single-player card game, solitaire. The Zachtronics Solitaire Collection releases on Steam on September 6th, and adds a new version themed around tarot decks. Each version of the card game has been updated with 4K graphics. Have a sneaky peek at the trailer below.

                              <span>I went into my High On Life hands-on session with one expectation: its talking alien guns will annoy the heck out of me. But in a surprising turn of events, I left thinking the game was a real highlight of my time in Cologne&#x27;s multi-hall maze of excellent people and overpriced schnitzel.
And most importantly, the guns didn&#x27;t annoy me at all! In fact, their craic contributed a great deal to my enjoyment of the strangest FPS I&#x27;ve played in a while - one where I was forever grinning at the screen like an idiot. If you&#x27;re a fan of Rick And Morty from before it got weird to be a fan of Rick And Morty (or Squanch Games&#x27; back catalogue, or general bizarro laughs), this is one for the wishlist.

                              <span>To make their victims more compliant, online scammers often imply that something of value is under threat if immediate action isn&#x27;t taken. Bank accounts are often mentioned but nothing is off limits. A scam currently doing the rounds warns of copyright strikes on genuine YouTube accounts, but after targeting a security researcher, the scam&#x27;s secrets are now public.

                              <span>In this segment of New Gameplay Today, your host, Game Informer Associate Editor Wesley LeBlanc, walks you through how Saturnalia works as both a survival horror game and a roguelike. In it, you&#x27;ll see him control Anita, one of the game&#x27;s many playable characters, as she searches for her partner in the small town of Sardinia, Italy.
Unfortunately for Anita, it&#x27;s not a great time to be in the town because of some strange ritualistic things happening. That translates to a terrifying creature that stalks Anita and others through the darkness of the night and you must avoid it all while remaining alive as you search for clues to end this night of terror and misery. 
In the New Gameplay Today segment below, we have more than 15 minutes of brand-new Saturnalia footage to showcase. Enjoy!


Saturnalia is being developed and published by Santa Ragione. It&#x27;s due out on PC exclusively via the Epic Games Store sometime this year. For more, check out the Saturnalia reveal trailer.</span>

Either way, it packs many enhancements over the base game. While I didn&#x27;t care much for Part I, if you&#x27;re interested in checking it out yourself, here are some of the biggest changes you can expect. 
Accessibility Options
The Last of Us Part I comes with Naughty Dog&#x27;s full suite of accessibility options. And that&#x27;s something worth commending. This comes in the shape of fully customizable controls, a host of visual aids, options to alleviate motion sickness, help with navigating levels, options for the deaf or hard-of-hearing, and combat accessibility.

                              <span>I remember the release of The Last of Us better than any other video game – which is to say I remember it at all. 
In 2013, I was 19 and still practicing the unfortunate act of pre-ordering video games before I knew if they were good or not. As misfortune had it, it came out while I was out of town, but my Dad went and picked it up from our local GameStop for me. Like an absolute dork, I remember spending weeks looking at the picture of the box he sent me, practically counting the nanoseconds until I could play it myself. 
And when I did, it was everything I could&#x27;ve hoped. I was admittedly a less savvy media viewer back then and truly believed its story was unlike anything else. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s true anymore – it pretty shamelessly borrows from Cormac McCarthy&#x27;s The Road, No Country F…</span>

Just today, Chinese developer-publisher NetEase announced it was acquiring Detroit: Become Human dev Quantic Dream, and now, Sony Interactive Entertainment and Tencent have increased their stakes in From Software, the prolific developer behind the Dark Souls series and this year’s mega-hit, Elden Ring. 
This news comes from Gematsu, which posted a press release from Kadokawa Corporation, the parent company behind From Software. It says that through third-party allotment, Sixjoy Hong Kong, a Tencent Holdings subsidiary, has purchased 16.25% of From Software’s shares, while SIE has acquired 14.09%. Despite this, Kadokawa Corporation is still the largest shareholder of From Software, holding 69.66% of the shares.

This news comes from a posting released by NetEase today that calls Quantic Dream its first studio in Europe. It’s unclear how much the acquisition cost NetEase, but the developer-publisher says it will allow the studio to continue to operate independently, focusing on creating and publishing games while supporting third-party developed titles too.

                              <span>Lead combat designers Mihir Sheth and Denny Yeh have over 17 years of God of War experience shared between them, and both played prominent roles in the previous game’s success. The series’ current direction is inspired by an old studio motto: Playing with your food.
“That’s an internal philosophy that we’ve had since back in the day,” Sheth says. “Kratos plays with his food. We tried to create systems you want to engage with that are fun, very playful, lots of different routes. And when we looked at the combat in the last game, we were like, ‘We can push this further; we can find new toys and ways of playing with enemies and strategies.’ That’s been the guiding principle more than anything else.”

                              <span>The Last Of Us Part I&#x27;s remake is heading to PlayStation 5 on September 2nd, which I assume is of modest interest if you want to play Joel and Ellie&#x27;s story over from the beginning with prettier graphics. It&#x27;s more interesting to us in PC land because it&#x27;ll be the first time the heart-and-zombie smasher makes its way to PC - albeit &quot;very soon&quot; after its console release.

Below, a new seven-minute clip of the remaster in action.

The long-in-development Grand Theft Auto 5 mod is a comprehensive revamp of lighting, textures, models and much more, but it remains faithful to the art direction of the base game. 

You can now download a Single Player Beta of the mod - and even if you don&#x27;t plan on doing that, it&#x27;s worth watching the trailer below.

                              <span>The Crucial P2 is a great value NVMe SSD, and now the 2TB model is down to £117 at Amazon UK - an incredibly low price for a drive that can hit 2400MB/s. The 1TB model has also been discounted in the same sale, from £86 to £63, making it cheaper than many SATA SSDs of the same size.

                              <span>The thrill of a card game is in the hand you get dealt. Luck can either be on your side, or you can earn it back by using your wits, carving out a victory you never thought possible. Other times, it all goes to pot and you get absolutely walloped, but hot damn if you didn&#x27;t go down fighting. ORX has these moments in spades. Part deckbuilder, part roguelike and part tower defence, this is a real-time strategy game played by the seat of your pants, where a rolling deck of cards determines not only what kind of defences you can build, but also what buffs, spells and additional forces you can deploy to help defend your keep from the oncoming hordes. It&#x27;s a gripping mix that&#x27;s already claimed over a dozen hours of my time in recent weeks, and it&#x27;s a number I can only see going up and up and up as it continues to develop in early access.

                              <span>While mooching around Samsung’s Gamescom booth, waiting for their 990 Pro SSD reveal, I took the opportunity to play with an altogether more unusual addition to their hardware catalogue. The Samsung Odyssey Ark, for the unfamiliar, is a kind of all-in-one entertainment screen: a mammoth 55in Mini LED panel that can act as a desktop gaming monitor or living room TV, complete with honking great speakers and built-in support for all the big game streaming services so you can play on it without a PC or console. Unlike other monitors of this magnitude, it can also rotate into portrait mode, leaving the top curve towering over you like an unsympathetic Victorian headmaster. 


I actually enjoy a touch of design madness creeping into the occasional piece of PC gear, regardless of whether it can hang with the best gaming monitors that sensible people might buy. What I experienced with the Odyssey Ark, however, was a device that too often veered onto the wrong side of senseless – when it was even working properly.

                              <span>Back in February, Alice O. highlighted an expansion planned for Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla that’s reportedly being spun-off into a standalone stealth game. At the time the project was being referred to as Rift, but multiple sources are now saying the game will be called Assassin’s Creed: Mirage. Both Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier and Giant Bomb’s Jeff Grubb say they’ve been told by people familiar with the game that Mirage is accurate.

Speaking of Nineties nostalgia, you can watch a retro trailer for MultiVersus below. Makes me feel ten again.

                              <span>I&#x27;m going to level with you: I&#x27;m not a GSG player. I play strategy, sure, but grand strategy has always been a bit beyond me. I&#x27;m a fundamentally un-grand person; I spend most days dressed like a 14-year-old fan of Tony Hawk, I do not like olives or scallops, and I&#x27;m unable to predict the consequences of actions if they exist outside of, say, a 12 month timeframe. A game like Victoria 3, where the whole point is making decisions that have country-wide effects and outcomes years in the future, is essentially operating in a different language to any I understand.
I&#x27;m trying to learn new languages, though, so it&#x27;s not an unwelcome challenge. The problem is that previewing Victoria 3 is quite an advanced level to dive in, the Paradox GSG equivalent of being a live translator for a UN summit when you&#x27;re only just about able to read the French version of The Famous Five. In a presentation before I and others were let loose on the better part of a week with the game, it was claimed that Victoria 3 is the best yet for onboarding newcomers, with a deep and detailed tutorial system. And to that I say: kinda. Luckily, the AI in Victoria 3 is so advanced it&#x27;s better at playing the game than I am.

                              <span>God of War Ragnarök is set to conclude the Norse era of the series, a saga that’s seen Kratos atone for his troubling past by becoming a more conscientious god and (mildly) affectionate father. In the upcoming sequel, Kratos and Atreus must stave off a preordained catastrophe, calling on old and new friends to succeed against Asgard and, hopefully, prevent all-out war.  
I spoke with God of War veteran and newly appointed director Eric Williams as well as some lead UX, combat, and level designers about their experience crafting the long-awaited sequel and the most significant changes coming to the action and exploration loops. Moreover, you’ll learn about Kratos’ tools/toys, a never-before-seen dwarven realm that feels lived in, the unprecedented number of accessibility features available …</span>

                              <span>Get your shovels ready because Shovel Knight Dig will burrow its way onto Switch, PC, and iOS via Apple Arcade next month. 
More specifically, the exciting Shovel Knight follow-up/spin-off title will hit those platforms on Sept. 23. What&#x27;s more is that if you have an Apple Arcade subscription, you can play the game for free. It&#x27;ll cost $24.99 on Switch and on Steam, however.
This news was revealed in a comical trailer released by Yacht Club Games, which you can watch for yourself below: 


&quot;When Drill Knight and his dastardly digging crew blast apart Shovel Knight&#x27;s peaceful campsite and steal his loot, he grabs his trusty Shovel Blade and starts tunneling after them,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;But as he and Shield Knight soon discover, this adventure goes much deeper than a simple heist.&quot;
&quot;Meet new friends and foes, visit strange lands, and outfit yourself in your quest to keep the entire land from collapsing underfoot. Jump, slash, and dig your way down an ever-changing chasm of mystery in Shovel Knight Dig, an all-new Shovel Knight adventure.&quot; 

While waiting to play Shovel Knight Dig on Sept. 23, read about Scrap Knight, a new character that will be featured in the game, and then watch the reveal trailer for the title.

But I can tell you that Sonic Frontiers is the first entry in the series I’ve been looking forward to since the Dreamcast.  
For reference, the last time I was excited to play a 3D Sonic game, it was attached to the Dreamcast kiosk at my local target. And to be fair, the orca jumping over the racetrack in the Sonic Adventure demo was a great reason to bug my mom for a new Sega console.

The case is being handled by the recently launched Copyright Claims Board.

                              <span>Gungrave G.O.R.E. marks the return of the Gungrave franchise after almost 20 years (well, besides that VR game), and today we found out that the sequel is coming just in time for Thanksgiving. A new cinematic trailer shown during Gamescom reveals a November release date, and it runs down the wacky cast of characters and why you&#x27;ll be riddling them with bullets. 
The largely CG trailer sprinkles in a bit of in-game action, though you should check out this previous gameplay video for a better taste of the over-the-top combat. We’re introduced to Grave’s allies who band together to take on a fearsome foursome of antagonists looking to rule the world (probably). Fans of the PS2 games and the anime that spawned from them will be happy to know that G.O.R.E. looks as bombastic and absurd as they&#x27;d expect. Newcomers that enjoy bullets, blood, and insanity will likely feel right at home. 


Gungrave G.O.R.E. launches November 22 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Pre-ordering nets you a special Grim Reaper skin designed by former Tango Gameworks designer Ikumi Nakamura, who is working on G.O.R.E. as a character artist.</span>

                              <span>Mafia celebrates its 20th anniversary today, and in a new blog post by Hanger 13, the principal minds behind the series reflect on its creation and history while also teasing what’s next.
Longtime Mafia designers Roman Hladík (general manager), Tomáš Hřebíček (head of production/media director), and Alex Cox (game director) sat down to discuss Mafia’s entire history and their most cherished memories of the franchise. It’s worth a read if you consider yourself a diehard fan (check it out here), but the most exciting news from the conversation is the confirmation that the next game in the series is in development.
Hřebíček writes: 
“A few years away” is a long time to wait, especially since the last mainline entry, Mafia III, is approaching six years old, launching in October 2016. But we&#x27;re happy to see the series continue and are curious to see where it heads next. In 2020, Hanger 13 released enhanced remasters of all three games, the most substantial being a complete remake of the original dubbed Mafia: Definitive Edition.

                              <span>Netflix has reportedly canceled its Resident Evil series after just one season. 
This news comes from a report from Deadline, which reports that Netflix has decided not to move forward with a second season of the show following the release of Season 1 last month. As far as why, there’s no official reason as of yet but considering Netflix’s past, it’s likely that Resident Evil didn’t meet expectations in terms of both critical and audience response. The show will now join many other shows canceled after just one season at the streamer including Cowboy Bebop, The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance, and more.
Deadline notes that Resident Evil’s release came right after the highly anticipated Season 4 of Stranger Things, which might have led to its less-than-stellar first weekend on the service. However, the series still debuted in the number two spot, behind Stranger Things, pulling in 72.7 million watch hours. Deadline reports that viewers watched Resident Evil for 73.3 million hours in its second week, taking the number three spot on Netflix, before dropping out of Netflix’s Top 10 by week three. 
This isn’t Netflix’s first foray into the world of Resident Evil, though. Its 2021 movie, Resident Evil Infinite Darkness, holds that title, but that anime series wasn’t well-received either. For more about the series, check out this retrospective video that looks back at 25 years of Resident Evil.

There’s something about the memory of that taste that is amazing, even if you know the sophistication of your palette has evolved a lot in the intervening years. That’s a bit how I feel about the early Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles games. I can recall with crystal clarity being gathered around a TMNT arcade cabinet with my friends, pumping in tokens to try and beat Shredder before the birthday party ended. Or spending a weekend banging my head against the wall of the first NES game and its absurd sewer challenges. The Cowabunga Collection exists to service the nostalgic recollection of these types of experiences, and it does so with aplomb. Are these truly great games worth …</span>

You’ve likely heard of Lies Of P after it took the internet by storm after Gamescom Opening Night Live. If you haven’t, I’ll quickly catch you up to speed: it’s a Pinocchio-themed Soulsborne.
You play as the iconic marionette fighting to become human in a fictional French city inspired by the historic Belle Époque era – a time of abundant affluence for the country. Familiar characters like Geppetto, Pinnochio’s creator and father figure, and Gemini Cricket help familiarize the story, but Lies Of P promises intriguing twists through a dark reimagining.

Endless Dungeon, the successor to 2014’s Dungeon of The Endless, is a tower defense twin-stick shooter created by French developer Amplitude Studios; and after my hands-on session at Gamescom 2022, it has the potential to be the next big roguelite. 
Interestingly, this upcoming roguelite is more a reimagining than a sequel. Instead of the point-and-click navigation and automated combat featured in the first game, players now directly control characters and weapons in real-time. Endless Dungeon reimagines its predecessor’s pixel art dungeons into larger, gorgeously-lit 3D spaces. Also, up t…</span>

                              <span>Let’s rock, baby! Season 6 of Video Gameography gets stylish as we examine the Devil May Cry series! Over the next few weeks, we’ll be covering the history and lore of Capcom’s premiere action franchise. On this episode, we&#x27;ll say &quot;Jackpot&quot; to Season 6 as we conclude with the latest title in the series, Devil May Cry 5.
Released March 8, 2019, Devil May Cry 5 serves as a return to the classic timeline after an over-decade-long hiatus. Nero reprises his starring role, but he&#x27;s joined by Dante and mysterious newcomer V. The three demon slayers, alongside familiar allies, unite to combat a powerful demon lord. Longtime DMC director Hideaki Itsuno wanted to hit a &quot;homerun&quot; with the title after realizing he may not have many games left in him, so he went all out. That includes adopting Capcom&#x27;s…</span>

                              <span>Drinkbox Studios’ Nobody Saves The World is getting a shot in the arm via a new expansion arriving next month. Dubbed Frozen Heath, this update adds new forms, challenges, and a fresh region to explore.
Frozen Hearth takes place in an underground region that hosts The Tempering, a series of trials consisting of combat challenges and puzzles. Overcoming this contest rewards two new forms: the Killer Bee and the Mechanic, which can be used in the main game. 


On September 13 you can buy the Frozen Hearth expansion separately for $4.99 or pick up it alongside the main game in a bundle for $27.99.  
Nobody Saved the World launched in January and became one of our early favorites of 2022. Former editor John Carson scored the game an 8.25 out of 10, writing in his review that, 
“Despite its minor shortcomings, Nobody Saves the World kept me enthralled from start to finish as I leveled my way through form ranks for the next body or ability to work with. It&#x27;s most fun when unleashing devious yet approachable combat scenarios, keeping me on my toes to find the best solution to survive. Thankfully, it gave me plenty of those unrelenting loops throughout, justifying the time to save this funny little world.”</span>

                              <span>Team Ninja’s dark fantasy action title Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty impresses in a new gameplay trailer that captures the fast-paced thrills you&#x27;d expect from the minds behind Nioh and Ninja Gaiden. 
Fans of the studio&#x27;s previous action titles should find plenty to love with Wo Long if this video is any indication. Set during the Three Kingdoms era of China, you&#x27;ll battle invading demons as a soldier using a blend of graceful swordplay and Chinese martial arts based on the Five Phases philosophy. The trailer shows off the many demonic foes awaiting your blade, including a bipedal tiger that is swiftly kicked out of the way by the protagonist. 


Next month, those attending Tokyo Game Show will be the first to play Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty via a show floor demo. Everyone else will have to wait until early 2023 to experience the game on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. It will also be available on Xbox Game Pass at launch.</span>

                              <span>Yesterday, Sony Interactive Entertainment announced it will increase the price of PlayStation 5 consoles in various non-U.S. territories due to global economic conditions such as inflation. Microsoft then declared later that day that it will not be doing the same with the Xbox Series X/S. Now, Nintendo has chimed in on the matter. 
In a statement to Eurogamer, Nintendo reiterates a quote from president Shuntaro Furukawa, made in June, in which he stated the company has &quot;no plans to increase the trade price of its hardware.” Furukawa made this statement during the 82nd Annual General Meeting Shareholders that month, in which he also said: 
&quot;While we cannot comment on pricing strategies, we currently do not have any plans to change the price of our hardware due to inflation or increased procurement costs in each country. We will determine our future pricing strategies through careful and continued deliberations.”
Although the PlayStation 5&#x27;s price will remain unchanged in the U.S. (for now), both versions of the console have become more expensive in Canada, Europe, the UK, Mexico, Japan, and Australia. The price hikes have already gone into effect in those regions except Japan, which occurs on September 15. 
The only time Nintendo significantly adjusted the price of its current consoles was last fall, when it permanently reduced the cost of the standard Switch model in the UK and Europe. Nintendo has yet to do the same in the U.S.

                              <span>Soldier Boyz is the newest supported game of the Hypno engine, and it’s ready for public testing!
Released in 1997 by Hypnotix and published by DreamCatcher Interactive and MCPA Interactive, this full-motion rail shooter is based on the 1995 film of the same name. The game starts when the daughter of an American billionaire is kidnapped by a group of Vietnamese terrorists. Then, it’s up to Major Howard Toliver, ex-Marine and highly decorated Vietnam veteran, to gather a deadly team for the dangerous mission of rescuing her. He recruits six prison inmates serving life sentences for a chance at a full presidential pardon.
Keep the body count rising to survive five territories by playing as each Soldier Boy (and Girl),
but beware and don’t waste a “friendly” since they provide vital survival information!
ScummVM currently supports the English release of the game (which is the only one we know about) and features more responsive controls than the original. We couldn&#x27;t find a demo but there is a trailer. Please contact us if you have a demo or any other release.
To play the game with ScummVM, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.
