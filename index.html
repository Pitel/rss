                              <span>In 2015 a flight by Germanwings carrying 144 passengers and six crew crashed into a mountain in the French Alps. Later, the authorities who investigated the crash judged it was intentional - somebody in the cockpit had purposefully crashed the plane in an act of suicide, killing themselves and everyone on board. Mouthwashing begins with the same premise, albeit in a sci-fi setting. You&#x27;re piloting a spaceship with a crew of five, clicking on its various controls to override the safety and turn the ship towards a nearby heap of space rock. You mean to crash. The words that appear moments before this sequence are chilling in their simplicity: &quot;I hope this hurts.&quot;

The studio is owned by Bandai Namco and released the game about a month ago. The exact number of people out of work isn&#x27;t known, as Reflector haven&#x27;t made a public statement about it. But among those affected are folks working in art, design, UI, lighting, and narrative.

Remember back in September when Warner Bros. revealed the first trailer for the Minecraft Movie and everyone lost their minds because it didn&#x27;t look great? Well, the second full-length trailer is now here and it looks... better? We guess.
Prepare yourselves, folks, it looks like the live-action adaptation will feature some Steve lore. The trailer kicks off with a peek at Steve&#x27;s backstory — &quot;As a child, I yearned for the mines&quot;, heh — showing us how Jack Black&#x27;s protagonist got to the blocky world in the first place. At least, it kinda explains it. There&#x27;s only so much realism you can pour into a product like Minecraft at the end of the day.

We checked for more codes.




In SU, playing on private servers is the only way to play certain game modes and fully customize your experience. However, they aren&#x27;t cheap, and instead of creating one, you can join a server that already exists. To do that, you&#x27;ll need the Shonen Unleashed private server codes we listed right below.

Keep in mind that whoever enters a private server in case it&#x27;s empty gets to be the admin of it until the owner of the PS enters it.

                              <span>If rumors are to be believed, the FC Pro Live promo is returning to EA FC 25, and the entire team has been supposedly leaked online.


This promo made its Ultimate Team debut last year, and it seems to be returning this time before the start of the FC Pro Open. EA Sports has remained tight-lipped, and as of this writing, there&#x27;s no hint about which campaign is coming next after Track Stars. However, the rumors have shed light on which footballers might be getting special cards as part of the upcoming promo.


Complete list of EA FC 25 FC Pro Live player leaks


Here are all the cards that are expected to be part of the upcoming promo. (Leak courtesy @AsyFutTrader)



Sam Morsy


Lorenzo Insigne


Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain


Jérôme Roussillon


Emil Forsberg


Nathan Aké


Nawaf Al Abed


Stian Gregersen


Gabriel Jesus


Exequiel Palacios


Igor Silva


Xavi Simons


Hassan Tombakti


Ryan Gravenberch


Sacha Boey


Ramon Hendriks


Fábio Carvalho


Jamie Bynoe-Gittens


Federico Redondo


Karim Benzema


Wout Weghorst


Sofyan Amrabat


Victor Osimhen


Ferdi Kadıoğlu



If the FC Pro Live promo works in the same fashion this year, all the items will be live cards. In simpler words, they will be recipients of stat, playstyle, and, potentially, role upgrades in the future. The cards will be represented by the athletes who are going to participate in the FC Pro Open tournament.


While a bulk of the items arrived in packs last year, a few of them were also released as SBCs. The same pattern could be followed once gained, and it will be interesting to find out more about the promo in the upcoming days.

                              <span>Fishing is one of the several activities you can engage in in Towers of Aghasba, and it is relatively easy once you have the right equipment.


Unlike activities like getting a mount for your adventures, fishing can be activated pretty early. In fact, fishing in Towers of Aghasba is pretty similar to hunting, and both activities will help you to find some important ingredients. Let&#x27;s take a look at how you can become an expert angler in the game.


How to get your fishing tools in Towers of Aghasba


For some strange reason, there&#x27;s no fishing rod available in the game. That could change in the future as the early access gets more content, but it seems rather unlikely. In fact, you&#x27;ll have to use a bow and flint spear.

How to feed animals food in Towers of Aghasba


In order to feed animals, there are a couple of simple steps you must first take note of. The first thing you need to do is Observe the animal you want to feed. This is done by utilizing the Shimuscope and using it to look at a creature. Doing so will reveal a few important traits about them, including what they like to eat. Keep this in mind as it is important.

Once you know what a creature prefers for substance, it&#x27;s time to prep their meal. Early on, you&#x27;ll be using food you find on the ground like Berries …</span>

1. Prince Of Persia: The Lost Crown

Things are looking bleak for Ubisoft right now, but that doesn&#x27;t mean the company hasn&#x27;t been putting out bangers - you just need to look away from that treacherous AAA space. Prince Of Persia&#x27;s latest outing is both a tribute to the series&#x27; early days and one of the most modern and addictive games of recent times. It&#x27;s an excellent title and, at a ridiculously high discount of 70%, you just shouldn&#x27;t ignore it&#x27;s fantastic price tag of $14.97. There are a lot of goo…</span>

                              <span>Towers of Aghasba is now available on early access, but a few players have reported a couple of issues that are preventing them from enjoying the content.


Bugs and glitches are common with early access titles, and some of them, like in the current instance, can be quite groundbreaking. While some players can&#x27;t log in to enjoy the game, others, like me, have ended up with a black screen after starting the game. Thankfully, the community seems to have developed a solution for the problems (worked for me).


Towers of Aghasba Black Screen error fix


The black screen error is just an extension of the can&#x27;t log in issue, as you can&#x27;t join the server if you don&#x27;t get to play the game. Thankfully, I came across this solution in the reviews section, and it seems to have worked (at least for now).



Go to your Steam library.


Open the Properties for Towers of Aghasba.


Go to the Installed Files folder.


Run the game&#x27;s exe file from the file that contains the installed files.



To solve the black screen issue, here&#x27;s what you have to do.



Go to the launch options and add the following segment: &quot;-dx11&quot;.


Launch the game, and it should run without any of the two errors that the players have encountered.

With that said, there are minor bugs and glitches that have been mentioned in the review section. It&#x27;s safe to assume that you might still be unable to enjoy all the content unless a couple of post-launch patches are released by Dreamlit. Hopefully, that&#x27;ll make the client far more stable, allowing all of us to enjoy the mysterious lands in Towers of Aghasba.

How to get the Shimuscope


You will automatically receive the Shimuscope by completing the Establish Our First Village quest in Towers of Aghasba and then speaking to Pawel who relocates into the new farming village you&#x27;ve built. Once you speak with Pawel, he will mention the Shimuscope and then give you one.

                              <span>Towers of Aghasba&#x27;s map might feel a bit restrictive during early access, but it&#x27;s still quite expansive, and you&#x27;ll want to get a mount to make your life easier.


In case you&#x27;re wondering, a mount will automatically reduce your traveling time a lot, and it&#x27;s available for everyone. But you&#x27;ll have to progress a bit more since the creature can&#x27;t be found on Amani Island. You&#x27;ll have to complete a fair bit of quests to unlock a side mission, which leads you toward getting your first mount in early access.


How to unlock your mount in Towers of Aghasba


To access your mount, you&#x27;ll want to gain access to the A Mount for your Troubles side mission. You can get this mission at the south of the Midrath Town portal, but for that, you&#x27;ll need to repair the broken bridge.



First, travel to the Midrath Isles. You can do this by just advancing through the main quest.


Keep completing all the missions till you&#x27;re required to repair the broken bridge, which is mandatory to connect the main island with Amani Island.


Along the way, you&#x27;ll complete several smaller quests that require specific resources.


The A Mount for your Troubles side mission is a similar mission, and you&#x27;ll have to repair the Midrath Stable.





For this quest, you&#x27;ll need two resources in the following quantities - 6x Thatch and 8x Wood. It&#x27;s better to carry both resources along with you to Midrath. In case you didn&#x27;t just travel back to Amani Island, chop down some trees, and scour through the bushes. That will get you all the resources that you need to complete the quest.


Once completed, you&#x27;ll unlock your first mount - a Harelope. It&#x27;s unclear if you&#x27;ll be able to get more creatures in the future. Additionally, if you&#x27;re on a PC and choose to buy the game/have already purchased the game by December 19, there will be an exclusive skin waiting for your mount.

                              <span>Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet came out in 2022 and still are the most recent mainline entries in the Pokémon franchise. However, and despite all the people that heavily criticized them for it&#x27;s glaring technical issues, these games were apparently a big commercial success, especially in Japan.


According to Famitsu (and confirmed later by Serebii.net) The Pokémon Company recently revealed the total sales numbers of Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet in Japan. With over 8.3 million units sold, the Generation 9 games broke a 28-year-old record and surpassed Pokémon Red &amp; Green in sales, ultimately becoming the best-selling Pokémon games of all time in its home country.

One of them, Essence Drop, is particularly useful for a particular crafted set of furniture. 


The problem with Essence Drop, is that it is a drop from only one monster within the Mines, so you might have a hard time stocking up on it to begin with. However, once you’ve unlocked the necessary levels of the Mines, you’ll be able to go down and farm for the resource pretty easily.

Not in a way that you’re likely to miss it, but it’s totally possible to make it more complicated by overthinking things. If you’re ever going to get a ship in Portoga, you need the Magic Key, and this is how you get it.


The Magic Key is a key (heh) requirement to even getting to Portoga. If you want to head directly West from Romaria and continue the story, you’re going to need it. The Magic Key is located in the Pyramids North of Ibis. To get there, you go East from Romaria, across the bridge, then south. You’ll hit the town of Asham, then head West.

Min. 1 Players from: Ligue 1 McDonald&#x27;s


Min. 1 Players: Team of the Week


Min. Team Rating: 81



Task 2 - Top Form



Min. 1 Players: Team of the Week


Min. Team Rating: 82



EA FC 25 Zuriko Davitashvili Ligue 1 POTM SBC solutions


Here is a set of solutions you  can use to complete this SBC for cheap. 


Task 1 - Ligue 1



Any 9 81-rated cards


Any 80-rated TOTW item


Jonathan David 81



Task 2 - Top Form



Any 10 82-rated items


Any 81-rated TOTW item



EA Sports has clearly missed the mark with this SBC, and they could have made the card have better stats. The POTM item has four different roles and the Flair+ playstyle. It also has high pace (94), but falls short elsewhere. The completion cost isn&#x27;t exactly cheap due to the need for two TOTW items. 


If you decide to complete the challenge, you&#x27;ll want to hope for an upcoming evolution that lets you upgrade the item. Otherwise, it&#x27;s better to save your resources for a future SBC, rather than spend them on this one.

                              <span>I really wish Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake was released in a different month (absolutely any other would do). If I hadn’t already pushed through multiple 20-50 hour games in the past few weeks, I probably would have been prepared for it, but I’m out of push. There’s no way I could burn the midnight oil to get a review ready in any reasonable timeframe.


I settled on playing as much as I could and giving my impressions instead. I played through the four NES titles in the Dragon Quest series (Dragon Warrior as they were at the time here in North America) a few years ago, and Dragon Quest 3 was my least favorite of the bunch. I recognize its immense reputation in Japan, and even over here, but it wasn’t the one for me.


So, I was sort of lukewarm about the prospect of Dragon Quest III HD-2…</span>

                              <span>One of the more important resources you&#x27;ll need early on when building things in Towers of Aghasba is Resin. However, if you&#x27;re not sure where to look, it can be ab it tricky hunting down and gathering enough of it to get anything down. Here is how to get Resin in Towers of Aghasba and what it&#x27;s used for.





Where to get Resin


You can acquire Resin in Towers of Aghasba by harvesting Resin Fir Trees. However, when you first start the game, there are no natural Resin Fir Trees. To unlock them, you need to first climb up the nearby rocky outcropping and speak to Pawel. He will then give you a seed for a Colossal Tree also known as the King Tree. 


Head at least 100m away from the farming village post you put down, and you will be able to plan the Colossal Tree. Make sure it&#x27;s in the Temp…</span>

                              <span>2024 has been a rough year for fans of the Kingdom Hearts franchise. Not only has Square Enix released no further updates on Kingdom Hearts IV, but the upcoming mobile game Missing Link has completely disappeared after the launch of its Closed Beta, even though it was originally going to come out sometime this year.




In a bittersweet turn of events, the company behind this popular franchise finally let fans know what happened with Kingdom Hearts: Missing Link. The game&#x27;s official Twitter/X account released a statement, finally confirming that Square Enix delayed its release. Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t reveal any more information, so Missing Link&#x27;s release date is currently unknown. Nevertheless, we are 100% sure that it won&#x27;t launch in 2024, so it&#x27;s most likely going to come out sometime …</span>

To prepare you for this change-up, here&#x27;s when to expect Gray Zone Warfare&#x27;s first progress wipe, including details on the latest update.


GZW first progress wipe release date and expected changes


Gray Zone Warfare&#x27;s progress wipe begins on Nov. 27, 2024, the launch date of its Night Ops update. This restart will help lay the foundation for the new changes, making the transition more manageable. The only downside is you&#x27;ll need to start from scratch again, regardless of how much time you&#x27;ve put into the game. That means you&#x27;re basically…</span>

Should you use Bullet Velocity or Damage Range in Black Ops 6?


Before answering the question in the headline, it is imperative that you understand exactly what Bullet Velocity and Damage Range additions do to your gun. This way, when I give you the answer, you understand the nuance behind it. Let&#x27;s start by defining both these terms.

However, among some expected choices like Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth or Astro Bot, there was a peculiar one that stood out: Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree.




This is because Shadow of the Erdtree is actually a DLC campaign for Elden Ring, and not a full new game. This was not a complete surprise, however. A few days ago, people found out that the official Game Awards site stated that, for the first time ever, DLCs and Expansion Packs were going to be eligible for all categories, so the theory that they were only allowing this in order to nominate Shadow of the Erdtree became more and more common.

                              <span>Farming Simulator 25 is a new game launched by GIANTS Software. Just like any new game, it is also prone to bugs and errors. One such bug is found where the Multiplayer server is stuck at 99 percent. 


If you&#x27;re encountering the same problem, don’t worry, I have got you covered. This article will provide you with all the possible fixes for the Multiplayer server stuck at 99 percent bug in Farming Simulator 25.

Check server status


First off, you have to make sure that it’s not an issue with the server itself. Sometimes the servers could be down for maintenance or have other issues. In that case, you can try restarting the game to see if this fixes things. Yes, I&#x27;m saying switch it off and back on. No, I have never worked in IT support, why do you ask? 


In case this doesn’t work, try changing your server.


Update your game


The game often releases minor updates to fix bugs and errors. Make sure to update the game, as an outdated version can also cause issues with connecting.


Verify the integrity of the game


If you are on PC, you can verify the integrity of the game just in case it is installed incorrectly. If you have purchased the game from Steam, then follow these steps:



Step 1: Open Steam and go to Library.


Step 2: Right-click on Farming Simulator 25.


Step 3: Now head to properties.


Step 4: Click on the ‘Installed Files’ tab.


Step 5: Once the tab is opened, click on the ‘Verify Integrity of Game Files’ button.



If you have purchased the game from the Epic Games Store, then follow these steps:



Step 1: Just open the Epic Games Store.


Step 2: Click on the three dots that are next to the game.


Step 3: Select the “Manage” sub-menu.


Step 4: Now click on the “Verify” button.

3D puzzles are definitely aimed more at adults than kids, due to the amount of frustration and fiddly construction that needs to happen when putting them together. However, just because this is a list for grown-ups, it doesn’t mean that you can’t drag the younger generation into the wonderful hobby that is 3D puzzling.

                              <span>The latest update for Sony’s surprisingly good PlayStation Portal adds the feature that people have been wanting since even before the handheld gaming device launched last year.

Indications that Brazil is already testing piracy blocking measures at the internet&#x27;s core routers is controversial, but if blocking is accurate and only targets pirate sites, criticism may be limited. With a new 250+ domain blocking wave implemented this week, let&#x27;s take a closer look at how things play out.

                              <span>A new survey from Norway reveals that 50% of young people under 30 believe that pirating content is an acceptable way to save money.  The survey, conducted by Ipsos, highlights that the high cost of streaming services is a key driver behind this attitude.  Links between piracy and organized crime or malware, appear to be of less concern.

Well, here&#x27;s a sentence that we never thought we&#x27;d be writing: we spent the weekend playing the latest Horizon entry on Switch. Yes, LEGO Horizon Adventures has let Aloy and co. out of the Sony playground and onto Nintendo systems for the first time, and now it&#x27;s your chance to let us know what you make of it.
The game launched last week, shrinking the action-adventure series into the brick-based shenanigans we&#x27;d expect from a LEGO title. There&#x27;s approachable combat, light-hearted comedy, heaps of customisation and (rather surprisingly) it&#x27;s all wrapped up in a visually stunning package on Switch.

If you&#x27;ve been a part of the Nintendo gaming community for a while, then chances are you&#x27;re well acquainted with &#x27;DK Rap&#x27;, the charming introductory theme tune seen in 1999&#x27;s Donkey Kong 64. It&#x27;s gained significant notoriety and love over the years, though many fans do concede that the song isn&#x27;t actually that good.
Well, it&#x27;s good now, folks. Almost 25 years after its debut, DK Rap has been remade, courtesy of original composer Grant Kirkhope and rapper Substantial, bringing it fully up to date, albeit with one eye firmly on the past. Indeed, one commenter on the YouTube video said it had been given the &#x27;3rd Strike&#x27; treatment, and we have to agree with this assessment.

We knew that it would only be a matter of time, but it seems it&#x27;s finally official. According to Famitsu, Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet has become Japan&#x27;s best-selling Pokémon game of all time.
According to the Japanese outlet, ScaVi has shifted an impressive 8.3 million copies domestically to date, finally pushing it ahead of Pokémon Red and Green. The OGs have held the top spot for the best part of 30 years, so it only seems fair that someone else gets a turn in the spotlight.

Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket, the new mobile app taking the world by storm, has reportedly generated a total of $120.8 million since its initial launch on 30th October 2024 – that&#x27;s an awful lot of Poké Gold!
As reported by PocketGamer (thanks, GamesIndustry), TCG Pocket is averaging out at around $6.4 million in player spending daily, leading to what is undoubtedly an impressive total after just three weeks on the market.

Earlier this year, the Switch emulator Yuzu was shut down after being caught in the fiery gaze of the great eye of Nintendo. A follow-up based on the same source code, Suyu, appeared shortly after, though it unsurprisingly met the same fate. Now, over eight months on, there&#x27;s another new kid on the block (thanks, Overkill).
Citron is the latest Yuzu fork, now available in early access on Android. According to AndroidAuthority.com, the Switch emulator is much the same as its predecessor, with a couple of &quot;minor upgrades and optimisations&quot; to keep things slightly distinct.

Goodboy Galaxy Ltd., the developer and publisher behind – you guessed it – Goodboy Galaxy, has confirmed it has ended its contract with physical distributor First Press Games.
The latter has been offering up physical bundles of the title on Game Boy Advance, though has been running into frequent significant delays culminating in a blog post lamenting &quot;broken promises&quot; by its printing partners. It&#x27;s currently not known whether this issue has directly led to the decision from Goodboy Galaxy Ltd. to end its contract with First Press Games, but we have reached out directly for more information.

A new report from Reuters has emerged that reveals Sony is potentially in talks to purchase Kadokawa, a Japanese media conglomerate that serves as parent to dozens of entertainment companies.
In the gaming space, Kadokawa owns Spike Chunsoft, Acquire, Gotcha Gotcha Games, and FromNetworks, while also owning a majority stake in FromSoftware alongside Tencent and Sony. We imagine that FromSoftware is proving particularly attractive for Sony, since the studio is responsible for the likes of Elden Ring, Bloodborne, Dark Souls, and the Armored Core franchise.

Wasn&#x27;t the first game an action-RPG? True, it was a third-person shooter, but it also had a progression system with unlockable abilities and boosts. Besides, isn&#x27;t every action game an action-RPG these days? Levelling-up has become an industry-wide syndrome. Go on, name an action game that doesn&#x27;t have RPG-style elements. No wait, don&#x27;t actually do that. I was being rhetorical. Read the rest of this post first.

And yet, I persevered, booting it back up and returning to my government-mandated shift atop a quiet mountain.
Ultimately, I gave Threshold chance after chance because I was totally taken by my shift and my immense desire to find out just what I was actually doing. Anyway, it&#x27;s time for me to clock off! I urge you to take over until I&#x27;m back. It&#x27;s worth it.

These broadly consist of combat and balance overhauls together with changes for the Skirmish &amp; War Games modes, though they&#x27;ve shown the campaign a little love as well.

                              <span>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 launches on Steam and the Microsoft Store today. Developed once again by Asobo - otherwise celebrated for their stinking rat hordes - it builds upon the 2020 game by &quot;[taking] advantage of the latest technologies in simulation, cloud, machine learning, graphics and gaming&quot;, in the words of the launch announcement release.
We&#x27;ve got a review in the works, but code has landed late, so our write-up might take a while. In the shorter term, I thought you might like to know how, exactly, MFS 2024 makes use of &quot;machine learning&quot; technologies, taking into account the energy cost of such wacky gadgetry and the creeping relationship between increased reliance on automated tools and laying people off. More immediately, you might like to know how much of your internet package it&#x27;ll devour as you play.

                              <span>A long while ago I wrote about Vampire Survivors-likes needing to stop overwhelming you with visual clutter. I&#x27;ve since played a few games of a similar ilk that don&#x27;t hammer you with a chaos that&#x27;s impossible to dissect with your eyeballs. One of these is Bloodshed, an old school FPS take on the VS formula that actually works pretty well and did have me thinking the treacherous phrase &quot;just one more run&quot;.

                              <span>I am a very casual enjoyer of Metal Slug games. I&#x27;ve never actually paid for one of these side-scrolling shoot &#x27;em ups, except for all the countless coins I happily pumped into arcade machines as a child. To this day, if I see a rare glittering cabinet running one of these crunchy shmups, I will go ham for twenty or thirty minutes, and walk away satisfied that I have seen a lot of very good pixels. These games, I am convinced, were never really designed to be completed, but to be played exactly like this, as a coin-gobbling invitation to become a bandana-wearing sisyphus, a tiny Rambo pushing a bouncy, juddering tank up a hill occupied by cartoon nazis. You die a bunch and say: &quot;ah, that was good.&quot;
So what happens when you rearrange the molecules of this run and/or gun &#x27;em up into an isometric turn-based strategy game? You get Metal Slug Tactics, an off-kilter nod to Into The Breach and other grid-based turn-takers, but secretly housing the aggressive notions of an unhinged pyromaniac. You still die a lot. And you still walk away feeling fairly happy about it.

                              <span>Good morning, how about a nice big bowl of your favourite breakfast cereal: Corporate Consolidation? Sony are in talks to buy Kadokawa, the parent company of Elden Ring developer From Software. Sony is eyeing up the company as a hefty snack because they want the various manga and anime owned by Kadokawa, according to a report by Reuters. But also because they want all the tasty games owned by them too, such as the Danganronpa series, the Octopath Traveler games, and the biggest corn flake of them all, the Dark Souls series.

Musi hoped for a swift reinstatement through a preliminary injunction, but Apple believes the court should deny the request. The tech giant argues that the delisting is allowed under its developer contract, stressing that the removal was not an impulsive decision.

A direct warning that personal details could be handed over by Telegram coincides with some piracy groups abandoning the platform.

Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet is celebrating its two-year anniversary with a bumper list of in-game events, all of which culminate in the arrival of shiny Rayquaza, which you&#x27;ll be able to get for a limited time via Tera Raid Battles.
The black-coloured Rayquaza will be available in Scarlet &amp; Violet from 20th December 2024 to 5th January 2025, but you&#x27;ll have to take it down and capture it in a 5-Star Tera Raid Battle. That&#x27;s not before a whole slew of events taking place in Paldea, Kitakami, and the Blueberry Academy, however.

                              <span>Dead good.
Going into Carpathian Night Starring Bela Lugosi, there was an undeniable fear that this would be a cheap, throwaway knock-off of Konami’s Castlevania series; one that we’d rinse in a single sitting before casting it aside for the real deal. Instead, we were treated to an incredibly well-crafted game that can easily stand toe-to-toe with the likes of Bloodstained: Curse of the Moon as a worthy homage to one of the most respected franchises in gaming history.
Taking inspiration primarily from the ‘classic’ &#x27;Vanias, Carpathian Night sees you traverse a total of 12 linear stages as either Abbot Dorin or Irina Dracul. The former wields a spear in a similar fashion to Castlevania: Bloodlines&#x27; Eric Lecarde, while the latter prefers the iconic whip. Whichever you choose, their basic eight-way directional attacks feel quite similar, though they each boast unique abilities obtained by collecting green gems littered throughout the stages.

Believe it or not, Donkey Kong Country for the SNES has turned 30 years old after originally launching in the UK on 18th November 1994.
Often regarded as one of the greatest platformers of all time, Donkey Kong Country was the first in an SNES trilogy from developer Rare, and was really the game that properly kickstarted a fruitful relationship between Nintendo and the UK-based studio. Although it has arguably been eclipsed by the likes of Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy&#x27;s Kong Quest and Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze, it nevertheless remains a firm fan favourite.

                              <span>It takes a special kind of entitled bellyacher to complain that you wanted a different game from a game that hasn&#x27;t even been announced yet, and which may simply be an internet rumour. It&#x27;s like the &quot;glass half empty&quot; mindset, but the bartender hasn&#x27;t even taken your order and this might not even be a bar. Odds are you&#x27;ve wandered into the local antique shop. Well I, friends, am that bellyacher. Here I stand at the &quot;bar&quot;, gesticulating wildly over my non-existent glass.
In this scenario, the confused bartender/antique shop owner is Turtle Rock, developers of Left 4 Dead homage Back 4 Blood. Rumour has it that they&#x27;re making a Back 4 Blood 2 - but as I loudly explain to the bartender/antique shop owner, showering the cocktail measures/vintage Toby Jugs in spittle, I don&#x27;t want a Back 4 Blood 2. I want a follow-up to 2015&#x27;s Evolve, in which four hunters team up to track down a fifth person playing as a kaiju. &quot;A flagon of your finest Gorgon, please,&quot; I roar, thumping the bar, while Turtle Rock tries to sell me a gentleman&#x27;s travelling suitcase from the 1920s.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been trying to work out if I&#x27;m keen on Soulframe only because I feel guilty about missing the boat with Warframe. I reviewed Digital Extremes&#x27; hit free-to-play shooter in 2013, back when people were still calling it a spiritual successor to the developer&#x27;s boomerang-throwing action game Dark Sector. I didn&#x27;t like Warframe much at the time. Think I gave it a 6/10. Warp forward a decade, and that 6/10 game has become a thriving live service phenomenon - fifteenth on the Steam Most Played charts at the time of writing, and profitable enough to spawn its own annual TennoCon expo. It&#x27;s also become an intoxicating, confusing morass of dynastic sci-fantasy politicking and genre-shifting expansions, ranging from capital ship mechanics to questions of time travel, wrapped in layers of cosmetics that make Destiny look about as colourful as Gears Of War. 


I definitely didn&#x27;t see all that coming. I doubt Digital Extremes saw it coming either. Warframe today feels like a lab experiment run amok. I love its appetite for novelty, but there&#x27;s a lot for a returning player to catch up on and, frankly, it feels like homework. As such, I had a couple of broad motivations for playing Soulframe&#x27;s pre-alpha &quot;prelude&quot;: I&#x27;m keen to see what Digital Extremes can do when they aren&#x27;t encumbered by 10 years of world-building, and I want to get in on the ground floor before they absolutely swamp this thing in updates.

                              <span>A senator for the US government has urged Valve to answer complaints about the amount of racist, sexist and otherwise hateful posts and imagery shared by users on Steam. The digital store was the subject of a report by the Anti-Defamation League last week, which claimed to find millions of examples of &quot;hateful or extremist&quot; language and images hosted on Steam&#x27;s community. These include things like Nazi symbols in profile pictures, white supremacist slogans in group names, and yet more discriminatory spew in user posts. The senator has noticed this report, and now writes directly to Gabe Newell, demanding that Valve &quot;bring its content moderation practices in line with industry standards&quot; or risk &quot;intense scrutiny&quot; from the government.

True, games like Invisigun have experimented with this interesting concept before, but in Assassinvisible it&#x27;s framed by another - the whole game exists as doodles in a bored student’s notebook. Here’s the Tres-tray:

Debutující scenárista a režisér Vojtěch Strakatý nám přináší drama děvčete, které netuší, co si počít.


Existuje vícero českých filmů, které surfují na oblíbené vlně &quot;zakažte exekutory, zrušte dluhy, je to nelidské!&quot; (například Tancuj Matyldo). After Party takovým filmem není. Exekutoři se v něm chovají korektně a slušně a vinu na situaci celé rodiny nese naprosto jednoznačně otec, který neopatrně investoval, i když nevíme jak. A &quot;nevíme jak&quot; je téma, prolínající se celým tímto filmem. Takže nevíme, co vlastně otec komu naslibova…</span>

                              <span>A new trend has emerged on YouTube where &#x27;scammy&#x27; channels facing a ban for copyright infringement appear to evade penalties through the use of sexually explicit content.

This is surely the best link this week: an hour-long video on how to beat &quot;every possible game of Pokemon Platinum at the same time&quot;. That is, coming up with a set of game inputs that can win billions of possible permutations of the game, as determined by its RNG, when played simultaneously.

                              <span>Four thousand words of notes. Hoboy. Field of Glory Colon Kingdoms is definitely thought-provoking.
It was also complaint-provoking in the fairly long period where I didn&#x27;t understand what it&#x27;s trying to do. Reaching that point, luckily for you, means we can cut out a lot of the &quot;confused whingeing&quot; subsection of those notes. Though it still has its shortcomings, I&#x27;ve come to appreciate that I was reading Kingdoms all wrong.

                              <span>Thunderful Games, the developers and publishers that make the colourful SteamWorld series of games, have announced a hefty number of layoffs at the company, with anywhere between 80-100 people losing their jobs. It&#x27;s part of a &quot;restructuring&quot; that&#x27;ll also see an unspecified number of game projects cancelled, said the company in a press release yesterday. As if this is not dispiriting enough, they also say it&#x27;s an intentional move that&#x27;ll see them making fewer games of their own and instead publishing more work by other developers.

                              <span>Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in. This is a lie, of course. I haven’t been &#x27;out&#x27; of strategy autobattler Mechabellum since I started playing around the 1.0 launch back in September. There I was, just starting to get to grips with the card-house-careful balance between each of its units when, bam, makers Game River dropped a Jenga block on top of it. It’s a stealth block, too. Didn’t even see it coming.
Update 1.1’s new unit is the Phantom Ray, which Game River describe as &quot;a medium-sized aircraft with high HP that excels at striking enemies at close range with high-damage missiles&quot;. It’s a mid-tier flier, costing 50 to unlock and 200 to field, and for that you get three of them per unit. As for default tech, you’ve got some range and fire rate unlocks, alongside an oil drop. The headliner here is the stealth buff, which cloaks the Phantom Ray by default until it attacks. When it does, it all gets a nice 40% bonus to damage.

                              <span>2024 has been a pretty rough year for Nintendo-loving emulator fans. At this point it&#x27;s clear that they can either choose Nintendo, or Switch emulators, but they can&#x27;t have relationships with both. At least not in public. During the last few hours Nintendo began targeting Pomelo, a popular Switch emulator for iOS devices. Like similar emulators before it, Pomelo&#x27;s disclaimer against piracy is redundant. Thanks to its family tree, it has nowhere left to go.

                              <span>Sorry We&#x27;re Closed is a retro survival horror-inspired game about escaping the clutches of an excessively horny demon who desperately wants your heart. As someone who isn&#x27;t often into the &#x27;lore&#x27; behind things and prefers to just shoot and ask questions later, I found myself actually asking the questions. I wanted to know why I was targeted by such carnal eroticism. I wanted to know more about my character&#x27;s own relationships. How angels fit into the picture. And why lots of the demons seem quite chill, really.
But when it came to the actual survival -  the bit I thought I&#x27;d enjoy the most -  I came away a bit disappointed. Exploration is fine, it&#x27;s just the combat is often too frequent and too frequently irritating. I came to dread the action more than the atmosphere, in the end.

                              <span>In Rue Valley you role play a guy with poor mental health. He wanders around a crappy motel, stuck in the same old patterns of life, seemingly unable to escape his inner demons. When confronted with the premise for this upcoming RPG you may have one of two reactions. The first: you will say &quot;lol, it me&quot; with enough humour to wishlist it on Steam and earmark it for the future. The second: you will mutter &quot;ugh, it me&quot; and be immediately put off by the idea of having to tolerate an entire second layer of psychological hangups. 
There is a third secret reaction though... you might think: oh, this looks a lot like Disco Elysium, but in the real world.

                              <span>I’ve said it before, I’ll say it again: running away is the best feeling in videogames. More specifically, being chased is the best feeling in videogames, a sentiment I’d happen to share with my golden retriever if you replaced the word “videogames” with “the universe”. He is a purer being, but he’ll also never know the joy of executing a rail-dismount into a dashing corner-jump escape in Deadlock, and for this he deserves our pity.

It’s easy to miss if you haven’t played for at least a few hours, but Deadlock packs one of the most engaging movement systems this side of Tribes Ascend.

                              <span>The gaming keyboard market is currently tripping over itself, trying to equip everything with the technology most commonly known as Snap Tap: a feature that promises hyperfast inputs of two alternating keypresses, making you an unkillable side-strafing blur in your FPS of choice. Introduced on Razer’s Huntsman V3 Pro series and quickly followed by Wooting’s (functionally distinct but effectively identical) Rappy Snappy, Snap Tap is now wearing multiple names as it takes over the world of RGB peripherals, from SteelSeries’ Rapid Tap to Corsair’s FlashTap and Keychron’s... Last Keystroke Prioritisation. Which doesn’t sound as sexy, but still.
However, Snap Tap is also drawing a level of ire that exceeds the usual baseline scepticism of hardware marketing. Because it enables a form of input automation – where you can quickly move in two directions by rapidly tapping one key, while holding down another – it’s considered by some as tantamount to cheating, allowing players to cross the line that divides unfair play from the accepted comforts that come with simply using a responsive Hall Effect keyboard or high-refresh-rate monitor. It’s even become a bannable offence in certain games, most notably in Counter-Strike 2.
Neither side is backing down; in an astonishingly worded tweet, Wooting went as far as to concede Snap Tap &quot;should be considered cheating. But if it’s allowed, you need it.&quot; But do you?

                              <span>Epic Games has given the OK for their 1998 shooter Unreal to be hosted on the Internet Archive, essentially making the classic sci-fi alien blaster free, and preserving it for the future. They&#x27;ve also given the same permission for Unreal Tournament to be hosted there too, making free the multiplayer muckabout that spawned speedier and speedier sequels throughout the early 2000s (not to mention the origin of one of the most memorable multiplayer FPS maps of all time, Facing Worlds).

                              <span>Well, that was quick. After artwork leaked last week for what looked very much like a remaster of classic real-time strategy Warcraft II: Tides Of Darkness, Blizzard sneakily dropped both that and a remaster of Warcraft: Orcs &amp; Humans last night. They’re bundled together with Warcraft III: Reforged - itself with a new patch - in a &#x27;Warcraft Remastered Battle Chest&#x27;, which also includes the older versions of the first two games. The chest is available on Battle.net, where it’ll set you back £34.99 / $39.99. If you’re just after the older titles, they’re £9 / $10 and £12.59 / $15 respectively.

For those wanting to assemble a single socket AMD EPYC 9005 series server, one of the readily available options in the retail channel is the Supermicro H13SSL-N motherboard.</span>

The Rotterdam District Court found that the anti-piracy group can&#x27;t be expected to do more than it&#x27;s already done.

                              <span>Over the years, game retailers GOG have drifted from almost purely offering classic oldies to welcoming more and more modern blockbusters onto their storefront. In one sense, they&#x27;ve turned from a game preservation champion into a slightly dustier, DRM-less Steam. Now, though, GOG have declared a renewed focus on not just selling aged games, but on tweaking more of them to work on non-aged hardware. And you&#x27;ll be able to tell which games have got this restoration treatment from a fancy badge plastered on top of them.

                              <span>Theme park management sim Planet Coaster was all about making roller coasters that would push your park guests to the edge of puking up their overpriced burgers while making sure the excitement levels of your twisting rides remained high. Planet Coaster 2 wants to do that again, but this time adds water parks into the mix, with slides to design, pools to plop down, and raft rides that you can click together to form ambitiously speedy spirals. You can feel some creative pride when you look down on the watery wonderland you&#x27;ve made with these tools. But you may also wonder if it was worth the effort. As a newcomer to Planet management games, I&#x27;ve found this slippy sequel fiddly, cumbersome, and poorly explained.

                              <span>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake&#x27;s premise is bluntly, delightfully simple. The Archfiend Baramos, as evil as he is mysterious, is up and about. He’s got ill designs on the world. Your Dad tried to stop him, and he died. He fell into a volcano. We absolutely can’t be having that.
This is, more than anything else, a game about Going On An Adventure. Well walked ground, of course, but it’s rare to see it embarked upon with such barefaced delight, or such a wholehearted commitment to going the distance. It is a very big and a very simple RPG that is as wide as an ocean and as deep as a pond; a game to curl up with and play lazily and—with some sour caveats—enjoyably, for an entire winter.

                              <span>I predict I likely won’t have fully gotten to grips with the strategy of Sultan’s Game for several more hours, but since I’m considering investing that time - after a morning spent card shuffling and deciding whomst to bone and whomst to murder in its Steam demo - I’m compelled to spotlight it. It’s deeply imperfect and willfully obtuse, but also absolutely fascinating. I’ll ground you with a slightly wonky and dull allusion to Cultist Simulator, then guide you through in more or less the order I experienced it. As we progress, you may feel steadily more disorientated. It’ll be like a brewery tour I’ve somehow inherited control of by murder-boning the previous owners. Onward!

                              <span>A stupid inside joke I had with a housemate once was asking each other if we were &quot;born in Chornobyl?&quot; as a play on &quot;were you born in a barn?&quot; whenever either of us left the lights on before leaving the flat. This doesn’t make too much sense now I think about it, but such things rarely do. A more accurate jab, in hindsight, might have been &quot;you been running S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl at full specs or something?&quot;, because based on the upcoming FPS’s new system requirements, you’re going to need a reasonably laissez-faire attitude to literally any other concern in your life that doesn’t involve acquiring a notably juice-guzzling rig.

                              <span>Correction: A previous version of this article implied that Tequila Works were the developers of The Sexy Brutale. In fact, it was originally developed by Cavalier Game Studios. Tequila Works are the publishers of the game and are also listed as &quot;co-developers&quot; on Steam. Very sorry for the mistake!
Original article: The studio behind sunny third-person adventure Rime has filed for insolvency, with the heads of the studio quitting their roles. Tequila Works had their funding from Tencent pulled at some point, according to Eurogamer Spain, leaving the company without an important flow of cash. Which may explain why they cancelled a game last month and laid off some of their workers. It now looks like that was just the first sign of a more serious problem which has sadly resulted in the dissolution of the studio.

It did not, however, give me my beloved pistol. It’s fine. It’s in now, along with a few, less Neo-Volkite updates to other weapons.

                              <span>After nearly a year of public beta honing, the Nvidia App – Team Green’s new one-stop shop for desktop GPU management – is out in full. Not alongside the upcoming RTX 50 series, as rumoured, but right-now-today-this-minute. I’ve been testing out the launch version and while it’s not without some dud features, it does agreeably achieve its stated goal of combining the functions within Nvidia Control Panel and GeForce Experience. And if installing it means never having to use the latter again, well, that’s 149MB well spent.

                              <span>My strongest and most enduring memory of Grand Theft Auto will always be creasing into complete hysterics watching my mate pile into a crumpled police officer with a wooden baseball bat in GTA 3 after school one time. Young’uns these days just don’t appreciate how revolutionary it was to be able to hit a cop with a thing after he’d already fallen over. Suffice it to say I’ve got good memories of the open world series’ nascent forays into 3D, though never enough to tempt me into revisiting them, especially given the poor reception to Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition. I can sympathise. I’m annoyed just having to type a colon and a dash in the same game name.
If you’re in a similarly non-fussed position (I will never not be annoyed that ‘nonplussed’ doesn’t mean what it sounds like it should mean) I can’t imagine a lighting update that’s been available on the mobile versions for a while is enough to tempt you back. But what is a reporter&#x27;s job if not pathetically treading water between chunklets of Grand Theft Auto news, upon the publishing of which Graham presses the button to release the nutritious pellets on which we all wholly subsist? I hope he doesn’t read that last sentence. I don’t get my pellet if the syntax becomes too convoluted. Moving swiftly on.

The game is launching a &quot;Classic&quot; mode today that will let you play the first-person payload pusher as it (mostly) was back in 2016 when the first Overwatch launched. That means 6v6 fights, the original abilities of its heroes, and no limits to stop the entire team picking the same character.

Despite teaching you everything you need to know in the tutorial, it still manages to introduce new wrinkles and twists on the formula with each fresh chapter. My verdict? Imagine me lying my floor, massaging my temple with one hand and giving a fat thumbs up with the other.

As reported by Polygon, that&#x27;s an argument put forth by a new lawsuit against Ubisoft, filed by two Californian players of The Crew. They&#x27;re suing the company in a proposed class action lawsuit over shutting down the racing game&#x27;s servers, rendering it unplayable.

                              <span>Sin enjoyed the roguelike stylings of Dungeons of Blood and Dream when she played it in early access back in July, calling it a “baffling, bizarre thing that lives on the border of janky, retro, and punk”. As of yesterday, it’s now out for realsies, promising psychedelic dungeon crawling, the stabbing of assorted gribblies, and lots of little details that make you go “ooo, that’s nice. I’m glad they put that in there.”

It will feature no physicists celebrating Bring Your Shotgun To Work Day, but instead let up to four players tactically breach oil rigs and airports occupied by corporate-sponsored mercenaries. In Rogue Point the richest CEO on earth has croaked it, causing various megacorps to compete in a violent bum rush for control of that wealth. Which is where your team of renegade shooterists come in. They don&#x27;t want to win this contest, they just want everyone else to lose.

A successor to the translucent version that only went on sale in the US and Canada last year, the Steam Deck OLED: Limited Edition White offers both a snowy look and, for those of us outside North America, the chance to actually buy one. It’ll go on sale November 18th, in all the countries that the Steam Deck currently ships in.

                              <span>Several major record labels are asking the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals for a rehearing en banc in their piracy lawsuit against Grande Communications. They argue that the court erred in holding that piracy damages should be calculated per album, rather than per song. They argue that this decision, which will lower the $47 million damages award, doesn&#x27;t reflect the way that music is commercialized today.

That may seem like a win, but the finer details reveal a legal framework that favors rightsholders so strongly, online services incurring liability for the actions of users seems inevitable.

I’ve stopped a small community from completing a blood ritual, played the role of matchmaker to a group of lonely hearts that involved organising a date with god, and plastered a statue with paint as part of a revolutionary movement to uplift the power of art. My time with GGG has been a pick n’ mix of colourful escapades, and together with its story of godly woes, striking art style, vacuum-based puzzle-solving, and nightmare-inducing puppet work, I’m now a die-hard LimboLane devotee.

                              <span>Castle Master, the haunting conclusion to the Freescape engine saga, is now ready for public testing!
Prepare yourself for a perilous adventure as you lower the drawbridge to enter the Castle Master’s domain. Released in 1990 by Incentive Software, Castle Master became popular for its technical innovation and challenging gameplay. The game inspired countless 3D adventure titles, and the Freescape engine itself marked a technological milestone, enabling groundbreaking object interaction and spatial puzzles.
Notably, Castle Master was one of the first games to let you choose to play as either a prince or a princess, offering a different experience depending on your choice.
Your mission: rescue your twin, imprisoned within the eerie depths of Castle Eternity by the evil Magister. This sprawling, foreboding castle is filled with traps, monsters, and puzzles blocking your path. Gather items, unlock doors, and solve complex riddles as you navigate the labyrinthine halls and confront the dark forces within.
This modern reimplementation showcases enhanced graphics using OpenGL, with initial support for the DOS and ZX Spectrum releases. If you’re eager to embark on this dark journey, a playable demo is available to test your tenacity.
To participate in the testing, ensure you have a daily development build. We encourage all players to submit feedback and bug reports through our issue tracker.
Will you brave the creepy corridors of Castle Eternity and free your sibling, or will you fall victim to the Magister’s curse and join his army of enslaved spirits? The adventure awaits!

Jesse Keighin, aka EveryGameGuru, faces claims of unauthorized public performance and reproduction, contributory infringement and inducement for sharing links to emulators and pirated ROMs, plus violations of the anti-circumvention and circumvention device trafficking components of the DMCA.

International viewers are left waiting until other services pick it up. In the meantime, some may be tempted to explore unofficial channels for pirated copies of the show. But finding a pirated copy is proving surprisingly difficult.

                              <span>Warframe developers Digital Extremes have announced a new round of early access for their 2025-bound fantasy action-RPG Soulframe, which I saw a bit of last year and think is pretty promising. They&#x27;re now adding 2000 players to a Preludes build of the game every week, with each invite email including an additional four invite codes, so you can get your friends involved.

                              <span>Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6 has been out for a little while already, what with me giving its multiplayer largely a thumbs up. Still, it&#x27;s an ever-evolving thing and Activision have announced the game&#x27;s first seasonal drop. It&#x27;s a hefty one with a lot of additions, so I&#x27;ll try my best to break down the good stuff. TLDR: there&#x27;s some new maps for multiplayer and zombies, new modes, and a few extra bits. I&#x27;m mildly excited for more. More in this case is good.

                              <span>&quot;The cool thing about bombs is that you can hide them in anything,&quot; is probably my favourite Oppenheimer quote of all time, and in the case of Ian Hitman, it does raise an important question: with so many everyday objects equal to the rubber duck in its unthreatening aura, yet more inconspicuous, why choose to put an explosive in this one?
The simplest answer is that’s it’s a recurring bit of levity, a holdover easter egg, elevated to the status of key mission item in Hitman: Codename 47 before being given pride of place as an explosive in the World Of Assassination games. But to ascribe such unassuming purpose to the duck is to ignore its revelatory power. We must go deeper.

                              <span>Palworld developers Pocketpair have finally revealed which patents Nintendo and the Pokémon Company are suing them about. It looks like they&#x27;re focusing on the act of throwing capsular items to catch or release monsters, together with the usage of monsters as mounts.
If you&#x27;ve somehow yet to encounter Palworld, it&#x27;s a bestselling survival game that takes hefty - some would say, scandalous - inspiration from Pokémon, with players poaching Pokésque critters using magic spheres, and deploying them as soldiers and minions.

                              <span>In all honesty, Toads Of The Bayou could have been several notches less ribbet-ing than its Steam demo ended up being, because its stylised pixel fly-snatchers are just that good. There’s only one of the three characters available in the freebie (one of the others is a toad nun with a shotgun), but he’s got a little cutlass, a flintlock pistol, and a can-do attitude - at least when it comes to either stabbing or shooting things. The game itself is a little bit deckbuilder, a little bit Into The Breach: turn based strategy with perfect information and various tricks you can pull to make enemies hit each other instead of the thing you’re trying to protect. Indulge yourself on the gourmet tray-tray below.

The developers say everyone is parting &quot;on good terms&quot; and that the last eight years of getting published under Sega has been &quot;amazing&quot;. But there are other businessy reasons, of course. Namely, Sega have been trying to trim down their European studios for the past year, and Amplitude is just the latest bunch of devs affected by that.

Existing streamists, or anyone who signs up by the end of 2024, will get a year’s grace period before the limit kicks in from January 2026.

                              <span>Could tower defence be the ultimate &quot;it&#x27;s Friday and I am here in body only&quot; genre? I haven&#x27;t really thought about it before, but Rift Riff&#x27;s effusively laidback crowd control has me pondering those optimal moments in any tower defender when the incoming horde hits the flamer-MG triangle just right, and you can settle back comfortably into the role of clockwatcher.
Rift Riff encourages this behaviour by being nice to look at. Created by a trio of developers including Hidden Folks designer Adriaan de Jongh, it&#x27;s a world of spacey, sun-carved mountains, forests and monoliths. The towers resemble the sacred architecture of Monument Valley, and the colour scheme and general ambience remind me of Cocoon. There&#x27;s a demo, if you fancy it.

                              <span>Nostalgia, when you think about it, is bollocks. There has never been a better time than right this second – averaged out, and despite repeated attempts to the contrary, humanity has never been healthier, freer, or more enlightened by knowledge. It’s true of games too. For every by-committee platter of passionless map markers, there are thousands of more personal, more creative, more interesting works, all adding to the decades&#x27; worth of great stuff we can still play today.
What isn’t bollocks is the emotional pull that nostalgia, for all its lack of cold, hard reason, still manages to wield inside our warm, squishy brains. Hence, the centrepiece of Apex Legends’ Season 23 update is a mode that recreates the battle royale FPS as it was back in 2019, defaulting back to the original map and weapon arsenal while cutting the 26-strong legend roster to the earliest ten. It’s a Fortnite-style rolling back of the clock, and a passably enjoyable one, but also a reminder that the good old days weren’t always that good.

                              <span>I first played Taiko no Tatsujin in an arcade (in Japan, because I am very cool), where it&#x27;s controlled by hitting a recreation of an actual taiko drum. It was fun enough that I wish there was a taiko drum peripheral available for PC now the series is on our platform. 

Taiko no Tatsujin: Rhythm Festival is out now via Steam, where it offers over 70 songs to drum through, and a subscription service through which to unlock over 700 more. Maybe I should try to get my Donkey Konga drums working on PC, but I&#x27;ll probably settle for playing it with a gamepad.

Some mistake here surely?&quot; 1) My name&#x27;s not Shirley, and 2) Indeed it is a Mass Effect ship, but HelloGames struck a time-limited deal with BioWare to create a version for their own space sim.
&quot;Blast, if only I&#x27;d noticed this at the time and acquired one,&quot; you mourn. &quot;Ah, so many years I have wasted.&quot; Be of good cheer, my friend, for No Man&#x27;s Sky has a Normandy once again, just in time for the latest N7 Day of assorted Mass Effect celebrations. For the next two weeks, you&#x27;ll be able to get a-hold of it by way of a revised version of 2021&#x27;s Beachhead Expedition. Tray-tray, away!

                              <span>Got an email about this. Looks cool. Is free. “I’ll write about that,” I thought. “I’ll write about that for Rock Paper Shotgun, a place that semi-regularly posts articles about cool and free games.” So here we are. If you’re waiting for the other shoe to drop, assuming the only reason I’d open an article in a superfluous and straightforward manner is because I’m about to deliver some sort of third sentence twist, you’re completely wrong! There’s no twist at all. I’m simply going to deliver some information about the game in a neutral tone. You can find VED: Purification, a free prologue demo to RPG VED, here.

                              <span>When multiplayer fishing game Webfishing came out last month, it offered a relaxing hangout zone for cats and dogs. Everything revolves around catching, selling, and collecting the fish that gather in the rivers of a small island. It also lets you customise your character with clothing. Mostly simple hats and shorts, but some options let players celebrate their sexuality, such as a rainbow-adorned t-shirts, or titles that hang above your character which simply say &quot;Trans&quot; or &quot;Bi&quot;. All this led one player to complain there was no &quot;Straight&quot; title. So, the developer added one. It costs 10 grand.

                              <span>A few months ago, the rumour took root that GTA 6&#x27;s release date would slip back from 2025 to 2026. An anonymous insider averred that studio heads were &quot;worried&quot; about the new open world game&#x27;s progress - hence, perhaps, Rockstar&#x27;s decision to mandate a full return to in-office work. Pshaw, say publishers Take-Two CEO. They announced a fall 2025 launch in March and have just doubled down on it in their latest financial briefing, with CEO Strauss Zelnick subsequently going on the tellybox to say that Take-Two are &quot;highly confident in the timing&quot;, though he still has nothing to share about GTA 6 on PC.

                              <span>When I was a competitive long-distance runner at school, breath control was paramount. We were never really taught this, mind. It was an art you picked up through practice: how to breathe before the race, saturating your blood with O2 without dizzying yourself; when to permit the shorter, emergency breaths and when to apply restraint; when to deepen your inhales and charge yourself up for an attack on a hill.
And then, how to organise your body around your breath, straightening your posture to expand your lungs without tipping back too far and squandering muscle power; how to breath in time with your stride and the movement of your shoulders, so as to firm up your momentum and shave a miraculous-feeling minute off your finishing time. All this, plus various daft psychological war gambits of my own devising. When overtaking or being overtaken, I used to seal my lips shut on that side and breath through the other corner of my mouth, to make it look like I was hardly out of breath at all.

                              <span>Calling a game ‘no frills’ or ‘no nonsense’ is always a back-handed compliment, because it sounds like you&#x27;re saying it&#x27;s a bit straightforward and simple. And yes, that’s exactly what I’m saying here. Acts Of Blood feels like a spiffy PS2 action brawler; a slightly tighter old Yakuza game, or a stripped-back Sifu. It’s snacky and a bit janky, but it’s also great coffee break fodder, assuming you want to spend your break breaking a selection of heavy objects over the crumbly skulls of ne’er-do-wells. I mean, they might have done some things well, I don’t know them. But they aren’t doing any well to my character in the game, so violence it is.

Exploring rooms to the side, Alan Wake 2: The Lake House’s star finds whiteboards and documents revealing the typewriter’s purpose: to mimic Wake’s writing. Pages are graded along criteria such as ‘style’, ‘tone’, and ‘content’, then “fed into the algorithm” as references until “near-identical stories” to Wake’s can be produced.
“If Jules could simply cut the painter open and pull the painting out of him, he would,” reads one of the real Alan’s typewritten pages. That’s Jules Marmont, the obsessive head of the titular FBC centre. The Marmonts - Jules and his wife Diana - are running experiments to forcibly and synthetically create works of art, aiming to mimic creative passion convincingly enough for the paranatural entity inside Cauldron Lake to respond, as it has in the past.

                              <span>Putting aside my natural annoyance at Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater for almost beating out the Twarhammer series in the headline real estate wars, I am more than a little excited to play. Some days, you simply must feast on a tree frog, and while we still don’t have a solid release date, that day doesn’t feel too far away. Good news for stealth fans, and perhaps gooder news for a dozen strapline writers sweating profusely, soiling themselves in anticipation of using “kept you waiting, huh?”.
Until then, I at least have a steady drip feed of new information to keep me sated, the latest of which is the substantial hint that there&#x27;ll be some new dialogue in the game, as per the video below. Alongside that, the previously pseudonymous Suzetta Miñet - who was credited with voicing EVA in MGS3 and Peace Walker - has revealed herself to be Jodi Benson, the voice of Ariel in Disney’s The Little Mermaid. Cheers for the spot, Automaton West.

                              <span>Foxhole is one of my favourite games to read about, even if I don&#x27;t play it. It&#x27;s a massively multiplayer World War 2 game, viewed from above, where battlefield logistics matters as much as aiming and flanking. Its developers have just announced a major new update coming next summer, Foxhole: Airborne, which adds planes to the game for the first time.

Planes, in a topdown MMO? It makes a little more sense if you watch the trailer.

                              <span>&quot;Never read the comments,&quot; is a truth much-rehearsed by senior games journalists, but I have long since levelled-up past this axiom and entered into a new world of benevolent narcissism. I always read the comments, for all commenters are my children. They exist to glorify and preserve me in my dotage. True, occasionally my children say things like &quot;I think your writing and opinions are appalling, and that you deserve to be repeatedly run over by a herd of deer&quot;, but it is the nature of children to rebel.

                              <span>Halo Infinite recently received a big update in the form of Delta Arena, a playlist that features recreations of Halo 2&#x27;s most popular maps and a special third-person mode. The true highlight, though, is yet to come. And that&#x27;s through an entirely different Halo game: The Master Chief Collection. Soon enough, you&#x27;ll be able to play Halo 2&#x27;s lost E3 demo on it, thanks to some lovely modders.

                              <span>Back in the misty reaches of time (March) popular farming sim Stardew Valley got a big update that added more pets to the game (it also let you drink mayonaise but let&#x27;s not get sidetracked). Those new cats, dogs, and turtles had the cute distinction of being able to wear hats, should you choose to kit your wee friends out. Now, following many months of smaller updates to the game, it seems those hats are causing a problem. &quot;[If] you are experiencing performance issues in Stardew Valley 1.6, remove all hats from pets,&quot; said creator Eric Barone in a xeet. When asked the lore-accurate cause of this problem, he blamed: &quot;a strange rash&quot;.

It&#x27;s basically another method of capturing funny ragdoll glitches and posting them on the &quot;lol-games-are-dumb&quot; channel of your friend&#x27;s Discord. Or for posting that flukey knife throw in Call Of Duty to Twitter, as if you really meant to kill the man from across the map all along. Or saving a clip for your personal records, like the footage of that time you yeeted an innocent citizen off the 50-foot wall of a castle town in Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2. We all do that, right? Right?

                              <span>We’re still a week away from Blizzard’s Warcraft 30th Anniversary Direct next Wednesday the 13th of November, but art from an apparent remaster of 1995 real time strategy game Warcraft II: Tides Of Darkness has leaked online, via Xibbly user Stiven. It’s a thin one, as far as leaks go, but does show what looks to be cover, logo art, and a Battle.net icon. Thanks for the spot, Percy Coswald Gamer.

                              <span>Ogres, Orcs, and Khorne are all on the way in the upcoming expansion for strategy game Total War: Warhammer 3, and Creative Assembly have just released their latest dev vlog with a few more details on what to expect. There’s still no word on the exact title, although given the established naming convention (Shadows Of Change, Thrones Of Decay), I’m tentatively calling it “Sniffers Of Glue” in honour of the No Think, Only Krump faction selection.
You’ll find the vlog in its full glory below. What’s interesting about this one is that vlog mainstay director Rich Alridge has brought along some new faces: battle designer Josh King and audio director Chris Goldsmith. And, yes, so no-one can accuse me of burying the lede: that audio design involved the enthusiastic, deeply disgusting slurping of porridge and yoghurt, and the jangling of real bones. The source of the bones is not revealed.

                              <span>After seven months of intense work, we are ready to announce support for a few games based on qdEngine, developed by K-D Labs.
The work is based on the original sources published now under GPL, although the work started a bit earlier than that. The engine supports 14 games, five of which we are announcing support for. Most of these games were released in Russian; however, there were Lithuanian, Czech, and Polish releases. The support is announced for:
Wait for it! Issue 3. Song for a Hare, (Russian: Ну, погоди! Выпуск 3. Песня для зайца, Lithuanian: Na, palauk! Zuikio dainos, Czech: Jen počkej a Píseň pro zajíce)
Mask Show (Russian: Маски-шоу)
Marvellous Mice Adventures: Meeting Sea Rat (Russian: Три маленькие белые мышки. Визит Морской крысы, Czech: Příběhy myší rodinky I, Polish: Były Sobie Myszki Trzy: Na Spotkanie Cioci Myszy)
The Adventures of the Good Soldier Schweik (Russian: Похождения бравого солдата Швейка)
Marvellous Mice Adventures: Sea Rat&#x27;s Birthday, (Russian: Три маленькие белые мышки. День рождения морской крысы, Polish: Były Sobie Myszki Trzy: Urodzinowe Śledztwo)
Other games do work; however, we haven’t playtested them. You may find more information on our Wiki. Also, we are looking for the Lithuanian version of Little Longnose and Polish releases of Little Mice games and Wait for it! game. If you happen to have a copy, please contact sev.
We continue the active development so that support for other games will follow shortly. The primary constraint is playtesting.
To run these games, you need the latest daily build of ScummVM. If you encounter any hiccups during your quests, please file them on our issue tracker.

Expect a new playable area, the Alabaneve Summits, with its own enemies, resources, non-threatening wildlife and quests. The maximum character level has risen to 35! There are new townsfolk to find and place in your poorly built houses! You can tame animals, and make them live in poorly built houses too! You can get hypothermia!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve spent quite a lot of today trying to figure out why, exactly, some of the monsters in the Monster Hunter Wilds beta looked like bundles of copulating pyramids slathered in crocodile gravy. Nic clued me in on this reddit thread earlier, which cites unnamed Chinese players who&#x27;ve allegedly data-mined the beta&#x27;s monster models, and learned that they are extremely large, encompassing hundreds of thousands of polygons.
If every monster in Monster Hunter Wilds were that fancy all of the time, your computer would become a volcano. As such, the game resorts to loading-on-demand systems to ensure that you only see those gorgeous details when the monsters are close by and, as the case may be, angrily sitting on you. When they&#x27;re further afield, the flourishes fall away to free up memory and processing power. The popular Redditor explanation for the presence of monsters that look like Henry Moore sculpture is basically that the LOD systems are being forgetful, and neglecting to load the additional polygons at proximity.

                              <span>As a yearly blockbuster, Call of Duty, through sheer expense and effort, would like you to think it is the Die Hard of video games. Or, depending on the setting, the Saving Private Ryan of video games. But it is barely Black Hawk Down. This latest campaign in Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6 reminds me more of the forgettable Netflix shootfests that thumbnail their way across your TV screen as you try to find some gritty nothing to aid you in zoning out of life. Still, there is an anecdotal contingent of casual sofa sitters for whom Call Of Duty is the game. A balls-to-the-wall shooter to return to every winter and rinse through in a weekend. Ed has already gestured at its multiplayer, announcing: &quot;yup, it&#x27;s COD&quot;, like a deeply tired Captain Birdseye inspecting the day&#x27;s catch, wondering when his life will change. But never mind that. How does the single player story mode hold up? Some are calling it the best campaign in years. And I guess that&#x27;s true, in the sense that it is the least worst.

                              <span>Discourse? Look mate, I’m just here to test the Steam Deck. Dragon Age: The Veilguard runs like a tap on any halfway decent desktop hardware, so was naturally going to be worth trying on the weaker Deck. And sure enough, Bioware’s RPG (which is really more of an action game with the occasional verbal spar) settles comfortably into handheld life.
In fact, Valve have festooned its Steam page with a Verified medal, a seal of approval for any game that performs and controls well on the Steam Deck without any glaring weaknesses or impractical annoyances. It’s still worth playing around with the settings – more on those later – but I’ll back up that official assessment, having played for several hours without so much as an undersized tooltip.

                              <span>The trailer for Bambas! starts off innocently enough. It&#x27;s an &quot;innovative urban walking simulator&quot; in which you play a disembodied pair of shoes, individually moved with a controller&#x27;s analog sticks and trigger buttons. The first half of the trailer is all whimsy and playground fun - kicking a football, standing on a climbing frame, riding a skateboard. But then a note of darkness creeps in, as the player begins to channel the sheer nihilistic inconsequentiality of a world in which shoes have no thinking human bodies to restrain them.

                              <span>To say that Factorio: Space Age throws out the rulebook is an understatement. It&#x27;d be more fitting to say it&#x27;s somehow automated the whole process: an inserter plucked out the rulebook from my brain and deposited it in hot magma, while a new rulebook was churned out in a nearby machine and plopped into my brain from the other side - only for that to be immediately plucked out and incinerated as well. With each new planet and each new phase, Space Age reinvents itself. I&#x27;m battling hyperbole here, but ah hell, I admit defeat. Factorio: Space Age is a masterpiece, the final form of perhaps the most well-crafted building game I&#x27;ll ever play.

                              <span>I have zero archaeology experience or knowledge, but I bet archaeologists really love their jobs (for the most part). They get to analyse and discover cool artefacts and educate us on the histories of forgotten civilisations. That&#x27;s dreamy stuff, that is. But I do wonder what it&#x27;s like for archaeologists to discover and study something they shouldn&#x27;t have; something with a disturbing secret - a curse, maybe. Bite-sized horror game The Children Of Clay explores this idea and I&#x27;d like more of it, please.

                              <span>Much the same as anyone with a soul, I find ants deeply fascinating and, much the same as anyone who occasionally drops small pieces of sandwich on the floor, I will continue to uphold my respect for them as long as they come nowhere near my feet. Yes. I admit it: I am a bug hypocrite, loudly extolling their virtue and beauty at a distance then getting irritated if they decide to come sit on me.
Fortunately, real time strategy Empire Of The Ants understands that the best place for insects to be is inside a screen, where they can be appreciated but cannot under any circumstances touch you. It’s out this week, as it happens, and here’s a new launch trailer to celebrate. Follow your pheromone trail to the video below.

                              <span>Early reactions to Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6 multiplayer range from frothing dislike through omnimovement hype to our own Ed Thorn&#x27;s dead-eyed appraisal that it&#x27;s &quot;a good one, I think. Not a bad one. If you like Call Of Duty, you will like this. If you don&#x27;t like Call Of Duty, you will not like this.&quot; I feel like we need to emergency-deploy a supply crate of smelling salts, because the sheer OK-ness of Black Ops 6 appears to have tumbled Ed into a stupor. 


Perhaps it would be a different story if he&#x27;d encountered some of the spawning issues and glitches people are talking about, with players joining games and materialising right into a hail of fire. The players in question include Black Ops 6&#x27;s developers, who comically note in the latest Black Ops 6 patch notes that &quot;Yes, we saw ourselves in a Killcam before selecting a Loadout too.&quot; The latest patch seeks to address this, naturally. As regards the campaign side of things, it also resets your safehouse currency to 5000, if you&#x27;ve had your single player funds stolen (or multiplied) by technical gremlins.

                              <span>We are excited to announce that Rise of the Dragon  is now ready for public testing. This is the first of a small number of games built using the DGDS (Dynamix Game Development System) engine.
The Dynamix name may be familiar – bought by Sierra in 1990, the Dynamix brand continued and became well known for action and puzzle games like The Incredible Machine, A10 Tank Killer, and Red Baron.  They also made a few adventures using the custom DGDS engine.
Rise of the Dragon is set in Los Angeles in a dark version of the future, circa 2053.  You play as Blade Hunter, a private investigator and retired police officer.  After a designer drug kills the mayor&#x27;s rebellious daughter, Chandra, Hunter is hired to find the people responsible for releasing the drug on the streets. What Blade ultimately finds is much more than he expected.  Rise of the Dragon combines classic point-and-click adventure style with platforming arcade sequences, giving a unique gameplay combination.
You’ll need the latest daily build of ScummVM and files from the DOS version of the game, which you can buy at GOG (check our wiki for the required data files).  Please file any issues you notice on our bug tracker.

Každopádně je to originální zážitek, který skoro nenudí a vypadá až překvapivě výpravně (vzhledem k omezenému rozpočtu). (Ilča 100 %)</span>

                              <span>Unrest is a roleplaying game developed by Pyrodactyl Studios set in a fantasy interpretation of ancient India. You’ll step into the shoes of ordinary people and navigate a world fraught with challenges as they strive for safety, freedom, and peace.
We are proud to announce that Unrest is now playable using ScummVM thanks to the work done by our GSoC student, Kartik Agarwala! Help us test the game by grabbing a daily build of ScummVM. Read through our testing guidelines, and please take some screenshots along the way. If you encounter any issues, please report them to our bugtracker.
If you don’t own Unrest, you can purchase this game from either GOG or Steam. The demo for the game is also supported and available from our web site.
Now go, use your manipulative skills to bring peace to this troubled world where chaos is not afar. For the most daring players using the iron-man mode, saving and loading the game is only available using ScummVM&#x27;s Global Main Menu.
