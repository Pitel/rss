                              <span>Despite mostly going under the radar before it came out, Helldivers 2 proved that it&#x27;s got what it takes to reach the top charts. With a concurrent player cap of 700,000 players, Helldivers 2 has now revealed that it&#x27;s got a veritable &quot;Game Master&quot; coordinating its war efforts.


Notably, it&#x27;s plain as day that Helldivers 2&#x27;s galactic war efforts are not just a randomized series of combat scenarios thrown together by an algorithm. A prime example of this being the case was the rapid onslaught of Automaton forces after Super Earth won its first clash against the Terminid. Not only can Arrowhead Studios thus create a custom &quot;campaign&quot; for the entire community to participate in, though, but there&#x27;s a developer whose job is specifically to spice things up in the live game.

                              <span>CD Projekt Red just dropped the latest update for Cyberpunk 2077, and it makes a handful of visual updates to the game while also addressing some glitches that range from harmless to game-breaking. 


Officially, Cyberpunk 2077 is finished, and CDPR planned for patch 2.0 to be the last big update to the game, but things didn’t shake out that way. Ahead of the game’s Ultimate Edition release, patch 2.1 added a ton of new content, including a functional metro system and new companion side activities. After that CDPR shifted its focus to the Cyberpunk sequel, but the developer is still ironing out some details in 2077. 


The latest update is patch 2.12, and while it brings a number of welcome changes, it isn’t adding any new content to the game. Instead, 2.12 is aimed at making small adjustm…</span>

                              <span>February 29 is a rare day, a perfect date to celebrate with a session of the Final Fantasy-themed musical game Theatrhythm Final Bar Line. However, I&#x27;ve got sad news for anyone attempting to celebrate today with a little Theathrythm as the rhythm game just won&#x27;t load on this day, specifically. 


The situation is a bummer, yes, but worry not as a solution already exists, and the cause for the whole thing is rather hilarious.




It seems like what&#x27;s preventing players from joining the servers is that we&#x27;re currently existing in the most cursed day of a glitched period in time, the one our calendar lords call &quot;leap year&quot;. Look, I admit that don&#x27;t know the complex math behind this cosmic event, but I believe Destructoid&#x27;s own Zoey Handley perfectly described it as &quot;a little Y2K that comes &#x27;round every four years&quot;.


This Y2K ordeal becomes twice as hilarious once you remember that Theatrhythm is a mostly offline game. It doesn&#x27;t need the Internet, hell, it doesn&#x27;t even need to know what time it is. In fact, the good people at Vooks report having tried it on their consoles, and the fix they found was to just change the console&#x27;s date to any other date of the year. Thank you, Mr Kojima, you&#x27;ve taught us well.


Here&#x27;s hoping Square Enix solves this problem soon, or the Theatrhythm fans who are too wise to mess with the authorities of time will have to abruptly find new plans for February 29, 2028.


This is such an interesting failure — or maybe, just maybe, Square Enix is bottlenecking Theatrhythm on purpose to prevent it from completely overshadowing the release of Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth, the real competition here all along. There&#x27;s just no way of knowing.


Theatrhythm Final Bar Line is usually available on the PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch, just not today. 


Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth comes out today on the PlayStation 5 and will likely stay available until the great global collapse.

                              <span>Hot skippidy Nimbus, it&#x27;s actually happening. Destiny 2 is getting hoverboards. Announced in one of Bungie&#x27;s This Week in Destiny communications, and alongside a snazzy-looking trailer, the new vehicle type will be a part of 2024&#x27;s Guardian Games event.


Players have asked for hoverboards in Destiny 2 for years, often citing desires to see changes or improvements to the long-standing Sparrows. Naturally, when Nimbus and Rohan showed up on their pseudo-hoverboards in Lightfall, players only wanted them more. 


Now, Guardians will finally be able to see their dreams come true and give grinding in Destiny a whole new meaning.




Bungie is officially calling the hoverboard the &#x27;Skimmer.&#x27; And the TWID notes that they&#x27;ll function a lot like Sparrows, albeit with a couple of notable differences. Namely, Skimmers can grind rails in the environment and look to sport some stylish new trick animations.


The Skimmer coming to the Guardian Games is Allstar Vector, a flat, vaguely spork-shaped silver board adorned with event decals. Everyone can use the Skimmer throughout the free three-week event, and it&#x27;s possible to earn it for good via Guardian Games&#x27; Drop In quest. 


In addition to Allstar Vector, Bungie noted that another Skimmer would also be available through the Eververse Store. While the details weren&#x27;t fully shared, the TWID hinted that it&#x27;s inspired by a &quot;beloved&quot; Destiny weapon. Here&#x27;s hoping Guardians will soon find themselves hovering around on the old G-horn.


Destiny 2&#x27;s 2024 Guardian Games, and the chance to grab the game&#x27;s first hoverboard, start on March 5.

As reported by Kotaku, the Borderlands maker is poised to be sold out, and more information will be shared next month. 


Embracer had purchased Gearbox for $1.3 billion in 2021. However, after purchasing studios from around the world, the Swedish company released an open letter explaining that it is aiming to become a “heavy-investment-mode to a highly cash-flow generative business,&quot; and this will require “closing or divestments of some studios and the termination or pausing of some ongoing game development projects.”

                              <span>On the company’s website, Toys for Bob, the developer behind Skylanders and Crash Bandicoot 4, has announced that it&#x27;s diverging from Activision Blizzard to become independent.


The post doesn’t really give much more in the way of details. It states that the company will return to being a “small and nimble studio.” They also state that, while they’re separating, they are looking into a “possible partnership” with Microsoft. Explaining, “Our friends at Activision and Microsoft have been extremely supportive of our new direction, and we’re confident that we will continue to work closely together as part of our future.”


That’s somewhat surprising, considering Toys for Bob was reportedly among those hit by the massive wave of Microsoft layoffs in the wake of the Activision Blizzard acquisition. Don’t burn any bridges, I suppose.


Toys for Bob says it&#x27;s in the early days of developing its next game and is looking forward to providing more updates.


This news comes shortly after the news that Saber Interactive and Gearbox are being sold off by Embracer Group. Throughout the coronavirus pandemic and even following that, we say a period of rapid acquisitions from companies like Sony, Microsoft, and Embracer. In the fallout of that, there have been a dizzying number of layoffs and studio closures, so seeing a developer spin-off on their own is almost refreshing.

                              <span>Developer Sand Sailor Studio and publisher Thunderful Games revealed today that the upcoming Viking sandbox survival builder ASKA will be getting a Closed Beta test in April. The Closed Beta will run from April 15 through April 21, with sign-ups open now through April 5.




Players can embark on a Viking expedition solo or with up to three friends as they work together to build a Viking empire. Collecting resources, building a thriving settlement, and summoning intelligent NPC villages are some of the tasks required to do so. Players will also need to automate, manage, and defend their tribe especially to survive the bitter cold winter.



&quot;ASKA stands as a testament to what a dream-team of just 10 people can achieve over the course of 4 years: an ambitious co-op survival tribe builder where you&#x27;re never alone, where you work alongside lively AI villagers that are almost indistinguishable from players, all woven into a deep city builder-like economy system. We’re entering the final phase of our beta testing period and we can&#x27;t wait to give players the power to build their very own truly functional Viking village, who knows what they&#x27;ll build.&quot;
- Cristian Diaconescu, Creative Director at Sand Sailor Studio



We&#x27;ve seen quite a few survival builders released recently. But honestly, all you had to say was Viking and I&#x27;m in. Based on the trailer it looks like you can get pretty creative with actually building out your settlement. And hopefully, they mean it when they say intelligent NPC villagers. I&#x27;ve seen several games in the genre recently add NPCs to help players with tasks like gathering, building, and even fighting. But none of them have quite gotten it right.


Those interested in participating in the Closed Beta that runs from April 15 through April 21 can ASKA Discord server before April 5.

                              <span>Bloomberg is reporting that Saber Interactive, the developers reportedly working on a remake of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, is being sold by Embracer Group to a private investment group.


Embracer Group has been going through a massive restructuring that has seen hundreds of employees laid off and the shuttering of studios. This latest deal appears to be another part of that ongoing effort.


While the state of the Knights of the Old Republic remake is currently in question, Saber Interactive is slated to release a few games this year, including Warhammer 40000: Space Marine 2, Toxic Commando, and Expeditions: A Mudrunner Game. It’s currently not known how the sale will affect their current projects, which also include Jurassic Park: Survival. 


According to Bloomberg’s source, the deal is worth $500 million. Saber was part of Embracer’s big buying spree. They purchased the company back in 2020 at a reported price of $525 million, which means a bit of a loss. Furthermore, Bloomberg is reporting that the price also “includes an option for Saber to bring along multiple Embracer subsidiaries.” While this might just be referring to Saber’s branches in other countries, there are other studios listed under them, such as 3DRealms and Tripwire.


It’s possible that more of these sales will happen as Embracer continues its efforts to restructure. During their previous fiscal reports, the corporation has stated that they are in “the final stretch” of their restructuring, but it’s currently unknown what else is planned.

                              <span>Naughty Dog is one of the big players when it comes to gaming studios. It has given us timeless titles from Jak and Daxter to The Last of Us. The President of Naughty Dog, Neil Druckmann, recently sat down for an interview with the rapper Logic to discuss their career trajectories and their plans for the future. 


It&#x27;s an hour-and-a-half-long interview worth watching if you&#x27;re interested in learning how Druckmann found his way into the gaming industry and moved up the ranks in Naughty Dog. It also offers insight into how things have changed in the studio over the years and how expectations have sharply risen as it has delivered critical hits.

                              <span>At the time of writing, the GTA 6 trailer is sitting pretty at 178 million views on YouTube. But that&#x27;s not what most people are interested in. What we want to know is exactly when it&#x27;s coming out. Well, the end may be in sight for the long-awaited Grand Theft Auto game.


According to a report from Bloomberg&#x27;s Jason Schreier, Rockstar is asking all staff to return to the office for &quot;five days a week starting in April.&quot; This is for &quot;security and productivity reasons,&quot; according to Rockstar Head of Publishing Jenn Kolbe.




The report goes on to say GTA 6 is about to &quot;enter the final stretch of development.&quot; This means we&#x27;re getting ever closer to its release, though we obviously still don&#x27;t know when that&#x27;s likely to happen.


Employees &quot;not thrilled,&quot; it seems


The fact that Rockstar Games is putting out the clarion call for employees shows the company is looking to end hybrid working conditions. It&#x27;s a topic that&#x27;s been quite prevalent in the working world, and Rockstar asking staff to return to the office is likely due to security breaches, such as the great GTA 6 leak of 2022.


Companies asking people to shift to on-site working on a more permeant basis is becoming more common as the memories of the pandemic begin to fade for a lot of people. However, such a move may prove unpopular with those in the gaming industry who have adjusted to working remotely.


That aside, we don&#x27;t exactly know when the game itself will actually be launching, even if it is heading towards the finish line. We&#x27;re being told it&#x27;s aiming for a 2025 release, so we&#x27;re still looking at nearly another year yet, give or take.


No doubt it&#x27;s going to be one of the biggest releases of all time. Given the legacy of Grand Theft Auto 5 – which came out over 10 years ago, don&#x27;t forget – there&#x27;s no way the follow-up is going to be anything other than a money-printing license for Rockstar.

                              <span>Nintendo has filed a lawsuit against the creators of Yuzu, an open-source Switch emulator. As first reported by Game File&#x27;s Stephen Totilo, the full legal document is available online, and it features a plethora of accusations against Yuzu and its creators. 


As the lawsuit alleges, Yuzu allows players to play pirated games. The Switch maker has invested a lot to prevent piracy via multiple means, and at least two or three technological measures are always implemented to protect its games, including &quot;encryption that scrambles the audiovisual content in the game file to make it unusable without the use of proprietary use of cryptographic keys.&quot; Additional layers of encryption are also included to prevent the modification of its consoles.

                              <span>Amid the Electronic Art layoffs, Respawn has announced the cancellation of their Star Wars first-person-shooter. The decision comes from the company&#x27;s examination of the player community, and their interests apparently lying more in Jedi and Respawn&#x27;s brands.


According to EA president Laura Miele, Respawn&#x27;s primary focus will now be new projects based on &quot;owned brands,&quot; while providing ongoing support for existing games.


&quot;It&#x27;s always hard to walk away from a project, and this decision is not a reflection of the team’s talent, tenacity, or passion they have for the game,&quot; said Miele. &quot;Giving fans the next installments of the iconic franchises they want is the definition of blockbuster storytelling and the right place to focus.&quot;

                              <span>Poncle has abruptly dropped a new update for Vampire Survivors with a trailer that includes some well-timed Final Fantasy references. Just a few. The Space54 update is available today.


Is the update at all related to Final Fantasy? Hmmm, no. It doesn’t look like it. However, for some reason, the team decided to release a trailer alongside it that is a shot-for-shot remake of the 1997 Final Fantasy VII trailer. Well, as shot-for-shot as they can manage with Vampire Survivors.




What? Well, according to the press release I received, an insides says, “Because we had the original trailer on a PlayStation demo disk and watched it on loop so now it’s scored into our brains. Plus the team is extremely hyped for Rebirth. What better way to celebrate than with a trailer of our own?”


As for the actual update, I don’t think you’re going to be seeing any buster swords. It looks to be more sci-fi-themed. This is what Poncle has highlighted for the Space54 update:


7 New Achievements


2 New Characters:



Bat Robbert – When falling below 20% health, he gains +16 MaxHP (max +400) and recovers 30% health. This ability recharges every time the character is fully healed.


Space Dude – Every few seconds fires all weapons regardless of their Cooldown. The cooldown of this ability is affected by the Cooldown stat.



New Weapons:



Pako Battiliar – May retaliate when losing health.


Phas3r – Pew Pew! Generates thin damaging zones. High Amount scaling.



New Stage



Space54 – A cosmic trek through horrors and delights.



New Relic



Allows to enable random level up choices.



Vampire Survivors is available on basically everything at this point. The Space54 update is free and will be arriving today.

                              <span>Derceto Manor is where we return for our scene, in the upcoming reboot (again) of Alone in the Dark. In the latest teaser shown by publisher THQ Nordic, we get some hints of plot, some talking points from Emily and Edward&#x27;s respective voice actors, and we now have the hardware specs for PC.


The new trailer once again leave survival horror fanatics hungry for more, as we take a quick peek at the reimagining of this classic. Actor David Harbour – who voices Edward – talks about his love of games that let you &quot;choose your own adventure,&quot; while Jodie Comer – AKA Emily Hartwood – is impressed by how &quot;fully fleshed out&quot; the characters are.




We also get to hear from Mikael Hedberg, Alone in the Dark&#x27;s writer and director, who some of you will know through his work on Amnesia and SOMA (this i…</span>

After the unexpected Automaton onslaught immediately after the Terminid clash, the community is theorizing that the omnicidal bots might not be going after Super Earth, but Cyberstan instead.


Amidst all the wacky hijinks that the Helldivers are up to, there&#x27;s a fairly interesting narrative developing in the background of the galactic war. More specifically, after Malevelon Creek (i.e. robot Vietnam) fell, players expected that the Automaton forces would resume their assault one system node closer to Super Earth in an attempt to crush managed democracy in its nest. 


Instead, the bots moved one node upwards. It didn&#x27;t take long for the community to figure out th…</span>

                              <span>Toys for Bob, the studio behind games like Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy, Spyro Reignited Trilogy, and Crash Bandicoot 4: It&#x27;s About Time, has announced it is splitting from its owner Activision Blizzard to go independent. It is also exploring a partnership with Microsoft. 
Toys for Bob announced this in a statement released today, which explains why now is &quot;the time to take the studio and our future games to the next level.&quot; 


Here&#x27;s Toys for Bob&#x27;s statement, in full: 
Toys for Bob did not disclose a price (if there is one) associated with its split from Activision Blizzard, which arrives just a few months after Microsoft purchased the company for a colossal $69 billion.
Toys for Bob joins another studio leaving the hands of its owner today: With a $500 million deal, Embracer Group has sold Saber Interactive to a group of private investors, as reported by Bloomberg. Kotaku is also reporting today that Gearbox, the makers of the Borderlands series, is looking to break away from Embracer Group as well.

Now that we&#x27;ve spent a cumulative hundreds of hours in the vast, dense world created by Square Enix, we can confirm that they were not misleading us in the slightest; Final Fantasy VII Rebirth has a diverse and impressive list of minigames for players to spend time with during their playthrough of this second act of the Remake trilogy. 
While each minigame is fun in its own way, some elevate above the rest to give players something exciting to look forward to each time the diversion presents itself. We&#x27;ve ranked each major minigame in Final Fantasy VII Rebirth below. If you&#x27;ve had a chance to experience all the minigames that F…</span>

We don&#x27;t know why this happened, or if developers at Square Enix and Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio were in communication, or if scooters happen to be really popular in Japan right now – we don&#x27;t know. One question we can answer, however, is which one is better?
Join Marcus Stewart and me as we put the two Segway-inspired scooters to the test side-by-side across a series of competitions and stunts to see which two-wheeled balancing vehicle is the best.

                              <span>Today&#x27;s my last day writing deals at RPS! That&#x27;s a shame, but I have still have two to four articles to share with you, and I&#x27;m going to start with this ultrawide monitor from Lenovo, the Legion R45W-30. This is a huge 45-incher, offering what is essentially two 1440p 165Hz screens side-by-side. It normally retails for £799, but today Very are offering it for £100 off - £699. That&#x27;s a good price for what is essentially two mid-range gaming monitors seamlessly joined into one.

                              <span>As with all headlines that are phrased as a question, the answer is &quot;probably not&quot;, but in any case, Miyazaki has mysteriously hinted at there being at least one secret thing in Elden Ring that players haven&#x27;t found yet. On this week&#x27;s Electronic Wireless Show podcast we discuss this, as well as some of our favourite and least favourite deployments of the video game Easter egg. We also talk about what we&#x27;ve been playing this week (Nightingale; PowerWash Sim, natch) and visiting Scotland. Sadly neither of us got to go to the Glasgow Willy Wonka experience. But we both wish we could have.

                              <span>Rocket Rat Games co-founder John Guerra remembers the exact day he started working on Cobalt Core&#x27;s first prototype. He and his fellow co-founder Ben Driscoll had just spent a week playing Daniel Mullins&#x27; mysterious roguelike deckbuilder Inscryption at the end of October 2021, but the combination of a bad storm and a power outage ended up forcing Guerra to decamp from his home in Massachusetts and stay with some family until it all blew over. &quot;I got back late on Halloween, just in time to put out a bowl of candy for some kids, and then the next morning we started Cobalt Core,&quot; he tells me.
The pair had been working on a range of different prototypes in the months leading up to this lightbulb moment. As development on their debut game, the spaceship building puzzler Sunshine Heavy Industries, began winding down, &quot;we were throwing all kinds of stuff at the wall,&quot; he says, including games in 3D, a platformer, with Driscoll revealing they even had &quot;a Terraria-like one for a couple of weeks&quot; with a grid-based world that characters bounced around in. But it was playing Inscryption that brought everything to a head. Both had spent hundreds of hours with Slay The Spire, but &quot;Inscryption proved to us that there was still a lot of space to explore in the genre,&quot; says Guerra. And with increasing calls from Sunshine Heavy Industries players begging them to let them fly the ships they were creating in its shipyard sandbox, &quot;you can kind of see how that went from A to B&quot;.

                              <span>In Shakespeare&#x27;s Anthony And Cleopatra, said famous woman says &quot;Give to a gracious message an host of tongues, but let ill tidings tell themselves when they be felt.&quot; I.e., when you have good news you can go round the houses, but if you have bad news - like sending an all-hands email to the staff at EA to let them know that, less than a year after the last round of layoffs, a further 5% of them are getting booted - then you should just come out and say it as quickly and simply as possible.
This is, apparently, not a sentiment ever internalised by Andrew Wilson, EA&#x27;s CEO. Yesterday, when he announced to everyone at EA that a bunch of them were losing their jobs (again), he first spent three paragraphs talking about how EA is doing great, leading the industry, getting increasing engagement from fans, optimising their global footprint and sunsetting games oh yep, there it is, that&#x27;s the &quot;you&#x27;re about to be unemployed&quot; language right there. The company is moving away from &quot;the development of future licensed IP&quot; and toward &quot;our owned IP, sports, and massive online communities&quot;. Therefore: 670 ish devs (by Eurogamer&#x27;s count) must go.

                              <span>We knew the Helldivers 2 team were looking ahead to the future now that they&#x27;d largely overcome the game&#x27;s most significant server issues. But we weren&#x27;t expecting to see new additions quite so quickly, as rideable mechs have been spotted in the wilds. When are they actually being added to the game? No idea. Do they look cool as heck? Yes, absolutely.

Use the plane&#x27;s sea anchor as a rudimentary fishing claw. Need to open a box you found on the beach? The plane&#x27;s the thing, etcetera.

WarioWare: Move It! came to Switch in 2023 and threw us back into the wild world of wacky minigames. Those who enjoyed the experience might want to check out SUPER 56, which launches on Switch later this year and looks to be just as bonkers.
From indie development team Onion Soup Interactive and publisher WhisperGames, SUPER 56 offers a collection of one-button minigames (56 of them, would you believe) for you to drive, fish, date, catch and generally laugh your way through. It doesn&#x27;t seem to quite match the &#x27;Act like a chicken&#x27; level of humiliation in the WarioWare series, but is that really such a bad thing?

Today, 29th February, is Leap Day. It&#x27;s the special occasion that only rolls around once every four years and leaves plenty of room for an extra 24 hours of surprises. Well, it looks like the surprises are coming thick and fast for Theatrhythm Final Bar Line players. Namely, the game won&#x27;t work.
This phenomenon was first spotted by Vooks, which reported that Square Enix&#x27;s latest rhythm game simply would not connect to the relevant servers when booting up, getting stuck on a &quot;Connecting...&quot; message and leaving the game unplayable.

                              <span>Retro revival.
For many younger gamers, the idea that Atari was once the undisputed king of console gaming might seem somewhat farfetched. Yet in the late &#x27;70s and early &#x27;80s, the gaming giant dominated the market with the Atari 2600, introducing audiences to the likes of Adventure, Yars&#x27; Revenge, and Haunted House. However, after a wave of shovelware and some poor management decisions, the video game market crashed in 1983 and was seemingly done for. Until a little company called Nintendo stepped in, that is.
Since then, the Atari brand has struggled to regain its footing in the industry, but with the appointment of Wade Rosen as its CEO in 2021, the company is heading in a decidedly focused direction, leveraging its broad history and expertise in retro gaming to tap into an increasingly growing interest in older games amongst the community.

Embracer Group is continuing to cull its catalogue of developers, but this time it sounds like it might be good news, as Saber Interactive will reportedly be splitting from Embracer in a deal worth $500 million.
As reported by Bloomberg (thanks, Gematsu), the deal will result in Saber Interactive becoming a privately owned company with around 3500 employees. It&#x27;s reported that Saber itself will continue to work on the remake of STAR WARS: Knights of the Old Republic, which changes hands from its own subsidiary, Aspyr.

THQ Nordic has finally unveiled the release date for its open-world RPG Biomutant on Switch. It&#x27;s only a few months away, too, launching on 14th May, 2024.
Originally released for the PS4, Xbox One, and Windows in 2021, the game was subsequently ported to the PS5 and Seriex X/S the following year, making this release on the Nintendo Switch a little late to the party, but a welcome addition nonetheless.

If you cast your mind back to the November 2023 Indie World showcase, you might recall seeing a mystery-filled visual novel called Death Trick: Double Blind. Well, even if you don&#x27;t, this circus story has now revealed a release date of 14th March and it has scored a new trailer too.
Developed by Misty Mountain Studio, Death Trick will see you playing from two different perspectives — a magician and a detective — as you attempt to crack the case of the circus&#x27; missing star. You&#x27;ll be interviewing other performers, poking holes in their stories and looking for clues to get to the bottom of what really happened.

                              <span>A Penny for your thoughts.
It’s now been nearly seven years (yes, really) since the release of Sonic Mania, which indisputably marked a high point for Sega’s troubled blue mascot. Much of the game&#x27;s success could be attributed to the team of passionate and talented fans (led by Christian Whitehead) that came together to develop it, but rather than coast on their success by producing the Sonic Mania 2 that many fans expected, this team instead rebranded themselves as a boutique studio called Evening Star and set out to launch their own IP with a new 3D platformer called Penny’s Big Breakaway.
Though the influence of the Blue Blur is immediately apparent in Penny&#x27;s Big Breakaway&#x27;s design, Evening Star&#x27;s debut adventure very much feels like it asserts its own identity. Some minor performance quirks aside, this is a spectacular, creative, unique, and deeply enjoyable new entry in the 3D platforming genre that no fan will want to miss.

Remember when we highlighted the delightful efforts by @KeshiCorner in preserving Zelda history by 3D scanning a bunch of rare figures from the 1980s? Well, they&#x27;re back at it again with another set of awesome figures from Bandai that would have otherwise remained lost in the relentless passage of time.
This time around, we&#x27;re looking at a complete set of keshi rubber figures from Bandai based on the Super Mario Bros. franchise. These things are about as rare as they come, but thanks to KeshiCorner, they have now been preserved via 3D scanning and can be accessed via the Internet Archive.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been announced for Japan.
If you&#x27;ve been waiting for a hard copy of Dave The Diver, you&#x27;re in luck... kind of. Arc System Works has today announced a physical &quot;Anniversary Edition&quot; of the game for Switch will be launching on 30th May 2024.
As part of this collab, the game will add some content from the fighting game Guilty Gear Strive. This includes themed graphics for the boat and customers who wear themed costumes. There&#x27;s also a rhythm game giving you access to the song &quot;The Disaster of Passion&quot;. It&#x27;s worth mentioning how this isn&#x27;t Dave&#x27;s first collab, as he&#x27;s previously teamed up with Godzilla and games like Dredge.

In other parts of the series (as well as Japan&#x27;s Pokémon cards), it&#x27;s the other way around, with the button attached to the red half of the ball.
Interestingly, it seems The Pokémon Company will be updating this for local audiences in the new mobile title Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket. As highlighted by pixel artist and Pokémon fan &#x27;TAHK0&#x27; on social media, TPC has &quot;finally fixed it&quot;:

The game industry layoffs continue with third-party publisher and developer Electronic Arts today revealing it&#x27;s laying off 5% of its staff, which reportedly equates to about 670 employees.
In a message to the team, Electronic Arts CEO Andrew Wilson cited this as a response to the &quot;accelerating industry transformation&quot;. As a result, the company is &quot;sunsetting games and moving away from development of future licensed IP&quot; which it believes may not be successful.

                              <span>The Trustworthy Accountability Group aims to increase trust in the digital advertising industry, in part by limiting pirate sites&#x27; access to advertising. A new initiative will see the development of a new blocklist containing pirate site domains to be avoided. The idea isn&#x27;t new but here, pirate site data will be combined with data originally obtained by anti-malware vendors, meaning that pirate sites with malicious ads could make themselves even more of a target.

Otevřený DisplayPort, který je skvělý na obrovská rozlišení a spíše kratší vzdálenosti (byť už také lze koupit třeba 15metrový kabel pro 8k/60Hz za 3 tisíce Kč). HDMI je uzavřené, licenčními poplatky a armádou právníků chráněné, ale bez problémů koupíte 20metrový kabel, co protlačí 8k video za 1300Kč (používá optický přenos), či za pár stovek 5metrovou metalickou variantu, též pro 8k/60Hz – jde právě o HDMI 2.1.</span>

                              <span>When will it end? According to GamesIndustry.biz, Electronic Arts announced today that it will be laying off approximately 5% of its workforce which equates to around 670 people. In a note sent out to EA staff, CEO Andrew Wilson indicated the move is part of the company &quot;moving away from development of future licensed IP that we do not believe will be successful in our changing industry.&quot;


Another sweeping layoff in our decimated industry


The moves are part of a larger restructuring plan at EA which includes the closing of some offices and sunsetting of several live games. According to GameIndustry.biz, major external IP games based on Black Panther and Iron Man remain in development.


This is the second time in the last year that EA has performed restructuring plans resulting in hundreds of layoffs after EA cut 6% of staff in March 2023.


Literally one day ago, Sony announced it was cutting almost 1,000 jobs by cutting its workforce by 8%.


We&#x27;re not even a quarter of the way into 2024 and over 7,000 jobs have been lost in the games industry just these last two months. This is immediately after an equally brutal 2023 where over 10,000 jobs were lost. At this point, we&#x27;re looking at an industry that will take years to recover as that amount of jobs will not be created overnight, though they seemingly have been eliminated that quickly.

                              <span>Very, very few games have managed to nail the gist and feel of Half-Life so compellingly as ADACA has. The really interesting bit, though, is that this little-known low-poly first-person shooter - arguably Half-Life’s best copycat - has just received its Episode Three, believe it or not.


It’s fairly apparent that neither Half-Life 2: Episode 3 nor Half-Life 3 proper are on the horizon right now. While Half-Life: Alyx and the wide variety of mods and bonus materials from Valve are a good way to keep the general vibe of the franchise alive, ADACA accomplishes a similar job while still successfully eking out its own dedicated niche. The fact that it’s just received its very own Episode Three is quite funny in its own right, on top of being a compelling piece of new content.

F1 23 was received well by critics, scoring itself an 82 on Metacritic as of February 28. Time will tell whether this year&#x27;s release has enough to differentiate itself from its predecessor.

Prizes for pre-orders


EA has provided you with plenty of incentives to pre-order the upcoming racing game. This is especially true of the Champions Edition which, if pre-ordered before April 24 by F1 23 players, will let you enjoy Time Trial challenges using the new Alpine, Haas, McLaren, and Williams 2024 team cars.


The digital-exclusive Champions Edition is one for the fans, and it comes with two new F1 icons …</span>

One of the bugs causing an uproar is the disappearing Super Credits glitch. Super Credits are a form of in-game currency used to purchase useful items in the Superstore. You can acquire Super Credits by completing missions or by simply buying them using real-world cash.


Some players who have purchased Super Credits complained that their cash is disappearing. This significant glitch leaves players feeling like they wasted their money and got nothing in return. The problem affects players purchasing Super Credits on PSN and those who bought the Steeled Veteran Warbond with Super Credits.…</span>

Then good luck with that going forward, as Nissin just released an ad where a Catboy Sephiroth uses his ever-sexy voice to bully Cloud into slurping down on some Donbei Udon noodles — and he complies. 


We couldn&#x27;t fully grasp the greatness contained in the ad because it was only out in Japanese up until now, but we can now thank Twitter user Aitaikimochi for deciphering this masterwork for English-speaking audiences.




Those short seconds feature better drama, tension, and overall direction than many of the cutscenes from Final Fantasy VII Remake. This is one of the best ads ever made.

                              <span>NetEase has announced its latest AAA studio, BulletFarm, with Call of Duty veteran David Vonderhaar at the helm. BulletFarm is a brand new game development company working on &quot;building a world-class team.&quot; Though the studio is based in Los Angeles, California, it is remote-first. 


BulletFarm game will have an emphasis on co-op


It&#x27;s far too early for any kind of official game announcement, but BulletFarm offered some clues as to what it&#x27;s working on. Most notably is its &quot;emphasis on co-operative gameplay.&quot; Like Call of Duty, that could mean multiple game modes in co-op, multiplayer, and a campaign option, but only time will tell. 


While it&#x27;s light on other details, we at least know this is a brand new IP with first-person perspective. The Vonderhaar-led studio says it is building an &quot;…</span>

                              <span>After some time in development and testing, the Dragon Ball FighterZ rollback netcode update is here to Spirit Bomb the lag away. Those hoping to play some online matches without the delay-based netcode can start doing so, for certain platforms.


The Dragon Ball FighterZ rollback netcode patch will be available for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. However, devices like the PS4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch will still only feature a delay-based netcode mechanic. The Circle Party and Party Battle modes will also be limited to the delay-based netcode.


Rollback will go live for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S on February 29, when those consoles&#x27; versions go live. It&#x27;s also headed to PC at the same time.


As for what the update actually does, it seeks to fix input lag and visual stuttering for compatible online matches through rollback netcode, resulting in much smoother gameplay. Bandai Namco mentions that it &quot;feels closer to offline play&quot; due to its quicker response system.

Unlike consoles, PC will get the option to choose between the rollback or delay-based netcode, depending on the matchmaking performance. Save data transfers are available as well, for those who want to make the switch to a newer console and its netcode.


Many online games have issued out rollback netcode updates in the past, to better the performance of online play. The system has been gradually adopted across fighting games as a preferable option for handling bouts over long distances, using predictive options rather than hitching the action. We&#x27;ve seen the likes of Samurai Shodown and Street Fighter 6 adopt rollback, to help with online lag. And now, Dragon Ball FighterZ has joined the rollback club.


Dragon Ball FighterZ unfortunately continues to not have cross-play functionality. But hopefully, rollback netcode will be a good move for keeping the online bouts of DBFZ going strong.

                              <span>Today, nearly five years after Control first launched, Remedy has announced it&#x27;s fully acquired the rights to the franchise. The studio has acquired full rights from publisher 505 Games, for roughly €17M.


While Remedy Entertainment previously developed the game with 505 Games having publishing, distribution, and marketing rights over Control, this latest transaction converts this authority to Remedy, giving them full rights over Control, as well as the upcoming Control 2 and the multiplayer game currently under the codename Condor.


According to the announcement, publishing agreements for all three games are &quot;immediately terminated by mutual agreement&quot;, outside 505 Games continuing as Control&#x27;s publisher until December 31, 2024. Publishing, distribution, marketing, and other rights are also completely reverted to Remedy &quot;with immediate effect.&quot; 


Remedy&#x27;s announcement also reveals the maximum purchase price of this exchange to be approximately EUR 17 million, equaling the amount 505 Games paid for Condor and Control 2&#x27;s development cycle thus far, plus a premium. Remedy will pay the purchase price over the next 12 months.


In doing this, Remedy Entertainment will &quot;be more directly in charge of marketing, distribution and other business-to-business deals&quot;. The post continues to highlight Remedy&#x27;s plans to have complete control over Control and Condor, detailing that the transaction &quot;enables further financing and partnership opportunities which will help us to grow the Control 2 and Condor, as well as the whole Control franchise into an even greater success than before.&quot;

                              <span>3DRealms is known for its many, many retro first-person shooters, and though Wrath: Aeon of Ruin doesn’t necessarily stand out in this respect, it’s a marquee example of the niche regardless. It’s pretty exciting, then, that its 1.0 version has now launched from Early Access.


Described as a “great mixture of old and new” back in 2019, Wrath: Aeon of Ruin is a strange and enticing combination of the first Quake and Turok, of all things. It’s a rapid-fire boomer-shooter, not unlike DUSK, but with a bit of additional pizazz added on top. Now, with the 1.0 build available and about, players can enjoy the game’s full story, a revised encounter design and improved AI, and a wealth of other previously unavailable goodies.

                              <span>In the early hours of this morning, a ransomware group claimed to have hacked into Epic Games, taking personal data, such as names, payment details, and passwords. However, the Fortnite and Unreal studio has since responded to concerns that anyone has gained access to files, saying it&#x27;s investigating but hasn&#x27;t found any evidence so far.


According to the Australian site Cyber Daily, a group calling itself the Mogilevich gang is claiming to have gotten hold of around 189GB of personal information from Epic. Some of the data said to have been stolen include “email, passwords, full name, payment information, source code and many other data.”


The group is asking someone who works for the company to &quot;buy the data.&quot; While no price has been mentioned, a deadline of March 4 was given, though there was no clue about what would happen if the demand for money wasn&#x27;t met by this date.




No contact made to Epic


In a statement to Eurogamer a few hours ago (plus the above tweet), Epic Games has said it&#x27;s moving fast to investigate these claims.


However, Epic says there is &quot;zero evidence right now that the ransomware claims from Mogilevich are legitimate.&quot; The message goes on to say the studio began investigating &quot;within minutes&quot; of seeing the &quot;screenshot of a darkweb webpage in a Tweet from a third party.&quot;


A recent post on Twitter from Editor-in-Chief of Bleeping Computer Lawrence Abrams says the group is looking for $15K for the allegedly hacked data. However, until Mogilevich contacts Epic, this could well be nothing more than an empty threat. We&#x27;ll be keeping an eye on this story, though.

                              <span>With the long awaited 1.6 update to Stardew Valley finally coming on March 19, fans have taken the opportunity to speculate about what’s to come, including what a little raccoon on the official image could mean. 


Way back in December 2020, update 1.5 brought players a long list of additions, including a new location in Ginger Island. As such, players are currently getting excited at the thought that Update 1.6 could add another new location, Prairie Island.


It’s worth noting before we go any further that this has not been confirmed by ConcernedApe and, at the moment, is just a fan theory.


Is Prairie Island coming to Stardew Valley?




One Reddit post by u/Russ_Guss_Doodles highlights exactly why fans are speculating that Update 1.6 could see Stardew Valley players head to Prairie Island.


Prairie Island is known to have an abundant population of raccoons, as shown in the &quot;Natural Wonders: Exploring Our Vibrant World&quot; film at the in-game Movie Theatre. Ginger Island was teased within the same movie and, again, was added in Update 1.5.


Back in April 2023, ConcernedApe told fans that they were taking a break to work on 1.6, but that the update wouldn’t be as comprehensive as 1.5. However, the developer has also admitted that they’ve worked much harder than they originally anticipated on the upcoming patch, so it’s understandable that players are excited for what’s to come. 




Within the comments on the above tweet, one user asked ConcernedApe about the possibility of a new island and while the developer didn’t outright answer the question, he did say that 1.6 would be more about “adding more to the old stuff”.


For now, we’ll just have to wait and see what that raccoon really means.

                              <span>Last May, Red Barrels unleashed the nightmare that was The Outlast Trials to Early Access. The third installment (or fourth if you count Whistleblower as a separate entry) in the terrifyingly disturbing horror series leans more towards multiplayer, and version 1.0 is about to drop on y&#x27;all.


Recent updates from the developer show that the next patch is almost here, and rolls out on March 5. This will take Outlast Trials out of Early Access. Along with this, the game will come with a brand-new map: the Toy Factory. There will also be new MK-Challenges, and more.




Also, with the 1.0 update, the game itself is going to be going up in price. This means you have until next Tuesday to get The Outlast Trials a bit cheaper. Oh, and it&#x27;s also available to pre-order for consoles as well, so that&#x27;s nice. Check out the PlayStation and Xbox stores for details.


Pushing the boundaries of taste


Ever since I played the first Outlast back in 2013, I&#x27;ve been intrigued by how far Red Barrels can take things. Horror has always been about scaring people or putting them in unsettling or unfamiliar locations. With this series, it goes that one step further by actually creating something disgusting.


Known for its shocking amounts of detailed gore, disturbing content, and sexual themes, the Outlast games have trodden where other survival horror franchises rarelu dare tread.


I&#x27;ve yet to play Trials, but with version 1.0 around the corner, it might be time to re-enter Murkoff once more, because a perturbing amount of violence of psychopathy is evidently what&#x27;s missing in my life.

                              <span>I wasn&#x27;t wrong when I said that the release of Nvidia&#x27;s RTX Remix toolkit would see retro games be given a bit of a spin shine. In this latest example, a modder has taken the original Unreal and injected it with some path tracing and other visual tweaks.


The below video was spotted by DSO Gaming, and shows the 1998 Epic Games release has been given a bit of boost using RTX technology. We see the first level of the classic FPS, as the player shows off the much brighter and bolder colored lighting. Pew pew, indeed.




It should be noted that this is a work in progress, and it&#x27;s still being tinkered with. As a result, you can see a couple of graphical glitches, particularly in the new &quot;shiny&quot; gun. The game was loaded into the Unreal Tournament engine.


This is what first-person shooters used to be like, kids


It would be forgivable for someone unfamiliar with the game to not be able to see what exactly has changed. Fortunately, in response to someone on Twitter, the person behind the mod, Jacob Freeman, uploaded two side-by-side screenshots, which show Unreal with RTX on and off.


It is possible to see a difference, even if it looks like they&#x27;ve just turned the brightness up a bit. As I said, this is still being worked on, so no doubt we&#x27;ll see further progress and improvements.


For those who weren&#x27;t around back then, Unreal was praised for its jump in FPS visuals, utilizing Epic&#x27;s new engine that was named after the game. However, it would soon be left behind when Half-Life came out just a few months later. Valve&#x27;s maiden release essentially stole the spotlight with its genre-shifting development techniques and storytelling methods. Unreal didn&#x27;t stand much of a chance.

                              <span>Developers Cradle Games and Raw Thrills as well as publisher GameMill Entertainment revealed today that the  classic arcade game Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Arcade: Wrath of the Mutants is coming to PC and consoles on April 23, 2024. This expanded version of the arcade beat-em-up marks the first time Wrath of the Mutants is available outside of arcade format.




In Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Arcade: Wrath of the Mutants, players can jump into the action solo or local co-op as Leonardo, Raphael, Donatello, or Michaelangelo. Based on the 2012 Nickelodeon series, Wrath of the Mutants takes place across a variety of environments including Coney Island and Dimension X as players try to defeat the Foot Clan and arch-nemesis Shredder.


All the turtles are voiced by their original voice actors: Seth Green, Sean Astin, Rob Paulsen, and Greg Cipes.


I&#x27;m not gonna lie, I&#x27;ve invested some quarters—who am I kidding, dollars—into this one at Dave and Busters over the years. It will be tempting to just knock out a few levels from time to time. However, even though local couch co-op is a nice touch, It&#x27;s a bit of a bummer not having the option for online co-op.


Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Arcade: Wrath of the Mutants launches on April 23, 2024 on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S and Nintendo Switch for $29.99.

                              <span>With Sunsoft working on their rather strange revival, it seemed like a foregone conclusion that they’d eventually get around to Hebereke. It was probably the company’s most prolific game series, after all, stretching across several games throughout the ‘90s.


The series never really came to North America, but a few were localized for Europe. The first time we saw it on this side of the ocean was when the first game was released on Wii Virtual Console under its European name, Ufouria: The Saga. That was, unfortunately, locked at running at the PAL’s 50hz, which made it run faster on modern displays.


For the rest of the games of the series, they strangely never returned to the original formula of quasi-Metroidvania. The series went through racing, puzzle solving, and even arena fighting, …</span>

Uživatel si u Netlify hostoval jednoduchý web a 4 roky nemusel nic platit. Měsíčně se nikdy nepřeneslo více než 10 GB dat. V únoru se to ale změnilo. Během několika dnů to jenom na jedné písničce v mp3 udělalo 164 TB a za každých 100 GB navíc by měl uživatel platit 55 dolarů. V rámci reklamace byla cena snížena na 5 225 dolarů s tím, že se pravděpodobně jednalo o DDoS útok. Po zveřejnění kauzy na redditu a HackerNews byla i tato částka odpuštěna.</span>

                              <span>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is a great game – you can read Game Informer&#x27;s review here to find out why we liked it so much. However, it&#x27;s massive. Taking place over multiple continents on the Planet (or Gaia as it was retroacively called) with various party members, a bunch of open-world areas, and lots of side activities and minigames to partake in, you&#x27;re going to be playing this game for at least 50 to 60 hours before you roll credits (I reached the ending at 80 hours). 
When you&#x27;ve seen the story through, you might not be ready to hang up the ole&#x27; Buster Sword. Fortunately, Rebirth has New Game Plus. Well, kinda – it&#x27;s complicated. 
Here&#x27;s How New Game Plus Works In Final Fantasy VII Rebirth
After you beat the game, you&#x27;ll be prompted to make a save file (heads up, you can only make 10).…</span>

                              <span>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is finally out, and it&#x27;s a treat, especially for fans of the original game – you can read Game Informer&#x27;s review here to find out what we loved and didn&#x27;t love across our 80 hours with the game. However, regardless of whether you&#x27;re a long-time fan or not, one thing new to everyone playing Rebirth is Queen&#x27;s Blood. 
Introduced early in Rebirth, Queen&#x27;s Blood is an in-universe card game that seemingly everyone around Gaia&#x27;s various continents plays, from Junon to Nibelheim and elsewhere. And after spending dozens of hours playing it, I can understand why - it rules. It&#x27;s easily my favorite game-within-a-game ever, and one I hope spins out into its own thing in some form, be it a digital card game, a physical one, or something else.

I’m not a poker player. I’ve never learned the game, and my limited knowledge of it largely stems from pop culture osmosis, such as James Bond films and referential quips from X-Men’s Gambit. I couldn’t tell you what makes a Royal Flush, but I know it’s good to have it. Despite its premise and appearance, Balatro technically isn’t poker. It is, however, the first title to make me understand and enjoy the core premise of the card game. It also happens to be one of the most engrossing games of the year.

In the statement announcing this news, Deck Nine didn&#x27;t name a specific reason for the layoffs, instead stating the studio has been affected by the industry&#x27;s worsening conditions. Twenty percent of Deck Nine&#x27;s staff is equal to roughly 30 employees, according to a report from Eurogamer. 
Here&#x27;s Deck Nine&#x27;s statement, in full: 


Deck Nine game director Stephan Frost said on X (formerly Twitter) that leadership within the studio took pay cuts to keep the number of layoffs down as much as possible. &quot;This is the strongest team [Deck Nine] has ever been and it absolutely sucks that the industry is in the state that it is presently,&quot; Frost adds.

                              <span>NetEase Games has pulled back the curtains on its newest studio, BulletFarm. Led by David Vonderhaar, whose experience includes leading the teams behind the Call of Duty: Black Ops series, BulletFarm aims to develop a new triple-A game that utilizes first-person gameplay with an emphasis on co-op in Unreal Engine 5. It will be set in an original universe. 
This unannounced and untitled game will &quot;craft a more intimate and relatable experience while offering a fresh take on first-person gameplay,&quot; according to a press release. 
BulletFarm is taking a remote-first approach to game development but considers itself a triple-A studio headquartered in Los Angeles, California. Joining Vonderhaar is the studio&#x27;s creative director Chris Cowell. The studio is currently looking to hire in various roles to fill out the founding team. 

&quot;Starting this new studio has given me a chance to step out of my comfort zone and try my hand at making something entirely new and different,&quot; Vonderhaar writes in a press release. &quot;This is a departure from the games I&#x27;ve worked on, but one that showcases my passion for rich characters, precise mechanics, more intimate storytelling, and plenty of action. NetEase has provided us an incredible support structure to explore these new avenues and allow true freedom to begin building the concept and ideas for our game.&quot; 
NetEase president of global investments and partnerships Simon Zhu says the company is fully dedicated to giving BulletFarm the resources and support it requires to build its new first-person experience. &quot;David&#x27;s leadership and the early collection of game development talent assembled at the studio is set to offer something truly unique for his existing fans along with a new audience.&quot; 
BulletFarm is currently developing its first title, but there&#x27;s no word on when to expect to see it. 
What kind of game do you hope BulletFarm makes? Let us know in the comments below!</span>

                              <span>Concessions stand.
While the demise of physical media has seemed like an inevitability for many years now, boutique publishers are helping to keep a passionate base of physical-only fans with a stocked game library. The scenario right now isn&#x27;t ideal, with eShop releases often only getting a physical version months later (once a publisher has gauged interest and calculated an approach that isn&#x27;t going to leave them lumbered with thousands of costly Switch carts in the storeroom) or with orders only open in a limited window.
Decade-old trends have suggested a movement away from physical from the big players — why create a secondhand market if you can limit resales and maximise your own profits? — although at present Nintendo seems content with the status quo. Microsoft is occupied with Game Pass and Sony&#x27;s number of first-party releases pales in comparison to Nintendo, quantity-wise, so right now it&#x27;s easy to imagine things just staying the same for the next generation — all the big games will still be available in physical form, if that&#x27;s how you want them.

We knew that Outer Wilds would be getting a physical Switch release in 2024. We knew that a Collector&#x27;s Edition would be on the cards. We did not realise how much we would want said Collector&#x27;s Edition.
iam8bit has today revealed the special edition Outer Wilds physical, which is set to ship in Q3 2024 with pre-orders available through the iam8bit website tomorrow (29th February) from 9am PT / 12pm ET / 5pm GMT / 6pm CET.

It&#x27;s time for the next DLC fighter to join Mortal Kombat 1 and with that comes another update.
DC&#x27;s Peacemaker (sharing the likeness and voice talents of John Cena) enters &quot;early access&quot; in the game today before his full release on 6th March. Janet Cage&#x27;s Kameo fighter also enters the fray with today&#x27;s update, though she will not be available until next month too. These additions come alongside a bunch of balancing adjustments and fixes too, of course.

This is, for lack of a better descriptor, charming; a rekindling of an IP and a platforming vibe not seen rendered in such authentic fashion for some time. Ufouria: The Saga 2’s simplicity is to its credit, keeping it real to the source material and the vast catalogue of action platform games that informed much of the Nintendo Entertainment System’s &#x27;80s rule.
The original Ufouria: The Saga was released for the Famicom in 1991 and on the NES in Europe in 1992. It was Sunsoft’s bid to create a band of mascots, with the intention of placing the characters in a series of games, each utilising a different genre. Sunsoft made decent headway with this plan. Those who remember the grey import scene of the &#x27;90s might remember Hebereke’s Popoon for the Super Nintendo, a Puyo Puyo-esque puzzle game that popped with cutesy characters and colourful gelatine blobs.

During Sega&#x27;s Q&amp;A session for its Q3 financial results (thanks, Nintendo Everything), the firm has finally acknowledged that releasing Sonic Superstars right next to Nintendo&#x27;s own Super Mario Bros. Wonder probably wasn&#x27;t the best idea. Though of course, it doesn&#x27;t mention Nintendo&#x27;s flagship by name.
Sonic Superstars (which costs more than Super Mario Wonder on digital storefronts, by the way) was reasonably well received upon launch and received a solid score of 8/10 from yours truly, but considering the critical acclaim received by Super Mario Wonder (not to mention the hype generated by The Super Mario Bros. Movie earlier in the year), it&#x27;s honestly no surprise that Sega&#x27;s platformer failed to meet expectations.

                              <span>Could there be a more than universally relatable quote shared by indie developers than: &quot;We really just wanted to make a small game&quot;? Of course, there&#x27;s little to complain about when games like Cuphead or Owlboy finally see the light of the day, demonstrating what wonders growing ambition can often bring.

Yet, here we are, three years and more than a dozen developer vlogs since TallBoys&#x27; surreal runaway sim first captured everyone&#x27;s attention (including one state-owned Russian news channel). If not for its Kafkaesque premise, which pits players against a ten-story tall looming policeman in a quest to escape a small town, then definitely because of the game’s ambitious voice recognition feature that promised real-time conversation instead of pre-written dialogue.

                              <span>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve fully recovered from my time with Skull And Bones, having suffered tremendously as a result of the review. There might be fun in some of its slower moments, but some of the generally positive, &quot;It&#x27;s actually quite a good game!&quot; takes that I&#x27;ve seen honestly baffle me. The game is a series of long, annoying journeys, during which the most fun I had was turning my head to watch Catfish on my other monitor. MTV&#x27;s show about people getting duped online was the perfect sailing companion, and perhaps, one of the only reasons I survived my brush with the live service seas.

                              <span>If you were to buy every Stellaris expansion and content pack separately at full price, it would run you £227.62. To make that perhaps a little less daunting, Paradox have launched an optional monthly subscription service that gives you access to all the expansions. They&#x27;ve done this for several of their other grand strategy games before. It starts at £8.50 for one month then offers discounts for longer terms. While I can see niche uses for the option, I certainly wouldn&#x27;t want to pay for this regularly. Would you?

                              <span>A long time ago on a desktop far, far away, my family once owned a demo disc for the original Star Wars: Dark Forces. I cannot remember for the life of me which level(s) it contained. My only surviving memory of it is having quite a good time blasting Stormtroopers and the chaps in black with the swoopy, knock-off Vader helmets, but also getting terribly lost and not really knowing what the heck I was meant to be doing. Now, playing Nightdive Studio&#x27;s Star Wars: Dark Forces Remaster as an adult probably close to three decades later, both these feelings have come roaring back, as this is very much a Star Wars FPS in the vein of Doom and other early 90s shooters (thumbs up). But it&#x27;s one that leans so hard into its maze-like level design that it can regularly feel like a little bit of a tough hang in the cold hard light of 2024 (thumbs down).
Crucially, though, not to the point where it&#x27;s best left consigned to the history books. This is still an enjoyable and worthwhile artefact in Star Wars&#x27; PC gaming history, and if your eyes (and general patience levels) can&#x27;t quite stomach the &#x27;Classic&#x27; and still available 1995 original, then this remaster is a pin-sharp glow-up for modern hardware.

A first step on the path to buying a bunch of miniatures. It&#x27;s out now, for £6.50/$8/€8 on Steam, and it&#x27;s very fun.

Expect bug fixes and quality-of-live improvements soon, then new challenging fights later. The developers, Eleventh Hour Games say they&#x27;re &quot;going to have a heavy emphasis on expanding end-game content&quot;. But first, yes, more fixes and improvements to the servers which suffered and stumbled.

Patch 1.2 is the latest of the bunch, and when it arrives next week it&#x27;s bringing with it a &quot;consumption/production&quot; window, upgrades to the Blight Post, and lots of balance changes.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been a hot minute since we last wrote about UFO 50, the 50-games-in-1 8-bit retro collection from the makers of Spelunky, Downwell and friends. It&#x27;s been MIA for several years now (and no wonder, given these are 50 full-sized games being made by several different, and likely very busy, developers), but at long last, Spelunky creator Derek Yu has posted an update on Steam saying the project is finally nearing completion. &quot;We should have a complete game in a few months but are planning for a release in the second half of the year to give us time to do more testing and then marketing,&quot; he said.

                              <span>DarkStone Digital, solo developer of The Mortary Assistant, is making a new horror game based on Paramount&#x27;s Paranormal Activity films. Titled Paranormal Activity: Found Footage, it&#x27;s being published by DreadXP and features some kind of reactive haunt system, with scares dialling up and down based on your actions. DreadXP have shared a teaser consisting of some crackly logos against a backdrop of radio chatter. Given that this is a Paranormal Activity adaptation, it&#x27;s possible the trailer harbours spooky secrets. You may wish to experiment with turning the brightness up and down, playing the video backwards, or watching it again at the next full moon, perhaps while standing in a cemetery loudly declaring that ghosts aren&#x27;t real.

                              <span>Given its zero-tolerance approach to piracy, Nintendo&#x27;s copyright lawsuit targeting the company behind Switch emulator &#x27;Yuzu&#x27; isn&#x27;t a big surprise. While the 41-page complaint throws almost everything at the hugely popular Switch emulation project, Nintendo&#x27;s focus on specific functionality plus knowledge, conduct, and intent, seems to avoid a direct assault on general emulation. It could cover the entire scene with banana peels, however.

Pirate release groups were swift to fix the &#x27;mistake&#x27; but, now that it&#x27;s out, the leak can&#x27;t be unseen.

                              <span>Here&#x27;s something a little different: a seven-port powered USB hub from Sabrent that makes it easy to connect a huge amount of peripherals and drives to your PC without having to fumble blindly with the back of your PC - or turn one of your laptop&#x27;s USB ports into many many more. It normally goes for £30 to £40, but today you can pick it up for just £19 at Amazon UK.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve done some elementary study of the planet Jupiter for various creative research projects/dead-ends. It&#x27;s probably a symptom of my failings as an astronomer, but I have to say that at no point have I noticed any gigantic, depressed clowns. In new platformer Clown Meat, one such gigantic, depressed clown has swum through Jupiter&#x27;s atmosphere, drifted to Earth and kicked off some kind of meatpunk apocalypse, saturating the surrounding countryside with circus-themed abominations.

Such a weak title deserves a much worse game, but this captures the feeling of its late 90s FPS influences as they actually were, and ends up just familiar enough to work, and just original enough to refresh the formula. At times, it&#x27;s a little too accurate, but even with its annoyances dialled up by the pressure of playing it too hard for the sake of review, I&#x27;m impressed with the balancing act it&#x27;s struck.

The actual content of update 1.6 is largely a mystery, but Barone has teased a few things here and there, including that it&#x27;s &quot;mostly changers for modders&quot; that&#x27;ll make it &quot;easier and more powerful to mod&quot;.

                              <span>I seem to be on a highly irritating &quot;refuse to play games as they were intended to be played&quot; spree lately. A couple of weeks ago, it was &quot;I refuse to leave the prologue area in Skull And Bones&quot;, a decision that has sadly been born out by Ed&#x27;s review. Then it was &quot;I refuse to play Helldivers 2 as a co-op shooter&quot;, which again, is a stance I am sticking with, even as I am overrun and sat on by Terminid Chargers. And now it&#x27;s &quot;I refuse to play Cobalt Core as a roguelike deck-builder, because it secretly isn&#x27;t one&quot;. Come now, squint at the header image so that the text and numbers fade away, and all you can see are coloured shapes. Pay attention to certain underlying rhythms while playing. Need I say any more?

Today it&#x27;s Sony&#x27;s turn with the axe: the PlayStation publisher have announced plans to reduce their global workforce by about 8% or 900 people, so as &quot;to future ready ourselves to set the business up for what lies ahead&quot;, in the words of outgoing president and CEO Jim Ryan.
Several well-known PlayStation studios are affected, including The Last Of Us developer Naughty Dog, Ratchet &amp; Clank developer Insomniac Games, Horizon developer Guerilla Games and PlayStation VR specialists Firesprite. It&#x27;s also proposed that PlayStation close Sony London in their entirety, though the exact scale of the reductions remains to be seen.

With a June release now confirmed for Shadow Of The Erdtree, the long-awaited expansion, director Hidetaka Miyazaki has now hinted that we Tarnished may have missed something. One small secret may yet remain, assuming he&#x27;s not pulling another prank, or maybe not. Honestly, Miyazaki should say it has hundreds of undiscovered things. Keep everyone guessing. Communal Internet knowledge has ruined the mystique of video games.

                              <span>Last night I dreamt I had to review a Dragon Age DLC. I reviewed it poorly. I thought that it should not have been marketed as main game DLC instalment when it pivoted to being a magical girl dating sim. This serves to show how unrealistic dreams can be; in my waking hours I am, of course, of the clear-eyed awareness that a magical girl dating sim is entirely in-keeping with the rest of the Dragon Age oeuvre.
I&#x27;m worried about Dragon Age. I&#x27;m worried that so much cost has been sunk, team members changed and redrafting did that it&#x27;ll end up kind of a mess. But that&#x27;s the pessimism talking. What I&#x27;d like to propose is that all the big game companies have a crack at something similar to Amazon&#x27;s (hiliarious and abortive) attempt to officially license fan fiction, which was called Kindle Worlds.

                              <span>As someone who&#x27;s learning Japanese, I crave other methods of language acquisition that don&#x27;t feel like studying. Textbooks, flashcards, even watching Japanese media can all feel a bit too close to being back in a classroom. Shashingo, a game that helps you learn Japanese through taking cute photos, may be the study companion I&#x27;ve craved. And having covered it two years ago when it was first properly shown off, I&#x27;m very happy to see it&#x27;s finally arriving later today.

                              <span>Out of all the Nintendo Direct announcements last week, the one I was most sad to see not get a PC release date was the sequel to the much beloved Metroidvania Ender Lilies. The announcement came as a bit of a surprise, all told, and I was worried I&#x27;d have to consign it to what I&#x27;ve now dubbed my Unicorn Overlord pile of games that are never coming to PC. Happily, publishers Binary Haze Interactive have now confirmed that Ender Magnolia: Bloom In The Mist is, in fact, coming to PC (and other consoles) after all, and that it&#x27;s coming real soon, as its PC early access release has been set for just weeks away on March 25th. Result.

                              <span>Just when you thought it was safe to go back into the Palwoods, Pocketpair have revealed a new Palworld update - Steam and Xbox patch v0.1.5.0. This is a larger overhaul, encompassing a juicy mixture of balance and technical tweaks that together make this spring&#x27;s breakout survival game easier to play, less buggy and, dare I say, a little kinder, with various tweaks aimed at making life more liveable both for trainers and Pals. I have run my eye over the changelog at the bottom of this page and picked out a few highlights, like somebody fishing a stray banknote from the laundry.

                              <span>“Ever since the very first Yakuza on PS2, the Like A Dragon series has always tried to capture the cultural zeitgeist of Japan, reflecting and satirising whatever’s trending around when the game comes out. This means that the way people speak in Like A Dragon is constantly evolving to match the times,” says Dan Sunstrum, senior translator at Ryu Ga Gotoku’s localisation team. Keeping things current is, says Sunstrum, “a challenge in some ways but also means we’re justified in using modern English slang to match, whereas such modernisms might feel out of place in a game set in a completely fictional world.”
Sunstrum uses an example from the studio’s latest, RPS Bestest Best winning RPG Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth, where permed protagonist Ichiban Kasuga meets a dating app designer. “The app’s creator goes on a mini-rant about ungrateful, entitled users, complaining how when anything goes wrong they’re quick to demand wabi-ishi,” slang for free premium currency. “This would have been a tricky word to localise, but it was made easy by the fact that fans of gacha games had already done it for us: they refer to them as ‘apologems’, and that’s what we ended up using in the game.”

As you navigate a reality-bending doomsday loop, your vehicle is the only thing keeping you from impending death – if you&#x27;re good enough at driving it. I&#x27;ve had fun in this world speeding through the forest and grabbing glowing yellow orbs, but the car is one of the most interesting parts to me for one reason: I don&#x27;t have a driver&#x27;s license yet.
After years of procrastination and two expired temporary permits, I&#x27;ve finally started learning to drive in earnest. I spent years of adulthood in the dark, and it&#x27;s been fascinating to open my eyes to something that is an everyday experience for millions of people. And as much as it&#x27;s opened my eyes to a new side of the real world, it&#x27;s making me see video game driving in a differen…</span>

                              <span>A massive sweep of layoffs has rocked various Sony first-party studios today, including Naughty Dog, Guerilla Games, and Insomniac. Another victim is Firesprite Games, the UK studio behind The Playroom games and The Persistence, and an additional casualty from that studio is reportedly a new Twisted Metal title.
According to Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier, Firesprite had a Twisted Metal game in the works that has now been canceled. He reports that the game was a live-service title and very early in development, so it was not yet officially greenlit. You can read his full report here. 
NEW: As part of today&#x27;s mass layoff, Sony has canceled a Twisted Metal live-service game that was in development at UK-based studio Firesprite, Bloomberg has learned.

February 27, 2024
Twisted Metal was PlayStation’s original flagship series, launching a couple of months after the PS1 was released in North America in the fall of 1995. The series includes eight sequels/spin-offs, the last of which remains the 2012 reboot for PS3. Peacock’s well-received live-action series has at least kept the series alive and is getting a second season. 
The number of layoffs to hit Firespirte is currently unknown. Sony acquired Firesprite in 2021, where it helped co-develop Horizon Call of the Mountain with Guerrilla Games. 900 employees have been laid off across several Sony 1st-party studios in various department. Blood &amp; Truth creators London Studio has been shut down entirely. PlayStation Studios Hermen Hulst has cited overgrowth as the reason for the layoffs, and that the publisher has examined its portfolio of upcoming projects to determine which ones will cease production. It would appear that whatever this Twisted Metal project would have been, it&#x27;s among several titles getting the axe.

                              <span>A video game based on the Paranormal Activity film franchise has been announced. Developed by Darkstone Digital, makers of the 2022 horror game The Mortuary Assistant, along with publisher DreadXP and Paramount Pictures, the upcoming game is slated to release in 2026. 
Like the films, Paranormal Activity will feature found-footage-style gameplay as well as a “Haunt System,” which dynamically changes the types of scares that unfold based on players’ actions. Unfortunately, a brief teaser trailer doesn’t do much but show some logos, so we may be waiting a while to see the game in action. 


“We are thrilled to work with Paramount Game Studios and to have the opportunity to bring the world of Paranormal Activity to gamers everywhere,” said Epic Pictures CEO and DreadXP producer Patrick Ewald in a press release. “The films are steeped in rich lore and creative scares, and under the stewardship of creative director Brian Clarke, DreadXP’s Paranormal Activity video game will honor those core tenets and offer horror fans one of our most terrifying games yet.”
Paranormal Activity has no announced platforms. It’s not the franchise’s first foray into video games. A 2017 game called Paranormal Activity: The Lost Soul was released for PS4 and PC and was playable in VR.</span>

                              <span>After recently revealing the full launch roster for WWE 2K24, we now know the superstars arriving post-launch. 2K has revealed the five DLC packs rolling out throughout the year, and they include the Best in the World, one of the biggest female superstar signings in recent memory, and even a Grammy-nominated recording artist. 
CM Punk headlines this DLC roster, marking his first appearance in a WWE game since WWE 2K15 in 2014 (the year he walked out of the company). It would appear the Voice of the Voiceless’ recent social media campaign to be included in the 2K24’s DLC plans paid off faster than expected, and he’s part of the first pack, no less. I smell a work, but it’s good to have him back in an official in-game capacity, regardless.
Other big highlights include Jade Cargill, Pat McAfee, and 2K24 soundtrack curator and award-winning music artist Post Malone. Check out the full list of superstars in each pack below.

                              <span>While the main headline event from today&#x27;s Pokémon Presents showcase was the announcement of Pokémon Legends: Z-A, it wasn&#x27;t the only new game that got announced. It shares that status with Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket, a new mobile game that allows players to collect, trade, and battle with the franchise&#x27;s signature trading cards.
Check out the reveal trailer below:


While there are several features available in the game, Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket seems to focus the most on the collection aspect, which is fitting given the renaissance of physical card games in recent years. While no details on microtransactions are given, the end of the trailer notes that players will get two free packs a day – implying that more than that might come at a cost.
You&#x27;ll also be able to trade cards with other players and battle them online as well. The trailer also shows off immersive cards, which seem to feature a 3D cinematic inside the cards.
The app is being developed by DeNA (best known for their work on Pokémon Masters) and is due out sometime later this year. For more Pokémon cards, check out our Trading Card hub, which features some of our favorite pulls from the game&#x27;s big releases.</span>

                              <span>Sony Interactive Entertainment has announced layoffs at various PlayStation first-party studios, including Insomniac Games (Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man), Naughty Dog (The Last of Us Part II), Guerrilla Games (Horizon Forbidden West), and Firesprite. It is also closing London Studio, the team behind PlayStation VR&#x27;s Blood &amp; Truth and VR Worlds. In a statement released by head of PlayStation Studios Hermen Hulst, he seems to cite overgrowth as the reason for the layoffs. 
PlayStation&#x27;s Technology, Creative, and Support teams are also affected by these layoffs, according to Hulst. He writes, &quot;These are in addition to some smaller reductions in other teams across PlayStation Studios.&quot; These layoffs will result in an 8 percent reduction of staff, or around 900 people losing their jobs.

                              <span>During today&#x27;s Pokémon Presents stream celebrating Pokémon Day, we got our first look at the next major title coming to the Nintendo Switch. Called Pokémon Legends: Z-A, the teaser suggests the game will be set in Lumiose City, a Paris-inspired area first seen in Pokémon X and Y. It&#x27;s not just a long-awaited follow up to Pokémon Legends: Arceus – it&#x27;s an overdue return to the world of Pokémon X and Y.
Check out some images from the trailer below:

The teaser, which does not contain any actual gameplay footage, shows a Pikachu hopping around a city made of glowing blue lines. While it&#x27;s not immediately clear that the city is Lumiose, eagle-eyed fans will notice many familiar friends from that generation of games, including Pyroar, Flabébé, Klefki, and Hawlucha. These images are juxtaposed with architectural sketches and the words &quot;urban redevelopment plan.&quot; This would suggest that Pokémon Legends Z might take place during the construction of Lumiose City, putting it in line with the historical setting we experienced with Pokémon Legends: Arceus.
Other than the teaser, details are scarce. We&#x27;ll have to wait until 2025 to see more. Speaking of 2025, we also recently heard reports that Nintendo&#x27;s Switch successor will come out no sooner than March of that year. For more Pokémon Legends, check out our review of Legends: Arceus, which we called &quot;a worthwhile spin-off adventure.&quot;

As it&#x27;s been a while since I last ran any 64-bit ARM 4K vs. 64K kernel page size benchmarks, while having remote access to the NVIDIA GH200 I ran a fresh comparison for looking at the performance advantages to switching over to a 64K page size kernel. These new 64K kernel numbers are shown alongside the recent AMD EPYC and Intel Xeon CPU reference benchmark results for a look at how the 4K vs. 64K page size affects the overall computing landscape.</span>

                              <span>Experts warned that a radical site-blocking program without proper checks and balances would end badly in Italy. On Saturday, at least one Cloudflare IP address was added to the Piracy Shield anti-piracy system. According to an expert, that ended up blocking a large number of websites, including a charity, a telecoms company, and several schools. It&#x27;s the outcome many people predicted but one that could&#x27;ve been easily avoided.

However, it wasn’t until its 2019 release, 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim, that the developer’s name became synonymous with “you should play this team’s games.” It’s hard to tell what, exactly, made 13 Sentinels the breakout title for Vanillaware, shipping more than 1 million copies worldwide as of August last year, making it the studio’s best-selling title. The easy answer is probably its beloved story, both in how it plays out and how it’s infused into the game’s real-time strategy mech combat.
Publisher Atlus and Vanillaware released it in 2019, so when the team announced its latest title, Unicorn Overlord, last September, it was easy to conclude that this was the studio’s next big focus. And it is, but curi…</span>

                              <span>During last week’s Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase, it was revealed that the 2021 action Metroidvania Ender Lilies: Quietus of the Knight is getting a sequel in the form of Ender Magnolia: Bloom of the Mist. The initial trailer provided a vague 2024 launch window, but we now know it&#x27;s hitting Steam Early Access first on March 26. 
Ender Magnolia: Bloom in the Mist is set within the same universe as Ender Lilies but takes place in the magically saturated Land of Fumes. A mind-warping toxin has been unleashed from the magic-infused soil and dangerous Homunguli ravages the land. It’s up to protagonist Lilac, an “Attunder” capable of cleansing Homunguli, to save the day. You can check out the game&#x27;s new trailer below.


Like Ender Lilies, Ender Magnolia is a dark fantasy Metroidvania in which Lilac is paired with another entity who actually handles the killing: a Spirit Reaper capable of killing Homunguli, which, in turn, adds their abilities to your arsenal. The sprawling 2D adventure tasks players with discovering hidden collectibles, gear, and items to bolster their ability to tackle a variety of bosses.
While it’s unknown exactly how long Ender Magnolia will be in Early Access, Ender Lilies also went through an Early Access phase that wound up working to the game&#x27;s benefit. Ender Magnolia: Bloom in the Mist is slated to launch for PlayStation and Xbox platforms as well as Switch later this year. In the meantime, you can read our positive review of the Ender Lilies: Quietus of the Knight here.</span>

The publication reports that 150 staff members at the British studio were informed today they are &quot;at risk&quot; of being laid off in accordance with U.K. labor laws that require companies to give notice ahead of layoffs. 
Shortly after Bloomberg&#x27;s report went live, the studio tweeted the following statement:

It appeared during the Japanese version of the Partner Showcase, though, and the game quickly picked up steam online, thanks to its cool visual style, over-the-top action, and music by Final Fantasy XV composer Yoko Shimomura.

                              <span>Nier series creator Yoko Taro reportedly teased a third Nier game during the Nier: Orchestra Concert earlier this month. As reported by Eurogamer, during the concert, which celebrated the Nier series&#x27; music in London, Taro apparently made a surprise appearance and asked for people to clap and cheer as loudly as they could so that Square Enix president Takashi Kiryu – in attendance – could hear the demand for more Nier, according to one fan at the event. 
However, the biggest tease of the night came from an on-screen word that appeared multiple times throughout &quot;the story of the show,&quot; SanTheSly, the fan in attendance, writes on ResetEra. 


&quot;[The] word REPENT was shown repeatedly as part of some dialogue,&quot; SanTheSly writes. &quot;The final instance was spelled as R3PENT. Both me and the person I&#x27;d gone with picked up on it and wondered if this was a tease.&quot; 
That sounds like a tease to us; otherwise, why else change the word &quot;repent&quot; to randomly feature a &quot;3.&quot; However, some fans of the series already consider Nier Reincarnataion, a mobile gacha game shutting down in April, to be the third game in the series. On that timeline, Nier (and its remastered Nier: Replicant counterpart) is the first in the franchise and Nier: Automata the second. If Nier Reincarnation isn&#x27;t the true third Nier game, perhaps Taro was teasing that could be on the way – Nier Repent does have a nice ring to it.

                              <span>Japanese outlet Nikkei is reporting that the Switch successor, or &quot;Switch 2&quot; as it&#x27;s been dubbed colloquially within the games industry, is targeting a March 2025 launch, according to VideoGamesChronicle. This report follows earlier reporting from VGC and other outlets like Eurogamer that Nintendo&#x27;s next console was originally targeting a 2024 launch before being pushed internally to the first quarter of 2025, which lines up with Nikkei&#x27;s latest reporting. 


VGC reports that Nikkei writes, &quot;Priority was given to ensure the initial inventory of the successor console and a lineup of software titles at the time of its launch&quot; to curb the possibility of a stock shortage similar to what the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S experienced back in 2020. Following previous reports, Nikkei also writes that Nintendo&#x27;s next console will be a hybrid home console-portable device like the Switch with a larger screen. 
Finally, Nikkei writes the internal target is March 2025 but that the Switch 2 could slip beyond that depending on manufacturing and the software available for the console&#x27;s launch at that time, according to VGC. If it does launch in March of next year, it&#x27;d follow in the Switch&#x27;s footsteps, which launched in March of 2017.
It&#x27;s important to note that all of this should be taken with a grain of salt as these delays remain internal for the time being. The Switch&#x27;s successor hasn&#x27;t even been publicly revealed yet, so there&#x27;s no telling when to expect it officially.

                              <span>What the Car? is a zany racing game in which you are a car with legs that must race around various courses to get the best time possible. Except sometimes you’re not just a car with legs, you’re also a car with a jetpack. Or with wings. Or swimming. Or singing. It’s from the folks behind the similarly absurd What the Golf?, and it’s coming to Steam this year.

                              <span>Nobuo Uematsu, the celebrated composer behind the iconic soundtracks for much of the Final Fantasy series, has said he probably won’t score a full video game again. While Uematsu didn’t rule out creating the main themes for future games, he said that his days of scoring an entire game are likely over - leaving his last complete soundtrack as the OST for mobile-exclusive RPG Fantasian.

                              <span>The roguelikelike deck-building poker game Balatro is frankly the only game I care for right now. My head fizzes with ideas for fiendish combos and deeply illegal hands. I&#x27;m delighted by its deserved success, with the makers boasting that it sold enough to become profitable within one hour then sold 250,000 copies in 72 hours. In a recent interview, the developer claims that part of why it&#x27;s so damn successful is because they&#x27;ve barely played other roguelikelike deckbuilders so it&#x27;s free to do its own thing outside genre conventions. What&#x27;s interesting to me in this is how Balatro has built on a game which did influence it, the slot machine-building game Luck Be A Landlord.

He feels that Siege can &quot;last forever&quot;, adding that &quot;I&#x27;m not going to name names, but you see games go through sequels and just completely drop the ball.&quot;

                              <span>Sometimes I wonder whether every genre fantasy RPG or RPG-inflected game is essentially a journey towards the Big City. Most such games start you off on the periphery of the world, out in the sleepy and/or brutish hamlets of FirstActShire, Chosen One County, and send you on a loose quest towards the cosmopolitan centre, where you&#x27;ll typically learn about the ultimate villain of the piece, gain access to the juiciest concentration of shops, crafting facilities and quest-givers, and glean some hint at the location of the endgame dungeon. Sometimes the quest takes days of playtime, as in Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3. Sometimes it takes less than an hour, as in the original Destiny. It&#x27;s a common-enough device that when an RPG starts you off in the Big City, like Dragon Age 2, or creatively &quot;provincialises&quot; the Big City, like Roadwarden, I feel slightly unnerved.

                              <span>2024 continues its efforts to be the worst year in my memory, as delightful indie development studio Die Gute Fabrik have halted work. The studio, notable for its lovely story-driven games about forging personal connections in strange or difficult worlds - e.g. Mutazione and the more recent Saltsea Chronicles - was unable to find funding for its new project, after a year of searching, so is shutting up work. All of the staff, including the leadership team, will be looking for new work come mid-march.

                              <span>Nightingale’s dapper cast of cross-dimensional pathfinders are right about one thing: realmwalking is dangerous business. Attempt to tele-portal between realities on the Steam Deck, for instance, and you may find yourself trapped in the Stygian void, naught but a frozen loading screen tip for company and suspended hopelessly for all eternity. Or until you hold down the power button.
This crashing tendency alone means that while Nightingale can technically run on the Steam Deck, even without resorting to rock-bottom graphics settings, the current early access build isn’t yet ready for regular handheld play. That’s nothing developers Inflexion Games won’t tell you themselves – they’re &quot;not considering [the Deck] officially supported at launch,&quot; after all – but if you were thinking of giving this gaslamp fantasy survival sim a portable whirl, you might want to let that call to adventure go unanswered.

                              <span>Austrian developers Microbird released a new trailer for their upcoming Alpine dungeon-crawler Dungeons Of Hinterberg over the weekend, giving us a closer look at some of the eponymous dungeon environments we&#x27;ll be biffing monsters in come its release later this summer. In addition to the previously revealed mountainsides and glacial snow peaks, it looks like Hinterberg will have a big green swamp to travel to as well. Question is: will it be a poison FromSoft variety of swamp? Or something more innocuous? Hard to tell with that searingly green water on display, but one thing is certain: with Elden Ring: Shadow Of The Erdtree and its confirmed poison swamp launching on June 21st, this summer won&#x27;t be short on big bog energy.

                              <span>When I did my undergrad degree in the nowadays-blissful-seeming early noughties, I swore off videogames entirely. I sternly and sorrowfully turned my back on such hit releases as Shadow of the Colossus, Far Cry and yes, even, that PC gaming essential Half-Life 2, so as to spend 11-hour days boning up on Aeschylus and Samuel Johnson. Then, two weeks before my final exams, I somehow went out and bought Ensemble&#x27;s Age Of Mythology.
I&#x27;m not sure why - blame the devil on my shoulder, I guess. It wasn&#x27;t even a new release at that point. I managed to get good marks in the exams despite several nights of binge-playing, but what direction, in general, would my life have taken if I hadn&#x27;t bought Age Of Mythology at such a fateful hour? Better or worse? Could I have been some kind of billionaire don with a Pulitzer by now, if it weren&#x27;t for Age Of Mythology? These things keep me awake at night. Anyway, here&#x27;s a little more info about the forthcoming reboot Age of Mythology: Retold, which broadly aims to turn this wrinkled titan of the strategy genre into a proper modern esport.

I would characterise this week&#x27;s new game releases as a gentle blend of cosy simulation and nostalgia, served on a bed of fantasy roguelikes. If I had to pick a most-anticipated, it&#x27;d be a toss-up between the remaster of a shooter I adored in my teens and the breezy amateur photography game that teaches you the kanji for &quot;flower&quot;.

                              <span>V sobotu vyšel kompresní nástroj XZ Utils ve verzi 5.6.0. Mezi novinky patří téměř dokonalá podpora cmake. Oproti autotools již chybí jen spuštění některých testů. Při použití CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE&#x3D;Release se nyní použije přepínač -O2 místo -O3. Jednak není -O3 v případě XZ rychlejší a také výsledná binárka je větší.</span>

                              <span>It&#x27;s been four days since at least 200 .TV domains, many of them linked to pirate sites, suddenly went dark with no explanation. The domains affected by the unprecedented event were all registered at Finland-based registrar Sarek Oy and until late Friday the situation remained grim. However, information provided by Peter Sunde&#x27;s Njalla suggests cause for optimism, potentially in the next few hours or within the next few days.

                              <span>Just three weeks after launch, Italy&#x27;s Piracy Shield blocking system is set for expansion. The news was revealed by the head of AGCOM and local anti-piracy group FAPAV, who also addressed media reports that overblocking is already affecting innocent parties. Those media reports, published by reputable outlets, were dismissed as &quot;fake news.&quot; In reality, the claim that Piracy Shield is &quot;working perfectly&quot; isn&#x27;t just fake, it&#x27;s pure propaganda.

It was not a film I expected to get a metroidvania sequel, but here it is with a new demo and an April release date.

Gone are the days of long strings of buoys and convoluted ship orders. Using ships is now as hassle-free as the other modes of transport. Just add the destination and send the ship on its way! In this post, I’m going to explain how the new pathfinder works and some of the challenges we had to overcome.</span>

                              <span>After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora&#x27;s Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora&#x27;s Mask&#x27;s unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 1 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved. Archived episodes will be uploaded each Saturday on our second YouTube channel Game Informer Shows, which you can watch both above and by clicking the links below.

                              <span>Developer Team Ninja has released a new behind-the-scenes video for the upcoming PlayStation 5 exclusive, Rise of the Rōnin, and it features new gameplay showing off the game&#x27;s tough and fast action combat. Unsurprisingly, the game continues to look great. 
This new look at the game&#x27;s action features conversation from game producer and director Fumihiko Yasuda and animation lead Kosuke Wakamatsu discussing how Team Ninja approached the combat. They say it started with determining the different ideologies within Rōnin history, why certain individuals fought the way they did, and how that translates to a game aiming to be authentic to the Bakumatsu history. 
Check it the new Rise of the Rōnin gameplay for yourself below:

As we await Death Stranding 2: On The Beach, which is due out on PlayStation 5 in 2025, Disney Plus has dropped a documentary that might tide fans over. Titled Hideo Kojima: Connecting Worlds, this film &quot;explores the creative process behind Hideo Kojima launching his independent studio up to the completion of Death Stranding.&quot;
It was announced last year before debuting at the 2023 Tribeca Film Festival but starting today, you can stream it on Disney Plus.

We haven&#x27;t yet watched it but given Kojima&#x27;s love of movies, we&#x27;re excited to see what a documentary about the man himself is like. The release of Hideo Kojima: Connecting Worlds follows the debut of Grounded II: The Making of the Last of Us Part II, which also provided a behind-the-scenes look at video game development. 
For more, read Game Informer&#x27;s Death Stranding review and then read about why Death Stranding Director&#x27;s Cut is worth another trek across America. After that, watch the latest trailer for Death Stranding 2: On The Beach, which is expectedly weird.

                              <span>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth hits PlayStation 5 exclusively on February 29, but reviews for Square Enix&#x27;s latest entry in its Final Fantasy VII remake trilogy dropped yesterday. We enjoyed the game a lot, and you can read about why in Game Informer&#x27;s Final Fantasy VII Rebirth review. It turns out, a lot of reviewers enjoyed the game too, because at the time of this writing, it&#x27;s the second-highest rated game in the Final Fantasy series on Metacritic, as noted by video game sales analyst Benji-Sales on X (formerly Twitter). 
Currently sitting at a 93 on Metacritic, which aggregates various reviews into a single Metacritic score, only one other Final Fantasy game has been rated higher: Final Fantasy IX on PlayStation 1. It has a 94 on Metacritic.
There’s only 6 Final Fantasy games that have gone above a 90 Metacritic score.

As you can see above, with a 93 on Metacritic, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth joins a prestigious list of games in the series with a Metacritic score of 90 or higher, as pointed out by AndSpaceY on X. Now, it&#x27;s important to note that some Final Fantasy games are not rated on Metacritic as the aggregate site was not around when they released. For example, Final Fantasy VI is one of the most beloved entries in the franchise and arguably the best – released in 1994 on the SNES, Metacritic was not around at the time so it does not have a rating on the site. 
Still, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth rating so high is another example of how Square Enix&#x27;s Final Fantasy VII remake project is landing with both critics and fans alike.

                              <span>Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League, the third-person live-service multiplayer shooter from Batman: Arkham series developer Rocksteady Studios, launched earlier this month. It received middling reviews – read Game Informer&#x27;s review here to find out why we gave it a 6 out of 10 – and fans have been less-than-impressed with the shooter. It seems Warner Bros. Discovery is less-than-impressed, too, as the company said in its latest financial call that Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League had &quot;fallen short of our expectations,&quot; as reported by IGN. 


More specifically, that&#x27;s Warner Bros. Discovery chief financial officer Gunnar Wiedenfels who said Rocksteady&#x27;s latest effort fell short of the company&#x27;s expectations. However, Wiedenfels did not mention a sales figure. According to IGN, the executive lamented that Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League&#x27;s missed expectations set Warner Bros.&#x27; games division up for a tough year when it comes to year-on-year comparisons.
Wiedenfels is likely alluding to Hogwarts Legacy, the company&#x27;s massive hit that launched last year and went on to become the best-selling game of 2023, beating out titles like The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III. The sales of Hogwarts Legacy was certainly a tough act for Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League to follow.

                              <span>Penny&#x27;s Big Breakaway, the momentum-based 3D platformer from developer Evening Star, surprise launched earlier this week after appearing in a Partner Showcase Nintendo Direct. During a livestream held by Evening Star on the game&#x27;s February 21 launch, one designer completed the first level with a single, two-minute combo, and it&#x27;s a feat to behold. 
If you haven&#x27;t yet checked out Penny&#x27;s Big Breakaway, it&#x27;s a 3D platformer modeled off the strange and weird platformers of the PlayStation 1 generation, rather than Nintendo&#x27;s popular platforming efforts. As such, the game features a unique moveset that feels similar to Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater, with a Devil May Cry combo meter to boot. 
Check out the Evening Star developer reach a massive 191-move combo in the first stage of Vanillatown, the first world in Penny&#x27;s Big Breakaway, below: 
Vanillatown 1-1 100% in just 1 combo!?

As you can see, this designer – Milena – completes the first level with one continuous combo. We&#x27;re not sure we&#x27;re quite up to the task but we wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if fans of the game spend time outcomboing this score. Only time will tell. 
Penny&#x27;s Big Breakaway is now available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC.

                              <span>It’s been a long time since Little Devil Inside, a promising survival action RPG from indie developer Neostream, has made any noise. The game’s last substantial update came in October 2021. But after over two years of silence, Neostream has come back with a new trailer and cryptic update hinting at what’s been going on with the team.
As reported by The Indie Informer, Neostream’s Kickstarter post, published yesterday, apologizes for the lack of updates and cryptically alludes to an internal conflict within the team, potentially due to clashing visions about the game, being one of the causes. It states in part,
The rest of Neostream&#x27;s update indicates the team has reduced in size but confirms that the founders and core members remain at the studio. The studio assures backers that Little Devil Inside still exists and that it is currently discussing publishing before it can give fans a more substantial update. Until then, the team has prepared a six-minute montage video showing off the game running in Unreal Engine 5.


Little Devil Inside was first revealed way back in 2015 with the launch of its Kickstarter campaign, but it gained its first mainstream recognition as part of the 2020 PlayStation 5 showcase prior to the console&#x27;s launch. You play as an explorer who embarks on research mission at the behest of a university professor to explore a large world filled with beasts both real and supernatural. You&#x27;ll visit different towns along the way to meet quirky citizens, defend yourself from threats with a sword, and engage in survival mechanics like camping and cooking. Despite how much time as past, we ultimately still know relatively little about Little Devil Inside but it has remained a charmer each time it resurfaces. 
Little Devil Inside has no release window but we&#x27;re hoping to learn more concrete details in the near future.</span>

Liability questions are never straightforward, though.

                              <span>Ubisoft boss Yves Guillemot recently said Skull And Bones is a &quot;quadruple-A game&quot;, which I think is very accurate, actually. &quot;AAAA&quot; is the sound that escapes my lips as I embark on yet another hour-long sail to retrieve some logs, or when I&#x27;m doing my little deliveries and a brigantine starts on me. After 11 years in development, Ubisoft&#x27;s pirate game isn&#x27;t necessarily a disaster, I just think its live service model has transformed piracy from a roguish lark on the waves into a tremendously dull series of shipping tasks.

                              <span>When dramatic parents panicked over the satanic influence of Doom in the 90s, maybe they had a point. Doom has burned through people&#x27;s souls and minds, filling them with a desire to play Id Software&#x27;s seminal shooter on every device they can. The question &quot;Can it run Doom?&quot; has driven these demonic vassals to make it playable on everything from tractors to teletext. These hellbound hearts are even daring to corrupt the totemic device of American liberty: the lawnmower. Come April, you will be able to play Doom on the Husqvarna Nera line of robotic automowers. Is nothing sacred?

But that&#x27;s as it should be: if you want to appreciate what Arrowhead&#x27;s Starship Troop &#x27;em up shares with Konami&#x27;s open world stealth bonanza, it&#x27;s better to Helldive on your lonesome.

                              <span>Lil Guardsman is a game that wears its heart on its sleeve. In a victory for normative determinism, this is a fantasy adventure about a small girl named Lil who somehow becomes the first (and seemingly only) line of defence at a city’s border patrol as a guardsman. At various points, both Lil and those around her frequently call attention to the fact that, yes, you are merely a 12-year-old child who is massively underqualified for this task, and that if you’re going to continue filling in for your good for nothing father who’s down the pub gambling on the latest ball game, then really, what do your superiors expect? It’s very self-aware in that sense, and occasionally verges on breaking the fourth wall. This alone will probably be a fairly good indicator of whether you’ll gel with Lil Guardsman’s sense of humour or not, but for the most part, this is a sweet and jovial narrative adventure whose characterful animation and charming voice cast help bring this oddball tale of fate and consequence to life.
It&#x27;s also not shy about where it’s taken its main source of inspiration from either. This is fantasy Papers, Please through and though, albeit one that’s more about interrogating and probing would-be citygoers for information than checking documents and spotting inconsistencies. During the day you’ll be working your post, dealing with the increasingly large, but fixed queues of fantasy species all trying to enter the city gate to go about their business. When you&#x27;re off the clock, it&#x27;s time to pick up the game&#x27;s wider plotlines, with Lil able to travel around the city to set locations where she can chat with other townsfolk, sometimes partake in the odd mini-game or two, and visit the local shop before toddling off to bed. It’s admittedly quite a straightforward interpretation of Lucas Pope’s magnum opus, with star ratings denoting clear right and wrong answers for how you deal with each day’s horde, but you know what they say about first impressions. Good ones go a long way.

                              <span>I know this sort of thing has been said before around these parts, but in scanning through the endless reams of Steam Next Fest demos earlier this month and trying to work out what these games are and whether they&#x27;re worth downloading, I truly believe it&#x27;s a sentiment that&#x27;s worth repeating. When I first saw the name C.A.R.D.S RPG: The Misty Battlefield appear on the Next Fest landing page, I instantly thought, &#x27;Yes, here we go, now we&#x27;re talking&#x27;. 
Well, my first thought was actually, &#x27;Gee, if only there was an easy way to know what this game&#x27;s about based on just the title alone,&#x27; but that&#x27;s just me being facetious. Ultimately, I have a lot of respect for this kind of naming convention, and the fact it&#x27;s also being made by the Octopath Traveler developers Acquire is really just the icing on the cake.

                              <span>What happens when you combine two great puzzle games? You get one puzzle game which makes me, an accredited professional fool, feel dizzy with noncomprehension. That game is Sokobond Express, which launched yesterday and combines the atom-shoving chemistry of Sokobond with the route-planning puzzling of Cosmic Express. So you have to draw paths around a grid to gather atoms to correctly build a desired molecule. That&#x27;s all. Just molecular chemistry and pathing, at the same time. Oh, my poor foolish head.

                              <span>I&#x27;m not sure exactly what I was expecting from Graven, but it still feels like it wasn&#x27;t quite what I expected. That&#x27;s both good and bad. It has the look of a 90s throwback FPS, the cool atmosphere and action RPG (barely RPG, really, restricted to which weapons you upgrade) combat of something from the 2000s like Rune or Dark Messiah, with a hint of a modern immersive sim. There is, I think, a better game to be made with those parts in a different arrangement. This one is only kinda good.

                              <span>This week&#x27;s Nintendo Direct was stuffed full of games that will also be making their way to PC over the next few months, but the one I haven&#x27;t been able to stop thinking about is the newly-announced Arranger: A Role-Puzzling Adventure. It&#x27;s the debut game from a team of indie devs that include Braid artist David Hellman, Carto writer Nick Suttner and Ethereal designer Nicolás Recabarren, and they&#x27;ve also partnered with composer Tomás Batista, who did the music for both Ethereal and Martian colony builder Per Aspera. It&#x27;s a pretty stacked line-up as these things go, but it&#x27;s Arranger&#x27;s world of constantly shifting sliding tiles that&#x27;s really piqued my curiosity. Come and watch the lovely announcement trailer below and see what I mean.

                              <span>Credit to Nightingale, I’ve been enjoying the early access form of Inflexion’s gaslamp fantasy survival crafter a fair bit more than I did its older stress test build. The UI is cleaner and tighter, and I’ve had more space to explore (and enjoy) the mysterious nooks of its magic &#x27;n&#x27; moustaches world. There’s potential here, but it’s very much the raw kind, especially when performance needs as much work as it does.
Besides relying on upscalers like DLSS for truly smooth running, Nightingale currently has a serious stuttering problem, and bumping into an ugly graphical artefact or even a hard crash is worryingly common. I’ve pulled together an optimised settings guide (down below) so that you don’t need to drop the visual quality lower than is strictly necessary, but do keep in mind that this is early access with emphasis on the early.

                              <span>Yesterday I was off sick with a fever and, as I often do when I&#x27;m laid up ill, immediately set out to consume the most nihilistic and depressing entertainment media I could find. On the film front, I watched Session 9, in which some men hired to remove asbestos from a collapsing 19th century asylum do not have a very nice time. On the game front, I played The Tribe Must Survive, a colony management sim from Walking Tree Games GmbH and Starbreeze Publishing, which is now available in early access.

                              <span>After launching Nightingale into early access on Tuesday, developers Inflexion Games (led by former BioWare CEO Aaryn Flynn) have quickly realised a big miscalculation: lots of players want an offline mode. The gaslamp fantasy survival game requires you be online even if you want to play by yourself, which dovetailed poorly with server issues at launch to frustrate folks. Inflexion say that early in development they needed to make a choice between focusing on co-op or offline first, and now think they made the wrong call. They plan to remedy this, but it&#x27;s not yet clear when they&#x27;ll actually add an offline mode.

                              <span>From Software president Hidetaka Miyazaki has acknowledged that members of the Dark Souls studio had misgivings about Elden Ring&#x27;s shift to a full-blown open world format, while qualifying that Elden Ring&#x27;s vision for an open world was never &quot;traditional&quot;. Rather, Elden Ring is an &quot;open world&quot; game in the same way that Dark Souls is a &quot;hard&quot; game, Miyazaki feels. Confused? Well, this is the godfather of the notoriously unforthcoming Souls series we&#x27;re talking about. I&#x27;ve never interviewed the guy, but I suspect he composes his responses using the game&#x27;s soapstone messaging system.

                              <span>Intel&#x27;s Optane drives are legendary in PC tech circles, offering random performance and low latency that remains unmatched amongst PCIe 3.0 drives. This Intel Optane 905P drive is the biggest they ever made at 1.5TB, and now it&#x27;s reduced to $380 when you use code SYADP2Z384 at Newegg. 
For systems that accept PCIe 4.0 or PCIe 5.0 drives, I&#x27;d recommend sticking with our usual gaming SSD recommendations, but for PCIe 3.0 systems this is a fascinating option that emphasises random performance against sequential speeds. I recorded some of the very fastest game load times with this drive when I tested it against other PCIe 3.0 options, and its random write speeds are competitive even with later generation PCIe 4.0 alternatives.

                              <span>Satan has vanished, the throne of hell lies empty, and eight Archfiends are all jostling to be its chief seat warmer. It&#x27;s a great setup for a role-playing strategy game, and the allure of plotting, scheming, backstabbing and shmoozing your way to victory remains as enticing today as it did when Solium Infernum first came to PC in 2009. At the time, it launched to relative obscurity, and was mostly kept alive by dedicated play-by-email multiplayer groups. It was through one of these groups that Armello developers League Of Geeks first came into contact with it, and now, years later, have taken on the task of remaking Solium Infernum for a modern audience.
The original Solium was, by all accounts, an intensely knotty and dense affair, impenetrable to newcomers, or at least to those who were unprepared (or unwilling) to study and absorb all the countless variations and statistics involved in creating your own unique Archfiend. It was a bit like creating a D&amp;D character sheet, only about ten times more complicated, and whose strategic implications may or may not have made themselves apparent until it was far too late. You could biff yourself before you began, in other words, and League Of Geeks have made admirable attempts to tame and streamline this unruly hell beast, doing away with a lot of that initial fussiness. As is perhaps fitting for the theme here, there are unfortunately still a few pesky gremlins causing mayhem behind the scenes at time of writing (I&#x27;m pointing the finger at literal bug queen Beelzebub for this), but for the most part, there&#x27;s good fun to be had in this new incarnation of Solium Infernum - and particularly if you have some willing friends who you soon hope to call enemies.

                              <span>Every few years, gorgeous action adventure Little Devil Inside re-surfaces with another stunning, exciting trailer. We last saw it at a PlayStation State Of Play back in 2021, where it was seemingly on track for a 2022 release.

It&#x27;s been radio silence ever since, but it has now once again resurfaced, with another gorgeous trailer and a promise that the development team, now smaller, is back &quot;with the duty and conscience to fulfill what we set out to do.&quot;

                              <span>As Helldivers 2 continues to be struggling with its own success, suffering wildly overloaded servers that make it sometimes tricky to even log in, a new patch today has added a feature to help alleviate the pressure. Having previously capped the number of players to 450,000, developers Arrowhead have now added an auto-kick to stop people hogging those precious slots while not playing. After 15 minutes, AFK players will now get booted. It&#x27;s clearly not the big fix needed but hopefully fresh duct tape will help hold the co-op shooter together until more permanent solutions arrive.

We also reminisce about our other favourite gaming crossovers, and try to dream up some cross-universe mashups of our own.
Plus! We talk about what we’ve been playing this week, consider whether we would &quot;RoboCop ourselves,&quot; and I disgust Alice with a confectionary confession.

                              <span>Flintlock: The Siege Of Dawn is one of those third person action adventure games I&#x27;ve been quietly looking forward to ever since I first read about it in Edge in May 2022, even though we&#x27;ve seen and heard relatively little about it since. Thankfully, the Flintlock train does seem to be kicking into a gear a bit more now that it&#x27;s steaming toward its Summer 2024 release window, as yesterday developers A44 Games released a new gameplay teaser trailer for it, ahead of a wider reveal planned for next month. The trailer shows more of its melee and magical combat, though personally, I&#x27;m just glad to see that heroine Nor hasn&#x27;t been neglecting her leg days, as we get to see some meaty and powerful kicks in there, too. Love a big kick, me.

While developers Io Interactive did eventually start bringing back Elusive Targets due to popular demand/widespread frustration, some have proved more elusive than others. Four years since he last appeared, a target played by famous dier Sean Bean will return in March. Kill him, kill him while you can. It&#x27;s what he would want. It&#x27;s how he pays his rent. Craft services don&#x27;t even offer him a cuppa until he croaks.

                              <span>The PS VR2, Sony’s currently PS5-exclusive VR gaming headset, looks like it’ll be latching onto the faces of PC owners as well. Tucked away in a PlayStation blog post about upcoming PS VR2 games, Sony Interactive content communications manager Gillen McAllister confirmed that Sony are &quot;currently testing the ability for PS VR2 players to access additional games on PC&quot; and that the plan is have this extra support ready within 2024.

                              <span>Yesterday&#x27;s Nintendo Direct got rather overshadowed by a certain trailer for Elden Ring: Shadow Of The Erdtree, but there were still plenty of good news nuggets to be had in there for us PC folks - which I&#x27;ve summarised for you below. The long and short of it is: more release dates! Loads of &#x27;em! And they&#x27;re all coming in the first half of 2024 as well. I love it when a schedule comes together.

The music companies, including UMG and Sony, counter the statute of limitations argument. In addition, they stress that &quot;hisses, crackles, and pops&quot; on old records are flaws, not a license to copy and digitize the music.

At least five people were arrested on suspicion of various crimes including theft of telecommunications services, fraud, and money laundering. A key suspect targeted in an earlier operation was out of the country. The action follows a criminal complaint filed by companies including Bell, Videotron, and Rogers.

                              <span>PlayStation VR2 launched in February of last year and while its debut featured new first-party titles like Horizon Call of the Mountain, our favorites on the new platform featured previously released titles like Resident Evil Village. Since that launch, support for the platform has been sparse, to say the least, especially from PlayStation itself. However, Sony has revealed it is currently testing PC support for PS VR2, with hopes to make that support available this year. 
&quot;[We&#x27;re] pleased to share that we are currently testing the ability for PS VR2 players to access additional games on PC to offer even more game variety in addition to the PS VR2 titles available through PS5,&quot; a new PlayStation Blog post published today reads. &quot;We hope to make this support available in 2024, so stay tuned for more updates.&quot;


The rest of the blog goes on to detail new and upcoming titles coming to PS VR2, but those are going to be playable with PlayStation 5 consoles. However, it sounds like PC support, which could open up a flood gate for new VR content, might arrive later this year. 
For more about the hardware, read Game Informer&#x27;s PS VR2 review, and then read Game Informer&#x27;s Horizon Call of the Mountain review. After that, read about why Resident Evil Village is the PS VR2&#x27;s best exclusive, and then check out these 10 games to play using your VR headset.

                              <span>Riot Games has rechristened Project L, its upcoming League of Legends fighting game, to its official name of 2XKO. While we still don’t know when it’s coming, we do get another look at it in a new trailer.


The 2D 2v2 tag-team fighter looks very promising based on today’s footage. The game takes cues from Marvel vs Capcom in its assist-focused tag team play and utilizes more simplified inputs to lower the barrier for entry while maintaining strategic depth. Based on previous updates, online play features rollback netcode. Set in the world of Runterra, 2XKO features a roster of League of Legends champions, including Darius, Ekko, Ahri, and Yasuo. As Riot states on the game’s website, it’s still “heads down” working on updates to share, so a release window may not be coming in the near future. 
2XKO was first announced as Project L in 2019 alongside other League of Legends projects, including what would later become Valorant and LoL: Wild Rift. Hopefully, it will cross the finish line sooner than later. What do you think of the game&#x27;s official title and this fresh look at gameplay? Let us know in the comments.</span>

                              <span>Palworld first captured the attention of gamers (and their internet sphere) when it was revealed back in 2021. While that reveal included details about the survival aspects of the game, including multiplayer, crafting, and farming, viewers honed in on the idea of it being Pokémon but with guns. You can capture Pokémon-like monsters called Pals in special balls (and you can capture humans, too), but it&#x27;s smart to shoot them or hack at them with an axe first to lower their health. And then, once under your command, you can give them their own guns to use, of course. 
Following various trailers since that 2021 reveal, including this gameplay showcase and this one highlighting the different Pals you can find, we learned at Geoff Keighely&#x27;s Summer Game Fest last year that Palworld would finally…</span>

                              <span>Mortal Kombat 1 reset the fighting universe when it launched on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC last September. Now, it&#x27;s time for a new fighter from a different universe to join the roster. John Cena&#x27;s Peacemaker, the hero that first appeared in 2021&#x27;s The Suicide Squad and later in his epoynomous HBO Max series, joins the game next week on February 28. 
Ahead of his release, NetherRealm Studios has released the first look at Peacemaker&#x27;s gameplay in Mortal Kombat 1, and it features a lot of justice, a lot of peace, and, of course, a lot of blood. 
Check out the Peacemaker gameplay trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see in the trailer above, Peacemaker is voiced by Cena himself and features moves inspired by the character&#x27;s live-action counterpart. That includes the fatality, which starts with Peacemaker ripping Quan-Chi in half by way of jet pack before sonic booming the rest of his body into bits. 
Peacemaker hits the Mortal Kombat 1 roster on February 28 for those who own the Premium Edition of the game or the Kombat Pack. Peacemaker goes live for individual purchase on March 6. 
Elsewhere in this trailer, we learn that Janet Cage is joining the game as a new Kameo fighter in March – she&#x27;s an alternate version of Johnny Cage from a different reality. We also learn that crossplay (or Krossplay as NetherRealm calls it) will go live on February 28, allowing PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (via Steam and the Epic Games Store) players to fight against each other in-game.

Final Fantasy VII Rebirth has quite the act to follow up – it must both live up to the sky-high expectations set by its predecessor, Final Fantasy VII Remake, and synthesize and modernize perhaps the most crucial chapter in our heroes&#x27; adventure across Gaia. While my 80 hours in Rebirth didn&#x27;t quite match the overall nirvana of Remake, it&#x27;s a game I struggled to put down. A few stumbling blocks, like a bloated and sometimes tedious open world and intermittently uneven pacing, threaten the highs of Rebirth. But an exciting and well-told story, with an a…</span>

                              <span>It&#x27;s been a long time coming, but the first trailer for Borderlands has finally arrived after the first images of the movie emerged this week. First announced in 2015, the live-action film brings Gearbox’s popular co-op loot shooter to life with some big-name stars, bigger explosions, and (hopefully) even bigger laughs. 


Directed by Eli Roth, the film stars Cate Blanchett (Lilith), Kevin Hart (Roland), Jack Black (Claptrap), Edgar Ramírez (Atlas), Ariana Greenblatt (Tiny Tina), Florian Munteanu (Krieg), Gina Gershon (Moxxi), and Jamie Lee Curtis (Tannis). Like the games, the film follows our group of Vault Hunters as they search for a valuable relic on the desert planet of Pandora. They also stumble upon a missing girl with a powerful secret that could endanger the universe. 
Borderlands hits theaters on August 9.</span>

                              <span>Sea of Thieves is the last Xbox first-party game officially confirmed for a new platform. Rare’s shared-world sea-faring pirate game is heading to PlayStation 5 on April 30.
Sea of Thieves joins Hi-Fi Rush, Grounded, and Pentiment as the four Xbox titles going multiplatform, each confirmed today. The PlayStation 5 version supports crossplay with Xbox and PC. “Something we’ve always been passionate about is that idea that we should remove barriers that prevent players from playing together,” says game director Mike Chapman in an announcement video below. 


As associate design director Shelly Preston points out in the video, this marks the first time in Rare’s nearly 40-year history that it’s released a game on PlayStation, which is a wild milestone. Since first launching to a tepid reaction in 2018, various updates and expansions have improved Sea of Thieves and fostered a dedicated community of players. PlayStation 5 players have the benefit of jumping into a now-content-rich game from the get-go.</span>

Like a ship that has changed tack countless times and delayed its arrival at port, Skull and Bones has launched far later than expected and faced trouble along the way. Even so, this pirate adventure surprised me with the breadth of its world, the richness of its commerce simulation, and an approachable and rewarding naval combat system. As a living game built around seasonal content and a growing universe, it has a ways to go to be at its best, but the bones of a quality experience are here.

                              <span>Following today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase, many were surprised the heavily rumored Hi-Fi Rush was absent. However, shortly after that presentation, which confirmed Pentiment and Grounded are both arriving on Switch, we learned that the next of the four previous Xbox exclusives Phil Spencer said last week are coming to additional platforms. Hi-Fi Rush, a rhythm-action title from the studio behind The Evil Within and Ghostwire: Tokyo, is joining the PlayStation 5 library, as confirmed by Xbox Wire.
Hi-Fi Rush surprise launched on Xbox Series X/S and PC in January 2023, quickly becoming a critical darling and fan favorite. While many were shocked the colorful game was created by the horror developers at Tango Gameworks, fans quickly fell in love with the stylish combat, beautiful presentation, and fun integration of music.
Hi-Fi Rush arrives on PS5 on March 19. According to reporting by The Verge, the final previously exclusive game jumping across the aisle is Sea of Thieves. Hi-Fi Rush took home Game Informer&#x27;s 2023 &quot;Best Microsoft Exclusive&quot; award and, as of this writing, has a spot on our Top 10 Xbox Series X Games list.

                              <span>At the time of writing, at least dozens but most likely hundreds of pirate sites are effectively down due to a domain issue at a single registrar. The problem seems to be isolated to sites using .TV domains registered at Sarek Oy in Finland, a registrar well known for its pirate-friendly policies. As things stand, hundreds of domains are completely devoid of DNS, resulting in one of the biggest mass blackouts in recent history.

                              <span>On Monday, anti-piracy coalition ACE announced the shutdown of SiamBit, an 18-year-old torrent site said to have as many as 100,000 paying members, mostly from Thailand. While those details are unusual, the bigger picture is quite extraordinary. Four people arrested on suspicion of running the site include the suspected ringleader, a  professional racing driver in his late thirties. Events show how an arrest in January triggered a domino effect leading right to his door.

While Reddit declined to comply with recent subpoenas for subscriber information, it handed over the personal details of one user last year. A new court filing sheds some light on the type of evidence being sought by the filmmakers, which includes BitTorrent activity and pirate site visits.

                              <span>Today we released our first candidate for version 14! That means we will start to focus on fixing the remaining bugs and stop adding new features. Thanks to the reports made by many of you, we have already solved many of the issues. But there might still be a few issues lurking around in this release candidate. Please share your findings on our issue tracker. Thanks to our translators, about half of the translations are (nearly) up-to-date. For the other half, we might need your help with translating. If your language is missing or has more than a few dozen missing strings, please consider helping to finish your translation. Download Changelog Bug tracker</span>

The pixel-art OpenTTD fonts are iconic, but were designed for 640x480 CRT monitors rather than today’s 4k monsters.

Access real devices with Device Streaming in Android Studio

Device streaming in Android Studio lets you securely connect to remote physical Android devices hosted in Google&#x27;s secure data centers. Powered by Firebase, it&#x27;s the fastest and easiest way to test your app against real devices, including the Google Pixel 8 Pro, Pixel Fold, select Samsung devices, and more.

After connecting to a device, you can deploy your app, view the display, interact with the device (including rotating or unfolding the device), and anything else you might do with a device over a direct ADB over SSL connection—all without leaving Android Studio. When you&#x27;re done using the device, Google wipes all your data and factory resets the device before making it available to another developer.
During Open Alpha, you can use Device Streaming at no cost. To get started simply sign into your Developer account from Android Studio and select a Firebase project. If you don&#x27;t already have a Firebase project, it&#x27;s easy to create one. To learn more, go to Device Streaming in Android Studio.

                              <span>Well, third time’s the charm, or so they say. So let’s try this again, shall we? With beta 3, we’ve restored the cargo types that went missing in the sub-artic and tropical climates. We’ve also included fixes for various other issues which are listed in the full changelog linked below. Thanks to the reports made by many of you, we could solve the issues quickly. But never fear if you’ve missed out so far, there are still a lot of treasures to hunt for in this beta. Please share your findings on our issue tracker. And watch this space as we’ll soon start with our feature posts about the new things coming with OpenTTD 14. In the first installment, you’ll learn why buses don’t always come when they should and what you can do about it. Download Changelog Bug tracker</span>

                              <span>OpenTTD turns 20 this year, and to celebrate we are preparing for one of our largest ever releases. It’s packed with 40 new features, 80 changes, and almost 150 fixes. In the upcoming weeks we will share more posts explaining some of these features in depth. For now, we need your help testing our work. We need as many people as possible to test this beta version of the 14.X release series, so you can find and we can squash as many bugs as possible before the actual release. To guide you a bit towards what you should be looking for: Generic gameplay bugs and crashes. There is a new Ship Pathfinder; test it out. Buoys are optional to use. You can now automatically unbunch your vehicles at a depot. We added our own interpretation of daylength to the game. More on this soon in another blog post. There are many GUI improvements throughout the game. More consistent look, better GUI scaling. There are many more things worth talking about, and this will be made more clear when we approach the release of 14.0. But for now, play the game, and please report any issues you find. The usual titlegame competition has also been announced on the forums. See the page for the exact competition rules if you are interested. Download Changelog Bug tracker</span>
