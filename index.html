                    <span>The year has only just begun, and we&#x27;re already in a fighting mood. Good thing there are plenty of games lined up in 2022 to compete in and throw down in some brutal battles with friends. From sequels to long-running franchises to surprise newcomers and even some old favorites, the slate of fighting games confirmed for this year are looking great so far. We&#x27;ve put together a list of the best-looking brawlers we know of coming in 2022, organized conveniently in release date order. Without further ado, these are the fighting games we can&#x27;t wait to play over the next 12 months.

                    <span>The digital edition of the Elden Ring issue goes live tomorrow at 2 PM CST. At the exact same time, I’ll be heading to the official Game Informer Twitch channel to do a live discussion about everything we saw and played during our nearly 10 hours of hands-on time with From Software’s upcoming dark action RPG. While this obviously comes with a spoiler warning, even with our extensive play session, there are many, many secrets left to discover in Elden Ring – even with the marathon session, I feel like I’ve barely begun to scratch the surface of what Elden Ring has to offer. 
We’ll be talking about mechanics, features, gameplay, environments, and some other big surprises, but From Software has always been quite reserved in what they choose to show off early compared to what’s available in the final game – remember Bloodborne? No one was ready for where that journey would take us! So come hang out, chat, and ask your questions about Elden Ring. While I won’t be able to answer every question, I’ll do my best to facilitate some great conversations about what you can expect diving into Elden Ring. 
In addition to the stream, look forward to a deluge of coverage to hit GameInformer.com soon, including some exclusive video.</span>

                    <span>Iron Galaxy’s upcoming wrestling-flavored battle royale Rumbleverse has been delayed. The first season was slated to launch on February 15, with an open beta taking place a week prior. 
A new release date has not been announced. Iron Galaxy’s blog post states that the game needs a bit more work, saying, “there’s more we want to do to perfect the experience.” Those who purchased the Early Access Pack will receive refunds. In the meantime, Iron Galaxy does plan to hold a tech test on February 12 that PC players can participate in.

Rumbleverse debuted during The Game Awards 2021 and is a brawling-centric take on the battle royale. Players control customizable fighters that throw fists, swing steel chairs, and perform wrestling moves such as suplexes and elbow drops instead of using firearms. These grapplers can also scale buildings for added verticality. Rumbleverse is scheduled to launch on PlayStation and Xbox consoles and is an Epic Store exclusive on PC.</span>

It’s about time. The women’s game of hockey is finally making its way to EA’s NHL series. The latest NHL 22 patch introduces playable women’s teams and full IIHF (International Ice Hockey Federation) rosters to the game, just in time to generate hype for the Winter Olympics in Beijing. This means you’ll be able to take the ice as some of the great icons making a name for themselves in the sport, from Team USA’s speedy Kendall Coyne-Schofield to Team Canada’s “Captain Clutch” Marie-Philip Poulin. 
This is a great moment for the women’s game, and the impact isn’t lost on the players. Marie-Philip Poulin said in an EA Sports press release that “It has been such a privilege to lace up my digital skates for the very first time in NHL
You can watch the trailer above to see elite talents, like Hilary Knight, Sarah Nurse, and Amanda Kessel, react to the news and further discuss its significance. While the trailer also provides our first look at these players on the virtual ice, it will be interesting to see how EA Vancouver represents the different style of play in women’s hockey, which relies less on the body and focuses more on stick play to separate players from the puck. There’s also more puck possession and chances to score in the women’s game. 
The update also makes the IIHF Men’s World Championship playable. EA confirmed sixteen international men’s teams and ten international women’s teams will be available for their respective World Championship modes alongside other popular destinations, such as Online Versus, Threes Now, and Shootout. The latest patch will go live shortly after the latest episode of EA Sports and Uninterrupted Canada’s five-part digital series Breaking Ice, which profiles champions of diversity in hockey.
You can read more about the latest update in the patch notes here.</span>

                    <span>With Dying Light 2 Stay Human right around the corner – it hits PlayStation and Xbox consoles and PC on February 4 – we thought now (or rather, 2 p.m. CT) was the perfect time to brush up on our parkour skills. We might kill a couple dozen zombies while we’re at it, too. 
Dying Light was released on January 27, 2015, and in many ways, it took gamers by surprise. It was a new entry in a franchise, which is exciting enough, but it was also released in a period of the year where not many games do. That’s not necessarily the case anymore, but that’s because Techland and Dying Light popularized (or at least strengthened the idea of) the January release, and they did so to great success.

The studio didn’t stop there, though, as it continued to support the game for years and years.  Just today, Techland announced that it’s giving away free weapon skins in honor of Dying Light’s seven-year anniversary. It seems it’s planning to give the same kind of support to its upcoming sequel because yesterday, Techland revealed its five-year DLC roadmap for Dying Light 2. 
There’s still a little over a week to go until we all get our hands on Dying Light 2, though, so for now, join us in playing Dying Light again. Game Informer editor John Carson will be behind the controls today, and he’s joined by fellow editor Marcus Stewart. They&#x27;ll go live at 2 p.m. CT!

                    <span>Today marks the first day of Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty preview season for Magic: The Gathering, and it’s looking to be an exciting start of the year for the trading card game. Neon Dynasty marks the first return to a fan-favorite plane in 20 years, but instead of working with the same tropes used back in the day, Kamigawa has received a bit of a glow-up.
Set in the present day, 1200 years after our previous visit, Kamigawa is now home to a cybernetic civilization full of robotics, body modifications, and of course, plenty of neon lights. It’s now Magic’s most high-tech plane, a Japanese-inspired cyberpunk realm that I never thought we’d ever see. However, the Kamigawa of old is not lost, as this advanced society lives in balance with the kami, spirits, and nature we know and love.

                    <span>Fans of 2000s platformers may remember Kao the Kangaroo. The punching marsupial first graced North American audiences in 2001 on Dreamcast, PC, and Game Boy Advance and starred in three subsequent titles in the following years. Though the series never reached the heights of a Crash Bandicoot or Ratchet &amp; Clank, that hasn’t stopped Tate Multimedia from resurrecting the forgotten mascot for a brand new adventure.
Kao the Kangaroo is a brand-new title coming this summer that lets players jump, swing, climb, and pummel their way through a variety of colorful worlds. If you’ve caught yourself reminiscing about Kao asking, &quot;wonder if they&#x27;ll ever make a new one of those?&quot; this is your day. Take a look at how Kao is being modernized in the trailer below.

Kao the Kangaroo doesn’t have a firm release date, but it’s coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. It won’t be the only platformer from yesteryear making a comeback. Joe &amp; Mac is also getting a remake which you can read about here.</span>

TAFEP says Ubisoft Singapore has a proper system in place to handle reports of harassment and workplace misconduct and that past reports were handled correctly. The agency also concluded that differences in pay are based on performance, in terms of experience and time at the company, rather than other biases. 
“We’ve put best practices in place at Ubisoft Singapore to ensure a safe, respectful, inclusive, and equitable workplace for every member of our team,” managing director Darryl Long said following the investigation’s conclusion, according to IGN. “We will continue striving to be an exemplary employer in Singapore and the region, one that attracts and retains the best talents and creates amazing games that enrich the lives of our players.” 
It’s important to note that employees at other Ubisoft studios have also voiced that they’ve experienced sexual misconduct, abusive leadership, and more at the company.

                    <span>After years of radio silence and then a sudden, long-awaited update, Dying Light 2 Stay Human is finally launching at the start of next month. Fans of the first game are likely still in disbelief since the sequel struggled to break free from what appeared to be development hell. It&#x27;s been seven years since the zombie-infested Haran was first introduced to the world, and Techland is ready to celebrate with its community as the sequel&#x27;s release date grows closer. Dying Light&#x27;s seven-year anniversary is kicking off with a set of free, flashy weapon skins. 
It&#x27;s been 7 years since the initial release of Dying Light!

The success of your school depends on the performance of your students, which you influence by providing your personalized blend of courses and extracurricular activities.

Whether it’s offering robotics classes, hosting strange rat-themed sporting events, or designing unorthodox dormitories, Two Point Campus lets you build the silliest for-profit institution of your dreams. You can find inspiration on what to make by watching a brand-new trailer below.

                    <span>Guerilla Games has announced that Horizon Forbidden West, the upcoming post-apocalyptic sequel to 2017’s Horizon Zero Dawn, has gone gold. To accompany the news, the studio released some new gameplay footage and screenshots from the PlayStation 4 version of the game. 
When a game goes gold, it means the version of the game being put onto discs has been finalized. However, as anyone that plays games today likely knows, Day One updates are quite a regular occurrence and while Forbidden West has gone gold, Guerilla is likely working on one for this title. That means that sure, when you pop in the disc on February 18, the game will be playable but Guerilla will likely want you to download that Day One patch for an even better launch day experience.

                    <span>Game Informer can exclusively reveal the release date for Kardboard Kings, a new game from developer Henry’s House and publisher Akupara Games. As the name implies, it’s a game about becoming, well, the Kardboard King. That means designing and running the world’s best card game shop, and you’ll be able to do this on PC (via Steam) on February 10. 
You’ll not only need to customize your game shop and continually up its customer base, but you’ll also need to keep players coming back by buying, trading, and selling the rarest and best cards. Of course, you’re free to put your favorites in your card binder just for yourself, though.

                    <span>According to a report by Deadline, the 2021 film reboot Mortal Kombat was successful enough to warrant a sequel.
Moon Knight lead writer Jeremy Slater has been tapped to write the script for Mortal Kombat 2. Slater has also been involved with the James Wan produced adaptation of Stephen King’s The Tommyknockers, and helped develop the graphic novel series The Umbrella Academy for Netflix. Outside of Slater’s involvement, not much is known about the greenlit Mortal Kombat 2 quite yet.
Mortal Kombat was released simultaneously in theaters and on HBO Max in April 2021, raking in $22.5 million its opening weekend, an impressive number in the early months of moviegoers returning to theaters during the ongoing pandemic. However, that strong start was a significant portion of the $83 million total it grossed worldwide after a sharp decline in the following weeks. The film stars Lewis Tan as series newcomer Cole Young along with, Jessica McNamee (Sonya Blade), Josh Lawson (Kano), Joe Talsim (Bi Han/Sub-Zero), Mehcad Brooks (Jax), and Hiroyuki Sanada (Scorpion).
Who do you want to see in the next Mortal Kombat film? Should Johnny Cage be introduced? Should there be a road trip to the other underrepresented realms? Let us know in the comments!.</span>

                    <span>It&#x27;s flying high on Steam, in particular.
Just over a week ago Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel arrived on pretty much all current systems - including Switch - and is also rolling out on mobile. The free-to-play card deck-builder is obviously a significant release for long term fans of the franchise, and the chance to start at no cost can also tempt in a lot of curious players.
It&#x27;s certainly picked up some early steam, and Konami has now confirmed that in just a week it&#x27;s accrued over four million downloads. One metric for judging a game&#x27;s popularity can be the Steam concurrent user count, and at the time of writing it&#x27;s in the top 5 on the platform (having peaked at a whopping 226,802 users today). It&#x27;s not visible in the eShop charts at present, though, but that may change.

The tempting video game Nendoroid collection has just grown larger: Zagreus, the main character from smash hit roguelike game Hades, is getting his own lil plastic guy.
He comes with a few Hades-related props, like Stygius and Aegis, two of the infernal arms available in the game, and a bottle of nectar to give to his friends and/or crushes. He also has two faceplates (sassy and sassier) and a tiny little bloodstone.

                    <span>Kotaro Uchikoshi discusses the upcoming sequel.
Detective adventure AI: The Somnium Files released on Switch back in September 2019, one of a wave of excellent adventure games and visual novels to come to the system over the last few years. Written and directed by Kotaro Uchikoshi, creator of the excellent Zero Escape series, the game put you to work in a near-future Tokyo as detective Kaname Date chasing a serial killer using mind-delving technology that enables him to explore the psyches of potential suspects, unlock memories, and solve puzzles — and ultimately the crime.
The upcoming sequel, AI: The Somnium Files - nirvanA Initiative, sees scenario writer Kotaro Uchikoshi team up once again with character artist Yusuke Kozaki for an adventure that continues in the same mysterious vein, this time with newly-appointed Special Agent Mizuki and returning AI partner Aiba doing the detective-ing.

                    <span>&quot;I refer to him as a Nintendo junkie&quot;.
Ever since video games became a thing, we&#x27;ve seen parents worry about their offspring becoming hopelessly addicted. However, in a world where screentime is possible literally anywhere in the world thanks to the rise of the smartphone, it seems quaint to recall that, way back in 1998, the media was losing its collective mind over the idea that kids might play &quot;more than 2 hours&quot; of video games in a single day.
The archived news report – originally broadcast on ABC 15 in Phoenix, Arizona – looks into the issues with video game addiction, focusing on youngster Shane Erwin and his love of N64 games like GoldenEye 007 and 1080 Snowboarding. While it&#x27;s clear that other gaming brands exist, the fact that the report chooses to focus almost entirely on Nintendo&#x27;s system might not have been the best PR for the firm – especially at a time when it was losing ground to Sony&#x27;s PlayStation.

Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is the best-selling game on Nintendo Switch, and for good reason – it&#x27;s rather excellent. You&#x27;re almost guaranteed to have a fantastic time playing with your trusty Pro Controller (or Joy-Con if you&#x27;re the unlucky one who gets left out), but we&#x27;re here to tell you that there&#x27;s an even better way.
Reddit user snk50 has shared a work-in-progress setup for a home Mario Kart 8 cabinet, and it looks amazing.

Sonic Frontiers was a standout in The Game Awards late last year, giving an enticing look at a large-scale Sonic adventure that&#x27;s due to arrive this year. The game is still mostly a mystery, but Games Radar has nonetheless shared some interesting thoughts from a key leader on the project.
Sonic Team&#x27;s Creative Officer Takashi Iizuka has been careful to avoid describing the game as &#x27;open world&#x27; however, with the term &#x27;open-zone&#x27; suggesting multiple separate biomes and stages.

Maybe you haven&#x27;t heard, but the world is going through this little thing called a global pandemic. Following March 2020 — the month where the COVID-19 virus took hold enough to be taken seriously, and many countries went straight into lockdown — we&#x27;ve been stuck inside for two years, and our world has changed.
But it turns out that maybe we could have avoided all of this if we&#x27;d taken Unforeseen Incidents seriously!

Well, here&#x27;s a blast from the past. Kao the Kangaroo, who fans might remember from the Dreamcast era, is making a 2022 comeback with a reboot headed to Switch and other modern platforms.
From Tate Multimedia, the studio behind the original games that launched in the early 2000s, this new release will see Kao picking up his magical boxing gloves and travelling the world once again to fight off baddies and jump his way through &quot;a colourful and vibrant world&quot;.

                    <span>That&#x27;s pronounced &quot;icks&quot;, not nine.

A couple of years ago, Inti Creates put out Gunvolt Chronicles: Luminous Avenger iX—an interesting spinoff featuring one of the most popular characters from the Azure Striker Gunvolt series. It may have been a bit on the short side, but Copen’s inaugural adventure in a starring role showed that his unique take on the series gameplay could comfortably stand on its own if given the chance. Now, while we’re still waiting for Gunvolt 3, we have Gunvolt Chronicles: Luminous Avenger iX 2 to help tide us over and it’s… well, it’s more of the same. That is to say, it’s still a thoroughly enjoyable and excellently produced action platformer, but you’ll probably be finished with it by the end of your lunch break.
The story of iX 2 picks up shortly after its predecessor&#x27;s ending, with Copen focused on uncovering the origins of a mysterious old blaster rifle he’s recently discovered. During his research, a wormhole suddenly opens that transports Copen and his crew to a mysterious sandy wasteland in another world, populated by decaying robots called Workers. After meeting a Worker named Null, Copen and the gang make their way to the Grave Pillar—a towering steel structure in the desert which allegedly holds the secret to restoring life to this strange world they’re in. Of course, they can’t get through the Grave Pillar without some interesting battles, and they’re thus tasked with overcoming the six Gravekeepers of the tower to take their keys and find out what awaits them at the top of the pillar.

                    <span>Introducing Benedict Pascal and classes.
It was only yesterday that we saw the localised &#x27;character trailer #2&#x27; for Triangle Strategy, but now Square Enix has jumped ahead with the next video focused on Benedict Pascal. It&#x27;s in Japanese, of course, but it nevertheless gives another look at characters, settings and game features.
Some of you may recall Benedict Pascal from the demo, which itself took place part way through the story. As mentioned above this video also shows the ability to switch or upgrade classes once you reach a certain level, a genre staple that&#x27;ll no doubt be important in this title. We also see a similar levelling up tree for weapons, which again suggests that this&#x27;ll be a title with plenty of depth.

Back in the days before massive LCD displays, mankind had to settle with the idea of linking up banks of CRT TVs to create that &#x27;big screen&#x27; vibe – and now, a hacker has achieved the same kind of effect using Game Boy displays.
In his efforts to reverse engineer the Game Boy&#x27;s crude greyscale LCD display, kgsws was able to connect 9 screens to the same console, creating a larger (albeit segmented) version of that famously tiny screen.

One of the great tragedies of all time is that Akira – one of the most influential anime and manga series – has never received a decent video game adaptation. Sure, people have tried, but the resultant efforts always seemed to fall short of the greatness of Katsuhiro Otomo&#x27;s masterpiece.
It turns out we almost had the next best thing in 1996 – an N64 game that borrowed heavily from Akira&#x27;s aesthetic without actually being an official game. OutSider was never officially announced at the time, but one of the developers behind it has released images on Twitter.

                    <span>Isabelle wasn&#x27;t available to explain it, though.
Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp has been out on mobile for over four years, and has proven popular enough that it&#x27;s still supported and given regular updates. It certainly captures a lot of the charm that makes its Switch buddy Animal Crossing: New Horizons such a hit, with the difference being it adopts an alternative style along with microtransactions (it is free-to-start, after all).
Its latest big update is rolling out today and it&#x27;s adding a couple of notable features. First of all, it&#x27;s doubling the number of animals that can be invited to your campsite from 8 to 16, which is a welcome leap. It&#x27;s also adding an optional smart device widget that you can put on your device&#x27;s home screen, a nice touch and another way to open the game.

According to an exclusive over on Deadline, New Line Cinema has hired Jeremy Slater to write the Mortal Kombat 2 script. He&#x27;s the head writer of the upcoming Marvel/Disney+ series Moon Knight. Apart from this, nothing else is really known about the sequel just yet, but according to Slater it will be &quot;bigger and better and bloodier&quot;:

                    <span>Since Intel&#x27;s Alder Lake launch one of the test requests to come in a few times has been about the Intel P-State CPU frequency scaling driver and how its performance differs with the various governor choices available for altering the CPU frequency scaling behavior. Now that Linux 5.16 stable is out and running in good shape on Alder Lake, here are some Core i9 12900K benchmarks looking at various CPU frequency scaling choices and their impact on raw performance as well as CPU thermals and power consumption.</span>

Maybe if we turn away and pretend they&#x27;re not there, it&#x27;ll all burn out when scammers grow tired of being scammed by other scammers. However, one of the few people I do want to hear talk about it all is Yanis Varoufakis, who was Valve&#x27;s in-house economist before becoming Greece&#x27;s finance minister then an MP. In a wonderfully long new interview, he is not impressed by much of the hype, and it is DELIGHTFUL.

                    <span>Be honest with me: when you read the words &quot;Lovecraftian dating sim&quot;, did your mind go straight to a joke about tentacle porn? Horror-themed dating sims are not exactly new, but it&#x27;s rare to be given the opportunity to date the eldritch gods themselves, and taken at face value, it&#x27;s hard to imagine where else this could be going.
Well, allow me to dispel your illusions right away: Sucker For Love: First Date is not an H-game. It is, in fact, the most chaste dating sim I think I&#x27;ve ever played, while also managing to be the most obscenely graphic. You often hear games that straddle different genres accused of not knowing what they&#x27;re trying to be. Sucker For Love does not suffer from this issue: it knows exactly what it wants to be. The challenge is for you, the hapless player, to keep the hell up.

A humble beast, the inventory, yet a feature of many games - sometimes even a necessity. Often we only notice one if it&#x27;s terrible. But boy, a good inventory is worth a dozen mules. So lets talk about them today!
In other news this week, Nate thinks he has come up with an original premise for a Pixar film, only to discover he has invented Seth Rogan&#x27;s nightmare film Sausage Party, and we are officially starting our campaign to get Henry &#x27;Vitamin H&#x27; Cavill on the show. We will be mentioning him every week from now on. Plus: what we like doing on our birthdays, school plays, and pro-wrestling adaptations of Dickens.

                    <span>Boomerangs are cool as hell. The sleek wooden objects careen through the air in a perfect circle - in theory, at least - before returning right back to where they began in the palm of your hand. They’re something that fascinated me as a child, and 20-something years later I still don’t really know how or why they work.


Deflector is like someone taped two swords to a boomerang, Mad Max-style. How does the boomerang still operate with twin blades slashing back and forth on either end? Don’t know. How does it always circle its way back to where you’re standing after dashing around an arena filled with enemies? Not a clue.

The maps were some of the best things about it. Old-school mega-arenas adorned with portal-zappable walls that functioned as DIY shortcuts. As virtual coliseums of chaos go, they were pretty cool. Well, now you can make your own. Splitgate is launching into season 1 this week (the developers insist the last four months have been &quot;season 0&quot;) and alongside a couple of new game modes, there&#x27;s now a map creation tool.

                    <span>The reviews for Pokémon Legends: Arceus have started to hit today, and if you haven&#x27;t read Brian Shea&#x27;s review yet, give it a look right here. Legends: Arceus is a significant change to the traditional Pokémon formula, which is a big deal for a series that hasn&#x27;t strayed far from its roots in over 25 years. Instead of a fairly focused JRPG adventure, where you stroll from town to town, catching and building teams of Pokémon to challenge Gyms and eventually the Elite Four, Legends takes another route.
Legends: Arceus is very different, in fact. It lets trainers explore large open areas and catch monsters in the wild, a years-long dream of mine when thinking of the future of the series. I couldn&#x27;t stop grinning when I first saw the player character sneaking up on an unsuspecting Wurmple and tossing a Pokéball at it. I had the same reaction when Game Freak showed you could start Pokémon battles by choosing which team member to toss out towards the target, just like Ash Ketchum would in the anime. Then I found out that gathering and crafting would be a big component of the game, and I was relieved the last few years of mastering a similar loop in Monster Hunter seems like it&#x27;s going to pay off nicely. 
There&#x27;s a whole host of notable changes potentially coming to the Pokémon series if Legends: Arceus is successful. So, let&#x27;s talk about the experimental aspects packed into the newest Pokémon entry and whether they work or don&#x27;t. I&#x27;d like to know what you think is the most influential change or new feature in Pokémon Legends: Arceus that you&#x27;d like to see in other mainline games moving forward? Is it the semi-open world, the seamless battle and catching mechanics? Will the Strong Style and Agile Style attack modifiers make it to competitive battles and warp that system entirely? Share your thoughts in the comments below.</span>

Nathan Drake’s days of adventuring are over. As we watched him hang up his holster and rope to begin a new chapter in his life, Naughty Dog’s scribes doubled down on the message of “it’s over.” Video game protagonists rarely walk off into the sunset, but Drake’s farewell is as definitive as they come. Naughty Dog wrote Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End as a conclusion to Drake’s story, and it ended on a poetic and satisfying note. To bring him back in starring role would be foolish. It really is over. Is Drake’s name synonymous with Uncharted? He’s wonderfully charismatic and endearing, but we now know he isn’t the lifeblood of i…</span>

                    <span>Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel reminded me that putting yourself out there is challenging. Whether you duel on the regular or are dusting off the deck for the first time in years, pouring your heart and soul into constructing a deck and pitting it against a stranger online is surprisingly nerve-wracking. What if my card synergy isn’t any good? Is my opponent snickering at me because my cards aren’t up to the hottest meta? What if … I lose? That fear can be surprisingly crippling and prevent you from enjoying the best aspect of the game: testing your skills against fellow duelists. Even worse, it keeps you from getting better.
Battling this mindset is something I’ve continually coped with. From 2003 to 2009, I was a competitive Yu-Gi-Oh! player. I never strutted into the hallowed halls of a world ch…</span>

                    <span>Valve wasn&#x27;t joking a few weeks ago when it said that its upcoming handheld Steam Deck was going to hit current shipping targets. Today, the company announced the first batch of Steam Decks will start to be sold to customers on February 25 and sent out shortly after.
More specifically, Valve plans to send out emails to those lucky early reservation holders starting on February 25. From there, customers will have 72 hours to respond and confirm the purchase. If that process proceeds smoothly, a shiny new Steam Deck will be delivered to its new home starting on February 28. Steam Decks held for those who fail to complete the purchase within that three-day period will be available for the next reservation in line. Valve did make it clear that the model that you reserved is locked in as the one you&#x27;ll have the opportunity to buy. There won&#x27;t be a way to switch when the confirmation email comes through. 
Make sure to keep an eye on your inbox if you think you&#x27;ll be eligible to buy the device close to launch. Valve says it plans &quot;to release new order email batches on a weekly cadence.&quot; 
For those interested in how the Steam Deck handles, the same announcement came with some information regarding coverage and reviews. According to Valve, hardware review units will be sent to outlets shortly, and the embargo for final verdicts will also be on February 25. Considering the 72-hour grace period on confirming a purchase, this at least gives potential buyers the chance to inform themselves a little more before pulling the trigger on picking up the anticipated handheld PC. Other preview information may be allowed before the review embargo, but there are no specifics as to what or when.
If you have the Steam Deck reserved, but don&#x27;t know where you are in line, check out the Steam Deck page in the Steam client or website.

The Grim Reaper’s scythe rarely falls upon treasure hunters. The earth collapses beneath their feet, arrows fly from walls, and giant boulders give chase, but these adventurous souls cannot be stopped until they locate an ancient secret. Their expeditions are brimming with rollicking fun, but their stories always end the same way: They live another day, and one less treasure is lost to the world. We know what we’re getting from these serialized stories, and we love them for it. But unlike Indiana Jones (who is still chasing myths and legends at age 73) and Lara Croft (who is turning back the clock), Naughty Dog has said Uncharte…</span>

                    <span>Dying Light 2 Stay Human isn’t even out yet – it hits PlayStation and Xbox consoles as well as PC on February 4 –and while the base game offers 500 hours of gameplay, Techland is already excited to share what’s next for the game after its launch. 
Techland has revealed that it has a five-year roadmap for the first-person zombie parkour game, meaning you’ll be receiving new DLC for it until at least 2027. While that’s quite surprising to learn, fans of Techland’s first Dying Light game are likely already familiar with the studio’s DLC commitments. 
As you can see in the image above, the first bit of DLC will launch in February alongside free Factions-inspired content. Then, sometime in March, Techland will release its first set of Dying Light 2 challenges, followed by a series of events featuring mutated infected in April. Fast forward to May, and you’re looking at another set of challenges coming to the game. Then in June, you can expect the first paid story DLC. 
The five-plus years of support include the following, according to Techland:
A second story DLC
New weapons
New enemies
New stories
New events
New free and paid DLCs
Dying Light 2 hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on February 4. It will hit Switch later since that version was delayed.
While waiting for its release, read about how Dying Light 2’s main story will last about 20 hours (although completing every single thing in it will take upwards of 500 hours), and then check out how that 500-hour length compares to other notoriously long games. Read about the different performance and resolution modes in Dying Light 2 once you&#x27;re done with that.

                    <span>To probably nobody’s surprise, Halo Infinite is a hit. Not only did it review well back when it was officially released in December – Game Informer gave it a 9.25 out of 10 – but many people played it. A quick scroll through Twitter would have told you that, but thanks to Microsoft’s second-quarter earnings call, we now know just how much. 
Video Games Chronicle reports that Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, who is likely still riding the high of acquiring Activision Blizzard, said more than 20 million players have played halo Infinite. Halo Infinite’s multiplayer was launched as a beta back in November before the campaign was released on December 8 on Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC (and on Xbox and PC Game Pass as well).

That’s not all, though, as Nadella also revealed that Forza Horizon 5, the latest arcade racer from Playground Games, has been played by more than 18 million players since its release on Xbox consoles and PC last November. 
“The big bets we have made across content, community, and cloud over the past few years are paying off,” Nadella said, according to VGC. “We saw record engagement as well as revenue this quarter. Game Pass has more than 25 million subscribers across PC and console. We released AAA titles this holiday to rave reviews and record usage. Eighteen million played Forza Horizon 5 and more than 20 million have played Halo Infinite, making it the biggest Halo launch in history.”

Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection is out on Friday, and it features remastered versions of Uncharted 4 and Lost Legacy optimized for PlayStation 5. Honestly, I don&#x27;t know if we really need this collection of games yet – the originals are roughly five years old and are still gorgeous – but being able to play them again in 60 frames per second on the PS5 is an absolute treat. We&#x27;re showing off the second mission from Uncharted 4, my favorite game in the series, which takes place in a prison on the coast of Panama.
Please note the below Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection gameplay was captured internally on PlayStation 5 via Performance Mode.

Our Past Uncharted Reviews:
Uncharted 4:
&quot;A Thief End’s is the best Uncharted yet, delivering a story I didn’t want to end, and an adventure that concludes with a hell of a payoff. The “wow” factor of the world exploding under Drake’s feet has diminished in the years following Uncharted 2, but those moments are still effective, and a true showpiece of the developer’s exquisite craftsmanship for world and gameplay design. All four of Naughty Dog’s games culminate in A Thief&#x27;s End in a fitting and cohesive way that fans should appreciate.&quot; – Andrew Reiner

Read the full review.

Uncharted: The Lost Legacy:
&quot;Given just how fully featured this adventure is, Lost Legacy could have easily been Uncharted 5. Where Naughty Dog goes next is anyone’s guess, but I would love to see Chloe and Nadine return for another hunt, as they’re every bit as engaging as the Drake family. They make a hell of a team.&quot; – Andrew Reiner

                    <span>This week&#x27;s The Book of Boba Fett episode is loaded with surprises and will surely delight fans who consume all of Star Wars&#x27; movies, shows, comics, books, and even video games. The focus of this article is just one of the surprises, which is relatively small compared to others in the episode, but still warrants a big SPOILER warning. I urge you all to watch the episode before continuing on, but if you have no interest in the show, or want to see if the surprise will make you watch, continue on.
It&#x27;s been a big week for Respawn Entertainment. Yesterday, the developer announced three new Star Wars video game projects are in the works, including a follow-up to 2019&#x27;s excellent Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. The star of that game is Cal Kestis, a Jedi in training who just happens to befriend a little droid named BD-1. This new BD droid type was created by Respawn Entertainment and Lucasfilm and has since emerged in other Star Wars stories, including an issue of the Doctor Aphra comic book.
In the fifth episode of The Book of Boba Fett, we get our first look at a BD unit in a live-action show and it&#x27;s as adorable and animated as in the game. This particular droid may be BD-1 and could point to a Cal Kestis cameo or appearance in a future episode or forthcoming Star Wars project.
You can see the BD droid of note below. It definitely looks like it&#x27;s seen some action and is fairly old. What do you think of the cameo? Do you think it&#x27;s BD-1 or just a random BD unit?</span>

                    <span>In 2009, From Software released Demon’s Souls, a game that would go on to be a precursor to a new subgenre of games. Since then, From Software and visionary game director Hidetaka Miyazaki have produced gem after gem, serving up dense atmospheric worlds, brutal challenges, enthralling environments, and incredible triumphs for players to experience. From the horrific nightmares of Bloodborne to the tranquil cherry blossoms of Sekiro, From Software has masterfully applied its core framework of systems to a variety of compelling adventures.
In Elden Ring, From Software’s creation culminates with an absolutely huge open world to explore, with design decisions and features learned from over a decade of honing dark fantasy action/RPG fare. With around 10 hours of hands-on gameplay with Elden Rin…</span>

                    <span>Who isn’t excited for Elden Ring? I mean, the Soulsborne enthusiast himself, Dan Tack, claimed that FromSoftware’s upcoming fantastical RPG will likely be 2022’s GOTY – and that’s just based on the various trailers and his experience with hands-on preview builds! But how long will players be exploring this alleged possible-GOTY sandbox? Well, according to a PCGamesN report, Elden Ring’s mainline story will take around 30 hours to beat, with side content adding in dozens more. Of course, it’s probably safe to throw another ten to twenty hours of “you died” overlays to that runtime, too. 
At the Taipei Game Show, Elden Ring producer Yasuhiro Kitao stated, “This will differ significantly by player, but in terms of the targets set during development, the idea is that the main route should be able to be completed within around 30 hours.” Kitao would later go on to say, “The game as a whole is quite massive, and contains many dozens more hours worth of gameplay, but if we are talking about the main route only, it shouldn’t take much longer than that.” 
I, for one, am happy that Elden Ring won’t be an overwhelming time sink – the notorious loop will likely be punishing enough to keep most players occupied well into the 50-hour range. PCGamesN notes that Elden Ring’s manageable scope mirrors From Software’s other titles. Apparently, Dark Souls and Dark Souls 2 take a little over 40 hours to beat, while the third entry clocks in at around 32 hours. Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is the shortest game, with a less-than-30-hour runtime. 
Elden Ring launches on February 28 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. If you are looking for a time sink, consider Dying Light 2 Stay Human, as it supposedly takes at least 500 hours to achieve 100% completion.

                    <span>At Gamescom in August, Paradox Interactive announced its popular PC strategy series Crusader Kings would finally be making its console debut. Today, the publisher announced Crusader Kings III will be playable from your couch on March 29.

Paradox is calling this release an adaptation, rather than a port, because of all of the changes that have been made to, well, adapt the game for console play. UI, text, menus, and more have been overhauled to provide a more comfortable experience while playing this immersive strategy title with a controller. &quot;The all-new control map lets players quickly and easily navigate the game’s menus via triggers, bumpers, and quick flicks of the analog stick,&quot; reads a press release sent to Game Informer. To utilize the console experience to its fullest, Crusader Kings III will sport faster loading on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, and controller features like haptics and adaptive triggers on the DualSense are supported as well.
Crusader King III was initially released for PC in 2020. This strategy title sets itself apart from others with its focus on emergent player-driven scenarios and entertaining drama of navigating war and diplomacy. Console players can join in on the fun and intrigue in March when this adaptation hits PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, which are available for pre-order today.</span>

                    <span>Resident Evil 4 is arguably the best entry in Capcom’s iconic horror franchise. The game’s staying power is particularly noteworthy as several re-releases and a (leaked) remake continue to bring Leon’s action-packed journey through the plagued Spanish countryside to newcomers and old school players. Moreover, a Resident Evil 4 fan-made Remaster that’s been eight years in the making is slated to finally launch next month, as reported by Eurogamer. And based on the extensive trailer (seen below), it was well worth the wait.

Catching as many Pokémon as you can, learning more about them, and training them to be stronger in battle are the very foundations of Game Freak’s iconic RPG series, but few titles exemplify those core concepts as powerfully as this latest outing. Pokémon Legends: Arceus tasks you with exploring a bygone era of the Sinnoh region, then known as Hisui, and gives you more ways than ever to complete your Pokédex. While some elements don’t feel like their final forms, I love where this new direction takes the Pokémon series.
Pokémon Legends: Arceus’ early hours are full of exposition and long, dialogue-filled scenes. Y…</span>

                    <span>Crysis is a series best known for being a great FPS and a trilogy of games capable of melting graphics cards. Constantly pushing the envelope of FPS visuals with each release, it seems Crytek is ready to melt some more cards because it has officially announced Crysis 4 in a new teaser released today. 
The teaser doesn’t reveal too much – it shows the Sun, a crumbling city, and more, but it ends with a giant “4” and the words, “join the journey [and] become the hero.” You can watch the teaser below for yourself: 
It&#x27;s time to join the journey and be the hero.

                    <span>Thirty-four quality assurance employees formed a new union at Raven Software called the Game Workers Alliance Union. It became the first union at a publicly-traded video game publisher (and the first within Activision Blizzard). The union asked Activision Blizzard for voluntary recognition, but the publisher has revealed that it won’t do that. 
Raven asked Activision Blizzard for the recognition by January 25, and hours after the deadline, an Activision Blizzard spokesperson sent the following statement to Game Informer: 
As the statement above reveals, Activision Blizzard says it considered the Raven union requests and attempted to find a solution that was agreeable to both it and the union. Such a solution could not be found, as the publisher has opted not to recognize the Game Workers Alliance Union voluntarily. As the statement notes, the union will likely now call for a vote, and the National Labor Relations Board will oversee the election. 
The union will now need to receive 50 percent of the votes within its department, plus one more vote, to win the election. At that point, Activision Blizzard would have to bargain with the union based on election process rules. There’s no word at the moment when this NLRB election will occur.</span>

Paramount has announced that a new trailer for the show will premiere this Sunday during the halftime show of the NFL’s AFC Championship.
If you’re planning to catch it live, the AFC Championship Game, which pits the Cinncinati Bengals against the Kansas City Chiefs, begins at 3:05 p.m. Eastern on CBS.

Halo is a joint collaboration between 343 Industries, Showtime, and Amblin Entertainment. The cast includes Pablo Schreiber as Master Chief, Jen Taylor reprising her role as Cortana, Natascha McElhone as Dr. Catherine Halsey, and Bokeem Woodbine as Soren-066. It’s scheduled to premiere on Paramount + sometime this year; maybe this trailer will finally offer a solid release date.

We used to imagine that the future was a magical, sparkly place, full of flying cars and food replicators. It turns out that the future is really just a place where social media managers make confusing memes about a global pandemic. How boring.
The report from Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, which is what they&#x27;re trying to get people to read, states that only 35% of Americans who are eligible for a vaccine booster have actually got it, and they&#x27;re trying to increase that statistic. &quot;Boosting helps us reduce our risk of transmitting to others,&quot; says the report, noting that children, seniors, and immunocompromised people in particular can benefit from reduced transmission rates.

                    <span>My personal top Twitter tip: add pleasant breaks to the nightmares of your feed by following a few good image accounts or bots which regularly post nice things. I like accounts which post rock formations or bots which generate landscapes. Perhaps you find comfort in violence? If so, you might enjoy interrupting your doomscrolling with the Doomscroll Doom Bot, a Twitter bot which is very slowly posting a complete playthrough of Ultimate Doom, one frame every hour.

                    <span>After a short delay at the end of last year, Valve have announced their portable Steam Deck PC is officially launching on February 25th. Sort of. The very first units won&#x27;t actually ship until February 28th at the earliest, but the 25th is the day Valve will be sending out their first batch of order emails to existing reservation holders.

                    <span>&quot;Just tell us about the crystals&quot;, demands Jack, Stranger Of Paradise Final Fantasy Origin&#x27;s prickly protagonist. He has no time for the posh dark elf who applauds him for something. Whatever it is, Jack doesn&#x27;t care. In fact, I don&#x27;t think he knows where he is. If he does, he wants nothing to with it.
This interaction is contained in a new trailer that I deem to be perfect. It sells me on this Final Fantasy action RPG, because it seems like I&#x27;ll get to control someone as impatient as I am. Jack lives for crashing and bashing. The story is an inconvenience for him, the fighting is not.

                    <span>With powerful graphics cards worldwide still being snapped up by cryptocurrency miners, it feels almost cruel for Crytek to announce another Crysis game. Today they confirmed they&#x27;re returning to their supersuit FPS with a new instalment they claim will be &quot;a truly next-gen shooter.&quot; They&#x27;re not clear about what next-gen means to them. Will Crysis 4: a) require a £1500 graphics card; b) be a battle royale; or c) sell NFT hats on the metaverse blockchain cryptonet? Answers on a postcard, reader dear.

                    <span>Activision Blizzard have declined to voluntarily recognise the union forming at Raven Software&#x27;s QA department, forcing workers to take the long approach. The group calling themselves the Game Workers Alliance will now have to hit up the National Labor Relations Board and run elections, but say they&#x27;re still confident about unionising because, y&#x27;know, they have the support of a supermajority. &quot;Once again, when management is given a choice, they always seem to take the low road,&quot; the group said.

                    <span>Although announcing three games at once feels a bit much, I&#x27;m really happy about the Respawn feat. Star Wars news. Respawn Entertainment always felt like one of those development studios that should have been shut down by a bigger studio circa 2015 because the people loved Titanfall but it wasn&#x27;t, you know, Call Of Duty or anything. I turned my back for what seemed like but a moment, and suddenly Apex Legends exists and Respawn are one of the key players under EA, growing stronger from within. One day we&#x27;ll be watching Andrew Wilson at an E3 showcase and realise it&#x27;s actually Vince Zampella&#x27;s eyes looking out at us. Everyone coming on stage to present is just Vince Zampella doing a voice and wearing a different baseball cap.
Point is, I&#x27;m mostly just pleased that Respawn are still around to make games featuring robots that surprise and delight us. And if they&#x27;re not allowed to do Titanfall 3, Star Wars is at least a rich field to till said robots. Lousy with robots, is Star Wars. But honestly, if anyone is going to make Star Wars games (apart from BioWare, who have spent recent years making Dragon Age 4 and / or collapsing like a magnificent neutron star) then I&#x27;d root for Respawn. They may not make the Star Wars games you think you want, but they&#x27;ll make the ones you need right now.

                    <span>V pátek 28. ledna začíná 14. ročník konference DevConf.CZ.  Jde o každoroční komunitní konferenci pro vývojáře, administrátory,  DevOps inženýry, testery, autory dokumentace a další přispěvatele či  uživatele technologií open source. Konference proběhne podruhé online, a  to v termínu 28. - 29. ledna.
Letošní program nabídne více než 100 přednášek v podání 150 přednášejících z celého  světa. Každý den se se můžete těšit na minimálně 6 souběžných streamů s  přednáškami, workshopy a meetupy. Kromě toho si pro vás organizátoři  připravili hromadu dalších interaktivních aktivit: protáhněte se během  online jógy nebo lekce tance; naučte se, jak správně připravit kávu  během živé ochutnávky pod vedením profesionálního baristy z pražírny Doubleshot; nebo se zapojte do simulované bezpečnostní výzvy Capture the Flag. Také pracujeme na vlastní 8-bitové mapě na platformě  WorkAdventure, která bude sloužit k socializaci s ostatními účastníky, přednášejícími a organizátory.
Na konferenci je potřeba se zaregistrovat: https://hopin.com/events/devconf-cz-2022</span>

                    <span>For Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, it’s about drive and it’s about power. He stays hungry and he devours, and today, it’s been revealed that he’s putting in the work (and the hours) to create another video game movie.
Johnson is no stranger to the silver screen, which is where his career resides these days following a great run in professional wrestling. In fact, he’s not even a stranger to being the star of video game adaptations on the silver screen, having starred in the 2005 Doom movie and 2018’s Rampage. In a new interview with Men’s Journal, Johnson said a video game adaptation he’s in will be announced this year, as reported by GamesRadar. 
“I can’t tell you which game in particular we’re doing, but there will be an announcement this year,” he said. “We’re going to bring one of the biggest, most badass games to the screen – one that I’ve played for years.” 
Alright, let the theory churn begin. Fortnite seems like a given, right? He plays The Foundation in it and has been heavily connected to the game for a while now. However, describing it as “badass” would be odd. Sure, Fortnite is a ton of fun and it features exciting gameplay, but it doesn’t scream “badass.” Perhaps he’s taking another shot at a Doom movie? A Call of Duty movie wouldn’t be surprising, either – it’s one of the biggest video game franchises on Earth and Johnson is one of the biggest names in Hollywood at the moment. 
Above all that, though, we’d like to see him in a Gears of War movie. He has the physique to play the larger-than-life characters featured in Microsoft’s Gears series and he already has a would-be costar willing and ready in Dave Bautista, who really wants to be in a Gears of War movie (and we really want to see that happen!).

This list does not include any leaked information and is based on Pokémon shown in official art, screenshots, or footage for Pokémon Legends: Arceus. However, there are quite a few Pokémon we can assume are in the game if their final evolution has been revealed or there is enough evidence for us to say we strongly think they will be included like the Sinnoh Gen 1 evolution cycle (Magmortar, Tangrowth, etc.). While we haven&#x27;t laid eyes on them, we&#x27;ve included their names along with an asterisk. We will try to update this list as more information becomes officially available.

                    <span>Palworld made us do multiple double-takes when it first came to our attention last summer. At first, it looks like any other Pokémon-inspired title. Cute, colorful, plenty of monster catching. And then the main character busts out a realistic assault rifle and starts wasting enemies alongside his adorable companions. In short, it looks amazing, and a new trailer reminds us of that fact.
The game comes from Japanese developer Pocketpair and is a multiplayer open-world survival game where players befriend creatures called Pals. You can journey together as equals or use them as transportation. You can also eat them, exploit them for labor, or force them to enact your destructive agendas. Pals can be captured and traded with other players, and you can breed them too. 
Palworld is harsher than it looks, sporting unforgiving weather conditions, scarce resources, not to mention illegal poachers. There’s also plenty of farming, crafting, and construction, with players able to build houses or even rocket ships. In a dark twist, you can even build factories and put your adorable critters to work assembling guns and other tools. Palworld’s combat features over-the-shoulder style shooting where you’ll mow down poachers as well as hostile Pals. Yes, this is a real video game. Check out the latest look at the game below.

Needless to say, Palworld looks bonkers, and we can’t wait to get our hands on it when it comes to PC sometime this year.</span>

                    <span>Strategy games have been around longer than most, but they still remain niche to most audiences. Some can be pretty intimidating to jump into as a new strategy player. There are resources to manage, armies to control, big decisions to make, many hours of gameplay, and more. However, once you dig into this genre, you’ll find some of the most rewarding gameplay the hobby has to offer. Every victory feels hard-earned. Every loss feels fair (okay, they don’t always feel fair). And failing becomes a chance to learn how you might play better next time. 
This year is fantastic for strategy fans and those looking to finally dive into the expansive genre for the first time. That’s because nearly a dozen great entries we’re excited about are on the way. Of course, there are more, but the following 1…</span>

This podcast will tell you which comic books you should be reading each week, and also dives into the latest developments for comics in video games, movies, and television shows. We&#x27;ll even discuss comic book collectibles and anything we think you should know about that pertains to this entertainment medium.
I&#x27;m joined each week by my dear friend Philip Hoff, who knows comic books better than anyone and has been collecting them with me for over two decades. We often go on comic hunts together, looking to complete runs and discover the next big series to gush about.
We found one such series recently and share our findings in this debut episode. We also dive deep into Insomniac Games&#x27; upcoming Wolverine game, and share thoughts on our favorite video games of all time.
You can listen to the first episode below. In the weeks ahead, new episodes will debut every Tuesday and will appear everywhere where podcasts are available.</span>

                    <span>Azetch Forgotten Gods, the third-person action game that blends Mesoamerican culture with sci-fi trappings, arrives on March 10. Nintendo fans may remember the game’s debut during last April’s Indie World showcase, and it comes from the team behind Mulaka.
Aztech unfolds in a technologically advanced Tenochtitlan. Instead of lying in ruin as it does in real-life, Aztech’s version of the Aztec city never came into contact with Europeans, allowing it to flourish. That doesn’t mean it’s safe from harm, however; an ancient and divine threat looms, ready to strike. It’s up to Achtli, a cybernetically enhanced warrior wielding a giant mechanical fist called the Lightbringer, to protect Tenochtitlan. In addition to pummeling foes with the Lightbringer, the rocket-powered glove also lets you propel Achtili across environments meaning Azetch is as much about mobility as it is action. Check out the latest trailer below.

                    <span>It’s no surprise when a video game developer says they want to make a Marvel game. Marvel is chock full of exciting super villains and heroes to explore in video games, and the different abilities and powers of each make for some exciting gameplay. One only needs to look at titles like Marvel’s Spider-Man to see that. 
However, No More Heroes creator Suda51 recently told Japanese publication Automaton that he’s met with Marvel to talk about working on a game, as reported by Video Games Chronicle. Of course, this doesn’t mean Suda51 and Grasshopper Manufacture, which NetEase recently acquired, are working on a Marvel game, so don’t get too excited just yet. 
When asked about Grasshopper Manufacture’s plans to release three original IP games over the next ten years, Suda51 reiterated this de…</span>

                    <span>The release of Valve&#x27;s highly-anticipated handheld device, the Steam Deck, is right around the corner. Slated to be a formidable rival to the Nintendo Switch, the Steam Deck boasts powerful technology, including an AMD processor, LCD screen, and a dock that allows it to connect to monitors, controllers, and mouse and keyboards. Moreover, Valve is adding a &quot;Dynamic Cloud Sync&quot; – a component that enables seamless save transfers.

According to Eurogamer, the Dynamic Cloud Sync means that players won&#x27;t necessarily need to exit their favorite PC game on the Steam Deck to play it on other devices. An official blog post elaborates on this with more detail:

                    <span>Pokémon Legends: Arceus is out in just a few days, and Nintendo has released yet another trailer, this time revealing some interesting information about the three starters we’ll be using come Friday. 
More specifically, each starter has a final Hisuian evolutionary form. Don’t worry – we’re not going to spoil what they look like here because, well, we can’t. Nintendo didn’t reveal the appearance of these new evolutionary forms, instead opting to tease this new information in today’s trailer.

“You may have met Dartrix, Quilava, and Dewott in your other adventures,” the trailer’s description reads. “But you’ve never encountered their Hisui region Evolutions.”

                    <span>The developer behind the Titanfall franchise, Apex Legends, and Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is looking to expand upon the galaxy far, far away once again. EA and Lucasfilm Games dropped a press release this morning that announced Respawn Entertainment’s upcoming Star Wars IPs. Multiple titles are in the works, including the next chapter in the Jedi: Fallen Order universe, an FPS with Peter Hirschmann (executive producer on the original Battlefronts), and a strategy game via a publishing collaboration with Bit Reactor. 
The press release reads as follows:
“Game Director Stig Asmussen and his team at the studio are already working on the next game in the action adventure Star Wars Jedi series, and are joined by two new teams working to deliver additional unique Star Wars gameplay experiences across multiple genres. Leading the development of Respawn’s all-new Star Wars first-person shooter game is Peter Hirschmann, Game Director at Respawn, who has a long and accomplished history with the Star Wars franchise. The third title is a Star Wars strategy game developed through a production collaboration with the newly formed studio Bit Reactor, helmed by games industry veteran Greg Foerstch. Respawn will produce the new Star Wars strategy game while Bit Reactor leads on the development of the title.”

While Star Wars has always been a mainstay in the video game industry, it seems as if we’re ushering in a new age of exciting next-gen experiences for the franchise. In addition to the Respawn-led titles, Star Wars Eclipse looks to tell a darker story with the impressive levels of interactivity that developer Quantic Dream is known for.  Moreover, an open-world experience helmed by Ubisoft might be the exciting answer fans have wanted since EA VIsceral’s ambitious project was canceled back in 2019.

                    <span>There really is nothing better than pizza, and Epic Games has made it clear that this is true with a new Pizza Party box item that’s been scattered around the Fortnite island. 
Added with today’s v19.10 hotfix, Pizza Party boxes consist of eight “surprisingly nutritious” slices of hot and fresh Slurpshroom Pizza. These pizzas come courtesy of the new Pizza Pit in Tilted Towers, although who knows how their pizza ended up scattered across the entire island. 
“Find Pizza Party boxes scattered throughout the island, then throw one down for an instant feast with the squad – literally throw a party. These boxes of Slurpshroom Pizza contain eight surprisingly nutritious slices – eat them to restore Health and Shield simultaneously until you get 100 Health and 50 Shield.” 
You can also eat slices right from the boxes or save some to use later. This could be especially helpful for squadmates who are on their own or lone wolves ignoring the team play aspect of certain Fortnite modes. Pizza Party boxes can be found in chests, supply drops, loot llamas, and on the ground. You can also purchase some from Tomatohead using Bars.
Epic Games says these items are not currently in competitive playlists but could be after being subjected to an evaluation period, like most items introduced to the battle royale. 
News of this pizza party item comes as various rumors about the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles joining Fortnite continue to swirl. Perhaps this pizza is a way to lure them to the battle royale island or perhaps we’re just stuck in the land of wishful thinking (TMNT would be such a cool crossover, right?). Only time will tell.
For now, read about how an update earlier this month brought tornadoes and lightning to Fortnite, and then check out these dinosarus that made their way to the game alongside the return of Tilted Towers. Take a look at the new Hawkeye and Kate Bishop skins from Marvel’s Hawkeye now in Fortnite after that.

Jack Garland and his conquest to destroy Chaos has had us talking since we learned of it last June. We&#x27;re less than two months from release, and after two betas and multiple trailers, I still don&#x27;t know what is going on in Stranger of Paradise Final Fantasy Origin.
There&#x27;s plenty of action shown off in the latest and apparently last trailer for the game, with Jack and Co. using various classes in battle to destroy hordes of enemies, including the multi-headed Tiamat, which apparently gets crystallized and shattered in the footage. We&#x27;re also introduced to more big baddies like Lich and Kraken and the Final Fantasy 1 boss known as Marilith brandishing some fiery blades. 
We catch glimpses at Jack dressed in regal garb, speaking with Sarah, and gifting her a pitch-black egg-like object, while promising not to forget. Memory is brought up a few times, with one early mention from Jack expressing the opinion that &quot;it&#x27;s a mercy to forget.&quot; The trailer clocks in at almost five minutes and goes all over the place. From dark castles to bright virtual-looking rooms, and camera sweeps over golden fields set to Frank Sinatra&#x27;s &quot;My Way&quot;. I never thought I&#x27;d be hearing Ol&#x27; Blue Eyes on a Final Fantasy soundtrack alongside Limp Bizkit, but here we are. 
Whether you like it or not, Stranger of Paradise Final Fantasy Origin is set for release on March 18 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.</span>

Respawn are leading the projects, working on &quot;the next chapter&quot; in the Star Wars Jedi story, an &quot;all-new first-person shooter&quot;, and partnering with new studio Bit Reactor on a &quot;new Star Wars strategy game.&quot;

                    <span>Vampire Survivors is an action RPG boiled down to its core. You walk around, you kill monsters, you level up, you get stronger, you kill more monsters. In place of story, an inventory, or even the need to fire and aim your own weapons, there is pixel art spectacle. 

On my last life, I killed around 24,000 monsters in 30 minutes. I am hooked.

                    <span>After six long weeks, Final Fantasy XIV is back on sale. That&#x27;s after Square Enix stopped selling the MMORPG after the critically acclaimed life-hog overwhelmed its servers, causing massive server queues and network errors. Thankfully, those days are behind the game now. So yes, if you&#x27;ve been longing to check out its excellent Endwalker expansion or famous smooth grapes, you can! And from a new Oceania server too, because Squeenix now have room for those down under to sample Eorzea&#x27;s delicacies.

                    <span>There was cause for joy and concern alike when Intel revealed the Core i5-12400F, alongside loads of other new 12th gen Alder Lake CPUs. Here was a much more affordable, still gaming focused-alternative to the Core i5-12600K, yet it would lack the signature hybrid of fast Performance cores and flexible Efficiency cores that made that chip one of the best gaming CPUs ever made. 


Turns out, the concern was for naught: the Core i5-12400F is a cracking slice of silicon, both for the money and for games specifically. Although the sole reliance on Performance cores (or P-cores) puts it behind the Core i5-12600K for desktop multitasking, if it’s just the frames per second you’re after, this cheaper chip can match and sometimes even surpass its big brother.

                    <span>Firework actually came out almost exactly a year ago, but the English language version (translated from the original Chinese) was released just before Christmas. Which is a good thing, because Firework is well worth checking out if you have an interest in either horror games or puzzle games. The horror isn&#x27;t blood-chilling, but rather twisted up with grief and sorrow in how inevitable it is. Similarly, the puzzles aren&#x27;t going to stump you for long, but they fit very well with the story. These two strands of the game weave together and create a nice, thoughtful experience that&#x27;s worth the four or so hours of having it.

                    <span>According to From Software producer Yasuhiro Kitao, Elden Ring can be finished in roughly 30 hours. That&#x27;s a really nice amount of time. Long enough to feel substantial, but not too long that it&#x27;ll feel like a massive slog. No bloat, more riding on spectral horse-goat, as they say.

                    <span>Now that Strange Horticulture is out, I would like to make a formal request to all game developers who may be reading this.
Please make a game that is basically Strange Horticulture, but about a weird book shop. Possibly a book shop with a small coffee shop attached. I&#x27;m not going to be too strict about it, you know, I&#x27;m not a monster. It could, for example, be a library. Or maybe there isn&#x27;t another business attached, or the business attached to it is a bakery instead of a coffee shop. This isn&#x27;t just my personal hobby horse, either. I&#x27;m pretty sure loads of people would like that game. And please, for the love of God, tell me if the Mystery Book Shop Game already exists. I&#x27;d be disappointed if it does, because nobody has yet brought it to my attention.

The team at Blackbird Interactive has watched the recent return of the classic RTS games with interest - vested interest, in fact. Tasked by Korean developer Smilegate with transposing their Counter-Strike-style shooter Crossfire to the strategy genre, Blackbird believes it has identified a hole yet to be filled. A nostalgic need to be catered to.
“I argue that in the recent resurgence, we haven’t yet come across an RTS game that offers players an experience comparable to StarCraft or Red Alert,” says game designer Maurice Grela. “We’re hoping to fulfill that gap.”

It seems an obvious scam, which can&#x27;t be good for the game&#x27;s image.

                    <span>Personal data and other records held by ISPs on their customers are highly sensitive and as such, can only be handed over to third parties when the law requires it. In movie piracy cases, judges often order this type of disclosure after consideration but in a new case involving CenturyLink customers, customer details could already be in the hands of some extremely litigious copyright holders.

The YouTube-rippers cited a letter where the EFF defends the non-infringing nature of the youtube-dl software. The RIAA, however, argues that this letter is irrelevant and suggests that the EFF is far from a neutral expert.

                    <span>Behaviour Interactive has announced that in collaboration with Lionsgate Films, it is bringing more Saw content to the Dead by Daylight universe, including Jigsaw. 
This news comes by way of IGN, which revealed that Jigsaw will be featured in Dead by Daylight’s new Archives Tome 10: Saw event. This Tome will go live on all platforms where you can play Dead by Daylight on January 26. 
According to IGN, players will explore the memories of Amanda Young and Detective Tapp from Lionsgate’s Saw movies to unlock the “Book of Saw Collection.” Plus, players will be able to unlock new rewards in the form of outfits for Young and Tapp, and 60 new cosmetics for their own character. 
“Over and above our primary objective of providing our fans with fun and continuously renewed content, one of our goals when integrating a powerful movie franchise such as Saw is to invite a larger community into the Dead by Daylight universe,” director Mathieu Côté told IGN. “We’re truly grateful to our partner Lionsgate for offering us this opportunity.” 
What’s interesting about this is that Saw-related content has already been featured in the multiplayer horror game by way of the Pig killer. Perhaps this means Behaviour Interactive is going to double-dip into other horror franchises it’s collaborated with in the past. 
While waiting for Jigsaw to join the game on January 26, read about the most recent DLC, Portrait of a Murder, that hit Dead by Daylight back in November, and then check out the teaser for the upcoming chapter based on The Ring. Read our thoughts on the game in Game Informer’s Dead by Daylight review after that.

                    <span>Respawn Entertainment released another Apex Legends: Stories from the Outlands short today called Judgement, and it’s all about Mad Maggie, who also happens to be the new Legend joining the battle royale. 
The story begins with what appears to be a court case for Mad Maggie. Of course, she wasn’t really doing anything too wrong – she just did some things the Syndicate is not happy about, like getting food to the starving and more.

We then see Maggie outside, cuffed and surrounded by security. Seconds away from death by way of a firing squad, Maggie is spared by the Apex Games, which is where she’ll be competing as a form of punishment. Maggie is quite alright with this, though, and it’ll be up to players to determine how she plays in the battle royale. 
The official launch trailer for Mad Maggie and the Defiance season that kicks off with her joining the game will go live on January 27. Respawn also revealed a new limited-time mode called Control that will launch with the start of the Defiance season. 
“For the first three weeks of Defiance, see whether you can handle the madness in the new Control mode,” the Apex Legends website reads. “Select your loadout and drop into a 9v9 experience where teams battle to hold control points with infinite respawn.” 
We’ll learn more about Control and Mad Maggie later this week when the Defiance season trailer is released on January 27. While waiting for that, check out our thoughts on the game in Game Informer’s Apex Legends review and then find out why it’s on our list of the top 10 shooters to play right now. Be sure to watch this Apex Legends Bangalore short after that.

                    <span>A Memoir Blue seized our attention during last summer’s Annapurna Showcase thanks to its dazzling visuals and emotional storytelling. Today, we found out that March 24 will be the day we can dive into this surreal aquatic adventure. 
The game stars Miriam, a champion swimmer who embarks on a dream-like journey through her rocky childhood, reflecting on her complicated relationship with her mother. Developer Cloisters Interactive bills A Memoir Blue as an interactive poem that unfolds through a series of vignettes that come to life through a blend of traditional 3D art and 2D animated visuals. It’s one of those games that’s best seen in motion, which you can do by watching the latest trailer below.

A Memoir Blue will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. It’s also coming to Xbox Game Pass.</span>

Today the makers of the Unity engine announced the acquisition of Ziva Dynamics, a company whose tech specialises in simulating skin and meat to make fancy facial animations and meaty muscle and such. Their tech powered the flappy flesh of the troll in a recent Hellblade 2 trailer, and has been seen on PlayStations in Spider-Man: Miles Morales.

I ended up going with Studio Pixel Punk&#x27;s Unsighted in the end, but it was very nearly OPUS: Echo Of Starsong, a stunning visual novel adventure game from Taiwanese studio Sigono Inc. I&#x27;d seen a few other games journalists raving about it when it came out on Steam last September, and hey, over 3000 overwhelmingly positive Steam reviews can&#x27;t be wrong either, so I took the plunge, and golly, it sure is something special.

The strike started on December 9th following surprise layoffs at the Call Of Duty: Warzone studio&#x27;s QA department, with some other teams and Actiblizz people supporting them.

No Scotty, mind, but we suppose they have to save something for the sequel. It’s this story mode we’ve been given early access to, so let’s jump in.

                    <span>Last year it was reported that long-time Sega director behind the Yakuza and Super Monkey Ball games Toshihiro Nagoshi was in talks to leave the company and form his own team under NetEase.

That’s for the RTX 3090 FE, which now sits at a widowmaking €1,649, while the rest of the range has gained between €20 and €60 in wallet weight.

He claimed that a third party was responsible for the sales but a local court found him guilty of copyright infringement offenses, also handing down a four-month suspended prison sentence.

It&#x27;s also, of course, an enormously popular trading card game, and its latest digital iteration, Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel, came to Steam this past week. It&#x27;s currently the fourth most popular game on the platform by concurrent players.

Hitman 3 frustrated players when it first launched on Epic, because their progress didn&#x27;t carry over; Hitman 1 frustrated players on GOG last year because its internet requirements constitute DRM; and now Hitman 3 is back at it again on Steam. It currently has &quot;Mixed&quot; reviews after arriving on the platform earlier this week, with players cross about its price, its umpteen editions, and - yes, again - progress not carrying over for some.

These moves come in the wake of several lawsuits alleging a culture of harassment and discrimination within the company. The post announcing the plans also comes days after Microsoft announced their intent to buy Activision Blizzard.

Activision Blizzard came in on Monday dragging a trail of lawsuits and scandal with allegations of widespread discrimination and harassment, on Tuesday were being bought by Microsoft for $69 billion (£50 billion), and now on Friday they&#x27;ve grown a union. 34 quality assurance testers at the Activision Blizzard studio Raven Software, who currently maintain Call Of Duty: Warzone, are forming a union named the Game Workers Alliance. They&#x27;re seeking better working conditions in the wake of Raven QA layoffs.

                    <span>I’ve always entertained the idea of an apocalypse. I mean, zombies are definitely scary, but it’d be a cool fantasy to play out. Over the years, I’ve even formed my own little plan. Loot some local houses and then set up a base in the fire station on my street. They’ve got electric gates and metal fences to guard the perimeter, a renewable power source thanks to a wind turbine on the roof, and a really handy watchtower. I thought 11 years of The Walking Dead would’ve prepared me fairly well and I fancied my chances. So, I made myself in Project Zomboid. It turns out, everything I learned from The Walking Dead was useless.

                    <span>Pupperazzi is a game about taking pictures of dogs. They are, as is traditional, very cute dogs. You go around several areas that increase in complexity and dog saturation, completing photo challenges and unlocking more and more complex areas. An extreme sports dog wants a picture of a dog riding a scooter. The old sea-dog at the beach would like a photo of any dog, as long as the lighthouse is in the background. In return for this you get golden bones as a form of currency to buy different kinds of film, or weird lenses, to kick your photography into the next gear.
It&#x27;s cute. It&#x27;s a really nice playground that facilitates the player&#x27;s own creativity. You can pet dogs to make them happy, or find toys to make them do different things: turn on a radio and any furry pals nearby bust out some truly astonishing moves; throw a stick to initiate a huge game of fetch. You post your photos to a kind of dog-centric Instagram for likes and comments (possibly from dogs; possibly from humans). The colourful, chunky art, combined with deliberately stiff animation where nobody can move their joints, really reminds me of Playmobil toys. Despite this carefree, playful tone, I also find it unaccountably sinister.

                    <span>If I ever achieve immortality, there might be time to sit down and work out exactly why some building games grab me and some don&#x27;t. I fear I am too often left with a page of notes that are just variations on the word &quot;vibes&quot;. 
Perhaps some taxonomy would help. Moons Of Ardan is a space colony building game that&#x27;s mostly about balancing production rates by placing buildings. Less dryly, you&#x27;re making a new home for mildly cute little space people on semi-cartoony worlds, where nothing ever really goes wrong and... the vibes. It&#x27;s the vibes, you see.

                    <span>Early access is a mixed bag. Sometimes it&#x27;s an exciting early glimpse, sometimes it feels like supporting a developer or game you care about, and sometimes it can feel more like paying to beta test. That last one won&#x27;t be a concern with Blood Bowl 3, not anymore. The latest adaptation of Games Workshop&#x27;s tabletop fantasy bloodsport was headed to early access but now, naw. The developers are focusing on closed beta testing instead, and will simply launch the game in full once it&#x27;s done.

                    <span>Of the many possibilities that Microsoft buying Activision Blizzard might enable, only one seems really clear: that Microsoft will put Actiblizz games on Game Pass. Beyond that, it&#x27;s all mights and maybes. Here&#x27;s another maybe: Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer says they&#x27;re hoping to dig into Actiblizz&#x27;s &quot;franchises that I love from my childhood,&quot; raising the likes of Hexen and King&#x27;s Quest. What better use for $69 billion than wallowing in nostalgia?

                    <span>V úterý Microsoft oznámil záměr koupit herní společnost Activision Blizzard za téměř 69 miliard dolarů. Activision Blizzard vlastní hry jako Warcraft, Diablo, Starcraft, Overwatch, Call of Duty a Candy Crash. Patrně se nedočkáme linuxových portů (ale můžeme se nechat překvapit). Mohlo by však dojít k většímu prodeji her přes Steam, který doposud prodává asi jen Call of Duty. Na Steamu je pak pohodlně možné použít Proton a hrát hry pro Windows v Linuxu.</span>

V některých případech jde o obrázek s rozlišením jen 1×1 pixel (spy pixel). Odesílatel se může dozvědět jestli jste email otevřeli, kdy a kolikrát, z jakého zařízení a jaká je jeho IP adresa.</span>

In addition to sanctions, the ISP also wants the option to inform the jury about the missing evidence, while testimony based on that information should be precluded from trial.

Part of the preparation is rolling out their compatibility review program, which will let you know which games on Steam work best with Valve&#x27;s handheld PC. The verification status of the first set of games can now be found via SteamDB, though not yet the Steam interface itself.

The answers are &quot;Siemens&quot; and &quot;after&quot;, respectively. These are things I have learned today while playing WikiTrivia, a free browser game by Tom Watson which pulls historical dates from WikiData and challenges you to put them in the correct order.

At the same time as Warner Bros. announced the release date however, Polygon published a lengthy report on extensive crunch suffered by employees working on the game at developers TT Games.

So sure, expanding the game with DLC, sure sure, tell me about making what&#x27;s already there better. Amplitude laid out some of their plans on that front, too.

We’re in the opening seconds of the round and only 20 minutes into my Midnight Ghost Hunt hands-on preview, which means I’ve yet to figure out important concepts like ‘where the hunters spawn in’, or nuances like ‘this button lets me hide in props’ as opposed to ‘this button telekinetically waggles props about like ectoplasmic dinner bells’. As ghosts we’re supposed to mostly stay schtum for the five minutes it takes to reach midnight, at which point we get to both metaphorically and literally flip the tables on the living. Instead: panic.

We open an estate agent to appraise the houses in games that would actually be good to live in. It turns out there aren&#x27;t that many. Not a lot of them would be convenient. 
There&#x27;s an excellent Cavern Of Lies this week, in which Nate hosts a game-themed episode of Through The Keyhole in character as Lloyd Grossman/a robot version of Matt Berry. We also have some great diversions and some opening chat about the time my friend was a real life suspect in a murder for a few days.

                    <span>Dunno if you’ve noticed, but there’s been a whole lot of news lately. Too much news in fact. Growing up, we barely had any news. There was just one bit of news that we’d all have to share. A man would drive around our village with the news in the back of his van, and we’d all come out of our houses to watch as he slid open the doors and pointed at it, saying “well, here is the news”. And it was the same news, every day. The news about the hole in the ozone layer. And it was all the news we needed.


Not For Broadcast puts you in charge of all of the news. Set in an alternate timeline 1980s Britain in which an authoritarian far-left party has swept to power on a wave of populist policies, it casts the player as the lens through which the nation will view its new government. Seated in front of a bank of glowing screens, sliders and controls, you have the enviable power to switch between four live camera feeds, bleep out naughty words (and later subversive opinion), choose which ads to run during the break, and select which images are highlighted on screen during each news story.

                    <span>Ah, to be good with plants. Apparently it was a thing, wasn&#x27;t it, that my generation all got into house plants, especially during lockdown. A friend of mine has a positively ebullient front room full of lush, green darlings that have names like Hercules. My brother-in-law, absent any real space, has mounted glass spheres of water on his wall and grows little flowers and trailing vines from them. I, on the other hand, am a plant killer. Apart from in Strange Horticulture, when I run a spooky and ethereal plant shop in a town called Undermere, in an alternate-universe version of The Lake District. There, my plants are happy and weird, and with them I can save the world.

                    <span>Strategy games set in space are almost innately ambitious. The very concept of doing anything meaningful in an infinite void, let alone making it playable and entertaining, is a challenging one, and for every game that reaches for the stars there are countless kinds of... spiraling chaos orbitals.
Between its design flaws and unique ideas with semi-brilliant execution, the 2010 4X/wargame/economic/management simulation Distant Worlds: Universe has straddled those two experiences for a decade. It&#x27;s needed a sequel for a long time. Distant Worlds 2 is that sequel, and it&#x27;s almost upon us. Last week I attended a live demo and Q&amp;A session with its producer and co-designer Erik Rutins. With only a hands-off demo to go on I obviously can&#x27;t say for sure how it plays yet, but it&#x27;s already looking very promising.

Bit Reactor is their name, and turn-based tactics really is their only type of game. They haven&#x27;t announced any specific game yet but say they have several titles in development.

                    <span>Dice are continuing their efforts to fix up Battlefield 2042, with today bringing a patch fixing issues including some wonky hit registration, some crashes, and a bit of rubberbanding. Looking ahead, they&#x27;ve also revealed the much-requested new scoreboard which will arrive in February. After a few months, maybe the game will get to the state it should have been in when it launch in November.

                    <span>We’re in a bit of a “love letter” media period right now. Some old things come back with new things to say, like The Matrix Resurrections, and some old things come back simply to enjoy themselves, and remind yesteryear fans what they loved about the original in the first place, like Scream. 


Windjammers 2 falls firmly into the latter category. After successfully resurrecting Streets Of Rage for another bout in 2020, developer Dotemu are up to the same old tricks, bringing Windjammers all the way back from 1994 (before I was even born) with a fresh coat of paint and some brand new ultimate frisbee-style action in this sequel.

                    <span>Microsoft swallowed up all of Tuesday&#x27;s attention with their plan to buy Activision Blizzard for $69 billion, drowning out even good news of their own. Along with surprise, concern, and bafflement, yesterday brought Game Pass news. Yes yes they do plan to add Actiblizz games to Game Pass while they can, but there&#x27;s more: 1) the service now has over 25 million subscribers across PC and Xbox; 2) cult classic Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc is now on Game Pass. You know, the one with the weird bear and the murdergames.

                    <span>Hello folks. I would say Happy New Year, but it&#x27;s already the 19th January and we&#x27;ve had two of the biggest news stories of the year in the space of a week, so I think that means it&#x27;s officially too late to keep banging the old New Year drum, isn&#x27;t it? The sentiment remains, of course, even if I do now feel a thousand years old in the process.
Rather than reaching for the annual reset button, though, today I wanted to talk about some of the new and exciting things that are coming up on RPS this year. For starters, our tech team&#x27;s just handed us a brand-new liveblogging feature, and we&#x27;d like you, our RPS supporters, to help us test it out tomorrow at 4pm GMT.

                    <span>Announced at last year’s The Game Awards, Have A Nice Death is a roguelike platformer developed by Magic Design Studios where you play as Death, CEO of the underworld. Your employees have gone berserk and thrown your vacation plans into disarray, so must wield your trusty scythe and travel into the depths of your company to hack them all back to their stations. It looks good! And it’s coming to Steam early access in March.

                    <span>If you&#x27;re after a way to make your magic system seem cutesy yet different at the same time, music is a good one to go for. Sure, it&#x27;s been done before, but it feels inherently charming. At least, it does in the trailer for newly-revealed Songs Of Glimmerwick, a new game from Eastshade Studios that promises to blend RPG, adventure, and gardening.
No specific release date is confirmed, aside from &quot;next year&quot;. I have to give them credit for the name Songs Of Glimmerwick, which immediately lets you know that this will be about music and magic, and probably have an amount of tweeness. Specific tweeness levels unconfirmed but they&#x27;re looking good from the trailer, where you can also clap eyes on some pretty cool-looking gardening, a tree telling you to stfu, and a man earnestly giving you a wooden flute as you head off to magic university.

                    <span>Sometimes you have no choice but to admire hard graft, even if it&#x27;s illegal graft. In this case, it&#x27;s a Russian bootleg copy of The Simpsons Hit &amp; Run which we&#x27;re admiring, mainly because the bootlegger has dubbed every character in every cutscene. The result is magnificent and just really funny, to be honest.

I don&#x27;t know if anyone has been brave enough to come out and say this, but Microsoft buying Activision Blizzard is... problematic. Even before you consider the serious and unresolved allegations of workplace misconduct at ActiBlizz, there&#x27;s no easy &quot;this is good, actually&quot; point of view to have here.

                    <span>Of all the uncertainty, rumour, speculation, claims, hopes, and business fanfic surrounding Microsoft&#x27;s $69 billion purchase of Activision Blizzard, here&#x27;s my favourite bit. The Wall Street Journal claim someone told them that Actiblizz CEO Bobby Kotick wanted to &#x27;change the narrative&#x27; around the company following many allegations of discrimination and harassment, and he thought that one way to do that was buying some of the video games media, such as Kotaku or cheery RPS fanzine PC Gamer. Oh that would change the narrative alright!

                    <span>The first time I wrote about Total War: Warhammer, Ed Milliband had just lost a general election because of a sandwich. There’s a joke there about him stepping down but the Chaos having remained, but I can’t figure it out. Anyway, what I’m trying to say is this: it’s been almost seven years since then. SEVEN! And I’m still head over heels in love with these games even now. Somehow, impossibly, that seems to be holding true for Warhammer 3 as well.
In a recent hands-on event, I was able to play something like eight hours worth of this final game in the trilogy from the comfort of my own spare room. Having not done a “digital preview” before now, this was something of a revelation to me. Wearing my comfortable clothes and with a steady supply of big mugs of tea, I booted up the game, hit ‘New Campaign’ and was greeted with the following screen.

                    <span>Microsoft yesterday announced plans to buy Activision Blizzard for $69 billion (£50 billion), a staggering and un-nice quantity of money for the video games company behind Call Of Duty and Warcraft. They&#x27;re buying the company at a troubled time, with multiple lawsuits alleging widespread sexual discrimination and harassment, an ongoing strike over QA layoffs, and employees publicly calling for the removal of the CEO, Bobby Kotick. A campaign group of employees known as the ABK Workers Alliance say the acquisition doesn&#x27;t change their goals and there&#x27;s still work to do.

                    <span>It turns out Rainbow Six Extraction is more cerebral and stealthy than the co-op shooters I’m used to; the other day I accompanied Hayden and Ed on a few missions for the latter’s review, and spent most of them either accidentally summoning hordes of parasite monsters or being hauled to medevac while encased in protective foam. Between my cocoon-muffled cries for help, however, I did manage to get a good look into how Extraction runs on PC, as well as the best settings to tweak if you want better performance.

                    <span>Rainbow Six Extraction is a spin-off from Rainbow Six Siege&#x27;s popular Outbreak mode, which saw Tom Clancy&#x27;s operators fending off aliens instead of each other. Well, Extraction is a tactical FPS that builds on what made Outbreak great by repurposing Siege&#x27;s PvP prowess into a moreish Left 4 Dead-like. Unpicking an alien hivemind with your mates is a real thrill, as is simply coming back from a mission alive. While it doesn&#x27;t do anything to blow you away, it does more than enough to keep you coming back for a quick alien-busting session here and there.

                    <span>I used to think that big, intricate character customisation systems were pretty much mandatory for decent CRPGs. As I saw it, the ability to conjure up a hideous goblin man with a chin curving back up into his face, if you wanted to, was a sign that you were playing something in the big leagues. Now, however, I am not so sure.  

Expeditions: Rome, a historical CRPG blending turn-based combat, strategic army management, and lots of dialogue, has a pretty rubbish character creation system. There’s bugger all you can really do to customise your Roman. and after the mammoth character forge of Pathfinder: Wrath Of The Righteous, for example, it all just feels very sparse and shoestringy. And that is a damned shame, because when it gets down to business, this is a seriously good - and lovingly detailed - romp through centurion times.

                    <span>In the wake of scandal and lawsuits alleging a culture of discrimination and harrassment at Activision Blizzard, Microsoft today announced they&#x27;re buying the company. Wait, hang on. What. That&#x27;s not what I expected when Xbox head Phil Spencer told staff he was &quot;evaluating all aspects of [Xbox&#x27;s] relationship&quot; with Activision Blizzard. Microsoft plan to pay $68.7 billion (£50 billion) for the company, which will nab them games including Warcraft, Call Of Duty, and Overwatch. Jesus.

                    <span>To perform an ollie is to commune with gods. Or maybe just look cool. OlliOlli World is shaping up to be a good-spirited renovation of the 2D skateboarding series that has traditionally been quite punishing. This one&#x27;s got a flashy third dimension, moon-faced cartoon characters, and a plucky story to match. We&#x27;re told of Skate Godz who once appointed a human representative on earth. But she&#x27;s about to retire and needs a prodigy to step forward to fill her Vans. The player is that potential new conduit between holy half-pipers and humanity. In other words, this is a quest to become Skate Pope. Caliph of kickflips. Dalai Slama. Having both popped and shoved-it through a heap of levels in preview, I&#x27;m happy to report you can all sit down. I&#x27;m the chosen one. It&#x27;s me.

Dragon Knight, Mirana, and their friends return to fight Terrorblade, having committed the classic Dota mistake of letting a late-game carry farm uninterrupted until they&#x27;re stacked.

                    <span>A group of Foxhole players are going on strike to pressure the developers into address issues they feel ruin their chosen role in the war, logistics. The World War 2 sandbox MMO is a persistent battle where weapons, vehicle, and building rely on resources gathered, processed, and delivered by other players, without whom the war machine slows down. Our boy Brendy called logistics &quot;the real heroes&quot; when he rode with them a few years back. But many are unhappy with the current state of their role, so they&#x27;ve formed a union.

                    <span>Something is missing from Nobody Saves The World, a new action RPG from Guacamelee devs DrinkBox Studios. This is a dungeon-crawler that lets you shapeshift into horses, bodybuilders, and ghosts in your bid to save the world, but it&#x27;s a quest blighted not only by a Calamity, but by repetition too. Charming characters and clever mighty-morphin&#x27; combat succumb to numbers, which reduces what could&#x27;ve been a rich world to a rather hollow dash between dungeons.

                    <span>Can I get a ‘woop woop’, or at least a ‘wololo’, for the spin-off strategy game? The Ensemble Studios swansong that was Halo Wars, an RTS so streamlined it was aerodynamic. The ballistic ballet of Gears Tactics, which piled extra biceps atop XCOM’s shoulders. Even when money has moved through the membrane in the opposite direction, it has resulted in projects that were - let’s not overstate this - endearingly experimental. Can I get an understanding nod for Command &amp; Conquer: Renegade?
The strangeness of Crossfire: Legion’s situation is that you might not recognise it as a spin-off at all. That’s because the series is a big old blind spot for the Western world. Crossfire is an enormously successful Korean FPS that bears more than a passing resemblance to Counter-Strike - all right angles, assault weapons, and de_dust2 - but dwarfs even Steam’s most popular game for player numbers. With 690 million participants across 80 countries, it’s the biggest online FPS in the world. In China, where the game is a major cultural force, a coming-of-age television drama about two young Crossfire players has been watched 1.8 billion times. Bridger-what? Geralt of Where? The upshot of all that success is that Crossfire radiates money, and some of it is now funding new games from prestigious Western developers. Remedy is working on a campaign FPS in the classic COD style. And Blackbird Interactive is building an RTS named Legion.

                    <span>When I first heard about Wordle, I assumed it was an app, and went looking for it on various app stores. I didn&#x27;t find it - Wordle is instead a website, and completely free.

It turns out I&#x27;m not alone. App developer Steven Cravotta explained on Twitter that a completely unrelated game he released five years ago, also called Wordle, has had a major increase in downloads over the past few weeks. And now he&#x27;s donating the money he&#x27;s made to charity.

There&#x27;s a little combat, but not mu-- Oh, wow. Waitaminute. There&#x27;s a moment in this trailer where it suddenly looks like one of those adverts for fake mobile games. The hordes. Seemingly thousands of enemies on screen, and the physics to simulate them being hurled about.

You can watch said trailer below, released alongside the news that the game has slipped into next month.

Or is this the one where we&#x27;ve had a while to realise that the promise of hope in the new year is, once again, a terrible lie? Perhaps. Either way, I refuse to submit. Enjoy the heck out of this Monday. Have your favourite thing for dinner. Watch your favourite movie. Have a bath and put on a cool playlist of songs and sing really loud to annoy your neighbour.
Alternatively, play some cool video games! Here are the ones that make me smile when I&#x27;m feeling blue.

It’s essentially an AI-fuelled upgrade to Nvidia’s DSR downsampling tool, aiming to more intelligently render the frames of your games so that they appear more detailed – without the same performance loss that comes with standard DSR. It’s an intriguing new feature that could make some of the best graphics cards even better, and I’ve been trying it out to see if it performs as effectively as Nvidia claims.

On one hand, thank god it was only £119,000 because if it was the millions that some ugly Twitter avatars have sold for, every other mercenary games company would ramp up their own NFT initiatives.

                    <span>The speedrunning fundraiser festival Awesome Games Done Quick ended in the wee hours on Sunday, with one of its most spectacular runs coming in the final stretch. A speedrunner beat Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice in just over two hours, which frankly is impressive enough to me. More than that, the runner known as &quot;Mitchriz&quot; was blindfolded from start to finish, guided by a combination of memory and feeling-out environments. In two hours! Ludicrious.

                    <span>I enjoy the sub-genre of meme about Sad Murder Dads as much as the next gal. Heck, I enjoy those lads themselves. From Kratos in God Of War, to Joel in The Last Of Us, and even less story-focused murder dads like Soldier 76, dudes rock. Successfully rehabilitated and reimagined as father figures struggling to inhabit that role and accept their emotions, in some very good games to boot. Developers who were hot young guns in the 00s are now tired middle-aged dads themselves, and as a result the art they consume and, more to the point, the art they want to make looks radically different. I&#x27;m not having a go at that; that&#x27;s just life, is what that is.
But what I&#x27;m asking is, what&#x27;s the mum equivalent? Because I really want to see someone give a mum story the same big budget, fun epic treatment that Kratos got in God Of War. At the same time, I also dread this coming to pass.

                    <span>Friday&#x27;s long-awaited PC launch of God Of War was mostly received by people nodding their heads and muttering &quot;Boy&quot;—the highest praise a heavy heart can offer. A few would-be players, however, found themselves unable to play, with the game throwing up &quot;out of memory&quot; error messages when they really shouldn&#x27;t be out of memory. The devs have been looking into the issue, and released a potential fix on an opt-in experimental branch on Steam. It sounds like it fixes the problem for some people, but not all.

                    <span>Správa specializovaných zásad webového aplikačního firewallu (WAF), které zajišťují trvale robustní zabezpečení aplikací, je práce na plný úvazek. Organizace, které si nemohou dovolit plně spravované podnikové řešení nebo zaměstnávat potřebné zdroje, mají problém udržet si přehled o nejnovějších útocích a ochranných opatřeních potřebných k zajištění konzistentního zabezpečení a shody s předpisy. Podle Johna Breedena II, Barracuda CSO Online, Barracuda WAF as-a-Service rozhodně není jen obyčejný firewall. Toto cloudové zabezpečení aplikací ochrání firemní data, její reputaci a pomáhá zajistit shodu s předpisy.</span>
