The statement was released in response to rumours that 343 would instead take a backseat on future Halo games by serving to manage external studios, rather than developing the games themselves as they had on Halo Infinite.

                              <span>The original Granblue Fantasy was a JRPG mobile game only released in Japan, but that didn&#x27;t stop enterprising westerners going to the effort to play it. That&#x27;s mainly because it counted Final Fantasy composer Nobuo Uematsu and art director Hideo Minaba among its developers.

Granblue Fantasy: Relink is set in the same universe and has the same Final Fantasy vets involved, but it&#x27;s a big, splashly 1-4 player action RPG blockbuster, with combat reminiscent of some Platinum Games. You&#x27;ll find the latest trailer below.

                              <span>Crystal Dynamics are ending support for Marvel&#x27;s Avengers, their live service superhero game. That means it won&#x27;t receive any further new content, its final balance patch will be released on March 31st, and all other support and the sale of the game will cease on September 30th. Players who already own the game at that point will be able to continue playing in single- and multiplayer, for at least a while.

The boiler is gone in my house, so I&#x27;m wearing one of those giant hoodie things that comes down to my knees, and scuttle about the place secreting foodstuffs in the pouch. Wait, that&#x27;s more like a kangaroo, isn&#x27;t it. Curses! Regardless, I will only be able to warm my hands this weekend by cupping them over the light of my PC screen. What will I, and others, be playing on them this weekend?

                              <span>Our pick of impeccable pixels.
Of all the art styles in video games, none has a stronger chokehold on developers and players alike than the humble pixel. Whether it&#x27;s a fantastically detailed modern take on what is possible in pixels, or something made in homage to NES and SNES games of yore, pixel art can be found everywhere — in every genre of game, on every console (no matter how powerful), and in every generation of games, too.
Some may dismiss pixel art as an old-fashioned art style , but the games in this list show that pixel art can be up there with some of the most beautiful games on Switch. Just because something adheres to an evident grid doesn&#x27;t mean it can&#x27;t be utterly gorgeous — so let&#x27;s celebrate the best pixel art in games!

It was Fire Emblem Engage launch day and Nintendo Life had boots on the ground in New York City to document the launch of Intelligent Systems’ latest entry in the series, at Nintendo NYC in Rockefeller Center.
Nintendo fans in New York City are spoiled. We have Nintendo’s flagship retail shop, replete with Marios riding flagpoles between the first and second floors, Bowser glowing menacingly at selfie-takers on the ground floor, and vintage hardware displays of Nintendo consoles through the ages. Additionally, it’s a hotbed of guest appearances ranging from the likes of Charles Martinet (the voice of Mario) to Monster Hunter’s Ryozo Tsujimoto.

                              <span>That&#x27;s one way to send off Nintendo&#x27;s masterpiece.
You might have thought about playing through The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild one last time before the arrival of Tears of the Kingdom, but how about another 50 times instead? That&#x27;s what a speedrunner known as &#x27;Player 5&#x27; recently did, and to top it off - it was achieved in under 24 hours. In fact, you can watch the whole stream on replay via Twitch.
As highlighted by GamesRadar+, the quickest run was 24 minutes and 16 seconds. This was done with the help of a variety of skills and tricks, and on average each run was about 25 minutes. Upon completion, Player 5 smiled and that was that - arguably the greatest speedrun since the launch of the action-adventure game in 2017. Player 5 is also known for previously setting a &#x27;world record&#x27; BOTW speedrun - completing the game in 25 minutes and 23 seconds.

When it comes to ways that The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild flipped the script for the wider series, there is a list of &#x27;em so long that it almost rivals the number of those darn Korok Seeds out there. *shakes fist to the sky* One of the changes that we almost can&#x27;t believe actually happened, however, was the sheer number of weapons at your disposal and how, importantly, they had a nasty habit of breaking.
This wasn&#x27;t you&#x27;re daddy&#x27;s Zelda game. You&#x27;re not picking up a sword from your uncle, a mysterious man in a cave, or a hidden chest surrounded by a maze of boulders. Instead, your first steps into the Great Plateau and beyond probably saw you armed with a couple of branches and an old wooden lid as a makeshift shield. Chances are that after a couple of swings at some nearby Bokoblins, those sticks broke and you were left pushing that stamina wheel to its limits in a crazed game of cat and mouse not a million miles away from Hyrule&#x27;s take on The Benny Hill Show (or Scooby-Doo, if you&#x27;d prefer).

January has felt like a long one, we&#x27;ll admit, but we are almost at the end of it now and we have Nintendo&#x27;s first big release of 2023 to show for it! After all the character profiles, gameplay trailers and developer interviews, Fire Emblem Engage is finally here in all of its tactical glory.
In recognition of the gaming year starting to get underway, we asked you lovely lot to rank the Fire Emblem games that are available in the west. We also hopped on the ol&#x27; soapbox once again, this time chatting about our desire for a Paper Mario-style Zelda game and pleading for a Baten Kaitos remake (spurred on by some recent rumours). It&#x27;s also been a big week for reviews as we gave our thoughts on Fire Emblem Engage, Persona 3 Portable and Persona 4 Golden amongst others.

Now, to celebrate the release this week, many of the western voice actors have been sharing thank you messages on social media to both Nintendo and fans of the series. Here&#x27;s a round-up of some of the ones so far:

Heroes get a lot of love. The main character of a game is, by their very nature, the star of the show. But a great villain is often even more compelling than a great hero - everyone wants to save the world, but it takes a special soul to want to destroy it.
It&#x27;s almost impossible to whittle a list of iconic video game villains down to just ten. It would be easy to simply point to the villains from games that sold really well, but that&#x27;s not really what it means to be iconic. So I tried my hardest to compile a list of ten video game villains who are real icons; the ones who stand tall in the world of gaming, whose silhouettes are enough to send shivers down your spine.

Once again, retro-lovin&#x27; publisher Hamster is reaching into the past of legendary studio Namco for another addition to its massive Arcade Archive range — This week sees the arrival of one of the developer&#x27;s lesser-known &#x27;90s hits, Tank Force, now available to download on PS4 and Nintendo Switch.
Released to the arcade market in 1991, Tank Force is the third release in Namco&#x27;s unofficial &quot;Tank Battalion&quot; trilogy — preceded by Tank Battalion (1980) and Battle City (1985). This multi-directional shooter sees up to four players battle it out in top-down, caterpillar-rolling action. A total of seven different tanks are available, all featuring their own respective traits and weapons, and a massive arsenal of 15 weapons and power-ups can be picked up to turn the tide of battle in your favor.

Featuring maze-like maps, destructible environments, land hazards, and winner-takes-all gameplay, Tank Force can be seen as something of an alternate to multiplayer hits such as Irem&#x27;s cutesy hit Bomberman, though it obviously lacks the charm and charisma of the Hudson Soft series. Tank Force would not be ported to the home market of the 1990s, though it would make a reappearance as part of a number of Namco classic compendiums. Today, Tank Force&#x27;s dynamic, score-attack-based gameplay has helped attract a niche but devoted community, still chasing those &#x27;90s high-score dreams.
Tank Force is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.

This weekend is the annual Granblue Fantasy Fes event in Japan, and as usual, we’re getting some big announcements from the world of Granblue. Specifically, Granblue Fantasy: Versus is getting an expansion that’s launching worldwide this year. Granblue Fantasy: Versus Rising will feature new stages, new characters, and a new story for players to experience. As you can see in the Versus Rising trailer below, it’s confirmed the game will have rollback net code and crossplay between PS4/PS5 and PC via Steam.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;4Ln58g217C4
Skimming through the game&#x27;s website, it&#x27;s confirmed that all 24 characters from the original game will return for this semi-sequel. Additionally, anybody who missed out on Versus will be able to experience an abridged version of that game&#x27;s celebrated story mode. If you play a lot of Versus online, know that the online lobby will be completely revamped for Versus Rising and will include the all-new &quot;Grand Bruise Legends&quot; mini-game mode.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;MOVAZg3QJF0
I guess calling it &quot;Granblue Fall Guys&quot; would have been a little too on the nose. Either way, all of that looks great, and it&#x27;s nice to know that Street Fighter 6 will have some competition this year. Expect Cygames and Arc System Works to reveal more details and new features as we get closer to its launch date. Granblue Fantasy: Versus Rising will release worldwide this year for PS4, PS5, and PC via Steam. And if you&#x27;re still playing the original Versus, know that the final update for that game will release on January 24.

If you’re like me, the question on your mind is, “What are we doing here?” Not in an existentialist sense, but rather, why is this not Persona 3 FES? Why the PSP version? Unlike the philosophical question of our purpose, there probably is a good answer for why we’re getting Persona 3 Portable instead of one of its console kin, but we don’t really know it. There have been theories about the Persona 3 FES code being a mess or having been lost, but that’s exactly what I hear every time there’s a poor or missing port. Then there’s the rumor that Persona 3 is being remade, which I also doubt, but maybe.
In any case, here we are: Persona 3 Portable on console and PC.
The worst part about the whole experience is that I’m constantly wondering what I’m doing on this version and whether or…</span>

Good morning, friends, and welcome to a particularly chilly edition of Whatcha Been Playing. I don&#x27;t know how things are looking in your neck of the woods. But here in Blightly it&#x27;s damn cold. I know it&#x27;s January and everything, but even by winter standards the chill factor is through the rough... or is that through the floor? Either way, I&#x27;m walking around my house wrapped in a blanket, only turning the heating on as A Special Treat in the evening. Fuck the Tories.
Still, I&#x27;m happy to see you here, you can heat up my cold, cold heart simply by being a part of our weekly gathering. I hope that the week has been good to you, and that this weekend will give you the chance to grab a hold of some time for yourself. So whether you have the entire weekend free, or just the evenings…</span>

                              <span>Inflation affects yet another title
Factorio is one of those games that came out a good while ago, but I hear about it everywhere now, as it&#x27;s continued to gain steam and further garner a player base as the years have gone on. The base-building strategy game originally came out on Steam in 2016, and its continued success just speaks to some solid game design, if you ask me. Now, seven years later, developers Wube Software have announced that Factorio will be receiving a price increase from $30 to $35 on Steam, and have cited inflation as the explanation for the change.
https://twitter.com/factoriogame/status/1616388275169628162
The game originally cost $20 when it was in early access on Steam in 2016, and the price increased to $30 with the release of version 1.0 in 2020. This change goes into effect on January 26, 2023, as per the tweet from Wube. The developers also added a comment to their Steam page that reads, &quot;We don&#x27;t have any plans to take part in a sale or to reduce the price for the foreseeable future&quot; -- and this message is in place before the price increase hits.
Wube&#x27;s announcement comes in the wake of tons of other inflation-driven price hikes, whether they&#x27;re for other games, consoles, or streaming services. This is the first I&#x27;ve yet to see of a well-known indie game increasing their price (we&#x27;ve seen this in the AAA space for a while now with the new $70 standard), but I have a feeling it&#x27;s a trend that&#x27;s gonna catch on.

                              <span>Avast, ye! An update is here!
It always makes me happy to see Sea of Thieves in the news — it&#x27;s one of those games that I think has a great premise and always delivers on the fun, and it&#x27;s managed to live on despite threats of a shutdown in 2022. The game is not only alive now, but thriving — evidenced yet again by announced a new update for 2023 that Rare announced this week. This release will focus on matchmaking improvements, as well as the addition of Pet Rocks and a brand new live event called The Secret Wilds. It&#x27;s always been exciting to be a pirate, but now, even more so.
The Secret Wilds event will take over right where the previous PvE event The Rogue&#x27;s Legacy left off, which explored the backstory of an undead pirate named Captain Briggsy. The event will run from January 18-February 2, so players will have a few weeks to delve further into the mystery.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;XresgzEZaT0
Sea of Thieves is also getting a whole host of new cosmetics, including the &quot;Labyrinth Looter&quot; set of outfits, guns, and ship accessories themed around the Greek myth of Theseus and the Minotaur. There&#x27;s also a new emote that has players playing with their very own Pet Rock — I guess if you can&#x27;t have a parrot, a rock is the next best thing.
Arguably the most exciting changes, however, come in the form of improvements to the game&#x27;s PvP mode, especially when it comes to its matchmaking systems. In an attempt to make queue times shorter, Rare is introducing a system that will pair players with an opponent from the same faction if load times are too long to make sure that players will always be able to get into a game. In addition, Rare is also increasing the number of PvP arenas from six to 50, and the losing crew in a battle will receive more compensation as an effort to make losses less bothersome.

The Avengers team bringing its support of Marvel&#x27;s Avengers to a close. The company confirms today that no new content or features will arrive after its March update, and all official support for Marvel&#x27;s Avengers will end on September 30, 2023.
In a post on the official Marvel&#x27;s Avengers site, the development team confirms that Update 2.8 on March 31, 2023 will mark the end of content and features rolling out. Update 2.7, which recently added the Winter Soldier and the Cloning Lab Omega-Level Threat, is also confirmed as the final new content for Marvel&#x27;s Avengers.

                              <span>The League of Legends developer is among the tech layoffs this week
Riot Games, the company behind games like League of Legends and Valorant, has laid off 46 employees. These cuts arrive in a week full of layoffs at companies across the video game and tech industry.
According to a report from journalist Jacob Wolf, the layoffs are largely focused on talent acquisition, recruiting departments, and its publishing arm, though the esports and support units were also affected. The 46 layoffs account for less than one percent of Riot, which currently sits at over 4,500 worldwide employees.
In a statement to Wolf, Riot Games says it &quot;implemented strategic shifts within a few teams to sharpen [its] focus in a number of areas.&quot;
&quot;With these shifts, certain roles were eliminated, impacting a total of 46 Rioters,&quot; said a Riot spokesperson in a statement to Wolf. &quot;This is part of our normal course of our business: We periodically make changes to our structure and our teams based on what we believe will allow us to deliver the best content and experiences for players. We never make these decisions lightly and will always start from a place of wanting to retain Rioters and have them focus on our highest priorities. While that’s not always possible, it’s our primary goal.&quot;
Riot Games will continue to hire, with a number of available positions posted on its website.
Ongoing industry layoffs
These cuts arrive amidst a week full of industry layoffs, at many video game and tech companies. Microsoft recently confirmed it will be laying off 10,000 workers, with reports including cuts at Xbox studios like 343 Industries. Amazon has also initiated a round of job cuts that look to include around 18,000 people, and Google parent company Alphabet is cutting 12,000 jobs.
Vox Media is also laying off a chunk of its workforce, and Fandom has cut a number of roles as well, including those at fellow media outlets GameSpot and Giant Bomb.

                              <span>With all the Sad Dad™ games that have cropped up in recent years, many have rightfully been asking: &quot;Where are all the video game mums at?&quot;. Well, what if I told you that Swedish indie studio Might and Delight have been putting mums at the centre of their games since 2013? Yup, elephant mums in Shelter 3, Lynx mums in Shelter 2, and the OG badass badger mum in Shelter 1. Sure it’s kinda terrible that the only major rep mums are getting in video games is in the form of Might and Delight’s animal tales, but I’ll honestly take any story about motherhood I can get my paws on.
As much as I love Shelter 2 (less so Shelter 3, unfortunately), Shelter 1 holds a special place in my heart, mostly because no other animal-focused survival game has come even remotely close to claiming the coveted title of &quot;most brutal animal sim that made me ugly cry.&quot;

Both are free, although there’s not a suitably intimidating cult-related name for the latter yet. Relics Of The Old Faith was shown off a bit at the end of 2022, but this is the first we’re hearing of another arriving later in this sparkly new year.

You steer your wee boat around a grounded anime age-of-sail Earth, looking for shipwrecks and treasures, fighting pirates (and possibly being one, although fairly peripherally),exploring, trading, and doing the usual Elite-style open world thing. I&#x27;ll be honest: I don&#x27;t exactly love this one, and it&#x27;s spread a little thin. But I&#x27;ve played it for hours longer than I expected and enjoyed it more as it went on. It&#x27;s doing a lot, in its own slightly roundabout way.

I’ve spent this afternoon ambling around the redone GTA III, GTA: Vice City and GTA: San Andreas, in handheld form, to confirm what you probably already know: they’re all still a bit crap.

                              <span>I’m a big fan of frogs in games. If I see a cute little green lad in a game, then I’m absolutely going to play it. This is how I started playing the free prologue demo for Die In The Dungeon, a turn-based roguelike where you place dice on a grid to slice and , er, dice your foes. It’s smart, concise, and I can’t stop playing.
Playing as your little green knight, you are given five dice each round to place on a game board. Each one represents a certain action, the basic ones being attacking and defending, but ramping up to mass healing and boosting the stats of other dice. Energy points dictate how many dice you can place on the board, with each one costing the number on its face. Placement is key, as different combinations can lead to better outcomes like, for example, how you can place an attack die in a space affected by a booster die to up its damage.

                              <span>Grand Theft Auto Online’s been around for the best part of a decade, but you can now become a taxi driver at long last. You’ll probably need to do some light robbery to afford to buy a taxi from Warstock Cache &amp; Carry for the most authentic cab driver experience. Still, it’s relatively straightforward to start your latest, and uncharacteristically honest, money making venture. If you don’t have a taxi then you can still start taxi work jobs, and completing 10 in a row unlocks the cheaper trade price to nab a legit taxi. You can even call a cab from your iFruit phone to fast travel, if you don’t fancy driving your own.

                              <span>This past weekend, I ended an 18-month-long love affair. I managed to drag the experience out for all it was worth, but in the end, there was nothing to do but let go, and complete the fifth and final game in the Ace Attorney Turnabout Collection. And, oh, my heart, the post-game blues are real!
I was extremely late to the party when it comes to Capcom&#x27;s long-running series of legal dramedy visual novels, which debuted all the way back in 2001. But I found my way here in the end, largely thanks to the aforementioned collection, which packages prettied-up versions of the original Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy and its prequel duology The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles onto modern systems.

                              <span>Devs seem to think that Epic Games&#x27; whirlwind of pop cultural cross-pollination Fortnite is the game best positioned to deliver the vision of the metaverse to us, the Game Developers Conference have revealed. The results of the GDC’s 11th annual State Of The Industry survey were released this week. The survey checked in with more than 2,300 developers to pick their brains on contentious issues facing gaming, ranging from unionisation and harassment to, erm, blockchain.

                              <span>An adorable family of furry mammals traversing a dystopian urban environment; snapshots of joy and intimacy (playful hunts, mutual grooming, snuggling together for a nap) already infused with the melancholy of impending catastrophe; the terrible, life-altering moment when a young cub loses its footing and plunges into unknown depths, separated from the pack. Our fledgling protagonist, alone for the first time, has to fend for itself and find its way among the perilous mega-city ruins.  


If you engaged at all with the indie-game sphere in 2022, chances are this introduction rings a bell. Only it’s not a description of last year’s breakaway hit and multi-award winner, BlueTwelve Studio’s Stray, but an older and much more brutal feline saga, Videocult’s grim survival action game Rain World. The thematic overlap of these games, coupled with their contrasting design philosophies, provides an excellent springboard to reassess the latter – one of the most opaque, challenging, and underappreciated titles in recent memory, just in time for the arrival of its first official DLC, Rain World: Downpour.

                              <span>Deadpool will break the fourth wall and probably your face on January 26th, when the wise-cracking, chimichanga-loving mercenary arrives as DLC for Marvel’s Midnight Suns. Judging from the new trailer showing him in action that Firaxis have released, they seem to have struck a fine balance between comic book Deadpool and his movie counterpart. You can see Midnight Suns’ take on Wade Wilson in the trailer below.

GTA Trilogy was originally released as a Rockstar Store exclusive, and packages together GTA III (the first 3D one), GTA: Vice City (the best one), and GTA: San Andreas (the one with CJ in it). The collection’s arrival on Steam replaces the original versions of each game on the storefront, and coincides with a publisher sale that ends February 2nd.

It&#x27;s instead a co-op action roguelike, which takes the spaceship exploration and wave defense of Of The and makes it real-time, frantic, explosive.

It now has a release date, too: May 18th.

Do you know what the best Mario game on the Game Boy is? No, it’s not Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins. No, it’s not Dr. Mario. Alleyway? No. What? Now you’re just making things up. Listen, shush. Stop making me regret asking you to play this guessing game. The answer is Donkey Kong.
At this point, Donkey Kong might be the Game Boy’s worst-kept secret. At the time of its release in 1994, I didn’t hear much about it. The fact that it’s just called Donkey Kong makes it sound like a port of the original arcade title, and it seems willing to keep that illusion going. There was also a push to make it the poster child of the Super Game Boy, which seemed to further muddy the waters. But if you took a chance on it, you’d find that it’s not only a terrific game in its own rig…</span>

                              <span>It was HBO&#x27;s second-biggest premiere in 13 years
Let&#x27;s be honest — we all knew HBO&#x27;s The Last of Us adaptation was going to be popular, it was just a matter of quite how popular it would turn out to be. As expected, it was a massive success, and a tweet from HBO Max confirmed it: the show surpassed 10 million viewers within two days of its premiere, and that only accounts for the viewers in the United States, according to HBO. Those numbers are broken down into 4.7 million streams on premiere night last Sunday, January 15, which means an additional 5.3 viewers tuned in the following day. I&#x27;d bet a good percentage of those people saw the hype online and wanted to see what all the fuss was about, because the series has lit up social media like the Fourth of July this week.
https://twitter.com/Variety/status/1615795010540302338
With numbers like that, The Last of Us has secured a spot as the second-most watched premiere of a show on HBO since 2010, second only to House of the Dragon with 9.98 million viewers. While The Last of Us had the benefit of a pre-built fanbase of gamers to flock to the streaming platform on opening night, House of the Dragon had the advantage of being a spin-off of another one of HBO&#x27;s most successful series of all time: Game of Thrones.
HBO has also stated that numbers tend to grow significantly in the weeks after a show has premiered, with only 20-40% of its total numbers coming from Sunday night viewership. This means The Last of Us can be expected to be seeing even bigger numbers as time goes on, and as a fan of the series myself, I can imagine it&#x27;s only a matter of time before even the most hardened skeptics cave to the curiosity — especially when it comes to seeing the adaptations of the show&#x27;s most iconic scenes that are still ahead.

                              <span>Survive through space horror, again
If you wanted a reason to play back through a late 2022 game again this weekend, The Callisto Protocol just got one. Striking Distance Studios released a new update for The Callisto Protocol last night that includes New Game+.
After updating to the most recent patch, players who have beaten the game should have access to the New Game+ mode. You&#x27;ll need an active save file from finishing the game, and you might need to restart The Callisto Protocol to see it. With New Game+, you can carry over all your weapons, upgrades, and Callisto Credits from your previous run.

Alongside the new mode, there&#x27;s also a number of updates to the game itself. General performance optimizations have been made across all platforms, and multiple issues where camera angles or paths could cause the player to fall through the ground have been fixed.
Players should also no longer take damage when vaulting over obstacles, making the environment a little less of an enemy. Other crash areas for specific platforms have been addressed, too. You can find the full patch notes on The Callisto Protocol subreddit here.
And now you&#x27;re back, from outer space
The debut survival horror game from Striking Distance Studios has been gradually patching up its game since launch. The Callisto Protocol had some notable launch issues, some of which we experienced ourselves during our review process.
It&#x27;s been nice to at least see some of the technical issues get addressed alongside new options like New Game+ rolling out. If you&#x27;re someone who&#x27;s wanted to do a second run through the space-jail horror experience, this seems like a good reason to do so.
Striking Distance was also the subject of a recent report, where several former developers alleged their names were left off the credits for the game.

                              <span>Physical edition fans, rejoice!
In a time when digital media can disappear out of thin air with nothing but the blink of an eye from a jaded executive, I think it&#x27;s more than fair that some fans prefer to own physical copies of their favorite media, including games. Fans of The Witcher 3 who want to have the game available in physical form for their PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X are in luck, because CD Projekt Red is releasing The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - Complete Edition in the European and North American regions next week on January 26.
https://twitter.com/witchergame/status/1616406686734110723
The Complete Edition will of course include the base game, as well as the game&#x27;s previously released DLCs, Blood and Wine and Heart of Stone. This edition will also come along with the the recent next-gen update that the game received in December, which mainly focused on quality-of-life changes, as well as extras like a new quest, a photo mode, cross-platform progression, new outfits inspired by The Witcher&#x27;s Netflix series, and more.
What&#x27;s more, we also got news that CD Projekt Red is also working on some improvements to the next-gen PC version of the game, which is in desperate need of a patch when it comes to performance issues. These problems have persisted after a hotfix patch from the studio, and experts have suggested that the game will need a more intensive overhaul in order to run more smoothly on the PC platform.

Load up on paint, and bring your friends, as Nintendo has released its hefty Version 2.1.0. update for its messy multiplayer shooter Splatoon 3. Now available to download on Nintendo Switch, the new patch brings a laundry list of balance tweaks, bug fixes, U.I. polishes, and much more.
It&#x27;s difficult to know where to start when an update has this much coverage... There has been an array of buffs and nerfs to many tools in the Splatoon 3 arsenal, from damage, to spread, to ink consumption, to fire rate. The Dynamo Roller, Jet Squelcher, Sloshing Machine, Aerosprays MG &amp; RG, and Nautilus 47 have all been tweaked, for better or worse, while sub-weapons and gear skills such as Angle Shooter and Ninja Squid have also seen minor overhauls.

Fire Emblem Three Houses made use of amiibo figures through the hilariously named &quot;amiibo Gazebo&quot; location, and the same concept is back for Fire Emblem Engage. Here&#x27;s where to find the new amiibo Gazebo, and what you can actually earn from it. Spoiler alert: for the most part, its function is once again cosmetic and/or menial.

You&#x27;ll unlock the amiibo Gazebo at the start of Chapter 6: it&#x27;s located in the orchard
Like many locations in the Somniel hub area, you&#x27;ll need to gradually unlock the amiibo Gazebo. Once you&#x27;ve started Chapter 6, you&#x27;ll be able to walk over to it in the orchard and interact with the literal gazebo to start the process.

                              <span>Everyone&#x27;s favorite overseer
Good Smile Company has added another iconic video game character to its classy Figma figurine range — This time, it&#x27;s the turn of the charming if unnerving overseer of The Nexus, Demon&#x27;s Souls&#x27; esteemed and much-loved overseer: The Maiden in Black.
The sweet demon stands a little over six inches in height, and is sporting the trademark poseability that is a key feature of all Figma models. This allows the Maiden in Black to be posed in a variety of demure and evocative stances, bringing a sense of morose disquiet to anybody&#x27;s bookshelf or work desk. The maiden comes packaged with a selection of alternate hands, as well as her huge, path-lighting torch. Three variants of her skirt are included, in order to facilitate both sitting and standing poses.

A rarity for the Figma format, Good Smile Co. has released a video of our girl, perhaps aware of the maiden&#x27;s mammoth fan base and the likelihood that she will be one of the more popular Figmas.
If you would like to invite The Maiden in Black Figma into the warmth of your home, then you can pre-order her right now over at the official Good Smile Co. store and other import retailers. The Maiden retails for ¥12,800 (or roughly $93 USD) not including shipping or any potential custom charges. Unfortunately, it will take her a long time to make her way from The Nexus to your house, as global shipping is not expected until January 2024. Still, what a wonderful guest to ring in the new year.
Demon&#x27;s Souls is available now on PS5.

Video game adaptations are more popular than ever, especially when it comes to the games-to-TV/film side of things — just look at the endless conversations surrounding HBO’s adaptation of The Last of Us. Last year I wrote a list of my dream TV shows based on game franchises, and now that some of those are actually coming true, I thought it was high time to flip things around the other way and bring about even more manifestation.
Although they had a heyday in the early-to-mid 2000s in the form of licensed shovelware, TV-to-game adaptations are few and far between as of late — but that doesn’t mean there aren’t some awesome IPs that would make for some killer adaptations into video games. Here’s a short list of some of my current favorite TV shows that wo…</span>

Five backgrounds and five frames are also available.
All of these icons comprise &quot;Wave 1&quot; (implying more are on the way), and they&#x27;ll be available until January 26. In fact, this tweet from the Fire Emblem Japanese account hard confirms more waves (six total). Out of this lot, I suspect Marth will be one of the most-purchased icons; as well potential classic cast members via the Emblem Ring system. That could mean icons for Roy, Ike, Byleth, and tons of other iconic characters.
Remember, to pick these up, you just need to go to the &quot;Switch Online&quot; icon at the bottom of the Switch home screen, then go to &quot;missions and rewards.&quot;

                              <span>Take the Trip
As part of yesterday&#x27;s PlayStation VR2 (PSVR2) update, Sony Interactive Entertainment announced that the hypnotic rhythm-action shooter Rez Infinite will come drifting onto the PS5 platform on February 22, following on from its initial 2016 release on PS4 and PC.
For those yet to embark upon its dazzling odyssey, Rez Infinite is a fully remixed edition of Tetsuya Mizuguchi&#x27;s seminal title, which was first released on PS2 and Dreamcast way back in 2001. Set against the narrative of a hacker, who enters the powerful A.I. system known as EDEN with the goal of eradicating a powerful and dangerous virus that is manifesting itself in every sector of the A.I.&#x27;s program.

                              <span>The promo video is region locked, but the codes aren&#x27;t
In December, The Pokemon Company debuted a YouTube series called &quot;After School Pokemon Research Club,&quot; which involved live action skits, and serves as a means for code distribution. While the video series itself is region locked to Japan, that hasn&#x27;t stopped the Pokemon community from distributing the codes themselves.
Several codes have been distributed thus far from the channel, but the most recent bonus is arguably the most impactful: an Ability Capsule. As a reminder, this relatively expensive item goes for 100,000 Pokecoins at the Chansey Supply storefront, and allows Pokemon to swap between their potential abilities: which can be key for taking down tougher raids, or creating certain builds.
One option is to farm them from higher-end raids, but it&#x27;s a vicious cycle; as you generally need high-end Pokemon for them, and getting Ability Capsules can make that happen. So consider this a little pick me up! Note that this code is live until February 28, so you have some time to enter it.

The code READY4RA1D is also available from the same series, which grants players 20,000 League Points (LP) to use. This second code is live through January 31.
Here’s how to find the mystery gift menu in Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet:
Complete the tutorial all the way up through the start of the treasure hunt (at the academy)
Press X and select “Poke Portal”
On the Poke Portal screen, scroll down and find “mystery gift,” then select that option
Select “get via internet”
Once you connect, it’ll showcase the “Flying Tera Type Pikachu Gift,” though any other active mystery gif promotions will show up as well: select it!

                              <span>Publisher believes demand still high for veteran hardware
While rumors of a successor to the smash-selling platform, Nintendo Switch, simply refuse to die, it seems that Nintendo itself still has plenty of faith in the now six-year-old hybrid platform. In fact, according to a report by Bloomberg, the publisher is ramping up production of Switch units for 2023.
According to Bloomberg&#x27;s sources, Nintendo has already told its suppliers and production partners to prepare for an increase in unit manufacture for the coming fiscal year, which will begin in spring. The report suggests that Nintendo remains confident in the demand for Switch hardware, which it expects to remain high for at least the remainder of 2023. Additionally, the boosted production hopes to cover the spread, given that COVID-19 severely impacted all aspects of industry over the past two years.
With the launch of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom scheduled for May 12, it would not be surprising to see a limited edition themed Switch unit launched alongside the highly anticipated title — the sequel to one of the most popular Switch releases ever, 2017&#x27;s The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. It remains to be seen whether Nintendo has the release schedule necessary to lure in players who are yet to already own a Switch, but given the fact that the publisher has shifted over 114 million consoles in the past six years, it would be prudent not to bet against it.

                              <span>The Merc with a Mouth comin&#x27; to shake shit up
2K Games has released a new trailer spotlighting the first DLC hero headed to its rad comic-book strategy title Marvel&#x27;s Marvel Suns — The infamous, notorious, and damn aggravating mercenary, Deadpool, will be bringing his own personal brand of fourth-wall-breaking mayhem to all platforms January 26.
The DLC update, titled The Good, The Bad, and The Undead, will add The Merc with a Mouth as a recruitable team member, alongside a handful of new story missions, and several new additions to the minions of the Mother of Demons, Lillith. Oh, and Deadpool is also bringing with him new friendship paths, and his own personal research project, Food Truck. Well, a mercenary gotta eat, I suppose.

The Deadpool update is the first of a series of mini-expansions headed to Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns in 2023. Future DLC will include similar packs for the freaky symbiote, Venom; the Living Vampire, Morbius, and the weather-warning X-Men queen, Storm. All character downloads can be purchased separately or are available as part of the Midnight Suns&#x27; season pass. For more details on the game itself, which proved to be one of the finer comic book offerings of recent years, check out Chris Carter&#x27;s review right here.
Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns is available now on PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X. Ports for PS4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch are reportedly in the works, although news on these editions has been a little quiet as of late.

Arc System Works has announced that it will be holding a new beta for its dazzling fighter Guilty Gear Strive in February — Not only will this weekend trial be used to test the title&#x27;s upcoming cross-platform functionality, but it will also give Xbox owners their first taste of GG Strive&#x27;s wild, colorful fighting action.
The beta, which takes place between Friday, February 3 and Monday, February 6, will take place on PlayStation, PC, and both Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S platforms. The beta will feature all 22 characters, including DLC warriors, and a variety of modes including Tutorial, Survival, Mission Mode, Combo Maker, Gallery Vs. COM, and Vs. Online. That&#x27;s a heck of a lot of free content.

Best of all, the trial is open to all players on all platforms, regardless of whether they have purchased Guilty Gear Strive or otherwise. So, if you&#x27;ve been on the fence or wondering what all the fuss is about, then the beta weekend will absolutely provide you with your best opportunity to jump into battle with a massive range of characters and modes. Additionally, PlayStation and Xbox users can battle it out online even without a PlayStation Plus or Xbox Live Gold sub. Not too shabby!
We&#x27;ll be sure to give a heads-up when the Guilty Gear Strive beta application is available for download, so keep your eyes glued to the good ship Destructoid.
Guilty Gear Strive is available now on PlayStation and PC platforms. The Xbox port will launch in spring.

                              <span>A harrowing journey to the end of the world
I never get tired of a good narrative game, so when I see a trailer that looks good enough to grab my attention, I can&#x27;t help but get excited about a potential new story-driven gem. That&#x27;s absolutely the case when it comes to The Pale Beyond, a narrative polar exploration game that&#x27;s set to release on February 24, 2023. The title was originally announced back in November of 2021, and its story will follow the crew of a vessel named The Temperance, who have set out on an expedition toward the South Pole in an attempt to discover the mystery of their lost sister ship, the Viscount, which set out on a journey to find the absolute magnetic South five years prior.
https://youtu.be/PvvkUPPJc_E
The Pale Beyond&#x27;s launch trailer shows off some of the game&#x27;s foremost mechanics, like resource and morale management and survival simulation — one can imagine how those elements will tie into tough narrative choices the player must make for the survival of the crew. What really grabbed me about this game is its art style, from the painterly backdrops to the hand-drawn character portraits. Here&#x27;s hoping that the gameplay experience will hold up against the gorgeous visuals.
I&#x27;m a big fan of these harrowing, tension-filled &quot;journey&quot; narratives, and it&#x27;s certainly not a story I&#x27;ve played in a game for a good while now, so I&#x27;m looking forward to checking out The Pale Beyond once it drops. If the game looks interesting to you as well and you want to get a taste before the release date, there&#x27;s also a demo you can download on The Pale Beyond&#x27;s Steam page right now.

                              <span>Rockstar relists their classic trilogy
GTA fans have had something of a rough go of it the past few years, what with the continued radio silence about GTA 6&#x27;s development since the announcement that it was happening in the first place, and the disappointing launch of Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy — The Definitive Edition back in 2021. Here&#x27;s hoping that today&#x27;s news is still something of a respite, despite the Definitive Edition&#x27;s rough start.
Either way, the trilogy is now available to purchase on Steam, and is also playable on the Steam Deck, which should be exciting to hear for at least some of the GTA diehards out there. Rockstar also stated that they&#x27;ll be making the game available on the Epic Games Store later this month, so Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy — The Definitive Edition will be even more accessible to PC players soon enough.

This is the first time GTA 3, Vice City, and San Andreas will be available on Steam after they were delisted with the release of the Definitive Edition a few years ago -- players previously had to access them through Rockstar&#x27;s own store if they wanted to play them on the PC at all over the past few years. The trilogy is still available to play on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X, but here&#x27;s hoping the Steam Deck capability will make it up to any players who have dealt with any Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy — The Definitive Edition-caused headaches over the past few years.

                              <span>Counting down the 10 Best Star Wars games isn&#x27;t easy, with so many good games out there...
With over four decades of Star Wars games, many of which remain easily accessible to the general public, it can be difficult to narrow things down to such a short list. The quality assurance oversight historically from LucasArts, (Lucasfilm&#x27;s now-defunct gaming division,) and now from Lucasfilm Games (the reformed modern division created by Disney and Lucasfilm), has ensured that developers and publishers put in the necessary time and effort into crafting enjoyable and successful Star Wars titles that don&#x27;t tarnish the reputation of the corporate IP. That said, some games still clearly rise to the surface as being well beyond the usual fare...

Sony&#x27;s next virtual reality headset is on the horizon, and today the company is locking in what will be playable around its launch. In today&#x27;s PlayStation blog, Sony highlights the full launch lineup for the PlayStation VR 2 headset, including a few games newly confirmed for the hardware.
The launch lineup, as Sony lays it out, includes a bevy of titles arriving either on February 22 or within a month after launch. Sony&#x27;s tracking more than 30 games to arrive through March, with familiar names like Horizon, Resident Evil, and Gran Turismo on track. Others, like Tetris Effect, were already VR standards, and will need an additional purchase to upgrade to its PS VR 2 version. Others will have free upgrade options, or like Gran T…</span>

Pocket Card Jockey, Game Freak&#x27;s strange little 3DS mashup of solitaire and horse racing, recently came out on mobile devices, to the delight of anyone who enjoyed the game (e.g. anyone who played it). Nevertheless, it was a little disappointing not to see it come to Switch, since it was a 3DS exclusive to begin with, and Game Freak&#x27;s relationship with Nintendo is pretty tight.
But in a recent interview with Polygon&#x27;s Oli Welsh, programmer Masao Taya spoke about the possibility of Pocket Card Jockey: Ride On! coming to Switch after all — as long as it does well on Apple Arcade.

It&#x27;s no secret that things are costing more these days — and games have been hit just as hard as groceries, rent, and medication, with base prices for new, AAA releases steadily climbing up to (and sometimes past) the $100 mark.
But it seems like those price increases are also affecting older games, as the developers behind strategy management game Factorio today announced a price increase on their game, which has been out in early access since 2016.

Massive Monster, the Australian studio behind runaway indie success Cult of the Lamb, have been hard at work making updates, patches, and quality of life improvements to the game since its release in 2022.
Earlier this week, they released an update that made several changes to the game, allowing players to perform mass blessings, auto cook and fish, and rename their cult. Back in December, they teased a free &quot;major content update&quot; in early 2023 — and we&#x27;ve finally got a look at what it entails.

Anyone who&#x27;s played Disney Dreamlight Valley for longer than a few minutes will have noticed the woeful state of affairs that is the storage system. Each chest can only hold two rows of items — that&#x27;s sixteen slots in total, which is not nearly enough for most people, especially since Dreamlight Valley often asks for humungous numbers of items for quests.
The long-awaited upgrade to this terrible storage system is finally on the way, after the DDV Twitter account ran a poll to gauge whether people were interested in &quot;expanded storage management&quot; in which all the answers were variants of &quot;OBVIOUSLY WE ARE, YOU MONSTERS.&quot; 37,197 people responded in the affirmative (partly because there was no other option).

Remember how we were begging for Team Ladybug&#x27;s gorgeous-looking shmup Drainus to make its way to Switch? Well, it looks like someone was listening! PLAYISM is bringing the 2D side-scrolling shooter to the eShop on 2nd February.
The port was announced a few months ago, but publisher PLAYISM only revealed the game&#x27;s release date today.

Gaming accessory company Gulikit has released a new &#x27;Hall Joystick&#x27; for Switch Joy-Con controllers, promising no drifting or wear and tear with easy &quot;drop in&quot; installation.
We&#x27;re currently in the process of procuring a set for ourselves, so look out for our verdict in the near future, but for now you can check out the product for yourself via the link at the bottom of the article. The Hall Joystick itself costs $29.70 / £29.70, but that might be worth it for the reassurance that drifting may become a thing of the past.

                              <span>Or are you amiibored?
Nintendo&#x27;s amiibo line has been going for over eight years now. Originally launched back on November 21st, 2014 in North America alongside Super Smash Bros. for Wii U, the toys-to-life figurine series has maintained relatively steady interest while competitors like Disney Infinity and Skylanders have completely fallen by the wayside. It&#x27;s a phenomenon that really only Nintendo could successfully pull off for so long.
As we look ahead to 2023 and begin to ponder the prospect of a Switch successor, however, we do admittedly find ourselves thinking about what role amiibo will play in Nintendo’s future. Indeed, once Nintendo is completely done with the Super Smash Bros. line-up (with Sephiroth and Kazuya now available, that leaves just Pyra, Mythra, and Sora), one can’t help but wonder whether that will signal the end for these NFC figures.

Publisher Astrolabe Games and developer ISVR have announced that Brave&#x27;s Rage, an &quot;active-time&quot; deckbuilding game, will be launching on the Nintendo Switch on February 2nd, 2023.
The game will combine an action-time bar (ATB) system that&#x27;s commonly seen in traditional JRPG titles with standard deckbuilding gameplay. It&#x27;s been in early access for around 8 months and is now ready for the prime time, boasting gorgeous cartoon visuals and plenty of depth if you&#x27;re looking to get stuck into some solid RPG action.

                              <span>18% of devs are currently making a game for Switch.
Ahead of the annual Games Developer Conference this March, GDC has released its &#x27;State of the Game&#x27; survey results for 2023, and there are plenty of stats that might interest Switch owners. This annual survey, which you can get a copy of from GDC&#x27;s website, gives us an insight into the current state of the game industry.
For this year&#x27;s survey, GDC spoke to over 2,300 game developers, and there are a few interesting things to note. One is that more game developers now work for independent studios rather than AAA. 39% of the devs surveyed currently work for an indie game company, while 23% work for a AAA developer. Most surveyed have been working in the industry for &quot;10 years or less&quot; — 57% in fact.

If you&#x27;ve swotted up on your gaming history, then you&#x27;ll perhaps already know that the original Donkey Kong from 1981 (lord almighty...) actually started life as a Popeye the Sailor Man project, featuring the main man himself alongside Olive Oyl and antagonist Bluto.
As the tale goes, Nintendo had failed to secure the license for the Popeye project, and so Donkey Kong (along with a certain plumber named Mario Jumpman) was born.

The pair chat with Kyle Hilliard about the first two episodes of HBO&#x27;s The Last Of Us series and share their initial reactions to the show. Unfortunately, the video game industry was subject to massive layoffs this week, with reports of large companies like Microsoft, 343 Industries, and Bethesda reducing their workforce by over 10,000 employees. At the same time, on the media side, our talented peers at Giant Bomb, GameSpot, and Fandom were also affected. 
During The Playlist, the crew chats about recent games they&#x27;ve been playing, including Tchia, PlateUp!, Pentiment, and The Case Of The Golden Idol.

                              <span>We’re approaching the end of 2022, and we’re concluding the year by going back to our Super Replay roots by tackling an old-school survival horror game. In this case, we’re replaying one of the greatest games of the PS1 era, Silent Hill! 
Episode 1 - The Harry Mason Shuffle
Episode 2 - When Doves Cry
Episode 3 - Bible.
Episode 4 - Age Seven, Short, Black Hair
Episode 5 - Map Daddy
Episode 6 - The End is Neigh
In 1999, Konami put the fear of fog in a generation of players with the release of Silent Hill. The eerie title eschewed the more bombastic horror of its main rival at the time, Resident Evil, in favor of more psychological frights. Protagonist Harry Mason must embark on a terrifying search for his missing daughter, Cheryl, within the eerie town of Silent Hill. What unfolds is a descent into madness that kickstarted a franchise that&#x27;s (finally) returning to the limelight after years of dormancy. Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Kyle Hilliard, as we survive Silent Hill’s debut adventure and see how its scares stack up 23 years later.

Velké vydání verze 3.0 přináší vylepšení, např. plovoucích obrázků, napříč podporovanými formáty, k nimž přidává vícestránkové HTML dokumenty. Novinkou je oddělení komponent tak, že Pandoc může běžet nejen v příkazovém rozhraní, ale také jako server či interpret jazyka Lua.</span>

The news leaked out earlier today via esports report Jacob Wolf, who said that sources said cuts had been made across recruiting, human resources, support and esports teams. Riot then confirmed the cuts, saying that they had made &quot;implemented strategic shifts within a few teams to sharpen our focus in a number of areas.&quot;

Now Ubisoft say that they have cancelled it.

I was only sixteen when Remedy&#x27;s monologuing undercover DEA operative dropped into my life like a... well, a man diving sideways in slow motion with twin pistols blazing. It was that kind of time. The Wachowskis had, not too long before, left an indelible mark on cinema, and pop culture at large, with their stylish countercultural smash hit The Matrix. Dressing in a leather jacket while falling over and openly wielding automatic weaponry was legitimately cool, and not at all creepy. Why are you frowning like that, it&#x27;s almost like you don&#x27;t believe me.

The update also introduces a new time-limited event, The Secret Wilds, and some matchmaking improvements for PvP.

                              <span>There’s a lot I’m excited for in Tchia. Revealed at the Game Awards back in 2020, the trailer boasted a whole load of activities: sailing, climbing, ukelele playing, swimming, tree-hopping, slingshot sharpshooting, totem carving, gliding - the list is never ending - and all set on a beautiful island with characters to talk to, quests to complete, and enemies to fight. And on top of all that, you also have the ability to &quot;soul-jump&quot; letting you control any animal or object.
It sounds too good to be true, right? But two years after Awaceb&#x27;s trailer debut, I’ve gotten my hands on a preview build to see whether a nine-person dev team’s tropical island exploration game is pie in the sky. Turns out, it’s the opposite; my hands on time suggests Tchia will deliver on everything it promised and more.

                              <span>The CEO of Ubisoft has apologised to staff for comments he made in an email last week, which appeared to blame employees for cuts and delays at the publisher. Kotaku report that Yves Guillemot began a Q&amp;A meeting with an apology for his suggestion that sorting out issues at Ubisoft was the responsibility of lower-level staff, summarised by the phrase “the ball is in your court”. Guillemot had come under fire from Ubisoft staff following his comments, which prompted calls from one French union for Ubisoft Paris staff to strike later this month.

                              <span>I thought my love affair with Like A Dragon: Ishin&#x27;s teasers had peaked, but no, my heart still swells at an alarming rate. And that&#x27;s thanks to a new trailer where Kiryu/Ryoma drop (kicks) his bruising samurai lifestyle to the side for a simpler, purer existence: chopping spring onions to a rhythm in what looks to be an in-depth farming side activity. Game Of The Year.

                              <span>Microsoft has announced mass layoffs that will affect the developers behind Starfield, Halo Infinite, and Gears Of War. Bloomberg report that it’s not yet known what the scale of the job losses at Bethesda and 343 Industries will be, and Kotaku has also confirmed that The Coalition will also lose staff. Sources claim that some of the staff who’d lost their jobs at the affected studios were veterans who’d been with Microsoft for more than a decade. This layoff announcement from Microsoft has been made exactly a year after the company revealed they were buying Activision Blizzard.

That&#x27;s the case today with this deal on a 32GB dual-channel kit of DDR5-6000 from TeamGroup, specifically their T-Force Delta RGB RAM. It&#x27;s been reduced from its ridiculous launch MSRP of $339.99 down to $149.99, a great price for this spec and especially for a kit that comes equipped with RGB lighting. 
(If you&#x27;d prefer the same kit without RGB, then it can be yours for $133.)

                              <span>Little vegetable people living their little vegetable lives
I am always on the hunt for a new cozy simulation game, because playing a relaxing city/life/community sim is one of my favorite ways to wind down after a long day. One upcoming title I&#x27;ve had my eye on is Gourdlets, a city-building simulator that has &quot;no objectives, no points, just building.&quot; Say no more — I know for a fact that this title is going to be right up my alley, especially with its pastel color palette and adorable vegetable villagers.
Based on a new trailer that publisher AuntyGames posted, will be able to decorate their towns with all kinds of cute buildings, trees, flowers, crops, fences, and paths. Your villagers will also be able to take part in cozy activities like roasting marshmallows, building sand castles, and the simulator staple: fishing. You&#x27;ll be able to &quot;Watch the population of gourdlets grow and interact with the town as you create it,&quot; according to the game&#x27;s Steam page, and chill out as you &quot;watch the little gourdlets live their little lives.&quot;
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;Ni_LoaTunj4
I&#x27;m excited to see a new entry in the cozy simulator genre that&#x27;s more of an open-ended, sandboxy thing as opposed to a game with a more rigid quest structure. I&#x27;ve been having a blast with Disney&#x27;s Dreamlight Valley, but I know after binging dozens of hours of a game that requires a good deal of grinding for materials, a more relaxed experience will be a welcome respite. Gourdlets&#x27; gameplay and art style also remind me of another excellent city-builder called Townscaper, which shares in its bright colors and laid-back tone.
Gourdlets doesn&#x27;t have a release window yet, but the extended demo is available to download on Steam right now!

                              <span>The game is the story
When people talk about the ideal &quot;video game story,&quot; they&#x27;re usually talking about something like Final Fantasy VI or Metal Gear Solid. A &quot;good story&quot; in a video game is usually a coherent narrative with characters and events, ideally one that&#x27;s augmented or enhanced by gameplay. On occasion, folks will point to something like Dwarf Fortress, a game that uses the foundations of interactivity to generate elaborate narratives.

I think there&#x27;s another, more interesting type of video game narrative, though. It&#x27;s a kind that only exists in games and one that exists in every game. It&#x27;s not always written deliberately, and it often comes into view only after the game has been play…</span>

                              <span>We missed you, 1v1
Warzone 2.0 brought about a whole host of changes to Call of Duty&#x27;s beloved battle royale mode, but the most divisive of them all has to be the new version of the Gulag, which changed from a 1v1 fight to a 2v2 with the introduction of the sequel. As if it wasn&#x27;t already hard enough contending with two enemies instead of one, especially if you have a teammate who is AFK, uncooperative, etc., they also added a Jailer with a minigun for you to contend with, too. It&#x27;s clear to me why this was one of the least popular changes that came along with Warzone 2.0.
Thankfully we won&#x27;t have to put up with it for very much longer, though, because Infinity Ward has announced on Twitter that they&#x27;re reverting the Gulag back to its former 1v1 glory. This change is scheduled to be implemented along with the Season 2 update for both Warzone 2.0 and Modern Warfare II, which we learned yesterday has been delayed by two weeks. I guess this gives us yet another reason to look forward to the game&#x27;s second season, along with bug fixes, a new Raid episode, and new game modes, just to name a few of the upcoming features.
https://twitter.com/InfinityWard/status/1616133411189710848
Season 2 is officially dropping on February 15, as per a tweet from the Call of Duty Twitter account yesterday, so we only have to deal with the 2v2 shenanigans for a little while longer. It&#x27;s nice that they wanted to branch out and try something new to keep things feeling fresh, but unfortunately, this turned out to be more of a &quot;if it ain&#x27;t broke, don&#x27;t fix it&quot; situation.

                              <span>French national anti-piracy agency Arcom has announced that sports organizations and Internet providers have signed a new anti-piracy agreement. Blocking measures are already cemented in law, but the new agreement establishes &#x27;good practices&#x27; while also addressing costs. The ISPs, meanwhile, call on search engines and hosting companies to follow suit.

                              <span>A few days ago, GitHub disabled the domain of a Pirate Bay Proxy information portal following a DMCA notice sent by City of London Police. The operator of the site is unhappy with the removal. In a DMCA counternotice, GitHub is asked to reinstate the domain since it doesn&#x27;t link to any infringing material. According to the counternotice, the police don&#x27;t seem to understand how the site works.

AMD&#x27;s Linux enablement code around Automatic IBRS has been undergoing review the past few months and now via TIP&#x27;s x96/cpu Git branch is to be sent in next month for the Linux 6.3 merge window. I&#x27;ve run some preliminary benchmarks of the Automatic IBRS support on Zen 4 and it&#x27;s looking positive for further enhancing the performance of AMD&#x27;s new Ryzen 7000 series and EPYC 9004 series processors.</span>

                              <span>As announced in a recent blog post, 13 new games are coming to PlayStation VR2, and they’re all expected to release “within one month of the February 22 launch.” They are as follows:
Before Your Eyes
Kayak VR: Mirage
Pavlov VR
Puzzling Places
Song in the Smoke: Rekindled
Synth Riders: Remastered Edition
Thumper
NFL Pro Era
What the Bat?
Rez Infinite
Tetris Effect
Creed Rise to Glory: Championship Edition
The Last Clockwinder
The blog post also mentions that Gran Turismo 7 will receive a free VR2 update on launch day. A statement from the president of Polyphony Games details that “While 2-player splitscreen races are not supported in VR, all other races, including online races, will be available.” In case you missed it, Resident Evil Village will also get a VR update on launch day.
This list of 13 joins the existing lineup of 11 VR games PlayStation announced last November and the six games announced in December. Combined with other previously announced titles, like Horizon: Call of the Mountain, PlayStation VR2 will have over 30 games available to play within a month of launch.
PlayStation VR2 is set to come out on February 22, just over a month from today. A few months ago, we learned that the base model will cost $549.99, with the option to bundle it with Horizon Call the Mountain for an additional $50.

EA Sports has been producing officially licensed PGA Tour video games since 1990, with stars like Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy lending their names to the product over the years. However, the company has not released a PGA Tour video game since 2015, meaning other franchises have had time to slide into the space once occupied by EA Sports’ mainstay series.
However, EA Sports is ready to make up for lost time with its newest title. The emphasis this time around is on realism, not only with how the players and courses look but also in how players must approach every hol…</span>

                              <span>A Ubisoft game known as Project Q leaked early last year before the Assassin&#x27;s Creed maker revealed its existence, calling it a team-based battle arena combat game. 
Insider Gaming reported yesterday that Ubisoft had canceled Project Q and now, Ubisoft has confirmed that this is, in fact, true to Video Games Chronicle. 
&quot;We can confirm we will no longer support the development of Project Q in order to focus on priority projects, to which our teams are being reallocated,&quot; Ubisoft told VGC. 
This cancelation comes after Ubisoft delayed Skull and Bones last week alongside news that it had canceled three unannounced games. It&#x27;s currently unclear if Project Q was one of those three games canceled (while Project Q was technically announced, it was revealed as an in-the-works project rather than a game with a final title so perhaps Ubisoft considered it unannounced). 
For more, read about what Project Q was going to be here.

                              <span>Pokémon Scarlet and Violet arrived on Switch last November, and the Pokémon Trading Card Game is ready to leave Galar for the open world of Paldea. That first Scarlet and Violet expansion arrives this March (alongside various changes, including a price increase), but first, we have one more Sword and Shield expansion to get to.
Pokémon Trading Card Game: Sword &amp; Shield – Crown Zenith, out this week, adds more than 160 new cards, including 3 new Radiant Pokémon, five Pokémon VMax cards, eight Pokémon VStar cards, and 70 cards with special Galarian Gallery artwork. The Pokémon Company sent over some of the products in this special expansion, and we cracked them to see what we could pull.
Though I&#x27;m frustrated you can&#x27;t buy these as individual booster packs (they&#x27;re only available in larger packs like the Elite Trainer Box and special collections), I absolutely love several of the cards I pulled. In particular, the full-art cards are absolutely striking. I&#x27;m very happy with the Radiant Charizard, and the Pikachu and Lucario cards might be among my favorites of those respective Pokémon. You can see the full gallery below.

Pokémon Trading Card Game: Sword &amp; Shield – Crown Zenith arrives starting on January 20 with the Elite Trainer Box and Collections starring Regieleki V or Regidrago V. New Tins and Collections will arrive through May. For all things Pokémon Trading Card Game, head to our special hub by clicking the banner below!</span>

The company hasn&#x27;t revealed exact numbers and specific departments regarding the layoffs yet, but some employees at Bethesda Game Studios, which is hard at work getting Starfield ready for its release this year, were laid off. According to a Bloomberg report, though, Halo Infinite developer 343 Industries was hit hardest by the layoffs. Again, neither Microsoft nor 343 Industries has revealed an exact number but based on industry discussion online, it seems like the studio lost quite a lot of people.

                              <span>Microsoft has laid off 10,000 employees. 
This news comes from a Bloomberg report detailing that Microsoft&#x27;s layoff come as the company attempts to reduce costs amid a larger economic slowdown. These layoffs come amidst Microsoft&#x27;s ongoing fight against the FTC to acquire Call of Duty makers Activision Blizzard for a staggering $69 billion. Bloomberg reports that some people at Bethesda Game Studios, which is hard at work on getting Starfield ready for its release sometime in the first half of this year, were laid off, but that Halo Infinite developer 343 Industries was hit hardest in the company&#x27;s portfolio of game studios. 
According to Bloomberg, Microsoft has plans to hire in &quot;strategic, competitive areas&quot; like AI but that other tech-focused departments like HoloLens and some engineering divisions were hit by these layoffs. 
Microsoft has not yet revealed exact numbers and specific departments surrounding this massive wave of layoffs. Another tech giant, Amazon, is in the middle of its own string of layoffs as the company aims to reduce its workforce by 18,000. 
The hearts of Game Informer&#x27;s staff are with all those who were affected by these layoffs.

                              <span>The decade-old PlayStation 4, released all the way back in 2013, has continued to receive big, new exclusives from Sony, even if those old-gen ports feel outdated or inferior. But now, it finally seems like Sony is ready to move on and leave the aging PS4 behind. Well, almost ready…

                              <span>Ubisoft hasn’t had the best couple of years. A string of flops and disappointments means the company isn’t in the best shape as it heads into 2023, so in an attempt to get everyone firing last week CEO Yves Guillemot sent an email to staff telling them “The ball is in your court”. It did not go down well.

                              <span>You may be able to hack your way across the Lands Between, but do you really know them? Can you tell your Nokrons from your Nokstellas? How about your Sanctums from your Catacombs? Can you distinguish between the Ainsel River and the Ainsel River Main? Look me in the eye and tell me you can pinpoint the Cathedral of Manus Celes, I dare you.
Alternatively, you can try out this fan-made Elden Ring Geoguessr-inspired game that plonks you into a random bit of the map and scores you based on how close you can drop a pin to your true location. If Rings aren&#x27;t your thing LostGamer.io has maps from other games, too, including Skyrim and Fortnite. It&#x27;s a lovely idea.

                              <span>I still say the Hylics games are some of the prettiest around, with their striking mix of claymation and video capture. So I&#x27;m delighted to realise that, unbeknowst to me, creator Mason Lindroth occasionally give behind-the-scenes peeks at props and animations on Twitter. It is very interesting to see those original handcrafted figures. And it is very funny to discover that the process of animating one character&#x27;s hands involved wearing a little cardboard green screen like a shroud while waggling a sexy gloved arm through the hole.

I played Returnal last year and can confirm that it is splendid, and also that you will grow to hate the kamikaze squid in the final area with every fibre of your being. Presuming you get that far.

They&#x27;ve announced Titan will be out for realsies on January 31st, when it will unshackle itself from its early access chains while forcing thousands more workers into indentured labour. 
It&#x27;s more than just a slick sci-fi city builder, boasting battleship combat and the ability to tinker with what goes on inside your buildings.

                              <span>Far Cry 2 is a lot of things, based on the memories I have from playing it a decade ago. First and foremost, I recall Far Cry 2: Parasitic Pain, which tasks you with running around begging for pills to stave off a growing infection. Next comes Far Cry 2: Buddy Bonanza, which lets you make lots of lovely AI friends, charge into battles together, and then hide while they die. Then, there’s Far Cry 2: Firewatch, which is all about watching fire. It&#x27;s the best.

                              <span>The EU have voted to push for reform in the videogame industry, backing a report that takes aim at everything from loot boxes to human rights violations tied up with gold-farming. The report includes calls for better parental control options, &quot;harmonised rules&quot; compelling sellers to show more information about game content, and a clamp down on third-party skin gambling.
Those are all laudable goals, but time will tell how much change this actually amounts to.

                              <span>Something you could never accuse A Plague Tale: Requiem of is a lack of eye candy. As grim, gory, and engulfed in rats as this medieval stealth adventure is, mon dieu is it a looker on PC. For those among us with one of the brawnier graphics cards on the market, it’s just become even prettier too, via the slightly delayed implementation of ray tracing.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been holding something in for 5 years. It first started as a deep joy, like a ray of sunshine in the palm of my hand. Then it became a deep sense of longing for something I&#x27;d lost, like a cascade of sand that fell from my palm as I wept gently on an empty beach. The &quot;it&quot; is a mobile and Nintendo Switch game called Pokémon Quest (don&#x27;t laugh), which was the first - and only -  mobile game I&#x27;ve actively obsessed over.
The game&#x27;s an auto-battler where you gather a small trio from the original 150 Pokéfolks, level them up, and then tackle trickier and trickier stages. After a frankly disgusting number of hours, I&#x27;d finished all the stages. So, I thought, &quot;Yes, of course they will add the 2nd generation of Pokéfolks with a bunch of new stages. This is its natural evolution, if you will&quot;. It still hasn&#x27;t happened and probably never will. And I hate that I can&#x27;t find anything else that&#x27;ll replace it.

Taking place at 9.30am PST / 5.30pm GMT, it&#x27;s not clear what the SteamWorld Telegraph: Special Broadcast will entail just yet, but given we already know several SteamWorld games are in development at the moment, here&#x27;s a rough guess-timate of what to expect.

                              <span>Indonesian studio Mojiken have been making games for years. Most of them are less than an hour long. They&#x27;re short, punchy adventures and cover everything from digital fortune tellers, violin-playing owl-men, and poetic folktales about potato-shaped forest creatures. 
A Space For The Unbound is Mojiken’s first &#x27;big&#x27; release in that sense, clocking in at around nine-ish hours. What begins as a YA coming-of-age tale about a small-town romance quickly gains remarkable momentum, and suddenly you’re dealing with supernatural teens trying to desperately stop a world-ending calamity. Part sci-fi drama, part high school romance, A Space For The Unbound manages to have incredible weight and grandeur while also being poignant, sweet, and honest at the same time. It&#x27;s a triumph.

                              <span>Last time, you decided that programmable party members are better than optional grinding. I can respect that. Yeah, it&#x27;s sometimes fun to turn your brain off and grind out a bit, but there&#x27;s a lot to say for doing the work up front to get your party and builds running correctly then just watch them go. This week, I ask you to choose between one thing which speaks to my inner teenager, and one thing which speaks to my inner child. What&#x27;s better: big engines rising from the bonnet, or knocking folks over edges?

                              <span>In games it&#x27;s often a delight to be proven wrong. Such as, for example, my longstanding belief that Dwarf Fortress would never make the biggest and most important change it possibly could, and fit itself with an interface fit for purpose.

Bay 12 Games have, of course, gone further than that, and released it for general sale on the biggest shop in the business after sixteen years as freeware. There&#x27;s even a charming new graphics overhaul to replace the famous ASCII symbols which, depending on who you ask, might not have technically counted as &quot;graphics&quot; at all.
I&#x27;m not here to discuss the relative merits of this shiny new version and the &quot;classic&quot; version. Both will be updated in future, the latter still free, and neither expected to reach a full 1.0 release inside 20 years. All this chips around the edges of what I&#x27;ve been pondering, which is this: What exactly is Dwarf Fortress&#x27;s place within our culture now, after a decade replete with games that looked to it for ideas?

                              <span>In 2021 I reviewed Backbone, a masterpiece of 2D pixelart that was partly a point &#x27;n&#x27; click detective noir game, and mostly a grim story-focused fever dream about collectivism. At the time I described it as &quot;like The Good Place with more depression, or Disco Elysium with raccoons.&quot; Backbone has an ending so bizarre on a literal level that it defies description even if I wanted to spoil it. A while back developers Eggnut teased that they were working on a new game, and it turns out that game is Tails: The Backbone Preludes, a prequel that probably won&#x27;t answer any questions you might&#x27;ve had about the ending of Backbone. It&#x27;s also out very soon, on February 2nd.

                              <span>Part of RPS’s goal is to shine a spotlight on every corner of the gaming peninsula, and a BIG part of that includes the incredible realm of indie games. In additional to our written work about the wonderful world of indie games, starting from now we&#x27;ll also be doing that across the audio waves in the form of our brand new podcast, Indiescovery!
Indiescovery is the new sibling in the RPS podcast family and will sit snuggly next to Ultimate Audio Bang, and The Electronic Wireless Show, but our focus is strictly on the wonderful world of indie games. It’s best to think of the podcast as an extension of our Indiescovery tag on the site - although we&#x27;ve got the Indiescovery Podcast tag just for the pod, if you ever want to check all the episodes. Every episode video bud Liam, guides lass Rebecca and myself (reviews ranger Rachel) will highlight a bunch of cool indies and talk about why we love them. We&#x27;ll be gabbing about the latest indie darlings, exciting upcoming releases, hidden gems lost to space and time, and more.

This puts it within the top echelon of SSDs - perhaps why we named it the best PCIe 4.0 SSD for gaming!

Both are great drives for the money, so if you&#x27;re in the market for a storage upgrade you&#x27;ve just got to decide whether you can benefit from the faster speeds and better components of the KC3000, or whether you prefer the lower price of the P3.

And now it&#x27;s 85% off this week on Steam, meaning you can pick it up for £2.69/$3.

Everyone has something they loved spending time with in the past – a restaurant, a daily-play video game, a group of friends – only to one day unknowingly enjoy doing so for the final time. It&#x27;s a poignant and often heartbreaking truth of how places evolve, tastes change, and priorities divert as we all grow older. For the eponymous hero in Lil Gator Game, that activity is live-action role-playing with his big sis. With his sister home from college, Gator assembles a master plan to pry her away from her coursework for one more game. The resulting adventure is a short, cute, Zelda-in…</span>

                              <span>Netflix&#x27;s Sonic Prime series hit the streaming service back in December, and it seems more episodes are on the way. 
While it sits at a 60 percent critic score on Rotten Tomatoes, Sonic Prime received an 88 percent audience score, which is pretty great as far as video game TV shows go. Of course, Rotten Tomatoes doesn&#x27;t account for every person that watched the series, but it&#x27;s a quick look at what audiences thought. It seems Netflix is ready to answer the desire for more because the official Sonic the Hedgehog Twitter account announced today that more Sonic Prime episodes are coming later this year.

As you can see, there&#x27;s not much to go on here, so it&#x27;s currently unclear if these are just additional episodes or the reveal that a Season 2 is happening. Regardless, more Sonic Prime is coming to Netflix in 2023.

                              <span>Developer Avalanche and publisher Warner Bros. Interactive have released a new cinematic trailer for Hogwarts Legacy, giving viewers a bird&#x27;s eye view, literally, of the titular school and the surrounding castle grounds. 
With Hogwarts Legacy due out on current-get consoles and PC in just a few weeks, on February 10, it&#x27;s no surprise we&#x27;re getting a trailer like this today. It&#x27;s a great look at what to expect in the game, including beasts and creatures, characters like Professor Weasley and Nearly Headless Nick, and more. There&#x27;s even some Avada Kadavra-casting foes to be seen, as well as dragons and spiders to fights. And all of it is shown through the view of an owl delivering a Hogwarts acceptance letter to a soon-to-be wizard. 
Check out the 4K version of this Hogwarts Legacy cinematic trailer below: 


For more about Hogwarts Legacy, check out everything we learned in the second gameplay showcase, which aired last month, and then read about the latest details revealed during a Sony State of Play last year. Check out Hogwarts Legacy&#x27;s PlayStation 5 DualSense features after that. Read about how controversial Harry Potter creator JK Rowling is not involved with the making of Hogwarts Legacy (although she will almost certainly be getting money as a direct result of this game) and then check out this trailer showcasing common rooms, easter eggs, and more. 
Hogwarts Legacy hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on February 10. It launches on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on April 4, and finally, the Switch version will be released on July 25.

                              <span>With last week&#x27;s launch of Intel&#x27;s 4th Gen Xeon Scalable Sapphire Rapids server processors, Intel heavily talked up the shiny new accelerators and the big performance potential of AMX, but not really showcased and only heard through the grapevine was the improved AVX-512 implementation found with these new processors. With Sapphire Rapids there is reduced penalties from engaging AVX-512 -- and for some AVX-512 instructions, no longer any measurable impact -- compared to prior generation Xeon processors. In this article is a look at the performance for a wide variety of workloads with AVX-512 on/off not just for Sapphire Rapids but also for prior generation Ice Lake as well as AMD&#x27;s new EPYC 4th Gen &quot;Genoa&quot; processors where they have introduced AVX-512 for the first time.</span>

Ty fungují dobře, ale při vyplňování formulářů mají velké problémy s českými znaky. Je to způsobené tím, že samotný standard PDF zná jen základní sady znaků, v kterých znaky české abecedy chybí, vysvětluje Jiří Eischmann na stránkách MojeFedora.cz. Standard sice zná ještě znakovou sadu RTF, ale ta zase není podporovaná všemi klienty. Najít tedy řešení nad rámec standardu, které bude kompatibilní napříč různými implementacemi, není jednoduchá záležitost.</span>

In response, they&#x27;re calling for Ubisoft Paris employees to strike from 2 to 6pm on Friday, January 27th, with demands that include an &quot;immediate 10% increase for all salaries&quot; and the &quot;implementation of a 4-day week.&quot;

                              <span>As someone whose only experience with the Persona series lay with Persona 5, I dove into Persona 3 Portable&#x27;s PC re-release with one expectation: it will be old and therefore quite bad. Looking back, was I naïve? Yes. And was I wrong? I&#x27;m delighted to report that I was catastrophically wrong.
From what I&#x27;ve played so far of Persona 3, I reckon it&#x27;s well worth a whirl if you&#x27;re a newcomer, or a Persona 5 fan who&#x27;s concerned that a game from 2009 won&#x27;t be all that good. Not only does it stand on its own as a fun high school mystery with an alarmingly dark undertone, it almost acts as a fun history lesson too.

                              <span>According to the definitely legit authority of Dangerousroads(dot)Org (and maybe also the Guinness Book Of Records), the actual longest road on Earth is the Pan-American Highway, measuring 30,000km long, and spanning several different countries as it wends its way from the bottom of South America to top of Alaska. I can&#x27;t even imagine how long it would take you to do a full journey across it all, but it will definitely take you longer than the two hours you&#x27;ll spend in the company of Brainwash Gang&#x27;s loosely connected anthology story game The Longest Road On Earth. But cor, what a lovely, wistful two hours those are all the same.

Paradox announced the DLC today after details, screenshots and a trailer leaked ahead of the reveal through SteamDB. YouTuber Aspec also uploaded a video detailing the leak and revealing the DLC’s trailer, which has since been made private. You can watch the official trailer below.

                              <span>What’s the purpose of creative tools such as Halo Infinite’s Forge beta if you can’t use them to stuff things from other, completely unrelated games into your timesink of choice? Well, Hinfinite map makers LudoHT and Its L0L0 have done exactly that, crafting a surprisingly authentic version of Mario Kart’s DK Mountain track. It sounds like there’ll be more tracks to slide your Mongoose around too, as they’ve also gone and made a Mario Kart race gametype for Halo Infinite.

                              <span>We had a discussion in our Monday meeting that got louder than things normally do, because The Last Of Us TV show came up, and we found ourselves divided into two camps. Well, three. Camp one was excited for the TV show and camp two posited that there&#x27;s no point making an adaptation of something if your adaptation is just the same thing. (The third camp was &quot;eh, I might check it out&quot; and watched the other two camps duking it out). I was in camp two. If you&#x27;re adapting something, adapt! Make changes! Otherwise I might as well just consume the original thing again! The Last Of Us has already been released, what, three times?
This was made funnier by the fact that nobody on staff had seen the TV show, so we were just arguing about tweets we&#x27;d seen that describe the show, the worst way to conduct a discussion outside of e.g. scrawling insults on the side of Teslas and self-driving them into each other&#x27;s front doors. But it got me to thinking about adaptations, because there have been loads of adaptations of things that aren&#x27;t games into video games. What goes wrong in the other direction?

Since 2019, YouTuber &quot;Mojo Swoptops&quot; has rebuilt a wide and weird range of Edinburgh sights inside Far Cry 5&#x27;s level editor, from the big tourist landmarks like the castle and Forth Bridge to perfectly mundane places such as blocks of flats and nightclubs at chucking-out time. As an Edinburgh resident, it&#x27;s great fun to see, and a very pleasing contrast to the gleaming miniature reimagination seen in Forza Horizon 4.

                              <span>Survival MMO The Day Before may have slipped out of its top spot on Steam’s most wanted games list, but it’s still the second most anticipated game on Valve’s storefront. Up to now, devs Fntastic haven’t shared unedited footage of the game in the lead up to its planned release on March 1st, but they say that’s about to change with a showcase of features at some point in January. You can watch the most recent, very short clip of edited ray-traced footage from The Day Before from this month’s CES show below.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve played around four hours of soviet-punk FPS Atomic Heart, which took me from the story&#x27;s opening moments to plenty of the game&#x27;s earliest bits. The final hour or so was split into two parts, thanks to a lovely dev who time-skipped me forwards and into the game&#x27;s open world, before warping me through a gate and into an early boss&#x27;s lair. There was a lot to take in, from robo-gloves, to sex-dom vending machines, to grannies with bazookas.
I went in with expectations that it might be a little like BioShock, all steely and serious in its delivery of some vaguely philosophical truth. But I emerged with a totally different impression. Far from polished seriousness, Atomic Heart seems a little disjointed in its ambition, with a main character who almost immediately kills any atmosphere when he opens his mouth.

The winner of this impromptu contest is Kingston&#x27;s NV2, an expectedly budget drive that still manages to deliver some fairly impressive performance according to independent reviews. To squeak in under the £50 mark, you&#x27;ll need to use code JAN10 at the checkout at Ebay.

                              <span>OK, this isn&#x27;t fair. A week ago, I was genuinely excited that the Ryzen 7 5800X3D was down to £348 at Amazon. Now though, thanks to a rogue 10% off deal at Ebay, you can pick up the same processor from Ebuyer&#x27;s Ebay store for £306. 
£306! That&#x27;s a tiny price for a CPU that launched last year at an official RRP of £429 and a real-life asking price of £530. To get this reduced price, use code JAN10 at the checkout.

                              <span>The legal battle between the RIAA and Yout.com will go to appeal before potential attorneys&#x27; fees are awarded, a federal court has ruled. The RIAA asked for $250,000 after winning its case against the YouTube ripper. However, according to Yout, a payment now would seriously harm its legal defense as funds are running low.

                              <span>The European Commission has issued a call for evidence to support an incoming &quot;toolbox&quot; to combat piracy of live events. For the next month, stakeholders are invited to share experiences and potential solutions to tackle pirate IPTV services. The only caveat is that proposals must be actionable under existing law, which rightsholders say isn&#x27;t up to the job.

                              <span>Persona 3 released in North America in 2007 on PlayStation 2 and was a mild hit. The dark, teen drama RPG had a niche audience, but those who found the game adored it. The game received a special edition release with added in content in 2008 with FES, and was then re-released a third time for PSP in 2010 with the most added content, but some modifications made to run on Sony&#x27;s handheld platform.
Persona 4 followed – again a mild hit – but then Persona 5 came along and cemented the franchise&#x27;s reputation as one of the best RPGs ever made. Fans who discovered the series with 5 have wanted to figure out what they&#x27;ve been missing out on, and longtime players have been demanding the re-release of 3 so that a larger audience could play what many call their favorite. After arguably too long, Atlus is finally ready to make that happen with the re-re-re-release of Persona 3 on modern consoles January 19.
Join Kyle Hilliard and Wesley LeBlanc as they look at the game&#x27;s first true dungeon and chat about perhaps the most controversial Persona game in the series.

                              <span>Heads up, Stadia owners: Google’s cloud gaming program is shutting down today, January 18. The service began issuing refunds for all hardware last November, but if you haven’t received one yet, information on how to obtain one should have been emailed to the Google account used to make the purchase. However, past Stadia Pro subscriptions will not receive refunds.
There&#x27;s a silver lining for those of you with Stadia controllers and nothing to use them for. You can download an update that will allow your controller to use Bluetooth. However, be warned: this permanently disables wi-fi capabilities, so if you download the update now, you won&#x27;t be able to play Stadia games before the shutdown. For more details, you can visit the Stadia Help Center.
Stadians, you can now update your Stadia Controller’s firmware to enable Bluetooth Low Energy connections.

If you missed the news about the shutdown, last September, Stadia’s VP and General Manager said in a blog post that “while Stadia&#x27;s approach to streaming games for consumers was built on a strong technology foundation, it hasn&#x27;t gained the traction with users that we expected so we’ve made the difficult decision to begin winding down our Stadia streaming service.” 
Stadia’s struggles were no secret. Its first-party studios were shut down just over a year in, with the service being “deprioritized” a year later. While it was an interesting experiment, some experiments are just destined to fail. Rest in peace, Stadia.</span>

Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty’s public demo gave players a chance to experience a more general idea of what this fast-paced action game offers, but Koei Tecmo recently gave us the chance to go deeper and play through the first two chapters in Wo Long in full. I’m starting to understand that developer Team Ninja is aiming for a wider swath of players with Wo Long as opposed to its Nioh titles, which are some of the most demanding in games. While Wo Long still features that trademark From Software-inspired challenge, it also features a unique system that allows you to change an enemy’s…</span>

                              <span>The Last of Us, the highly anticipated TV adaptation of Naughty Dog&#x27;s hit game of the same name, finally premiered Sunday and it&#x27;s looking like a massive hit for HBO. 
That&#x27;s because The Last of Us&#x27; premiere was the second largest debut for an HBO series since 2010, beaten only by last year&#x27;s House of the Dragon, the first TV spinoff from HBO&#x27;s Game of Thrones series. The Last of Us drew in 4.7 million views, according to a Deadline report, coming in second to House of the Dragon&#x27;s 2022 premiere which pulled in 9.986 million watchers. The Last of Us is matched by HBO&#x27;s Boardwalk Empire, which premiered in 2010 to 4.81 million viewers. 
Deadline writes that HBO says Sunday night viewing usually represents 20 to 40% of a given show&#x27;s gross audience per episode (HBO shows typically release episodes on Sunday nights). 
&quot;We are thrilled to see fans of the series and game alike experience this iconic story in a new way, and we extend our gratitude to them for helping to make it a success,&quot; CEO and chairman of HBO and HBO Max Content Casey Bloys said, according to Deadline. &quot;Congratulations to [showrunners Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann, who is also a co-creator of The Last of Us], and the brilliant cast and crew who worked tirelessly to bring this show to life. We look forward to fans around the world enjoying the rest of the season.&quot; 
&quot;Our focus was simply to make the best possible adaption of this beloved story for as big an audience as we could,&quot; Druckmann and Mazin said, according to Deadline. &quot;We are overjoyed to see how many fans, both old and new, have welcomed The Last of Us into their homes and their hearts.&quot; 
While waiting for this week&#x27;s episode, read our interview with Druckmann and Joel actor Pedro Pascal about how The Last of Us was changed for TV, and then read about how there are no plans for The Last of Us show to go beyond the games.

This image, which you can view in the tweet below, comes from the 4chan forum, as reported by Video Games Chronicle, which has also verified with sources that the image is real. The image appears to be Suicide Squad&#x27;s start menu and features standard things like game mode selection, chapter select, difficulty, and matchmaking. It also features some menus to page through at the top, including a &quot;Battle Pass&quot; one. Under those top-bar menus are what appear to be various currencies, too. 
First look at the Suicide Squad game menu. Mentions Battle Pass, Loadout, Missions based structure. #Batman #SuicideSquad pic.twitter…</span>

&quot;You know how fuzzy memories can be.&quot; It&#x27;s a convenient and hand-wavy line delivered by the new character Lim, warning the Straw Hat Pirates of the impending adventures into some of One Piece&#x27;s most popular story arcs. Likewise, One Piece Odyssey can be a fuzzy experience. It oscillates between being thrilling and tedious. The promise of discovering &quot;what if…?&quot; scenarios is enticing for longtime fans, but it rarely follows through in a meaningful way. And as a potential introductory point for new fans, One Piece O…</span>

Golf Story was one of the biggest surprises in the Switch’s extremely strong first year on the market. Thanks to Golf Story’s charming, nostalgic presentation and novel sports/RPG fusion, Sports Story has long been one of my most anticipated sequels. Unfortunately, its unfocused nature and frustrating gameplay are only overshadowed by a pervasive lack of polish that prevents Sports Story from being worth your time. 
As the name suggests, Sports Story expands the world to include other games while creating a more sweeping and ambitious story. As sports go…</span>

                              <span>Awesome Games Done Quick (AGDQ) started the New Year with a bang, raising over $2.6 million for the Prevent Cancer Foundation. For the unfamiliar, GDQ is a 24-hour charity live-stream where dedicated gamers show off speedruns of their favorite games. Before 2020, most events were held in person, but since then they&#x27;ve mostly been broadcasted from streamers&#x27; homes. This year&#x27;s event ran from January 8-15 and included over 140 runs.

While most runners don&#x27;t expect to set new records during the marathon, a whopping four were set this year for the following games: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder&#x27;s Revenge, PowerWash Simulator, Super Mario Galaxy 2, and Steven Seagal Is: The Final Option (Prototype). Most years have one or two records set, but four is a big deal.
2023 marks the 14th year that the biannual charity marathon has taken place. They have two main events in the winter and summer, but they also hold smaller events throughout the year. One of these is Frost Fatales, an all-women speedrunning event, which will take place from February 26 - March 4, 2023 on Twitch. Since it was founded in 2010, the organization has raised over $43 million for charity.
AGDQ was initially set to be in person but was moved online due to COVID concerns. Their summer event, Summer Games Done Quick, will be held from May 28 - June 4, though it&#x27;s unclear whether the event will also take place in person.

MissMikaa is the streamer who last week simultaneously beat Elden Ring with a controller and a dance mat, which should give you some clue as to how he rendered canine assistance.

                              <span>Bloodborne was great, but it didn&#x27;t have any lightning gorilla robocops. This is a problem the upcoming Lies of P hopes to fix, as revealed in a new gameplay trailer designed to show off how nice it looks on a Radeon RX 7900 XTX. I will likely never own a Radeon RX 7900 XTX, but it&#x27;s looking increasingly likely that I will buy Lies of P. 
It&#x27;s a Soulslike that plonks you into an alternate Victorian London where people got real good at inventing creepy automata. You play as the big P himself, Pinocchio.

                              <span>Shang-Chi is a card in Marvel Snap that destroys any and all opposing cards in his lane with a power of 9 or above. He feels great to play, and miserable to play against. He is also, apparently, quite bad - at least according to project lead Ben Brode, who&#x27;s consulted his big statistics bank to discover that he appears in more losing decks than anyone else. 
Huh. I suppose I can stop agonising over whether he has a place in my latest Patriot deck.

It&#x27;ll be a while before all the horrors are ready, but a smaller update with clothes and haircuts is on the way soon.

Due out later this year, you play a deaf hero in search of a cure to a sinister &#x27;howling plague&#x27; that&#x27;s devastated the land around you and turned all its inhabitants into blood-thirsty beasts - and having played its first chapter last week, its combination of tight planning, grid-based shoving and limited ammo a la Into The Breach is very, very moreish indeed. Definitely one to watch for strategy game fans.

                              <span>At a time when LucasArts was cheerfully mocking rival developer Sierra&#x27;s fondness for punishing players with game overs you could trigger at the drop of a hat, Sierra themselves seemed intent to double down. In Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers, not only can the titular protagonist suffer a variety of gruesome fates if you so much as put a foot wrong, but there&#x27;s a point where you can soft-lock the entire game by failing to pick up an easily missable single snake scale from a busy crime scene — and you won&#x27;t even know you did anything wrong for several in-game days. I&#x27;m not 100% sure this wasn&#x27;t an oversight on the part of the developers, but at the same time, that&#x27;s exactly the sort of shit that Sierra liked to pull.

Stacinator has shared their efforts on YouTube and the Minecraft subreddit for all to see. I&#x27;d encourage you to have a watch of the full Minecraft Africa video, and wonder why Toto’s only other famous tune is Rosanna.

A new short film themed around Chinese New Year that&#x27;s been shared by devs Game Science Studio sees a young lagomorphic enthusiast scuppered by their out of date computer, and also shows a wee bit of Black Myth: Wukong in action too.

The EU&#x27;s antitrust watchdog is nearing the end of a 90-day probe into whether Microsoft&#x27;s buyout violates antitrust laws, and they&#x27;re reportedly about to serve up a charge sheet that lays out all their beef. As with those of the FTC and other regulators, their objections are likely to centre on the likelihood of Microsoft saddling Call Of Duty with Xbox or Gamepass exclusivity.

                              <span>Have you ever been in a relationship with somebody who surprised you in all the right ways at the beginning, but eventually frustrated and disappointed you so deeply that it all ended in a messy breakup? Farlanders is my messy breakup.
It&#x27;s a space colony city builder with a puzzle game mentality - and set on Mars to make things even more enticing. The best part of Farlanders is its story, and while it’s not quite a full-blown commentary on colonialism, it examines what you’re doing and why you’re doing it with a self-awareness that I did not expect at all. That being said, annoying difficulty curves, awkward terraforming, and frustrating progression systems stop this space colony sim from really taking off. A graph charting my enjoyment over time would look like a child’s drawing of a mountain.

                              <span>Free to play fantasy MMO RPG Lost Ark got a bit too happy with its banhammer over the weekend, with lapsed players taking to the game’s Steam page to complain that they’d been banned for no reason other than inactivity. Players, or at least former players, of Lost Ark left more than 1300 negative reviews of the game on Saturday, and more than 1000 on Sunday. They claimed they’d received bans that appeared on their Steam profile without actually logging into the game recently.

                              <span>HBO&#x27;s The Last Of Us TV adaptation is finally out on UK tellyboxes via Sky/Now TV today, and judging by early critic reviews, it&#x27;s meant to be pretty all right! You know, as video game TV shows go. I&#x27;ve yet to sit down and watch it myself, but I&#x27;ll probably be doing so this evening to see what&#x27;s what. 
A question I&#x27;ve been pondering in the run-up to The Last Of Us&#x27; TV debut, however, is this: if I watch the TV show now, will I really be bothered to actually sit down and play Part 1 when it finally comes to Steam at the beginning of March? &#x27;Cause I sure don&#x27;t have time (or the inclination) to do both. I think that might be too much The Last Of Us... But what about you, readers? Will you be tuning in, or waiting to play it on PC? Or both! Tell us in the comments below.

This week, my eye has been caught by a pleasing assortment of zippy and dramatic movements—hoverboards, airdashes, grappling hooks—but also some cute, weird, interesting, and uh I guess hypothetically erotic indies games.

By that point, volunteers will have been hammering away on Skyblivion for 13 years. If you remember what you were doing 13 years ago then you’ve got a better memory than I do. Watch the latest and rather snazzy trailer for Skyblivion below, and wonder whether Emperor Uriel Septim VII sounds more like Patrick Stewart or Sean Connery.

GDQ announced the $2.6 million figure on Twitter after the event concluded, and thanked all the runners and those who’d donated.

A number of speedruns throughout the week-long event smashed world records for their respective games and categories too, including PC runs of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge and my own personal GOTY from 2022, PowerWash Simulator. You can watch the AGDQ 2023’s record-setting No Soap PowerWash Simulator run below, and weep into your coffee at the sheer cleaning ability on display.

According to police in India, a college student was arrested last week on suspicion of monetizing pirated TV streams via the PikaShow app.

To je také důvod, proč Goodoffer24 staví Microsoft ohledně cen za Windows 10 a Office na vedlejší kolej, a tím činí proces updatdů o mnoho dostupnějším. Dokonce můžete koupit obojí naráz, čímž ušetříte ještě více. Zde je, co můžete dostat.</span>

                              <span>When it was released on January 14th 2003, SimCity 4 had its problems. Its huge cities would chug on even decent PCs, for one, and its traffic simulation seemed outright broken. 

Twenty years later - thanks to faster PCs, the Rush Hour expansion, and a huge modding community - SimCity 4 is the best of all SimCity games. If what you care about is simulation, scale, variety, and the beauty of urban sprawl, it&#x27;s also the best citybuilder.

                              <span>Against The Storm provided some of the most fun I had playing a citybuilder last year. That was in part because, despite being set in a dark fantasy world in which you must satisfy an unyielding Queen, and despite being in early access, it&#x27;s remarkably graspable. It&#x27;s the kind of citybuilder where, if you place a building in the wrong place, it simply lets you pick it up and move it at no cost.

As of its latest update, there&#x27;s now a new customisable game mode that lets you make your expeditions even more relaxed - or much harder.

                              <span>Google Stadia will close its doors on January 18th. As a parting gift, Google have released the game they built to test the streaming service before the streaming service launched. &quot;Worm Game&quot; is a version of Snake with plenty of levels and modes to try and, of course, it&#x27;s playable within your browser.

To recap, this headset launched in late 2021, comes with 2.4GHz &quot;Lightspeed&quot; wireless and Bluetooth, with a lightweight design and in a range of colours - so $30 is an incredible price.

We haven&#x27;t seen hide nor genetically modified pig tail of it since 2018, but rest assured, it lives. 
That&#x27;s despite the most recent swing of Ubisoft&#x27;s game-cancelling scythe, which was brought down on three unannounced games last week due to the company&#x27;s underperforming sales.

                              <span>Desktop Dungeons is a morish puzzle game from 2010 that channels conventional dungeoning into fiendish headscratching. Every enemy sits still, waiting for you to come and whack it. Whack willy-nilly, though, and they&#x27;ll kill you in no time - so you have to tactically explore parts of each level to heal, while targeting foes in an order that lets you survive long enough to level up and take on the big bads. 
Desktop Dungeons: Rewind is an upcoming &quot;modern remastering&quot; of the original, with 3D graphics and the ability to rewind time rather than start each level from the very beginning. It&#x27;s got a demo you can play right now, and it&#x27;s adding free daily challenges with a sharable leaderboard later this month. I am hyped.

                              <span>Make no bones about it: Ubisoft&#x27;s perennially delayed Skull &amp; Bones is still coming. A new developer video proves that, offering a fresh look at some sumptuous seas during a hunt for an Ungwanan renegade. The most interesting part of Skull &amp; Bones is still its tortured history, with a recent sixth delay pushing it even further back from the original 2018 release date - but oh, maybe I do want to be a boat after all. At least for a bit.

                              <span>When The Anacrusis launched into early access in January 2022, its retrofuturist take on the co-op FPS instantly delivered on funky sci-fi fun. Yet it was also tempered fun: a brutal AI Director could easily tip manageable chaos into a fatiguing onslaught of fishy alien minibosses, and I still remember my will to persevere being sapped by connectivity issues and a general lack of weight to the otherwise enticing pew-pew gunplay.


Happily, following a year of tweaks and additions, The Anacrusis is in a much better place. Even if that place is still turtleneck-deep in extraterrestrial viscera. Ahead of the game’s first anniversary, I poked developers Stray Bombay for a chat on how their early access approach is working out, the impact of long-awaited mod tools, and what’s next for this most stylish of space shooters.

                              <span>I&#x27;m playing Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla right now, and it&#x27;s too bloody big. This is my second stint, jumping back in after playing for 14 hours when it came out in 2020 then abandoning it - and I&#x27;m beginning to remember why. It&#x27;s a pretty but largely empty-feeling time, with woefully repetitive mission design and characters I only have a passive interest in. It&#x27;s good, therefore, to see Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage creative director Stéphane Boudon make more noises about how the next Creed game will be smaller and &quot;more intimate&quot;.

Retro platformers are not hard to come by. I count myself among the group of video game players who welcome efforts from small development teams that play to our nostalgia for an era where playing video games meant tuning to channel 3. Some are fantastic, some are too hard to be enjoyable, but most land somewhere in the middle. Vengeful Guardian: Moonrider won’t go down in history as one of the greats that both embraces the past and modernizes the action, but I would place it closer to the fantastic side of the scale, even if it doesn’…</span>

                              <span>Our resident community engagement guru and all-round Raspberry Pi-powered DIY home hack enthusiast Matt Richardson does not like venturing outside to check whether he remembered to close his garage door. So he cobbled something together from a couple of Raspberry Pi Pico Ws and some sensors to check for him. No one wants to hang […]

                              <span>Your regular host, Alex Van Aken, is out on a mysterious project this week so guest host Kyle Hilliard is back to throw out the format and talk entirely too much about anime. The discussion is timely, though, as the big release of the week is One Piece Odyssey, Bandai Namco&#x27;s impressive RPG based on the popular anime. John Carson, who is reviewing the game for Game Informer, returns to talk about his experience and share his favorite games of 2022. We are also joined by former Game Informer editor and former host of this very podcast, Benjamin Reeves! Reeves makes his triumphant return to The Game Informer Show to also share his favorite games of 2022 and, alongside Wesley LeBlanc, reveal just how little they know about One Piece with our Devil Fruit quiz.

                              <span>Developer Scavengers Studio revealed last month that it was releasing Season: A Letter To The Future on January 31, and now, just a few weeks ahead of that, the studio has released a gorgeous new story trailer. 
This new trailer provides yet another beautiful glimpse into the painterly world of Season while providing new details about what our protagonist is doing: archiving the end of the Earth and the final people still living on it. She strives to capture their final moments in her journal and with her camera, aiming to learn why they&#x27;re still around and ultimately, what kept them going. It sounds like quite the emotional journey.

                              <span>Developer Motive Studio and publisher EA have released a new story trailer for its upcoming remake of Dead Space, and the game continues to look terrifying and beautiful. 
Due out on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC later this month on January 27, this might be one of our last looks at the remake before it&#x27;s in the hands of players. Fortunately, this new trailer is nearly two minutes of cinematics and gameplay from the remake focused on the story of Dead Space. As expected, this remake isn&#x27;t changing much at all, utilizing the same story from the original 2008 release with updated visuals and audio (plus some new voice lines for protagonist Isaac Clarke). 
Check out the new Dead Space Remake &quot;Humanity Ends Here&quot; trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Dead Space Remake continues to look great and we can&#x27;t wait to play it in just a few weeks.

Marvel Snap has been a resounding success since its release, allowing players to compete against other real-world players with a variety of cards, random locations, and more. Despite the positive reception, one thing players have been asking for has been missing: the ability to play against your friends. Developer Second Dinner announced in November that it was working on an update to allow friends to battle each other and now, it has announced that this update is expected at the end of the month. 
More specifically, the update is expected in a January 31 update, but Second Dinner says if it runs &quot;into any last minutes issues, we may choose to delay for a little longer t…</span>

Lack of access is cited as the prime reason but, worryingly, many researchers also find shadow libraries easier to use than legal alternatives.

The important thing is it feels good to play and is incredibly reminiscent of the 16-bit era of video games in the best way.

As for what to expect for each game, Xbox has detailed that too. For The Elder Scrolls Online, ZeniMax Online Studios will unveil 2023&#x27;s major chapter update, &quot;including the latest regions of Tamriel to become playable in ESO, as well as a major new feature coming in the game&#x27;s biggest update this year.&quot; A full &quot;ESO Chapter Reveal Event&quot; will follow this Developer Direct.

                              <span>Final Fantasy XVI is due out June 22 exclusively on PlayStation 5, but some fans believe a PC version of the game could release as soon as six months after its console debut. However, FF16 producer Naoki Yoshida isn&#x27;t sure why. 
During a recent Final Fantasy XIV stream, Yoshida, who is a director on that game, was asked about rumors surrounding a PC version of FF16, and he responded, &quot;I don&#x27;t know where the notion of a PC version releasing six months after the game is out came from as none of us have ever said that,&quot; according to a translator, as reported by Eurogamer. He followed it up with two instances urging fans to buy the PS5 version. 
According to a translation by Siliconera, Yoshida also said, &quot;There&#x27;s been talk that the PC version will come out, but no one on the team has said anything about the PC version. I wonder why people assume the PC version will arrive six months after [the PS5 version], so just go ahead and buy a PS5.&quot; 
The talk of a PC version of the game stems from a promotional PlayStation 5 video released last year that says in small print that FF16 will be a &quot;PS5 exclusive for six months.&quot; Some extrapolated from this small print that a PC release of the game will come after that six months of exclusivity is up, but if Yoshida&#x27;s recent comments are any indication, the team has nothing to say in regards to a PC version. 
Final Fantasy XVI hits PlayStation 5 on June 22. While waiting for more information, watch this &quot;Ambition&quot; trailer that reveals more about Valisthea&#x27;s kingdoms, dominants, and eikons, and then check out our interview with Yoshida about the game&#x27;s boss fights.

                              <span>The original Dead Island 2 reveal trailer is now an iconic (perhaps infamous) moment in games. It was a great trailer, people were excited, and then fast forward nearly a decade later, and the game is still in development.  
First revealed back in 2014, Dead Island 2 was in development at Spec Ops: The Line developer Yager, with Dead Island developer Techland having parted ways with the property to work on Dying Light. Publisher Deep Silver handed over development of the game to LittleBigPlanet 3 developer Sumo Digital in 2016, and then, in 2019, the company announced that Homefront: The Revolution developer Dambuster Studios would be developing Dead Island 2. It&#x27;s now 2023 and Dambuster&#x27;s Dead Island 2 is due out in April, finally.

                              <span>These days, box offices are dominated by comic-book and superhero movies from Marvel and DC. Unfortunately, while superhero movies have improved dramatically over the last decade, superheroes haven’t been as powerful in the realm of video games. In fact, nearly 40 years after the first superhero video game, many developers still struggle to create worthwhile experiences using some of the biggest names in entertainment today.
While not all superhero games are monumental duds like Superman on Nintendo 64, many tend to deliver middling, forgettable experiences. However, a select few that defy the stereotype to become superb titles we still look back on fondly as not only great superhero games, but terrific video games in their own rights.

                              <span>Weapon durability and its application in games have long been hot topics amongst players. Some love it, some are fine with it, and others hate it. And those feelings vary depending on who you are talking to about this topic. I think of games like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild when someone brings up weapon durability, as it was a hotly debated aspect of its release (I didn&#x27;t mind it at all, personally). 
Love it or hate it, weapon durability is a feature that will likely never go away in games, and that&#x27;s okay because when it&#x27;s done right, it can be a helpful way to push players toward something new. In 2011&#x27;s Dead Island, weapon durability was a big part of the experience, and that feature will return in Dead Island 2 when it hits PlayStation and Xbox consoles, and PC, on April 2…</span>

                              <span>Don&#x27;t expect The Last of Us HBO show to extend beyond the story of the two games in the series. That&#x27;s because The Last of Us game director Neil Druckmann says there are no plans for stories beyond the games in this show.
This news comes by way of a new interview with Druckmann from The Hollywood Reporter, as reported by GameSpot. Here&#x27;s what Druckmann told THR specifically: &quot;We have no plans to tell any stories beyond adapting the games. We won&#x27;t run into the same issue as Game of Thrones since The Last of Us Part: II doesn&#x27;t end on a cliffhanger.&quot; 


Druckmann and TV series writer Craig Mazin have mentioned that a second season of this show might cover the events of The Last of Us Part II (personally, I think The Last of Us Part II could cover two seasons of television). Despite the duo not wanting the show to go beyond the games, there might be a way for the show to cover more ground after the events of The Last of Us Part II. If Naughty Dog were to develop a theoretical The Last of Us Part III, it wouldn&#x27;t be surprising if the HBO show covered that down the road. Chances seem pretty good considering Druckmann told THR that there is &quot;more story to tell&quot; in the world of The Last of Us games. 
Mazin also touched on his desire not to extend the show beyond the games in the THR interview, as noted by GameSpot, stating that he doesn&#x27;t &quot;have any interest in a spinning-plates-go-on-forever show.&quot; 
&quot;When it becomes a perpetual motion machine, it just can&#x27;t help but get kind of...stupid,&quot; he continued. &quot;Endings mean everything to me.&quot; 
For more about The Last of Us on HBO, read our interview with Joel actor Pedro Pascal and Druckmann about the changes made for this TV show. Check out this new piece of concept art from The Last of Us multiplayer game that Naughty Dog is currently developing after that.

                              <span>The Last of Us is not the first adaptation from video game to film and it certainly won’t be the last. But perhaps more than any property that has moved from interactive medium to passive television, The Last of Us seems most suited to make the transition. Joel and Ellie’s story is an emotional and cinematic one that does not rely on player choice.
Ahead of the show’s premiere we spoke with some of the actors about the adaptation, as well as Neil Druckmann, co-creator of The Last of Us, who was heavily involved in writing the show and directed a few episodes.
Druckmann is no stranger to directing actors, even if the recording process of a TV show is different from how it works in a video game. “There is a certain luxury we have in video games that when we capture a performance, we have eve…</span>

                              <span>What do you get when you blend Mega Man X, Ninja Gaiden, and Bionic Commando? You get Gravity Circuit, a promising indie action title launching later this year. 
Players control Kai, a lone warrior battling an evil robotic army in a post-apocalyptic world. This side-scrolling action title boasts plenty of satisfying action thanks to Kai’s fun melee combat, nimble platforming abilities, and his signature grappling hook, which he uses to traverse levels as well as yank and toss enemies. Sporting great 16-bit art and a strong soundtrack, Gravity Circuit is worth keeping an eye on for fans of classic throwbacks. 
Join editors Wesley LeBlanc and Marcus Stewart as they explore Gravity Circuit’s free Steam demo and discuss why it may be one of the year’s most exciting indie gems.

Many JRPGs have slow openings, taking their time to establish the story and familiarize the player with the mechanics before letting them loose into the world. I figured that was the case after playing an hour of Dragon Quest Treasures, so I said to myself, “It’ll get good soon!” I said it again two hours in, three hours in, and five hours in, until eventually, I was forced to accept that this was as good as the game would get. Dragon Quest Treasures is never short on charm or style, but simple, sub-par combat and loot-hunting mechanics had me scraping the bo…</span>

                              <span>Sony released a sneak peek of its upcoming Gran Turismo movie yesterday evening during its CES 2023 press conference, and as expected, it features a lot of fast vehicles. 
Starring David Harbour (Stranger Things), Orlando Bloom (Pirates of the Caribbean, The Lord of the Rings), and David Barnet (Never Have I Ever), and directed by Neil Blomkamp (District 9, Elysium, Chappie), Gran Turismo is based on a true story. That story is about the GT Academy contest, which was a real contest held between 2008 and 2016 by Sony and Nissan. Winners were given entrance into Nissan&#x27;s Driver Development Program, as noted by Video Games Chronicle. The film appears to be telling the tale of someone who won entrance into this program and then went on to become a real success in the racing world. 
Check out the Gran Turismo sneak peek for yourself below: 


As you can see, this sneak peek is a mix of what appears to be movie footage and behind-the-scenes footage, with stars like Harbour, Barnet, and Bloom talking about their excitement for the film. 
Gran Turismo hits theaters later this year on August 11. 
Alongside this sneak peek, Sony also revealed that Gran Turismo 7, the latest in the long-running series released last year, will be getting an update that makes the game playable on its upcoming PSVR2 platform. 
While waiting to learn more about this Gran Turismo movie, read about Project Leonardo, a new customizable accessibility controller kit PlayStation unveiled yesterday and then read about how the PlayStation 5 has surpassed 30 million units sold.

I had always observed the Fire Emblem series from a distance, worried its strategy gameplay wouldn’t be for me or stressed determining where best to start and how to play through the franchise’s various entries. Fire Emblem Three Houses was the first I gave a good try and 80-plus hours later, it’s one of my favorite games on Switch and turned me into a Fire Emblem fan. Since its reveal, I’ve looked at Fire Emblem Engage as a test bed: am I actually a Fire Emblem fan, or did I just really like Three Houses and its engaging Hogwarts-like school mechanics? If the 10 hours I’ve put into Engage so far are any indication, I’m happy to say it’s the former. 
Engage isn’t…</span>

                              <span>Sony Interactive Entertainment has revealed that it has sold more than 30 million PlayStation 5 units since the console&#x27;s launch in 2020. 
This news comes by way of the company&#x27;s recent CES 2023 appearance, where PlayStation CEO Jim Ryan revealed these numbers alongside words that seem to indicate the PS5 shortage might be over, or at least coming to an end soon. PlayStation also touched on its upcoming PSVR2 release and accompanying 30-plus game lineup, and pulled back the curtains on its new customizable accessibility controller kit, Project Leonardo. 
As you can see, it seems Ryan and PlayStation are confident in the supply of PS5 consoles around the world. If you&#x27;re still on the lookout for one, it seems now is the time to start searching retail stores again.

                              <span>The Last of Us turns 10 years old in June, and Naughty Dog plans to celebrate the milestone with an array of special announcements along the way. One of those updates involves a closer look at the upcoming standalone multiplayer title.
In a blog post, Naughty Dog co-president Neil Druckmann reflects on The Last of Us’ legacy as well as the franchise’s future. In addition to the HBO adaptation premiering on January 15 and the PC port of The Last of Us Part 1 hitting in March, Druckmann states fans will learn more about the long-awaited multiplayer experience that serves as a follow-up to the original game’s Factions mode. Druckmann writes,
“We’ll have some fun surprises for you along the way, but later this year we will begin to offer you some details on our ambitious The Last of Us multiplayer game. With a team led by Vinit Agarwal, Joe Pettinati, and Anthony Newman, the project is shaping up to be a fresh, new experience from our studio, but one rooted in Naughty Dog’s passion for delivering incredible stories, characters, and gameplay.”
Naughty Dog also shares a new piece of concept art, posted in full below, which is the first new material of the game since it released the first concept asset last June. It depicts two survivors heading toward a dilapidated cruise ship. 
Though we’ll be learning more about the game this year, it’s still unknown if Naughty Dog plans to launch it in 2023. That would be fitting given the anniversary, but we&#x27;ll have to wait and see over the coming months. Until then, be sure to check out this feature on how The Last of Us Part 1 proves there&#x27;s no such thing as a faithful remake.</span>

Double-click on her door to open it, and step inside. Riddenbutter works the bar, and the smart traveler should speak with her. Drop an idea on her to get her chatting. Like most people, she likes to talk about this and that and the other thing, and she’ll also frequently respond with information that’s more local in nature.
Yes, the ScummVM team announces support for Halls of the Dead: Faery Tale Adventure II, a marvellous work by our GSoC’21 student Yuri Guimaraes aka a-yyg, who ported the original SAGA2 engine from 1997 by The Dreamers Guild.
Please assist us with testing this game. Take your old dusty CD and feed it to the ScummVM. As usual, you will need the latest daily build of ScummVM. If you encounter any bugs or problems during your gameplay, please file them on our issue tracker.

Especially notable are the new vehicle variants feature for NewGRFs and automatic flipping support for shorten-than-default NewGRF-defined vehicles.
