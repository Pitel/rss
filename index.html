                    <span>Happy new year! Season 2 of Game Informer&#x27;s Video Gameography podcast examines one of the biggest shooter franchises in existence: Halo. This week, we unpack Bungie&#x27;s epic conclusion to Master Chief&#x27;s original trilogy of adventures: Halo 3.
Released with all the hype in the world on September 25, 2007, Halo 3 served as both the pinnacle of the series as well as its supposed swan song for Master Chief. Using the now iconic tagline &quot;finish the fight,&quot; Bungie created Halo 3 under the agreement that it would part ways with Microsoft after a new set of Halo games. The third game was the first of this batch, and its creation suffered from internal studio conflicts, including creative heads walking out mid-development. How did Bungie cope with matching Halo 2&#x27;s quality, migrating to a new platform in the Xbox 360, and delivering a conclusion that lived up to expectations? Tune in to find out. 
Join hosts Ben Reeves (@BenjaminReeves), Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), and Game Informer video editor Alex Stadnik (@Studnik76) as we unpack the history and impact of Master Chief&#x27;s grand sequel. And for more Halo, be sure to check out our definitive ranking of every Halo game.

                    <span>You see that mountain?...
Updated with new additions. Enjoy!

You see that mountain on the horizon? You can go there! That old gaming chestnut has been around for a long time now, but for old-school gamers who remember the compartmentalised kingdoms of yore, there&#x27;s a special magic still to be derived from being able to trek your way to a distant summit. Video games, eh? Marvellous.

                    <span>Alastair Low explains 8-bit love and how he&#x27;s making games more dyslexia-friendly.
Over the holidays we&#x27;re republishing some of our best features, interviews, opinion pieces and talking points from the previous 12 months from staff and contributors alike — articles that we feel represent our best of 2021. In them you&#x27;ll find our usual mix of thoughtfulness, frivolity, retro expertise, gaming nostalgia, and — of course — enthusiasm for all things Nintendo. Enjoy!

Alastair Low hadn’t even been born when the NES was originally released in the UK. But he spent much of his childhood joyously playing on Nintendo’s 8-bit wonder machine after picking one up for a pittance at a car boot sale in the mid-1990s. “I remember getting a NES with R.O.B. and the gun for three pounds in the box,” he says. “Bloody amazing back then.” Although the console was far from current, he adored the machine. But when he upgraded to a Super NES, he encountered some problems.

Most fans would agree that Nintendo’s current eShop for Switch could use some work. Sure, it serves its purpose well from a purely transactional standpoint, but there are some glaring issues at the heart of it. The layout makes it difficult to just casually browse and find interesting new titles. User reviews used to be a feature, until Nintendo decided the eShop was better off without them. Worst of all, there’s no catchy music. The company has never been completely on the ball with its online offerings, but even given the fact that the sheer number of games on the system are bound to create discoverability issues, it would be difficult to argue that its latest iteration of the eShop is also its greatest.

                    <span>Our most anticipated games of 2022.
Note. We published this revised list of upcoming Switch games over Christmas, but now we&#x27;re actually here in 2022, we thought it was worth taking another look at what&#x27;s coming over the horizon on Nintendo&#x27;s console. Enjoy!

The new year is here, bringing the promise of new video games to one and all. We&#x27;ve have seen some fantastic games on Switch in 2021, but it&#x27;s also true that several big names slipped into 2022 — for understandable reasons. Add those to the Switch games previously scheduled to arrive in the next 12 months and this year is already shaping up very nicely!

Nintendo already has a number of high profile games lined up for Switch in 2022, and when you add third-parties to the mix it&#x27;s looking very exciting indeed.

It looks like Rare&#x27;s seminal N64 shooter GoldenEye 007 is finally getting a digital re-release - but sadly not on a Nintendo system.
True Achievements has picked up a new achievement list for the game, with 55 achievements adding up to a 1000 gamerscore.

                    <span>The future has arrived, still waiting on hoverboards.
Welcome to the future! Yes, we&#x27;ve finally got through &#x27;2020: Part Deux&#x27; and we&#x27;re now securely lodged in 2022 — the first year since the millennium that has three of the same number in it. *Waits for everyone to confirm that that is indeed correct*...
The past year has been another tough one for a great many people due to one thing and another (and another, and another). Restrictions designed to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and the Omicron variant are either already in place or will arrive imminently in many countries across the globe, and it&#x27;s clear that it may be a long time yet until things return to relative normality.

                    <span>2021 was hot boy summer for detectives. Well, not summer. Hot boy autumn? Is that a thing? Anyway, I not only played Sherlock Holmes Chapter One, but also an incarnation of Hercule Poirot as a bright young thing in Agatha Christie - Hercule Poirot: The First Cases. And yes, that name is a bit of a nightmare, but the game itself is very sweet. There&#x27;s &#x27;orrible murder, conspiracy, blackmail, union busting, and a cast of Cluedo-esque characters trapped inside a snowy manor. And yes, I am reusing the shoddy Love Island promo photo composite I made for a header picture, because it deserves the mileage.

                    <span>It’s time to put 2021 in the rearview mirror and look forward to the new year. For most of us, that means thinking about how to make 2022 an even better year than the last with some New Year’s resolutions. Every year when this time rolls around, I make big plans. And while I resolve to better myself and start up good habits with the best of intentions, I notice they start to break down as the months go on. So this year, I’m bringing in a little backup: video games.
It’s Time To Get Healthy
Like many people, my first resolution every year is to be a little healthier after the indulgent past few weeks. Despite video games being a mostly sedentary hobby, there are a handful of titles that can help keep this goal from fizzling out. First, I’m turning to Ring Fit Adventure. Sure, there are a to…</span>

                    <span>There are decent Halo Infinite players, really great players, ranked Onyx players, and then there’s Remy “Mint Blitz,” an Australian streamer who won more than 100 free-for-all matches in a row. 
First reported by Kotaku, Mint Blitz originally set out to win 50 consecutive free-for-all matches in the recently-released (and free-to-play) multiplayer portion of Halo Infinite. After winning 50 in a row, though, he upped the ante and sought to win 100 consecutive matches…and he did it. In fact, he continued on to win even more, finally breaking the streak around “105, 106 straight” wins.

                    <span>SaGa series creator Akitoshi Kawazu has revealed that a remake, remaster, and a new game might be on the way. 
First reported by Kotaku, Kawazu tweeted yesterday to thank SaGa fans for their support in 2021, teasing what 2022 might hold. According to Google’s translation service, Kawazu’s tweet also reveals some exciting game developments in the works. 
#サガシリーズ #2021年 もファンの皆さんに支えられて過ごす事が出来ました。有難うございます。#2022年 も応援していただけるように、様々なことに取り組んでいきます。運営サービスだけでなく、リマスター、リメイク、そして新作の制作も進行させ、皆さんに良いニュースを届けられるよう頑張ります。

“We will work on various things so that 2022 can also be supported,” Google’s translation of Kawazu’s tweet reads. “We will do our best not only to manage the service but also to remaster, remake, and produce new works so that we can deliver good news to everyone.”

                    <span>Update, 12/31/21:
PlayStation announced earlier this week that Deep Rock Galactic, as well as Persona 5 Strikers and Dirt 5, will be the January 2022 PlayStation Plus titles, and now, new details about one of the games have been released. 
As first reported by VG247, Deep Rock Galactic will contain some PlayStation 5-exclusive features thanks to the console&#x27;s DualSense controller. More specifically, the DualSense touchpad can be used to control the Terrain Scanner in-game. Plus, the controller&#x27;s built-in speaker can be used by characters to tell you orders as if said characters are actually using a radio to communicate with you, as one might do when mining deep into an alien planet&#x27;s terrain.

                    <span>Xbox’s flagship title makes its triumphant return, touting a resounding, deeply personal narrative arc for the Master Chief alongside popular PvP modes that appeal to Spartan veterans and novices alike. Simply put, Infinite is the total package; a love letter to the original trilogy that helped define the shooter genre. Gone are the overly complicated plot points, invasive loot box rewards, and ability kit-focused metas. 343 Industries’ latest installment is a lesson on finding balance in simple storytelling and leveling the competitive playing field. It’s also a revolutionary step that’ll undoubtedly inform the next generation of Halo projects. Read more...</span>

                    <span>This year was a great one for Koei Tecmo, which was behind several releases by way of either development or publishing, but the studio is teeing up 2022 to be even better. 
First reported and translated by Twinfinite, Japanese website 4Gamer published an article about 2022 plans for local game developers, including Koei Tecmo. In it, Koei Tecmo’s entertainment division general manager, Yosuki Hayashi, says the studio will reveal several games that have been in the works for years in 2022, stating that these titles “will pave the way for the future of the company,” Twinfinite writes.

Hayashi says the “full power of the current Koei Tecmo” will be shown in 2022 and that the year will mark the release of several games developed by the studio. As for what, Team Ninja director Fumihiko Yasuda said fans can look forward to future titles such as an action game set in the Three Kingdom era and another game that he’s actually directing. 
Finally, Fatal Frame producer Yosuke Kikuchi said that in 2022, “his team will challenge the development of something that they have never done before,” according to Twinfinite’s translation and that while it will be a long time before it’s formally announced, the studio is excited to get started. 
Perhaps 2022 will bring a new Nioh game to consoles and PC, or maybe even a new Fatal Frame, especially since the last one was released in 2015. Check out our thoughts on it in Game Informer’s Fatal Frame: Maiden of Black Water review and then read Game Informer’s Nioh 2 review after that.

                    <span>As a fan of the film Battle Royale and The Hunger Games books (the movies are fine too), I’m surprised the battle royale genre hasn’t permanently sunk its teeth into me. Don’t get me wrong; I’ve enjoyed my time with Fortnite and Apex Legends, the two titles I’ve dabbled with the most. They’re well-crafted games. But each of them also occupies the same niche being shooters. I’m itching for more creative spins on the formula. 
The recently announced Rumbleverse, a pro wrestling flavored take on the genre, tickles my fancy as a long-time fan of sports entertainment. But I’m selfish, so give me more battle royales based on my specific interests. If you’ve listened to me on podcasts or watched me on streams, you probably know I’m a big Yu-Gi-Oh fan as well.

                    <span>Remakes and remasters continue to become more common with each passing year and as Mortal Kombat has reached 11 mainline entries, some fans are looking back at the series’ history, especially as its 30th anniversary nears. 
If it was up to Eyeballistic, a game development studio with multiple titles in the works, that 30th anniversary would include a remake of the original Mortal Kombat trilogy. In fact, the studio has created a “Mortal Kombat Trilogy Remake Petition” on change.org to get this theoretical ball rolling, as first reported by Nintendo Life.

This news comes by way of a new post made by Ziegler on the official Riot website, in which he discusses his last eight years there.

                    <span>Cobra Kai returns to Netflix for a fourth season tomorrow. The runaway hit show is based on The Karate Kid films of yesteryear, and even rekindles the feud between Daniel LaRusso (played by Ralph Macchio) and Johnny Lawrence (William Zabka). We recently had the chance to play a mildly amusing Cobra Kai video game from developer Flux, and now we can show our love for the show with new skins in Fortnite.
Sadly none of the characters from the Netflix show are represented in likeness, but their schools are. This means you can suit up as generic characters in the styles of Cobra Kai, Eagle Fang, and Miyagi-Do. Each character you purchase for 800 V-Bucks can change to any of the three schools. You have a variety to pick from, such as Shuto Striker, Mat Master, Keri Commander, Kata Captain, Dojo Defender, and more. You can get five styles in the Karate Ko Bundle, and another five in the Dojo Showdown Bundle. Both sell for 2,000 V-Bucks.
Strike first. Strike hard. No mercy.

The only recognizable character is Agent Jones, who, like the other characters, can switch between dojos. He retails for 800 V-Bucks.
The best item offered is The Crane Kick emote that plays a clip from Joe Esposito&#x27;s song &quot;You&#x27;re The Best Around.&quot; This item will set you back 300 V-Bucks, or you can get it in a bundle with The Teachings of Miyagi back bling, Cobra Coin back bling, Dojo Logo harvesting tool, and Cobra&#x27;s Curse harvesting tool. That bundle is 1,500 V-Bucks.
The Fortnite store has also been updated today with a variety of 2022-themed items, with many festive characters returning for New Year&#x27;s celebration.</span>

Two years have passed since Pokémon Sword and Shield inaugurated the eighth generation of Pokémon games. With it came indignation from some fans, though most agreed Sword and Shield didn’t flounder when it came to its competitive scene.

                    <span>Don&#x27;t forget your auld acquaintance.
It&#x27;s a well-known fact that New Year&#x27;s Eve parties are usually a bit rubbish. Aside from the occasional rockin&#x27; house party or swish &#x27;n&#x27; swinging shindig, they often turn out to be expensive and disappointing evenings that lead to you starting the new year not refreshed and optimistic, but with a thick head and a lot of dry cleaning to attend to.
So why not stay at home with your Switch and see in the new year with Animal Crossing: New Horizons instead? Get your friends over and make a night of it! Or settle down solo — we ain&#x27;t judging.

                    <span>We&#x27;ve got a latte questions.
Over the holidays we&#x27;re republishing some of our best features, interviews, opinion pieces and talking points from the previous 12 months from staff and contributors alike — articles that we feel represent our best of 2021. In them you&#x27;ll find our usual mix of thoughtfulness, frivolity, retro expertise, gaming nostalgia, and — of course — enthusiasm for all things Nintendo. Enjoy!

Brewster is finally coming to Animal Crossing: New Horizons, and we&#x27;re going to find out more about everyone&#x27;s favourite coffee-loving winged beast on Friday the 15th October — which is Brewster&#x27;s birthday, don&#x27;tcha know. Players have been asking about/demanding Brewster for ages, like that one clip from The Mandalorian where Werner Herzog says &quot;I would like to see the baby&quot;, only instead of &quot;baby&quot;, it&#x27;s &quot;adult bird barista&quot;.

                    <span>Fun for the whole family over the holidays.
Nintendo&#x27;s Switch is the perfect console for co-op multiplayer gaming and certainly goes down a treat at a party, but if you want to play games with your young kids and granny and granddad, it can be tough to find games that are genuinely fun for everyone involved. We know from personal experience the delicate balance of holding a child&#x27;s interest that often comes at the expense of your own. Letting them win to avoid tears (or, perhaps worse, the dreaded &quot;I&#x27;m bored&quot;) is fine, but it would be nice if we could share in the fun, too.
Well, thankfully there is a better way with Switch. When it comes to family gaming — especially over the festive period — there really is no better console available, and here we&#x27;ve picked out the best family games on Nintendo Switch. These are games which offer a great balance of fun and accessibility to help everyone enjoy themselves, not just the kids.

                    <span>Six games available on Switch make the cut.
Revered gaming mag EDGE has revealed its top 10 games of 2021 in the latest issue, and while Sony and Microsoft fans will be delighted to see platform exclusives from both PS5 and Xbox consoles put in an appearance, no Nintendo-developed or published games managed to make the list this year.
That&#x27;s not to say Switch doesn&#x27;t feature, of course. Six of the games in the top 10 are available on Nintendo&#x27;s console in some form, with Capcom&#x27;s excellent Monster Hunter Rise being a platform exclusive, no less (well, until 12th January when it&#x27;s scheduled for launch on PC) — but first-party Nintendo titles are absent from the publication&#x27;s GOTY selection this year.

Update: Just a note to remind you that Nintendo of America&#x27;s festive Indie World sale is wrapping up this evening just before midnight in the very last moments of 2021 — or earlier if you&#x27;re east of the PT zone. Make sure you grab anything you&#x27;ve had your eye on beforehand!
(Mind you, Nintendo of Europe launched a New Year Sale right after its Festive Sale finished, so North American readers may not have as long to wait for the next one as you&#x27;d think!)

                    <span>It sure was a year.

The year is drawing to a close, and 2021 was another interesting period in the broader gaming industry and in the world of Nintendo. There were big online events, fantastic games, controversies and of course some enjoyable and humorous times. It was also, by most metrics and with consideration for the various challenges it faced, a strong year for Nintendo.

As we close out 2021 and look forward to 2022 — with all the measurable improvements it surely must bring — your favourite trio of video producers are back with the last entry in their &#x27;Best Worst&#x27; Switch games trilogy.
Yes, it&#x27;s time for the third and final pick of a Switch game which may be a disappointment in the larger scheme of things, but which contains enough good bits to evoke some happy memories. After all, not everything in a 5/10 game is totally &#x27;Average&#x27;, and our intrepid video team have been digging through their back catalogues and minds for middling games which still managed to make a good impression, if only in part.

                    <span>The series turns 20 in 2024.
As is traditional for this time of year, Japanese publication Famitsu has been asking prominent developers what their plans and ambitions are for 2022, and one of the people interviewed is Capcom’ s Ryozo Tsujimoto – the man in charge of the company&#x27;s prestigious Monster Hunter franchise.
Tsujimoto Is clearly focused on delivering Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak, the next DLC offering for the most recent entry in the series, but he adds that there&#x27;s a big anniversary coming up soon, and that he will have to devote some of next year to prepare for it:

Seems like only yesterday that Nintendo was wrapping up its Festive Sale... because it was only yesterday. Yes, as one sale closes, another one opens — there&#x27;s a New Year sale live now on Switch eShop with discounts on a whole bunch of games (including things like Mario Golf: Super Rush, Fire Emblem: Three Houses, and Disco Elysium) and a focus on &quot;fun multiplayer titles&quot;. Which is nice. Better than highlighting the dull ones.
Once again there are discounts of up to 75% on various titles, some of them rather good. A quick look at the EU eShop shows a mere 2869(!) games on some form of sale at the time of writing, although not all of those are part of this promotion.

Video game companies around the globe have been preparing for 2022 for some time now, and it includes Koei Tecmo.
In an end-of-year 4Gamer feature, the Japanese company teased what&#x27;s to come in the new year. Apparently, it intends to reveal a number of projects that have been in development for several years and will pave the way for the company&#x27;s future. One additional promise was that they would display the &quot;full power of the current Koei Tecmo&quot;.

If you&#x27;ve dreamed of a Mortal Kombat Trilogy Remake on Nintendo Switch, you might want to check out Eyeballistic&#x27;s petition.
This same team approached series co-creator Ed Boon back in 2016 with Mortal Kombat HD. While he was all for it, Warner Bros. (the Mortal Kombat IP owner) didn&#x27;t have quite as much faith in the project and supposedly wasn&#x27;t convinced the game would sell over 100,000 units worldwide.

Easily one of the best Nintendo-related mods we&#x27;ve seen in 2021 is The Legend of Zelda: Second Wind - A Breath of the Wild Expansion. It&#x27;s a &quot;free large-scale DLC&quot; mod that adds new quests, areas, weapons, NPCs and enemies, and overhauls existing content.
It&#x27;s been getting updates all year, and now Breath of the Wild modder Waikuteru has shared a look at a &quot;brand-new&quot; update that features a Hinox King boss battle. This enemy can be located within a new map area called &#x27;Abandoned Mine&#x27;. It&#x27;s one of the 12 bosses tied to the &#x27;Labours of the Hero&#x27; quest, where you&#x27;ll be rewarded with an unbreakable Hylian Shield.

Podporovány jsou balíčkovače gradle, maven a bundle.  K tomu budou prohledány soubory .jar a .gem. Log4jDetect funguje na Linuxu, macOS i Windows.</span>

While many took the occasion of his passing to celebrate the man’s coaching, broadcasting, and video game legacy, others used it as an opportunity to call Madden out for his part in turning “brain injuries into a video game.” The takes were…

                    <span>Demon’s Souls started it all. Sure, folks will argue that the concepts that would go on to become the modern-day Soulslike started even earlier in From Software’s history with games like Shadow Tower or the King’s Field games. But the modern incarnations feature challenging action/RPGs that offer battles with larger-than-life bosses, risk/reward offerings, mysteries to explore, and tight combat mechanics that force the player to commit to their choices. 
For the purposes of this list, I’m acknowledging that Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice has plenty of Soulslike framework, but due to some significant differences in player development and build options, it’s being left out of consideration here as a Soulslike. That said, it’s a great game and you should give it a try if you haven’t already. Alrig…</span>

                    <span>It&#x27;s the end of the year, and Steam is running down the games the most people played in 2021. To check out the entire expansive list, click the link here. Read below for some of the most surprising games Steam players invested their time into. 
Starting out, news games like Valheim, New World, and the first season of Halo Infinite&#x27;s multiplayer top the list with more than 200,000 peak players. However, some old stand-bys also make appearances, such as Grand Theft Auto V, Dota 2, and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Perhaps most surprising is Cyberpunk 2077 appearing in the top spot – somewhat shattering the illusion that CD Projekt Red&#x27;s most recent game was an overall disaster. At the very least, a ton of people are still playing Cyberpunk more than a year later. 
With over 100,000 peak players, Capcom&#x27;s excellent Resident Evil Village makes an appearance, as does Farming Simulator 22 and Battlefield 2042. Games you might expect to see here are also accounted for, such as Among Us, Rocket League, Destiny 2, and Dead by Daylight. 
Back 4 Blood, Phasmophobia, Sea of Thieves, and Final Fantasy XIV all stand out in the over 60,000 peak players listing. And not to be forgotten, Left 4 Dead 2, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, Fallout 4, Dying Light, and Loop Hero all had big years, being played by more than 30,000 people in 2021. 
 While we&#x27;re here recognizing video game achievements in 2021, why not check out Game Informer&#x27;s picks for the 10 best games of the year? Thinking about next year, here are the games we&#x27;re most excited to play in 2022.</span>

                    <span>For a while in the late 2000s, developers at Rockstar New England thought they were working on the next big Rockstar game.
They were excited to push the company’s tech and to bring a cult hit into Rockstar’s vision for the future. They were excited for the chance to prove themselves as a Rockstar studio, having recently been purchased by the company. They were excited to lead development on Bully 2, the sequel to Rockstar’s critically acclaimed open-world adventure about life in a private school.
But things don’t always go as planned, and other obligations on a release schedule get in the way of passion projects. Rockstar New England’s Bully 2 was shelved in favor of other, more troubled projects in development, like Max Payne 3 and Red Dead Redemption.

                    <span>The Tomb Raider reboot trilogy is available for free on the Epic Games Store right now. Between now and January 6, 2022, you&#x27;ll be able to grab the Game of the Year Edition of 2013&#x27;s Tomb Raider, 2015&#x27;s Rise of the Tomb Raider: 20 Year Celebration, and the 2018 definitive edition of Shadow of the Tomb Raider.  
While the Tomb Raider trilogy is the biggest name in Epic&#x27;s free library right now, there are several games currently being sold for up to half-off during the storefront&#x27;s holiday sale. This includes Kena: Bridge of Spirits, Red Dead Redemption 2, Far Cry 6, and Cyberpunk 2077. 
If you&#x27;re on the fence about whether or not you should pick up the new Tomb Raider games, check out our reviews. Here are handy links for Tomb Raider, Rise of the Tomb Raider, and Shadow of the Tomb Raider.</span>

                    <span>It’s easy to take a look at existing MMORPGs and applaud how they’re continuing to push forward with amazing expansions and new content like Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker, but breaking into the MMORPG sphere is ridiculously tough. In the olden days, we’d have new MMOs hitting all the time. Today, the lines are blurred where many games now take features and aspects that were once relegated to the genre proper, and few new offerings in the classic space ever appear. New World was awesome in a few ways here. Not only did it seek to break into a space that’s ruled by titans that have been around for eons, but it did so with a good deal of gusto, willing to explore features and mechanics that are anything but safe.

                    <span>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is the greatest game ever made, according to more than 50,000 people who voted in TV Asahi&#x27;s recent poll to find out the 100 best games of all time. Thanks to Kotaku for the story. 
On December 27, the Japanese TV channel ran a three-hour special revealing the ranking. The list was also posted on Twitter by user @MLZ0902.
Of the 100 games on the list, there are a few surprising stand-outs. Sucker Punch&#x27;s Ghost of Tsushima snagged a spot, coming in at number 66, as did Minecraft, ranked number 20. Both versions of Persona 5 – the original base game and the expanded edition, Persona 5 Royal – were on the list in spots 42 and 93, respectively. What made Persona 5 better than Royal in the minds of those voting, it&#x27;s unclear. Lastly, despite only being re…</span>

                    <span>There’s always a city. There’s always a lighthouse. There’s always a man. There’s also always an opportunity for a company to create a new game in a franchise to make some money, and while I recognize that’s exactly why a fourth BioShock game is in development, it’s hard to stop myself from growing more and more excited about what it might be. 
BioShock Infinite, the last in the series, was released in 2013, and at the earliest, the next one, now in development at 2K’s new Cloud Chamber studio, hits next year. That’s a massive nine-year gap, which has hopefully given those at Cloud Chamber enough time to stir on what a new BioShock game needs and doesn’t need – it has for me, at least.

The official Fortnite Status Twitter account confirmed the fix and also promised a make-good of sorts to compensate players for the time spent offline. More details on what that reward is should arrive next week.

Original Story: If you’ve been having trouble logging into Fortnite today, you’re not alone. Epic Games has confirmed that the battle royale is currently suffering from login and matchmaking problems.
As of right now (2:07 p.m. Eastern), attempting to launch a Fortnite match slaps you with the following message:
Epic doesn’t share an explanation for the outage but promises to provide info when a solution becomes available. In the meantime, if you were hoping to rack up Victory Royale’s in the game’s ongoing Winterfest event, you’re out of luck for the time being. The same is true if you’re looking to blast foes as Boba Fett to celebrate today’s premiere of the character’s new Disney+ series.
Fortnite is currently unavailable and players are unable to log-in while we investigate an issue.

                    <span>Fedora had another successful year and anecdotally enthusiasm around the Red Hat sponsored Linux distribution grew a lot this year among Linux power users. As has been the case for years, Fedora releases have been among the first to feature new Linux innovations from the desktop down the stack -- many of which have been spearheaded by Red Hat engineers. Helping its cause for the past several years is that they have managed to deliver releases on-time (or close to it) and haven&#x27;t been like some of the past distant releases that were rather buggy and other headaches stemming from the constant flow of changes. Fedora 34 and Fedora 35 this year were great releases and continued pushing the distribution on an upward trajectory...</span>

                    <span>It’s pretty difficult to quantify which games actually whip ass, mostly because it’s a little subjective. That being said, if barrelling through the streets of a futuristic, neon-glazed Detroit, hopping over pursuing cop cars and racing through business offices and factories to the tune of an engrossing soundtrack doesn’t whip ass, I don’t know what does.

                    <span>Every year our clone forms degrade, and Katharine spends the winter break copying each consciousness into a new body. Don&#x27;t worry: we can&#x27;t feel a thing! Since our new forms are still coming online from their time spent in the primordial flesh soup vat of the RPS Treehouse, we can&#x27;t post over Christmas, so we&#x27;ve prepared some Christmas Cracker jokes instead! You can help fund the research into longer-lasting clone bodies with the RPS supporter program.
 Now, time to enjoy your nice joke!

Pro některé jiné jazyky (čínština, japonština, korejština a další) se používá výchozí font Noto. Tato rozpolcenost vede k nekonzistentnímu vykreslování písem v některých aplikacích a Fedora tak plánuje logické sjednocení.</span>

                    <span>Every year a glut of video game releases hit the market, making it hard to keep track of everything. RPG fans had a pretty good 2021, from fantastic indies to new games in popular franchises. Bandai Namco gave us two stellar RPGs in Tales of Arise and Scarlet Nexus. Remakes and remasters, like Nier: Replicant, Mass Effect Legendary Edition, and Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, provided plenty of nostalgia, while also bringing new fans into the fold. Longawaited entries finally debuted with Shin Megami Tensei V and Neo: The World Ends With You. And that’s only scratching the surface. Here are five RPGs worth your time that may have slipped past your radar.

If you enjoy RPGs with a nostalgic &#x27;90s feel, Eastward is worth your time…</span>

                    <span>If you’re a long-time Switch owner, you’ve probably figured out that the console is an indie powerhouse. Sure, the Marios and the Zeldas are great too, but there’s something special about loading up on some great indie games to play in bed or on the go. 2021 was a strong year for indies across the board, but if you’re curious which games attracted the most eyeballs on Switch, Nintendo’s got you covered.
The company released a brief video showing off the best-selling indie games on Switch. Sadly, the montage doesn’t reveal actual sales numbers nor does it rank these titles in any kind of order based on performance. Apparently, all we need to know is that they outsold the gazillion other indie games to hit the eShop in 2021, which is still an impressive feat.

If you don’t feel like watching the video, the best-selling indie games on Switch in 2021 are (in alphabetical order):
Axiom Verge 2
Curse of the Dead Gods
Cyber Shadow
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus
Eastward
Ender Lilies: Quietus of the Knights
Islanders: Console Edition
Littlewood
Road 96
Slime Rancher: Plortable Edition
Spelunky 2
Stick Fight: The Game
Subnautica + Subnautica Below Zero
Tetris Effect: Connected
Unpacking
That’s a strong list of quality games, so it’s reassuring to see that they’ve earned a buck on top of garnering critical praise. I&#x27;d personally recommend giving just about all of them a look.

                    <span>Next year&#x27;s slate of games looks spectacular! But unlike most years, a ton of the games we&#x27;re excited about already have a release date, coming just a couple of months after the prime holiday season. February 2022 is currently looking like one of the most stacked months in gaming ever, reminding us of the biggest and best weeks of the fall. We thought it&#x27;d be fun to compare the upcoming 28-day gauntlet, which is gaining more killers every day, to massive release calendars of gaming&#x27;s past. First, let&#x27;s take a look at what we have to look forward to this February.
The month starts out strong with the Life is Strange Remasted Collection on February 1, followed shortly behind by Dying Light 2 Stay Human, Techland&#x27;s open-world zombie RPG, on February 4. OlliOlli World from Roll7 lands February…</span>

                    <span>New Batman comic books release each week, and we are also frequently treated to new movies and animated shows that put the Caped Crusader in the spotlight. With so much new Batman material to pull from, it&#x27;s amazing that toy manufacturers are still turning to 2009&#x27;s Batman: Arkham Asylum video game for new action figures.
McFarlane Toys is the latest company to create an awesome (and terrifying) figure from this dark game. Falling into McFarlane&#x27;s DC Multiverse line, fans will soon be able to get their hands on the monstrous and hulking Titan Joker action figure. If you played the game, you know The Joker ingested a chemical compound called Titan to try take down Batman. That plan didn&#x27;t go so well, which becomes a plot point for the sequels.
McFarlane shared a first look at this mega-scale figure on Instagram:
Other than this tease, McFarlane hasn&#x27;t shared any details regarding release time frame or pricing. The Batman figure that Titan Joker is holding retailed for roughly $25 when it released a couple of years ago. The Titan figure should be considerably more than that.
McFarlane Toys has a long history of making awesome video game collectibles. You can check out some of the company&#x27;s other offerings here.</span>

                    <span>Yoko Taro is known as the mastermind behind the Nier series (and its predecessor, Drakenguard) though he may be putting the former behind him for good. The eccentric game director with the bizarro mask has teased that he’s putting Nier behind him for good.
In a holiday message recorded on December 22, Taro, along with Nier producer Yosuke Saito and series composer Keiichi Okabe, discussed the last year as well as the sales success of Nier Replicant ver. 1.22474487139 (which has pushed past a million copies, according to the team). The update comes off as a friendly chat between old friends, as they bounce between discussing traveling abroad to meet fans, want they want for Christmas, and complaining about shoulder problems. 
But when Saito asks Taro if he has anything new to share regarding the Nier series, Taro bluntly replies “Nah, nothing!” When Saito asks if he’s fine with not doing anything more with YoRHa, Taro half-jokingly declares “We announced it here today folks! The Nier series is now finished!”  You can watch the video by clicking the embedded tweet below. 
YOKO TARO said it here, NieR is finished 😱

Of course, Taro could easily be kidding and Saito immediately calls him out on it. Taro admits abandoning Nier could be a lie, saying “But … you never know …I might do more if I get a big ‘ol pile of money...”
So is Nier done for good? My money is on “probably not, but don’t expect anything new for a long time.” Especially if Taro does indeed receive bags of cash. In October, Taro released Voice of Cards, a turn-based RPG revolving around cards (but isn’t actually a deck-builder). He’s got some “free time” on his hands now that it and Nier Replicant are out the door, and we’re intrigued to see what he’s got up his sleeve next.</span>

&quot;What games should I get for my PlayStation 5?&quot; This is the question we&#x27;ve been asked the most since Sony&#x27;s new generation of gaming arrived last November. People want to see what games are the best showpieces of PlayStation 5&#x27;s power, and also which ones take their beloved medium to new heights. Although the PlayStation 5 is still young, it has already amassed a nice library of games, including a few titles that you can&#x27;t play anywhere else.
The Game Informer staff has selected 10 games that we consider to be the PlayStation 5&#x27;s absolute best. Over time, this article will be updated with the latest releases that we think crack the top 10.
Please note that while the list below contains 10 entries, we aren’t ranking them. If a game has made it this far (and …</span>

                    <span>When Knockout City was first announced earlier this year, I confused it with Rocket Arena, the other stylized 3-versus-3 third-person multiplayer game published by Electronic Arts in 2020. However, unlike the latter, Knockout City was highly praised by fans and critics alike when released earlier this year. And while it’s a rather unconventional pick for Game Informer’s Best Sports award, Velan Studios’ eccentric dodgeball game is an easy standout in a year when most sports franchises are coasting by.

                    <span>Horizon Forbidden West’s new setting is teeming with exotic, dangerous, and never-before-seen machines. We already broke down the fearsome Slitherfang, and Guerrilla divulged some additional details on previously revealed robotic creatures. But, for those who haven’t kept track of the game’s fearsome new faces, here’s a handy round-up of the new machines that have been revealed thus far. 
  



      
												
Rollerback
Rollerbacks resemble giant armadillos that, you guessed it, like to roll. They fold their massive bodies into spinning balls of death and hurl themselves at targets, seemingly using the flames firing from their scale-like armor as propulsion. We&#x27;ve also seen them eject their scales as projectiles, then magnetically recall them. Additionally, Rollerbacks are even capabl…</span>

                    <span>If you’re excited to kill Chaos in Stranger of Paradise Final Fantasy Origin, experiencing everything the adventure has to offer will require jumping through an extra hoop. Square Enix has announced that the game will feature additional, downloadable missions that won’t be available at launch. The catch? You can only get them by pre-ordering the game digitally. 
The missions in question are called Trials of the Dragon King, Wanderer of the Rift, and Different Future. There are no details on what they entail content-wise, only that they won’t be available to purchase separately. The only way to access them is via the Digital Deluxe Edition of the game, which runs for $89.99.

                    <span>Legendary commentator, broadcaster, and NFL Hall of Fame coach John Madden has passed away today at the age of 85.
Madden was best known for his role in the NFL as head coach for the Oakland Raiders from 1969–1978, where he led the team to a Super Bowl XI victory in the 1976 season. He later became an unforgettable, bombastic broadcaster for CBS, Fox, ABC, and NBC, covering and commentating on NFL games every week. Along with his memorable advertisements for companies like &quot;Tough Actin&#x27;&quot; Tinactin to his various cameos in film and television, he was a nearly inescapable part of American culture for well over 30 years following his successful coaching career.

We also know John Madden from his years of being involved in video games, having a franchise emblazoned with his name since John Madden Football in 1988. For 23 years, he had given his name, likeness, and often times his voice and infectious persona to the games developed by Electronic Arts now known as Madden NFL. He has an indelible legacy in the world of sports, video games, and culture at large. The least we can say is thank you, John, for the years of sharing your knowledge with your players and audience, being endlessly entertaining, and playing such a big part in making video games what they are today.
Our condolences go out to John&#x27;s wife Virginia, their sons Michael and Joseph, and their families, friends, and loved ones who knew John.</span>

                    <span>Immersive sims are tricky games to get right. The spaces need to have incredibly tight design so they feel fun to explore, and lots of ways to get around them. And one of the best games of the year just happens to be one that does that expertly. Hang on, Deathloop? What are you talking about?

                    <span>Every year our clone forms degrade, and Katharine spends the winter break copying each consciousness into a new body. Don&#x27;t worry: we can&#x27;t feel a thing! Since our new forms are still coming online from their time spent in the primordial flesh soup vat of the RPS Treehouse, we can&#x27;t post over Christmas, so we&#x27;ve prepared some Christmas Cracker jokes instead! You can help fund the research into longer-lasting clone bodies with the RPS supporter program.

                    <span>LEGO and Sega are teaming up for a New Year&#x27;s release of the LEGO Ideas Sonic the Hedgehog Green Hill Zone set. The build is a take on some iconic stage pieces from the speedster&#x27;s first outing, complete with a Sonic minifig and a devious Dr. Eggman.
You&#x27;ll be able to build this 2D-inspired set early next year that features modular elements, which looks to allow the level to be rearranged or connected to other LEGO sets for fun mashups. 
Here&#x27;s the full rundown of features as told by LEGO:
5 minifigures, including a new version of Sonic and also Crab, Motobug, Dr. Eggman, and Phantom Ruby
10 ring boxes
Modular build, which can be linked to other architecture sets
Interactive elements and easter eggs, such as:
Those gem rewards are colorful Chaos Emeralds you can collect and store on a special pedestal as you find them.
LEGO fans design these LEGO Ideas sets and this Sonic-themed kit was submitted by Viv Granell, described as a LEGO superfan based out of the UK. After submission, Ideas are voted on by the public, and those who get a total of 10,000 votes are considered by LEGO to be released as a real set. Fortunately for Sonic fans and Granell, this one made the grade just in time for the blue blur&#x27;s 30th anniversary. 
This LEGO Ideas Sonic the Hedgehog Green Hill Zone set will be available for purchase through LEGO&#x27;s website on January 1, 2022, and will cost $69.99.

                    <span>Remedy&#x27;s recent dealings with Epic Games haven&#x27;t stopped the developer from making moves elsewhere in the industry. It&#x27;s been revealed in a communication to investors that Remedy Games has developed a relationship with Tencent for a global license, development, and distribution deal for a new cooperative multiplayer game currently codenamed Vanguard.
Vanguard is said to be a free-to-play, co-op, PvE shooter that&#x27;s an IP owned by Remedy and will combine &quot;Remedy’s narrative expertise and action gameplay into an immersive multiplayer experience.&quot; The deal will apparently have Tencent localize and publish the game for &quot;selected Asian markets,&quot; while Remedy will handle development and distribution globally in other territories. It also allows Tencent the license to create a mobile version that the two entities have &quot;agreed on a separate revenue sharing scheme for.
Here&#x27;s Remedy Entertainment CEO, Tero Virtala&#x27;s statement on the partnership:
We don&#x27;t know much else about Vanguard other than it&#x27;s being developed for consoles and PC using the Unreal Engine. You can read the full announcement on Remedy&#x27;s investor site here, and after that, read about its current deal with 505 Games, which includes another multiplayer game set in the Control universe. For even more Remedy check out the Alan Wake 2 trailer from The Game Awards earlier this month.</span>

                    <span>Master Chief is one of gaming&#x27;s most iconic figures. Standing at roughly seven feet in height and weighing nearly 1,000 pounds, he has the stature of a superhero. His exploits on the battlefield back up his size – a one-man army capable of turning the tide of war. We&#x27;ve seen how resourceful and powerful he can be in story sequences and advertisements, but many of those dynamic actions don&#x27;t cross over to when the player controls him. He can swing big hammers, pilot any vehicle, and run and gun with swift grace, but so can most combatants in the game. Prior Halo gameplay hasn&#x27;t made him look like the super soldier we envision. Enter the grapple shot, a new gadget in Halo Infinite that adds dynamic layers to this series&#x27; beloved combat and makes Master Chief look like a gun-toting superhero.…</span>

                    <span>Halo Infinite&#x27;s shop updates every Tuesday at 10 a.m. PT with new items that players can purchase with credits. Since the launch of the free-to-play multiplayer component, 343 Industries has done a nice job of offering up colorful items for players to purchase. The latest rotation brings back someone who we may all love more than Master Chief.
That someone is Mister Chief! The adorable and overly intense comic version of Master Chief is now in Halo Infinite through a 2,000 credit bundle. This collection gives you AI models, charms, a nameplate, weapon, armor, and vehicle emblems that are modeled after this character.
The shop doesn&#x27;t offer any new Spartan armors today and instead focuses on vehicles. If you like your vehicles in shades of blue, you can purchase the A259 Collection, which gives you the blue Noble Principle vehicle coating, the Pilchuck Bumper for the warthog, and Blue Commando emblems.
You can also take to the skies in the all-white Snow Blind vehicle coating that is a part of the Snow Bird bundle. This pack comes with the Tundra Purist weapon coating and Sabre Response emblems.
The daily item listed today shows you what Master Chief&#x27;s skateboard would probably look like. The Shred or Die bundle comes with a Shreddin&#x27; nameplate, UA/Type ST knee pads, a skull charm, and skateboard-themed emblems.</span>

                    <span>2021 has been filled with a ton of great games, with high-profile titles and hidden gems both in abundance. However, there’s one that might be a perfect fit for your comfy holiday play sessions. It’s a turn-based RPG that’s got some adventure and puzzle elements with a bit of humor and a cozy aesthetic. That’s right, we’re talking about Echo Generation, which is also available on Game Pass, so if you’re not sure you’re interested, that’s a great way to give it a shot and see.

Echo Generation, in a nutshell, is a burrito of homecooked 80s and 90s love.  So yeah, it’s basically Stranger Things meets Earthbound, with a fun turn-based combat system that’s more like Paper Mario or South Park: The Stick of Truth. In combat, you not only control the two main c…</span>

                    <span>As a series, Forza Horizon has been on a roll for some time. After visiting Australia in the third installment and touring Great Britain in the fourth, we’ve known for some time that the newest and fifth entry in the long-running racer would transport us to the idyllic environs of Mexico. But it wasn’t until we got the final game in our hands that it became clear; Playground Games has gone above and beyond, crafting one of the best looking new-gen games on the market, and filling it with some of the most entertaining racing experiences in memory.
A good opener can go a long way to setting a game’s tone, and Forza Horizon 5 nails the landing – both figuratively and literally. In a rollicking opening sequence, one vehicle after another goes parachuting out from a cargo plane, dropping into various locales across Mexico. In just a few short minutes, the game makes a case for its tremendous potential, showing off everything from muddy offroad races through rivers and jungles, to blazing street races in supercars most of us will never drive in real life.

More specifically, $80 million will go to members of the class-action suit, with the remaining $20 million covering legal fees for the plaintiffs. 
According to The Washington Post&#x27;s Shannon Liao, &quot;All current and former California employees and contractors who identify as women and worked at Riot Games between November 2014 and present day qualify for a payout.&quot; With the number of eligible participants counting upwards of 2,300 women, those who have a longer tenure with the company or were employed by Riot earlier are subject to receiving a larger claim of the payout.

                    <span>Death Stranding and Metal Gear Solid director Hideo Kojima has a couple of new projects in the works, according to SiliconEra&#x27;s report referencing a New Year&#x27;s interview with Famitsu. 
Not a lot is said about the substance of Kojima&#x27;s projects, but he mentions he is working on both a &quot;big&quot; title and a &quot;new challenging&quot; project. Differentiating that second title as &quot;new&quot; may imply a fresh IP for Kojima Productions, while the other could be something the studio is already familiar with. We&#x27;ll have to wait a while longer to find out whether that&#x27;s the case or not.
Kojima also stressed the want to create media outside of the confines of gaming, which falls in line with Kojima Productions&#x27; recent opening of a new business division focused on developing TV and film projects. 
Famitsu&#x27;s column includes interviews with 127 game developers looking forward to 2022 and their aspirations for the upcoming year. Other industry luminaries you can find in there include Koei Tecmo Games&#x27; Fumihiko Yasuda, Capcom&#x27;s Takayuki Nakayama, and Yoshinori Kitase of Square Enix.</span>

                    <span>Many video game franchises are ripe with fascinating characters that demand further exploration, and anime is often a natural fit to flesh out their stories and showcase those action-packed battles in pure cinematic form. But which ones are really worth your time? Some anime merely rehash the main narrative of their video game source material, while others flesh out characters with prequels or unique side stories. Truth be told, there’s value and entertainment in all types, and we’ve picked some of our favorites for you to enjoy.

                    <span>Diablo has, for good reasons, become a shorthand for describing the flavour of gothic, grimdark fantasy setting in games, where pus-filled demonic hordes and rotting, undead corpses scour a hellish cathedral looking for unwitting adventurers. For all its wretched decay, however, the series still feels like an indulgence to be savoured. Its clickiness and abhorrent sights make the games endlessly gratifying, and masterful butchery of fiends eases most players into a comfortable rhythm. And part of that appeal lies in the macabre yet captivating fantasy it so deftly peddles — all that blood, gore and guts really make for a grisly setting that’s nearly impossible to look away from.


Tainted Grail: Conquest conveys the same sense of blight and doom in its dark fantasy universe — one that’s a reimagining of Arthurian legends — but also ups the ante with a huge wallop of Slay The Spire’s roguelike, deck-building elements.

Nová verze 3.8.0 tak například předělává a rozšiřuje systém klávesových zkratek, díky čemuž je možné program ovládat více zařízeními (například MIDI klávesami či herními ovladači jako gamepady a joysticky). Standardní klávesové zkratky nyní mohou využívat i práci s myší (pohyb, stisky více tlačítek/kláves, rozličnou dobu stisku/kliknutí). Kdo si zadefinoval vlastní klávesové zkratky v předchozí verzi, ten o ně přijde a musí tak učinit znovu.</span>

                    <span>Ever wanted to play a 4v1 asymmetrical horror game where four survivors face off against a killer? Wait, that’s called Dead by Daylight. Propnight essentially combines the asymmetrical antics of Dead by Daylight with PropHunt, which creates a different experience entirely, as survivors can turn into books, chairs, hot dogs, crates, giant pianos and stuffed bears, and basically anything else in the environment. While the game has a lot of various features and mechanics that players will recognize from Dead by Daylight such as the survivors working on various objectives to open the exit gates, the game has a decidedly different tone. While games can still get plenty sweaty, it’s hard to take things seriously when players are possessing giant pigs and jumping on the killer’s head, stunning them, and then hopping into a backpack and hiding on a bookshelf.

There are no perks to sift through on either side of the equation, so whether you’re the survivor or the killer, props are the key element for success or failure. Some props, like giant pigs or rolling wheels, are easy to spot and chase, but others like diminutive soda bottles or logs can blend in seamlessly with the environment. If you turn a corner as a survivor under a chase and spot something you can turn into, the killer could easily run by your location completely oblivious to you standing still right there. Props also let you get around the environment in far more dynamic ways than as a human, being able to execute flittering swoops, jumps, and other fare around the board with verticality. Of course, the killer isn’t defenseless here, as they have their own tools. In fact, one killer, The Imposter, can actually pretend to be a survivor and turn into props as well. Talk about deception!
If you’re looking for a bizarre take on existing mechanics, this is one you might want to check out.
Propnight is currently available on PC.</span>

                    <span>If you’ve been into tower defense fare at all in your gaming escapades, you’ve probably come across one of Ninja Kiwi’s bloons games. 2021 took things in a different direction from the incredibly popular Bloons 6 with a title that has a decidedly competitive slant, as two players battle it out in tower defense action. Tower defense games are all over the place, but the Bloons franchise has really taken off in the wake of an era of incredibly popular map mods that embraced the genre, many of which got started in Warcraft 3 or StarCraft. Dedicated tower defense games exist as well and are especially pervasive on mobile platforms, with titles from the Kingdom Rush franchise being notable. Anyway though, this time it’s all about the bloons!

                    <span>Over the last two decades, Edmund McMillen has made a name for himself in the game industry as one of the preeminent hitmakers in the independent development scene. Whether you&#x27;re talking about his early days churning out cult-classic games with Adobe Flash or his mainstream success with titles like Super Meat Boy and The Binding of Isaac, McMillen is one of the greatest success stories to come out of the millennium’s early indie boom. And yet, through all this success, McMillen has felt like an outcast.
We sat down with McMillen for an extended conversation to learn about the unique path the artist and designer took to become one of the most successful independent game developers of this era.

So you got your hands on an Xbox Series X? Congratulations! As you&#x27;ve probably noticed by now, the hardware allows for lightning fast gaming when compared to previous generations, and the Quick Resume feature that allows you to seamlessly change games is, well, a game-changer. While the feature set of the Xbox Series X is impressive (not to mention its stellar backward compatibility library), you probably want some games to play on that beast of a console.
The team at Game Informer worked together to compile a list of the 10 games we think are the best on Xbox Series X/S. As more games come out, we&#x27;ll update this list with the latest releases that we feel deserve to crack the top 10.

                    <span>As a child struggling to sleep at night I&#x27;d dream of three worlds. First and least of these was Desert World, a blithe eternity of golden sand always viewed from kilometres up, where fizzing white rings rose toward me like expanding surf. I&#x27;d try to find my way down to the surface, but always at the risk of glitching straight through and ending up in Snake World, where monstrous serpents emerged from darkened kitchens.


Somewhere between these two poles lay the realm of the Animals, not that they were really animals, but clouds of eyelash-thin mandible, grot and sparkle, like rotten food on the point of becoming a school of tropical fish. I loved Animal World. I used to spend hours trying to mind-hack my way into it. I was pretty shocked to find its likeness in Sluggish Morss: Pattern Circus - an irresistibly strange, gristly, sorrowful, comical and inventive album of creatures, songs, places and phrases from Jack King-Spooner and composer Helena Celle.

                    <span>Pokud se vám nechce ven, můžete si sněžení pustit i v Linuxu. Jde o starý známý xsnow, možná to ještě někdo nezná. Výhodou je, že balíček xsnow bude pravděpodobně i ve vaší distribuci. Na desktopu vám padají vločky a kupí se na oknech. Kromě toho projíždí Santa Claus a na desktopu se také objevují vánoční dekorace.</span>

                    <span>It’s hard to imagine a collaboration between Zero Escape and Danganronpa creators Kotaro Uchikoshi and Kazutaka Kodaka going under the radar, but an odd release schedule (involving dropping a half-finished experience on Apple Arcade) saw interest in the collaboration buried by the time the game hit PC last month. Which is a shame, since it’s a rather unique title in their respective careers, and it charts new waters for these cult directors.


World’s End Club was the first game the pair released since forming their own studio, Too Kyo Games, and can best be described as a bizarre but intriguing blend of platforming and death games, starring a cast of prepubescent children way too young to be fixing the world or dealing with cults. Think Danganronpa, if Danganronpa was a Saturday morning cartoon rather than a murder game filled with psychopaths.

For 24 hours, Epic are handing out Pathfinder: Kingmaker free for keepsies. It&#x27;s a vast fantasy RPG based on the Pathfinder pen &#x27;n&#x27; paper system, played out in ye olde isometric perspective. The sort of RPG that&#x27;s fascinating to some, offputting to others—so a great candidate for a freebie.

                    <span>Today I made a life-changing discovery. Takaya Kuroda, the man who voices Yakuza&#x27;s beloved protagonist Kazuma Kiryu, is also the lead singer of a band. They&#x27;re named Takaya Kuroda &amp; Goodfellas and they have a Christmas song out. Not only is this excellent news, I can&#x27;t get over the fact it straight up sounds like Kiryu delivering some festive cheer. So get comfy, bang this on, and let Kiryu&#x27;s warm tones wash over you like mulled wine.

                    <span>Right now Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker is so popular you can’t buy it anymore. To prevent overcrowding and crashing servers, Square Enix have had to halt free trials and new sales to keep the game stable after an unprecedented surge in popularity this summer. Between that and the global shortage of materials to add more servers, it may be quite some time until new players are able to experience it. If you have an active subscription and manage to brave the long queues however, you’re one of the lucky few who get to experience something truly special. For everyone else: hang in there, it will be worth the wait.

                    <span>MERRY CHRISTMAS YA FILTHY ANIMALS! This time of year can be one that feels particularly apocalyptic, as well as, you know, good will to all I guess. If I have to. The indie games I&#x27;ve been playing recently all have a bit of an end-of-the-world flavour to &#x27;em, whether literal or metaphorical or by your own hand, if you feel like it. I dunno, I actually found them strangely relaxing, as a sort of counterpoint to the chaos of my own life during the holiday season. See what you think.

                    <span>The latest free game giveaway in GOG&#x27;s winter sale is an unexpected one for the festive season, but perhaps a game which captures the feeling of being trapped at a seemingly endless Christmas lunch with awful relatives: I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream. Nothing says &#x27;bad family Christmas&#x27; like being tortured for 109 years by a sentient supercomputer which nuked humanity and keeps only five people alive to torment. The 90s point &#x27;n&#x27; click adventure game is a grim one (so grim!), but one which does have its fans.

                    <span>In a special Christmas message from three of the NieR series&#x27; development stars, creative director Yoko Taro has announced that NieR is over. No more NieR games for us... unless he receives a massive pile of money. Quickly, it becomes clear he&#x27;s just joshing around. Another classic ruse from the man in the Emil mask, and a subtle hint that they may have something new in the works. Plus, it&#x27;s just a really delightful video and you should all watch it.

                    <span>Though I hardly remember the Steam Autumn Sale ending, the Steam Winter Sale started yesterday, bringing squillions more cheap video games. If you&#x27;re staring baffled at an endless list of innumerable deals, you could use some help. Honestly, most of our Steam Autumn Sale recommendations still stand, but the few of us in the RPS treehouse who haven&#x27;t already clocked off for the Christmas holiday do have some fresh picks for you too.

                    <span>We&#x27;re nearing the end of the year and my brain&#x27;s battery is flashing red. There&#x27;s some Christmassy-ness flowing in to tide me over, thanks to the mini-Christmas tree in my room. Every year it&#x27;s popped on the wardrobe alongside an honorary Lynx Africa. They share the same festive colours, after all.
Having pondered my tree for a bit, I thought about trees in games and how they make for good side quests. Now join me by the bark, as I examine why this might be the case in a roundabout manner.

                    <span>When I was younger I watched a nature documentary narrated by David Attenborough (I realise that doesn&#x27;t narrow it down) and in this nature documentary David told me about a cave. It is a very big cave, and every night a huge colony of bats come screaming out of the entrance. They spend the day clinging to the ceiling of this big cave, and all their bat poo falls down and has become a towering heap carpeting the floor.
But then David said look, the carpet is moving. And it turns out that the whole bottom of the cave is covered in cockroaches and giant centipedes. And if ever a small baby bat or an old injured bat falls, it is eaten alive by this hoard of chittering insects. This nature documentary haunted me, for it was the worst thing I could imagine happening.
Anyway, Nate has been to that cave and he&#x27;s going to tell us all about it for this episode of our supporters only podcast, The Nate Files. Thanks for being a supporter, pals!

                    <span>It&#x27;s been a busy, kind of mixed year for strategy games. Ever a broad church, 2021&#x27;s seen enough releases to keep ten of me busy, from the easy-going Legion War to the month-consuming Shadow Empire. I don&#x27;t know about you, but my personal &quot;to play&quot; list is out of control.
And yet, while we&#x27;ve had plenty to enjoy this year, it&#x27;s felt like a period of build-up to something bigger. I&#x27;m not one for looking forward. If a game&#x27;s not out yet it tends to disappear from my mind, making room for a hundred other recent releases in this age of plenty. That I&#x27;ve less interest in looking back over this year than I do pondering the next suggests that maybe we&#x27;re in for something special in the coming twelve months. Or perhaps it&#x27;s just been a rough one and I&#x27;m very sleep deprived and don&#x27;t want to think about 2021. Either way, let&#x27;s have a look at what&#x27;s in store for strategy fans in 2022, yeah?

Among these are Perfect World, the publishers of Star Trek Online and Torchlight, and the studio behind Scribblenauts Showdown, Shiver Entertainment. They&#x27;re also going transmedia, buying comics and TV company Dark Horse as well as an animation company and a video-on-demand network. Now they just need to get into food and housing, then our dystopian dreams of one corp owning our entire lives can come true.

                    <span>A recent round of BIOS updates for Dell and Alienware systems has turned out to be something of a bad batch. As first spotted by Bleeding Computer, multiple owners of Dell-made PCs – including the Alienware Aurora R8 and Inspiron 5680 gaming desktops, as well as the Latitude 5320 and 5520 business laptops – started developing big problems after installing the new BIOS versions. Failed boots, mainly, which of course makes it harder to apply potential fixes.

                    <span>Everyone knows there are two conditions that must be met before Christmas can officially begin. The first is playing Skeal. The second is the arrival of Steam&#x27;s Winter Sale. Blissfully, we can now tick both of these objectives off our to-do list, as Valve have finally unleashed their flurry of seasonal deals. Between now and January 5th, thousands of games will be discounted across Steam, and you&#x27;ll also be able to claim a free sticker every day as well, for those of you who enjoy that sort of thing.

                    <span>As that age-old saying goes, all good things must come to an end. As we prepare to put a full stop on the year and see out 2021 from our cocoon of Christmas chocolate wrappers, we must also sadly bid farewell to our news writer Imogen Beckhelling, who is heading off for a new adventure in the games industry in the New Year. Today is Imogen&#x27;s last day at RPS, so come and say goodbye.

                    <span>It struck me recently that I’ve not played as much of Halo Infinite’s multiplayer as I thought I would. I envisaged myself wiling away most evenings with my mates, playing Oddball and Slayer and laughing like someone from those video game adverts, swaying violently with a controller in hand.
I now know the reason why and I hate to admit it. Infinite doesn’t have a battle royale mode, which I&#x27;ve come to realise is the perfect FPS template for gaming with my mates. Something about it just works, you know? Listen, let me explain.

                    <span>I know almost nothing about Alfred Hitchcock. He’s the kind of archetypal director whose work I’ve been exposed to in bits and pieces without ever actually sitting down to watch one of his films in full. All of that is to say that, upon starting Alfred Hitchcock - Vertigo the game, I was in no position to judge whether it was a faithful adaptation of the film or to recognize all but the most obvious illusions to Hitchcock’s body of work (look, birds!). That’s okay, though, because as it turns out, Vertigo is an original story based on a collage of Hitchcockian concepts, not a direct adaption of the 1958 film by the same name.
Vertigo the game follows author Ed Miller as he grapples with a debilitating case of vertigo–a condition that leaves him unable to stand as the world appears to spin around him–and paralyzing guilt over the death of his daughter and her mother, Faye, after their car falls off a bridge into a ravine below. With Ed bed ridden, it’s up to Dr. Julia Lomas, psychologist and psychiatrist, and Sheriff Nick Reyes to unravel the mystery of what really happened, and whether Faye and his daughter even exist. My thoughts on how Vertigo goes about telling this story are... complicated.

                    <span>Final Fantasy XIV players haven’t had it easy these last few weeks. The sheer success of its Endwalker expansion resulted in lengthy login queues and server errors. It’s become so popular that Square Enix have temporarily stopped selling the game, taking its Starter and Complete Editions off sale. All the while, some low-poly grapes stayed static in the breeze. Jagged, delicious, minding their own business. Until their blockiness was papped and thrust into the public eye. Memes ensued and the grapes became the talk of the town, so much so that they’ve been smoothed out in the latest patch, much to everyone’s dismay.

                    <span>Gather round, readers, and I&#x27;ll tell you the tale of the time I opened the 22nd door on the RPS Advent Calendar. I was with three friends, and we&#x27;d been adventuring together for years at this point - two of us were lovers, and yet a third had made a strange pact with a wolf God. We could do anything together, we four. And then we stumbled upon this door...

                    <span>Book Of Travels is what developers Might And Delight call a TMORPG - a &quot;tiny&quot; multiplayer online role playing game, as opposed to a &quot;massive&quot; one. It&#x27;s a gorgeous-looking adventure that came out in early access back in October, but unfortunately the launch didn&#x27;t go as well as the devs had hoped it would. Yesterday, they announced that they&#x27;ve had to lay off around 25 employees to keep the studio going. They add that development will continue, albeit at an understandably slower pace.

                    <span>Hello folks. It&#x27;s been a funny old year, 2021. On the games side, it&#x27;s often felt like a year of shifting goalposts. Games that were delayed by the pandemic last year finally got their due in 2021, but in turn many of the releases we were expecting this year have inevitably slipped into 2022. The pandemic has affected games of all sizes this year, and I don&#x27;t think it will go down in the history books as one of our all-time greats. There were still plenty of fantastic games that came out this year, mind, and we&#x27;re still counting down our absolute favourites over in our Advent Calendar. 
That said, I do think 2021 will prove to be a pivotal year for RPS - and not just because I stole Graham&#x27;s key card and changed the locks on the front door of the Treehouse. It&#x27;s been a year of immense change here at the site, so I wanted to take some time to reflect on everything that&#x27;s happened this year, and look forward to what we&#x27;ve got in store for 2022.

                    <span>If you simply can&#x27;t get enough of raccoon detectives sleuthing around dystopian Vancouver, then you&#x27;re in luck, because more is on the way. Developers EggNut have announced that a new Backbone game is coming in 2022, dropping us back into the snowy, animal-filled city. We don&#x27;t know much about it yet, but Backbone is an excellent detective puzzle game, and a gorgeous one at that, so I have high hopes for the next one.

                    <span>This door on the Advent Calendar is probably locked with a needlessly complicated key split into several pieces. Also, it is very, very tall, as if for someone who is already taller than average and then wears heels.

                    <span>After GTA: The Trilogy - Definitive Edition had a pretty naff launch last month, Rockstar ended up giving PC remaster owners copies of the oldies for free as an apology. The devs have another freebie for those folks too now - you can claim a free copy of GTA V: Premium Edition, GTA IV: Complete Edition, LA Noire, Bully: Scholarship Edition, or Max Payne 3 over the holiday period. Ah, free festive violence.

                    <span>We called Final Fantasy VII Remake a luscious spectacle that takes FF7 in a bold new direction. You know what else takes it in a new direction? Dresses. Loads of them. Modders have been hard at work weaving nice dresses with their virtual looms at a rate of knots. Oh, and they’ve morphed characters into Buster Swords and produced some other equally useful things too. Let&#x27;s have a gander at some of their most interesting creations.

                    <span>Update: Loop Hero&#x27;s time is done! The dino-battling FPS Second Extinction is the new freebie. 
Original Story: This year had us stuck in many video game time loops, but one of my absolute favourites was Loop Hero. I never thought an autobattler RPG would hook me the way it did, but I spent hours upon hours helping a little knight circle a seemingly endless void, and had a wonderful time doing it. If you didn&#x27;t have a chance to play it earlier this year, it&#x27;s now free on the Epic Game Store until tomorrow. I heartily encourage you to pick this one up, it&#x27;s one of our favourite games of 2021.

                    <span>The great thing about traditions is: you can just make them up. While some traditions feel more real because they&#x27;re embedded deeper in our culture, you can start your own whenever you want, and jettison any you don&#x27;t care for. Anything can be imbued with special meaning and, over time, grow into a tradition you cherish and come to anticipate. So here I am, approaching Christmas, so ready for my annual play of Skeal. Join me, reader dear.

                    <span>There’s no single, solitary reason why it’s been so hard to buy certain PC components over the past year and a bit – it’s more like a perfect storm of multiple circumstances, unfortunate coincidences and unforseen annoyances. That said, one of the biggest underlying causes of MIA CPU and graphics card stock has been a shortage of the chips needed to make them, and it’s a shortage that Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger has warned could likely continue into 2023.

                    <span>Oslain Brante tried to be a decent guy. Kind to his relatives except the one who murdered him. Resolutely loyal to his friends, even dying for one. Willing to die once again rather than betray his revolutionary allies. But it just kept going wrong for reasons that felt utterly artificial and sometimes deeply dissatisfying.
I&#x27;d have given up on the game if it weren&#x27;t so interesting. For one thing, none of those deaths were final. He died as a child and came back. He died as a teenager and came back. These were not saved games, but ordinary occurrences. It&#x27;s an interesting world made infuriating by awkward design choices.

                    <span>A new Cyberpunk 2077 mod makes the dystopian RPG&#x27;s decorative monorails functional, adding a metro system with cute wee trains you can ride. For all the game&#x27;s flaws, I did greatly enjoy wondering Night City&#x27;s streets, cooing at giant buildings and bright colours, and today I was glad to continue that tourism on rail. How lovely to see the megacity from a new perspective, looking down on rooftops and being buzzed by hovercars. See a wee bit of my journey in a video below.

And if you’ve got the ray tracing beta version of Minecraft for Windows installed, I can heartily recommend you too take a wander through the Nvidia RTX Winter World: a vast, Christmassy and very, very pretty custom map that has you helping Santa throw a festive shindig while you trade sweets with his elves.

Our short king&#x27;s battle out of the underworld beat out its closest competition, cosy escapism simulator, Animal Crossing: New Horizons in the polls by almost fourfold.

                    <span>Once the most prestigious of luxury tech, VR headsets have become both cheaper and more popular over the last few years.

Now developers Eugen Systems are making a spiritual successor called WARNO, which is coming to Steam Early Access next month.

For those of you more skilled than me, the trailer comes alongside the news that the DLC will launch January 6th.

Only kidding! I mean, statistically speaking I probably wouldn&#x27;t get on with all of you, but I actually really appreciate that you&#x27;re taking the time to read this and check out what games we&#x27;ll be playing this weekend. In fact, we&#x27;ll probably play loads of games over our breaks, but we&#x27;ll tell you about those later. Until I see you again, have a lovely time celebrating the end of the year, however you do it.

                    <span>Walking through the smoggy jerktown that is London a while back, the thought occurred that for all the building games I&#x27;ve played, I&#x27;d never seen one about remodelling an existing city. The closest I knew was NIMBY Rails, which isn&#x27;t even close.
It turns out I was miles behind the curve, as The Architect Colon Paris already exists.

                    <span>Earlier this year, Black Isle Studios and Interplay Entertainment announced they were porting the old 2001 hack and slash Baldur&#x27;s Gate: Dark Alliance to PC and consoles. It came out on PlayStation back in summer, alas they didn&#x27;t give a date for PC. But, surprise! It&#x27;s today! PC folks can finally try out the Baldur&#x27;s Gate that console users first experienced 20 years ago. I did a full playthrough this summer and had a lovely time, at the expense of my partner, who I made sit through one of the jankiest couch co-op games in existence.

                    <span>This week&#x27;s episode of the Ultimate Audio Bang is both festive, but tinged with sadness. It&#x27;s Imogen&#x27;s final run of the pod and I&#x27;m very sad about it. But we (I) gather ourselves and chat FPS news, like how PUBG is going free to play, Overwatch actually has something new, and lots of Halo Infinite stuff. We also get one final update on Imogen&#x27;s Apex Legends rank. I&#x27;d love to say it&#x27;s positive, but it&#x27;s actually quite crushing. Merry Christmas.

                    <span>Remember when the Devotion developers Red Candle showed off a tiny snippet of a pretty 2D game they&#x27;d been working on earlier this year? They didn&#x27;t have much to say about it at the time, but last night they announced it properly. Named Nine Sols, it&#x27;s an action platformer with combat inspired by Sekiro. Honestly, they still don&#x27;t have much to say about it beyond that, but they have released a gorgeous poster featuring a cat-like character that you can see in full below.

                    <span>You know what Christmas was missing? The unmatched fear of being chased by terrifying killer robots through a shopping mall. Five Nights At Freddy&#x27;s: Security Breach launched last night, inviting players to fend off a whole new crew of animatronics. This is the eighth mainline game in the long-running pizzeria-based horror series (I know, there are loads of spin-offs too), and for the first time it will let players properly roam free, rather than be tied to a desk monitoring cameras.

To celebrate the first flakes of glimmering ice wafting out of the sky like God&#x27;s own sub-zero dandruff, here&#x27;s a list of the best snow in PC games. Put on a hat, for heaven&#x27;s sake.

                    <span>Dota 2 has a new event mode and battle pass. Aghanim from last year&#x27;s Aghanim&#x27;s Labyrinth event has returned, and this time a &quot;multiverse-melding mishap&quot; has split him into several doppelgängers players must rescue. The event mode is free, but it arrives alongside a new battle pass that&#x27;ll cost money to enter.

More strangely, today&#x27;s update also introduces experimental gamepad support.

                    <span>The makers of Arma and DayZ have revealed Enfusion, the new cross-platform game engine they plan to build future games on. No, Bohemia Interactive haven&#x27;t announced Arma 4, but they do say they would use Enfusion for &quot;any potential new Arma game&quot;, so maybe that&#x27;s something to bear in mind while looking at its screenshots of vast landscapes. While they don&#x27;t have much more than screenshots and a wee video to show right now (sorry, engine enthusiasts), they do hint that they&#x27;ll release some sort of &quot;playable demonstration of its features&quot; at some point &quot;soon&quot;.

They&#x27;re starting with one that I&#x27;m certainly curious enough to play for free but not buy: Shenmue 3. Yeah gwan, I&#x27;ll grab that. Epic are also going wild with coupons again, giving a £10 (or $10) coupon on every game you buy which costs at least £13.99 (or $14.99). Given Epic&#x27;s habit of paying for timed exclusives, they do have discounts on some games you&#x27;ll not get elsewhere, or at least not with those vouchers.

                    <span>Let me slap you with the caveat up front. Halo Infinite&#x27;s best place is its open world, through which you can swing like a honking metal Tarzan and do sweet Warthog jumps from cliffs. But its best level, the most satisfying A-to-B gun boulevard, comes late in the campaign (spoilers ahead). The House Of Reckoning is a series of rooms where contrived artificial battlefields have been constructed inside an alien fortress. They are abstractly human structures surrounded by sand, as if your extraterrestrial enemies have been playing house but believe a homo sapiens&#x27; house looked exactly like a chunk of Normandy beach circa 1944. The narrative reasoning behind this level is absurd. But the fights that occur within are excellent.

                    <span>God rest ye merry listener, let nothing you dismay - for today, for one night only, EWS stands for Electronic Wrestling Show. Yes, our podcast&#x27;s wrestling promotion has rolled into your town for a showstopping tag team match. Each of your pod hosts fields a three-game tag team of our favourite games of the year, and fields them in a spectacular(ly described) ladder match. The victor will claim the GOTY In The Bank briefcase and win the chance to compete next year as well.
Before we get to that, though, we must first discuss (at length) whether 200 t-shirts is a lot of t-shirts, what Nate is having for his Christmas dinner, what kind of cop duo would be named Halloumi &amp; Date, and also what our favourite Christmas songs are. Nate also does a really good Mankind pun. Plus: which wrestler would be the best hugger?

                    <span>Final Fantasy VII Remake certainly knows how to make a good first impression. The original&#x27;s bombing mission sequence, which sees Cloud and co. blow up a planet-killing mako reactor in the industrialised hellhole of Midgar&#x27;s city centre, was already one of the Final Fantasy series&#x27; best openers, but here we get to really luxuriate in every last detail of its twenty-four-year glow-up. Director Tetsuya Nomura may have a reputation for excess in JRPG circles (both in his tangled storylines and his passion for buckles and belts), but in FF7R that tendency toward indulgence has been applied with deadly, laser-like precision.

The suit started in December 2020 with investors primarily upset with the fact that the console version was in such a state, claiming that CDP hadn&#x27;t been honest about the game and its prospects. CDP say that the proposed settlement terms make clear that though they are paying out, this &quot;does not imply admission of any responsibility&quot;.

                    <span>It’s been nearly a year since Nvidia started reissuing older GPUs, like the GeForce RTX 2060 and GeForce GTX 1050 Ti, to help deal with the great worldwide graphics card shortage. More recently, Nvidia went a step further, quietly launching a brand new version of the RTX 2060 that doubles its VRAM to 12GB.


Emphasis on the “quietly”, mind – even if you’ve been regularly checking for available GPU stock or perusing our graphics cards deals guide, you probably won’t have even noticed there’s a 12GB RTX 2060 knocking around. So what’s the deal with this mysterious card, and should you even consider buying an RTX 20 series card in this day and age?

                    <span>The Gunk might not be the most sophisticated name in the universe for a gooey black jelly that pulses with an ominous red light, but goodness it sure is appropriate. As space haulers Rani and Becks touch down on a forgotten planet in search of a strange energy signal, the place is absolutely gummed up with the stuff. It oozes and throbs in the caves, plains and rivers of this once vibrant landscape, and the urge to suck it all up into Rani&#x27;s chunky power glove (a literal hand vac in this case) is overwhelmingly strong. After all, when it turns the ground black and saps the world of all its colour, this is one case of Extremely Bad Vibes you&#x27;ll want to remedy as soon as possible. 
Your reward for scooping up all the gunk in any given area is the kind of graphical wizardry video games do best. A burst of light, a shruum of sound, and the world is instantly transformed back to its former glory. Despite its gloopy namesake, The Gunk is frequently stunning, its soft pastels and coral-esque flora showing such an eye for jaw-dropping visuals that it&#x27;s hard to believe this is SteamWorld developer Image &amp; Form&#x27;s first ever 3D video game. If this is what they&#x27;ve been holding back on all these years, then their upcoming action adventure SteamWorld Headhunter should be a real treat for the old eyeballs. That said, while Image &amp; Form have clearly navigated their 2D to 3D transition from an art perspective, their typical flair for adding their own spin to different genres has been less successful. There&#x27;s a lot to like about this 3D action platformer, but it&#x27;s missing that spark to really make it sing.

                    <span>Roll7 have announced that their next skating game OlliOlli World comes out on February 8th, 2022. This latest OlliOlli game swaps out the 2D style for a cel-shaded 3D world that looks absolutely lovely. Or radical. Or sick. Or other skater words. The action-platformer&#x27;s plot sounds great too, it drops you into Radlandia on a search for the skate gods. Skate gods! Don&#x27;t anger them, kiddos, they&#x27;ll break your collarbones.

                    <span>Here I was thinking Tetris 99 was the strangest game to be turned into a battle royale, but now you can fight to the death in Scrabble too. Babble Royale is a new Scrabble-like battle royale where 16 players fight to be the last letters standing. You have to make words in such a way that you escape a zone that&#x27;s closing in, and attack other players by building words off of theirs. I honestly didn&#x27;t think it would work, but man, it absolutely does.

                    <span>Final Fantasy XIV is suffering from success, thanks, in part, to its recently released Endwalker expansion. Despite updates to ease server errors and long queue times, players are still struggling to log into the game. So, Square Enix have only gone and done it. They&#x27;ve temporarily suspended sales of the game, as well as new registrations for the free trial version. Even adverts are being stopped for now.

                    <span>After eight years of radio silence, Ubisoft are finally bringing Sam Fisher in from the cold, as they&#x27;ve just announced a remake of the original Splinter Cell. In keeping with the series&#x27; stealth roots, the game was announced with little to no fanfare this evening via a blog post, with Ubisoft declaring its existence along with some developer chat before scampering back into the shadows. Typical.

                    <span>It&#x27;s not often those Nintendo Directs have PC-related news for us, but today&#x27;s announceathon had a little treat. Loco Motive is a train-based detective game published by Chucklefish (who also pubbed Stardew Valley and Starmancer), and is the debut game from developers Robust Games. There&#x27;s been a murder! And it&#x27;s your job to figure out who committed the crime. Classic whodunnit stuff that we&#x27;ll get to play next summer.

                    <span>If you fancy escaping from reality in 2022 (and let&#x27;s face it, who wouldn&#x27;t at the moment?) You can grab the excellent HTC Vive Cosmos Elite VR headset kit for £649. That&#x27;s £250 off the list price, as well as a return to the price that the full VR kit was going for on Black Friday. Surely, this is a sweeter deal than Tom Cruise&#x27;s Christmas cake.

                    <span>Nerves have been sufficiently jangled as of late, not least thanks to the slew of action packed games that have landed in recent months. I crave an altogether more sedate beginning to next year, and so my mind turns to games in which violence, reflex or any other kind of unblinking attentiveness takes a back seat. 
Looking for a broader mixture of games? Check out our regularly updated list of the best PC games you can play right now.
Primarily we&#x27;re talking violence-free games here, but I wanted to drill a little deeper than that - so nothing that generally requires a competitive streak. I&#x27;m chasing a certain feel rather than a certain category. Flying, walking, puzzling, driving, building, dreaming, climbing, stretching, swinging (not like that), swimming, wondering: these are just a few of the ways in which flashing pixels can make you feel a very different sort of accomplishment.

                    <span>I really don’t like gaming chairs. They’re expensive, often cumbersome, drastically over-designed things that lean way too heavily into the g4m3r aesthetic, and that’s coming from someone who’s built up something of a tolerance to it from years of unprotected RGB exposure. I’ve sat on them and have even shared homes with some of them, but have never, ever seen the appeal over a halfway decent office chair.


And then the Noblechairs Epic TX comes along, and it’s got me rethinking.
