                              <span>Death Stranding is one of 2019’s best games (in my personal opinion), and it’s one I hope everyone gets the chance to try. Sure, you might not like it, but if it hits, it hits hard. 
PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 players know that, as the game was PlayStation exclusive at launch. It hit PC in 2020, but you had to buy it outright like any other PC game. Now, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass members might get the chance to try this Norman Reedus-led adventure across America with their subscription if a new, somewhat cryptic tweet from the official PC Game Pass account is anything to go by. 
Check it out for yourself below: 
sometimes we just like a good landscape picture #NewProfilePic
August 16, 2022
As you can see, PC Game Pass draws attention to the fact that it’s changed its profile pic to that of a familiar landscape. If you look at the profile pic, you’ll see what appears to be a landscape shot from Death Stranding. Now, it could be a different game but like, come on, that’s Death Stranding, right? 
All of this is to say that it seems like a formerly PlayStation-exclusive game – mind you, one developed by independent studio Kojima Productions that was funded by Sony Interactive Entertainment – is coming to PC Game Pass, a subscription service that’s a part of the Xbox ecosystem.

                              <span>Kilter Films, Bethesda Game Studios, and Amazon Studios announced in 2020 that a Fallout television series was on the way.
Not much has been revealed about it since then, other than a report from 2021 that detailed the show as a “gonzo, crazy, funny adventure.” However, images from the production’s set have begun to leak online, as reported by Eurogamer, and the show looks true and accurate to the famed video game series.

The level of detail on this Amazon Fallout series 🔥 pic.twitter.com/fou1UL1vhs
August 17, 2022
As you can see, the vault looks pretty spot-on, as do other details like the Vault-Tec logo. Even the vault suits look amazing, although, as the person who snapped that image mentioned, they are a little different from what we’re used to in the games. Nonetheless, my excitement for this series has grown considerably since seeing these images. Hopefully, this same attention to detail has been put into the writing. 
There is no release date for this series.

                              <span>Evil West, the upcoming third-person wild west action game developed by Flying Wild Hog, has been delayed. 
Originally due out this September, the game has now been delayed to November 22, 2022. Fortunately for those excited about the rootin’ tootin’ action of slaying vampires and killing other various (terrifying) creatures, this delay only pushes the game back by about two months. As for why, publisher Focus Entertainment released a statement on Twitter explaining that it’s the result of the team wanting the game to be the best it can be at launch. 
Here’s the studio’s statement, in full:

Evil West first premiered at The Game Awards 2020, and it immediately caught my attention. It gave me big Darkwatch vibes, a game I loved on PlayStation 2, and the first gameplay we saw at The Game Awards 2021 last December confirmed those vibes. If you’re looking for more of the game, you’re in luck because, in June, the studio released more than 10 minutes of new gameplay. 
Are you excited about Evil West? Let me know in the comments below! Also, if you played Darkwatch, that game was dope, right?</span>

                              <span>That horizontal Switch dock setup has everyone asking questions
Masahiro Sakurai isn&#x27;t doing Smash Ultimate DLC streams at the moment or working on another entry (that we know of), but he&#x27;s still taking to Twitter constantly to talk about the hobby. His latest set of tweets involve his updated Sakurai gaming setup, which has decidedly gone vertical.
In a series of photos, he shows off his made-to-order shelves, which house numerous gaming consoles. Visibly, we can see an Xbox Series X, PS5, Switch, PS4, PS3, Wii U (!), Famicom (NES), Genesis, and SNES. The top plate and back are removed to push out heat, and he leaves the door open when playing. Adorably, he has a few controllers labeled with tiny little stickers, like &quot;Xbox X&quot; or &quot;2&quot; (presumably for player two). Those same labels adorn the power cables that plug into the wall (and the power supplies can be turned off individually).
An updated look at the Masahiro Sakurai gaming setup:
https://twitter.com/Sora_Sakurai/status/1559806360329392128
The most curious element is easily the horizontally-docked Switch. He even had to post a response tweet because of it! Here&#x27;s what he said: &quot;There was a reaction to the Switch dock horizontal placement...it&#x27;s not recommended by the manufacturer, so do it at your own risk. This is just my personal experience, but I had no problems using it until I cleared Xenoblade Chronicles 3.&quot; Well, if Sakurai says it&#x27;s okay! To be frank I never even really considered it, but it looks awesome on certain shelves.
If you&#x27;re curious, PushDustIn chronicled Sakurai&#x27;s previous setup in 2019 here. You can compare and contrast!

Mere weeks from the Loyal Samoyed controversy, Activision Blizzard is at the center of another plagiarism controversy pertaining to its military shooter franchise, Call of Duty. And once again, the accusations are pointing toward a brand new, but familiar-looking, character skin.
As reported by Polygon, the new plagiarism allegations are aimed at Call of Duty: Vanguard DLC skin &quot;Doomsayer&quot;, a frighteningly imposing figure bedecked in black, full-body tactical armor, a grim reaper-style hood, and one of those wanky digital facemasks then were popular for a hot minute at comic-book conventions. the programmable faceplate sports a grimacing skull, a common design for the billion-dollar franchise.

One god game is leaving Xbox Game Pass at the end of August, but a few &quot;immortal&quot; games are stepping up to take its place. As Supergiant&#x27;s Hades leaves at the end of the month, Xbox Game Pass picks up Immortals Fenyx Rising, Immortality, and several other new games for the service.
The selection for this month is a solid selection of indie gems, both new and old. Coffee Talk arrives today, letting you play barista to a host of creatures in alt-Seattle. Opus: Echo of Starsong arrives later on, bringing a vibrant art style and deep narrative to the service.
A notable arrival this month on Game Pass is Immortality, the new FMV adventure from Sam Barlow and Half Mermaid. It was pretty impressive when I previewed it, and seems like it…</span>

                              <span>You only need one button
Ninja or Die is a peculiar name for a game, but I took a look at the ninja-slaying roguelite on Steam and I&#x27;m intrigued by... all of this. It&#x27;s so fast and flashy, I can hardly keep up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;94IVbgfT0p0
I&#x27;ve watched the trailer for Ninja or Die a few times now, and I&#x27;m still piecing it together; slow-mo helps, but I doubt it will fully click until we&#x27;ve tried playing it.
Nao Games and Marvelous Europe are hoping to blend &quot;hardcore action&quot; with &quot;simple controls,&quot; and I&#x27;m curious to see how that will pan out once the training wheels are off. Specifically, Ninja or Die uses one-button controls. &quot;Jump to where you point, eviscerate the enemy by dashing through them, and hold to attack with greater power.&quot;
The setup is that you&#x27;re a secret agent in a &quot;ninja-eat-ninja world&quot; with bosses to bring down and hordes of smaller creeps to cut through. As a roguelite experience, death is a part of the deal and you&#x27;ll accumulate perma-upgrades as well as alternate characters. You can power up your stats back at the village or &quot;pay the back-alley doctor.&quot;

As opposed to some recent roguelites, Ninja or Die seems to emphasize high scores and replayability over a loop-based format that&#x27;s servicing a larger story. On that note, levels are &quot;a mix&quot; of procedural and hand-crafted, and there&#x27;s an Infinite Watchtower to run.
The pieces might not all add up in the end, but the strangeness appeals to me. I just hope that when I&#x27;m the one leaping around Japan like a madman, I have a better sense of my busy surroundings. From the outside looking in, readability is a concern.
As luck would have it, there&#x27;s a browser-based demo to get a feel for it.
Another one for the wait-and-see wishlist? I think so.

What do you get when you take a generous helping of Fall Guys, add a pinch of Super Monkey Ball and then mix in a lovely big dollop of Kirby? Well, a great big dream buffet, that&#x27;s what.
Kirby&#x27;s Dream Buffet is a bright and breezy party game that sees a whole field full of Kirby characters roll at speed down sweet treat-laden tracks where the only objective is to get to the bottom first and lay claim to the largest mountain of strawberries when you get there.

                              <span>But he&#x27;s perfect no matter what.
Kirby has one of the most simple and recognisable designs out of any video game character. He&#x27;s just a pink round boy with big eyes and an irresistible face! We want to cuddle and squeeze him. But for today&#x27;s brand new Kirby game, Kirby&#x27;s Dream Buffet, it seems like Kirby needed to be even rounder!
@ObscureKirby has looked into Kirby&#x27;s character model in the party game, which sees Kirby roll around in various food-themed minigames and challenges, and has found out that Kirby&#x27;s model is more round than it was in his previous game, Kirby and the Forgotten Land. (Thanks, NintendoSoup!)

Publisher Secret Mode has announced that its side-scrolling adventure title Little Orpheus will launch on the Switch next month on September 13th.
The launch comes after the game was delayed indefinitely back in March of this year due to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. At the time, the publisher stated that &quot;some of the themes and content may be upsetting to players&quot; due to potentially offensive references to the Soviet Union. However, after scouring through the game in the months since, it has determined that the game - developed by The Chinese Room - can launch without any changes to its content.

Devolver Digital has always had an eye for some delightfully odd gaming experiences. Play as an ape escaping its captors while freeform jazz blasts in the background. Rob pretentious rich people as a con man in 18th century France. Eviscerate houses full of goons as a drug-addicted ninja with PTSD. The latest in this long line of the publisher&#x27;s memorable releases, Cult of the Lamb, places you in the role of an adorable fluffy lamb harboring the soul of a sinister ageless deity. It’s intense, it’s cute, it’s stressful, and it’s absolutely something that you need to try out.
You begin your journey by being sacrificed by a woodland cult which is killing the poor creature because a prophecy stated that a lamb would be the vessel by which The One Who Waits would make its glorious return. The four resident Old Ones really weren’t fans of The One Who Waits, so they imprisoned it in another dimension to consolidate their power over the woodland creatures.

The Pokémon World Championships kick off tomorrow in London and the city has truly thrown itself into the celebrations. If you are lucky enough to be attending the Championships or are attending the Pokémon Center Pop-Up over the next few days and are looking for a way to arrive in true Trainer style, then look no further than the TFL cable cars which have undergone a Pokémon makeover.
Many are heading to the event today, either to prep for the Championships, settle themselves in London for the night, or to spend lots of money at the Pop-Up store, and they&#x27;ve been taking pictures of the Pokémon-themed sights. Each car has been branded with a different Pokémon type and features unique creature displays depending on which one you get to ride in. Even TfL has got into the spirit and is celebrating the makeover on Twitter!

The Pokémon World Championships are almost upon us and The Pokémon Company has revealed a healthy amount of in-game merchandise that viewers will be able to get their hands on for free.
These limited-time offers (brought to our attention by Go Nintendo) will be available to anyone watching the championships via the official Twitch streams, during which various codes will be posted that will allow you to unlock several cool new items in Pokémon Unite, Pokémon GO and the Pokémon Trading Card Game. It looks like these codes are not going to hang around for long after the Championships end on August 22nd, so be sure to have your Switch and mobile at the ready while tuning in!

It&#x27;s been announced that Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes has now surpassed 1 million units shipped worldwide, marking a significant milestone for the latest entry from developers Omega Force and Team Ninja.
The achievement encompasses sales across physical and digital formats, though it&#x27;s currently not known what the sales split is across the various territories. What&#x27;s noteworthy, however, is the milestone has seemingly been reached much quicker than the game&#x27;s predessecor, Fire Emblem Warriors, which reached 1 million units shipped roughly 7 months after its launch in September 2017. Three Hopes, on the other hand, launched a little less than 2 months ago in June 2022 (with no 3DS version, either!).

Inti Creates, the developer behind Azure Striker Gunvolt 3 — the long-awaited third mainline game in the series — has acknowledged that there&#x27;s a save data-corrupting bug in the Switch version of the game.
Sharing the information on Twitter, the bug can occur when you delete a save file and then change the settings or language options on the title screen. This will then cause the last played save file to get corrupted. The issue only appears to have happened since the game was updated to ver. 1.0.2.

                              <span>Last time, you decided that nude mods are better than going into meats and guts. Oh sure, you&#x27;re brave with your votes, but not one single commenter was brave enough to address the subject of honking their pud. Cowards. If you won&#x27;t expand, we have to move on. This week, I pose a question of squeaky critters versus a squeaky coat. What&#x27;s better: a level 1 rat, or Alone In The Dark&#x27;s jacket inventory?

                              <span>The Twitter account for Microsoft’s PC Game Pass service decided to change their profile picture, and coyly drew attention to its familiar looking mist-covered rocky backdrop with a tweet. &quot;Sometimes we just like a good landscape picture,&quot; they said enigmatically. If you’re familiar with the Game Pass Twitter accounts, they like to do the flippant social media thing and tease followers. Well, this latest attempt has people speculating that the Sony-trademarked Death Stranding is about to hit PC Game Pass.

I’m not very interested in this, to be honest, but I am curious about the “milk-coolant PC” that Tony’s avatar will be using to get the W’s and build creepy parasocial relationships with viewers. Could such a PC, liquid-cooled by a dairy product, actually function?

In a message posted to the official site, Tower Of Fantasy’s devs Hotta Studio say they’ve now implemented increased server caps and improved server recommendation logic for PC. There’s also a queue timer, if you find your feet tapping while you’re waiting to join. You can watch the game’s launch trailer below if you missed it last week.

Výsledky jsou poměrně zajímavé, v průměru lze říci, že Ryzeny (konkrétně Ryzen 9 5900HX a Ryzen 7 Pro 6850U) jsou stále nejlepší, Intel je v závěsu (model Core i7 1280P), ale Apple M2 už k dotažení moc nechybí (M1 pak není o moc horší). Bavíme se přitom o linuxových testech, kde podpora čipů rodin M1 a M2 je teprve vyvíjena, přičemž Apple spíše linuxové podpoře naházel klacky pod nohy, kterými se vývojáři z Asahi Linuxu už více než rok a půl postupně prokousávají.</span>

Thus far the result is a slew of reskin mods which let you replace Spidey with other characters and play while looking like Kingpin, Miles Morales, Mary Jane, or - as pictured above - Stan Lee.

                              <span>Earlier today we looked at a deal on AMD&#x27;s top graphics card, the RX 6950 XT, and now it&#x27;s time to look at the opposite end of the market: one of Nvidia&#x27;s cheapest RTX graphics cards. Ebay is running a promotion today that knocks 15% off the price of brand-new items when you use the code BANK15 at the checkout, and you can use this to pick an RTX 3060 12GB for just £279. 
This is a great price for this mid-range GPU, and it&#x27;s especially rare to see features like hardware-accelerated ray tracing and DLSS image reconstruction at this price point.

                              <span>Excellent roguelikelike dungeon crawler Backpack Hero launched into early access this week, and it&#x27;s absolutely worth a go if you enjoy shuffle items around your inventory grid. Backpack Hero is all about arranging weapons and items inside your massive sack to develop powerful synergies, see. Some items buff items touching them, while others benefit from empty spaces, or some insist upon being in a certain grid row, and some even move around by themselves. The buildcrafting gets fiendishly fun as your critter delves deeper into dungeons in search of a giant hunk of cheese.

                              <span>Unity Software have chosen to reject a $17.54 billion (£14.58 billion) all-stock takeover offer from mobile gaming technology company AppLovin to instead pursue their own planned merger with AppLovin’s rival ironSource. Unity’s board of directors unanimously cast aside the AppLovin offer, which hadn’t been sought by the game engine company, after a “thorough financial and strategic evaluation”. The board has recommended that shareholders vote against AppLovin’s offer.

                              <span>Guild Wars 2 celebrates its 10th anniversary this month, and ArenaNet is celebrating by introducing the MMORPG to a new audience on Steam. 
On Tuesday, August 23, Guild Wars 2 will be available on a third-party platform for the first time ever. Since its launch in August 2012, the game has only been accessible through ArenaNet’s proprietary launcher. Guild Wars 2 on Steam will retain its subscription-less, free-to-play model. Additionally, Steam players and those on the original client will play together on the same servers. If you’re a newcomer wanting to catch up on a decade’s worth of content, a $99.97 Complete Edition of the game for Steam bundles Guild Wars 2’s three expansions and all five seasons.
ArenaNet is introducing Twitch Drops. Now you can earn exclusive in-game character outfits, experience boosters, and a special Glowing Purple Mask cosmetic by watching streamers play the game from August 23-28. 


“Guild Wars 2 has delighted over 16 million players for a decade with its subscription-free business model, epic collaborative open-world boss encounters, and revolutionary mount system,” said Kendall Boyd, Senior Vice President of Marketing at NCSOFT West. “By launching on Steam, a whole new audience of players who have never had the chance to adventure with us will be able to experience one of the greatest fantasy worlds in gaming. Everyone at NCSOFT and ArenaNet is excited to welcome them into our amazing community.”
Guild Wars 2 has been hailed as one of the best MMOs of its time. ArenaNet has supported the title with seasonal updates and expansion packs, the latest being February’s End of Dragons.

                              <span>The Knights of the Old Republic remake sounds like it may be running into some trouble, but fans of the original classic BioWare game have reason to celebrate. Celebrated collectibles maker Gentle Giant is prepping a new statue depicting one of the central characters of the original game. Jedi Knight Bastila Shan has never looked better.
The action-posed figure depicts Bastila Shan in battle with a Guardian Droid in the ruins of Dantooine, one of the early sites players visited in the game. The statue is made of PVC, and looks to feature some impressive sculpting and paint work. The yellow-hued double-bladed lightsaber in mid-swing is a particular highlight.

If it’s been a few years since you ventured into the classic Star Wars RPG, Bastila Shan was a Jedi Master many thousands of years before the events of the Skywalker Saga. Among other gifts provided by the Force, she had the rare capability known as battle meditation, which could be used to boost her allies and demoralize her enemies. At one point, she was tortured and turned to the dark side by Darth Malak, and the player is given a choice of how to interact with her – including options to redeem or kill her.
The new statue is steering toward launch in spring of 2023, but pre-orders open in just a few days, on 8/19 over at Gentle Giant’s official site. Suggested retail price is 80 republic credits, or $80 if you prefer your local currency.</span>

                              <span>Blizzard announced that cross-progression is coming to Overwatch 2, and starting today, you can merge multiple accounts onto a single profile. 
With Overwatch 2 set to release on Oct. 4, which is also when the game will replace the original Overwatch, now’s a great time to get all your cosmetics, loot boxes, and more in order. It’s also a great time to merge some accounts so that you can, for example, jump between playing on PC and PlayStation freely. Fortunately, Blizzard made that possible today because you now merge multiple accounts. 
“With the launch of cross-progression, players can merge multiple Overwatch accounts to carry progression and in-game cosmetics into Overwatch 2 on a single profile,” a press release reads. “Starting Aug. 16, every player with a linked console account will be prompted at login to identify, select, and confirm the accounts you want to merge. Once you approve, we will prepare you accounts to be merged during the release of Overwatch 2.
“All players will need a battle.net account to play Overwatch 2, regardless of platform. Progress from linked console accounts will be stored on your battle.net accounts, which will share in-game cosmetics and progress across the linked accounts.”

                              <span>Last week, a Fortnite tweet announced an incoming Dragon Ball crossover event, with the mythical wish-fulfilling dragon, Shenron, adorning the shared screenshot. At the time, details about content and features were still a mystery. However, a short gameplay trailer released today revealed several collectible items and a Dragon Ball-themed map. You can watch the zany footage below.


According to Gamespot, two bundles touting skins inspired by popular characters will be available for purchase. The cosmetics include Goku, Vegeta, and Bulma with alternate styles, Beerus, and back bling items like Seer Fish, Power Pole, Kamesennin’s Shill, and two new Pickaxes. Nimbus and Space Pod gliders also appear with an anime-themed Kamehameha attack to decimate foes the Saiyan way. Finally, creative maps contain cool locations like Kami’s Palace, Goku’s House, the Room of Spirit and Time, and more. 
The description of the event reads as follows:
The Fortnite Dragon Ball Crossover awaits die-hard fans today.

More specifically, OverBorder Studio&#x27;s take on the action formula popularized by From Software hits consoles and PC on Aug. 18. If you&#x27;re the type of person who loves a good Souls-like, or if you&#x27;ve been curious about Thymesia for a while now, you&#x27;re going to want to check out today&#x27;s New Gameplay Today. Not only does it feature more than 10 minutes of new gameplay, but Marcus, who&#x27;s reviewing the game for Game Informer, walks Wesley through what works in the game, what doesn&#x27;t, and how it&#x27;s different from the countless others like it in the genre.

                              <span>Yesterday, Half-Life fans came together as part of a community-created online event. The goal? To get as many people as possible playing the original 1998 Half-Life on Steam in an effort to set a new record for concurrent players. And not only did they accomplish that, but they also had a fun time remembering a game…

In Other Waters is one of those games that you tell people at parties to play, and hope that they remember after a night of grown-up juice and sleep deprivation. We gave it a 9/10 when we reviewed it, calling it a &quot;minimalist masterpiece&quot; and a &quot;contemplative experience&quot;.
So, if you enjoy Games That Are Good, and you also enjoy owning IRL copies of them, you&#x27;ll be tickled pink/blue to hear that In Other Waters is being released as a physical edition.

The Switch is having a good year for animal-based beat-&#x27;em-ups (Kaiju! Turtles! Uh... Girls?), and Jitsu Squad, the upcoming release from ININ Games, looks set to add to it.
Combining the classic beat-&#x27;em-up mechanics of old-school brawlers with some of the fun game modes that have defined newer releases, Jitsu Squad will see you playing as one of four pumped-up animals looking to take on a wicked sorcerer and his army of goons.

We love the Switch. It&#x27;s a pretty neat piece of kit after all. But that doesn&#x27;t mean we don&#x27;t have issues with the console or think it could do with an update or two every so often. And we&#x27;ve come up with another improvement that we think would make multiplayer even easier.
Who used Download Play on their DS or 3DS? We played so much Mario Kart DS with our friends using this feature that we really miss it. Being able to play games with someone even if they don&#x27;t have their own copy is amazing. But the Switch doesn&#x27;t have this — only Namco Museum and Clubhouse Games: 51 Worldwide Games do something similar. The former has a multiplayer-only version that&#x27;s free (but it only has Pac-Man Vs. which is the only multiplayer game in that collection), and the latter has a Local Multiplayer Guest Edition which you can download from the eShop.

It&#x27;s time for another over-the-top, explosive trailer for Bandai Namco&#x27;s upcoming JoJo&#x27;s Bizarre Adventure: All Star Battle R. The beat &#x27;em up, which is a remaster of a 2013 PS3 game, launches next month on Switch, and we&#x27;re now being given lessons in preparation for the game&#x27;s release.
In typical Jojo style, however, it&#x27;s not a straightforward showcase of the game&#x27;s many modes or abilities, oh no. Narrated by Rohan Kishibe and Koichi Hirose — from the Diamond is Unbreakable arc — the two characters give us a rather enthusiastic rundown on just what&#x27;s coming to the remaster.

The act of &#x27;demaking&#x27; games has become a rather popular endeavour in recent memory, with Game Boy Demakes on Twitter showcasing numerous impressive attempts to authentically recreate popular games with the handheld console&#x27;s visual aesthetics.
The latest game to receive the &#x27;demake&#x27; treatment is Koji Igarashi&#x27;s Castlevania-inspired adventure Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night, which released on the Switch in 2019. The game itself - rather contentiously - opted for a 2.5D approach to its visuals, which disappointment many fans at the time due to the obvious nods towards Konami&#x27;s seminal masterpiece, Castlevania: Symphony of the Night.

Paramount Pictures and Sega Corporation have managed to turn Sonic the Hedgehog into a Hollywood star. The second film — which came out earlier this year — is even the highest-grossing video game movie of all time in North America. So of course we&#x27;re getting a third film in 2024, and a spin-off series starring everyone&#x27;s favourite echidna.
We know very little about Sonic&#x27;s third big-screen outing, but Sonic fansite Tails&#x27; Channel has discovered that the movie&#x27;s synopsis may well have been revealed via an industry publication called Production Weekly.

Back in 2019 we gave a strong thumbs up to Bury Me, My Love in our Nindie round-up. This text game from The Pixel Hunt told the story of a Syrian refugee attempting to cross her war-torn country and make it safely to her husband and a new life in Germany. Three years on and the studio is back to pull on our heart strings all over again with The Wreck, releasing this Fall.
The Wreck moves away from a physical warzone and enters the battlefield of a mind on the brink of collapse. Centred around an unfocused car journey that results in a crash, you will journey back through Junon&#x27;s mind as you discover the path that led her to impact and make decisions in an attempt to influence the future.

Guess who&#x27;s been at it again! One of our lovely video producers, Zion, has long been collecting games and has been sharing his journey with us over on our YouTube channel. To say we&#x27;re envious is an understatement, but in this unboxing video, there&#x27;s something a little bit more special for him.
From pick-ups acquired in his recent trip to London — including Freshly-Picked Tingle&#x27;s Rosy Rupeeland which you have to have really — Wii games, Pokémon toys, and Final Fantasy VII figures, there&#x27;s a wonderful mix of items that Zion has added to the collection.

A game set in the Wild West that also lets me fight vampires? Sounds like a blast to me, and it&#x27;s exactly what we&#x27;re getting from Flying Wild Hog&#x27;s newest title Evil West. The game was originally set to release next month on September 20, but per publisher Focus Entertainment&#x27;s official Twitter page, they just announced that Evil West will be delayed an extra two months to November 22, 2022, to achieve the level of polish they need for the game&#x27;s five-platform release.

Flying Wild Hog&#x27;s letter was understandable apologetic, thanking fans for the &quot;continued support and patience for Evil West.&quot;

                              <span>How to make sure all those fancy skins transfer over
Overwatch 2 is just a few months away. We&#x27;ve known that Overwatch 2 will have cross-progression for a while, and today Blizzard is explaining just how all of it will work.
Cross-progression means that all progression and in-game cosmetics in Overwatch 2 will span across different systems. While previously having, say, a fancy Tracer skin on PlayStation 4 didn&#x27;t mean you could access it on PC, the new system will merge and allow you to use the skin on both.
Starting today on August 16, players with a linked console account will be allowed to identify and confirm the accounts they want to merge. Once approved, the accounts will be prepared to merge on Overwatch 2&#x27;s release. You&#x27;ll need a Battle.net account no matter what, and all progress from the linked accounts will be stored on the Battle.net account.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;6aB-H8QFXA0
As Blizzard notes with red text and emphasis, there is just one opportunity to merge accounts. Make sure you check which accounts are being merged when you do so.
The Blizzard explainer goes into further detail, including addressing a few specific circumstances some players might run into during the merge process. All of this should serve to provide a central platform, similar to games like Fortnite, where cosmetics purchased in one place will be available on the others as well.
One giant closet of cosmetics
As Overwatch 2 moves the game from loot boxes to passes and a shop, having that access is a good thing. It&#x27;s doubly so, since Overwatch 2 will also be taking the place of Overwatch on its launch; like a massive title update for the multiplayer side. The single-player part of Overwatch 2, meanwhile, is expected to arrive sometime later on in the future.
Overwatch 2 will go live and free-to-play on October 4 for PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC.

The shrunken backyard antics of Grounded shine bright in co-op, as it&#x27;s fun to build a base together that everyone can enjoy, and, y&#x27;know, spiders are just less intimidating when you&#x27;ve got backup. In the home stretch before the 1.0 release of Grounded on September 27, Obsidian announced a Shared Worlds feature to make multiplayer less of a hassle.
Here&#x27;s the idea: You&#x27;ll be able to create a Shared World that lives in the cloud and lets other players hop in even when you aren&#x27;t around to host it. In other words, less time getting everyone&#x27;s schedule on the same page, and more time smashing bugs.
In a forum post this week, Obsidian walked through the work-in-progress Shared Worlds feature and its benefits, som…</span>

                              <span>The studio is ramping up even more
Team Asobi seems to have big plans on the horizon. In the wake of launching its latest game, Astro&#x27;s Playroom, as a PlayStation 5 pack-in title, its next project will be its biggest one yet.
In a new interview with GamesIndustry.biz, creative and studio director Nicolas Doucet talks about some of what Asobi&#x27;s been up to post-Playroom. Team Asobi is looking to keep tooling around with the DualSense, a key part of Astro&#x27;s Playroom. And it&#x27;s also looking to expand in scope, too.
Doucet says Asobi&#x27;s next game will follow in the footsteps of its previous games, will be a full-blown commercial title, and will be the &quot;biggest to date&quot; for the studio.
The team at Asobi has been steadily expanding, going from 35 to 60 members. Doucet expects that number to reach around 100. And the makeup is largely Japanese, which Doucet says the team wants to reflect in the games they make.
&quot;We want to make sure that when people play our games that there is a feeling, and you can&#x27;t quite put your finger on it, that it&#x27;s made in Japan,&quot; said Doucet. You can find the full interview with GIbiz here.

Astro&#x27;s evolution
Team Asobi has been on a steady rise for some time. Astro Bot Rescue Mission was considered one of the better PlayStation VR games around. And Astro&#x27;s Playroom was a delightful pack-in console launch game. The platformer harbored tons of nostalgia for the history of PlayStation and its hardware.
Doucet and the team at Asobi have a clear penchant for working with the nuances of Sony&#x27;s hardware. The studio lead says there&#x27;s an extra team on the side at Asobi, always working on the technology and R&amp;D. Where Asobi goes with the DualSense and its next big project, its biggest yet, will be exciting to see.

MultiVersus season one is now officially underway, and over the coming weeks, a steady drop of brand new content will go live in Warner Bros.&#x27; super-popular platform brawler. And, as leaked by the Xbox dash yesterday, two new characters joining the star-studded roster are DC Comics anti-hero Black Adam, and the mischievous-to-the-point-of-deadly gremlin, Stripe.
As is the modus operandi of sneaky PC types, dataminers wasted zero time digging into the files of MultiVersus&#x27; season one update — hoping to find any and all evidence of some unannounced DLC characters. And it seems that their search was a smashing success, after the discovery of a huge batch of voice lines spouted by the irrepressible Beetlejuice, the unpredictable and darkly witty &quot;bio-exorcist&quot; from Tim Burton&#x27;s class…</span>

In a new horror-themed management sim from Unfold Games, you&#x27;ll play as a vampire fresh out of hibernation with a dusty estate to renovate and deck out. One of my favorite parts of games like Stardew Valley and Animal Crossing: New Horizons is the early stages — the clean-up process before you settle into your daily business-as-usual routine. And from our first playfully animated look at Bloody Hell Hotel, there&#x27;s much to do.
The announcement trailer debuted on IGN today, and it moves fast.

The vampire protagonist practically wields force powers in the footage, which I kind of love. How the minute-to-minute experience of Bloody Hell Hotel holds up remains to be seen, but as a foot-in-the-door pi…</span>

Very exciting news for fans of Evil Dead: The Game, as developer Saber Interactive appears to be teasing the arrival of a brand new DLC character. And it appears to be none of than Mia Allen, the gore-covered, deadite-smashing, skin-peeling star of the stellar 2013 reboot of Sam Raimi&#x27;s 1981 horror classic.
Helmed and co-written by Fede Álvarez in his directorial debut, Evil Dead reimagines the unholy tale of the absolute nightmare that besieges a group of friends staying at an isolated log cabin. With the goal of supporting Mia as she attempts to go &quot;cold turkey&quot; on her heroi…</span>

Calling the deal &quot;not in the best interests of Unity shareholders,&quot; Unity is now expected to continue with its previous plans to merge with mobile software firm IronSource. As noted in the original article below, backing out of the IronSource deal was a key condition of the AppLovin proposal.
&quot;We remain committed to and enthusiastic about Unity’s agreement with IronSource and the substantial benefits it will create for our shareholders and Unity creators,&quot; said Unity CEO John Riccitiello of the decision. &quot;The board continues to believe that the IronSource transaction is compelling and will deliver an opportunity to generate long-term value.&quot; — Reuters]

VSFighting, perhaps the UK&#x27;s most prestigious fighting game tournament, will make its grand return this week for the first time in three years. Players from across the UK, Europe, and wider international communities will gather together once again in a bid to lay claim to bragging rights in some of today&#x27;s (and even some of yesterday&#x27;s) hottest scrappers.
The annual throwdown, which has run yearly since its inception in 2010, has been on hiatus since 2019 — impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and its related lockdown rulings. The coming weekend will see the 10th iteration of the tournament, once again hosted by West Midlands FGC Electronic Dojo, return to the Millennium Point complex in Birmingham for three days of sweet &#x27;n&#x27; salty action.

Currently, Epic has implemented two big items into the mix:
Nimbus Cloud (an on-demand glider that lets you shoot into the air to glide with a cooldown timer, similar to other past items)
Kamehameha (an ability that&#x27;s essentially an explosive beam, governed by a maximum of three charges)
You can find these items either through special vendors (Bulma at Kame House on the far east of the map in the island formation), &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; vending machines (marked on the map), or through capsules, which appear on the map like supply drops.

Blossom Tales: The Sleeping King was one of the early Switch success stories that showed how vital the system would be for indie developers. After being largely ignored on PC, the game dropped on the Switch eShop in December 2017 and sold more copies on the platform in one day than in the roughly nine months it had been available on Steam. The move actually saved the fledgling indie studio, and five years later, Castle Pixel is bringing players back to the world of Lily, Chrys, and Grandpa with Blossom Tales II: The Minotaur Prince.

                              <span>It gets to live on in a new era
Wave Race 64 ruled the roost in so many houses across the world, and now, over 20 years later, it&#x27;s back via Nintendo Switch Online.
Set to arrive on the service on August 19, Wave Race 64 joins a smallish group of Nintendo 64 classics that are all part of the &quot;Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack&quot; family. While the rate of games is incredibly slow, the choices have been fairly on-point most months, especially when it comes to this beloved oddity.
I mean, the intended effect of putting a lot of these games on modern platforms is...content and adding value to a subscription service. But games like Wave Race 64 just highlight how many franchises Nintendo is sitting on and doing nothing with. It&#x27;s been over 20 years since we&#x27;ve seen a true sequel, and a return could easily work as a downloadable arcade-esque game. Just announce it at a Nintendo Direct, potentially during E3, and you&#x27;re good to go.
You can watch the trailer below! Speaking of, these types of trailers rule, because they&#x27;re bringing old games back in a new way. It&#x27;s a different type of game preservation, and I dig it.

                              <span>Secret of Nevermore
In my four decades of gaming, there have been very few &#x27;new&#x27; genres, and even fewer that have proven to have lasting staying power. Aside from the phenomenon that is Battle Royale, there is probably only one 21st-century-birthed genre that has proven itself with consistent and cemented success with developers, player communities, and cash registers: The Soulslike.
A sub-genre of RPGs, Soulslikes generally feature grim, deep lore, an emphasis on exploration, build-heavy protagonists, and a typically gloomy, gothic aesthetic. Oh, and they&#x27;re also hard as nails. And yet, despite their punishing difficulty, steep learning curve, and joyless demeanor, the Soulslike genre has enraptured a huge community of devotees, won over by FromSoftware epics such as Demon&#x27;s Souls, Bloodb…</span>

I&#x27;m a Senior Editor and I can consider anything as Front Page news. Here is some Front Page News.
Capcom has released a new walkout video for Street Fighter 6, giving us a quick glimpse of the recently revealed World Warriors Juri and Kimberly as they make their way to the field of battle. The intro vid-cum-loading screen will follow the two selected fighters as they step into the ring accompanied by some characterful animations and SF6&#x27;s dopey, but adorable, &quot;Game Face&quot; staredown screen.
In the clip, we see the Korean taekwondo expert and former assassin Juri as she &quot;chats mad shit&quot;, (Flanx&#x27;s words), to her opponent. Newcomer Kimberly has no time for such mind games, instead taking the moment to hype up the crowd and perform some fancy ninja acrobatics. In a cute tough, Kimberly overshoots the camera and has to awkwardly scurry back into shot. That&#x27;s fun.
https://twitter.com/StreetFighter/status/1559329092675047425?s&#x3D;20&amp;t&#x3D;RegOKDHCGSEuw2ArBLaX9g
The Game Face screen then slams into view, with Juri&#x27;s punk rock sneer and puffed, grumpy cheeks meeting Kimberly&#x27;s sarcastic gurn and knowing smile. It&#x27;s a weird old mechanic, that&#x27;s for sure, but I&#x27;ll absolutely take it all over Street Fighter V&#x27;s charisma-free presentation style. It will be fun to see all of the SF6 roster interact in such a fashion, though I imagine, for the most part, Juri is going to be going ignored by her opposition for most of these walkouts.
Street Fighter 6 launches in 2023 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms — while you wait, please check out our previous coverage, including our looks at Juri and Kimberly, our comments on Capcom&#x27;s approach to the sequel&#x27;s marketing, and our popular Five Do&#x27;s and Do Not Do&#x27;s feature.

Ship of Fools is the latest co-op game to catch my eye, and if you liked Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime, this &quot;aquapocalypse&quot;-canceling adventure might speak to you too. Sailing alone or with a mate, you&#x27;ll fire off cannons and swat creatures on deck.
Team17 and Fika Productions released a new trailer and announced the big day. Ship of Fools lands on PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch on November 22, 2022.

                              <span>Retrace the Myths of Midgard in this rhyming explainer
The holiday season is coming, and with it Ragnarok. Or, at least, God of War Ragnarok. And since it&#x27;s been a few years since 2018&#x27;s God of War, a story recap might be of some use to folks as they gear up for the winter.
PlayStation published a new video today, which recaps the story of Kratos and Atreus from the 2018 God of War. The storyteller walking us through it? None other than The Guild&#x27;s own Felicia Day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;ZjucT-UZzgg
The rhyming tale takes a brief tour through the main story beats of God of War, pausing for a few jokes and asides from in-universe character Mimir. And while it doesn&#x27;t cover every single beat, it does a pretty good job summing up Kratos and Atreus&#x27; journey, as well as some of the conflicts that arose and still persist headed into Ragnarok.
Winter is coming
It&#x27;s a good refresher to have too, as even though God of War was only a 2018 game, it does feel like eons ago to me at this point. Remembering the reason why Freya, for instance, has a bone to pick with Kratos seems like some important topical study material given some of the Ragnarok teases we&#x27;ve seen.
God of War Ragnarok is locked in for November 9, 2022. It&#x27;s also one of the few games still in the holiday window, as more and more have been delayed out into the next year. Open-world wizarding RPG Hogwarts Legacy recently pushed back to February, and Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns is on an undetermined delay as of this writing.
Regardless, I&#x27;m really interested to see where the story goes from here, and how Sony Santa Monica Studios&#x27; interpretation of Norse mythology carries on. God of War Ragnarok arrives on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 on September 9, 2022.

Most of the achievements and trophies in Cult of the Lamb are only a matter of time, but I was nervous about needing to topple the main bosses without taking any damage to unlock &quot;Order,&quot; &quot;Sate,&quot; &quot;Cure,&quot; and &quot;Peace.&quot; After trading blows with every bishop in my original playthrough, I figured there had to be some way to initiate a rematch — the notion of needing to start a new save seemed out of whack with the rest of the game&#x27;s player-friendly tendencies. Thankfully, there is a way to replay bosses, and it&#x27;s quick.
Early on, you might&#x27;ve destroyed many of the bishop statues that appear in dungeons since 1) other breakable objects can give you resources for your base and 2) it&#x27;s inherently fun to smash shit. At a certain point, I stopped doing this — that was my m…</span>

                              <span>Squirrel with a Gun is nuts (in the best way)
One of the most fun things about following a bunch of game developers on Twitter is that you get to see the process of how some really cool indie games are made. That&#x27;s exactly what happened to me with Dan DeEntremont&#x27;s upcoming project Squirrel with a Gun — and yes, that&#x27;s exactly what it sounds like.
The first I saw of this awesome game was a viral tweet from back in May of this year, where he showed off the first time he got fur on the squirrel. The whole thing looks insanely realistic, and obviously, the fact that the little fluffy rodent was holding and firing a gun caught everyone&#x27;s attention. (I mean, who doesn&#x27;t love a game with a fluffy, adorable protagonist.)
https://twitter.com/QuiteDan/status/1525631771387338757
Of course, the game has developed a whole lot more in the past few months, and it&#x27;s pretty fun to scroll through DeEntremont&#x27;s Twitter page and see all of the progress videos compiled in one spot.
Squirrel with a Gun has rightfully gotten a lot of attention over the past few months, because I haven&#x27;t seen a game capture the internet&#x27;s sense of humor so accurately in a long time. Now the game has finally been listed on Steam, and while we may not have any kind of release window yet, it&#x27;s cool to see a small developer making bits steps like that. I know I&#x27;m adding it to my wish list.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;KRz15LfZjBI
Squirrel with a Gun is a testament to how social media has changed the landscape for indie developers in a big way. DeEntremont has been able to make this entire project by himself (at least to my knowledge) and garnered a huge following for it simply because he had a funny idea and the gumption to pull it off.
Here&#x27;s hoping that indie devs continued to be inspired by seeing others succeed like this, because the more goofy indie games there are in my life, the better.

I only knew two things before purchasing 2007’s Heavenly Guardian on PS2. First, it was going to be a game in the Pocky &amp; Rocky series, only maybe not really. It looked to be aiming more at Kiki Kaikai, which the Pocky &amp; Rocky games are the sequels to, but I’m not going to get into the finer details of why they’re almost two separate series. The quick version is this: Kiki Kaikai is Taito; Pocky &amp; Rocky is Natsume. Yes, this means that Pocky &amp; Rocky with Becky is more a part of the Kiki Kaikai series.
Anyway, that’s boring. The second thing I knew about Heavenly Guardian going into it is that it’s considered to be kusoge.

Totally different
According to articles leading up to the release of Heavenly Guardian, the title was originally going to be Kiki Kaikai 2…</span>

                              <span>See what&#x27;s new in the world of Disney and Marvel games
The D23 Expo is coming up, and with it a bunch of Disney and Marvel reveals. Alongside the movies and series, the games of Disney and Marvel are getting spotlighted in a showcase on September 9.
The Disney &amp; Marvel Games Showcase will air on Sept. 9 at 1 p.m. PT / 4 p.m. ET. Hosted by Kinda Funny&#x27;s Blessing Adeoye Jr., it will feature updates on several projects currently in the works.
Those showing off new content include Disney &amp; Pixar Games, Marvel Games, Lucasfilm Games, and 20th Century Games. New reveals from farming life-sim Disney Dreamlight Valley, tactical hero game Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns, and Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga are all in store.
We&#x27;ll also get a sneak peek at the upcoming Marvel game from Skydance New Media. That&#x27;s the studio that Uncharted&#x27;s Amy Hennig is leading up, which is working on both a Marvel and Star Wars project.
&quot;The Marvel Universe epitomizes all the action, mystery and thrills of the pulp adventure genre that I adore and lends itself perfectly to an interactive experience,&quot; said Hennig when the Marvel project was announced last year. &quot;It’s an honor to be able to tell an original story with all the humanity, complexity, and humor that makes Marvel characters so enduring and to enable our players to embody these heroes that they love.&quot;

Games showcases, assemble
Both Disney and Marvel have had a strong video game presence over the years. And now, it&#x27;s joining in on the summer of gaming showcases.
It&#x27;s not the only company with a showcase in September, either. Ubisoft is planning to host an Ubisoft Forward the day after this Disney and Marvel showcase, on September 10. An open-world Star Wars game is in development at Ubisoft, headed by Massive Entertainment. Whether we see that or not, it looks like there&#x27;s a good chunk of gaming news happening in September.

                              <span>Some of the late-hits are toned down, though
Arcade1Up has another retro-revival arcade cabinet on the way, and this one&#x27;s for the sports fans. The new NFL Blitz Legends cabinet combines three remasters of the popular over-the-top NFL Blitz series.
The three games in the cabinet are 1997&#x27;s NFL Blitz, 1998&#x27;s NFL Blitz &#x27;99, and NFL Blitz 2000: Gold Edition from 1999. All three are remastered in the cabinet, which will go for $599.
The cabinet features Arcade1Up&#x27;s usual details, like full side art and a matching riser. Four spots are open for play too, so you can get the whole crew on the sticks for some Blitz. And while it&#x27;s good for local co-op, the Blitz cab also supports online multiplayer via Wi-Fi, as well as leaderboards.
For the cabinet, Arcade1UP partnered with the National Football League and Football Greats Alliance to feature all of the football greats. This includes Dan Marino, Jerry Rice, Deion Sanders, Brett Favre, Jerome Bettis, Terrell Davis, and Cris Carter.

Diving into the endzone
Some of the more rowdy violence has been a bit toned back, however. According to a press release, a specific set of tackles and after-the-whistle hits were removed or edited in the remastered versions of these three NFL Blitz games. These changes support the NFL&#x27;s current Player Health and Safety Initiatives. So sorry, a little bit of the after-the-whistle shenanigans will be tuned down, as they&#x27;ve been in other releases.
This isn&#x27;t the only big arcade cabinet announcement out of Arcade1Up in the last few weeks. The at-home cabinet designer also announced a Marvel Vs. Capcom 2 cabinet at Evo 2022, bringing the classic crossover and several other cross-franchise fighters together for a fighting game collection.
Pre-orders for the NFL Blitz cabinet are live here at the Arcade1Up site. Shipping is expected to start sometime in early October.

Fans of veteran tactical combat series Jagged Alliance are already getting their gear together for the long-awaited sequel Jagged Alliance 3, which is currently in development at studio Haemimont Games. Publisher THQ Nordic released a new trailer for the RTS title during this weekend&#x27;s Digital Showcase.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;Ah9O1LQXIvE
Once again set against the backdrop of Grand Chien, Jagged Alliance 3 sees the fictional republic overthrown by a dangerous paramilitary force following the mysterious disappearance of its president. As &quot;The Legion&quot; embeds itself within each and every sector of the troubled nation, the family of its missing ruler reaches out to the clandestine Adonis corporation to send its best team of black ops mercenaries to locate the president, defeat The Legion, and restore Grand Chien to its former state of (relative) order.
The new sequel, which will arrive a full two decades on from 1999&#x27;s Jagged Alliance 2, will feature the tactical engagement and strategic gameplay of its predecessor, powered by a brand new engine and modern-day mechanics. A huge cast of new and familiar mercenaries will be made available for the player&#x27;s home-grown militia, given access to a huge arsenal of weaponry, equipment, and explosive, town-rattling gear. Battle The Legion&#x27;s forces, train local insurgents, and retake the Grand Chien street-by-street in explosive campaign action alone or with co-op support.
Jagged Alliance 3 is currently in development for PC. A release window has not been announced.

                              <span>Thanks, Nintendo
&quot;Nintendo DLC&quot; is still a weird phrase to utter out loud. At one point in the gaming landscape I never really seriously thought it would be a widespread option, but it&#x27;s rampant enough now to the point where it can be considered part of the company&#x27;s identity.
They adopted the practice a little over a decade ago on the 3DS, where it sometimes was implemented in a janky fashion. From there they expanded to the Wii U. And even then I wasn&#x27;t used to it! But once Nintendo started doing regularly scheduled DLC for nearly all of its games on Switch, it all fell into place. I&#x27;ve accepted it.
Which leads me to this: an official Nintendo DLC tutorial video. If you&#x27;re confused on how to buy more stuff, they have you covered! The below video walks folks through the steps of redeeming the free DLC offers via their Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack benefits. It&#x27;s as simple as &quot;going into the Switch Online menu, then scrolling down, looking at the benefits on offer, and clicking on them until you can hit a download button.&quot;
Right now that selection mostly involves Animal Crossing: New Horizons, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, and Splatoon 2 DLC. Of note, it does not involve Super Mario Bros. 35, which is still discontinued.

                              <span>This week&#x27;s Discourse™ shines the spotlight on gaming chairs
I have a confession: I&#x27;ve never owned a gaming chair, nor have I ever really felt the need to get a gaming chair (well, maybe except for the Hello Kitty x Razer collab, but that&#x27;s only because it&#x27;s Hello Kitty). For one thing, they&#x27;re always super expensive, and I&#x27;m trying to ball on a budget over here. I&#x27;ve also heard mixed things from my friends — for the most part, they say they&#x27;re not super comfortable, although my roommate loves that it&#x27;s nice and firm and makes them sit up straighter. As someone who prefers soft, squishy chairs and mattresses, I&#x27;m not sold.
Yesterday I saw this TikTok come across my Twitter feed (man, what a 2022 sentence) and I thought the user @Kesswylie had a pretty good theory about why those good ol&#x27; g…</span>

                              <span>The RTX 3090 Ti is the fastest consumer graphics card Nvidia has ever made - but the rumoured imminent arrival of their RTX 4090 graphics card means that it&#x27;s now going for nearly £700 below its original £1879 UK RRP. In fact, you can now pick up one of these graphics cards for less than £1200, just £100 more than the launch price of the RTX 2080 Ti for around 75% more performance.

                              <span>The Razer Huntsman Mini Analog is one of a vanishingly small number of keyboards with analogue switches, meaning each key knows exactly how far down it&#x27;s being pressed. That unlocks the door to some unique capabilities, from adjusting the sensitivity of the keyboard on the fly to using the WASD keys as a thumbstick replacement in racing games. It&#x27;s also just a damn fine mechanical keyboard, with a comfortable 60% size, bright RGB lighting and premium PBT keycaps. 
You normally pay a lot for this kind of quality and functionality - £150, in fact - but today the keyboard has dropped to its lowest ever price of £97.94 over at Amazon UK.

                              <span>Keylocker is all about the rhythm. If you’re escaping a dystopian prison system where you can pay to upgrade to invisible handcuffs, your escape may as well have a jamming soundtrack. But you&#x27;ll have to bring your own, because the world in Keylocker hates that stuff. Like in Footloose, music is an illegal activity.

The latest such piece of kit is the display from a John Deere tractor, jailbroken and fragging away at demons at this past weekend’s DEF CON hacking conference in Las Vegas. The tractor computer was hacked by Sick Codes, who’s trying to draw attention to farming equipment manufacturers who lock down their products to prevent owners from repairing them.

Your reputation precedes you: before the accused can even sit down, they call out your unusual ability to hack into the minds of people to ‘patch’ their flaws, turning their nefarious intentions into fields of flowers. But it’s ok, isn’t it? After all, the person in front of you has committed a crime and must be rehabilitated; reckless driving, hit and run, and arson.


So, you get to work. Talking to Unid allows you to build a rapport and understand their motivations. You learn about their past. They talk of their difficult childhood, pets, a lack of support - broken systems that left them behind and put them on their current path. It doesn’t matter. You have a job to do. And now, with that bit of knowledge, you’ve found the &#x27;bug&#x27; in their programming. After initiating a hack on their brain, you eradicate this flaw, forcefully transforming their mind into a paradise of purity. Unid will never commit another crime again. Have you done the right thing?

                              <span>Instead of commanding a group of rugged, blood-soaked mercenaries on a turn-based death crawl through unimaginable horrors, how about a neo-Victorian circus troupe brawling with biomechatronic Londoners? That&#x27;s Circus Electrique, a turn-based RPG that&#x27;s much more lighthearted than its Darkest Dungeon counterpart (and seemingly main inspiration). But after playing a preview of the game’s first mission, there&#x27;s more than meets the eye in this part steampunk RPG, part circus tycoon management sim.
You play as Amelia, a young, bold journalist returning to London to cover the grand re-opening of the Circus Electrique. A metaphorical spanner gets lobbed into the works, however, as the ceremony is interrupted with news that London’s citizens have started attacking each other (more than your average fisticuffs to get on the tube). Oddly, this doesn’t seem to have affected Amelia and your motley circus troupe, who venture out into London’s dangerous streets to find answers.

                              <span>Spider-Man Remastered launched last Friday to decent reviews but gamers in Russia face problems buying from Steam.

                              <span>Developer KeokeN Interactive has delayed its upcoming adventure game Deliver Us Mars to next year. 
More specifically, the Red Planet sequel to Deliver Us The Moon will no longer be released on September 27 and will instead hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on February 2, 2023. That&#x27;s a delay of roughly four-ish months. As for why, KeokeN Interactive released a statement alongside the news, citing that the game needs more time to be the best it can possibly be.

More specifically, the showcase will begin at 1 p.m. PT/4 p.m. ET on Friday, Sept. 9, and will be hosted by Kinda Funny&#x27;s Blessing Adeoye Jr. It is set to feature &quot;incredible new content&quot; from Disney &amp; Pixar Games, Marvel Games, Lucasfilm Games, and 20th Century Games. This includes titles like Disney Dreamlight Valley, Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns, Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga, and even a &quot;sneak peek at the upcoming ensemble game from Skydance New Media.&quot;

You might recognize Skydance New Media as the studio where former Uncharted series director Amy Hennig works as president. Connecting those dots means the sneak peek at the upcoming ensemble game from Skydance New Media is the first sneak peek of Hennig&#x27;s new game, which she revealed as a narrative-driven, action-adventure game last year. 
Considering it&#x27;s an ensemble game, it could be any number of famous Marvel squads or families. However, it&#x27;s probably a safe bet to assume it won&#x27;t be the Avengers since Crystal Dynamic&#x27;s Avengers is only two years old and still getting updates. We also know it won&#x27;t be the Midnight Suns, as XCOM developer Firaxis is developing that. I&#x27;m hoping Hennig&#x27;s game is based on the X-Men, but since it&#x27;s an ensemble game, it could be something like the Inhumans, the Fantastic Four, or even the New Avengers, too. Only time will tell, but fortunately, we have less than a month of waiting to go because the Disney and Marvel Games Showcase airs on Sept. 9.

                              <span>Private Division, a publishing arm under the Take-Two Interactive umbrella, has signed a publishing agreement with Wētā Workshop to publish the studio’s new Lord of the Rings game. 
Wētā Workshop is the VFX studio behind The Lord of the Rings trilogy directed by Peter Jackson, and in 2014, it founded a video game division. That team is now developing a “new game set in the Middle-earth universe of J.R.R. Tolkien,” according to a press release. Middle-earth Enterprises has licensed the literary works of the series to Wētā Workshop, too, giving the studio “the broadest creative license to interpret the underlying lore of the books.” 
“We are thrilled to partner with Wētā Workshop to publish a game set in such an extraordinary and celebrated universe,” Private Division head Michael Worosz writes in a press release. “The Lord of the Rings IP is home to so many remarkable stories, and no entity is better equipped than the team at Wētā Workshop to create a distinctive, new Middle-earth gaming experience.” 
Wētā Workshop’s gaming lead, Amie Wolken, says it&#x27;s a privilege to create a new game set in Middle-earth, especially one that’s going to be “so different from what fans have played previously.” 
“As a fan ourselves, we’re excited for gamers to explore Middle-earth in a way they never have before, and introduce new fans to the magic of The Lord of the Rings,” Wolken writes in the press release. 
This new Lord of the Rings game does not yet have a title and is early in development. It doesn’t have a release date either, but it’s expected to launch sometime during Take-Two’s Fiscal Year 2024 (April 2023 - March 2024). 
While waiting to learn more about this game, check out the latest gameplay from The Lord of the Rings: Gollum, which was recently delayed out of its Sept. 1 release date by a few months. Watch this teaser from the upcoming Amazon Middle-earth TV show, The Lord of the Rings:​ The Rings of Power, after that.

The movie seems to be early in development, although it did land Takashi Doscher as its writer earlier this year, but we might have some new information about it straight from a recent interview with Stehelski. 
More specifically, Stehelski revealed to Collider that the movie might feature an entirely Japanese cast and that the film could be in Japanese. Plus, he says Sony is on board with the idea. Here’s what he had to say:
This sounds awesome, but with the project being so early in development, anything could change. It’s great to hear that Sony’s on board with the idea, though!

Set to launch sometime today, Season 1 will feature a healthy dose of content for the free-to-play stage fighter, although exactly what remains unknown. However, we do know that Morty from Rick and Morty will join the roster next week on Aug. 23. Beyond that, the studio says that new modes and content will be added to the game throughout the duration of Season 1.

Where it differs is that there are also a few glimpses of the Island Sanctuary, FFXIV&#x27;s new solo farming content. 

Watch it below ahead of the newly announced release date: August 23rd.

                              <span>Bungie has been permitted to seek overseas cooperation under the Hague Convention to obtain evidence on a Destiny 2 cheat seller. The developer filed a copyright lawsuit against the alleged operator of Lavicheats in 2021 but almost a year later progress is slow. In addition to conducting discovery in the US, Bungie has an eye on the UK but whether that will bear fruit is another question.

                              <span>Let’s rock, baby! Season 6 of Video Gameography gets stylish as we examine the Devil May Cry series! Over the next few weeks, we’ll be covering the history and lore of Capcom’s premiere action franchise, and this episode takes aim at the lauded yet somewhat polarizing Devil May Cry 4. 
Devil May Cry 4 took the series to a new generation of hardware, including Xbox for the first time. That&#x27;s only one of the many firsts for this entry. Capcom moved Dante aside to place newcomer Nero in the starring role, who brought his demon arm Devil Bringer as the new centerpiece mechanic. Dante wasn&#x27;t completely shunned, however; players control him during the adventure&#x27;s questionably designed back half. In this episode, we&#x27;ll discuss DMC 4&#x27;s bizarre 2005 reveal, Capcom&#x27;s reasoning behind Nero&#x27;s conception, the fan reaction to the Xbox launch, and what it&#x27;s really like to visit Fortuna&#x27;s inspiration, Vatican City. 
Join hosts Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7) and the returning host of The Great Game Debate podcast Wes Bates (@GreatGameDeb8), as we unpack Nero&#x27;s big debut.

For the past two decades, first under Bungie, then under 343 Industries, Halo has put on a master class of tone, pacing, and raw, punchy first-person gameplay. But perfection is non-existent; just as most every Halo game…

While privacy concerns are understandable, the subscribers themselves don&#x27;t appear to be at risk.

                              <span>Software sold by market leaders tend to be primary purchases for regular consumers. Brand comfort is important but so too is affordability, especially when pirate copies are available for free. Some find a middle ground with purchases of discounted activation keys but, as a new Microsoft lawsuit shows, that can amount to copyright infringement for buyers and sellers alike.

Gathered after a tragedy befalls our group, I attempt to calm down and plea that we should trust one another. Blood’s been spilled, and tensions are at an all-time high for this lost party of teens trapped in a dangerous land. That’s not quite the scene I had imagined going into Digimon Survive, a tactical RPG by way of a visual novel based on the sometimes-kid-friendly monster franchise. The dramatic dynamics at play are gripping, but the grid-based battles left me snoozing, souring what could have been a compelling, complete package.

                              <span>Standing here, I realize that this Super Replay will be a cut above the rest because we’ll be slicing and dicing in Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance! Join us today on Twitch at 3 p.m. Central to enjoy two hours of what will be a full playthrough of the cult favorite action game streaming weekly each Friday. 
Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance serves as a sequel/spin-off to Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots that puts cyborg ninja Raiden at the helm. Instead of sneaking around in boxes, players eviscerate foes in fast-paced, stylish action courtesy of developer Platinum Games. Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look. Will I acquire a new appreciation for the game nine years later? How many watermelons will I slice? You’ll have to tune in to find out. 
Watch on Twitch!
Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Andrew Reiner and Blake Hester, as we revisit Raiden’s beloved solo adventure. If you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes. You’ll also be granted entry to the official Game Informer Discord channel, where our welcoming community members, moderators, and staff gather to talk games, entertainment, food, and organize hangouts!</span>

                              <span>Developer Avalanche and publisher Warner Bros. Interactive have delayed Hogwarts Legacy to next year. 
More specifically, Hogwarts Legacy, originally due out sometime this year, will now hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on February 10, 2023. The game will make its way to Switch, too, but today&#x27;s announcement also came with the news that the Switch version will launch at a later date.

Hogwarts Legacy was originally due out in 2021 before it was delayed to 2022. Now, it&#x27;s coming in 2023.

Read about how controversial Harry Potter creator JK Rowling is not involved with the making of Hogwarts Legacy (although she will certainly be getting money as a direct result of this game).</span>

                              <span>Infinity Ward has released a TikTok (it’s a new world) that shows some of its developers discussing a new map in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 called Farm 18, as reported by Eurogamer. 
The map will probably fall into the medium-sized range of Call of Duty maps, and that’s because it’s one part a level set in an abandoned and overgrown cement factory and another part, Shoothouse, the popular level from 2019’s Call of Duty: Modern Warfare. Of course, it’s not a 1-to-1 recreation, but Infinity Ward says Farm 18’s center, which is a large shoot house, was inspired by Modern Warfare’s Shoothouse.
Check it out for yourself below:

As you can see, the map looks like it’s going to be a great time. Players looking to play it safe can stick to the outside, using the overgrown brush to conceal them while stalking the level’s perimeter. Those looking for a riskier fight can head into the central warehouse, where they’ll find themselves in the Shoothouse-inspired part of Farm 18.

In it, you play a small stubby astronaut who dreams of hitting it big as an intergalactic property developer. Man, they really took the phrase &#x27;colony sim&#x27; to its literal extreme, didn&#x27;t they? Are we sure that isn&#x27;t Tom Nook under the helmet there? The proportions defintiely seem right, is all I&#x27;m saying. I just hope the rent you end up charging isn&#x27;t... astronommical. Sorry. Here&#x27;s the reveal trailer.

As you&#x27;d expect, it does not go terribly well. But hey, it looks like it makes for a pretty good time.

                              <span>Three Fields Entertainment are responsible for lots of games with &quot;dangerous&quot; in their title: Dangerous Driving, Danger Zone, and Dangerous Golf. But now they&#x27;ve got a new racing game in the works which eschews their previous naming convention for something that&#x27;ll make you say with a wry smile and a shake of the head, &quot;I see what you did there&quot;. It&#x27;s called Wreckreation (you know, like &#x27;recreation&#x27;, not Wreck-reaction, or Wreck–eation) and its reveal trailer looks a bit like if Burnout and Hot Wheels went for a joyride together.

                              <span>What qualifies as a &quot;next-gen&quot; RTS game? Is it shinier graphics? More in-depth tactical choices? Well, Ghostrunner and Graven devs Slipgate Ironworks hope to provide an answer with their latest real-time tactics base-building game, Tempest Rising. Revealed earlier this evening during THQ Nordic&#x27;s summer showcase, Tempest Rising is a retro-inspired strategy game where you&#x27;ll take control of three factions fighting for a rare mineral. And yep, that mineral is called &#x27;Tempest&#x27;. Here&#x27;s the reveal trailer.

                              <span>As many of you well know, I rather enjoyed cat adventure Stray recently. As an owner of two tortoiseshells myself, it was right up my alley. I do, however, have a confession to make. When I started seeing other real life cats enjoying the game alongside their respective humans, I began to feel sad and a bit left out. You see, my cats Maple and Midna (still!) haven&#x27;t shown any interest in Stray whatsoever, not even flicking up their ears in response to the cat&#x27;s in-game meow. I&#x27;m not gonna lie, it kinda broke my heart a little bit.
However, I&#x27;m beginning to think their (clear and apparent) hatred of video games goes further than simple disinterest. I was playing A Plague Tale for the first time last week, a game famous for its swarms of screeching rats, and STILL nothing. They love hunting rats and bringing them home to leave as little presents for us on our back door step. Heck, they&#x27;ll even wig out and go into prowl mode when they hear them scrabbling away underneath our floorboards (yes, we do have a rat problem in our house). But clearly, their ice cold little murder hearts are unmoved by their video game equivalents. Is this what it&#x27;s like when your children reject your hobbies and go and sulk in their rooms for the rest of the day? Because it sure does feel like it.

                              <span>&quot;Metroidvania&quot; is a terrible phrase that gets in the way of its own definition and I hate it.


It does, however, still apply to Zapling Bygone. Describing it in less mechanical terms could make it sound creepy. You&#x27;re a spore of an all-consuming hivemind, dropped on an unfamiliar planet to assimilate it. You move by skittering about on wobbly green tentacles, leaping and climbing and clinging and lashing out at living things with them, then absorbing the green muck that bursts out, and periodically consuming a creature powerful enough to be worth assimilating. And wearing its skull in the centre of your tentacle mass, because why not.

                              <span>FIFA 23&#x27;s Ultimate Team mode will follow previous games by including loot boxes, EA have confirmed. In the past few years, several studies have linked loot boxes with gambling, and several European countries have moved to regulate them. In a statement given to Eurogamer, EA said that Ultimate Team packs are &quot;a part of FIFA that players love&quot; and that &quot;Giving players the choice to spend if they want to is fair.&quot;

                              <span>This is a bit different from what we normally cover, but I was going to order this for myself and thought it might be of interest to you, dear reader, as well. Anyway, you can get ten years&#x27; worth of AA batteries - 100 in total! - for just £13 at Amazon right now. This normally costs £18, so that&#x27;s a nice little savings - and of course it&#x27;s far cheaper per item than buying batteries in smaller packs.

                              <span>The Crucial X8 is our favourite portable SSD, thanks to its compact protective frame, convenient USB-A or USB-C connection and excellent performance. It&#x27;s capable of transfer speeds up to 1050MB/s, minimising the time it takes to copy files to and from the drive, and offers low enough access times that you can easily run games from it too. It normally costs around £85, but today it&#x27;s dropped to a historic low price of £77 - a great value for a portable NVMe SSD offering this level of performance.

You can&#x27;t deal with losing it now. Oh god, let it stay there. Not now. Please, not now. But it happened (of course it did!). And you know what? You&#x27;re okay.

Co-developers Insomniac Games and Nixxes, who spoke to me this week about the port&#x27;s development, have also taken the care to festoon this version of the open-world crim-puncher with various Windows-exclusive features. These span enhanced ray traced reflections and ultrawide monitor support to both Nvidia DLSS and (surprisingly, given it wasn’t in the initial PC features trailer) AMD FSR 2.0, adding to a list of visual options that already stretches into the sky like a Manhattan high rise. Let’s take a look, then, at how Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered performs on PC – as well as the best settings to keep it swingin’ real smooth like.

As a counterpoint to the episode on the nicest blokes to hang out with in games, we&#x27;ve decided to talk about our most hated NPCs (a bonus prize to anyone who can guess which is the one we all say first). It&#x27;s an interesting one to discuss, because the line between intentionally annoying and unintentionally annoying can be very thin. Plus everyone tends to find different things annoying. Disclaimer: you are not annoying, any similarities you have to characters we find annoying are coincidental.

                              <span>In a year riddled with delays, Metal Slug Tactics is the latest game to slip into next year. Publisher Dotemu has announced that the tactical spin-off of the popular shoot &#x27;em up needs more time to come together and will launch in 2023.
The tweet, embedded below, doesn’t elaborate more than that. We haven&#x27;t heard much of a peep about the game since its reveal last summer, making us wonder if a delay was on the horizon.
Marco, Eri, Fio, and Tarma are tinkering away to make #MetalSlugTactics as explosive as possible on release, but the squad needs a bit more time in the shop to prepare for the battles ahead. See you in 2023! @LeikirStudio x @Dotemu

Metal Slug Tactics was one of the pleasant surprises of E3 2021. The game, developed by Leikir Studio, transforms the series’ explosive run-and-gun action into a tile-based tactics experience that retains Metal Slug’s signature style and tone. Although turn-based, units still wield classic Metal Slug weapons and can be improved by unlocking abilities and perks on a skill tree.
We’ll have to wait a while longer to see how well Metal Slug translates to this new template. When it does arrive, it will be available on Switch and PC.</span>

It seems cool, so I&#x27;ll play it with former Associate Editor John Carson today!
We&#x27;re going live at 2:00 p.m. Central on our Twitch page, and then I&#x27;ll upload it to the Game Informer YouTube channel afterward. See you soon.</span>

Your followers’ faith in your cult drives everything in Cult of the Lamb. If you fail to keep them fed and happy, or if you decline their sub-quests too much, or even simply neglect to clean up their poop, their faith will drop. Any kind of wrongdoing, neglect, or slight against them, can cause them to lose faith in y…</span>

                              <span>Nightingale, the Victorian first-person survival action game, has had its early access launch pushed to the first half of 2023. The game is the debut by Inflexion Games, a team consisting of former Bioware developers, including ex-general manager Aaron Flynn. 
In a message posted to Twitter, Inflexion explains it delayed the launch for two reasons. One, it’s migrating the game to Unreal Engine 5. Two, it needs the extra time to ensure it&#x27;s polished and packed with content before players can begin testing it out. You can read Inflexion&#x27;s full message below (click the image to enlarge). 
Nightingale debuted during The Game Awards 2021 and is a PvE crafting and survival game that can be played alone or in co-op. Players find themselves stranded in a Victorian Gaslamp fantasy world connected by a network of portals. To survive, they’ll have to harvest materials such as wood and ore to construct weapons, equipment, and buildings. Jumping through portals transports players to new biomes such as deserts, swamps, and jungles. Nightingale’s appearance during this year’s Summer Game Fest introduced Realm Cards used to unlock new areas and influence the type of content, such as enemies and resources, they contain. 
So far, Nightingale is only confirmed to launch for PC via Steam.</span>

                              <span>Developer PanicBarn and publisher No More Robots are working on a &quot;comedy open-world RPG&quot; where you save the world with a magic soccer ball. Soccer Story is slated to release later this year for PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Switch, PC, and Stadia.
Your role in Soccer Story begins one year after an event called The Calamity, which apparently has made soccer illegal. A magic soccer ball chooses you to be the so-called Savior of Soccer, a role that will also help heal the world.
No More Robots states Soccer Story delivers over 15 hours of gameplay unfolding through story-based missions and side activities. You&#x27;ll apparently square off against sharks, toddlers, old-age pensioners, and ninjas as you complete these tasks and solve puzzles using the ball.
In addition to the single-player campaign, Soccer Story features a four-player local multiplayer mode, with each team led by an animal captain.
Soccer Story is not developed by SideBar Games, the team behind the wonderful Golf Story title, but it does appear to draw plenty of inspiration from it, including the name.

                              <span>For weeks now, leaks and rumors have pointed to a Dragon Ball Z collaboration happening with Epic Games&#x27; battle royale, Fortnite. Now, such a crossover has been officially confirmed. 
Today, the official Fortnite Twitter account tweeted out an image of Shenron floating high above the battle island with a caption that says, &quot;Speak. Name your wish...8.16.2022.&quot; Check it out for yourself below:

As you can see, it seems Epic Games will finally unveil the Dragon Ball Z content coming to Fortnite next Tuesday. As for what to expect, that remains officially unknown, but leaks (and, let&#x27;s be honest, a solid guess) point to skins of popular Dragon Ball Z characters such as Goku and Vegeta and DBZ-specific pickups too. Only time will tell, but fortunately, we don&#x27;t have to wait too much longer now. 
Prepare your wallets.

                              <span>Nintendo has released a brand new trailer for Kirby&#x27;s Dream Buffet that showcases many of the minigames we&#x27;ll be partaking in when the game hits Switch. 
And speaking of Switch, today&#x27;s overview trailer reveals that Kirby&#x27;s Dream Buffet is out next week, on Wednesday, Aug. 17. That&#x27;s exciting, especially considering this game was only just announced last month. The trailer details the main progression of games in Kirby&#x27;s Dream Buffet, as well as important ways to strategize using Kirby&#x27;s different copy abilities. 
Check it out for yourself below: 


As you can see, Kirby&#x27;s Dream Buffet is shaping up to be an adorably cute time (not to mention, a hunger-inducing one too).

Warner Bros. has given new studio Player First Games some of its most popular characters to carve out space in the Smash Bros.-dominated IP-crossover-fighter genre. MultiVersus succeeds where others have failed, but it still has some growing to do.
Though LeBron James appears on the roster thanks to his starring role in Space Jam: A New Legacy, the WB roster in MultiVersus doesn’t feel as icky as the roster of that film. Each character is treated with reverence, creating a world where you eventu…</span>

A Reddit user claims to have leaked plot summaries for every single episode, noting that two account suspensions by Reddit add credibility to those leaks. Documents obtained by TorrentFreak suggest another incoming credibility boost - via HBO&#x27;s lawyers in California.

                              <span>How much gaming monitor can you get for £100? Not much, it turns out - but I did spot something unexpected for £10 more: a genuine ultra-wide monitor. Now, it&#x27;s not a stunner as far as looks go, and it&#x27;s not got the latest specs either. But what it has got is an expansive 25-inch span, a 2560x1080 resolution and a blistering refresh rate of... 75Hz. OK, so it&#x27;s far from the best gaming monitor on the planet, but getting an IPS monitor of this size is honestly not bad going - especially as it&#x27;s been reduced from a UK RRP of £170.

                              <span>I was a bit sad when Square Enix announced last month that PC players would be missing out on the first demo for their upcoming strategy game The DioField Chronicle, but happily the RPG giant has reconsidered their tactical options and released it on Steam after all. The move coincides with pre-orders also going live, but the good news is that your save data, progress and character levels from the demo will all transfer over to the final game should you decide to take the plunge in full when the game comes out on September 22nd.

                              <span>Last time, you decided that cameras which actually take pictures are better than running into a wall so fast you hurt yourself. Immersive sims shudder in revulsion from this outcome (but sadly don&#x27;t take damage from their vibration). Cameras won by only eight votes, so you&#x27;d better join in if you feel strongly about this week&#x27;s face-off. And this one might involve taking a face... off. What&#x27;s better: nude mods, or going into guts and meat?

                              <span>Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered is the latest ex-PlayStation exclusive to rock up on PC, following a collaborative effort between original developers Insomniac Games and porting specialists Nixxes. It’s also a skyscape-swinging, baddie-decking good time, so says Alice Bee’s review, and one that comes with plenty of special features just for the Windows version. I’ll be posting a more performance-and-hardware-focused guide to it later this week, but in the meantime I called up Jurjen Katsman, founder and senior director of development at Nixxes, and Mike Fitzgerald, core technology director at Insomniac, for a chat about how Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered makes the jump to PC.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve played a lot of Spider-Man games. To this day I nurture the belief that all tutorials should be narrated by Bruce Campbell. I even played Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions, which had four different web-dudes and later inspired the Spider-Verse storyline in the comics. Point is, I&#x27;m standing on pretty solid ground to judge Spider-Man games. Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man, originally released onto Sonyboxes in 2018, is finally coming to PC in a Remastered form, and let me tell you: it is a great Spidey game.

You know Spider-Man. He&#x27;s a dude named Peter Parker who was bitten by a radioactive spider and can now climb up walls and punch criminals really well. Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man Remastered lets you roleplay being Spidey against the backdrop of a big, living New York city. It is, if you&#x27;ll excuse the pun, amazing. Now, is it the best Spidey game? Nah. I reckon that&#x27;s its spin-off/sequel Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man: Miles Morales, but that&#x27;s not on PC yet. This means Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man gets to be the best wall-crawler game on PC for another few months, which isn&#x27;t a bad consolation prize.

                              <span>When Sony revealed that Spider-Man Remastered was headed to PC earlier this year, I became fixated with the idea that the game would potentially work on the Steam Deck. I mean, it worked on a base PS4, right? By my understanding the Steam Deck is basically just a PS4 with a screen slapped on it, so surely portable Spider-Manning wasn&#x27;t an unrealistic thing to expect?
After spending a few days testing out the game on the Deck I&#x27;m thrilled to confirm that Spider-Man Remastered plays great on Valve&#x27;s handheld with only a few very minor caveats. Hooray! I can finally punch a Vulture in my back garden without getting shouted at by local bird protection services. What a time to be alive.

                              <span>A bright sun heralds the start of day 37 for CultPaperShotgun. Katharine wakes up and immediately sets to work cleaning up the mountains of poop and vomit puddles left over from the previous night&#x27;s revelries. As she works, she spies her good friend Alice B harvesting cauliflowers from the cult&#x27;s garden, trying to keep as far as possible away from the (now slightly rotting) corpse of Graham that lays nearby. A cluster of other followers are busy dancing around a shrine in the centre of the village, but they all stop to witness a fight between the two oldest members of the cult - Alice0 and Liam. Ritual combat of the elderly is a staple of CultPaperShotgun, and as Alice0 delivers the final blow to an ailing Liam, cries of euphoria reverberate about the camp as his spirit (and chunks of flesh) are donated to the cause.
Where am I in all this, you ask? I, the Lamb, the glorious leader of our cult, the holy vessel of Death itself, and the sworn enemy of the Bishops of the Old Faith that are destined soon to die by my blade? I&#x27;m kicking back at a nearby camp, enjoying a spot of fishing and a friendly game of Knucklebones.
This, friends, is Cult Of The Lamb. And it is excellent.

                              <span>Some of the early trailers for Forspoken, a Squeenix action-adventure/RPG epic coming in January, suggested portentious world-saving stuff. This is a different vibe to a clip shared on Forspoken&#x27;s offical Twitter this week, which featured main character Frey Holland doing a &quot;Yup, that&#x27;s me!&quot; kind of elevator pitch for the game. A lot of people on the birdsite took an instant, vehement dislike to Frey&#x27;s dialogue, and were just as instantly sure who to blame for the peachy keen quiplashing, even if by proxy. Yes, Joss Whedon strikes again.

                              <span>You know when a game instantly charms the socks off you the moment you first clap eyes on it? Point and click puzzler Lost In Play is one of those games for me. Its vibrant cartoon visuals immediately caught my attention when I first sampled its Steam Next Fest demo earlier in the year, and I&#x27;m happy to report that the full game, out today, is just as captivating as it was back then. 
It tells the tale of Toto and Gal, a pair of rambunctious siblings who end up far from home after getting lost inside a fantasy world of their own imagining. If they don&#x27;t find a way back before nightfall, though, they&#x27;ll be stuck there forever. A classic kids adventure story, in other words, but one that really relishes in its own sense of playfulness. Over the course of their four-odd hour adventure, they&#x27;ll meet monster fighting frogs in a dark forest, board game-playing seagulls on the high seas, orc mechanics in a vast desert and even a heavy-metal loving sheep on a floating island in the sky as they make their way home  to their messy childhood bedroom. It all makes for some memorable puzzling backdrops, but be warned: if you&#x27;re planning to play this with little ones, then you&#x27;ll definitely need a puzzle savvy adult in the mix, as some of its brainteasers aren&#x27;t quite as child-friendly as you might expect.

                              <span>We&#x27;ll soon return to the weird and wonderful world of Cosmo D&#x27;s Off-Peak City, with the next game in the series today announcing a shiny release date of September 9th. Betrayal At Club Low is the name, and an RPG infiltrating a former coffin factory-turned-nightclub is its game. This time, Cosmo D says he&#x27;s inspired by one-shot indie RPGs as we roll dice, bake pizzas, and try to help an undercover agent escape.

As of today, Farthest Frontier is now in early access.

                              <span>Snow Blind, the next installment in the Mortal Kombat Legends animated film series, got its first trailer today ahead of its October release. The new movie tells the origin story of Kenshi, who tags up with Sub-Zero to kombat Outworld&#x27;s usual suspects and keep the peace (or as peaceful as this universe can get). 
The film explores how Kenshi loses his eyesight and trains to become the master swordfighter that fans have loved since his debut in Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance. Kenshi’s goal: take down a fully cybernetic Kano and his Black Dragon clan. Kenshi has another ace up his sleeve in the form of a powerful ally (?) in Sub-Zero. Some of the characters that appear include Shang Tsung and Kabal and even lesser seen faces like Tremor and Kira. 


Snow Blind is the third Mortal Kombat Legends film following 2021’s Battle of the Realms and 2020’s Scorpion’s Revenge. It will be available on digital storefronts on October 9 and on Blu-ray October 11. Personally, I&#x27;m excited to see where it winds up landing on my ranking of every Mortal Kombat on-screen adaptation.</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m recovering from my recent trip to Las Vegas for EVO – the long-standing fighting game championship that invites competitors worldwide. The event is home to vendors, artists, demos for upcoming fighting games, and massive stages where only the best compete in front of thousands of fighting game fans. While on-site for the event, former Game Informer editor John Carson and I traveled to the top floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort with a camera to meet the Arcade1Up folks and play the recently announced Marvel Vs. Capcom 2 cabinet for ourselves. 
Here&#x27;s the video: 


If you&#x27;re looking for more information on the Marvel Vs. Capcom 2 Arcade1Up cabinet, read our news story about the announcement. Here&#x27;s a snippet:
One of the most beloved fighting games of all time is finally getting the Arcade1Up treatment. Marvel vs. Capcom 2, the legendary crossover extravaganza from 2000, is the latest game featured by the replica arcade cabinet company. 
Marvel vs. Capcom 2 gathers 56 playable heroes and villains from both Marvel and Capcom&#x27;s robust catalogs of characters in an over-the-top 3v3 fighting game. In addition to giving you something approximating the original arcade experience through this replica cabinet, the Arcade1Up release also features online play via Wi-Fi.</span>

I loved Animal Crossing: New Horizons back in 2020, but its premise wasn’t enough to keep me engaged over time. Designing my island and keeping all of the villagers on it happy was thoroughly enjoyable, but after a few dozen hours, I craved a new type of gameplay to coincide with what I was doing each day. Cult of the Lamb, a mish-mash of adorably cute animals, critters, and creatures and macabre cult-isms, remedies that issue with an expansive action-combat dungeon system. I only wish its base building provided …</span>

To this point, Splatoon 3 has drip-fed players with new information about new weapons, music, and even a special Switch OLED model and Pro Controller themed after the highly anticipated family-friendly shooter. However, now that Splatoon 3 is the next major release on the Switch&#x27;s release calendar, Nintendo officially opened the flood gates this morning with a wealth of information through a special Nintendo Direct all about the ink-covered shooter. 
Splatoon 3 leaves behind Inkopolis in favor of Splatsville, which is out in the heart of the Splatlands. Splatsville is a growing city that has rece…</span>

                              <span>After weeks of videos individually showcasing Gotham Knights’ Nightwing, Robin, and Batgirl, it’s Jason Todd’s turn in the spotlight. A new trailer shows off Red Hood’s brutal, more supernatural approach to battling the Court of Owls.
The in-engine footage showed off the former Robin’s deadly competency with firearms as well his Lazarus Pit-induced powers, such as his spectral leaping ability. We also get a look at a unique cosmetic skin featuring a horned helmet that gives off serious Darth Maul vibes. 


We&#x27;ll see how the Bat family manages on its own when Gotham Knights swoops in on October 25 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</span>

                              <span>We learned in June during the Xbox &amp; Bethesda Games Showcase that Persona 5 Royal would be coming to Xbox consoles alongside Persona 4 Golden and Persona 3 Portable. 
With an official Xbox Series X/S version of the game coming out on Oct. 21, and the remastered version set to hit other consoles then too, we’re just a few months away from seeing what the full JRPG looks like running on a new-gen console. Now we have our best look yet, featuring Persona 5 Royal running at 60 FPS on an Xbox Series X, thanks to Faz on YouTube, as reported by Video Games Chronicle. 
Check it out for yourself below: 


As you can see, Persona 5 Royal looks wildly different running at 60 FPS. Personally, and this is shocking for me to say, I think I prefer it running at 30 FPS. I was chatting with a friend about this last night, but the animation of the game and its general art style lend themselves well to 30 FPS. This remastered 60 FPS look almost takes away some of the shine from the game, giving characters and enemies a matte-like finish. Perhaps it will look better in the final release, but right now, I think I will stick to my PlayStation 4 version.

                              <span>Two Point Campus opened its door today, and we think it’s pretty darn good. But what does a real college professor think? Sega answers this burning question by releasing a video of a qualified educator putting the simulator through its paces. 
Sega enlisted Tracy Fullerton, professor, and director of the game innovation lab at the Univerity of Southern California Games, to enroll in Two Point Campus and react to its zany brand of higher education. Besides providing a nice look at the moment-to-moment gameplay for those curious about the title, it&#x27;s fun to listen to Fullerton&#x27;s takes as both a game maker and a college professor. Check it out below. 


You can judge Two Point Campus for yourself on PlayStation and Xbox (including Game Pass), Switch, and PC.</span>

                              <span>Elden Ring&#x27;s patch 1.06 offers dozens of small tweaks that should make your journey across The Land Between just a little easier. The biggest of the changes are to how summoning works, but there are also tweaks to quests, attack speeds, and bug fixes that&#x27;ll maybe not make you die less, but will at least make your deaths fairer.

                              <span>Update: the Iskur XL appears to be out of stock at Amazon and now back at a more regular price of £490. Original article follows below: 
The XL version of the Razer Iskur gaming chair is down to £287, nearly half the price it is on Razer&#x27;s official website and an all-time historic low price. Curiously, it&#x27;s also nearly £230 cheaper than the regular size version! Katharine reviewed that Iskur previously and rated it highly, so if this size fits you then this is a nice chance to pick it up at a very fair price.

                              <span>Peter is a guy with his head in the clouds. Literally. Well, sort of. A climate science lecturer at Cambridge University, Peter&#x27;s great passion in life is cloud research. All he wants to do is study clouds: their different formations, their flight paths, their properties, everything. He finds them so fascinating that they&#x27;re the subject of his 100-page PhD thesis. It’s a poetic subject and one that matches his temperament as a boyish and awkward researcher. But around him the world is spiralling from the political tensions of the Cold War, and as much as Peter wishes to escape to in the clouds, current events are keeping him firmly tethered to the realities of an impending war. 
It’s this tension that makes South Of The Circle such an engrossing story. With player choices that subtly tug the game’s narrative needle in ways you might not expect, it&#x27;s clear skies and fair winds for the game’s three-hour journey. But with an abrupt ending after a calculated slow-burn drama, it&#x27;s a rough landing.

                              <span>A lawsuit filed last year by several Hollywood studios and Netflix targeting illegal streaming veteran PrimeWire now resembles a war of attrition. As efforts to gather intelligence and seize domains continue, the studios have also been dealing with PrimeWire replacement &#x27;HydraWire&#x27;. But despite the numerous hurdles, all signs point to the plaintiffs toughing the case out for as long as it takes.

                              <span>Embark Studios, a young team of former DICE employees led by ex-EA head Patrick Söderlund, has delayed its upcoming shooter, Arc Raiders. The title was initially slated to arrive this year but will now launch in 2023. 
The reason is that the team has decided to pivot and focus on launching another team-based shooter codenamed Project Discovery. A blog post written by Söderlund explains that Embark has several projects in development and that Discovery progressed so quickly that it seemingly caught up to Arc Raiders, presenting the team with the possibility of shipping two games within the same timeframe. However, doing would&#x27;ve been more than the small team can handle. 
“For a young, relatively small studio like ours, releasing two games in short succession would have strained our teams and resources, many of which are shared between the two projects.” Söderlund explains. 
“As such, we decided to let Project Discovery be our studio’s first game to market, pushing Arc Raiders to a 2023 release. It’s a decision that will also allow us to expand and refine the Arc Raiders experience.”
Outside of being a team-based first-person shooter, little is known about Project Discovery. The concept art posted above hints that it&#x27;s set in the current day or perhaps the near future. Söderlund promises to reveal more details “very soon.” 
Arc Raiders made its debut during the 2021 Game Awards and will be a free-to-play cooperative shooter where players work together to battle mechanical creatures from space. It will launch for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</span>

                              <span>To say that Sonic the Hedgehog 2 was successful would be an understatement. The highest-grossing video game film in U.S. history already had a confirmed threequel in the works, but today we found out exactly when we&#x27;ll see Sonic and friends return to the big screen, and it’ll be chillier than usual.
The official movie Twitter account announced the unofficially titled Sonic the Hedgehog 3 will premiere in theaters on December 20, 2024. This marks a big seasonal shift for the franchise as Sonic 1 and 2 arrived during the first halves of their respective years, with the first movie premiering on Valentine&#x27;s Day and the second arriving in April.

The tweet doesn’t reveal anything else about the film, but if you’ve seen the post-credits scene for Sonic 2, you already have a good inkling of where the series is headed. 
December 2024 is a long way off, but Paramount plans to fill the gap with a live-action series starring Idris Elba’s Knuckles hitting Paramount+ next year. There’s also Sonic Prime, Netflix’s animated series that, while disconnected from the film universe, provides another avenue to enjoy the Blue Blur on the small screen. With the next big video game, Sonic Frontiers, slated to launch this fall, the next few years look pretty bright for Sega&#x27;s mascot.

                              <span>Join host Wesley LeBlanc as he rides solo today to showcase a quick glimpse of You Suck At Parking, an upcoming racer with a very unique twist. Instead of racing to a finish line, your objective is stop...in the marked parking stop.  
Stopping in a parking spot might sound easy but as you&#x27;ll soon find out, it&#x27;s anything but because each track is littered with obstacles such as barriers that immediately destroy your car, magnets aiming to pull you off the track, boosters, jump pads, and more. You must survive through it all in order to reach the coveted parking spot at the end of the road. 
Check it out for yourself in the New Gameplay Today below: 


Enjoy this first look at You Suck At Parking as Wesley briefly introduces you to the world of the game before taking a back seat to let you enjoy some uninterrupted gameplay (that&#x27;s harder than it looks so when you see me die a bunch of times, no you didn&#x27;t). You Suck At Parking is slated to launch sometime this year on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.

                              <span>The Sonic the Hedgehog franchise may have turned 30 years old last year, but the party is still going for some. We already knew additional Sonic-themed costumes were planned for Fall Guys this month, but developer Mediatonic this morning announced the details of the collaboration event with Sega&#x27;s iconic brand. The event is meant to celebrate over 30 years of Sonic the Hedgehog and includes a new Sonic-themed level and new outfits. 
The new level is called &quot;Bean Hill Zone&quot; and tasks the Fall Guys beans with collecting as many rings as possible to win special rewards. If players earn 200 points, they get a &quot;Bean Hill Zone&quot; nameplate. Earning 400 points yields 200 kudos, 600 points get a Bonus Rings Pattern outfit, 800 points gives 400 kudos, and 1,000 points gives you access to Sonic&#x27;s iconic sneakers.
Those aren&#x27;t the only rewards you can snatch up during this event, though. New costumes for Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, Super Sonic, and Dr. Robotnik are all available in the store during the event. You can also buy the Sonic Foot Tap emote.
This isn&#x27;t Sonic&#x27;s first appearance in Fall Guys as a costume. Back in 2020, players could pick up this Sonic costume. This special Fall Guys event featuring Sonic the Hedgehog begins on Thursday, August 11, and runs until Monday, August 15.
Fall Guys originally launched on PlayStation 4 and PC, where it found overwhelming success as a fun gameshow-style twist on the battle royale genre, in 2020. In 2021, publisher Epic Games acquired Fall Guys developer Mediatonic. Earlier this summer, Fall Guys changed from a premium model to a free-to-play model, and launched on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and Switch.</span>

                              <span>Join host Wesley LeBlanc as he takes you through a full mission in Square Enix&#x27;s upcoming real-time tactical RPG, The DioField Chronicle. Not only will you be getting a glimpse at what combat in the game looks like, but he gives you a brief glimpse of what you&#x27;re doing in The DioField Chronicle when you&#x27;re not in a battle. 
Developed by Lancarse and Square Enix, this RPG is aiming to feel unique amongst a sea of other tactical RPGs by infusing real-time combat into its formula. So while you are controlling units on a battlefield, you&#x27;re watching their moves play out in real-time, and you must adjust your classic tried-and-true TRPG strategies to match it. 
Check it out for yourself below: 


Enjoy this first look at The DioField Chronicle as Wesley walks you through one full expedition in the game before showing you around the main palace that acts as your home base. The demo showcased here takes place completely within Chapter 1 so if you&#x27;re worried about spoilers, you should be alright. The DioField Chronicle hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on Sept. 22.

                              <span>Marvel’s Midnight Suns, the upcoming card-based strategy RPG by Firaxis, as been hit with its second delay. A Take-Two earnings report revealed that the game had been pushed out of its October 7 date to an unspecified release within the 2023 fiscal year. That means it will now arrive sometime before March 31, 2023.
The game’s Twitter account confirmed the delay with a message, embedded below, that also revealed that the game will now have a staggered release. Midnight Suns will come to PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC first within the fiscal year. The PS4, Xbox One, and Switch versions arrive sometime after that.

While Midnight Suns will only face a five-month setback at most (for current-gen, at least) and could technically still arrive in 2022, seeing it suffer another delay is disappointing nonetheless. The game was first announced almost a year ago at last year’s Gamescom. It graced Game Informer’s cover that month and was first scheduled to launch this March before being delayed to October. A reimagining of the Rise of the Midnight Sons comic event, players control a team of occult heroes like Blade, Magik, and Nico Minoru and Avengers like Iron Man, Captain America, and Spider-Man to battle Lilith, the mother of all demons. Midnight Suns&#x27; turn-based combat utilizes a card system for selecting commands, and between battles players explore a headquarters where they can socialize and bond with their teammates. 
We played the first four hours of Marvel’s Midnight Suns in June and wrote up seven takeaways based on our time with it. You can also watch us battle Venom as Spider-Man and other heroes in this episode of New Gameplay Today.</span>

Nyní se většinou nastavuje hostname až v user-space, případně při překladu jádra ( CONFIG_DEFAULT_HOSTNAME). Jsou ale některé případy, kdy je potřeba hostname ještě před přimoutováním /. Například mdadm potřebuje hostname a porovnává ho se záznamem homehost pro rozlišení lokálního pole a dočasně připojeného cizího pole.</span>

                              <span>I don&#x27;t spend a ton of time testing gaming laptops these days, but one of my recent favourites was the Zephyrus G14. This laptop is slim and compact, yet sports a brilliant 14-inch 2560x1600 120Hz display, a powerful RX 6700S graphics card and a top-end Ryzen 9 6900HS processor. This is backed with a 1TB NVMe SSD and 16GB of DDR5 RAM (!!), an impressive loadout that uses basically the fastest and latest-gen components you can fit into a laptop of this size. 
Today Best Buy in the US are doing a great price on this spec of the Zephyrus G14, charging $1399.99 for it rather than the launch price of $1649.99 - a $250 reduction. That&#x27;s the best price we&#x27;ve seen for this model and an awesome deal on a compact yet powerful all-AMD laptop.

                              <span>Graphics cards are falling in price rapidly, and nowhere is this more true than on the bleeding-edge end of the market. After seeing discounts on AMD&#x27;s first 6000-series graphics cards last month, we&#x27;re now also seeing deep cuts to the more recent 6X50 models - including the subject of this piece, the Radeon RX 6950 XT. This particular card is the very fastest that AMD make, and offers rasterised performance on par with Nvidia&#x27;s RTX 3090 and 3090 Ti.
Today, it&#x27;s been discounted to £850 at Scan, a big reduction from its original UK RRP of £1065 earlier this year.

                              <span>You might remember that I couldn’t beat Spelunky 2&#x27;s first stage, no matter how hard I tried. Well, I&#x27;m proud to announce that my fortunes have since changed and that I&#x27;ve bested it. I should say &quot;we&quot;, as my achievement was aided by a co-op pal, and the only person on Earth patient enough to accompany such a terrible Spelunker. We even reached the first boss, and the level after that! Before we both got splatted by an anti-gravity zombie-puppet-that-lives-underwater.
Aside from my – our – achievements, I learned that the game is a perfect measurement of fatigue. Where rulers calculate distance or Ollie&#x27;s highly scientific WIPERS precipitation system measured the best rain in games, Spelunky 2 is the ultimate tool for accurately determining just how tired someone is.

                              <span>After five weeks, 12 posts, 14 games, and 11,146 words, my cycling tour of PC gaming ended on Friday. I&#x27;ve crossed the active warzones of GTA Online and PUBG, stunted down murderous descents in extreme sports games, tried to learn serious bike race tactics in strategy games, gone for a weird ride in a walking simulator, and even needed to ride my real bike for a game powered by Strava. For your convenience and enjoyment, that&#x27;s now all gathered here with some bonus bike thoughts.

                              <span>Is it lazy to describe Turbo Golf Racing as ‘Rocket League if the cars were playing golf instead of football?&#x27; A bit, yes. But it’s also largely accurate. Up to eight players race across a track, ramming their boost-enabled car into their huge futuristic golf ball to send it flying forwards until (depending on your skill or luck) it flies/rolls/plops anticlimactically into the big hole at the end. It’s golf, sort of, but fast, demanding, and often unpredictable. You don’t even have to wear silly trousers while playing it, but that’s just my personal choice.
Of course, it’s not quite so simple as hitting your ball forward and relying on the videogame gods to deem your ball worthy of reaching the goal before everybody else’s. There are 30 courses of varying length and complexity, and none of them are a simple drag race to the end. There are ramps, twists, turns, and plenty of obstacles. While the very shortest courses are pretty frictionless (I’ve won a few in under 20 seconds), the longest ones are practically begging you to make agonising mistakes.

This week, my eye has been caught by a surreal RPG, a squirrel with a gun, a typical tentacle horror, handcrafted spaceships, and plenty more interesting indies.

                              <span>Demons happened. There&#x27;s your plot. More specifically, they apparently happened to everyone except you, but the process still messed with your tv, so there&#x27;s nothing for it but to fight your way through them to some kind of solution.


Demons Happened is a curious blend of very rapid action faintly reminiscent of Hotline Miami, and an Abe&#x27;s Oddysee type of puzzle game. Such disparate genres don&#x27;t often blend as well as this, and I&#x27;m disappointed that it hasn&#x27;t got a bigger reception.

                              <span>Dutch anti-piracy group BREIN has just posted its latest annual report. The group shut down 349 illegal sites and services, ranging from streaming portals to open directories. BREIN also booked significant progress on the site blocking front, an effort that continues this year. Meanwhile, its plan to warn and educate persistent infringers is taking longer than expected.

                              <span>A $32.5m copyright infringement lawsuit filed by DISH Network claims that CDN company DataCamp failed to prevent several pirate IPTV providers from pirating its content, even after receiving hundreds of DMCA notices. DataCamp has just informed the court that since it&#x27;s unable to monitor encrypted traffic, there is no liability and the lawsuit must be dismissed.

                              <span>Dragon Ball FighterZ is finally getting rollback netcode by way of the newly announced PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S versions of the game. The update will also be available on PC.
For the unfamiliar, rollback netcode is a system that provides a nearly lag-free online experience, hence why it&#x27;s always a highly desirable feature in the fighting game community. During EVO 2022, DBFZ producer Tomoko Hiroki shared that the current-gen versions will support rollback netcode, whereas the PS4 and Xbox One editions will not. There&#x27;s no release window for upgraded ports, but a message from Bandai Namco&#x27;s Twitter account states we&#x27;ll learn more information later and that it will take &quot;some time&quot; before the system is finished. 
While that&#x27;s bad news for those who don&#x27;t own a PS5 or Xbox Series X/S, Bandai Namco is at least planning some sort of upgrade path for existing game owners on current consoles (such as Smart Delivery on Xbox). There&#x27;s no mention if the Switch version will receive a rollback netcode.  
Hiroki also announced that Dragon Ball FighterZ is now content-complete, meaning it will not receive any more fighters or balance updates. The game received three DLC fighter packs during its lifetime that added over a dozen characters to its roster. 
Dragon Ball FighterZ first launched in January 2018 and was hailed as one of the best fighting games of the decade and arguably the best Dragon Ball video game period. You can read our review of the launch version of the game here.</span>

                              <span>Pirate streaming sites have plenty of options when it comes to sourcing movies, TV shows, and live TV streams. But for some, however, cheaper is apparently better. Streaming portals offering channels from Disney, Paramount, Warner Bros. and HBO are using Twitch&#x27;s servers to save money, but it appears Hollywood has already launched an investigation and is hot on the trail.

                              <span>Obsidian, the first supported game of the mTropolis engine, is ready for public testing!
Created in 1996 by Rocket Science Games and published in early 1997, this ambitious 3D-rendered first-person adventure has you journey through 4 surreal, dream-like worlds in search of your lost colleague.
ScummVM currently supports the English and German versions.  It features a widescreen mode, improved cinematic quality, and a few bug fixes. A Japanese version also exists, but we need more information about it to support it. Please contact us if you have a copy of the Japanese version or some other language version that we haven&#x27;t discovered yet.
To play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. You can also download a demo here.  If you encounter any issues, please submit them to the issue tracker!

                              <span>Free your mind for yet another ScummVM release!
Nine newly supported games on 6 engines will plunge you into a variety of different settings. Are you able to escape from an alien-infested planet? What about challenging the Lord of the Dead in the Underworld? And have you ever explored the deepest depth of your psyche to see if you really know yourself?
Find out in one of the following titles:
Sanitarium
Hades Challenge
Marvel Comics Spider-Man: The Sinister Six
The 11th Hour
Clandestiny
Tender Loving Care (CD-ROM Editions)
Uncle Henry&#x27;s Playhouse
Wetlands
Chewy: Esc from F5
Besides adding new games, we are always focused on improving already supported games. Once again, we managed to squash quite a few bugs from various engines. It is always impressive to see bugs getting fixed in engines that are more than 20 years old!
One of the main new features of ScummVM 2.6.0 is a completely new way to view your games in an amazing icon grid overview via our launcher. Accompanied by some very shiny artwork provided by our graphics artists, you are now able to show off your collection like never before. It almost looks and feels like a virtual shelf!
Check out the full Release Notes for a comprehensive summary of how our developers managed to make ScummVM even more amazing!
You can find all of this goodness available for a number of platforms on our downloads page. If you are using Windows, macOS or the Ubuntu Snap package, the autoupdater will assist you in updating to ScummVM 2.6.0.
As always, thank you for your continuous support — happy adventuring!
