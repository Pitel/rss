                              <span>The government of South Korea says it will ramp up efforts to prevent online piracy of valuable local &#x27;K-Content&#x27; including movies, TV shows, and increasingly popular short-form comics, known locally as &#x27;webtoons&#x27;. With the launch of the &quot;Copyright Crime Scientific Investigation Team&quot; and the &quot;Copyright Crime Analysis Center&quot; it&#x27;s hoped that the increasingly internationalized and sophisticated nature of online infringement can be tackled more effectively.

                              <span>Will it ever be The Day Of for much-delayed and gossip-laden zombie MMO The Day Before? We’ll apparently find out in just over a month, as The Day Before’s release date has now been announced as December 5th following yet another slide back from its previous date of November 10th. That’s after developers Fntastic previously promised that there wouldn’t be any more delays - something its latest ‘Final Trailer’ presumably vows once again.

                              <span>Large gaming monitors can reach some crazy-high prices - so what&#x27;s to stop you from getting a smaller 4K TV instead? You get a much bigger screen for the money plus TV functionality, and if you choose carefully you won&#x27;t give up PC niceties like 4K 120Hz support or  FreeSync and G-Sync compatibility. 
This leads us neatly on to the 42-inch LG C3 OLED, which has dropped to £949 at Currys in the UK for Black Friday (it&#x27;s normally £1399). This tasty £450 discount brings the monitor down to a price that it actually offers better value than many large-format gaming monitors, while offering far superior HDR, incredible motion clarity and of course full compatibility with PS5 and Series X consoles.

                              <span>Last week on the Electronic Wireless Show podcast, Alice and James use the Frasier-inspired browser RPG as a springboard to talk about The Simpsons a lot. And also fan-made video games, like a weird SpongeBob SquarePants fever dream that James experienced while full of milk and chili, and the Waterworld arcade game (as imagined in The Simpsons). Plus, we talk about games we&#x27;ve been playing recently, which includes Alan Wake 2. Alice does an unhinged rant while unaware she is once again ravaged by Covid.


This is why episode 35 is coming out a week after it was supposed to: yes, I had coronavirus the entire time! Apologies for the delay. But, you know, not like loads, I was pretty sick.

                              <span>It is perhaps ironic that in attempting to crystalise my thoughts about Alan Wake 2 - a game about a novelist with such crippling writer&#x27;s block that they end up spawning an entire evil doppelganger of themselves to sabotage their own work - I, too, have been hopelessly staring at a blank screen for the better part of 24 hours. I have not, thank goodness, reached the stage where my psyche&#x27;s split in two (yet), but this spiral of self-doubt has now got to the point where I simply have put words, any words, in front of one another to write my way out of this hellish pit of despair. 
Alan himself goes through a similar ordeal of writing to escape as he tries to find a way out of the prison-like dimension known as The Dark Place, where he&#x27;s been trapped since the events of the first game - and I take heart from the fact that it&#x27;s clearly well-worn territory for the folks at Remedy as well, such is the forensic precision in the way it&#x27;s portrayed onscreen: a chaotic, supernatural tornado that not only threatens to unravel Alan&#x27;s own identity, but also the wider world as we know it. It&#x27;s imposter syndrome writ large, and honestly, Remedy are pretty on the money with this one. Horace is not a pretty taskmaster when the words stop coming.

                              <span>Thirsty Suitors is a dazzling new entry in a genre that is always badly in need of bolstering: turn-based RPGs without anime aesthetics and a story about something other than killing God. The game sees you play as Jala, who returns to her dilapidated hometown after getting dumped by the older woman for whom she abandoned college and her high school sweetheart. Waiting for her is a disappointed mother, a soon-to-be-wed sister who refuses to even speak to her, and a shadowy cabal formed of her spurned exes from the time in her life when rampant, unrelenting teen horniness nearly ripped the town apart. Jala’s journey to redemption and genuine adulthood will take her to the psychic plane to do cathartic (if overly simplistic) battle with her wronged exes, to the local skatepark to pull off some janky grinds, and to grounded emotional revelations that are rarely written this well in videogames.

                              <span>Beware major plot spoilers for the entire Amnesia series, together with descriptions of fictional torturing techniques.

The most ghoulish of Amnesia&#x27;s many ghoulish ideas is &quot;vitae&quot;. It&#x27;s a luminous, blue-green fluid that can be used as an energy source, a chemical catalyst and a supernatural healing agent. Each Amnesia game is broadly a story about the production of vitae, with some levels consisting of huge distillation and refining apparata, and major plot developments tied to what you do with it. In the original Amnesia: The Dark Descent, you&#x27;ll brew potions using vitae in order to keep a decapitated head alive. In 2020&#x27;s Amnesia: Rebirth, you&#x27;ll use ornate metal cannisters of the stuff like batteries to power otherworldly machines. Vitae is the blood and breath of Amnesia, the grease upon the narrative axels, the fuel in its boiler, the miracle McGuffin that sustains its nastier flights of fantasy. But what is vitae, exactly? Agony.

                              <span>Bandai Namco revealed the next four fighters set to join the eventual full roster of 32 when Tekken 8 releases. This brings the total revealed fighter count to 30, with the final two character reveals coming on November 2 and November 12. Fan-favorite character Devil Jin is one of the four characters revealed today, alongside Zafina, Lee Chaolan, and Alisa Bosconovitch.




Four new Fighters join Tekken 8


Devil Jin returns as the “Blank Wings of Ruin,” Jin’s demonic side coming from the devil gene in his blood and the embodiment of him living with his sins. Devil Jin’s appearance matches his name, and his fighting skills are beyond human capabilities.


The “Mystic Stargazer” Zafina brings back her unique fight style rooted in her warrior heritage and her spiritual abilities as a mystical astrologist. Her methods are as old as her lineage, using Ancient Assassination Arts in her attacks.


Lee Chaolan fights with Martial Arts, but his true power comes from the Violet Suit, a one-of-a-kind battle suit that uses sophisticated technology and unleashes attacks that reflect his “Silver haired-Demon” persona.


Alisa Bosconovitch is the “Destroying Automaton” developed by the brilliant scientist Dr. Bosconovitch. Alisa’s fighting skills come from her high-mobility flight suit and her arsenal of technological weaponry.


Tekken 8 is scheduled to release on January 26, 2024 on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.

                              <span>If you&#x27;re the creative type, the latest Grounded update should be right up your alley (or backyard). Later this month, Obsidian Entertainment will introduce the Playgrounds mode — a creation toolset that enables players to create within the world of Grounded.


The new Playgrounds mode was introduced via the Xbox Wire today. It&#x27;s a creation suite that can be compared to Halo&#x27;s Forge mode or Forza Horizon 5&#x27;s EventLab. 




Game director Adam Brennecke said that &quot;this feature has been on the backlog for a very long time.&quot; The idea for Grounded&#x27;s Playgrounds stems from the ingenuity of the modding community. The Grounded development team at Obsidian is relatively small, so instead of directing resources towards new content, Brennecke and the team decide to craft the Make It and Break It set of building tools that enables the game community&#x27;s imagination to run wild. 


Brennecke says that the Make It and Break It is impressively malleable. Essentially everything in the game is at your disposal creatively. &quot;We’re going to provide the tools, and someone’s going to make something magical,&quot; he said.


Players can build buildings, place furniture, create obstacles, implement creatures, and of course, larger bosses. You&#x27;ll even have the ability to install specific sounds and music into specific locations and scenarios. The vast majority of Grounded&#x27;s campaign assets can be utilized for creativity. It&#x27;s extremely customizable, &quot;down to individual blades of grass.&quot;


The new Make It and Break It free update will roll out for Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on November 13. In addition to Playgrounds, the update will also consist of new challenges for Burgle quests, fresh base-building assets, and combat adjustments.


Grounded is available via Xbox Game Pass and PC Game Pass. See what other big titles are headed to the subscription service soon right here.

                              <span>Souls-like games seem to be more popular than ever. One of the newest additions to the genre, Lies of P, had a very successful launch back in September—and now, the project&#x27;s director has confirmed a Lies of P sequel is on the way.


Game director Ji Won Choi broke the news in a newly released director&#x27;s letter video. He began by thanking fans for their enthusiasm and reiterated that the game broke the million copies sold mark following its September 19 launch. He then stated that the team&#x27;s &quot;highest priority is developing the DLC and working on our sequel.&quot;




The director confirmed that the game&#x27;s next patch should be arriving in November. Within it will be balancing to the Weapon Assembly System, as &quot;certain blades and handles were not meeting expectations.&quot;

                              <span>In a blog post titled &quot;The best is yet to come&quot;, developer System Era announced they will be joining Devolver Digital as a first party studio. System Era is best known for its open world survival crafting title Astroneer. At the time of this post, Astroneer has nearly 100,000 user reviews on Steam with a 92% positive score.




According to the post, Devolver Digital almost became the publisher for Astroneer years ago. Despite that not coming to fruition, the two companies stayed in touch culminating in todays acquisition.


System Era assures fans that the company, brand, and team are not going anywhere as a result of the acquisition. The company plans to continue working on Astroneer, while also working on a new project they have already started on. For Astroneer in particular, there is already a roadmap through 2024.


This is one of those situations that just makes sense. A popular indie title like Astroneer is a great fit with Devolver Digital as a publisher. I have almost 100 hours in total in Astroneer over the years, playing several times with a couple friends. I&#x27;m excited to see the new project they talked about as well...hopefully we get some more news soon!

However, I was determined to enjoy it as much as I could. So, I broke ground on the future site of the Misery Metropolitan Area and did what I could. However, I finally hit a bump in the road I can’t drive over, so I’m hanging it up until there’s a patch.


In a Steam recent post, Mariina Hallikainen, the CEO of Colossal Order, acknowledged three major issues the Cities: Skylines II developer is looking to address. First, citizens aren’t buying all types of commercial goods, which has some commercial areas reporting that they don’t have enough consumers. That’s a relief. I’ve …</span>

                              <span>3D platformers have made something of a resurgence in recent years in the indie scene. Titles like A Hat in Time and Frogun show there&#x27;s a market for inventive platforming ideas with amazing worlds to explore.


Many of these take inspiration from N64 titles like Super Mario 64 and Banjo-Kazooie in various factors, echoing a time when 3D platformers were more common while remaining accessible to modern audiences. Pseudoregalia by developer rittzler is no exception to this, but that doesn&#x27;t stop it from being excellent. 


Pseudoregalia follows a goat-bunny girl named Sybil as she journeys across Castle Sansa to free its prisoners. To achieve her goals, Sybil must explore its secrets, becoming more powerful along the way.

                              <span>Granblue Fantasy Versus fans are going to have to wait a little longer for the next entry. Cygames, Inc. announced a delay that pushes Granblue Fantasy Versus: Rising to December 14, 2023. 


Rising was originally set for November 30, so the wait is just a matter of a couple weeks. According to the press release, the delay was put in place to &quot;allow for additional fine-tuning.&quot; Cygames apologized to fans who were looking forward to diving in at the tail end of November. When it launches, the Arc System Works-developed fighter will be available for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC via Steam.

Early access action


While Granblue Fantasy Versus: Rising has been delayed, that doesn&#x27;t mean November will be completely bereft of battles. The second open beta test will be held from November 9 to November 12 on all three platforms. In addition to cross-platform multiplayer, the open beta will offer up access to the Grand Bruise Legends! party mode. Look for more details to be announced via the official social accounts soon. 


Early Access play will be available for those who pre-order the Deluxe Edition from the PlayStation Store. With the delay in place, the Early Access date has been shifted to December 11, with the caveat that there may be changes to the schedule between now and then. PlayStation Store pre-orders also come with a bonus PSN Avatar Set, which isn&#x27;t currently planned for post-launch release in other forms. The set includes avatars for Gran, Djeeta, Siegfried, Nier, Narmaya, Beelzebub, and Seox. 


If you&#x27;re itching for Granblue Fantasy Versus showdowns in the meantime, the first game is currently on sale on the PlayStation Store and Steam between now and November 8. It&#x27;s currently $1.99 on the PS Store and $3.99 on Steam.

                              <span>If you like to make or download mods for games like Resident Evil or Monster Hunter, it seems that Capcom doesn&#x27;t share your enthusiasm. In fact, when it comes to anti-cheat and anti-piracy measures, Capcom seems to believe mods should be &quot;defined as cheats.&quot;


That&#x27;s according to a recent presentation on the Capcom R&amp;D YouTube channel (thanks, GamesRadar). A section of the video dedicated to the &quot;state of cheats and piracy in PC games&quot; asks whether anti-cheat or anti-piracy tech should target mods.




While the presentation acknowledges the popularity of modding, it regards them as a form of cheating, at least in relation to anti-piracy software. Specifically, it mentions &quot;mods that are not officially supported by the game.&quot;


Doesn&#x27;t necessarily say Capcom will be cracking down on them


The video goes on to say that unofficial content is &quot;impossible to distinguish from cheat tools,&quot; though it concedes that the majority of mods &quot;can have a positive impact on the game.&quot;


However, Capcom outlines some concerns about modding, such as &quot;reputational damage&quot; or mods that are &quot;offensive to public order and morals.&quot; On top of this, there&#x27;s the potential for games to become corrupt or damaged which can add to workload for customer support teams.


What this means going forward isn&#x27;t clear. The presentation strongly implies that Capcom&#x27;s R&amp;D department is not 100% in favor of unofficial content for games. While there&#x27;s no indication the developer is looking to clamp down on mods, it seems clear that the video is concerned about how cheats (or mods) may harm a company&#x27;s reputation.

                              <span>Things are heating up in the mobile gaming world. While the Steam Deck has inevitably kicked things off in this market, there have been a number of rivals already. And now Lenovo has just launched its Legion Go device, which could blow Valve&#x27;s efforts out the water.


We knew the Lenovo handheld was coming on Halloween, but boy did those weeks fly by! Promising PC gaming on the move, with a QHD+ display screen, detachable controllers, all working through Windows 11, the Legion Go may make the Deck poop itself.




In fact, you can see a side-by-side comparison of the specs over on Videocardz. The Legion device is powered by AMD Zen4 and RDNA tech, while the Valve machine is using Zen2 and RDNA 2, so the latter is already starting to trail behind.


The Steam Deck may want to up its game


While there&#x27;s nothing wrong with the Steam Deck, we can already see the advances that have been made in mobile gaming in less than two years. The fact that Legion Go has a 1TB variant and a slightly better battery life will probably be appealing to some.


However, with that extra juice comes the price tag. Over on the Lenovo website itself, the 512GB model is currently selling for $699.99, while more storage will set you back an extra $50.


Given that we might not see a new Steam Deck for a couple more years, there may be a bit of danger for Gabe Newell and his team. No doubt Valve will have something up its sleeve, but in quite a short amount of time, we&#x27;ve seen a number of gaming handhelds try to muscle in on the Deck&#x27;s territory.

                              <span>Since it launched in 2022, Gran Turismo 7 has consistently received new content to keep racers coming back to burn rubber. Today, a new update arrives, and it brings something for everyone. 




The update will be available from 11:00 PM PST, and Polyphony is touting it as the biggest since the launch of the game. Although both PS4 and PS5 players will get the update, some features will only arrive for the current-gen console. There is a trailer for you to watch as you wait for the patch to download.

                              <span>Sonic and friends are back for an all-new 3D adventure...on the Apple Arcade. Announced via X (Twitter) and YouTube, SEGA and Hardlight&#x27;s Sonic Dream Team will launch exclusively on Apple Arcade on December 5th.




According to a post via Apple, Sonic Dream Team is a new 3D action platformer that follows Sonic and the gang as they stop Doctor Eggman. This time, he has discovered a dream manifestation device called The Reverie. As Sonic or a host of playable friends, folks will navigate insane dreamscapes, rescue allies, and avoid Eggman&#x27;s goal of world domination.

Despite the title being exclusive to Apple Arcade, Sonic Dream Team looks to be pretty fleshed out. We have our usual Tails, Amy, and Knuckles, but we also get Rouge the Bat and Cream the Rabbit (alongside Cheese the Chao). This will be Cream&#x27;s first playable appearance in a main game since 2019&#x27;s Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020. 


As for gameplay, it looks pretty similar to Sonic Lost World, with players being able to navigate stages freely in 3D. However, it also looks to be open world to a degree, though how vast the world may be has yet to be seen. Boss battles are also present, as we see Sonic fight a giant enemy crab (not that one) and Tails battle a laser-shooting robot. Regardless, the worlds look vibrant and fun, which is typical for a series such as Sonic the Hedgehog.


A new animation is also shown in the trailer, sporting some impressive visuals. The studio that created the animation is Powerhouse Animation Studios. They have previously animated for the Sonic Frontiers Prologue: Divergence short and the cinematics for Sonic Origins. Outside of Sonic, Powerhouse is responsible for the Castlevania animated shows, most recently Castlevania: Nocturne.

                              <span>Get ready for a deep dive into the unknown, because the 1992 NEC PC-9801 visual novel, Dead of the Brain has received a fan translation.


So, backing up, the PC-98 is the last of a line of NEC computers released through the ‘80s and into the ‘90s in Japan. I could get more technical about it, but basically, these computers provided dedicated ecosystems to games, and they largely remained in Japan, where they were popular. This means that there’s an entire beloved subset of games that most Westerners were locked out of. Even among the more informed retro gamers, the games remained obscure, but awareness of them has been growing. Within the indie market, games like Stonks 9800 and World of Horror have even coopted their aesthetic (PC-98 and PC-88, respectively).

Anyway, Dead of the Brain was the first in the “Nightmare Collection” which wound up consisting of three games. It’s a point-and-click adventure game mixed with heavy visual novel elements. What makes it stand apart is its extremely gory presentation. In fact, I don’t even know what else to say about it, other than the fact that it’s very gory as well as some potential nudity – but not the fun kind.


Dead of the Brain was also released on the PC-Engine (TurboGrafx-16), MSX, FM Towns, and Sharp X68000.


Nonetheless, with the growing popularity of NEC’s PC lineup in the West, it’s the perfect time to get a fan translation. The crew behind it state that this translation was made from the ground up and is not related to the PC-Engine or Retronomicon PC-98 translations.

My journey afterward was rife with peril, but the weirdness and general ingenuity of this series alleviated most of those frustrations.

WarioWare: Move It! (Switch)
Developer: Intelligent Systems
Publisher: Nintendo
Released: November 3, 2023
MSRP: $49.99


To be clear, yes, WarioWare: Move It (if you couldn&#x27;t tell from the name) is a motion control-only affair. For story mode, you&#x27;ll be using two Joy-Con in tandem for each player (to a maximum of two), and for the 2-4 player party mode, each person will be tied to one total Joy-Con. They&#x27;re referred to as &quot;Form Stones&quot; in the lore,…</span>

                              <span>Nintendo has finally announced when Wave 6 – the last wave – of the Booster Course Pass DLC is going to hit. It will drop November 9, 2023.


We’ve also got a solid list of all the tracks that are to be included in this final wave:


Acorn Cup



Tour Rome Avanti (Tour)


DK Mountain (GameCube)


Daisy Circuit (Wii)


Piranha Plant Cove



Spiny Cup



Madrid Drive (Tour)


Rosalina’s Ice World (3DS)


Bowser Castle 3 (SNES)


Rainbow Road (Wii)



That’s a pretty good list. DK Mountain was the indisputable best course from Mario Kart Double Dash. Perhaps the best in the entire Mario Kart series. With Bowser Castle 3, I always like to see Mode7 tracks get a glow-up. Then, finally, I always love torturing my family using Rainbow Road. It’s nice to have another rock to throw.


Beyond that, we’re also getting some new racers that were previously announced. Diddy Kong and Funky Kong will be joining the DK Crew (Hungh!). Making their debut in the Mario Kart series is also the fan favorite Peachette, and Pauline, who I’m constantly explaining what game she’s from to my family.


Also, there are 16 new Mii costumes added to the mix, including one based on Daisy which can be unlocked by scanning her Amiibo. Finally, they’re implementing a music player so that you can listen to your favorite tracks from your favorite tracks without it being overlaid with “Yahaa! Waheeey! Wahwahwahwah!”


All of this gets released as part of Wave 6 of the Booster Course Pass DLC on November 9, 2023. Just in time for the sacred holiday of Black Friday.

                              <span>Studio Wildcard&#x27;s ARK: Survival Ascended launched on October 25, and though it currently sits with a mixed reception on Steam, it has been gobbled up by players worldwide. 


On launch day, it shot up to number one on the Steam sales charts, surpassing heavyweights like Counter-Strike 2 and Apex Legends. It sits in 5th place as of November 1, just behind Cyberpunk 2077. The publisher, Snail Games, revealed that ARK: Survival Ascended has also been very popular on YouTube where it was the number one live game on the site.


A similar situation unfolded on Twitch. On launch day, fans watched over 5.6 million minutes of the game, which equates to a whopping 10.7 years. It was also among the top 6 games on the site, gathering  129K concurrent viewers on launch day. 


Unfortunately, console players will have to wait a while before they can play. This is because critical issues in the multiplayer version were identified, and they would have major implications for the console versions of the games. Consequently, the ports have been delayed to November. 


ARK: Survival Ascended is a remake of the popular 2017 game ARK: Survival Evolved. If you&#x27;re looking for a survival video game filled with prehistoric animals, this is the franchise you need.

                              <span>As long as there is Morrowind, there will be mods for it. However, Tamriel Rebuilt is something else; the combination of fan commitment, and now the project has just released another expansion.


Called &quot;Andaram,&quot; this latest update adds even more to the ambitious TES3 mod. A trailer on YouTube gives a taste of what&#x27;s been added, and details say the new area features, &quot;over 100 quests and 9 faction questlines, including a new vampire clan and the highly anticipated Andothren Thieves Guild.&quot;




According to the website, this represents the seventh major expansion for the project, which this area being located by the Thirr River.


So what is Tamriel Rebuilt, exactly?


Generally regarded as the smallest game in the base Elder Scrolls entries, Morrowind only really incorporates the island of Vvardenfell, ignoring the rest of the mainland.


It&#x27;s a bit like if you were to make a game that was set in the United Kingdom, but only mapped out Ireland. What Tamriel Rebuilt does is add in the Elder Scrolls equivalent of England, Wales, and Scotland. At least, that&#x27;s my take on it.


The fan project technically began before Morrowind was officially released and has been in development ever since. According to the Wiki, around half of the mainland is now playable, and more is being worked on all the time.


The mod is free to download and try, which makes me wonder why I haven&#x27;t played it myself yet. Also, if you&#x27;re interested in helping out, the team is always looking for people to join Tamriel Rebuilt in a number of capacities.

Enter a Deep Sleep


In Poppy Playtime Chapter 3: Deep Sleep, players will delve deeper into the eerie Playtime Co., an abandoned toy factory that was mysteriously shut down after its staff disappeared ten years ago. Players will take on the role of a former employee looking to unveil the secrets of what happened to their former colleagues.



“We want our loyal fans to know we hear them and we are just as excited to bring them a new journey in the next Chapter. Fans can expect Chapter 3 to be the scariest and longest playing chapter of the Poppy Playtime anthology to date.”
- Zach Belanger, Co-founder and CEO of Mob Entertainment



According to the developers, Deep Sleep will be the largest chapter of Poppy Playtime yet. Alongside an increase in the number of environments, characters, and mini-games, Deep Sleep will feature a larger storyline and enhanced graphics.


Poppy Playtime Chapter 3: Deep Sleep will release on Steam in December.

                              <span>I had a blast playing through Remnant 2 earlier this year. Just a week ago I had the opportunity to see a preview of the first upcoming DLC for the Action RPG shooter titled The Awakened King. Now I loved all of the worlds in Remnant 2, but there was something special about Losomn. With the upcoming DLC, players will head back to the world of Losomn to learn more about the One True King.

All hail the One True King


In the roughly 25-minute preview of The Awakened King DLC, I was shown the new region in which we will be visiting. The One True King has awakened, and he is out for blood after being corrupted by the Root. In a fit of rage he teleported his castle above a Dran coastal town where the chaotic weather and angry tides have surfaced …</span>

                              <span>Just in time for Halloween, the creators of Bloodborne Kart have announced a January 2024 release date for the meme-made-actual game. 


Bloodborne Kart launches next year on PC, and it comes fully stocked. Developer Lilith Walther, who goes by b0tster on Twitter, and the team at Fan Software pulled out the, erm, stops on this one. The game will feature 12 racers to choose from and 16 maps on which to race. It comes with a story mode for solo play, as well as a Battle mode and split-screen multiplayer. And since this is, naturally, based on a From Software game, it includes boss battles. How the latter all works isn&#x27;t all the much of a mystery. As showcased before, the boss battles are one-on-one arena showdowns with deadly weapons. 




Bloodborne Kart is a joke game no more


The developer also released a new trailer, as seen above. It offers a glimpse of some of the marketable features, such as the playable characters. Want to know who will win in a race between Maria and Baby Mergo? Well, Bloodborne Kart will provide you with the answer to that fan fiction born of a fever dream. My money is on Mergo, though. You see the child whip out that pistol during the trailer? This kid isn&#x27;t playing. The game&#x27;s creators certainly do appear to be having a good time. I have nothing but respect for that unabashed homage to Akira.

Since it&#x27;s a fan-made game, you should expect it to go easy on your wallet. The developer also released a Bloodborne demake called Bloodborne PSX and uploaded it for free on ichio. For more information on the game plus images, be sure to give the game&#x27;s site a look.

                              <span>Whenever I revisit my earliest RPG loves, I often find that the thick fog of &#x27;90s nostalgia does more harm than good. I’ve spent far too much time fondly recalling the way I saw certain games as a kid with a big imagination, only to realize some of those adventures don’t quite measure up in the same ways now.


As much as we like to ask for remakes of beloved classics like Chrono Trigger or Final Fantasy IX, the thought of such remade experiences makes my jaw reflexively clench. Messy remakes not only muddle fond memories, they occasionally blunder the wonders and themes of the originals. And while I’ve embraced more remasters and faithful from-the-ground-up rebuilds over the last few years, I always feel a tiny pit of anxiety looming when RPGs I adored roll back into the spotlight.

                              <span>The PlayStation Plus motley games for November have been revealed. Subscribers can add Mafia II: Definitive Edition, Dragon Ball: The Breakers, and Aliens Fireteam Elite to their libraries beginning on November 7 until December 4. 
Mafia II: Definitive Edition
This remaster of the 2010 crime game spruces up the adventure with improved HD visuals. It also includes all of its post-launch DLC. You can us take a tour of the game in this episode of New Gameplay Today.
Dragon Ball: The Breakers
This 7-v-1 multiplayer game pits a team of random normies, plus Bulma and Oolong, against a player controlling iconic Dragon Ball villains like Frieza, Cell, and Buu. The non-villains must work together to survive and escape stages in a time machine. The villain player’s job is simple: hunt and destroy everyone else. 
Aliens: Fireteam Elite
Up to four-players team up to battle hordes of xenomorphs in this cooperative class-based shooter. In our review, former editor Jason Guisao gave it a 6.5/10, writing, 
As a reminder, you have until November 6 to add October&#x27;s monthly games to your library. As another heads up for new subscribers or those getting ready to renew, the prices for each PlayStation Plus tier has increased starting in September.

                              <span>Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2 hit PlayStation 5 exclusively on October 20 and quickly became Sony&#x27;s fastest-selling first-party game. While we loved the game – read Game Informer&#x27;s Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2 review here – players have discovered bugs and issues leading to laughter and, in some cases, progress impediment. Fortunately, developer Insomniac Games has been quick to fix issues with updates, like one last week that fixed an incorrect flag and the infamous white cube model issue. 
Now, the studio has released another update targeting various bugs players might be encountering in the game related to specific missions, shortcuts, tutorials, and more. 


Here&#x27;s the full Update Version 1.001.004 release notes: 
Addressed an issue where players could become stuck during the finale of Marko&#x27;s Memories
Addressed an issue where a boss could become stuck in geometry
Addressed multiple issues where the player could become stuck during the Galvanize tutorial
Addressed an issue where players with shortcuts enabled could become stuck in a puzzle during the New Threads mission
Addressed an issue where the Charge Jump would break when assigned to a shortcut
Addressed an issue where the Upgraded Classic suit had duplicate eye details
Further addressed issues where models would not load properly after long play sessions
Improved stability 
Hopefully, if one of these issues has stopped you from progressing past certain points in Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2&#x27;s various quests, you&#x27;ll be able to advance after installing this update.

                              <span>Gran Turismo 7 is getting its biggest update tomorrow in the form of Spec II (a.k.a update 1.40). The content drop, which is free, adds a new cooperative mode, seven new cars, a fresh track, and more.


Perhaps the update’s biggest addition is four-player local split-screen. Unfortunately for PS4 players, this option is only available on PS5. Speaking of PS5-only features, those players can enjoy taking on Gran Turismo Sophy, which developer Polyphony Digital describes as a “prototype revolutionary racing AI agent” 
Spec II also adds the snowy Lake Louise track. Set in a Canadian ski resort, it comes in three variants: long track, short track, and tri-oval. New Master License events are coming and the update also adds quality-of-life features, such as a dashboard that tracks player progression.
Of course, new vehicles are always exciting, and here are the seven joining the roster:
Dodge Charger R/T 426 Hemi &#x27;68
Dodge Challenger SRT Demon &#x27;18
Lexus LFA &#x27;10
Mercedes-Benz 190 E 2.5-16 Evolution II &#x27;91
NISMO 400R &#x27;95
Porsche 911 GT3 RS (992) &#x27;22
Tesla Model 3 Performance &#x27;23
Spec II adds a host of smaller additions, such as new Cafe menus and new photo mode options, and you can read a complete breakdown by reading the blog post on the Gran Turismo website. You can download the update on November 2. For more on Gran Turismo 7, check out our review.</span>

Ever since its first title 20 years ago, the WarioWare franchise has shapeshifted to take advantage of the capabilities and gimmicks of whatever the current Nintendo platform was. But the first entry on Switch, Get It Together, bucked that trend, putting you in control of the actual cast of characters in platforming-style microgames instead of taking advantage of the Switch’s unique traits. WarioWare: Move It aligns more with the traditional WarioWare experience, resulting in a better overall collection.

                              <span>Lies of P launched back in September to both critical and fan acclaim – we gave it one of our highest scores of the year and you can read about why in Game Informer&#x27;s Lies of P review. After a September patch that included various changes to make the Soulslike action RPG easier, game director Jiwon Choi has released a Director&#x27;s Letter to confirm plans for a Lies of P sequel, tease DLC for the game with two new images, and more. 
Lies Of P Sequel Confirmed


Choi began the video thanking players for helping the game sell 1 million copies in less than two months after release. He then sneakily drops a line confirming the Pinocchio-inspired Soulslike is getting a sequel. 
&quot;Our highest priority is developing the DLC and working on the sequel,&quot; Choi says in the Director&#x27;s Letter. &quot;The dev team…</span>

                              <span>It&#x27;s hardly a surprise.
Wario&#x27;s new voice actor for WarioWare: Move It! seems to have been confirmed and the answer is just as we all expected.
Yes, it looks like the new voice of Mario and Luigi, Kevin Afghani, is also voicing Wario — at least, that is the most obvious conclusion having taken a look at the game&#x27;s credits. You see, much like Super Mario Bros. Wonder, Move It&#x27;s credits do not list the characters alongside the voice actors, but seeing Afghani&#x27;s name at the top of the list makes for a pretty obvious conclusion, if you ask us.

                              <span>Not exactly the cream of the crop.
Fans of the farm sim genre have been eating well in recent times, thanks to a boom in enjoyable new releases and remakes. Heck, even Natsume&#x27;s newest Harvest Moon is kind of good! Yet it was only a few years ago when Switch owners didn’t have anywhere near as many options, and it was in this period that My Time at Portia released. Offering up a jankier take on the Rune Factory approach of farm sims, it offered up a passable experience that nonetheless helped to fill an important gap in the broader library. Since that release, developer Pathea has been spending its time working on a sequel, My Time at Sandrock, which many were hoping would meaningfully improve on the flaws of the original. Unfortunately, it doesn’t really do so. My Time at Sandrock still offers up a reasonably enjoyable take on the farm sim formula, but its poor graphical presentation, litany of technical issues, and general lack of a distinct identity really drag it down.
Gameplay follows the expected trappings of a farm sim, wherein you slowly build up an impressive property via tending to crops and livestock, all while building relationships with various locals and participating in the occasional festival or gathering. Even in the desert, seasons change and you have to plan out how you time your planting and take care of your animals, even as new seasonal alternatives become available. It’s well-worn gameplay by this point, but it’s still fun to engage in. There’s something remarkably satisfying about diligently tending to your tasks every day and watching your equipment quality increase as your property gradually expands.

We are rapidly approaching the release date of WarioWare: Move It! on 3rd November, and today we have had a chance to see what the critics made of the latest in Nintendo&#x27;s chaotic party series.
Here at Nintendo Life, we had a great time with this one and granted it an 8/10 in our review. While we thought that Move It doesn&#x27;t do all that much to change the formula that we have come to know and love, we were impressed by how this one &quot;feels like the classic Wii experience reinvigorated&quot;.

When we think about the best jobs evs, working at The Pokémon Company has to be up there. However, with a team so large, how could you possibly know where the most fun is had? Well, thanks to a new report from The Guardian which takes a look at the internal workings of Creatures Inc, focusing on card production, it seems that we might have just found it.
Now, we have covered how Pokémon cards are made on the site before, but what we didn&#x27;t know about was the team of 18 internal game testers whose job it is to rigorously put new and upcoming cards through their paces. Yes, they play with Pokémon cards. For a job.

Ahead of My Time at Sandrock&#x27;s launch on November 2nd, 2023 (that&#x27;s tomorrow at the time of writing), publisher PM Studios has released a short video featuring the game&#x27;s director, Xu Zhi of Pathea Games, promoting the release and the studio&#x27;s work in porting the game to Switch, as well as a planned Switch performance update for 2019&#x27;s My Time at Portia.
As stated in the video (above), Sandrock originally started off as a DLC expansion for My Time at Portia, but grew into its own thing when the studio &#x27;felt Sandrock&#x27;s charm&#x27;. The director also goes into how Pathea and PM Studios are responsible for both the development of the game and its port onto Switch, stressing that this is to ensure quality and consistency:

As much as we loved 2021&#x27;s WarioWare: Get It Together!, it&#x27;s definitely an entry in this barmy franchise that&#x27;s ended up dividing opinion over time. With little in the way of truly engaging multiplayer options, no real core gimmick, or any significant attempt to utilise the Switch&#x27;s unique control opportunities, some folks (not us, mind) felt that it didn&#x27;t do enough to really make its mark. It&#x27;s also been suggested that the game&#x27;s large roster of characters, each with their own mechanics, ruined the simplicity at the heart of the fun, making for one too many decisions to be made before you got to the main meat of the microgames.
Now, after waiting ages for Get It Together! to come along, just two years down the line we&#x27;ve got another brand new WarioWare adventure to dig into. WarioWare: Move It! makes some big shake-ups to its predecessor, wisely bringing back the motion-controlled madness of Smooth Moves and giving us more ways to engage with other players. This feels like the classic Wii experience reinvigorated, and a more fully fleshed-out entry than 2021&#x27;s effort overall with regards to cooperative and multiplayer options.

The Star Ocean series has always occupied a weird spot in Square’s massive catalogue. This sci-fi-focused JRPG series started off relatively strong, but the last few entries have been middling at best and just plain not good at worst. Nonetheless, those earlier games were really something at the time, and 1998’s Star Ocean: The Second Story has been widely seen by fans as the pinnacle of the series. Though Square gave it an enhanced remaster on PSP, it’s now decided to revive this classic once more as Star Ocean: The Second Story R, a remake built from the ground up with modern features, and we’re thrilled to report that this revisit is a complete success. Star Ocean: The Second Story R manages to preserve everything that was great about the original while adding tons of extra features and content to make this the definitive version.
The story of Star Ocean 2 is set 20 years after the events of the first game and follows dual protagonists Claude and Rena, one of whom you pick as your lead character at the beginning of a new file. Rena is from a distant planet named Expel, while Claude is a member of the interstellar Earth Federation, which travels the stars and contacts new civilizations. Claude and his father, the admiral, are investigating a mysterious disturbance with a ground team on a recently discovered planet when Claude foolishly approaches an alien object that teleports him across the universe to Rena’s planet.

First revealed in March last year, at the time we hoped that the nebulous phrase &quot;PC and consoles&quot; included our favourite Nintendo system, and today we can exclusively confirm that, yes, musical adventure Snufkin: Melody of Moominvalley is coming to Switch in Q1 2024 (alongside all those other consoles).
Developed by Hyper Games and based on Finnish author Tove Jansson&#x27;s beloved Moomin series — which debuted a whopping 78 years ago — the brand-new &#x27;Friends in the Valley&#x27; trailer below gives an idea of the gameplay and &quot;over 50&quot; characters you&#x27;ll encounter on a musical quest that, as we&#x27;ve learned from Hyper Games&#x27; co-founder and CEO Are Sundnes, is inspired by the original Zelda games.

But there are several more big hitters due across November including the latest Football Manager, Like A Dragon Gaiden: Really Long Subtitle, and bathhouse management sim Spirittea. To my mind, basically every major, interesting game from November is on the way to the subscription.

                              <span>In smashing news for the galaxy&#x27;s irrational planet-haters, some adept tinkerer has created a Starfield mod that lets you build your own space-stations. Mind you, it appears the associated functionality was secretly part of Bethesda&#x27;s sci-fi RPG all along, perhaps destined to be unlocked by a DLC pack, like a slumbering fairytale royal awaiting true love&#x27;s kiss.
The modder in question is vexthecollector, whose catchily-named Spacestations for Outposts lets you bolt together hab modules, windows and docking bays to fashion your very own Deep Space Nine. Sadly for my character, the acutely terra-phobic star pirate Mary Read, you&#x27;ll need to first build an outpost on a planet in order to access the goods.

                              <span>Headless enemies aren&#x27;t exactly a new concept in games, so I&#x27;m not sure why the Headless in Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice instills such dread in me. It&#x27;s so terrifying to face that I almost didn&#x27;t write this post, because I knew I&#x27;d have to drop into its heinous lair in order to take the screenshot you see above.
But I&#x27;m a brave boy, so I dropped in, and of course died almost instantly. Sekiro is still one of the toughest soulslikes around, absolutely filled with extremely dangerous bosses and twisted body-horror monstrosities that can carve you up with just a couple of hits, sending you back to the last checkpoint bereft of all your XP. But the Headless scares me so much, I actively avoid facing it until I have absolutely no choice.

                              <span>Jusant is all show, no tell, which is a bold swing. Video game characters aren&#x27;t often big on show don&#x27;t tell in 2023. A lot of them have been cursed by their creators to narrate everything they do, as they do it, incase the meatsacks controlling them are unable to parse even one second of what is happening on screen without direction. I love HZD&#x27;s Aloy, but does she ever just stream-of-consciousness her way through life.
In contrast, the nameless protagonist in Don&#x27;t Nod&#x27;s new climbing puzzle adventure (what even are genres?) is also silent. There are no other NPCs. You are climbing up through the ruins of an old civilisation. As such, Jusant relies on the devs having crafted an understandable world that you can barely interact with, aside from painstakingly climbing across it like a spidery archaeologist. You&#x27;ve got to have faith in your environmental storytelling if you&#x27;re making a game like that. And Don&#x27;t Nod have nailed it.

                              <span>A little knowledge can be worse than no knowledge at all. I know a little about the Yakuza series, having reviewed the 1980s-set Yakuza Zero for this very parish in 2018, and tried a bit of 2019&#x27;s turn-based battler Yakuza: Like A Dragon. Fast-forward to 2023, and all Yakuza games are now Like A Dragon games, including the forthcoming Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth, which is an... Animal Crossing game, actually? With skateboarding? I&#x27;m still getting my head around the existence of a zombie spin-off, Dead Souls, to say nothing of the samurai-era Like A Dragon: Ishin. And then there&#x27;s the inter-quel Like a Dragon Gaiden, due this November, which seems like a relatively straight-laced delve into the past of original protagonist Kazuma Kiryu. Phew, it&#x27;s just as well Ed Thorn wrote that guide to the order you should play the Yakuza games in.


It sounds like the developers at Ryu ga Gotoku Studio have a hard time keeping track themselves, especially given the rate at which Sega publish Like A Dragon games. According to studio director Masayoshi Yokoyama, Like A Dragon&#x27;s creators feel a lot of pressure to get the games done quickly, not just with a view to making money but because as projects that riff so copiously on pop culture, Like A Dragon stories go out of date fast.

                              <span>I am sure an honest, self-respecting Tolkienian fantasy dwarf would, if I pinched his apple cheeks and told him he&#x27;s very endearing, he&#x27;d at best glare at me and at worst kneecap me with his axe. And yet! That&#x27;s a large part of what I enjoy about the new subterranean survival-craft-&#x27;em-up The Lord Of The Rings: Return To Moria. It&#x27;s a slower, more weighty survival game than you might be used to if you&#x27;re a Valheim or ARK type, for example, and you&#x27;ll spend a lot of your time in the dark. But what is this, a survival game for elves? No sir. And besides, like I said, it&#x27;s rather sweet. Cosy, even.

Well, usually on Monday; yesterday I was instead up in the Highlands admiring autumn. But today! Today my eye has been caught by an even greater quantity of grappling hooks and slick movement tricks than usual, along with some chill scenes, typing violence, and giving ghosts the finger.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve only just read Sin&#x27;s thoughts on Akuma Kira&#x27;s Lunacid and lo and behold, the PS1-styled, first-person dungeon crawler has now released out of Steam Early Access, to considerable rejoicing. Lunacid is a homage to classic FromSoftware games - no, not that juvenile upstart Dark Souls, but King&#x27;s Field and Shadow&#x27;s Tower, which date back to the late 1990s. 


I played one of the King&#x27;s Field games as a sprog and found it to be an extended cave system full of lava, demons and torment. Lunacid sort of applies the perspective and medieval fantasy combat of that series to a story reminiscent of Demon&#x27;s Souls - the From-alike that spurred the Japanese studio to international fame - with a world that has been flooded with toxic mist by a &quot;sleeping old one below&quot;. Your job, as some unfortunate outcast chucked into a pit, is to journey downward and confront this mysterious creature, using any and all combinations of rapiers, clubs and fireballs. Off you go then.

                              <span>Fresh from the release of Alan Wake 2 - and apparently with a view to driving me nuts, because I haven&#x27;t had a chance to play Alan Wake 2 yet - Remedy have shared some titbits about future projects. These include the modestly-known about Control 2, a sequel to the paranormal Brutalist telekinet &#x27;em up that is seeing &quot;good progress&quot;, and the forthcoming remakes of Max Payne 1 and 2, on which Remedy are collaborating with GTA and Max Payne 3 developer Rockstar.
Further afield, there&#x27;s the mysterious Condor project, a co-op multiplayer Control spin-off (pictured above) that builds on Remedy&#x27;s experience crafting the single-player component for wayward service-based shooter CrossfireX. And at the very edge of sight, there&#x27;s the faint outline of something called Codename Vanguard, about which naff-all is known. Could it be that &quot;crazy, huge budget, dark gothic fantasy&quot; Remedy&#x27;s creative director Sam Lake would like one day to make?

                              <span>Steelkrill Studio, creators of the popular horror games The Backrooms 1998, Trenches, and The Voidness—which just left Early Access yesterday—has announced its next title: Rotten Flesh. Steelkrill&#x27;s previous titles are known for their uniquely creepy art-style, and it looks like Rotten Flesh will be no different as it features PSX-style graphics and gameplay.




ROY!


Rotten Flesh is an immersive cosmic horror survival game where the player has just lost their dog Roy. While trying to find Roy, players will have to shout &quot;ROY!&quot; in their microphone. As you venture deep into the sewers to search for Roy, calling for him will cause him to bark if he&#x27;s nearby...but Roy isn&#x27;t the only creature in the tunnels of the sewers who can respond to your calls. According to the release, players can  opt to toggle off the microphone input and instead switch to voice acting where players can push a button to call for Roy, but the microphone input is recommended.


I have to admit, it sounds like a pretty interesting concept, and utilizing the microphone can definitely setup some eerie moments, especially if something other than Roy responds to you calling out. It&#x27;s great they&#x27;ve made the microphone input optional. But in a game like this, I feel like it will really enhance the experience.


In terms of the rest of the gameplay, it looks like players will be tasked with solving puzzles, hiding and stealthing past enemies, and managing their inventory as they find supplies, upgrades and health packs to survive the depths of the sewers.


Rotten Flesh does not yet have a release date, but can be wishlisted on Steam.

Yeah, the Pyramid Head is very scary, but what about NPCs that, due to glitches or wacky design, become just as monstrous as the most intentionally scary monsters in gaming? 


Sure, we already covered the creepiest glitches in video games. But for those who need even more cursed content, here&#x27;s a list just for you.




Kids in Assassin’s Creed Valhalla


‌In previous Assassin&#x27;s Creed games, Ubisoft generally modeled regular-looking kids. But in Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla, the company managed to come up with a bunch of monstrosities when it came to portraying Viking children.

In a newly launched trailer for the game, the single-player story is intriguingly called &quot;an epic roguelike campaign.&quot;


The crux of the campaign&#x27;s story revolves around Danny Phantom&#x27;s Vlad Plasimus as the villain &quot;wreaks havoc across the Nickelodeon universe.&quot; To progress through the adventure, you&#x27;ll have the option to choose different paths at key moments. Successful bouts lead you toward unlocking new characters and power-ups to aid you further along.

                              <span>Ubisoft is shutting down online services for 10 of their older games early next year. This includes a few older Assassin&#x27;s Creed games on platforms like PC and Xbox 360, as well as Trials Evolution&#x27;s PC servers.


This isn&#x27;t the first time Ubisoft has elected to end online services for some of their older games. Although some may be displeased by it, eventually shutting down online services for older entries is common in the gaming industry.


The services are set to shut down early next year, on January 25, 2024 to be exact. Many noticed the abundance of big name franchises such as Assassin’s Creed. Here are the 10 games players will no longer have online access to from Ubisoft.



Assassin&#x27;s Creed 2 - Xbox 360


Assassin&#x27;s Creed Brotherhood - Mac


Assassin&#x27;s Creed Liberation HD - PS3, Xbox 360


Assassin&#x27;s Creed Revelations - PC


Ghost Recon Future Soldier - PC


Heroes of Might and Magic 6 - PC


NCIS - PC


R.U.S.E - PC


Splinter Cell: Conviction - Xbox 360


Trials Evolution - PC



Assassin’s Creed’s multiplayer legacy


During the prime of older Assassin’s Creed entries, online multiplayer was a huge staple  in the franchise. Some of the beloved modes that fans of the franchise used to enjoy included PvP modes that allowed players to hash it out in intense stealth battles. There were even a number of different scenarios that could accompany these modes.


But, in newer entries, it is evident that the multiplayer aspect has become much less prominent. Some games, such as Assassin’s Creed Valhalla and Assassin’s Creed Mirage, have completely discarded the multiplayer component that older entries once leaned on.


Although these games will no longer be available for online services, players will still have great memories of them.

                              <span>While I wasn’t looking, the King’s Field-inspired RPG, Lunacid has exited Early Access and launched its full version. This happened yesterday, October 30, 2023.


Why doesn’t Steam tell me these things? The game is in my Steam library. Does Steam think I don’t want to know when an Early Access game I own updates to its full 1.0 version? An email would be nice.


Rude, uncommunicative storefront aside, Lunacid is a first-person RPG dungeon crawler inspired by FromSoftware’s 1994 PS1 title, King’s Field. King’s Field is considered the spiritual precursor to Demon’s Souls and its follow-ups. Since we haven’t seen even a hint of a re-release, the formula and aesthetic is getting picked up by indie developers, and Lunacid is an early example of it.


I’m not sure how to describe it. King’s Field is more of a vibe than anything. A gritty, gloomy,  claustrophobic dungeon crawler with a hint of unknowable horror. While Demon’s Souls borrowed that vibe, King’s Field (and, by extension, Lunacid) is not a soulslike game. They’re more focused on exploration than intricate combat.


Developed by Kira, it entered Early Access in March 2022, and was gradually built up from there. Lunacid is an excellent title in its own right. Don’t take my word for it. It currently has the coveted Overwhelmingly Positive review score on Steam. The developer seems like a cool, cool person. They have promised more bug fixes in the future and have teased that they are working on a prequel.


Lunacid is now available on PC.

                              <span>For those looking to carry the spooky vibes over to the new year, Aksys Games gave Spirit Hunter: Death Mark II a release date. The third entry in the series heads to PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and PC on February 15, 2024.


Death Mark II finds Kazuo Yashiki back in Tokyo&#x27;s H City for more supernatural investigations. This time the mystery is swirling around Konoehara Academy, which has been host to a grim shroud since the first in a series of students disappeared. Yashiki has to pose as a teacher and search for any lingering clues as to the whereabouts of these missing students. A handful of side characters — including returning faces from Spirit Hunter: Death Mark— can assist in new 2D side-scrolling exploration sections. 


The official website is live now along with the Steam page for Spirit Hunter: Death Mark II. There&#x27;s also a 14-track original soundtrack CD available for anyone who picks it up through the North American Aksys Online Store. You can see a sample of the new perspectives and more in the First Look trailer.

Still on the hunt


The series comes from Experience, the developers behind dungeon-crawlers like Demon Gaze and Stranger of Sword City. It kicked off with Spirit Hunter: Death Mark in 2017, with Spirit Hunter: NG following close behind in 2018. 


Spirit Hunter: Death Mark II was initially crowdfunded through Campfire, managing to more than double its goal for a total of over 30 million yen. We&#x27;ll see how its new 2D sections and &quot;Suspensive Acts&quot; — which have you making choices under pressure — play out early next year.

                              <span>While PC and PlayStation 5 owners are off adventuring, there&#x27;s a large faction of players still awaiting the Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 Xbox Series X|S release. Larian Studios previously stated that it should be rolling out this year, but we&#x27;ve yet to hear anything definitive. 


Today, Larian&#x27;s CEO Swen Vincke emerged to squelch any fears that may be growing from the Xbox fanbase.  Via Twitter/X, he confirmed that the title is being &quot;actively playtested&quot; and remains on schedule for 2023.




It was back in August that Vincke confirmed the game was still slated to make a 2023 release. However, the game would not make the same release window as the PlayStation 5 version as compromises (the cutting of split-screen coop) had to be made on the Xbox Series S version of the hit RPG. 


To that point, it appeared as though keeping parity across Xbox Series S and X was creating issues, as some have reported in the past. But when Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 became a smashing success on PC, Gaming CEO Phil Spencer decided that perhaps complete similarities across the Series X and Series S versions of titles weren&#x27;t entirely necessary. 


With that, the Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 Xbox release is slated for late 2023. And since Larian&#x27;s CEO confirming things are going well, Xbox players should be able to get their hands on the highly reviewed RPG at some point in the next couple of months.

Earlier today, Toby Fox celebrated the fifth anniversary of Deltarune&#x27;s original release. He also provided an update on the highly anticipated third chapter of Deltarune. The newest chapter is playable from start to finish, but not ready to be released. &quot;Obviously, releasing a game takes many more steps than just finishing the gameplay and graphics,&quot; states Fox. 


However, he mentions that work has started on the fourth chapter, which his team is very excited to continue. &quot;When we started Chapter 3, to be honest, it took a lot…</span>

What is Silent Hill Ascension?


Ascension is not a game per se, but rather a web series featuring a completely new story and cast of characters set in the infamous town. 


You can just watch the series for free if you&#x27;d like, but you — and the rest of the community — can pay to try and directly influence the evolution of the new Silent Hill canon.

To have influence over Ascension, you&#x27;ll need IP. That&#x27;s short for Influence Points. You can get some IP for free by completing daily puzzles, such as a rhythm game where you play th…</span>

Steam Scream: The Revenge – the sale&#x27;s formal title – lets players get up to 90% off on a wide selection of scary games. Although these deals end soon, the daily free rewards from the Points Shop as well as the discounted video games are worth a look if you haven&#x27;t glanced at it yet.


While there are many standout video games you can purchase in this sale, here are 10 titles I recommend for those looking to get the most scares for their buck:

                              <span>New games can bloom on the battlefield.
After what has most certainly felt like an eternity for many of us, five of the mainline Metal Gear games are now available to Nintendo fans on the Switch via Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 1. While it&#x27;s perhaps not the most pristine package that we were hoping for, it&#x27;s nevertheless a solid (ha!) compilation that provides the perfect entry-point for newcomers and a good dose of nostalgia for veterans.
With Konami now seemingly poking its head back into the world of &#x27;AAA&#x27; game development after an extended hiatus, it&#x27;s admittedly got us thinking: what exactly do we want from Metal Gear now? After all, a recent video featuring none other than David Hayter, voice actor for protagonist Snake, is causing waves in the community thanks to a rather intriguing promise that &quot;this is only the beginning&quot; (which, we admit, is likely just in relation to the &#x27;Legacy Series&#x27; itself, but we can dream).

                              <span>Heaven a good time.
This review was originally published in November 2014. We&#x27;re updating and republishing it to mark the game&#x27;s arrival in the Nintendo Switch Online NES library — and its official debut in North America nearly 40 years after its Japanese launch on Famicom.

As far as obscure releases within the NES library go, Devil World is certainly one of the most interesting. Originally released in Japan in 1984 and in Europe in 1987, this is a title that to this day has never been available to purchase in North America — not even through the wonders of Nintendo’s Virtual Console service. Nintendo of America originally passed on the title at the time of release due to self-imposed rules on the use of religious icons and themes appearing in its games. The subsidiary&#x27;s stance has evidently relaxed since then, yet Devil World nevertheless remained in the depths of unreleased game hell in the region until its 2023 debut as part of the Nintendo Switch Online subscription service.

                              <span>Switch&#x27;s biggest and best storage solution yet.
With only 32GB of storage available within the system itself (or 64GB if you have a Switch OLED), Nintendo Switch has always had one significant weak point – storing digital games. MicroSD cards have therefore been an essential accessory for any Switch owner since the console&#x27;s launch, and this new card is the best option we&#x27;ve had yet.
Trusted SD card maker SanDisk has released an all-new 1.5TB microSD solution, finally putting to bed any and all storage woes for Switch fans. Previously, the best option available was a 1TB card, with other sizes ranging from 64GB to 512GB also being popular (1.5TB is equivalent to 1,500GB).

                              <span>Make the dead, dead-er.
Publisher Forever Entertainment has today announced Night Slashers: Remake, a new and improved take on the 1994 horror beat-em-up of the same name.
We don&#x27;t have all that many details on this one just yet (neither a date nor platforms have been specified for the moment), but looking at the above teaser trailer, we reckon that Switch has to be a shoo-in for one of the consoles it is launched on.

This review was originally published in October 2012. We&#x27;re updating and republishing it to mark the game&#x27;s arrival in the Nintendo Switch Online Game Boy library.

The odds were stacked against Castlevania Legends almost from the start. When it was released towards the end of the &#x27;90s, it had the near-impossible task of following Castlevania: Symphony of the Night - a game which had revitalised Konami&#x27;s gothic series and won widespread critical acclaim.

Jusant asks players to do one thing: climb. As a silent mountaineer accompanied by a cute critter, the only thing standing between you and your mysterious mission is one very tall mountain. The journey to its summit is treacherous, but thanks to an ingenious climbing system, beautiful art direction, and intriguing world-building, inching toward the top is worth the effort. 
The intuitive climbing mechanics are the star of the show. Pressing the left and right shoulder buttons lets you grip handholds with the correspond…</span>

                              <span>Atari has announced an agreement to acquire Digital Eclipse. The studio is known for its expertise in digitally restoring and preserving retro titles such as Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration.
According to a press release, Atari aims to expand its internal development and further support its retro-focused growth strategy (citing its acquisition of Night Dive Studios earlier this year as an example) by leveraging Digital Eclipse&#x27;s proprietary tech and experience. Atari states that Digital Eclipse benefits by gaining access to “world-class IP” to grow its business and development capabilities further. 
Atari is spending $6.5 million on the acquisition ($4 million in cash, $2.5 million in newly issued Atari shares), with a remaining earn-out of up to $13.5 million in cash over the next 10…</span>

Ahead of the premiere (release? Launch?) of the experimental Silent Hill Ascension tonight, we had a chance to speak with the developer Genvid about the game (TV show? Crowd-directed narrative?) is, what it will mean to the Silent Hill universe, and how much work is going into animating the versions of the narrative that may never be seen.
Calling Ascension a video game is almost a misnomer. There is an interactive element, but you won’t be holding a controller in your hand pushing characters to make decisions in the traditional sense. Instead, viewers will download the Silent Hill Ascension app on mobile devices or PC (there is a PlayStation option, but only for viewing episodes, not participating)…</span>

                              <span>Developer Toby Fox followed up their 2015 critically acclaimed and fan-favorite 2D RPG Undertale with Deltarune Chapter 1 in 2018. This chapter was the first in what we&#x27;d later learn is a five-chapter top-down RPG with puzzles, bullet hell sequences, and Final Fantasy-inspired combat, and Chapter 1 was released for free. Fox dropped Chapter 2 in 2021 in a surprise announcement, and now, players patiently await the release of Chapter 3. Today, more than two years later, Fox has revealed an updated plan for their Deltarune release strategy. 


With Chapter 3 nearing completion, Fox plans to finish Chapter 4 and release Deltarune as a purchaseable product. And following that, development on Chapter 5 will continue and hit the game when it&#x27;s ready. To help with this, Fox has hired a producer &quot;whose entire job it will be to speed up the overall game development for future chapters,&quot; according to a new statement released. 
You can read Fox&#x27;s full statement below: 
Elsewhere in the update, Fox says Chapter 3 took a lot of trial and error to figure out how it would work but that with Chapter 4, &quot;I already feel very confident about how we can progress.&quot; They also note that people on the team are already transitioning back into working on Chapter 4 and that everybody is excited to work on that part of Deltarune. 
For more about the game, watch the original Deltarune teaser and then check out this Chapter 2 teaser. After that, read Game Informer&#x27;s Undertale review.

Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is the next canonical chapter of the Avatar mythos. Set during the one-year gap in Avatar: The Way of Water on the other side of Pandora in a new area called the Western Frontier, players control a Na’vi raised and trained by the Resources Development Administration (RDA) who finds themselves taking the fight to the corporation.

                              <span>Update, 11/01/23:
IGN and Bloomberg have learned new information about the layoffs that occurred at Destiny 2 maker Bungie this week, including that roughly 100 employees were laid off from the company. As for why, IGN&#x27;s sources report that during an employee meeting after the layoffs, Bungie CEO Pete Parsons told staff that the layoffs were due to the underperformance of Destiny 2 over the last year as well as &quot;lower-than-expected preorders&quot; for the upcoming expansion, The Final Shape. 
Employees were reportedly told that Destiny 2 player sentiment had reached an all-time-low and IGN&#x27;s sources say employees at the studio have attempted to discuss this with Bungie leadership, asking to make the necessary changes, presumably to get player sentiment back up. 
Bloomberg reports that roughly 8…</span>

                              <span>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III, the latest in the long-running FPS franchise and the first back-to-back sequel in years, is due out later this week, kind of. If you preorder a digital version of the game, you can play through its campaign early, starting November 2. That&#x27;s eight days before the full game&#x27;s release on November 10, which is when its multiplayer suite goes live. Ahead of that early campaign launch, publisher Activision Blizzard has released the PC specs and system requirements to play Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III. 
If you&#x27;ve played recent Call of Duty entries, you likely already know what you&#x27;re in for, and this year&#x27;s is not all that different. But if you&#x27;re new, or curious if you need to upgrade before this year&#x27;s entry, we&#x27;ve got you covered.

                              <span>Square Enix revealed Kingdom Hearts Missing-Link, a new GPS-based action RPG for iOS and Android devices, last year as part of its 20th Anniversary celebration, which is also where the company revealed Kingdom Hearts IV. Now, Square Enix has released a new teaser trailer for Missing-Link alongside the reveal it will launch sometime next year. 
In the teaser trailer, we see someone who is presumably the game&#x27;s protagonist in Scala ad Caelum, a special metropolis that those who have completed Kingdom Hearts III will recognize. The teaser showcases the RPG&#x27;s combat as well, which seems like a mix between some of the mechanics in Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories and standard mobile action RPG gameplay. We also see some of the Disney characters in the game, including Ariel from The Little Mermaid, Simba from The Lion King, and Baymax from Big Hero 6, to name a few. 
Check out the Kingdom Hearts Missing-Link teaser trailer for yourself below: 


Square Enix says it is now recruiting testers from the U.K. and Australia for a closed Missing-Link beta test, and if eligible, you can apply here.
Kingdom Hearts Missing-Link is due out on iOS and Android in 2024. 
For more, watch the original Missing-Link reveal trailer and then watch the Kingdom Hearts IV reveal trailer. Check out this Sora Amiibo coming out next year after that.

                              <span>Fans of Counter-Strike: GO’s Gun Game successor Arms Race rejoice: you will be able to play the popular mode in Counter-Strike 2. Eventually, that is. Valve have promised that more modes, weapons and features are headed to Global Offensive’s full-bore sequel, but they might take a little while to arrive as they respond to what players are asking for.

You’ll also be able to give it a listen - and you might notice something a little off about the announcers for its game show-within-a-game when you do. That’s right: they’re AI-generated voices, not human actors.

                              <span>Crytek have no plans to make a sequel to sweaty monster-culling FPS Hunt: Showdown, and will thus hopefully avoid the publicity problems currently faced by Activision-Blizzard&#x27;s Overwatch 2 and Valve&#x27;s Counter-Strike 2 - both presented as sequels with fancier technology, but in practice, more like service-game content seasons arbitrarily upgraded into replacements, with the &#x27;previous&#x27; games, Overwatch and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, being taken offline to avoid splitting the playerbase. 


Speaking to me in an interview about Hunt&#x27;s evolution since its launch out of early access in 2019, the game&#x27;s general manager David Fifield observed that while Crytek may yet make another Hunt game it won&#x27;t be a straight Showdown follow-up - and it certainly won&#x27;t come at the expense of your ability to play the original game.

                              <span>Back in June, when our Ed got a 30-minute hands-off glimpse of Avatar: Frontiers Of Pandora, he had suspicions that Ubisoft&#x27;s next big open world-athon was hiding some dark, terrible secret beneath the surface. It was almost too good, and too lovely-looking to be completely true, he proposed, and the brief tour of this rather enormous-looking game wasn&#x27;t quite long enough to really dig beneath the surface to see if Ubisoft&#x27;s lofty promises would hold up to closer scrutiny. 
Now, just over a month from release, I&#x27;ve finally been able to put it under a proper microscope, playing two hours of the thing from around the 25% mark of its campaign. And it really is as visually impressive as Ed suggested all those months ago. At long last, this is a game that looks and feels like an actual &quot;next-gen&quot; blockbuster (or as much as a game can, at least, when we&#x27;re already several years into the current generation cycle). But Ed was also right to feel a wee bit suspicious of Frontiers Of Pandora. Perhaps not in the way he expected, but enough that I heard the same thing being muttered over and over again by almost everyone at the end of my preview session at Ubisoft&#x27;s UK offices: &quot;I can&#x27;t work out where the heck I&#x27;m meant to be going, or what I&#x27;m supposed to do.&quot;

Organised by Esther Wallace of Oak Grove Games, and due to run till 9th November 2023, the Games for Gaza bundle includes 256 videogames, physical games, assets, soundtracks and books from 140 designers for $10, with all proceeds going to the UK-based charity Medical Aid for Palestinians.

                              <span>Apologies to the chief, but there’s a not-entirely-accurate bit in Katharine’s post announcing Starfield as October’s RPS Game Club game. I, of the RPS Treehouse, do truly love Starfield, and have only been quiet about it because admitting you enjoy The Grey Bethesda Game but couldn’t get into Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 or Elden Ring feels a bit like going to the Savoy Grill and only ordering chips. No one will ask you to leave, but they’ll probably start questioning your judgement.
But dammit, I like chips, and I like Starfield! I like its roving space captain fantasy, I like its utilitarian aesthetic, and I like how its click-clacking guns sound like extremely violent mechanical keyboards. Especially if I get to fire them at floating pirates, while I’m also floating, and said firing punts me upwards into a ceiling.

                              <span>Some people sing the praises of &quot;visceral&quot; games. Others extol the virtues of &quot;immersive&quot; games. Me, I&#x27;m increasingly drawn to &quot;perverse&quot; games. No, not like that. Well, not entirely like that. I mean &quot;perverse&quot; more straightforwardly as in deliberately awkward and unreceptive in their core design, almost self-defeating in a way that has you saying &quot;WTF?&quot; and hankering to know more.
Take The Great Below, a new horror... thingmabob from Cantabria-based Dobra Studios. It&#x27;s about exploring a strange house full of dreadful paintings in the dark. It&#x27;s a 3D game with keyboard move-look controls, but the twist is that you can only move around while looking at a 2D map, with your position marked as a pair of footprints.

                              <span>When was the last time you played a good 3D character platformer? For me, it was probably Psychonauts 2. But before that? Outside of Mario? I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d be able to tell you. For whatever reason, the 3D character platformer has become an increasingly rare breed, it would seem, which makes them even more heartening to see when they do occasionally poke their head above the parapet and leap onto our screens. Song Of Nunu: A League Of Legends Story is one of them, channelling the joyous, boundless enthusiasm of its late 90s and early 00s predecessors to create a simple, but straightforward adventure that you could just as easily enjoy alone as an adult, or with a child in tow. It did not, alas, quite make me cry as developers Tequila Works intended (that honour still belongs to Rime and Rime alone out of their back catalogue), but there&#x27;s much to admire here while having your heartstrings lightly plucked at the same time. And you don&#x27;t need to know a jot about League Of Legends to enjoy it.

                              <span>Ebay has decided we have entered Halloween season with the publication of a SPOOKY20 code good for 20% off a range of PC gaming components and peripherals (and other stuff). 
We&#x27;re zeroing in on an RX 7800 XT graphics card, the best value option from AMD&#x27;s RDNA 3 lineup. The Gigabyte Gaming OC model is down to £485 from a price of £560. That&#x27;s a good deal, with the cheapest RX 7800 XT elsewhere coming in at £510.

                              <span>If you love The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker but wish it had more blood, death and inclement weather in it, consider Sands of Aura. Released out of early access today, this is a top-down fantasy action-RPG set in a swirling, post-apocalyptic world in which you build up a town and sail between island dungeons in a sandship.
The sandship, or rather, &quot;grainwake&quot; sailing sees you bouncing merrily from dunes as vast, ominous structures loom out of the haze. The combat takes some inspiration from the Souls games, but the top-down perspective makes it feel like a classic arcade action title. Boss battles involve dodging or parrying colourful streaks, waves and clusters of projectiles. The developers, 12-person Chashu Entertainment, say it&#x27;s a difficult experience. It looks it.

Today we&#x27;re going one better, with a 27-inch model that costs just $160 with free shipping from Monoprice. The Dark Matter 27-inch monitor is one we&#x27;ve recommended before, and though it lacks the Fast IPS panel we prefer it&#x27;s still a solid option at this incredibly competitive price point.

                              <span>After spending hours poring over Alan Wake 2 this week, corkboards full of photos, red string and important little clue nuggets have definitely been on my brain. Alas, Remedy&#x27;s horror-fuelled detective &#x27;em up keeps its problem-solving a little too much at arm&#x27;s length for my tastes. Every piece of evidence you collect has its own set place on the board, for example, and heck, even the thrill of joining the dots with a set of pins and string is taken away from you, as its deduction work is all swept up in a wave of automation. 
Happily, other developers are stepping in to fill that string-based gap, and chief among them is the French-made Chronique Des Silencieux, whose Steam demo I played over lunch today. You play as a rookie detective in this charming point and click game, and your entire raison d&#x27;etre is to point out contradictions Phoenix Wright-style between testimonies you gather and the evidence you accumulate. Only instead of shouting, &quot;Objection!&quot; you do it by manually sticking pins and red string between the offending bits of information. It&#x27;s delightful, and well worth a nose if old Alan leaves you wanting this weekend.

                              <span>Capcom have unveiled the next generation of their in-house RE Engine, which came in alongside Resident Evil 7 in 2017 and has been used by a bunch of projects over the years, from the excellent Devil May Cry 5 to the forthcoming possibly-excellent Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2. RE Engine&#x27;s successor, the REX engine, is a response to three things - 1) RE Engine productions getting bigger in terms of assets, and more diverse in terms of genre, 2) RE Engine games being increasingly made by overseas developers who speak different languages, and 3) unflattering comparisons with various commercial tools, like Unreal Engine and Unity.

Playing beyond that has elevated it from &quot;not my thing but I should cover it because it&#x27;s someone else&#x27;s&quot; to &quot;wait, this might be my thing? Damn it&quot;.

In Free Range Games&#x27;s plucky dungeon sim The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria, you&#x27;re a dwarf trying to reclaim the once-proud undercity of Khazad-dûm, tunnelling between procedurally generated networks of halls and crafting your own havens and upgrade facilities from long-wrecked forges and mansions. 


 The game is set after Sauron&#x27;s defeat at the end of The Return of the King novel (spoilers, I guess?), at a time in Middle-earth canon when most of the big names were busy shaking hands and doling out promotions, but there are still plenty of orcs, trolls and other threats to worry about in Moria. Right now, though, the real headache is that I can&#x27;t make my base of operations symmetrical.

                              <span>Earlier this week, Square Enix decided to ruin over a decade&#x27;s worth of CD collecting by sticking all of their incredible Final Fantasy Piano Collection soundtracks online, for free, on pretty much every streaming service imaginable. The sheer cheek of it! Honestly, I&#x27;m still mildly shocked by it all. Just the thought of all that brilliant music, available to everyone, for zero pence and import fees. What an outstanding gift to the world. (Well, the real gift would be re-printing the fabled Final Fantasy X-2 Piano Collections CD and/or sticking that online as well, if you ask me, but hey, I&#x27;ll allow them this one little omission). 
After all, there&#x27;s an absolute treasure trove of music you lucky lot get to dig into now, so if you&#x27;re wondering where to start or just fancy yet another guided tour through some of Final Fantasy&#x27;s best music tracks, allow me to forcibly volunteer myself to regale you with some of my personal favourite highlights.

                              <span>The psychiatrist Viktor E. Frankl posited that humans are motivated, above almost all else, to search for meaning in their lives. He would probably be unsurprised, if more than slightly confused, to see that spirit manifest in a rumour that the rubbish performance of Cities: Skylines 2 is being caused by excessive teeth.


A widely-shared reddit post suggests that rendering the highly detailed chompers of Skylines 2’s citizenry, who lack the LOD (level of detail) implementation that would reduce their model quality at a distance, is a major cause behind the game’s inability to pump out frames per second. Developers Colossal Order disagree, and have put out a statement denying this &quot;bizarre story.&quot;

                              <span>You can probably guess what’s coming. Alan Wake 2’s PC performance has been the subject of nervous uh oh-ing since well before the release of its onerous system requirements; Remedy comms director Thomas Puha even implored players to &quot;look at the image quality&quot; instead of framerates, like Dean Learner exalting the storytelling of Punch of Judy.
Actually, that’s not fair. Alan Wake 2 is much more enjoyable than Punch and Judy. And, like Remedyverse predecessor Control, there is something impressive about just how much visual tech you can choose to put on show: ray tracing, path tracing, Nvidia Ray Reconstruction, frame generation via DLSS 3, the lot. This wealth of options has produced the most intricate settings guides I’ve put together in ages, and you can consult it yourself lower down this page.

                              <span>Crytek&#x27;s Hunt: Showdown may yet receive a single-player campaign, if the stars align, as the developers dig ever deeper into the asymmetrical multiplayer shooter&#x27;s wonderfully plague-ridden narrative backdrop. Originally released out of Steam and Xbox early access in 2019, the game introduced single player PvE trials back in June 2020, much to Alice0&#x27;s enthusiasm. It also now sports a scripted, voiced tutorial in which you stalk around farmhouses, learning the ropes and murdering wooden dummies at the behest of a leathery dude in the bushes. Could some kind of proper story component follow? Crytek have certainly thought about it.

                              <span>You haven&#x27;t even downloaded Remedy&#x27;s Alan Wake 2 yet, assuming you&#x27;re planning to, which means it&#x27;s already time to start thinking about what you&#x27;ll do once you&#x27;ve finished it. Apologies, the news beat is a cruel mistress and the present is always past, but in my defence, jumping irresponsibly around the timeline does make sense for a supernatural horror game that follows two characters through different dimensions.
Remedy&#x27;s plans for the game include a chunky New Game+ mode, aka &quot;Final Draft&quot;, which will hopefully arrive in late November, and two DLC packs, Night Springs and The Lake House. The first concerns Alan Wake&#x27;s fictional in-game TV show, a homage to the Twilight Zone, while the second involves &quot;an independent government organization&quot; that can surely only be the Federal Bureau of Control.

                              <span>Since Insomanic revealed its Wolverine game two years ago, fans have wondered if it’s set in the same universe as the studio’s Spider-Man games. In an interview with Kinda Funny, Spider-Man 2 director Bryan Intihar confirmed the answer is yes
When host Greg Miller asked if it had been previously confirmed or denied whether or not their spin on Wolverine shared the same Earth as its Spider-Men, Intihar replied by saying, “They’re all 1048. I think I got that right, but yeah.” Inthiar is referring to Earth-1048, which is the designation for the Marvel universe Insonmiac’s superhero games occupy.
You can watch the clip beginning at the 1:10:44 mark (thanks IGN). 


Whether or not that means we’ll see any Spider-Man references in Wolverine, which does not have a release window, remains to be seen, but that’s exciting news regardless. Marvel’s Spider-Man’s New York City is chock full of references to other heroes, such as Avengers Tower, the Sanctum Sanctorum, and the Wakandan Embassy, so it made more sense to imagine Logan doing his thing somewhere out there.
Beyond this update, we know little about Wolverine other than that it will be a mature-rated title exclusive to the PlayStation 5. As we wait to learn more details, you can read this opinion piece on why I&#x27;d like to see the two game series share the same universe.</span>

A target appears on your back when you’re a long-reigning champ. No longer the enigma you once were, contenders begin studying your body of work to figure out the path to ending your time at the top. The best way to fend off would-be challengers is to continually build and evolve. Developer EA Vancouver seems to understand this because while no legitimate contenders have emerged in the mixed-martial-arts genre, EA Sports UFC 5 retools several key areas to show the franchise isn’t resting on its laurels.
Like its predecessors, UFC 5 apt…</span>

                              <span>A new gameplay video for Little Nightmares III offers a lengthy look at its two-player cooperative gameplay. Like the previous games, this third outing looks every bit as moody and unsettling. 
This pre-alpha footage shows playable characters, Low and Alone, exploring The Necropolis, a desert-like zone, working together to overcome its many obstacles. For example, when attacked by flying beetles, one shoots them down with a bow while the other smashes the downed targets with a wrench. The kids’ biggest threat, at least in this slice, comes in the form of a giant, rampaging doll aptly known as &quot;Monster Baby&quot;. It’s supremely creepy, and you can see for yourself below.


Unlike the first two games, which were developed by Tarsier Studios, Little Nightmares III is being made by Supermassive Games, makers of Until Dawn and The Dark Pictures Anthology. It’s scheduled to launch next year for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.</span>

                              <span>Before Insomniac created its stellar Spider-Man trilogy and before Treyarch redefined web-swinging with the 2004 Spider-Man 2 movie tie-in game, the folks at Neversoft gave Spidey fans the best example of wall-crawling video game excellence with its 2000 take on the character. Spider-Man sees the friendly neighborhood hero battle a star-studded gallery of villains in an original adventure chock full of comic book goodness. As Spider-Man&#x27;s first fully 3D action-adventure game, it laid the groundwork for mechanics such as web-swinging, a variety of web shooter attacks, and wall-crawling stealth gameplay. Let&#x27;s see how it holds up 23 years later.

                              <span>After weeks of in-game teases and more, Epic Games has officially confirmed that the next season of Fortnite will bring players back to Chapter 1. With Fortnite loading screens hiding secret dates that point to Chapter 1: Season 5 and props from that season landing on this current season&#x27;s map, players have remain convinced that the next season, Chapter 4: Season 5 will actually bring everyone back to an older chapter of Fortnite; now we know it&#x27;s happening. 
Today&#x27;s reveal comes by way of the official Fortnite Twitter account, which posted, &quot;Sprint (or Mantle, your choice) back to Chapter 1...see you soon 11.3.2023 #FortniteOG&quot; with an image of the Fortnite battle bus.

As you can see, the above Tweet confirms what many have been speculating: Fortnite is going back to its Chapter 1 roots. And while not officially confirmed, it&#x27;s likely the Chapter 4: Season 5 map will have some Chapter 1: Season 5 integration on it based on teases over the past few weeks. 
Fortnite Chapter 4: Season 5 launches November 3.

The soundtrack, which also features music by composers Marcin Przybyłowicz and P.T.

The release of the Edgerunners soundtrack follows the debut of Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty last month, alongside the standard edition and Deluxe Edition release of the Phantom Liberty score. You can listen …</span>

                              <span>Earlier this year, Atari announced that it acquired Berzerk, its sequel Frenzy, and 10 other classic arcade properties. Then, earlier this month, Atari revealed Berzerk: Recharged, the first Berzerk game since the original 1980s arcade game. At the time, the company said it was coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC, and now we know exactly when: November 9. 
&quot;On November 9, Evil Otto once again invites you to his maze of maniacal chaos in the newly reimagined Berzerk: Recharged,&quot; an Atari press release reads. &quot;The latest entry in Atari&#x27;s acclaimed Recharged series, Berzerk: Recharged will have you almost begging for mercy as you face off against Otto&#x27;s droves of robotic menaces, all while the grinning incarnation of evil draws ever nearer.&quot; 
Alongside this release date news, Atari has released some additional Berzerk: Recharged screenshots you can check out below:

                              <span>Yesterday was a great day for fans of the most emo Batman in the Caped Crusader&#x27;s cinematic history because Robert Pattinson&#x27;s suit from The Batman was seemingly added to Batman: Arkham Knight. But the fun was fleeting because just a few hours later, the suit was removed.
Strangely, the suit, which first appeared in director Matt Reeve&#x27;s 2022 The Batman, was only available in the Epic Games Store version of Arkham Knight, as noticed by GeekVibesNation on Twitter and verified by GameSpot; Game Informer was not able to check the game for the suit before it was removed.

At first, fans thought the suit was a well-made mod making the rounds online before more and more people realized it was actually added. As for why it was added, nobody knows, but Game Informer reached out to Warner Bros. Games to ask about the suit and will update this story if we learn more. 
The Batman suit joins a plethora of other movie suits already in Arkham Knight, like Michael Keaton&#x27;s from the 1989 film, Batman, or Christian Bale&#x27;s from The Dark Knight. Here&#x27;s hoping The Batman suit returns soon because if screenshots players have captured are any indication, it fits right in with the dark Gotham of Arkham Knight. 
While we all wait to learn more, read Game Informer&#x27;s reviews of Arkham Asylum, Arkham City, and Arkham Knight. After that, read Game Informer&#x27;s Batman: Arkham Origins review, which is a game that just celebrated its 10-year anniversary this week.

                              <span>The first Alan Wake game was released 13 years ago, in 2010. As is the case with any cult game, new fans have been discovering it in the years since, and a recent remaster means many more have likely played the game recently. For those who played it when it came out, however, jumping into Alan Wake 2 can be confusing. The list below outlines a handful of characters worth remembering before diving into the ocean that’s not a lake.
I fully acknowledge that simply being reminded of a character with the knowledge that they will be relevant to the sequel could be conceived as a spoiler. Some of the characters below appear in person, some only in passing in documents, but they are the ones that forced me to pause the game and do a quick Google.

                              <span>In this week&#x27;s episode of The Game Informer Show, I&#x27;ve assembled a panel of experts – including Blake Hester and Charles Harte – to discuss Alan Wake 2, the 13-year follow-up to Remedy Entertainment&#x27;s cult classic thriller. After Charles gives the rest of us a refresher on all things Alan Wake, Blake regales us with his favorite non-spoiler moments from many hours into the newly-released sequel. Later, we talk about the written and physical comedy of Super Mario Bros. Wonder and how web gliding is a game changer in Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2.
Stick around &#x27;til the end of the show for a series of listener questions about soulmates, the afterlife, and the best years in gaming.

                              <span>Lithuania&#x27;s Radio and Television Commission (LRTK) is using newly gained legal authority to penalize online pirates. This new power has resulted in several rulings already and this week the media watchdog upped the ante by issuing more than two dozen monetary fines. All targets were identified through their IP-addresses and linked to the private torrent tracker Linkomanija.

                              <span>Blocking pirate sites is widely believed to reduce the number of visits to the targeted domains. However, new research based on data provided by WIPO and funded by the Republic of Korea, suggests that&#x27;s not always the case. Roughly a quarter of all domains for which data was available received more visits after they were blocked.

Jedním z nich je, že U-Boot nečte DTB soubory z adresáře /boot a druhým nefunkční boot z SD karty.</span>

                              <span>After 13 years, Alan Wake 2 is nearly here. But since the long-awaited sequel has been tossed around for over a decade, it&#x27;s fair to assume not everyone has a clear memory of the events of the first game, and some people likely never got around to playing it at all. If that sounds like you, you&#x27;re in the right place; here&#x27;s everything you need to know about the first Alan Wake to prepare for the sequel.
Arriving at Bright Falls
The game takes place in the town of Bright Falls, Washington, where the titular protagonist Alan Wake is going on vacation with his wife, Alice. Wake is an author known for his Alex Casey novels, but he hasn&#x27;t written anything new in three years. After being recognized in town several times by fans (especially Rose, the waitress at a local diner), Wake receives keys…</span>

This news comes from a new report at The Verge, which writes that Microsoft head of studios and corporate vice president Matt Booty has been promoted to president of game content and studios, and that Microsoft corporate vice president Sarah Bond has been promoted to Xbox president. She will oversee all Xbox platform responsibilities. 
The Verge also reports that after 32 years, chief marketing officer Chris Capossela is stepping down from Microsoft. 
In Booty&#x27;s new position, he will &quot;lead an expanded organization inside Microsoft Gaming that now includes ZeniMax and Bethesda,&quot; according to the publication.…</span>

                              <span>Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2 hit PlayStation 5 exclusively last week and it&#x27;s already Sony&#x27;s fastest-selling first-party game. While we loved the game – read Game Informer&#x27;s Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2 here – once players got their hands on the game, some encountered a few bugs and issues, like one where their character model became a small white cube that looks like tofu. Plus, players discovered a Cuban flag was displayed inside and outside the Morales household rather than the expected Puerto Rican flag. A new update for Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2 out today fixes both of these issues and more. 


Version 1.001.003 is now live in-game, and it brings a few fixes to the game, including the aforementioned flag issue and white cube issue. It also addresses an issue where The Amazing 2 Suit&#x27;s spider logo appeared too bright in-game, and improves the game&#x27;s stability. Here&#x27;s the full update breakdown: 
Addressed an issue where an incorrect flag was displayed
Addressed an issue where models would not load properly after long play sessions
Addressed an issue where The Amazing 2 Suit&#x27;s Spider logo appeared too bright
Improved stability
Developer Insomniac Games has also released a statement alongside the above patch notes specifically addressing the flag issue. 
&quot;Today&#x27;s patch corrects an error where the Cuban flag was incorrectly displayed instead of the Puerto Rican flag,&quot; it reads. &quot;We understand that accurate representation matters, and greatly regret this error. We sincerely apologize and will do better in the future.&quot; 


Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2 hit PlayStation 5 exclusively on October 20.

Its release this week comes after developer Remedy Entertainment delayed the game 10 days earlier this summer. While there are plenty of visual options for players playing on PC – check out Alan Wake 2&#x27;s PC spec requirements here – there are only two graphics modes for those picking it up on PS5 and Xbox Series X (and just one on Xbox Series S). But first, be sure to read Game Informer&#x27;s Alan Wake 2 review.  
Below, we&#x27;ll dive into the two graphics modes for Alan Wake 2 on PS5 and Xbox Series X, and then a handful of Game Informer editors playing the game will share the mode they&#x27;ve opted to experience Remedy&#x27;s latest in.

Remedy is known for being experimental. It mixes live-action footage into its video games, plays with player expectations, rewards those devoted to the developer’s history and gameography, and in the case of Alan Wake 2, eagerly performs big-budget lunacy for our entertainment and sometimes confusion. The highs of Alan Wake’s follow-up adventure are tall, but there are frequent lows that drag the whole experience into The Dark Place. I also encountered a number of bugs that forced frequent restarts and one full reinstallat…</span>

                              <span>Publisher CI Games and developer Hexworks released Lords of the Fallen, its soft reboot of the 2014 Lords of the Fallen, earlier this month, on Friday the 13th. It didn&#x27;t quite land for us – Game Informer gave it a 6 out of 10 – but a new update that launches later today fixes one of the major problems we had with the soulslike. That&#x27;s because the new Pumpkin Patch update that launches at 2 p.m. PT/5 p.m. ET today comes with reduced enemy density. Plus, the patch brings full crossplay to the game alongside performance and stability fixes and more. 
The Pumpkin Patch update also brings a special in-game Halloween celebration to the setting of Mournstead that starts today and ends November 2.

                              <span>Earlier this week, Microsoft revealed the launch of Starfield led to a 13% increase in overall Xbox content and services revenue in its Fiscal Year 2024 Quarter 1 financials. Now, Capcom has released its latest round of financials – the six-month period that ended in September – and in it, reveals that both income and profit are up thanks to the excellent launches of its Resident Evil 4 remake and Street Fighter 6. 
Total game sales are up from 21.3 million this time last year to 22.6 million units, resulting in a net sales increase of 53%, from 49,067 million Yen to 74,934 million Yen. Operating income is up 55%, too. As for why, Capcom points to the release of its Resident Evil 4 remake, which it released back in March, Street Fighter 6, which hits PlayStation, Xbox, and PC in June, and its Monster Hunter series. 


Resident Evil 4 has sold 5.45 million units, while Street Fighter 6 is at 2.47 million units sold. Monster Hunter Rise, with its Sunbreak expansion, has crossed 6.5 million units sold. Capcom has also revealed that its remake of Resident Evil 2 has sold more than 13 million units, with its remake of Resident Evil 3 sitting at 8 million units sold. The recently released Monster Hunter Now, a Monster Hunter take on Pokemon Go, has been downloaded more than 10 million times by players as of last week. 
Capcom says the entire Resident Evil series has sold more than 150 million units, with Monster Hunter crossing 95 million. The Street Fighter franchise sits at 52 million. Here are some other series highlights: 
Mega Man: 41 million units sold
Devil May Cry: 30 million units sold
Dragon&#x27;s Dogma: 7.9 million

                              <span>Alan Wake 2 finally hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC tomorrow, on Friday, October 27. After the wait was extended by a 10-day delay, the game&#x27;s release is almost here. After getting a new launch trailer yesterday that showed more of this spooky world, developer Remedy Entertainment has another pre-launch update to share: New Game+ will arrive sometime after the game&#x27;s launch. 
This New Game+ mode will allow players to retain all unlocked weapons and upgrades. Plus, it will feature a new Nightmare difficulty level and an &quot;alternative narrative&quot; that includes new manuscript pages and new video content. Remedy says it&#x27;s due sometime after launch but that the release timing of it is still to be decided. 
New Game+ coming after launch.

CDPR continue to fix them, too. Patch 2.02 is out now.

                              <span>Ubisoft&#x27;s multiplayer Jolly Rog &#x27;em up Skull and Bones is caught on the reefs once again. Recently tipped to appear in early fiscal year 2023-2024, it&#x27;s now due to make landfall in the publisher&#x27;s FYQ4 - sometime between January and March 2024. What&#x27;s the Golden Age of Piracy equivalent for &quot;vapourware&quot;? I&#x27;m picturing a spectral vessel like the Flying Dutchman, crewed by glum-faced producers and with a big grimacing statue of company CEO Yves Guillemot affixed to the prow.


The troubled naval combat sim isn&#x27;t the only Ubisoft project experiencing misadventures. As revealed in their latest earnings report, the publisher have also pushed back a mysterious &quot;large game&quot;, originally due to launch before the end of their current fiscal year, to the next fiscal year, which means at some point after 31st March 2024. Speculation runs rife that the anonymous blockbuster is Ubisoft Massive&#x27;s Star Wars Outlaws.

                              <span>Valve have spent the past year or so gradually updating the Steam interface, partly to bring parity across its various forms such as the handheld Steam Deck and on-the-telly Big Picture mode. Now it&#x27;s virtual reality&#x27;s turn, with the launch of SteamVR 2.0.

                              <span>Every road network I ever constructed in Cities: Skylines had deep-rooted performance issues I&#x27;d then spend dozens more happy hours trying to unravel. I hope Colossal Order are having a similarly fun time trying to fix the performance issues present in Cities: Skylines 2, which launched earlier this week. The first patch is out now and it includes optimisations for rendering, fog, depth-of-field and more designed to make the citybuilder&#x27;s framerates less gridlocked.

It&#x27;s much more common to see 27-inch monitors at this resolution, with a 24-inch screen providing a sharper image as a result of a higher DPI. This model from Chinese manufacturer Koorui also comes with a Fast IPS panel with 1ms GtG pixel response times and a 165Hz refresh rate, making it a great choice for fast-paced gaming too. 
This Koorui monitor has also been reduced in price, dropping from an initial MSRP of $400 to just $200 after a cool 50% reduction - with a $15 gift card thrown in too.

                              <span>Ask RPS returns for another installment today, this time focusing on some of our daily food and drink habits. Technically, I have mashed two supporter questions into one for this post, as to me they seemed inherently linked, because what is the point of tea/coffee if not to also have a nice biscuit and a sit down at the same time?
With that in mind, today&#x27;s questions come courtesy of caff, who asked: What is your favourite biscuit? and PolygonClassicist, who asked: What are the caffeine habits of the RPS staff? (along with the extra sub-question clarifications of: when do we like to have our coffee, espresso, tea, soda and/or energy drinks? How do we like to consume them? And how much caffeine do we all consume on a daily basis?) Come and find out how we all get through the day (in a, err, not at all dark way) below!

                              <span>OK, so there&#x27;s plenty in Worldless that won&#x27;t remind you of Silksong or its predecessor, Hollow Knight. Rather than a medieval bug exploring a labyrinth of bioluminescent rot and lore, you&#x27;re a vaguely humanoid cloud of shards and points, roaming an abstract landscape of soft curves and shafts of light. You&#x27;re Rayman but fancy, basically, and the world is no world but an uncreated expanse of elemental forces, though you&#x27;ll find you can run and jump on it much as you can the ledges of Hallownest. The combat is a different beast, too. Rather than Souls-inflected 2D hack-and-slash, it&#x27;s turn-based battling with a twist - each turn gives you a countdown in which to perform real-time combos, mixing melee and magical attacks. 


So why does Worldless make me think of Team Cherry&#x27;s work? Partly it&#x27;s the underlying touch of metroidvania, a word the press materials seem oddly hesitant to use. The map extends in all directions and you&#x27;ll need to acquire new abilities to reach certain areas. Partly, it&#x27;s the shared enchanted grotto atmosphere, with all sorts of tiny animate details festering for attention as you explore. And partly, it&#x27;s the dash move you unlock early on, and the process of chaining it with a platform-conjuring ability to unlock routes while traversing them, which puts me strongly in mind of those horizontal gauntlet runs from the Silksong trailer. All told, if you&#x27;re beginning to crisp up for lack of Hollow Knight news, you might want to give the demo a whirl ahead of Worldless&#x27;s release on (drum roll) 21st November 2023.

                              <span>The Alan Wake 2 review embargo lifts today, but ours needs a bit more time in the oven. Review code only came in late Sunday night, and for a game so heavily reliant on the thrust and resolution of its story, it&#x27;s imperative I get to the end of it before I deliver my final verdict. Alas, the business of running a website does not play nicely with tight review deadlines like this, but what I can tell you after 15-odd hours of play is that it&#x27;s really sunk its claws into me good and proper. 
Alan Wake 2 is a much creepier, more unnerving kind of horror game than its predecessor, doubling down on its fiction-meets-reality schtick while also piling on the scares and interlacing it with unsettling imagery of teeth-gnashing, inkblot-stained doppelgangers to ratchet up the tension. In many ways, this is a game that owes as much to Resident Evil 7 as it does its own lineage in the genre, and the dual narratives of its two protagonists, FBI agent Saga Anderson and Alan himself, arguably make this Remedy&#x27;s most sophisticated tale yet.

                              <span>What better way to follow up my interview with Just Stop Oil than by writing about a horror game set on a haunted oil rig? The game in question is, of course, Still Wakes The Deep from Dear Esther and Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs developer The Chinese Room. Set off the coast of Scotland in the 1970s, it sees you navigating collapsing gantries and flooded rooms while avoiding an unearthly terror apparently extracted from the ocean floor. Mind you, the worst thing in the game could be the weather, which you can witness for yourself in the latest gameplay trailer below. Never mind the dreadful moaning on the other side of the pipes - how about that drizzle?

                              <span>At EGX earlier this month, climate change protestors cosplaying as the Ghostbusters interrupted a Tekken 7 tournament, spraying player screens with orange paint and attempting to make a speech before being hauled off by security. The three protestors, who were later arrested, are members of Just Stop Oil, a British activist group officially founded in February 2022 who carry out acts of nonviolent obstruction and vandalism in the hope of rallying support against the UK government granting new fossil fuel licenses and production agreements. In the case of EGX, which is run by Rock Paper Shotgun&#x27;s parent company Reedpop, Just Stop Oil were protesting against the sponsorship of one EGX stage by Barclays Bank, who have financed billions of dollars of fossil fuel investments (Barclays have provided some official comment down the page). They were also trying to call attention to oil giant Shell&#x27;s sponsorship deal with Fortnite, which includes a special themed map &quot;powered by Shell V-Power(r) NiTRO+ Premium Gasoline&quot;.
I&#x27;ve written a bit here and there about the overlap between games, video games and protest movements. I&#x27;ve also been on a JSO protest march myself - albeit, slightly by accident (no, I didn&#x27;t glue myself to anything). I was curious to hear more about the EGX protest, and specifically, whether the group&#x27;s tactical use of cosplay for both dramatic effect and subterfuge represents any broader understanding of games as a form of protest art. JSO put me in touch with Oliver Clegg, a 20-year-old student who joined the group early on and has participated in some of their better-known direct actions. The below is a transcript of that conversation which has been edited down for length and clarity.

Two weeks ago FileWarez was suddenly gone; no forum, no Discord, no Telegram. Even the site&#x27;s moderators seemed confused. Global music industry group IFPI now confirms that with their assistance, Brazil&#x27;s Cyber Gaeco unit forced FileWarez to shut down after more than 19 years online.

                              <span>Metal Gear Solid 3 arrived on PC for the first time yesterday thanks to the stealth-action series’ Master Collection. Unfortunately, it seems to be a fairly underwhelming PC debut for Hideo Kojima’s frog-munching masterpiece, with Snake Eater’s Steam page full of negative reviews about the barebones port’s restriction to 720p resolution, reported startup crashes and lack of Steam Deck support.

The biggest reveal, though, is that the Ark remake will apparently drop on Steam later today.

We weren’t alone in that anticipation either, as the ambitious medieval strategy game - created by a solo dev, no less - rocketed up the Steam charts to become one of its most wishlisted games.

                              <span>It&#x27;s hard to imagine blockblustery first-person shooting today without Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare&#x27;s online progression systems, which - inasmuch as you can assign this much clout to a single game or developer - transformed the genre back in 2007 by reinventing multiplayer as a kind of RPG. Shooters without COD-style gear levelling ladders do exist, not least Counter-Strike 2, but most of the juggernauts depend on such fixtures, especially now that free-to-play service models have become the norm. So it&#x27;s jarring to hear from Mackey McCandlish, one of Modern Warfare&#x27;s original developers, that the old Infinity Ward team were split over the act of using XP to unlock guns, with some worrying it would be &quot;unfair&quot;.

                              <span>Last time, you decided that present decisions deciding past events is better than that puzzle where switches turn on some things while turning off others. I can&#x27;t say I am surprised by the result, and suspect it was heavily influenced by spite, but I am very grateful to the people who stood up and explained why they like that puzzle where etc. I do try to make a case for both things but won&#x27;t pretend I understand (or appreciate) every thing in games, so I appreciate your help. This week, I ask you to pick between two ways of being there and then not. What&#x27;s better: summoning spectral animals or blink teleports?

Every October it pops up to make your Halloween season orange and flickery with a host of digital carved pumpkins on display in a lovely gallery you can take a calming walk around. I hope this comes to be a seasonal tradition on RPS as unshakeable as Skeal at Christmas. And it&#x27;s pay-what-you-can on Itch!

                              <span>When two of a game&#x27;s weapons are nailguns, you should probably expect players to be enthusiastic about construction. Following last year&#x27;s excellent Brutalist Jam map pack, Quake mappers have reunited to release another free load of levels inspired by Brutalism and concrete. The 30 maps offer good honest fragging in everything from concrete cities to murderous mystical puzzle boxes. Honestly, I&#x27;d recommend downloading the pack even if only to see the hub level and marvel at quite how good Quake can look when made for modern PCs.

It&#x27;s a turn-based tactics RPG with a Gothic historical setting, an extremely late-noughties insanity mechanic, a heavy metal soundtrack, plagues, heresy, dynastic feuding, and a protagonist with a dramatic eye scar and possibly non-metaphorical &quot;inner demons&quot;. Amongst other things, it looks like you can run people over with a horse-drawn carriage. M-Rated enough for you, edgelords? Here&#x27;s the trailer.

The developers include a few thoughts about what performance means for a management sim like Skylines 2, revealing that they considered delaying release to improve and stabilise the game, but felt that postponing launch would be &quot;unfair&quot; to those who are less bothered by such things.

                              <span>“Not everyone is Nintendo,” Hilmar Veigar Pétursson says. “Corporate entities, historically, are not very long-living. By being 30 years old, CCP is old by company standards.” As we talk, his fixation on persistence and artefact becomes clear. Though, he’s never hidden it. In 2014, Pétursson’s company, CCP, unveiled a five-metre-tall sculpture with the names of every active player in their MMO, EVE Online, etched into its surface; this year, they expanded the monument to add the names of players who have subscribed in the decade since. “I&#x27;ve been obsessed about doing things like printed books, magazines, models of EVE Online...,” Pétursson tells me, “like there&#x27;s this need to leave a footprint.” 



Pétursson has discovered a company that uses cow stem cells to 3D print calfskin. For the studio’s 30th anniversary, he plans to commission a poetry chapter inspired by Iceland’s epic history book, the Prose Edda, write it on the artificial skin, and put it in a Reykjavik museum. It would sit alongside an ancient calfskin copy of the Icelandic sagas. “It was written 1000 years ago, but as an Icelandic person, I can still read and understand what it says,” Pétursson explains. He tells me that it’s an effective way of storing data because if you sent a USB stick 1,000 years into the future, where would you even find a computer with a drive to read it? This appreciation for artefacts and need for legacy has led to his current project, a new game from CCP using blockchain technology, currently known as Project Awakening.

                              <span>American McGee has spent the past several years trying to make Alice: Asylum, a third entry in his series of action-horror games inspired by Lewis Carroll&#x27;s Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland. That fight produced a crowdfunded 414-page design bible but came to an end earlier this year when rights-holders EA rejected the pitch, and McGee declared that he had &quot;no other ideas or energy left to apply toward getting a new Alice game made.&quot;

McGee reiterated similar sentiments in a new video discussing the project&#x27;s end, but he did suggest one &quot;ray of hope&quot; to the community. &quot;The design bible as produced is the perfect thing to feed into an AI system to have it completely build the game that is outlined in that design bible.&quot;

                              <span>Austrian law enforcement agencies have revealed details of a major operation against a pirate IPTV network claimed to have generated up to €11m during the last three years. Following a TV company complaint, 40 investigators arrested 20 Turkish suspects living in Austria and Germany. Authorities seized €1.6m, 60 bank accounts, and an Audi A7. After seven months in custody, the main suspects have reportedly confessed.

                              <span>In 2008, Robert Downey Jr. debuted as Tony Stark in Iron Man. Outside of being an excellent movie in its own right, Iron Man proved to be one of the most influential films of the 21st century so far, paving the way to the biggest film and TV franchise of the last decade and a half, the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The post-credits sequence of Iron Man served as a teaser for what was to come, as Samuel L. Jackson&#x27;s Nick Fury informed Stark that he was a part of a bigger universe.
At the time, &quot;The Avenger Initiative&quot; felt like a throwaway tease for something that would never happen (even for those involved in writing the scene), but films starring Captain America, Thor, and Hulk started building an unprecedented interconnectivity.

                              <span>Alan Wake 2 is almost here. It hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC this Friday, on October 27, after developer Remedy Entertainment delayed it 10 days earlier this summer. With just two days until launch, Remedy released the Alan Wake 2 launch trailer during today&#x27;s Xbox Partner Preview, which is where we also saw our first gameplay from Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater and Ikaro: Will Not Die, the new game from the makers of Powerwash Simulator. 
In the trailer, we see dual protagonists Saga Anderson and the titular Alan Wake come to grips with the latter&#x27;s ability to influence the real world with words written on his typewriter. Like the game, this trailer mixes Alan Wake 2&#x27;s live-action elements with gameplay, and both look great. The gameplay continues to deliver the spooky action thrills previously seen in other trailers, and we get a new glimpse of the game&#x27;s story. 
Check out the Alan Wake 2 launch trailer for yourself below: 


Alan Wake 2 hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on October 27. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer&#x27;s hands-on with a Saga Anderson section of Alan Wake 2 and then read what we thought about playing as Alan Wake. After that, watch this Saga Anderson-focused Alan Wake 2 NGT and then check out this Alan Wake-focused NGT. Make sure your PC is ready for Alan Wake 2&#x27;s beefy system requirements, too.

First revealed last August, the game has only been playable in closed playtests over the last year. 
A new trailer premiering during today’s Xbox Partner Preview shows off the first-person shooter, in which teams compete in virtual arenas for the delight of a cheering audience (and potential sponsors). Arenas, which are based on recognizable real-world locations, are fully destructible and can be altered by players.
The open beta adds the new Skyway Stadium to the map rotation. The beta also introduces a new game mode called Bank-It, in which four teams of three fight to gather coins, with the winner either hitting a max limit first or having the most cash banked at the end of the round. 


Players will have access to 20 weapons, 26 gadgets, and 9 abilities used to reduce targets into showers of gold coins. Item progression will feature 5 Mastery Levels per weapon as well. 
The open beta is cross-platform, so players on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and Steam can jump in. It will run until November 5. The beta includes a free battle pass with 16 exclusive, permanent rewards that carry over to the game’s eventual full launch.</span>

                              <span>Today during Xbox&#x27;s most recent Partner Preview livestream, developer Studio Wildcard showed off its remake of Ark: Survival Evolved, titled Ark: Survival Ascended. And fittingly, it did so by showing off a whole host of dinosaurs.
 We got flying dinos, stalking dinos, and swimming dinos. You&#x27;re hunting dinos, riding dinos, and hanging with dinos. And most notably, it looks great, having been rebuilt from the ground up with Unreal Engine 5. 
Check out the trailer below:


Interestingly, Survival Ascended will have cross-platform modding on all platforms, as revealed in a post on the Xbox Wire. It looks like PC players will have the ability to actually make modes, as it requires the Ark Devkit, downloaded from the Epic Launcher, but playing mods will be available for everyone.
The original Ark: Survival Evolved was released back in 2015.</span>

                              <span>Today&#x27;s Xbox Partner Preview brought us a new look at Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, the remake announced earlier this year. In the trailer, we get a first look at the game&#x27;s use of Unreal Engine 5 alongside some quick snippets of tactical espionage action.
While what&#x27;s shown is definitely gameplay, it doesn&#x27;t appear to be final as the trailer calls it the &quot;first in-engine look.&quot; Plus, the gameplay is watermarked with a &quot;pre-alpha footage&quot; tag.
Check out the Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see in the trailer above, we see Big Boss sneaking through jungles, over wooden bridges, through World War 2-esque trenches, and more. There&#x27;s nothing pointing toward the game&#x27;s story in this trailer but it does make one thing clear: this remake is going to be beautiful if today&#x27;s showing is any indication. And the gameplay looks solid and intact – exactly what you&#x27;d imagine a 2023 remake of this 2004 classic would look like. 
Revealed back in May, coincidentally during a PlayStation Showcase, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is a from-the-ground-up remake of the third Metal Gear Solid game originally released in 2004. Like the original, this remake is a 1960s-era prequel to the Metal Gear series that tells the origin story of Big Boss. As such, it serves as a foundational narrative to the wider Metal Gear universe. 
Here are a few screenshots from today&#x27;s showing:

                              <span>Today’s Xbox Partner Preview brought us a good look at Still Wakes The Deep, the new game from The Chinese Room, a studio known for projects like Dear Esther, Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs, and Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture.
The new project has distinct horror vibes as it drops players into the shoes of a character navigating a ruined oil rig. A strange, alien-like tentacled form reaches up from beneath the roiling ocean waters – seemingly the source of the oil rig’s trouble. As the protagonist navigates the catwalks and beams of the rig, we hear distant and troubling screams. After traversing several tunnels, the first-person lead drops through a hatch into the very water that seems to be the source of the strange tendrils.
The Chinese Room is clearly interested in building atmosphere and tension in this trailer and, presumably, doing the same in the broader game. There’s clearly some awful threat at play aboard the rig, but its nature and what is happening to the others on board the rig remain a mystery.
Nonetheless, the first-person visuals and tense exploration are looking great, leaving us excited for the game’s launch on Xbox Series X/S (including Game Pass) in early 2024.</span>

The game is billed as a momentum-based action roguelite, with players zipping around neon-soaked cyberpunk world dishing out rapid melee attacks while executing air dashing and somersaults to evade and outmaneuver enemies. Check out its first trailer below. 


Ikaro Will Not Die doesn’t have a release date, but it’s coming to Xbox Series X/S and PC.</span>

                              <span>The upcoming Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth will have its own in-game resort island getaway that plays not too dissimilar from the Animal Crossing games. Happy Resort DonDoko Island was shown off today during Xbox&#x27;s most recent Partner Preview livestream.  
Players will be able to build the island to their liking – including customizing their homes, building infrastructure, and interacting with the island&#x27;s inhabitants. You can see the mode in action below:


While Infinite Wealth is out on January 26, 2024, developer Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio has more games up its sleeve. Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name, a bridge between Yakuza 6 and Yakuza: Like A Dragon, is out this year on November 8. Additionally, back in February, the studio released Like a Dragon: Ishin, a remake of the 2014 game Ryu Ga Gotoku: Ishin, which never came to the States.</span>

                              <span>Earlier this month, Sony revealed new slim models of its PlayStation 5 hardware. Both the disc drive and digital model are getting upgrades, but alongside this news, the company also revealed a new detachable disc drive. This optional drive can be added to a new slim model of the digital PS5, turning it into a console that can use discs. It seems this drive will require an internet connection to use, however. 
Some images of a potentially upcoming Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III slim PS5 bundle have leaked online (thanks, CharlierIntel) and in the small text on the box, it says, &quot;Internet connection required to pair Disc Drive and PS5 console upon startup.&quot;
Hey, @PlayStation &amp; @cerny, we need to talk!

Understandably, many players and video game preservationists aren&#x27;t enthused about the online requirement as there could come a day when the servers the console and disc drive attach to are offline, making the optional accessory useless. Given the text on the box, it sounds like the internet connection is a one-time thing, only needed to pair the disc drive with the console, but it&#x27;s unclear if it&#x27;s required after that. 
Game Informer has reached out to PlayStation to ask about the internet connection requirement and if a connection is required beyond initial setup; we will update this story if we learn more. 
The same leaked images that you can see above also point to an unannounced Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III slim PS5 bundle that comes with the console, a DualSense controller, and the game.
For more, catch up on all the biggest Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III news from a recent COD Next livestream, and then read about how Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III won&#x27;t come to Xbox Game Pass this year, even after Microsoft acquired Activision Blizzard earlier this month.

                              <span>Starfield hit Xbox Series X/S and PC last month, and it became the biggest Bethesda game launch ever, later earning it the top spot on best-selling games in the U.S. last month. Now, thanks to Microsoft&#x27;s Fiscal Year 2024 Quarter 1 financial results, we know more than 11 million players have played Starfield to date. Starfield&#x27;s excellent launch resulted in a 13% increase in overall Xbox content and services. However, despite the financial boon on the Xbox services side, overall Xbox hardware was still down 7%. 
That&#x27;s according to Microsoft executive vice president and chief financial officer Amy Hood, who also revealed during the financial results call yesterday that Xbox Game Pass experienced &quot;better-than-expected&quot; subscriber growth; Microsoft did not share any updated Game Pass subscri…</span>

                              <span>Nightdive Studios have made a name for themselves by remastering numerous &#x27;90s classics, mostly first-person shooters. Next in line is their Star Wars: Dark Forces remaster, which was announced in August. Now it has a release date: February 28th, 2024.

                              <span>Rocksmith is Ubisoft&#x27;s take on Guitar Hero, with the key difference being that you can play it with a real guitar. That makes it a good teaching tool as much as it is a game. Or made it a good teaching tool, anyway - Rocksmith 2014 has been removed from sale almost ten years to the day after it launched.

                              <span>Massive SATA SSDs are getting ever more affordable, and this is the best 4TB deal we&#x27;ve ever seen here at RPS. You can get a TeamGroup T-Force Vulcan Z 4TB drive for just $138 at Newegg, down from a previous price of $180. 
In fact, this is half the price of a deal we were eagerly posting about just one year ago, which really speaks to the speed at which SSD storage has collapsed in price in 2023.

                              <span>LG&#x27;s C2 OLED is my top TV recommendation for PC and console gaming, and the 42-inch and 48-inch versions can even work as PC monitors. Today the 48-inch model has dropped to £824 at Ebay when you use codes BONUS10 and SAVE100OLED, a great price for what is a class-leading 48-inch OLED. For context, this year&#x27;s basically identical 48-inch C3 OLED costs £1100, so you&#x27;re saving nearly £300.

                              <span>A few weeks ago I wrote about Grand Theft Auto players describing the movement of planes in random GTA promotional art as evidence of a forthcoming GTA 6 reveal, timed to intersect with the waning gibbous moon. I thought that the furore might die down after GTA 6 failed to materialise in accordance with the lunar cycle, but it turns out this rabbit hole has no bottom.
Come now, gaze upon the above, just-posted Rockstar promotional image for a new Red Dead Online outfit. To my eye, that picture looks like a weird dude in a mask, gazing at you through piles of skulls. Standard Halloween gamer fare. But it turns out that when you draw lines on it using MS Paint, you end up with the below.

                              <span>One of the most unnerving things about Geometric Interactive&#x27;s lush insect puzzler Cocoon is how intuitive it feels. For my money, anyway. The premise is perfectly brain-bending: each world contains or is contained by another world, and you&#x27;re a beetle who can not only leap between them, but pick one world up and use it as a puzzle prop inside another.
The game doesn&#x27;t really verbalise any of this: there&#x27;s no equivalent for Atreus in God Of War: Ragnarok, ostentatiously nudging you towards each solution. And yet somehow, I find myself flowing through Cocoon like I&#x27;m being poured out of a bottle, switching scales and putting together the pieces in a way that feels effortful yet graceful, earned yet... eerily frictionless. This is no reflection on my knack for solving puzzles. It&#x27;s a show of how elegantly the game is made so that while there&#x27;s difficulty, there&#x27;s rarely frustration.

                              <span>Puzzle game Suika, or &#x27;That Watermelon Game&#x27;, is currently having a bit of a moment online. It&#x27;s been available on Switch for a couple of years now in Japan, but this week it received an English eShop version, and it&#x27;s taken off a bit with streamers and Twitch folk. It&#x27;s also spawned dozens of clones, including an unofficial free web browser version that I&#x27;ve been giving a go over the last couple of lunch times to see what all the fuss is about. It&#x27;s a neat little time waster. It&#x27;s a teensy bit different to the proper Switch version, but the basic concept is the same: it&#x27;s a essentially physics-based fruit Tetris meets Threes, where you&#x27;re dropping similar-looking fruits on top of one another to combine them into even larger fruits. 
The goal is to combine them enough times to get the big watermelon for mega points, but honestly, I&#x27;m not sure how much longer I can keep playing this free version of Suika, because so many of the fruits you meet along the way to the watermelon just look so gosh darn sad that it&#x27;s breaking my heart a little. Then again, if I was a pear, I&#x27;d probably have a pretty sour-looking face, too, if I&#x27;m honest.

                              <span>I like to-do list games. Take Wytchwood, where your to-do list is stuff like &#x27;craft trap to catch lizard to use lizard eyes to craft weapon to defeat ghost to...&#x27; and so on. My Little Universe, which is clearly best played in co-op, and would be good to play with kids if you have sourced any of those from somewhere, is like a to-do list game that reduces crafting to the barest minimum. You are basically collecting raw resources and pouring them into a bottomless maw. Despite that description, it&#x27;s quite charming.

                              <span>Stretch and compress rooms to make your escape in Stretchmancer, a nice little puzzle-platformer you can play for free. Your heroic gecko is a Stretchmancer, see, able to bend the dimensions of spaces to push walls far away and draw distant objects near. This is handy when trying to defeat an evil space empire. Stretchmancer is in a similar vein to Portal: a first-person puzzle-platformer which uses one neat trick to change how you see the world, and builds on that while a baddie taunts you. It&#x27;s short, it&#x27;s free, it&#x27;s fun, and you might enjoy it slightly breaking your eyes.

                              <span>Cities: Skylines 2 is, much like the wonkily roaded, pollution-choked helltown I’ve built within it, a work in progress. Developers Colossal Order upped the citybuilding sequel’s system requirements well in advance of launch, and more recently admitted to have &quot;not achieved the benchmark we targeted&quot; for PC performance. Instead, future improvements are promised, to patch Skylines 2 into better shape.
I wish I could say that this is all just pessimism, born from an overabundance of caution and expectation management. But no, it is just a bit of a mess, one capable of putting freshly mixed concrete shoes on even the fastest graphics cards. I’ve worked out a best settings guide that, compared to the available graphics presets, can better balance performance and visuals – though be warned that this will feel more like urgent repair work than a dream remodel.

This is just a quick Codec to let you know that Konami&#x27;s stealth blockbuster bundle Metal Gear Solid - Master Collection Volume 1 is now available to buy. Did you ever play Metal Gear Solid, Snake? It&#x27;s this sprawling philosophical epic about war, surveillance, AI, nationalism and anti-heroism, a baroque metafictional saga spanning generations that is also a complex series of videogame design experiments. I know - it&#x27;s a lot to take in, Snake, but you can sort of boil the series down to the difference between two varieties of wall. There are the ones you hide behind, so as to get the drop on your foes, and there are the ones you break, because they&#x27;re fourth walls, Snake. Do you see?

                              <span>The Elder Scrolls 6 is going to be a mixture of new ideas and RPG systems that go all the way back to The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion, according to Bethesda&#x27;s former design director Bruce Nesmith, who was lead designer on The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim and senior designer on Starfield. In particular, Nesmith reckons it will &quot;absolutely&quot; continue with Skyrim&#x27;s approach to levelling and progression, whereby you improved skills by performing the associated actions. He also thinks the game will &quot;probably&quot; retain elements of the magic system he designed for Skyrim, which broke away from Oblivion and Morrowind in being simpler to understand and more immediately powerful, at the price of flexibility and inventiveness.

                              <span>In August, Night Dive Studios announced it was remastering the classic ‘90s first-person shooter Star Wars: Dark Forces. We now know that this modernization of one of the most beloved Star Wars games is coming on February 28. 
Night Dive, a studio specializing in reviving classic games such as its remake of System Shock that launched in May, is shining up the 1995 Star Wars title with 4K resolution and a 120 fps bump (on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC). Textures and lighting have been enhanced, and controls have been modernized to support today’s gamepads. That includes platform-specific features such as gyro/motion controls, rumble, and a new weapon wheel. The cherry on top is that Dark Forces Remaster has achievements/trophies.


Dark Forces stars Kyle Katarn, a mercenary who defected from the Galactic Empire and joined the Rebel Alliance. He’s tasked with infiltrating the Empire and foiling its plans to create an army of powerful new stormtroopers and battle droids, better known as the Dark Trooper Project. It was the first Star Wars FPS game and is remembered as one of the better Doom-inspired games of the time. 
Star Wars: Dark Forces Remaster is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. You can watch some former GI editors play the original version in this classic episode of Replay, and learn about the making of Dark Forces in this retrospective feature.</span>

However, some players have spotted a mishap related to one of the game&#x27;s main protagonists, Miles Morales. His mother is Puerto Rican, and Miles is too, which is why some players found it odd that a Cuban flag hung both inside the Morales home and outside of it. After pointing it out the mistake, developer Insomniac Games has revealed a fix is on the way, as reported by PushSquare. 
In response to a tweet by Dantes61680 pointing out the incorrect flag, Insomniac&#x27;s director of community and marketing James Stevenson wrote, &quot;Fix is coming for that.&quot; As for when, that remains unclear – a post-launch patch for Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2 has not yet been released but presumably, when the …</span>
