Sega announced earlier this year Sonic X Shadow Generations would be coming to the Switch and multiple other platforms this Autumn, so when exactly can we expect it?
Although Sega hasn&#x27;t locked in an official date yet, according to &#x27;billbil-kun&#x27; of Dealabs, this remaster featuring a brand new campaign is currently targeting an October release, with the price for the physical edition expected to be $49 USD across all platforms (including the Switch).

                              <span>The Dissent storyline is one of the last main campaign quests in Destiny 2: The Final Shape. It&#x27;s a fairly challenging mission filled with a ton of formidable enemies and maze-like layouts. To help guide you through it, here&#x27;s how to complete Dissent in Destiny 2: The Final Shape.


Destiny 2: The Final Shape Dissent mission guide


For a complete overview of the Dissent quest, we&#x27;ll break down each step in Destiny 2: The Final Shape.


Step 1: Forge a path and defeat the Tempest&#x27;s Beloved 


The first part of the Dissent quest takes you to the Transgression area. Follow the waypoints and eliminate the enemies along its pathway. You&#x27;ll then need to &#x27;Summon Targe&#x27; when approaching the Veiled Statue. Another Veiled Statue will be ahead, resulting in a fight against the Tempest&#x27;s Beloved.

But did you know that you can get both a good amount of free 4-stars and a free 5-star weapon of your choosing in the game? Here&#x27;s how to get all free 5 and 4-star weapons in Wuthering Waves.

Apart from your Rangers&#x27; Series Weapon Supply Chest weapon pick, the first free 4-star weapons you can get in Wuthering Waves are the craftable ones. The weapons available for crafting are the Sword#18, Broadblade#41, Gauntlets#21D, Rectifier#25, and the Pistols#26. You can craft them by interacting …</span>

And don&#x27;t worry: &quot;Melodies&quot; isn&#x27;t some meaningless alliteration. The new Enshrouded - Melodies of the Mire update lets you skip through a new biome as a musical bard, if you wish.


Obviously, you want to skip through the biome as a musical bard. Who wouldn&#x27;t? Thankfully, you won&#x27;t even have to do it alone. You can craft instruments, ranging from a lute to a flute, and even a harp. There are multiple instruments, allowing you and a few buddies to traipse through the world as your very own band of bards. Frankly, allowing players to stop and bust out a jingle is something every game should try to implement. You can&#x27;t let the pirates of Sea of Thieves have all th…</span>

                              <span>Hey, kids, remember Yooka-Laylee? I can ask that in earnest because Playtonic Games&#x27; 3D collect &#x27;em up platformer is seven years old now, practically a dinosaur in Internet Years. This particular reptile is coming back, bat in tow, with a remastered and enhanced version called Yooka-Replaylee. 


The updated version of Yooka-Laylee was revealed during the Guerilla Collective showcase along with a bunch of indie announcements and trailers. The Yooka-Replaylee footage shows some side-by-side looks at the new visual flourishes, which appear to be pretty substantial. 




Beyond the new look, the team improved some of the games challenges while adding new ones for players to discover. There&#x27;s also a new collectible currency thanks to Capital B&#x27;s minions dropping their coins all over the place. You can spend this hard-found loot at the sentient vending machine known as Vendi, who hooks Yooka and Laylee up with Tonics in exchange for completing objectives. Other enhancements include a new world map, which helps you track challenges and plan your next moves, and some new tonic flavors for further playstyle customization. 


Finally, Yooka-Replaylee sports updates to the controls and camera — making it easier to both position the camera and pull off move combos — as well as a new orchestral arrangement of Grant Kirkhope and David Wise&#x27;s original soundtrack. Right now it&#x27;s just listed for consoles and PC with no release date in place, but the Steam page is live with more screens, info, and a brief FAQ.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been nearly five years since the launch of Shenmue III. Even though the game&#x27;s release after nearly two decades was akin to a miracle, the story isn&#x27;t finished. Fans haven&#x27;t given up yet, as proven by a Shenmue 4 ad that decorated New York&#x27;s Times Square this week.


Die-hard fans from the site Shenmue Dojo were behind the short ad, which appeared in Times Square on June 4. The campaign consisted of a 15-second advertisement and getting fans on board with the hashtag #letsgetshenmue4 on X. 




Do you think Sega noticed? This is admittedly a incredible way to flag the publisher&#x27;s attention. Getting one 15-second ad at Times Square starts as low as $40, so it&#x27;s not like they had to break the bank. Still, it&#x27;s a bold strategy; let&#x27;s see if it pays off.

After completing The Final Shape campaign, your Ghost will give you the Destined Heroes mission. This will lead to getting the Wild Card mission from Cayde-6 which then opens up two more quests from Ghost, one of which is Lost in the Light.

                              <span>Hazelight Studios is a developer known for making games that require two players to work together to complete them. Recently, the studio shared a few details about how it created A Way Out on a budget, using the tools and people it had rather than blowing its budget. 


A Way Out is a visually stunning game with incredible scenes similar to those in Naughty Dog&#x27;s Uncharted franchise. Surprisingly, the game&#x27;s motion capture was done with whatever equipment the studio could find, and all the actors were members of staff who were also working on building the game. This was done because the studio didn&#x27;t have the budget for the top-spec motion capture equipment, but it shows just what you can achieve when you work within your means.

                              <span>Several EA FC 24 players claimed that matchmaking isn&#x27;t working properly in Ultimate Team Division Rivals, meaning players from the top divisions can match with players who just started the game mode. 


EA FC 24 content creator MattHDGamer asked other players if they were experiencing &quot;broken&quot; matchmaking. The streamer posted a screenshot from a Division Rivals match with a 22-0 scoreline, indicating that he must have played an opponent ranked several divisions lower. 




EA FC 24 News substantiated the claim by posting an image of an opponent using a squad of gold players, with the highest rating being an 89 overall player. Since this title has been out for around eight months, most high-level players in Ultimate Team have an Ultimate Team full of special cards, with some being 95 overall or higher. 


If you are skilled at EA FC 24, a full gold squad can take down a starting 11 full of special cards. However, for new users just starting in the game mode, getting thrown into the deep end against a Division 1 player could be a rude awakening. For reference, Division Rivals in Ultimate Team divides everyone into 11 different divisions. Earning a higher rank requires winning multiple games in a row, and the competition gets harder each step along the way. 


Usually, players face squads in the same division or relatively close to them. With matchmaking potentially broken, this could be an issue as matches could continue to result in unrealistic or unfair outcomes. This could also be a good teaching moment for the community as going up against higher-level opposition forces you to improve. Either way, EA has yet to release an official statement, meaning this could stick around for a while until it gets sorted out.

The expansion&#x27;s new location, The Pale Heart, isn&#x27;t the first place you&#x27;ll have encountered The Dread. Though only sparingly, this enemy race was present in the Lightfall expansion as Tormentors. In this new location, there are many more enemies in The Dread&#x27;s ranks for you to destroy. You&#x27;ll need to learn the mechanics of how they fight and develop strategies to beat them. Luckily, I&#x27;ve done a lot of the hard work for you and have listed every Dread foe and how to beat them below.

                              <span>Following the release of Destiny 2: The Final Shape, developer Bungie is moving the game to a new model that will ditch seasons in favor of Episodes. These are narrative arcs that last longer than seasons and should pack in a lot more story set after the expansion&#x27;s conclusion. 


Destiny 2 has had dozens of seasons, each one slowly moving the story forward between expansions. I&#x27;ve had my battles with this model because, at times, it felt to me like I couldn&#x27;t play anything else if I wanted to make the most of them. With The Final Shape being the last major expansion for the game, Bungie is moving away from seasons and offering players something new and different on a much less pressured time scale.

                              <span>If you&#x27;ve been trying to play Destiny 2&#x27;s latest The Final Shape DLC while the hype is still fresh, then you&#x27;ve undoubtedly come across a bevy of errors along the way. Cacao and Currant have been particularly common as of late, but Destiny 2&#x27;s Cat error is no pushover, either.


Notably, Destiny 2 error code Cat is a very specific kind of error that&#x27;s only ever going to pop up when your version of the game is out-of-date with the current server version. Or, at least, that&#x27;s how it should work, though it&#x27;s entirely possible that you may have come across Cat even when your game was fully up-to-date already! Here&#x27;s everything we know about this particular error code, from Bungie&#x27;s own sources.

The campaign of Destiny 2: The Final Shape is a wild ride that sees you battle through The Pale Heart and encounter all sorts of strange enemies and mysterious puzzles.

                              <span>Spiderbots are widely considered the most annoying ability to deal with in XDefiant. Fortunately, there is a simple trick to taking out the pesky robots. 


Every Faction in XDefiant has unique abilities that set them apart. The DedSec faction was designed to mess with the enemy team by disrupting and taking control of their devices. Hijack is a powerful ability as it allows players to gain the power to hack enemy abilities and gain control of them. However, most players use Spiderbot as it&#x27;s a robot that chases after the nearest enemy, latches onto their face, and stuns them. 


Most XDefiant players can at least recall one time when they fell victim to this ability, and there aren&#x27;t many ways to counter it. However, there are a few options available so not all hope is lost. 


How to counter DedSec Faction Spiderbots in XDefiant




XDefiant Updates posted a clip on Twitter of a player getting attacked by a Spiderbot and voiced their displeasure with the ability. A player claimed that they were able to punch a Spiderbot in mid-air to destroy it one time, but it didn&#x27;t work again. 


XDefiant executive producer Mark Rubin confirmed that this is a bug and players should be able to punch Spiderbots. In the meantime, the only two ways to counter the ability are to either shoot them, which is extremely difficult, or to aim down when it&#x27;s on your face and shoot. Both options aren&#x27;t the best in terms of staying focused on your surroundings, but for now it&#x27;s the only chance we have at countering the ability.

                              <span>Honkai: Star Rail&#x27;s certified intergalactic cowboy, Boothill, has finally made his debut, and he comes with a unique kit strikingly different from standard DPS. 


If you&#x27;re looking to build up the Galaxy Ranger, here&#x27;s everything you need to know about Boothill, including some of the best Relic sets and team compositions for Honkai : Star Rail&#x27;s new DPS. 


Strongest Boothill Build in Honkai: Star Rail


Boothill is a Physical Hunt character whose main role is to dish out as much damage as he possibly can. He is the very definition of a &#x27;Hypercarry&#x27; and investment into him turns him into one of the strongest single-target DPS characters in the game. However, what makes him stand out from his carry brethren is his focus on Break Damage, to dish out the pain.

                              <span>Daniel Brühl, known for portraying Baron Zemo in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, says he is “very confident” that he will reprise his role once again. The actor’s last appearance in the MCU was in The Falcon and the Winter Soldier.


Brühl told Screen Rant in a recent interview that he is a “very patient man” and he is willing to wait until Marvel finds a way to bring him back on screen. “I just wrapped on a show that&#x27;s called The Franchise, where it&#x27;s actually a satire about the superhero universe, so it was fun to switch sides, so to say. But knowing Marvel, they have a lot of sense of humour, so they will probably find it as funny as I did. And who knows, I mean, I&#x27;m still not dead, I&#x27;m very confident that I&#x27;ll be back,” Brühl said.




Zemo was the main antagonist in Captain America: Civil War, and can be fairly attributed for breaking up the Avengers, particularly denting the relationship between Tony Stark (Iron Man) and Steve Rogers (Captain America). The effects of Civil War were felt in Avengers: Infinity War when Thanos attacked Earth where some Avengers had not seen each other for years.


Once a villain, Zemo soon turned into an ally for Falcon and Winter Soldier in the show and is still alive in the MCU. It is entirely possible for Zemo to return, and it is likely that we may see him in the Thunderbolts* movie coming in 2025. It has been rather surprising that Daniel Brühl has not been officially cast for the movie, considering the fact that it is actually Baron Zemo who leads the team of misfits in the comics.


It’s tough to guess if Zemo will appear in Thunderbolts* or not, but the actor is certainly interested and even if Zemo might not have a major role, a cameo is still on the cards. Thunderbolts* will be released on May 2, 2025.

                              <span>I was watching the Guerilla Collective Stream today when W.I.L.D. Tactics’ trailer hit the air. It seemed familiar. I was certain I hadn&#x27;t seen it before and didn’t recognize the art style, but there was something familiar. Then the Wild Gentlemen logo flashed on screen, and I knew. This is a Chicken Police spin-off.




Chicken Police is something that I always hover around. I named the next mainline game in the series, Chicken Police: Into the Hive my most anticipated game of 2024. What draws me to these games is the obvious passion behind their world-building. It doesn’t necessarily matter what form the games take, but that storytelling is just delectable. I’d make a finger-lickin’ reference there, but I’ve done that enough in other articles.


While the trailer for W.I.L.D. Tactics is entirely a flashy animated teaser with no gameplay, screenshots and information have arrived elsewhere. It’s a turn-based strategy game made in the vein of XCOM but with the series’ noir stylings and anthropomorphic characters. It promises 15 story-focused missions that range from stealth to all-out assault, and 12 characters to carry them out.


While press material pushes the “story-focused” angle, there is squad and base management, upgrades, and a social system between the characters to keep things dynamic. 


They had me at “World of Wilderness.”


W.I.L.D. Tactics currently doesn’t have a release window, but will be coming to PC. Other platforms will be announced later.

                              <span>After a successful open beta earlier this year, TinyBuild has announced that a second open beta for Duckside is now live. More than 150,000 players jumped into the first beta and the developer is expecting many more to take up the call to arms now.


Duckside is a PvP, PvE base building and crafting title set in a persistent open world where players can form groups, create a base of operations, and then head out on missions to raid others, attack marked locations on the map, and cause all kinds of Mallard mayhem. The game is a lot like Rust, with regular server wipes to keep things interesting and help avoid any single group becoming overpowered or allowing players to collect and hoard everything on the map.

                              <span>Niantic has hosted many rewarding events over the years, including its Pokémon Go Twitch Drops program. However, these celebrations are often time-restricted, so it&#x27;s possible to miss out on the event. Here&#x27;s how to get Pokémon Go Twitch Drops and their rewards.


How to get Pokémon Go Twitch Drops


To claim Twitch Drops for Pokémon Go, connect your Twitch to your Trainer Club account. You can easily do this on the Pokémon Rewards page, which only takes a few minutes to set up.


After you&#x27;ve connected the two accounts, you&#x27;ll need to tune in to a special event. The Pokémon Go Twitter/X page typically notifies users when an event is active. At the time of writing, a Twitch Drops event will kick off for the 2024 Pokémon North America International Championship.

During this time, trainers can watch the Pokémon Go broadcast from June 7 to June 9. Anyone who watches 30 minutes of the stream will be rewarded with an exclusive Time Research. This will allow you to catch MEWeedle&#x27;s Altaria, the Europe International Championship winner.


For specific times, you can expect the following events for the Pokémon Go stream (all times are set to PT):



Bracket Play: June 7 from 6 a.m. to 4 p.m.


Bracket Play until Top 3: June 8 from 6 a.m. to 4 p.m.


Finals: June 9 at 6 a.m.



Besides the Altaria, players can earn more rewards from this broadcast, including TMs and Stardust. However, it may require additional stream time beyond the 30-minute range.


Trainers can claim the Twitch Drops via the Rewards page. You should see a &#x27;View Inventory&#x27; section showcasing your current Drop Inventory. Other streams can also be accessed here, from Pokémon TCG to Pokémon Unite.

                              <span>Clorinde is a 5-star Electro DPS in Genshin Impact who synergizes well with Dendro teammates. Here are the best teams for Clorinde focusing on two of her best reactions: Aggravate and Hyperbloom.


Teams for Quicken Clorinde


Aggravate is the easiest reaction for Clorinde to trigger consistently. All you need is an off-field Dendro teammate to apply the occasional hit of Dendro. Clorinde’s best Dendro teammates are Nahida, Dendro Traveler, Baizhu, and Yaoyao. Kirara and Collei can also work, but they’re harder to recommend. Pick one or two of these Dendro teammates to trigger Quicken, which will enable Clorinde to trigger Aggravate.


Once you have your Dendro teammate(s) picked out, you can fill in with some flex units of your choice. I recommend an Anemo unit like Sucrose or Kazuha to a…</span>

                              <span>Treyarch started sprinkling in breadcrumbs of clues ahead of the upcoming Black Ops 6 direct, including easter eggs in Warzone that players have been tasked with solving. 


Since its inception, solving mysteries has been a staple of the Call of Duty franchise. Whether in campaign missions, zombies, multiplayer, or Warzone, the development teams enjoy including Easter eggs and leaving the rest to players. In Season 4, Raven Software spread bunkers around Urzikstan. Players need an access card to access each bunker, but some bunkers are unaccessible with an access card and require extra problem-solving skills.  


Bunker 7, for example, has been impenetrable for the first week of Season 4, but Warzone&#x27;s best sleuths finally cracked the case. 


How to access bunker 7 in Warzone 


DETONATED posted on Twitter that to access bunker 7 on Urzikstan, players have to type in 72559 as the passcode. Once inside, interacting with the computer will unlock the Redacted Calling Card, which is the first of three Black Ops 6-related challenges. 




Players don&#x27;t have to wait much longer before seeing the first gameplay for Black Ops 6. Activision confirmed that on June 9, an in-depth look at gameplay and product announcements for the upcoming title will be held.

                              <span>The Tesla Tower is one of the many stationary turret Stratagems in Helldivers 2 that you can unlock after some time. It looks pretty good from the demo video and has pretty good stats, so if you want to know more before taking it on a mission, here’s everything you need to know.


How to get the Tesla Tower in Helldivers 2


To get the Tesla Tower in Helldivers 2, you will need to be level 15 and spend 8,000 Req Slips. It’s part of the Bridge section in the Stratagem Management menu.


Once purchased, you can then equip it before shipping out on your mission.


How to use the Tesla Tower in Helldivers 2


To use the Tesla Tower, you will call it down like any other turret. Once it lands, you can’t move it. 


Unlike other turrets where you can see where it’ll attack next, the Tesla Tower attacks enemies within its shock radius. You can see roughly how far it’ll attack, so you ideally want to stay away before you end up dead. You can go prone to avoid getting hurt or killed, but it’s best to just be away from the Tower’s radius entirely.

Is the Tesla Tower worth using?


The Tesla Tower is only worth using at lower difficulties fighting Terminids in Helldivers 2. It’s amazing when it can take down small and medium enemies, but once you start facing heavier targets like Bile Spewers, Chargers, and Bile Titans, it’s nearly worthless.


Most heavier enemies can walk through the Tower’s radius and crush it before it can deal significant damage.


Also, the Tesla Tower is nearly useless when fighting Automatons. A majority of the attacks this faction has are all ranged, so they can easily take this down from afar. 


So, if you want to farm low-level defense missions for quick Medals and Req slips, the Tesla Tower will be good there. Otherwise, at higher levels, like 5-Hard and higher, it’s going to be destroyed in seconds.

                              <span>EA Sports FC 24 is set to introduce the UEFA Euro 2024 update today, June 6, 2024. The free update will be themed around the international tournament, featuring the top footballing nations across Europe.


As part of this free update, Ultimate Team mode players are set to receive a free player pick. The options include Netherlands’ Virgil van Dijk, Italy’s Federico Chiesa, Germany’s Florian Wirtz, France’s Ousmane Dembele, England’s Jack Grealish, and Spain’s Alvaro Morata. The player pick will only be available for Ultimate Team players who have played the mode between December 18, 2023, and January 16, 2024.




Details on what the update offers have now been revealed and a Euro 2024 tournament has been added, and here is how to play Euro 2024 in FC 24. The free update arrives ahead of the official Euro 2024 tournament in Germany which commences on June 14, 2024.


The official announcement post features a picture of the same players available as a free item, donning the kits of their respective international teams. This at least confirms these kits will be available across the Euro 2024 update for players, and more kits from the participating nations at the tournament in Germany are expected to be available as well.


EA’s FIFA 23 title featured a World Cup 2022 update which brought content for Ultimate Team as well as offline game modes, and a World Cup tournament mode was introduced. The update did arrive with a fresh set of animations before kick-off, showing off fans entering the stadium to cheer for their nation, but the overall update did not receive a favourable response from the game’s community.

                              <span>HBO’s The Last Of Us Season 2 episode count has been revealed by co-showrunners Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann. The duo told Deadline in a recent review that The Last Of Us Season 2 will have seven episodes. This may come across as slightly upsetting news, given that Season 1 consisted of nine episodes.


Season 2 will be seven episodes


However, the co-showrunners have said that one of the episodes in the upcoming season will be “quite big” in terms of duration, which does offer some form of relief for fans. Craig Mazin explained the logic behind the decision, stating that the story material from The Last of Us Part II videogame is more than what was presented to the team for the first game. So, the team had to “figure out how to tell that story across seasons”, which points towards a potential third season to complete the story of the second game.


“When you do that, you look for natural breakpoints, and as we laid it out, this season, the national breakpoint felt like it came after seven episodes,” added Mazin. The co-creator later on said something during the interview, that almost does confirm that a third season will arrive. “One thing is absolutely for sure, I don’t see how we could tell the story that remains after Season 2 is complete in one more season,” he said.


From the looks of it, Season 2 will have fewer episodes but there will be another season to look forward to. While it is up for debate where exactly Season 2 will leave the story, there is one particular event from the game that seems to be the obvious choice, but let’s keep conversations about Season 2 spoiler-free for now.

                              <span>The Rakta Dark Dagger is an interesting weapon in Warframe because it’s one of the game&#x27;s weaker weapon types, yet provides many favorable qualities. It also is kind of hard to get if you’re a newer player, so in any case, here’s everything you need to know about the weapon.


How to get the Rakta Dark Dagger


To get the Rakta Dark Dagger, you have to purchase it from the Red Veil Syndicate for 125,000 standing. To even get that much to hold at once, you also need to be max rank with them or Exalted.


If you aren’t allied with them when you chose your Syndicate, you have to resort to trading with another player who is. In that case, you will more than likely have to pay another player who is in the Red Veil with Platinum.


The Rakta Dark Dagger will usually cost between 25 to 40 Platinu…</span>

                              <span>The launch of Destiny 2: The Final Shape has been packed with error codes and server queues, though some of us are able to get in and play the campaign. Outside of the new playable content, Bungie also seems to have created an issue with the Painfully Slow Clap emote, but it won&#x27;t explain exactly what the problem is. 


The same week that The Final Shape was released, Bungie added the Painfully Slow Clap emote to the Eververse Store for 200 Silver. This is about $2/£2, but the problem is, the emote is exactly the same as another emote that was in the original Destiny. While Bungie is usually very specific about the issues impacting Destiny 2, it&#x27;s been strangely vague on this one, leading some fans to believe a mistake was made.

One week of action gave the development team a good idea of what needed to be adjusted, and Player First Games responded with the first batch of buffs and nerfs. 


Before jumping into the  MultiVersus1.01 update patch notes, Player First Games confirmed that performance improvements, end game statistics, and the option to turn off team colors won&#x27;t be a part of this update, but will be added at a later date. In addition, the development team assured players that the option to purchase extra lives was a bug and has since been removed from the title. And despite a series of changes in this update, Iron Giant will still be unavailable while a few more issues get ironed out.

While there are single player experiences on Roblox, there are several reasons you might just want to appear offline so no one bothers you. For example, you might not want to interact with anyone and simply enjoy a game by yourself while you grind Voltstanding in Type Soul or something similar. For parents, being able to make a profile appear offline will help ensure strangers don&#x27;t try to chat with their children.

                              <span>Flair passes are one of the rarest forms of ball movement used by EA FC 24 players, largely due to their complex nature.


There are several ways of moving the ball between your players in the game, and the introduction of playstyles has created new methods as well. Some of them are pretty basic, while others are much more complex. Nevertheless, it&#x27;s essential to stay in touch with all the methods that will allow you to crack open the opposition defense with better efficiency.


What are Flair passes in EA FC 24?


The Flair pass certainly falls under the advanced types, where the ball carrier passes the ball in a flashy manner. The ball carrier usually uses a skill move to pass the ball, which is very different from simple passes. Naturally, the controls are also different, and there&#x27;s an…</span>

The question is not unjust, as EA Sports has introduced a dedicated Euro 2024 mode with plenty of content.

                              <span>Dragon Age: Dreadwolf is no more. No, EA haven&#x27;t once again taken Dragon Age 4 back to the drawing board; instead, they&#x27;ve just changed its name. The next entry in their trad-fantasy RPG series is now called Dragon Age: The Veilguard, and we&#x27;ll get a &quot;first look at gameplay&quot; next week.

                              <span>It&#x27;s a new month, which means Microsoft have detailed a new batch of games arriving on Game Pass. Not all of the games themselves are new, mind you: they include Octopath Traveler, the HD-2D RPG released in 2018, and its sequel.

                              <span>I’ve been scouring Steam Next Fest demos specifically for something laid back, and Spilled! – despite sounding like the title of a musical about upturned milk – has delivered nicely. It’s a light and breezy ocean cleanup game that has you sailing a cute lil’ boat around polluted seas, cleansing oil patches and scooping up plastic bottles. Even if it doesn’t have the every-last-speck detailing of PowerWash Simulator or Viscera Cleanup Detail, it satisfies in very similar ways, and I would very much like to get back out on the water whenever the full game is complete.

I&#x27;d spend a good ten minutes or so darting my eyes between blobs or skittish enemy models then whipping my wrist to blast them with an AK.
Glyphica reminds me of those heady days. It&#x27;s a roguelite horde survival game where you&#x27;ve got to protect your central pewpew from an onslaught of words. I think it&#x27;s the perfect warm up for someone who&#x27;s about to do a big essay or maybe defend Dark Souls 2 in an errant comments section. It&#x27;s fun!

                              <span>Maybe you can relate, but I tend to find I crave twee and colorful things proportionally inverse to my melancholy. If I’m having a good week, give me Fear and Hunger and horrible films like Speak No Evil. If, like this week for some reason, I feel like bursting into tears at inopportune moments, I need silly little guys doing whimsical activities. Enter Dungeon Clawler. It’s a vaguely Slay The Spire-ish roguelite where you grab weapons from a claw machine while you fight. It&#x27;s got lazy Steam Deck depression nap written all over it. The main theme reminds me of Zombies Ate My Neighbors, and the character I picked is named Sir Bunalot.

No, it doesn&#x27;t boast a title in all-caps, but Selaco&#x27;s early access release more than deserves it&#x27;s spot as a must-play for those who desire some sophistication with their ultra-violence.

                              <span>Taipei’s annual Computex event is always a big, circled, triple-underlined mark in the PC gaming hardware calendar. Whereas CES splits its focus across tech, cars, and the occasional overdesigned white good, Computex is all computing, all the time, making it a prime source of reveals and showcases for the hardware bits that make games happen.
Sadly, Computex 2024 is unlikely to go down as a classic, largely because this year’s show has been mesmerised by AI and the most tedious applications thereof: search, but different somehow! Run art-stealing generation tools faster! Oh, Computex, what have they done to you, and why do you have seven fingers on one hand?
Granted, AI is a broad field, and not everything about it is necessarily gross or creatively bankrupting. But it also doesn’t deserve to overshadow all the other useful, unexpected, and curiosity-piquing gaming tech that Computex has to offer, from new Steam Deck alternatives to resurrected CPU lineups and promising graphics card updates. Here are those highlights of the show so far...

What is Fucksweeper? Discerning videogame cognoscente that you are, I feel like you should be able to read the title and form some broad conclusions. But for those who never owned a Windows PC in the 90s, Fucksweeper is a free, titillating, revolting, beautiful, apocalyptic new version of classic avoid-the-bombs grid puzzler Minesweeper that incorporates elements of dating sims and a vast quantity of generative AI filth. Maybe turn down the volume before watching this video.

                              <span>After the climatic end to a decade-long saga in Endwalker, anticipation is high for Final Fantasy XIV’s next expansion, Dawntrail. I got to try out the game and talk to Director Naoki Yoshida (aka Yoshi-P) about new Jobs and the difficulty of incorporating fan feedback (not to mention the reasons the Warrior of Light has such great skin - you&#x27;ll see). But how can the Square Enix possibly hope to follow the highs of Endwalker, including space travel and a fight against the physical embodiment of sorrow? By taking us on holiday, of course.

                              <span>Hollywood Animal is a management sim about turning a bankrupt movie studio into a money printing machine, set in Hollywood’s golden age. While a Frostpunk 2 or Manor Lords might have you grapple with the elements, here it’s all about balancing a fickle audience and Tinseltown’s seedy underbelly. Maybe making some worthwhile art, too? Sorry, did I say ‘worthwhile art’? I meant to say “lots of money.” Let’s get clicking!
First up, I need to name my studio (I settle on Horace&#x27;s Revenge) as well as my crack new team of business bastards. There’s my chief legal officer, Jebediah End. My CCO, Anne Egg, and CFO, Rummy McLastdrink. He doesn’t have a sauce problem, because obviously I wouldn’t put him in charge of money if he did. In the wreckage of the studio, we find an unedited film reel hidden in the waffles n’ cocaine cupboard. It’s a noir thriller named ‘Messenger Of Death’. Whatever influential critic is currently directing this era’s discourse has chosen to categorise each film as genre percentages (‘60% detective/40% thriller’), and setting (‘modern American city’.) Let’s just hope those pigs in the stands recognise a solid gold picture when they see one!

                              <span>With the AMD EPYC 4004 series that was announced in May and we have delivered benchmarks of the entire EPYC 4004 stack from the 4-core SKU up through the 16-core model with 3D V-Cache, there are many advantages over Intel&#x27;s Xeon E-2400 series competition. In addition to going up to 16 cores versus 8 with the Xeon E-2400 series, the more competitive pricing, the 3D V-Cache SKUs, and 28 PCIe lanes rather than 20, the AMD EPYC 4004 models also support DDR5-5200 memory where as the Intel Raptor Lake E-2400 models are bound to DDR5-4800. In this follow-up testing is a look at the AMD EPYC 4004 performance both at DDR5-4800 and DDR5-5200 speeds for showing the performance difference.</span>

Some models are also already available for pre-order ahead of launch day. This is quite nice compared to in the past there was often at times quite a delay between the initial AMD Ryzen mobile announcements and being able to (pre)order any hardware. And thus I&#x27;ve already been looking around to coordinate near launch day Linux testing of the new AMD Zen 5 powered Ryzen AI 300 series hardware...</span>

If you happen to recall the bizarre 1999 point-and-click title Garage: Bad Dream Adventure, then you&#x27;re in for a treat. If you don&#x27;t, then... well... you&#x27;re still in for a treat because it looks wild.
It launches on the Switch eShop today for £16.99 / $24.99, so by the time you&#x27;re reading this, you might be able to purchase and download it. For the uninitiated, Garage originated in Japan from developer Kinotrope and was released for Windows and Mac. It&#x27;s since been ported to Android and iOS, but we&#x27;re honestly thrilled to see it on Switch.

Since the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One launched in 2013, gamers have increasingly been given the option to tweak their experiences based on whether they prefer higher image quality or smoother performance.
Not all developers offer this, but now that we&#x27;re more than three-and-a-half years into the lifespan of the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, player expectations have adjusted accordingly to the point where it almost feels mandatory to include &#x27;Quality&#x27; and &#x27;Performance&#x27; options in the biggest games on those platforms. It&#x27;s why you see almost constant requests for a re-release of Bloodborne, a game that is infamously capped at 30fps on PS4, with Rockstar&#x27;s Red Dead Redemption 2 being a close second.

Ahead of Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance&#x27;s launch on 14th June 2024, Atlus has revealed the epic launch trailer, likely giving fans one last look at the game before release.
It&#x27;s arguably a bit spoiler-heavy for some, so you&#x27;ll have to judge whether you want to check it out. Regardless, if you weren&#x27;t already hyped for the upcoming release, the launch trailer will almost certainly push you over the edge.

We&#x27;re mere weeks away from the opening showcase at this point, so naturally, information is being pumped out at a rather alarming rate to make sure that everyone and their gran are aware of Keighley&#x27;s plans.

                              <span>Developer Sobaka Studio has revealed Kiborg: Arena, a roguelike that looks like a cyberpunk Sifu. Revealed during today&#x27;s Guerrilla Collective showcase, Arena is a prequel to Kiborg and it&#x27;s coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (via Steam) sometime this summer. 
In the full game – Kiborg – players must fend of waves of foes as Morgan Lee, the leader of a ragtag group of resistance fighters on the prison planet of Sigma. &quot;Strike with punishing hand-to-hand combat skills, blast mechanized soldiers with firearms, and deploy cybernetic-enhanced abilities to devastate bloodthirsty baddies. Learn to dodge, block, and parry adversaries to set them up for the killing blow.&quot; It sounds and, given how it appears in the trailer below, looks a lot like Sifu, which is a great combat-centric brawler from 2022. 
Check out the Kiborg action in the trailer below:


In Arena, players find &quot;Morgan Lee, who sends the clones that fight on his behalf out on missions, fighting in Sigma&#x27;s Colisseum. Here, Morgan&#x27;s clones will square off in bloody battles against other denizens of the prison planet for the cash to help keep his resistance going.&quot; Arena also features an Endless Mode, which Sobaka says spawns an infinite amount of increasingly difficult enemies to overcome.
In the full game, players will gather resources to unlock permanent upgrades, form alliances, and research forbidden technologies to gain the upper hand. 
Here are some Kiborg screenshots: 

Arena launches this summer on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. The full Kiborg game does not yet have a release date.

                              <span>Developer Playtonic has revealed Yooka-Replaylee, a remaster of its 2017 platformer Yooka-Laylee. It revealed this during today&#x27;s Guerrilla Collective 2024 Showcase with a new trailer that highlighted the game&#x27;s new visuals, improved camera and gameplay controls, remixed challenges, and more. 
&quot;Embark on an epic open-world 3D platforming collectathon adventure with Yooka and Laylee,&quot; the game&#x27;s description reads. &quot;The search for Pagies starts anew in Yooka-Replaylee, the enhanced definitive version of the beloved indie darling with all new challenges, secrets, mechanics, and accessibility options.&quot; 
Check it out for yourself in the Yooka-Replaylee reveal trailer below: 


Yooka-Laylee launched in 2017 on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, Wii U, and PC, and we had a great time with it – you can read why in Game Informer&#x27;s Yooka-Laylee review. Though the game is a 3D collect-a-thon, it got a sequel in 2019 called Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair that played more like Donkey Kong Country. 
Yooka-Replaylee is coming to PC and unspecified consoles. It has no release window.

                              <span>Dragon Age: Dreadwolf, the next game in the series, has a new name – Dragon Age: The Veilguard. BioWare first teased the game back in 2018, and we later learned it was called Dragon Age: Dreadwolf in 2022. Now, BioWare has changed the name to Dragon Age: The Veilguard, with a promise of a first look at its gameplay next week on Tuesday, June 11. 
As for why, the team explains it&#x27;s about the characters that will make up the companions you meet in the game in a new blog post. 


&quot;At BioWare, we create worlds of adventure, conflict and companionship, where you&#x27;re at the center of it all. As fans of our franchise know, every Dragon Age game has delivered a new standalone story.

                              <span>We got our first look at Firewalk Studios&#x27; upcoming 5v5 first-person shooter Concord last week during a PlayStation State of Play, which is where we also learned it will launch simultaneously on PlayStation 5 and PC on August 23 after a beta this July. Now, thanks to a new PlayStation Blog post detailing the game&#x27;s preorder contents, we know it will cost $39.99. 
That same blog post says Concord will launch with 16 playable characters known as Freerunners, 12 unique maps set on various in-universe worlds, and six distinct team-based modes. And that content will &quot;expand shortly after launch with regular, post-launch updates&quot; for all players at no additional cost. 
Here&#x27;s a look at the Concord box art: 
Alongside the standard $39.99 edition of the game, PlayStation and Firewalk are releasing a Digital Deluxe Edition for $59.99 that includes additional cosmetics to customize your Freegunners and 72-hours early access to the game&#x27;s August launch. Preordering the game, regardless of edition, also gets you (and up to four friends) beta access and the Monarch cosmetics pack. 
Here&#x27;s a look at the Concord Digital Deluxe Edition: 
&quot;Seeing Vale and other Freegunners in action in gameplay footage is one thing, but there&#x27;s no substitute for experiencing the game for yourself,&quot; the blog post reads. &quot;That&#x27;s why we&#x27;re hosting a pre-launch beta, simultaneously on PS5 and PC with cross-play support. Those that pre-order will have an opportunity to be among the first to play Concord.&quot; 
That beta is set to happen this July before Concord launches on PS5 and PC on August 23.

                              <span>The Angry Birds Movie 3 is officially in production. The threequel to the hit animated films is being produced by Rovio Entertainment, creators of the Angry Birds franchise, in collaboration with Sega and Prime Focus Studios.
Red and Chuck are back, with Jason Sudeikis and Josh Gad reprising their roles, respectively. It will be directed by John Rice (The Angry Birds Movie 2, Beavis and Butt-Head Do the Universe) with a screenplay written by Thurop Van Orman (The Angry Birds Movie 2, Adventure Time, The Misadventures of Flapjack). DNEG Animation will bring the film to life, as opposed to being handled by Rovio and Sony as with the last two films. Prime Focus Studios, which co-produced The Garfield Movie, is set to produce. 
A press release provides no details on the plot nor a release window. If you’re wondering why Sega is now involved, the company purchased Rovio last year. Given that the two previous films were box office successes and have grossed a combined $500 million worldwide, it’s a little surprising we haven’t gotten a third film already. 
While we wait for more information on the film, you can read our review of The Angry Birds Movie 2 here. You can also read the latest news on other upcoming video game films, such as Sonic the Hedgehog 3, Nintendo&#x27;s live-action The Legend of Zelda movie, Mortal Kombat 2, Minecraft, and Borderlands.</span>

Bloomberg reports that following the release of DC&#x27;s Suicide Squad in 2016, which made $750 million at the box office on a budget of $175 million, Warner Bros. wanted to build on that IP&#x27;s success.

                              <span>Last year&#x27;s Octopath Traveler II is now available on Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One, Square Enix has announced. Plus, Square Enix has released the first Octopath Traveler on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4, meaning both mainline Octopath Traveler games are now playable on all console platforms. 
If you&#x27;re on Xbox, Octopath Traveler II is also available on Xbox and PC Game Pass alongside the first game. If you&#x27;ve been waiting to jump into this series – whether on Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, or PC – now is the best time. And both games are great; read why in Game Informer&#x27;s Octopath Traveler review and Game Informer&#x27;s Octopath Traveler II review. 


To celebrate the series being available on all current platforms and PC (via Steam and Windows), developer Team Asano has released a free update to Octopath Traveler II that includes an &quot;Extra Battle&quot; mode that becomes available after defeating the game&#x27;s final boss. In this mode, players can test their skills against newly added extra-tough opponents – including the main characters from the first game. This mode has been available on Xbox consoles since launch but is now available on PlayStation, Switch, and PC. 
&quot;Since its launch in 2018 with Octopath Traveler, the Octopath Traveler series has sold over four million copies worldwide, popularizing the unique HD-2D art style: a striking blend of 2D character designs in beautiful 3D worlds,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;Both games are a standalone experience set in different worlds with eight distinct protagonists, each with their own stories to explore and Path Actions to use. Players will embark on a grand adventure and steer their own journey, depending on whom they choose to play as.&quot;

                              <span>Are you familiar with terms like 2-minute meta, homogenization, or even transpose lines? If you are, then this article might be up your alley. New expansions are always a fun time, especially for high-end raiders who will be getting shiny new buttons to press, and with that comes new rotations. After approximately 8,000 hours of playing Final Fantasy XIV and clearing The Omega Protocol on release, I think I&#x27;m able to provide some insight about the new weaponskills, spells, and abilities (and their implications for rotations, openers, and general play) I saw at a recent preview event for its upcoming Dawntrail expansion. I am not an expert at every job, and I could not test each job to its limit, so feel free to point out mistakes on my part.

Render compositor je přepsán, jeho běh je nyní až několikanásobně rychlejší. Rychleji probíhají i undo operace.</span>

                              <span>A new viral video shows that many of Fortnite’s premium cars—which can only be unlocked by purchasing them with V-Bucks—are safer to drive around in compared to the free models in the game. This is proving to be a problem in Fortnite’s newest car-focused season, and it seemingly goes against Epic’s policy of cosmetics…

                              <span>The Last of Us Season 2 is on the way but it won’t be last for the series, nor will it cover the entirety of the sequel it&#x27;s adapting. A new interview with Deadline reveals the season’s 7-episode count, the likelihood of a third and even fourth season, and how the showrunners plan on telling its story.
The Last of Us Part II is a long game. So much so that showrunners and directors Craig Mazin and Naughty Dog president Neil Druckmann realized it would need to tell its story across more than one season. 
“The story material that we got from Part II of the game is way more than the story material that was in the first game, so part of what we had to do from the start was figure out how to tell that story across seasons,” Mazin said. “When you do that, you look for natural breakpoints, and as we laid it out, this season, the natural breakpoint felt like it came after seven episodes.”
Even though Season 2 will be shorter than Season 1, one of its episodes is said to be &quot;quite big&quot; in length. The showrunners also tease that a potential Season 3 will be much larger in scope. Despite this, Mazin doesn’t believe they can tell the whole story in two seasons because they want to take their time. “And indeed, the story may require Season 4,” he says.
HBO has not yet renewed The Last of Us for a third or fourth season, but Mazin believes it will happen, “as long as people keep watching.” 
For those worried that Season 2 would rush through Part II&#x27;s events, it seems you can relax. We&#x27;ll see where the story stops when The Last of Us Season 2 kicks off in 2025. To get a look at what the season has in store, you can take your first looks at Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey’s Joel and Ellie, and read about the castings for Dina, along with Manny, Mel, Owen, and Nora. Actor Jeffrey Wright was recently cast to reprise his role as Isaac.

Hauntii drew me in immediately thanks to its striking illustrated art direction and enchanting jazz noir soundtrack. A powerful opening sees the protagonist, an adorable ghost who recently died, attempting to ascend to a heavenly plane hand in hand with an angel-like guardian, only to be shackled and pulled back to the depths of Eternity. It’s an emotionally effective moment, and while the gameplay doesn’t always prove as captivating, it provides enough thrills to propel through an eye-popping…</span>

                              <span>Dead by Daylight developer Behaviour Interactive is laying off roughly 95 employees, the company has announced. The majority of those that will be affected – 70 of the 95 – work at the studio&#x27;s Montreal, Canada, office, as reported by GamesIndustry.biz. 
As for why, the company cites restructuring as it pursues a clarified vision around &quot;multiple strategic changes.&quot; Behaviour says these layoffs will not affect its service business or its development on Dead by Daylight. 
&quot;To pursue this clarified vision [lead in horror, lead in service, and explore the possibilities of location-based entertainment], Behaviour will implement multiple strategic changes to its corporate structure, improving the distinction between its product, production, business development, and marketing resources,&quot; a pres…</span>

Back in 2015, I sat down with fighting game community staple and former Capcom employee Seth Killian for a demo of the first game from Radiant Entertainment – his then-newly founded indie studio – Rising Thunder. The title, which featured robots fighting one another, aimed to give players a 2D fighter with simple controls and little barrier to entry. Rising Thunder showed a ton of promise, so much so that League of Legends developer Riot Games acquired Radiant Entertainment in 2016. This led to the cancellation of Rising Thunder, which was at that point in alpha, with many of the core tenets transferrin…</span>

                              <span>Online piracy is a major problem for the entertainment industries. In some instances, the problem is kept intact due to limited availability of content from legal sources. This week, &#x27;Adam Ruins Everything&#x27; star Adam Conover mentioned BitTorrent as a viewing option for fans who no longer have access to the series after HBO removed it a few months ago.

                              <span>In August 2023, video game giant Bungie filed yet another copyright infringement-based lawsuit targeting up to 50 individuals involved in developing and selling cheat tools for Destiny 2. What set this apart from similar lawsuits was a two-line warning in the complaint&#x27;s introduction. Elsewhere, the statement could&#x27;ve been dismissed as typical anti-piracy posturing, but here, Bungie&#x27;s relentless deanonymization of targets sends a powerful, credible message.

In the case of the D&amp;D CRPG, it’s a natural extension of playing dungeon master around the table, crafting the world and its characters as you see fit - typically by making everyone in Faerûn even hornier somehow.

                              <span>This week we finally got our raging bear gauntlets on Elden Ring Shadow Of The Erdtree, an even dingier and danker edition of 2022&#x27;s best and dankest open worlder, but perhaps you&#x27;d rather play a Soulslike with a Florentine flounce and the warmth of a Mediterranean sunset on its brow. A brighter, stagier variety of action-role-playing, which deepens the connection between Italian folklore and Soulsliking established by last year&#x27;s Lies Of P. Well then: cast aside those ursine mitts, slip on a pair of immaculate white theatre gloves and get your thumbs into Enotria: The Last Song, which has a demo on Steam.

                              <span>In Sorry We&#x27;re Closed, an axe-murdering entrepreneur called Jenny is described in newspaper clippings as both a serial embezzler and as the city&#x27;s &quot;wealthiest bachelorette&quot;. Aside from being a dry reflection of tabloid reporting on women who commit crimes (bad woman! sexy, bad woman!) this is also the kind of incidental character-building you can expect in this perky, retro-styled survival horror. It plays like Silent Hill charged with the hot pink body horror of Porpentine interactive fiction. And judging by my hour of unsettled strolling through the decrepit tube station of the game&#x27;s demo, it&#x27;s a powerful combo.

                              <span>Silkbulb Test is a game in which, going by its demo, you are strapped to a chair and made to answer questions projected onto a screen. You answer the questions by looking ponderously down and pressing the big red and yellow buttons on the desk in front of you. The questions begin with relatively innocuous, CAPTCHA-style inquiries, such as &quot;is this a door?&quot; accompanied by a picture of a face. A few minutes later, there&#x27;s stuff like &quot;Are you alone?&quot; and &quot;Is it safe to be alone?&quot; and &quot;You are alone&quot; and yep, time to smash Pause or better, throw the Steam Deck behind the sofa and go stare out the window for a while.

                              <span>Roguelike FPS Wild Bastards is the space western follow up to 2019’s Void Bastards. It takes some of that game’s ideas, mainly those related to shooty and looty, and reforms them into a largely different can o’ campfire beans. This time, it’s less focused on exploration, more on individual, tense shoot-outs. You collect a cast of weirdos, each with different guns and abilities, and form the deadliest dang posse this side of the last tactical overworld map you descision&#x27;d your way through. I like what I&#x27;ve played so far, although I think a lot is going to hinge on how much evolution the mid-game offers. As always, here’s a Steam demo, if you want to be all contrary and &#x27;form your own opinions&#x27;. Pah.

                              <span>Witchy roguelike Hades 2 got a fresh update yesterday that sees a bunch of weapons getting stompier, thumpier, and, yes, whompier. It&#x27;s like the hammer of Hephaestus himself was put to work on the entire armory. The Moonstone Axe&#x27;s heavier attacks now channel faster, for one thing, which could make the most sluggish of the weapons a little more viable. I haven&#x27;t had a go at the re-jigged bashing yet myself but I trust from these patch notes it will be subtly noticeable.

My pal Liam suggested we play this evening because Bungie&#x27;s servers would inevitably go up in flames the moment it launched. And what do you know? The right decision was made. Are we smug about it? Yes. Anyway, the good news is that Bungie have put out a few of those fires, though there are still a few bugs to fix.

                              <span>Call me a Paranoid Android or a Suspicious Stanley, but when I ask a videogame developer a question and the videogame developer pauses for exactly 31 seconds and then says “no”, I tend to assume the answer is, in fact, “yes”. Or at least “it’s complicated”, to channel a bit of antique Facebook coyness. The Alters is a complicated game. It is a moody sci-fi extravaganza in which your character, beleaguered offworld miner Jan Dolski, has to create new versions of himself by branching off his own past timeline using a &quot;quantum computer&quot;, splitting the chain of events at trigger points by, say, having his younger self stand up to his domineering father rather than leaving home.

                              <span>&quot;You never know when the Pokémon inspiration will strike!&quot;.
In recent years, we have seen an increasing number of roguelikes on Switch. In even more recent years, we have seen the same happen for &#x27;Pokémon-likes&#x27;. Naturally, each genre has its respective highs and lows, but rarely have we seen both of them joined by the same game. That is, until we saw Dicefolk.
Dicefolk is a tactical roguelike. It&#x27;s also a monster catcher. It&#x27;s also a dice game. It&#x27;s a confusing combination of genres that seem disparate on paper but click in practice. The game launched on Steam earlier this year and quickly started racking up positive reviews. So, when developers LEAP Game Studios (Tunche) and Tiny Ghoul announced that the monster-based mashup would be rolling the dice on Switch on 20th June, our interests were quickly piqued.

                              <span>All three of &#x27;em.
We are quickly approaching the release of Luigi&#x27;s Mansion 2 HD on 27th June and, with the marketing campaign in full swing, Nintendo Japan has uploaded a trio of terrifying trailers to show us a little more of the high-definition chills and thrills.
The three short trailers all start with the same spooked Luigi animation — don&#x27;t worry, you&#x27;re not watching the same one three times over — but there are snippets of new footage thrown in there too, showcasing some ghost encounters, spinning toilets and a pesky mammoth that you might remember from the OG 3DS version.

Sega has announced that the upcoming Switch exclusive Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble will receive a special guest appearance from Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, and Amy from the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise via the &#x27;Sega Pass&#x27; DLC.
The DLC is included with the Digital Deluxe Edition of the game at £59.99, or you can purchase it separately at £22.29 (which, if we&#x27;re being completely honest, feels a tad expensive for what you&#x27;re getting).

You would be forgiven for having a bad feeling about Star Wars: Hunters. This free-to-play, class-based, hero shooter was announced by FarmVille developer Zynga in 2021, but a duo of delays and its appearance in the already stacked genre of &#x27;Overwatch-likes&#x27; hardly served as a ringing endorsement for the latest event from a galaxy far, far away.
But after all of that waiting, the shooter has finally arrived (as a console exclusive to Switch, no less, at least for now) and it&#x27;s really rather good. Sure, those who have sampled Overwatch&#x27;s class-based stylings might find nothing particularly new here, but at launch Hunters is a fast and fun take on the PvP formula that might even serve as a fitting trial for any Padawans of the genre.

Atlus&#x27; Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance is just around the corner, offering the &#x27;definitive&#x27; experience of the fifth mainline game with two major campaigns and a host of quality-of-life upgrades.
Our own review isn&#x27;t too far off, but if you&#x27;re interested in what the folks over at Famitsu think of it, then you&#x27;re in luck. Thanks to Ryokutya2089 and Gematsu, we can confirm that the first official review for Vengeance has scored the game an impressive 36/40, split 9/9/9/9 across four reviewers as usual.

Fans of the quirky FPS Void Bastards will want to pay attention, because a direct sequel titled Wild Bastards is heading to the Nintendo Switch on 12th September 2024.
Boasting 13 unique playable characters, you&#x27;ll need to manage the relationships between each one, guide their growth, and make sure they don&#x27;t die a horrible death - obviously. Once you&#x27;ve successfully navigated your way through the main campaign, you&#x27;ll unlock a Challenge Mode that introduces modifiers and an ever-increasing difficulty level to really test your skills.

                              <span>Intel odhalil některé další technické detaily o svém připravovaném procesoru Lunar Lake. Půjde o novou generací mobilních procesorů Core Ultra, která navazuje na loňský Meteor Lake. Bude mít dva typy jader: efektivní E-jádra a výkonná P-jádra. Intel také prozradil, že půjde o kombinaci 4E+4P s vypnutým hyper-threadingem. Přidělování jednotlivých úloh závisí na operačním systému, jehož plánovač musí v reálném čase provádět úpravy nastavení vyvažující efektivitu s výpočetním výkonem v závislosti na intenzitě pracovní zátěže.</span>

                              <span>I was a diehard WipeOut player as a kid. Seriously, me and the boys used to roam the streets of Bradford looking for F-Zero players to bully, at least till the RollCagers rocked up and stole our lunch money. Mind you, I think I was probably less interested in WipeoUt&#x27;s racing than its trackside landscapes, which remain exquisite decades on - all those sweeping album-cover facades with their animate fixtures that thickened and solidified into full-blown peripheral cities as the series progressed. 


I am similarly hooked by the worlds of Ghosts Ehf&#x27;s Phantom Spark, which are a million lightyears from WiPeout in terms of their influences and atmosphere, much as the underlying hover-jockeying is a million lightyears away from WipeouT in terms of its gentleness and lack of combative elements. But these spaces are just as mesmerising to fly through and think about when not focussed on finding the perfect line through the next corner, or avoiding a patch of grass. Small wonder, given that the game&#x27;s art director is Joost Eggermont, whose streaking astral contraptions and &quot;small interactive moments&quot; I&#x27;ve long admired, but never managed to write about until now.

Then, I realised that some other people might be less enlightened than me about the whole ‘having limits’ things, and that there was a lot of money to be made hawking implants. Enter space strategy story-spewer Stellaris, specifically, it’s spost specent spee-LC The Machine Age. It adds many options for your space civs, most of which I’m too rusty with the ever-yawpening sandbox’s myriad nuances to appreciate. But what&#x27;s this? A new origin that lets you play as techno-religious corpo-cult obsessed with transcending the limits of their meat prisons through cybernetic augmentations? I recognise that from toys!

                              <span>Yes, I&#x27;ve played a portion of Elden Ring&#x27;s expansion Shadow Of The Erdtree and I think it&#x27;s brilliant. But there&#x27;s one thing I didn&#x27;t flesh out in the preview and that&#x27;s the DLC&#x27;s standalone levelling system, brought to our attention a month or so ago. Well, here I am to flesh it out! Be warned, though, the role of the system is a jarring thing to condense into words.

Life In Jars is this YouTuber I&#x27;ve followed for a while. He makes videos that might involve, say, scooping up some puddle water, leaving it in a sealed jar for a while, then coming back to it a few months later. He&#x27;ll report on the results, which are often tremendous. Look at the LIFE in that jar! The little wriggly lads just wriggling around. The blobs whose job is to float and squidge indiscriminately. A lovely bit of fauna sloshing about there, like a forest dwelling for those who implement the five-second rule. It&#x27;s a reminder that bog water is rather beautiful, actually.
Having spent three hours with Elden Ring expansion Shadow Of The Erdtree&#x27;s opening area, I can&#x27;t help but think of Life In Jars. What resides in the shadowy dome of the Big Tree is horrendous! Miserable! The forgotten creatures and their crumbling homes are grim. But oh my word, the shadows have spawned a beautiful disasterpiece. Just, errr, those other jars? The fun guys with the scoopy arms and little legs? Yeah. I have bad news.

                              <span>I usually avoid writing sentences that could easily be quoted on a Steam page, but the exquisitely satisfying sound that Grunn’s garden shears make is the exception. Please feel free to try any of these on for size: Grunn’s shear sound is the Wilhelm Scream of gardening equipment, sure to be referenced for decades to come. Grunn’s shear sound wormed its way past my eyes and into parts of my brain I’d previously assumed could only be accessed by either masterful ASMR or irresponsibly long Q-tips. I used to have anxiety, but now, my only fear in life is that Grunn’s grass will run out, so I no longer have a reason to click away with its shears. Play Grunn, innit. There are, by the way, lots of other things to like about it, although I cannot hear them over the wonderful sound of these shears.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been one month since the sound of engines began. The hardest track ever created in Trackmania was published by a team of mappers on May 4th, bringing an intimidating 16-floor tower called Deep Dip 2 into the racing game. It became a magnet for competitive drivers after a prize pool of over $30,000 was offered to the first three players to conquer its hellish heights. The prize has yet to be claimed. Even today, determined racers continue to bang their heads against the brutally designed course, featuring icy surfaces, curving rails, and perilous loop-the-loops that hang kilometres about the ground. Some players have parked their hopes and given up. But others persevere. The top three players have reached the final floor and currently stand shoulder to shoulder, eyes focused on the prize.

                              <span>If you heard loud swearing last night in the Watford area it may have been one of two things: 1) me cussing out my (borrowed) Steam Deck while stealthily accessing the wifi from outside a closed public library, as I don&#x27;t currently have broadband at home, or 2) me subsequently trying to make head or tail of Mech Engineer, in which you take charge of a mobile undersea metropolis and send squads of painstakingly assembled robosoldiers to semi-auto-battle squidgy alien fauna. 


Engineering a mech is a Herculean labour whose completion eludes today&#x27;s puny scientists, and Mech Engineer doesn&#x27;t aim to make life easier, whatever its putative status as a &quot;means of fun&quot;. Mech Engineer is a game with an attitude problem, frankly. I realised this on in-game day two, when the interface coughed up a bunch of damage reports presented as pieces of paper, which I then had to crumple up and toss away individually.

Where its offworld mining concern once dealt merely with steep drops and irate bugs, it’s since had to face down the robotic army of a rival mineral corp and an omnicidal alien plague. If the subsequent question is &quot;It used to be about the rocks, y&#x27;know?&quot; then DRG’s imminent Season 5 update, Drilling Deeper, is the answer.

Like A Dragon: Yakuza will be a six-part series following characters in the criminal underbelly of Kamurocho, set to straddle between two time periods: 1995 and 2005. The series &quot;showcases modern Japan and the dramatic stories of these intense characters, such as the legendary Kazuma Kiryu, that games in the past have not been able to explore,” said Amazon, who are releasing it through Prime Video, just like their Fallout series.

                              <span>We’ll never know exactly what sort of fiction Tom Clancy would have written if he was less interested in the calibre of specific bullets and their effiency at dismantling burgeoning socialist governments, and more so in the specific sigils required to blast a riot cop through a third story window. While charity shops across the land mourn this devasting loss to their paperback shelves to this very day, we do at least have a glimpse into what such a literary venture may have looked like. Oh, did you like that door? Was it your favourite door? Soz, pal. Strategy game Tactical Breach Wizards just hexed right through it with a new demo as part of Steam Next Fest. I’ve played it, and it’s very exciting stuff, not least for how differently it plays than what I’d expected.

                              <span>Devolver Digital has released an intriguing teaser for what appears to be a new project by Solar Ash and Hyper Light Drifter developer Heart Machine. The reveal is advertised for June 7, the day of the Devolver Direct showcase.
Heart Machine is currently working on Hyper Light Breaker, a 3D third-person co-op action game that is the spiritual successor to Hyper Light Drifter. Gearbox is publishing that game, confirming Devolver&#x27;s teaser is for something different. Based on this brief clip, it’s hard to gauge the nature of this game. It shows a sunset cityscape with a silhouette of a figure, the scene emblazoned with Heart Machine&#x27;s logo. But given the studio’s impressive pedigree, we’re excited and surprised to see a new title so soon.


The Devolver Direct airs on June 7 at 5 p.m. PT/8 p.m. ET. You can keep up with the other summer showcases with our evolving schedule of events. For more on Heart Machine, check out our extended preview for Hyper Light Breaker and our reviews of Solar Ash and Hyper Light Drifter.</span>

I love Elden Ring. I played it for more than 150 hours. It was also my 2022 game of the year by a nautical mile. I loved it so much that I wrote a whole piece on having what I dubbed “post-Elden Ring depression.” That’s why its upcoming expansion, Shadow of the Erdtree, has been among my most anticipated games of 2024 and why I couldn’t wait to fly out to Los Angeles to play the first hands-on demo. Taking place in a special venue in the heart of the famous Hollywood Forever Cemetery (you read that right), I spent three hours freely roaming a po…</span>

Jde o úpravu instalačního programu Linux Mint Software Manager / mintinstall, který vedle této změny je nyní svižnější a rychleji se uživateli načte. Uživatel samozřejmě má možnost neověřené Flatpaky instalovat na vlastní riziko.</span>

Umožní vám jednoduše vytvořit a spravovat Kubernets cluster na vlastních virtuálních serverech. Používat Rancher se naučíte na dalším školení Rancher – Kubernetes na vlastním hardware, které proběhne 17. a 18. června a uskuteční se hybridně, tedy v naší pražské školicí místnosti a zároveň online.</span>

                              <span>Honestly, I turn my back on shooter-of-note Helldivers 2 for (checks calendar)... one, maybe two weeks, and you all go and transform a planet into a black hole. &quot;You&quot; being the players who completed the metagame&#x27;s last Major Order and successfully pumped the Terminid supercolony of Meridia full of an experimental &quot;Dark Fluid&quot; - which Super-Earth, incidentally, pinched from the Illuminate faction during the First Galactic War, aka Helldivers 1.
Now, Meridia has imploded and become a radiant, wailing, purple-fringed disc of pure nothingness, with triumphant players rudely ejected from orbit via emergency hyperspace jump, but subsequently allowed to return and gaze into the dark heart of their victory. Great work, Inferno-plungers. I&#x27;m sure the consequences of this will be neither cosmic nor horrible.

                              <span>Update: Card Bard appears to be a copy of a game by another developer, Dire Decks by kindanice. Dire Decks was released in 2023 on itch.io and was well received there. Kindanice has pointed out the direct likeness between their game and the one released on Steam under another name. Yikes. Thanks to our diligent commenters for catching this. We&#x27;ll try to find out more. 
Original article: The onslaught of fun Steam Next Fest demos you can play right now continues and will not relent. Card Bard is a deckbuilding roguelike shooter in which your wee gunman is seemingly frozen in abject terror as little pill-shaped baddies creep towards him like bacteria on a petri dish. Good thing you have a hand of cards, each one showing how many bullets will bop forth from your body when you select it. It&#x27;s surprisingly tough for something so pastel-paletted. I&#x27;m 10th on the leaderboard. You can probably beat that, right?

                              <span>In EA&#x27;s Desert Strike - released way back in the dim salvages of 1992 - you are a helicopter pilot scooting around a Sylvester Stallone reinvention of Iraq, shooting down tanks and fighters with guns and missiles while rescuing VIPs and fretting constantly about your wafer-thin armour and espresso-sized fuel reserves. It was a no-frills piece of Gulf War fanfic, complete with George Bush ending cameo, and a well-made shooter that used to drive me nuts on Sega Mega Drive.
Megacopter: Blades Of The Goddess is Desert Strike, but heavily Blood-Dragonified and with a big dollop of Airwolf to boot. Here, the enemy troops are naughty Reptoid aliens, the writing is scattershot-satirical (upgrades are bought with pizza tokens) and your helicopter houses the soul of a blood-drinking &quot;AZ-TECH&quot; goddess. Is it a nuanced parody of the Strike series? It doesn&#x27;t feel like it. Did I enjoy the demo? Yes. Does it have a crawling tentacle boss called Queen Oildusa? Also yes, and will you please stop asking questions so I can write the rest of this article.

                              <span>Since the death of E3, June has descended into a chaotic clusterfunk of trailers, broadcasts, announcements, and a generalised frenzy of publicity-seeking barking noises. Summer Game Fest has emerged as a hub for a lot of developers seeking eyes. The 2-hour show hosted by marketing man Geoff Keighley will be broadcasting on Friday, blasting you in the ocular nerves with, probably, a lot of games. However, most of these games will not be brand new, exciting reveals, said Keighley himself in a fresh Twitch Q &amp; A. &quot;There will be, definitely, new announcements,&quot; he said, &quot;but the show is largely focused on, I think, existing games that have new updates for fans.&quot; He&#x27;s mentioning this ahead of time, he said, to set expectations.

                              <span>I&#x27;m sure you could fill a bottomless pit with the things Larian decided not to add to Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3. One of those things was, in fact, a bottomless pit. Not just a bottomless pit, but a conveniently portable, Looney Tunes-esque hole into which you could seemingly chuck everything from items and equipment to characters. Speaking to me during the same interview in which they discussed long-abandoned plans for bringing back Baldur’s Gate 1’s Candlekeep, Larian CEO Swen Vincke and Baldur’s Gate 3 lead writer Adam Smith (RPS in peace) touched on the subject with tantalising brevity. Argh, if only I hadn’t had to run off and catch a taxi, I’d still be there now, discussing the many applications of a portable hole. Bypassing carrying capacity limits would just be the start of it.

                              <span>If you love cosy games where the biggest challenge is choosing between which farm utensil to place next to your barn doors, then Tiny Glade may be just the game for you. It&#x27;s a creative building game like The Sims 4 but with none of the fuss of actually controlling lives - and no quests, combat or arbitrary challenges of any kind.

Instead, Tiny Glade simply offers a meadow and tools with which to build. The vibe of the game is cottage-core at its finest, with enough whimsigoth finery that you&#x27;ll soon lament that you can&#x27;t actually live inside your glorious creations. I&#x27;ve played the charming demo as part of Steam Next Fest, and you&#x27;ll find some thoughts from my time with it below.

                              <span>A DIY engineer has created a realistic tank simulator that puts the average haptic controller to shame. The mechanical monster is jury-rigged to the top of an office desk and must be reloaded with a new shell after every shot. The recoil is terrifying. It&#x27;s operated by three people: one person drives the tank with a steering wheel and levers, another uses cranks to aim the gun barrel, and a third reloads the shells that eject automatically from the chamber after every desk-lifting blast. The &quot;shells&quot; in question are 2-litre bottles of fizzy drink, and the crew has set up a whole rack of these bottles for panicked reloading. If you are the kind of person who yearns for the immersion of the legendary Steel Battalion controller then you will get a definite buzz from watching the death machine in action below.

SGF is sort of already in motion - last week, Sony kicked off the proceedings with their latest State of Play showcase, but you can expect the majority of new videogame announcements from Friday 7th June with the Summer Game Fest 2024 Opening Showcase, a two-hour livestreamed event which starts at 10pm UK, 5pm ET and 2pm PT.

                              <span>The remake of Riven, the sequel to Myst, arrives on June 25. This modernized version of the 1997 PC classic has been rebuilt from the ground up and is coming to PC and VR headsets.
Riven has been reimagined by its original creators at Cyan Worlds. The game now boasts full freedom of movement, updated gameplay, improved graphics, and reworked puzzles. It also introduces new content through characters, challenges, and storytelling.
See it in action in the game&#x27;s new trailer below: 


Riven will be available on PC, Mac, and Meta Quest 2 and 3. To learn more about how this remake came together, writer Adam Morgan visited Cyan World and spoke to its principal creators about the game in this in-depth feature.

                              <span>After teasing PC support tests earlier this year, the PC adapter for PlayStation VR2 arrives this August, the company has revealed. More specifically, the device will cost $59.99 and hit select retailers and PlayStation&#x27;s online store starting August 7. With this device, you can use the PlayStation VR2 hardware to play SteamVR games, including the critically acclaimed Half-Life: Alyx. 
Ironically, PlayStation gamers have been asking for a Half-Life: Alyx port for PlayStation VR (and now PlayStation VR2) for years. Though that still isn&#x27;t happening, this PC adapter at least allows players to use their PlayStation VR2 device to play the game through Steam. They can do the same with hundreds of other SteamVR games, like Fallout 4 VR and War Thunder. 
Here&#x27;s a look at the minimum PC requiremen…</span>

                              <span>It’s been a while since we last got an update on Metal Slug Tactics, the turn-based strategy spin-off of the popular side-scrolling shoot &#x27;em up. The game was first announced during the online-only E3 2021 and has suffered a few delays since then with minimal updates. After a long wait, the game has finally reemerged with a new trailer and a fall 2024 launch window.
The new video shows off the game&#x27;s spin on tactics, with long-time stars Marco, Eri, Fio, and Tarma taking literal turns obliterating the opposition. The game sees players building squads of classic Metal Slug characters, each with unique loadouts of recognizable series weapons, to take on signature villains and bosses, like the warship in the video.


Metal Slug Tactics is developed by Leikir Studio and is published by Dotemu, the team behind TMNT: Shredder&#x27;s Revenge. Famed composer Tee Lopes (Shredder&#x27;s Revenge, Sonic Mania) is developing the game&#x27;s soundtrack. 
When first revealed, Metal Slug Tactics was only slated to launch for Switch and PC. Today&#x27;s trailer confirms that it&#x27;s also coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.</span>

                              <span>Kena: Bridge of Spirits is making the leap to Xbox in August. The 2021 action-adventure game has been available only on PlayStation and PC, and its move to Microsoft’s platform comes with some new in-game goodies.
As the debut title by Ember Lab, this story-driven action game stars Kena, a young spirit guide who must unravel the mystery of a destroyed village by helping lost souls move on to the afterlife. She’s assisted by the Rot, tiny, adorable spirits Kena can command to aid in puzzle-solving and combat. The game’s design draws inspiration from series such as The Legend of Zelda, while combat has shades of From Software’s Dark Souls. 
Kena hits Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One on August 15 for $39.99 and will include exclusive pirate-themed Rot hats, a Golden Rot skin, and a unique staff for Kena. A new physical premium edition will also be available and will consist of these items, a digital soundtrack, and an exclusive sticker sheet. The Xbox version also includes the Anniversary DLC update, which includes the Spirit Guide Trials, additional Kena outfits, and New Game+


We awarded Kena: Bridge of Spirits a 9 out of 10, with former editor-in-chief Andrew Reiner writing in his review, &quot;Bridge of Spirits stumbles a little in spots, yet confidently sprints into the heart of the adventure, rewarding the player with secrets galore and visuals that are almost always worth admiring. If you love Zelda-like games or are just looking for an experience that will make you smile every step of the way, you can’t go wrong with Kena: Bridge of Spirits.&quot; The game was also a sales success, recouping its development costs a month after its initial release in September 2021.

                              <span>This year&#x27;s Summer Game Fest showcase is happening this week, on Friday, June 7, at 2 p.m. PT/5 p.m. ET, and with more than 55 studios and publishers set to be featured at the event (including Play Days this weekend) this year, fans have been speculating on what they might see. That includes Kingdom Hearts fans, who have been hoping to see something related to Kingdom Hearts IV at SGF this year, given it&#x27;s been more than two years since its reveal. 
However, SGF host and creator Geoff Keighley thinks Kingdom Hearts fans should lower their expectations for the show. 
&quot;People keep asking about Kingdom Hearts, I don&#x27;t know why,&quot; Keighley says during a recent stream where he answered questions about SGF. &quot;I think it&#x27;s because we did [Final Fantasy VII Rebirth] last year or something like that. But yeah, people are setting themselves up for failure but you guys can keep hoping.&quot; 
Here&#x27;s a clip of it, too:

Now, Keighley could be playing coy, especially with the &quot;but you guys can keep hoping&quot; part at the end, but it&#x27;s more likely that he&#x27;s trying to nicely let Kingdom Hearts fans know that if they expect to see Kingdom Hearts IV during SGF, they might be disappointed. 
In the meantime, watch the Kingdom Hearts IV reveal trailer, and then read Game Informer&#x27;s exclusive interview with Tetsuya Nomura about Kingdom Hearts IV, the series&#x27; future with Final Fantasy, and more.

He told the LA Times this in a new interview, which is where he also said the studio has multiple single-player projects in development, as reported by VideoGamesChronicle.
&quot;I promise you, we will not be The Last of Us studio forever,&quot; Druckmann said, revealing the team is working on &quot;multiple single-player projects.&quot; He continued, adding, &quot;We create experiences that are steeped in story and characters, especially relationships. The stories have some sort of philosophical core that everything is going to revolve around and feed into.&quot;


Elsewhere in the interview, Druckmann told the LA Times he came up with the idea about a man and a girl crossing a post-apocalyptic landscape – the premise of …</span>

Did you know that the word &#x27;book&#x27; was originally spelled with several extra &#x27;o&#x27;s in it? This was changed when it was collectively decided that telling someone to &quot;please, just read a book&quot; was resulting in several more murders a year than anyone could be bothered to keep track of. This week, it’s Obsidian vet and Pentiment creator Josh Sawyer! Cheers Josh! Mind if we have a nose at your bookshelf?

In which case, wow, bold of Hugo Martin to cast himself as the Doom Slayer, but I like the moxy. Before I barge into the comments uninvited and argue with no-one in particular that Doom Eternal’s lateral expansion of its gameplay loop was ultimately a fantastic choice for the long-term health of the series, you swine, let’s read this week’s best writing about games (and game related things!)

                              <span>Spain&#x27;s Ministry of the Interior says eight people have been arrested after police dismantled a €5.3m pirate IPTV network serving local expats. Authorities aren&#x27;t naming the service but if the name TVMucho rings any bells, people are on the right track. That police identified the owner of the service is no surprise. The Dutchman has never hidden away and has continuously claimed his service operates legally. If only in part, it&#x27;s still streaming channels right now.

                              <span>I haven&#x27;t played Bloodborne and so references to its world or characters mean little to me. Kart racers, meanwhile? There I&#x27;m in my element due to a lifetime of Mario Kart, Diddy Kong Racing and Sonic &amp; All-Stars Racing Transformed. It&#x27;s those games that make me interested in Nightmare Kart, a PSX-aesthetic racing game which was formerly known as Bloodborne Kart, and which is out now.

Omenroad turns out to be the end of the road, however, both for Wildermyth and - for now - for the team that made it, Worldwalker Games.

                              <span>It feels as if every action-RPG can be described in terms of its relationship to genre daddy Diablo. Wolcen:Lords Of Mayhem, for example, launched a few months after Diablo 4 was announced and helped to satiate some early click cravings. Briefly.

Early positive sentiment was quickly scuppered by bugs, slow updates and more. Now its developers say that they&#x27;re ending support for the game, and multiplayer functionality will be switched off this September.

                              <span>Merry weekends, everyone! It&#x27;s time for a chill couple of days, I think. A bunch of us have recently returned from trips down to the Brighton office to meet some new faces. Weird to think I&#x27;m now the most far-flung of the lot, living way up here in Glasgow. Maybe that&#x27;s why I elected to take over these Playing This Weekend posts, to help fill the friendless void growing inside my heart.
So just know that if you don&#x27;t sound off in the comments below with news of what you&#x27;re playing this weekend, the void in my heart will grow, until one day it consumes me. And then who will write these posts? Here&#x27;s what we&#x27;re clicking on this weekend!

He created Killer7, the No More Heroes series, worked with James Gunn (before he directed Guardians of the Galaxy or was put in charge of DC films) on Lollipop Chainsaw, and lots more. In preparation for his role as the keynote speaker at MomoCon this year, we caught up with him over e-mail to discuss his next game, Hotel Barcelona (a collaboration with Deadly Premonition creator Hidetaka &quot;Swery65&quot; Suehiro), remastering his 2011 game Shadows of the Damned, Batman, and more.
Game Informer: Hotel Barcelona is inspired by horror films. Are there specific films you cite as references?
Goichi &quot;Suda51&quot; Suda: There are a lot of them. Swery of White Owls is the main creator, so you should probably ask him …</span>

At the same time, it can be argued that the file-sharing software paved the way for legitimate business models that would eventually evolve into subscription-based platforms such as Spotify and Netflix.

                              <span>It&#x27;s no secret that online piracy presents a major challenge to copyright holders. With owners of pirate sites largely unresponsive, search engines and other online intermediaries are often asked to intervene. With a starring role for anti-piracy company Link-Busters, Google has seen a significant surge in takedown requests, one that has set new records on the way.

                              <span>Data published by S2CPI, the body responsible for Spain&#x27;s administrative pirate site blocking program, shows that the number of headline domains blocked during Q1 2024 is noticeably down on the same period in 2023 and 2022. Overall, sites are still being blocked in large numbers, but the real growth isn&#x27;t found on main domains. Easily and quickly deployed at almost no cost, subdomains can circumvent blocking and Spain blocks them in their thousands.

                              <span>After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora&#x27;s Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora&#x27;s Mask&#x27;s unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 1:00 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved.

                              <span>Toys for Bob, the developer of Crash Bandicoot 4 and the Skylanders series, has announced a publishing deal with Xbox for its next game. The studio recently went independent after splitting off from its former parent company, Activision Blizzard.
The studio states its new title is &quot;very early in development&quot; and that we won&#x27;t see it for some time. Whatever this game is, Xbox will be its home, which isn&#x27;t surprising since the studio teased it was exploring a relationship with the publisher a couple of months ago.
We&#x27;re excited to announce that we&#x27;ll be partnering with @Xbox to publish our next new game. We&#x27;re still very early in development, so you might not hear from us for a bit - but know that we&#x27;re working hard on an experience we&#x27;re so sooo inspired about!

Toys For Bob went independent in February, a few months after Microsoft acquired Activision Blizzard. The studio is seemingly getting to have its cake and eat it too, since it still gets to work with Xbox while being an autonomous entity. Prior to leaving Activision, Toys For Bob worked on the recent Crash Bandicoot games such as Crash Bandicoot 4: It&#x27;s About Time and Crash Team Rumble. It also developed the Spyro Reignited Trilogy and created the once-wildly popular Skylanders series.

                              <span>During Sony&#x27;s PlayStation State of Play, new gameplay and details were shared for Marvel Rivals. For the uninitiated. Marvel Rivals is a superhero (specifically Marvel superhero) team-based PVP shooter inspired by games like Overwatch. The footage, seen below, reveals Venom and Adam Warlock are coming to the game. The footage also shows a new location – the Tokyo 2099: Spider-Islands map.
Alongside the new gameplay details, the game is now also confirmed to be coming to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S alongside the previously confirmed PC platform. Developer NetEase is also planning a closed beta for the game in July. PlayStation beta testers will have exclusive access to Spider-Man&#x27;s Scarlet Spider cosmetic skin.

The game never had a specific release date, but we were admittedly expecting it this year. In a post on the official Little Nightmares III X account, the team shared the message below, writing, &quot;As much as we can&#x27;t wait for you to return to the Nowhere, we also want to make sure we give the game the care and love it deserves. Quality is a top priority for us, and we know you feel the same way. For this reason, we&#x27;ve made the decision to shift the release of the game to 2025.&quot;
Please do bear with us, little ones, for we need a little extra time to prepare your visit.

Notably, Supermassive, the developer behind games like Until Dawn (which is coming to PC and PlayStation 5 soon) did not develop the first two games. Those games were developed by Tarsier Studios, whose next project has not been announced.

                              <span>If you haven’t followed Infinity Nikki, it’s equal parts charming, beautiful, and ambitious. The open-world game is the latest entry in the Nikki series of fashion games, which is very popular in Asia, and Westerners are getting their biggest exposure to it yet with this charming adventure. 


The game unfolds on the magical continent of Miraland, and Nikki must save it. Her main power is &quot;styling,&quot; which involves changing clothes from different nations, allowing her to adopt unique abilities. For example, one outfit allows her to float while another cleanses corrupted creatures of demonic energy. The trailer shows one outfit that lets players summon a giant flower to glide through the air. Another ability shrinks her to the size of her small companion, Momo, to access tight areas and other locations. 
The more outfits you collect, the more abilities Nikki has to solve puzzles and overcome platforming obstacles. But despite the &quot;save the world&quot; premise, Infinity Nikki is billed as a relaxing adventure. You can also catch bugs, go fishing, and gather resources to craft new outfits, among other activities. 
Infinity Nikki looks wild, and fans can get their first taste of it in a beta test happening during Q3 of this year. The game is coming to PlayStation 5, PC, iOS, and Android but has no release window.</span>

Path of Exile 2 on console will introduce couch co-op and supports cross-play and cross-progression. Despite Sony not having an official early access program, the game will be playable on the platform when early access begins on PC. As with the first game, Path of Exile 2 is a free-to-play action RPG that was first announced a few years ago.</span>

                              <span>Developer Survios has released the first look at gameplay in its upcoming VR game, Alien: Rogue Incursion, and it turns out, exploring a seemingly abandoned  facility in VR looks as terrifying as you&#x27;d expect.
The trailer aired during today&#x27;s PlayStation State of Play as the game is coming to PS VR2, but it&#x27;s also coming to Meta Quest 3 and Steam (for other PC VR devices) this holiday season. In the trailer, we get a few glimpses of some Xenomorphs, the tracking device we&#x27;ll be using to avoid said Xenomorphs, and a look at some pods that indicate we might be fighting more than one. 
Check it out for yourself in the Alien: Rogue Incursion gameplay trailer below: 


In a new PlayStation Blog post, Survios chief product officer TQ Jefferson explains that Alien: Rogue Incursion was developed from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5. Jefferson also shares that the &quot;high tension shooter&quot; tasks players with exploring an &quot;overrun facility on the inhospitable planet Purdan.&quot; 
&quot;Dynamically spawning and pathing with countless unique possibilities, even we couldn&#x27;t tell you exactly where and when each Xenomorph will strike, let alone what strategies it might use or if it&#x27;ll bring some friends,&quot; the blog post reads. &quot;While heart-pounding combat is the core of Alien: Rogue Incursion, grabbing your pulse rifle and blasting your way out of every situation is not always the best strategy. 
&quot;Constantly hunted by unpredictable and resourceful Xenomorphs, players will often find creativity and a level head to be their greatest weapons, especially when it comes to leveraging the environment to their advantage.&quot; 
Alien: Rogue Incursion hits VR this holiday season.

                              <span>Until Dawn, the 2015 horror adventure game from Supermassive Games, is coming to PlayStation 5 and PC in remake form this fall. We received a new trailer for the beloved game alongside the announcement during today&#x27;s State of Play presentation. 
Until Dawn puts you in control of eight teenagers/young adults who venture up a mountain for a fun night in a secluded cabin. In typical slasher-movie fashion, there is much more than meets the eye regarding this cabin and its surrounding area. Relying heavily on player choice, Until Dawn&#x27;s narrative uses a system called the Butterfly Effect, where pivotal choices you make have consequences that go far beyond that which you can immediately recognize. The game stars actors like Rami Malek, Hayden Panettiere, Meaghan Martin, and more.


Originally announced as a full remake of the game, the trailer footage does not appear to be a significant step up in terms of visuals, appearing to be more in line with the industry&#x27;s definition of a remaster. PlayStation&#x27;s official description says it&#x27;s been &quot;rebuilt and enhanced for PS5 consoles and PC.&quot; Developed by Ballistic Moon, this improved version also boasts new environments, collectibles, and re-cut narrative sequences. 
We loved Until Dawn when it arrived on PlayStation 4 in 2015, awarding it a score of 9 out of 10. In the time since Until Dawn&#x27;s original release, Supermassive has released other games in the genre, including The Dark Pictures Anthology and The Quarry. The studio is currently working on The Casting of Frank Stone, a game set in the Dead by Daylight universe. Until Dawn arrives on PlayStation 5 and PC this fall.</span>

                              <span>It’s been a long time since we wrote about a new Dynasty Warriors game, but that changes today with the announcement of Dynasty Warriors: Origins, the new release from Koei Tecmo’s Omega Force studio, a team long known for work on the venerable franchise.
The games have an unusual identity and are, in some ways, a genre unto themselves. They almost always feature large-scale battles in which the lead character can sweep through dozens of enemy combatants with a single swing.
That playstyle appears to remain intact if this new trailer is to be believed.
A lot has changed in action gameplay in the years since Dynasty Warriors was at its most popular, but there’s no doubt that the series once had an enthusiastic fanbase.
We’ll see if the series is able to update its gameplay and draw in new fans when it hits PlayStation 5 next year.</span>

                              <span>Today&#x27;s State of Play concluded with the reveal of a new Astro Bot game. Unlike the last entry, Astro&#x27;s Playroom, which was a PS5 launch title and a glorified (but very fun) tech demo for the console, this new game is a full-fledged platforming adventure. It&#x27;s also got an easy-to-remember name: Astro Bot. 
The trailer sees Astro Bot soaring through the galaxy on a Dual Sense-shaped spaceship to explore a variety of vibrant platforming stages set to a smile-inducing soundtrack. He also shows off new abilities like donning gloves that fire springs to grab and swing enemies, soaking water like a sponge to grow gigantic, and, best of all, just a random Parappa the Rappa reference (among other PlayStation franchises). It looks delightful, and we want to play it. 


A PlayStation Blog post also states the game features over 80 levels across 6 galaxies, 20 new abilities, and 70 new enemy types. Astro Bot will be available on PlayStation 5 on September 6. Our review of Astro&#x27;s Playroom can be found here.</span>

Regardless, we aren’t complaining about seeing more of Bloober Team’s remake of the PS2 classic. The trailer provides new looks at gameplay and the psychological scares that made the first game so beloved.

                              <span>Capcom has pulled back the curtains on Monster Hunter Wilds, revealing gameplay in a brand new trailer that aired during today&#x27;s PlayStation State of Play. In this trailer, we watch a monster hunter ride through a treacherous sandstorm on the back of a mount before starting a fight with a lion-like bear creature, and as you might expect, it looks great. 
We then watch our hunter fight a rocky toad monster in a cavernous canyon area before three buffalo-esque monsters join the fight. If you&#x27;ve played a Monster Hunter before, you have a good idea of what Wilds looks like – big, flashy, and exciting. 
Check it out for yourself in the Monster Hunter Wilds trailer below: 


This is our first look at Monster Hunter Wilds since its reveal at The Game Awards 2023 last December. Those with Monster Hunter World and Monster Hunter World: Iceborne save date will get exclusive in-game rewards. The trailer also reiterates that Monster Hunter Wild hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC in 2025.

                              <span>Today’s PlayStation State of Play brought a lengthy new trailer for Where Winds Meet, an upcoming action game from Everstone Studio. The Chinese studio describes its project as “Groundbreaking Oriental Wuxia Open World” on its official website. Today’s trailer seems to bear that out, with a number of bombastic and over-the-top scenes featuring high-flying martial arts against the backdrop of rainswept forests, burning castles, and warriors wielding sword and spear.
Today’s video makes it clear that the game is in development for PlayStation 5, but no word yet on a release date.</span>

                              <span>PlayStation has announced it is bringing its 2022 hit PlayStation-exclusive game, God of War Ragnarök, to PC. It revealed this during today&#x27;s State of Play with a new trailer alongside a September 19 release date. 
This follows PlayStation&#x27;s recent trend of bringing its single-player, narrative-driven games over to PC years after they first launch on PlayStation. Just this month, it brought Ghost of Tsushima Director&#x27;s Cut to PC, and today, PlayStation CEO Hermen Hulst revealed all live-service games will launch day-and-date on PS5 and PC while &quot;tentpole&quot; single-player games will launch at later dates on PC. 
As you might expect, the PC version of God of War Ragnarök will feature unlocked frame rates, Nvidia DLSS 3.7. (and AMD FSR 3.1 and Intel XESS 1.3), super ultrawide support, and other PC features. This version of Ragnarök will feature the free Valhalla DLC from last year, too, and pre-purchasing the game gets you in-game rewards like the Kratos Risen Snow Armor and Atreus Risen Snow Tunic. 
Check it out for yourself below in the God of War Ragnarök PC reveal trailer: 


According to the game&#x27;s Steam listing, it will require a PlayStation Network account. 
God of War Ragnarök hits PC on September 19, 2024.

                              <span>Today’s State of Play revealed a new fantasy action game called Ballad of Antara. The trailer shows all manner of over-the-top stylish combat against supernatural foes. However, the hero does all of this while carrying a small child on his back.


Ballad of Antara is billed as an Unreal Engine 5 single-player, free-to-play action RPG starring multiple characters called Emissaries. Each of these characters sports their own class and abilities, as well as a unique story. Players will travel between two worlds seeking out these Emissaries to strengthen your force, but the young girl being carried around is the apparently the key to salvation. A PlayStation Blog post on the game describes your duty to her as such: &quot;You will help her undo the devastation done to this desolate world through trials, twists, and confrontation, and witness her growth along the way.&quot;
In addition to a single-player story, the game lets up to three players explore together in multiplayer, whether they be close buddies or total strangers wandering the game alongside you. Developer Tipworks also states plans to continually update Ballad of Antara post-launch with new zones, story content, and Emissaries. 
Ballad of Antara is coming to PS5, PC, and mobile platforms in 2025.</span>

                              <span>PlayStation has formally revealed Concord, the first game from Firewalk Studios, which it acquired in 2023, and it brings a healthy (and comedic dose) of sci-fi to the console&#x27;s 2024 lineup. Concord is both the start of a new sci-fi IP for PlayStation and a five-versus-five-player multiplayer shooter coming to PlayStation 5 and PC this year. 
Before showcasing some third-person shooter gameplay, a vignette setting up the game&#x27;s world and tone played, and it&#x27;s here we get a look at its Guardians of the Galaxy-esque action. We see several characters who appear to make up the rag-tag group of heroes we&#x27;ll be controlling, each with seemingly unique abilities, attempting to capture a special device from someone attempting to escape a rundown locale called Crater City. 
Check it out for yourself in the Concord cinematic reveal below: 


After this vignette, PlayStation showcased our first look at Concord&#x27;s gameplay. We get a look at Vale, a sniper, Lennox, a cowboy-esque revolver shooter, Haymar, who uses a magical bow and arrow, Star Child, a brutish shotgun user, and 1-Off, a support character who appears to use support-type elemental moves. The gameplay looks reminiscent of Destiny 2&#x27;s PvP modes, although brighter in color and more fantastical in visual design. 
Check out the Concord gameplay reveal for yourself below:


After the gameplay, some of the Firewalk developers spoke about what players can expect, including deployable gear that can exist throughout a full game (across multiple rounds) and asymmetrical match-ups between players. While the gameplay only showcased five characters, a quick look at the game&#x27;s roster revealed several more. 
Firewalk says every week when you log on to Concord, you&#x27;ll be treated to a short cutscene vignette teaching you more about the characters. 
Firewalk and PlayStation will hold a beta on PS5 and PC this July before the game&#x27;s simultaneous launch on those platforms on August 23, 2024.

Announced a few weeks back, Redfall game update 4 introduces a much-requested offline mode and single-player pausing, together with some new progression features and activities: a Community Standing bar whereby Support currency can be spent on rewards from the Safehouse Skill tree, and Elder Nests, aka vampire nests with specially modified vampire bosses. That&#x27;s in addition to new enemy encounters in Redfall Commons, improved AI and a new Unrivaled Weapon.

Skald is terrific. I&#x27;ve tried to come up with a clever angle on its journey, but they all wind up saying the same thing: For all its retro stylings (right down to party portraits taking up an unnecessary quarter of the screen at all times), it&#x27;s an accessible, charming treat, and the best modernisation of 80s RPGs that I&#x27;ve ever played.

                              <span>I fear we may have swum the Rubicon of diminishing returns where multiplayer horror games inspired by Lethal Company are concerned. The recent Content Warning has sucked up all the remaining oxygen in the room, and oxygen is pretty important in Murky Divers, for reasons that are hopefully self-evident. Still, Murky Divers has some fairly eye-catching USPs. It&#x27;s got underwater physics, of course, and it puts you and - unhelpfully - your friends in charge of a submarine.

                              <span>There is a time for perfect clarity in a shooter, for clean walls and clear-cut character silhouettes. But this is not it. Retro first-person gunwaltzer Selaco is a messy machine gun dash through an office exploding with glass, concrete, splinters, and sparks. The glock-toting wreckage &#x27;em up first hit our radar when it was announced as a modern combination of F.E.A.R. and Doom, promising both the fiendish AI enemies of the former and the satisfying blasting of the latter. Well, it&#x27;s out today. Bursting forth into the corporate lobby of early access with uzis akimbo, peppering the walls with angry bullets. Good, I say.

                              <span>In Mike Judge’s 1999 cult comedy Office Space, there’s a scene where Ron Livingston’s Peter - a programmer working a tedious corporate job - visits a hypnotist. “Is there any way that you could, sorta, just zonk me out so I don’t know that I’m at work, in here,” Peter asks of the hypnotist, pointing to his head. “Could I come home and think that I’ve been fishing all day, or something?”. That’s basically the high-level concept for brilliant sci-fi comedy show Severance, right there. Not wanting to spoil any more than I absolutely have to, I’ll present you with two facts up top. 1. It features a touching queer relationship between John Turturro and Christopher Walken and 2. It’s some of the best television I’ve seen in the last few years. Throw in some Stanley Parable, Control, Gilliam’s Brazil, and some more meta undertones of general musing on gamified reward loops, and you’ve got Severance.

                              <span>Between this, my supporter post later, and the fact I decided to watch Office Space again this week, I’d like to make it clear to any colleagues or management reading that I value and love them all dearly, and am 110% committed to the eternal grind machine of covering videogames online. Workday malaise is universal, however, whether or not you’re lucky enough to enjoy your job as much as I do. Enter Office Fight, a stylish physics action game where you, a ghost, posess office equipment to cause as much physics-based chaos as possible. The PR did some Office Space jokes in the email, so I pretty much had to cover it. At least once I realised what they were doing, after initially just thinking they were being a massive donkey.

The topic, comedy rock RPG/door-kicking sim Deathbulge: Battle of the Bands, was picked by a sadly absent Alice B, but you know what they say when beloved colleagues become ensnared in the kind of Kafkaesque employment limbo that only a corporate acquisition can engineer: the show must go on. We’re therefore sticking to the schedule, and will launch the liveblog at 4pm BST today, Friday May 31st.

                              <span>Riot games have committed to a series of new measures to curtail harassment and hate-speech in the Valorant community. In a video entitled ‘Keeping Our Community Healthy // Dev Updates,” studio head Anna Donlon took to Xitter to outline the new measures for the competitive FPS. Below is a graphic detailing the changes, which include new penalties such as hardware bans for offenders, and an expanded role for the game&#x27;s Voice Evaluation tech, which monitors chat for bad behaviour. “If you want to make evil statements under the guise of &#x27;[naughty word SEO doesn&#x27;t like being in the first paragraph] talk&#x27;, you aren&#x27;t welcome here,” writes the official Valorant account.

It showed off more of how its lovely desert environments morph to fit the weather and how its inhabitants largely don&#x27;t get on. We also got a look at some cursed lions, an armoured frog with an unsettling tongue and a rideable Chocobo-esque mount that lets you ping arrows on the fly. Let me break it down for you readers, as someone who is increasingly excited at the prospect of more colourful pants.

The morning is cloudy but bright and calm, the north London suburbs are a blissful checkerboard of red roofs and flourishing lawns, hope glistens faintly in the gutters and ditches beside the tube. How unlike the innards of Centum, a point-and-click horror game (Steam page here) that begins with a dreary retro desktop interface on which there are curious text files, curioser decryption tools and most curious of all, an .exe of some kind that drops you into a simulation consisting of a stone prison chamber. Hang on, I&#x27;m changing trains...

                              <span>My PC has a big white case, and sometimes, I sit and think: “big white box good!” But other times, I glance over to my PS5 and think: “other big white box also good!” Then I start getting fanciful and imagine a lovely future where they can both combine into one. Keeping track of two big white boxes is hard! Luckily, I only have to write about one of those big white boxes for RPS the vast majority of the time. Today is one of the rare occasions I do have to cover both, so here’s everything announced at yesterday’s Playstation State Of Play that you, the discerning big white box owner, might find relevant:

                              <span>Sony have dropped a trailer and release date for Concord at their latest State Of Play, Concord being a new 5V5 multiplayer FPS in which you play a bunch of freegans carrying out heists on various loudly coloured alien planets. Sorry, not freegans - freegunners. Freeganism is a portmanteau of &quot;free&quot; and &quot;vegan&quot; referring to people who fish jars of near-spoiled hummus out of supermarket dumpsters according to an ideology of minimal resource consumption. Freegunners, meanwhile, are lairy Guardians Of The Galaxy-alike mercenaries with phat guns and playstyle-defining secondary abilities. They do not consume hummus as far as I know. The game is out 23rd August 2024, with a beta happening in July, and I&#x27;ve got an overview trailer for you below.

                              <span>Per last night’s Sony State of Play, PS5 darling and supposedly rather good action-dad adventure God of War Ragnarök is coming to PC on September 19th 2024. The good news is that the port, co-developed by Jetpack Interactive and original makers Santa Monica Studio, will pack in all the DLSS 3, FSR 3, and ultrawide what-have-yous that one might expect from a big, monied PC release. The bad, silly, clearly pointless news is that it will need a PlayStation Network (PSN) account, despite the complete lack of multiplayer.

                              <span>YouTuber Albino si stěžuje na automatickou kontrolu autorských práv na YouTube. Když streamoval Fallout, jeho pračka Samsung dokončila cyklus a zahrála melodii. Tato melodie byla vyhodnocena jako porušení autorských práv, protože se shoduje s nahrávkou od uživatele Audego starou devět let. Což je vlastně přesně nahraná melodie pračky Samsung. Ke klipu však Audego připojil Content ID, tedy označil jej za vlastní výtvor.</span>

Přestože byl Talm původně vytvořen pro deklarativní instalaci Cozystack, není specificky vázán na tuto platformu a lze ho použít pro správu jakýchkoliv konfigurací Talos Linuxu.</span>

                              <span>Revealed during The Game Awards 2023 last December, The First Descendant is an upcoming looter-shooter RPG from Nexon and one of the South Korean company&#x27;s first forays into the console market space. Due out this year, this free-to-play third-person multiplayer shooter is hoping to attract players within the Destiny 2 and Warframe community and newcomers alike. And after playing the game for a couple of hours, we&#x27;re inclined to believe Nexon is on to something here. 
Ahead of the game&#x27;s release, Game Informer editor Wesley LeBlanc traveled to Seoul, South Korea, to visit Nexon and speak to some of The First Descendant&#x27;s leads about what players can expect, its plans for the game after launch, and more.

                              <span>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero’s latest trailer has unveiled fusion warriors for its roster. It also seems to tease another announcement on the horizon.
The trailer reveals the additions of Gotenks (the fusion of Goten and Trunks), Kefla (the fusion of Caulifla and Kale), Fused Zamasu, and Goku and Vegeta’s fusions, Vegito and Gogeta. Watch them trade blows in the trailer below: 


Since each fusion includes the fighters that make them up and their various transformations, the full list of characters joining the roster amounts to 21. Check them out below.

The trailer ends with a message serving as a classic callback to the anime that states, “Next time on Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero: Summer Game Fest 2024.” Could we be getting a release date at Geoff Keighley’s showcase? Given that the game was revealed during another Keighley show, The Game Awards 2023, it wouldn’t be surprising.
Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero is the next entry in what’s known in the West as the Budokai Tenkaichi series (Sparking is the franchise&#x27;s original Japanese name). The roster is only halfway revealed, but we’ve already seen a number of confirmed fighters from Dragon Ball Z and Dragon Ball Super, including multiple versions of the same characters. The game has no release window but is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. You can learn more about the game&#x27;s new mechanics and features here.</span>

Games inspired by The Legend of Zelda are common; after all, the long-running Nintendo franchise is among the most influential series in gaming history. Because of this, various games take the Zelda format and try to replicate it, but these homages often miss out on the magic that makes that series greater than the sum of its parts. This is particularly true in the indie space, with Zelda-inspired titles a dime a dozen, making it difficult to stand out from the crowd. Minishoot&#x27; Adventures clearly draws inspiration from Zelda – specifically A Link to the Past – but by applying…</span>

                              <span>PlayStation has reiterated its approach to releasing its games on PC, stating live-service games will launch day-and-date on PC. However, its tentpole single player games will not. 
This comes from one of PlayStation&#x27;s dual CEOs, Hermen Hulst, during a public business presentation held earlier this morning. During it, Hulst explained the strategy for releasing PlayStation&#x27;s single-player games on PC at a later date, rather than day-and-date, citing it&#x27;s part of a strategy to bring more people into the PlayStation platform. 


&quot;Indeed, we are bringing our titles to the PC platform, and we have a dual approach here,&quot; Hulst said. &quot;On the live service side, we are releasing our titles simultaneously, so day and date on PlayStation 5 and PC. But with our tentpole titles, our single player narra…</span>

                              <span>The PlayStation 5 generation is already Sony&#x27;s most profitable yet, the company has announced. In terms of numbers, the PS5 generation has already earned Sony $106 billion, according to a slide from its &quot;Game &amp; Network Services Segment&quot; presentation from PlayStation&#x27;s two new CEOs, Hideaki Nishino and Hermen Hulst. 
However, on that same slide, Sony shows that the PlayStation 4 generation earned $107 billion, which is obviously more than $106 billion. But, the reason Sony is calling the PS5 generation the most profitable one yet is because the PS4 generation is largely complete whereas the PS5 presumably still has years to go. Given it&#x27;s made $106 billion in roughly four years, it seems Sony is confident it will surpass $107 billion in the coming months or years. 
As for what Sony is including in its profits, it&#x27;s the entire gamut of the PS5 generation. This includes the PS5 console itself, associated hardware and accessories, and software, too. It also includes services, like PlayStation Plus, according to the presentation. 
One of the reasons the PS5 generation might be Sony&#x27;s most profitable yet is because even though the playerbase is as big as the PS4 – both are sitting at 49 million active consoles as of last month – PS5 players are playing significantly more on their console. The PS5 generation sits at 2.4 billion total gameplay hours while the PS4 sits at 1.4 billon. More playtime likely equates to more spending, which might be one of the reasons the PS5 generation is doing financially as well as it is. 
Life-to-date spending on the PS5 is also higher amongst players than the PS4, too. Across peripherals, services, content/add-ons, and content/full games, the PS4 life-to-date spend is $580 while PS5 players average $731.

                              <span>Netflix has announced a partnership with Mojang Studios to create a new animated series based on Minecraft. The news comes as part of a celebration of Minecraft’s 15th anniversary.
WildBrain, the studio behind other Netflix shows such as Sonic Prime, Ninjago: Dragons Rising, and Carmen Sandiego, is developing this CG-animated Minecraft show. Plot details are nonexistent, but a press release states the series will be &quot;showing the world of Minecraft in a new light&quot; and feature an original story with new characters.


This won&#x27;t be the only on-screen adaptation of the best-selling video game of all time. A live-action Minecraft movie is currently in production, with Jack Black confirmed to star as Steve.  
The Minecraft show, whatever it winds up being titled, has no premiere date. In the meantime, be sure to catch up on the other video game adaptations Netflix has on the way, including the first teaser for Season 4 of The Witcher (now starring Liam Hemsworth), the first trailer for Arcane Season 2, and the first look at the animated Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft starring Hayley Atwell.</span>

                              <span>Reddit is not required to hand over to filmmakers the IP-addresses of several Redditors who made piracy-related comments. A California federal court denied the filmmakers&#x27; request for a &#x27;de novo&#x27; review, after turning down their initial request in February. While this is bad news for the movie companies, a viable alternative appeared recently.

My personal reputation is great only among people who love mushrooms and hate deer.

I’ve played it, and I feel must apologise, Mr. Knight. I still think it&#x27;s a silly name, but with frantic flowing action this immediately gratifying, you can call yourself whatever your killy little heart so desires.

                              <span>Destructive third-person action game Just Cause is getting made into a movie, produced by the men behind The Fall Guy and Nobody, according to the Hollywood Reporter. This isn&#x27;t the first time the over-the-top explode &#x27;em up has been in line to get the big screen treatment. Another version spent years in development hell until the rights lapsed. But it&#x27;s been picked up again by Universal, who are no strangers to turning video games into box office burger bucks (they did The Super Mario Bros. Movie). So, it might result in an actual movie this time.

                              <span>The demo for puzzle game Schim, in which you play as a boy and his frog that only exists in the shadows, is out now on Steam. I’ve given it a whirl, and its pretty froggin’ delightful. The game has you progress through different scenes set in a chill, colorful townscape. You can switch at any time between boy and frog. The boy can go anywhere, but is frequently blocked by environmental puzzles. The frog has the means to solve such puzzles, by hopping between shadows naturally cast by the environment. They act like little inky puddles, and simply jumping from one to the other is a rare joy.

                              <span>Understanding any given sentence in Wuthering Waves is like trying to discern sensible meaning from the back of a rain-bleached Doritos packet you found while cleaning your gutters. Last week, players of the character action gacha asked for more freedom to skip story scenes and dialogue. Having sunk a bunch of hours into the game, I can see why. The combat may be swish and the traversal across its rolling landscape flowing and carefree, but the lore-obsessed babble of its characters is mind-numbing. Wuthering Waves has been this month&#x27;s lightning rod for hype. But it&#x27;s worth dissecting what it&#x27;s actually like to play.

                              <span>Readers, I appear to have locked myself in self-referential language matrix trying to describe the feeling of playing top-down action shooter Kickback. You can only move through the recoil from shooting, you see, which means facing the opposite way to where you want to go. It’s both  very counterintuitive and very fun. To call something both counterintuitive and fun seems, well, counterintuitive. But also: fun. Which, as a concept is very fun to think about. But, also, quite counterintuitive. Writing such a incredibly redundant paragraph is quite fun, even though I’m just repeating myself. Counterintuitive, right? I’m going to try to escape this paragraph now. If I manage it, I’ll see you in the one below.

                              <span>An Activision lawsuit targeting a group of Call of Duty cheat makers has ended with a $14.5m judgment in favor of the plaintiffs. The defendants, all linked to Germany-based EngineOwning UG, initially put up a spirited defense against alleged violations of the DMCA, Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and civil RICO, among others. By last summer, all defendants had disengaged from the legal process. At the time of writing, EngineOwning is selling its latest MWIII and Warzone cheat.

Last December, CCTV footage revealed a figure in black spray-painting the words &quot;free movie&quot; time and again. The damage to the culturally significant building was meant to advertise a pirate video site.

                              <span>With an effectively infinite universe to fill in No Man’s Sky, developers Hello Games have certainly risen to the challenge of trying to fill it with as much stuff as they possibly can over the last near-decade, still managing to add major new features and modes eight years on from the sci-fi exploration game’s release. Next update Adrift is taking things right the way back, though, by emptying the expansive cosmos of almost everything except you, your ship and planets to visit.

We still don’t know what the team’s new game is called or when it might hit the road, but we have been given a few more snippets of what to expect and news on who’ll be helping pump up its tires and fill it with fuel as publisher.

Each harvest, one villager must don the ceremonial, mildly magical mask, and enter the fields alone, to gather the precious life-giving ambrosia before the beast can befoul it. For five nights you must do battle, or evade its ravenous clutches.
Those of you who have known your own Devourer are surely thinking: Only five nights per year? Luxury. Harvest Hunt is good, though.

                              <span>Many moons ago, premiere wordsman Nate Crowley reviewed shark ‘em up Maneater, decrying its incurious perpetuation of anti-shark propaganda, and calling it “an ecstatically violent simulation of being a fool&#x27;s idea of a shark.” My own frothing penchant for the plan-schemes of Warhammer’s Skaven ratboys has been documented in these pages to the point of rabidity, but I do feel broadly similarly about media that sullies rats - clean, smart and good folk that they are. Lively tactics Trash Of The Titans does not aim to emancipate its villainous vermin. But, like Warhammer, it gets a pass for its evident affection towards its antagonistic dumpster diving scuttlers. Also, it&#x27;s just plain fun.

We already knew that the developers at Intercept Games would be losing their jobs thanks to a closure announcement from Washington State. Until remarks from Strauss Zelnick, the CEO of Take-Two Interactive, muddied the waters. Zelnick refused to acknowledge that the studio was being closed when asked by a reporter, even going so far as to claim the opposite. &quot;We didn&#x27;t shutter those studios,&quot; he told IGN. But it seems clear from one producer&#x27;s testimony that Zelnick&#x27;s remarks are inaccurate.

                              <span>Mortal Kombat 1’s next superpowered guest fighter, The Boys’ Homelander, shows off his dominance in a new gameplay trailer. The less-than-heroic superhero becomes available for Kombat Pack owners on June 4 and for everyone else on June 11.
The patriotic and maniacal leader of The Seven shows no quarter to his new MK adversaries, obliterating them with an offensive style that is very reminiscent of Superman’s playstyle in the Injustice series. The trailer also shows off the new DLC Kameo fighter Ferra, the smaller, more feral half of the Ferra &amp; Torr team from Mortal Kombat X, who also joins the game sometime in June. 


Homelander joins Peacemaker, Invincible’s Omni-Man, Ermac, Quan-Chi, and the upcoming Takeda in the Year 1 DLC roster. Mortal Kombat 1 also has a story expansion on the way, but there’s still no word on what that will entail or when it will arrive.

XDefiant’s core modes offer temporarily fun stabs at the competitive multiplayer arena shooter, but Ubisoft’s latest attempt at carving out a slice of the lucrative esports pie feels half-baked. Core modes like its practice mode and ranked queue are gated off by construction tape at the time of writing. This leaves a bland battle pass with head-scratching progression decisions and standard weapon-based leveling systems as the only tangible means of rewarding you for playing the game or doing well beyond an individual match.

                              <span>Cox Communications has filed its opening brief in a new appeal of the $1 billion piracy case. A jury previously held the Internet provider liable for the music piracy activities of its subscribers. After the trial, Cox learned that the music companies &#x27;concealed&#x27; key information about &#x27;destroyed&#x27; piracy evidence; this allegedly damaged the foundation of the landmark lawsuit.

It transpires that just eight weeks after its launch early February, top tier football league Serie A filed a complaint at an Italian court accusing Cloudflare of providing &quot;services to pirates&quot; that undermine Piracy Shield. In parallel, the system is already exceeding blocking limits agreed with ISPs. Now the law needs to be changed, so domains and IPs can be unblocked to free up capacity.

                              <span>I have played many a creepy throwback game that takes inspiration from the ever inadequately named &quot;Golden&quot; (Grimy and Diseased? Cadaverous, perhaps) Age of survival horror on PS1, but it&#x27;s rare you play one that invokes the N64, and even less often that you stumble on something horror-adjacent that riffs on Star Fox 64. Ah, Star Fox! The natural companion piece for, say, Eternal Darkness or The Suffering. In fairness, I did always find those Pez dispenser dialogue animations pretty eerie.

                              <span>To kick off with some extremely half-arsed mytho-geometry, the original Frostpunk was a testament to both the design utility and the inexhaustible political symbolism of circles. When people wish to found a community of equals they commonly form a circle, with each participant visible and audible to the rest. A circle is also the best shape for defending against an engulfing ambient threat such as a global ice age, because it has no weak points, and it makes a great centrepiece for a videogame interface, a symmetrical motif that can be tuned and adorned to either suck your attention into the screen or distribute it evenly in all directions.
Created by Polish developers 11 bit, Frostpunk takes place in the middle of a circle, an Arctic crater with a huge coal generator at its heart. Your city rises in rings around that generator, each additional layer of dwellings corresponding intuitively to decreasing temperature, and the result is one of the most focused and thematically consistent specimens of its genre - a building game that feels as intimate and urgent as tending a campfire. Frostpunk 2&#x27;s new campaign mode breaks the circle open. It starts where you (hopefully) ended, with the crater now fully colonised and evolved into a glaring, blue-orange geode of high-density housing and clustered chimneys. But the view has been pulled back, and construction now unfolds along the plains and canyons beyond the crater, which consist not of circles but of hexagons - another UI designer&#x27;s favourite - on which you&#x27;ll plot out upgradeable districts rather than assembling individual buildings.

                              <span>The first scene in RPS Game Club pick Deathbulge: Battle Of The Bands - a genuinely funny and innovative riff on turn-based RPGs -  sees candyfloss n’ superglue-haired guitarist Faye frantically search for her missing guitar as the crowd for the titular battle grow impatient. You’ll quickly realise this a school-with-no-trousers-esque dream sequence, but the matted mess of thick black cables that carpet this dingy side-stage is painfully accurate. Pissing around with gear is roughly 70% of the band experience, in my limited experience of being in bands. This probably changes when you’ve got roadies or dedicated tech people, but we did not, because we were skint. And also terrible. Several hours of Deathbulge has brought me more joy than several years of being in actual bands. I had some isolated good times in some of those bands, but I’m having a very good time with Deathbulge.

                              <span>A whopping 1000 corpses have been found in our ongoing investigation into Anthology of the Killer, Rock Paper Shotgun can reveal. The bodies were discovered in the aforementioned murder mystery &quot;video game&quot;, which is out now on itch.io. Following our previous reports we can confirm that exposure to the game&#x27;s crime-infested city can cause severe disorientation, confusion, uncontrolled fits of laughter, and moderate enlightenment. The streets here are so dense with crime that entire apartment blocks must shutter at night. When Rock Paper Shotgun reported the 1000 corpses to detectives, we were told this was &quot;normal&quot; and &quot;appropriate&quot;.

Sounds like a solid confirmation from me, though Microsoft and Activision have yet to start bellowing the news from any of Call of Duty’s official pulpits.

The claim was casually corroborated by trustworthy sort Andy Robinson of VGC. Note the wording here, which suggests a bundle package of sorts, similar to the rumoured original plan for the remakes of Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil 3.

                              <span>At intervals in our relentless battles with the Maw, we lose people. Sometimes, it&#x27;s because those people have succeeded in levelling up out of games journalism, or found their way into another echelon of the craft.

                              <span>It’s been three years to the day since we learned that Square Enix planned to remake Dragon Quest 3, unveiling a revamping of the seminal 1988 JRPG in Octopath Traveler’s HD-2D engine.

According to a new report, it’s subtitled The Dark Ages and we’ll get an official reveal next week.

While Swen Vincke admitted that “it would be a lie to say that we didn&#x27;t [crunch]”, he insisted that it was less than on past Larian games such as Divinity, staff were paid for the overtime and it seemingly didn’t go as far as working late nights or weekends (for the most part, anyway).

                              <span>In a year already stacking up plates of delicious indie game dishes so fast they’re toppling over and crashing onto the floor, spilling splattered food over the carpet to be hoovered up by waiting dogs/cats/raccoons/mice, Animal Well is one of the most generous helpings yet. The captivating, combat-free Metroidvania is rich with a delectable buffet of challenges, puzzles and secrets to find even once you’ve seen the credits roll.

Here’s a triumphal trailer with many a joyful image of high-density housing and locomotives in the snow.

Well, now we know that this season&#x27;s wasteland offerings take the form of a sort of Mad Max meets Fallout meets Borderlands- battle royale affair. There&#x27;s a big emphasis on deserts and vehicles, basically, with highlights including: mechanical fists, turrets on cars, and the possibility of manning one of two War Buses that patrol the reworked map.

                              <span>Calling it now: this is the least intriguing article you will read about 11 bit&#x27;s The Alters, a blend of Danny Boyle&#x27;s Sunshine and Duncan Jones&#x27;s Moon in which (deep breath) you are a marooned space engineer who must spawn different versions of himself by means of backstory-branching gadgetry in order to operate an enormous, rolling base and escape the apocalyptic rays of the local sun. 


We&#x27;re not going to talk about any of that hoity-toity quantum wheeling-and-dealing in this piece, however. We&#x27;re going to talk about the fact that the opening stretch reminded me of Gears Of War and the many over-the-shoulder adventures it has influenced. I&#x27;m sorry. It&#x27;s been a complicated week involving minimal sleep, and I no longer have the grey cells for branching timelines, though they are certainly the more fascinating aspect of this game.

                              <span>In one of the better gaming trends of the last few years, we appear to have entered a golden age for booting the crud out of doors. There’s Deathbulge of course, but also the upcoming Anger Foot, Abiotic Factor, and a load more I’m sure. There was also literally Door Kickers, but that was ages ago. Anyway, the latest game to put a hinge-disrespecting protagonist front and center is also my current obsession: the excellent Post Void/Hotline Miami-type beat, Mullet Mad Jack. It’s a very fast, very silly FPS about shooting robot billionaires that takes its aesthetic from 80’s anime and PC-98 games. I’m not sure what else you need, honestly.

                              <span>I cannot compare my experience of writing a review for The Splintered Sea, the first paid expansion for dastardly clever physics puzzle builder Besiege, to that of a journaling sailor facing lethal storms on the horizon. Still, if we take for granted the idea that a review is only really valuable as an insight into the experience of the player: I haven’t been feeling especially great this week. That in mind: Splintered Sea is more Besiege, thoughtfully applied to its already expansive toolkit. More importantly, it&#x27;s currently bringing me deep and deeply needed moments of untainted, childlike, vaguely-Orkish joy.
