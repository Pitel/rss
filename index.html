                    <span>Music games can provide some of the most fun in all of gaming because music is something everyone can enjoy. Add in gameplay mechanics like puzzles, shooting, dancing, or the use of electric instruments that can be played with a group of friends, and you’ve got a genre that easily becomes a house favorite. While the music genre is not as clear-cut as it used to be – remember when it was basically “Do you want to play Guitar Hero or Rock Band?” – there are many more creative renditions of these experiences, so the scene has never been better than now. However, with the abundance of options now afforded to fans of music games, picking out the one to play can be tough. This list has you covered, though. Here are ten great music games – listed in no particular order – you’ll have a great time …</span>

                    <span>It&#x27;s always awesome when you can see your favorite pokémon tagging alongside you in the well-loved RPG. But now, some fans can recreate that feeling in real life with the new Pokémon Collection from Secretlab. The gaming chair company has given its Titan Evo 2022 Series the very best makeover, with the ergonomic seats sporting two of the franchise&#x27;s most recognized mascots. One of the offerings features an adorable image of Pikachu, with yellow lettering and accents to match. The other orange-and-blue-laced option in this fresh collection is packing a Zard. Both chairs come with a pair of pokéballs stitched into the upper left corner, the creatures&#x27; pokédex number in the right, and a handful of themed, custom stitching throughout. 
But before you go off to try and snag one of these functional gaming collectibles, we have good and bad news. The bad? Secretlab&#x27;s collection is only available in Japan right now while supplies last. So, it would seem like anyone outside that country is out of luck for now. However, there is a glimmer of hope as the manufacturer has provided a link on its website that will allow you to &quot;register interest.&quot; We hope this means that – given enough people click the link and provide their email – Secretlab will consider selling these unique products around the globe. So if you&#x27;d like to get more news on the chairs and hopefully bring the Kanto-region pokémon to your region, check out the collection&#x27;s official website.

                    <span>The Xbox-published title that aims to simulate life on the high seas has sailed past another milestone and is giving away a special gift to mark the occasion. Sea of Thieves has sold five million copies on Steam, and it’s heading into the holiday season full of festive cheer, as well as a little bit of a pirate’s favorite beverage. If you want to join in, the developers at Rare suggest you play the game now through the middle of next week to snap up a special emote. The team announced this achievement on the game’s official blog, along with the news that over 25 million players have dived into Sea of Thieves to hunt down treasure, explore the oceans, and live out the life of a scallywag with their friends.

                    <span>A new year, a new slew of video game heroes and villains. This year had a lot of great stand-outs – from characters we met for the first time to old favorites. Narrowing down our favorites wasn&#x27;t easy, but after much deliberation, here are our top picks for the best heroes and villains of 2021. 
Please note: Neither list is ordered, so just because one character comes before or after another doesn&#x27;t mean we consider them better or worse in any way. 
HEROES
Ethan Winters – Resident Evil Village
The best horror protagonists are relatable; people who find their circumstances both as terrifying and hard-to-believe as we would in the same situation. This is what makes Ethan Winters such a good lead in the two Resident Evil games he&#x27;s starred in – Resident Evil 7: Biohazard and this year&#x27;s excel…</span>

                    <span>New year, new Games with Gold lineup, and this upcoming month&#x27;s titles all seem to have a theme. We are looking forward and backward with a slew of games that run the gamut from ultra-futuristic to retro-futuristic. Come January, Xbox owners with Xbox Live Gold membership or that subscribe to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate will be able to grab the titles listed below for free:
NeuroVoider: Available January 1 to 31
Aground: Available January 16 to February 15
Radiant Silvergun: Available January 1 to 15
Space Invaders Infinity Gene: Available January 16 to 31
As usual, the games are only available for a limited time, so make sure you catch anything you are interested in before it leaves the service. The first up on the list is NeuroVoider, a twin-shooter RPG that sets waves of robotic baddies after you. You&#x27;ll have to take each of them down to end the neverending war that&#x27;s been tearing up the cyber futuristic world. Coming in the same window as NeuroVoider during the first half of the month is Radiant Silvergun. The vertical scrolling shoot &#x27;em up was first released in 1998 but has been shined up for modern players.
In the back half of the month, players will be able to pick up Aground and Space Invaders Infinity Gene. The second title, a fresh twist on the well-known Space Invaders franchise, is only available until the end of January, so pick it up as soon as you can. However, Aground, a game focused on building and crafting set amongst the stars, will be available until the middle of February. 
While the end of the year is fast approaching, we still have a little bit more time left in December. So, if you have not picked up last month&#x27;s Games with Gold, you can pick those up now. This month&#x27;s free titles included The Escapists 2, Tropico 5: Penultimate Edition, Orcs Must Die, and Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet. There are some good titles in there, so don&#x27;t miss out if you have Xbox Live Gold or Xbox Game Pass Ultimate.
What do you think about 2022&#x27;s opening Games with Gold? Let us know in the comments below.</span>

Happy holidays from The Game Informer Show! We&#x27;re bringing the holiday cheer and taking a deep dive into everything we learned about Horizon Forbidden West as part of our latest cover trip.

The new Uncharted film is only months away and we just got a brand new trailer to pick apart. Much of the footage isn&#x27;t new, following the first trailer that was released back in October pretty closely. However, this new look at the upcoming adaptation does give us a few fresh tidbits, including a little more backstory on Moncada, the movie&#x27;s antagonist played by Antonio Banderas. It seems, his family did more than search for the unbelievable fortune central to the story, they found it but were then betrayed. We&#x27;ll have to see how this ties into Nathan Drake (played by Tom Holland) and Victor &quot;Sully&quot; Sullivan&#x27;s (played by Mark Wahlberg) plans to recover the glittering treasure. 
One of the biggest reveals of the trailer came at the end when we get our first glimpse of Sully in the film with his characteristic mustache. In the games, Sully&#x27;s facial hair is one of his defining features, and one that Uncharted fans immediately noticed was missing in early character reveals. While it felt strange to see the mentor without it, the change made some sense considering this movie takes place before the Naughty Dog series. However, it looks like Sully won&#x27;t stay clean-shaven throughout the whole film, and you can check out the reveal, along with the rest of the new details in the trailer above. 
Sony Entertainment Picture&#x27;s Uncharted will release in theatres on February 18. Recent posters found on Fandango showcase some pirate-worthy imagery, of which we see more in today&#x27;s trailer. This led some to believe that the upcoming movie may have ties to Uncharted 4: A Theif&#x27;s End, which features a graveyard of similar-looking vessels. However, it&#x27;s hard to tell exactly what connections we will see between the games and the upcoming adaptation. There&#x27;s only two more months until we find out.</span>

                    <span>Every long-running series has its turning points, times that demand reinvigoration and forward-thinking. Tales of Arise was Bandai Namco’s opportunity to enact meaningful change and enter a new console generation soaring. The developers didn’t let the opportunity pass by, rising to the challenge and breaking franchise sales records in the process. Tales of Arise took interesting risks and made smart improvements, resulting in a fantastic RPG full of endearing characters, intense battles, and rewarding exploration.
In its 26-year run, the Tales series has always had a passionate fanbase, but Tales of Arise helped expand the franchise’s reach and elevate its established formula to make it one of the best entries in years. While retaining the series’ essence, Bandai Namco brought in a new visual style, more strategic combat, and a mature story about warring nations. The latter especially made its mark for how it tackled socio-political issues, like racism, authoritarianism, and mental illness. Read more...</span>

                    <span>It&#x27;s been just around two years since Telltale Games announced its return. Populated by some of the former studio&#x27;s staff and led by a new team, the company announced a follow-up to The Wolf Among Us during The Game Awards 2019. Then things seemed to go quiet, leading many to speculate on how the newly reformed studio was doing. However, Telltale has recently been very vocal about the status of its projects and the studio itself. This most recent post from Telltale&#x27;s official Twitter account runs down a list of the studio&#x27;s recent milestones and what it hopes to achieve in the near future. It begins, &quot;Telltale is back.&quot; Then the post moves on to assure readers that the company, while trying to stay true to the Telltale legacy, is changing things up and steering clear of the problems that plagued the original studio.
Perhaps the most eye-catching part of the message comes near the end, in the section detailing what comes next. It seems like we will be hearing more about The Wolf Among Us 2 soon. As you can read below, the post states the team will be ready to reveal more news &quot;early next year when we can go deeper into things.&quot;
While we are excited to hear news about Telltale&#x27;s upcoming sequel, the studio has more projects on the horizon. Announced just weeks ago at The Game Awards, The Expanse: A Telltale Series will be an adaptation of the popular Amazon TV show and is being co-developed with Life is Strange: True Colors studio Deck Nine. The two developers have a strong storytelling history, giving us a lot to look forward to in the title.</span>

                    <span>I’ve been pretty open about this recently, but a few years ago, there was a time when I was feeling overwhelmingly lonely. My days at work were mostly spent alone in a dark projection booth above a corporate auditorium. To spice up my evenings and force some human interaction on myself, I started playing Magic: The Gathering at a local game shop. I spent multiple days a week there, learning how to draft, build decks, and catch onto the lingo and language of the game. Slowly, I incorporated myself into the small group of regulars, and day by day, I felt less alone.
While shuffling decks and slinging spells against these new acquaintances, I noticed shared mannerisms and social archetypes people took on within my little corner of the Magic community. Let me tell you how pleasantly surprised …</span>

                    <span>Money is such a burden, isn&#x27;t it.
So. It&#x27;s Christmas or your birthday or some other gift-giving holiday, and you&#x27;ve just been presented with a shiny piece of plastic with Mario and a number on it. Alternatively, an alphanumeric code has been printed or scrawled in a card. You ask your parents/significant other/gift-giving human what you&#x27;re supposed to do with this, and they reply, &quot;it&#x27;s a gift card, you numpty.&quot;
Yes, this little piece of Nintendo-endorsed material is pretend money, and you can use it to buy real things on the Nintendo Switch eShop!

Sneaking onto the NA eShop with a subterfuge uncharacteristic of the gun-toting Umbra Witch, the Bayonetta and Bayonetta 2 Digital Bundle is a compilation of her first two games and it&#x27;s available now on the US Switch eShop.
For the princely sum of $59.98, you can download this bundle featuring Bayonetta and Bayonetta 2 and save $20 compared to buying the pair separately at full price — the original game goes for $29.99 while the sequel costs $49.99.

The DLC tracks and characters that released for the original Mario Kart 8 on Wii U (and came included as part of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe) were pretty special, giving kart racers the chance to burn around circuits based on other series outside the Mario games for the first time. F-Zero&#x27;s Mute City and Zelda&#x27;s Hyrule Castle were both highlights, and the Animal Crossing circuit was another fine addition. Only Nintendo knows why we didn&#x27;t get Kirby or Pikmin or Metroid themed circuits. Gotta leave something for Mario Kart 9, we suppose.
One fan of both games has taken it upon themselves to recreate the Animal Crossing-themed circuit from MK8 on their New Horizons island, complete with cars, coins, boost pads, and more.

Star Wars character Boba Fett – who is about to get his own series on Disney+ – is coming to Fortnite tomorrow as part of Season 3.
Bounty hunter Fett is a key character in the wider Star Wars universe, having appeared in both the original trilogy and the prequels. He also turns up in the Disney+ series The Mandalorian, and The Book of Boba Fett – which airs on 29th December 2021 – is a spin-off from that series that focuses solely on the character, played by Temuera Morrison.

There are few things more personal than art. That is, the art produced by an artist. Obviously. Even in its most commercial, populist form — including when it’s a small part of a much larger product — the work of an individual artist is ultimately recognisable, whether from obvious sweeping traits or tiny little consistencies that come to define them. Chicory: A Colorful Tale’s extremely difficult job is to translate that sense of ownership, the pocket creative universe of the artist, into… well… a video game. It’s not the most efficient medium for this kind of individuality, for creating and owning something one-of-a-kind, but Chicory – against all odds – manages to pull it off. Surely, though, it can’t also be a charming adventure game on top of a paean to, and canvas for, creativity? It can! It is!!
You play as a little dog creature who happens to be gainfully employed as the janitor of the elusive Wielder, they who, er, wield a magic paintbrush which you’ll be unsurprised to learn ends up in your own hands. One day, the present Wielder – the titular Chicory – appears to have gone missing and left the Brush behind. More pressingly, indeed, all the colour in the world appears to have vanished. Your player character, Double Sausage and Egg McMuffin (they’re actually named after your favourite food, so this handle will vary), takes up the Brush and sets out into the world of Picnic to get to the bottom of what’s going on.

Developer Frogwares has put out a festive tweet with a none-too-subtle clue that one of its most celebrated games may be headed to Switch.
The studio — famous for its long line of Sherlock Holmes mystery games, and most recently for The Sinking City — left a hint in a festive tweet (primarily promoting the non-Switch title Sherlock Holmes: Chapter One) that suggests Sherlock Holmes: Crimes &amp; Punishments may be getting the Switch port treatment in the near future.

There&#x27;s a big deck-building element to the game, with players using cards to summon units – which come in close, medium, and long-range types – and activate skills.

At &#x27;The Game Awards&#x27; earlier this month, we got our first proper trailer for Sonic&#x27;s second movie outing featuring Knuckles, Tails, Dr. Robotnik, and of course the blue blur.
If that wasn&#x27;t already enough to get you excited for the Sonic sequel when it arrives in cinemas next April, perhaps Paramount Picture&#x27;s latest Matrix-inspired Sonic the Hedgehog 2 movie commercial will help - encouraging fans to pick the &quot;Red Quill or Blue Quill&quot;, aka Knuckles or Sonic.

                    <span>But nothing is in development right now.
Back in November, Square Enix revealed NEO: The World Ends With You didn&#x27;t meet the company&#x27;s early sales expectations.
While it might not seem like a bright outlook for the future of the series, producer Tomohiko Hirano recently told Nintendo Life that another entry could happen with enough fan support.

If you&#x27;re staring baffled at an endless list of innumerable deals, you could use some help. Honestly, most of our Steam Autumn Sale recommendations still stand, but the few of us in the RPS treehouse who haven&#x27;t already clocked off for the Christmas holiday do have some fresh picks for you too.

There&#x27;s some Christmassy-ness flowing in to tide me over, thanks to the mini-Christmas tree in my room. Every year it&#x27;s popped on the wardrobe alongside an honorary Lynx Africa. They share the same festive colours, after all.
Having pondered my tree for a bit, I thought about trees in games and how they make for good side quests. Now join me by the bark, as I examine why this might be the case in a roundabout manner.

                    <span>When I was younger I watched a nature documentary narrated by David Attenborough (I realise that doesn&#x27;t narrow it down) and in this nature documentary David told me about a cave. It is a very big cave, and every night a huge colony of bats come screaming out of the entrance. They spend the day clinging to the ceiling of this big cave, and all their bat poo falls down and has become a towering heap carpeting the floor.
But then David said look, the carpet is moving. And it turns out that the whole bottom of the cave is covered in cockroaches and giant centipedes. And if ever a small baby bat or an old injured bat falls, it is eaten alive by this hoard of chittering insects. This nature documentary haunted me, for it was the worst thing I could imagine happening.
Anyway, Nate has been to that cave and he&#x27;s going to tell us all about it for this episode of our supporters only podcast, The Nate Files. Thanks for being a supporter, pals!

                    <span>It&#x27;s been a busy, kind of mixed year for strategy games. Ever a broad church, 2021&#x27;s seen enough releases to keep ten of me busy, from the easy-going Legion War to the month-consuming Shadow Empire. I don&#x27;t know about you, but my personal &quot;to play&quot; list is out of control.
And yet, while we&#x27;ve had plenty to enjoy this year, it&#x27;s felt like a period of build-up to something bigger. I&#x27;m not one for looking forward. If a game&#x27;s not out yet it tends to disappear from my mind, making room for a hundred other recent releases in this age of plenty. That I&#x27;ve less interest in looking back over this year than I do pondering the next suggests that maybe we&#x27;re in for something special in the coming twelve months. Or perhaps it&#x27;s just been a rough one and I&#x27;m very sleep deprived and don&#x27;t want to think about 2021. Either way, let&#x27;s have a look at what&#x27;s in store for strategy fans in 2022, yeah?

Among these are Perfect World, the publishers of Star Trek Online and Torchlight, and the studio behind Scribblenauts Showdown, Shiver Entertainment. They&#x27;re also going transmedia, buying comics and TV company Dark Horse as well as an animation company and a video-on-demand network. Now they just need to get into food and housing, then our dystopian dreams of one corp owning our entire lives can come true.

                    <span>A recent round of BIOS updates for Dell and Alienware systems has turned out to be something of a bad batch. As first spotted by Bleeding Computer, multiple owners of Dell-made PCs – including the Alienware Aurora R8 and Inspiron 5680 gaming desktops, as well as the Latitude 5320 and 5520 business laptops – started developing big problems after installing the new BIOS versions. Failed boots, mainly, which of course makes it harder to apply potential fixes.

There are plenty of fantastic fighting games out there, both old and new. As Arc System Works continues to update its older Guilty Gear games with rollback netcode, those fighters are given new life. However, is there room for another fighter with recent entries in the genre, such as Guity Gear Strive, and others on the horizon like SNK&#x27;s King of Fighters XV? After going hands-on with the DNF Duel beta over the past weekend, Game Informer editor John Carson thinks so. 
Game Informer editor and today&#x27;s host, Wesley LeBlanc, is joined by John, AKA The King of Late Night, AKA possibly the greatest fighting game player in the world, to discuss the recent beta test. The two also talk about what makes DNF Duel different in a busy genre, where its inspirations lie, and most importantly, how it feels to play. 
In this New Gameplay Today, we also have 15 minutes of action-packed DNF Duel Beta gameplay on top of the discussion topics above. Thanks for watching, and be sure to let us know what you think of this upcoming fighting game from Eighting and Arc System Works.</span>

                    <span>Each week, Hasbro unveils new Star Wars action figures at Bring Home the Bounty. This week&#x27;s reveal focuses its sights on Electronic Arts&#x27; Star Wars Battlefront II video game from 2017. Hasbro is bringing four new action figures from the game to market. All four are Clone Troopers decked out in some of the game&#x27;s unique armor coloring. Three of the figures fall into the 3 and 3/4-scale Vintage Collection, with the final one joining the Gaming Greats Black Series line.
The latter figure is the Umbra Operative Arc Trooper with a cool black and orange coloring. This clone stands at roughly six inches in height and comes with two pistols. It will be sold exclusively at GameStop with an expected ship date next April.

                    <span>Brandon Sanderson, the famed author behind fantasy series Mistborn and The Stormlight Archive series, has revealed he’s working on a video game. 
This news comes by way of a recent blog post he made titled “State of the Sanderson 2021,” which, like previous “State of” posts made by the author, details what he has going on in his career. He mentions feature films, TV series, and more, but he also quickly divulges that he’s been working on a game for a while and we might be seeing it soon. 
“I’ve been working on a video game for several years, and I suspect it will be announced this year,” Sanderson writes. “So commence speculation.” 
Sanderson’s post includes a note that says the game is not based on one of his properties and is instead something new he built with the team he’s working with on this project. He also said that people will recognize the company developing the game but playfully suggests it&#x27;s “probably not the one you’re thinking of right now,” nor is it “that other one either.” 
And that’s all Sanderson had to say about this game. Sanderson entering the video game scene would be quite a treat for fans of the author, whose only other experience in games is minimal. He wrote a novella e-book in 2011 for Epic Games Infinity Blade series called “Infinity Blade: Awakening.” (Editor&#x27;s note: he has also worked on some fiction for Magic: The Gathering. – JC) However, as the author notes that this game won’t be based on one of his own series, those holding out for a Mistborn RPG will have to continue their wait. 
Perhaps this development will go so well that Sanderson decides to greenlight a Mistborn game of some kind. While not a full game, you can technically get a taste of Mistborn in the form of a game by way of Fortnite, which recently sold a skin based on Kelsier. Be sure to check out Sanderson’s entire “State of” post for more information about what the author is up to.

                    <span>In celebration of our Horizon Forbidden West cover story, which digital subscribers read now, we&#x27;re letting you get a look at the new screens Guerrilla Games shared with us for the story. These shots were provided exclusively to Game Informer for our extensive 12-page feature to highlight certain aspects we discussed.
For some context for the images below, they mostly feature a new area called the Daunt, which is a canyon at the eastern edge of Sundom (Carja territory). This new settlement acts as an onboarding area to get players up to speed with the game’s new mechanics. It is Aloy&#x27;s last stop before she heads to the Forbidden West. These screens also provide a view of a market and tavern to show off the more lively locales.
Lastly, there&#x27;s a look at a new machine called the Burrower, which is a successor to Horizon Zero Dawn&#x27;s Watcher. This common recon machine can tunnel underground and resurface in unexpected locations. When it senses danger, it emits a high-pitched sound to call allies and stun enemies.  According to game director Mathijs de Jonge: &quot;We wanted to add even more character and locomotion to the machines in Horizon Forbidden West, so the Burrowers are very similar to otters or weasels: flexible, quick, and pretty ferocious!&quot;

                    <span>The upcoming immersive sim western from former Dishonored and Prey devs, Weird West, has been delayed. 
Previously due out on January 11, 2022, on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC, Weird West will now hit those platforms a little over two months later on March 31, 2022. As for why, the team at Wolfeye Studios needs more time to make it as great as it can be.

“Weird West is an impressively deep mix of action RPG and immersive sim elements built on the Wolfeye team’s experience with Dishonored and Prey,” a press release about the announcement reads. “Early feedback is fantastic but, as is the case with any immersive sim, there are a lot of variables that can lead to unintended consequences. More time is needed to deliver an experience that the community expects from Wolfeye and Devovler. The team understands this might be a disappointment to folks, but want to sure that the game they’ve worked on for years is launched in the best form possible.” 
Weird West was first announced during The Game Awards 2019 and it promised a very weird west indeed, complete with gunslingers and fantastical creatures. Two years later, one Game Informer editor went hands on with it and determined that Weird West is a wild west worth exploring.

                    <span>Ubisoft, the company behind franchises like Assassin’s Creed and Far Cry, first broached the topic of NFTs back in early November, revealing plans to one day implement them into its games and also develop blockchain games. We learned a month later – this month – that Ubisoft’s comments in November were less a broach of NFTs and more preparation for a reveal of its NFT-based platform called Ubisoft Quartz. 
Quartz is now live as a beta where players can earn NFT cosmetic items to use in Ghost Recon Breakpoint. However, the announcement and reveal of Quartz was met with criticism, with many calling for Ubisoft to back off the idea of NFTs in its games. A report from Eurogamer reveals that Quartz Digit recipients have sold a total of just 15 of these NFTs, likely a number much smaller than Ub…</span>

                    <span>Hot on the heels of Spider-Man: No Way Home, which hit theaters one week ago, Marvel Studios has released a teaser for its highly anticipated Doctor Strange sequel, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness. 
Spoilers for No Way Home below…
Okay so just in case you missed that nice spoiler warning up above, I figured I’d write some additional sentences here for those whose eyes might have wandered down just a bit. I&#x27;m going to write just one more sentence for those wandering eyes because I care about you and don&#x27;t want you to get spoiled of something you don&#x27;t want to be spoiled on. 
Alrighty, into the multiverse below. 
If you’ve seen even just one of the many trailers for No Way Home, you know it centers around a Doctor Strange-cast spell gone wrong and said spell opens up the multiver…</span>

                    <span>The missions change. They always do. While that’s true, what’s at the heart of the Halo franchise does not change – it’s Master Chief, Cortana, some punchy guns that don’t get old, and a soundtrack that never lets up. Throughout the decades, Chief and Cortana (and buddies like Buck) have found themselves on Earth, Sanghelios, hurtling through space, aboard exploding rings, and more. But no matter the locale, we were finishing the fight – even when some of those battles were more grueling than others.
Sadly, Chief was absent from the fight the Game Informer editors partook in to rank all the Halo games from worst to best. It’s important to note that we opted to rank only the Xbox console FPS Halo games, which means you won’t find mobile, arcade, or RTS spinoffs like Halo Wars or Fireteam Ra…</span>

                    <span>Halo Infinite is joining in on the winter holiday fun other live-service multiplayer games take part in each season, and similar to those, there are plenty of free rewards to earn by taking part. 
Dubbed Winter Contingency, this event began yesterday, December 21, and will run until January 4. What’s more, there are ten free rewards for all players to earn, and earning them is simple: play a match of Arena or Big Team Battle. That’s it. 
Click here to watch embedded media


“Rewards will be unlocked over time, meaning they will not all be available to grab on day one,” a Halo Waypoint blog post about the event reads. “Think of Winter Contingency like your in-game Halo advent calendar: you’ll unlock one reward each day, with the event running through the morning of January 4, 2022. To be clear: While the daily rewards conclude on December 30, what this means is you’ll have several extra days to catch up on any items that you may have missed.”
For example, if you didn’t play a match yesterday, you’re one day behind, but because the event lasts until January 4, you’ll earn your final reward on December 31 (assuming you play a match every day in between now and then). 
Speaking of rewards here’s what you can expect: 
Day 1: Wild Justice nameplate
Day 2: Peppermint Laughter armor coating
Day 3: UA/Tatius shoulder left pad
Day 4: UA/Tatius shoulder right pad
Day 5: Peppermint Laughter MA40 Assault Rifle weapon coating
Day 6: Snowmageddon backdrop
Day 7: Navlogcom nameplat
Day 8: Peppermint Laughter MK50 Sidekick weapon coating
Day 9: Myesel ammo pouch
Day 10: Sunset Contessa armor coating
If you’ve already nabbed your daily reward today and need something to do, check out the official Game Informer Halo Infinite review. Then, give our breakdown of everything available in the Halo Infinite shop this week (including a very Iron Man-esque armor coating and cat ears) a look.

                    <span>The third and final pair of Xbox 20th Anniversary shoes were unveiled yesterday, and as any sneakerhead might guess, they sold out immediately. 
Priced at $140, the Adidas Forum Tech Boost sneakers sold out immediately, but it looks like more could be on the way. On the official Adidas storefront page for the shoes, you can sign up for email notification of future drops. Of course, it could just be referencing any incoming future drops, but we’re hoping it means more of these Boosts are on the way because they look great.

                    <span>Rockstar Games is once again treating PC gamers to something a little extra by giving out a free game with the purchase of Theft Auto: The Trilogy – Definitive Edition.  
As an incentive to buy the collection through Rockstar&#x27;s store on PC, you&#x27;ll be able to redeem an additional free Rockstar game to add to your digital collection. That&#x27;s on top of the advertised 20% discount and the free original versions of the trio of games that were brought back as a make-good for performance issues at launch.
Which games can you snag for free? It&#x27;s, of course, a selection of titles developed by Rockstar, but there are some great options to choose from. However, you only get one, so choose carefully. Here&#x27;s the list:
Grand Theft Auto V: Premium Edition
Grand Theft Auto IV: Complete Edition
Max Payne 3
L.A. Noire
Bully: Scholarship Edition
If you already own those games through Rockstar&#x27;s launcher, you won&#x27;t be able to redeem a second copy. But, there are a couple of alternatives, like a Great White Shark Cash Card for GTA Online or 55 Gold Bars for Red Dead Online.
You can find the holiday deal on Rockstar&#x27;s site, which will be available through January 6, 2022. Unfortunately, the deal is only available through Rockstar&#x27;s storefront, and there aren&#x27;t any similar deals extended to console players.
Will this incentive be enough to get you to pick up the remastered trilogy on PC? Let us know what you think in the comments.</span>

                    <span>A game about time deserves to go down in history.
Our very own Zion Grassl recently had the privilege of finishing Chrono Trigger for the very first time, and even 26 years after release he&#x27;s utterly blown away. To celebrate this accomplishment Zion, Jon and special guest Kevin Kenson decided to sit down and praise the game for over an hour. And trust us, there&#x27;s a lot more we could have said.
However speaking the good word of this classic is about all we can do as there are very few ways for gamers to play this pivotal RPG for themselves. In 26 years there have only ever been 4 releases; Super Nintendo (which skipped Europe), PlayStation (also skipped Europe), Nintendo DS &amp; the initially controversial but largely remedied Steam release. If you primarily play on console, there&#x27;s a high chance you&#x27;ve never had the opportunity to buy Chrono Trigger and that should frankly be a crime.

The second is the arrival of Steam&#x27;s Winter Sale. Blissfully, we can now tick both of these objectives off our to-do list, as Valve have finally unleashed their flurry of seasonal deals. Between now and January 5th, thousands of games will be discounted across Steam, and you&#x27;ll also be able to claim a free sticker every day as well, for those of you who enjoy that sort of thing.

                    <span>It struck me recently that I’ve not played as much of Halo Infinite’s multiplayer as I thought I would. I envisaged myself wiling away most evenings with my mates, playing Oddball and Slayer and laughing like someone from those video game adverts, swaying violently with a controller in hand.
I now know the reason why and I hate to admit it. Infinite doesn’t have a battle royale mode, which I&#x27;ve come to realise is the perfect FPS template for gaming with my mates. Something about it just works, you know? Listen, let me explain.

                    <span>I know almost nothing about Alfred Hitchcock. He’s the kind of archetypal director whose work I’ve been exposed to in bits and pieces without ever actually sitting down to watch one of his films in full. All of that is to say that, upon starting Alfred Hitchcock - Vertigo the game, I was in no position to judge whether it was a faithful adaptation of the film or to recognize all but the most obvious illusions to Hitchcock’s body of work (look, birds!). That’s okay, though, because as it turns out, Vertigo is an original story based on a collage of Hitchcockian concepts, not a direct adaption of the 1958 film by the same name.
Vertigo the game follows author Ed Miller as he grapples with a debilitating case of vertigo–a condition that leaves him unable to stand as the world appears to spin around him–and paralyzing guilt over the death of his daughter and her mother, Faye, after their car falls off a bridge into a ravine below. With Ed bed ridden, it’s up to Dr. Julia Lomas, psychologist and psychiatrist, and Sheriff Nick Reyes to unravel the mystery of what really happened, and whether Faye and his daughter even exist. My thoughts on how Vertigo goes about telling this story are... complicated.

                    <span>Final Fantasy XIV players haven’t had it easy these last few weeks. The sheer success of its Endwalker expansion resulted in lengthy login queues and server errors. It’s become so popular that Square Enix have temporarily stopped selling the game, taking its Starter and Complete Editions off sale. All the while, some low-poly grapes stayed static in the breeze. Jagged, delicious, minding their own business. Until their blockiness was papped and thrust into the public eye. Memes ensued and the grapes became the talk of the town, so much so that they’ve been smoothed out in the latest patch, much to everyone’s dismay.

I was with three friends, and we&#x27;d been adventuring together for years at this point - two of us were lovers, and yet a third had made a strange pact with a wolf God. We could do anything together, we four. And then we stumbled upon this door...

                    <span>Book Of Travels is what developers Might And Delight call a TMORPG - a &quot;tiny&quot; multiplayer online role playing game, as opposed to a &quot;massive&quot; one. It&#x27;s a gorgeous-looking adventure that came out in early access back in October, but unfortunately the launch didn&#x27;t go as well as the devs had hoped it would. Yesterday, they announced that they&#x27;ve had to lay off around 25 employees to keep the studio going. They add that development will continue, albeit at an understandably slower pace.

                    <span>The Assassin’s Creed series debuted in 2007, and since then, the series has become a fixture in the gaming landscape. It received reliable annual installments (or more!) for several years; that cadence has relented a bit now, but the franchise&#x27;s long history has certainly left us with no shortage of Assassin’s Creed games to enjoy. But how do they stack up against each other?
 We originally published a version of this list back in 2015, but more Assassin&#x27;s Creed games have released now, and some of our perspectives have shifted. So we are taking another look at the titles in the whole main series (no spin-offs or side-stories) and ranking them, highlighting the best moments and acknowledging the weaknesses in each.

                    <span>Halo Infinite&#x27;s shop updates every Tuesday at 10 a.m. PT with new items that players can purchase with credits. Since the launch of the free-to-play multiplayer component, 343 Industries has done a nice job of offering up colorful items for players to purchase. The latest rotation brings a bundle that alienates dog lovers but should make cat enthusiasts feel right at home.
This week&#x27;s pricey 2,000 credit bundle is called Fire and Frost and gives your Spartan the red-and-gold coloring of Iron Man. To use this armor coating you need the Yoroi and Mark V armor core. The bundle also comes with the Trash Removal stance, and Tempest of Blades emblem, nameplate, and weapon decal.
The most comical item this week is the Cat Lovers bundle that gives your Spartan helmet cat ears. You also get a faded blush armor coloring and a Tabby charm for your weapons. If you just want to look like a cat yet want to show off your love of food through the charm, the Chow Down bundle gives you a pizza slice charm, a bacon charm, and a Second Breakfast emblem, nameplate, and weapon decal.
For those of you seeking more realism, the Maltese Mayhem Weapon Set offers a variety of weapon models, such as the Critpoint Shroud design for the MK50 Sidekick. You also unlock the Maltese Mayhem weapon coloring.</span>

Axios’ report about this exodus says colleagues across the company refer to what’s happening as “the great exodus” and “the cut artery.” Those colleagues describe this exodus happening at Ubisoft as something they’ve never seen before, citing reasons such as low pay, competitive opportunities, frustration at the company’s creative direction as of late, and the recent scandals surrounding the video game development and publishing company. 
The report also says that “at least five of the top 25-credited people from the company’s biggest 2021 game, Far Cry 6, [are] already gone,” noting that on the Assassin’s Creed Valhalla side of things, 12 of the top 50-credited developers from that game have departed …</span>

                    <span>Online multiplayer functionality and DLC could soon be coming to Raw Thrill’s Cruis’n Blast in a future update. 
First reported by Nintendo Life, Raw Thrills boss Eugene Jarvis recently took part in a Reddit AMA where he talked about a number of video game-related things, including the recently-released Cruis’n Blast. He said that the next goal for the team is online multiplayer.

“Online multiplayer is out next goal for Cruis’n/Switch…when we get our online multiplayer going, we’ll definitely look at bringing on some more content,” Jarvis said in the AMA. 
While not official confirmation that online multiplayer and additional content are coming to Cruis’n Blast, it’s at least nice to hear that Raw Thrills is looking into both. That’s great because one Game Informer editor who wrote up their first impressions of the arcade racer noted that it was a disappointment Cruis’n Blast didn’t feature online multiplayer. 
Elsewhere in the AMA, Jarvis said he’d love to see the original Cruis’n Nintendo 64 trilogy ported to Switch and that he’ll “talk to Miyamoto” about seeing what Raw Thrills can do. 
Only time will tell if online multiplayer and additional content like new cars and tracks make their way to Cruis’n Blast. For now, check out our thoughts on in it this episode of All Things Nintendo, which is Game Informer’s Nintendo podcast, and then read about how Cruis’n Blast is an unapologetic, enjoyable arcade racing throwback after that.

                    <span>In 2017, Guerrilla Games wowed us with a new IP that was different from anything it had ever produced. Best known for the shooter Killzone series, Guerrilla flipped the script and ventured into the open-world action/RPG genre, inviting us to a post-apocalyptic Earth where massive, animal-like machines have become a part of the ecosystem. Horizon Zero Dawn was an overwhelming success, with adrenaline-pumping battles, an awesome protagonist in headstrong Aloy, and exciting discoveries around every bend. We couldn’t wait to experience more, especially since Guerrilla had left some loose ends hanging. Thankfully, the highly anticipated sequel, Horizon Forbidden West, is just around the corner with its February 18 release date.

                    <span>We’re in Year 2 of the new-gen consoles from PlayStation and Xbox, and it’s still as tricky as ever to get your hands on one. 
This is due to several reasons, including the rise of online bots that automatically purchase these consoles, the resale market, and more, but perhaps chief among these reasons is the ongoing chip shortage. These chips are used in the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S consoles, which means PlayStation and Xbox cannot produce as many as they’d like as quickly as they’d like. Unfortunately, after AMD CEO Lisa Su said back in October that the chip shortage could last into 2022, the CEO of Intel has now said he believes it could last into 2023.

                    <span>It might be a while until we learn more about the Ghost of Tsushima movie adaptation currently in the works.
That’s because director Chad Stahelski, who’s perhaps best known for directing all three John Wick films (as well as the upcoming fourth one, too), told IGN in a new interview that the team behind it wants to do right by the game. To do that, the team is taking its time.

“We just want to do it right,” Stahelski said. “You know how video game adaptations can go. So we’re taking our time and doing it right. We’re working very closely with game developers to make sure we stick to what’s great about it.” 
IGN notes that Stahelski stated that a script is still being developed for the movie. He also said that fans of Ghost of Tsushima “would be very happy with what we’re working on,” noting that he’s played it “many times,” which is something that initially drew him to the project.
When asked if Jin Sakai English voice actor Daisuke Tsuji would be reprising his role in the film, Stahelski said, “we’ll see,” and they “haven’t gotten that far yet.” Only time will tell for now. 
For now, read about the original announcement of a Ghost of Tsushima movie and then read about how Tsuje really wants in on the film – he even said he entirely agrees to butt-nudity in it. Read our thoughts on the game in Game Informer’s Ghost of Tsushima review after that.

                    <span>The ancient Egypt of Assassin’s Creed Origins is a visually stunning place to explore, and it could soon look even better. 
That’s because Ubisoft has revealed that it’s looking into adding 60 FPS support to the Bayak-led Assassin’s Creed title. This news was announced today, December 21, which also happens to be Assassin’s Creed Day. No, it’s not an anniversary for the first Assassin’s Creed title or any title in the franchise. It’s the day of the Winter Solstice, and in Assassin’s Creed lore, December 21, 2012, was supposed to be the end of the world. 
Happy #ACDay 💝

However, Desmond Miles sacrificed himself to save the world from the destruction of Juno. That happened in 2012’s Assassin’s Creed 3. Assassin’s Creed Origins would be released on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC five years later. As the name implies, its story represents the origin of the Assassin Brotherhood (or at least what would one day become the Brotherhood). It sounds like soon we’ll be able to experience that origin story in 60 FPS. 
Unfortunately, those looking for more will have to wait and see what comes of this update, as Ubisoft did not reveal anything else. There’s no word of when this 60 FPS patch might go through, nor is there a definitive guarantee it will happen – just Ubisoft’s assertion that it’s “looking into adding 60 FPS support for Assassin’s Creed Origins.”

                    <span>Konami has announced that its upcoming free-to-play card game, Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel will launch with crossplay cross-save support. 
This news comes from Nintendo Life, which reports that Konami announced this news alongside many other features players can expect in Master Duel during the Jump Festa 2022 event recently held. The game is not yet out, but it’s expected sometime this Winter, which means its release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, PC, iOS, and Android could be imminent. For now, you can check out its official trailer.

As noted by Nintendo Life, duelists can expect the following features in Master Duel: 
4K resolution duels
Over 10,000 cards to unlock across the series’ history 
A Solo Mode campaign
Deckbuilding and a large database with Decklists
Tutorials to teach players how to play 
Special events and tournaments 
Because of today’s news, duelists can now expect to be able to play their Xbox-owning friend while on a PlayStation, for example. Or, they could play on their mobile device while their opposition plays on PC, thanks to Master Duel’s crossplay support. And thanks to cross-save support, players can freely switch between platforms. You can play primarily at home on a console or PC and then take your progression with you on the go via your mobile device. 
While waiting for Master Duel, read about its reveal and the reveal of Yu-Gi-Oh! Rush Duel Saikyou Battle Royale that happened alongside it. Check out why one Game Informer editor believes Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel might finally be what fans are looking for after that.

Even twelve years after its initial release, League of Legends stands atop the esports pantheon as one of the most popular competitive games in the world. Ruined King: A League of Legends Story takes several of the beloved MOBA’s notable characters and drops them into an entertaining, albeit overlong, role-playing experience. Skill-based progression, explorable hubs, and turn-based combat might immediately excite fans of developer Airship Syndicate’s debut project, Battle Chasers: Nightwar. However, Ruined King’s implementation of these features is often mediocre. Nevertheless, the total package i…</span>

                    <span>Square Enix announced back in October that the pixel remaster of Final Fantasy V would be launching on November 10, and it did, with word that the pixel remaster of Final Fantasy VI would be coming next, naturally. 
However, many expected a December release, but now we know it’s coming later. Square Enix has now revealed that we can expect this remaster on PC, iOS, and Android in February, although a specific release date was not given.

“In order to bring you the best experience possible, we’re giving ourselves the necessary time to apply final polish while finishing development on the game,” a Steam post from Square Enix reads. “We’re adding some new items for those that pre-purchase either the game individually or have purchased the bundle. We’re looking forward to sharing the final title in our pixel remaster series with you all early next year and we hope you’re looking forward to it.” 
As far as pre-purchase items go, players will get Locke’s Theme (Timelapse Remix), The Decisive Battle (Timelapse Remix), Terra’s Theme (Timelapse Remix), Searching for Friend (Timelapse Remix), and Aria di Mezzo Carattere (Instrumental). They’ll also get two Final Fantasy VI wallpapers, and two more wallpapers from the pixel remasters of the first six Final Fantasy games.

Originally announced in 2016 for an early 2017 release under Steam&#x27;s now-defunct Greenlight program, you&#x27;d be forgiven for thinking that Blazing Strike was canceled. However, after years of fine-tuning the gameplay, seeking different methods of funding the project, and undergoing a full visual overhaul, Blazing Strike is finally poised to launch in 2022. I went hands-on with a recent build of it and came away impressed with how the game pays loving homage to the 2D fighters I grew up with in the &#x27;90s.
In late 2016, developer RareBreed Makes Games delayed the planned playable Steam demo indefinitely. Following an abandoned Kickstarter…</span>

                    <span>Hello folks. It&#x27;s been a funny old year, 2021. On the games side, it&#x27;s often felt like a year of shifting goalposts. Games that were delayed by the pandemic last year finally got their due in 2021, but in turn many of the releases we were expecting this year have inevitably slipped into 2022. The pandemic has affected games of all sizes this year, and I don&#x27;t think it will go down in the history books as one of our all-time greats. There were still plenty of fantastic games that came out this year, mind, and we&#x27;re still counting down our absolute favourites over in our Advent Calendar. 
That said, I do think 2021 will prove to be a pivotal year for RPS - and not just because I stole Graham&#x27;s key card and changed the locks on the front door of the Treehouse. It&#x27;s been a year of immense change here at the site, so I wanted to take some time to reflect on everything that&#x27;s happened this year, and look forward to what we&#x27;ve got in store for 2022.

                    <span>If you simply can&#x27;t get enough of raccoon detectives sleuthing around dystopian Vancouver, then you&#x27;re in luck, because more is on the way. Developers EggNut have announced that a new Backbone game is coming in 2022, dropping us back into the snowy, animal-filled city. We don&#x27;t know much about it yet, but Backbone is an excellent detective puzzle game, and a gorgeous one at that, so I have high hopes for the next one.

                    <span>This door on the Advent Calendar is probably locked with a needlessly complicated key split into several pieces. Also, it is very, very tall, as if for someone who is already taller than average and then wears heels.

                    <span>After GTA: The Trilogy - Definitive Edition had a pretty naff launch last month, Rockstar ended up giving PC remaster owners copies of the oldies for free as an apology. The devs have another freebie for those folks too now - you can claim a free copy of GTA V: Premium Edition, GTA IV: Complete Edition, LA Noire, Bully: Scholarship Edition, or Max Payne 3 over the holiday period. Ah, free festive violence.

                    <span>We called Final Fantasy VII Remake a luscious spectacle that takes FF7 in a bold new direction. You know what else takes it in a new direction? Dresses. Loads of them. Modders have been hard at work weaving nice dresses with their virtual looms at a rate of knots. Oh, and they’ve morphed characters into Buster Swords and produced some other equally useful things too. Let&#x27;s have a gander at some of their most interesting creations.

I began The Gunk with eager anticipation, blasting across the swirling clouds of the cosmos. The opening cinematic is beautiful and full of promise. Unfortunately, it is also the apex of the short game’s trajectory. In a game filled with alien worlds splashed with color and populated with extraterrestrial mysteries, The Gunk falls surprisingly flat. Fortunately, this spacecraft manages to stay afloat with likable characters, solid gameplay, and a serviceable story.  
The Gunk’s heroes, Rani and Becks, are a pair of plucky and impoverished space haulers. They touch dow…</span>

                    <span>Another quarter of the year has passed, therefore another quarterly update from the Diablo IV team at Blizzard is upon us. This update on the demonic RPG focuses on some important topics like itemization and endgame progression.
It is important to keep in mind what is going on within Activision Blizzard at this time regarding ongoing allegations about the work culture. The ongoing lawsuit from the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) against the company is over reported toxic workplace culture. The bulk of the suit focuses on &quot;violations of the state&#x27;s civil rights and equal pay laws,&quot; specifically regarding the treatment of women and other marginalized groups.

                    <span>Fans of Assassin’s Creed, especially its many soundtracks, may be pleased to hear that Ubisoft and Overlook Events are launching an immersive concert based on the series. Dubbed the Assassin’s Creed Symphonic Adventure, this original concert takes players on an orchestral adventure across the franchise.
In the past, Overlook Events has organized the well-received Dragon Ball and Saint Seiya Symphonic Adventure concerts. Assassin’s Creed Symphonic Adventure follows a similar format, synchronizing a live orchestra and choir with HD video, lighting, and sound effects. The result is a two-hour musical journey across the entire series that boasts over 100 tracks. Check out the trailer below.

The premiere kicks off at the Grand Rex in Paris on October 29, 2022 which coincides with Assassin’s Creed’s 15th anniversary. If you’re planning to be in the area, tickets go on sale tomorrow, December 21. You can purchase your seat from the concert’s official website. If you can’t make it to France next October, don’t worry.  A world tour is scheduled to launch in early 2023.

                    <span>The Game Awards have been breaking their own records year-over-year and the 2021 show was no different. 
Last year, The Game Awards 2020 broke records with over 83 million viewers, and this year, the show had an estimated 85 million tune in by way of “global livestreams.” Like previous award shows, this year’s event was livestreamed across more than 30 digital networks around the world such as YouTube, Twitch, Twitter, Facebook, TikTok, and more. 
“On Twitter, The Game Awards delivered a record-setting 1.6 million tweets about the event in 2021, its best-ever performance,” a press release reads. “The show trended #1 worldwide for the 8th year in a row, commanding 11 out of the top 30 worldwide trends at the peak of conversation.” 
Over on YouTube, a new record for watch time was made with over 1.75 million hours watched on the main Game Awards stream, which does not include co-streams. That’s up 14% compared to last year’s show. Year-over-year, fan voting increased 27% to more than 23.2 million votes. 
“We are grateful we could return to an in-person ceremony in 2021 and continue to build on our success with significant international growth in 2021,” The Game Awards producer and host, Geoff Keighley, said. 
For more context about this year’s record-breaking 85 million livestream numbers, here’s a look at the numbers for previous years: 
2021: 85 million
2020: 83 million
2019: 45.2 million
2018: 26.2 million
2017: 11.5 million
2016: 3.8 million
2015: 2.3 million
2014: 1.9 million
If you weren’t one of the 85 million livestreams, don’t worry – here’s Game Informer’s list of every winner from The Game Awards 2021.

                    <span>Mass Effect 2&#x27;s final moments carry the potential for death. Commander Shepard is tasked to lead a team on a suicide mission, and the choices made during it could lead to a beloved teammate losing their life. This mission can be completed without any losses (a strategy we detail in a handy flowchart), but most players lose one or two characters two during their first playthrough.
Many of you took on this mission for the first time in Mass Effect Legendary Edition. Following the game&#x27;s release, Electronic Arts and BioWare collected player data from this mission and have revealed the survival rate for each squad member.  This info is a small part of Electronic Arts&#x27; extensive, numbers-filled year-in-review.
As the numbers show, the fan-favorite Garrus often lived to see another day, making it through the suicide mission in 98 percent of players&#x27; attempts. The loveable singer Mordin died the most, surviving in just 90 percent of players&#x27; games. You can see all of the survival rates in the image below:
Electronic Arts&#x27; also revealed the most liked squadmates from the Legendary Edition, and they are not who you would think. Garrus is third on that list, trailing Kaidan and Ashley, as one and two. A quarter of players also apparently didn&#x27;t have the time to change the name of their Commander Shepard, which defaults to John/Jane. The numbers show 23 percent of players played the game under one of these names.
If you still haven&#x27;t played through the Mass Effect trilogy, there&#x27;s no better way to do it than through Legendary Edition. Kimberley Wallace gave this collection a review score of 9 out of 10, and said: &quot;Even all these years later, Commander Shepard is a powerful force that lives up to their iconic status, and the trilogy is still captivating and worth your time.&quot;</span>

                    <span>In the midst of its initial open beta, DNF Duel received another trailer, showing off its eleventh confirmed character and announcing its intended release window of summer 2022 for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and PC. 
Ghostblade will be joining the cast when the game releases next year, making him the second male Slayer class from Dungeon Fighter Online to be included. He wields a katana for a weapon, but more importantly, he has a spooky ghost living in his arm, making the appendage glow with a spectral blue hue. The trailer shows off Ghostblade&#x27;s intro cinematic and a tease of what his Awakening attack can do. Here&#x27;s a hint: a ghost and a blade are involved, and it looks fantastic.

Eagle-eyed fans who watched the trailer&#x27;s debut during yesterday&#x27;s DNF Winter Fest have spotted a couple of new roster members in the new footage, which didn&#x27;t make it to the official trailer release. One shot revealed Ghostblade attacking the unannounced Mechanic, while another has people thinking they saw the Troubleshooter Agent variant, though that one is more speculative. Either way, I&#x27;m excited to see how both of them play if they are added, considering how varied and fun the rest of the cast is. 
While the trailer above doesn&#x27;t have that footage attached, you can check out the images over on Event Hubs&#x27; story. But watch the video anyway to see some cool characters doing neat moves and get hyped for whenever we&#x27;ll be able to get our hands on DNF Duel again.

                    <span>If you&#x27;re anything like me, I want to apologize in advance because you&#x27;re really about to feel your age:  Peter Jackson&#x27;s Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring turned 20 years old yesterday. 
Pretty wild, right? I knew the movie was old, but hearing that it was 20 years old, having first released into theaters on December 19, 2001, was a lot to take in. With 20 years behind it, a beloved movie that many still regard as an all-time high for fantasy storytelling in cinema, I figured it&#x27;d be fun to take a look at what 2001 looked like when &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; hit theaters. What consoles were we all playing? What were the most significant games that year? As you might expect, these fun little tidbits will feel as aging as the news that The Fellowship of the Ring is 20 years ol…</span>

                    <span>Hot off the heels of the release of The Witcher Season 2 on Netflix, the subscription streaming company has released the first teaser trailer for its upcoming prequel to the show, The Witcher: Blood Origin. 
As previously announced by Netflix, this prequel show takes place in the same world as The Witcher Continent that Henry Cavill’s Geralt of Rivia inhabits, but it’s more focused on the elven side of things. The trailer features plenty of Michelle Yeoh’s Scian, as well as new looks at Sophia Brown’s Élle, Jacob Collins-Levy’s Eredin, and more. This is just a taste of who we’ll be seeing in the six-episode prequel when it hits sometime in 2022.

“Witness the untold history of the Continent with The Witcher: Blood Origin, a new prequel series set in an elven world 1200 years before the events of The Witcher,” a tweet from the official Witcher account reads. “The Witcher prequel series Blood Origin will dive into the events that lead to the pivotal ‘Conjuction of the Spheres,’ when the worlds of monsters, men, and elves collided.” 
As you can see in the trailer, there’s no Geralt to be found in this series. However, as Netflix notes, Blood Origin is about the Conjuction of the Spheres, which paves the way for Geralt’s story on the Continent 1200 years later. 
While waiting for Blood Origin, check out Season 2 of The Witcher, which just hit Netflix on Friday. Read about how The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is getting DLC inspired by the Netflix TV series after that and then check out Game Informer’s The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt review.

                    <span>Joe Juba awarded Final Fantasy VII Remake an 8.75 when it launched back in 2020 on PlayStation 4, stating, “With smart (and surprising) additions to a classic world and its inhabitants, Final Fantasy VII Remake artfully appeals to nostalgia without being bound by it.” Remake Intergrade dropped this past summer exclusively on PS5, which disappointed fans who couldn’t get their hands on the next-gen console. Nevertheless, PS Plus subscribers who redeemed the vanilla Remake through the Sony-owned game service will get a free Intergrade upgrade. What’s more, the Yuffie Intermission DLC is available at a discounted price for a limited time.
Starting this Wednesday...
@FinalFantasy VII Remake via @PlayStation Plus will be able to upgrade to the PS5 version of the game.

                    <span>A new Mystery Gift event for the latest Pokémon games, Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl (BDSP), is now live. 
This news comes by way of Serebii.net, which reported that the mystery gift event is now live for all players. Unfortunately, it doesn’t offer something like the shiny Zacia and Zamazenta recently distributed via Mystery Gift in Pokémon Sword and Shield. Instead of an actual Pokémon, this event is giving players some statues for their secret bases.

More specifically, the Mystery Gift code, MERRYCHR1STMAS, will give all players a jade-colored statue of Pacharisu, Lucario, Rhyperior, Electivire, and Glaceon. The smaller statues such as that of Pacharisu and Glaceon are quite cute, but if you’re looking for something more intimidating for your base, the Rhyperior and Electivire statues have you covered. The Rhyperior statue, in particular, is massive, standing nearly twice as tall as your player character. 
Players have until December 25 to redeem this Mystery Gift. 
Serebii.net also points out another Mystery Gift event that’s currently ongoing. From now until May 22, 2022, players can enter the code BDSPUNDERGROUND to get statues of Turtwig, Chimchar, and Piplup – the starters of BDSP. 
For more about BDSP, check out our thoughts on it in Game Informer’s Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl review and then check out Game Informer’s list of the top 25 Pokémon in Diamond and Pearl.

Original Story: This year had us stuck in many video game time loops, but one of my absolute favourites was Loop Hero. I never thought an autobattler RPG would hook me the way it did, but I spent hours upon hours helping a little knight circle a seemingly endless void, and had a wonderful time doing it. If you didn&#x27;t have a chance to play it earlier this year, it&#x27;s now free on the Epic Game Store until tomorrow. I heartily encourage you to pick this one up, it&#x27;s one of our favourite games of 2021.

                    <span>The great thing about traditions is: you can just make them up. While some traditions feel more real because they&#x27;re embedded deeper in our culture, you can start your own whenever you want, and jettison any you don&#x27;t care for. Anything can be imbued with special meaning and, over time, grow into a tradition you cherish and come to anticipate. So here I am, approaching Christmas, so ready for my annual play of Skeal. Join me, reader dear.

                    <span>There’s no single, solitary reason why it’s been so hard to buy certain PC components over the past year and a bit – it’s more like a perfect storm of multiple circumstances, unfortunate coincidences and unforseen annoyances. That said, one of the biggest underlying causes of MIA CPU and graphics card stock has been a shortage of the chips needed to make them, and it’s a shortage that Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger has warned could likely continue into 2023.

                    <span>Oslain Brante tried to be a decent guy. Kind to his relatives except the one who murdered him. Resolutely loyal to his friends, even dying for one. Willing to die once again rather than betray his revolutionary allies. But it just kept going wrong for reasons that felt utterly artificial and sometimes deeply dissatisfying.
I&#x27;d have given up on the game if it weren&#x27;t so interesting. For one thing, none of those deaths were final. He died as a child and came back. He died as a teenager and came back. These were not saved games, but ordinary occurrences. It&#x27;s an interesting world made infuriating by awkward design choices.

                    <span>A new Cyberpunk 2077 mod makes the dystopian RPG&#x27;s decorative monorails functional, adding a metro system with cute wee trains you can ride. For all the game&#x27;s flaws, I did greatly enjoy wondering Night City&#x27;s streets, cooing at giant buildings and bright colours, and today I was glad to continue that tourism on rail. How lovely to see the megacity from a new perspective, looking down on rooftops and being buzzed by hovercars. See a wee bit of my journey in a video below.

                    <span>I’m rubbish at the building component of Minecraft; it’s much easier to simply download a map and wander around in the splendour of someone else’s creation. And if you’ve got the ray tracing beta version of Minecraft for Windows installed, I can heartily recommend you too take a wander through the Nvidia RTX Winter World: a vast, Christmassy and very, very pretty custom map that has you helping Santa throw a festive shindig while you trade sweets with his elves.

Our short king&#x27;s battle out of the underworld beat out its closest competition, cosy escapism simulator, Animal Crossing: New Horizons in the polls by almost fourfold.

                    <span>Yesterday, acclaimed writer George R.R. Martin (A Song of Ice and Fire) took to his blog to make a few comments about his role in the development of From Software’s upcoming Elden Ring. While the blog is short, the author is clear that his work on Elden Ring took place years ago, and focused on worldbuilding the fantastical realms that players will be investigating come February. In the blog, Martin comments that video games aren’t really his thing – but then goes on to say he played some old-school strategy games like Master of Orion, Romance of the Three Kingdoms, and Railroad Tycoon. Apparently Martin has some excellent taste with the games he chose to play back in the day!

Martin’s post is pretty clear, in that he worked on worldbuilding for the realms of Elden Ring. Exactly how this translates to the final game is unknown, but with what we saw in the network test, the world is full of discovery, even in that small slice. While the core foundational tale of the Tarnished and The Lands Between appear to have some significant similarities to the Dark Souls series right now, the world itself and much of that history is yet unknown, so we’ll have to wait and see exactly what happens. Martin also notes how video games have become bigger than films in the entertainment world these days. You can check out the entire post over on Martin’s official blog here. Martin also notes that Elden Ring looks “incredible.” On that final point, I’m inclined to agree.
Elden Ring is scheduled to arrive on February 25th on Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC. Are you looking forward to it?</span>

Plus you won&#x27;t be allowed through unless you&#x27;re dressed like a waiter, and even then you&#x27;ll get frisked by a security guard, who would be none too pleased to find the poison in your pocket.

Now developers Eugen Systems are making a spiritual successor called WARNO, which is coming to Steam Early Access next month.

For those of you more skilled than me, the trailer comes alongside the news that the DLC will launch January 6th.

Only kidding!

In fact, we&#x27;ll probably play loads of games over our breaks, but we&#x27;ll tell you about those later. Until I see you again, have a lovely time celebrating the end of the year, however you do it.

                    <span>Walking through the smoggy jerktown that is London a while back, the thought occurred that for all the building games I&#x27;ve played, I&#x27;d never seen one about remodelling an existing city. The closest I knew was NIMBY Rails, which isn&#x27;t even close.
It turns out I was miles behind the curve, as The Architect Colon Paris already exists.

                    <span>Earlier this year, Black Isle Studios and Interplay Entertainment announced they were porting the old 2001 hack and slash Baldur&#x27;s Gate: Dark Alliance to PC and consoles. It came out on PlayStation back in summer, alas they didn&#x27;t give a date for PC. But, surprise! It&#x27;s today! PC folks can finally try out the Baldur&#x27;s Gate that console users first experienced 20 years ago. I did a full playthrough this summer and had a lovely time, at the expense of my partner, who I made sit through one of the jankiest couch co-op games in existence.

                    <span>This week&#x27;s episode of the Ultimate Audio Bang is both festive, but tinged with sadness. It&#x27;s Imogen&#x27;s final run of the pod and I&#x27;m very sad about it. But we (I) gather ourselves and chat FPS news, like how PUBG is going free to play, Overwatch actually has something new, and lots of Halo Infinite stuff. We also get one final update on Imogen&#x27;s Apex Legends rank. I&#x27;d love to say it&#x27;s positive, but it&#x27;s actually quite crushing. Merry Christmas.

                    <span>Remember when the Devotion developers Red Candle showed off a tiny snippet of a pretty 2D game they&#x27;d been working on earlier this year? They didn&#x27;t have much to say about it at the time, but last night they announced it properly. Named Nine Sols, it&#x27;s an action platformer with combat inspired by Sekiro. Honestly, they still don&#x27;t have much to say about it beyond that, but they have released a gorgeous poster featuring a cat-like character that you can see in full below.

                    <span>You know what Christmas was missing? The unmatched fear of being chased by terrifying killer robots through a shopping mall. Five Nights At Freddy&#x27;s: Security Breach launched last night, inviting players to fend off a whole new crew of animatronics. This is the eighth mainline game in the long-running pizzeria-based horror series (I know, there are loads of spin-offs too), and for the first time it will let players properly roam free, rather than be tied to a desk monitoring cameras.

Podpora funguje přes DXVK-Native, který překládá Direct3D do API Vulkan. Hru je potřeba spustit s parametrem -vulkan. Podobně již byly přetransformovány hry Portal 2, Left 4 Dead 2 a Half-Life 2 což je příprava na Steam Deck.</span>

                    <span>Transparent huge pages (THP) zrychlují práci s pamětí v Linuxu, protože umožňují pro aplikace transparentní použití velkých stránek paměti (na amd64 2 MB a u novějších procesorů 1 GB) místo výchozích stránek (u amd64 4 kB). THP je možné nastavit na never, always a madvise. Nastavení always může některé aplikace zpomalit, proto je často v distribucích výchozím nastavením madvise, tedy záleží na aplikaci, jestli při alokaci paměti použije madvise a tím dá najevo, že by použití velkých stránek mělo pomoci.</span>

                    <span>Senior v IT. To zní docela dobře. Je to pozice, na kterou se asi těší většina začínajících IT profesionálů. Vždyť „Senior“ je i nejhledanější úrovní na pracovním portálu No Fluff Jobs. Jak určíme, kdo je senior? A kdo by se na seniorní pozice měl hlásit?</span>

                    <span>Dota 2 has a new event mode and battle pass. Aghanim from last year&#x27;s Aghanim&#x27;s Labyrinth event has returned, and this time a &quot;multiverse-melding mishap&quot; has split him into several doppelgängers players must rescue. The event mode is free, but it arrives alongside a new battle pass that&#x27;ll cost money to enter.

More strangely, today&#x27;s update also introduces experimental gamepad support.

&quot;Based on feedback we received, we&#x27;ve made a decision to cancel anything NFT-related in S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2,&quot; reads the post. &quot;The interests of our fans and players are the top priority for the team.

                    <span>The makers of Arma and DayZ have revealed Enfusion, the new cross-platform game engine they plan to build future games on. No, Bohemia Interactive haven&#x27;t announced Arma 4, but they do say they would use Enfusion for &quot;any potential new Arma game&quot;, so maybe that&#x27;s something to bear in mind while looking at its screenshots of vast landscapes. While they don&#x27;t have much more than screenshots and a wee video to show right now (sorry, engine enthusiasts), they do hint that they&#x27;ll release some sort of &quot;playable demonstration of its features&quot; at some point &quot;soon&quot;.

                    <span>The Epic Games Store Holiday Sale started today, with lots of discounts and that but more importantly: 15 days of free video games. They&#x27;re starting with one that I&#x27;m certainly curious enough to play for free but not buy: Shenmue 3. Yeah gwan, I&#x27;ll grab that. Epic are also going wild with coupons again, giving a £10 (or $10) coupon on every game you buy which costs at least £13.99 (or $14.99). Given Epic&#x27;s habit of paying for timed exclusives, they do have discounts on some games you&#x27;ll not get elsewhere, or at least not with those vouchers.

                    <span>Let me slap you with the caveat up front. Halo Infinite&#x27;s best place is its open world, through which you can swing like a honking metal Tarzan and do sweet Warthog jumps from cliffs. But its best level, the most satisfying A-to-B gun boulevard, comes late in the campaign (spoilers ahead). The House Of Reckoning is a series of rooms where contrived artificial battlefields have been constructed inside an alien fortress. They are abstractly human structures surrounded by sand, as if your extraterrestrial enemies have been playing house but believe a homo sapiens&#x27; house looked exactly like a chunk of Normandy beach circa 1944. The narrative reasoning behind this level is absurd. But the fights that occur within are excellent.

                    <span>God rest ye merry listener, let nothing you dismay - for today, for one night only, EWS stands for Electronic Wrestling Show. Yes, our podcast&#x27;s wrestling promotion has rolled into your town for a showstopping tag team match. Each of your pod hosts fields a three-game tag team of our favourite games of the year, and fields them in a spectacular(ly described) ladder match. The victor will claim the GOTY In The Bank briefcase and win the chance to compete next year as well.
Before we get to that, though, we must first discuss (at length) whether 200 t-shirts is a lot of t-shirts, what Nate is having for his Christmas dinner, what kind of cop duo would be named Halloumi &amp; Date, and also what our favourite Christmas songs are. Nate also does a really good Mankind pun. Plus: which wrestler would be the best hugger?

In fact, I bet it attracts bad sleeps. Anyway, I’m considering the installation of a feathery net because DokeV’s music video from the latest Geoff Awards has infiltrated the darkest recesses of my brain again. I thought I’d shaken off the trailer song, but it’s back with full force and haunts me more than ever.

                    <span>Final Fantasy VII Remake certainly knows how to make a good first impression. The original&#x27;s bombing mission sequence, which sees Cloud and co. blow up a planet-killing mako reactor in the industrialised hellhole of Midgar&#x27;s city centre, was already one of the Final Fantasy series&#x27; best openers, but here we get to really luxuriate in every last detail of its twenty-four-year glow-up. Director Tetsuya Nomura may have a reputation for excess in JRPG circles (both in his tangled storylines and his passion for buckles and belts), but in FF7R that tendency toward indulgence has been applied with deadly, laser-like precision.

                    <span>CD Projekt have announced plans to pay out $1,850,000 (£1.4 million) to settle a class action lawsuit brought by investors over Cyberpunk 2077&#x27;s troubles. The suit started in December 2020 with investors primarily upset with the fact that the console version was in such a state, claiming that CDP hadn&#x27;t been honest about the game and its prospects. CDP say that the proposed settlement terms make clear that though they are paying out, this &quot;does not imply admission of any responsibility&quot;.

                    <span>It’s been nearly a year since Nvidia started reissuing older GPUs, like the GeForce RTX 2060 and GeForce GTX 1050 Ti, to help deal with the great worldwide graphics card shortage. More recently, Nvidia went a step further, quietly launching a brand new version of the RTX 2060 that doubles its VRAM to 12GB.


Emphasis on the “quietly”, mind – even if you’ve been regularly checking for available GPU stock or perusing our graphics cards deals guide, you probably won’t have even noticed there’s a 12GB RTX 2060 knocking around. So what’s the deal with this mysterious card, and should you even consider buying an RTX 20 series card in this day and age?

                    <span>The Gunk might not be the most sophisticated name in the universe for a gooey black jelly that pulses with an ominous red light, but goodness it sure is appropriate. As space haulers Rani and Becks touch down on a forgotten planet in search of a strange energy signal, the place is absolutely gummed up with the stuff. It oozes and throbs in the caves, plains and rivers of this once vibrant landscape, and the urge to suck it all up into Rani&#x27;s chunky power glove (a literal hand vac in this case) is overwhelmingly strong. After all, when it turns the ground black and saps the world of all its colour, this is one case of Extremely Bad Vibes you&#x27;ll want to remedy as soon as possible. 
Your reward for scooping up all the gunk in any given area is the kind of graphical wizardry video games do best. A burst of light, a shruum of sound, and the world is instantly transformed back to its former glory. Despite its gloopy namesake, The Gunk is frequently stunning, its soft pastels and coral-esque flora showing such an eye for jaw-dropping visuals that it&#x27;s hard to believe this is SteamWorld developer Image &amp; Form&#x27;s first ever 3D video game. If this is what they&#x27;ve been holding back on all these years, then their upcoming action adventure SteamWorld Headhunter should be a real treat for the old eyeballs. That said, while Image &amp; Form have clearly navigated their 2D to 3D transition from an art perspective, their typical flair for adding their own spin to different genres has been less successful. There&#x27;s a lot to like about this 3D action platformer, but it&#x27;s missing that spark to really make it sing.

This latest OlliOlli game swaps out the 2D style for a cel-shaded 3D world that looks absolutely lovely. Or radical. Or sick. Or other skater words. The action-platformer&#x27;s plot sounds great too, it drops you into Radlandia on a search for the skate gods. Skate gods! Don&#x27;t anger them, kiddos, they&#x27;ll break your collarbones.

                    <span>Here I was thinking Tetris 99 was the strangest game to be turned into a battle royale, but now you can fight to the death in Scrabble too. Babble Royale is a new Scrabble-like battle royale where 16 players fight to be the last letters standing. You have to make words in such a way that you escape a zone that&#x27;s closing in, and attack other players by building words off of theirs. I honestly didn&#x27;t think it would work, but man, it absolutely does.

                    <span>Final Fantasy XIV is suffering from success, thanks, in part, to its recently released Endwalker expansion. Despite updates to ease server errors and long queue times, players are still struggling to log into the game. So, Square Enix have only gone and done it. They&#x27;ve temporarily suspended sales of the game, as well as new registrations for the free trial version. Even adverts are being stopped for now.

                    <span>After eight years of radio silence, Ubisoft are finally bringing Sam Fisher in from the cold, as they&#x27;ve just announced a remake of the original Splinter Cell. In keeping with the series&#x27; stealth roots, the game was announced with little to no fanfare this evening via a blog post, with Ubisoft declaring its existence along with some developer chat before scampering back into the shadows. Typical.

                    <span>It&#x27;s not often those Nintendo Directs have PC-related news for us, but today&#x27;s announceathon had a little treat. Loco Motive is a train-based detective game published by Chucklefish (who also pubbed Stardew Valley and Starmancer), and is the debut game from developers Robust Games. There&#x27;s been a murder! And it&#x27;s your job to figure out who committed the crime. Classic whodunnit stuff that we&#x27;ll get to play next summer.

You can grab the excellent HTC Vive Cosmos Elite VR headset kit for £649. That&#x27;s £250 off the list price, as well as a return to the price that the full VR kit was going for on Black Friday. Surely, this is a sweeter deal than Tom Cruise&#x27;s Christmas cake.

                    <span>Nerves have been sufficiently jangled as of late, not least thanks to the slew of action packed games that have landed in recent months. I crave an altogether more sedate beginning to next year, and so my mind turns to games in which violence, reflex or any other kind of unblinking attentiveness takes a back seat. 
Looking for a broader mixture of games? Check out our regularly updated list of the best PC games you can play right now.
Primarily we&#x27;re talking violence-free games here, but I wanted to drill a little deeper than that - so nothing that generally requires a competitive streak. I&#x27;m chasing a certain feel rather than a certain category. Flying, walking, puzzling, driving, building, dreaming, climbing, stretching, swinging (not like that), swimming, wondering: these are just a few of the ways in which flashing pixels can make you feel a very different sort of accomplishment.

                    <span>I really don’t like gaming chairs. They’re expensive, often cumbersome, drastically over-designed things that lean way too heavily into the g4m3r aesthetic, and that’s coming from someone who’s built up something of a tolerance to it from years of unprotected RGB exposure. I’ve sat on them and have even shared homes with some of them, but have never, ever seen the appeal over a halfway decent office chair.


And then the Noblechairs Epic TX comes along, and it’s got me rethinking.

                    <span>Christmas is coming, PC gamers. The Untitled Goose is getting fat. Somewhere in the distant north, a scarlet priest works his elven minions into a frenzy as he prepares for the rite of the magic baby. Sprouts will be consumed in their millions, the Great Escape snoozed through by bloated grandparents far and wide. Most importantly, gifts of roughly equivalent financial value will be exchanged to demonstrate affection and prolong the reign of capitalism.

                    <span>I’ve been hands-on with Sifu, a beat ‘em up action-adventure game by Absolver developers Sloclap. My hands weren’t exactly “on”, but more “around”, actually. That’s one thing I learned from my time with this kung-fu caper. To keep my fists flowing, I needed to be patient, and not mash the buttons. Seriously, slap those buttons with zero thought and you’re dead.
Death in Sifu means you age, and if you die lots, you age faster. Hit 70 and you won’t be rising from the dirt again. Instead, you&#x27;ll have to start your quest for vengeance over from the beginning. While it can be tempting to cling onto your youth for this reason alone, I actually liked growing old, with my beard and my harder-hitting attacks. Not only do you develop a relationship with your body in Sifu, but your trips to the afterlife also help you master its myriad of moves. Sifu really does get better with age.

Ubisoft are giving the 2D side-scroller away as part of their 35th anniversary celebrations, which is wonderful news. It&#x27;s one of the best co-op games I&#x27;ve played, so it&#x27;s a perfectly timed freebie if you&#x27;re in need of something to keep friends and family entertained over the holiday period.

                    <span>The fifteenth door on the Advent Calendar is a bit of a mish-mash, almost as if six different artists had a go at making it at different times. Interesting. Let&#x27;s see what lies on the other side of it.

                    <span>Inscryption is, without a doubt, the best game I&#x27;ve played this year. It&#x27;s creepy, surprising, and superbly fun, and now you can play the best part for as long as you please. Developer Daniel Mullins has released a &quot;mini-expansion&quot; in beta on Steam, which (minor spoilers ahead!) makes its animal-based card game a standalone roguelike experience. Named Kaycee&#x27;s Mod, it&#x27;s slightly tougher than what you might have played already, and adds new challenges too, so you can keep going back in for more.

                    <span>When I finished watching The Game Awards reveal trailer for Rumbleverse, the new Epic-published battle royale game that looks a bit like Fortnite but with melee combat, I raised a practiced eyebrow of derision. &quot;Well, that looks terrible,&quot; chortled I, knowing full well that I&#x27;d still give it a go at the earliest opportunity because I am an absolute sucker for battle royales.
Two things happened later that day that I did not expect. First: I got the opportunity to dive into Rumbleverse&#x27;s action-packed 40-player matches far earlier than I&#x27;d anticipated, as part of a one day early look at the game. I downloaded and installed it in short order, and jumped right in. Two hours later, at 1am in the morning as the servers shut down, I happened across a second, far more unexpected thing. I found myself absolutely desperate to play more. I&#x27;ve sunk thousands of hours into Apex Legends, Fortnite, Plunkbat, Hunt: Showdown, Warzone, and various other behemoths of the genre. Yet those two hours I spent playing Rumbleverse might be the most fun I&#x27;ve ever had in a battle royale.

                    <span>Praey Of The Gods initially looks too similar to Shadow Of The Colossus for comfort. And then you think: why wouldn&#x27;t someone make another game where you climb and bring low gigantic beasts? After almost three years in early access, Praey has reached v1.0, adding two new boss battles in the process.

                    <span>Stargate: Timekeepers was announced back in May with little more than a cinematic. Most of my initial interest was tied to its developer, Creative Forge Games, who made interesting-but-flawed stealth XCOMlike Phantom Doctrine.

Now there&#x27;s a soundless gameplay trailer of Stargate in action, and ooh, it looks a lot like Commandos.

I&#x27;m an explorer (and frequent dier). But, with the Caves &amp; Cliffs Part 2 update that arrived last month, I&#x27;ve had a newfound purpose: create the coolest home I can find in the biggest cave I can find.

Even in the best of years, I find Christmas challenging. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m filling my ears with the maximalist sounds of a song which knows true suffering, a song from a fictional musician in a video game. Reader dear, it&#x27;s that time of year: if you&#x27;ve not already started, pour a cocoa and join me for Christmas Pain In Christmas Town.

The town management game has its own cryptocurrency, of course, and this weekend they sold NFTs of virtual land for real money. The hope for crypto land barons is that they would be able to earn money back from other players through in-game business partnerships.

                    <span>Paralives Studio has given us all an early Christmas present, in the form of a look at Paralives&#x27; character creation tool. The video is pre-alpha footage and it emphasises that this is still a work in progress, but the character creator (called Paramaker, a name chosen by the game&#x27;s community) looks ridiculously detailed even so.
Paralives is a life sim game that may even have the chops to topple The Sims&#x27; supremacy when it launches. This video of the character creation is the beefiest look at Paralives we&#x27;ve had for a while. Marvel as the Paras change musculature, fat distribution and weight before your eyes. Importantly, you can give your Paras some sick tattoos and amazing patterned jackets, because what&#x27;s the point making a tiny puppet to play with if they&#x27;re not well cool?

                    <span>As part of our relaunched supporter program this year, we&#x27;ve been busy organising lots of great free game keys for RPS premium supporters. Admittedly, the last two we&#x27;ve done (Darkest Dungeon and Wartales) have both been quite small with only limited numbers of codes available, but I&#x27;m pleased to say we&#x27;ve finally put together that long-awaited &#x27;big&#x27; free game drop that all premium supporters will be able to get involved with. 
That next free game is Plunder Panic, a swashbuckling pirate &#x27;em up in which teams of up to six players battle it out on the high seas. Here&#x27;s how to get your copy.

                    <span>On Friday, a report into Bungie&#x27;s work culture unearthed allegations of racism, sexism, discrimination, toxic leadership and more besides. Current and former employees of the Destiny developers claim they&#x27;ve experienced &quot;overt sexism, boys&#x27; club culture, crunch, and HR protection of abusers, as well as more complex stories of microaggressions, systemic inequalities, and difficulties in being heard&quot;. CEO Pete Parsons has since issued an apology &quot;on behalf of everyone at Bungie&quot;, acknowledging that the studio needs to listen to these accounts, and do better.
