Call of Duty: Vanguard is a tale of three games. As is sometimes the case, several of the pillars lift up the package – and one brings it down. Vanguard’s campaign is weak, but multiplayer and zombies carry the title to victory. Let’s break down each experience.
It is important to keep in mind what is going on within Activision Blizzard at this time regarding ongoing allegations about the work culture. The ongoing lawsuit from the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) against the company is over reported toxic workpl…</span>

The first trailer for E4&#x27;s GamesMaster reboot has just gone live, and it gives a good taste of what to expect from the series.
Hosted by Rob Florence and starring the legendary Sir Trevor McDonald as the titular GamesMaster, the series has been filmed at the iconic Crossness Pumping Station in London, and seems to follow the format of the original seasons pretty closely.

Look, we know that time travelling is a controversial act in Animal Crossing: New Horizons, but someone on the Nintendo Life team (we&#x27;ll avoid shaming them this time) has found an interesting discovery by doing exactly that. If the tagline above didn&#x27;t grab your attention, please consider this a final warning before spoilers are revealed.

Clicking through to the website now lets you sign up to be notified of new stock, so at least there&#x27;s a chance you&#x27;ll still get your hands on some in the future. They&#x27;re also available at GAME, but a higher price of £3.99 plus £4.99 delivery means you&#x27;ll have to pay a ridiculous £8.98 for just one pack.

Pikmin Bloom, a new Pokémon GO-like app that has you walking around the real world while tending to your Pikmin, has started to roll out worldwide. If you&#x27;ve been thinking about giving it a go or want to learn what all the fuss is about, make sure to check out Nintendo&#x27;s brand new overview trailer above.
The new video goes over several of the game&#x27;s mechanics, letting you see first-hand how monitoring your steps translates to growing and looking after your Pikmin pals. We recently shared a full review of the app, too, noting that Bloom is a far more relaxed experience than Pokémon GO that&#x27;s more of a glorified pedometer than a &#x27;game&#x27;.

Animal Crossing: New Horizons&#x27; paid DLC, Happy Home Paradise, is now available to download from the Switch eShop. It offers a whole lot of new content to enjoy, but Nintendo has warned fans of some pesky bugs that can occur under certain conditions.
The problems occur when trying to remodel a resident&#x27;s home while your airport&#x27;s gates are open – as long as you avoid this for now, you shouldn&#x27;t encounter any issues. Here&#x27;s Nintendo&#x27;s full statement, including a promise to release a patch to fix the issue later this month:

                    <span>And some of them are actually darn good.
The Switch has a lot of games, and we&#x27;d certainly argue that quite a lot of really good games are in the system&#x27;s vast library, waiting to be discovered. There are plenty of bad games and silly apps, of course, but there is nevertheless plenty of fantastic variety for those that seek out the better options.
In addition to decent support in the retail space, a big part of the third-party scene on Switch is the eShop. Nintendo&#x27;s download store has never been bigger, which is something Nintendo has highlighted in its financial reports - it&#x27;s given the eye-catching update that there are now over 6700 third-party games on the system.

Nintendo&#x27;s extensive financial results briefing has plenty of information in various areas, and right at the back is the company&#x27;s renewed commitment to its &#x27;ESG&#x27; Initiatives - Environment, Social and Governance.
It reiterates some information seen in the most recent corporate social responsibility report, but is perhaps worth another focus. In terms of environment initiatives, the company&#x27;s goals are to produce &#x27;environmentally conscious products&#x27; - this is focused on energy conservation (Switch, like its predecessors, has a low power draw), &#x27;green procurement&#x27;, efficient transportation and &#x27;post-sales recycling&#x27;.

It&#x27;s a rather exciting month for the Nintendo Switch, with a lot of huge releases on the way. We&#x27;ve just shared our review of Shin Megami Tensei V (it&#x27;s excellent, by the way), but if you&#x27;re looking for even more RPG action later this month, you might want to keep an eye out for Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl.
These remakes based on the classic Nintendo DS titles from 2006/07 are returning on November 19th, and ahead of the big release Nintendo and The Pokémon Company have been pumping out new hype trailers. In the latest upload on Nintendo&#x27;s channel is a lengthy 5-minute overview of the anticipated release.

                    <span>The sky is the limit.
It seems Nintendo&#x27;s decision to remaster and port its 2011 Wii release The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD to the Switch has well and truly paid off.
In the company&#x27;s latest financial report, it&#x27;s been revealed the Nintendo Switch version of the game has already sold 3.60 million units as of 30th September 2021. As highlighted by many other sources, means it has already matched the lifetime sales of the original Wii game (roughly 3.67 million, according to industry analyst Daniel Ahmad) in just 77 days.

Though I do suspect the part of Vanguard many want isn&#x27;t out yet, and they won&#x27;t even pay for: the new Pacific island map coming to CoD: Warzone at a later point.

Video games can elevate these head-scratching problems to new heights and complexities by immersing you in a setting, messing with concepts like the tenants of time and space, or by simply giving you endless access to your favorite brainteasers.

Gold-foil covers. Uniquely numbered issues. High-gloss pages. This is Game Informer Gold: The same video game magazine you know and love printed on ridiculously high-quality paper. We&#x27;ve been working on making this high-end variant for over a year and are finally ready to reveal it.
Each edition of Game Informer Gold is limited with a small print run. Much like prized comic books, each copy is bagged and boarded. You may even get a hand-written note from me in the box it&#x27;s shipped in.
We are auctioning off the first copy of Game Informer Gold during our 25-hour Extra Life Livestream on November 6. The auction begins at 4 p.m. CT and all money goes to Children&#x27;s Miracle Network Hospitals.
Want to get your hands on a copy? We plan to reveal more details about Game Informer Gold&#x27;s availability in the weeks and months ahead. Stay tuned to Game Informer&#x27;s social channels for that information.
I know you hear this often, but you need to get your hands on Game Informer Gold to truly understand how big of an upgrade it is. From its increased thickness to the gold shine on the cover, this is as high-end as magazines get.

In the months ahead, we plan on creating limited Gold editions for each issue. We may also reprint back issues with the Gold treatment. Here&#x27;s a cool twist: Some of these issues (new and old) could feature never-before-seen alternate artwork on the covers, perhaps from some of the world&#x27;s most celebrated artists.
We&#x27;re going to have some fun with Game Informer Gold, and we can&#x27;t wait for you to get your hands on an issue!</span>

                    <span>Spider-Man is finally arriving in Marvel’s Avengers later this month. Specifically, he&#x27;s coming to the PlayStation versions of the game – he’s an exclusive character, after all. But even non-PlayStation owners will be treated to a substantial update that adds a new Raid, power cap increase, and a perhaps friendlier method of unlocking cosmetics. 
November 30 is the big day that patch 2.2 hits the game. Spider-Man arrives in the Great Power Hero Event. The story centers on Peter Parker uncovering a mysterious threat and joining up with the Avengers to prevent AIM from procuring powerful technology. Although Spidey struggles with working as part of a team, he manages to form bonds with Ms. Marvel and Black Widow (despite insisting on maintaining his secret identity). The crux of the campaign…</span>

                    <span>Adorable 2009 platformer A Boy And His Blob hops over to Switch today. 
First released for the Wii, the game is a remake of the NES cult classic A Boy and His Blob: Trouble on Blobolonia. Players control the titular boy, with the help of his shape-shifting blob companion, to solve 2D platforming puzzles. Feeding the Blob jellybeans turns it into 15 different objects ranging from a parachute, anvil, or cannon. The game’s best feature: you can hug the Blob anytime.

A Boy and His Blob has since become a cult favorite in its own right. We scored the original Wii release an 8 out of 10. In her review, former GI editor Meagan Marie wrote that “...there is something undeniably magnetic about the game. The lush environments, charming characters, and the infinite power of the hug button make it impossible to stay upset for too long.” Over the last decade, it’s been ported to PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC, and mobile devices. 
You can purchase A Boy and His Blob for $14.99 on the Switch eShop. The port is being handled by Ziggurat Interactive, which is also gearing up to release enhanced versions of the BloodRayne games on consoles.</span>

Riot Games and Epic Games announced the team-up that brings Jinx to the battle royale today, and it marks the first time a League of Legends champion has ever been featured in a non-Riot game.

“Riot Games is one of the world’s best developers and creators of groundbreaking entertainment franchises,” Epic Games Store vice president Steve Allison writes in the press release. “We’re excited they’ve chosen to partner with us to bring their titles to millions of new players through the Epic Games Store.”
While waiting for Jinx to hit the Fortnite Item Shop tonight, read about how Riot is celebrating its upcoming Arcane series through the month of November.

                    <span>Take-Two Interactive has reportedly canceled a $53 million game that was being developed by Hangar 13. 
This news comes by way of Bloomberg, which reports that “people familiar with the decision” have learned that “further development of an unannounced title in its pipeline” has ended. Codenamed Volt, this game had reportedly gone through multiple iterations since first being conceived but ultimately, what led to its cancellation was the repeated “reboots, technological hiccups, and challenges caused by COVID-19,” Bloomberg reports. 
Volt’s development began in 2017, and it was set to be centered around various superheroes competing against each other. It would have featured an emphasis on online gameplay. 
“It was set to be a new intellectual property for Hangar 13, but 2K executives didn’t see it as a worthwhile investment because of the amount of time needed in development before it became a finished product,” Bloomberg’s report reads. 
There have been no layoffs as a result of this at the time of this writing, and Bloomberg reports that Hangar 13 employees will meet Thursday in Novata, California, where the studio is based, to discuss what happens next. 
Bloomberg writer Jason Schreier, who wrote this report, tweeted out additional details about the canceled project and those affected. He said Hangar 13 staff in California learned today via email that Volt was canceled, and he also noted that some non-US staff members learned of this news from his report. 
Schreier also said this canceled game was not Mafia 4, which some thought Hangar 13 was developing according to rumors. He said Mafia 4 rumors “were always false, aside from their early attempts in 2016-2017.”

                    <span>Halo has always had some great collector’s editions with each new release – looking at you, Master Chief helmet that came with Halo 3 – and Walmart sort of surprise announced a new one for Halo Infinite overnight. As expected, it sold out immediately. 
As far as special editions of Halo Infinite goes, there’s the Halo Infinite Xbox Series X bundle, the special steelbook that comes with preorders in select locations, and that’s about it. Before today, we hadn’t yet seen a special Halo Infinite edition that comes with what’s usually expected i.e. a statue of some kind, maybe some patches or stickers, and an art book. 
It seems Walmart had the lock on that because overnight, it released the Halo Infinite Collector’s Edition for $169.99. It sold out near immediately. It features the game, of course, a steelbook case (the same one being sold by other retailers), a set of five patches, a Plasma Pistol replica bottle opener, an Energy Sword desk lamp, two lanyards, a mini art book, a desktop portfolio, and a special developer note. 
According to Walmart, this edition was limited to just 10,000 units and now, it’s sold out. It’s unclear if more Collector’s Editions will be released. It’s also important to note that oddly enough, neither Microsoft nor Xbox have mentioned this edition yet. 
Perhaps it’s an unofficial one made by Walmart, although that would be odd considering it comes with some very official-looking merchandise. Maybe Walmart jumped the gun and released it early. All we know is that we’re very sad we were sleeping while this went live. 
For more about Halo Infinite, check out this story about Craig the Brute’s glow-up of the year and then read about how 343 Industries used Halo 3 and Halo Reach as inspiration for Infinite’s character and enemy design. Check out Game Informer’s breakdown of everything we know about Halo Infinite after that.

                    <span>FromSoftware showed off 15 minutes of Elden Ring gameplay this morning, and also revealed a pair of snazzy special editions at the presentation&#x27;s conclusion. Those who want more swag for their buck can pre-order these bad boys now. 
First up is the Collector’s Edition, which includes the following goodies:
Elden Ring game
Malenia – Blade of Miquella statue (23 cm)
Exclusive steelbook
40-page hardback artbook
Digital soundtrack
The Premium Collector’s Edition includes everything in the Collector’s Edition but tosses in a 1:1 replica of Malenia’s helmet, which may or may not be big enough to wear. Check it out below. 
The Collector’s Edition will set you back $189.99. The Premium Edition briefly appeared for $229.99 on Bandai Namco&#x27;s website but is a bit tough to track down right now. You&#x27;ll have to pre-order from retailers fast to grab one before they&#x27;re just a memory. You can try your luck at Best Buy, Target, and GameStop (disclaimer: GameStop is the parent company of Game Informer). 
Elden Ring releases February 25 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

                    <span>FromSoftware has released 15 minutes of Elden Ring gameplay and it features some of its open-world traversal in The Land Between, Souls-like combat, a healthy amount of death, and a look at some of the dungeons that await players within. 
The entire showcase heavily emphasizes player choice when navigating the world of Elden Ring. Unlike previous FromSoftware games which are more akin to wide-open, interconnected areas rather than a full-on open-world, Elden Ring’s world is completely open, allowing players to tackle objectives how they see fit.

                    <span>More Than 5 million copies of Grand Theft Auto V – you know, the game released nearly a decade ago – were sold just last quarter, bringing its total units sold up to a whopping 155 million units. 
This news comes by way of VentureBeat, which reports that the Rockstar-developed open-world game has generated more than $6 billion in revenue since its 2013 release. GTAV became the most profitable entertainment product of all time three years ago in 2018, as reported by GamesIndustry.biz, and it seems like the game has no plans to give up that title anytime soon. 
These new GTAV numbers come from Take-Two Interactive’s latest financial report, which details the second fiscal quarter’s earnings. That quarter ended on September 30. According to VentureBeat, the company beat not only Wall Street’s…</span>

                    <span>The classic and punishing Shin Megami Tensei franchise is back with a new mainline entry, and it’s full of everything we’ve come to expect from the series: challenging battles, intense demon negotiations, and philosophical conundrums about the state of the world. I’ve been playing Shin Megami Tensei V, already clocking close to 40 hours, but I haven’t reached the end to deliver my final verdict. Until then, I’ll say: Shin Megami Tensei sticks close to its roots – for better or worse. This means common series complaints, such as poor navigation and obtuse instructions, remain, but Atlus has also enhanced certain aspects, with more expansive areas, more skill customization, and stellar demon designs. If you’re an SMT fan, you should feel at home with the long, hard-fought journey that awaits…</span>

                    <span>The new wireless Nintendo 64 controller sold out almost immediately and it’s now not expected to be available for sale again until 2022, but if you’re one of the lucky people that nabbed one, you can now play Super Mario 64 on Switch with it. 
This news comes by way of Nintendo, which announced that Version 1.1.1 is out for Super Mario 3D All-Stars, which is the collection released last year that features Super Mario 64, Super Mario Sunshine, and Super Mario Galaxy. Before this new update, you could only play these three games using Joy-Con or the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller.

That’s still the case for Super Mario Sunshine and Super Mario Galaxy, but thanks to Version 1.1.1., you can now play Super Mario 64 with Nintendo’s recently-released 64 controller. Joy-Con and the Pro controller work fine in Super Mario 64, but for those looking for a more classic and nostalgic feel, using the 64 controller while playing is sure to fit their fancy. 
While waiting for the 64 controllers to be in stock again, check out why one of Game Informer’s editors thinks Super Mario 3D All-Stars is a great collection of remasters that doesn’t quite go far enough and then read about how Nintendo stopped selling this collection after March 31, 2021. Check out our thoughts on the latest 3D Mario game released in Game Informer’s Super Mario 3D World + Bowser’s Fury review after that.

It&#x27;s that time of year again. A new entry in the Call of Duty series is nearly here, and with its release comes the familiar questions of whether or not fans should pick up the latest entry in the annualized series. We set out to answer that question on these fresh episodes of New Gameplay Today, focused on Call of Duty: Vanguard&#x27;s zombie and campaign modes!
It is important to keep in mind what is going on within Activision Blizzard at this time regarding ongoing allegations about the work culture. The ongoing lawsuit from the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) against the company is over reported toxic workplace culture. The bulk of the suit focuses on &quot;violations of the state&#x27;s civil rights and equal pay laws,&quot; specifically regard…</span>

                    <span>Yacht Club Games has announced that Shovel Knight Dig will be released in 2022. 
Dig was announced way back in August of 2019 as a new take on the massively popular Shovel Knight character. It still features the Shovel Knight millions have come to love over the years, but Dig drops the classic 2D platformer feel for a more unique style of gameplay that draws on titles like Mr. Driller and Dig Dug.

While a release date for Dig was never announced, it seems Yacht Club had 2021 in mind considering they announced today that Dig needs more time and will be released next year. 
“With 2021 coming to a close, we wanted to provide an update regarding Shovel Knight Dig,” a blog post from Yacht Club reads. “Development is going great, but we need a little more ti…</span>

                    <span>Nintendo has dropped some new sales numbers for its latest console, the Nintendo Switch, as well as the top 10 best-selling Switch games. 
It’s no surprise the Switch is doing well – its sales haven’t really let up since the hybrid console hit the market in March of 2017. Still, it’s already one of Nintendo’s best-selling consoles and currently in fourth place in the company’s entire platform lineup. The latest numbers released by Nintendo today take all sales through September 30, 2021, into account and the Switch sits at 92.87 million units sold.

That number places the Switch far ahead of the NES, SNES, Nintendo 64, GameCube, Game Boy Advance, the 3DS, and the Wii U. In fact, the only four consoles ahead of it are the Wii at 101.63 million units sold…</span>

Since the spin-off series’ inception, Forza Horizon’s approachable and exciting racing action has appealed to a broad audience. Forza Horizon 5 continues this tradition of delivering stellar driving mechanics within a gorgeous destination, this time taking players to Mexico for one of the best, most expansive racing games I’ve ever played.
Driving through Mexico in Forza Horizon 5 is an utter delight thanks to superb, dynamic driving mechanics that consider the terrain, weather, and handling of the more than 500 vehicles you drive. Forza Horizon 5 aptly demonst…</span>

Animal Crossing: New Horizons has a massive new update, and the new Pro Camera App is one of the latest additions.
The new camera app adds two important features: the Handheld Camera and the Tripod Camera (learn how to unlock and use them in our guide), so now you can take selfies and close-up first-person photos.

Earlier this week, a zen game about unpacking, which is unsurprisingly called Unpacking, launched on Nintendo Switch. Since then, it&#x27;s been getting a lot of attention, both for its players who don&#x27;t know what GameCubes are, and for the stunning amount of detail within the isometric pixel art game.
The latest detail to go viral is one that doesn&#x27;t usually get nearly enough recognition: the Foley work, done by BAFTA-award-winning composer and audio designer, Jeff van Dyck, who has credits on Total War, Hand of Fate, and a number of EA Sports games.

Today brought the Q2 Nintendo financial results, which would be easy to miss with the understandable excitement of Animal Crossing: New Horizons version 2.0 arriving a day early. In some ways they&#x27;re results with two sides, though within Nintendo&#x27;s boardroom they may feel like they&#x27;re somewhat stuck in the middle.

                    <span>That&#x27;s quite the headline, right?
The wide impact of video games means that little references can appear anywhere. In movies. During TV shows. In books. Or, in the case of Capcom&#x27;s Street Fighter II, as a hidden screen on a can depalletizer used in the brewing industry. Yes, you read that right.
Reddit poster RonnieBringIt has uploaded a video which shows him inputting a combination of commands into the Ska Fab Nimbus depallitizer&#x27;s HMI (Human Machine Interface) and getting rewarded with a screenshot from Capcom&#x27;s famous one-on-one fighter.

                    <span>Well the download did take a while...
Nintendo has been eager to emphasize that version 2.0 of Animal Crossing: New Horizons is the first and only &#x27;major&#x27; update to the game. We had various small updates previously of course, adding new events, items and themes, but today&#x27;s arrival was far more substantial. In addition to new characters, locations and features, it seems to have added a lot of items.
Datamining results shared on animalcrossingworld.com suggest the number of new items could be as high as 9000+. That&#x27;s crazy, but the number is currently being reviewed and debated, as it also depends on whether you count clones and new colour variations of existing items. In terms of items that are fully brand new, it could be more in the region of 1000+.

                    <span>&quot;How far would you go to score the ultimate gift?&quot;.
Remember the Power Glove? It was a mostly awkward means of interacting with games back during the NES era, and was immortalised in the 1989 Hollywood flick The Wizard. It&#x27;s since become something of a cult object in the world of gaming, inspiring adoration with older gamers (as well as a feature-length documentary), but this much-maligned peripheral is getting another chance of movie fame thanks to HBO&#x27;s upcoming festive flick, 8-Bit Christmas.
Set in the late &#x27;80s, the film tells the quest of one boy to get a Nintendo Entertainment System, the hottest item with any self-respecting child. But alas! The NES is sold-out everywhere, so ten-year-old Jake Doyle sets out on a mission to secure one.

The weeding process has been made a little easier in the new Animal Crossing: New Horizons update, thank Nookness! With the addition of Leif&#x27;s permanent shop on Harv&#x27;s Island, you can now buy flowers, bushes, crop seeds and saplings whenever you flippin&#x27; want.
But there&#x27;s a secret feature that we didn&#x27;t know about beforehand: Leif now has a weeding service! He&#x27;ll clean up your entire island, including all the weeds that are inaccessible and hidden, even, all in one go.

Famitsu&#x27;s Japanese chart figures are now in for the week ending 31st October, revealing that Mario Party Superstars has gone straight in at number one.
The game sold an estimated 163,256 physical copies in its opening week in Japan, managing to fend off several newcomers releasing this week. Among the other new titles was Super Robot Wars 30, which sold better on Switch than PS4, and Fatal Frame: Maiden of Black Water, which did the opposite.

While by now you&#x27;ve likely heard a lot about Intel Alder Lake on Windows and various leaked benchmarks with Windows 11, how does these processors with the new hybrid architecture work and perform on Linux?

Yes, EA CEO Andrew Wilson followed in Ubisoft&#x27;s footsteps by saying that he thought NFTs and play-to-earn would be &quot;an important part of the future of our industry.&quot;

The Sims 4&#x27;s Blooming Rooms kit feels designed for me. It&#x27;s one of Maxis&#x27;s new micro-DLCs, and it lets you pack rooms with flora without the need to keep the alive through knowledge or effort.

                    <span>Hey podcast fans. Mum’s away this week, which means the inmates have taken over the asylum once again. The temptation was to play another round of Sweeten The Deal, but instead Nate and I were good little podcast boys and delivered a surprisingly on point discussion of our favourite videogame adaptations of literary works. Well, I say ‘on point’; there’s a fair amount of discussion of new Dune, too, which is what got us thinking about successful book to screen journeys. Sadly, the House Atreides bagpipe band were not available for a rousing rendition of the podcast theme.
There’s also a micro Cavern of Lies in which things get biblical.

                    <span>Want to know which are the best guns in Call Of Duty: Vanguard? Recent Call Of Duty games have among the most complex weapon meta of any FPS games, thanks both to the sheer number of weapons and the absurd number of attachments you can use to customise each gun. Call Of Duty: Vanguard continues this trend in a big way, with 27 primary and 9 secondary weapons that you can unlock, customise, and experiment with.
We fully expect Call Of Duty: Vanguard&#x27;s weapon meta to evolve quickly with future updates and balance patches, but at the moment there is definitely a top tier of guns which have risen above the rest in effectiveness. Below we&#x27;ll walk you through the very best guns in the game and how to get the most power out of each one.

                    <span>I’ll admit I misjudged Forza Horizon 5 – not just the extent to which I’d enjoy it, but how much its searingly shiny visuals could justify the significantly heightened PC requirements. Well, lock me in one of this game’s hundreds of boots and take me away, because it’s both tonnes of fun and genuinely, magnificently gorgeous. Here’s how Forza Horizon 5 runs on PC, and which settings to tweak if you want a performance boost without cutting too deep into that top-notch fidelity.

                    <span>From Software and Bandai Namco have treated us to a new Elden Ring gameplay trailer, which showed off 15 glorious minutes of exploration. All I wanted was one laugh and I got it, from a rotund POT-BOY at that. Plus, it was narrated by a guy who sounded suspiciously like SoulsTuber VaatiVidya as the Tarnished trotted and fought and summoned and stealthed. Undoubtedly a showstopper of a trailer, but the higlight for me was how good the action sounded. And boy, it sounded good didn&#x27;t it?

                    <span>If you&#x27;re not too busy fawning over that new Elden Ring gameplay trailer (I don&#x27;t blame you, it&#x27;s very exciting), then I have some more exciting Soulsborne news for you - a PlayStation 1-esque demake of Bloodborne is coming out in January next year, and it looks excellent. Bloodborne PSX turns FromSoft&#x27;s gothic action-RPG into a low-poly spookfest, complete with crackly old sound effects and 16-bit music.

                    <span>Darkest Dungeon 2, the sequel to Red Hook Studio&#x27;s gothic roguelike, is a somewhat familiar affair. It&#x27;s dark, it&#x27;s tough, and a narrator likes to remind you of those things frequently. But this time around, we&#x27;re leaving the Ancestor&#x27;s squalid hamlet behind, and swapping it out for a stress-fueled stagecoach. Heroes are no longer cannon-fodder to send out on doomed expeditions, but vital team members who have stories to share and relationships to forge. 


I recently talked with creative director Chris Bourassa and design director Tyler Sigman about why they decided to take the game in this new direction, the difficulties of switching to a relationship-based affliction system, and why they&#x27;re excited to be working in early access again.

                    <span>How do you level up Trade Skills in New World? Trade Skills are non-combat skills in New World — just about any activity your character takes part in that isn&#x27;t tied to their weapons is linked to a Trade Skill. There are 17 of these skills in all, separated into three sub-categories: Gathering, Refining, and Crafting.

                    <span>Lost Ark is a free-to-play action RPG-inspired MMO that came out to great acclaim in Korea back in 2018. Now, Amazon Games are bringing its flashy, Diablo-like combat to the west in the form of a closed beta later today, and we&#x27;ve had an early sneak peek at it. Of course, what with Amazon&#x27;s own MMO New World now settling into its third month, not to mention Final Fantasy 14&#x27;s Endwalker expansion looming on the horizon, Lost Ark arrives at a busy time for fervent EXP grinders. The big question, then, is whether Lost Ark’s Diablo-y formula can do enough to compete with the already well-established MMO juggernauts. Judging by my few hours of hands-on time, I’m thinking it might, but only if you’re able to embrace its slow burn.

For main course, folks who buy it within a week of launch will get the Ogre Kingdoms DLC for free. And for dessert, it will be in Xbox Game Pass For PC. A fair meal, there. But here, come meet the Ogres in this new trailer below.

But Arte&#x27;s upcoming puzzling game, How To Say Goodbye, looks like a refreshingly playful take on loss. Not to mention that it’s a feast for the eyes. I mean, just LOOK at it.

It will present you with some of your fave maps from the likes of Bad Company 2 and the Battlefields of old, then let you tweak them as much as you please by adding various vehicles, rules and more. I&#x27;m personally hoping to see plenty of oldies with 2042&#x27;s sweet new grappling hook thrown in. Every map could be improved by a grappling hook.

                    <span>By now you’ve probably heard about how Intel’s 12th Gen Alder Lake CPUs shake up the previously stagnant Core line. Led by this, the Intel Core i9-12900K, Alder Lake sees the adoption of a hybrid architecture that combines high-power Performance cores (P-cores) with Efficiency cores (E-cores) that can free up headroom by taking on background tasks. The Core i9-12900K takes this opportunity to bulk up, combining eight P-cores and E-cores apiece for a total of 16 cores and 24 threads.

                    <span>The Intel Core i5-12600K is, in some ways, the CPU that Intel should have made three or four years ago. Ever since AMD’s Ryzen chips appeared with an alluring balance of gaming speed, desktop multitasking performance, efficiency, and affordability, Intel seemed to sink into a comfort zone of simply raising clock speeds and maybe adding a few cores. 


This was often enough to earn some half-throated recommendations for gaming builds specifically, but this past year proved that something needed to change, with the AMD Ryzen 5 5600X claiming the best gaming CPU title and 11th Gen Rocket Lake Intel chips – like the 5600X’s rival Core i5-11600K – looking thoroughly skippable. For those who did decide to wait until the 12th Gen Alder Lake launch, consider yourselves vindicated, as the Core i5-12600K is a great all-rounder: both a Ryzen-beater in games and, thanks to a long-overdue architecture revamp, a drastically better general purpose processor.

Some decisions can have large and unexpected consequences in Guardians Of The Galaxy, so a bit of foresight is worth having if you want the best outcome when deciding whether to pay the Nova Corps fine or not.

This quick guide will give you the answers to both these questions, with release times for various timezones, and download sizes across all platforms - including the optional high resolution assets pack for PC players.

                    <span>EA Sports PGA Tour won’t be hitting the green next Spring as promised. EA has announced its upcoming return to golf will arrive at a later date. 
When exactly? That’s not entirely clear. EA Sports PGA Tour never had a concrete release date, but EA’s statement simply states its shifting the launch to a later time and that it will tell us more about it later. The full statement reads as follows:
Hey golf fans, we wanted to let you know that we are shifting the launch date of EA Sports PGA Tour. We’re excited to bring championship golf to you and will be providing more information on our launch plans in the coming months.

EA Sports PGA Tour represents the publisher’s comeback to golf after a years-long hiatus. The game already boasts exclusive rights to the Master’s Tournament and features the PGA Championship, U.S. Open Championship, and The Open Championship. The game will also highlight the Ladies Professional Golf Association (LPGA) and feature one of their respective tournaments, the Amundi Evian Championship.
In other recent delay news, Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns was pushed to the back half of 2022, Platinum Games&#x27; arcade shooter Sol Cresta will now launch next year, and both Overwatch 2 and Diablo IV may not arrive until 2023 at the earliest.

                    <span>One of the most exciting things that can happen in gaming is the announcement of that sequel or spiritual successor you’ve been begging for. There’s no shortage of those kinds of announcements these days, but sometimes those announcements can feel like mistakes, particularly when a game is nowhere near ready. 
Sure, the hype is exciting, but there’s no real purpose to announcing a game years and years ahead of time other than marketing, of course. If a game enters what’s informally known as development hell, that announcement can sting a lot, both for the studio behind it and the fans excited about it. 
In Part 1 of this series, Game Informer detailed the development history of games like Pikmin 4, Dead Island 2, Skull &amp; Bones, and more. Part 2 explored the development hell of five more ga…</span>

                    <span>Square Enix has released its annual report for its 2021 fiscal year, which reflected on the games released during the initial months of the COVID pandemic. Marvel&#x27;s Avengers is revealed in the report to be considered &quot;not proven successful,&quot; though lessons were learned from the project.
Taking on a Games as a Service (or GaaS) model, Marvel&#x27;s Avengers was described as an &quot;ambitious title&quot; for Square Enix. The complications that come with planning for the long tail of a service-focused title with the shift to developers working from home compounded the challenges. &quot;We were able to surmount these challenges and release the game, but it has unfortunately not proven as successful as we would have liked,&quot; says Square Enix President Yosuke Matsuda in the report.

                    <span>Firaxis has announced that its superhero strategy game, Marvel’s Midnight Suns, won’t make its March release window. The game requires some more polish, so it will instead launch during the back half of 2022. A more exact date was not provided.
The studio tweeted a statement by creative director Jake Solomon explaining the delay. Simply put, the game needs more time in the oven to come together, and four months from now won’t be enough. “These extra months will be used to add more story, cinematics, and overall polish and will be essential in helping us make our vision a reality,” reads Solomon’s statement. You can read the full announcement in the tweet below.

November 3, 2021
Marvel’s Midnight Suns blends turn-based and deck-building gameplay with a story based on the ‘90s Midnight Sons story and team. Players control The Hunter, an original hero created by Marvel and Firaxis, who leads a team consisting of Doctor Strange, Blade, Captain America, Wolverine, Magik, and others against the evil Lilith. We recently featured it on the cover of Game Informer, and you can read deep-dive articles breaking down every facet of the game’s features and development in our coverage hub.
When it does launch, Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.</span>

                    <span>If you thought buying a Nintendo Switch was tough over this past year, that challenge is not going to let up anytime soon. 
That’s because Nintendo will be making 20% fewer Switch consoles than expected through March, according to a new report from Nikkei Asia. The 20% reduction translates to roughly 6 million fewer Switch consoles, as Nintendo originally planned to manufacture and ship 30 million Switch units by March. Nikkei Asia reports that the planned number has been reduced to 24 million.

As you might expect, the reason for this reduction in production is chips, or rather, the ongoing shortage of chips. The same chip shortage that has made buying video cards, new vehicles, PlayStation 5s, and Xbox Series X/S consoles is the same shortage affectin…</span>

                    <span>Honor of Kings, the extremely popular mobile MOBA, is getting a live-service, open-world spinoff game called Honor of Kings: World. 
This news comes by way of Kotaku, which reports that World will be following in the vein of Genshin Impact. It will have live-service components, a global launch, and locales and a narrative based on or at least inspired by Chinese mythology.

The new trailer, which launched over the weekend, features a gorgeous and flashy open world significantly more open than that seen in Honor of Kings...which makes sense considering Honor of Kings: World is meant to be an open world title. As noted by Kotaku, World will likely end up being massive – its MOBA predecessor, Honor of Kings, is one of the biggest games in the world, surpassing over 100 million daily players in 2020. 
It doesn’t hurt that it has Chinese entertainment conglomerate Tencent’s backing, too. Tencent originally wanted to make a mobile version of League of Legends, but Riot Games passed on it and so Honor of Kings was made by TiMi Studio instead. 
Similar to Genshin Impact, World appears to be a third-person action-RPG set in a fantastical world filled with different towns and cities, NPCs, enemies, and more. A release date for World has not been announced, but a worldwide launch is planned for multiple platforms, presumably PlayStation, Xbox, mobile, and PC platforms.

Among Trees was first revealed during The Game Awards in 2018 and launched in Early Access in June 2020. Set in a scenic, living forest, your task is to gather materials and food to survive. You’ll chop down trees to build a cabin, which you can upgrade by adding new rooms to unlock cooking, crafting, sewing, and gardening. Speaking of that last mechanic, you can construct an entire greenhouse to grow food to consume raw or use as ingredients for recipes. You can also build a hydration system and even a brewery.

The gorgeous world includes forests and caves. As peaceful as it looks, it’s not without its dangers. Predators such as bears roam its landscape, which you’ll need to avoid to prevent a The Revenant situation. If that’s too much excitement for your blood, a peaceful Zen mode allows you to enjoy Among Trees’ laid-back vibe without killer animals breathing down your neck. On the friendlier side, you can adopt and train a fox companion to help you locate valuable resources. 
FJRD says it plans to continue bug fixing throughout the year. Other than that, don’t expect any new significant features or content. After spending five years working on Among Trees, the team is excited for it to go 1.0 and begin transitioning to other projects. 
Among Trees will be available on Steam and the Epic Games Store for $14.99.</span>

                    <span>In early October, Xbox and Adidas partnered up to create a cool sneaker commemorating the 20th anniversary of the console. The downside: the shoe wasn’t for sale and could only be won in a contest. Fortunately for gamers and sneakerheads, the two companies are at it again, creating another console-inspired sneaker that you can purchase the old-fashioned way. 
Dubbed the Xbox 360 Forum Mid, the shoe draws aesthetic inspiration from, you guessed it, the Xbox 360. Like the original version of the console, the sneaker sports a predominantly white look with silver and lime-green accents. Eagle-eyed fans will notice the strap resembles the 360’s disc tray. The heel has elements referencing the removable hard drive and memory unit slots. These easter eggs are largely subtle; the Xbox button on the sides of the shoe is the only dead giveaway you’re wearing a console on your feet. The sneaker also comes with four extra laces in red, yellow, green, and blue. I’m sure you can guess the significance of those colors.

The Xbox 360 Forum Mid is a limited edition release. To snag a pair, you’ll need to visit adidas.com at 7 a.m. Pacific/10 a.m. Eastern on November 4 (tomorrow) and have $160.00 ready to spend. The shoe will only be sold in the U.S. and Canada.

                    <span>Elden Ring’s February release date is coming fast, and tomorrow, FromSoftware will showcase 15 minutes of gameplay. 
Any FromSoftware fan knows the struggle that has been anticipating Elden Ring – it was announced over two years ago during E3 2019, and after that, things went quiet. Then, information began to leak, such as concept art and a mysterious trailer. Finally, earlier this Summer, we got an extended look at Elden Ring and a January 2022 release date. The last morsel of news after that came last month when FromSoftware announced that Elden Ring had been delayed to February 25 and that closed network tests would happen this month. 
Now, it seems FromSoftware is ready to show some more of Elden Ring’s mysterious world. Tomorrow, the studio will release a “15-minute glimpse” of gameplay at 7 a.m. PDT/10 a.m. EST. 
Join us for a 15-minute glimpse of #ELDENRING gameplay on November 4th at 3 PM CET/7 AM PDT

November 3, 2021
As for what to expect, it’s anybody’s guess at this point, but 15 minutes is a meaty chunk of gameplay. We’ll likely see some of the horseback traversal featured in the game, some of its unique combat, and if one thing is certain, a horrific boss fight that will have everyone shaking in their armored boots. 
Only time will tell. Elden Ring will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on February 25. 
For more about it, read about how Elden Ring features a map and fast travel, and then check out this story about how the Moonlight Greatsword might be in the game. Read Game Informer’s breakdown of everything we know about Elden Ring after that.

                    <span>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate director Masahiro Sakurai isn’t thinking about a sequel Smash Bros. game, but he’s also not ruling one out...for now. 
Sakurai only just revealed Ultimate’s final fighter, Sora from Kingdom Hearts, last month and after over three years of DLC development, it was presumed that Sakurai would take a well-earned rest. It seems he’s doing that, but it hasn’t stopped him from speculating on the future of the Smash Bros. series.
In an issue of Japanese magazine Famitsu, Sakurai said he’s not currently thinking about a sequel to Ultimate, as reported by Video Games Chronicle. 
“I’m not thinking about a sequel,” Sakurai said to Famitsu. “But I can’t say that this is definitely the last Smash Bros.” 
Sakurai famously speculates on the future of Smash Bros. following the re…</span>

                    <span>Platinum Games’ vertical shoot ‘em up, Sol Cresta, which is a resurrection of a series over 30 years old, has been delayed.
This news comes by way of Platinum Games’ “Sol Cresta: Hideki Kamiya’s Very Sorry Stream,” which aired today, as reported by Eurogamer. The stream featured new gameplay of Sol Cresta, but Platinum&#x27;s chief game designer, Kamiya, also revealed that it would miss its December release date.

Kamiya said he does not have a new release date to reveal just yet, but he hopes to announce it early next year. 
Back when Sol Cresta was announced, it was revealed as a successor to Moon Cresta and Terra Cresta, vertical-scrolling arcade games originally developed by Nichibutsu. Sol Cresta will follow in the footsteps of previous Cresta games in that it will feature spaceships flying through galaxies, taking out enemies, and more in classic vertical-shooter arcade fashion. It will also allow players to dock with allies, just like the original games did nearly 40 years ago. 
At the time of Sol Cresta’s announcement back in August, Kamiya said “we want to make all kinds of games...not just action games.” Platinum Games is perhaps best known for what it does on the action side of gaming – Nier Automata, Astral Chain, Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance, to name a few – but it seems the studio is using Sol Cresta to prove it can do vertical shooters, too. 
As noted by Eurogamer, Kamiya’s stream featured gameplay of Sol Cresta’s new Caravan Mode, which is a five-minute score attack mode. Kamiya also debuted its opening cutscene, too. 
Sol Cresta was originally set to hit PlayStation, Nintendo Switch, and PC on December 9, but is now delayed to an unannounced date sometime in the future.

                    <span>How do Scenarios work in The Sims 4? There have been fan-made Sims challenges for as long as there have been Sims games, but now the makers of The Sims 4 have introduced Scenarios into official gameplay.

                    <span>Want to know whether you should buy the Disabler in Guardians Of The Galaxy? Whilst on Knowhere during Chapter 6, you can look around and partake in a bit of shopping. Whilst looking between the various stalls, you will find a merchant who offers to sell you a disabler that will supposedly remove the Nova Corps tracker from your ship. This would mean you don’t need to pay the Nova Corps fine that you incurred earlier in Chapter 2. However, Knowhere is a seedy place, and it’s hard to be certain whether you might get conned.
This guide will explain whether you should buy the disabler on Knowhere in Guardians Of The Galaxy, so that you can avoid any scams.

                    <span>Inscryption is good, very good. I mean, we&#x27;ve slapped a Bestest Best badge on it, like one of its in-game sigils. What effect does it have? Play the game and you&#x27;ll quickly realise it does things games aren&#x27;t supposed to do. Most notably, for me at least, Inscryption makes me feel like I&#x27;m actually playing a proper card game; that feeling of being present at a table, slapping cards down on its hard surface. I hadn&#x27;t realised how crucial this was to my enjoyment of CCGs, until now.

                    <span>Reader dear, I have to ask: do you try to get 100% collectables in games? Someone must, because games still have them. But I certainly don&#x27;t, and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve spoken about the subject with anyone who does. So, seeing as Psychonauts 2 has now released a patch with new features to help players collect every little doodad and tick off achievements, I want to ask: do you do this? Will you? Please tell me about it!

                    <span>You&#x27;d think being 1000 years old would earn you some respect, but in Demon Turf, that means you&#x27;re still a child. Admittedly, it makes for an intriguing premise in this tale of conquest and demonic shakedowns, but don&#x27;t be fooled. While its core systems take inspiration from 3D platformers of the N64 era, Demon Turf isn’t another Banjo Kazooie successor like publisher Playtonic&#x27;s Yooka-Laylee. You’ll find those familiar cliches, sure, but there’s something great about Fabraz’s latest effort that goes beyond its unique visuals.

Blizzard had never stated a release date for either game anyway, we only had a vague hint that they didn&#x27;t expect to launch them in 2021. Now, maybe 2023 at earliest?

                    <span>Jen Oneal is stepping down as co-lead of Blizzard Entertainment, just three months after she took the position. Since J. Allen Brack left the company in August, Oneal had been in charge of the studio with Mike Ybarra, who&#x27;ll now take the lead on his own. Oneal claims she&#x27;s not leaving because she&#x27;s &quot;without hope for Blizzard&quot;, but wants to &quot;do more to have games and diversity intersect, and hopefully make a broader industry impact that will benefit Blizzard (and other studios) as well.&quot;

                    <span>Card games are all the rage these days, so much so that even Yoko Taro of Nier: Automata fame is getting in on the action. Alas, if you’re expecting a similarly galaxy brain take on tabletop RPGs here, you’re going to be disappointed. Despite the creative minds behind it (Automata’s producer Yosuke Saito and composer Keiichi Okabe are also on board), Voice Of Cards: The Isle Dragon Roars is a decidedly simple role playing affair where its titular cards are nothing more than a fancy visual layer papering over a by-the-book tale of dungeons and, yes, a dragon. Inscryption this ain’t.

                    <span>Activision Blizzard&#x27;s landscape is everchanging in the wake of the lawsuit from the state of California regarding toxic workplace culture, and another big shift happened during the company&#x27;s quarterly earnings call. Jen Oneal, who was appointed co-lead of Blizzard with Mike Ybarra a few months ago, will step down and leave the company at the end of 2021. 
It is important to keep in mind what is going on within Activision Blizzard at this time regarding ongoing allegations about the work culture. The ongoing lawsuit from the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) against the company is over reported toxic workplace culture.

                    <span>We finally know when The Binding of Isaac’s gigantic Repentance expansion makes its way to consoles. Creator Edmund McMillen took to Twitter to announce the PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch versions launch this coming Thursday.
That’s November 4 if you don’t have a calendar nearby. In terms of specific platforms, Repentance is coming to PlayStation 5 and 4, Xbox Series X/S, and Switch. If you’re feeling left out on Xbox One, McMillen assured players the game will hit that console “not long after.” He also says to expect the physical retail versions down the line too.

November 2, 2021
The Binding of Isaac: Repentance launched on PC this past March. Though not a sequel, it’s a massive expansion to the original game (as well as its final update) that adds dozens of features and quality-of-life improvements. These include over 130 new items, over 5,000 new room designs, 100 additional enemies, and over 25 new bosses. You can also control two new playable characters and earn over 100 added achievements. Repentance even boasts a full alternate path with new chapters, final boss, and ending.

                    <span>While playing a game may sometimes be a short experience for players, hundreds, if not thousands, of work hours created it, even more so for longer titles. Game development is complicated, and crossing the finish line to hit release is a feat unto itself. 
However, sadly, not every game makes it across that line. A few end up somewhere informally known as “development hell.” It’s here that games might reside for months, years, or in some rare cases, over a decade. In Part 1 of this development hell series, we detailed the development history and path to development hell for five games – Pikmin 4, Skull &amp; Bones, Beyond Good and Evil 2, In the Valley of Gods, and Dead Island 2 – and below, in Part 2, we’ll examine five more.

                    <span>There&#x27;s a mystery afoot, and we need the assistance of our best detectives: The Game Informer community! 
Snorlax is known to slumber wherever it wants, usually blocking the paths up-and-coming trainers need to cross to continue their journey. Coaxing a Snorlax to wake up and get out of the way isn&#x27;t easy and usually requires the melody of a special flute to do the heavy lifting. This situation looks quite a bit different than your usual sleepover, though. It may be dangerous, innocuous, or even nefarious, but that&#x27;s up to you, dear reader! 
We&#x27;d love to hear what you think is happening in the image above involving the passed-out Snorlax on the train tracks with Yamper and Machamp surrounding the behemoth. Give us your best story in the comments!
You can work with the above picture to build your description of what in tarnation is happening. Below you can see three more angles at the scene, giving more context but begs even more questions like: 
Does Machamp think he can stop a speeding train with just a sign?

If you&#x27;re interested in owning this figure, it&#x27;s called the Delibird Holiday Express Snorlax Pass figure, one of many new holiday-themed items on the Pokémon Center online store. Two other figures complement the Snorlax Pass piece, but please don&#x27;t use those as part of your narrative in the comments. It&#x27;s far more fun to hear what creative ideas you come up with!

                    <span>Paid XP boosts will be removed from Marvel’s Avengers today following backlash from the player community, less than a month after they were first introduced. 
Before the launch of Marvel’s Avengers, Square Enix and Crystal Dynamics released a blog post in August of 2020 that stated: “content purchasable with real money in Marvel’s Avengers will be aesthetic-only additions.” Then, around the start of last month, paid XP boosts had been quietly introduced to the Avengers marketplace, and, as expected, players were not happy, as first reported by Video Games Chronicle.

                    <span>Coping with death and the grief that follows it is challenging and one of the few experiences everyone confronts sooner or later. How to Say Goodbye, an enchanting puzzle game from one of the minds of Monument Valley 2, finds an adorable, perhaps more palatable avenue for accepting loss. 
Players explore a world filled with spirits as the ghost of a recently departed person. According to publisher Arte France, the goal is to escape the “liminal space between life and death in which they are trapped.” That means sliding the floor and surrounding decor to guide the ghost through tricky environments to an exit. The grid-based areas allow horizontal and vertical movement, but you’ll also have to contend with dark spirits hindering your paths. Since many of the spirits are still grappling with the reality of their demise, escaping symbolizes the acceptance of your death by allowing yourself to move on.

How to Say Goodbye Comes from Florian Veltman, formerly a designer on Monument Valley 2 and Assemble with Care, and Baptiste Portefaix, an award-winning sound designer and composer. The game’s art direction draws inspiration from illustrated children’s books such as The Moomins, The Little Prince, and Where The Wild Things Are. How to Say Goodbye arrives sometime in 2022 for PC and Mac.

The company’s latest AR title, Pikmin Bloom, just launched this week. Today, though, Niantic and Portkey Games have announced that Harry Potter: Wizards Unite, one of the many AR games that launched over the years, will shut down on January 31, 2022. Before that, though, Wizards Unite will be removed from the Apple App Store, the Google Play Store, and the Samsung Galaxy Store on December 6. In-app purchases will end on that day as well.

Dubbed The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim – The Adventure Game, this board game is being created by Modiphius Entertainment as a tabletop RPG that features 12 hours of story content, and that’s just for players that take the golden path. Add in unique story choices, character roleplay, different play styles, and more, and its playtime stretches to dozens of hours.

That’s because Zombies’ Main Quest won’t be available in Vanguard at launch, as first reported by IGN. More specifically, it seems like the Main Quest won’t be in full swing until after Vanguard’s Season One, which begins on December 2.

                    <span>There&#x27;s a segment in a 2003 episode of radio series This American Life from 2003, in which a man named Dan Fitzsimons talks about a cable television channel he tried to launch in the &#x27;90s. It was the &quot;Puppy Channel&quot;. A 24/7 broadcast of nothing but puppies. 

At the time, no cable provider liked the idea enough to make it happen, but I think about the story a lot. I think about it on days like today, on which Twitch has just introduced a new &quot;Animals, Aquariums, and Zoos&quot; category to the livestreaming platform.

                    <span>&quot;Storm Point. It&#x27;s a place where dreams come true,&quot; says a character at the end of Apex Legends&#x27; Escape mode trailer. Given the two preceding minutes, presumably the dreams have to involve being fired into the sky and then stabbing a bunch of dudes.

Apex Legends&#x27; new season, including Storm Point map and new character Ash, are all live now.

Today, Square Enix announced that they were removing the boosters, while apologising &quot;for not responding sooner&quot; to players&#x27; concerns.

Finally, the big&#x27;un has arrived: Minecraft. Both the original Java and cross-platform Bedrock versions of Minecraft arrived on Microsoft&#x27;s subscription service today, packaged into a unified launcher. This comes ahead of plans to give all PC Minecrafters access to both versions next year.

                    <span>In true Shadow Tactics fashion, here’s an expansion no one saw coming. Aiko’s Choice is a miniature campaign extension to 2016’s real-time tactics wonder. A standalone title, but one that slots into the original game’s main story. It feels like a DLC package that should have been released closer to the original, but I’m not going to drag developers Mimimi for tardiness - after all, this is a game where it takes me upwards of three hours to creep around a single map. Nothing about Shadow Tactics is rushed.

                    <span>Riders Republic is a multiplayer open world sports game developed by Ubisoft Annecy, in which every single character talks like they’re your mum’s new boyfriend after they find a bong in your sock drawer. And, hey, like, we get it, y’know, we all like to “hang loose” on Tik Tok sometimes, but – at this point Gareth the 43-year-old divorcé grabs a chair, spins it 180 degrees and sits on it in one smooth motion – dope just isn’t on fleek, fam.
Insufferable cutscenes aside, this is a thrilling downhill racing simulator in which you, a new arrival to a vast landscape of snowy peaks, scorched desert badlands, towering forests and rain-lashed mud flats, must repeatedly hurl yourself down the side of a mountain faster or more stylishly than your opponents. The world is a compressed version of California with all of the San Franciscos taken out, leaving just a bizarre population of baggy jeans wearing Urban Dictionary acolytes, and a vast interconnected series of freely roamable tracks and wilderness littered with activities to complete and landmarks to discover.

                    <span>When I first heard about it, I didn&#x27;t think Unpacking would appeal to me. Released today, it&#x27;s a chill game about unpacking moving boxes, unloading all the items from someone&#x27;s life into their new home. I&#x27;ve never liked unpacking in real life, it feels stressful and annoying trying to find space for all my stuff. But I&#x27;m starting to think that Unpacking (the game) might make me feel better about it. Perhaps next time I move house, I should go into it with the energy of this relaxed puzzler.

When it&#x27;s time to rumble in CK3, it&#x27;ll generate a Bannerlord battle based on your armies for you to fight in-person, then transfer the results back into CK3. Immensely impressive.

Barone says Haunted Chocolatier will have &quot;a greater focus on combat&quot; than Stardew, and has provided some detail on how the chocolate game&#x27;s battles will work.

                    <span>Like anyone, I went into Echo Generation knowing it would be riding on Stranger Things’ coattails. With its young cast and retro, small town setting, this is a game that definitely falls into that familiar “gang of boys plus maybe someone’s girlfriend going on an occult adventure” vein of 80s nostalgia fests like The Goonies and It. But the question was, would it be an inspired homage to the Upside Down, or a cash grab with a voxel paint job designed to lure in &#x27;the youth&#x27;? The answer, sadly, is neither.

The event dubbed RiotX Arcane starts today, with the official kickoff beginning on November 6 at the League of Legends World Championship.
This upcoming “Super Weekend” will include World Championship tournament play and the premiere of Arcane episode one at 5:30 p.m. Pacific on Saturday. It will be the first Netflix show to have a simultaneous debut on Twitch, which fans can watch on Riot’s page or co-streamed on other content creators’ Twitch channels. The remaining two episodes of Arcane will be released weekly on Netflix.

                    <span>It’s a story as old as time. 
Someone claims to love PlayStation trophies – even though they don’t have the platinum for Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker – finds out a game they want to play doesn’t have trophies, and they go online and pester those hardworking indie developers until trophies get added. In this case, that person is Greg Miller, whom some (very few, probably) know from IGN and Kinda Funny. Most people would know him as the photographer of washed-up hero, Shirtless Spider-Man. 
Young Horses, the developers behind Bugsnax, excitedly tweeted out its new trailer for its upcoming Isle of Bigsnax DLC, shortly after the trailer aired during last week’s PlayStation State of Play showcase. Excited, happy, joyful – the trailer was live. Lo and behold, who appears in their mentions? Gre…</span>

                    <span>Video games are incredibly hard to make. Be it the cost to create them, the staff needed to actually develop a game, or something else behind the scenes, a lot can happen to take it off course. While it’s sad for players, developers know best what their game needs, and time is almost always something developers could use more of. Sometimes, though, time can’t fix everything, and in those cases, games can find themselves stuck in what’s known informally as “development hell.” 
This is a term used to describe games seemingly stuck in development forever. No matter what those development teams do, more and more barriers get in the way, and all of a sudden, a game misses its release date by a couple of months, then a year, then multiple years, and in some unfortunate cases, we just don’t ever …</span>

                    <span>PlayStation Now subscribers have a new batch of games to play this month. Four games join the library tomorrow, November 2, and can be played via cloud streaming or installed directly to a console. 
Mafia: Definitive Edition headlines November’s round-up. This ground-up remake of the classic Mafia was released in September 2020 and coats the 2002 sandbox title with the Mafia III engine&#x27;s paint. Don’t worry if you’re a purist; Mafia still retains its classic design, for better or worse. You can read our review of the game here. Mafia: Definitive Edition exits PS Now on February 28.
In its wake comes the goofy party game Totally Reliable Delivery Service, a role-playing classic in Final Fantasy IX, and 2017’s critically acclaimed platformer, Celeste. These three titles will be available on the service until further notice. 
The Last of Us Part II joined PS Now last month and, like Mafia, is only available for a limited time. Thankfully, you still have until January to play that one. Meanwhile, if you&#x27;re more of a PlayStation Plus kind of person, here&#x27;s the list of &quot;free&quot; games you can download beginning this month. 
Are you a PlayStation Now subscriber, and if so, what do you think of November’s additions? Let us know in the comments!</span>

The ongoing lawsuit from the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) against the company is over reported toxic workplace culture. The bulk of the suit focuses on &quot;violations of the state&#x27;s civil rights and equal pay laws,&quot; specifically regarding the treatment of women and other marginalized groups. To learn more about the proceedings thus far, including details listed in the lawsuit against Activision Blizzard, please check out our previous coverage here.

As we step into November, it’s not just the leftover Halloween candy we can’t wait to get our hands on. Recent news from one of the scene’s biggest developers has us feeling warm down to our toes, indies are getting a new stage, and on top of it all, we’re positively rolling in game releases.

Fall is all about transformation, but who would have known Stardew Valley developer Eric Barone AKA ConcernedApe, would get so into the spirit when dropping the first real details of his follow-up title?  And that’s not all.

Bloodborne PSX coder b0tster (on Twitter) announced yesterday that it would be releasing on January 31, 2022. She included a new trailer showcasing some familiar Yharnam haunts and enemies in it, too. You can check that out below:

It&#x27;s important to note that it&#x27;s still unclear how people will be able to play this game. There&#x27;s almost no way this comes to PlayStation, so PC is the likely destination. It’s also unclear if players have to pay for it. Actually, selling this demake (rather than just releasing it for free) may invite Sony and/or FromSoftware to come in with the copyright infringement hammer. Although, b0tster …</span>

                    <span>New World has temporarily disabled &quot;all forms of wealth transfers&quot; due to an exploit that allows players to duplicate gold. In a post on the game&#x27;s forum, a community manager warned that punishments would be served to players who used the exploit.

                    <span>With Halloween behind us, it&#x27;s time to ask: is the 1st of November too early to put up Christmas lights? Is it a grim sign of ravenous consumerism, or a welcome respite from the watching the year die slowly and painfully in its final months? As I untangled my strings of LED lights this morning, I realised that PC gaming is the most Christmassy of gamings. The colourful LEDs people cram into their PC&#x27;s every orifice and pore aren&#x27;t just any decoration, they&#x27;re Christmas lights. That&#x27;s their purpose. It always has been. Christmas is year-round for PC gamers. So here it is: merry Christmas.

                    <span>I almost don&#x27;t want to tell you what The End Of Dyeus is. Surprise and discovery are among the things I enjoy most in games, and they&#x27;re too often undermined in the modern age. Damned kids, with your wikis and your hashed tags. It&#x27;s a first person fighting and exploration game that drops you in a pastoral fantasy world with no instruction beyond &quot;find Dyeus&quot; and some straightforward control explainers. The only thing I dislike is that I have no idea how to pronounce it, dramatically limiting my pun options.

                    <span>Spooky season might be behind us now, but man, it’s still pretty scary out there. My inbox sits at 576 unread emails, and in another tab I’m browsing heated clothes airers; things that I now realise are frighteningly expensive. But it’s not just mundane things in real life that give me goosebumps, it now extends to virtual white goods as well.
Right, so, there’s this fridge in Marvel’s Guardians Of The Galaxy and no matter how many times I close it, it won’t stay shut. At first it was funny, but it’s since morphed from a sly chuckle to a howl of agony. My relationship with the game is like that thing Yoda from Star Wars says, “Fear leads to the Dark Side”. Well, I’m almost there, let me tell you.

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/weird-west-is-a-smooth-smooth-ride-through-a-rough-rough-place">

                    <span>Even though I’ve been dead excited about Weird West since its announcement last summer, when the time finally came for me to play a preview build last week, I found myself unusually hesitant. Primarily, this was because I loved the game’s concept so much (“What if Dishonored and Desperadoes III had a rooting tooting baby, then let it watch way too many horror movies?”), that I didn’t really want to face the possibility that developers WolfEye Studios might have fallen short on it. But more than that, I was worried I’d have to… well, make an effort.


For whatever reason, my enthusiasm to start new games has been taking one of its periodic dips over the last month or so, leaving me in the comforting arms of old favourites I can play on autopilot. Time and time again, I’ll get right to the point of hitting play on something, before convincing myself - completely unreasonably - that it’ll probably be a load of hassle for moderate reward. And however promising a sprawling, top-down immersive sim set in a world of haunted stetsons sounded, I was certain it would involve a lot of fiddling about with inventories, reading long screeds of text, and going on sidequests.


I’m delighted to say, however, that I was completely wrong. Because while Weird West does involve all those things (and features even more emergent complexity than the hefty dose I’d anticipated, to boot) I have not had a smoother time getting into a game in a long while. The build I played only featured one of the game’s five character campaigns, admittedly. But unless the other four are all set in a Tesco car park or something, I can heartily recommend it to you.

                    <span>Battlefield 2042 has a new trailer ahead of its November 19th release, and this one is aimed directly at us PC folk. While the action itself is more of the near-future mega-bangs you’ve probably seen in previous teasers (or, indeed, the open beta), it’s all in service of demonstrating the PC-exclusive features: chiefly ray tracing, Nvidia DLSS and Nvidia Reflex support.

Bandai Namco have since publicly announced the next game in Supermassive&#x27;s interactive horror story series, explaining a bit more of what&#x27;s going on with the animatronic corpse. Bad news for would-be survivors: it&#x27;s set in a replica of the infamous &#x27;Murder Castle&#x27;, a hotel built with traps and torture chambers by American serial killer H. H. Holmes.

                    <span>The reason I enjoy Riot&#x27;s FPS Valorant so much is because it has an excellent mixture of fun abilities and tactical gunplay, which is why I&#x27;m not sure what to make of its new character. Chamber is a French weapons designer who&#x27;s set to arrive in the game&#x27;s next Act on November 16th, and his abilities mostly involve spawning weapons. Not weapons you can buy normally in-game, but special weapons that he&#x27;s made himself. Somehow, this feels like cheating.

                    <span>I hope you like animosity. Darkest Dungeon 2 will eat your eyes and call you selfish for wanting them back. The ferocity with which it treats its players shouldn’t be a surprise to anyone who clawed their way through the crypts of the first Darkest Dungeon, a turn-based homage to Lovecraft and slow-acting poison. It especially won’t surprise anyone who bled their way through the early access version of that game, either. A lot of the difficulty and madness in the sequel comes not from the dangerous creatures along its roguelike turnpike, but from the roughly shorn design of a road trip yet to be completed. This is a faithfully despondent, sometimes frustrating journey of attrition, decay and distrust. A journey you should maybe put off until the wobblesome wagon has all its wheels tightened.

                    <span>The clocks have gone back and the cold is creeping in, so now it&#x27;s time for me to get too excited too early for the winter speedrunning event Awesome Games Done Quick. While it&#x27;s too early for the full schedule right now, organisers have revealed the current list of accepted games, and there are already some absolute belters. A race to beat every Dark Souls boss and Deathloop&#x27;s first GDQ outing are amongst the highlights. But the one I&#x27;m most looking forward to is a blindfolded Sekiro run. I couldn&#x27;t finish that game even using my eyes.

                    <span>Marc Radinovic vytvořil zařízení, které kontroluje řidiče, jestli při zatáčení používá blinkry. Senzorem jsou dva Arduino Nano 33 BLE moduly. Používá se jejich vestavěný akcelerometr ke zjištění polohy volantu a páčky blinkrů. Senzory pomocí BLE komunikují s Arduino UNO WiFi deskou. Ta je sériově pomocí USB propojena s Raspberry Pi 4.</span>

There are hay people hunting you in the night, monstrous masks inspired by traditional Swiss carnival costumes, and the decapitated head of the goat Allegria, bleating and chattering from your backpack. 


Many horror games either try to establish a sense of mundane familiarity in a recognisable, contemporary world before shattering that familiarity, or else rely on the dusty, done-to-death setting of haunted manors. In most cases, neither approach does much to surprise. Horror often relies on the grotesque, but Mundaun’s weirdness is different. It is an earthy kind of weirdness, a strangeness with roots so deep that it might be confused with familiarity. It’s a horror that smells not of blood, but of hay and dung, snow and soot.

                    <span>By the time you read this I&#x27;ll be playing Back 4 Blood, gunning down hordes of the undead until viscera and gore cake my player’s clothes, and my eyes become infinite pools of horror that have seen more than enough death for one lifetime. Or perhaps I’ll be creeping around a haunted house in Phasmophobia, my smudge stick in-hand and a cavalcade of petrified friends whimpering down their mics. Maybe I’ll be running from Pyramid Head in Dead By Daylight with my pals in tow. A thought has been brewing in the cold recesses of my mind for a while now, and it is simply this: when did horror become a team game?

                    <span>Happy Halloween weekend, gang! Oh, hang on, I meant to say: BOO! Alright, there we go. But the greatest horror this weekend isn&#x27;t any ghost or ghoulie, it&#x27;s UK clocks switching back to GMT this weekend. Sure, your phone and computer will automatically update, but your heating will be irksome until you again dig out the manual to remember how to change it. And a secondary blast of horror comes from the fact that not every country changes their clocks just yet, so if you deal with business across timezones... good luck, pal. But, what are you playing this weekend?

                    <span>Ever since I witnessed a little red-and-blue plumber-man tumble into the gnashing jaws of a Piranha Plant, I knew vegetables weren’t to be trusted. I see my suspicion of all things green and floral as a natural, even instinctual thing. We ourselves aren’t vegetable, and differences so often motivate our deepest fears. The vegetal realm is entirely inaccessible to us, its behaviour strange and habitats dark. From the carnivorous Venus flytrap to the bleeding tooth fungus, from plants that smell like rotting corpses to one&#x27;s that trap prey and dissolve them with digestive fluids, it’s an unknown, often dangerous world, and one that overlaps closely with our own. And it makes for a compelling game.

                    <span>Want to know how to convince the Worldmind in Guardians Of The Galaxy? The adventure to save the galaxy doesn’t just involve shooting Chitauri and cracking jokes. Throughout Guardians Of The Galaxy, you engage in conversations with various characters, in which you can make decisions that will alter the course of the game. Most of these have small, fairly insignificant consequences. However, the conversation with the Worldmind in Chapter 9 could help you get some crucial help in a difficult fight later in the game.
This guide will show you the correct choices to make to convince the Worldmind that Raker can be defeated in Guardians Of The Galaxy.

                    <span>Steam user genre tags can be awful. Cyberpunk 2077 was, for example, tagged ‘masterpiece’ for months before the first gameplay trailer, while the much more reasonable and catchy ‘looks cool sure but too early to say anything definitive if we’re being adults about it’ tag was strangely absent. Happily, they are sometimes wonderful, like the tag alongside ‘comedy’ and ‘indie’ that categorises avian arsehole adventure Untitled Goose Game as having a ‘villain protagonist’. 


I’ve been thinking about villain protagonists a fair amount this week because GOG just graced our collective thinking tellies with 1996 Zelda-like Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain, in all its richly overwrought, gothic, inimitably voice-acted splendour. I would estimate this news finds you, reader, in one of two categories: those who give not a fig, and those who give so many figs they are currently scrabbling the world’s few remaining fig-bearing trees, searching vainly for an adequate quantity of figs.

                    <span>Want to know how many chapters there are in Guardians Of The Galaxy? This planet-hopping adventure takes you on the cosmic ride of your life in an original Guardians Of The Galaxy story, involving plenty of punching, shooting, and generally jumping around with jet boots. Throughout the adventure, you&#x27;ll come across many classic characters, such as Cosmo the spacedog, Adam Warlock, Mantis, Fin Fang Foom, and Lady Hellbender. However, since it isn&#x27;t based directly on a certain comic storyline or movie, it can be hard to judge how long you&#x27;ll actually spend playing Marvel&#x27;s Guardians Of The Galaxy.
This guide will break down how many chapters there are in Guardians Of The Galaxy, and explain how long it will take to beat the game.

                    <span>Halloweekend is almost upon us and sitting on my coffee table is my battered old paperback copy of Skeleton Crew, a 1985 collection of short horror stories by Stephen King. Back in my wild teenage years I binged King&#x27;s entire back-catalogue of published fiction, and now that it&#x27;s been long enough for me to have forgotten most of the details, I&#x27;m treating myself to some selective re-reads. Fair to say some of his stuff hasn&#x27;t aged brilliantly, but despite many rough edges he undeniably remains one of my all-time favourite authors. I am, after all, a self-confessed horror nerd.

                    <span>I hesitated. Not to play The Riftbreaker, you understand. I&#x27;d played its demo last year, which was enough to sell me on playing the full game. But to cover it as a strategy game is another matter.
It does games in particular a disservice to get prescriptive with genre, but there&#x27;s no question that Riftbreaker falls under &#x27;action strategy&#x27;, with an even greater emphasis on action than, say, Hostile Waters or Sacrifice. But then, it also has detailed base building, tower defence, and a tonne of resource management. I&#x27;ve given up trying to categorise it, and it will always be distinct from most strategy games, but I think its peers could still learn a few things from it.

                    <span>The company behind Facebook and Oculus, previously known as Facebook, have unveiled a new name: Meta. Oh christ. Yes, it is named after the metaverse, because tech megacorps can&#x27;t resist the delusion that their platform to sell adverts is elevating humanity to a new plane of existence. Mark Zuckerberg suggests that in the future they&#x27;re building, you&#x27;ll experience everything through virtual and augmented reality, and that definitely won&#x27;t be a horrible world devoid of intimacy, okay, it&#x27;ll be great.

                    <span>The WD Black SN750 is a super-fast PCIe 3.0 SSD - and the 1TB model is down to £87 at Amazon UK, a historic low price. That&#x27;s a fantastic price for what was once among the fastest NVMe SSDs on the planet, with read speeds up to nearly 3500MB/s... before the advent of faster (and more expensive) PCIe 4.0 drives in the last couple of years. 
Still, in terms of value for money, this TLC drive with a DRAM cache is going to be hard to beat - especially as the only real competitors tend to come with QLC NAND or without a DRAM cache, both of which sacrifice performance to hit lower price points!

That&#x27;s an incredibly good price considering this is the model that comes with a handy charging dock to ensure your mouse is always topped up without ever fussing with a cable.

Key points include a policy of zero-tolerance for harassment and an end to forced abitration in claims of sexual harrassment and discrimination. An employee group call this &quot;a huge win&quot;. And Kotick himself has volunteered to take a huge pay cut until they achieve their stated goals.

                    <span>Apex Legends&#x27; next season, Escape, kicks off next week, and it introduces the new playable character Ash. She&#x27;s a simulacrum (read: human brain in robot body) that you might recognise as the evil pilot from Titanfall 2&#x27;s Into The Abyss level, or as the overseer of Apex Legends&#x27; 3v3 Arenas mode. Now she&#x27;s descending into the Apex games herself, and having taken her for a spin already, I reckon she has some delightfully aggressive abilities that Wraith players in particular are going to enjoy.

Below we&#x27;ll walk you through how each of Ash&#x27;s abilities work in detail, so you can get off to a great start with her once Season 11 drops. We&#x27;ll also detail Ash&#x27;s backstory for those who need to know every last detail about this dangerous new Legend.

The CAR is Season 11&#x27;s addition to the Apex Legends weapons arsenal, and it&#x27;s got a very impressive array of stats to show off. But what&#x27;s truly unique about the CAR is its ability to use both Heavy and Light Ammo, and toggle between them at the touch of a button.
Keep reading for an in-depth look at the CAR SMG in Apex Legends, along with detailed stats covering everything from damage profiles and shots to kill to reload times and attachment slots.

It&#x27;s also bringing a the new Legend Ash, the CAR SMG and more, but most importantly: beach map! I had a chance to play a little of Respawn&#x27;s battle royale in this new arena, and it is delightful. Named Stormpoint, it&#x27;s the FPS&#x27;s fourth map, and not only is it lovely to look at, but it&#x27;s full of cool locations to explore and dangerous wildlife to dodge.

                    <span>Daniel Mullins says he&#x27;s not sure that &quot;horror&quot; is the most accurate way to describe his gruesome new card battler Inscryption. He immediately follows this up by telling me a friend of his had nightmares because of the menacing figure you play cards against, so yeah, maybe it&#x27;s a bit horror-like. But I kind of understand his point. 


At the start, Inscryption is like a hostage situation, where you&#x27;re forced to play a card-based roguelike against a sinister games master. Then, just as you start getting the hang of things, the game evolves into something way more complex. If you&#x27;ve played Mullins&#x27; other games you&#x27;ll know his work can go to some weird, meta places. I won&#x27;t say more above the cut, because I&#x27;d hate to spoil it. But for those of you who&#x27;ve already played, read on for more detail on how Mullins created an excellently unsettling world.

                    <span>Recently, I&#x27;ve heard tales of Far Cry 6 players receiving snarky emails from Ubisoft about how much time they&#x27;ve spent in-game. They&#x27;re supposed to read as if Anton Castillo, the game&#x27;s evil dictator, is mocking you for not investing enough of it toppling his regime.
And even if you&#x27;ve spent a lot of time clearing Castillo&#x27;s map markers, he&#x27;ll still send you emails anyway. They feature stats like time played, checkpoints cleared, that sort of thing. Many people don&#x27;t seem to like this, which I totally understand. But a part of me wishes these rude marketing emails were more of a thing. Specifically, I&#x27;d like it if the bugs from Hollow Knight spun some my way.
