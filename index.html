                    <span>The International Game Developers Association has been an outspoken critic of the culture at companies like Ubisoft and Activision Blizzard that has led to so many lawsuits, departures and firings over the last few years. Yet a report today by GI.Biz says that the group has failed to act on its own internal problems.

                    <span>If NFTs are a scam—and they are, I’m just going through the rhetorical motions in building a sentence here—then The Sandbox is one of the biggest engines driving them in the video game space. So it makes perfect sense that it’s the location for Ubisoft’s next foray into the world of all this bullshit.

                    <span>Update: Boba Fett has assembled an army in his Disney+ series, and his hired help is also following him into Fortnite. If you venture into the game&#x27;s item shop today, you can purchase skins of Boba Fett&#x27;s trusted right hand, Fennec Shand, and the wookiee bounty hunter, Krrsantan.
You can also purchase Fennec&#x27;s starship as a glider and a &quot;This is the way&quot; emote that audibly says the famous line. All of these skins and items are offered in a bundle for a reduced price. Like all licensed skins, these won&#x27;t be in the shop for long before being retired. If you missed out on Boba Fett the first time around, he&#x27;s back with his Firespray glider. You can also add a stormtrooper to your ranks.

The ongoing lawsuit from the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) against the company is over reported toxic workplace culture. The bulk of the suit focuses on &quot;violations of the state&#x27;s civil rights and equal pay laws,&quot; specifically regarding the treatment of women and other marginalized groups.

It has been revealed that the investment firm that manages the wealth of Nintendo’s founders has purchased a majority stake in the North America-based Taiyo Pacific Partners.
The Kirkland, Washington &#x27;activist fund&#x27; is &quot;dedicated to friendly shareholder activism&quot; in Japanese equities, and manages more than $3.7 billion in Japan and India-focused funds, according to Bloomberg. It will become a part of the Yamauchi No. 10 Family Office, which Banjo Yamauchi founded in 2020 to manage assets previously owned by his grandfather, former Nintendo President Hiroshi Yamauchi, who passed away in 2013.

                    <span>The popular video game music channel has now shutdown.
Over the past few weeks, the popular video game music YouTube channel GilvaSunner was hit with thousands of copyright blocks from Nintendo. It resulted in the creator of the channel shutting it down last Friday.
While there&#x27;s not much else to say about the outcome, there were some theories on social media that the copyright claims weren&#x27;t the real deal and didn&#x27;t actually come from Nintendo. One tweet, in particular, suggested the claims were &quot;most likely not from Nintendo&quot; and generated over 23k Likes.

Video game emulators aren&#x27;t always seen in the best light, but they actually play an important role when it comes to video game preservation and the revival of classics on modern hardware.
With this in mind, MAME (Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator) has just turned 25 years old, after making its debut on 5th February 1997. If you&#x27;re not familiar with it, in short - it can play many different arcade titles, across multiple different platforms.

There&#x27;s a lot to love about Bandai Namco in terms of the games it releases, but one thing that hasn&#x27;t gone down so well is the company&#x27;s logo refresh - originally revealed last October and scheduled to come into effect in April this year.
While the Japanese publisher responsible for series like PAC-MAN, Tekken and Tales is still going ahead with this makeover, it has now made one slight adjustment. As detailed in its latest mid-term plan (April 2022 - March 2025), the speech bubble outline has been changed from magenta to red.

Last week, I noticed my hand was sore. I didn&#x27;t think much of it, mostly because I wasn&#x27;t sure why it would be hurting. On Monday, while playing OlliOlli World, I found my reason. I&#x27;m not sure there&#x27;s a better way to recommend World than that; it pushed my hands to their limit. 
Compared to the previous two OlliOlli games, which could be prohibitively difficult, World is simultaneously an easy-to-approach 2D skateboarding game with an impossibly high skill ceiling. Early on, the game does a great job quickly teaching you the basics of its trick systems (mostly tied…</span>

                    <span>Lost Ark launches for Western audiences this week, with its three-day early access event starting today. Amazon Games, the publisher bringing Tripod Studios and Smilegate&#x27;s RPG to the west, has been kind enough to let some of the press in a little early to play on a private server, so I&#x27;ve had my hands on the action-RPG MMO for a few weeks now. Much of the game was in place when I played, although I was missing a very big aspect of it: the broader social component. Because of the small sample size of players, all of my time in the world of Arkesia was by my lonesome. So, for now, I&#x27;m not comfortable dropping my final assessment on Lost Ark. Instead, here are some of my thoughts on this impressive free-to-play title after playing pre-release.
At launch, Lost Ark features five broader class …</span>

Mastering a martial art takes years – if not a lifetime. Disciples must hone their bodies to the point that they perform every attack, every counter, every movement with pinpoint precision. A skilled warrior must move without thinking. Likewise, mastering Sifu&#x27;s combat system takes a high degree of dedication and practice. Like a true martial artist, you must push through the practice pains before you reap any rewards.
In 2017, Sloclap released the martial arts-themed action/RPG Absolver, which let players design their own combat system as they battled other online players in a …</span>

                    <span>WWE 2K22 launches on March 11 and Visual Concepts/2K have slowly begun rolling out roster reveals. Every wrestling fan knows that the quality of the roster makes or breaks any wrestling game but that&#x27;s become especially crucial for 2K22. The game arrives in the wake of a pandemic era that saw over 100 wrestlers fired by WWE, leaving fans worried and skeptical about who&#x27;s left to plug up the holes. 
Using 2K’s official roster list, as well as combing through trailers and marketing materials, we’ve put together a list of over 70 confirmed superstars for WWE 2K22. It’s worth noting that 2K’s own roster lacks names that have appeared in trailers while other faces have been confirmed via their character portraits instead of an in-game model. We&#x27;re also sure you can use this list to connect the dots on who will appear that have not been formally announced (Tyler Bate would be lonely without his Mustache Mountain partner, Trent Seven, after all). We’ll update this list as new wrestlers are announced, but here’s how the roster is shaping up so far:
AJ Styles
Damien Priest
Kane
Sami Zayn
Note: Jeff Hardy and Samoa Joe were previously confirmed, but given both have since been released from WWE, there&#x27;s a good chance they’re no longer in the game.

A console exclusive for PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4, Sifu has also been released on the Epic Games Store on PC, and if you preordered or purchased the standard edition, which costs $39.99, you can now play the game. Of course, if you preordered the deluxe edition, which carried with it a $49.99 price tag, you’ve been able to play Sifu since Sunday as that edition granted players early access. 
To celebrate news of Sifu’s launch today, Sloclap has released a launch trailer that showcases what to expect: striking visuals, dope music, and of course, plenty of enemies to punch and kick down to the ground.

“Unfolding a story born from loss, the newly released launch trailer finally reveals the violent spark that has laid the path for a fiery journey, fueled by anger and devastation,” a press release for Sifu reads. “Introducing the five main enemies you will seek out in your quest for redemption, today’s trailer showcases a jolting array of authentic Pak Mei Kung Fu action as the main character, which players can play as male or female, slides through a variety of enemies with skillful, mindful combat.” 

After watching today’s new trailer, be sure to read our thoughts on the game in Game Informer’s Sifu review. Check out this gameplay from Game Informer’s New Gameplay Today segment all about Sifu after that.

                    <span>Pokémon Go is celebrating Valentine&#x27;s Day in a couple of different ways. From February 10 through 14, you&#x27;ll have the chance to engage in new events and catch Flabébé for the first time.
This fairy-type Pokémon rides atop a flower and can evolve twice. If you feed it 25 candies, it will transform into Floette. Offer up another 100 candies and it&#x27;ll become Florges, but only after you earn 20 hearts with it as a buddy. Flabébé is from Generation VI and is number 669 on the Pokédex.
During the event, you&#x27;ll also be able to evolve Furfrou in a new way. If you feed it 25 candies and 10,000 stardust, you can select the Heart Trip to give it a festive Valentine&#x27;s Day design.
Along with the Pokémon of note, you&#x27;ll also find the usual suspects out in the wild. This list includes Luvdisc, Chansey, Plusle, Minun, Miltank, Audino, Alomomola, Woobat, Volbeat, and Illumise. All of them have shiny variants, too. Registeel will be the only Pokémon in five-star raids, with Mega Houndoom being the lone Mega Raid.
Spinda is returning to field research tasks, this time rocking a heart pattern. Spinda can also be shiny.
Good luck on the hunt, trainers!</span>

                    <span>Dying Light 2 hit consoles and PC just last week, launching to record numbers for Techland’s zombie parkour franchise. Now, a week later, Eurogamer’s Poland-based site, Eurogamer.pl, has discovered a weapon in Dying Light 2 that appears to be a reference to CD Projekt Red’s Cyberpunk 2077. A lead designer on Dying Light 2 seems to have confirmed it, too. 
Tak, to oficjalne 🇵🇱❤️ https://t.co/dKPzHvPpop
February 8, 2022
As you can see in the tweet above, the weapon in Dying Light 2 looks a lot like Cyberpunk 2077’s Mantis Blade weapon, which is less a weapon you hold but one you install directly into your arm. It’s quite metal, literally. 
Now, you might be wondering why Dying Light 2 would reference the critically-maligned Cyberpunk 2077 – sure, both are open-world RPGs based sometime in the future. However, the real connection here is that both Techland and CD Projekt Red are based in Poland. It’s not hard to imagine that Techland wanted to shout out a fellow Poland-based developer in the form of a reference like this. 
Plus, it’s just plain cool. Who doesn’t want blades for arms? As for finding this weapon in Dying Light 2, Eurogamer.pl writes that it can be found on the roof of a building somewhere in the city of Villedor. It’s a scheme you pick up, which you can then use to craft into a weapon. 
For more about Dying Light 2, read Game Informer’s Dying Light 2 review and then check out Techland’s post-launch roadmap that includes five years of DLC. Read Game Informer’s Cyberpunk 2077 review after that.

                    <span>Scalebound was once one of the hottest Microsoft exclusives during the Xbox One’s early years. Developed by Platinum Games, the stylish action title combined Devil May Cry-style action and attitude with dragons. Despite the hype, the game was canceled in 2017 and has become one of gaming&#x27;s curious “What if?” stories. Platinum&#x27;s leadership is still interested in the idea, however, and wants to sit down with Microsoft to make it happen. 
In an interview with IGN Japan, Platinum’s president and vice president, Atsushi Inaba and Hideki Kamiya, respectively, reflected on Scalebound’s cancellation. Inaba states that Kamiya, the game’s creator, talks about reviving Scalebound “all the time.” This isn’t just wishful thinking; the pair wants to have serious talks with Microsoft about revisiting the…</span>

                    <span>Tom Holland is best known for taking on the role of Spider-Man in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, starting with Captain America: Civil War way back in 2016. Since then, he’s gone on to star as Spider-Man in multiple films, but for now, he’s put aside the web slingers and increased the amount of “craps” in his vocabulary to play Nathan Drake in Sony’s upcoming Uncharted movie. 
In an interview for the Uncharted movie, Holland was asked by GameSpot what his dream video game adaptation is, and his response was … interesting, to say the least. 
Hey, @A24 and @Naughty_Dog. Tom Holland has a great video game adaptation pitch for you guys. pic.twitter.com/QKKbJYWedf

This sounds great, as long as Toni Collette and Alex Wolff are on the cast list.
There’s no telling if Holland is serious, but if he is, we’d love to see what this movie would look like. A live-action Jak and Daxter movie is already pretty wild. Making it a “weird” and “dark” A24 movie? It sounds like this would adapt the sequel or the threequel rather than the Precursor Legacy. Maybe add in a touch of horror, and we’re sold. 
While waiting for this hypothetical Jak and Daxter movie, check out this official trailer for Holland’s Uncharted movie and then watch this trailer that reveals Sully’s signature mustache.

                    <span>The Lego set you are about to see is a big SPOILER for people who haven&#x27;t watched the second season of The Mandalorian. Read on at your own risk. This set is based on a moment that you should first see in the show.
Lucasfilm has done a fantastic job of keeping secrets under wraps for all of its Disney+ Star Wars shows. The Book of Boba Fett continues to deliver them in its first season, but none have been as big or as unexpected as Luke Skywalker&#x27;s appearance in The Mandalorian. It&#x27;s a moment that set the internet on fire, and has filled Star Wars fans with the belief that anything can happen in these shows.
Once a secret character is revealed, toy manufactuers race to get product of that certain someone on shelves. We saw it happen with Grogu, and now the floodgates are opened to create product for Luke Skywalker&#x27;s big moment.
Lego is one of the first toy companies to capture Luke Skywalker showing us how powerful he has become. The set is called Dark Trooper Attack, and it&#x27;s scheduled to release on March 1. Along with a hooded Luke Skywalker minifigure, this set comes with three Dark Troopers and is set in a hallway where chaos unfolds. It&#x27;s a smaller set, consisting of just 166 pieces and a price of $29.99.

We know The Mandalorian will be a part of the forthcoming Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga game, but we&#x27;ll have to wait to see if this particular moment is recreated and gives fans control of Luke in arguably one of his greatest moments.</span>

The battle for the Light against Savathûn and her Lucent Brood is fast approaching in Destiny 2’s newest expansion, The Witch Queen, pitting Guardians against their Hive counterparts who share similar powers to our own. In a recent event, we watched some never-before-seen gameplay set on Savathûn’s Throne World, one of the main locations for The Witch Queen. We were also offered a glimpse at a versatile new weapon called the Glaive as well as a tour of what crafting our very own weapons will look like.

                    <span>Battlefield 2042 is still in the midst of a rough post-launch period. An abundance of game-breaking bugs and a lack of new content have disillusioned the franchise&#x27;s long-time fans and turned off newcomers. Despite the game&#x27;s ongoing issues, a dedicated player base does exist, but the activity numbers have waned since release. To make matters worse, a Battlefield 2042 refund petition has passed 25,000 signatures.
25,000 people are on board with the refund policy as of this writing. Part of the description reads as follows: 
&quot;According to many consumer reports, Electronic Arts and DICE did not keep many promises made at launch, and Battlefield 2042 was launched as unplayable. Even today, Battlefield 2042 has bugs that drastically change the in-game experience so much that it&#x27;s deemed an unfinished release by many community members. In fact, Battlefield 2041 was so poorly made that even Steam, a highly reputable provider of PC video games, allows customers to get a full refund. 

Signing this petition will get you one step closer to getting a refund on Battlefield 2042. Suppose this petition receives 50K signatures or more. In that case, one of the best class-action lawsuit lawyers in the country is willing to take our case against EA.&quot;

Game Informer video editor Alex Van Aken titled Battlefield 2042 &quot;The Battle of the Bugs&quot; in his review and stated, &quot;Unfortunately, Battlefield 2042 currently feels underbaked due to an abundance of bugs. While most bugs I encountered are minor, each one dilutes the fun I have when playing.&quot;

Destiny 2 has been out for almost half a decade yet doesn&#x27;t show any signs of slowing down. Bungie&#x27;s FPS juggernaut has been able to occupy the mainstream gaming zeitgeist through its constant updates and expansions, and today we&#x27;re showing off new gameplay from the hotly-anticipated Witch Queen expansion!

                    <span>Nintendo has announced that a new Nintendo Direct is happening this week, and you won&#x27;t have to wait too much longer. 
That&#x27;s because this Direct is happening tomorrow, February 9, at 2 p.m. PT/4 p.m. CT/5 p.m. ET. As for what to expect, Nintendo didn&#x27;t name any game titles, but there&#x27;s some straightforward extrapolation to be done. 
Tune in 2/9 at 2 p.m. PT for a #NintendoDirect livestream featuring roughly 40 minutes of information mainly focused on #NintendoSwitch games launching in the first half of 2022.

February 8, 2022
As you can see in the tweet above, the Direct will run for 40 minutes. Plus, most of what&#x27;s shown will be games released on the Switch in the first half of 2022. That means we&#x27;ll likely be seeing Chocobo GP and Kirby and the Forgotten Land.
Of course, there&#x27;s a Breath of the Wild-sized elephant in the room to address – the highly-anticipated sequel doesn&#x27;t seem like a game coming in the first half of this year. However, Nintendo says the Direct is &quot;mainly focused&quot; on games coming in these first six months. &quot;Mainly focused&quot; gives Nintendo just enough room to discuss games releasing outside of that window, a la (probably) the sequel to Breath of the Wild. Can we at least get an official title, Nintendo?
Perhaps we&#x27;ll see more of Bayonetta 3, or maybe even another look at Splatoon 3? Fortunately, we don&#x27;t have to wait long because the direct is just over 24 hours away. 
What games do you hope to see during tomorrow&#x27;s Nintendo Direct? Let us know in the comments below!</span>

                    <span>Last week was all about quarterly financial results for the likes of Activision Blizzard, EA, Nintendo, and PlayStation. Take-Two Interactive, the parent company of Rockstar, 2K and others, released its own results today and to nobody’s surprise, Grand Theft Auto V is still selling really well. 
You might be asking who doesn’t already own GTA V? The answer is millions. Last November, Game Informer reported that GTA V had sold 5 million copies that quarter, bringing the total up to 155 million units overall. In Take-Two’s latest results, the publisher revealed that Rockstar’s GTA V has now sold 160 million units, representing another quarter where the game sold 5 million copies.

                    <span>When I played a pre-launch build of Marvel Strike Force at the 2018 Game Developers Conference, I was excited to dive into the multiversal battlefield the team at FoxNext created. The solid turn-based combat, an ever-growing roster of beloved Marvel heroes and villains, and compelling hero-collecting elements borrowed from games like Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes drew me in from the jump. I couldn&#x27;t wait to get the launch version on my phone. When Marvel Strike Force arrived on iOS and Android in late March 2018, I was immediately hooked. 
Early on, the premium elements felt pricey yet largely unnecessary if you played the game a decent amount and completed all your daily objectives. Sure, dropping some cash accelerated your progress, but I was largely free-to-play for the first year of the …</span>

We love Digital Foundry&#x27;s tech deep-dives as much as the next framerate obsessive, but when it comes to applying the scientific method to things in video games, we have to say that it&#x27;s the mundane things that help us out the most. Like this extremely important video, for example!
The question is: Is it faster to roll, or to sprint, in Pokémon Legends: Arceus? The secret answer is that Wyrdeer is faster than both, so just hurry up and unlock the lad, but if you&#x27;re on-foot, it turns out that your foots are exactly what you need.

In anticipation of What Lies in the Multiverse&#x27;s upcoming March release, Untold Tales have released a ten-minute gameplay trailer with commentary from the community developer, Sadie, which you can watch above.
What Lies in the Multiverse is all about making your way through various platforming levels with the ability to jump into other dimensions, which will help you solve puzzles that stand in your way. With a large cast of charismatic, bleak, and quirky characters, the story that accompanies the puzzle-platforming is a mix of comedy, emotions, and an adventure that explores the darker side of human nature.

                    <span>Sherlock, eat yer heart out.
What if Gone Home was about a murder? And what if you, a sort of sci-fi Sherlock Holmes, able to investigate a crime scene using revolutionary nano-tech, were able to figure out what happened? That&#x27;s the idea behind Forest Grove, an upcoming narrative puzzle-thriller that&#x27;s all about reconstructing the truth.
An heiress goes missing, and foul play is suspected. The Remote Forensics Bureau is called in, and they recreate the lavish estate of the Kunstimatigaard family using their new Nanodeck technology to clone the whole thing, allowing investigators to explore the house, collect evidence, and watch reconstructions of the various scenes that led up to the disappearance of Zooey Kunstimatigaard, the teen heiress to her dead parents&#x27; fortune.

If you&#x27;re the kind of person who has time for farming shiny Pokémon, you&#x27;ll probably have time for this newly-discovered shiny cloning trick — and you&#x27;d better get in on it fast, before Game Freak patches it out.
As Kattling on Twitter described, the process is relatively simple, it&#x27;s just long.

                    <span>The prequel that has proven popular in Japan.
Octopath Traveler is an excellent, beautiful title on Switch, starting out as an exclusive before eventually landing on PC and Xbox One / Series X|S. Of course, from a Switch perspective we now have Triangle Strategy right around the corner, the latest Square Enix entry in its HD-2D series that - for now at least - is also exclusive to Nintendo&#x27;s system.
A good while ago, though, Octopath Traveler had a mobile prequel in Japan - Champions of the Continent. It arrived in Japan in October 2020 and quickly soared past 10 million players, and Square Enix is no doubt hoping for an equally positive response elsewhere; it&#x27;s now confirmed that an English version is on the way in 2022 (iOS and Android), with a closed beta to test it out in the Spring. There&#x27;s also an official English Facebook page if you&#x27;re into that kind of thing.

Another Nintendo Direct? In this economy? That&#x27;s right! And it&#x27;s a 40-minute one, focused on the games coming to the Nintendo Switch in the first half of 2022. Or, technically, mainly focused on the first half of the year...
The Direct will take place tomorrow, February 9th, at 2pm PT / 5pm ET / 10pm GMT / 11pm CET.

Today&#x27;s brought the rather exciting news of an upcoming Nintendo Direct, but for Switch fans there seem to be other intriguing showcases to come this month. One is &#x27;All Aksys&#x27;, the second broadcast with that name to come our way from Aksys Games; it&#x27;ll air on 17th February at 9am Pacific / noon Eastern / 5pm UK / 6pm CET on the publisher&#x27;s official Twitch channel.
It&#x27;s already confirmed that it&#x27;ll feature six upcoming Nintendo Switch games; current details on these is below, and we can expect localisation information in some cases.

When Nintendo released Super Mario Maker, many pondered what the company could do next with the formula. Turns out, it was Super Mario Maker 2 and not &#x27;Zelda Maker&#x27;, which was high on people&#x27;s wish lists.
If you were one of those disappointed individuals, then you might be interested to learn that indie studio Firechick is releasing Super Dungeon Maker on Switch, which is described as &quot;Zelda meets Super Mario Maker&quot; in its associated press materials. It won the “Best Family Game” Award at Gamescom 2021, which bodes well for its overall quality.

                    <span>Popping in with some analysis.
Pokémon Legends: Arceus is already proving to be a sales success, with plenty of positive buzz from fans that have made the jump. However, an ongoing debate around the game has related to its performance, especially its graphics and the quality of Game Freak&#x27;s engine. Even a number of fans that love the game itself have shared disappointment with the visuals, especially when compared to other major games on the Switch.
Now Digital Foundry has given an interesting analysis of the game&#x27;s technical aspects, which seems pretty fair and balanced to us. In the video above the team goes through resolution, framerate, and various aspects of the game&#x27;s technical performance. It makes some comparisons, too, notably with The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Xenoblade Chronicles 2 and Monster Hunter Rise.

                    <span>&quot;I adore the Switch&quot;.
The Last Worker is a title that, with each passing month, is attracting more attention and curiosity. It&#x27;s a project led by Jörg Tittel, whose career has seen him work across the arts in TV, film and games. Revealed last year with an enigmatic trailer, it also achieved the notable landmark of being showcased at the 78th Venice Film Festival, which was also the moment its impressive voice cast was announced. Combine that sort of buzz with its intriguing recent trailer (above), and it&#x27;s clear that this is a game to watch.
When we last spoke to Tittel it was in the rather interesting position of talking around some serious self-imposed embargos. Recently, however, we were invited to an online press event by publisher Wired Productions and got another look at the game, getting a better feel for its approach and what it&#x27;s trying to achieve.

WayForward is a publisher and developer that&#x27;s best known by some for its mascot Shantae, but in recent times has started to grow almost beyond its heroine. Particularly in terms of its development efforts its working on IPs and franchises with plenty of fans, notably teaming up with Nintendo on the upcoming Switch release Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp.
It seems the company has more major projects in the works, too. Speaking to Goomba Stomp, River City Girls Zero project lead Adam Tierney teased that there&#x27;s a lot to come from the company over the next two years.

Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick is the latest big-wig in the games industry to lend support to the notion of NFTs within games – but he admits that the company is concerned with the rampant &quot;speculation&quot; that currently surrounds them.
Speaking to investors, Zelnick said:

During a call with investors, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick revealed that GTA Trilogy has beaten expectations to rack up more than 10 million in sales across all formats.
While Zelnick hasn&#x27;t officially said that it sold 10 million, it was announced that the entire GTA franchise has now shifted over 370 million copies worldwide, a 15 million increase since November. Given that GTA V was singled out as selling another 5 million in that period (well spotted, Metro), it doesn&#x27;t take a maths genius to figure out what kind of business the remastered trilogy has done.

It&#x27;s just as relaxation when the scenery is virtual. SCS Software have just released 20 minutes of the next expansion for Euro Truck Simulator 2, Heart Of Russia, showing the journey from Vyazma to Kaluga.

                    <span>In many ways, Semantle is hard mode Wordle. Gone is the simplified dictionary and five-letter limit, meaning words can be any type and length, and gone is any indication of correctly guessed letters or positions.

Instead, you&#x27;ve got two new helpers: the ability to make infinite guesses, and a neural network able to learn word associations telling you how close, conceptually, you are to the correct answer. I&#x27;ve yet to find the solution in fewer than 50 guesses.

                    <span>Speaking as a generally terrified person who curls up into a tiny ball whenever they feel threatened, the tower defence genre really resonates with me. Like a besieged castle, I am also in a state of constant high-alert and paralysing, teeth-grinding stress. I am incapable of any kind of meaningful conflict resolution, and embarrassingly vulnerable to being destroyed by hundreds of angry men with swords over the course of several helpless minutes. 


Diplomacy Is Not An Option doesn’t bill itself as a tower defence game, but it is a real-time strategy game about protecting your mediaeval settlement as wave after wave of attackers try to smash it up. Rather than have you traipsing around the map in search of trouble to make, there is a refreshing focus on defence – offence’s nerdy younger sister –  with victory determined not by how well you’ve conquered the surrounding land, but how capable you are of taking a beating and coming out on top.

Battle royale money machine Fortnite will not be updated to work on the Steam Deck – and according to Epic CEO Tim Sweeney, that’s down to a lack of “confidence that we’d be able to combat cheating” on Linux platforms.

Over the weekend, the former Irrational developer who placed the meme-ified Baguette Boy in Binfinite&#x27;s Burial At Sea expansion explained why he&#x27;s there. It&#x27;s an interesting story about how weird game development it is, how weird games themselves are as technical objects, and about creativity within technical constraints.

                    <span>There is one upside to Lost Ark having the aged tang of MMOs gone by, even if it’s specific to the visuals rather than the familiar mechanical trappings. Committing to the player numbers game of a free-to-play model for its South Korean launch back in 2019, Lost Ark always needed to perform on low-end and luxury PCs alike, and its imminent Western release is following the same rules. The result: a game that rarely looks outstanding but always runs smoothly, whether it’s on older budget hardware or the best graphics cards and CPUs of today.

                    <span>In last year&#x27;s hands-on with free-to-play action RPG-inspired MMO Lost Ark last year, I thought it had potential if you could survive the early slow burn. Having since returned to it for a few weeks, my thoughts remain largely the same. For all its flashy combat and fun moments, the sheer grind to reach its promised endgame may prove too much for many.

                    <span>I was sold from the moment our Justicar sliced off the mutated Apostate Preacher’s tentacle arm. The poor thing was clutching a Vox Stave, and so removing his arm removed the use of his scariest abilities - although in this case the dismemberment proved academic, because it also left him exposed to immediate melee execution. That left our Interceptor free to shoot a nearby statue down on top of a cultist before stabbing him and his friend to death, which in turn gave our Apothecary enough space to chuck a grenade at a bridge and send three Poxwalkers plummeting to their doom. 
I’m no Warhammermun. Those proper nouns are all cosmic Greek to me, but I’m relieved to report they didn&#x27;t obscure the promise within the 30 minutes of Warhammer 40,000: Chaos Gate - Daemonhunters I was shown last week. This is fast-paced XCOM in space, with extensively destructible terrain, an intriguing dual focus on ranged and melee combat, and not a miss chance in sight. That should sound enticing to just about anyone.

                    <span>“I’ve made it,” monologues a goblin, donning chainmail and spiked shoulderpads in the changing rooms. “Finally. After all these years of hardship. After everything they told me. I will show them that even I can be the best player.”
The pitch suitably set for bathos, no series fan will be surprised by what happens next. No sooner has our protagonist left the tunnel than he’s launched skyward by a backhand from an ogre. In the match’s opening moments, he sees more airtime than the ball. And shortly afterwards, he’s a footnote, prone in the grass as much larger - and better armed - humanoids pound the earth around his limp form.

                    <span>A key member of Scene piracy group SPARKS has been sentenced to 22 months in prison. The 52-year-old Brit George Bridi, who pleaded guilty, apologized and showed remorse for his wrongdoing at a New York federal court. The sentence is lower than the 27 to 33-month term the U.S. Attorney had asked for.

                    <span>A 43-year-old man has been handed a three months conditional prison sentence for his involvement with the Danish torrent tracker Asgaard. The man, who is seen as one of the driving forces behind the now-defunct site, helped to set up and manage servers and also helped with coding. Several other defendants connected to the site will have their day in court later this year.

                    <span>Horizon Forbidden West, Guerrilla Games’ upcoming sequel to its 2017 hit Horizon Zero Dawn, has just gone gold and launches next month. And though it’s landing at an unusually busy time for game releases, this follow-up title is at the top of many fans’ most anticipated lists. Horizon Forbidden West appeared on our magazine cover in December, meaning we learned a ton of details about the game. So, there’s a lot to pack into this beefy round-up of everything you need to know before you start Aloy’s next journey. Let’s dive in.
Continuing The Story
Some games don’t require you to play the previous title before jumping into the follow-up. And though the developer states you can enjoy Horizon Forbidden West without playing Zero Dawn, we don’t recommend it. The sequel picks up a few months afte…</span>

                    <span>Intellivision Entertainment’s founder and CEO Tommy Tallarico is stepping down from his position, IGN reports. Tallarico, best known as a prolific video game composer, purchased and relaunched Intellivision in 2018 to manufacture the Amico, a new console aimed at attracting more casual players that has had a troubled production cycle since it was announced nearly four years ago. 
Tallarico will remain with Intellivision, transitioning to the role of company president. He is also the company&#x27;s largest shareholder. Chief revenue officer Phil Adam will replace him as CEO. A statement from Intellivision provided to IGN says the change was done “to better align its resources with those new challenges&quot; regarding the Amico&#x27;s development.

6180 The Moon

16 Achievements
1,000 Points
Time Requirement: 3-4 Hours
If you&#x27;re respectable at platformer games, 6180 The Moon is a fun little game to venture into. While the challenges are difficult, checkpoints are in great abundance, and progress is inevitable if you stick with it. For each planet that is unlocked, the player nets a nice 50- or 100-poi…</span>

                    <span>Telltale Games went through a resurrection and reinvention after its shutdown in 2018, but returned shortly after with a return to one of its fan-favorite series in 2019: The Wolf Among Us 2. We learned more about the game in December of 2020 and then Telltale Games shared some more a year later, shortly after Game Informer’s feature about this new iteration of the studio, its Wolf Among Us sequel, and its upcoming game based on The Expanse went live. 
If you’re still craving some more information about The Wolf Among Us 2, then you’re in luck because Telltale Games has some more information to share this week. More specifically, the studio has announced a behind-the-scenes look at the game happening this Wednesday, February 9, at 10 a.m. PT/Noon CT/1 p.m. EST. 
Greetings from Fabletown!

February 7, 2022
As you can see in the tweet above, we’re all heading back to Fabletown this week. However, it doesn’t sound like we’ll be getting a trailer for the game or a look at gameplay. Considering Telltale Games used the words “behind-the-scenes” specifically, we expect just that – a look at what’s happening under the hood, maybe some concept art, and more. Only time will tell, though. 
While waiting for Wednesday, check out Game Informer’s The Wolf Among Us: Episode 1 review and then watch this Wolf Among Us 2 trailer. Read about Telltale Games’ upcoming series based on The Expanse after that.

                    <span>FromSoftware&#x27;s catalog of games is synonymous with sweeping narrative design and challenging combat, the latter leading to some particularly memorable boss battles for millions of Soulsborne players. There are simply too many exciting encounters to list between all of Miyazaki&#x27;s acclaimed projects. Good thing a bunch of PlayStation developers picked some of their favorite FromSoftware bosses and spoke about the combat design and spectacle of each fight. Even Miyazaki chimed in on the boss he&#x27;s most proud of!

                    <span>Shinji Mikami is a horror legend in gaming, having directed the first Resident Evil, which spawned off an entire franchise with over a dozen entries in it today. He then left Capcom to create Tango Gameworks, now owned by Bethesda, which is where Mikami began his new horror series, The Evil Within. After a sequel, the team began work on GhostWire Tokyo, which is set to debut on PlayStation 5 and PC on March 25. 
While Mikami’s mind is probably mostly focused on the yokai-filled streets of Tokyo, that didn’t stop him from reminiscing about his most well-known horror series, Resident Evil. In a new interview with Newsweek, Mikami explained that he believes there’s ways Resident Evil 4 could be improved. More specifically, he said if rumors of Capcom’s Resident Evil 4 remake are true, he not …</span>

                    <span>Google Stadia has mostly been fighting an uphill battle since its announcement. Not only was the technology new, which is always a struggle even with a name like Google behind the service, but its launch largely failed to make game streaming waves in the industry. It was released just a year before the expected launch of new-gen consoles like the Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5, too, and shortly after the launch of those consoles, Google announced it was ending first-party game development and closing two of its internal Stadia studios. 
Now, the latest nail in Stadia’s coffin is reportedly being hammered in, as reported by Business Insider. According to Business Insider’s new report, Google is attempting to salvage the Stadia service under the new name of “Google Stream.” At the same ti…</span>

                    <span>Pokémon Legends: Arceus was released less than two weeks ago but it’s already a hit. Not only did it review really well – Game Informer gave it an 8.75 out of 10 – but it sold a massive 6.5 million copies in just seven days. A new mystery gift distribution might get more players excited to jump back into the Hisui region, or it might get those on the fence to finally pick up the game. 
News of this incoming mystery gift distribution event comes by way of Serebii.net, which spotted signage for the event. Serebii notes that the event seems to be exclusive to GameStop and will run from February 25 through March 13. It will give players a Hisuian Growlithe and 20 Feather Balls.

Now, as some have pointed out on Twitter, this isn’t necessarily the most exciting mystery gift distribution. A Hisuian Growlithe isn’t exactly rare – although for some, finding one could take hours – and 20 Feather Balls won’t cost you too much in-game. However, it doesn’t hurt to receive a free Pokémon and some useful Feather Balls. 
No further details have been released for the event just yet, but considering there’s still a few weeks before its start, it’s not surprising. As we near the February 25 start date for the mystery gift distribution event, expect more details about it to be revealed. 
While waiting for more information, be sure to read Game Informer’s Pokémon Legends: Arceus review and then check out these three new Pokémon Pop! figures recently revealed. Read Game Informer’s 10 tips and tricks to know before starting Pokémon Legends: Arceus after that.

                    <span>Dying Light 2 was released just last week and its player counts quickly overtook the all-time high of the first Dying Light. After a weekend of players running through Techland’s new city, Villedor, the studio has released a list of hotfixes and improvements coming to the zombie parkour game soon. 
As expected, there are different bugs and things to fix on different platforms. The issues PC players are running into aren’t necessarily what’s being seen on PlayStation and what’s being seen on PlayStation isn’t necessarily what’s happening on Xbox consoles.

                    <span>Death&#x27;s Door is a great little game. I&#x27;ve been meaning to play it properly for a while, ever since I was told that you can slice signposts in half and then when you try and read it there&#x27;s only half of the text left. And so what better game, I thought, to test out the new cloud gaming beta on the Xbox this weekend? (In fact, I ended up downloading the game because it streamed fine at like 10am but at peak times it went all pixely, like someone had huffed on my glasses.)
Reader, I bloody love Death&#x27;s Door. Like Katharine said, it&#x27;s kind of a more gentle Soulslike, with a Studio Ghibli-esque flair to the character design and world. Also, there are fun jokes like a gravedigger being called Steadhone and stuff. But I also hate Death&#x27;s Door, because it&#x27;s still not an easy game, and I think I ended up playing it improperly this weekend.

                    <span>The creators of skateboarding game OlliOlli World sent word that Danny Trejo, of Danny Trejo fame, would feature in their video game. After filing our OlliOlli World review, I investigated and, yup, you stumble across him in one particularly fiendish level, where he is being used as promotional bait by a scheming business frog. Good thing no real company would stoop so low as to use Daniel T&#x27;s likeness in such a cynical, ultimately successful way. 
Ahem. Well, if Danny Trejo can show up in this kickflip &#x27;em up, what other cameos may appear? We used the game&#x27;s character customisation menu to cook up some possibilities.

                    <span>One year after announcing a paid expansion for Factorio, the developers still haven&#x27;t revealed much of what it&#x27;ll bring. But they have now confirmed something that might not be big but is large: they plan for the expansion to feel as big as the whole base game all over again. Factorio is not a small game, so that&#x27;s an impressive plan.

                    <span>Whether you dislike NFTs, don&#x27;t understand them, or think you can make money from them, you can&#x27;t escape the NFT discourse. Game stores are no different. Valve have banned games with NFTs or cryptocurrencies from Steam, the Epic Games Stores welcomes NFTs, and now Itch.io has weighed in. In response to people asking, the folks behind the excellent indie games store have stated their beliefs plainly: &quot;NFTs are a scam.&quot;

                    <span>So, there&#x27;s this South Korean MMORPG called Mir4 that&#x27;s been out on mobile and PC for about six months now. It&#x27;s free-to-play, so it started off with decent numbers, but from October to November the monthly average player count jumped up by 32k. It&#x27;s tailing off now, but still averaging 60,000 Steam users over the last three months, a surge you&#x27;d think would be worth celebrating, right? I investigated and discovered that Mir4 is one bizarre game, with one soul-crushing USP: NFTs.
That&#x27;s right folks. The game lets you mint your character as an NFT, and even mine cryptocurrency if you so choose. If this is the future, then it seems cold and strange and sad. Also, Mir4 is a terrible game.

                    <span>Following the launch of Dying Light 2 on Friday, developers Techland have been working to fix lingering technical issues. Over the weekend they laid out their plans for patching the open-world zombie-masher, with fixes for a number of crashes, issues blocking progress through the story, issues leading to a &quot;death loop&quot; (not that sort) and more. They haven&#x27;t said when exactly PC patches will hit, but sounds like soon?

                    <span>ETTV has shut down and will not be coming back. The operator of the site informs TorrentFreak that he doesn&#x27;t have the funds to keep the site and upload bots going. The domain names are still registered for now but these won&#x27;t be renewed either. It&#x27;s the end of an era.

Existing applications and games optimized for prior Intel Macs continue running generally in excellent shape on their newest hardware thanks to Rosetta 2. While there is the ongoing Linux bring-up work for Apple Silicon on Linux, the open-source world doesn&#x27;t currently have that advantage of a compelling Rosetta 2 alternative but the FEX-Emu project hopes to change that outlook...</span>

                    <span>As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be Jackie Chan. Not the actual guy, but the version of him in those movies, where he could clear out entire rooms using luck, martial arts and whatever he had within arm’s reach. Well, with Sifu, my childhood dream is now a reality. You don’t need to be a kung fu film fanatic to appreciate this action game, though. It’s not a tired bundle of tropes packaged together with an ironic detachment. It’s a passionate celebration of what makes the genre so good.

                    <span>After tackling Metroid in Season 1, the second season of Game Informer&#x27;s Video Gameography podcast moves on to one of the biggest shooter franchises in existence: Halo. It&#x27;s time to bring Season 2 to a close as we examine Halo Infinite, the most recent entry that served as both a return to form and a dramatic reinvention for the franchise. 
Halo Infinite launched December 8, 2021 (though its multiplayer launched in open beta a month prior). After the mixed reception to Halo 5: Guardians, 343 Industries undertook its longest development cycle yet creating Halo Infinite. 343 Industries clashed over its numerous ideas for the title&#x27;s direction, and an infamous first showing in 2020 led to Infinite being delayed a full year as it was originally slated as an Xbox Series X/S launch title. The extra time paid off. Halo Infinite launched to largely positive reception, including snagging Game Informer&#x27;s coveted Game of the Year award. How did 343 pull the nose up? What role does Halo Wars 2 have on the narrative? Where does 343 take the series going forward? Tune in as we discuss those burning questions and more. 
Join hosts Ben Reeves (@BenjaminReeves) and Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7) along with Game Informer&#x27;s Magazine Content Director/resident Halo expert Matt Miller (@MatthewRMiller) as we explore Halo Infinite&#x27;s creation and immediate impact on the franchise. You&#x27;ll also want to stick around for the announcement of the game series we&#x27;ll be covering in Season 3!

                    <span>Meta is adding a new system called &quot;Personal Boundary&quot; to Horizon Worlds and Horizon Venues, two of their virtual reality apps. It&#x27;s designed to curb creepy behaviour within the company&#x27;s much-hyped metaverse by preventing other player&#x27;s from invading your personal space.

                    <span>Wordle is a genre now. Its rapid success has caused a proliferation of browser games in which all players are presented with the same puzzle each day, limited guesses, and easy options to share their results.

My new favourite is Worldle. It meets all the criteria, including being free and playable in your browser, but instead of guessing a word you&#x27;re attempt to identify a country by its silhouette.

                    <span>My eyes unfocused partway through the trailer for Genshin Impact&#x27;s 2.5 update. There was some sort of mystical calamity and it was all very dramatic. Then, almost after the real trailer was finished, there was a minute or more of the actual game, as a character gathered herbs in a pretty field at night, mixed a drink, and unlocked some items. 

I was immediately focused back in. Update 2.5, &quot;When the Sakura Bloom&quot;, will launch on February 16th with three new characters.

                    <span>Developers offer free weekends with their games all the time, but it feels more like a trap when the game is The Sims 4. Become immersed in EA&#x27;s dollhouse creation kit and what awaits you is a world of costly DLC.

But then heck, I like the game and I&#x27;ve only bought a handful of content packs because I liked the look of the kitchen cupboards. So play The Sims 4 for free on Steam this weekend, and buy it at 88% off if you like it.

                    <span>The U.S. Government is seeking a five-year prison sentence for Gary Bowser, a member of the infamous Nintendo modding group Team-Xecuter. The prosecution argues that a tough sentence is needed to send a clear message to other criminals. Bowser&#x27;s attorneys disagree and note that their client was used by other group members who, unlike him, probably made millions.

Any delay in the removal of pirated live streams would damage the interests of the Premier League, La Liga, Bundesliga, Serie A plus dozens of other leagues, they argue.

Gran Turismo 7 is the first mainline entry in the series since 2013&#x27;s Gran Turismo 6 back on the PlayStation 3. Sure, Gran Turismo Sport was released during the PlayStation 4 generation, but that game left fans wanting more and also equally excited about what was in the pipeline. It turns out, what was in the pipeline was the next full Gran Turismo and after watching a behind-closed-doors preview of it recently, Game Informer editor Wesley LeBlanc came away excited for &quot;the real driving simulator.&quot; 
As someone who&#x27;s never dabbled in the Gran Turismo series beyond a few hours each entry, he was looking for something in GT7 to entice him to stick around. What he found was a couple of new modes and features that seemingly aim to do just that, although we won&#x27;t know until the full release in March. However, if you&#x27;re a hardcore GT fan, don&#x27;t worry – all the bells and whistles you&#x27;ve come to expect in these games are present, looking (and sounding) better than ever. 
In this New Gameplay Today, Wesley is joined by fellow Game Informer editors Ben Reeves and John Carson, all hosted by video editor Alex Stadnik. They talk about new features, returning favorites, being funny on the racetrack, and more. Thanks for watching, and be sure to let us know what you think of this upcoming racing game from PlayStation and Polyphony Digital.</span>

                    <span>Valve announced the Steam Deck in July of last year and it was met with cautious excitement. Its premise is great – play your Steam games on the go in a Switch-like fashion – but many were confused at the actual layout of the device. Its buttons seem to be running off the edge, the analog sticks are quite high (and not offset like they are on the Switch) and there are two very-large touchpads. 
Oh, and it looked quite big. With excitement continually ramping up for the device, Valve announced last week that the Steam Deck would launch on February 25 (for those who preordered the first wave, of course). That release date is close and it seems some people have already got their hands on the device. They’ve posted some comparison pictures, too, that reveal the Steam Deck is chonky. 
Here’s what it looks like compared to Sony’s PlayStation Vita, a relatively small handheld device:

And here’s the comparison everyone wants to see – the Nintendo Switch vs. the Steam Deck: 
The Steam Deck is enormous... pic.twitter.com/fMVXckNkiK
February 4, 2022
As you can see in the image above, the Steam Deck is significantly larger than the Switch. For fans of big screens and people with large hands, this is likely an exciting comparison. For people with smaller hands, or for fans of more compact devices, that excitement might be waning. Only time will tell but fortunately, we won’t have to wait too long as the Steam Deck will hit the hands of consumers later this month on February 25.

                    <span>The Nintendo Minute was never a minute, and neither is this week&#x27;s episode of All Things Nintendo! This week, Brian is joined by Kit Ellis and Krysta Yang, the two former hosts of Nintendo Minute, Nintendo&#x27;s in-house YouTube show. However, their time at Nintendo extends far beyond simply hosting that show. In fact, when you combine how long Kit and Krysta worked at Nintendo, it&#x27;s almost three decades of experience. On this special episode of All Things Nintendo, Brian chats with the two former Nintendo employees about their long-running show, what it&#x27;s like working at the company, and hints of what could be next for them.

                    <span>Children of Morta is one of the most exceptional hidden gems of the last generation, but the cooperative dungeon crawler has woefully lacked a much-requested feature: online play. Playing with a friend locally has been great, but now you can finally play with remote buddies – or maybe even a sweetheart – this Valentine’s Day. Assuming you’re on PC, that is. 
On February 14, the long-promised online two-player co-op option finally makes its way into the Steam version game. Don’t worry, console players: the feature is coming to PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch, but developer Dead Mage doesn’t have a timetable on when that will happen. In a press release, the team states it wants to ensure online play functions well on PC before rolling it out elsewhere. 
Online co-op comes via The Fellowship Sanctuary update, the final piece of content of its eight-piece DLC roadmap. That means 11bit will be wrapping up major support for the game which was first released in October 2019 to a 9 out of 10 review score from us here at Game Informer. The dungeon-crawling action game centers on a large family of warriors, all of whom are playable, who must fight back an evil corruption. 
In his review of the game, Editor-in-Chief Andrew Reiner wrote “I can’t stress just how smartly made Children of Morta is. The narrative flows smoothly in and out of dungeons, the characters have real life to them, and the gameplay is enthralling and has those addictive qualities that make you just want to keep leveling everyone up. In the 15-plus hours I invested in this adventure, I was thoroughly captivated by everything Dead Mage set out to achieve. The way family comes together for the final conflict is truly impressive.”

                    <span>It Takes Two was released by Hazelight last March, published as an EA Originals title. Its director, Josef Fares, is perhaps best known for his dislike of The Academy Awards and you might have seen him on The Game Awards stage last December. That’s because he accepted the Game of the Year award that night. 
Fares is likely still riding the high of that win, but today, news released that’s sure to keep him smiling. Hazelight Studios’ official Twitter account revealed that It Takes Two has sold five million copies.

“5…that’s FIVE million copies of It Takes Two sold,” the tweet reads. “Our team is absolutely stunned just thinking about how many players have now enjoyed our game.” 
5… that’s FIVE million copies of #ItTakesTwo ￼sold! 😳💥🥳
February 4, 2022
Having sold five million copies, It Takes Two is now Hazelight Studios’ most popular game, beating out A Way Out’s 3.5 million copies sold, as reported by GameSpot. 
It Takes Two being this successful isn’t much of a surprise – the game’s great! Game Informer gave it a 9.25 out of 10 and you can read that review here. Hazelight Studios seems set on capitalizing on the game’s success, too, as it recently announced a film and television adaptation is in the works. 
While waiting for that, check out where It Takes Two falls on Game Informer’s top 10 games of 2021 list, and then read this feature about It Takes Two’s creator on love, endings, and a $1000 pledge.

                    <span>A not-so-long time ago in the same galaxy we all reside in, Respawn Entertainment deviated from its first-person shooter roots to create Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. This third-person action game was the studio’s first stab at tackling the coveted Star Wars license, crafting an original adventure set five years after Revenge of the Sith. It stars Cal Kestis, a padawan turned junker (played by Shameless star Cameron Monaghan) that managed to evade the Jedi purge of Order 66. After he’s outed by the Sith, he embarks on a quest to recover an artifact capable of locating force-sensitive children while also avoiding capture by the Inquisitors, who are elite Jedi hunters. 
The game features a blend of lightsaber combat and a suite of Force abilities. Borrowing inspiration from FromSoftware’s Soul series, encounters are challenging, requiring a strategic blend of blocks and parries to outduel opponents. Meanwhile, the various planets take on a Metroid-inspired progression with players unlocking abilities to backtrack to previously inaccessible areas.

Fallen Order was released November 15, 2019, and was a critical and financial success. It also served as a saving grace for single-player fans, providing proof to an increasingly multiplayer-focused EA that linear story-driven experiences can still make the big bucks. With a sequel reportedly in the works, we’re revisiting this gem of the Star Wars video game pantheon. 
Join Marcus Stewart, Daniel Tack, and Andrew Reiner on Twitch today at 2 p.m. Central as we journey through the entirety of Cal Kestis’ adventure. Expect plenty of laughs, deaths, and general nerding out over all things Star Wars. We encourage you to hang out with us in chat.

                    <span>In addition to revealing the release date of the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S versions of Grand Theft Auto V and GTA Online, Rockstar has confirmed that development on the next full-fledged GTA has indeed commenced. 
Rockstar’s blog post today concluded with a note stating as much, which you can read in full below:
So there you have it. While not the biggest surprise in the world, there is a vocal sect of fans that will be relieved to know that, yes, Rockstar won’t be re-releasing GTA V in perpetuity. The question becomes how long it will be before Grand Theft Auto 6, or whatever Rockstar decides to call it, makes its grand debut.

                    <span>After suffering a delay last year, Rockstar Games confirmed that Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online will launch on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on March 15.
The move to more powerful hardware means some new bells and whistles for the best-selling games. GTA V and Online now boast resolutions up to 4K, HDR and ray tracing, improved textures and draw distances, and up to 60 frames per second gameplay. The PS5 version also features 3D audio and DualSense haptic feedback. Here&#x27;s a visual example of what to expect in this trailer from last year&#x27;s PlayStation Showcase.

Today marks the third anniversary of Apex Legends. It seems like only yesterday Respawn surprise-launched its secret battle royale, and I was entering my second week as a Game Informer intern. It took me a while to get swept up in the hype, but once I glided down to Kings Canyon for the first time, I knew Apex Legends would become an obsession. Fast-forward to February 2022, and things have come full circle.

The ongoing lawsuit from the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) against the company is over reported toxic workplace culture. The bulk of the suit focuses on &quot;violations of the state&#x27;s civil rights and equal pay laws,&quot; specifically regarding the treatment of women and other marginalized groups.

                    <span>Dying Light 2 is finally out and it seems the latest zombie parkour game from Techland is doing really well. 
If Steam numbers are anything to go off of, Dying Light 2 is easily Techland’s most successful game. In fact, its all-time peak is nearly four times larger than Dying Light’s all-time peak. Mind you, Dying Light has been out since 2015 and Dying Light 2 has been out for essentially 24 hours. That it’s already surpassed the original game with such massive numbers is quite the feat, as noted by games analyst Benji-Sales on Twitter.

More specifically, Dying Light 2’s all-time peak at the moment is 177,222 players, according to Steam Charts. Dying Light’s all-time peak is 45,876. In fact, Dying Light 2 has already surpassed last year’s big horror release, Resident Evil Village, which has an all-time peak of 106,631. 
Now, it’s important to note that PC player counts don’t necessarily translate to console player counts, but there’s a good chance that if PC player counts are this high, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One concurrents are just as high, if not higher. If that’s the case, then Techland absolutely has another hit on their hands. 
That wouldn’t be surprising either because Dying Light 2 is a great game – Game Informer gave it a 9.5 out of 10. Not to mention, Techland has already publicly discussed its commitment to this game, releasing a five-year roadmap for planned DLC. The sequel could get another boost in player counts too when the Switch version of Dying Light 2, which was recently delayed, is finally released.

These sales numbers came the same day Nintendo released its quarterly results where the company revealed that the Switch has crossed 103 million units sold, surpassing the Wii’s lifetime sales. Nintendo also revealed in those results that it isn’t changing its investment plans in light of recent acquisitions (looking at you Microsoft and Sony) and that the hybrid home console is only in the middle of its lifecycle.

They&#x27;re sustained by fans&#x27; hopes and dreams of what the games might one day become but this is a double-edged sword. The developers, Cloud Imperium Games have now decided to make their public development roadmap for future updates more vague, because some players get dead narked about delays. I can see that happening after nine years.

If she&#x27;s not throwing her arms out like an aeroplane when she&#x27;s running up and down the yellowing hills of this sleepy little island village, she&#x27;s doing a jolly little skip that is probably the most delightful thing I&#x27;ve ever seen in a video game. In fairness, the whole game is just pure joy distilled into a chill wildlife photography adventure, but man alive, the skipping is something else. More of this please, developers.

                    <span>Eight years after the launch of Grand Theft Auto V, Rockstar Games have finally confirmed yes, they really are making a new GTA. For eight years they&#x27;ve focused on adding new content to the MMO-y GTA Online mode, which seems a licence to print money by selling in-game cash for real cash. This has made some fans ornery, wondering if they&#x27;ll just keep on plugging away at GTAO forever, especially with GTAV coming to next-gen consoles this year. But no, really, Rockstar say they really have been making a new one.

                    <span>It&#x27;s not that easy, you know, hating everything. Deckbuilders are bad, I repeat, while enjoying one against my will. D&amp;D can go to hell, I screech, in between weekly sessions. Corporate saturation crushes better games, I insist, alt-tabbing out of Vermintide.
This week it&#x27;s the FTL-inspired The Last Bastion that&#x27;s making things difficult. You&#x27;re the leader of a defeated army regiment, retreating across a series of regions to a stronghold where your king plans to make a last stand. It&#x27;s sort of roguelike, with a hint of something like Reigns in balancing your forces and reputation, with light interactive fiction parts. I&#x27;m a little bit annoyed that I like it.

                    <span>Ghostwire: Tokyo is an upcoming action-adventure game from Tango Gameworks (aka the folks behind The Evil Within), which means it has ghosts and ghost-adjacent monsters in it. Last night Bethesda showed off a bit more of the game with a streamed showcase, with a ten minute breakdown of the game in action. I, however, was privy to a hands-off presentation that comprised a whole half an hour of Ghostwire Tokyo being played. What luxury!
It reminded me much less of The Evil Within than I expected. It has a lot of horror elements, don&#x27;t get me wrong, but Ghostwire: Tokyo is much more of an action game using the language of horror to convey its themes than the other way around. Rather than spending most of your time on the back foot, creeping around in the hope you can get past a lumbering ball of dead lady limbs with most of your health intact, time in Ghostwire: Tokyo is more likely spent one-shotting headless demon schoolgirls with a bow and arrow. The general vibe, if not the specifics, reminded me a lot of classic, thundering 90s and 00s action films like Blade. So, in other words, Ghostwire: Tokyo looks rad as hell. Even better, it&#x27;s also unashamedly strange.

                    <span>If you’re opted into Valve’s Steam client beta, you may have noticed a couple of small but potentially very helpful UI updates that rolled out in the past few hours. Changes that are available on desktop but could be even more helpful, methinks, on the upcoming Steam Deck.


The first appears on the Library page of games you own, but haven’t installed yet: a new “Space required” string that lists how much hard drive or SSD space it will need. As it stands on the main Steam client, you can’t normally see this info without clicking the Install button, so that’s a click saved whenever you’re trying to find out if a new game (or nostalgic re-install) will fit onto stuffed storage.

Voice Of Cards: The Forsaken Maiden is the new one&#x27;s name and surprise, launching later this month is its game—less than five months after the first.

                    <span>Dying Light 2 is out and hoo boy, is it a tough nut to crack. Not in the hours to completion sense, or even difficulty in general – Matthew’s review found a rather unthreatening strain of undead – but in how tricky it is to get running smoothly on PC. That goes double if you want to dolly up this post-apocalypse with some shiny ray tracing features, so even if you’ve got a rig that can breeze through most games, I’d recommend reading on for a guide to Dying Light 2’s best settings.

                    <span>There is a very high chance that Mike Booth&#x27;s fingerprints are on one of your favourite games. He&#x27;s one of the original founders of Turtle Rock Studios and creator of Left 4 Dead. At Valve, he worked on CS:GO and Team Fortress 2. Westwood Studio&#x27;s classic RPG Nox? That&#x27;s Booth as well. After a stint working on VR games for Facebook, he&#x27;s currently the chief creative officer at Bad Robot Games, the game-centric offshoot of J.J. Abrams&#x27; Bad Robot film and TV production company. But, not content with having one job at a time, Booth has also been working at Resolution Games on the VR tabletop RPG Demeo.
A streamlined, high production values version of Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Demeo won a lot of &quot;best of&quot; accolades in VR game round-ups. But soon it&#x27;s coming to regular ol&#x27; PCs, with early access starting on April 7th. I spoke to Booth about Demeo, but also the future of co-op games. He had quite a lot to say.

                    <span>When you become a game designer, you are handed a big book of antagonists to use as guilt-free bullet fodder. First among them is the reliable, stinky zombie. (Also found in this repertoire are Nazis and Slimes. They are beyond the scope of this listicle.) The zombie is a preternaturally killable being. It has already experienced mortality once, so this creature more than anyone is ready to suffer the ignominy of death. It has practice, it knows what&#x27;s coming. Being a zombie is like having two degrees. You&#x27;re extra qualified, and you probably groan a lot.
Here&#x27;s a list of the best zombies in PC games.

                    <span>A coalition of Hollywood studios plus Amazon, Netflix and Apple is urging a court in the US to issue an urgent injunction to prevent two pirate IPTV services from infringing their rights. In parallel, the defendant&#x27;s legal team argues that the plaintiffs&#x27; case is not only deficient but relies on &#x27;expert&#x27; evidence that is both biased and inaccurate.

                    <span>Dutch anti-piracy group BREIN collects IP addresses of persistent pirates and asks the associated ISPs to forward warnings to these subscribers. The Netherlands&#x27; largest ISP, Ziggo, refused to do so due to privacy concerns. This week, a local court agreed that ISPs indeed need a separate data processing license to forward BREIN&#x27;s warning letters.

                    <span>The 25th Annual DICE Awards are taking place later this month, and the Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences has announced head of Xbox, Phil Spencer will receive the prestigious AIAS Lifetime Achievement Award.
Presenting the award to Spencer will be industry luminary, and fellow Microsoft alumn Todd Howard, who was welcomed into the company through the acquisition of Bethesda Game Studios and its parent company ZeniMax Media, led by Spencer in 2019. In the announcement of the award recipient, the AIAS gave a summary of Phil&#x27;s history in the game industry including the new role of Microsoft Gaming CEO and the many studios he&#x27;s brought into the Xbox family. 
The list of accomplishments is long, and many have only come about in the last few years. The AIAS describes the Lifetime Achievement Award as &quot;reserved for individuals whose accomplishments span a broad range of disciplines over a lengthy career in the industry,&quot; and individuals do not necessarily need to be hands-on with development. It&#x27;s safe to say Phil Spencer has been a very influential force in the direction Xbox is heading this generation with its focus on powerful console hardware, flexible ecosystems that span the Xbox, PC, Mobile, and elsewhere, and popular services like Xbox Game Pass.
Meggan Scavio, President of the AIAS, was quoted saying, “Phil Spencer has demonstrated both passion and leadership throughout his entire career at Microsoft. He’s responsible for countless impactful and pivotal initiatives that have reverberated throughout the entire gaming industry.&quot; The award has been previously presented to Minoru Arakawa, Howard Lincoln, Ken Kutaragi, Doug Lowenstein, Bing Gordon, Satoru Iwata, and Genyo Takeda.
The 25th Annual DICE Awards will be held on February 24 at 8 p.m. Pacific at the Mandalay Bay Resort in Las Vegas.</span>

                    <span>Since its surprise launch last month, Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel has taken the world by storm. The free-to-play title based on the popular children’s card game trading card game has rocketed towards the top of Steam charts and Twitch streams, though a mobile release was the last big missing piece of its (millennium) puzzle. Switch has been the only option for playing on the go, but that changes today with the game’s launch on iOS and Android.
Although Master Duel became available on mobile a week ago in other countries, today marks its debut in North American territories. That means you can get Ash Blossom’d and stare down Eldlich the Golden Lord anywhere an internet connection allows. If you’re new to Master Duel, it’s basically a premium version of the traditional trading card game. Unlike Duel Links, Master Duel uses Master Rule 5 AKA the standard ruleset of the real-life game. Master Duel also supports cross-play and cross-progression, with Season 2 of ranked duels kicking off earlier this week. 
Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duels is also available on PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Switch, and PC. For more on the game, check out this opinion piece on how playing its ranked matches can be a good way of learning to put yourself out there.</span>

                    <span>Today, Tango Gameworks provided the first extended look at Ghostwire: Tokyo&#x27;s moment-to-moment gameplay and the other activities players can get into throughout its haunted Tokyo. A pair of videos provides a walkthrough of the game&#x27;s action, while a developer interview reveals the team&#x27;s design process. 
We already knew that the game’s story is set after Tokyo’s population disappears thanks to the arrival of dangerous Yokai, or spirits. You play as a lone survivor, Akito, who awakens possessed by a spirit named KK who imbues you with elemental powers. This power is called Ethereal Weaving, and let you channel the elements of fire, wind, and water. Executing these moves resembles a blend of Doctor Strange’s spellcasting and Avatar: The Last Airbender’s bending thanks to its flashy, elaborate hand gestures. Physical weapons complement your spells such as a bow and various talismans, and you can stealth attack enemies instead of blasting them head-on.  
Among other features, the first video shows off Akito tango ability, which lets him fire a spirit tether to grapple and ascend buildings. We also got a look at corrupted, fog-covered areas players must clear out and surreal shape-shifting areas that evoke the psychological horror of Tango Gamework’s previous series, The Evil Within.

And like any modern-day celebrity, Spider-Man always makes time to respond to Twitter followers or take goofy selfies with adoring fans. Yes, the new web-slinger is as dependable and personable as they come, but I know his greatest secrets. Miles Morales, the young man behind the mask, loves playing video games, producing groovy hip-hop beats, and conducting elaborate science experiments. He agonizes over his hair in the bathroom mirror and has a weak spot for dulce de coco. But, more importantly, he looks like me.

                    <span>Elden Ring is From Software’s latest offering in a line of dark fantasy action-RPG fare that has been continually refined and reinvented since Demon’s Souls landed on the PS3 back in 2009. While previous worlds have been immersive and captivating to explore, Elden Ring represents a grandiose shift.
From Software brings everything it’s achieved in the last decade of releases into this singular, massive entity that brings the best bits of its previous creations into a vibrant open world. As always, From Software’s honed duality of challenge and triumph go hand in hand, and players will find themselves continually tested against brutal opponents and unforgiving environments.

                    <span>Anyone paying attention to the video game landscape over the past month might feel like companies are in an ongoing war to buy up independent studios that make great products. 
The acquisition ball has pretty much always been rolling – it’s part of a companies growth – but Microsoft’s $7.5 billion acquisition of Bethesda really upped the ante. Then, earlier last month, Take-Two Interactive purchased Zynga, the company behind FarmVille and Words With Friends, for a massive $12.7 billion.

                    <span>I have played Vampire Survivors twice - that’s two (2) times - in total. In only that short space of time, the arcade-style game has sunk its teeth into me. You swat away hordes of monsters with weapons and magic that fire automatically. All it needs from you is one hand on the wheel. You are, in essence, the pale captain of a battleship that must weave its way through demons and bats. The garlic and holy water cannons will take care of the rest.
Not only do I crave more vampiric survival, but I also wish it had been released years ago. This is the perfect pre-lesson huddle. The perfect after-school treat. A nerdy talk generator for those locker chats.

                    <span>This week the Electronic Wireless Show podcast is going all in on our favourite finishing moves. This doesn&#x27;t just mean things from fighting games, although they do obviously make a good showing. As you can imagine, Nate makes the case for RTS games with what he and his pals term &#x27;the GG push&#x27;. Plus, we have a great Mortal Kombat themed Cavern Of Lies this week, courtesy of Matthew.
Much time is spent on some excellent digressions this week, including James McAvoy as a rampaging dinosaur from Jurassic Park (a state of affairs that I think would have improved his weird improv film My Son). Plus, could Matthew Save the world if he grew to six size the times of the earth and cut off a slab of his bum like a big steak, to feed us all? Will someone make a game like Deep Rock Galactic, but for mining Matthew&#x27;s celestial bum-meat? A whimsical episode this week indeed.

I know many of you have been asking for this feature since we redesigned the site last year, and I&#x27;m happy to say our tech team have delivered. Here&#x27;s how it all works.

                    <span>So good it will give you blisters. It&#x27;s a sentence you might read in a glossy 1990s PlayStation magazine ad. &quot;So good it will give you blisters,&quot; it says of the latest polygonal bloodsport, with a wired controller hanging from a ceiling, covered in gore. The hyperbole of a generation, a distortion of edgy marketing either aped or mocked by today&#x27;s advertising sophisticates. You get blisters from walking up hills, not video games. In the forensically sucky cyberpresent of 2022, there is no place for such exaggeration.
OlliOlli World is so good it will give you blisters. I know because I got one.

                    <span>Somehow, it has been one full year since Valheim entered early access. Seems unlikely. I&#x27;d buy six months, I&#x27;d buy two years, but one year? I don&#x27;t think so. Still, the makers are quite insistent, so let&#x27;s humour their charade and hear what they have to say about their future plans for the base-building Norse mythology survival game. Steam Deck support, caves in the Mountains biome, a pretty moth in the Mistlands... okay, sure.

Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League is delayed into 2023, a new report claims, though Warner Bros haven&#x27;t yet formally announced any such hold-up for the next game from the creators of the Batman: Arkham games.

Tato řada tedy končí svůj životní cyklus, což znamená, že už nebude od vývojářů dostávat žádné aktualizace a velmi rychle se v ní objeví nezáplatované bezpečnostní mezery.

                    <span>In 2009, the major record labels decided to remove DRM from music in the iTunes store. More than a decade has passed since but the issue could now make a comeback in a piracy liability lawsuit. Internet provider RCN plans to use it as a defense, while the labels claim that the DRM issue is old and irrelevant.

They say that Cloudflare has become an indispensable tool for many pirate sites and accuse the company of being uncooperative while failing to conduct due diligence.

                    <span>As the consolidation of the games industry continues, Sony buying Bungie is the acquisition that might most directly affect me, someone who has played over 2000 hours of Destiny 2. Bungie have said things will continue as normal on all platforms. But beyond the usual issues with consolidation and platformholders buying studios, the concerns I have for Destiny 2&#x27;s future stem from the same old source: Bungie&#x27;s own decisions. The grind needs to end.

                    <span>Western Digital are continuing their charge into high-speed PCIe 4.0 SSDs with the WD Black SN770. This is pretty straight down the middle as far as Gen 4 SSDs go: the 1TB model I’ve tested claims sequential speeds up to 5150MB/s for reads and 4900MB/s for writes, enough to embarrass any PCIe 3.0 SSD without veering into mega-enthusiast territory. There’s a broad range of capacities too, starting at 250GB and ending at a roomy 2TB.

SCP-173 is part of the SCP Foundation, a collaborative online horror writing project which most famously inspired Remedy&#x27;s Control, and has appeared in several SCP fan games, too. But as SCP&#x27;s administrators wrestle with copyright and morality issues, they&#x27;re preparing to remove that iconic image, which actually is a photo of a sculpture by a Japanese artist.

Plenty of words have been written about Techland’s backfiring boast of a three week runtime, so no need to relitigate that here. Going in, the only time value I was interested in was how long - if ever - the game takes to sink its teeth into you.

Mina The Hollower is its name, and retro action-adventure with Zelda and Castlevania influences is its game. Like with Shovel Knight, Yacht Club Games are partially crowdfunding Mina through a Kickstarter campaign, and in less than a day they&#x27;ve already passed the goal. Have a peek in the trailer.

                    <span>Capcom released an &#x27;HD&#x27; remaster of Resident Evil 4 in 2014, but their official makeover is nothing compared to the work by a small team of modders across almost eight years. Their mod, the Resident Evil 4 HD Project, is out now, and I think it&#x27;s the most impressive remaster mod ever made. In replacing the game&#x27;s textures and models with high-def versions, they&#x27;ve tried hard to replicate both the form and the style, and even tracked down locations and objects Capcom had photographed to work into textures. Dead impressive.

                    <span>Later this month, a 52-year old British man will be sentenced by a New York federal court for his role in the SPARKS piracy Scene group. Mr. Bridi, who was extradited to the US from Cyprus previously pleaded guilty. While the defense argues that a reduced sentence is warranted, the U.S. Government is asking the court to award a significant 27 to 33-month term to deter other pirates.

Every time they announce the next port in development, the howls of Bloodborne fans can be heard across the internet. When will From Software&#x27;s gothic slasher make the move to our superior home computers?

I&#x27;ve no answer for you, but fan-made demake Bloodborne PSX should tide you over for a little while. It&#x27;s Bloodborne as if made for 32-bit consoles, four hours long, and features the original game&#x27;s first two bosses. It&#x27;s out now.

                    <span>There&#x27;s no two ways about it: I&#x27;m a big old card-carrying Life Is Strange nerd. Seriously, I own some geeky merch to demonstrate my love for this series; up to and including, yes, the official Life Is Strange deck of playing cards. In other words, I am exactly the sort of fan the Life Is Strange: Remastered Collection is geared towards; so you may be surprised when I say that I&#x27;m not planning on picking it up anytime soon.
I&#x27;ll be honest, I&#x27;ve been wary of the remasters of the first Life Is Strange title and its prequel Before The Storm ever since the first stills were released. &quot;Look how much emotion their faces show now!&quot; was the boast, splashed across side-by-side images of Rachel frowning in the original vs Rachel smiling in the remaster, Chloe frowning in the original vs Chloe smiling in the remaster, Max smiling slightly in the original vs Max grinning widely in the remaster... perhaps you begin to see my issue.

                    <span>Hi, nice to meet you. Can I get you anything? A drink, a bite to eat, an acquisition maybe? There are apparently a lot of them to go around, after all. Hear that? It&#x27;s Sony buying Bungie. It&#x27;s Microsoft buying Activision Blizzard. It&#x27;s Tencent accidentally dropping £365 billion down a grate as they stroll down the street and unknowingly buy the Earth&#x27;s crust. They were on the phone to me at the time, putting an offer on my flat. I am tired of these big companies buying everything. Can we just slow down for a hot second and chill out a bit, please?

I don’t think any other SSD manufacturer so consistently goes quiet for months on end, then suddenly rocks up at your house, slams a world-beating NVMe drive on your desk and wordlessly disappears again. It happened with the A2000, it happened with the KC2500 and now it’s happened with the Fury Renegade.

For every aspect of worldbuilding that I enjoyed, there was a bug that had to be overlooked. For every character that I found charming, there was some voiceover that was jarring. For every area that was absolutely gorgeous there was a part of the script that made me extremely grateful for having editors on all my writing. Over and over, I found these flaws didn’t stop me from enjoying the core that I could see underneath. At least, until the game (as far as I can tell) bugged so badly that I literally couldn’t continue.

                    <span>I often find myself intrigued by games where you have to manage a business - not the slow, thoughtful ones like Strange Horticulture (which I like for a different reason), but the surprisingly deep management ones that are like strategy games except for coffee production instead of war.
I am usually catastrophically bad at these games, as I lack the sheer nerve to commit all my assets to something at once, or take out loans to cover a product run, even in a fictional digital setting. Still, I was drawn to Startup Panic like a moth to a flame, and giggled to myself at the prospect of cosplaying as a Silicon Valley nerd trying to reinvent having a chicken coop. I called my founder Beth, and the company was therefore Betherium. But it turned out that the product I was tasked with making and selling was, basically, Facebook.

                    <span>Popular TV-torrent distribution group ETTV has vanished. The official site has been offline for more than a week and many bots already stopped uploading content to third-party sites weeks ago. ETTV has recovered from internal troubles in the past but, without a word from the admin, a comeback is not expected anytime soon.

Rather than file a copyright infringement lawsuit in the United States, Shueisha, Kodansha, Shogakukan, and Kadokawa will file their complaint in Japan, demanding millions in damages and an end to the distribution of pirated content.

                    <span>The wag behind videos editing Austin Powers into Mass Effect and Mr Bean into Cyberpunk 2077 has returned to the shagadelic font. Just as Shepherd was reborn for Mass Effect 2, Powers rises again in the new video retelling BioWare&#x27;s sci-fi RPG sequel with England&#x27;s greatest secret agent. It remains funny and silly and an unexpectedly good fit.

                    <span>Just when you thought all the big movers and shakers had done their multi-billion dollar acquisition deals for the year, Sony have just announced they&#x27;re buying Bungie for $3.6 billion. A small sum, perhaps, in the face of the $69 billion Microsoft are currently shelling out for Activision Blizzard, but rather than simply subsuming the Destiny developer into the PlayStation mothership, president and CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment Jim Ryan has said that Bungie will &quot;remain an independent and multi-platform studio and publisher.&quot; Well!

                    <span>Following Code Force&#x27;s recent demonstration, I was optimistic about the upcoming space 4X/simulation/strategy/forward slash game Distant Worlds 2. The original was a game I very nearly adored, but playing it always meant being a little too frustrated to talk about it without complaining a lot (which, granted, I do about everything, but still).
Code Force have since sent us a preview build, and I&#x27;ve been consumed with it for the better part of a week. I&#x27;m struggling to gauge exactly how much to reserve, because it&#x27;s had me positively cackling at my minor successes and howling in enjoyable despair at my setbacks. If they can do, ooh, two thirds of what I&#x27;m hoping in the six weeks before its release on March 10th, this could be every bit as brilliant as its predecessor, with fewer flaws.

It&#x27;s codenamed Project Golden Nekker and... that&#x27;s about all we know for know. It&#x27;s not another &#x27;Witcher Tales&#x27; like the previous singleplayer Gwent game, like Thronebreaker: The Witcher Tales, and it is confirmed to have at least two (2) monsters. Possibly three (3) if you consider that man is the real monster. Or four (4) if you hate libraries.

                    <span>Even with a bunch of post-launch performance improvements, Microsoft Flight Simulator is still the kind of game that can make most PCs sweat. Good news, then, for frequent flyers who happen to own an Nvidia GeForce RTX graphics card: Flight Sim is getting DLSS support this year.


Specifically, DLSS will be available when running the sim in DirectX 12, as part of a handful of upcoming DX12 enhancements that also include optimisations for playing on multiple monitors. Developers Asobo Studio confirmed the DLSS addition in a recent devstream, which you can watch in full below, though the feature is still being tested so there’s no specific date beyond 2022.

In celebration, both the director of the original JRPG and the creative director of the recent FF7 Remake have posted messages looking back and forward. Along with several FF7 mobile games kicking about, they tease that more new FF7 things we don&#x27;t know about are coming. Hopefully this means we&#x27;ll hear more about efforts to complete the remake, but I guess they could also be talking about merch or new movies.

                    <span>It wouldn’t work without the sounds. The thwop of your whip, the thwick of your dagger. The electronic twinkle of health-restoring chicken, which sounds uncannily like the shield’s up sound from 1999 classic 3D Astro Blaster. The ‘boo boo de boo, boo boo de boop’ of the chest-opening jingle, to which my shoulders cannot help but shimmy. Best of all: the plink of picking up an XP-granting gem - at first a sporadic treat, soon a near constant hum as the tide of enemies grows from a trickle into a flood. 
Vampire Survivors is a simple, early access, arcade-style game about dodging an ever-growing horde of monsters while acquiring spells that fire automatically. You can (and should) play it with one hand while eating a bag of crisps. It’s a very good way to spend £2.

                    <span>Intel’s Arc graphics cards are, despite apparent delays, likely to launch this year. And not just with the expectation of being good GPUs, but with the hope that they can fix one of the biggest vexations in PC gaming: a years-long component shortage that’s made all of the best graphics cards nearly impossible to buy at fair prices.


Intel graphics chief Raja Koduri is at least well aware of the pressure, tweeting that the company is “working hard to find a path towards the mission - getting millions of Arc GPUs into the hands of PC gamers every year.” Koduri was responding to an open letter from our friends at PC Gamer, calling on Intel to finally toss an escape rope down the hardware hellmouth we’ve all found ourselves trapped in. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger also responded, claiming “We’re on it.”

Now 343 Industries think they&#x27;ve fixed the issue, with a patch due to be deployed sometime after February 3rd.

                    <span>This past week Blizzard announced a survival game set in an all-new universe. There were almost no other details about it and it was described as being at an &quot;early stage&quot;, but it seems the studio have been working on it for close to five years already.

                    <span>If you repeatedly download and share pirated content you risk losing your Internet access in the United States. Faced with liability lawsuits, ISPs are more inclined to take this drastic action today, which can have grave consequences. For one subscriber, downloading a Skyrim mod appears to have been too much. But is this really what the game&#x27;s creators want?

                    <span>This weekend I am looping the Assault On Precinct 13 theme to build the plodding determination I will need to survive the impending NFT bonanza. I do take some comfort in the fact that NFTs are so unpopular that Riot had scramble to cover after accidentally suggesting a Valorant character liked NFTs. And I especially enjoyed Yanis Varoufakis explaining why the metacryptofungiverse sucks. But more and more companies are talking about NFTs and things will get worse, and I&#x27;ll need the energy I can only get from Precinct 13 (and the amazing unused Jimmy Chambers song based on it).
But the terrible future can wait, what are you playing this weekend?

The games I&#x27;ve collected this week for the first TFI Friday of the year are going to ease us gently out of the time loop that we&#x27;ve been stuck in the last umpteen months. Accordingly, the first one is a time loop puzzle game.

                    <span>Through an entirely unplanned sequence of events, I&#x27;m currently playing two big action adventure games that couldn&#x27;t be less alike. One is God Of War, a big, serious dadventure epic about an emotionally distant father trying his darnedest to connect with his (at times very irritating) son. The other is Kena: Bridge Of Spirits, an altogether more wholesome adventure about a young girl cleansing a lush, forested mountainside from a serious case of bad vibes and helping lost ghosts pass on to the other side. 
About the only thing they have in common is that they both have what one might call &#x27;cute&#x27; NPC companions. Dad Of War is joined by his eager archer &quot;BOY!&quot; Atreus, while Kena has her gaggle of black, fluffy Rot friends (above, right). According to the widely accepted law of big googly-eyes, I should find the Rot absolutely adorable and thus beyond reproach. Atreus does not have big googly-eyes (they are merely wide and naive), but he is certainly a lot cuter than God Of War&#x27;s other main companion, a talking disembodied head. And yet. Even though Atreus has now reached that stage where he&#x27;s doing all his adolescent whining and rebellion and &quot;I know you are, but what am I?&quot; nonsense in the space of about two hours, I would much rather have this sulky pre-teen by my side than the interminable Rot. Let me explain.

                    <span>In theory, I miss auto scrolling arcade shooters and would love it if they came back. In reality, they come back all the time and I never really click with them because what I really miss is being a child and feeling like almost every game I saw was magical.
I&#x27;m pretty bad at them as well, which doesn&#x27;t help. Mostly though, I became jaded and curmudgeonly at around nine years old, and will never know such naive wonder again.
Still, Hyper Echelon is fun.

                    <span>They say everything is bigger in Texas. It&#x27;s a statement I have only briefly put to the test during a rushed weeked in San Antonio, a trip I mostly remember for 1) seeing a roadside billboard that advertised Jesus on one side and massive tits on the other, and 2) making a joke about having a puffy taco &quot;so I guess I should see a doctor!&quot; [finger guns] that fell bone-chillingly flat to a dinner table of American business colleagues.
You know where everything actually is bigger? The past. Join us on this special supporter-funded bonus podcast episode where Nate is our gentle and enthusiastic guide for really massive historical monsters. A giant owl? Bigfoot is really an orangutan? A huge fish that might in fact just be well big, owing to a mistake with its skeleton? Yes, we have all these delights and more. A big thank you to our supporters for making The Nate Files happen.

                    <span>With NFTs in games proving unpopular with almost everyone who doesn&#x27;t plan to get rich by fleecing other players, even appearing to support them is controversial. This is a situation Riot Games found themselves in after a lighthearted tweet about one of the Valorant wizards visiting an art exhibition on a day out. Turns out, the picture seen by Killjoy is an NFT. Cue Riot scrambling to make clear it was unintentional and say, literally, &quot;Whoopsie!&quot;

                    <span>Anecdotally, the first records of modern golf date back to its banning in 15th century Scotland. “Nay Golf,” said parliament. “It’s turning the soldiers into fiendish, turf-snorting club-strokers who’d rather say shit like ‘Triple Bogey’ than batter the English, and we’re no having it.” RPGolf Legends is not set in 15th century Scotland, but it does take place in a world where golf has been banned. Only you - through the power of bare-bones ARPG combat and a fun but limited golf mini-game - can save the noble sport from ostensible nonexistence. 
I say ostensible because, in reality, golf is everywhere. Our heroine Aerin’s hometown is called Mulligandale. It has two shops, one of them dedicated entirely to golf. Folk shimmy about in golfwear, talking about golf. Many give out golf-related quests, the rewards for which are usually some form of golfing paraphernalia, often golf balls. The actual golf courses themselves have been sealed off by an ill-defined big villainous, but if you put a translucent barrier around the thing you’re trying to crush and still let the people you’re attempting to terrorise build their entire society as a monument to it, you’re basically asking for a plucky hero to restore the national passtime to glory. Highly questionable bit of villainy, this.

It might be that it&#x27;s the best example of its genre, or it contains a valuable lesson for future generations. This month, we&#x27;re travelling back to rescue eight games from 2010, and cor, what a good year that was. Too bad almost all of them will end up in the lava bin by the time we&#x27;re done.

                    <span>Mech combat game Daemon X Machina launched as a Switch exclusive, came to PC in 2020, and is now free to keep if you grab it this week from Epic Games Store. It&#x27;ll be gone after February 3rd, at which point it&#x27;ll be replaced by Epic&#x27;s next free game, Yooka-Laylee And The Impossible Lair.

                    <span>Hyper Scape was launched suddenly in July 2020. Initially accessible only via Twitch drops, early streams gathered half a million viewers before it opened up to everyone ten days later.

Unfortunately its drop in popularity was just as sudden, and almost as immediate. Eighteen months later, Ubisoft have announced they&#x27;re ending development and shutting the game down on April 28th.

                    <span>Following a stretch on Stadia, a platform so forgotten I didn&#x27;t even know the game existed, a sequel to 2015&#x27;s lovely Submerged is venturing onto PC and beyond. I&#x27;m often not interested in games which reflect my daily life but Submerged: Hidden Depths makes it look so pretty to lark about in water and explore the ruins of civilisation that sure, I&#x27;ll do it in the game too. Check out the trailer below.

                    <span>Grapple Dog is one of those games I&#x27;ve been watching on Twitter for years. It&#x27;s a 2D platformer in which you play as a dog with a grappling hook. Grappling hooks are the best thing in video games, and I am fully ready to swing through a colourful, cute platformer. To my infinite delight, Grapple Dog now has a release date: February 10th.

                    <span>When Death Stranding&#x27;s PC pubishers announced in January that the expanded Death Stranding Director&#x27;s Cut was indeed coming belatedly to PC, they neglected to mention whether they&#x27;d offer a cheaper upgrade. Seeing as the newness is very much not worth buying the game again, it was a weird omission. But, now they say they&#x27;ll offer a £9/$10 upgrade from the base game, and announced a release date of the 30th of March. Right-o!

                    <span>Back in the mists of time of 2013, a bunch of Japanese developers got together to make a series of short 3DS games called the Guild series. Headed up by Ni No Kuni makers Level-5, it had some pretty big-name contributors: Keiji Inafune, Goichi Suda, Yoot Saito and Yasumi Matsuno among others. But there was one game that stood out to me as something really quite special. It was the considerably less well-known Millennium Kitchen&#x27;s Attack Of The Friday Monsters, a sweet slice of life adventure that saw you play as ten-year-old Sohta walking the streets of his small Tokyo suburb on a hazy summer afternoon in 1971. It was a tender celebration of childhood nostalgia and imagination, with just an inkling of some menacing undertones, both from the people Sohta meets in his neighbourhood and the titular Friday kaiju monsters that may or may not exist in the real world. 
I mention all this because The Kids We Were is probably the only game I&#x27;ve played since then that&#x27;s even come close to capturing some of that Attack Of The Friday Monsters magic. You won&#x27;t find any kaiju here, but this is a similarly nostalgic portrait of pastoral Tokyo, as viewed through the eyes of young Minato on his summer holidays, first in the present day and then in the 1980s when he ends up travelling back in time Back To The Future-style to when his parents first met as kids. With three days to right past wrongs, this is one of those gentle, coming of age tales that leaves you feeling warm and fuzzy in all the right places, even when there&#x27;s no real &#x27;game&#x27; to speak of.

                    <span>The latest DLC for Prison Architect was both announced and released yesterday. It&#x27;s called Perfect Storm and it adds &#x27;Calamities&#x27; to the game - disasters which can befall your prison that you need to build contingencies for and overcome. That includes weather such as lightning storms, heatwaves and snow storms, but also rat infestations.

                    <span>Epic have put out their year-in-review, looking at how the Epic Games Store performed across 2021. The takeaways: the store now has 194 million PC users, up 34 million from 2020; the number of games on the store is now 917, nearly double from the year before; and the weekly free game giveaways will continue in 2022.

                    <span>Hitman 3 had a rough launch on Steam last week, quickly gathering 50% negative user reviews. Many of the complaints related to price and confusion over the various editions on sale.
To make amends, Io Interactive are giving anyone who buys Hitman 3 on Steam before February 19th a free upgrade. If you buy the standard edition (£50/$60), you&#x27;ll be bumped up to the Deluxe Edition (£75/$90). If you bought the Deluxe Edition, you&#x27;ll get a free upgrade to the Seven Deadly Sins Collection (which on its own costs £23.73 with its 15% launch discount).
