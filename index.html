My roommate is a voice actress, which is insanely cool because it&#x27;s a world I know nothing about. Now I&#x27;m surrounded by it all the time, and she gives me all kinds of cool insight into the auditioning, recording, and editing processes. I have a whole new appreciation, because it&#x27;s an art form of its own, and it takes a ton of practice and dedication that I didn&#x27;t know about besides already having a nice voice to begin with. Plus, it&#x27;s fun to have someone around the house who can do a bunch of silly voices. I think so much more about voice acting now than I used to, and I&#x27;ve been noticing more conversations online about it, too.
For example, any time I see casting announcements for some new movie, it seems like it&#x27;s always some A-list actor who is most likely there for the…</span>

Hey! Hey! Hey! So happy to see you again, friends, and welcome to Whatcha Been Playing? You find Destructoid recuperating after several days of news, updates, and reveals that spilled out of Gamescom 2022. Did you see anything you liked? Gotta admit, it feels like The Geoff Showcase is starting to spread a little thinner, given that Summer Game Fest had a lot more &quot;big deal&quot; trailers and reveals.
Still, I&#x27;m all in for the aesthetic and style of Lies of P, and it&#x27;s pretty funny to see Killer Klowns from Outer Space get an adaptation nobody was expecting. But, for the most part, I&#x27;m not feeling much of what&#x27;s been on show this week, least of all the purposefully obscure Everywhere, which opened Gamescom with its obnoxiously abstract descriptions. Not for me, thanks. St…</span>

Graphic adventures can’t seem to settle themselves. Most new games seem to have to start at first principles and decide on their own verbs, loops, control scheme, puzzle types, difficulty, hint system… and it feels like there are more misses than hits. Which makes it all the more impressive that developer Happy Juice Games has come up with something that’s coherent, original, and a delight from start to finish.
Lost in Play, the first solo game from the Tel Aviv-based studio, has many of the hallmarks of golden-age point-and-click adventures: a cartoon style, humorously animated protagonists, item-based puzzles, and curiosity-piquing 2D scenes serving as both play space and reward for clearing the previous area. However, it also shakes off many of the classic bugbears: pixel hunting is impossible because you’re moving a character, not a cursor; using no words in the game leaves the hint system to be helpful but not too transparent; there’s very little backtracking because environments are kept small and the time in them is brief; and wacky dream logic is completely excused because you’re playing in children’s imaginations.

It has been three years since the last Pokémon World Championships, so the excitement for the 2022 event had been building for a long while.
For the first time ever, the Pokémon World Championships were held outside of North America, taking place in the UK at the ExCeL London and it brought massive crowds of Pokémon fans together for the first time in a very long time.

Last week, it was the turn of Wave Race 64 to come under BAB scrutiny — which was fitting as the game launched on the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pass service. it was a close (wave) race between the top two, but Japan won with 51% of the votes. North America did pretty well for itself too, bagging 42%, but Europe looks like it crashed into the waves with only 7%. It&#x27;s those black borders, we tell you!

When the Nintendo Switch made its debut in March 2017, it was already lagging behind the competition in terms of performance. It&#x27;s resulted in some rough-looking ports such as ARK: Survival Evolved as well as &quot;impossible ports&quot; including games like The Witcher 3 and Doom Eternal.
With all the rumours about the Switch getting a successor sooner or later, Digital Foundry has decided to investigate the games on Nintendo&#x27;s current generation hardware with some of the lowest resolutions and see if a follow-up to its latest system could possibly improve the situation.

                              <span>Arriving this November.
It&#x27;s been another exciting week for Sonic the Hedgehog fans, with Sega not only releasing a new trailer for Sonic Frontiers at Gamescom&#x27;s Opening Night Live but also confirming the title would be arriving on all platforms (including the Nintendo Switch) on 8th November.
With this anticipated &quot;open-zone&quot; entry getting closer by the day, it seems we&#x27;ve now got an idea of the file size for the Switch eShop version of the game. As shared by Nintendo Everything, Sonic Frontiers is currently listed on Nintendo&#x27;s digital store as being 10.4GB in size. In contrast, Sonic Forces on Switch was 6.6GB, and Sonic Colors: Ultimate was just 6.8GB.

Masahiro Sakurai launched his very own YouTube earlier this week, and he&#x27;s already discussed a number of interesting subjects about game development. In his latest video, he talks about how frame rates work in video games.

Monday is a bank holiday for us here in the UK, so we&#x27;ll leave you with Alice Bee until the rest of us return on Tuesday (well, aside from those of us taking more time). This is the last big holiday weekend of summer, a traditional time to get out in the countryside or down to the seaside. Could use a little heat and joy with the terrible, terrible winter to come. Anyway! What are you playing this weekend? Here&#x27;s what we&#x27;re clicking on!

Hundreds, if not thousands of great games have come out in the past fifteen years, but one that will always fall at the top of that list is BioShock, the classic FPS game set in the underwater city of Rapture. While to many it feels like the game didn&#x27;t come out all that long ago, BioShock was actually released August 21, 2007 — exactly fifteen years ago from this past Sunday, and we&#x27;re celebrating the anniversary.
The whole BioShock series got a remaster and rerelease as a collection back in 2016, and when I replayed the games on my PS4, I was shocked at how well they&#x27;ve aged. Sure, the graphics got a welcome update, but the game&#x27;s design, story, and characters have aged like fine wine. Its iconography, from the Big Daddies to the S…</span>

Publisher Microids, perhaps best known for its love of classic gaming franchises and media IPs, has announced that it is launching its own music label, Microids Records. The new in-house venture will focus on releasing soundtracks from the French publisher&#x27;s litany of PC and console games.
&quot;Microids Records and the new Entertainment Division are testaments of Microids’ willingness to develop the company’s brands and contents wider than the video game medium,&quot; said Microids&#x27; VP of entertainment, Frédéric Claquin. &quot;Being able to launch this label with two original scores signed by Inon Zur is a blessing and a true honour, especially as we celebrate the Syberia series&#x27; 20th anniversary.&quot;
As noted in the above statement, the first two releases from the label will be Inon Zur&#x27;s dramatic scores to adventure titles Syberia 2 (2004) and Syberia 3 (2017). Going forward, fans can expect further releases from the new label, which has been formed as part of Microids&#x27; ongoing desire to increase its merchandising output beyond the realm of the physical video games themselves.
&quot;This music label launch is a major milestone for Microids” adds company CEO Stéphane Longeard. &quot;We have always had at heart to offer music scores enhancing the games we are creating and paying tribute to our great IPS, collaborating with renown artists like Inon Zur for instance. We are fully aware about the importance of a great musical atmosphere for players, and we cannot wait to share what will be released next under the Microids Records label!&quot;
Microids&#x27; next release, Asterix &amp; Obelix XXXL: The Ram From Hibernia, will launch on October 13.

                              <span>An easy recommendation for 3D platformer fans
Tinykin isn&#x27;t the Pikmin-inspired game I thought it would be, but that&#x27;s okay. More than okay, actually. It&#x27;s still a great 3D platformer with a slick sense of speed, an interesting world to explore, and yes, some nods to Nintendo&#x27;s creature-chucking strategy series.
If you&#x27;re someone who enjoys hunting down collectibles, it&#x27;s a must-play. If you&#x27;re more on the fence, and run the risk of feeling overwhelmed with too many trinkets to find, I can still recommend Tinykin. It&#x27;s never unreasonable, and there&#x27;s little if any downtime.
The indie game scene has been killing it with shorter yet still satisfying experiences, and this one&#x27;s a fantastic distillation, albeit with a few elements I wish went further.

                              <span>Playing with the Boys
Something a little more low-key from the retro fun-fans over at Hamster this week, as the labyrinthine Arcade Archives has been bolstered with the arrival of Video System&#x27;s hard-spikin&#x27; Super Volleyball on PS4 and Nintendo Switch.
Released to the arcade market in 1989, before receiving home ports on the Sega Mega Drive and the TurboGrafx-16, Super Volleyball is an incredibly typical take on the high-jumping beach sport. Two teams of four players battle it out on a very basic 2D plane, with each team representing one of eight global nations.
While Super Volleyball features neat animation and some neat picture-in-picture cutscenes, it has a generally clunky vibe and seems dated, even by 1989 standards. The same year would see other sports titles such as Midway&#x27;s Arch Rivals, Technos&#x27; WWF Superstars, and Sega&#x27;s Super Monaco GP. By comparison, Video System&#x27;s release feels several years out of time and is admittedly a tough recommend in 2022.
You can check out the action in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber Victory-Class Star Destroyer. Super Volleyball is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.

I don&#x27;t have to tell you guys this, but I will anyway: Destructoid has the best community on the internet. Over the ten-plus years I&#x27;ve been around and five-plus I&#x27;ve been on staff, I&#x27;ve made friends, colleagues, met several community members from far and wide, and even met my wife — all thanks to the power of community.
So when a community member gets involved in the industry, it&#x27;s our civic duty to highlight their achievements and shill their wares on the site! After all, you get what you give.

Of all of the announcements, of all of the franchises, of all of the adaptations, I wouldn&#x27;t have put a single penny on this one. And yet, here we are, less than 24 hours from the Gamescom Opening Night Live presentation and the news that somebody, somewhere, decided to put pen to paper and sign a contract to produce a brand new video game, in 2023, based on Killer Klowns from Outer Space.
Asymmetrical horror games are all the rage right now, despite being something of a mixed bag and a niche market. Major franchises such as Friday the 13th and The Evil Dead have both had a shake of the multiplayer scythe, while Behavior Interactive&#x27;s Dead by Daylight is a literal who&#x27;s who of horror&#x27;s grimmest superstars, having played host to Freddy Krueger, Michael Mye…</span>

Hello hello! Tonight on stream we&#x27;ll be trying Thymesia, an action RPG with a plague theme and a similar feel to Dark Souls.
As an avid soulslike lover, I&#x27;m super interested, so I can&#x27;t wait to share it with you guys! I think we&#x27;re the perfect candidates to scope this one out. The combat system has high praise even though some reviewers have felt it falls a bit short of soulslike glory, but that comparison is difficult in the first place, so I&#x27;m excited either way.

See you tonight!
Drop by Destructoid’s Twitch channel at 9:00 p.m. Eastern to hang out.

Players can add Styanax, the 50th Warframe, to their arsenal for free for a limited time. The new frame will go live in September on all platforms as part of the Veilbreaker update. The new warrior will be available for up to two weeks, after the update launches.
If you&#x27;re unfamiliar with Warframe, it&#x27;s a free-to-play live-service shooter where the player can operate different mechanized suits called Warframes. Each one has its own special abilities and design, letting players swap around how they play.
Styanax is inspired by Greek mythology, specifically the warrior Astyanax, the son of Hector. …</span>

Nobody Saves the World was a fun Game Pass romp from Guacamelee&#x27;s Drinkbox Studios, and it&#x27;s getting a bit bigger with the upcoming Frozen Hearth DLC. The best part of the game is completing combat challenges to power up your different character forms and unlock new variations, and on that front, we&#x27;re getting a killer bee and mechanic form.

Once the $4.99 DLC launches on September 13, you&#x27;ll be able to compete in The Tempering, &quot;a series of puzzles and challenges that will push players&#x27; transformation skills and creativity.&quot; And after unlocking the mechanic and bee, they&#x27;ll be usable in the base game. Speaking of which, I still need to finish my New Game+ run for the platinum trophy.

Dotemu and Tribute Games&#x27; excellent Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder&#x27;s Revenge recently fired up our passion for the heroes in a half-shell in a way we haven&#x27;t felt for a long time. With the imminent release of Konami&#x27;s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection, we&#x27;re getting ready to drown in another wave of excitement and nostalgia very soon.
With so many TMNT games having come to Nintendo consoles over the years, it&#x27;s tough to know exactly where to begin, let alone which Ninja Turtle (or Hero Turtle in the UK) to choose once you do settle on a game. So, to help sort through them all, we asked you lovely Nintendo Life readers to rate the Turtles games you have played and help us rank every TMNT game on Nintendo systems — and the result is below.

The landscape of the Mario Kart series looks very different today than it did back in 1992 when Super Mario Kart was released for the Super NES.

However, at its heart, Nintendo’s top racing franchise is today very much the same game that it was 30 years ago.
Across the titles in the Mario Kart series, each entry has had to work, naturally, within the technical boundaries of its respective console.

Although there&#x27;s already a limited-time Pokémon Sword and Shield distribution event taking place, The Pokémon Company has announced one.
This time it&#x27;s a &quot;special Clefairy&quot;. The catch is it&#x27;s a Japan-only distribution... at least for now. This event will run from 3rd September - 11th September and the code can be acquired from Pokémon Centers in Japan.

You didn&#x27;t think we would be missing Splatoon 3&#x27;s first Splatfest, did you? Taking place from 9am until 9pm BST, the Splatfest World Premiere brings us our first taste of what Splatoon 3&#x27;s Splatfests will feel like. While they look pretty similar to Splatoon 2&#x27;s own, the added three-team aspect and the Tricolor Turf War are adding a decidedly purple and yellow twist.
Well, now that the Splatfest is live, why not join us? The lovely Alex, Zion, and Felix will be hopping into the demo at 6am PDT / 9am EDT / 2pm BST / 3pm CEST, and you can watch them sling ink at the field (and others) over on YouTube! They&#x27;re representing Team Scissors, which means Nintendo Life is a big fan of Big Man.

                              <span>Ladies and gentlemen, The Weekend.
As the great Captain Haddock once said, &#x27;what a week, huh?&#x27; It seems that in the run-up to Splatoon 3&#x27;s release, Nintendo has been hitting us with inky news left, right and centre (splaturation, if you will). This week, we got a chance to go hands-on with the upcoming game, and we are sure that some of you will be doing the same this weekend as the Splatfest World Premier demo is now available to download from the Switch eShop.
While this week&#x27;s Gamescom Opening Night Live and Nintendo Treehouse presentation has got us looking towards the future, you might wish to take a smaller scale approach to this weekend&#x27;s gaming with both the mouse-based Islets and RITE scurrying onto Switch consoles.

                              <span>Happy World Rock Paper Scissors Day from Nintendo!
Splatoon 3&#x27;s Splatfest World Premiere is home to Splatoon 3&#x27;s first Splatfest, and the event kicks off today in all regions! Aptly taking place on World Rock Paper Scissors Day, you&#x27;ll be able to try out the new Splatfests, including the brand new Tri-Color Turf War, in online matches throughout the day.
The Splatfest is split into two halves - the first six hours will be dedicated to the Splatfest Battles, where it&#x27;s 1-v-1 paint-splattering battles all the way. Then, for the second six hours, you&#x27;ll be getting into some 4-v-2-v-2 battles with a messy triple-team battle. To join in the Splatfest, you&#x27;ll need to download the Splatfest World Premiere demo and swear allegiance to one of the three teams (let us know what you&#x27;re going for in our poll!).

Splatoon 3 isn&#x27;t officially out until next month, but it seems Nintendo is already taking action against cheaters. Well-known Nintendo dataminer OatmealDome has revealed the company&#x27;s anti-cheat measures are already in place for Splatoon 3 - targeting players who modify the new entry in the series.
It seems Nintendo is issuing console bans (possibly including a &quot;total ban&quot; from the Nintendo Switch Online service). OatmealDome goes on to explain how there was a certain patch being &quot;shared around&quot; that allowed players to enter the testing range early in this weekend&#x27;s Splatfest demo, which has probably resulted in bans.

Deadline has revealed Netflix&#x27;s live-action Resident Evil series has been axed after its first season. The streaming service will not be ordering a second season of the action-horror series based on Capcom&#x27;s popular video games.
Although it debuted in the top 10 on Netflix, Resident Evil went outside of the most watched shows after only three weeks. Critics gave it 55% on Rotton Tomatoes and the audience score was 27%. In our own review here on Nintendo Life, we labelled the series &quot;yet another misfire in the world of live-action adaptations&quot;.

Over the next few weeks, we’ll be covering the history and lore of Capcom’s premiere action franchise. On this episode, we&#x27;ll say &quot;Jackpot&quot; to Season 6 as we conclude with the latest title in the series, Devil May Cry 5.
Released March 8, 2019, Devil May Cry 5 serves as a return to the classic timeline after an over-decade-long hiatus. Nero reprises his starring role, but he&#x27;s joined by Dante and mysterious newcomer V. The three demon slayers, alongside familiar allies, unite to combat a powerful demon lord.

                              <span>Not since the cruelly overlooked Blast-off has a game so accurately pressed the faster! button in my brain.
Neodash is a type of racing game that pops up relatively often; a time trial crossed with an obstacle course and a little of what I suppose is the endless runner. Picture Trackmania but with the courses condensed into short bursts of high speed dodging and you&#x27;re basically there. They&#x27;re often very throwaway and don&#x27;t really hold my interest for long. Neodash grabs hold immediately.

                              <span>I think it&#x27;s fair to say Killer Klowns From Outer Space: The Game was one of the more... leftfield reveals from this week&#x27;s Gamescom Opening Night Live bonanza. In case you missed it, it&#x27;s a 3v7 asymmetrical multiplayer adaptation of the cult 1988 horror film of the same name, but details on how its creepy clowning around would actually work were few and far between, to say the least. Thankfully, I sat in on a developer presentation earlier this week to find out exactly how it stacks up to other asymmetrical horror film games out there at the moment, as well as how it hopes to evolve and redefine the hide-and-seek genre as a whole.

                              <span>Rollerdrome is an all-action skater/shooter set in a dystopian, but near, future. Protagonist Kara Hassan is the newest competitor in Matterhorn’s games, hosted by the corrupt International Rollerdrome Federation. Your job is to skate through 12 intense arena maps battling both the house players and yourself, dodging attacks as you replenish your ammo with sick tricks to stay in the fight. With enough combo multipliers and top completion times, you might come out as the champion.

The games are called Penny Blood and Armed Fantasia (no points for guessing who&#x27;s making what), and based on what I&#x27;ve seen so far, I&#x27;m intrigued.

                              <span>The WD Black SN770 is a good middle-of-the-road PCIe 4.0 SSD, outperforming PCIe 3.0 SSDs while costing less than the very fastest PCIe 4.0 models. It launched at £125 for a 1TB size earlier this year, but now it&#x27;s down to £84 where it&#x27;s rather more fetching. The 2TB size has also been reduced and is even better value at £152. Here&#x27;s why we rate these SSDs - and where to find them at the lowest price.
Let&#x27;s do the &#x27;where to find them&#x27; bit first. It&#x27;s quite simple: WD&#x27;s UK store is offering the 1TB at the best price right now, while Ebuyer is the place to go if you&#x27;d prefer the larger 2TB model.

                              <span>It wouldn&#x27;t be Gamescom without a Geoff Keighley liveshow to kick it all off, would it? Tuesday&#x27;s Opening Night Live showcase featured a huge amount of trailers to gawk at, a baggage carousel of content that moved at a blistering clip. Despite its two hour runtime a lot of interesting (and in most cases, new) titles weren&#x27;t given a huge amount space to breathe, their moment in the spotlight frequently cut short by another trailer waiting impatiently in the wings.


You&#x27;d be forgiven, then, for missing a few bits and pieces because you were blinking really fast or distracted by the cat eating something unknown underneath your coffee table. Not to worry though, as I&#x27;ve once again gathered team RPS to tell me in detail about the games that caught their attention during Geoffcom 2022.


Much like our E3 roundup from earlier in the summer, each RPS staffer took ten minutes out of their day to wax lyrical about an upcoming project featured within the showcase. All eight (including yours truly, who thanks to Katharine actually remembered to contribute this time around) chose completely different games. Some picks are more obvious, whereas others are a little off piste. In a good way, of course!

                              <span>The Steam Deck is a brilliant system, but its internal storage is limited - from anywhere from 64GB to 512GB depending on the model you chose. Thankfully, Micro SD cards are getting extremely affordable, even in massive sizes all the way up to 1TB. Smaller sizes like 256GB and 512GB are better value per gigabyte, but today in the UK there&#x27;s been a big discount on a 1TB Lexar Play Micro SD card that brings it into contention too. 
The Lexar Play 1TB is now retailing for £110 at Amazon, compared to a usual price of £140. If you&#x27;d prefer something a little more high performance, the highly-rated SanDisk Extreme 1TB card is also on sale, dropping from £220 to £140.

                              <span>Swedish media buyer-uppers Embracer Group have completed their $300 million (£253 million) acquisition of former Square Enix studios, begun in May this year.

                              <span>Minecraft Legends was first announced at Geoff Fest earlier this year, and a smidge more footage dropped again at a Nintendo Direct Mini. But despite both of these events, it&#x27;s been difficult to ascertain what the game actually, well, is. Aside from being a real-time strategy spin-off, there&#x27;s been nothing else to scan with our eyeballs for more info.
Colour me intrigued, then, as I sat in a quickfire presentation at this year&#x27;s Gamescom and bore witness to some mythical gameplay. I can now report that what Minecraft Legends appears to be is as mix of real-time strategy and building, made all the more approachable by being set in Minecraft&#x27;s colourful cube-verse.

                              <span>Eight years ago Graham (who used to be to blame for all of this) got hands-on with Dead Island 2, back when the game was being developed by Yager, the folks behind Spec Ops: The Line. Since then, development changed hands like a baton at the Olympic relay; Yager left a year later, to be replaced by Sumo Digital, only for Sumo Digital to leave and be replaced by Dambuster Studios. Usain Bolt hasn&#x27;t expressed interest yet, but there&#x27;s time.
So going into a 20-minute hands-on with the game in the year 2022, I was a bit apprehensive. What sort of Frankenstinian horror awaited me behind closed doors? But, far from a shambling mess, what I played was a zombie &#x27;em up that seemed close to what Graham saw in 2014, only polished up to a surprising, bloody gloss.

                              <span>Dunno if you’ve noticed by there’s an awful lot of sci-fi games on the way, most of which – these being games – revolve around shooting space creatures to glowing green bits. Deliver Us Mars, the recently delayed sequel to Deliver Us The Moon, takes a more peaceful option, now blending the original’s puzzling with some Tomb Raider reboot-style platforming. Your deadliest enemy here is gravity, and as far as I understand, you can’t shoot that.

                              <span>Amazon are intending to announce they’ve made an offer to buy publishing colossus Electronic Arts later today, according to a new report from USA Today’s For The Win, who cite sources from Swedish gaming agency GLHF. No clue yet as to how much they’d be paying, but it’s likely to be ranging in the hundreds of millions to billions of dollars. Maybe just not as many as Microsoft’s $68.7 billion buyout of Activision Blizzard, revealed in January.

                              <span>Streaming giants Netflix have a BioShock movie to make and, after pointing their golf club at various directors, they’ve selected Francis Lawrence. He’s best known for overseeing three of The Hunger Games movies and is working on the prequel coming out next year, The Ballad Of Songbirds And Snakes. 


Netflix have also hired screenwriter Michael Green for the BioShock flick. Green wrote the Kenneth Branagh versions of Agatha Christie’s Murder On The Orient Express and Death On The Nile. I guess that means he’s got experience of period settings.

The ink has dried on Embracer Group&#x27;s purchase of three former Square Enix studios. Crystal Dynamics, Eidos Montreal, and Square Enix Montreal are all now part of the Embracer Group.
Embracer&#x27;s acquisition was announced in May earlier this year, for a reported sum of around $300 million USD. Today, Embracer Group confirms that all conditions for the transaction, including regulatory approvals, have been fulfilled.
This purchase doesn&#x27;t just include the three studios, but several notable IPs that these studios have worked on. Those include Tomb Raider, Deus Ex, Thief, and The Legacy of Kain. However, Square Enix is still set to retain certain IPs.
In a post from the Crystal Dynamics social media account today, it&#x27;s confirmed that Square Enix Montr…</span>

I don’t tend to play games for escapism. The whole “escape from the world’s problems by going to a fantasy world” doesn’t work for my brain. Finding a game that actually gets me to relax is difficult. Even some games that are intended to be relaxing seem to have the opposite effect on me. What I’ve found that works are games that don’t allow me to think about anything else, such as Doom Eternal, management games, and simulators like Densha De Go 64.
I actually picked up Densha De Go 64 because I love the N64 and saw the game’s special controller. I knew I needed it. What I didn’t realize at the time was that the sound of the rail joints and the shouts of oncoming signals were the perfect mix to get me to vegetate on the couch.

Sony made a bold move yesterday by announcing that it will be increasing the retail price of the PS5 in regions outside the United States, including Japan, Europe, and Canada. Sony Interactive Entertainment President and CEO Jim Ryan said this is due to the &quot;global economic environment,&quot; which basically means that they&#x27;re blaming inflation. Check out this post to see the updated prices for all affected regions, which are already in place (with the exception of Japan on September 15).
In the wake of this news, other companies have made statements in response, including Xbox, which says there are &quot;no plans&quot; to increase the price of their consoles, and now, Nintendo is echoing the same sentiment when it comes to Switch price…</span>

During its Gamescom 2022 presentation, Capcom offered up exciting new info on its fantasy adventure, Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak. The publisher not only dropped a release window for the expansion&#x27;s next update but also treated Sunbreak fans to a fresh trailer, spotlighting the deadly Flaming Espinas.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;oxd3Dv4LTQw
Coming late September, the flashily-monikered &quot;Update 2&quot; will add a selection of new beasties to the game world, all ready and raring to be placed inside your trophy cabinet, or to make you a part of theirs. Leading the pack is the Flaming Espinas, a creature first discovered in 2008 PC release Monster Hunter Frontier Season 2.0. While typical in stature to the common Espinas, this variant boasts a hazardous orange glow, warning prey that its devastating flame breath is getting set to cinder.
Along with the arrival of this scary giant, Update 2 will feature new Rare creatures as well as &quot;powered-up variants of Sunbreak&#x27;s more familiar fare. Players should also most likely expect a fresh run of balance tweaks and bug stomps, ensuring that all is well in the lands of Kamura. A third update, coming this winter, will round out Sunbreak&#x27;s 2022 content, though further quests, monsters, gear, and other additions are planned for release as we head into 2023.
Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak is available now on PC and Nintendo Switch.

The creators behind two RPG franchises are joining forces to crowdfund. Wild Arms and Shadow Hearts are teaming up for a &quot;double Kickstarter&quot; to fund spiritual successors to both series.
Shadow Hearts creator Matsuzo Machida and Wild Arms creator Akifumi Kaneko announced the news today. The double Kickstarter campaign is for two games: Armed Fantasia and Penny Blood.
The first, Armed Fantasia, is a follow-up to Wild Arms set in a similar Westernpunk world. Kaneko will handle lead game design and scenario writing, while Tomomi Sasaki is on the character design. Music for Armed Fantasia will be by Michiko Naruke, Noriyasu Uematsu, and Elements Garden.

Just a few days ago, the Smash Ultimate screen-a-day fun ended, but another journey began: a Sakurai YouTube channel. He kicked things off by posting three videos: one that introduced the channel, one that introduced himself, and another that talked about the development concept of lingering.
In just two days he&#x27;s now amassed nearly 300,000 subscribers (283K at the time of publication), and has posted two more videos, which you can find below. He also has a Japanese YouTube channel, which has a comparable 246K subscribers at the time of publication. Since he provides English subtitles for his aforementioned English channel anyway while speaking in Japanese, the main difference for the latter is that the on-screen text is actually in Japanese — in addition to native language subtitles.

Kirby&#x27;s Dream Land:
For five minutes, Sakurai talks about Kirby&#x27;s Dream Land in the new Sakurai YouTube channel clip. The 1992 Game Boy classic kicked off the series — and was also the first game Sakurai directed!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;Rjdmi7628GM
Frame rates:
In a topic that isn&#x27;t touched upon that often by folks who work on first-party Nintendo games, Sakurai walks us through the basics of frame rates in the video game industry. Sakurai&#x27;s YouTube channel video even goes into the &quot;standard&quot; of 30FPS and mentions Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Shadow of the Colossus in his lecture.

                              <span>Feel the emotion
The Last of Us Part I hits next week, and today Naughty Dog showed off the accessibility features included in the remake. Among them is a pretty fascinating new feature for deaf players. It plays dialogue through the PlayStation 5&#x27;s DualSense, letting players &quot;feel&quot; the delivery of dialogue.
Over on the PlayStation Blog, The Last of Us Part I game director Matthew Gallant discusses some of the new accessibility features the team has developed. The DualSense dialogue tool started out as a prototype, in fact. And during playtesting, the team at Naughty Dog found it to be really successful. The feature, when toggled on, plays dialogue through the PS5 DualSense controller via haptic feedback.
&quot;That way a deaf player can feel the way a line is delivered, can feel the emphasis, along with the subtitles to give some sense of how that line is delivered,&quot; said Gallant.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;LINKh60I8CY
Another new feature the team has is audio description for cinematics. Naughty Dog partnered with Descriptive Video Works, a service that works in TV, movies, and game trailer, to integrate audio description into cutscenes and across all localized languages.
Easing access
Alongside the new tools, The Last of Us Part I also features a ton of the accessibility features seen in Part 2. This includes vision accessibility, with tools like High Contrast Display and HUD scaling. Hearing accessibility tools are also available, adding subtitle names and direction, as well as pick-up notifications and awareness indicators.
It&#x27;s nice to see Naughty Dog carry on with these features into future games. The Last of Us Part II was recognized for its accessibility features. It&#x27;s cool to see developers to continue building on and prototyping new features that can only help more people engage with their games.
The Last of Us Part I hits PlayStation 5 on September 2, 2022.

                              <span>Russian studio Konfa Games also acquired
American Publisher tinyBuild Inc, following a particularly expensive morning, has announced that it has acquired several IPs from indie studio Bossa Games. As reported by GamesIndustry.biz, the memeriffic &quot;comedy physics&quot; titles Surgeon Simulator, I am Bread, and I am Fish were purchased by tinyBuild for an &quot;upfront payment&quot; of $3 million USD.
Following the closure of this purchase, tinyBuild will now manage developmental control of all three titles, while Bossa Studios will move on to new projects. Despite the relative simplicity of the games, the former Bossa franchises have raked in millions of dollars in revenue since their respective releases.

&quot;Since early 2022, Bossa has been focused exclusively in the genre of co-op PvE. We have been prototyping a lot, and now find ourselves in full production of titles we are pouring our hearts and souls into,&quot; writes Bossa co-founder Henrique Olifiers of the company&#x27;s future. &quot;This brought us to the question of how best to take care of our legacy, our existing games, and how to ensure they have a future of their own.&quot;
&quot;Together with TinyBuild, we found a path that allows Bossa to dedicate its full attention to its new projects, while ensuring Surgeon Simulator, I Am Bread and I Am Fish have a new home that understands what makes these games tick as well as we do.&quot;
In addition to the Bossa IP acquisition, tinyBuild also announced that it has purchased independent Russian studio Konfa Games for $5.4 million. It is reported that the Konfa team will now relocate to tinyBuild&#x27;s Serbian headquarters, where it will continue development on its current projects, including the cartoonish roguelike Despot&#x27;s Game: Dystopian Army Builder, which is available now on PC.

Sloclap&#x27;s Sifu is already a fairly challenging game to conquer. But for those who want even more of a mountain to climb, a Sifu update is adding some new modifiers and a scoring system later this month to really up the bar.
The summer update for Sifu goes live on August 31, and adds several new features. Gameplay modifiers are a big one, letting those who have already mastered the motions in Sifu impose even more challenge.
Sifu&#x27;s new modifiers can change a number of things. Maybe it takes away guarding, or reduces your main character to a single hit point. Or maybe it makes things a bit easier, letting the player ignore enemies&#x27; guard or stopping them from picking up weapons.

Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak is going to be getting a steady stream of major updates, but today we got a patch that could definitely be considered minor. It&#x27;s Sunbreak patch notes time.
One of the big fixes involves anomaly investigations, which have been bugged lately (namely when it comes to search conditions, as well as &quot;unauthorized quest&quot; and harvesting errors). Weapons and armor occasionally have had issues with specific decorations and augmentation, which have been cleared up. It&#x27;s basically fixing some issues the last major patch ushered in.
As always, Capcom reminds folks that you&#x27;ll need a Switch Online membership to play online, and that you can check the version of your current build on the bottom right-hand side of the title screen. For Switch it&#x27;s version 11.0…</span>

I think one of the reasons I fell so hard for Animal Crossing back on the GameCube was it transported me back to a simpler era in my life. In the fall of 2002, I started my senior year of high school amongst strangers as my family moved to the area just a few weeks before. It was the third and final high school of my academic career, and while in hindsight I appreciate the fact I didn’t bother to get too close to anyone because I was zipping off to college the next year, it was a less than ideal situation for an awkward dweeb on the precipice of adulthood. That’s why I spent so many hours retreating into my Animal Crossing town, spending my evenings hanging out by the river and walking through the trees just as I did when I was a k…</span>

                              <span>We need more &quot;offline-ifications&quot; of MMOs
It feels like forever ago that I was clamoring for Dragon Quest X offline, and it&#x27;s finally coming out: in Japan only!
You can find the trailer below, which refreshes the 2012 MMO original for its new offline packaging. If you&#x27;re interested and want to pick up the Japanese version, Square Enix has a website dedicated to pre-orders. In classic Square Enix fashion there&#x27;s some extras to be had, as well as the opportunity to pick up the PC, PS4, PS5, and Switch editions of the game.
As for details, it&#x27;s still being billed as a single-player RPG, which kind of goes with the territory of the offline pivot. Dragon Quest X offline will arrive on September 15, 2022 in Japan, but there&#x27;s also going to be an &quot;ultra large expansion&quot; coming in spring of 2023. The standard edition will run you roughly $60 US, while the special edition is about $115 US, and includes the expansion, physical pins, a slime mug, and a spoon for said mug. The list of in-game items can be found here.
You can also go for the digital deluxe edition that nets you the core game and the expansion for about $95 US. Options! Well, for folks who want to pick up the Japanese edition of the game, at least.

Capcom has started to reveal its itinerary for the upcoming Tokyo Game Show (TGS) 2022 event, which is scheduled to take place next month at Chiba City&#x27;s Makuhari Messe complex. In addition to appearances from Resident Evil Village, Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection, and Exoprimal, Capcom will also be bringing a brand new build of its incoming blockbuster, Street Fighter 6.
The new build will differ from that currently being courted at Gamescom, Summer Game Fest, and VS Fighting in that it will feature playable appearances from characters Guile, Juri, and Kimberly, joining the previous demo&#x27;s roster of Ryu, Luke, Chun-Li, and Jamie for a flashy roster count of seven World Warriors. This will give TGS attendees a world-first opportunity to check out the three new characters, something which isn&#x27;t leaving yer boy seething with envy in any manner whatsoever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;bGuVJXwENQk
In addition to the new Street Fighter 6 demo, Capcom will also be holding two live streams across the duration of the show. The first is the Tokyo Game Show 2022 Capcom Online Program, which will look at all of Capcom&#x27;s other incoming releases, (though the publisher has confirmed Resident Evil 4 will not be in attendance at TGS 2022). The second stream, Tokyo Game Show Street Fighter 6 Special Program, will be focused purely on the new slugger, and is expected to feature at least one new character reveal trailer. Exciting stuff!
Of course, for those not in attendance, LIKE ME, all of the pertinent news for Street Fighter 6 and all other titles being showcased at TGS will be reported right here on Destructoid. While the remainder of 2022 is looking like something of a quiet year for big releases, there&#x27;s no denying that 2023 is shaping up pretty nicely, and TGS will only add fuel to that hype fire.
Tokyo Game Show 2022 will take place at Makuhari Messe between September 15-18.

TGS (Tokyo Game Show) is scheduled to take place from September 15 through September 18 of this year, and Koei Tecmo is bringing Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty. Before the event, we&#x27;re getting a taste of Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty gameplay, which is a nice surprise after the cinematic reveal at the summer Microsoft game showcase. The bosses and environments so far look worthy of the Nioh series, which is a good sign.
In addition to the footage, Koei Tecmo shared a few scarce details, like the existence of the &quot;five phases&quot; battle style mechanic, as well as the use of offensive and defensive maneuvers (which seems to be a huge focus of the system). We also got reconfirmation of a whole bunch of housekeeping stuff. Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty will launch on PC (Steam), PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X in &quot;early 2023.&quot; It&#x27;s also confirmed as a console and PC Game Pass title.
If you&#x27;re attending TGS, there&#x27;s a few bonuses involved for those of you who can check it out physically. If you play the game in any capacity, you&#x27;ll get a &quot;button badge&quot; for Wo Long. If you finish the demo, you&#x27;ll get a t-shirt (while supplies last, Koei Tecmo points out). We&#x27;ll also get footage of a &quot;never before seen stage&quot; at the event from the game&#x27;s producers (Fumihiko Yasuda and Masaaki Yamagiwa). That&#x27;ll all be at the Koei Tecmo Games booth (Hall 3, Makuhari Messe). The stream will also be taking place on Friday, September 16, at 7:20PM JST.

The financial analysts at CNBC have shot down circulating rumors that retail giant Amazon is preparing to announce that it has purchased legendary developer/publisher Electronic Arts (EA).
Stories of the acquisition began circulating within the last hour, which understandably caused an immediate spike in EA stock value. Since then, however, &quot;industry sources&quot; speaking with CNBC&#x27;s David Faber stated that such a deal has not been struck, nor has Amazon even made a bid toward EA in regard to purchasing the studio. Bloomberg Terminal has similarly doubted the claim.
The initial story, posted by USA Today, cited that Amazon had already tabled an offer to the FIFA, Madden, and Mass Effect studio with an eye to acquiring the publisher and its IP catalog. Speaking fairly, USA Today rumors are believable, given ongoing whispers that EA is one of many major gaming studios looking to sell up. When recent, industry-shaking acquisitions involving companies such as Microsoft, Activision Blizzard, and ZeniMax/Bethesda are also taken into account, huge transactions such as the one rumored this morning are far more credible than they once might have been.
This breaking news story continues to unfold this morning. But, even as mere minutes pass, it seems more and more likely that the Amazon/EA purchase rumor is, at this stage, unfounded.

                              <span>You can resume previously regular dueling activities
It looks like Dark Souls 3 PC players will be able to engage with the online side of its content again. Online features for the PC version of Dark Souls 3 went back online today.
The news was made known through the Dark Souls Twitter account today. The Souls team is also working to restore these features for all other Dark Souls titles, as it looks like only the third is back right now. An announcement will be made when those services are back online.
https://twitter.com/DarkSoulsGame/status/1562718968086872064
The PC servers for Dark Souls, Dark Souls 2, and Dark Souls 3 have been offline for quite some time. They were taken down after a severe exploit was uncovered in these games. An RCE exploit in Dark Souls 3 let players run malicious code, creating a pretty serious vulnerability. Players drew attention to it, and the exploit was enough to yank down the servers for all three games on PC. Console servers, meanwhile, have stayed online.
Calling in online assistance
While we&#x27;ve been getting steady updates on the status of these servers, it&#x27;s nice to see at least one of the games back. Online features are a pretty big part of the Souls experience, ranging from PvP to calling in assistance and leaving messages.
Meanwhile, Elden Ring has been top-of-mind for pretty much all of 2022. The same exploit was investigated and taken care of in Elden Ring, so those servers have stayed online through the whole ordeal.
While it might seem like players would still gravitate towards the newcomer in Elden Ring, it&#x27;s good to have these online features back up for Dark Souls 3. Newcomers who bought into Elden Ring may wish to go back and explore earlier titles, and hopefully they&#x27;ll be able to do it as originally intended. No timeline&#x27;s been made public on when the PC online features for Dark Souls or Dark Souls 2 will be back.

Earlier today, news broke that Sony would be bumping up the price of the PlayStation 5 in some regions. And as some have wondered whether Microsoft will follow suit, it looks like that won&#x27;t be the case.
A Microsoft representative told Windows Central that there are no plans to raise the price of the Xbox Series X or Xbox Series S consoles. These will stay at their current price point in their respective currencies; $299 for the Series S, and $499 for the Xbox Series X.
&quot;We are constantly evaluating our business to offer our fans great gaming options,&quot; the spokesperson told Windows Central. &quot;Our Xbox Series S suggested retail price remains at $299 (£250, €300) the Xbox Series X is $499 (£450, €500).&quot;

                              <span>Drinkbox Studios’ Nobody Saves The World is getting a shot in the arm via a new expansion arriving next month. Dubbed Frozen Heath, this update adds new forms, challenges, and a fresh region to explore.
Frozen Hearth takes place in an underground region that hosts The Tempering, a series of trials consisting of combat challenges and puzzles. Overcoming this contest rewards two new forms: the Killer Bee and the Mechanic, which can be used in the main game. 


On September 13 you can buy the Frozen Hearth expansion separately for $4.99 or pick up it alongside the main game in a bundle for $27.99.  
Nobody Saved the World launched in January and became one of our early favorites of 2022. Former editor John Carson scored the game an 8.25 out of 10, writing in his review that, 
“Despite its minor shortcomings, Nobody Saves the World kept me enthralled from start to finish as I leveled my way through form ranks for the next body or ability to work with. It&#x27;s most fun when unleashing devious yet approachable combat scenarios, keeping me on my toes to find the best solution to survive. Thankfully, it gave me plenty of those unrelenting loops throughout, justifying the time to save this funny little world.”</span>

                              <span>Standing here, I realize that this Super Replay will be a cut above the rest because we’ll be slicing and dicing in Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance! Join us today on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central to enjoy two hours of what will be a full playthrough of the cult favorite action game streaming weekly each Friday. 
Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance serves as a sequel/spin-off to Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots that puts cyborg ninja Raiden at the helm. Instead of sneaking around in boxes, players eviscerate foes in fast-paced, stylish action courtesy of developer Platinum Games. Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look. Will I acquire a new appreciation for the game nine years later? How many watermelons will I slice? You’ll have to tune in to find out. 
Watch on Twitch!
Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Andrew Reiner and Blake Hester, as we revisit Raiden’s beloved solo adventure. If you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes. You’ll also be granted entry to the official Game Informer Discord channel, where our welcoming community members, moderators, and staff gather to talk games, entertainment, food, and organize hangouts!</span>

                              <span>Team Ninja’s dark fantasy action title Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty impresses in a new gameplay trailer that captures the fast-paced thrills you&#x27;d expect from the minds behind Nioh and Ninja Gaiden. 
Fans of the studio&#x27;s previous action titles should find plenty to love with Wo Long if this video is any indication. Set during the Three Kingdoms era of China, you&#x27;ll battle invading demons as a soldier using a blend of graceful swordplay and Chinese martial arts based on the Five Phases philosophy. The trailer shows off the many demonic foes awaiting your blade, including a bipedal tiger that is swiftly kicked out of the way by the protagonist. 


Next month, those attending Tokyo Game Show will be the first to play Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty via a show floor demo. Everyone else will have to wait until early 2023 to experience the game on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. It will also be available on Xbox Game Pass at launch.</span>

                              <span>Yesterday, Sony Interactive Entertainment announced it will increase the price of PlayStation 5 consoles in various non-U.S. territories due to global economic conditions such as inflation. Microsoft then declared later that day that it will not be doing the same with the Xbox Series X/S. Now, Nintendo has chimed in on the matter. 
In a statement to Eurogamer, Nintendo reiterates a quote from president Shuntaro Furukawa, made in June, in which he stated the company has &quot;no plans to increase the trade price of its hardware.” Furukawa made this statement during the 82nd Annual General Meeting Shareholders that month, in which he also said: 
&quot;While we cannot comment on pricing strategies, we currently do not have any plans to change the price of our hardware due to inflation or increased procurement costs in each country. We will determine our future pricing strategies through careful and continued deliberations.”
Although the PlayStation 5&#x27;s price will remain unchanged in the U.S. (for now), both versions of the console have become more expensive in Canada, Europe, the UK, Mexico, Japan, and Australia. The price hikes have already gone into effect in those regions except Japan, which occurs on September 15. 
The only time Nintendo significantly adjusted the price of its current consoles was last fall, when it permanently reduced the cost of the standard Switch model in the UK and Europe. Nintendo has yet to do the same in the U.S.

The Pokémon GO Fest reaches its finale tomorrow (August 28th) with a number of one-day events ensuring that the celebrations go out with a bang. Perhaps the biggest of these events will be the arrival of four Ultra Beast Pokémon who will be making their way into five-star raid battles over the course of the day.
In order to spread the news of this upcoming event, the official Pokémon GO Twitter account has released a series of &#x27;found footage&#x27;-style trailers, showing Nihilego, Buzzwole, Pheromosa, and Xurkitree appearing in urban areas across the globe and causing havoc.

                              <span>Time to haggle!
Video gaming has to be one of the more expensive hobbies out there, right? Other than, like, yacht collecting or space travel, of course, but out of the normal hobbies, it&#x27;s up there. Games themselves tend to cost anywhere from $20 to 80, and that&#x27;s before you get into things like physical versions and collector&#x27;s editions and DLC.
But retro games are even more expensive, thanks to a number of factors like rarity, age, condition, and some less-than-reputable sellers. But fear not, dear would-be collectors: Our Zion has your best interests at heart with his latest video for the NL YouTube channel, which will help you learn the tips and tricks to collecting retro games. And you can totally trust him: Have you seen his shelves? The man lives in a museum of video games!

Tomorrow is World Rock Paper Scissors Day — which also means that Splatoon 3&#x27;s first-ever Splatfest begins! Thanks to the Splatfest World Premiere Demo, you can join in on the game&#x27;s first Splatfest a few weeks before we officially get to paint the town blue, yellow, and red. But before you get started in this fierce competition, there&#x27;s an important decision to make — which team are you picking?
Splatoon 3&#x27;s Splatfests will consist of three teams this time — it&#x27;s almost like it&#x27;s a theme! The teams for this one are (appropriately, if you didn&#x27;t already guess) Team Rock, Team Paper, and Team Scissors. And each member of Deep Cut are representing one of the three teams - Shiver for Rock, Frye for Paper, and Big Man for Scissors.

Bandai Namco is apparently making this summer one for PlayStation platforming remakes! Pac-Man World: Re-Pac is out today on Switch, and — following on from Klonoa Phantasy Reverie Series — shows the Japanese developer is acknowledging and showing a little bit of love to some of our childhood favourites.
Early reviews have been dropping all week, and while we&#x27;re working on the NL verdict, we wanted to share what others think of Pac-Man&#x27;s return to 3D platforming. We&#x27;ll let you know what we think as soon as our review is up and ready!

We have been eagerly anticipating news of Netflix&#x27;s BioShock movie ever since the media giant announced its plans back in February, and last night the studio provided some fresh details by revealing both the film&#x27;s writer and director.
In a tweet, the streaming service announced that the upcoming adaptation would be directed by Francis Lawrence — whose past credits include I Am Legend and The Hunger Games: Catching Fire — with an original script written by Oscar-nominated screenwriter, Michael Green — known for his work on Logan and Blade Runner 2049.

Nintendo has shared a new look at Mojang&#x27;s much-anticipated Minecraft Legends across its social channels, this time introducing us to a clan of fiery creatures who we can only assume will be your central opponents in the game. Seriously, have you ever seen a good guy living in a castle of flames?
The trailer carries some serious Lord of the Rings vibes, as an ominous narrator speaks over images of a blocky hero on horseback riding into battle against a hoard of Piglins (yes, the baddies are pigs in helmets).

                              <span>Transparent huge pages (THP) zrychlují práci s pamětí v Linuxu, protože umožňují pro aplikace transparentní použití velkých stránek paměti (2 MB) místo výchozích stránek (4 kB). To pomáhá výkonu TLB. THP je možné nastavit na never, always a madvise. Nastavení always může některé aplikace zpomalit a také plýtvá pamětí, proto je často v distribucích výchozím nastavením madvise. Tady záleží na aplikaci, jestli při alokaci paměti použije madvise a tím dá najevo, že je použití velkých stránek žádoucí.</span>

                              <span>Here&#x27;s your chance to get the latest Tomb Raider title for free
It&#x27;s hard to keep up with all the awesome new releases in games, but sometimes, you just gotta throw it all to the wind and play an old favorite. If you&#x27;re a fan of the Tomb Raider reboot series, and you&#x27;re looking for a gritty adventure game to sink your teeth into, you&#x27;re in luck, because Shadow of the Tomb Raider is the free game on the Epic Games Store for September.
Shadow of the Tomb Raider was originally released back in 2018 as the third game in the reboot trilogy and the twelfth mainline Tomb Raider game. The game&#x27;s events take place a year after the events of its predecessor, Rise of the Tomb Raider, which came out in 2015, and finds Lara Croft racing against the clock to prevent the world from ending yet again. Arguably the darkest game in the series yet, it explores themes of descension, both through Lara&#x27;s personality and the jungle itself.

The story is based on both Mayan and Aztec mythologies, and in creating the game, Square Enix devs consulted with historians to create the architecture and people of the legendary city Paititi. Fun fact: the game is still sitting at number seven on the list of most expensive games ever made, after adjusting for inflation.
Submerged: Hidden Depths is the other free-to-download title paired with Shadow of the Tomb Raider on the Epic Games Store. It&#x27;s a relaxing exploration sim that has players uncovering the ruins of a beautiful, sunken world. If you want a more chill exploration-based gaming experience, it sounds like it&#x27;s thematically fairly close to the Tomb Raider series, so it could be a fun one to try out.
The games are available for free download on the Epic Games Store starting September 1, so make sure to grab the roguelike &quot;card crawler&quot; Ring of Pain before it leaves the rotation next week.

The Nintendo Treehouse went live today with a special stream highlighting two upcoming Switch games. First up was Splatoon 3, which got a big showcase of not just its single-player campaign, but some of its new weapons.
The Treehouse team set about tackling some levels in Splatoon 3 that were largely spoiler-free, outside of general locale information. The first few segments are absolutely some familiar Splatoon multiplayer. Blast some ink, jet along the course, take out the bad guys, and reach the goal.
What caught my eye right away was some of the new Splatoon 3 weapons the team spotlighted. The Splatana, an ink-launching katana, looks really great in motion. It&#x27;s got different fire modes for different situations, and feels like an interesting evolution of …</span>

Join us at 5:00 P.M. Central Time (6:00 P.M. ET/3:00 P.M. PT) to watch the build. We likely won&#x27;t get through the whole thing today, but we&#x27;ll be live for at least a couple of hours. 
And as you might&#x27;ve guessed from the picture above, we have a lot more Gunpla kits to get through. Bandai was nice enough to send us a few, and we&#x27;ll absolutely be live streaming lots of fun hobby-adjacent activities over the next few weeks.
 Again, we&#x27;re going live on our Twitch channel at 5:00 P.M. Central Time (6:00 P.M. ET/3:00 P.M. PT). Hope to see you there!</span>

                              <span>After revealing earlier this year that it was making a BioShock movie, Netflix has announced who will be directing it and who&#x27;s writing the script. And you might recognize them, and if not, you&#x27;ll almost certainly recognize the movies they&#x27;ve worked on. 
Netflix revealed in a tweet made today that Francis Lawrence (I Am Legend, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, Slumberland) will direct this BioShock film adaptation and Michael Green (Loga, Blade Runner 2049, American Gods) will write the script.

And that&#x27;s all Netflix had to reveal about the movie today. Perhaps we&#x27;ll learn of casting soon. In the meantime, read about the original announcement.

                              <span>Atomic Heart reemerged during Gamescom with a new trailer devoted solely to showing off its impressive, Bioshock-esque combat. Over three minutes of gameplay footage shows off the carnage you&#x27;ll unleash against adversaries, both artificial and organic. 
Players wield melee weapons or firearms in one hand and more, shall we say, unconventional abilities in the other. That includes electrifying targets with lightning bolts, tossing them around with a telekinesis-like power, freezing foes solid with an ice blast, or using wires to hijack machines. The action-packed video shows off how players can creatively combine their arsenal to dismantle and disembowel anything standing in their way. 


Atomic Heart was first announced in 2018 and takes place in an alternative futuristic version of the Soviet Union in 1955. Robotic technology flourished post World War 2, allowing humanity to create a high-tech utopia. Unfortunately, these mechanical helpers have started rebelling against their human creators. If that wasn’t enough, killer mutants born from secret experiments have also run amok. Players control private agent P-3, who embarks on a secret mission to get to the bottom of what’s caused this seemingly perfect society to collapse and clean up this mess. 
Atomic Heart launches this fall for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. It’s also launching on Xbox Game Pass.</span>

A video game sequel is hard to create, especially if the previous game was a commercial success. Why did the game resonate with fans? How many new features does the sequel need to justify another price tag? Should anything be changed at all? How do you make something fresh while retaining the identity established in the first release?
These are the questions developers constantly ask themselves while making a game. The road to publishing a project is full of pitfalls, and it’s easy to lose the path.

                              <span>Knockout City Season 7 is called Mutant Mutiny. Mutants named Neon, Susan, Ratfink, and Goober have come to the surface to fight for their place in Knockout City, but they aren&#x27;t the only mutants coming to town. The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles join them in the dodgeball battlefields of Knockout City this season.
When the 13-week season featuring Mutant Mutiny launches on August 30, Leonardo, Donatello, Michelangelo, and Raphael join the game as playable characters for any dodgebrawl match – each turtle features a unique intro pose. If players want more TMNT action in Knockout City, they can purchase the Premium Brawl Pass featuring TMNT rewards, a new map, new hideout customizations and more.

                              <span>Each year, every NHL team strives to put the best squad it can on the ice. Sometimes, that means a full offseason overhaul. In other years, that means fine-tuning some lesser areas of an already solid team. NHL 22 was a good-looking game, but the gameplay felt long in the tooth and in need of changes. While NHL 23 doesn’t rebuild the gameplay from the ground up, it does offer several features, tweaks, and enhancements in hopes of being better than the last iteration.
NHL 23 represents the series’ second entry using EA’s Frostbite engine. As such, various refinements come online as the development team further familiarizes itself with the proprietary engine. EA Vancouver is also implementing several gameplay tweaks, including last-chance puck movement. This adds hundreds of new stumble anim…</span>

                              <span>In February, we reported the server shutdown of Dark Souls 3 after a dangerous hack – Remote Code Execution – rendered affected PCs inoperable. Attackers &quot;executed arbitrary code on a remote device, meaning they could take control of a player&#x27;s PC.&quot; But thankfully, seven months later, the servers are back online. 
The official Dark Souls Twitter account initially confirmed servers would remain offline beyond the release of Elden Ring. However, the extensive deactivation period that ensued couldn&#x27;t have been anticipated. The RCE hack affected all three Dark Souls games. And now that the third entry&#x27;s multiplayer modes are available again, hopefully, the other games in the franchise will see the light of day, too. 
PC版『DARK SOULS III』におけるセキュリティの脆弱性調査と対応が完了したため、本日よりゲームサーバーを復旧し、オンラインサービスを再開しました。ユーザーの皆様にはお詫び申し上げますとともに、復旧をお待ちいただいたことへの御礼を申し上げます。 https://t.co/mPmnBK9Wbd

A translated From Software Support tweet (see above) reads as follows:

&quot;We have completed the security vulnerability investigation and countermeasures for the PC version of &quot;DARK SOULS III,&quot; so we have restored the game server and resumed online services from today. We apologize to all users and thank you for waiting for the restoration.

In addition, we are also working on the PC version of &quot;DARK SOULS Ⅱ&quot; and the PC version of &quot;DARK SOULS REMASTERED,&quot; and we will inform you as soon as they are restored. We apologize for the inconvenience and inconvenience for all users, but we appreciate your understanding and cooperation.&quot;</span>

Following news from Sony Interactive Entertainment earlier today that it has raised the price of the PlayStation 5 in multiple non-U.S. markets, Microsoft has revealed that it will not follow suit. 
A Microsoft spokesperson told Windows Central that the company has no plans to raise the price of the Xbox Series X/S consoles. 
&quot;We are constantly evaluating our business to offer our fans great gaming options,&quot; the spokesperson told the publication. &quot;Our Xbox Series S suggested retail price remains at $299 (£250, €300) [and] the Xbox Series X [remains] $499 (£450, €500).”

                              <span>The LG C2 OLED probably isn&#x27;t your first thought when you&#x27;re considering a new desktop monitor, but its incredible image quality and new smaller 42-inch or 48-inc sizes make it a surprisingly valid choice. Right now you can pick up this monitor in either size for under £1000, depending on where you shop, a price that puts it make more affordable than smaller monitors with worse HDR performance - and that makes it well worth considering.

At the time, there was no info other than a logo, but as of yesterday there&#x27;s a full reveal trailer. We now know that Rift Of The NecroDancer is a standalone rhythm game, akin to Guitar Hero with combat.

Perhaps that&#x27;s how Tower Of Fantasy, which released two weeks ago, is already teasing its first piece of additional content. Find a trailer for it below.

                              <span>Not that all the other wars were just a bit of goofing around, but World War One – a conflict remembered more for its bleak, arduous trench warfare than any great triumph over evil – seems like a particularly unusual source of inspiration for a strategy game that will, presumably, be played for fun. Nonetheless, The Great War: Western Front, a combination of macro planning and tactical RTS battling revealed this week at Gamescom, has elected to lean right into WW1’s complexities and difficulties rather than dance around them.

Developers Petroglyph have gone for historical accuracy in various ways, senior designer Chris Becker and audio director Frank Klepacki explain to me at a hands-off demo in Cologne. The soundtrack will even include licensed music from the era. But something they want to really hammer home is the brutality of the war: territory won’t be won in heroic pushes but slowly and bloodily, while collapsing morale is as much a danger as any advancing army.

                              <span>Nostalgic yet unknown is perhaps a good way to describe OU upon first glance. It’s a game clearly designed to mimic the picture book imagination of childhood with its hand-drawn visuals and the innocent silent presence of its protagonist, a young boy named OU and his opossum friend. Even its music is reminiscent of some lost, unknown childhood as we’re lulled into the strange world of U-Chronia with the smooth instrumentation of a single guitar and its occasional percussion. Yet it’s clear with the presence of beasts that threaten your safety and a shadowy clone that this isn’t some peaceful retreat into childhood.

You can now fly over Hanover, Dortmund, Dusseldorf, Bonn and Cologne. They’re rendered with the fancy photogrammetry technique that’s already plonked hundred of cities into Flight Simulator’s rendition of Earth. 


That means that you can zoom over Koelnmesse, which is where Gamescom’s happening right bloomin’ now. Nice bit of Inception-style weirdness there, Microsoft Flight Simulator devs. I’ll give it a go later and see if I can spot our roving reporter Ed. Witness the realism for yourself by watching the trailer below, like some kind of human aircraft gliding above.

David Braben said that Frontier Developments incorporate audio from projects such as the British Antactic Survey’s Halley Research Station, which is where the data was collected that revealed that classic environmental disaster, the hole in the ozone layer. Braben’s revelation was prompted by the recent public acknowledgement from NASA that, yes, people really can hear screams in space. Sort of.

                              <span>This week on The Electronic Wireless Show podcast we give thanks to listener Tom Fakelastname, who emailed in to ask us about the moral quandaries in video games that we feel are the most meaningful. Matthew isn&#x27;t here this week, which means we are very well behaved. I talk about BioWare games a normal amount, and Nate tries (and, in fairness, succeeds) to find a way to make moral choices a thing that you can apply to the sort of games he likes. Not Age Of Empires II this time, though. 
Because there&#x27;s no Matthew, I change the Cavern Of Lies into a cavern of moral judgement for Nate, and make him run a gauntlet of some of the most important choices in Dragon Age Inquisition with no context. He turns out to be both authoritarian and kind of wholesome as an Inquisitor.

                              <span>Revealed at Gamescom Opening Night Live, Atlas Fallen is an upcoming action RPG being developed by Deck 13 Interactive, the folks behind The Surge games. It&#x27;s eschewing the robotic antics of its predecessor in favour of a Middle Eastern-inspired semi-open world filled with towering blocks of sand, rolling dunes, and mahoosive beasties.
I managed to see a brief 30-minute presentation of the game here at Gamescom, which gave off the impression that it&#x27;s shaping up to satisfy those craving a AA title to plonk on their shelf. I&#x27;ve got to say that in action that combat really looks good, too.

                              <span>Valve have revealed that daily reservations of the Steam Deck are higher than at any time since the handheld launched in February this year. The official Steam Deck Twitter account shared the coy stats in a tweet but, as ever, neglected to go into detail about just how many are being snapped up. Good job they’re pumping out more Decks than even Valve expected, at least.

                              <span>&quot;The thing we&#x27;re doing with The Dark Pictures is exploring different sub genres of horror,&quot; explains game director Tom Heaton. The Dark Pictures Anthology is, well, a horror anthology, each a compact standalone scary game where you explore and deal with QTEs and hazardous choices, in the vein of Supermassive&#x27;s smash hit Until Dawn. The idea, says Heaton, is that each one takes one or two horror sub-genres and mines them, maybe subverting the tropes here and there. Up next is The Devil In Me, inspired by the infamous Chicago serial killer H. H. Holmes. 
&quot;What I think we decided with The Dark Pictures games early on was that the next game in the series would be very different from the last game, because we want to keep it fresh, we want to give the audience new,&quot; Heaton explains. So, after a zombie ghost ship in Man Of Medan, the psychological witch hauntings in Little Hope, and military squad vs. vampire aliens in House Of Ashes, Heaton pitches The Devil In Me as kind of Saw meets The Shining. It&#x27;s a serial killer slasher in a weirdo hotel, and it has a true crime element. And I have to say, it&#x27;s probably the most excited I&#x27;ve been for a Dark Pictures entry.

Dead Pets Unleashed looks exactly like my cup of tea, or rather, a fizzling concoction of Red Bull, battery acid, and popping candy. After launching a Kickstarter campaign, developers Triple Topping have released a Dead Pets Unleashed demo, so players can get a taste of the highs and lows of band life and, after playing the demo myself, it’s definitely worth checking out. You&#x27;ll wanna turn your speakers up for this one.

Now, after the internet noticed the studio is currently hiring for three positions to form a “blockchain team”, developer Build A Rocket Boy have responded to the claims on Reddit. And the answer is... complicated.

I&#x27;ve felt proud a number of times at this year&#x27;s Gamescom so far, marked first by an excellent McDonald&#x27;s choice (honey crisp chicken and bacon) on the first evening, followed by a doner kebab that put it to shame. And in a non-savoury twist, today it was being a member of the first squad to complete the Warhammer 40K: Darktide demo mission – the sweetest feeling of them all, and a perfect team-bonding exercise.
The bonus emotions? Surprise and... not being so surprised. Surprise that we&#x27;d accomplished such a feat, but not so much surprise in the game itself. It was, as expected, a good co-op FPS time! But a very familiar one.

Last night also saw the reveal of the Samsung 990 Pro SSD, a premium designed-for-gaming drive with read speeds up to 7450MB/s – nudging the theoretical limits of its PCIe 4.0 interface. If it actually reaches such speeds in the wild, once it launches in October, that would make it the fastest consumer PCIe 4.0 drive yet. And write speeds aren’t far behind either, at up to 6900MB/s.

As you click around, you&#x27;ll discover new words to add to your inventory, which you can then use to fill in your explanation of the crime. How did who get into whose room, which person was killed, and how did the murder take place? 

These are the sorts of questions you&#x27;ll be answering across 12 different murders - and there&#x27;s a demo available now, if you want to start to work the case right away.

Original story:
Off The Grid was announced earlier this year, the first product of District 9 director Neill Blomkamp&#x27;s partnership with Gunzilla Games.

Watch it below.

                              <span>Here is all I am asking for from any post-society future: let the paint and fabric dyes survive. Floodland, the newly announced survival settlement builder about building back better after climate collapse, is much more interesting to me because the roofs are bright blue, the walls are daubed in orange, the tents are luscious shades of mauve and heliotrope. Watch it below to see what I mean.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a sucker for a pretty mechanical keyboard, but usually the keebs I&#x27;m most enamoured with have price tags to match - think £100 to £200 minimum, and think the upper end of that scale if you want a keyboard that looks like a giant ice cube or weighs a solid 2.3kg. Happily though, there are also now a range of much more affordable keyboards that still include the unusual colour schemes, high-quality components and brilliant typing experiences that make mechanical keyboards so fascinating to me. One of the best makers in this space is Akko, and today a range of their best full-size and compact keyboards are on sale at Amazon UK.

Coming in 2023 from publishers Frontier Foundry and the developers behind the Command &amp; Conquer Remastered Collection, let&#x27;s have a watch of its reveal trailer below.

That’d be publisher Frontier Foundry, who shared another look at the recently delayed sci-fi space adventure Deliver Us Mars this evening as part of Gamescom&#x27;s Future Games Show. I thought there’d be more imposing planetary locales to navigate in this sequel to Deliver Us The Moon, and there are, but I wasn’t prepared for a whole bunch of astronauts running about being dramatic. Clue yourself in on what’s happening on Mars by watching the trailer below.

Now, Barr has taken another pass at his 2016 game v r 2, which was an exhibition of stuff you could find in the Unity engine’s GameObject menu. Except everything was inside cubes. In v r ^2, or v r squared, everything is out in the open on display. Take a gander at the trailer below.

                              <span>Park Beyond, an upcoming theme park management sim in the vein of a juiced up Rollercoaster Tycoon, is trying to balance two slightly opposed teams in its target audience. There are people who love doing the management bits - the bean-counting, optimising the amount of salt on fries to make people thirsty and buy more drinks, paying close attention to demographics and average spends and that sort of kidney*. Then there are people who want to design a park full of cool-ass rides and different themed zones, a true magical wonderland. Inside this Park Beyond are two wolves, in other words, and each needs a different but equally robust set of tools to wrangle.
After some hands on with an early build of Park Beyond, I have a little more faith that Limbic Entertainment are going to be able to pull it off. The toolset for building a rollercoast is, in particular, impressive. It&#x27;s never been so easy to make a ride that breaks both the laws of physics and the laws of health and saftey. The coasters in this game are an absolute menace. In a good way.

                              <span>Samsung have made a lot of great gaming monitors over the years, and they&#x27;ve also been making steady inroads into the realm of cloud gaming through their ongoing partnership with Microsoft. Until now, most of their cloud ambitions have been neatly contained in the console space, but today Samsung have unveiled their latest cloud-enabled PC monitors, presumably in the hope that the combination of Xbox Cloud Gaming, Nvidia&#x27;s GeForce Now, Stadia, Utomik and Amazon Luna services inside their integrated Samsung Gaming Hubs will be enough to convince folks to part with their towers once and for all.

                              <span>Being shrunk down to the size of a thimble would be my absolute worst nightmare. Think of all the dirt and clumps of dust you’d be grossed out by, and don&#x27;t even get me started about being outside. Giant horrific insects? No thanks. I’m already emotionally scarred from the giant bug puppets in Honey, I Shrunk The Kids, and it’s the reason I won’t ever play Grounded (soz Obsidian).
Thankfully, Tinykin takes a more whimsical approach to this hellish situation. It’s a sci-fi adventure platformer where you and a tiny alien army explore a giant house and, as a bite-size summary, it’s excellent. Splashteam have made a fun, laid-back Pikmin-like bursting with humorous surprises and I played the game with a silly grin on my face the entire time.

                              <span>If you’d told me back in early June that legendary RPG devs Obsidian Entertainment would be releasing an adventure game set around a medieval German abbey, I would’ve scoffed and called you a charlatan. Speed forwards through time to today, when Obsidian revealed that Pentiment is out on November 15th, and I’m genuinely pleased to hear it. Refresh your memory of Pentiment by watching the game’s trailer below.

Happily, though, developers Bulwark Studios have announced Ixion&#x27;s release date this morning, so let me tell you about it now.

Necessary as it might have been for Bungie, this &#x27;sunsetting&#x27; removing content people bought has raised hackles. Now Bungie say they&#x27;ve been working on the game&#x27;s technoguts, and won&#x27;t do that anymore. Expansions will stick around forever, though seasonal content will still leave at the end of each expansion cycle—and Bungie don&#x27;t say anything about bringing back all the old stuff.

                              <span>The developers of indie slice-of-life adventure A Space For The Unbound allege that the game’s console publisher in western regions, PQube, withheld information about a diversity grant and used that to leverage for a greater share of the game’s revenue. Mojiken Studio say they were left feeling “manipulated and exploited” by the UK-based publisher’s actions. The Indonesian team have now terminated their contract with PQube and delayed A Space For The Unbound until they can find another publisher.

                              <span>The only Zelda game I&#x27;ve played was Link&#x27;s Awakening, on the Game Boy. I do not feel short changed by this. In fact I get the distinct impression it was one of the best, if not the one that most distilled the series&#x27; essence.
That essence has made its way into Blossom Tales II, a charming light adventure game in the classic &quot;going on an adventure&quot; sense rather than the &quot;rubbing every item on every other item until you&#x27;re allowed to play again&quot; genre sense.
You&#x27;re playing out a story playfully told by your grandfather, who&#x27;s cast you as the wee hero of a village out to rescue your brother from the sinister Minotaur King. Both of you occasionally interject, sometimes prompting a decision that changes the game a little as your granddad amends things to your liking. It doesn&#x27;t go to the full meta-narrative lengths of a Juarez Gunslinger with it, but it&#x27;s a cute touch and keeps the framing relevant.

                              <span>The Dark Pictures Anthology returns this November with The Devil In Me, which serves as the season finale for the franchise (until the next batch of games arrive). A new trailer showcases the host of new features designed to ensure the season ends with a bang.
The Devil In Me stars actor Jessie Buckley and follows a group of filmmakers fighting for survival in a dangerous house, a replica of H.H. Holmes’ infamous “Murder Castle.” The new trailer runs down additions such as being able to use important tools from a character inventory and extended exploration mechanics; players can freely run, jump, and climb now. Supermassive also reveals the story is over seven hours long. An online shared story lets you enjoy the experience with friends from afar, though you can explore the adventure with friends in the room in local multiplayer. 


The Dark Pictures Anthology: The Devil In Me arrives November 18 for PlayStation and Xbox consoles and PC. You can get a better sense of the game&#x27;s narrative by watching this recent story trailer.</span>

                              <span>If you enjoy over-the-top, stylish action games with plenty of silliness, Wanted: Dead should be on your radar. First announced last fall, the game comes from Soliel Ltd, developer of the upcoming Valkyrie Elysium, and consists of Ninja Gaiden and Dead or Alive alumni. With those credentials, it&#x27;s little surprise that Wanted: Dead looks absolutely bonkers. 
The story centers on Hong Kong cop Lt. Hannah Stone, a member of the Zombie Unit. She and her squad must get to the bottom of a corporate conspiracy, but the game doesn’t appear to be nearly as serious as its premise lets on. Gameplay blends stylish swordplay with explosive gunplay as players slice and/or shoot through gang members, mercenaries, and other foes in an adventure that looks ridiculous. The release date trailer also shows off anime cutscenes, rhythm music gameplay, cute cats, and whatever else it manages to cram in. 


Wanted: Dead is launching on February 14 and is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.</span>

I love Minecraft and have been playing it on and off since it landed on Xbox Live Arcade in 2012, but I couldn’t care less about the series’ spin-off games like Dungeons or the Telltale-developed Story Mode. While those games were fine, they defeated the point of why I love Minecraft – building, and crafting. 
Developer Mojang Studios is shaking things up with its next spin-off, and after my behind-closed-doors demo at Gamescom, I’m interested. 


Minecraft Legends is a third-person real-time action strategy game. Yeah, that’s a lot of keywords, but I promise the game is easier to understand than you think…</span>

                              <span>Microsoft’s chief executive officer of gaming and Xbox head Phil Spencer believes games exclusive to a single console will become something we see less of over time. 
This news comes from a new interview with Spencer from Bloomberg discussing Microsoft’s in-the-process acquisition of Activision Blizzard, the landscape of console exclusivity, and more. He believes that this is a good thing for the gaming industry in the long run. 
“[It] is something we’re just going to see less and less of,” when discussing the idea of specific games being exclusive to a single device. “Maybe you happen in your household to buy an Xbox, and I buy a PlayStation, and our kids want to play together, and they can’t because we bought the wrong piece of plastic to plug into our television.
“We really love being able to bring more players in reducing friction, making people feel safe, secure when they’re playing, allowing them to play with their friends, regardless of what device – I think in the long run that is good for this industry. And maybe in the short run, there’s some people in some companies that don’t love it. But I think as we get over the hump and see where this industry can continue to grow, it proves out to be true.”
Bloomberg also asked Spencer about the status of Microsoft’s Activision Blizzard acquisition, how the company will handle unions and ongoing unionization efforts happening within Activision Blizzard, and more, so be sure to check out the publication’s full story here.

                              <span>Pentiment, Obsidian Entertainment&#x27;s medieval narrative adventure title, is coming on November 15. We first learned of the project during the Xbox Games Showcase in June. 
The game&#x27;s art direction emulates medieval manuscript illustrations and woodcut prints while the story unfolds in 16th-century Bavaria. You play as an illustrator who becomes wrapped up in a series of murders over 25 years. You&#x27;ll engage in choice-driven conversations where your decisions steer the plot and create lasting consequences in a tale that expands into a larger conspiracy. Check out the original reveal trailer below to see it in action. 


Pentiment is made by a small team within Obsidian led by director Josh Sawyer. You can pick it up on Xbox consoles and PC (day one on Game Pass). It will be the second game that Obsidian ships this year, following the 1.0 release of Grounded in September.</span>

Modern homages to classic video games often go one of two ways: They either stick close to the gameplay conventions to which they are paying tribute, or they expand the original games’ styles in meaningful and innovative ways. Blossom Tales II: The Minotaur Prince, like its 2017 predecessor, is more the former than the latter, adhering closely to the classic Legend of Zelda blueprint, most notably that of A Link to the Past. Despite this lack of innovation, Blossom Tales II still manages to capture many of the acclaimed elements of what many consider to be one of the greatest video …</span>

When the Splatoon 3-focused Nintendo Direct hit two weeks ago, I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of the information and how much content the Splatoon team was bringing at launch. As someone who very much enjoyed the first two Splatoon games (as well as Splatoon 2&#x27;s Octo Expansion), that Nintendo Direct was all I needed to bring my excitement levels up a few notches. However, having the opportunity to get my hands on the soon-to-be-released Splatoon 3 only skyrocketed this game up the list of my most anticipated 2022 releases.
During my 75-minute hands-on session, I was able to check out the…</span>

This news comes from a new Morty-focused trailer for MultiVersus that showcases the fighter in action. It features a look at how he plays as a Bruiser class brawler, complete with a muscle-enhanced left arm &quot;Armothy&quot; and the &quot;Plumbus&quot; all-purpose alien device.
Check these moves out and more in the trailer below:


&quot;Morty, the teenage grandson of a mega-genius scientist Rick Sanchez, arrives as part of MultiVersus Season 1 and is a Bruiser class character with more than a few tricks up his sleeve,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;Morty&#x27;s moveset, which is on display in a newly released gameplay trailer, features a mix of skills and attacks, from his muscle-enhanced left arm &#x27;Armothy&#x27; and &#x27;Plumbus&#x27; all-purpose alien device, to his ability to whip himself at opponents and use of various projectiles.&quot;
The trailer also reveals the President Morty character variant, which is available as an in-game purchase right now.

                              <span>Every Honkai: Star Rail trailer I watch focuses entirely on its many characters and their interpersonal drama, and the latest is no different. Dark pasts? Dark dreams? Dark academia bedrooms? It has all three. As per usual, I am just here for the fun of an old-fashioned train that can fly through space.

                              <span>It&#x27;s not often that we get to report a game coming out earlier than planned rather than delaying the date, so it&#x27;s nice to be able to tell you that Gotham Knights has moved its release date up. It&#x27;s only by four days, though, to October 21st, which is sort of baffling. Maybe Warner Bros. are about to announce a new DC-verse TV show coming out on the Knights&#x27; original release date of the 25th? Who knows. But along with this early-release sneak attack is a new trailer, giving us a closer look at the rogues gallery that the extended Bat-family are up against.

                              <span>Grim Souls-like Lies Of P will be hitting PC sometime in 2023 according to a new gameplay trailer shown at Opening Night Live during this year&#x27;s Gamescom. The RPG combines the story of Pinocchio with some major Bloodborne energy, as the puppet searches for a way to become a real human boy in a decimated city. This is far from the classic fairytale story though. With a dark-gothic backdrop and mechanical killer robots to contend with, Pinocchio has his work cut out for him. You can watch the new bombastic gameplay trailer below:

                              <span>Portable monitors are pretty awesome - they&#x27;re an easy way to get a dual screen setup going on a laptop, and also work well to expand the Steam Deck&#x27;s rather modest screen into something a little more co-op friendly. Of course, they also work for desktop computers too - and are much more portable and space-saving than an average actual desktop monitor. 
You can even get OLED models now - and a coupon code on Amazon US brings one model down from Innocn from $350 to $200 when you tick the &#x27;coupon&#x27; box on the product page. That&#x27;s quite a bargain for a 15.6-in portable screen of this calibre.

The new studio, Something Wicked Games really only have concept art to show right now, but I do believe both wizards and swords are involved.

I&#x27;ve never been one for bullet hell shooters, and especially not super difficult ones that also double up as roguelikes. Turns out, it absolutely was my jam, and I think Scars Above, the new third-person sci-fi action shooter from Mad Head Games that was revealed tonight at Gamescom Opening Night Live, will be, too. Let&#x27;s have a watch of the reveal trailer, shall we?

                              <span>When co-op shooter Arc Raiders was delayed a couple of weeks ago, Embark Studios said that it was because development on their other project, an unannounced shooter, had progressed faster than expected. Well, tonight they announced that other shooter. It&#x27;s called The Finals, it&#x27;s a team-based shooter framed as a game show, and there&#x27;s an extremely brief teaser trailer below.

                              <span>The Samsung Odyssey G5 is a solid 1440p 165Hz monitor, and it has the benefit of being significantly cheaper than other options. It&#x27;s normally around £299, but now it&#x27;s been reduced to £209 - and that seemed like as reasonable a reason as any to write up a little blog about it.

                              <span>One of the most traditonally epic trailers from the Gamescom-themed Opening Night Live tonight was for Atlas Fallen. It&#x27;s a new fantasy action RPG, with super powers, set in a semi-open world. In what is becoming something of a theme for me tonight, however, the trailer doesn&#x27;t really give much away about the game aside from the topline selling points. There is a tiny, teeny smattering of gameplay at the end, though. Big swords, big monsters, big magic, big sand. In another continuing theme from games revealed tonight, Atlas Fallen is out next year.

But it&#x27;s also a stylish 2D hack-and-slasher, and the perspective shift - and the odd, theatrical world that it reveals - is the most interesting thing about the 30 second announcement trailer. Watch it below.

At today’s Gamescom Opening Night Live though, the episodic experts showed off some new gameplay footage from the upcoming The Expanse: A Telltale Game, along with a behind-the-scenes chat. Witness a revivified Telltale in action in the trailer below.

                              <span>Will clowns ever not be creepy? I&#x27;ve not seen 1988 film Killer Klowns From Outer Space, but from the look of the game adaptation&#x27;s trailer, I don&#x27;t think I ever want to. Announced during Opening Night Live at this year&#x27;s Gamescom, the cult classic horror flick is getting a multiplayer horror game release.
If you&#x27;re not familiar with the film, the title kinda says it all. A group of aliens disguised as clowns invade earth and start killing people - simple! I&#x27;m told the trailer harkens back to some iconic moments from the film, so take a look below:

Tonight, at the Opening Night Live marking the start of Gamescom, we saw a shiny new trailer showing off some of the building tools and wacky modules you can build into your coasters.

Brainwash Gang, the makers of narrative language game Grotto, unveiled their next project this evening at Geoff Keighley&#x27;s Opening Night Live showcase, and it&#x27;s a funky, vibrant, online deckbuilding FPS called Friends Vs Friends. Think Neon White, but instead of competing with your friends on leaderboards, you&#x27;re blasting their little cell-shaded noggins in real time in either 1v1 or 2v2 battles. Here&#x27;s the reveal trailer.

                              <span>Stranded: Alien Dawn is a new sci-fi survival sim coming from the developers of Surviving Mars, Haemimont Games, announced at today’s Gamescom Opening Night Live event. It’s set on a planet that’s a teensy bit greener than the red one near us, and heads into early access on Steam in October.

I&#x27;ve not yet seen anything I didn&#x27;t like of Return To Monkey Island. It&#x27;s a new instalment in the classic point &#x27;n&#x27; click &#x27;n&#x27; pirate series being made under the loving care of Ron Gilbert and Dave Grossman, two of the original devs, and now we know there&#x27;s only a few more weeks to wait. Return To Monkey Island is coming soon to a computer near you on September 19th. There&#x27;s a new trailer to prove it.

                              <span>Nebulae are nice and black holes are dramatic, but I firmly believe that space battles are at their very coolest when whizzing around supersized ships and megastructures. I am therefore delighted by the new Homeworld 3 trailer showing a battle around sprawling technoruins in the long-awaited spaceship strategy sequel. And yes, absolutely it still has those cool Tron engine trails.

Announced during Opening Night Live at Gamescom, The Lords Of The Fallen is an action Soulslike that looks to be in the same vein as the original - lots of knights, swords, and undead - but, interestingly, the reboot has a completely different story set thousands of years after the events of the original.
The cinematic trailer doesn’t showcase any gameplay, but it does spotlight what lies in store for fans. Feast your eyes on the lavish trailer below:

Sega have shown off some hints at the game&#x27;s story during today&#x27;s Gamescom Opening Night Live event. Gawp at the release date trailer below.

Beyond that, I&#x27;m not sure I can say anything. Developers Build A Rocket Boy describe it as &quot;an original multi-world experience&quot; that &quot;will blend gameplay, adventure, creativity, and discovery in a space that blurs the line between reality and the digital world&quot;.
So it will probably be either like Roblox or like Second Life, then? Hopefully we&#x27;ll get a greater sense of which by the time it&#x27;s out, which will be in 2023. The teaser trailer is a montage of stuff happening quickly in the shape of the logo.

                              <span>After being teased earlier this year, we got our first proper glimpse at Gearbox&#x27;s New Tales From The Borderlands game this evening, courtesy of Geoffcom&#x27;s Opening Night Live showcase. Heck, we even got a release date, and it&#x27;s real soon - October 21st, folks, so mark your calendars. Let&#x27;s watch that brand-new gameplay trailer, shall we?

                              <span>Imagine I have a weird alien squid pointed right at you. I need you to tell me what the developers of open-world watery survival game Subnautica are making next. Just, your best guess, or the squid&#x27;ll getcha with its weird alien ink. Ready? Go!.... Okay, well congratulations to anyone who said &quot;a turn-based strategy game inspired by tabletop miniatures&quot;. Unlikely as it may seem you were right, and everyone else was wrong. It&#x27;s called Moonbreaker and it&#x27;s hitting early access on September 29. And Brandon Sanderson is at this party, too.
I admit it was a trick question, but look, I&#x27;m a genuinely big fan of devs doing a completely different project after a successful game. I also know a whole lotta people who love painting plastic fighters in cool colours, carefuly placing them on a tabletop, and slowly pushing them into other plastic fighters in different colours. I&#x27;m absolutely sure that Unknown Worlds will make a very good version of a digital tabletop strategy game. I must admit, though, that whenever a video game like this emerges, I sort of wonder why tabletop-thusiasts would buy it instead of more actual miniatures.

First released in 2017, it&#x27;s a first-person explore-o-story about a teenager returning to her fantastical childhood home to explore lushly detailed rooms and secret passages in the hope of understanding a supposed family curse which causes tragic deaths. And what deaths! You witness many of the Finch family deaths firsthand by playing stunning dreamy vignettes, scenes which are often as wondrous as they are harrowing. Do have a go and enjoy being punched square in the heart by grief.

                              <span>Razer has just launched an upgraded, fully wireless version of the Basilisk V3 – one of the best gaming mice on the market. The Basilisk V3 Pro can connect over Bluetooth or Razer’s HyperSpeed 2.4Hz wireless standard, and with a few optional extras, will also work with wireless charging and a (theoretically) more responsive 4000Hz polling setting. That&#x27;s a pretty tricked-out peripheral, yeah?

                              <span>I feel a bit deceived by Saints Row at the moment. Although I spent the latter half of last week playing and performance testing it, the worst I saw in terms of bugs, glitches and unintentional chicanery was one temporarily floating pedestrian and a few de-synced execution animations. Only after I committed this clean(ish) bill of health to writing did the game’s wider playerbase discover that it is, in fact, riddled with issues: some benign and hilarious, others irritating and game-breaking. Well fine then, game.
Some of these bug reports have come from inside the house, namely Liam and Rebecca, whose respective characters have a) involuntarily shot out their own windscreen immediately upon entering every single car and b) fallen through the world when attempting to mount a motorcycle. Then there’s former vid bud Colm (RPS in peace), who has found his feet pinned to a car roof before fading away like Marty McFly if his parents split up.

It’s journeying onto consoles at the same time, too, but its 1.0 release isn&#x27;t going to be the end of the road for Bannerlord. Devs TaleWorlds Entertainment say they’ll continue to update it in “the coming months” after launch, although in what capacity they haven&#x27;t said yet. In any case, have a watch Bannerlord&#x27;s sweeping launch trailer below.

                              <span>To call the current state of the world today ‘tumultuous’ would be a bit of an understatement. For LGBTQ+ people - and trans people in particular - the increasingly extreme rhetoric and legislation being weaponised against these communities can feel all-consuming. Yet it comes at a time when diverse representation in media, including games, is improving. As the number of characters stated to LGBTQ+ grows, what is more effective representation: making it possible to see your own experiences on screen, or make those experiences understandable to someone who isn&#x27;t LGBTQ+?


People who know of it would perhaps cite the work of developer and translator npckc, who I recently spoke with at the recent Japanese indie gaming event Bitsummit. They were there to showcase their latest game A Pet Shop After Dark, a departure from visual novels like A Year Of Springs trilogy into horror storytelling (&quot;more spooky than outright horror,&quot; as they later clarified) that&#x27;s set to release later this month. Beyond the trilogy and their newest work, they’ve translated the works of other developers and worked on other smaller games and game jam projects.

                              <span>The last year or so of Elite Dangerous has been the most dramatic since the game launched in 2014. The most recent update to Frontier Developments&#x27; epic space sim, Update 13, saw the conclusion of the story&#x27;s Azimuth Saga, culminating in a disastrous attempt to stop the incursion of the Thargoids – Elite&#x27;s hostile race of insectoid aliens. It&#x27;s an event that has already had a major impact on Elite&#x27;s universe, and Frontier are excited to discuss the studio&#x27;s plans for the game and its narrative as it pushes into a new phase for the galaxy, simply known as &quot;Aftermath&quot;.
But the drama surrounding Elite Dangerous isn&#x27;t limited to the game&#x27;s overarching story. As I gear up to chat with lead game designer Luke Betterton and senior producer Samantha Marsh, the Thargoid in the room is Elite Dangerous: Odyssey. Launched in May last year, Elite&#x27;s second expansion was, to put it lightly, not well received by Elite&#x27;s community. Complaints ranged from extensive bugs and performance issues to more fundamental criticisms about the implementation of the expansion&#x27;s on-foot exploration and FPS combat. Over a year on from release, the expansion still carries a &quot;Mostly Negative&quot; rating on Steam, standing in stark contrast to reviews for vanilla Elite Dangerous (now bundled with its Horizons expansion), which remain firmly positive.

Like being upgraded to business class at the airport, if Lufthansa suddenly discovered they had a few more planes than they thought.

                              <span>Earlier this week, the Dead Island 2: Day One Edition leaked on Amazon, showing a Lenny Kravitz-like warrior on the box cover. So, it’s only fitting that Gamescom 2022 ended with two trailers (cinematic and gameplay) for the long-overdue zombie-slaying sequel. 


We follow a chiseled survivor named Jacob as he leaves the safety of his (bloodied) condo and ventures into a Californian hellscape swarming with undead. He kills several adversaries with an empty rifle, jutting it through their rotten bodies and smashing their heads against the pavement with its wooden butt. 
The gameplay trailer shows scenic beaches, forsaken suburbs, cratered city streets, and still-lit carnivals. In what is one of the most graphic clips I’ve ever seen at a game show, we watch as the player-character clobbers zombies with blunt objects, jump-kicks adversaries off roofs (parkour mechanics?), and shoots gasoline tanks to engulf hordes in flames.


Dead Island 2 is a first-person action RPG with six playable characters. And according to a designer who appeared onstage, the gory romp has an irreverent, pulpy tone and gameplay that’s all about “experimenting with your preferred zombie-slaying methods.”
Dead Island 2 punches and kicks its way onto PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on February 3.</span>

                              <span>A product description for The Outlast Trials says players can expect &quot;mind-numbing terror,&quot; and that&#x27;s exactly what we see in the game&#x27;s newest trailer. Plenty of blood is shed as humans are used as lab rats in Murkoff Corporation&#x27;s Saw-like tests. In some cases, the tests just look like torture and flatout murder.
The game looks overly graphic, yet also brings about comparisons to BioShock&#x27;s tone and storytelling conventions. It&#x27;ll be interesting to see how the narrative sews all of these wild experiements together. The Outlast Trials is designed as both a single-player and cooperative experience. The player clearly is free to explore at certain points, and appears to rely on trap-like devices to fight back and escape. In one sequence, we see two players helping each other up to higher ground.
The footage concludes with news of a short closed beta running from October 28 to November 1. No other release date news was shared.</span>

As for what, exactly, the podcast is, it&#x27;s a bit unclear. Kojima announced Keighley would have a regular entertainment news section and that the show will feature &quot;very special guests from various fields.&quot; The first episode will be released on September 8, with subsequent episodes coming out weekly.

“Break a leg as Jolene, a rebellious young woman who makes the grave mistake of breaking the seal upon a cursed theater filled with dangerous dimensions full of pompous props,” a press release reads. “The theater’s seal holding back the darkness weakens until the evil trapped within takes Jolene’s mother hostage. Soon, twisted stories of humanity will begin to escape and wreak havoc upon the world.”

                              <span>Telltale is known for choice-driven storytelling, and yet, the first trailer for The Expanse focuses entirely on action. As XO Camina Drummer keeps tabs on her mutinous crew, she&#x27;ll also be tasked to navigate the ruins of a downed vessel on the outskirts of an asteroid belt.
The trailer showed Drummer space walking, dodging debris, and working her way through the massive vessel. We also see her throw a punch and grapple with someone in zero gravity. To bring this beloved science-fiction universe to life, Telltale enlisted the development talents of Deck Nine (best known for the Life is Strange series). The first pre-alpha footage looks ambitious and dark, delivering a cinematic viewpoint into an investigation riddled with death. The facial animations on the characters also look like an evolution from Telltale&#x27;s previous work, yet some of the same facial features look similar.
The Expanse is slated to release in summer 2023.</span>

                              <span>Killer Klowns From Outer Space, the science fiction comedy horror from the late 80s, made a surprise crash landing during today’s Gamescom showcase. Believe it or not, the cult classic film is getting a game adaptation.


The trailer starts with a comical cinematic sequence – a teenage boy listens to loud music and plays the air guitar in his bedroom while the once-peaceful neighborhood beyond his window gets vaporized. When he notices the explosions and opens the front door, Killer Klowns with blasters reveal themselves from behind a stack of boxed pizza pies. 
Killer Klowns From Outer Space: The Game is “a crazy new take on multiplayer horror” from the executive director of Friday The 13th: The Game. Brief gameplay clips were shown, with Killer Klowns firing lasers at fleeing civilians in a carnival playspace. A band of teens plan a retaliatory attack from a nearby tower, and chaos ensues.
Killer Klowns From Outer Space: The Game launches on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC in early 2023.</span>

                              <span>Something Wicked Games, a new studio made up of developers whose credits include Fallout 4 and The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, has revealed its first game, Wyrdsong, in a new trailer. 
The trailer was released as part of the Gamescom Opening Night Live showcase hosted by Geoff Keighley, and while it was short, it featured plenty of mystery and fantasy intrigue.
Check it out for yourself below: 


As you can see in the trailer above, there&#x27;s not too much to glean from it. However, we did note what was said by the narrator during it: &quot;In the cracks of reality, there exists two lives, one before the shadow and one behind the eye.&quot; Sounds spooky. 
&quot;Wyrdsong is an occult historical fantasy RPG set in a fictionalized Portugal in the middle ages,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;Players will be challenged to question both their reality and the choices they make as Wyrdsong is set to expand, question, and re-define aspects of what makes up the current Role Playing Game genre.&quot; 
Shortly after the trailer&#x27;s release, Jeff Gardiner, an ex-Bethesda Studios dev with credits in Fallout 76, Skyrim, Fallout 4, and more, posted a link on Twitter that leads to the newly-launched Something Wicked Games website. 
&quot;Our goal with Something Wicked Games is to utilize our independent and creative autonomy to create the next evolution of open world RPGs,&quot; Gardiner, who is the founder and CEO of Something Wicked Games, writes in a press release. &quot;Our first project, Wyrdsong, has been my dream game for some time now, and I&#x27;m thrilled to finally share it today.&quot; 
A press release also states the game is being developed in Unreal Engine 5.</span>

                              <span>Squanch Games has released a new trailer for its upcoming first-person shooter High On Life, and this time, we get to watch our protagonist take down a boss. 
This trailer, which aired during today&#x27;s Gamescom Opening Night Live presentation, highlights a fight between our protagonist and their loud-mouthed weapons and 9-Torg, an alien boss. The boss fight features some standard point-and-shoot combat, but it also features some platforming too by way of a grapple hook-like knife tongue thing in your arsenal. Because the weapons have personalities and speak, you&#x27;ll get to hear said knife tongue thing drop more f-bombs than ever heard before in a boss fight, too. 
Check out the High On Life 9-Torg boss fight trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, the boss fight looks like a great time, and it deserves some props for being more than just a who-shoots-who-more type of battle. High On Life hits Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC (via Steam and the Epic Games Store) on Dec. 13.

                              <span>Lies of P, a soulslike inspired by – of all things – the story of Pinnochio, got a new trailer today during Opening Night Live. 
The trailer was surprisingly substantive. On top of plenty of flavor text about the dark and gritty world, we saw several gameplay shots – including, but not limited to, destroying giant steampunk monsters in a victorian theater, massive open levels, and even lighting a marionette-inspired spider on fire. A Pinnochio-inspired soulslike might be a goofy sentence to type, but you know what? The game looks really neat. Check it out below: 


Lies of P doesn&#x27;t yet have a release date. However, it&#x27;ll be released on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC sometime next year. Better still, it&#x27;s coming to Xbox&#x27;s Game Pass on day one.</span>

                              <span>Anakin Skywalker doesn&#x27;t like sand, but developer Deck13 Interactive is hoping you will love it in Atlas Fallen, a new action/RPG experience that is all about the grainy substance. This Focus Entertainment-published title debuted at Gamecom Opening Night Live, and is slated to release in 2023 for PlayStation 5 Xbox Series X/S, and PC.
The game is set within the sands of a timeless land, and the protagonist can unleash sand-powered abilities and infuse sand into shape-shifting weapons. The sand arsenal is used to hunt legendary monsters in either a single-player or cooperative campaign. In the cinematic trailer, we see one hero use sand to repair a bridge, and another hero glide along the sand like she&#x27;s on a hoverboard. Together, the heroes create various weapons with the sand, like a whip, to down a handful of alien dogs. We&#x27;ll have to wait to see how closely the gameplay mimics the cinematics.
Deck13 Interactive is the studio behind Lords of the Fallen and The Surge series of games.</span>

                              <span>Return to Monkey Island is launching this September, per a new trailer during Gamescom Opening Night Live. 
Circle September 17 as the day you can enjoy Ron Gilbert’s latest entry in the beloved adventure franchise, which sees hero Guybrush Threepwood on a quest to finally discover the secret to the famous island once and for all. It may sport a striking new art style but features the adventure game mechanics fans know and love. 
Best of all, those who pre-order the game, which is coming to PC and Switch, will be rewarded with a set of horse armor! Yes, really! It’s absolutely useless and just occupies inventory space, but it’s a nice gag nonetheless. Check out the new trailer below.</span>

It’s an oversimplification, but if the idea captures your imagination, you recognize why the developers at Unknown Worlds think they’ve hit on something special. Best known for Subnautica, the team has been quietly working on a wholly digital miniatures game for the last five years. Built to emulate the collectability, customization, and tactical sophistication of the best tabletop miniature games, Moonbreaker aims to nail the magic and appeal of the real-life hobby, but with some of the approachability inherent to video games. After over an hour checking out the result, I’m convinced Unknown Worlds is onto something.
Set in an original sci-fi/fantasy universe built in partnership with celebrated author Brandon Sanderson, Moonbreaker explores a remote distant s…</span>

                              <span>We got a super in-depth look at Sonic Frontiers earlier this summer when I traveled to Sonic Team and played the game for more than three hours. Sonic Team was open about many parts of its upcoming open-zone adventure, but one part it has remained tight-lipped on is the Sonic Frontiers release date. Today, we not only got a new trailer for Sonic Frontiers but a release date for the game too.
Revealed today during Gamescom Opening Night Live, we now know that Sonic Frontiers launches on November 8. The trailer shown during the livestream gave us a look at a second island in the Starfall Islands: Ares Island. In stark contrast to the first island we saw – Kronos Island – Ares Island appears to be a desolate, sandy biome.


Sega and Sonic Team also revealed the pre-order bonuses and the two editions players can choose from. The standard edition of Sonic Frontiers includes the base game (physical or digital), with a pre-order bonus of the Adventurer&#x27;s Treasure Box, which includes skill points, Red Seeds of Power, and Blue Seeds of Defense. The Digital Deluxe edition includes a digital copy of the game, the Explorer&#x27;s Treasure Box, which includes Amy&#x27;s Memory Tokens, a Portal Gear, Chaos Emerald Vault Keys, and additional shoes and gloves for Sonic, and the Digital Art Book with a 25-track digital mini soundtrack. If you pre-order the Digital Deluxe edition, you also get the Adventurer&#x27;s Treasure Box. The standard edition is listed for $60, while the Digital Deluxe edition is listed for $70.
Sonic Frontiers launches on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on November 8. For more in-depth Sonic Frontiers coverage, head to our exclusive coverage hub here.</span>

                              <span>The Callisto Protocol graced the cover of our magazine a few months ago and is currently one of the most anticipated games of the year. Glen Schofield, creative director of the new space horror adventure and one of the leading designers on the Dead Space franchise, made an appearance at Gamescom 2022. He thanked fans for the positive response and spoke about the gritty new gameplay trailer, “We’re gonna show combat and something new with a crazy ending.” 


Protagonist Jacob Lee pulls a health item with one of his abilities and proceeds to crouch-sneak his way through a group of prowling monsters. He downs one with a stab to the back and fires at another creature, stumbling toward him with tentacles squirming around its exposed belly. To top things off, he brawls with a regenerating creature adorned with cysts and sends it flying into a chainsaw-like structure in the environment. 
In the next scene, Lee slides down a sewage drain while dodging deadly pillars along the dimly-lit channel. And in a shocking ending, reminiscent of the death scenes from Dead Space, the leading man hits a massive propeller obstructing the tunnel and gets ripped in half (I’ll spare you the gory details). Schofield warned the trailer’s ending would be wild, and it did not disappoint.
The Callisto Protocol launches for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on December 2.</span>

                              <span>Developer Gearbox Software and publisher 2K revealed that the spiritual successor to Telltale&#x27;s Tales from the Borderlands is called New Tales from the Borderlands and, it&#x27;s out this October. 
More specifically, it will be out October 21, 2022, on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store. This news comes by way of the official reveal trailer for Tales from the Borderlands, which showcases the game&#x27;s setting, its cast, and more. Perhaps most importantly, it also highlights just how similar this is to Telltale&#x27;s beloved Borderlands narrative-driven adventure game. Sure, there&#x27;s a new cast and story happening, but the game seems to be very much like its beloved predecessor. Your choices and how they affect the overarching story…</span>

                              <span>Developer Avalanche has released a new Hogwarts Legacy trailer detailing unforgivable curses, the dark arts, and the choice to use them or not in the game. 
The trailer was revealed during today&#x27;s Gamescom Opening Night Live showcase hosted by Geoff Keighley and while it didn&#x27;t feature much by way of gameplay, it did give us plenty of new glimpses of magic. In particular, it showed us that we might have access to unforgivable curses such as the Cruciatus Curse in the game. Crucio is essentially a curse that allows you to torture whomever or whatever you use it on – it&#x27;s very much of the Dark Arts side of magic and as the name suggests, hard to forget and even harder to forgive in the world of Harry Potter. 
Check it out for yourself in the trailer below:

                              <span>Dune: Awakening was announced today during Gamescom&#x27;s Opening Night Live event. While details on the game are scant, the trailer revealed it&#x27;s an open-world MMO, and a beta sign-up is available now. 
The trailer tells us little to nothing about the game. It shows a character staring down onto a vast desert while narration waxes poetic about overcoming fear. Then, a giant sandworm comes forth from the ground below, and our character jumps down to face the gigantic beast. Check out the trailer below:


While the trailer didn&#x27;t reveal much, a press release distributed after the fact did. Here&#x27;s what it had to say:

Dune: Awakening isn&#x27;t the only game coming out on the heels of last year&#x27;s mega-blockbuster Dune adaptation. Back in April, Dune: Spice Wars, a real-time strategy game, was released in early access.  
Awakening is expected on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</span>

                              <span>With over three million copies sold, 2014&#x27;s Lords of the Fallen was destined for a sequel. Publisher CI Games has long desired to bring a follow-up to market, but those plans haven&#x27;t gone as planned, and the sequel bounced between several development studios before landing at Hexworks. During today&#x27;s Opening Night Live festivities for Gamescom, we were treated to our first look at Hexworks&#x27; The Lords of the Fallen through a violent three-minute cinematic trailer that highlights the differences between the realms of the living and dead.
Set one thousand years after the original, The Lords of the Fallen is designed with cooperative play in mind, allowing two players to experience uninterrupted online play. A press release describes the game as an &quot;expansive RPG experience filled with NPC quests, compelling characters, and rich narrative.&quot; The world is also said to be five times larger and interconnected. The focus is once again on soulslike combat, said to be faster than the precursor game with a touch of &quot;devastating magic.&quot;
While we hear the voice of Stranger Things actor Joseph Quinn in the trailer, players will be creating their own identities. It&#x27;s unknown if Quinn will be featured in the game or if he just narrated the trailer. The Lords of the Fallen doesn&#x27;t have a release date yet, but will release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.
The world of soulslike games has evolved significantly since Lords of the Fallen hit the market. What are you hoping to see from the sequel? Let us know in the comments section below!</span>

Everywhere’s reveal trailer showed a montage of disparate gameplay and art styles, from more cartoony racing to sci-fi to realistic human characters. As its name implies, Everywhere hopes to offer a variety of experiences both user-created and otherwise. Its newly launched website offers this description:
“Everywhere seamlessly blends gameplay, adventure, creativity and discovery in an all-new multi-world gaming experience that redefines how players connect with one another and with the digital world around them.”
“Our intent has always been to push the boundaries of what a videogame can be while still delivering an innovative player-first experience,” said Benzies. “The team we’ve built and the partners we’ve made since our founding are coalescing around the unique vision we’re bringing to life. It’s exciting to be a part of, and we can’t wait to reveal more about Everywhere in coming months.”
Everywhere is slated to arrive in 2023, though no platforms were specified.</span>

That’s along with a host of changes coming to the core game experience.
Lightfall will arrive on February 28, 2023. The expansion represents the “beginning of the end” of the Light and Darkness Saga that has been unfolding for many years now.

You can download Destiny 2 on the Epic Store right now, and those that do before August 30 can claim the 30th Anniversary Pack for free. This pack, which was released last December for $24.99, contains the Gjallarhorn Exotic Rocket Launcher, Thorn armor set, a new three-player dungeon, in addition to other goodies. 
Today at 5 p.m. Pacific, Fortnite players can purchase the skins of Ikora, Zavala, and the Exo Stranger, their weapons, and can even drop into the island atop a Sparrow. A new Fortnite island inspired by the Javelin-4 Crucible map is available now and features control-style gameplay. On the flip side, Fortnite ornament sets can be obtained in Destiny 2. 
On September 17, Destiny 2 invades Fall Guys with Guardian-inspired cosmetics, spicy ramen celebration emote, and other accessories.

                              <span>A Nintendo Treehouse Live is set to air this week, and it will focus on fleshing out more of Splatoon 3&#x27;s offerings and provide a new look at the upcoming Harvestella. The event takes place on Thursday, August 25, at 9:30 a.m. Pacific/12:30 p.m. Eastern and airs on Nintendo&#x27;s YouTube channel. 
Splatoon 3, which recently had a dedicated Direct presentation, gets another spotlight focusing on its single-player campaign. Nintendo promises a “deep-dive” look at the story mode, which has only been lightly touched on up to this point. Additionally, the presentation will unveil the arenas available in the Splatfest World Premiere demo that goes live on August 27.
We’ll also see fresh gameplay for Harvestella, Square Enix’s promising-looking action RPG meets farming simulator that arrives to Switch (and PC) on November 4. 
Get ready for a Nintendo Treehouse: Live presentation on 8/25 at 9:30am PT featuring 3 segments:

                              <span>Based on a recent Instagram post on the official PlayStation account, we can finally pin down a launch period for the highly-anticipated PSVR2: &quot;Coming early 2023.&quot; You can see the corresponding tweet below.

While the announcement is relatively brief, we do know PSVR2 will release with over 20 major first-party and third-party games, including new titles like Horizon: Call of the Mountain and ports of Resident Evil Village, No Man&#x27;s Sky, and The Walking Dead: Saints &amp; Sinners Ch. 2. Additionally, the system boasts new orb-like controllers with haptic feedback and adaptive triggers (like the DualSense), a single cord setup with PlayStation 5 consoles for ease-of-access, a see-through view, and better resolution/tracking – we&#x27;re talking two different modes of visual fidelity. 
According to our very own Marcus Stewart, &quot;VR mode displays VR content in a 360-degree view in 4000 x 2040 HDR video format (2000 x 2040 per eye) and 90Hz/120Hz frame rate. Cinematic Mode lets players view non-VR media and the PS5 interface in 1920×1080 HDR video format with 24/60Hz and 120Hz frame rate.&quot;
PSVR2 drops in early 2023, with a specific date to be announced at some point in the future.</span>

                              <span>A lawsuit accusing YouTube of operating a two-tier copyright enforcement system is seen by some as a beacon of hope for smaller artists. YouTube&#x27;s failure to have the case dismissed was recently publicized in entertainment media, but few outlets addressed the allegations of fraud that have dogged the case from the start. Google&#x27;s latest filing offers a comprehensive reminder.

                              <span>Tento měsíc se objevila zranitelnost hojně využívané knihovny zlib CVE-2022–37434. Zranitelnost spočívá v přetečení bufferu, což umožní útočníkovi číst libovolné části paměti. Zranitelné jsou jen aplikace, které volají inflateGetHeader. Například nodejs  inflateGetHeader nepoužívá a není tedy zranitelná.</span>

After a publisher found 10 of its books on Z-Library, a court ordered ISPs to block the site.

                              <span>Soldier Boyz is the newest supported game of the Hypno engine, and it’s ready for public testing!
Released in 1997 by Hypnotix and published by DreamCatcher Interactive and MCPA Interactive, this full-motion rail shooter is based on the 1995 film of the same name. The game starts when the daughter of an American billionaire is kidnapped by a group of Vietnamese terrorists. Then, it’s up to Major Howard Toliver, ex-Marine and highly decorated Vietnam veteran, to gather a deadly team for the dangerous mission of rescuing her. He recruits six prison inmates serving life sentences for a chance at a full presidential pardon.
Keep the body count rising to survive five territories by playing as each Soldier Boy (and Girl),
but beware and don’t waste a “friendly” since they provide vital survival information!
ScummVM currently supports the English release of the game (which is the only one we know about) and features more responsive controls than the original. We couldn&#x27;t find a demo but there is a trailer. Please contact us if you have a demo or any other release.
To play the game with ScummVM, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.

The subreddit didn&#x27;t tolerate links to infringing content but some posts and comments still slipped through. Reddit notes that the ban is justified under its repeat infringer policy but the sub&#x27;s moderators say that they were never warned.

                              <span>Obsidian, the first supported game of the mTropolis engine, is ready for public testing!
Created in 1996 by Rocket Science Games and published in early 1997, this ambitious 3D-rendered first-person adventure has you journey through 4 surreal, dream-like worlds in search of your lost colleague.
ScummVM currently supports the English and German versions.  It features a widescreen mode, improved cinematic quality, and a few bug fixes. A Japanese version also exists, but we need more information about it to support it. Please contact us if you have a copy of the Japanese version or some other language version that we haven&#x27;t discovered yet.
To play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. You can also download a demo here.  If you encounter any issues, please submit them to the issue tracker!

                              <span>Free your mind for yet another ScummVM release!
Nine newly supported games on 6 engines will plunge you into a variety of different settings. Are you able to escape from an alien-infested planet? What about challenging the Lord of the Dead in the Underworld? And have you ever explored the deepest depth of your psyche to see if you really know yourself?
Find out in one of the following titles:
Sanitarium
Hades Challenge
Marvel Comics Spider-Man: The Sinister Six
The 11th Hour
Clandestiny
Tender Loving Care (CD-ROM Editions)
Uncle Henry&#x27;s Playhouse
Wetlands
Chewy: Esc from F5
Besides adding new games, we are always focused on improving already supported games. Once again, we managed to squash quite a few bugs from various engines. It is always impressive to see bugs getting fixed in engines that are more than 20 years old!
One of the main new features of ScummVM 2.6.0 is a completely new way to view your games in an amazing icon grid overview via our launcher. Accompanied by some very shiny artwork provided by our graphics artists, you are now able to show off your collection like never before. It almost looks and feels like a virtual shelf!
Check out the full Release Notes for a comprehensive summary of how our developers managed to make ScummVM even more amazing!
You can find all of this goodness available for a number of platforms on our downloads page. If you are using Windows, macOS or the Ubuntu Snap package, the autoupdater will assist you in updating to ScummVM 2.6.0.
As always, thank you for your continuous support — happy adventuring!
