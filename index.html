                    <span>Every year a glut of video game releases hit the market, making it hard to keep track of everything. RPG fans had a pretty good 2021, from fantastic indies to new games in popular franchises. Bandai Namco gave us two stellar RPGs in Tales of Arise and Scarlet Nexus. Remakes and remasters, like Nier: Replicant, Mass Effect Legendary Edition, and Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, provided plenty of nostalgia, while also bringing new fans into the fold. Longawaited entries finally debuted with Shin Megami Tensei V and Neo: The World Ends With You. And that’s only scratching the surface. Here are five RPGs worth your time that may have slipped past your radar.

                    <span>New year, new(ish) games.
The first week of 2022 has passed, and it was relatively quiet as everyone settled back into their routines. That said there were still some interesting bits and bobs, such as the revelation that producing the grass was a bit of a pain for the Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity team. Elsewhere we had Metacritic listing Nintendo&#x27;s highest rated games of 2021, A PlayStation store in China recruiting Mario and Bowser to the cause, and someone performed an Undertale track for the Pope. Yeah, it&#x27;ll be a weird year, but at least it&#x27;s looking like a terrific 12 months for gaming on Switch.
Anyhoo, it&#x27;s time to chill out and discuss our weekend gaming plans. A few members of the Nintendo Life team have done just that below, so feel free to give our entries a read and then join in with your own via our comment section. Enjoy!

Nintendo yesterday uploaded a brand new six-minute trailer of Pokémon Legends: Arceus, a Switch release that arrives later this month on January 28th.
To go with it, it&#x27;s also shared three new commercials - showcasing the game&#x27;s environments, mechanics and all of the Pokémon trainers can expect to encounter in the region of Hisui. Here they are in full:

                    <span>Due out this March.
Square Enix&#x27;s turn-based tactical epic Triangle Strategy is due out on Nintendo Switch this March. Ahead of its arrival, the game has been rated by the Entertainment Software Rating Board in North America.
This title has received a &#x27;T&#x27; for Teen rating and contains blood, fantasy violence, language, mild suggestive themes and use of alcohol. Here&#x27;s the ESRB summary to go with it:

                    <span>And Luigi is going on vacation.
While we wait for Mario Kart 9, which is supposedly in &quot;active development&quot;, why not check out Mario Kart Tour?
The game&#x27;s been available since 2019 and Nintendo is still providing it with regular content updates. At the end of last year, the game got the New Year Tour - adding in Bowser&#x27;s Castle from Mario Kart 7, and in the next update it&#x27;ll be adding Singapore Speedway.

                    <span>&#x27;Awesome Games Done Quick&#x27;.
It&#x27;s that time of year again! No, not the one where you &quot;skip the gym just this one time&quot; and never go back, or the time where you try to remember if wrapping paper is recyclable — it&#x27;s Awesome Games Done Quick, the charity speedrunning marathon that lasts for an entire week!
This year&#x27;s AGDQ is in support of the Prevent Cancer Foundation, and will take place from Sunday, 9th January through to Sunday, 16th January. Following on from Summer Games Done Quick&#x27;s record $2.9 million raised for Doctors Without Borders, AGDQ will feature a massive list of speedruns over the course of a week in an attempt to inch closer to that $3 million mark.

I look forward to swimming in sight of some snowy hills today then hiking through some snowy hills tomorrow, then returning to my cosy flat. But what are you playing this weekend?

                    <span>Earlier this year, Atlus announced that it wants “to create a 6 which exceeds 5.” I can only speak for myself, but that’s a hard bar to rise above. Persona 5 (and its Royal expansion) is easily one of my favorite games of all time. The limited details surrounding the next game’s narrative, combat, and music have forced superfans like me to make their own wishlists. So, here are six – that’s right, six! – features I’d like to see in Persona 6:

Look, I love Persona’s tried and true narrative DNA – a crew of teenage outcasts call upon their mystical alter egos to defend the world from evil forces while also juggling hobbies, romance, and classes. Nevertheless, I’m ready for Atlus to bring the series’ mature themes to the adult world.

                    <span>For a while in the late 2000s, developers at Rockstar New England thought they were working on the next big Rockstar game.
They were excited to push the company’s tech and to bring a cult hit into Rockstar’s vision for the future. They were excited for the chance to prove themselves as a Rockstar studio, having recently been purchased by the company. They were excited to lead development on Bully 2, the sequel to Rockstar’s critically acclaimed open-world adventure about life in a private school.
But things don’t always go as planned, and other obligations on a release schedule get in the way of passion projects. Rockstar New England’s Bully 2 was shelved in favor of other, more troubled projects in development, like Max Payne 3 and Red Dead Redemption.

                    <span>If you’re someone who feels most comfortable in a pair of Chucks who is also a fan of Pokémon, then we have some news for you: Converse has made your new favorite pair of shoes. 
That is, if you can get your hands on them, err, feet in them. Converse’s Pokémon collection went live today and it features 22 different things to buy ranging from adult shoes to children’s shoes to shirts, hats, and more. And to be honest, all of it looks great.
Right now, a quick stroll through the collection page will reveal that the Converse x Pokémon First Partners Chuck Taylor All-Star shoes, Converse x Pokémon Poké Ball Chuck Taylor All Star shoes, and the Converse x Pokémon Pikachu Chuck Taylor All Star Easy-On shoes are sold out.

                    <span>The King of Fighters XV is coming close to having a complete roster, with the frosty fighter Kula Diamond becoming the 38th member. 
Kula and her ice-centric moves were revealed in a new trailer this week. Formerly a member of Team K&#x27; in past King of Fighters installments, she&#x27;s joined the tournament with newcomer Krohnen (who&#x27;s mechanically a callback to the popular Akira-inspired KOF character K9999) and Ángel, a former NESTS assassin with a pro wrestling move set.

It would have been quite the shock if a fan-favorite face like Kula didn&#x27;t make the main roster of KOFXV, but since she&#x27;s the 38th character revealed from a confirmed roster of 39, other mainstays like Taekwondo practitioner Kim may have to wait for DLC or miss out entirely. There are rumors as to who the final character will end up being, but what we do know is there&#x27;s only one spot on a team open, and it&#x27;s alongside Ash Crimson and Kukri. 
The King of Fighters XV is scheduled for release on February 17 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Those who preorder it digitally can start fighting a few days sooner with an early access period that begins on February 14.</span>

                    <span>South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone revealed last August that a new South Park game is in the works alongside “several spinoff movies” and more, and now, we know what studio is developing that title. 
Revealed on a Careers web page, Question Games, the team behind The Magic Circle and The Blackout Club, is working on a new South Park game and a job listing might hint at multiplayer. The listing also reveals that the game will be developed in Unreal Engine with an aim to release on “modern systems” such as PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

“Question and South Park Digital Studios are seeking a Lead Level Designer for work on a new video game set in the world of South Park,” the Lead Level Designer job listing on Question Games’ Careers page reads. 
The requirements section of this listing reveals that multiplayer experience is a must for anyone who applies, which could hint that this South Park game could feature some kind of multiplayer. This would be especially interesting because both South Park: The Stick of Truth and South Park: The Fractured But Whole were single-player. 
“Multiplayer Experience – Shipped at least one multiplayer game as a senior level designer or have equivalent relevant experience,” the requirements for the Lead Level Designer position read.

You can check out the full Careers page here, but there’s not much else to gleam from the listings. Whether or not this South Park game resembles the last two released or is something totally different, only time will tell. For now, read Game Informer’s South Park: The Stick of Truth review and then check out Game Informer’s South Park: The Fractured But Whole review.

                    <span>A not-so-long time ago in the same galaxy we all reside in, Respawn Entertainment deviated from its first-person shooter roots to create Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. This third-person action game was the studio’s first stab at tackling the coveted Star Wars license, crafting an original adventure set five years after Revenge of the Sith. It stars Cal Kestis, a padawan turned junker (played by Shameless star Cameron Monaghan) that managed to evade the Jedi purge of Order 66. After he’s outed by the Sith, he embarks on a quest to recover an artifact capable of locating force-sensitive children while also avoiding capture by the Inquisitors, who are elite Jedi hunters. 
The game features a blend of lightsaber combat and a suite of Force abilities. Borrowing inspiration from FromSoftware’s Soul series, encounters are challenging, requiring a strategic blend of blocks and parries to outduel opponents. Meanwhile, the various planets take on a Metroid-inspired progression with players unlocking abilities to backtrack to previously inaccessible areas.

Fallen Order was released November 15, 2019, and was a critical and financial success. It also served as a saving grace for single-player fans, providing proof to an increasingly multiplayer-focused EA that linear story-driven experiences can still make the big bucks. With a sequel reportedly in the works, we’re revisiting this gem of the Star Wars video game pantheon. 
Join Marcus Stewart, Daniel Tack, and Andrew Reiner on Twitch today at 2 p.m. Central as we journey through the entirety of Cal Kestis’ adventure. Expect plenty of laughs, deaths, and general nerding out over all things Star Wars. We encourage you to hang out with us in chat.

                    <span>Update, 1/7/21:
Yesterday, Game Informer reported that Days Gone director Jeff Ross said Bend Studio&#x27;s latest game sold more than Ghost of Tsushima, which recently hit a milestone after selling 8 million copies. However, in a recent livestream with former God of War and Twisted Metal director David Jaffe, Ross revealed that his source for the sales numbers was a now-defunct website called Gamestat, which tracks PlayStation Trophy data, as reported by PushSquare. 
Here&#x27;s what Ross said: &quot;Where I got my data from, I had access to a lot of telemetry, and I could see stuff and when we were at 5 million copies – when we were announced at 5 million copies – the telemetry data was at 5.8 [million]. There are basically resells or shared discs. I was actually using an external website – I think the…</span>

                    <span>The cleverly named Pupperazzi, a cute game about taking snapshots of doggos that appeared during last August’s ID@Xbox Showcase, has a release date. Best of all, it’s coming in just a couple of weeks – January 20 to be exact.
Does the idea of Pokémon Snap but with dogs appeal to you? Pupperazzi has you covered. Armed with your trusty camera, you’ll capture a variety of dog breeds in a world seemingly populated with nothing but canines. You’ll catch them doing all manner of strange things, like jamming to music, riding bicycles (somehow), or executing death-defying skateboard tricks. You can adorn pups in different outfits and upgrade your camera to capture better, more dynamic photos. Watch the most recent gameplay trailer below if you need something to cheer you up.

Pupperazzi is slated for Xbox consoles and PC and is coming to Xbox Game Pass (console and PC) at launch. If photography games are your jam, here’s a handy list of similar titles aimed to please the shutterbug in you.</span>

                    <span>Former Bend Studio director Jeff Ross revealed earlier this week that Days Gone sold more than Ghost of Tsushima, but was not praised like it and instead seen as a disappointment by Sony and PlayStation. Discussing that with former God of War and Twisted Metal director David Jaffe on a recent livestream, Ross also revealed some other pitches Bend Studio made after a sequel to Days Gone was rejected. 
As first reported by Video Games Chronicle, Ross said he was especially interested in rebooting PlayStation’s long-dormant Resistance series, which was created by Insomniac Games back in the PlayStation 3 generation. Like the pitch to Days Gone 2, though, it was rejected.

                    <span>Look, I’m not going to lie – when Kilter Films, Bethesda Game Studios, and Amazon announced back in 2020 that a Fallout TV series was in the works, I immediately wrote it off. Surely it’d be another video game TV project that would stumble through development until it’s quietly canceled, only for the world to collectively ask years later, “Hey, what happened to that Fallout show?” That’s what video game movies and TV developments have done to me. In this instance, though, it appears I’m wrong because production is moving forward and the show now has a director. 
Those familiar with HBO’s Westworld series might recognize him, too, as it’s the same person who created and executive produced that series: Jonathan Nolan, the brother of famed director Christopher Nolan (The Dark Night, Inception…</span>

                    <span>Pokémon Legends: Arceus is right around the corner, hitting Switch on January 28, and Nintendo has been slowly revving up its marketing for the upcoming hub-based RPG. That continued today with a new six-minute trailer released on the Japanese Nintendo YouTube account and while the entire video is in Japanese, it still gives us a great look at what’s in store for us in the Hisui region. 
Namely, the locations, pocket monsters, and NPCs we’ll be encountering. It also gives us our best look at the HUD and menu screens in Pokémon Legends: Arceus thus far as well. If you’ve been following this game since its announcement, you’ll notice that the game is looking much better than when it was first shown, too.

Pokémon Legends: Arceus has been described by Nintendo as an open-hub game, akin to the Monster Hunter series, rather than an open-world one and while that’s still the case, this trailer reveals these hubs are actually quite large – big enough to make flying around on a Pokémon or riding on the back of one in water very viable. 
The entire trailer is exciting and it offers us our best look at Pokémon Legends: Arceus yet so if you’re excited for this upcoming RPG, it’s definitely worth six minutes of your time. 
For more, be sure to check out this trailer released last month that introduces the Diamond and Pearl clans to the game and then read about how Hisuian Voltorb still somehow looks like a Pokéball. Check out this reveal of the Hisuian forms for Zorua and Zoroark in Pokémon Legends: Arceus after that.

                    <span>How it was meant to be played, obviously.
Twitch Plays Pokémon has a lot to answer for. What began with a goofy experiment to see if the hivemind could actually play an old game has blossomed into an entire genre of gameplay: Playing Pokémon in weird ways, the latest of which is Pokémon inside of a Twitter avatar. If things keep going this way, we&#x27;ll be playing Pokémon on a network of fungi by 2030.
Constantin Liétard, the Montreal-based creator of Pokémon Red-inside-a-Twitter-avatar, has just announced that his latest project, Pokémon Crystal-inside-a-Twitter-avatar, is now ready to play. At the time of writing, the player character is just about to pick their first starter.

It&#x27;s a new year — one with loads of 2s in it, whatever that means — and that means getting ready for a whole lot of things to look forward to. We&#x27;ve already covered 30 games that we&#x27;re excited for in 2022, but there are so many more than fly under the radar: Indie games! So, why not shine our spotlight on some of the smaller-but-brilliant games coming to the Nintendo Switch this year?
Of course, we won&#x27;t be repeating any of the games that made it to our big 30 — that means that you won&#x27;t find Windjammers 2, OlliOlli World, Card Shark, Outer Wilds, Sports Story, Oxenfree II, TMNT: Shredder&#x27;s Revenge, Metal Slug Tactics, River City Girls 2, or Hollow Knight: Silksong here. Instead, we hope you&#x27;ll find some games you didn&#x27;t even know about before — we certainly did!

                    <span>And that Switch Pro is a no go.
With all of the rumours regarding the infamous &#x27;Switch Pro&#x27; and the eventual release of the Switch OLED model last year, we&#x27;ve hardly had a chance to think about Nintendo&#x27;s true next generation of hardware. For the past year or two, the Switch has been described on more than one occasion as being in the &quot;middle&quot; of its lifecycle, suggesting there are plenty more years for it to thrive.
But, should history repeat itself once more, something new will eventually take over the reins. Decades since this hobby of ours took off, we&#x27;re still yet to see a system live on without a successor replacing it after a handful of years – so what does Nintendo&#x27;s future look like, and when can we expect a new system to take Switch&#x27;s place?

German musician Remute is creating the first &#x27;album on a cart&#x27; for the Nintendo 64, it has been revealed.
Remute has previously released similar carts for the Genesis / Mega Drive, SNES, PC Engine and Game Boy, but states that &#x27;R64&#x27; will be the most &quot;diverse and playful album&quot; so far.

                    <span>And we could see it later this year.
It feels like an awfully long time has passed since the last traditional Mario Kart experience came our way.
Mario Kart 8 Deluxe arrived on Switch back in 2017, which itself was a rerelease of 2014&#x27;s Wii U entry, and with mobile&#x27;s Mario Kart Tour and experimental Switch title Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit filling the gap since, some fans are beginning to wonder when the next &#x27;main&#x27; game will arrive. According to one trusted games industry analyst, the next entry could actually be speeding into view quicker than you think.

Famitsu&#x27;s Japanese chart figures are now in for the two weeks spanning 20th December to 2nd January, revealing that Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl are still performing very strongly indeed at the top of the pile.
The two games sold a further 231,275 retail copies combined in Japan over the holidays, taking their total physical sales count to almost 2.4 million. Once again, they&#x27;re followed by a top ten made up exclusively of Nintendo Switch titles, with Mario Party Superstars coming in second place with 206,145 physical sales over the period.

We might still be saying &quot;Happy New Year&quot; to people we meet, but we&#x27;re well into January now and when we survey the upcoming slate of games for Switch, we have to say it&#x27;s looking particularly tasty. However, as great as Pokémon and Kirby are shaping up, it&#x27;s The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild 2 that will likely have Switch owners salivating over the coming 365 days in gaming. Yes, 2022 is the year we&#x27;ll be skydiving into one of the most anticipated sequels in video game history.

                    <span>It even makes &#x27;re-mars-tered&#x27; forgivable.
We&#x27;ve seen plenty of smaller download titles sold at ludicrous discounts on the Switch over the past few years, but we&#x27;re starting to see some bigger titles get the same treatment. Saints Row IV was a recent example with a 93% discount, and now Red Faction: Guerrilla Re-Mars-tered has joined the party.
It&#x27;s currently a whopping 93% off in Europe and 90% off in North America; normally $29.99USD / €29,99 / £26.99, it&#x27;s currently $2.99USD / €1,99 / £1.79. The end date is a little different per territory too, with the price drop ending on 12th January in Europe and 17th January in North America. Plenty in Team NL have grabbed it at those prices already.

Embattled North American video game retailer GameStop plans to build an NFT marketplace where players can buy, sell and trade NFTs and virtual in-game items, it is being reported.
According to The Wall Street Journal, GameStop is building an internal crypto division and has already hired 20 staff for this purpose. The marketplace is expected to launch later this year, and game companies are already being asked to offer their NFTs through it.

Sega could choose to avoid selling NFTs and halt its plans regarding Play-to-Earn schemes in response to fan feedback, the company has announced.
Back in April last year, Sega revealed that it had teamed up with game developer Double Jump.Tokyo with the intention of launching NFT content relating to the company&#x27;s classic and current IPs, as well as upcoming projects. Fan reaction to the news appeared to be largely negative from the off, as has been the case with most games industry NFT announcements since, and it hasn&#x27;t gone unnoticed.

Pokémon GO has been around for a fair few years now, and has made its creators a bunch of cash via in-app purchases and sponsored PokéStops and gyms. However, it would seem that Niantic is looking to expand the money-making potential of the game by including Google ads.
Datamining group PokeMiners has spotted that the 0.227.0 update includes placeholders for the Google Ad Library. The placeholders could cover everything from small banner ads to half or even full-page ones.

If you were lucky enough to have had a copy of Mario Party DS back in the day, you might well remember Toadette’s Music Room, one of the game&#x27;s unique boards. What we&#x27;re willing to bet you didn&#x27;t know, however, is that the board actually contains a cool little easter egg relating to an older game in the series.
Toadette’s Music Room is, as is probably obvious, a music-themed board that has players running around a room littered with instruments and over the keys of a giant piano. Dotted around the room are several sheets of music, and it&#x27;s here that this seemingly newly discovered secret lies.

For those wondering what the cumulative gain was for 2021 from all these AMD graphics driver changes, here are some end-of-year 2020 vs. 2021 benchmarks across a number of different Linux games while testing on Vega, Navi, and Navi 2 graphics cards.</span>

From the industry which bought you &quot;levelution&quot;, the &quot;drivatar&quot;, and &quot;gameplay trailers&quot; which aren&#x27;t gameplay comes a new one: &quot;gameplay lore trailer&quot;. The year has barely begun but Ubisoft are gunning it out the gate with the new Rainbow Six Siege trailer. This new gameplay lore trailer—yeesh!—explains why a game set within Tom Clancy&#x27;s serious world of paranoid jingoistic masturbation is overrun with a weird parasite mutating people into monsters.

                    <span>2021 was the year of the time loop wasn&#x27;t it? Deathloop topped a lot of charts and made an appearance in our game of the year list. Twelve Minutes: a timeloop thriller. Lemnis Gate: a tactical FPS where you out time loop one another. The Forgotten City, the Outer Wilds DLC, watching a man throw a “traditional shaped returning” boomerang on YouTube. All of them, time loops.
I’m absolutely sick of them. So here’s me hoping that 2022 is the year of the &quot;time skip&quot;, instead. Or at least, one of these coming years an excessive number of games built around skipping time. Yes, they aren&#x27;t without their flaws, but I&#x27;d argue they&#x27;re less repetitive and capable of greater surprise. Alright, at least hear me out.

                    <span>CES is a gloriously mad hodgepodge of different tech fields; the kind where smartphone chip makers share floor space with car manufacturers and sex toys. It’s also one of the biggest showcases of PC gaming hardware in the calendar, and CES 2022 has been no exception, with major component reveals from AMD, Intel, and Nvidia along with loads of gaming laptop, peripheral, and monitor announcements.


This year’s show is technically still going for another day, but like a Foo Fighters album, CES tends to front-load the good stuff. As such, it’s basically safe to start rounding up any PC gaming kit highlights. Some of these have been a long time coming – like the GeForce RTX 3050, Nvidia’s first XX50 desktop GPU with full ray tracing and DLSS support – while others might be pleasant surprises or eye-catching, if likely to be witheringly expensive, new concepts.

                    <span>I was a little worried about Left 4 Dead-alike Rainbow Six: Extraction. You know, after it was announced as Rainbow Six: Quarantine, changed its name, dipped under the radar for ages, then re-emerged with news it was being delayed. Signs pointed to a shaky spin-off from Rainbow Six: Siege&#x27;s popular Outbreak mode. But no, I was totally wrong! After an early hands on with the game, I’m now at ease, at least when I’m at a safe distance. You see, the zombies here may be fewer in number, but they don’t mess about. This makes for a tactical spin on zombie-slaying that truly rewards teamwork, and it’s wonderful as a result.

We&#x27;ve got another year of hip new video games to look forward to, and we&#x27;ve been busy rustling up the ones we&#x27;re most excited about. In truth, there are tons of games on the horizon that could easily sit on this list, and some of them are so close to release we can practically already see the pixels on our screens morphing into their lush, polygonal landscapes. Games like Monster Hunter Rise, God Of War and Rainbow Six Extraction. You won&#x27;t find them here, but trust us, you&#x27;ll be seeing a lot of them over the coming weeks. 
There are always more games coming out than we have fingers to write about them, but the 2022 games we&#x27;ve listed below are the ones the RPS team are personally most looking forward to playing. We&#x27;ve got games big and small here, and they&#x27;re all listed in alphabetical order. After all, release dates are increasingly slippery beasts these days. Think we&#x27;ve missed something? Why not take to the comments below and tell us all about it. You might just convince us to put it on our radars. But enough from me. Here are our 43 most anticipated games of 2022.

                    <span>Last September, Studio Pixel Punk released Unsighted, a top-down action RPG with a unique time limit on the life of its NPCs. It quickly garnered high praise from critics, including RPS&#x27; own Katharine Castle who named it one of the Best Games You Missed in 2021. To find out more about this indie gem, I got in touch with Studio Pixel Punk&#x27;s pair of developers Fernanda Dias and Tiani Pixel to talk to them about its inspirations, turning off its timer, and the true meaning behind the game&#x27;s name.

It’s a lovely looking adventure with a neat concept, so it was sad to hear that they&#x27;d been hit with layoffs after a difficult launch. However, some heartening news! More levels are on the way, as well as new character customisation tools. They also reaffirmed that despite being a much smaller team than before, they&#x27;re committed to working on the game for the foreseeable.

                    <span>Unsurprisingly, E3 will once again not happen as an in-person event this year, what with the whole global pandemic and all. The Entertainment Software Association, who organise E3, had hoped that the main event on the video games industry&#x27;s marketing calendar would return properly this year, after skipping 2019 and going online in 2020, but nope. While they haven&#x27;t yet confirmed whether or not they&#x27;ll arrange an online E3 in its stead, they seem to be considering it. But even if not, the industry will doubltess manage to host its own advert-o-ramas without the E3 banner.

                    <span>The justice system is stupid. You can go to jail for setting a plant on fire and putting it in your mouth. Shut up, the police. Be smart for once. Maybe people would stop trying to escape from prison if you did something sensible like, I don&#x27;t know, cease being a militarised gang of dirtbag predators. Stop watching everyone through video cameras, you absolute creeps. What? Oh right, video games. Here&#x27;s 9 of the best jailbreaks in PC games.

                    <span>Nintendo sold a lot of Switch consoles in Japan last year. Like a lot—5.3 million, to be exact. The Switch was easily the best-selling console in Japan in 2021, beating out the PlayStation 5, which didn’t even crack a million units. In fact, you can add up all the other consoles sold in the country, and you’d still be…

                    <span>Last holiday season the Quest 2 VR headset had gotten off to a rocky start, with reviewers praising the virtual reality headset’s tech, but panning its mandatory Facebook integration.

                    <span>For the past few years, Nintendo has been in stasis. Sure, the Switch has seen no shortage of terrific games recently, but Nintendo’s annual slates have lacked the incandescent marquees that defined the hybrid console’s first year or two. The dry streak comes to a halting stop in 2022, which is shaping up to be a…

But now Papa Francis can add being a listener to game soundtracks to his wheelhouse as well. He’s apparently a big fan of Undertale’s infectiously catchy song “Megalovania.” And no, you…

                    <span>Horizon Zero Dawn set a solid foundation for Guerrilla Games to build upon in Horizon Forbidden West, and the developer isn’t about to let this opportunity pass it by.

                    <span>It looks like E3 2022 will follow in the footsteps of last year’s show by being a digital-only event. Although the hope after 2021 was a return to an in-person gathering at the Los Angeles Convention Center (with even the city’s mayor crossing his fingers), the ongoing pandemic has nixed those plans. 
In a statement to Venture Beat, posted below, the ESA confirmed that the coronavirus remains a major issue so it’s playing it safe for one more year:
As we all know, the pandemic is still very much a thing, especially with the Omicron variant running rampant. This isn’t the biggest shock in the world but still disappointing for fans, developers, and media hoping to reconnect in person this June. Since the pandemic started, E3 has been canceled outright in 2020 and the 2021 edition saw the event unfold through a series of livestreams and digital meetings held on the ESA’s website. If nothing else, it&#x27;ll be interesting to see how the ESA iterates on last year&#x27;s approach.

We&#x27;re back with 2022&#x27;s first episode of The Game Informer Show! This week, we&#x27;re breaking down our thoughts on the PlayStation VR 2 and Horizon Call of the Mountain, along with catching you up with all the games we&#x27;ve been playing over the holidays! Also, Inquisitor of Indie Games Jill Grodt and Marcus Stewart join the Alexes this week and add to another stellar round of Listener Questions to round out the show.

                    <span>One of the worst experiences I ever had in virtual reality was rolling credits on Half-Life: Alyx. Not playing the game – mind you – that was fantastic. No, I hated rolling credits on the game because I knew this phenomenal AAA VR experience was over, and I didn’t know when I would ever have another VR adventure of that caliber again.
Anyone who has ever put on a VR headset can tell you that the technology is promising. Anyone who owns a VR headset can tell you how slow the industry has been to fulfill that promise. I love creative offerings like Beat Saber, Superhot VR, and Pistol Whip. Those entertaining diversions make me happy to have a headset, but they only provide one type of experience. I still crave meatier, story-based VR adventures. Stuff like Half-Life: Alyx and … and … and wel…</span>

                    <span>A very creative person has designed Lego versions of the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and while they aren’t available to purchase at the moment, they could be one day. 
Twitter user BrickinNick revealed these two proof-of-concept Lego kits today with a stylish video and it turns out, with enough support, these could become real. That’s thanks to Lego Ideas, which is a unique Lego program where users can submit project concepts such as Lego new-gen consoles and ask for support. With enough backing, Lego could bring these conceptual kits to fruition. That assitance is what BrickinNick is asking for on Twitter and showing it requires simply creating a Lego Ideas account and clicking support. BrickinNick says 10,000 supporters can help this project become a Lego set so if you like what you …</span>

                    <span>Action! We all love it, and some of the best games have it, whether that takes the form of a bombastic shooter, sword-clashing melee fest, or good old-fashioned brawler. Action is one of the most universally beloved genres, so we’ve compiled a list of upcoming games that already have our adrenaline pumping. Rather than rank them, each game is arranged in chronological release order so you’ll know how long you’ll have to wait before you can get your hand on them. And hey, just because an action game didn’t make the cut doesn’t mean it won’t be worth a look! These are just the titles that, at a glance, raised our eyebrows the highest.

                    <span>Bioware general manager Gary McKay has posted a blog discussing the state of the studio as it marches into 2022. The post provides some insight into the company&#x27;s development and cultural goals moving forward, as well as light updates on its upcoming projects.
You can read the full post here, but one of the biggest takeaways is Bioware’s acknowledgment of previous missteps and its mission to get back in the good graces of its fans. McKay states that “When I took on the GM role, I talked about rebuilding our reputation, and that remains a huge priority. We are laser-focused on building back the trust of our fans and community, and we plan to do that by delivering the types of games that we are best known for and ensuring they are of the highest quality.” McKay touts the positive reception o…</span>

Our first livestream of the year is centered on the latest expansion to Final Fantasy XIV Online, Endwalker. Join fearless adventurers and Game Informer editors John Carson and Dan Tack to venture into some of the new dungeons and explore the new zones, including the surface of the moon! 
The stream is set to go live at 2 p.m. Central this afternoon on our Twitch channel, so don&#x27;t miss it.

The sky is falling and only the Scions of the Seventh Dawn and the Warrior of Light are prepared to take on whatever or whoever is causing the calamitous end of days. Endwalker signals the conclusion to the Hydaelyn and Zodiark storyline, a central conflict between the forces of light and darkness that&#x27;s been at the core of FFXIV&#x27;s story since its early days. The expansion brings multiple new zones and two exciting new Jobs, the Sage and Reaper. 
Give us a follow on Twitch so you know when we&#x27;re live for any of our various livestreams.

                    <span>Far Cry 6 was released last October, and while the base game offered dozens of hours of FPS action gameplay, Ubisoft upped the ante by committing to free content drops and three paid DLCs. 
Some of the free DLC includes Los Pollos Hermanos and Heisenberg outfits from Breaking Bad, while the first paid DLC, dubbed Vaas’ Insanity, gave players the chance to play as the infamous villain from Far Cry 3. Vaas’ Insanity was the first part of a villain-focused trilogy included in the Far Cry 6 season pass that costs $40. The second villainous DLC will star Far Cry 4’s Pagan Min, and now, Ubisoft announced that it’s coming next week. 
Dive into the twisted mind of Pagan Min. The new Pagan: Control DLC is coming January 11. pic.twitter.com/2hIr1xoPkc
January 5, 2022
More specifically, it will go live on January 11. Like the Vaas experience before it and the forthcoming Joseph Seed DLC coming after it, this Pagan Min-focused episode called Pagan: Control is a rogue-like experience that sees the Troy Baker-voiced villain “struggling to escape the horrors of their own minds.” You will die a lot and retry a lot, Ubisoft promises. 
You begin with a pistol and must find new weapons and powers to progress through Pagan Min’s mind. You’ll be able to give this experience a go in five days on January 11. 
For more, read about the other DLC offerings you can expect in Far Cry 6, and then check out our thoughts on the game in Game Informer’s Far Cry 6 review. Read about the Vaas’ Insanity DLC after that.

                    <span>It is important to keep in mind what is going on within Activision Blizzard at this time regarding ongoing allegations about the work culture. The ongoing lawsuit from the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) against the company is over reported toxic workplace culture. The bulk of the suit focuses on &quot;violations of the state&#x27;s civil rights and equal pay laws,&quot; specifically regarding the treatment of women and other marginalized groups. To learn more about the proceedings thus far, including details listed in the lawsuit against Activision Blizzard, please check out our previous coverage here.

After weeks of public silence, Activision has responded to an ongoing strike at Raven Software. 
The ongoing Raven employee strike, which began after a dozen contract QA workers were let go in December, entered its third week this week with no formal acknowledgment from Activision. However, a new statement from upper Raven Software management (see: Activision management) given to GamesIndustry.biz reveals that the company is in active discussions with employees. 
For more about story, read Game Informer’s prior coverage of the Raven layoffs, including Activision’s statement following the transition of 500 contract employees to full-time.

                    <span>Konami is celebrating the 35th anniversary of its Castlevania series with a new “memorial NFT” collection. 
More specifically, the company is auctioning 14 NFTs, some of which are just static images, others which appear to be videos. You can, of course, view each right now on their website – no purchase required – but you won’t be able to see how much each is going for as the auctions won’t begin until January 12. 
“Konami Memorial NFT is a new initiative to share content that has been loved by players all over the world, for many years,” a press release reads. “As the company’s first project in this area and with NFTs and blockchains technology in its infancy, Konami will continue to explore new developments and listen to player feedback following this initial collection.”

                    <span>Horizon Forbidden West&#x27;s new west coast setting isn’t just inhabited by fearsome new machines. Aloy will also encounter tribes and cultures, some friends and some foes. Guerrilla Games released a video reintroducing players to familiar tribes such as the Oseram, Utaru, and Tenakth, giving a rundown of their culture and standing in this region of the country. 
We see the Utaru, a culture in tune with nature, singing songs in an effort to cure their land of the blight. On the flip side, the battle-hardened Tenakth, which is divided into three clans, serves as the dominant tribe in the Forbidden West. One of those clans is the Regalla, the rebel faction shown in previous trailers that are at war with their fellow clansfolk. As powerful as the Tenakth is, the trailer hints at rumors of an even stronger group residing on the outer reaches of the Forbidden West.

                    <span>As part of the various end-of-year Linux comparisons that I&#x27;ve made a habit of over the past 17 years, with the EOY 2021 benchmarking I was rather curious to see how Intel&#x27;s Clear Linux distribution has evolved Xeon Scalable &quot;Ice Lake&quot; performance since that platform launched in Q2&#x27;2021. It turns out there have been some terrific optimizations squeezed out of that latest-generation Xeon Scalable platform on Intel&#x27;s Clear Linux. In this article is a look at the Ubuntu and Clear Linux performance on the flagship Xeon Platinum 8380 2P reference server back around the time Ice Lake launched and then again using the latest software packages that closed out 2021.</span>

As such extra handling also needed to be introduced for the Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) that hadn&#x27;t made it for v5.16 but now it looks like the AMX KVM support may be ready for mainline...</span>

So here comes Pupperazzi, nailing the zeitgeist as a game specifically about taking photos of dogs - who, of course, you can also pet. It&#x27;s now just two weeks away from release, with a January 20th release date.

                    <span>I have a strange relationship with Dead Cells. I picked it up in 2019 and played it for a while, by which point I&#x27;d clearly had my fill. No DLCs to my name, nothing. I&#x27;d done a big run and put the game down.
Fast forward to now. Suddenly I own the latest expansion The Queen And The Sea, plus all the DLCs that came before it. I&#x27;m nonchalant, thinking that I dropped the game for a reason. Surely I can&#x27;t be won almost three years later? Well, nope. I was wrong. The DLCs have opened my eyes to the game in ways I hadn’t anticipated. The combat is crunchy, the challenge is thrilling, and Dead Cells more than holds its own next to more modern darlings of the genre like Hades.

Of course they are. Should&#x27;ve guessed. While publishers like Square Enix, EA, and Take-Two are still contemplating NFTs, I am not remotely surprised that Konami are one of the first notable names to actually start selling useless digital junk. Next week, they will hold an auction for NFTs of videos, artwork, and music from early Castlevania games. Konami, man.

                    <span>Studio director and co-founder of Playground Games, Gavin Raeburn, has revealed that he’s leaving the company. 
First reported by Windows Central, he has revealed that after co-founding and working at Playground for 12 years, he’s retiring from the racetrack. This news comes two months after the studio put out its most successful title yet in Forza Horizon 5, which at the time of its release, also had the biggest launch of any Xbox Game Studios game ever.

“After 12 years working on five award-winning Forza Horizon games, Gavin Raeburn is leaving Playground Games as studio director,” Turn 10 Studio Head and Forza franchise lead Alan Hartman told Windows Central. “A founding member of Playground Games, we thank Gav for his leadership and contributions to the Forza franchise and wish him all the best.” 
Hartman said another Playground co-founder, Trevor Williams, will transition from General Manager to Studio Head effective immediately, replacing Raeburn. He also said the studio will continue to focus on updates to Forza Horizon 5 and the ongoing development of its Fable reboot, which was officially announced in 2020. 
As noted by Windows Central, Raeburn has quite the history in the racing genre, having worked on Codemasters’ TOCA series, Dirt, and Grid. He left Codemasters in 2009 to create Playground Games, which was acquired by Microsoft in 2018. 
There’s no word on what’s next for Raeburn or if he’s even staying in games.

                    <span>Riot Games have pulled the curtains back on the newest agent joining Valorant and her name is Neon. 
Revealed by way of a special agent trailer, Neon is a fast-paced electric shooter that seemingly specializes in zooming all over a given map quicker than any other agent in the game. The short story trailer, which runs less than three minutes, reveals that Neon is a Manila, Philippines-based agent with an excellent taste in music.

As you can see in the trailer, Neon is a fan of Entertain Me by Ylona Garcia and 88rising. She’s also seemingly a fan of dreaming about what players are going to accomplish on the battlefield using her powers. We see her sprinting and sliding all over the maps shown in the trailer, using her electricity to make it easier. However, it doesn’t seem like she’ll be able to shoot while sprinting so don’t expect to be the run-n-gunner Neon might appear to be. 
We also get a quick look at one of her abilities where Neon lifts two large and long walls of electricity in a straight line, walls that she’s free to run in and out of. 
The trailer also reveals that Neon will arrive in Valorant with Episode 4: Disruption, although a release date for this new episode (which is what Valorant calls its big updates) has not yet been revealed. However, the current battle pass ends on January 11 so some fans have speculated that Episode 4 will begin the following day on January 12. 
While waiting to learn more, check out our thoughts on the shooter in Game Informer’s Valorant review and then read about how Valorant’s director is no longer working on the game and instead working on a new secret project at Riot. Be sure to read about how a mobile version of Valorant is on the way after that.

                    <span>Virtual reality hasn’t caught on as quickly as some predicted, but VR headsets have managed to amass an impressive collection of software in the last few years regardless. And given Sony&#x27;s recent PSVR2 announcements, this could be a big year for virtual reality. If you just bought a Meta Quest or haven’t fired yours up in a long time, there are several great experiences to be had. We highlight some of the best VR titles out now for the Quest, from high octane music games to spooky shooters. Here are 10 VR games you shouldn’t ignore, in no particular order.

                    <span>Arcade1Up, makers of affordable arcade cabinets built at a manageable size to put in your home, is broadening its product line to offer a larger, full-size machine for collectors who want a more true-to-arcade experience. 
The first in the line of Arcade1Up&#x27;s Pro Series cabinets features a handful of games, centered around Rare&#x27;s classic fighter, Killer Instinct. What makes the Pro Series stand apart from its contemporaries isn&#x27;t its slate of games, though; it&#x27;s the construction of the cabinet itself.
Arcade1Up&#x27;s traditional home arcade machines stand somewhere between 47&quot; and 57&quot; tall, depending on whether you have it sitting on the height-boosting riser. The Killer Instinct Pro Series cabinet measures in at 67.5&quot; tall (or 5ft 6in), almost a foot taller than the typical cab with a riser s…</span>

                    <span>Nobody Saves The World, the upcoming action RPG from Guacamelee developers Drinkbox Studios, has a release date and it’s less than two weeks away. 
More specifically, it will be released on January 18 and as previously announced, it will hit Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC via Windows 10 and Steam for $24.99. However, if you’re an Xbox Game Pass subscriber or a member of Microsoft’s PC Game Pass, the game will hit those services on day one, meaning you can download them for free.

Hopefully, you’ve got a friend lined up to play Nobody Saves The World with, too, because the game features online co-op, although it does not feature cross-play so you’ll need to be on the same platform as your friend to play together. 
In Nobody Saves The World, you control a “featureless nobody” that can transform into a variety of different animals and creatures, including a slug, a ghost, a dragon, a rat, a robot, and much more. You’ll need to swap between over 15 different forms with mixed and matched abilities to unlock and complete quests to progress through the game’s narrative. 
Speaking of abilities, Drinkbox says there are over 80 different Form abilities, meaning each player will likely have their own customized build that works best for them. You might play as an egg that leaves a trail of slime behind you or a rat that shoots fireballs – the choice is up to you. 
If you’re interested in the soundtrack, which was created by composer Jim Guthrie (Below, Sword and Sorcery), it will be available for purchase on Steam and other platforms when the game is released on January 18. 
Nobody Saves The World was announced back in March and it quickly gained traction as yet another exciting title from Drinkbox. For more, watch this New Gameplay Today segment about the game.

                    <span>Bomb Rush Cyberfunk, the upcoming Jet Set Radio-inspired game by the makers of Lethal League, is all about style. With that in mind, what’s cooler than hitting a bunch of sick tricks set to a fresh soundtrack? Not much based on this latest trailer. 
Although the video doesn’t update players on when Bomb Rush Cyberfunk will drop, it does provide a glimpse into some of the cool moves you can pull off. Whether you’re tearing up the city on a pair of skates, a bike, or a skateboard, executing stylish rail grinds and nailing combos is not only fun but vital to progression. The crux of the game is tagging enough spots with your graffiti and out-tricking other crews to earn enough reputation to challenge them for territory control. Mastering traversal also matters for reaching hidden areas of the city that may contain secrets.

If this modern homage has you chomping at the bit to play it, developer Team Reptile promises in the video&#x27;s description that it&#x27;s “going in hard” to get Bomb Rush Cyberfunk out the door this year. The game is slated to arrive on Switch and PC.

                    <span>Marvel’s Spider-Man on PlayStation 4 was a real treat and its remastered version on PlayStation 5 was even better. Despite how great it feels to play as Peter Parker in both versions, one thing neither version could do was really put you behind the Spider-Man mask. 
However, one player has come up with a unique way to give people a way to see what the game looks like through Peter Parker’s eyes: stop-motion.

As you can see in YouTube video above, creator ItIsSpid decided to take on a daunting task to show us what swinging through Insomniac Games’ New York City is like on PlayStation 5, both via Peter Paker and Miles Morales, and it looks amazing. We’re treated to a minute and 40 seconds of hundreds of first-person screenshots (courtesy of the games’ impressive photo modes) and we’ve never wanted a first-person Spider-Man game more. 
Of course, it takes a couple of seconds for your eyes to adjust to the stop-motion effect but when it sings, it looks great. 
“Using Spider-Man PS5/Miles Morales PS5 photo mode, I decided to try and combine 850+ photos and make a first-person gameplay stop-motion,” ItIsSpid’s YouTube description reads.

                    <span>The musou genre is a long-spanning one with dozens of entries in it, but despite that, it has remained relatively niche in the grand scheme of things. 
However, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild has helped buck that trend as Omega Force has revealed (on Twitter) that its Zelda musou, Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity, has shipped a whopping 4 million units since its release back in November of 2020. Of course, “shipped” is very different than “sold,” as this new statistic doesn’t necessarily indicate 4 million people have purchased the game, but manufacturers aren’t going to ship a game to storefronts when said storefronts have plenty in stock.

So while Age of Calamity hasn’t sold 4 million units, it has likely sold millions, which must be exciting for Omega Force. The team had to pull off quite the feat to make it a success, as creating a prequel to Breath of the Wild, one of the most celebrated games of all time, is no easy task. Omega Force even went a step further and created an expansion pass for Age of Calamity that furthered the prequel story by adding in controllable guardians, new weapons, and a rideable motorcycle to use in-game. These expansions also brought a new “Apocalyptic” difficulty to the musou as well as new challenges in the Royal Ancient Lab, new enemies, and more. 
For more about Age of Calamity, read this feature on why Omega Force made this musou a prequel in the first place, and then check out our thoughts on the game in Game Informer’s Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity review.

Henry says he&#x27;s onto &quot;new exciting adventures&quot; very soon, which is great. Still, his departure from the company&#x27;s Singapore studio serves as yet another loss for the Skull &amp; Bones team, which has seemingly struggled to make any headway since its 2017 reveal. 
Game Informer chronicled Skull &amp; Bones&#x27; journey through development hell recently in Part 1 of our Video Games Stuck In Development Hell series (here&#x27;s Part 2 and Part 3 if you&#x27;re curious for more). In short, this nautical game was last seen by the public in 2018 – we went hands-on with it that year. There was even a beta players w…</span>

                    <span>Ghost of Tsushima is an ode to the filmography of acclaimed Japanese director Akira Kurosawa. So, it&#x27;s only natural that Sucker Punch&#x27;s visually stunning action/adventure game would find the same success as the samurai flicks that inspired it. Ghost of Tsushima is as popular as ever, with 8 million copies sold. 
We&#x27;re thrilled and amazed that #GhostOfTsushima has officially sold more than 8 million copies!

A recent tweet (seen above) revealed the game&#x27;s newest milestone: &quot;We&#x27;re thrilled and amazed that Ghost of Tsushima has officially sold more than 8 million copies! Thank you so much to everyone who has played since launch! We are so incredibly appreciative and grateful for the support!&quot; 
It&#x27;s no surprise that Ghost of Tsushima had such a sizable player base. Cutting-edge graphics (somehow made more impressive with the PlayStation 5&#x27;s Director&#x27;s Cut), fluid combat mechanics with flashy animations, and a story/game world inundated in Japanese culture and samurai lore help set Ghost of Tsushima apart from its contemporaries. Game Informer&#x27;s Matt Miller loved the vanilla game, awarding it a 9.5. In his impression piece on the Director&#x27;s Cut, he echoed the same shining sentiments from his original review while speaking to the added content:
&quot;I was happily surprised by the breadth, depth, and challenge of the Iki Island expansion. For new players, it will extend an already lengthy adventure into something more. Meanwhile, returning players should be thrilled at how well this experience dovetails out of an already stellar game. Iki Island is what I want out of single-player game expansions. And it&#x27;s further proof (as if we needed any more at this point) that Sucker Punch has a standout new property to continue building on.&quot;
I&#x27;ve been playing through the Director&#x27;s Cut myself and am completely enamored with Ghost of Tsushima&#x27;s art direction and overall vibe. What are your thoughts on Sucker Punch&#x27;s latest IP? Let us know down below!</span>

If you’ve watched any of Sony Pictures Entertainment’s marketing for its upcoming Uncharted movie, then you’re likely aware that it has its own take on the infamous cargo plane scene from the third installment of the video game series. 
In one of the highlights of Uncharted 3: Drake’s Deception, protagonist Nathan Drake attempts to crawl from one cargo piece to the next, back to the safety of a plane. Things don’t end well for him as the plane comes to a fiery crash, leaving Drake stranded in a desert. Sony’s upcoming Uncharted movie, which stars Tom Holland as Drake and Mark Wahlberg as mentor and right-hand man Victor “Sully” Sullivan, features a very similar cinematic, and after being teased throughout multiple trailers, the full sequence has been r…</span>

                    <span>At its CES 2022 conference this evening, Sony discussed its upcoming VR headset and announced a new Horizon game for the device.
PlayStation President Jim Ryan took the stage to provide details on the company&#x27;s next-generation virtual-reality device. Following its tried and true naming scheme for gaming devices, the PSVR successor is officially called PlayStation VR2. Its controllers are no longer Move wands, but rather PlayStation VR2 Sense Controllers. Ryan spoke about the headset proving a greater sense of presence and increasing the visual fidelity from the previous model. 
Technical specifications of PSVR2 have been posted on the PlayStation Blog which reveals all kinds of cool tidbit about the headset and controllers. PSVR2 will feature OLED 2000x2040 resolution screens per eye which…</span>

It will be on Game Pass, too.

                    <span>Following a PlayStation debut in September, Death Stranding Director&#x27;s Cut is now confirmed to be headed to PC this spring. The expanded version of the Kojima Productions stumbling simulator whacks in new items, missions, and oddities, ranging from a robot you can ride to a racetrack. It&#x27;ll also be one of the few games to support Intel&#x27;s new XeSS upscaling fanciness.

S jeho pomocí může provozovatel stroje provést hardwarové odpálení určitých můstků, které fyzicky změní nastavení CPU tak, že bude fungovat už jen s daným strojem daného výrobce (přesněji řečeno bude svázán s konkrétním, výrobcem digitálně podepsaným firmwarem). Tedy například pokud by uživatel konkrétní desky Asus provedl z BIOSu přepálení můstků, bude procesor svázán s danou deskou (daným firmwarem) a nebude možné jej do budoucna použít například v desce Gigabyte.</span>

                    <span>Fortnite&#x27;s shop updates every day at 4 p.m. CT with new skins, emotes, and gliders to acquire, but the game map often changes without warning. That happened again today in a small way. If you explore slightly to the northeast of Logjam Lumberyard, you&#x27;ll find a new circular patch of dirt just beyond a hill. Investigating the scene reveals a large driller protected by IO guards at a landmark called Mole Team: Omega. That&#x27;s right, the Imagined Order (better known as IO) is back and it appears they drilled through the island.
Odds are we&#x27;ll see more IO troops on the island in the days and weeks ahead, likely culminating in a new story development. There&#x27;s a chance it could tie into The Foundation unlockables countdown, which currently sits at 30 days.
If you want to check out the drilling site, make sure you bring a weapon, as IO will open fire the second they see you. Look for a tent and you&#x27;ll find a large weapon cache. A launcher awaits on the far side of the dirt pile, so you should be able to make a quick getaway after getting the rare loot.
I can&#x27;t wait to see where Epic goes with this next. We&#x27;re still waiting for tornadoes and that strange six-legged purple monster to show up, but the arrival of IO is a nice surprise that should lead to a new antagonist showing up soon.</span>

                    <span>I’ve been pretty open about this recently, but a few years ago, there was a time when I was feeling overwhelmingly lonely. My days at work were mostly spent alone in a dark projection booth above a corporate auditorium. To spice up my evenings and force some human interaction on myself, I started playing Magic: The Gathering at a local game shop. I spent multiple days a week there, learning how to draft, build decks, and catch onto the lingo and language of the game. Slowly, I incorporated myself into the small group of regulars, and day by day, I felt less alone.
While shuffling decks and slinging spells against these new acquaintances, I noticed shared mannerisms and social archetypes people took on within my little corner of the Magic community. Let me tell you how pleasantly surprised …</span>

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been covering sports games for more than a decade now, and I&#x27;ve been playing them for nearly three times that long. Whenever I talk to anyone about the latest middling entry in Madden NFL or NBA 2K, the first question I always receive is, &quot;Should I buy this one if I already own last year&#x27;s?&quot; I used to have to think more about whether I&#x27;d recommend a sports gamer pick up the latest iteration, but over the last several years, the games have felt just that way: iterative. Now, my answer is always, &quot;How important is [this year&#x27;s tentpole feature] to you? How important is having the latest rosters?&quot; If even one of those is wishy-washy, my answer is either &quot;Wait for a sale&quot; or &quot;Just play last year&#x27;s game.&quot; This song and dance has only become more noticeable as the years have continued.

                    <span>Microsoft has revealed a collaboration between Xbox and nail polish brand OPI and, as expected, each color is themed after something to do with Xbox. 
While the nail polishes and the colors they come in look quite nice, there’s another interesting aspect to this collaboration. Purchasing the Xbox-inspired Spring 2022 OPI Collection gets you exclusive in-game Halo Infinite and Forza Horizon 5 content. Ride or shoot in style with the best-looking nails your controller has ever seen. 
As for the in-game content, the Xbox Wire blog post revealing this collaboration doesn’t exactly spell out what it is, but some pictures reveal that the collection gets you a Halo Infinite armor coating and what appears to be a skin for a car in Forza Horizon 5 (although it could be straight up an entire car).

CES is an annual technology-focused conference where all kinds of electronics companies announce new products both for the mass market and for those more interested in experimental ideas. It’s where Samsung announced its new line of 2022 TVs that will feature Stadia, Nvidia GeForce Now, and NFT support and integration, and it’s also where Nvidia, AMD, and Intel pulled back the curtains on some heavily-rumored GPUs.

                    <span>Halo Infinite&#x27;s shop updates every Tuesday at 10 a.m. PT with new items that players can purchase with credits. Since the launch of the free-to-play multiplayer component, 343 Industries has done a nice job of offering up colorful items for players to purchase. The latest rotation doesn&#x27;t have much other than one cool item that ties into the return of the Fracture: Tenrai event.
The expensive item of the week is a 2,000 credit ($17.99) legendary mythic effect set called Enlightened Path, which adds pink rose petals to your Spartan&#x27;s footsteps, slides, and spawns. Also included in this bundle is a white mask called Grand Play that can be applied to your nameplate, armor, vehicles, and weapons. I have to point out that the price for this bundle is ridiculous, especially since the player usually gets an armor set at this rate.
The more interesting offering this week is the Meditative State bundle, with the standout piece being the Imperial Crest helmet attachment for the Yoroi armor core earned in the Fracture: Tenrai event. This set also offers a cool coloring option called Expressive Soul which adds samurai-like highlights to the armor in gold and green. The bundle is rounded out with a triumphant stance called Mirror Tale, and an epic charm called Black Opal. This pack is 1,000 credits.
If you want to focus on your weapons and pick up another high-priced bundle, the Blacksteel Katana set is rather striking, adding a dragon scale effect to the MA40 assault rifle. You also get Black Cat weapon coloring, a Tiger Energy charm, and a Sun and Shadow icon to apply to weapons, vehicles, and more.
The item of the day is the Desert Sun bundle, offering the Ryuu visor for the Yoroi armor, and a dull green armor coating called Forgotten Sands.
All told, this week&#x27;s offerings rank among the game&#x27;s worst to date. The good news, though, is Fracture: Tenrai is back and we can keep working on that battle pass.</span>

                    <span>If you’re an Apex Legends fan that’s been wanting more out of the game’s lore, Respawn has released a new installment in its Stories from the Outlands series centered on fan-favorite Bangalore. 
For those new to Stories from the Outlands, the series expands on the game’s lore by shining a narrative spotlight on its roster of Legends. Think of them as Respawn’s take on Blizzard’s Overwatch shorts. Gridiron sees Bangalore get torn between her responsibilities as a soldier and the relationship with her brother after the Battle of Gridiron. Clocking in at over eight minutes, the well-animated cinematic is a neat way of fleshing out of the game’s original favorites.

It’s being published by 505 Games, the same publishing arm that published the original version of Death Stranding on PC last July, and will be released simultaneously on Steam and the Epic Game Store. This news was announced during Intel’s showcase during the ongoing Consumer Electronics Show today and Kojima Production’s latest game will take advantage of Intel’s XeSS supersampling technology. 
Released last September as a PlayStation 5 exclusive, the Director’s Cut features everything contained in the original version of Death Stranding, which first hit PlayStation 4 exclusively in 2019 before it hit PC in 2020, as well as graphical and performance-related improvements, new mechanics, and new …</span>

                    <span>Steam has existed in a grey area in China, technically not following rules which require all games be approved yet never drawing the ire of authorities. Many have long expected it to eventually be banned, though, especially after Valve partnered with Perfect World to launch the limited Steam China. This might now be happening. Maybe. Or it&#x27;s possibly being hindered, at least. This all started with a big stink on Christmas Day that led some to declare Steam had been banned by the Great Firewall which restricts access to many sites outside China, but the reality is not so clear cut.

                    <span>The vanguard of Intel’s 12th Gen Alder Lake CPUs had some seriously good chips in it – including two of the best CPUs for gaming overall – though there weren’t many models for aspiring PC builders on tight budgets. Now, though, Intel has used CES 2022 to launch the rest of the 12th Gen desktop lineup, adding loads of more affordable Core i5 and Core i3 processors on top of new Core i7 and Core i9 options. Intel also unveiled its new H-series, 12th Gen gaming laptop chips, which use the same hybrid architecture (combining powerful P-cores with smaller, less energy-intensive E-cores) as their Alder Lake desktop cousins.

The high: the GeForce RTX 3090 Ti, as new top-of-the-line CPU with 24GB of upgraded, 21Gbit/s GDDR6X VRAM. The low: the GeForce RTX 3050, Nvidia’s first XX50 GPU in a donkey’s age.

                    <span>It’s the first week of 2022 and that means – yes! – all the big PC hardware movers and shakers are hosting their CES 2022 events. On the same day. Within a couple of hours of each other. But my stress is your gain, as there are and will be some major announcements on new kit, starting with AMD. Their freshly-announced hardware includes an assortment of new CPUs, desktop and mobile graphics cards and even some laptop APUs – APUs that sound a lot more useful for gaming that what current integrated graphics can offer. There’s even an Nvidia Image Scaling rival in the upcoming, driver-level Radeon Super Resolution feature.

                    <span>Nightingale certainly isn&#x27;t the sort of game I was expecting from a former BioWare developer, but I&#x27;m well excited to give it a go. Announced at The Game Awards 2021, Nightingale is a survival craft &#x27;em up set in a fantastical, alt-history world. It&#x27;s being made by Inflexion Games, a studio lead by Aaryn Flynn, former programmer and general manager at the Dragon Age and Mass Effect developers. 
But don&#x27;t go in expecting the sort of huge, arcing plotlines of BioWare&#x27;s recent games. While Nightingale will have an over-arching narrative, it&#x27;s being designed to offer up adventures that let you make your own stories. I spoke to Flynn at the end of last year to find out a little bit more about what that entails.

Money will go to current and former female employees and contract workers. The suit started in 2018 following widespread allegations of a festering workplace culture, and was originally due to be settled for $10 million (£7m) until California state authorities raised objections that it wasn&#x27;t enough.

                    <span>Vánoční svátky jsou za námi a mnoho z vás jistě dostalo elektrotechnické dárky, kterými se chcete před ostatními pochlubit. Nebo jste za Vánoce stihli něco sami vytvořit – nám se povedlo ubastlit třeba váhu na RC modely. Ať už tak nebo tak, o všem si můžete popovídat na Virtuální Bastlírně – online setkání elektroniků a bastlířů!</span>

Oproti předchozí verzi 2020 přináší větší možnosti práce s oknem rychlého náhledu (panning při zoomu pomocí tlačítka na kolečku myši), nový režim náhledu (uvnitř panoramatické koule) či aktualizovaný build systém pro OpenEXR3.</span>

                    <span>The first rule of video game club (apart from not talking about video game club) usually involves saving the world somehow. We do our best to rescue others from harm, to avert world-ending disasters, and give everyone around us the happy ending they deserve. But if there&#x27;s one thing I&#x27;ve learned about myself in 2021, it&#x27;s that I&#x27;m a cruel, heartless robot who will happily toss others under the bus if they don&#x27;t provide any material benefit to me. Or at least I am when I&#x27;m playing Unsighted, the gorgeous and criminally underrated action RPG from Studio Pixel Punk that puts a ticking time-bomb inside each of its characters&#x27; metallic chests which, if left unchecked, will remove them from the game entirely, preventing you from gaining some potentially very handy upgrades to help you in your quest to fight back against your human oppressors. 
It&#x27;s an ingenious system, as you&#x27;re not only fighting against the hordes of enemies that appear onscreen, but your own ineptitude.

                    <span>If you&#x27;re anything like me, when you start a game you will almost invariably try to run off into the woods or swamp and aggressively ignore anything even passably resembling a main story. After hours of feeling like a brave rebel by doing this in Vagrus - The Riven Realms, I realised it&#x27;s how you&#x27;re supposed to play it. This is not a game about some Epic Quest or grand campaign. It&#x27;s a game about running a caravan in a world that just happens to have a cool history.

                    <span>Projekt LibreOffice oznámil na svých mailing listech program přednášek na konferenci Fosdem. Tentokrát se koná pod hlavičkou LibreOffice Technology – LibreOffice Technology devroom. V minulosti se místnost konala pod názvem Open Document Editors (společně s Apache). Konference Fosdem se koná 5. a 6. února 2022 a je opět online. Přednášky LibreOffice jsou plánovány na oba dny.</span>

                    <span>Rok 2022 nezačal vůbec dobře pro všechny MS Exchange adminy. Ti musejí řešit chybu v on-premise instalacích serveru Microsoft Exchange, konkrétněji v komponentě Anti-Malware scanneru. Chyba spočívá v chybném datovém typu pro ukládání data, kdy vývojáři zvolili pro ukládání 32bitový signed integer a hodnota 2201010001 způsobí přetečení a následné nedoručení zprávy. Řešením je vypnout skenování zpráv, dokud nebude k dispozici oprava.</span>

                    <span>2021 was hot boy summer for detectives. Well, not summer. Hot boy autumn? Is that a thing? Anyway, I not only played Sherlock Holmes Chapter One, but also an incarnation of Hercule Poirot as a bright young thing in Agatha Christie - Hercule Poirot: The First Cases. And yes, that name is a bit of a nightmare, but the game itself is very sweet. There&#x27;s &#x27;orrible murder, conspiracy, blackmail, union busting, and a cast of Cluedo-esque characters trapped inside a snowy manor. And yes, I am reusing the shoddy Love Island promo photo composite I made for a header picture, because it deserves the mileage.

                    <span>Ghost Time Games’ Tux And Fanny, from co-developers Albert Birney and Gabriel Koenig, is not only the game I think you may have missed this year, but it is also my Game Of The Year for 2021. This game sends two best friends (alongside a courageous flea and a mischievous cat) through adventures great, small, and absurd to stunning effect – and you owe it to yourself to give this little marvel a play before the year is well and truly out.

                    <span>Kritická zranitelnost logovacího frameworku Log4j byla objevena začátkem prosince a od té doby se objevilo několik dalších zranitelností. Pro zjednodušení detekce zranitelností v rozsáhlých projektech vznikl Log4jDetect používající programovací jazyk Go. Stačí programu předložit adresář s projektem, který bude prohledán. Podporovány jsou balíčkovače gradle, maven a bundle.  K tomu budou prohledány soubory .jar a .gem. Log4jDetect funguje na Linuxu, macOS i Windows.</span>

Jádro zde doposud používá funkci SHA1, která již několik let není považována za bezpečnou. Navíc ji používá nestandardním způsobem, takže dopředná bezpečnost (forward secrecy) je jen 280.  K tomu ještě se IV (initialization vector) přepisuje z instrukcí procesoru RDRAND a to i když je nastaveno nevěřit instrukci RDRAND.</span>

                    <span>It’s pretty difficult to quantify which games actually whip ass, mostly because it’s a little subjective. That being said, if barrelling through the streets of a futuristic, neon-glazed Detroit, hopping over pursuing cop cars and racing through business offices and factories to the tune of an engrossing soundtrack doesn’t whip ass, I don’t know what does.

                    <span>Immersive sims are tricky games to get right. The spaces need to have incredibly tight design so they feel fun to explore, and lots of ways to get around them. And one of the best games of the year just happens to be one that does that expertly. Hang on, Deathloop? What are you talking about? No, no, the real best immersive sim this year is co-open by lowpolis, obviously!

                    <span>Diablo has, for good reasons, become a shorthand for describing the flavour of gothic, grimdark fantasy setting in games, where pus-filled demonic hordes and rotting, undead corpses scour a hellish cathedral looking for unwitting adventurers. For all its wretched decay, however, the series still feels like an indulgence to be savoured. Its clickiness and abhorrent sights make the games endlessly gratifying, and masterful butchery of fiends eases most players into a comfortable rhythm. And part of that appeal lies in the macabre yet captivating fantasy it so deftly peddles — all that blood, gore and guts really make for a grisly setting that’s nearly impossible to look away from.


Tainted Grail: Conquest conveys the same sense of blight and doom in its dark fantasy universe — one that’s a reimagining of Arthurian legends — but also ups the ante with a huge wallop of Slay The Spire’s roguelike, deck-building elements.

                    <span>As a child struggling to sleep at night I&#x27;d dream of three worlds. First and least of these was Desert World, a blithe eternity of golden sand always viewed from kilometres up, where fizzing white rings rose toward me like expanding surf. I&#x27;d try to find my way down to the surface, but always at the risk of glitching straight through and ending up in Snake World, where monstrous serpents emerged from darkened kitchens.


Somewhere between these two poles lay the realm of the Animals, not that they were really animals, but clouds of eyelash-thin mandible, grot and sparkle, like rotten food on the point of becoming a school of tropical fish. I loved Animal World. I used to spend hours trying to mind-hack my way into it. I was pretty shocked to find its likeness in Sluggish Morss: Pattern Circus - an irresistibly strange, gristly, sorrowful, comical and inventive album of creatures, songs, places and phrases from Jack King-Spooner and composer Helena Celle.

                    <span>It’s hard to imagine a collaboration between Zero Escape and Danganronpa creators Kotaro Uchikoshi and Kazutaka Kodaka going under the radar, but an odd release schedule (involving dropping a half-finished experience on Apple Arcade) saw interest in the collaboration buried by the time the game hit PC last month. Which is a shame, since it’s a rather unique title in their respective careers, and it charts new waters for these cult directors.


World’s End Club was the first game the pair released since forming their own studio, Too Kyo Games, and can best be described as a bizarre but intriguing blend of platforming and death games, starring a cast of prepubescent children way too young to be fixing the world or dealing with cults. Think Danganronpa, if Danganronpa was a Saturday morning cartoon rather than a murder game filled with psychopaths.

                    <span>If you like your RPG adventures to contain dungeons and dragons, and be as complex as Dungeons &amp; Dragons, perhaps you might fancy the latest game being given away free in the Epic Games Store&#x27;s festive sale. For 24 hours, Epic are handing out Pathfinder: Kingmaker free for keepsies. It&#x27;s a vast fantasy RPG based on the Pathfinder pen &#x27;n&#x27; paper system, played out in ye olde isometric perspective. The sort of RPG that&#x27;s fascinating to some, offputting to others—so a great candidate for a freebie.

Watching &#x27;til that morning comes creeping
Green Door, what&#x27;s that secret your keeping?
Jim Lowe&#x27;s Green Door might not be a Christmas song, but it sure can feel like one—especially inside the festive action of Dracula Cha Cha. That&#x27;s right, it&#x27;s Christmas Eve, which means one more night without sleeping, and time to play Dracula Cha Cha.

They&#x27;re named Takaya Kuroda &amp; Goodfellas and they have a Christmas song out. Not only is this excellent news, I can&#x27;t get over the fact it straight up sounds like Kiryu delivering some festive cheer. So get comfy, bang this on, and let Kiryu&#x27;s warm tones wash over you like mulled wine.

                    <span>Right now Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker is so popular you can’t buy it anymore. To prevent overcrowding and crashing servers, Square Enix have had to halt free trials and new sales to keep the game stable after an unprecedented surge in popularity this summer. Between that and the global shortage of materials to add more servers, it may be quite some time until new players are able to experience it. If you have an active subscription and manage to brave the long queues however, you’re one of the lucky few who get to experience something truly special. For everyone else: hang in there, it will be worth the wait.

                    <span>MERRY CHRISTMAS YA FILTHY ANIMALS! This time of year can be one that feels particularly apocalyptic, as well as, you know, good will to all I guess. If I have to. The indie games I&#x27;ve been playing recently all have a bit of an end-of-the-world flavour to &#x27;em, whether literal or metaphorical or by your own hand, if you feel like it. I dunno, I actually found them strangely relaxing, as a sort of counterpoint to the chaos of my own life during the holiday season. See what you think.

                    <span>The latest free game giveaway in GOG&#x27;s winter sale is an unexpected one for the festive season, but perhaps a game which captures the feeling of being trapped at a seemingly endless Christmas lunch with awful relatives: I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream. Nothing says &#x27;bad family Christmas&#x27; like being tortured for 109 years by a sentient supercomputer which nuked humanity and keeps only five people alive to torment. The 90s point &#x27;n&#x27; click adventure game is a grim one (so grim!), but one which does have its fans.

                    <span>In a special Christmas message from three of the NieR series&#x27; development stars, creative director Yoko Taro has announced that NieR is over. No more NieR games for us... unless he receives a massive pile of money. Quickly, it becomes clear he&#x27;s just joshing around. Another classic ruse from the man in the Emil mask, and a subtle hint that they may have something new in the works. Plus, it&#x27;s just a really delightful video and you should all watch it.

                    <span>Though I hardly remember the Steam Autumn Sale ending, the Steam Winter Sale started yesterday, bringing squillions more cheap video games. If you&#x27;re staring baffled at an endless list of innumerable deals, you could use some help. Honestly, most of our Steam Autumn Sale recommendations still stand, but the few of us in the RPS treehouse who haven&#x27;t already clocked off for the Christmas holiday do have some fresh picks for you too.

                    <span>We&#x27;re nearing the end of the year and my brain&#x27;s battery is flashing red. There&#x27;s some Christmassy-ness flowing in to tide me over, thanks to the mini-Christmas tree in my room. Every year it&#x27;s popped on the wardrobe alongside an honorary Lynx Africa. They share the same festive colours, after all.
Having pondered my tree for a bit, I thought about trees in games and how they make for good side quests. Now join me by the bark, as I examine why this might be the case in a roundabout manner.

                    <span>When I was younger I watched a nature documentary narrated by David Attenborough (I realise that doesn&#x27;t narrow it down) and in this nature documentary David told me about a cave. It is a very big cave, and every night a huge colony of bats come screaming out of the entrance. They spend the day clinging to the ceiling of this big cave, and all their bat poo falls down and has become a towering heap carpeting the floor.
But then David said look, the carpet is moving. And it turns out that the whole bottom of the cave is covered in cockroaches and giant centipedes. And if ever a small baby bat or an old injured bat falls, it is eaten alive by this hoard of chittering insects. This nature documentary haunted me, for it was the worst thing I could imagine happening.
Anyway, Nate has been to that cave and he&#x27;s going to tell us all about it for this episode of our supporters only podcast, The Nate Files. Thanks for being a supporter, pals!

                    <span>It&#x27;s been a busy, kind of mixed year for strategy games. Ever a broad church, 2021&#x27;s seen enough releases to keep ten of me busy, from the easy-going Legion War to the month-consuming Shadow Empire. I don&#x27;t know about you, but my personal &quot;to play&quot; list is out of control.
And yet, while we&#x27;ve had plenty to enjoy this year, it&#x27;s felt like a period of build-up to something bigger. I&#x27;m not one for looking forward. If a game&#x27;s not out yet it tends to disappear from my mind, making room for a hundred other recent releases in this age of plenty. That I&#x27;ve less interest in looking back over this year than I do pondering the next suggests that maybe we&#x27;re in for something special in the coming twelve months. Or perhaps it&#x27;s just been a rough one and I&#x27;m very sleep deprived and don&#x27;t want to think about 2021. Either way, let&#x27;s have a look at what&#x27;s in store for strategy fans in 2022, yeah?

Among these are Perfect World, the publishers of Star Trek Online and Torchlight, and the studio behind Scribblenauts Showdown, Shiver Entertainment. They&#x27;re also going transmedia, buying comics and TV company Dark Horse as well as an animation company and a video-on-demand network. Now they just need to get into food and housing, then our dystopian dreams of one corp owning our entire lives can come true.

                    <span>A recent round of BIOS updates for Dell and Alienware systems has turned out to be something of a bad batch. As first spotted by Bleeding Computer, multiple owners of Dell-made PCs – including the Alienware Aurora R8 and Inspiron 5680 gaming desktops, as well as the Latitude 5320 and 5520 business laptops – started developing big problems after installing the new BIOS versions. Failed boots, mainly, which of course makes it harder to apply potential fixes.

                    <span>Everyone knows there are two conditions that must be met before Christmas can officially begin. The first is playing Skeal. The second is the arrival of Steam&#x27;s Winter Sale. Blissfully, we can now tick both of these objectives off our to-do list, as Valve have finally unleashed their flurry of seasonal deals. Between now and January 5th, thousands of games will be discounted across Steam, and you&#x27;ll also be able to claim a free sticker every day as well, for those of you who enjoy that sort of thing.

                    <span>As that age-old saying goes, all good things must come to an end. As we prepare to put a full stop on the year and see out 2021 from our cocoon of Christmas chocolate wrappers, we must also sadly bid farewell to our news writer Imogen Beckhelling, who is heading off for a new adventure in the games industry in the New Year. Today is Imogen&#x27;s last day at RPS, so come and say goodbye.

                    <span>It struck me recently that I’ve not played as much of Halo Infinite’s multiplayer as I thought I would. I envisaged myself wiling away most evenings with my mates, playing Oddball and Slayer and laughing like someone from those video game adverts, swaying violently with a controller in hand.
I now know the reason why and I hate to admit it. Infinite doesn’t have a battle royale mode, which I&#x27;ve come to realise is the perfect FPS template for gaming with my mates. Something about it just works, you know? Listen, let me explain.

                    <span>I know almost nothing about Alfred Hitchcock. He’s the kind of archetypal director whose work I’ve been exposed to in bits and pieces without ever actually sitting down to watch one of his films in full. All of that is to say that, upon starting Alfred Hitchcock - Vertigo the game, I was in no position to judge whether it was a faithful adaptation of the film or to recognize all but the most obvious illusions to Hitchcock’s body of work (look, birds!). That’s okay, though, because as it turns out, Vertigo is an original story based on a collage of Hitchcockian concepts, not a direct adaption of the 1958 film by the same name.
Vertigo the game follows author Ed Miller as he grapples with a debilitating case of vertigo–a condition that leaves him unable to stand as the world appears to spin around him–and paralyzing guilt over the death of his daughter and her mother, Faye, after their car falls off a bridge into a ravine below. With Ed bed ridden, it’s up to Dr. Julia Lomas, psychologist and psychiatrist, and Sheriff Nick Reyes to unravel the mystery of what really happened, and whether Faye and his daughter even exist. My thoughts on how Vertigo goes about telling this story are... complicated.

                    <span>Final Fantasy XIV players haven’t had it easy these last few weeks. The sheer success of its Endwalker expansion resulted in lengthy login queues and server errors. It’s become so popular that Square Enix have temporarily stopped selling the game, taking its Starter and Complete Editions off sale. All the while, some low-poly grapes stayed static in the breeze. Jagged, delicious, minding their own business. Until their blockiness was papped and thrust into the public eye. Memes ensued and the grapes became the talk of the town, so much so that they’ve been smoothed out in the latest patch, much to everyone’s dismay.

                    <span>Gather round, readers, and I&#x27;ll tell you the tale of the time I opened the 22nd door on the RPS Advent Calendar. I was with three friends, and we&#x27;d been adventuring together for years at this point - two of us were lovers, and yet a third had made a strange pact with a wolf God. We could do anything together, we four. And then we stumbled upon this door...

                    <span>Book Of Travels is what developers Might And Delight call a TMORPG - a &quot;tiny&quot; multiplayer online role playing game, as opposed to a &quot;massive&quot; one. It&#x27;s a gorgeous-looking adventure that came out in early access back in October, but unfortunately the launch didn&#x27;t go as well as the devs had hoped it would. Yesterday, they announced that they&#x27;ve had to lay off around 25 employees to keep the studio going. They add that development will continue, albeit at an understandably slower pace.

                    <span>Hello folks. It&#x27;s been a funny old year, 2021. On the games side, it&#x27;s often felt like a year of shifting goalposts. Games that were delayed by the pandemic last year finally got their due in 2021, but in turn many of the releases we were expecting this year have inevitably slipped into 2022. The pandemic has affected games of all sizes this year, and I don&#x27;t think it will go down in the history books as one of our all-time greats. There were still plenty of fantastic games that came out this year, mind, and we&#x27;re still counting down our absolute favourites over in our Advent Calendar. 
That said, I do think 2021 will prove to be a pivotal year for RPS - and not just because I stole Graham&#x27;s key card and changed the locks on the front door of the Treehouse. It&#x27;s been a year of immense change here at the site, so I wanted to take some time to reflect on everything that&#x27;s happened this year, and look forward to what we&#x27;ve got in store for 2022.

                    <span>If you simply can&#x27;t get enough of raccoon detectives sleuthing around dystopian Vancouver, then you&#x27;re in luck, because more is on the way. Developers EggNut have announced that a new Backbone game is coming in 2022, dropping us back into the snowy, animal-filled city. We don&#x27;t know much about it yet, but Backbone is an excellent detective puzzle game, and a gorgeous one at that, so I have high hopes for the next one.

The devs have another freebie for those folks too now - you can claim a free copy of GTA V: Premium Edition, GTA IV: Complete Edition, LA Noire, Bully: Scholarship Edition, or Max Payne 3 over the holiday period. Ah, free festive violence.

Modders have been hard at work weaving nice dresses with their virtual looms at a rate of knots. Oh, and they’ve morphed characters into Buster Swords and produced some other equally useful things too. Let&#x27;s have a gander at some of their most interesting creations.

                    <span>Update: Loop Hero&#x27;s time is done! The dino-battling FPS Second Extinction is the new freebie. 
Original Story: This year had us stuck in many video game time loops, but one of my absolute favourites was Loop Hero. I never thought an autobattler RPG would hook me the way it did, but I spent hours upon hours helping a little knight circle a seemingly endless void, and had a wonderful time doing it. If you didn&#x27;t have a chance to play it earlier this year, it&#x27;s now free on the Epic Game Store until tomorrow. I heartily encourage you to pick this one up, it&#x27;s one of our favourite games of 2021.

                    <span>The great thing about traditions is: you can just make them up. While some traditions feel more real because they&#x27;re embedded deeper in our culture, you can start your own whenever you want, and jettison any you don&#x27;t care for. Anything can be imbued with special meaning and, over time, grow into a tradition you cherish and come to anticipate. So here I am, approaching Christmas, so ready for my annual play of Skeal. Join me, reader dear.

                    <span>There’s no single, solitary reason why it’s been so hard to buy certain PC components over the past year and a bit – it’s more like a perfect storm of multiple circumstances, unfortunate coincidences and unforseen annoyances. That said, one of the biggest underlying causes of MIA CPU and graphics card stock has been a shortage of the chips needed to make them, and it’s a shortage that Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger has warned could likely continue into 2023.

                    <span>Oslain Brante tried to be a decent guy. Kind to his relatives except the one who murdered him. Resolutely loyal to his friends, even dying for one. Willing to die once again rather than betray his revolutionary allies. But it just kept going wrong for reasons that felt utterly artificial and sometimes deeply dissatisfying.
I&#x27;d have given up on the game if it weren&#x27;t so interesting. For one thing, none of those deaths were final. He died as a child and came back. He died as a teenager and came back. These were not saved games, but ordinary occurrences. It&#x27;s an interesting world made infuriating by awkward design choices.

                    <span>A new Cyberpunk 2077 mod makes the dystopian RPG&#x27;s decorative monorails functional, adding a metro system with cute wee trains you can ride. For all the game&#x27;s flaws, I did greatly enjoy wondering Night City&#x27;s streets, cooing at giant buildings and bright colours, and today I was glad to continue that tourism on rail. How lovely to see the megacity from a new perspective, looking down on rooftops and being buzzed by hovercars. See a wee bit of my journey in a video below.

                    <span>I’m rubbish at the building component of Minecraft; it’s much easier to simply download a map and wander around in the splendour of someone else’s creation. And if you’ve got the ray tracing beta version of Minecraft for Windows installed, I can heartily recommend you too take a wander through the Nvidia RTX Winter World: a vast, Christmassy and very, very pretty custom map that has you helping Santa throw a festive shindig while you trade sweets with his elves.

The awards which celebrate literary works in the science-fiction and fantasy genres, added a special one-off &#x27;Best Video Game&#x27; category this year, which is where old Zagreus picked up his accolade. Our short king&#x27;s battle out of the underworld beat out its closest competition, cosy escapism simulator, Animal Crossing: New Horizons in the polls by almost fourfold.

Superliminal has added co-op, letting four of you jump into the world-bending puzzler together. The update dropped on Friday, and it seems that even your pals aren&#x27;t safe from the game&#x27;s forced perspective. They&#x27;ll appear in the world as little chess pieces, and from the looks of things you can pick them up to use as puzzle solving items.

A combination of competitive pricing, more user-friendly devices, and more fleshed-out VR games like Half-Life Alyx has seen headsets push deeper into the mainstream within the last 12 to 24 months.
