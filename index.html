                              <span>Summer Game Fest 2024 played host to Bumhouse Games&#x27; reveal for the initial slate of titles it&#x27;ll be bringing to market from several developers around the industry, spanning a slew of genres and even including Sam Barlow&#x27;s next title. 


Blumhouse Games was established last year and announced plans to bring horror titles to major platforms without having much to show off. During Summer Game Fest 2024, we got a look at everything it&#x27;s planning to publish, and every title looks unique. The most interesting thing about them all is that they don&#x27;t look like Dead Space or The Callisto Protocol. They&#x27;re not AAA titles. They&#x27;re all indie games with a distinct look and feel that makes them stand out. 


Blumhouse Games outlines its initial run of horror games from indie developers, including Sam Barlow&#x27;s Project C




The section on Blumhouse Games begins at roughly 1:15:00 in the Summer Game Fest 2024 video above. In it, you&#x27;ll see short clips of every game the publisher is launching soon. I&#x27;ve listed all of them alongside their developers below. 



Crisol: theatre of Idols: Vermila Studios


Grave Seasons: Perfect Garbage


Sleep Awake: Eyes Out


Fear the Spotlight: Cozy Game Pals


The Simulation: Plamestudio


Project C: Half Mermaid

                              <span>The Summer Game Fest 2024 revealed a horrific gameplay trailer for Slitterhead. We also got the inside scoop on its release date, set for November 8, 2024.


Slitterhead&#x27;s gameplay trailer unveiled a plethora of grotesque monsters. Then, it showcases the playable characters, taking them down one by one. One move, in particular, involves a claw-like attack that brutally slices up the creatures. 




Another playable character is shown in the trailer, but this time with a shotgun weapon. There seem to be a few fighters you can wield with this entry, each with their own robust power. You can even teleport to other locations to make a quick getaway from the monsters. 


Be sure to tune into Slitterhead&#x27;s release on Nov. 8, 2024, on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Steam, and the Epic Games Store. If you&#x27;re a Silent Hill fan, you should definitely give this one a try for a brand-new horror experience.

                              <span>Among the entries making their world premieres at Summer Game Fest 2024, Deer &amp; Boy is ready to send us on quite the journey. Made by first-time developer Jason Houdei and his team, the game introduces us to its beautiful world, which is already preparing us for a story filled with hope and heartbreak.


Throughout the trailer, we see the protagonist and his young deer companion embark on a journey through the world as they navigate various obstacles, discover the beauty of nature, and lay their eyes on some rather horrifying supernatural creatures.


Not much else was revealed in the Summer Game Fest&#x27;s announcement, but one thing is certain: We&#x27;re in for quite the ride, and I could not be more intrigued by what lies in store.


Dear &amp; Boy is available to wishlist now on PC via Steam. No release date is currently known.

                              <span>Digitial Eclipse unveiled the next game in the Hasbro Retro Arcade as Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Rita&#x27;s Rewind and it looks like a ton of fun. Coming in late 2024, Rita&#x27;s Rewind is an all-new adventure with an original Power Rangers storyline that mixes franchise lore with retro gameplay.




In Rita&#x27;s Rewind, players face off against a robotic reincarnation of the Power Rangers&#x27; long time nemesis. Robo-Rita conjures a portal to send herself back in time to stop the Power Rangers by forming an alliance with her younger self. Together, Robo-Rita and Rita Repulsa will rewind, rewrite, and remix the past in attempt to stop the Power Rangers once and for all.


It looks like classic arcadey Power Rangers beat-em-up and I&#x27;m all for it.


Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Rita&#x27;s Rewind is coming to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam in Late 2024.

                              <span>One of my most anticipated games coming this year is Hollywood Animal. It has you run an up-and-coming movie studio, submerges you into a pool of complicated and morally bereft staff, and allows you to deal with problems using underhanded methods. Just like real life (maybe).


The only thing that keeps me from claiming Hollywood Animal as my most anticipated game is that it seems like it might be attempting too much. There are so many variables at play and so much customization that it feels it would be complicated to ensure everything works together without a litany of bugs, cuts, and feature creep.


If the rather hefty demo shows anything; Weappy Wholesome has managed to do it.

It&#x27;s a 90s-ass side-scrolling arcade brawler for up to five players, involves &quot;time twisting&quot;, and has mode-7-style arcade shooter bits together with the original TV show&#x27;s climatic mecha transformation sequences.

                              <span>A French game about mountain climbing? No, not that one. This is Cairn, not Jusant, and it’s actually a very different beast. Jusant could be tricky, but climbing was more the way you experienced its story. In survival climber Cairn, the ascent is the story. It seem to mainly be a story about how bad you are at climbing.

                              <span>Summer Game Fest 2024 gave us the first look at the new Power Rangers game, and it’s looking like a blast from the past.
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Rita’s Rewind comes to us via studio Digital Eclipse, and the project appears to be a sidescrolling brawler beat-‘em-up at its heart, with multiple players working together to beat up baddies as they move right across the screen, echoing other favorites of the genre like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles or X-Men. But the game also appears to feature other vehicle sequences, including what looks like first-person Zord punching sequences.
The game features online and offline co-op for up to five players.
If you’re looking to pull on your preferred colored ranger suit, you can watch for release on PC and consoles later in 2024.</span>

                              <span>Silent Hill creator Keiichiro Toyama founded Bokeh Game Studio back in 2020 to work on a new horror game that we later learned is called Slitterhead. After a teaser trailer and a behind-the-scenes look at the game&#x27;s development, we finally have our first look at gameplay. Plus, the studio announced Slitterhead launches on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC on November 8.
Revealed in a new trailer during the 2024 Summer Game Fest showcase, Slitterhead&#x27;s debut gameplay trailer starts in a Chinese city, with a police detective searching through a trashed ally. He finds what appears to be a mangled body in a trash can before the trailer shows more of the neon-lit Chinese metropolis, with shots of (presumably) our playable protagonist jumping from high above to the ground below while using some spectral power that allows them to possess bodies of pedestrians. We also get a look at Slitterhead&#x27;s monstrous creatures and third-person survival action gameplay, which features both guns and melee combat. 
Check it out for yourself in the Slitterhead gameplay trailer below: 


As you can see, Slitterhead is looking quite action-packed, especially compared to Toyama&#x27;s Silent Hill efforts. However, the lineage is clear. 
Slitterhead has largely remained a mystery since its reveal. We know in 2021, Toyama said he was working on a choice-driven game, and we assume that&#x27;s Slitterhead. Toyama also told IGN Japan his next project (presumably Slitterhead) would be released in 2023. Obviously, that didn&#x27;t happen, but now we know it&#x27;s releasing this November. Outside of that, a behind-the-scenes video diary showed a few clips of Slitterhead, including training room-esque encounters, a neon-lit Chinese city, and even a dog that appears to be playable. 
Slitterhead hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC on November 8.

An animated trailer shows off the Fatal Fury guest characters – a first for Street Fighter – while in-game cinematic reveals a rather disheveled M.Bison who looks as maniacal as ever. These four will kick off a new Year of add-on fighters now that Akuma has wrapped up the Year 1 offerings. They&#x27;ll arrive in the following order:

The role-playing game is the new franchise and story from the same creative team responsible for the recent Persona games, including Persona 5.
The main focus of their presentation was on Archetypes, the game’s approach to classes. The characters of the game transform into various Archetypes, and within the storyline, these Archetypes represent the  manifestion of will to face one’s fears.
Archetypes include the likes of Ninja, Merchant, Warrior, Destroyer, Gunner, Assassin, or Knight. In total, there are more than 40 distinct Archetypes.
The subsequent trailer showed off how some of these Archetypes function in gameplay.
If you’re excited to see the Persona team’s talents translate over into a true fantasy backdrop, Metaphor: ReFantazio is on the way to PlayStation consoles, Xbox consoles, and PC, on October 11.</span>

                              <span>Last month Oculus Studios and developer Camoflaj announced a new entry in the Arkham series, Batman: Arkham Shadow. The teaser implied Batman would be tussling with the Rat King (not to be confused with Ratcatcher, we think) in VR, and it would be canon to the Arkham universe that Rocksteady created, but little else was revealed beyond that. Today, we received another pre-rendered trailer, so while we&#x27;re still not sure how the game will look and play, we at least have a better idea of the game&#x27;s tone and characters. The dramatic cover of a popular song chosen for this cinematic trailer? &quot;Bullet With Butterfly Wings&quot; by the Smashing Pumpkins A.K.A. the rat in a cage song.


The trailer shows Gordon, The Rat King, seemingly in a prison cell, and what appears to be a still-sane version of Harley Quinn. Here is the story outline from the trailer&#x27;s press release.
It’s the Fourth of July, and Gotham City is besieged by a new threat: the mysterious Rat King and his cultish devotees. Public officials have been abducted, including Batman associates Commissioner Jim Gordon and District Attorney Harvey Dent. The Rats have pledged to execute them in one week’s time for “crimes committed against the people of Gotham City.”
As widespread rioting engulfs the city, Batman races to prevent this so-called “Day of Wrath,” but it all goes wrong.
Set between the events of Batman: Arkham Origins and Batman: Arkham Asylum, you’ll experience the origins of such iconic characters as The Scarecrow, Harley Quinn, and more, as Batman grapples with the contradiction at the core of his identity—the use of force in pursuit of

The press release for the new trailer promises the game will have a &quot;blend of exploration, stealth, and free-flowing combat the series is known for.&quot; The game is coming exclusively to Meta Quest 3 next year.</span>

                              <span>Neva, the next game by Gris developer Nomada Studios, got its first big gameplay showing during Summer Game Fest. In it, a woman and her wolf companion explore a beautiful world while fending off dangerous creatures in a cursed world.
Gris was notable for its beautiful art direction, and Neva is no slouch in that department. It looks beautiful, as do the animations of the woman, Alba, and Neva, her canine companion. In addition to platforming, Alba can gracefully cut down foes with her sword as Neva backs her in combat. It&#x27;s also worth noting that Neva appears to age over time, growing much larger than Alba indicating the game unfolds over a substantial passage of time.


Neva is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC later this year.</span>

This reveal follows Geoff Keighley&#x27;s teasing back in May that 2K will reveal the next iteration of one of its &quot;biggest and most beloved franchises&quot; at SGF. Many assumed it might be the next BioShock or Mafia game, but it turns out it was Civilization 7, the first entry in the series since 2016&#x27;s Civilization 6 by Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns developer Firaxis Games. In the reveal trailer, we get a look at various eras of history in a stylized cinematic trailer, but there&#x27;s no gameplay to be seen. 
Check it out for yourself in the Civilization 7 reveal trailer below: 


Civilization 7 will launch simultaneously on consoles and PC in 2025.

Like Horizon Zero Dawn and Horizon Forbidden West, Aloy returns in Lego Horizon Adventures as the protagonist of the exploration-based adventure game. It&#x27;s releasing simultaneously on PlayStation 5, Switch, and PC this holiday. 
Revealed during today&#x27;s Summer Game Fest 2024 showcase, Lego Horizon Adventures seems to take the fun, action, and robot dinosaurs of the Horizon series and turn it all into bricks (literally). However, instead of world-ending threats, Lego Horizon Adventures has a much more comedic and tongue-in-cheek vibe to Aloy&#x27;s journey, with an emphasis on two-player co-op action. It&#x27;s being developed by Guerrilla and Studio Gobo.

                              <span>After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora&#x27;s Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora&#x27;s Mask&#x27;s unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.

                              <span>Given Mega Man’s enormous presence on classic Nintendo consoles, it’s surprising that the only game available on the Nintendo Switch Online libraries has been Mega Man: The Wily Wars…for Sega Genesis. That has been remedied somewhat thanks to the addition of five Game Boy titles starring the Blue Bomber.
Right now, Switch Online subscribers can enjoy the following Game Boy titles:
Mega Man: Dr. Wily’s Revenge
Mega Man II
Mega Man III
Mega Man IV
Mega Man V


For those unaware, the Game Boy series of Mega Man aren’t just ports of their NES counterparts. Rather, they’re a separate series of original games and are differentiated by the titles’ use of Roman numerals instead of numbers. You can more or less think of them as Mega Man’s versions of the Super Mario Land series, and while they feature their own plots, levels, and bosses, they incorporate some mechanics and enemies from the NES entries. While these aren’t the original NES games fans likely would have hoped for, it’s cool to have the lesser-known Game Boy titles accessible on modern hardware.

                              <span>Neva is immediately recognisable as the next puzzle platformer from the developers behind Gris thanks to its sweeping, overlapping planes and effortlessly natural watercolour art, which were both on show again in tonight’s Geoffest Summer Game Fest show. I was expecting more eye candy from Neva after its announcement last summer, but what caught me by surprise was all the hacking and slashing that ensues in its second trailer.

                              <span>It’s easy to draw comparisons between Metaphor: ReFantazio and Persona, given that the upcoming RPG is in the works over at Persona makers Atlus and is built around a similar ‘transform into an awesome-looking robot/creature and do battle’ concept, but so far all those comparisons only serve to highlight just how damn good Metaphor: ReFantazio looks.

It’s a hack n’ slash co-op roguelike with some nifty looking strategy elements and a striking art style, but you can tell most of that from the trailer below:

                              <span>Stare into an abyss for long enough and, as Nietzsche wrote, a mostly naked man will wobble out of the abyss and try to murder you with a mattock. Inasmuch as can be told in the absence of dialogue or a text preamble, the naked man wants to murder you because you, and not he, are in possession of a hat. The hat makes you look like an eraser pencil from Forbidden Planet. It&#x27;s the kind of headgear worn by the kind of criminal Batman&#x27;s too grown-up to fight anymore. But it has, nonetheless, roused in this under-dressed stranger a sense of Dionysian frenzy. He will do anything for that hat - hewing your arms off, ripping your intestines out, tearing the skin from your ribcage. And you, in turn, will do anything to rob him of that mattock, because by the gods, it looks a lot more dangerous than the candlestick you&#x27;re trying to fend him off with.


There are many such lost souls in the bleak, midnight world of the Half Sword demo - all lurking near candle-lit piles of randomly spawned hammers, stools, barrels, axes and lengths of wood, all subject to unforgivably authentic physics and cursor-based attacks that conspire to transform every scuffle into a Monty Python blooper reel.

                              <span>Sonar Shock is a reminder that some of the best game concepts or settings seem so obvious as soon as you play them.
System Shock on an unreasonably huge submarine on an equally ludicrous trip around the Northeast Passage via Cape Agulhas? With a satirical Soviet setting that isn&#x27;t just &quot;lol russia&quot; or &quot;I think Stalker was about machismo and gun attachments&quot;? And a third thing that I&#x27;ll get to in a minute because this intro is getting out of control? God yes.

                              <span>Whether or not they actually amount to anything, rumours of a new Doom have had me diving back into Doom Eternal recently. There’s at least one level in it that feels like essay-bait, so I’m obliging. The centerpiece of Mars Core - the FPS’  best level - is a comically massive superweapon called the BFG-10000. Oh, Chekov. If only you could see what we’ve done with your wisdom. The literary subtlety to gun-big-enough-to-scar-planets pipeline will eventually subsume all of pop culture, and those of us who chose to specialise writing about headshots will alternate between grins and tears from the wreckage.

So, when a game like horror tower defence Bella Wants Blood comes along and uses some odd nouns, I get all excited. Here, that’s because I get to recklessly spaff out terms like ‘Blood Gutters’, ‘The Rattler’, and your friend and mine, ‘The Stabber’. Barely an atom quivers in Bella Wants Blood that hasn’t been stylised or made odd and alluring in some way.

                              <span>Back in 2020, fresh out of high school and feeling unstoppable, Charles Maddock and a few friends “decided to code a game about Fish Wizards.” The result was Fishards,  Magicka-inspired PVP arena action that has you out-squirt, out-splash, and out-spellcast your mates. It’s a charmer, but after two years of dev, release saw it suffer the same sad fate as many multiplayer-only indies. People would play for half hour, says Maddock, then refund the game because they couldn’t find others to play with.

Sony&#x27;s Horizon series is coming to Switch in Lego form. As rumoured before today&#x27;s Summer Game Fest&#x27;s opening showcase, LEGO Horizon Adventures does indeed exist, but the big surprise is that it&#x27;s coming on day one to Nintendo&#x27;s Switch.
Scheduled to launch Holiday season 2024, this game is co-developed between Guerrilla, the studio behind the Horizon series, and Studio Gobo. Described as &quot;a playful and light-hearted story inspired by the events of the world of Horizon,&quot; you&#x27;ll control a Danish plastic version of series protagonist Aloy in a game &quot;designed for two-player action without the need for split-screen.&quot;

It&#x27;s that time again, folks. Geoff Keighley is back with the Opening Showcase for Summer Game Fest 2024, officially kicking off a season of exciting game announcements and reveals.
Now, rather cheekily, Geoff has informed viewers to lower their expectations for this one, stressing that it will mostly be focused on known entities rather than brand-new announcements. We&#x27;re expecting Sonic X Shadow Generations to crop up, but who knows what else Geoff has in store for us.

                              <span>Hint: it&#x27;s quite a bit.
Have you ever wondered how much it would actually cost publishers to showcase a trailer at Geoff Keighley&#x27;s Summer Game Fest Opening Showcase? Well, probably not. But you&#x27;re here now, which means you&#x27;re likely just a little bit curious, right?
Thanks to Esquire (via Eurogamer), the costs for game trailers have been revealed, and it ain&#x27;t cheap, folks. Basically, publishers looking to showcase a one-minute trailer will need to fork up $250,000. Add 30 seconds and you&#x27;re looking at $350,000. Two minutes is $450,000, and two-and-a-half minutes is $550,000.

Nintendo of America is back with a fresh batch of eShop discounts as the &#x27;Mega Extreme Fun Sale&#x27; is now underway.
The sale kicked off yesterday (6th June) and will run until 16th June, bringing some welcome discounts to a selection of games and DLC expansions. This one is only available on the North American eShop at the moment, though we&#x27;re sure that it won&#x27;t be too long before Europe gets a similar sale period of its own.

By any measure, the Switch has been a rousing success. It has outsold and outlasted almost every gaming console ever made, but according to Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa, its days are now numbered.
Rumors aside, we don’t know exactly what form the “Switch successor” will take, nor even what it will be called. But one thing we know for sure is that it will play games. And Nintendo will make a few of them. What do you say we make an educated guess about which games Nintendo makes, and when each one will launch?

Ahead of Antonblast&#x27;s launch later this year on 12th November 2024, developer Summitsphere has released the game&#x27;s opening cutscene, and it&#x27;s pretty great.
It showcases Satan (naturally) who, after conversing with a magical mirror, discovers that there is a &#x27;red guy&#x27; who happens to &#x27;shine more crimson&#x27; than he. This, of course, is our protagonist, Dynamite Anton, so poor ol&#x27; Satan decides to take what Anton loves the most, coax him into his lair, and &#x27;siphon his delightfully rosy tone&#x27;.

Last year, we caught our first glimpse of Sky Oceans: Wings for Hire, an upcoming JRPG from PQube and Octeto Studios which wears its Skies of Arcadia inspiration proudly on its sleeve. Well, it popped up again at yesterday&#x27;s Guerilla Collective. This time with a brand-new gameplay trailer.
The fresh footage gives a pretty good idea of what this one will have in store for us when it lands on Switch later this year (a more precise date still hasn&#x27;t been revealed). We get to see the turn-based sky battles in action, catch a glimpse of the crew recruitment process and check out some of the ship customisation options.

                              <span>Mega Man&#x27;s Game Boy series slides onto NSO.
After a Switch Online listing for five Mega Man Game Boy games was spotted on the eShop, Nintendo has now sent this latest update live - adding Mega Man: Dr Wily&#x27;s Revenge, Mega Man II, Mega Man III, Mega Man IV and Mega Man V to its digital library.
These Capcom titles were originally released for the Game Boy between 1991 and 1994. Here&#x27;s the full rundown (via the PR):

Sega announced earlier this year Sonic X Shadow Generations would be coming to the Switch and multiple other platforms this Autumn, so when exactly can we expect it?
Although a specific date hasn&#x27;t been confirmed yet, according to &#x27;billbil-kun&#x27; of Dealabs, this remaster featuring a brand new story campaign is currently targeting an October release, with the price for the physical edition expected to be $49 USD across all platforms (including the Switch).

                              <span>Two of Fatal Fury&#x27;s finest are joining the roster for Year 2 of Street Fighter 6. Terry and Mai are heading to SF6, alongside series mainstays Elena and M. Bison, as DLC fighters.


It&#x27;s a pretty surprising move to see two SNK mainstays cross over into a mainline Street Fighter, especially this early in its DLC rollout. There are surely a few fighters left from Capcom&#x27;s history to pull in. But in another way, this is the closest we can get to a new Capcom vs. SNK, so I&#x27;ll take it.




Here&#x27;s the rough schedule for Year 2 of Street Fighter 6&#x27;s character rollout:



M. Bison - Summer 2024 


Terry - Autumn 2024 


Mai - Winter 2025 


Elena - Spring 2025



They&#x27;ll likely be available as either individual purchases, or one big bundle. Either way, you&#x27;ll be able to check in on your friends and ask them, &quot;Are you okay?&quot; in Street Fighter 6 sometime this year.

                              <span>During the Summer Game Fest 2024, Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero got a confirmed release date. The game will be available to play on Oct. 11, 2024 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. 


In the trailer, we see plenty of iconic Dragon Ball universe characters, from Piccolo to Frieza. The game will likely follow along with the franchise&#x27;s classic storyline starting with one of Goku&#x27;s first ever DBZ showdowns. We also got a look at pre-order bonuses, showcasing Gogeta and Broly forms. However, one playable character still remains a mystery. 




Dragon Ball Sparking! Zero will continue on the beloved Budokai Tenkaichi series. We&#x27;ve seen several iterations over the years, including the fan-favorite Budokai Tenkaichi 2. Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero seeks to revitalize the series, and I can&#x27;t wait to see how it all pans out. So, make sure to tune in for its October 11, 2024 release date across various platforms.

In classic Civ fashion, players can take on the role of one of many legendary leaders as they establish a civilization, build cities, and tech up through the ages building architectural wonders.

Almost a decade and six DLC packs later, Civilization 6 is one year away from no longer being the current Civilization game. We don&#x27;t know too much about it yet other than its existence, but the trailer indicated a gameplay showcase is prepared for August of this year.


Sid Meier&#x27;s Civilization VII is scheduled to release in 2025 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam.

                              <span>Cuff Bust has been officially revealed as the second title from solo developer 2 Star Games, creator of the viral horror sensation Choo Choo Charles. In this manic multiplayer title, players must work together to escape prison and live life to the fullest on the outside. 


After a few fairly major announcements during Summer Game Fest 2024, host Geroff Keighley highlighted Cuff Bust, a multiplayer game from a solo indie developer that looks like it can offer all sorts of silliness for up to 20 players online. Players take on the role of Jailiens, creatures locked up in a facility somewhere on Earth, and must work together to escape their prison. The trouble is, they&#x27;re not the most coordinated bunch on the planet.

                              <span>The Summer Game Fest 2024 unveiled the next phase of the Harry Potter universe with Harry Potter Quidditch Champions. It will arrive on September 3, 2024, on PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, Steam, and Epic Games Store. 


You&#x27;ll take on various roles in the beloved sport stemming from the famous book and movie franchise. If you were missing out on Quidditch in Hogwarts Legacy, tune in to this next adventure. Like Harry Potter, you can take on the role of Seeker, amongst other positions. Test your Quidditch skills to see if you have what it takes. 




Harry Potter Quidditch Champions will be available on Day 1 on PlayStation Plus. I&#x27;m certainly looking forward to this one as a longtime HP fan. It&#x27;s been a long time coming, and I can&#x27;t wait to see how it translates into the modern gaming world. Make sure to mark your calenders in September!

                              <span>Sony Interactive Entertainment kicked off the Summer Game Fest 2024 with a look at Lego Horizon Adventures, the next game in the popular Lego series of titles.  Players will experience the epic world of Horizon as the main character Aloy as you run around in Lego form taking on the robotic creatures the world is best known for.




It&#x27;s a mesh between two worlds I didn&#x27;t expect, but actually looks like a good time. I&#x27;m curious if it will focus on just the original Horizon Zero Dawn, or the new Horizon Forbidden West as well.


Lego Horizon Adventures releases on PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam and Epic Games Store in Holiday 2024.

What is the Destiny 2: The Final Shape Salvation&#x27;s Edge World First Race?


Like most MMO&#x27;s, Destiny 2 features pinnacle PvE content in the form of raids. Players are tasked with putting together their best 6-player fireteam and tackling the game&#x27;s hardest content inside of these raids which includes having to kill waves of enemies, solve challenging puzzles, superb coordination and communication, and fighting the most powerful bosses.

                              <span>Lollipop Chainsaw was initially released in 2012 and won fans over with its quirky combination of hack-and-slash gameplay and the core concept of a cheerleader protagonist who hunts zombies using a chainsaw in her spare time. 


The game has been remembered fondly for years, and in 2022, a remake was announced by the developer&#x27;s successor, Dragami Games. That remake is Lollipop Chainsaw RePop, but fans weren&#x27;t excited about their favorite game being completely remade from the ground up. So, instead, this title will be a remaster, preserving what was there in the original for those who loved it, and now, in 2024, we&#x27;re about to get our first real look at it as well as a release date.

                              <span>The EA FC 24 Thomas Muller and Ryan Christie Showdown SBC is a set of two special challenges that offer two unique cards.


It appears that EA Sports will also include the Showdown SBCs as part of the Euro 2024. This SBC set will feature the upcoming contest between Scotland and Germany, and you could complete either or both. Like all Showdown items, both Christie and Muller will be eligible for upgrades in the future.


EA FC 24 Thomas Muller and Ryan Christie Showdown SBC tasks


As stated earlier, you can complete either of the two SBCs. Ryan Christie&#x27;s item is easier to obtain as it has only one task, while Muller has two. All three tasks have their own set of conditions that must be kept in mind while submitting the squads.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been roughly three weeks since Helldivers 2 got its last major update, but the streak is getting ready to end. Arrowhead hopped on Discord to tease what&#x27;s coming with next week&#x27;s Helldivers 2 update, which will include visible supply lines and more than 100 fixes.


The info was delivered in typical Arrowhead fashion: As a meme. Community Manager Thomas &quot;Twinbeard&quot; Petersson was the one to drop the hint, saying &quot;So about that patch, here&#x27;s a little something. It&#x27;s Friday after all.&quot;

Among the most requested features from the community is the ability to see supply lines on the galactic map. According to the post, those are finally coming with a way to view attack origins.

                              <span>Monopoly GO Treasure hunt events are recurring monthly events that allow you to dig up hidden items to complete levels. You&#x27;ll obtain various rewards as you advance through each level, including cosmetics, dice, and a Wild Sticker. However, while grid sizes stay the same, treasure locations vary from person to person.


Are Treasures dig event grid random in Monopoly GO?


The grid layouts, size, and treasures in Monopoly GO&#x27;s treasures events are pre-determined, meaning they&#x27;re the exact same for every player. However, the locations of the treasures are random, so you won&#x27;t be able to use video guides or screenshots to pick the same dig spots as other players, as your treasure items may not appear in the same squares. 


In short, if you&#x27;re playing Monopoly GO with friends or family, you&#x27;ll have the same treasure event rewards, number of levels, and grid layouts as them, but the treasure locations will differ. You could have a treasure appear in a random corner of a huge grid, while someone else may have the same item spawn directly in the center. 


Screenshot by Destructoid


Nonetheless, you can still share ideas and tips with others based on a treasure event&#x27;s grids and items. Although item locations are random, there are still strategies you can use to make levels easier. For example, if you have a 3x3 item as your last treasure and only two possible spawn spots left, focus on those rather than a random 2x2 area on your grid to reduce your odds of wasting precious pickaxes.


Beyond this, Monopoly GO&#x27;s Treasures dig events are mostly luck-based, as your item locations will spawn in completely random areas. If you&#x27;re lucky, your first pickaxe will find a treasure immediately, allowing you to clear out an item or two quickly. Otherwise, you might have to sacrifice a few to narrow your options.

                              <span>The Witness always seems to have the upper hand throughout The Final Shape campaign. However, the pivotal Iconoclasm mission finally equips players with enough strength to mount a counterattack. We&#x27;re here to guide you on how to defeat the Witness in Destiny 2: The Final Shape.


Destiny 2: The Final Shape Witness boss guide


Destiny 2: The Final Shape&#x27;s Witness boss fight is the culmination of everything you&#x27;ve done in previous missions. Like most enemies, you won&#x27;t be able to attack it initially until its defenses have weakened. Although you won&#x27;t be able to strike the Witness, it will still come after you; keep an eye out for the notification, &#x27;The Witness unleashes an attack!&#x27;

                              <span>The Expanse is one of the modern juggernauts of the science fiction genre books. This is in part due to the excellent space storytelling and near-realism from authors Daniel Abraham and Ty Franck under the pen name James S.A. Corey. However, this popularity and success are also because of the equally highly recommended TV series. 


If you’re missing The Expanse these days, here are 10 science fiction books we’ve enjoyed that come the closest to capturing the grounded and darker tone of this beloved series.

Even for the most enthusiastic of lore hounds, that&#x27;s quite a long time to remember so many little details, but during the expansion&#x27;s recent media tour rounds, director and producer Naoki Yoshida had a few suggestions on lore details to study.


Perhaps it goes without saying, but stop reading now if you would rather go into Dawntrail knowing as little as possible. The details below contain spoilers for Endwalker and little breadcrumbs leading into Version 7.0.

                              <span>The EA FC 24 Andreas Christensen Path to Glory card could eventually become one of the best defensive items in the near future.


This card can be obtained quickly and for free since it&#x27;s part of the latest objective set. You&#x27;ll need to complete certain tasks, which require no in-game resources. Like all the Path to Glory cards available in packs, this item can also receive up to four levels of upgrades in the future.


All EA FC 24 Andreas Christensen Path to Glory objective tasks


The EA FC 24 Andreas Christensen Path to Glory objective set has four tasks. All four tasks have different conditions and can be completed in any order. That said, certain tasks are quicker to complete than the rest.



Clean Defending: Concede 1 or less goals per match in 4 separate matches in Squad Battles on Min. Semi-Pro difficulty (or Rivals/Champions).


Danish Collection: Score and Assist using a Danish player in 2 separate Squad Battles matches on Min. Semi-Pro difficulty (or Rivals/Champions).


Play 6: Play 6 matches in Squad Battles matches on Min. Semi-Pro difficulty (or Rivals/Champions).


Win 5: Win 5 matches in Squad Battles on Min. Semi-Pro difficulty (or Rivals/Champions) while having Min. 3 players from LALIGA EA SPORTS in your starting 11.

Once you finish all four tasks, the EA FC 24 Andreas Christensen Path to Glory objective will be complete. You can complete the challenges across any of the following modes:



Squad Battles


Division Rivals


Champions



I suggest completing them in Squad Battles, especially if you&#x27;re a beginner. The objective set rewards a 93-rated CB item featuring three great playstyle+ - Brusier, Aerial, and Jockey. For a free card, the grind is undoubtedly worth your time, and let&#x27;s not forget that this item can go up to an overall of 97 if Denmark wins the Euro 2024 (unlikely to happen, but still!).

                              <span>Somehow, it&#x27;s been over 10 years since Volgarr the Viking delivered its brutal brand of hack-and-slash platforming. Now it&#x27;s back for another round of glorious battle in Volgarr the Viking II, which is coming to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam and GOG on August 6, 2024.


You can see some of what developer Crazy Viking Studios has learned since releasing its debut game back in 2013 in the announcement trailer below.




It&#x27;s wild to think about how many similarly challenging indie games have been thrust into players&#x27; hands since the original Volgarr launched. The space is more crowded than ever before, and it&#x27;s also full of a ton of quality efforts within the same genre. As such, Crazy Viking Studios has evolved in some ways and is looking to offer players the means to hone their skills before putting them to the ultimate test on the battlefield.


Among those modern upgrades are features like practice mode, checkpoints, save profiles, and even the option to run through with unlimited continues. These additions may not wholly sate Volgarr&#x27;s bloodlust, though, so you&#x27;ll eventually want to try a run without them to see everything the sequel has to offer. As the description states, foregoing these &quot;modern comforts&quot; will allow you to unlock everything Volgarr the Viking II has to offer. 


Volgarr the Viking II was initially unveiled as part of this week&#x27;s Guerrilla Collective showcase. It&#x27;s nice to see the release date land in that August sweet spot, giving us plenty of time to sharpen our steel again with the first game before diving into the second.

Unlike previous evolutions, the EA FC 24 Euro Attackers Evolution only applies to four cards. These special items will be provided to everyone in Ultimate Team mode. Hence, this guide will focus on who can be the best choice for the evolution and why you should consider the choice over the rest.

EA Sports has already released many unique cards of footballers participating in the upcoming Euro and Copa America tournaments. You&#x27;ll have to depend on luck to pack one of those items. There&#x27;s no such issue with Diaz&#x27;s special card as long as you complete all the tasks.


EA FC 24 Luis Diaz Path to Glory SBC tasks


The EA FC 24 Luis Diaz Path to Glory SBC could be expensive since it consists of seven tasks. Each task has different conditions that must be satisfied during squad submission.

Like the World Cup 2022 mode in FIFA 23, the Euro content is exclusive and unlikely to appear in the next four games. The entire UEFA Euro mode is fully licensed, translating into authentic squads, historic moments, and many other things. Ultimately, the objective is to rewrite your history, and here are five teams that can help you do that.

                              <span>The new Prismatic subclass offers several hidden fragments across The Pale Heart. While some can be discovered through general exploration, others must be obtained during specific missions. In this guide, we&#x27;ll focus on how to get the Facet of Sacrifice in Destiny 2: The Final Shape.


Where to find Facet of Sacrifice in Destiny 2: The Final Shape 


Destiny 2: The Final Shape&#x27;s Facet of Sacrifice can be found in the Iconoclasm main campaign mission. It&#x27;ll appear sometime after the defeat of the Dolgith, Blade of Reasoning. If you&#x27;ve already completed this quest, you can replay it on either Normal or Legendary mode via The Pale Heart map.


As you tread the pathway to the mission&#x27;s waypoint, a broken statue will come into view. This is your cue to turn left and venture into a room where the Facet of Sacrifice lies.

Players must reach the upper level where a light shines. To do so, hop on the doorframe on the left and then jump to the elevated area.

Keep going through the openings of the pathway, resulting in the Facet of Sacrifice location. The Prismatic Fragment grants you a bonus Darkness Transcendence with an activated Arc, Solar, or Void buff. You can equip it via the Prismatic subclass section under Fragments.


More Prismatic Fragments can be found in other Destiny 2: The Final Shape main campaign missions. For example, Dissent and Ascent include these shiny new abilities on their respective pathways. Explore the rest of The Pale Heart map to collect them all, essentially becoming a Prismatic master.

                              <span>With the impending release of Euro 2024 tournament mode in FC Mobile, EA Sports has ensured that mobile games will be well-supported.


EA FC 24 players can already dive into an exclusive tournament mode packed with plenty of content on their PC, Nintendo Switch, and consoles. Mobile players will need to wait as of writing, but that won&#x27;t be for long. In an official blog post, EA Sports has announced that Euro 2024 tournament mode will also be released for mobile devices, albeit with some changes.


FC Mobile Euro 2024 tournament mode release date


First comes the release date, as the community will be anxious to try this new mode. In many ways, the upcoming tournament will resemble the FIFA World Cup mode, released in 2022. The Euro 2024 tournament is coming to mobile devices on June 11, 2024.




How to play FC Mobile Euro 2024 tournament mode


The upcoming mode will feature all 24 qualified nations with authentic kits (Switzerland and Austria being the exceptions) and squads. Matches can be played at six different difficulties (you&#x27;ll have to select at first). You will also be able to edit the selected lineup, and change tactics as required to get more wins. 


The group stages are based on real-life fixtures, but knockouts depend on your in-game progression. Once you win the tournament, you can share it with the rest of the world on social media. EA Sports will also introduce two new stadiums inspired by real-life locations:



Olympiastadion Berlin


BVB Stadion Dortmund



You&#x27;ll also earn different rewards after completing the tournament, but EA Sports has yet to share all the details. More information is expected to arrive in Ultimate Team once the release date comes closer. With so many additional promo items coming soon, playing the FC Mobile Euro 2024 tournament mode should be on the priority list for many players

Indeed, documents suggest that injunctions are up for negotiation.

Staff, talking under condition of anonymity, described corporate owners who pushed for a multiplayer game from the studio known for singleplayer experiences, as well as indecisive leadership and a culture of &quot;toxic positivity&quot;.

                              <span>I’ve been scouring Steam Next Fest demos specifically for something laid back, and Spilled! – despite sounding like the title of a musical about upturned milk – has delivered nicely. It’s a light and breezy ocean cleanup game that has you sailing a cute lil’ boat around polluted seas, cleansing oil patches and scooping up plastic bottles. Even if it doesn’t have the every-last-speck detailing of PowerWash Simulator or Viscera Cleanup Detail, it satisfies in very similar ways, and I would very much like to get back out on the water whenever the full game is complete.

                              <span>Back in the day I used to be one of those Counter Strike players who&#x27;d hop into a custom aim-training &#x27;environment&#x27;. I&#x27;d spend a good ten minutes or so darting my eyes between blobs or skittish enemy models then whipping my wrist to blast them with an AK.
Glyphica reminds me of those heady days. It&#x27;s a roguelite horde survival game where you&#x27;ve got to protect your central pewpew from an onslaught of words. I think it&#x27;s the perfect warm up for someone who&#x27;s about to do a big essay or maybe defend Dark Souls 2 in an errant comments section. It&#x27;s fun!

                              <span>Maybe you can relate, but I tend to find I crave twee and colorful things proportionally inverse to my melancholy. If I’m having a good week, give me Fear and Hunger and horrible films like Speak No Evil. If, like this week for some reason, I feel like bursting into tears at inopportune moments, I need silly little guys doing whimsical activities. Enter Dungeon Clawler. It’s a vaguely Slay The Spire-ish roguelite where you grab weapons from a claw machine while you fight. It&#x27;s got lazy Steam Deck depression nap written all over it. The main theme reminds me of Zombies Ate My Neighbors, and the character I picked is named Sir Bunalot.

No, it doesn&#x27;t boast a title in all-caps, but Selaco&#x27;s early access release more than deserves it&#x27;s spot as a must-play for those who desire some sophistication with their ultra-violence.

                              <span>Taipei’s annual Computex event is always a big, circled, triple-underlined mark in the PC gaming hardware calendar. Whereas CES splits its focus across tech, cars, and the occasional overdesigned white good, Computex is all computing, all the time, making it a prime source of reveals and showcases for the hardware bits that make games happen.
Sadly, Computex 2024 is unlikely to go down as a classic, largely because this year’s show has been mesmerised by AI and the most tedious applications thereof: search, but different somehow! Run art-stealing generation tools faster! Oh, Computex, what have they done to you, and why do you have seven fingers on one hand?
Granted, AI is a broad field, and not everything about it is necessarily gross or creatively bankrupting. But it also doesn’t deserve to overshadow all the other useful, unexpected, and curiosity-piquing gaming tech that Computex has to offer, from new Steam Deck alternatives to resurrected CPU lineups and promising graphics card updates. Here are those highlights of the show so far...

What is Fucksweeper? Discerning videogame cognoscente that you are, I feel like you should be able to read the title and form some broad conclusions. But for those who never owned a Windows PC in the 90s, Fucksweeper is a free, titillating, revolting, beautiful, apocalyptic new version of classic avoid-the-bombs grid puzzler Minesweeper that incorporates elements of dating sims and a vast quantity of generative AI filth. Maybe turn down the volume before watching this video.

                              <span>After the climatic end to a decade-long saga in Endwalker, anticipation is high for Final Fantasy XIV’s next expansion, Dawntrail. I got to try out the game and talk to Director Naoki Yoshida (aka Yoshi-P) about new Jobs and the difficulty of incorporating fan feedback (not to mention the reasons the Warrior of Light has such great skin - you&#x27;ll see). But how can the Square Enix possibly hope to follow the highs of Endwalker, including space travel and a fight against the physical embodiment of sorrow? By taking us on holiday, of course.

                              <span>Hollywood Animal is a management sim about turning a bankrupt movie studio into a money printing machine, set in Hollywood’s golden age. While a Frostpunk 2 or Manor Lords might have you grapple with the elements, here it’s all about balancing a fickle audience and Tinseltown’s seedy underbelly. Maybe making some worthwhile art, too? Sorry, did I say ‘worthwhile art’? I meant to say “lots of money.” Let’s get clicking!
First up, I need to name my studio (I settle on Horace&#x27;s Revenge) as well as my crack new team of business bastards. There’s my chief legal officer, Jebediah End. My CCO, Anne Egg, and CFO, Rummy McLastdrink. He doesn’t have a sauce problem, because obviously I wouldn’t put him in charge of money if he did. In the wreckage of the studio, we find an unedited film reel hidden in the waffles n’ cocaine cupboard. It’s a noir thriller named ‘Messenger Of Death’. Whatever influential critic is currently directing this era’s discourse has chosen to categorise each film as genre percentages (‘60% detective/40% thriller’), and setting (‘modern American city’.) Let’s just hope those pigs in the stands recognise a solid gold picture when they see one!

                              <span>Square Enix’s hit MMORPG, Final Fantasy XIV, is known for taking inspiration from the franchise’s long history. Past expansions have pulled heavily on specific games, such as 2019 expansion Shadowbringers offering a reinterpretation of Final Fantasy III. But with Dawntrail, the next expansion releasing this summer,…

This puts it in the same price range as Helldivers 2 and seems to be another sign that Sony’s live-service titles won’t all be free-to-play like Destiny 2.

In addition to going up to 16 cores versus 8 with the Xeon E-2400 series, the more competitive pricing, the 3D V-Cache SKUs, and 28 PCIe lanes rather than 20, the AMD EPYC 4004 models also support DDR5-5200 memory where as the Intel Raptor Lake E-2400 models are bound to DDR5-4800. In this follow-up testing is a look at the AMD EPYC 4004 performance both at DDR5-4800 and DDR5-5200 speeds for showing the performance difference.</span>

Some models are also already available for pre-order ahead of launch day. This is quite nice compared to in the past there was often at times quite a delay between the initial AMD Ryzen mobile announcements and being able to (pre)order any hardware.

Revealed as part of today&#x27;s Guerrilla Collective presentation, Playtonic&#x27;s Yooka-Laylee is returning for an encore on &quot;PC and consoles&quot; with Yooka-Replaylee, a glow-up for the 2017 indie original that brought back the Banjo spirit to the 3D platforming genre.
As you can see from the reveal trailer above, this remaster isn&#x27;t just a spit-polish in the visuals department, but will feature numerous gameplay tweaks and additions, including a new world map, improvements to existing challenges, refinements to the duo&#x27;s moveset and the camera, and Dave Wise and Grant Kirkhope&#x27;s music getting the full orchestral score treatment.

If you happen to recall the bizarre 1999 point-and-click title Garage: Bad Dream Adventure, then you&#x27;re in for a treat. If you don&#x27;t, then... well... you&#x27;re still in for a treat because it looks wild.
It launches on the Switch eShop today for £16.99 / $24.99, so by the time you&#x27;re reading this, you might be able to purchase and download it. For the uninitiated, Garage originated in Japan from developer Kinotrope and was released for Windows and Mac. It&#x27;s since been ported to Android and iOS, but we&#x27;re honestly thrilled to see it on Switch.

Since the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One launched in 2013, gamers have increasingly been given the option to tweak their experiences based on whether they prefer higher image quality or smoother performance.
Not all developers offer this, but now that we&#x27;re more than three-and-a-half years into the lifespan of the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, player expectations have adjusted accordingly to the point where it almost feels mandatory to include &#x27;Quality&#x27; and &#x27;Performance&#x27; options in the biggest games on those platforms. It&#x27;s why you see almost constant requests for a re-release of Bloodborne, a game that is infamously capped at 30fps on PS4, with Rockstar&#x27;s Red Dead Redemption 2 being a close second.

                              <span>Developer Sobaka Studio has revealed Kiborg: Arena, a roguelike that looks like a cyberpunk Sifu. Revealed during today&#x27;s Guerrilla Collective showcase, Arena is a prequel to Kiborg and it&#x27;s coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (via Steam) sometime this summer. 
In the full game – Kiborg – players must fend of waves of foes as Morgan Lee, the leader of a ragtag group of resistance fighters on the prison planet of Sigma. &quot;Strike with punishing hand-to-hand combat skills, blast mechanized soldiers with firearms, and deploy cybernetic-enhanced abilities to devastate bloodthirsty baddies. Learn to dodge, block, and parry adversaries to set them up for the killing blow.&quot; It sounds and, given how it appears in the trailer below, looks a lot like Sifu, which is a great combat-centric brawler from 2022. 
Check out the Kiborg action in the trailer below:


In Arena, players find &quot;Morgan Lee, who sends the clones that fight on his behalf out on missions, fighting in Sigma&#x27;s Colisseum. Here, Morgan&#x27;s clones will square off in bloody battles against other denizens of the prison planet for the cash to help keep his resistance going.&quot; Arena also features an Endless Mode, which Sobaka says spawns an infinite amount of increasingly difficult enemies to overcome.
In the full game, players will gather resources to unlock permanent upgrades, form alliances, and research forbidden technologies to gain the upper hand. 
Here are some Kiborg screenshots: 

Arena launches this summer on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. The full Kiborg game does not yet have a release date.

                              <span>Developer Playtonic has revealed Yooka-Replaylee, a remaster of its 2017 platformer Yooka-Laylee. It revealed this during today&#x27;s Guerrilla Collective 2024 Showcase with a new trailer that highlighted the game&#x27;s new visuals, improved camera and gameplay controls, remixed challenges, and more. 
&quot;Embark on an epic open-world 3D platforming collectathon adventure with Yooka and Laylee,&quot; the game&#x27;s description reads. &quot;The search for Pagies starts anew in Yooka-Replaylee, the enhanced definitive version of the beloved indie darling with all new challenges, secrets, mechanics, and accessibility options.&quot; 
Check it out for yourself in the Yooka-Replaylee reveal trailer below: 


Yooka-Laylee launched in 2017 on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, Wii U, and PC, and we had a great time with it – you can read why in Game Informer&#x27;s Yooka-Laylee review. Though the game is a 3D collect-a-thon, it got a sequel in 2019 called Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair that played more like Donkey Kong Country. 
Yooka-Replaylee is coming to PC and unspecified consoles. It has no release window.

                              <span>Dragon Age: Dreadwolf, the next game in the series, has a new name – Dragon Age: The Veilguard. BioWare first teased the game back in 2018, and we later learned it was called Dragon Age: Dreadwolf in 2022. Now, BioWare has changed the name to Dragon Age: The Veilguard, with a promise of a first look at its gameplay next week on Tuesday, June 11. 
As for why, the team explains it&#x27;s about the characters that will make up the companions you meet in the game in a new blog post. 


&quot;At BioWare, we create worlds of adventure, conflict and companionship, where you&#x27;re at the center of it all.

                              <span>We got our first look at Firewalk Studios&#x27; upcoming 5v5 first-person shooter Concord last week during a PlayStation State of Play, which is where we also learned it will launch simultaneously on PlayStation 5 and PC on August 23 after a beta this July. Now, thanks to a new PlayStation Blog post detailing the game&#x27;s preorder contents, we know it will cost $39.99. 
That same blog post says Concord will launch with 16 playable characters known as Freerunners, 12 unique maps set on various in-universe worlds, and six distinct team-based modes. And that content will &quot;expand shortly after launch with regular, post-launch updates&quot; for all players at no additional cost. 
Here&#x27;s a look at the Concord box art: 
Alongside the standard $39.99 edition of the game, PlayStation and Firewalk are releasing a Digital Deluxe Edition for $59.99 that includes additional cosmetics to customize your Freegunners and 72-hours early access to the game&#x27;s August launch. Preordering the game, regardless of edition, also gets you (and up to four friends) beta access and the Monarch cosmetics pack. 
Here&#x27;s a look at the Concord Digital Deluxe Edition: 
&quot;Seeing Vale and other Freegunners in action in gameplay footage is one thing, but there&#x27;s no substitute for experiencing the game for yourself,&quot; the blog post reads. &quot;That&#x27;s why we&#x27;re hosting a pre-launch beta, simultaneously on PS5 and PC with cross-play support. Those that pre-order will have an opportunity to be among the first to play Concord.&quot; 
That beta is set to happen this July before Concord launches on PS5 and PC on August 23.

                              <span>The Angry Birds Movie 3 is officially in production. The threequel to the hit animated films is being produced by Rovio Entertainment, creators of the Angry Birds franchise, in collaboration with Sega and Prime Focus Studios.
Red and Chuck are back, with Jason Sudeikis and Josh Gad reprising their roles, respectively. It will be directed by John Rice (The Angry Birds Movie 2, Beavis and Butt-Head Do the Universe) with a screenplay written by Thurop Van Orman (The Angry Birds Movie 2, Adventure Time, The Misadventures of Flapjack). DNEG Animation will bring the film to life, as opposed to being handled by Rovio and Sony as with the last two films. Prime Focus Studios, which co-produced The Garfield Movie, is set to produce. 
A press release provides no details on the plot nor a release window. If you’re wondering why Sega is now involved, the company purchased Rovio last year. Given that the two previous films were box office successes and have grossed a combined $500 million worldwide, it’s a little surprising we haven’t gotten a third film already.

Now, a new report from Bloomberg details the game&#x27;s behind-the-scenes troubles, including a culture of &quot;toxic positivity,&quot; shifting visions, and more, ultimately resulting in the game being a $200 million loss for parent company Warner Bros. Discovery. 
Bloomberg reports that following the release of DC&#x27;s Suicide Squad in 2016, which made $750 million at the box office on a budget of $175 million, Warner Bros. wanted to build on that IP&#x27;s success.

                              <span>Last year&#x27;s Octopath Traveler II is now available on Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One, Square Enix has announced. Plus, Square Enix has released the first Octopath Traveler on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4, meaning both mainline Octopath Traveler games are now playable on all console platforms. 
If you&#x27;re on Xbox, Octopath Traveler II is also available on Xbox and PC Game Pass alongside the first game. If you&#x27;ve been waiting to jump into this series – whether on Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, or PC – now is the best time. And both games are great; read why in Game Informer&#x27;s Octopath Traveler review and Game Informer&#x27;s Octopath Traveler II review. 


To celebrate the series being available on all current platforms and PC (via Steam and Windows), developer Team Asano has released a free update to Octopath Traveler II that includes an &quot;Extra Battle&quot; mode that becomes available after defeating the game&#x27;s final boss. In this mode, players can test their skills against newly added extra-tough opponents – including the main characters from the first game. This mode has been available on Xbox consoles since launch but is now available on PlayStation, Switch, and PC. 
&quot;Since its launch in 2018 with Octopath Traveler, the Octopath Traveler series has sold over four million copies worldwide, popularizing the unique HD-2D art style: a striking blend of 2D character designs in beautiful 3D worlds,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;Both games are a standalone experience set in different worlds with eight distinct protagonists, each with their own stories to explore and Path Actions to use. Players will embark on a grand adventure and steer their own journey, depending on whom they choose to play as.&quot;

New expansions are always a fun time, especially for high-end raiders who will be getting shiny new buttons to press, and with that comes new rotations. After approximately 8,000 hours of playing Final Fantasy XIV and clearing The Omega Protocol on release, I think I&#x27;m able to provide some insight about the new weaponskills, spells, and abilities (and their implications for rotations, openers, and general play) I saw at a recent preview event for its upcoming Dawntrail expansion. I am not an expert at every job, and I could not test each job to its limit, so feel free to point out mistakes on my part.

Můžeme se tak podívat na novinky, které opět stojí za to. Nově běží s GPU akcelerací compositing pro fine rendery (výsledek by měl být prakticky stejný pro CPU i GPU cestu). Render compositor je přepsán, jeho běh je nyní až několikanásobně rychlejší. Rychleji probíhají i undo operace.</span>

                              <span>The Last of Us Season 2 is on the way but it won’t be last for the series, nor will it cover the entirety of the sequel it&#x27;s adapting. A new interview with Deadline reveals the season’s 7-episode count, the likelihood of a third and even fourth season, and how the showrunners plan on telling its story.
The Last of Us Part II is a long game. So much so that showrunners and directors Craig Mazin and Naughty Dog president Neil Druckmann realized it would need to tell its story across more than one season. 
“The story material that we got from Part II of the game is way more than the story material that was in the first game, so part of what we had to do from the start was figure out how to tell that story across seasons,” Mazin said. “When you do that, you look for natural breakpoints, and as we laid it out, this season, the natural breakpoint felt like it came after seven episodes.”
Even though Season 2 will be shorter than Season 1, one of its episodes is said to be &quot;quite big&quot; in length. The showrunners also tease that a potential Season 3 will be much larger in scope. Despite this, Mazin doesn’t believe they can tell the whole story in two seasons because they want to take their time. “And indeed, the story may require Season 4,” he says.
HBO has not yet renewed The Last of Us for a third or fourth season, but Mazin believes it will happen, “as long as people keep watching.” 
For those worried that Season 2 would rush through Part II&#x27;s events, it seems you can relax. We&#x27;ll see where the story stops when The Last of Us Season 2 kicks off in 2025. To get a look at what the season has in store, you can take your first looks at Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey’s Joel and Ellie, and read about the castings for Dina, along with Manny, Mel, Owen, and Nora. Actor Jeffrey Wright was recently cast to reprise his role as Isaac.

Hauntii drew me in immediately thanks to its striking illustrated art direction and enchanting jazz noir soundtrack. A powerful opening sees the protagonist, an adorable ghost who recently died, attempting to ascend to a heavenly plane hand in hand with an angel-like guardian, only to be shackled and pulled back to the depths of Eternity. It’s an emotionally effective moment, and while the gameplay doesn’t always prove as captivating, it provides enough thrills to propel through an eye-popping…</span>

As for why, the company cites restructuring as it pursues a clarified vision around &quot;multiple strategic changes.&quot; Behaviour says these layoffs will not affect its service business or its development on Dead by Daylight.

Back in 2015, I sat down with fighting game community staple and former Capcom employee Seth Killian for a demo of the first game from Radiant Entertainment – his then-newly founded indie studio – Rising Thunder. The title, which featured robots fighting one another, aimed to give players a 2D fighter with simple controls and little barrier to entry. Rising Thunder showed a ton of promise, so much so that League of Legends developer Riot Games acquired Radiant Entertainment in 2016. This led to the cancellation of Rising Thunder, which was at that point in alpha, with many of the core tenets transferrin…</span>

                              <span>Online piracy is a major problem for the entertainment industries. In some instances, the problem is kept intact due to limited availability of content from legal sources. This week, &#x27;Adam Ruins Everything&#x27; star Adam Conover mentioned BitTorrent as a viewing option for fans who no longer have access to the series after HBO removed it a few months ago.

What set this apart from similar lawsuits was a two-line warning in the complaint&#x27;s introduction. Elsewhere, the statement could&#x27;ve been dismissed as typical anti-piracy posturing, but here, Bungie&#x27;s relentless deanonymization of targets sends a powerful, credible message.

                              <span>Mods are to Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 what butter is to bread, that unreadable squiggle-font is to death metal bands or wheels are to the bottom of trainers when you’re a kid: not necessarily essential, per se, but so harmonious and well-suited that they feel essential. In the case of the D&amp;D CRPG, it’s a natural extension of playing dungeon master around the table, crafting the world and its characters as you see fit - typically by making everyone in Faerûn even hornier somehow.

                              <span>We knew a PC adapter for PlayStation’s VR2 headset was on the way, and it looked to be fairly soon - and we were right! Sony’s shiniest virtual reality offering is now confirmed to be adding official PC support via a nifty wired adapter at the start of August. It’ll cost £50/$60 - but whether it’s worth the price given a number of key features will be missing is another question entirely...

That coldness seems to have seeped into the company itself too, as they racked up their career-killing bodycount with nearly 100 more layoffs this week.

A brighter, stagier variety of action-role-playing, which deepens the connection between Italian folklore and Soulsliking established by last year&#x27;s Lies Of P. Well then: cast aside those ursine mitts, slip on a pair of immaculate white theatre gloves and get your thumbs into Enotria: The Last Song, which has a demo on Steam.

Aside from being a dry reflection of tabloid reporting on women who commit crimes (bad woman! sexy, bad woman!) this is also the kind of incidental character-building you can expect in this perky, retro-styled survival horror. It plays like Silent Hill charged with the hot pink body horror of Porpentine interactive fiction. And judging by my hour of unsettled strolling through the decrepit tube station of the game&#x27;s demo, it&#x27;s a powerful combo.

You answer the questions by looking ponderously down and pressing the big red and yellow buttons on the desk in front of you. The questions begin with relatively innocuous, CAPTCHA-style inquiries, such as &quot;is this a door?&quot; accompanied by a picture of a face. A few minutes later, there&#x27;s stuff like &quot;Are you alone?&quot; and &quot;Is it safe to be alone?&quot; and &quot;You are alone&quot; and yep, time to smash Pause or better, throw the Steam Deck behind the sofa and go stare out the window for a while.

                              <span>Roguelike FPS Wild Bastards is the space western follow up to 2019’s Void Bastards. It takes some of that game’s ideas, mainly those related to shooty and looty, and reforms them into a largely different can o’ campfire beans. This time, it’s less focused on exploration, more on individual, tense shoot-outs. You collect a cast of weirdos, each with different guns and abilities, and form the deadliest dang posse this side of the last tactical overworld map you descision&#x27;d your way through. I like what I&#x27;ve played so far, although I think a lot is going to hinge on how much evolution the mid-game offers. As always, here’s a Steam demo, if you want to be all contrary and &#x27;form your own opinions&#x27;. Pah.

                              <span>Witchy roguelike Hades 2 got a fresh update yesterday that sees a bunch of weapons getting stompier, thumpier, and, yes, whompier. It&#x27;s like the hammer of Hephaestus himself was put to work on the entire armory. The Moonstone Axe&#x27;s heavier attacks now channel faster, for one thing, which could make the most sluggish of the weapons a little more viable. I haven&#x27;t had a go at the re-jigged bashing yet myself but I trust from these patch notes it will be subtly noticeable.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve set aside some time this evening for Destiny 2&#x27;s latest expansion The Final Shape, which launched last night. My pal Liam suggested we play this evening because Bungie&#x27;s servers would inevitably go up in flames the moment it launched. And what do you know? The right decision was made. Are we smug about it? Yes. Anyway, the good news is that Bungie have put out a few of those fires, though there are still a few bugs to fix.

                              <span>Call me a Paranoid Android or a Suspicious Stanley, but when I ask a videogame developer a question and the videogame developer pauses for exactly 31 seconds and then says “no”, I tend to assume the answer is, in fact, “yes”. Or at least “it’s complicated”, to channel a bit of antique Facebook coyness. The Alters is a complicated game. It is a moody sci-fi extravaganza in which your character, beleaguered offworld miner Jan Dolski, has to create new versions of himself by branching off his own past timeline using a &quot;quantum computer&quot;, splitting the chain of events at trigger points by, say, having his younger self stand up to his domineering father rather than leaving home.

                              <span>Intel odhalil některé další technické detaily o svém připravovaném procesoru Lunar Lake. Půjde o novou generací mobilních procesorů Core Ultra, která navazuje na loňský Meteor Lake. Bude mít dva typy jader: efektivní E-jádra a výkonná P-jádra. Intel také prozradil, že půjde o kombinaci 4E+4P s vypnutým hyper-threadingem. Přidělování jednotlivých úloh závisí na operačním systému, jehož plánovač musí v reálném čase provádět úpravy nastavení vyvažující efektivitu s výpočetním výkonem v závislosti na intenzitě pracovní zátěže.</span>

                              <span>A popular GitHub repo and over 120 forks containing Switch emulation tutorials have been targeted by Nintendo. While most forks are now disabled, the main repository has managed to survive after being given the opportunity to put things right. Whether Nintendo appreciated the irony is unclear, but it appears that use of encoding as a protection measure to obfuscate links, was no match for the video game company&#x27;s circumvention skills.

                              <span>I was a diehard WipeOut player as a kid. Seriously, me and the boys used to roam the streets of Bradford looking for F-Zero players to bully, at least till the RollCagers rocked up and stole our lunch money. Mind you, I think I was probably less interested in WipeoUt&#x27;s racing than its trackside landscapes, which remain exquisite decades on - all those sweeping album-cover facades with their animate fixtures that thickened and solidified into full-blown peripheral cities as the series progressed. 


I am similarly hooked by the worlds of Ghosts Ehf&#x27;s Phantom Spark, which are a million lightyears from WiPeout in terms of their influences and atmosphere, much as the underlying hover-jockeying is a million lightyears away from WipeouT in terms of its gentleness and lack of combative elements. But these spaces are just as mesmerising to fly through and think about when not focussed on finding the perfect line through the next corner, or avoiding a patch of grass. Small wonder, given that the game&#x27;s art director is Joost Eggermont, whose streaking astral contraptions and &quot;small interactive moments&quot; I&#x27;ve long admired, but never managed to write about until now.

Then, I realised that some other people might be less enlightened than me about the whole ‘having limits’ things, and that there was a lot of money to be made hawking implants. Enter space strategy story-spewer Stellaris, specifically, it’s spost specent spee-LC The Machine Age. It adds many options for your space civs, most of which I’m too rusty with the ever-yawpening sandbox’s myriad nuances to appreciate. But what&#x27;s this? A new origin that lets you play as techno-religious corpo-cult obsessed with transcending the limits of their meat prisons through cybernetic augmentations? I recognise that from toys!

                              <span>Yes, I&#x27;ve played a portion of Elden Ring&#x27;s expansion Shadow Of The Erdtree and I think it&#x27;s brilliant. But there&#x27;s one thing I didn&#x27;t flesh out in the preview and that&#x27;s the DLC&#x27;s standalone levelling system, brought to our attention a month or so ago. Well, here I am to flesh it out! Be warned, though, the role of the system is a jarring thing to condense into words.

Life In Jars is this YouTuber I&#x27;ve followed for a while. He makes videos that might involve, say, scooping up some puddle water, leaving it in a sealed jar for a while, then coming back to it a few months later. He&#x27;ll report on the results, which are often tremendous. Look at the LIFE in that jar! The little wriggly lads just wriggling around. The blobs whose job is to float and squidge indiscriminately. A lovely bit of fauna sloshing about there, like a forest dwelling for those who implement the five-second rule. It&#x27;s a reminder that bog water is rather beautiful, actually.
Having spent three hours with Elden Ring expansion Shadow Of The Erdtree&#x27;s opening area, I can&#x27;t help but think of Life In Jars. What resides in the shadowy dome of the Big Tree is horrendous! Miserable! The forgotten creatures and their crumbling homes are grim. But oh my word, the shadows have spawned a beautiful disasterpiece. Just, errr, those other jars? The fun guys with the scoopy arms and little legs? Yeah. I have bad news.

                              <span>I usually avoid writing sentences that could easily be quoted on a Steam page, but the exquisitely satisfying sound that Grunn’s garden shears make is the exception. Please feel free to try any of these on for size: Grunn’s shear sound is the Wilhelm Scream of gardening equipment, sure to be referenced for decades to come. Grunn’s shear sound wormed its way past my eyes and into parts of my brain I’d previously assumed could only be accessed by either masterful ASMR or irresponsibly long Q-tips. I used to have anxiety, but now, my only fear in life is that Grunn’s grass will run out, so I no longer have a reason to click away with its shears. Play Grunn, innit. There are, by the way, lots of other things to like about it, although I cannot hear them over the wonderful sound of these shears.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been one month since the sound of engines began. The hardest track ever created in Trackmania was published by a team of mappers on May 4th, bringing an intimidating 16-floor tower called Deep Dip 2 into the racing game. It became a magnet for competitive drivers after a prize pool of over $30,000 was offered to the first three players to conquer its hellish heights. The prize has yet to be claimed. Even today, determined racers continue to bang their heads against the brutally designed course, featuring icy surfaces, curving rails, and perilous loop-the-loops that hang kilometres about the ground. Some players have parked their hopes and given up. But others persevere. The top three players have reached the final floor and currently stand shoulder to shoulder, eyes focused on the prize.

                              <span>If you heard loud swearing last night in the Watford area it may have been one of two things: 1) me cussing out my (borrowed) Steam Deck while stealthily accessing the wifi from outside a closed public library, as I don&#x27;t currently have broadband at home, or 2) me subsequently trying to make head or tail of Mech Engineer, in which you take charge of a mobile undersea metropolis and send squads of painstakingly assembled robosoldiers to semi-auto-battle squidgy alien fauna. 


Engineering a mech is a Herculean labour whose completion eludes today&#x27;s puny scientists, and Mech Engineer doesn&#x27;t aim to make life easier, whatever its putative status as a &quot;means of fun&quot;. Mech Engineer is a game with an attitude problem, frankly. I realised this on in-game day two, when the interface coughed up a bunch of damage reports presented as pieces of paper, which I then had to crumple up and toss away individually.

Where its offworld mining concern once dealt merely with steep drops and irate bugs, it’s since had to face down the robotic army of a rival mineral corp and an omnicidal alien plague. If the subsequent question is &quot;It used to be about the rocks, y&#x27;know?&quot; then DRG’s imminent Season 5 update, Drilling Deeper, is the answer.

Like A Dragon: Yakuza will be a six-part series following characters in the criminal underbelly of Kamurocho, set to straddle between two time periods: 1995 and 2005. The series &quot;showcases modern Japan and the dramatic stories of these intense characters, such as the legendary Kazuma Kiryu, that games in the past have not been able to explore,” said Amazon, who are releasing it through Prime Video, just like their Fallout series.

                              <span>We’ll never know exactly what sort of fiction Tom Clancy would have written if he was less interested in the calibre of specific bullets and their effiency at dismantling burgeoning socialist governments, and more so in the specific sigils required to blast a riot cop through a third story window. While charity shops across the land mourn this devasting loss to their paperback shelves to this very day, we do at least have a glimpse into what such a literary venture may have looked like. Oh, did you like that door? Was it your favourite door? Soz, pal. Strategy game Tactical Breach Wizards just hexed right through it with a new demo as part of Steam Next Fest. I’ve played it, and it’s very exciting stuff, not least for how differently it plays than what I’d expected.

                              <span>Devolver Digital has released an intriguing teaser for what appears to be a new project by Solar Ash and Hyper Light Drifter developer Heart Machine. The reveal is advertised for June 7, the day of the Devolver Direct showcase.
Heart Machine is currently working on Hyper Light Breaker, a 3D third-person co-op action game that is the spiritual successor to Hyper Light Drifter. Gearbox is publishing that game, confirming Devolver&#x27;s teaser is for something different. Based on this brief clip, it’s hard to gauge the nature of this game. It shows a sunset cityscape with a silhouette of a figure, the scene emblazoned with Heart Machine&#x27;s logo. But given the studio’s impressive pedigree, we’re excited and surprised to see a new title so soon.


The Devolver Direct airs on June 7 at 5 p.m. PT/8 p.m. ET. You can keep up with the other summer showcases with our evolving schedule of events. For more on Heart Machine, check out our extended preview for Hyper Light Breaker and our reviews of Solar Ash and Hyper Light Drifter.</span>

Editor Marcus Stewart got to do just that at a recent preview event, and he sits down with Wesley LeBlanc to unpack his time with the expansion and share new details about the experience.

I love Elden Ring. I played it for more than 150 hours. It was also my 2022 game of the year by a nautical mile. I loved it so much that I wrote a whole piece on having what I dubbed “post-Elden Ring depression.” That’s why its upcoming expansion, Shadow of the Erdtree, has been among my most anticipated games of 2024 and why I couldn’t wait to fly out to Los Angeles to play the first hands-on demo. Taking place in a special venue in the heart of the famous Hollywood Forever Cemetery (you read that right), I spent three hours freely roaming a po…</span>

                              <span>Pokud chcete provozovat Kubernetes na vlastním hardware, Rancher je jednoduchý a efektivní způsob, jak toho docílit. Umožní vám jednoduše vytvořit a spravovat Kubernets cluster na vlastních virtuálních serverech. Používat Rancher se naučíte na dalším školení Rancher – Kubernetes na vlastním hardware, které proběhne 17. a 18. června a uskuteční se hybridně, tedy v naší pražské školicí místnosti a zároveň online.</span>

No official explanation was provided, but global vulnerability to Indian court orders seems a likely trigger.

Likely to be the most significant action of its type ever in Belgium, the blocking measures coincide with a growing number of similar actions around Europe.

                              <span>Honestly, I turn my back on shooter-of-note Helldivers 2 for (checks calendar)... one, maybe two weeks, and you all go and transform a planet into a black hole. &quot;You&quot; being the players who completed the metagame&#x27;s last Major Order and successfully pumped the Terminid supercolony of Meridia full of an experimental &quot;Dark Fluid&quot; - which Super-Earth, incidentally, pinched from the Illuminate faction during the First Galactic War, aka Helldivers 1.
Now, Meridia has imploded and become a radiant, wailing, purple-fringed disc of pure nothingness, with triumphant players rudely ejected from orbit via emergency hyperspace jump, but subsequently allowed to return and gaze into the dark heart of their victory. Great work, Inferno-plungers. I&#x27;m sure the consequences of this will be neither cosmic nor horrible.

                              <span>Update: Card Bard appears to be a copy of a game by another developer, Dire Decks by kindanice. Dire Decks was released in 2023 on itch.io and was well received there. Kindanice has pointed out the direct likeness between their game and the one released on Steam under another name. Yikes. Thanks to our diligent commenters for catching this. We&#x27;ll try to find out more. 
Original article: The onslaught of fun Steam Next Fest demos you can play right now continues and will not relent. Card Bard is a deckbuilding roguelike shooter in which your wee gunman is seemingly frozen in abject terror as little pill-shaped baddies creep towards him like bacteria on a petri dish. Good thing you have a hand of cards, each one showing how many bullets will bop forth from your body when you select it. It&#x27;s surprisingly tough for something so pastel-paletted. I&#x27;m 10th on the leaderboard. You can probably beat that, right?

                              <span>In EA&#x27;s Desert Strike - released way back in the dim salvages of 1992 - you are a helicopter pilot scooting around a Sylvester Stallone reinvention of Iraq, shooting down tanks and fighters with guns and missiles while rescuing VIPs and fretting constantly about your wafer-thin armour and espresso-sized fuel reserves. It was a no-frills piece of Gulf War fanfic, complete with George Bush ending cameo, and a well-made shooter that used to drive me nuts on Sega Mega Drive.
Megacopter: Blades Of The Goddess is Desert Strike, but heavily Blood-Dragonified and with a big dollop of Airwolf to boot. Here, the enemy troops are naughty Reptoid aliens, the writing is scattershot-satirical (upgrades are bought with pizza tokens) and your helicopter houses the soul of a blood-drinking &quot;AZ-TECH&quot; goddess. Is it a nuanced parody of the Strike series? It doesn&#x27;t feel like it. Did I enjoy the demo? Yes. Does it have a crawling tentacle boss called Queen Oildusa? Also yes, and will you please stop asking questions so I can write the rest of this article.

                              <span>Since the death of E3, June has descended into a chaotic clusterfunk of trailers, broadcasts, announcements, and a generalised frenzy of publicity-seeking barking noises. Summer Game Fest has emerged as a hub for a lot of developers seeking eyes. The 2-hour show hosted by marketing man Geoff Keighley will be broadcasting on Friday, blasting you in the ocular nerves with, probably, a lot of games. However, most of these games will not be brand new, exciting reveals, said Keighley himself in a fresh Twitch Q &amp; A. &quot;There will be, definitely, new announcements,&quot; he said, &quot;but the show is largely focused on, I think, existing games that have new updates for fans.&quot; He&#x27;s mentioning this ahead of time, he said, to set expectations.

                              <span>I&#x27;m sure you could fill a bottomless pit with the things Larian decided not to add to Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3. One of those things was, in fact, a bottomless pit. Not just a bottomless pit, but a conveniently portable, Looney Tunes-esque hole into which you could seemingly chuck everything from items and equipment to characters. Speaking to me during the same interview in which they discussed long-abandoned plans for bringing back Baldur’s Gate 1’s Candlekeep, Larian CEO Swen Vincke and Baldur’s Gate 3 lead writer Adam Smith (RPS in peace) touched on the subject with tantalising brevity. Argh, if only I hadn’t had to run off and catch a taxi, I’d still be there now, discussing the many applications of a portable hole. Bypassing carrying capacity limits would just be the start of it.

                              <span>If you love cosy games where the biggest challenge is choosing between which farm utensil to place next to your barn doors, then Tiny Glade may be just the game for you. It&#x27;s a creative building game like The Sims 4 but with none of the fuss of actually controlling lives - and no quests, combat or arbitrary challenges of any kind.

Instead, Tiny Glade simply offers a meadow and tools with which to build. The vibe of the game is cottage-core at its finest, with enough whimsigoth finery that you&#x27;ll soon lament that you can&#x27;t actually live inside your glorious creations. I&#x27;ve played the charming demo as part of Steam Next Fest, and you&#x27;ll find some thoughts from my time with it below.

                              <span>A DIY engineer has created a realistic tank simulator that puts the average haptic controller to shame. The mechanical monster is jury-rigged to the top of an office desk and must be reloaded with a new shell after every shot. The recoil is terrifying. It&#x27;s operated by three people: one person drives the tank with a steering wheel and levers, another uses cranks to aim the gun barrel, and a third reloads the shells that eject automatically from the chamber after every desk-lifting blast. The &quot;shells&quot; in question are 2-litre bottles of fizzy drink, and the crew has set up a whole rack of these bottles for panicked reloading. If you are the kind of person who yearns for the immersion of the legendary Steel Battalion controller then you will get a definite buzz from watching the death machine in action below.

SGF is sort of already in motion - last week, Sony kicked off the proceedings with their latest State of Play showcase, but you can expect the majority of new videogame announcements from Friday 7th June with the Summer Game Fest 2024 Opening Showcase, a two-hour livestreamed event which starts at 10pm UK, 5pm ET and 2pm PT. I&#x27;ll be out there covering the whole sorry affair in LA from Thursday to Monday while the remainder of Rock Paper Shotgun hold the fort on London time.

                              <span>The remake of Riven, the sequel to Myst, arrives on June 25. This modernized version of the 1997 PC classic has been rebuilt from the ground up and is coming to PC and VR headsets.
Riven has been reimagined by its original creators at Cyan Worlds. The game now boasts full freedom of movement, updated gameplay, improved graphics, and reworked puzzles. It also introduces new content through characters, challenges, and storytelling.
See it in action in the game&#x27;s new trailer below: 


Riven will be available on PC, Mac, and Meta Quest 2 and 3. To learn more about how this remake came together, writer Adam Morgan visited Cyan World and spoke to its principal creators about the game in this in-depth feature.

                              <span>After teasing PC support tests earlier this year, the PC adapter for PlayStation VR2 arrives this August, the company has revealed. More specifically, the device will cost $59.99 and hit select retailers and PlayStation&#x27;s online store starting August 7. With this device, you can use the PlayStation VR2 hardware to play SteamVR games, including the critically acclaimed Half-Life: Alyx. 
Ironically, PlayStation gamers have been asking for a Half-Life: Alyx port for PlayStation VR (and now PlayStation VR2) for years. Though that still isn&#x27;t happening, this PC adapter at least allows players to use their PlayStation VR2 device to play the game through Steam. They can do the same with hundreds of other SteamVR games, like Fallout 4 VR and War Thunder.

                              <span>It’s been a while since we last got an update on Metal Slug Tactics, the turn-based strategy spin-off of the popular side-scrolling shoot &#x27;em up. The game was first announced during the online-only E3 2021 and has suffered a few delays since then with minimal updates. After a long wait, the game has finally reemerged with a new trailer and a fall 2024 launch window.
The new video shows off the game&#x27;s spin on tactics, with long-time stars Marco, Eri, Fio, and Tarma taking literal turns obliterating the opposition. The game sees players building squads of classic Metal Slug characters, each with unique loadouts of recognizable series weapons, to take on signature villains and bosses, like the warship in the video.


Metal Slug Tactics is developed by Leikir Studio and is published by Dotemu, the team behind TMNT: Shredder&#x27;s Revenge. Famed composer Tee Lopes (Shredder&#x27;s Revenge, Sonic Mania) is developing the game&#x27;s soundtrack. 
When first revealed, Metal Slug Tactics was only slated to launch for Switch and PC. Today&#x27;s trailer confirms that it&#x27;s also coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.</span>

                              <span>Kena: Bridge of Spirits is making the leap to Xbox in August. The 2021 action-adventure game has been available only on PlayStation and PC, and its move to Microsoft’s platform comes with some new in-game goodies.
As the debut title by Ember Lab, this story-driven action game stars Kena, a young spirit guide who must unravel the mystery of a destroyed village by helping lost souls move on to the afterlife. She’s assisted by the Rot, tiny, adorable spirits Kena can command to aid in puzzle-solving and combat. The game’s design draws inspiration from series such as The Legend of Zelda, while combat has shades of From Software’s Dark Souls. 
Kena hits Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One on August 15 for $39.99 and will include exclusive pirate-themed Rot hats, a Golden Rot skin, and a unique staff for Kena. A new physical premium edition will also be available and will consist of these items, a digital soundtrack, and an exclusive sticker sheet. The Xbox version also includes the Anniversary DLC update, which includes the Spirit Guide Trials, additional Kena outfits, and New Game+


We awarded Kena: Bridge of Spirits a 9 out of 10, with former editor-in-chief Andrew Reiner writing in his review, &quot;Bridge of Spirits stumbles a little in spots, yet confidently sprints into the heart of the adventure, rewarding the player with secrets galore and visuals that are almost always worth admiring. If you love Zelda-like games or are just looking for an experience that will make you smile every step of the way, you can’t go wrong with Kena: Bridge of Spirits.&quot; The game was also a sales success, recouping its development costs a month after its initial release in September 2021.

                              <span>This year&#x27;s Summer Game Fest showcase is happening this week, on Friday, June 7, at 2 p.m. PT/5 p.m. ET, and with more than 55 studios and publishers set to be featured at the event (including Play Days this weekend) this year, fans have been speculating on what they might see. That includes Kingdom Hearts fans, who have been hoping to see something related to Kingdom Hearts IV at SGF this year, given it&#x27;s been more than two years since its reveal. 
However, SGF host and creator Geoff Keighley thinks Kingdom Hearts fans should lower their expectations for the show. 
&quot;People keep asking about Kingdom Hearts, I don&#x27;t know why,&quot; Keighley says during a recent stream where he answered questions about SGF. &quot;I think it&#x27;s because we did [Final Fantasy VII Rebirth] last year or something like that. But yeah, people are setting themselves up for failure but you guys can keep hoping.&quot; 
Here&#x27;s a clip of it, too:

Now, Keighley could be playing coy, especially with the &quot;but you guys can keep hoping&quot; part at the end, but it&#x27;s more likely that he&#x27;s trying to nicely let Kingdom Hearts fans know that if they expect to see Kingdom Hearts IV during SGF, they might be disappointed. 
In the meantime, watch the Kingdom Hearts IV reveal trailer, and then read Game Informer&#x27;s exclusive interview with Tetsuya Nomura about Kingdom Hearts IV, the series&#x27; future with Final Fantasy, and more.

He told the LA Times this in a new interview, which is where he also said the studio has multiple single-player projects in development, as reported by VideoGamesChronicle.
&quot;I promise you, we will not be The Last of Us studio forever,&quot; Druckmann said, revealing the team is working on &quot;multiple single-player projects.&quot; He continued, adding, &quot;We create experiences that are steeped in story and characters, especially relationships. The stories have some sort of philosophical core that everything is going to revolve around and feed into.&quot;


Elsewhere in the interview, Druckmann told the LA Times he came up with the idea about a man and a girl crossing a post-apocalyptic landscape – the premise of …</span>

Did you know that the word &#x27;book&#x27; was originally spelled with several extra &#x27;o&#x27;s in it? This was changed when it was collectively decided that telling someone to &quot;please, just read a book&quot; was resulting in several more murders a year than anyone could be bothered to keep track of. This week, it’s Obsidian vet and Pentiment creator Josh Sawyer! Cheers Josh! Mind if we have a nose at your bookshelf?

In which case, wow, bold of Hugo Martin to cast himself as the Doom Slayer, but I like the moxy. Before I barge into the comments uninvited and argue with no-one in particular that Doom Eternal’s lateral expansion of its gameplay loop was ultimately a fantastic choice for the long-term health of the series, you swine, let’s read this week’s best writing about games (and game related things!)

                              <span>Spain&#x27;s Ministry of the Interior says eight people have been arrested after police dismantled a €5.3m pirate IPTV network serving local expats. Authorities aren&#x27;t naming the service but if the name TVMucho rings any bells, people are on the right track. That police identified the owner of the service is no surprise. The Dutchman has never hidden away and has continuously claimed his service operates legally. If only in part, it&#x27;s still streaming channels right now.

There I&#x27;m in my element due to a lifetime of Mario Kart, Diddy Kong Racing and Sonic &amp; All-Stars Racing Transformed. It&#x27;s those games that make me interested in Nightmare Kart, a PSX-aesthetic racing game which was formerly known as Bloodborne Kart, and which is out now.

                              <span>Turn-based tactical RPG Wildermyth is one of the best games Sin has ever played. It got a second DLC, Omenroad, which turned it into a roguelike earlier this month.

Omenroad turns out to be the end of the road, however, both for Wildermyth and - for now - for the team that made it, Worldwalker Games.

                              <span>It feels as if every action-RPG can be described in terms of its relationship to genre daddy Diablo. Wolcen:Lords Of Mayhem, for example, launched a few months after Diablo 4 was announced and helped to satiate some early click cravings. Briefly.

Early positive sentiment was quickly scuppered by bugs, slow updates and more. Now its developers say that they&#x27;re ending support for the game, and multiplayer functionality will be switched off this September.

                              <span>Merry weekends, everyone! It&#x27;s time for a chill couple of days, I think. A bunch of us have recently returned from trips down to the Brighton office to meet some new faces. Weird to think I&#x27;m now the most far-flung of the lot, living way up here in Glasgow. Maybe that&#x27;s why I elected to take over these Playing This Weekend posts, to help fill the friendless void growing inside my heart.
So just know that if you don&#x27;t sound off in the comments below with news of what you&#x27;re playing this weekend, the void in my heart will grow, until one day it consumes me. And then who will write these posts? Here&#x27;s what we&#x27;re clicking on this weekend!

He created Killer7, the No More Heroes series, worked with James Gunn (before he directed Guardians of the Galaxy or was put in charge of DC films) on Lollipop Chainsaw, and lots more. In preparation for his role as the keynote speaker at MomoCon this year, we caught up with him over e-mail to discuss his next game, Hotel Barcelona (a collaboration with Deadly Premonition creator Hidetaka &quot;Swery65&quot; Suehiro), remastering his 2011 game Shadows of the Damned, Batman, and more.
Game Informer: Hotel Barcelona is inspired by horror films. Are there specific films you cite as references?
Goichi &quot;Suda51&quot; Suda: There are a lot of them. Swery of White Owls is the main creator, so you should probably ask him …</span>

                              <span>On June 1, 1999, the first public release of Napster launched online, kick-starting a global piracy frenzy that never disappeared. At the same time, it can be argued that the file-sharing software paved the way for legitimate business models that would eventually evolve into subscription-based platforms such as Spotify and Netflix.

                              <span>It&#x27;s no secret that online piracy presents a major challenge to copyright holders. With owners of pirate sites largely unresponsive, search engines and other online intermediaries are often asked to intervene. With a starring role for anti-piracy company Link-Busters, Google has seen a significant surge in takedown requests, one that has set new records on the way.

                              <span>Data published by S2CPI, the body responsible for Spain&#x27;s administrative pirate site blocking program, shows that the number of headline domains blocked during Q1 2024 is noticeably down on the same period in 2023 and 2022. Overall, sites are still being blocked in large numbers, but the real growth isn&#x27;t found on main domains. Easily and quickly deployed at almost no cost, subdomains can circumvent blocking and Spain blocks them in their thousands.

                              <span>Toys for Bob, the developer of Crash Bandicoot 4 and the Skylanders series, has announced a publishing deal with Xbox for its next game. The studio recently went independent after splitting off from its former parent company, Activision Blizzard.
The studio states its new title is &quot;very early in development&quot; and that we won&#x27;t see it for some time. Whatever this game is, Xbox will be its home, which isn&#x27;t surprising since the studio teased it was exploring a relationship with the publisher a couple of months ago.
We&#x27;re excited to announce that we&#x27;ll be partnering with @Xbox to publish our next new game. We&#x27;re still very early in development, so you might not hear from us for a bit - but know that we&#x27;re working hard on an experience we&#x27;re so sooo inspired about!

Toys For Bob went independent in February, a few months after Microsoft acquired Activision Blizzard. The studio is seemingly getting to have its cake and eat it too, since it still gets to work with Xbox while being an autonomous entity. Prior to leaving Activision, Toys For Bob worked on the recent Crash Bandicoot games such as Crash Bandicoot 4: It&#x27;s About Time and Crash Team Rumble. It also developed the Spyro Reignited Trilogy and created the once-wildly popular Skylanders series.

                              <span>During Sony&#x27;s PlayStation State of Play, new gameplay and details were shared for Marvel Rivals. For the uninitiated. Marvel Rivals is a superhero (specifically Marvel superhero) team-based PVP shooter inspired by games like Overwatch. The footage, seen below, reveals Venom and Adam Warlock are coming to the game. The footage also shows a new location – the Tokyo 2099: Spider-Islands map.
Alongside the new gameplay details, the game is now also confirmed to be coming to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S alongside the previously confirmed PC platform. Developer NetEase is also planning a closed beta for the game in July. PlayStation beta testers will have exclusive access to Spider-Man&#x27;s Scarlet Spider cosmetic skin.

                              <span>Little Nightmares III, the horror action platformer from Supermassive Games, has moved into 2025. The game never had a specific release date, but we were admittedly expecting it this year. In a post on the official Little Nightmares III X account, the team shared the message below, writing, &quot;As much as we can&#x27;t wait for you to return to the Nowhere, we also want to make sure we give the game the care and love it deserves. Quality is a top priority for us, and we know you feel the same way. For this reason, we&#x27;ve made the decision to shift the release of the game to 2025.&quot;
Please do bear with us, little ones, for we need a little extra time to prepare your visit.

Notably, Supermassive, the developer behind games like Until Dawn (which is coming to PC and PlayStation 5 soon) did not develop the first two games. Those games were developed by Tarsier Studios, whose next project has not been announced.

                              <span>If you haven’t followed Infinity Nikki, it’s equal parts charming, beautiful, and ambitious. The open-world game is the latest entry in the Nikki series of fashion games, which is very popular in Asia, and Westerners are getting their biggest exposure to it yet with this charming adventure. 


The game unfolds on the magical continent of Miraland, and Nikki must save it. Her main power is &quot;styling,&quot; which involves changing clothes from different nations, allowing her to adopt unique abilities. For example, one outfit allows her to float while another cleanses corrupted creatures of demonic energy. The trailer shows one outfit that lets players summon a giant flower to glide through the air. Another ability shrinks her to the size of her small companion, Momo, to access tight areas and other locations. 
The more outfits you collect, the more abilities Nikki has to solve puzzles and overcome platforming obstacles. But despite the &quot;save the world&quot; premise, Infinity Nikki is billed as a relaxing adventure. You can also catch bugs, go fishing, and gather resources to craft new outfits, among other activities. 
Infinity Nikki looks wild, and fans can get their first taste of it in a beta test happening during Q3 of this year. The game is coming to PlayStation 5, PC, iOS, and Android but has no release window.</span>

                              <span>Developer Survios has released the first look at gameplay in its upcoming VR game, Alien: Rogue Incursion, and it turns out, exploring a seemingly abandoned  facility in VR looks as terrifying as you&#x27;d expect.
The trailer aired during today&#x27;s PlayStation State of Play as the game is coming to PS VR2, but it&#x27;s also coming to Meta Quest 3 and Steam (for other PC VR devices) this holiday season. In the trailer, we get a few glimpses of some Xenomorphs, the tracking device we&#x27;ll be using to avoid said Xenomorphs, and a look at some pods that indicate we might be fighting more than one. 
Check it out for yourself in the Alien: Rogue Incursion gameplay trailer below: 


In a new PlayStation Blog post, Survios chief product officer TQ Jefferson explains that Alien: Rogue Incursion was developed from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5. Jefferson also shares that the &quot;high tension shooter&quot; tasks players with exploring an &quot;overrun facility on the inhospitable planet Purdan.&quot; 
&quot;Dynamically spawning and pathing with countless unique possibilities, even we couldn&#x27;t tell you exactly where and when each Xenomorph will strike, let alone what strategies it might use or if it&#x27;ll bring some friends,&quot; the blog post reads. &quot;While heart-pounding combat is the core of Alien: Rogue Incursion, grabbing your pulse rifle and blasting your way out of every situation is not always the best strategy. 
&quot;Constantly hunted by unpredictable and resourceful Xenomorphs, players will often find creativity and a level head to be their greatest weapons, especially when it comes to leveraging the environment to their advantage.&quot;

                              <span>Until Dawn, the 2015 horror adventure game from Supermassive Games, is coming to PlayStation 5 and PC in remake form this fall. We received a new trailer for the beloved game alongside the announcement during today&#x27;s State of Play presentation. 
Until Dawn puts you in control of eight teenagers/young adults who venture up a mountain for a fun night in a secluded cabin. In typical slasher-movie fashion, there is much more than meets the eye regarding this cabin and its surrounding area. Relying heavily on player choice, Until Dawn&#x27;s narrative uses a system called the Butterfly Effect, where pivotal choices you make have consequences that go far beyond that which you can immediately recognize. The game stars actors like Rami Malek, Hayden Panettiere, Meaghan Martin, and more.


Originally announced as a full remake of the game, the trailer footage does not appear to be a significant step up in terms of visuals, appearing to be more in line with the industry&#x27;s definition of a remaster. PlayStation&#x27;s official description says it&#x27;s been &quot;rebuilt and enhanced for PS5 consoles and PC.&quot; Developed by Ballistic Moon, this improved version also boasts new environments, collectibles, and re-cut narrative sequences. 
We loved Until Dawn when it arrived on PlayStation 4 in 2015, awarding it a score of 9 out of 10. In the time since Until Dawn&#x27;s original release, Supermassive has released other games in the genre, including The Dark Pictures Anthology and The Quarry. The studio is currently working on The Casting of Frank Stone, a game set in the Dead by Daylight universe. Until Dawn arrives on PlayStation 5 and PC this fall.</span>

                              <span>It’s been a long time since we wrote about a new Dynasty Warriors game, but that changes today with the announcement of Dynasty Warriors: Origins, the new release from Koei Tecmo’s Omega Force studio, a team long known for work on the venerable franchise.
The games have an unusual identity and are, in some ways, a genre unto themselves. They almost always feature large-scale battles in which the lead character can sweep through dozens of enemy combatants with a single swing.
That playstyle appears to remain intact if this new trailer is to be believed.
A lot has changed in action gameplay in the years since Dynasty Warriors was at its most popular, but there’s no doubt that the series once had an enthusiastic fanbase.
We’ll see if the series is able to update its gameplay and draw in new fans when it hits PlayStation 5 next year.</span>

                              <span>Today&#x27;s State of Play concluded with the reveal of a new Astro Bot game. Unlike the last entry, Astro&#x27;s Playroom, which was a PS5 launch title and a glorified (but very fun) tech demo for the console, this new game is a full-fledged platforming adventure. It&#x27;s also got an easy-to-remember name: Astro Bot. 
The trailer sees Astro Bot soaring through the galaxy on a Dual Sense-shaped spaceship to explore a variety of vibrant platforming stages set to a smile-inducing soundtrack. He also shows off new abilities like donning gloves that fire springs to grab and swing enemies, soaking water like a sponge to grow gigantic, and, best of all, just a random Parappa the Rappa reference (among other PlayStation franchises). It looks delightful, and we want to play it. 


A PlayStation Blog post also states the game features over 80 levels across 6 galaxies, 20 new abilities, and 70 new enemy types. Astro Bot will be available on PlayStation 5 on September 6. Our review of Astro&#x27;s Playroom can be found here.</span>

                              <span>The remake of Silent Hill 2 has a new trailer and a release date of October 8. Surprisingly, this news comes during Sony’s State of Play instead of the Silent Hill Transmission airing later tonight. 
Regardless, we aren’t complaining about seeing more of Bloober Team’s remake of the PS2 classic. The trailer provides new looks at gameplay and the psychological scares that made the first game so beloved. 


Silent Hill 2 is coming to PlayStation 5 as a console exclusive as well as PC.</span>

                              <span>Capcom has pulled back the curtains on Monster Hunter Wilds, revealing gameplay in a brand new trailer that aired during today&#x27;s PlayStation State of Play. In this trailer, we watch a monster hunter ride through a treacherous sandstorm on the back of a mount before starting a fight with a lion-like bear creature, and as you might expect, it looks great. 
We then watch our hunter fight a rocky toad monster in a cavernous canyon area before three buffalo-esque monsters join the fight. If you&#x27;ve played a Monster Hunter before, you have a good idea of what Wilds looks like – big, flashy, and exciting. 
Check it out for yourself in the Monster Hunter Wilds trailer below: 


This is our first look at Monster Hunter Wilds since its reveal at The Game Awards 2023 last December. Those with Monster Hunter World and Monster Hunter World: Iceborne save date will get exclusive in-game rewards. The trailer also reiterates that Monster Hunter Wild hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC in 2025.

Announced a few weeks back, Redfall game update 4 introduces a much-requested offline mode and single-player pausing, together with some new progression features and activities: a Community Standing bar whereby Support currency can be spent on rewards from the Safehouse Skill tree, and Elder Nests, aka vampire nests with specially modified vampire bosses. That&#x27;s in addition to new enemy encounters in Redfall Commons, improved AI and a new Unrivaled Weapon.

Skald is terrific. I&#x27;ve tried to come up with a clever angle on its journey, but they all wind up saying the same thing: For all its retro stylings (right down to party portraits taking up an unnecessary quarter of the screen at all times), it&#x27;s an accessible, charming treat, and the best modernisation of 80s RPGs that I&#x27;ve ever played.

                              <span>I fear we may have swum the Rubicon of diminishing returns where multiplayer horror games inspired by Lethal Company are concerned. The recent Content Warning has sucked up all the remaining oxygen in the room, and oxygen is pretty important in Murky Divers, for reasons that are hopefully self-evident. Still, Murky Divers has some fairly eye-catching USPs. It&#x27;s got underwater physics, of course, and it puts you and - unhelpfully - your friends in charge of a submarine.

                              <span>There is a time for perfect clarity in a shooter, for clean walls and clear-cut character silhouettes. But this is not it. Retro first-person gunwaltzer Selaco is a messy machine gun dash through an office exploding with glass, concrete, splinters, and sparks. The glock-toting wreckage &#x27;em up first hit our radar when it was announced as a modern combination of F.E.A.R. and Doom, promising both the fiendish AI enemies of the former and the satisfying blasting of the latter. Well, it&#x27;s out today. Bursting forth into the corporate lobby of early access with uzis akimbo, peppering the walls with angry bullets. Good, I say.

                              <span>In Mike Judge’s 1999 cult comedy Office Space, there’s a scene where Ron Livingston’s Peter - a programmer working a tedious corporate job - visits a hypnotist. “Is there any way that you could, sorta, just zonk me out so I don’t know that I’m at work, in here,” Peter asks of the hypnotist, pointing to his head. “Could I come home and think that I’ve been fishing all day, or something?”. That’s basically the high-level concept for brilliant sci-fi comedy show Severance, right there. Not wanting to spoil any more than I absolutely have to, I’ll present you with two facts up top. 1. It features a touching queer relationship between John Turturro and Christopher Walken and 2. It’s some of the best television I’ve seen in the last few years. Throw in some Stanley Parable, Control, Gilliam’s Brazil, and some more meta undertones of general musing on gamified reward loops, and you’ve got Severance.

                              <span>Between this, my supporter post later, and the fact I decided to watch Office Space again this week, I’d like to make it clear to any colleagues or management reading that I value and love them all dearly, and am 110% committed to the eternal grind machine of covering videogames online. Workday malaise is universal, however, whether or not you’re lucky enough to enjoy your job as much as I do. Enter Office Fight, a stylish physics action game where you, a ghost, posess office equipment to cause as much physics-based chaos as possible. The PR did some Office Space jokes in the email, so I pretty much had to cover it. At least once I realised what they were doing, after initially just thinking they were being a massive donkey.

The topic, comedy rock RPG/door-kicking sim Deathbulge: Battle of the Bands, was picked by a sadly absent Alice B, but you know what they say when beloved colleagues become ensnared in the kind of Kafkaesque employment limbo that only a corporate acquisition can engineer: the show must go on. We’re therefore sticking to the schedule, and will launch the liveblog at 4pm BST today, Friday May 31st.

                              <span>Riot games have committed to a series of new measures to curtail harassment and hate-speech in the Valorant community. In a video entitled ‘Keeping Our Community Healthy // Dev Updates,” studio head Anna Donlon took to Xitter to outline the new measures for the competitive FPS. Below is a graphic detailing the changes, which include new penalties such as hardware bans for offenders, and an expanded role for the game&#x27;s Voice Evaluation tech, which monitors chat for bad behaviour. “If you want to make evil statements under the guise of &#x27;[naughty word SEO doesn&#x27;t like being in the first paragraph] talk&#x27;, you aren&#x27;t welcome here,” writes the official Valorant account.

It showed off more of how its lovely desert environments morph to fit the weather and how its inhabitants largely don&#x27;t get on. We also got a look at some cursed lions, an armoured frog with an unsettling tongue and a rideable Chocobo-esque mount that lets you ping arrows on the fly. Let me break it down for you readers, as someone who is increasingly excited at the prospect of more colourful pants.

The morning is cloudy but bright and calm, the north London suburbs are a blissful checkerboard of red roofs and flourishing lawns, hope glistens faintly in the gutters and ditches beside the tube. How unlike the innards of Centum, a point-and-click horror game (Steam page here) that begins with a dreary retro desktop interface on which there are curious text files, curioser decryption tools and most curious of all, an .exe of some kind that drops you into a simulation consisting of a stone prison chamber. Hang on, I&#x27;m changing trains...

                              <span>My PC has a big white case, and sometimes, I sit and think: “big white box good!” But other times, I glance over to my PS5 and think: “other big white box also good!” Then I start getting fanciful and imagine a lovely future where they can both combine into one. Keeping track of two big white boxes is hard! Luckily, I only have to write about one of those big white boxes for RPS the vast majority of the time. Today is one of the rare occasions I do have to cover both, so here’s everything announced at yesterday’s Playstation State Of Play that you, the discerning big white box owner, might find relevant:

                              <span>Sony have dropped a trailer and release date for Concord at their latest State Of Play, Concord being a new 5V5 multiplayer FPS in which you play a bunch of freegans carrying out heists on various loudly coloured alien planets. Sorry, not freegans - freegunners. Freeganism is a portmanteau of &quot;free&quot; and &quot;vegan&quot; referring to people who fish jars of near-spoiled hummus out of supermarket dumpsters according to an ideology of minimal resource consumption. Freegunners, meanwhile, are lairy Guardians Of The Galaxy-alike mercenaries with phat guns and playstyle-defining secondary abilities. They do not consume hummus as far as I know. The game is out 23rd August 2024, with a beta happening in July, and I&#x27;ve got an overview trailer for you below.

                              <span>Per last night’s Sony State of Play, PS5 darling and supposedly rather good action-dad adventure God of War Ragnarök is coming to PC on September 19th 2024. The good news is that the port, co-developed by Jetpack Interactive and original makers Santa Monica Studio, will pack in all the DLSS 3, FSR 3, and ultrawide what-have-yous that one might expect from a big, monied PC release. The bad, silly, clearly pointless news is that it will need a PlayStation Network (PSN) account, despite the complete lack of multiplayer.

                              <span>Reddit is not required to hand over to filmmakers the IP-addresses of several Redditors who made piracy-related comments. A California federal court denied the filmmakers&#x27; request for a &#x27;de novo&#x27; review, after turning down their initial request in February. While this is bad news for the movie companies, a viable alternative appeared recently.

My personal reputation is great only among people who love mushrooms and hate deer. It&#x27;s been long enough that I should probably be a fierce warlord running a large chunk of the kingdom in opposition by now, but instead, I have the skillset of fifty peasants, and the outstanding work of fifty three. And I know why. Bellwright has taught me what I already knew in theory, but had not truly appreciated:
Good managers are rare and precious. And I&#x27;m not one of them.

Apple had just released their new electric barnacle scrubber, and sailors everywhere were trading sacks of freshly minted coins just for a solitary sweet sniff at one of the delightfully compact and sleekly designed charger cables. Of course, too-many-toes Jackson and myself had seen tell of this upcoming gold rush, written in crab trails on the sand, which is what we had instead of the stock market in them days.

                              <span>Kill Knight, the silly-named twin stick action game you may have caught at similarly silly-named event The Triple-I Initiative in April, is joining this year&#x27;s Steam next fest with a demo ahead of its expected release date later this year. I’ve played it, and I feel must apologise, Mr. Knight. I still think it&#x27;s a silly name, but with frantic flowing action this immediately gratifying, you can call yourself whatever your killy little heart so desires. For this knight is not like other knights: this is a knight who kills. Wait, they all do that? Oh. Well, this one has four guns. Suck it, literally every other knight.

                              <span>Destructive third-person action game Just Cause is getting made into a movie, produced by the men behind The Fall Guy and Nobody, according to the Hollywood Reporter. This isn&#x27;t the first time the over-the-top explode &#x27;em up has been in line to get the big screen treatment. Another version spent years in development hell until the rights lapsed. But it&#x27;s been picked up again by Universal, who are no strangers to turning video games into box office burger bucks (they did The Super Mario Bros. Movie). So, it might result in an actual movie this time.

                              <span>The demo for puzzle game Schim, in which you play as a boy and his frog that only exists in the shadows, is out now on Steam. I’ve given it a whirl, and its pretty froggin’ delightful. The game has you progress through different scenes set in a chill, colorful townscape. You can switch at any time between boy and frog. The boy can go anywhere, but is frequently blocked by environmental puzzles. The frog has the means to solve such puzzles, by hopping between shadows naturally cast by the environment. They act like little inky puddles, and simply jumping from one to the other is a rare joy.

                              <span>Understanding any given sentence in Wuthering Waves is like trying to discern sensible meaning from the back of a rain-bleached Doritos packet you found while cleaning your gutters. Last week, players of the character action gacha asked for more freedom to skip story scenes and dialogue. Having sunk a bunch of hours into the game, I can see why. The combat may be swish and the traversal across its rolling landscape flowing and carefree, but the lore-obsessed babble of its characters is mind-numbing. Wuthering Waves has been this month&#x27;s lightning rod for hype. But it&#x27;s worth dissecting what it&#x27;s actually like to play.

                              <span>Readers, I appear to have locked myself in self-referential language matrix trying to describe the feeling of playing top-down action shooter Kickback. You can only move through the recoil from shooting, you see, which means facing the opposite way to where you want to go. It’s both  very counterintuitive and very fun. To call something both counterintuitive and fun seems, well, counterintuitive. But also: fun. Which, as a concept is very fun to think about. But, also, quite counterintuitive. Writing such a incredibly redundant paragraph is quite fun, even though I’m just repeating myself. Counterintuitive, right? I’m going to try to escape this paragraph now. If I manage it, I’ll see you in the one below.

                              <span>An Activision lawsuit targeting a group of Call of Duty cheat makers has ended with a $14.5m judgment in favor of the plaintiffs. The defendants, all linked to Germany-based EngineOwning UG, initially put up a spirited defense against alleged violations of the DMCA, Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and civil RICO, among others. By last summer, all defendants had disengaged from the legal process. At the time of writing, EngineOwning is selling its latest MWIII and Warzone cheat.

Last December, CCTV footage revealed a figure in black spray-painting the words &quot;free movie&quot; time and again. The damage to the culturally significant building was meant to advertise a pirate video site.

Next update Adrift is taking things right the way back, though, by emptying the expansive cosmos of almost everything except you, your ship and planets to visit.

                              <span>A PC adapter for Sony’s PlayStation VR2 has recently popped up in South Korea, giving a new update - albeit an unofficial one - on the incoming PC support for the PS5 VR headset teased earlier this year.

                              <span>It’s been a little while since we last heard about the untitled open-world driving game from Maverick Games, the studio opened a couple of years back by ex-Playground Games veterans including former Forza Horizon 5 creative director Mike Brown. We still don’t know what the team’s new game is called or when it might hit the road, but we have been given a few more snippets of what to expect and news on who’ll be helping pump up its tires and fill it with fuel as publisher.

                              <span>We have been cursed with a terrible devouring monster. Each harvest, one villager must don the ceremonial, mildly magical mask, and enter the fields alone, to gather the precious life-giving ambrosia before the beast can befoul it. For five nights you must do battle, or evade its ravenous clutches.
Those of you who have known your own Devourer are surely thinking: Only five nights per year? Luxury. Harvest Hunt is good, though.

                              <span>Many moons ago, premiere wordsman Nate Crowley reviewed shark ‘em up Maneater, decrying its incurious perpetuation of anti-shark propaganda, and calling it “an ecstatically violent simulation of being a fool&#x27;s idea of a shark.” My own frothing penchant for the plan-schemes of Warhammer’s Skaven ratboys has been documented in these pages to the point of rabidity, but I do feel broadly similarly about media that sullies rats - clean, smart and good folk that they are. Lively tactics Trash Of The Titans does not aim to emancipate its villainous vermin. But, like Warhammer, it gets a pass for its evident affection towards its antagonistic dumpster diving scuttlers. Also, it&#x27;s just plain fun.

                              <span>A producer on Kerbal Space Program 2 has confirmed that those working on the space flight sim are being laid off en masse. We already knew that the developers at Intercept Games would be losing their jobs thanks to a closure announcement from Washington State. Until remarks from Strauss Zelnick, the CEO of Take-Two Interactive, muddied the waters. Zelnick refused to acknowledge that the studio was being closed when asked by a reporter, even going so far as to claim the opposite. &quot;We didn&#x27;t shutter those studios,&quot; he told IGN. But it seems clear from one producer&#x27;s testimony that Zelnick&#x27;s remarks are inaccurate.

                              <span>I have played many a creepy throwback game that takes inspiration from the ever inadequately named &quot;Golden&quot; (Grimy and Diseased? Cadaverous, perhaps) Age of survival horror on PS1, but it&#x27;s rare you play one that invokes the N64, and even less often that you stumble on something horror-adjacent that riffs on Star Fox 64. Ah, Star Fox! The natural companion piece for, say, Eternal Darkness or The Suffering. In fairness, I did always find those Pez dispenser dialogue animations pretty eerie.

                              <span>To kick off with some extremely half-arsed mytho-geometry, the original Frostpunk was a testament to both the design utility and the inexhaustible political symbolism of circles. When people wish to found a community of equals they commonly form a circle, with each participant visible and audible to the rest. A circle is also the best shape for defending against an engulfing ambient threat such as a global ice age, because it has no weak points, and it makes a great centrepiece for a videogame interface, a symmetrical motif that can be tuned and adorned to either suck your attention into the screen or distribute it evenly in all directions.
Created by Polish developers 11 bit, Frostpunk takes place in the middle of a circle, an Arctic crater with a huge coal generator at its heart. Your city rises in rings around that generator, each additional layer of dwellings corresponding intuitively to decreasing temperature, and the result is one of the most focused and thematically consistent specimens of its genre - a building game that feels as intimate and urgent as tending a campfire. Frostpunk 2&#x27;s new campaign mode breaks the circle open. It starts where you (hopefully) ended, with the crater now fully colonised and evolved into a glaring, blue-orange geode of high-density housing and clustered chimneys. But the view has been pulled back, and construction now unfolds along the plains and canyons beyond the crater, which consist not of circles but of hexagons - another UI designer&#x27;s favourite - on which you&#x27;ll plot out upgradeable districts rather than assembling individual buildings.

                              <span>The first scene in RPS Game Club pick Deathbulge: Battle Of The Bands - a genuinely funny and innovative riff on turn-based RPGs -  sees candyfloss n’ superglue-haired guitarist Faye frantically search for her missing guitar as the crowd for the titular battle grow impatient. You’ll quickly realise this a school-with-no-trousers-esque dream sequence, but the matted mess of thick black cables that carpet this dingy side-stage is painfully accurate. Pissing around with gear is roughly 70% of the band experience, in my limited experience of being in bands. This probably changes when you’ve got roadies or dedicated tech people, but we did not, because we were skint. And also terrible. Several hours of Deathbulge has brought me more joy than several years of being in actual bands. I had some isolated good times in some of those bands, but I’m having a very good time with Deathbulge.

                              <span>A whopping 1000 corpses have been found in our ongoing investigation into Anthology of the Killer, Rock Paper Shotgun can reveal. The bodies were discovered in the aforementioned murder mystery &quot;video game&quot;, which is out now on itch.io. Following our previous reports we can confirm that exposure to the game&#x27;s crime-infested city can cause severe disorientation, confusion, uncontrolled fits of laughter, and moderate enlightenment. The streets here are so dense with crime that entire apartment blocks must shutter at night. When Rock Paper Shotgun reported the 1000 corpses to detectives, we were told this was &quot;normal&quot; and &quot;appropriate&quot;.

Sounds like a solid confirmation from me, though Microsoft and Activision have yet to start bellowing the news from any of Call of Duty’s official pulpits.

The claim was casually corroborated by trustworthy sort Andy Robinson of VGC. Note the wording here, which suggests a bundle package of sorts, similar to the rumoured original plan for the remakes of Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil 3.
