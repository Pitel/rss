                              <span>Grab a pizza slice, kick back, and watch us take on the Foot Clan in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge! Tribute Games and Dotemu’s throwback to the classic TMNT brawlers is out today, and a group of Game Informer editors will tackle the game live on Twitch today at 2 p.m. Central.
Shredder’s Revenge is a new adventure inspired by the 1987 TMNT cartoon. Up to six players team up to battle over a dozen stages to fold Shredder’s evil schemes. If you’re a fan of brawlers, Shedder’s Revenge hits all the right notes. In my 8.75 out of 10 review, which you can read here, I described the game as a “polished, raucously fun throwback that plays better than how I remember the original games.”

We’ve been hearing about Overwatch 2 since 2019, but nearly three years later, the game still hasn&#x27;t been released. Through tumultuous development and terrible company-culture news out of Activision Blizzard, the Overwatch 2 development team has continued working on the game. As revealed on Sunday, the competitive multiplayer component will launch into early access on October 4. Today, Blizzard gave fans an additional glimpse of what to expect when this highly anticipated shooter sequel launches. We also hopped on a call with the Overwatch 2 te…</span>

                              <span>This past week, we&#x27;ve witnessed an obscene amount of trailers featuring promising upcoming games, many of which are coming from talented independent developers. Events like Steam&#x27;s Next Fest even let us get our hands on playable slices to better understand what these games are and how they play. Starting next week, Xbox will again be offering playable demos for indie titles in a week-long event that console players can dive into and experience the near future for indie gaming.
The ID@Xbox Summer Game Fest Demo Event will run from June 21 through June 27 and includes over 30 game demos for gamers to try out. In the blog post announcing the event, Xbox reminds readers that these are the equivalent of &quot;show floor&quot; demos and are a work in progress. Each of the participating demos will only be available during the days of the demo event and will be taken down after. Because these games aren&#x27;t complete yet, the blog also asks players to share their feedback with developers to help make the best game possible.
Xbox isn&#x27;t ready to share the full list of games for the event yet but did provide four titles that will be included.
Batora: Lost Haven
Broken Pieces
Severed Steel
Tinykin
Some of these game demos are available through Steam Next Fest (or are out on PC already), so if you have a capable PC and can&#x27;t wait until next week, you can take a peek at these games early.</span>

                              <span>Digimon Survive makes its way to stores in July, and a new English trailer gives fans a gameplay overview for the visual novel meets strategy title.
The story centers on protagonist Takuma Momozuka, a student on a school camping trip where he and his friends find their way to the Digital World. Each finds a Digimon partner – with Takuma befriending Agumon – and must find a way back to their world. The game’s drama unfolds in a visual novel style, and players can use a cellphone to scan the environment for hidden clues. Combat adopts a turn-based strategy format complete with a grid battlefield. The video also shows off the evolution chart displaying the digivolution paths your critters can take.


Digimon Survive launches July 29 for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.</span>

                              <span>During his Summer Game Fest Showcase, Geoff Keighley was going to surprise reveal The Last of Us Part I, the long-rumored remake of the 2013 title. However, PlayStation seemingly had other (accidental) plans as the publisher leaked everything about Part I hours before its official reveal. 
Keighley and The Last of Us director Neil Druckmann took shots at PlayStation during the showcase, and it was clear the two were upset about the leak. Nonetheless, The Last of Us remake is real, and it’s out on Sept. 2. With all that behind it now, fans have begun to focus on the visual updates of Part I, which has seemingly split the community.

First, Capcom released a free update for Resident Evils 2, 3 and 7 Biohazard which introduced ray tracing and higher framerates. Unfortunately, the update also broke every existing mod for those games, with no quick fix available.

All&#x27;s well that ends well, though. In response to &quot;overwhelming community response&quot;, Capcom have made the previous versions of the games available again, so that those wishing to use mods can roll back if they wish.

Point is: while writing this post about how much I adore the speedrunning FPS, several times I&#x27;ve had ideas about how I might make that record time even faster, so I&#x27;ve stopped writing, dropped into Neon White for a few minutes, and come back out with a new record. I adore this game, and I might never finish this post.

                              <span>My biggest question about Starship Troopers Colon Terran Command was what tone it would strike. The RTS potential for an interplanetary ground war against overwhelming swarms of giant not-insects is obvious enough. But the dual spirit of most Paul Verhoeven films is a major reason that The Extraordinary Lust Of Dizzy (working title: Starship Troopers) still holds up 25 years on.


Terran Command understands that. Certainly it nods to the satire here and there, but mostly it focuses on the shooting and desperate defences and evacuations instead. This was the right decision. Though it&#x27;s a little short on narrative flavour, unless you&#x27;re really into exploring the setting, it&#x27;s got enough tactical heft to make up for it.

Imogen (RPS in peace) spoke with him earlier this year about the game&#x27;s gaslamp fantasy setting and why they chose to enter the survival genre gauntlet, among many other things. At this year&#x27;s Summer Geoff Fest, I caught up with Flynn for another quick chat. This time, we dug into the game&#x27;s recently revealed card crafting and realm-hopping features, as well as the choices you might make along the way.

Rebecca from our guides team has been doing exhaustive work doing live chats and roundups for almost all the streams, and Edders was actually out in Los Angeles to play some games and chat to people.

We play as a potato dodging around waves of aliens while blasting them with sticks, stones, guns, knives, rocket launchers, and weird mutations. I mean it as a great compliment when I say the roguelikelike arena survive &#x27;em up feels like a Newgrounds game.

It’s a compilation of eight smaller games, some new and some reworked elements of previous games. These range from assembling Gundam-esque models to the tile-matching from Exapunks, now with an added single–player campaign. Of course, there’s two solitaire games thrown in for good measure too. Check out Zachtronics’ last hurrah in the trailer below.

It was amazing when I played its early build last year, and its Steam Next Fest demo is somehow even better. How could it not be! Have you seen it? Anger Foot is a game about kicking doors at muppet men. That’s it. That’s the pitch. It rules.

                              <span>Farthest Frontier, which arrives on Steam Early Access on August 9th, sounds as much of a statement of intent as it does the name of a city-building game. It’s a combination of town management and survival sim, putting you in the presumably cheap clogs of a band of settlers trying to make a go of it in the wilderness. A story trailer for Farthest Frontier was shown at last weekend’s PC Gaming Show, which you can watch below.

During the Overwatch 2 Reveal Event this morning, Blizzard elaborated (somewhat!) on its free-to-play launch and what&#x27;s in the content pipeline for this live-service sequel.
If you&#x27;ve been waiting to hear more about PvE, welp, that wasn&#x27;t the focus of today&#x27;s stream — and the new story missions won&#x27;t be playable until 2023 — but we&#x27;ve got a roadmap for PvP and confirmation that loot boxes are out and a battle pass format is in.
Coming off of Overwatch 1, the team&#x27;s main goal is to try and deliver content on a &quot;frequent and consistent basis,&quot; according to game director Aaron Keller.
Currently, they&#x27;re committing to major updates every nine weeks, starting with the launch on October 4. &quot;Players can expect to see a new hero every other season, with elements l…</span>

Today sees the launch of nostalgic smack-&#x27;em-up Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder&#x27;s Revenge, (you can check out our review right here), but while the Heroes in a Half-Shell have only just returned to the streets, fans are already poking the developer squad on the possibility of post-release DLC.
In an interview with Xbox Expansion Pass, Tribute Games&#x27; Yannick Belzil was asked about the possibility of alternate character skins, for example, the turtles&#x27; penchant for trilbies and overcoats. In a response that makes perfect sense, Belzil noted that the distinct animated style of Shredder&#x27;s Revenge prevents the team from altering the sprites too much, and thus alternate costumes are unlikely to be on deck, now or at anytime in the future.
https://youtu.be/GemOAwU-9fo
However, following some misleading &quot;No DLC at all&quot;-style headlines, Dotemu&#x27;s Cyrille Imbert took to Twitter to clarify that while there are currently no plans for post-launch content, factors such as public perception and player feedback could decide whether the team returns to Shredder&#x27;s Revenge at some point in the future. I&#x27;m sure, right now, they&#x27;d just like to rest up after a job well done.
Put simply: There are no DLC plans now. There could be in the future.
TMNT: Shredder&#x27;s Revenge is a solid and fun brawler, but there is room, should Dotemu decide, for additional modes — such as Time Attack, Boss Rush, Endless, or 1CC. The TMNT lore runs deep, so should Tribute Games choose to add extra stages and/or characters, it would be understandably welcomed by fans. But all of this is putting the cart well before the horse. The game isn&#x27;t even a single day old yet. But for those players who prefer the chase to the catch (seemingly all modern video game fans), know that future content ideas haven&#x27;t been flushed down the sewer just yet.
TMNT: Shredder&#x27;s Revenge launches today on PS4, PC, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch.

Amazon&#x27;s Prime Day is coming up, where it offers a bunch of deals specifically for its subscribing members. On the games side of things, that includes a few freebies. And this year the lineup is pretty good, as Prime members can get a copy of Mass Effect Legendary Edition and some Star Wars games for the low, low price of free.
In an Amazon blog, the company reveals some of the games arriving as freebies for Prime Day. Mass Effect Legendary Edition is a big one, as that&#x27;s all three Mass Effect games and their single-player DLC, packing the whole trilogy into one launcher. If that gets you eager for space action, there&#x27;s also a few Star Wars games on offer too: Star Wars Jedi Knight - Jedi Academy, Jedi Outcast, and Republic Commando. Or, for gearheads, there&#x27;s Need for Speed Heat and GRID Legends.

It&#x27;s a fun week on Nintendo Switch, as several bigger games are coming out day and date with other platforms. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge is arguably the biggest one, followed by Neon White. Fall Guys is also going free-to-play on June 21 on Switch, and Omori is out too on June 17.
As a result, there&#x27;s not a ton coming out, but that&#x27;s for the best! It&#x27;s been a generally exhausting week, and Turtles plus Neon White should last people a while, and serve completely different audiences. Plus you can share in the experience of booting up Fall Guys for a few days and then putting it on ice for a while.

Sometimes, the heart and the head force two and two together and still somehow come up with five. Despite the eager finger-crossing of fans, Capcom has confirmed that its upcoming prehistoric sci-fi shooter Exoprimal is not connected to the universe of missing-in-action horror franchise Dino Crisis.
Game director Takuro Hiraoka finally put the kibosh on the rumor in a recent interview with IGN, referring to Exoprimal scientifically as &quot;its own unique thing.&quot; Explaining further, it seems that the design team went with the reptilian overlords simply because they wanted the player to take on a foe that could truly be considered mankind&#x27;s most ruthless, dangerous, and towering predator to date.

                              <span>I hope it stays interesting that whole time
The jury is still out on Sonic Frontiers, as an array of takes are swirling from folks who have played it. For now, we can look at some facts. The Sonic Frontiers length is looking like &quot;20-30 hours&quot; according to director Morio Kishimoto (who spoke to IGN).
Naturally, that length is variable. Kishimoto also claims that it&#x27;ll take &quot;double&quot; that length to clear everything and go for 100%, and a &quot;character progression&quot; system (which involves a skill tree and leveling) is supposed to keep people playing through that journey. For reference, Sonic Forces (the last mainline 3D Sonic) is roughly four hours long, and it takes around 20-ish hours to fully 100% it. 3D Sonic games typically range from five to 10 hours depending on the entry, so &quot;20-30&quot; is a massive shift, due in part to the &quot;open world&quot; focus.
It&#x27;s really easy to be skeptical of how this will turn out. Shifts to massive open worlds don&#x27;t always work out, as &quot;character progression&quot; alone might not be enough to propel players through a 100% completion, much less one campaign clear. The entire world needs to be interesting as well, and offer unique sidequests as well as a general sense of wonder and firm level design to ground the exploration.
Based on what we&#x27;ve seen, it&#x27;s iffy whether or not that&#x27;ll end up being the case. More so than anything, the open world design is the most make-or-break thing for me.

Following on from its official reveal at last week&#x27;s Summer Game Fest showcase, Naughty Dog has begun slowly drip-feeding new details and clips pulled from its upcoming remake The Last of Us Part I — yesterday, the studio shared footage of one of its redesigned character models, Tess.
The incredibly brief clip, posted to the official Twitter, features a side-by-side comparison of the hardened smuggler as she appears in both the original release of The Last of Us and the new remake. While the animation frames are clearly 1:1, the character model is, frankly, stunning. Tess looks far more her requisite years, with visual weathering yet steely reserve deserved of a woman who has fought, killed, and seen more than enough of her fair share of death during her time in the Boston zone.

To be clear, I think that the original iteration of Naughty Dog&#x27;s magnum opus is still a fantastic-looking title, but there&#x27;s no denying the amazing upgrade on display in this brief clip. Responding to the fans who treated the reveal with positivity, the developer would confidently assure them that they &quot;ain&#x27;t seen nothing yet.&quot; Does a Last of Us remake even need to exist? I&#x27;m not sure it does, personally, but that doesn&#x27;t mean I can&#x27;t appreciate when fine work has been done in the talented sphere of game development.
The Last of Us Part I is currently in development for PS5. It is scheduled to release this fall.

Did you know there&#x27;s an Epic Games Store showcase going on right now? Me neither! More Lord of the Rings-licensed games are on the way beyond that vague EA mobile project and the Gollum title; as The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria was just announced today.
The trailer opens up at the Doors of Durin, before showcasing a group of dwarves (players) quite literally heading back into Moria. Social elements (group drinking), survival moments (evading orcs that are still skulking about the halls), crafting, and building seem to be in play. Development is handled by Free Range Games, who has worked as an external developer on several titles, and handled primary development for Spelldrifter.
Here&#x27;s a quick description that sums up the vibe:

                              <span>I mean, good songs are kind of the norm in this series
So far, Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is putting its best foot forward. We&#x27;ll see how it fares come July, but for now, I&#x27;m pretty happy with what Nintendo is showing off. And that includes this new beautiful Xenoblade Chronicles 3 song called &quot;A Life Sent On.&quot;
Shared by way of the Nintendo UK Twitter account, the track is described as a &quot;somber flute-based melody,&quot; which is played by &quot;off-seers&quot; in the universe (specifically Noah and Mio) to mourn people who have fallen in battle. Based on the small amount of lore we have, off-seers are tasked with some sort of guidance for a facet of the afterlife, and could potentially play a larger role in the narrative.
For now, I&#x27;ve listened to this particular Xenoblade Chronicles 3 song a bunch of times now (even when writing this!) and it&#x27;s giving me extremely good vibes for how the game will turn out. Aesthetically it seems to be nailing everything it needs to, as that&#x27;s arguably been one of the stronger points of the series from the start: outdoing other similar games on the same hardware.
Hopefully we get even more quality of life upgrades and a killer story. There&#x27;s a lot to improve upon in the second core game mechanically.

It seems that Capcom can&#x27;t stop showing us Street Fighter 6. The studio has been feeding the community a steady stream of tidbits ever since its official gameplay reveal during last week&#x27;s Sony State of Play presentation. With the spirit of a parent holding their newborn baby, Capcom has excitedly rolled out character reveals, music videos, test sessions, and a wide variety of minor details and elements.
Despite blatantly stating this past weekend that the developer would be going &quot;dark&quot; on the title, Capcom simply cannot help itself, offering up new clips and information pertaining to everyone&#x27;s favorite Family Man, Guile — first revealed during Thursday&#x27;s Summer Game Fest.

Resident Evil fans have a reason to revisit some of the series&#x27; recent hits this week as Resident Evil 2, Resident Evil 3, and Resident Evil 7 all got PS5 and Xbox Series X/S versions (and forced PC updates). Owners of these games on PS4 and Xbox One can upgrade for free with benefits like faster load times, ray tracing, and even haptic feedback with DualSense controllers. Except, there&#x27;s an unfortunate catch — if you own Resident Evil 7 through the PlayStation Plus Collection, you aren&#x27;t getting the PS5 upgrade, which is the same sort of weird caveat Final Fantasy fans went through with Final Fantasy VII Remake.
Some of you pointed out this issue earlier this week, and sure enough, it&#x27;s a bummer.

Mario Strikers: Battle League is the first entry in Next Level Games&#x27; Mario Strikers series for a long time, and while it&#x27;s a familiar (and excellent) romp, this new match brings a few new tricks up its sleeves — we mean, football socks.
Battle League introduces Gear which you can unlock and buy in the in-game store. But being a Mario game, you&#x27;ll need to collect some of those lovely gold coins to get ahold of the goods. It&#x27;s a lofty task, but with perseverance and patience, you&#x27;ll be able to build up a big pile o&#x27; money that even Wario would be jealous of.

Atari&#x27;s asking you to save the company&#x27;s history by fighting off killer pixels and difficult puzzles in Atari Mania, a brand new game which sees you defending the Atari Vault. If only that was a real building...

This week&#x27;s Japanese charts (as reported by Famitsu) have seen a bit of a shake-up! We thought that maybe the newly released Mario Strikers: Battle League would score the number one spot, but it&#x27;s been sliced away by the Switch port of Demon Slayer -Kimetsu no Yaiba- The Hinokami Chronicles.
In the week of 6th to 12th June, CyberConnect2&#x27;s anime beat &#x27;em up sold a whopping 90,885 units, firmly pushing Mario Strikers&#x27; third outing down to second with 32,173 units shifted.

Dreamcast action game Slave Zero perhaps wasn&#x27;t the most well-received game on the system. Mixed reviews pointed out poor frame rate, a lack of music, and bugs. However, a 2014 Steam and GOG rerelease saw this flawed title find a new audience.
Now the cult classic is being brought back by publisher Ziggurat and developer Poppy Works with a brand new prequel. Slave Zero X changes the game from a 3D action game to 2.5D pixel art hack-and-slash arcade-like experience, complete with stylish combos and frenetic action.

Nintendo has actively demonstrated on numerous occasions just how much it strives for perfection in its games. Just recently, we highlighted a clever easter egg tucked neatly away in the latter potion of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild in which an additional scene would play out if you take a photo of a specific in-game map. Now, it&#x27;s Super Mario Odyssey&#x27;s turn under the spotlight.
As highlighted by Twitter user Supper Mario Broth, you&#x27;ll notice that the Toad characters found in the Mushroom Kingdom are all donning hats. If you speak to one of them, it will state that Peach brought them back with her from the Moon as a souvenir. In a rather clever detail, if you zoom in on the Toad characters prior to Peach&#x27;s return, you&#x27;ll notice that they&#x27;re not yet wearing any hats, because they haven&#x27;t been given them yet!

                              <span>These hands are rated E for Everyone.
A couple years ago, a small Croatian development team called Room-C set out to create a new game set in Arthurian mythology called The Hand of Merlin. Following a roguelite structure and based around high-difficulty, tactical gameplay, the release quickly gained a passionate fanbase that eagerly awaited each new iteration as the title went through Early Access on Steam. Now that the title has finally reached 1.0 status, it’s been ported to consoles, and we’re happy to report that the final product is an enjoyable and intense experience that’s well worth your time.
The narrative in The Hand of Merlin is kept to a minimum, consisting of a larger overarching event that’s filled in by various smaller emergent events which change from run to run. The main thrust of the story here is that there’s a terrible Cataclysm slowly corrupting the land and killing off life, and the spirit of Merlin the Wizard is the last hero of the Round Table who can do something about it. Though he’s, uh, sorta dead, he’s able to travel the multiverse and help various bands of heroes and adventurers in their quest to save their world. If they fail and die, Merlin bails on them and goes to another universe to try again.

This is just a tiny handful of dream additions people wanted to see. And while Sora from Kingdom Hearts ultimately rounded out the roster for Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, it didn&#x27;t stop people from dreaming. But why dream when you can create mods and bring whatever character you want into the game!

In the run-up to its (surprisingly close!) July 29th release, Nintendo has revealed a brand new track from the Xenoblade Chronicles 3 OST.
Titled &quot;The Weight of Life&quot;, the track is your quintessential Xenoblade music, with sweeping strings, thrashing guitars, and heaps of emotion. Indeed, Nintendo itself states that the track is a &quot;moving song that expresses the emotions of Noah, Mio, and their friends as they fight their way through the world of Xenoblade Chronicles 3&quot;. So there you go - emotional!

It&#x27;s been a long time coming, huh? After its initial announcement several years back (heck, we even signalled its eventual Switch launch back in 2017), The Legend of Bum-bo has finally bagged itself a release date for Switch.
A prequel of sorts to The Binding of Isaac by Edmund McMillen, The Legend of Bum-bo will finally see the light of day on June 29th for the price of $19.99. In terms of gameplay, it&#x27;s a roguelike tile-matching puzzle game in which you move through a total of four levels, each of which is made up of multiple rooms. You&#x27;ll come face-to-face with a range of grotesque beasties and will need to match tiles in order to defeat them.

The pitch for Venba is solid. Cooking games are a great time, and that alone would&#x27;ve at least piqued my interest. But where Visai Games&#x27; Venba secured my attention wasn&#x27;t just the cooking itself, but what the cooking represented: history, family, home, and a connection to your roots, even in the unfamiliar.
I got to play a short demo as part of the Tribeca Games selection this year. It was just one chapter, a short cooking session bookended by narrative sections that set up the recipe creation. Venba follows Venba herself, who&#x27;s immigrated from India to Canada along with her husband.
The pair is nervous, wondering if the move was the right choice. Venba is tired and a bit frazzled, but when her husband suggests he&#x27;ll simply …</span>

So, that&#x27;s another year of summer game announcements on the book. There are a few more streams on the horizon, but for now, we&#x27;ve gotten a taste of just about all of the upcoming games we can handle. Developers threw what felt like an endless stream of new titles at us, and while a lot of the space horror games kind of blurred together after a while, there were plenty of titles that stuck out to me as games I&#x27;d be looking forward to the most. Naturally, most of them are narrative games, and so for my sake and yours, I decided to compile a list of what I think are the best-looking narrative games that were highlighted these past few days/weeks.

                              <span>A little frog on a big adventure
For years now, crowdfunding sites have been one of the best ways for indie games to secure development. Because fans get to directly support the projects they want made, we&#x27;ve seen some of the most creative and innovative titles of the past decade come from platforms like Kickstarter and Fig, including Outer Wilds, Undertale, and Hollow Knight, just to name a few. I&#x27;m always on the lookout to see what new games are up for funding, because you never know what hidden gems you&#x27;ll find. This time, I&#x27;m trained on A Frog&#x27;s Tale after spotting its Kickstarter campaign on Twitter, and it looks like it could be an indie darling in the making.
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/normanfrog/a-frogs-tale
A Frog&#x27;s Tale is a retro RPG, with pixel art inspired by SNES and GBA classics, and gameplay inspired by titles like Mario &amp; Luigi: Superstar Saga, Kingdom Hearts, and Tales of Symphonia. It features musical turn-based combat and set pieces that are synched with the game&#x27;s score, making for a truly unique experience.
Frogs have been a recent trend in video games, and considering how adorable A Frog&#x27;s Tale looks, you certainly don&#x27;t see me complaining about it. The whole thing looks incredibly polished and sleek, and while we only have a few short clips of gameplay so far, it&#x27;s already feeling like it has what it takes to stand out from the crowd.
A Frog&#x27;s Tale went up on Kickstarter last week (four days ago as of the writing of this post), and it will probably meet its $60,000 goal in the next few hours. There&#x27;s still nearly a month left for the funding campaign, so the future is looking bright for this game. There are some pretty great rewards available for backing A Frog&#x27;s Tale, so if it seems like something you&#x27;d be into, I definitely recommend checking it out.

When Tetsuya Nomura retires, he&#x27;ll have one hell of a career to look back on. Not all of it landed for everyone, but his work has had a major impact on so many people: notably, his stewardship of the Kingdom Hearts franchise. Nomura opened up about several facets of the Kingdom Hearts series in an interview with Game Informer: and shared an interesting behind the scenes tidbit about Sora in Smash Ultimate.
We already learned that Sora ended up in the game due to a &quot;chance meeting&quot; with a Disney rep, but now Nomura confirms that he was actually more &quot;picky&quot; than Disney was in regards to his appearance. Nomura notes that he was &quot;obviously happy&quot; that Disney would acquiesce and allow the character to appear, and &quot;[couldn&#x27;t] believe that Disney okayed him to be in [the] game.&quot; But once the deal was ready to go, Nomura admits that while Disney was gung-ho, he was the one who had reservations.
Nomura was concerned about his ability to pull it off, &quot;because it might clash with he established lore in Kingdom Hearts and Disney worlds,&quot; (it&#x27;s wacky enough, no worries there!) and had to &quot;consider [it] very carefully.&quot; But he doesn&#x27;t regret it one bit, seeing the positive reaction overall to what ended up being the final [for now] Kingdom Hearts DLC character.
Sora definitely made a splash, and it&#x27;s safe to say that he and the Smash team made the right choice. It&#x27;s also cute to see Nomura so humbled by the crossover. Through thick and thin, and all the ups and downs the series has had, it&#x27;s clear he still cares about it.

Publisher Microids has announced that it will be releasing a physical edition of MegaPixel Studios&#x27; The House of the Dead: Remake — the &quot;Limidead Edition&quot; will launch on PS4 and Xbox One later in 2022.
The Limidead Edition includes a boxed, disc edition of The House of the Dead: Remake on PS4 or Xbox One, complete with an exclusive lenticular sleeve, a sticker sheet, and card mini-standees of two of the game&#x27;s iconic zombies. This edition was previously made available for Nintendo Switch back in May. It&#x27;s hardly a super-duper special edition, but will serve its purpose for those who still like to see their video game library sitting snugly on a bookshelf.

The House of the Dead: Remake is a ground-up rebuild of the classic 1997 Sega rail shooter, and sees AMS agents Rogan and G battle their way through the terrifying mansion of quite-mad scientist Dr. Curien — facing down all manner of undead corpses, unholy test subjects, winged monstrosities, and the awesome and extremely dangerous &quot;Magician.&quot; The remake adds features such as new weaponry and an all-new &quot;Horde&quot; mode. A Photo Mode allows monster hunters to capture all of the gory glory.
The House of the Dead: Remake is available now on PS4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch.

                              <span>Make good choices at Digimon camp
The long-awaited Digimon Survive got a new trailer today, highlighting both its tactics and its story ahead of its July 29 launch. There are dangers, decisions, and a whole lot of Digivolution.
Digimon Survive is one-part visual novel mystery adventure, following a character lost in the world of Digimon. These sections seem to follow the cast of humans as they venture around, trying to figure out what&#x27;s happened and how to get back home.
Then, once a battle breaks out, it gets tactical. Digimon battles happen on a grid system with turn-based tactical fights. And yes, the Digimon can evolve into wild, wacky new Digimon.

The mix of mystery and tactics certainly seems interesting. And I can&#x27;t help but be drawn in when the trailer shows a chart of Digivolutions with all kinds of crossing arrows and paths.

Digimon are the champions
The tactical story-driven Digimon Survive has been in the works for quite a long time, with quite a few delays. Then, earlier this year, the team finally locked a firm date for it on July 29.
With such a long road to launch, I&#x27;d hope Digimon fans find what they&#x27;re looking for in Survive. Other Digimon games like Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth have flown under the radar, but been pretty solid.
The tactical take and incorporation of adventure game elements in Survive really intrigues me, even as someone who isn&#x27;t the biggest Digimon fan. (I did really like Our War Game, though.)
Hopefully the wait&#x27;s been worth it. Digimon Survive will launch on July 29 for PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam.

                              <span>The Last Stardriver
Sony Interactive Entertainment&#x27;s premier driving simulator, Gran Turismo, is getting ready to burn rubber on the big screen. According to a new report from the Tinseltown insiders over at Deadline, Columbia Pictures is scoping a summer 2023 release date for the fast and furious movie adaptation.
Directed by Neil Blomkamp, (the big chair behind the great District 9 and the abominable CHAPPiE), Gran Turismo has something of a strange plot concept. Reportedly, the movie will follow the exploit of the world&#x27;s greatest Gran Turismo player, who transitions their digital racing skills onto the real-world professional car racing circuit. Think The Last Starfighter, but without the world-saving angle.
As cheesy as that premise sounds, it is, surprisingly, an adaptation of a true story. British racing driver Jann Mardenborough legitimately won a Nissan-sponsored GT Academy contest in 2011, securing themselves a scholarship in the Nissan’s Driver Development Programme. Since the competition, Mardenborough has gone on to compete in numerous major race tournaments including Japan&#x27;s GT Super series and the famous 24-hour Le Mans rally.
Personally, I prefer my driving movies to focus on people in pleather flame trousers stealing DVD players, but each to their own. Gran Turismo is the latest in a series of film and TV adaptations based on PlayStation properties. Live-action takes on The Last of Us, God of War, Horizon Zero Dawn, and Twisted Metal are already in the works, while the Tom Holland vehicle Uncharted launched earlier in 2022.
Gran Turismo is tentatively scheduled to arrive in theaters August 11, 2023.

You may remember, at the start of the year, we reported that a modder had made the world that little bit better, having successfully modded a playable Juri Han into Capcom&#x27;s comic-book fighter Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 — well, it seems that Ms. Han is not the only street fighter squaring up against the Marvel alumni, as a brand new mod brings with it the inimitable Sakura Kasugano!
Talented modder Dragonify released a video showcasing their hard work in action, as Sakura — sporting her Street Fighter V duds — steps up to the plate against a team of Marvel vs. Capcom comrades. Mapped over the form of Ryu, a given considering Sakura&#x27;s shoto move set, Sakura is equipped with many of her distinct specials, including her air Tatsu, high-arc Shinku Hadoken, and even her running double Dragon Punch. You can check Sakura out in the video below and download her files from Nexus Mods.

In recent years, multiple new characters have been added to the UMvC3 roster via mods. Sharp eyes will spot SFV&#x27;s Rashid also putting in an appearance in this video, while Dragon Ball Z&#x27;s Goku, Marvel meme Morbius, and even *checks notes* Smol Ame have also been made available to the popular fighter&#x27;s PC community. Given that UMVC3 is now a creaky 11 years old, it&#x27;s a testament to the Marvel vs. Capcom community, internationally renowned for its passion and dedication toward the crossover fighting franchise.
Sakura Kasugano is yet to be revealed for the roster of Street Fighter 6, but it&#x27;s good to know that the fight-loving teen is still keeping her fists and feet flying after-hours.

                              <span>It ends on June 30
Square Enix, like many other subscription-based MMO purveyors, occasionally dips into promos to get people to play Final Fantasy XIV, and another one is here. The Final Fantasy free login campaign starts today (it began at 1AM PT technically), and will run all the way through June 30 at 7:59AM PT.
As usual, there&#x27;s some provisos. To be eligible, you needed to have previously bought and registered (the second point is salient, it can&#x27;t be sitting in a closet somewhere), your service account needs to be inactive (without a sub), and you needed to have been inactive for &quot;at least 30 days.&quot; If all of that is true, you can log back into the game and play. For a limited period of time.
Yep, note the second proviso! The login period begins &quot;four days including the day on which users first log in.&quot; That period will unilaterally end on the &quot;fourth login day&quot; at 11:59PM PT. This starts after you login, not when you zone in and start doing something, so make it count.
As long as you&#x27;re aware of the eligibility and the login restrictions, you should be fine. Just maybe do it on a lazy Thursday/Friday so you have the entire weekend to spare! My advice: use this Final Fantasy free login period to potentially finish up wherever you left off on the main story quest (MSQ). This will ensure that you&#x27;re ready to fully embrace whatever the new content is when you decide to re-subscribe in earnest again.

Screens and details about an unannounced Fire Emblem have been leaking out online. A few different parties now allege there is a new Fire Emblem in the works, with screenshots purportedly showing an early version of the game.
Earlier this week, Nintendo insider Emily Rogers shared some details about the &quot;new&quot; Fire Emblem game. And not long after Reddit user u/miasmadelta shared more, backing up the report of a brand new Fire Emblem and sharing some screens.
The reports say that the new Fire Emblem is indeed a new entry in the series, not a remake. Rogers claims that it&#x27;s a collaboration between Intelligent Systems, Koei Tecmo, and Gust. She also says it&#x27;s been finished for over a year. It also has a gimmick that lets players summon Fire Emb…</span>

                              <span>Glad to get that out of the way
So Sega has a lot to answer for when it comes to the recent Sonic Frontiers footage, but one thing they have answered is whether or not Sonic will be kissing a human girl in the upcoming entry. Yep, no Sonic kissing confirmed.
Speaking to Axios (via IGN), Sonic Frontiers producer (and long-time Sega designer) Takashi Iizuka mused on the issue when it was brought up, stating: &quot;I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll be doing that again.&quot; Iizuka has a clean conscience when it comes to the game in question too, as he didn&#x27;t even work on it — instead opting to direct Shadow the Hedgehog, Sonic Riders, and Sonic Rivals around that same time. Iizuka also points out that two of the main Sonic rules are still in effect: including the obvious &quot;go fast&quot; rule, and the &quot;he can&#x27;t swim&quot; rule.
For reference, the scene in question is from Sonic 2006, when Sonic the Hedgehog kissed a human woman. It was immediately clowned on directly after release, and when coupled with the fact that the game itself was one of the most egregious entries in the &quot;3D&quot; saga, it&#x27;s one of the only notable things that anyone talks about when referencing the infamous 2006 game.

Neon White is the latest game from Donut County creator Ben Esposito. He and the Angel Matrix team bill this level-based first-person shooter as &quot;for freaks, by freaks.&quot; They&#x27;re not wrong, either. Despite some rough narrative moments and occasional hiccups, Neon White is a blazing-fast shooter with style, precision, and a lot of dead demons.
Sinners, saints, and salvation. All of these potentially await in the heaven of Neon White. To reach the end, though, you&#x27;ll have to learn to go really, really fast. And, as it so happens, Neon White is a pretty good tutor.

OlliOlli World was one of the biggest surprises for me this year. I respected the two previous games in the series, but I had bounced off both of them. I was afraid I was going to do the same with OlliOlli World, but now it stands as one of my favorite releases this year.
It’s great to have an excuse to revisit it and feel insecure about how rusty I’ve gotten. VOID Riders is the perfect excuse to do so. It’s a rather sizeable collection of levels and a whole heap of new customization items to unlock. A new mechanic has been slotted in for good measure, as well, giving your thumbs new reason to get confused and disappoint you.

                              <span>The trailer is out now, the full thing arrives on June 27
In case you&#x27;ve been wondering why there&#x27;s been some GoldenEye 64 news this year, note that it&#x27;s the 25th anniversary of the series (amid rumors that it could be coming back in some capacity). That&#x27;s partially why it&#x27;s getting a whole GoldenEye 64 documentary!
Directed by documentarian Drew Roller, it&#x27;ll bring us through the journey of the game &quot;developer in a farmhouse in Warwickshire by a small ragtag team of university graduates, most of whom had never worked on a game before.&quot; Based on the trailer, the doc will take a look at how GoldenEye 64 (among several other games), changed the way shooters were perceived on consoles. There&#x27;s interviews with past developers afoot, as well as tons of classic late &#x27;90s footage sprinkled in to take some of us back: or give younger folks a frame of reference for the &quot;Xtreme/Attitude&quot; period of the industry.
If you&#x27;re interested, you can find the site for the production team here, which is where it&#x27;ll debut in digital format on June 27. Although the digital platforms differ by region, it&#x27;s currently being sold on iTunes [Apple TV] for roughly $9.99 USD, and the film clocks in at one hour and 39 minutes.
It&#x27;s starting to get to the point where a lot of these retro games are &quot;ancient history,&quot; and can be looked at in the same way that old relics of the past (like Pong) were just 20 years ago. I&#x27;ve come to accept it!

Somewhere, tucked away in a photo album at my dad&#x27;s house, there lies a photograph of me playing Konami&#x27;s Teenage Mutant &quot;Hero&quot; Turtles arcade, during a 1990 family vacation to the tropical paradise that is South Devon. I remember literally having &quot;jelly legs&quot; after playing, such was my complete, unadulterated excitement at my two greatest loves of the time combining. You see, my friends, what I was experiencing was the perfect marriage of the two most important elements of the 1990s for any 10-year-old: TMNT and arcade games.
While Eastman &amp; Laird&#x27;s iconic Heroes in a Half Shell have since dipped their two-toed feet into all manner of gaming genres, there is little argument that they will always be suited best to the beat-&#x27;em-up genre. From the aforementioned 19…</span>

                              <span>June 18 through June 19
The powers that be have revealed that a shiny Clefairy Pokemon distribution event for Sword and Shield is happening soon, to celebrate the Asia Player&#x27;s Cup. The news comes via Serebii.net, who discovered that the code will be shared on various Pokemon Facebook pages from June 18 through June 19.
Like most worldwide distribution events, this one will be a code that&#x27;s provided by The Pokemon Company, which works for a limited time. You can get it via the last mainline entry (Sword and Shield), by going into the mystery gift section and entering it. Stay tuned for the actual code distribution on the weekend.
This particularly Clefairy, again, is shiny, and will come with an Eviolite held item, at level 50. Serebii.net states that the official documents notes that it&#x27;ll have glaciate, rather than icy wind. Earlier this year in February, Clefairy was datamined for Pokemon Unite: which is still a possibility for the game. It would potentially make sense to do a shiny Clefairy Pokemon event with that in mind, though this is mainly being done to honor the 2021 Asia Player&#x27;s Cup contestant.
With Pokemon Scarlet and Violet in the pipeline, it stands to reason that all these events will shift over there by the end of the year, as well.

The tongue-in-cheek monster-mashing franchise Lollipop Chainsaw is apparently getting set to make its grand return, according to one former producer. The announcement was made on the campy title&#x27;s 10th anniversary, as spotted by the eagle eyes of VGC.
&quot;Lollipop Chainsaw is back by Dragami Games. Please look forward to it.&quot; The succinct statement popped up on Twitter late yesterday evening, penned by Yoshimi Yasuda, former CEO of developer Kadokawa Games. Yasuda did not offer any further explanation regarding this statement, not clarifying whether he was referring to a new sequel, a remaster, or a remake.
Regardless... it&#x27;s... back!

Originally released for PS3 and Xbox 360, Lollipop Chainsaw is a cheesecake hack &#x27;n&#x27; slash adventure that follows a sultry cheerleader, Juliet Starling, who is forced to call upon her ancient zombie hunting bloodline to clear out an uprising of the dead within her Californian high-school. Accompanied by the sentient severed head of her boyfriend, Nick, Juliet gets a little saw crazy against an army of putrid monsters and demons, in overtly sexual, wantonly gory, splatteriffic action.
With eccentric game maker Suda51 on its directorial team, and a script penned by a pre-Guardians of the Galaxy James Gunn, Lollipop Chainsaw didn&#x27;t win many awards for being a technical masterpiece, but became revered in the following years for its cathartic action and ridiculous and vulgar aesthetic. Juliet Starling will most certainly be welcomed back into the modern gaming era with open arms. As to when that will happen, where, and in what form. We&#x27;ll have to wait on something a little more concrete.
Start revving, at any rate.

                              <span>The Ukrainian team is continuing development as the invasion continues
Today&#x27;s Xbox Games Extended Showcase closed out with a sobering reminder of the current realities for GSC Game World. The Ukrainian studio has been public about the effect the Russian invasion has had on development. Today the team opened up about it, sharing an emotional update as it confirmed S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 is moving to 2023.
While the studio shared a new video about S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 itself, which you can find here, GSC Game World also shared a dev diary about its current status. The three-minute video is powerful and a heavy watch, just so you know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;RxcfxdG22pg
The video shows the toll that the invasion has taken on its developers and where they live. While some have been able to get out, others have not been able to, or opted to volunteer or even serve in the armed forces. The video shows developers living in small hallways, rushing for bomb shelters, and walking around in destroyed city blocks. One describes how he&#x27;s unsure whether some of his loved ones are safe or not. It is a heavy reminder of the real toll the Russian invasion has taken on average people in Ukraine.
During the update, GSC Game World confirms that it has pushed the release of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl into 2023.
Development during wartime
The Russian invasion began on Feb. 24, 2022 and has continued for 111 days. It&#x27;s taken its toll on many Ukrainian citizens including those at GSC Game World and more, as detailed in a report from IGN in May. Many other developers and publishers have called for aid and action in response to the invasion, including withholding their games and services from Russia and Belarus.
Our hearts go out to the GSC Game World team. The studio has shared a link at which you can help provide aid.

Even with minimal details, Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty — a new Team Ninja romp coming in hot off the Nioh series — was probably my favorite game announcement at the jam-packed Xbox &amp; Bethesda Games Showcase. It&#x27;s an action-infused dark-fantasy take on the Three Kingdoms with demons to take out and a masocore challenge to overcome.
There are still a lot of gameplay specifics to fill in, but coming off of the weekend&#x27;s big Xbox showing, we now know that the game is making the full rounds on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S in early 2023. Team Ninja also shared more information about Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty in an interview with IGN — and it sounds really promising.

We touched on the game&#x27;s &quot;beta paths&quot;, its gore system, upgrades, and batteries. There was a lot of chat about batteries. Forgot to ask if they were AA or AAA, though.

It’s a basic button-mashing affair that offers nothing new, but that facilitated a good old chinwag that I didn&#x27;t know I needed.
It was something I really appreciate, when my go-to multiplayer games, such as Warzone and Destiny 2, demand my constant and unwavering attention. Lasting about three hours, Shredder’s Revenge won’t become your new time sink, but it’s an undemanding arcadey jaunt that you can enjoy while munching on pizza with pals. Or, ya know, over Discord while everyone is surrounded by takeaway tubs in their bedrooms.

You might have to wait for some years to see anything from it though, as The Elder Scrolls 6 is only in “pre-production”. We’ll all be sporting Methuselah-length beards and have popped all the achievements in Starfield’s umpteenth DLC by then.

                              <span>V Rising, the vampiric survival base builder and surprise hit of 2022 so far, has just got freshly minted Steam Deck Playable status - courtesy of an update to the Deck’s Proton compatibility software. As per Valve’s changelog for the Proton 7.0-3 update, V Rising is among several games (including Age of Chivalry and the original Vermintide) to gain sufficient compatibility with the Steam Deck for the second-highest rating of their review programme, just short of Verified.


Technically, V Rising has been lowercase P-playable on the Steam Deck since late May, when these software improvements appeared on the ‘Bleeding Edge’ branch of Proton Experimental. Now, though, the update has graduated to the main, stable Proton branch, so you don’t have to risk the potential wonkiness of a work-in-progress. I’ve given V Rising a try on the Steam Deck and it does indeed work, though it’s quick to show why it only got Playable status and not Verified.

                              <span>First released in 1987 - back when Games Workshop were, arguably, much more fun than they are today - Rogue Trader was the first edition of what would eventually become tabletop miniature megachonker Warhammer 40,000. Rogue Traders, the stars of the setting, are themselves a touch more colourful than your average corpse-emperor enjoyer; freelance explorers given a ship, a packed lunch, and a cohort of space-toughs, and sent off to explore the far-flung reaches of the galaxy. And it’s this unique place in the 40k universe that makes them such an exciting prospect for the setting&#x27;s first fully-fledged classic CRPG.

                              <span>Intel have finally launched the first of their Arc Alchemist graphics cards, the Arc A380, but only in China for now. VideoCardz spotted the press release for the small-scale launch, which confirms some of the A380 specs, its comfort zone of 1080p / 60fps on medium quality settings, and a recommended price: 1030 yuan. That’s about £130 / $150, not accounting for regional tax maths.

                              <span>How much should a 1440p 144Hz monitor cost, a good one, when it&#x27;s on sale? Normally the answer is around $300, but today Monoprice have gone one further. Their Zero-G 27-in 1440p 144Hz curved monitor has dropped from $250 to $190 - mere pocket change*! 
Exaggerations aside, this is a legitimately good price for a monitor of this spec, especially one that has actually attracted reasonable reviews in its category. It ticks a lot of boxes - great contrast, good colour accuracy, reasonable pixel density, a sturdy stand, four display inputs and FreeSync/G-Sync Compatible support. Not bad at all!

                              <span>The RTX 2060 isn&#x27;t the new hotness that it was a few years ago, but a global pandemic and chip shortage means that the card is still a surprisingly capable option three years later. The cheapest RTX 2060 on Amazon costs £370, but if you&#x27;re willing to go refurbished you pay way less: just £190. 
That&#x27;s a heck of a deal for an RTX and DLSS-capable graphics card, especially given the GPUs come with a six month warranty from the folks at Laptop Outlet. This Zotac card will run rings around the GTX 1660 Super, the best card you could buy new for this price, especially in games that support DLSS to boost frame-rates.

We&#x27;re moving away from Namco&#x27;s backlog for a bit this week in the Arcade Archives line-up, as the next game coming to the series is 1981 arcade shooter Space Seeker. the game will be dropping on the eShop tomorrow — 16th June — for the usual price of $7.99 / €6.99 / £6.29.
This game is known for having multiple different perspectives across its six areas. Much of the game is played as a side-scrolling shooter, but you have to navigate many areas — known as &#x27;bases&#x27; — from a top-down view, and if you attack a fleet here, you swap to a first-person cockpit perspective.

Kalypso will be releasing an updated version of the PC strategy game Commandos 3: Destination Berlin on Switch later this year. Kalypso has also previously published a remaster of Commandos 2 back in 2020.
Simply titled Commandos 3 - HD Remaster, this is a total revamp of the RTS game that reworks the controls, gives the game a more modern UI, and updates the visuals. The original was the first entry in the Commandos series to use a true 3D engine, with multiple fights to command including at Stalingrad, Berlin, and Omaha Beach.

                              <span>It’s no secret that 2022 is off to a raucous start with multiple game of the year contenders hitting within the first couple of months of the year. Even with highly-rated hits like Elden Ring, Dying Light 2, Pokémon Legends: Arceus, and Horizon Forbidden West building the foundation of exceptional games of the year, there’s a lot still yet to release.

As much as I want Arkane Studios to return to the Dishonored series, this talented developer repeatedly shows it may be better off exploring new ventures. Prey and Deathloop support this theory with thunderous success, and the studio’s next experiment, Redfall, looks just as promising.
I recently sat down with Arkane Austin’s studio director, Harvey Smith, and co-creative director, Ricardo Bare, to learn what players can expect from this vampire-slaying experience.
“We’re taking on a giant creative challenge,” Smith says. “We want to hold onto Arkane’s core creative values while taking on an open-world game. It’ll still have the rich narrative design accompanying eve…</span>

In 2021, while interviewing creator Ben Esposito about then-upcoming Neon White, he told me he wasn&#x27;t trying to make a game appealing to everyone. He wanted Neon White to appeal to &quot;really specific people.&quot;
Put another way, as Esposito said in one of the game&#x27;s trailers, it&#x27;s a game made for &quot;freaks.&quot;
I guess that makes me a freak, then. Because Neon White is my favorite game I&#x27;ve played all year – by a large margin.
You assume the role of Neon White; a dead assassin pulled from Hell for a divine competition. Demons overrun Heaven, so the powers that be task White and a host of damned…</span>

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles carved its perfect niche in video games by way of the cooperative beat ‘em up. Titles like the 1989 arcade game and Turtles in Time let fans fulfill the fantasy of kicking shell alongside their friends, but it’s been a long time since our green heroes were the stars of a great video game. Shredder’s Revenge ends that drought, serving as a lovingly crafted homage to TMNT’s glory days that gives fans what they remember while sanding down most of the rough edges.

                              <span>Redfall kicked off the recent Xbox &amp; Bethesda Games Showcase with a brand new look at gameplay. Bethesda also revealed additional information about the game, including details about its different characters, co-op, and more. 
Following that reveal, Redfall game designer Harvey Smith spoke to IGN in a new interview about the title’s co-op and how it works. Here, Smith revealed that Redfall’s campaign progress is tied to the host of the co-op party and that it’s only persistent for that host, as reported by GamesRadar. This means that if you’re teaming up with someone to play co-op and you’re not the host, you will not receive the campaign progress they might after completing a level. 


“So for the flow of things, you want to have to redo those,” Smith said. “The story would be very confusing if you got to mission eight and it said, ‘skip this one because you’ve already done it.&#x27;&quot;
Smith said that Arkane initially tried to give every player some “credit” for completing a given level when they aren’t the host. However, this didn’t work out, as those same players would then run into that same mission again when playing solo or as the host of their own co-op session. However, Smith told IGN that character progression aspects such as loot and XP would carry over to your campaign. 
Of course, with Redfall recently delayed out of 2022 and into 2023, things could change. In the meantime, watch Bethesda’s thrilling and bloody Redfall gameplay recently revealed, and then catch up on all the biggest gaming news from the 2022 Xbox &amp; Bethesda Games Showcase.

                              <span>Bethesda and Xbox gave Starfield the spotlight during its recent weekend showcase, revealing more than 15 minutes of new footage and information from director Todd Howard. 
The studio didn’t mention this during the showcase, but shortly after, the Bethesda Game Studios Twitter account revealed some new details about dialogue in Starfield and how your created character – the protagonist of the game – interacts with NPCs. In short, speaking to NPCs will happen in first-person, and your character will remain silent as they do not have a voice.

June 13, 2022
As you can see in the tweet above, the studio has cleared up some possible confusion around the created character we’ll all be playing in Starfield. This reveal has been praised by some and criticized by others. Some Bethesda fans prefer the studio’s RPGs where you remain silent, while others prefer their character to have a voice they can hear in-game. 
I’m cool with either. I hope Starfield’s dialogue is more akin to Fallout 3 than Fallout 4, though. In the former, you’d see essentially all of the dialogue your choice would result in, whereas in Fallout 4, your choices were more like mood options, giving just a general view of that choice’s dialogue. It took away some of my character’s agency, and I’m hoping Starfield restores that a bit. Only time will tell for now, though. 
Starfield will hit Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC sometime in 2023.

                              <span>In a video interview with IGN, Bethesda’s Todd Howard divulged additional details about Starfield. He also uttered the name “Fallout 5” and gave an idea of when fans can expect to see it. 
Speaking to Ryan McCaffrey, Howard confirmed that Fallout 5 will be the next game after The Elder Scrolls 6, which itself has entered pre-production:
&quot;Yes, Elder Scrolls 6 is in pre-production and, you know, we’re going to be doing Fallout 5 after that, so our slate’s pretty full going forward for a while. We have some other projects that we look at from time to time as well.&quot;
Following up on Starfield’s big gameplay demonstration at the Xbox + Bethesda Showcase, Howard revealed additional facts about the new IP. Starfield&#x27;s main story is 30-40 hours long, or 20% larger than any Bethesda game to date. New Atlantis, one of Starfield’s four main cities and capital of the United Colonies, is also the largest city Bethesda has ever made. For character creation, Howard states there are roughly 20 character backgrounds to choose from. 
The game’s procedural galaxy features the most hand-made content ever made by the studio. Boasting over 1000 planets that players can visit, Howard also clarified you cannot fly to each one seamlessly a la No Man’s Sky, describing the on-the-ground action and space gameplay as two separate experiences. In terms of space combat, Howard discusses how dogfighting (which he describes as having a slower pace) takes cues from games like FTL and MechWarrior and confirms that players can steal the ships they board. 
Starfield launches in 2023 for Xbox Series X/S and PC.

                              <span>It should be a rule that any game which shows a slick, edited trailer at E3 (or not-E3) has to then release a longer, more illustrative piece of footage, too. That way we&#x27;ll be able to take our dose of hype, then follow it with a dash of reality. 

So it is with Outpost, a first-person base-builder with seemingly massive swarms that impressed during the Future Games Show. How does it look in the 8 minutes of playtest footage below? Less impressive - but still compelling.

                              <span>A few days ago I sat in on a presentation for Lightyear Frontier, a 3D farming and crafting game set on a remote planet at the edge of the galaxy. In fact in the presentation the game was referred to as a &quot;farmadventure&quot;, which isn&#x27;t a portmanteau and you only have to go another centimetere along to get farmventure, which is just about a portmanteau and, furthermore, is fun to say. 
Developers Frame Break are keen to emphasise how chilled out Lightyear Frontier is: it&#x27;s very peaceful, and there&#x27;s no death (a &quot;survival game without survival&quot;). It&#x27;s all about ecology and being one with nature. This does, at times, feel slightly at odds with the other eye-catching thing about Lightyear Frontier, which is a bloody massive tractor mech stomping about everywhere.

It’s not the new Commandos game that you might be hoping for, but at least it’s World War something. Synchronise watches by viewing the trailer below.

Well, never fear, because developers Atlus say both games will be coming to Valve’s storefront, as Eurogamer report. In case you missed the trailer, here it is below.

                              <span>If you played Hypnospace Outlaw, there’s a high chance you’ll remember Zane “Zane_Rocks_14” Lofton. He’s one of the more memorable characters you meet in Tendershoot’s alternate reality web simulator, an angsty teenage boy whose home page is slathered in camouflage textures and GIFS of exploding handguns. Since release, Zane has become one of Hypnospace’s de facto mascots, a beloved dweeb that is abrasive but also kind of painfully relatable? It’s hard to laugh at Zane’s baggy trousers and love for Linkin Park-esque rap-metal when you grew up in the mid-2000’s. I mean, we all bought a dog lead from Wilkinson’s and hooked it between the belt loops on our jeans at one point, right? …right?


Ahem. Anyway. Announced earlier this year alongside Dreamsettler (a proper sequel to Hypnospace), Slayers X: Terminal Aftermath: Vengance of the Slayer is an FPS spin-off that stars the fan-favourite teen. Slayers X is framed as being an in-universe project that Zane worked on as a teen, and has been uncovered by his now 37-year-old self, who is determined to finally see it released. There’s a short demo available as part of Steam’s most recent Next Fest, and I’m delighted to say it’s exactly what I hoped it would be.

Like in Vampire Survivors, I think the roguelikelike arcade shooter&#x27;s real victory condition is spewing so many bullets and explosions and fireballs and lightning strikes and ice shards that the framerate starts chugging. As far as I&#x27;m concerned, when the game can no longer process just how ridiculous my run is, I&#x27;ve beaten it and I win. Reader dear, I&#x27;m delighted to say I finally managed that in 20 Minutes Till Dawn. I finally won.

                              <span>The first piece of DLC for Resident Evil Village will release on October 28th, Capcom has announced. Revealed as part of their not E3 livestream, the Winter&#x27;s Expansion will include three seperate additions to entice fans back into its world of tall vampire ladies and weird dog men.
The first is Shadow Of Rose, a story expansion set after the events of the base game that focuses on Rose, the daughter of Village protagonist Ethan Winters. In an attempt to understand the origin of her mysterious &quot;powers&quot;, Rose will enter the consciousness of the twisted mould that was the source of all the bother in both Biohazard and Village. Players will guide Rose through a number of spooky locales, including what appears to be Castle Dimetrescu from the game&#x27;s main campaign.

                              <span>When Capcom announced Exoprimal, an action game devised by your six-year-old self where players jump into badass exosuit and then machine-gun roiling hordes of dinosaurs, Alice0 believed that you fought the big lizard-birds with the help of an AI. In a new trailer and deep dive from tonight&#x27;s Capcom Showcase we learned that in fact the dino-rain is happening because of the AI. It is running combat tests with humans by, er, opening huge wormholes in the sky and dumping hundreds of dinosaurs on us like so many plastic toys.
If this concept sounds as incredible to you as it does to many of us in the RPS treehouse, then you can sign up for an upcoming closed network test here. Entry is open until the 30th of June, and  to avoid disappointment make sure you take note of the entry requirements.

                              <span>Each time San Diego Comic-Con rolls around, we receive a ton of conference-exclusive collectibles to fawn over. While many of us will likely never get our hands on some of these unless we actually go to the show or find a vendor online, they&#x27;re always fun to look at. This year, Funko is releasing a series of SDCC-exclusive Pop! figures. Game Informer can exclusively reveal the Pop Games: Sonic – Super Sonic First Appearance vinyl figure.
This version of Super Sonic features the ability to glow in the dark, paying tribute to his signature golden aura from the games, TV shows, comics, and movies. This vinyl figure stands at approximately 5.3 inches and gives the appearance it&#x27;s floating above its stand. While I haven&#x27;t seen the figure in person, the floating illusion probably combines with the glow-in-the-dark feature to create a cool effect when the lights dim.

This San Diego Comic-Con exclusive Funko Pop! figure comes in a box with either a &quot;2022 Summer Convention Exclusive&quot; sticker or the &quot;2022 San Diego Comic-Con&quot; sticker on the box. Despite the image in the gallery above featuring the latter, the sticker on the box isn&#x27;t guaranteed. This year marks the iconic convention&#x27;s grand return to the San Diego Convention Center for the first time since 2019. San Diego Comic-Con runs from July 21 to July 24.</span>

                              <span>Despite not having a trailer at the main Xbox and Bethesda showcase this weekend, eagle-eyed viewers may have spotted a popular survival title alongside the 2023 Xbox releases in an image near the show&#x27;s end. Today it was confirmed that inclusion was very intentional, as Valheim is not only coming to Game Pass on PC this fall but will be coming to consoles and will be exclusive to Xbox when it launches in 2023.


The Norse-themed cooperative survival game was released into Early Access on Steam in February of last year when it quickly blew up in popularity, selling over 3 million copies in its first few weeks on sale. For people like myself who never took the plunge on Valheim, its addition to PC Game Pass in a few months is a welcomed sight, as is its inclusion in the Microsoft Store on Windows.
The other big news for Valheim is three-fold. First, the game is officially coming to consoles for the first time. There has been talk of its eventuality since controller support was added to the PC version earlier this year, but it&#x27;s nice to finally have confirmation. When this port does land on Xbox sometime in the first half of 2023, full cross-play will be enabled to team up with any number of PC and console players. Although, no other consoles will be involved since Microsoft has locked down console exclusivity for Valheim, so don&#x27;t expect to see the game show up on PlayStation or Switch anytime soon.
If you can&#x27;t wait until Valheim joins Game Pass on your Microsoft platform of choice, it&#x27;s available to purchase right now on Steam.</span>

Industria’s inspirations are clear from the jump: Half-Life 2, David Lynch movies, and more. It’s something the six-person team at Bleakmill has mentioned when discussing Industria online that had me excited. You play as Nora, a worker for the East Berlin-based company Atlas, just before the end of the Cold War. Your lover disappears, and you set off to find him, only to wind up in a parallel dimension where machines have taken over what used to be home. Sadly, the four hours following this mysterious and intriguing start fail to live up to t…</span>

                              <span>GSC Game World has confirmed that S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl will now arrive in 2023. To hold fans over, the team released a new cinematic during today&#x27;s Xbox Games Extended Showcase.
S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 was slated to launch on December 2, but development was put on hold when the studio became caught in the crossfire of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. GSC Game World is based in Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital and some employees have helped defend the city. Given the situation, it seemed increasingly unlikely the game would make it this year, so today’s announcement isn’t totally unexpected. Although GSC is still working out of Kyiv, most of the game&#x27;s development has resumed at a new office established in Prague, Czech Republic.
Meanwhile, a new trailer further establishes S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2&#x27;s gloomy atmosphere.  


In addition, a developer diary documents the state of GSC Game World during the start of Russia&#x27;s invasion and how it banded together amidst days of bombings (contains disturbing imagry of the war so viewer discretion is advised).


S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl will launch on Xbox Series X/S and PC.</span>

                              <span>Kingdom Hearts recently hit its 20-year milestone, but more importantly, Square Enix debuted Kingdom Hearts IV. The reveal trailer showcased a more realistic-looking Sora in a much different world, ushering the series into a new era. We couldn&#x27;t think of a better time to sit down with director Tetsuya Nomura and discuss the series&#x27; evolution. He also dropped some hints about what to expect for Kingdom Hearts IV. Read on to discover the future of Final Fantasy characters, his hesitation about Sora&#x27;s appearance in Smash Bros. Ultimate, and why you shouldn&#x27;t worry about Disney&#x27;s presence in Kingdom Hearts IV.

Below, we&#x27;ll break down each of the announcements: 
Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla
Ubisoft has revealed that Valhalla will get another year of content – aptly named Year Two – and it will include returning festivals, Mastery Challenge Pack 2, an armory update, and new tombs to explore.

                              <span>GoldenEye 007 redefined the shooter genre when it launched on Nintendo 64 in 1997. Moving away from other classic heavyweights like Doom and Wolfenstein, Rare&#x27;s acclaimed James Bond FPS opted for aesthetic realism, intense single-player campaign levels, deep stealth mechanics with cognizant AI, and, of course, PvP deathmatch. GoldenEra, an upcoming GoldenEye 007 documentary, spotlights the development of the influential FPS. 


The trailer, uploaded on IGN, features snippets of developer insight into the creation of GoldenEye 007. Designers stated that, at one point, FPS titles were primarily made for PC audiences. GoldenEye, of course, made waves when it found critical and commercial success on consoles. Next-gen game-changers like Halo and Call of Duty, then, were directly informed by the tight gunplay and combat mechanics of GoldenEye. Be sure to watch the trailer above for more insight. 
GoldenEra will be available digitally this month on June 27.

                              <span>Dying Light 2 Stay Human&#x27;s roadmap revealed five years of planned DLC. A new game plus option was implemented months ago, and optimization updates keep the gameplay fine-tuned and responsive. Post-launch plans continue to be underway as a new update – 1.4.0 – drops today with the first &quot;Chapter,&quot; bringing photo mode and new zombies to the open-world parkour adventure. 
So, what are the most significant features coming to the game today? A post on the Dying Light website details the introduction of a new NPC named Harper, a rank system to help players build a rapport with Harper as they complete his tasks, daily/weekly bounties, more high-tier gear, two new currencies, never-before-seen infected enemies like the Mutated Infected, Volatile Tyrant, and Volatile Hive, and a time trial Chapter Mission. 
Of course, there&#x27;s also the photo mode (only available in single-player) that comes with filters, special effects, and more. Other tweaks are incoming to help balance and streamline the fun – we&#x27;re talking gameplay, co-op, UI/UX, and technical updates. Read all about it by clicking the link in the previous paragraph. 
Like its prequel, Dying Light 2 Stay Human is set to get much developer support even as Techland begins developing its new fantasy action-RPG. So, eager Pilgrims will have many opportunities to expand upon Aiden&#x27;s already-harrowing journey.

First off is the return of the Jungle area from the second generation of Monster Hunter, which has been completely redone for Sunbreak. While the Jungle sounds like it would be strictly filled with trees and other foliage, it&#x27;s situated on the coast and offers plenty of sandy beaches and ruins to explore.


As for new monsters to hunt, Sunbreak has a lot of exciting new targets to take on. Espinas makes its return from Monster Hunter Frontiers. As its name implies (&quot;espinas&quot; is Spanish for thorns), this creature is covered in sharp spines that wi…</span>

                              <span>Capcom leveraged its summer showcase event today to reveal some new details on Exoprimal, the upcoming action and shooting game in which players control warriors in exosuits as they fight off rampaging hordes of dinosaurs. An out-of-control AI called Leviathan is unleashing these dinosaurs through rifts in the sky, and forcing humans to fight them off in intricate (and frankly inexplicable) wargames – usually at high risk of death and destruction of urban landscapes.
Exoprimal&#x27;s main event is called Dino Survival, where you join up in a multiplayer team of five and compete against another team to complete very specific objectives.


Those mission objectives are varied and dynamic. In Dinosaur Cull, your team must hunt and take down one specific dinosaur. VTOL Defense demands that your team protect an aircraft on the ground as it gets swarmed by the charging reptiles. Data Key Security is an escort-style mission, in which you must deliver a particular asset from one location to the next. Omega Charge is a mission in which players have access to a swarm-clearing Omega Hammer. And Energy Taker, as you might suspect, is all about gathering more energy than the opposing team.
Interestingly, Exoprimal will include sequences where you directly engage enemy players, but also moments where you team up to take down especially dangerous threats. No matter who you’re fighting against, you’ll earn XP to power up both your player character and their exosuit levels.
Capcom shared that Exoprimal will soon enter a closed network test, which should allow players to get a taste of the action. If you’re interested, you can sign up at exoprimal.com.
Exoprimal is targeting a release on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, Xbox One, and Steam, sometime in 2023.</span>

                              <span>Today during the Capcom Showcase livestream, the company touched base on its recently-announced Resident Evil 4 remake – including showing all of a few seconds of gameplay. Admittedly, especially coming off the other deep dives of the presentation, it was pretty disappointing. 
Director Yasuhiro Anpo and producer Yoshiaki Hirabayashi led the presentation, filling players in on the story of RE4 and talking about how the game is both a reimagining of the source material and a faithful adaptation. Set six years after the events of Resident Evil 2 and 3, RE4 protagonist Leon Kennedy is now the personal bodyguard of the United States president. When the president&#x27;s daughter goes missing, Leon is dispatched to a remote European village to find her. As you might expect, things don&#x27;t go well. 


We then see our first look at gameplay, and to be clear, visually, it looks great. The footage is set during the very beginning of the game, when Leon arrives outside the village in the forest. Compared to the original game, the forest is far darker and scarier. &quot;We want to nail the feeling of loneliness and fear of not knowing what lies ahead, even more so than the original,&quot; Hirabayashi said during the presentation. &quot;Of course, there will also be thrilling battles.&quot;
You&#x27;d be excused if you expected a glimpse at those thrilling battles, but unfortunately, no such look came. Our look at gameplay ends as Leon walks up to a house in the middle of the forest – which ostensibly is where Leon encounters the first Ganado, as is the case in the original RE4. 
I&#x27;m more excited for the Resident Evil 4 remake than any other game we currently know about; the original is one of my all-time favorite games. Which makes this reveal fairly disappointing. I would&#x27;ve loved an actual look at the game, but that wasn&#x27;t in the cards today. Here&#x27;s hoping we&#x27;ll get a better look in the future.</span>

                              <span>Resident Evil Village made a surprise return during today&#x27;s Capcom Showcase. After revealing the game has sold over six million copies worldwide, Capcom revealed a Gold Edition is on the way, boasting a number of notable additions. First up is a new story expansion called Shadows of Rose, which puts Rose in the lead for a mind-bending journey of discovery.


In this story, Rose, who is the daughter of Ethan, is in her teens or twenties. From the outset of play, you learn she&#x27;s struggling with her powers. To try and control them, she enters the consciousness of the Megamycete and that&#x27;s where the madness begins. Time and space are warped and she sees someone that looks just like her. The entire game is set from the third-person perspective.
Capcom is adding that new viewpoint to the core game, allowing players to see Ethan and experience the game much like Resident Evil 4 with over-the-shoulder aiming.
Lastly, Mercenaries mode is getting fleshed out with new missions and playable characters like Chris Redfield, Alcina Dimitrescu, and Karl Heisenberg. Lady Dimitrescu stands in at over nine feet in height.
If you already played through Resident Evil Village, you won&#x27;t have to buy this Gold Edition and will just need to get the new Winter&#x27;s Expansion, which contains all three additions. Capcom is planning to release this content on October 28.</span>

Thankfully that has been changing and with Zen 4 it looks like that support will be ready for launch-day with the mainline Linux kernel...</span>

                              <span>280mm is my favourite AIO liquid cooler size - cheaper than 360mm coolers while offering better performance per square inch - you just need a case that can accommodate the slightly larger fans. Normally getting a good AiO of this size costs around £100 to £180, but right now Amazon is offering the MSI MAG CoreLiquid 280R for half price: just £50. That&#x27;s an awesome value for a high-performance CPU cooler that even includes RGB lighting.

That&#x27;s a historic low price on a keyboard that editor-in-chief Katharine called &#x27;probably the loveliest keyboard I&#x27;ve ever used&#x27;. 
High praise indeed, and it was enough to earn a coveted RPS recommendation - even at its original price. Now you can pick up this delightfully clicky keyboard with low profile mechanical switches, a full-size UK layout and a beautiful metal build for £50 less.

                              <span>Abib the troubadour killed an ancient evil spirit by throwing his knife at it. Tinyfolks is not a &quot;story generator&quot; sort of game, but that fight removed any doubt that it was excellent.


There&#x27;s no shortage of dungeon-ish turn based combat games, nor of those made of all the usual fantasy archetypes, nor of pixelly low-fi games with bleepy bloopy music. Nor again are we likely to run short of games that combine some or all of the above. But like a good meal, combining even the most common ingredients in just the right way can make them delicious.


It doesn&#x27;t matter that you&#x27;re a monarch ousted by evil forces, now set on reclaiming your land within 45 days by fighting tonnes of monsters until your team is tough enough to kill the big nasty. What matters is that you&#x27;ll have a great time doing it.

                              <span>Steam Next Fest has launched with, among 1000-plus indie demos, a playable slice of SCP: Secret Files. It’s the latest in a line of games based on the SCP Foundation wiki, a collection of mainly horror-focused stories and faux-reports around a shadowy cleanup organisation and the weird, nature-defying shit they capture and cover up. Judging so far, it’s also shaping up to be perhaps the most complete attempt at an SCP game yet.

                              <span>Starfield is the next big new game from Bethesda Game Studios, and it&#x27;s a pretty big deal because they haven&#x27;t made something that isn&#x27;t a Fallout game or an Elder Scrolls game in like... ever. So everyone was pretty excited to see what this new space RPG holds at the Xbox &amp; Bethesda Showcase stream this weekend. And, sure enough, we actually got a pretty big eyeful of it.
Now, keep in mind that this game is set in outer space, the vast expanse and wonders of which we cannot ken. You could do any cool, awe-inspiring thing you want with space. Crystal waterfalls that flow backwards into the sky. Aurora borealis-like lights but so low down they whip along at ground level. Deserts of hot-pink dust sprouting deep blue rock spires. Destiny 2 has some cool planets, for example. Imagine my confusion, then, when the footage of Bethesda&#x27;s brand new IP made it look like they&#x27;ve accidentally done Fallout or Elder Scrolls again.

Nivalis is a slice-of-life sim set in the same cyberpunk city as hovercar courier game Cloudpunk, where we&#x27;ll get to run bars and restaurants, grow ingredients, fish, make friends, and maybe even find love. So like a cyberpunk Stardew Valley? Have a look in the new trailer.

                              <span>We finally glimpsed our first look at some in-game footage from interstellar RPG Starfield at yesterday’s Xbox &amp; Bethesda Games Showcase, and it had the feel of a less retro Fallout 4. Everyone knows that the true heart of any RPG is the character creation screen though. It’s just science. Speaking of which, Starfield’s character creation menus are modelling themselves on some real-life science, namely molecular biology. That’s cool, I think.

                              <span>The Wholesome Direct showcase had a whole lotta games once again, but one that really stood out to me was Paper Trail, because it looked and felt quite different.

See, it’s like Thief but has guns. Oh, and Resident Evil 4’s inventory Tetris, which is possibly the best inventory system ever invented. Witness for yourself in the trailer below.

                              <span>There was a lot going on in the 19th and early 20th centuries, and Paradox&#x27;s grand strategy game Victoria III aims to simulate pretty much all of it, starting in 1836 and giving you a century to play with. A big selling point is that every inhabitant of your nation is simulated, from lowly farmer to high rolling capitalist, each having preferences and beliefs. Balancing the political needs of your state against diplomacy, economy and, you know, war, will take a lot of wrangling of lists, menus and percentages, which you can see in the new gameplay trailer debuted at the PC Gaming Show.

Come the 40th anniversary in November, they plan to release a big Microsoft Flight Simulator update with helicopters, gliders, iconic historical aircraft including the Wright Flyer, and more. But that&#x27;s the future. Right now, the game has received a taste of far future with the release of Halo Infinite&#x27;s Pelican aircraft as a real plane you can really fly in Flight Sim.

                              <span>The Xbox &amp; Bethesda Games Showcase for 2022 has now wrapped, bringing plenty of trailers and announcements for upcoming games on Xbox and PC. The rule for this showcase, as outlined early on, is that every game shown will launch within the next 12 months. What the future will actually hold remains to be seen, but Xbox certainly sound optimistic at least. With Starfield, Hollow Knight: Silksong, Diablo IV, and much more shown at the event, there’s plenty to cover. Let&#x27;s get started then, shall we? Here&#x27;s a reminder of every announcement and trailer from the Xbox &amp; Bethesda Games Showcase 2022.

                              <span>Cocoon is an insectoid puzzle adventure that’s being developed by Jeppe Carlsen, the lead gameplay designer of Playdead’s Inside and Limbo. The game was announced at today’s Xbox &amp; Bethesda Games Showcase, and its worlds-within-worlds reality hopping system has already blown my mind a little.

The tribunal, which is part of the Copyright Office, allows parties to resolve &quot;small&quot; copyright disputes relatively cheaply outside of the federal court system. Damages available under these claims are capped at $30,000 and the entire process takes place online, without the need to hire an attorney.

A second lawsuit ensued when DISH discovered that the men had violated an injunction by launching a new pirate platform called ExpediteTV.

My fingers would ache for hours after playing Diablo Immortal; my hands haven’t spent this much time curled around my phone this way in years. Despite the pain my aging hands suffered during my first few days with Immortal, it was worth it for the fun I had. The series’ core action/RPG smash and loot gameplay makes the transition wonderfully to mobile thanks to responsive controls designed for portable play and adherence to the sights and sounds of the franchise. With this mobile facelift comes a free-to-play model most can avoid spend…</span>

                              <span>After a release in Asian markets last month, the overhaul of PlayStation Plus is available today in North and South America. Here&#x27;s everything you&#x27;ll need to know about upgrading your plan.
Three tiers are now available, offering larger numbers of features, games, and trials to play as you go up in pricing, which is available in one-month, three-month, and 12-month subscriptions. Brief descriptions of what you get in each tier can be found below. 
Upgrading is fairly painless but will require a prorated upcharge to join the new Extra or Premium plans of PlayStation Plus. To do so, go to your PS+ tab on your PlayStation console. There, you&#x27;ll find an option to upgrade. On PS5, it showed each tier and how much money it would cost to upgrade for the remainder of the month, which for most should only be a few dollars. Upon upgrading, it will tell you your next payment date and that it will charge you for a full-year subscription on that day. Don&#x27;t panic. There is a way to change your subscription type. 
How To Change Your Subscription Type From Yearly To Monthly
There are various ways of getting to your subscription settings, but here is the most foolproof. Go to the Settings menu for your PlayStation console, select Users and Accounts &gt; Accounts &gt; Payment and Subscriptions &gt; Subscriptions. In there, you&#x27;ll find your PS+ subscription. Once you&#x27;ve entered your subscription details, you can change your plan. 
Selecting Change Plan will give you the three tiers of PlayStation Plus to choose from. Picking any of them will bring you to another screen that will finally allow you to choose the length of subscription you&#x27;d like to pay for on a recurring basis. 
Once you&#x27;ve locked in your desired subscription tier and timeframe, you&#x27;re ready to enjoy all of the benefits that are now available to you, and you can rest easy knowing you&#x27;re not locked in for an unexpected charge next month.</span>

Sonic Frontiers raced among 2022’s most anticipated games when it debuted during the 2021 Game Awards. Sega has been secretive about what the open-world – or rather “open-zone” – game entails, agonizing fans eager to learn how the hedgehog fares in a larger world. During Summer Game Fest Play Days, I spent 30 minutes playing Frontiers to get a sense of how the adventure is shaping up so far. I still have many questions, but I walked away with clearer expectations and some glimmers of hope.

                              <span>An unexpected and fun surprise from the PC Gaming Show was the reveal of Klei Entertainment&#x27;s newest game. Rotwood is a multiplayer action game, and it&#x27;s expected to enter early access at some point, but that date is up in the air for now.


Thanks to the Steam description, we know a little more about Rotwood than what was revealed in the trailer. It&#x27;s a roguelike dungeon crawler designed to be played with up to four people. Each run will bring your cute animal avatars through a dangerous forest where the challenge amplifies the deeper you go in. New armor and weapons can be crafted from items scavenged, and a safe haven can be built up and fortified as well.
In typical Klei style, the hand-drawn look of the characters and enemies is unreal. Once again, the studio is pushing the boundaries of making it look like you&#x27;re controlling a cartoon character; Rotwood&#x27;s models are expressive, fluid, and bursting with personality. I can&#x27;t wait to see what Rotwood looks and plays like in action when I can eventually get my hands on it.
The trailer gave an early access date of &quot;202?&quot; which could be anytime in the next decade, though I&#x27;d expect us to play it well before 2030. Rotwood can be wishlisted on Steam, and it&#x27;s unknown whether Klei is planning for release on any additional platforms at this time.</span>

                              <span>If you stick your hand in the bone trunk, you deserve what you get. That&#x27;s my new motto, after watching the latest trailer for the first-person Giger-esque horror game Scorn. This trailer has the same world of bone and flesh as all those before it, but with the added twist of a release date: this October.

                              <span>I had just kind of assumed that if you sail a ship in Sea Of Thieves you&#x27;re a captain, you know? I know it doesn&#x27;t give anyone that title, but I figured whoever was hosting the game just kind of was it. But it turns out I am a FOOL and that nobody was a captain at all. All that is going to change when Season Seven of the MMO pirate &#x27;em up arrives next month, as confirmed in a jaunty song at the Xbox &amp; Bethesda Showcase. Players are getting a whole raft of &quot;Captaincy features&quot; - and these include being able to name your ship and customise the interior.

                              <span>Obsidian have announced that their co-op garden survival game Grounded will burst forth from early access into a full 1.0 release like a seed in your backyard this September. A story campaign playable in co-op or solo will explain how Grounded’s kids were shrunk by a mad scientist, and probably persuade me to finally give it a go. Watch out for colossal bugs in the trailer below.

Well, Obsidian have announced manuscriptacular medieval murder-mystery adventure Pentiment at today’s Xbox &amp; Bethesda Games Showcase instead. This one at least has a firm-ish release date of November attached, though, and looks very pretty. Catch yourself up with the reveal by watching the trailer below.

                              <span>The Alters wants you to think about how small choices can change the type of person you are, like a big science fiction Sliding Doors. Only, since it&#x27;s the new game from the developers of Frostpunk and This War Of Mine, I&#x27;m guessing the stakes are higher than whether Gywneth Paltrow gets it together with John Hannah. For one, you&#x27;re creating alternatve versions of yourself in order to survive on a rickety base rolling across an alien world.

                              <span>House Flipper captured the minds of all of us who watched Homes Under The Hammer and knew in our hearts that we were unlikely to be able to buy a house to live in, let alone spare houses to flip and sell at a profit. Now the publishers Frozen Forge are back with The Constructors, revealed at the PC Gaming Show. The Constructors is a simulation game allowing you to climb up another rung on the parasite ladder (following on from last year&#x27;s landlord sim The Tenants, by the same devs Ancient Forge Studio) as you own a constuction company, and build and design housing estates.

Rotwood is its name, and cartoony dungeon-crawling is the game. Up to four players can join together for online hack &#x27;n&#x27; slash action, or you can play it on your lonesome if you&#x27;d rather. Here, check out the announcement trailer below.

The blend of action-adventure, stealth and seething hordes of rats is getting a sequel later this year, taking our miserable medieval tots Amicia and Hugo to the south of France for A Plague Tale: Requiem. In a gameplay trailer shown at the Xthesda showcase tonight we saw that Amicia is struggling with whether or not she should kill the heck out of soldiers, or try to stealth on by.

                              <span>It must be a relief to ActiBlizz to have some good Diablo 4 news, given how everyone on Earth is ragging on Diablo Immortal 24/8 (when we are not open-mouthed at the stream of terrible news about the company, from numerous allegations of harrassment, misconduct and discrimination, to the company advising shareholders to not approve a proposal to report on harassment and discrimination). But at the Xbox &amp; Bethesda Showcase tonight they were able to share that Diablo 4 is coming out next year for some much anticipated ARPG antics. Why, that&#x27;s the Diablo game people keep saying they want!
Plus, the Necromancer is confirmed as the fifth playable class. There&#x27;s a moody trailer that tries to make being a Necromancer sound twisted and dangerous and a hard path to walk, but it mostly makes it sound like Necromancers are cool badasses with loads of skeleton best friends.

Arkane&#x27;s spooky co-op FPS has been on my most anticipated list for a while, especially because I was hoping the studio would put their signature weird twist on things.

In League Of Legends, for example, a Game Pass subscription will unlock all 160+ of the MOBA&#x27;s champions.

Will we see more of Starfield that isn’t CGI target footage and concept art? Could we get a closer look at Playground Games’ mysterious new Fable? Will Redfall get its first major public appearance since, uh, the last the Xbox and Bethesda Games Showcase? Dunno, but you can watch the whole show via the stream embedded below, and follow along with commentary from myself and vid bud Liam. The curtain raises at 6pm BST / 7pm CEST / 1pm ET.

                              <span>The trailer for Morbid Metal from tonight&#x27;s Future Games Show had a lot of metal (the music genre) and metal (the stuff you make blades out of). Morbid Metal is a hack &#x27;n&#x27; slash, but the difference here is that you have four different mech lads at your disposal, and you can morph between them whenever you like. This real-time switching means Morbid Metal moves very quickly. You might think hyphenated phrases like &quot;high-octane&quot;, &quot;action-packed&quot;, and &quot;fast-paced&quot; are moving in the direction of this game, but buddy this is going at such speed that they&#x27;re already here.

                              <span>Homeworld 3, threequel to the OG melancholy spaceship strategy series, has been delayed into the first half of next year. The developers say they need more time to make the engine trails glow just right, and to make the derelict megastructures mega enough. We will apparently see more of the game in action this August, though.

The very concept of Metal: Hellsinger appeals to me from the first note: Slay demons in a modern Doom-style first-person shooter to the beat of newly recorded tracks from some big names in rock and metal. As someone who grew up playing the original Doom and loves the modern iterations of the franchise, and has perhaps sunk more time into the Rock Band series than any other franchise, The Outsiders&#x27; upcoming game checks a lot of boxes. Still, coming into my hands-on time with the game, I was skeptical. Thankfully, the short demo I played at Summer Game Fest (which is also a…</span>

                              <span>After a long absence, Nightdive Studio&#x27;s remake of System Shock made an appearance at the PC Gaming Show, and it&#x27;s looking pretty cool. You can watch the trailer below for yourself, along with an interview with series creator and industry luminary Warren Spector.


This new trailer for System Shock gives a great look at the game&#x27;s visual style, which toes the line of using modern graphical techniques while paying homage to the low-res look of the original game. More specifically, some of the in-game panels and monitors are intentionally blocky and pixelated, as if they were textures from a 90s first-person shooter. SHODAN, the antagonistic AI who is ever-present in System Shock, is also a prominent feature in the trailer as she talks smack to the player as they explore the Citadel Station.
System Shock is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.</span>

                              <span>11 Bit Studios, the developer behind This War of Mine, Frostpunk, and Children of Morta, is making something new and a bit more surreal. The Alters is a sci-fi adventure where one man trying to survive and get home from a mission that&#x27;s gone wrong finds all the help he needs in himself. Or rather, himselves.


 
Jan Dolski, the main character, turns to The Alters, or alternate versions of himself that differ from him in ways that will help them all survive. The Alters each have different skills and character traits, so even though they all look like Jan, they&#x27;ll fill specific roles in the mission to get home. The trailer shows Jan and The Alters&#x27; ship, a giant wheel-like craft with a series of shipping container units held together at the center.
During the presentation, 11 Bit Studios&#x27; Lead Artist Tomasz Kisikewicz says the game has aspects of a psychological thriller, with a dash of horror, but also obviously deals with surrealism. He also says this lands in a &quot;classic sci-fi&quot; story by taking a relatable topic and applying these fictional science solutions like creating alternate selves, but the gameplay is contemporary with a focus on system design and non-linear gameplay. It&#x27;s designed for players to create their own stories.
 

It seems like it&#x27;s far too early for a release date, but we do know The Alters will be coming to PC whenever it does end up launching.</span>

                              <span>The PC Gaming Show debuted an extended look at gameplay for a Sci-fi thriller from Starward Industries, The Invincible. What was shown is compelling, and it may be an understatement to say, but this game looks stunning.


The demo begins from the perspective of Yasna, a hazmat-suited explorer as she ventures into a dusty and irradiated facility. Her cohort Novik supports her on comms as she delves deeper into the mysterious local. She soon comes across a deactivated Antimatter cannon and later a robot looping a task it&#x27;s been engaged in for who knows how long. The tech of The Invincible is retro-futuristic, which gives the rundown facility and gadgets Yasna uses a lot of character and charm. Yasna pulls out a handheld tracker with a field of tiny lights and uses it to discover a body buried in the sands beneath her feet, confirming this place isn&#x27;t at all safe. Then, the antimatter cannon surges to life, takes aim, and blows the robot worker away with a spectacular beam of particles before turning its sights dead on our protagonist.
I&#x27;m not usually one for slow-paced first-person narrative games, but this look at The Invincible had me on the edge of my seat, and I can&#x27;t wait to see more. The Invincible is coming sometime in 2023 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</span>

                              <span>Obsidian Entertainment, the studio behind 2019’s The Outer Worlds, has revealed Pentiment, a beautiful narrative journey through 16th Century Bavaria. It is coming to Xbox consoles and PC this November. 
Revealed during today’s Xbox &amp; Bethesda Games Showcase, Pentiment looks like quite the departure from what Obsidian has released over the past few years. Nonetheless, the project looks fascinating. The game features quite a unique visual style that looks reminiscent of an old medieval painting or book. This makes sense, too, because Pentiment is not an RPG like The Outer Worlds or a survival game like the studio’s Grounded, but rather, a narrative adventure game. 
Check out the trailer for yourself below: 


Here’s how Xbox describes Pentiment in the YouTube trailer description: 
“Set in 16th century Bavaria, Pentiment will take players on a narrative journey through the eyes of Journeyman Artist Andreas Maler during a time of great social unrest. Led by game director Josh Sawyer, this game is brought to life by a talented team inspired by illuminated manuscripts, woodcut prints, and history itself.” 
Pentiment hits Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC this November. 
While waiting for its release, read Game Informer’s review of The Outer Worlds and then read about Obsidian’s next RPG, Avowed.

                              <span>As Dusk Falls, an interactive drama where you make choices that impact the characters&#x27; lives, made an appearance at the Xbox Games Showcase. The trailer, which was captured in-game, not only looked intriguing but also revealed the game&#x27;s launch date. And it&#x27;s next month!
On July 19, you can gear up with friends or solo to experience a story of &quot;betrayal, sacrifice, and resilience.&quot; The trailer, which you can watch above, sheds light on some of the dilemmas and challenges you&#x27;ll have to navigate in a small town. It makes statements like, &quot;Sometimes doing the right thing is doing the wrong thing.&quot; The narrative-driven game will explore the entangled lives of two families across thirty years, and it looks like three characters, in particular, are at the forefront of the experience.
The multiplayer lets you have up to eight players, but it&#x27;s unclear how each person will actually be involved in the process. 
Guess we&#x27;ll know soon enough when As Dusk Falls launches on July 19 for Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC. The game is also a day-one title on Xbox Game Pass.</span>

                              <span>Game creator Hideo Kojima of Kojima Productions joined the Xbox Games Showcase presentation today for a quick but impactful announcement; he and his team are working on a new project in partnership with Xbox.
Unfortunately, he chose to share next to nothing about what the project will be, beyond sharing that it is a “game I have always wanted to make.”
Kojima also implied that it’s a new game, and thus likely not part of any existing franchise. He also spoke briefly about Microsoft’s cloud technology, suggesting that the project might leverage that capability as well.
It’s not much to go on, but it’s an interesting new direction for the studio and auteur, as Kojima has more recently been connected to Sony and its PlayStation brand.
It will be especially interesting to see what shape this new project will take as we learn more, but that may be quite a long way off from now.</span>

When Grounded releases in a few months, it&#x27;ll have every update that&#x27;s been included in its early access period thus far and something that hasn&#x27;t been available yet. The entire story campaign will be playable alone or with friends for the first time, completing the Grounded experience. Along with the whole story mode, new armor and weapon recipes and a fight against a giant Mantis await players when the update hits.
Grounded is available on Game Preview right now on Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC.</span>

In a variety of gameplay clips, creator Todd Howard walked us through various gameplay aspects, revealing that this science-fiction RPG features over 1,000 planets to explore. From barren moons to heavily populated worlds, you can go where you want to see what you discover.
The first locale we see is a moon called Kreet, which is stark in detail with rocky grain terrains and brief flares of color with red plants. In this regard, the color scheme is similar to Star Wars&#x27; Crait from The Last Jedi. Here, we are given our first taste of gameplay, which we see from bo…</span>

                              <span>Today&#x27;s Xbox Games Showcase featured many games – big and small – by a glut of different development teams. Baby Robot Games is a Barcelona-based studio that focuses on supernatural stealth and adventure games. Today, it revealed Ereban: Shadow Legacy, a game where you must harness mystical shadow powers and use high-tech gadgets to uncover the truth about your past to save the universe.
In the trailer, the main character, Ayana, who channels some serious Tron energy with her attire, confronts big mechs. Apparently, Ayana is the last descent of a forgotten race and is key to saving this dying, morally grey universe. The gameplay footage showed her stealthily outsmarting big machines and using an array of powers. She can also stab them through the head, so that&#x27;s pretty cool. She even takes some big falls from huge heights, reminiscent of Assassin&#x27;s Creed. Watch the trailer above to get the full scoop.
Ereban: Shadow Legacy will launch day one on Xbox Game Pass. No release date was revealed.</span>

                              <span>Xbox has a history of showing off some of our favorite indies during its big showcases, and it looks like it&#x27;s keeping that tradition alive and well. During the platform&#x27;s Summer Game Fest event today, we got our first glimpse at a new project from Limbo and Inside lead designer Jeppe Carlsen.
Cocoon, published by Annapurna Interactive, which has a showcase of its own next month, promises to be a mind-bending experience with an undeniably compelling art style. The creators promise to take players &quot;on an adventure across worlds within worlds,&quot; which are represented by a series of unusual glowing orbs in the trailer. The clip begins with a sweeping and stylized view of a desert landscape which is soon disturbed by a blinding beam of white light. Our hero pops out of a mechanical-looking cocoon energized by the laser and appears to be a kind of beetle. We mostly see it grabbing and distributing globes of various colors, which may allow it to jump to different locations.


 There&#x27;s not a lot to glean from this reveal trailer, but the game&#x27;s Steam page goes into a little more detail. 
Cocoon is set to release on Xbox consoles (via Game Pass), Switch, and PC sometime in 2023. The trailer&#x27;s description indicates fans should get ready to &quot;master world-leaping mechanics to unravel a cosmic mystery.&quot;</span>

                              <span>We still don&#x27;t have a firm Diablo IV release date yet (other than 2023), but we now know every class we can play when it eventually releases. The necromancer joins the previously announced barbarian, sorceress, rogue, and druid, all allowing for high levels of customization.
As you dive into dangerous open areas, you&#x27;ll be hunting the disciples of Lilith, the daughter of hatred. In new gameplay footage, developer Blizzard Entertainment says Diablo IV offers over 150 dungeons, along with territories to reclaim, and story sequences that occur as you explore. Some of these story moments could lead to massive boss battles that require numerous players.


Diablo IV offers cross-play between console and PC, and also two-player couch play for people in the same household. If you play a bunch and become incredibly powerful, the game will highlight you as a champion, which other players can see. Along with the high number of dungeons, Blizzard claims the endgame is deep and will continue to expand years after release.
Blizzard says they are close to completing development, but has only given an open 2023 timeframe for release.</span>

                              <span>Koei Tecmo Games and Team Ninja have revealed Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty and it’s coming to Xbox consoles and PC next year. 
Revealed during today’s Xbox &amp; Bethesda Games Showcase, Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty looks quite similar to Team Ninja’s Nioh series in that it features a ninja-like character fighting against not just humans, but monstrous and demonic monsters, too. The reveal trailer, which you can watch below, doesn’t feature any gameplay but it gave us quite the taste of Fallen Dynasty’s world.


As you can see in the trailer above, the character that appears to be the protagonist of Fallen Dynasty is fighting off barbarian enemies before consuming something that turns them into a massive demon dragon monster that looks terrifying. Here’s what the trailer description for Fallen Dynasty says about the game: 
It looks great, albeit a little scary, and fortunately, we don’t have to wait too long to check it out because Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty hits Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC in early 2023.

                          <div class="article-summary-box-inner media-object">
                              <img src="https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/2022/06/12/d4d89ed0/scorn.jpg" loading="lazy" class="media-object__media article-image" />
                            <span class="media-object__text">
                              <span>Ebb Software showed a new trailer for Scorn at today’s Xbox Games Showcase, and the first-person horror adventure continues to look just as disturbing as ever.
Drawing clear lines of inspiration from the famous artist, H.R. Giger, Scorn features some of the same disconcerting imagery that is a part of the art from movies like Alien, in which biological and mechanical elements seem to merge.
The new trailer continues to embrace those elements, with more than a little bit of body horror mixed in for good measure. The video shows numerous instances of disconnected human appendages attached to strange, non-human machines and creatures. And the protagonist appears to be horribly mutilated in the brief glimpses we get of their arms and other body parts.
Ebb has stated in the past that Scorn is aiming for a cohesive “lived-in” world, in which players are thrown in the deep-end by arriving and having to try and grasp what is even happening in the spaces they explore. Environments are said to be maze-like and individual regions are open and exploreable, but interconnected with other distinct spaces.
The developers are also touting the game’s focus on full-body awareness. Rather than have items simply floating in the world and having them picked up by magic, every object is a real thing that your character must lift or move with their own hands, hopefully leading to a greater sense of immersion. And, given the subject matter, a likely greater sense of disquiet.
While the environment and creature design is certainly impressive, I continue to have a number of questions about the nature of gameplay in the project. I’m eager to understand more about the nature of the puzzles and characters that are part of the surreal game world, but this latest trailer does little to illuminate either.
Scorn is headed to Xbox Game Pass, but more generally will be available on Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC, and on the Cloud when it releases on October 21, 2022.</span>

The proposed Freedom to Repair Act 2022 seeks to fix this problem by allowing circumvention in strictly limited circumstances. This week the proposal was labeled &quot;pro-piracy legislation&quot; but is that a fair assessment or an expected overreaction?

                              <span>Sci-fi platformer Planet Of Lana seems like a sweet, scenic adventure with an alien monkey butler, and today’s Future Games Show had a little more gameplay to share. I mentioned Planet Of Lana earlier this week in my Day Of The Devs 2022 round-up, because it featured in that indie showcase too. Check out the trailer if you missed it on Thursday, it’s quite charming.

                              <span>Last year a couple of brothers posted a concept trailer for an FPS horror game that didn&#x27;t exist (named Project Ill). Well, those brothers are now Team Clout and that game now exists, albeit called simply Ill. I&#x27;ve not got much to point you towards - there&#x27;s no Steam Store page, no high-res press screens, no release window. Even calling the video from the Future Games Show a gameplay trailer is taking the biscuit, if not most of the factory floor at McVities. But the vibes, as they say, are immaculate: bare feet on a grubby floor, shambling horrors with many half-glimpsed appendages, and a gun that is surely too small to protect you from any of it. Resident Evil but injected with your most virulent 2022 strain.

                              <span>Palworld has a new trailer. If you&#x27;ve seen Palworld&#x27;s previous two trailers, those words alone should send you rushing below to see what new absurdity is on show. For the uninitiated: Palworld is a game in which you can catch off-brand Pokémon, put them to work in a sweatshop producing guns, and then do battle with these Nopémon by your side and and an assault rifle in your hands.

Watch the trailer, you&#x27;ll see.

                              <span>Back in January of this year RPS regular contributor Edwin Evans-Thirlwell interviewed Ami Y. Cai, developer of The Cartomancy Anthology, as part of his efforts to dig into the mystery of why tarot is such a popular inspiration for indie games at the moment. Happily, after today&#x27;s Future Of Play Direct, we can provide you with a little update on that story: Cai&#x27;s expansive collaborative project is due to release on Steam very soon: on August 9th, 2022.

                              <span>Tinykin is about an astronaut named Milo returning to earth after a long space voyage. Milo might reasonably fall to his knees and scream &quot;You blew it up, damn you!&quot; when he gets there, because the earth he lands upon has been blown up several times larger than normal - either that or he&#x27;s been made much smaller and is now the size of a penny. Milo must then have to navigate the abandoned world with a Pikmin-like army of aliens by his side, ready to solve puzzles. 

It looks great, and after being announced last year, Tinykin now has a release date of August 30th.

                              <span>If there&#x27;s anything I&#x27;ve learned from today&#x27;s Future Of Play event, it&#x27;s that stylish futuristic dystopian mysteries are where it&#x27;s at right now in the indie scene, and I for one am all in favour. One of the coolest announcements at the event was Hill Agency: PURITYdecay, described as an &quot;Indigenous cybernoir detective game&quot; and in the works at Achimostawinan Games. Although maybe &quot;in the works&quot; isn&#x27;t quite an accurate description, because the game is in fact out very soon: on August 31st this year, to be exact.
The trailer is a pitch-perfect hearkening back to the golden age hardboiled detective stories of the 1940s — complete with a black-and-white palette with just the occasional hint of colour to highlight the high-tech parts. High-tech because, despite its 20th century influences, this game is set quite far in the future, in 2262. It&#x27;s not exactly a nice vision of the world in 240 years&#x27; time, though, as the narrator is quick to point out that it&#x27;s riddled with &quot;crime, conflict, and propaganda&quot;. Truly holding up a mirror to our times, then.

Some more footage of the thwack ‘em up platformer was shown off at today’s Future Games Show. You can stroke your beard and make approving sounds at it, if you watch the trailer below.

                              <span>Sunday Gold, revealed at the Future Games Show tonight, has a lot going on under the hood, so bear with me. In Sunday Gold you play a team of three crims and... well, I can&#x27;t explain it better than the steam blurb, which says &quot;experience a unique hybrid of escape room style puzzles, turn-based combat, and RPG mechanics tied together with a dark and cinematic storyline.&quot; So, er, Blending a few things, here. Key takeaway is that everyone in this has a faced like a slapped Bulldog&#x27;s bum. Nobody is having a fun time.

                              <span>Bramble: The Mountain King is an action-adventure game inspired by grim Nordic folktales, where the bosses you&#x27;ll encounter may have some horrible backstory which explains why they now drown people for funsies. It&#x27;s also seemingly a game where you&#x27;re a wee smout and can ride on the back of a friendly hedgehog. There&#x27;s a new trailer which covers both of these elements below.

                              <span>I adore Deadly Premonition, a game which shines despite substantial elements being janky or bad. The 2010 horror game about an oddball FBI agent investigating ritual murders in small-town America is not &quot;so bad it&#x27;s good&quot;, it&#x27;s so good it doesn&#x27;t matter that it&#x27;s bad (and maybe the badness even amplifies the good). Well, I&#x27;ve been playing Deadly Premonition 2 ahead of its PC release today, and I&#x27;m sorry to say the sequel does not shake out the same way. Despite some bright spots, enough of Deadly Premonition 2 is bad that I&#x27;ve given up.

In the former we got a bit of a primer on Tove Jansson&#x27;s work as the source material for this game, but in the latter we got a better look at the game in motion - plus news that ethereal Icelandic rockers Sigur Rós are collaborating on the sound track.

                              <span>One of the most intriguing new announcements at today&#x27;s Future Of Play event had to be Psychroma, a cyberpunk horror adventure game in the works by indie developer/publisher Rocket Adrift Games. The devs describe their game as a narrative-driven side-scroller where you play as a digital medium. Imagine something halfway between Observer and Detention, then, and you&#x27;ll be on the right lines.
The trailer harks back to the point-and-click mysteries beloved of my misspent youth, which really fits in with Psychroma&#x27;s whole retro futuristic vibe. It&#x27;s got that clever pixel art style that looks exactly how you remember golden age adventure games looking in the &#x27;90s, which of course means that it&#x27;s much, much more polished and modern than those games ever were.

                              <span>Revealed at the Future Games Show tonight, Tray Racers is a game clearly derived from a dev accidentally doing a spoonerism in a meeting one time. This SEO nightmare is being developed by Bit Loom, the team behind colourful yet somehow unsettling puzzle game Phogs, and it&#x27;s about racing down sand dunes on trays. As the trailer says, &quot;the world ended... But the fun didn’t!&quot;, and I guess winning a dune race would take your mind off the unending horror for a bit.

He earned millions of dollars and traveled the world, but also spent time in prison. Despite being wanted by the FBI for his alleged involvement with Nintendo hacking group Team Xecuter, Louarn doesn&#x27;t view himself as a criminal, but as a rebel instead.

Za výpočtem stojí  Emma Haruka Iwao z Google a k výpočtu byl použit Google Cloud se 128 virtuálními CPU a 864 GB RAM. Při výpočtu není až tak důležitá hrubá síla, jako spíše úložiště. K dispozici bylo 663 TB, z toho bylo použito 515 TB. Celkově bylo zapsáno 38,5 PB a přečteno 43,5 PB.</span>

A US court previously issued orders for all ISPs to block the sites and instructed third-party service providers to cease doing business with them. The plaintiffs say that since Cloudflare is refusing to comply, the company should be held in contempt of court.

                              <span>The US Copyright Office&#x27;s inquiry on the option to add mandatory copyright protection measures in the DMCA has led to some interesting responses. They include a suggestion to add &quot;VPN detection&quot; tools to prevent people from engaging in &quot;geo-piracy&quot;. This request, unsurprisingly, comes from a company that offers a VPN detection service.

The first of its kind in Canada, the flexible injunction was obtained by companies including Rogers, Bell, The Sports Network, and Groupe TVA. Unusually, it will be independently audited to assess over-blocking and any user circumvention via VPNs.

                              <span>A few months have passed since we released ScummVM 2.5.1.
No matter if you expect the scorching heat of the upcoming summer or freezing blizzards in winter (depending on your favorite hemisphere): it’s release time again!
Our lovely developers added support, yet again, for a bunch of new ancient games that require testing:
Sanitarium
Hades Challenge
Marvel Comics Spider-Man: The Sinister Six
The 11th Hour
Clandestiny
Tender Loving Care (CD-ROM Editions)
Uncle Henry&#x27;s Playhouse
Wetlands
Chewy: Esc from F5
Besides these games, we’d appreciate it if you could check our release testing list - maybe you’ll even find your favorite game on there that has been sitting on that shelf for way too long.
And since ScummVM is about playing games in general, we’ve seen quite a bunch of changes across many, many engines - so this is the perfect time for giving your favorites another go.
The AGOS, SCI and SCUMM engine received some really extensive modifications which make all games using those engines very good testing targets as well.
All testing must be done with stable builds, not development ones. Please report any bugs or oddities on our issue tracker.
A detailed list of all exciting new features and fixes is available in our NEWS file.
Thank you very much for your support!

                              <span>After an extended period of time, we&#x27;re finally ready to announce that the game Chewy: ESC From F5 is ready for testing. This quirky game features the protagonist Chewy as he tries to outwit the evil Borks. Escaping from their high security zone, F5, will just be the start of his adventure.
If any of you have the game and are willing to test it out, we&#x27;ll welcome any feedback. You will need a daily development build. As always, please submit the bug reports to our issue tracker. 
Please note that the ScummVM version does have one major outstanding issue: the music used by the game is in a custom format we&#x27;ve been unable to properly support yet. So only sound effects and speech currently work at this time.

                              <span>A few days ago, Google announced the list of students accepted for this year&#x27;s Google Summer of Code.
We are very proud to welcome 4 students this year who will be working on various parts of the project during the upcoming months.
Pragyansh Chaturvedi (aka Raikou) will work on improving our DIRECTOR engine. His effort will help us to allow support for many 90s-era adventure games made with the Macromedia Director authoring tools. By implementing more internal functions used by DIRECTOR, Pragyansh&#x27;s main objective is to extend support for Meet Mediaband and The Journeyman Project (Win and Mac), making them fully playable without any glitches.
Michael Hayman (aka Quote58) is about to implement support for The Immortal. The game (released in 1990) can be described as a mix of genres involving RPG elements with action and puzzles. Many changes across different game variants (written in pure assembly code!) will make this an interesting challenge. This project is a continuation of a GSoC task initially started by a former student back in 2018.
Emanuele Grisenti (aka grisenti) will be working on a new engine, HPL1. The original sources for this engine got recently released by the original developer Frictional Games under GPLv3. The purpose of this project is to achieve a full port of this engine to ScummVM, with the goal of supporting the 2007 survival game Penumbra: Overture.
Avijeet Maurya (aka StableSteady) will pick up several incomplete engines: MacVenture, Avalanche, Glk-Scott, Pink and WAGE. Some of these engines are very close to completion, but not quite there yet. The main objective of Avijeet&#x27;s task is to identify all missing features and fix existing bugs. The goal for his project is to bring the above engines to a stable state.
The team is very excited about the upcoming weeks – and we hope you are as well.
Please give a warm welcome to our new students! Let&#x27;s make GSoC 2022 a huge success – together!
