                              <span>The Samsung Odyssey G7 is one of the best gaming monitors in the world - or at least, that&#x27;s what I keep telling myself after buying one last year. This is a 32-inch model, offering a 2560x1440 resolution, a 240Hz refresh rate and a DisplayHDR 600 certification that means it actually delivers impactful HDR - a rarity at this price point. Anyway, it&#x27;s down to £499 today after a £100 discount, so listen up - here&#x27;s why I rate this monitor so highly.

That&#x27;s fine. Honestly, I haven&#x27;t finished half the games I&#x27;ve bought, and I&#x27;ve long since stopped thinking about &#x27;The Backlog&#x27; as if I ever will. But I might enjoy this one week of exploring a gorgeous desert, climbing and gliding and hoverbiking, and you might too.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve long been excited about the possibilities offered by upcoming tidying things up nicely game A Little To The Left, and back in May this year Alice0 (one of us is RPS&#x27;s Mirror Universe Alice, but nobody knows which) finally had a crack at it. The way she wanted to organise keys wasn&#x27;t what the game thought was the right way, and her article examined this frustration; she described the canonical correct solution as being that of a &quot;domestic Joker&quot;.
The developers at Max Inferno Studios read this article and decided that, you know what? Alice0 was on to something. They contacted us to let us know that her piece was the inspiration for adding a feature called Let It Be, a skip puzzle function that you can access at any time. Anne Macmillan, who&#x27;s a co-founder of Max Inferno Studios as well as artist and animator for A Little To The Left, was kind enough to talk to me about it.

                              <span>Friends, let me admit something up top. I am the most tedious of Dead Rising apologists. I love its in-game timer. I adore its linear mission structure that is completely at odds with the expansive semi-open world shopping mall in which it takes place. Hell, I even like its severely stripped down Wii port. I firmly believe that Dead Rising is an all-time great, but also understand why folks have (reasonably) cooled on the game’s particular quirks.

                              <span>Hello, yes, it’s me, once again banging on about the WD Blue SN570. I just think it’s neat: a highly affordable yet remarkably quick M.2 SSD, with multiple capacities to choose from and regular sales making it even cheaper. Speaking of, today is the last day of the Amazon Prime Early Access Sale, which has the 1TB Blue SN570 down to £65.
That’s not quite its lowest price ever, but it does match its flash sale pricing during Prime Day back in July. And is an utter pittance for a 1TB NVMe SSD, let alone one that’s actually quite speedy. Amazon UK also have the 2TB version on sale for £128, just £1 more than its lowest dip on record (Prime Day 2022 again, as it happens). These prices are only available to Prime members, but the Blue SN570 ranks highly among the best SSDs for gaming, so they&#x27;re well deserving of your cash if you’re in need of PC storage improvements.

Each and every week the game pile grows higher, forming the walls of a virtually impenetrable digital structure known only as the ‘backlog’. As the games multiply, thickening the increasingly cell-like walls of our den of entertainment, we can only gaze on and hope it doesn’t one day become our tomb. On that light note, it’s nice to see that SteamDB now has a section showing what games are coming out on Steam every week.

                              <span>If there&#x27;s one thing that brings stability to my life, it&#x27;s the escapism of reality TV. Below Deck: Mediterranean had me covered last winter (alongside its Sailing Yacht spin-off), as I watched super yacht crew toil to meet the demands of the wealthy and unhinged. Then Love Island stepped up to fill a large portion of my summer with curated chaos. One guy confessed &quot;I licked her tit or whatever,&quot; in a shock revelation to his betrothed.
What&#x27;s on the reality TV menu for winter? Ainori Love Wagon: Asian Journey, baby. It&#x27;s on Netflix and I&#x27;m convinced it shares great parallels with some of my favourite RPGs of all time.

                              <span>Defining boomer shooter Doom, like Skyrim, is one of those games that’ll eventually be ported to everything. Microwaves. Checkouts. Voight-Kampff machines maybe, in the years to come. Right dang today though, you can (almost) play Doom in Notepad, or DOOMpad as its creator Samperson calls it. Catch a glimpse of the ripping and tearing in action by watching the video below.

                              <span>Cultic has really good headshots. I mean, it also has a lot of other things going for it, but it feels rude not to highlight this right at the very top because I think it’s important. Cultic’s headshots are sensational. Enemy noggins pop with a squelchy crack that tickles a very unnerving part of my brain, the resulting blood fountain spraying so high it causes the ceiling to drip with human juice long after your hopeless adversary has slumped to the floor. It’s gross. But. You know. It’s also kind of great.

Yes, DLSS 3 is the real deal. And no, neither of those make the RTX 4090 good value for money, even if it makes a compelling argument for Nvidia&#x27;s latest upscaling tech.

At the time it was swiftly shot down as an obvious joke, and I was shamed, but now the freeware game based on a ten-second joke in a 1997 episode of The Simpsons is out. So who&#x27;s laughing now, eh? Play it for yourself via creator Macaw45&#x27;s itch.

Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier has waded in to allege that, while there will be some fresh COD in the offing, it’ll be in the form of something like a paid expansion for the upcoming Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 instead of a full game. A Modern Warfare 2.5, if you will.

Devs Volition insist this one’s just concentrating on hunting down and squashing the game’s many bugs. As we noted when it was released in August, Saints Row has rather a few technical issues. While Volition say this means they’re not at the stage where they can be “talking about roadmaps and expansions”, they are at least releasing a free cosmetic pack this week that includes some boots that look like bananas.

Japanese publisher Aksys Games has announced that it is preparing to host its newest live stream presentation in just a few days&#x27; time — The All Aksys Fall 2022 showcase will take place on Thursday, October 20, wherein the publisher will spotlight its catalog of new and upcoming releases.

AkSys Games currently holds publishing IP rights to a wide variety of anime-themed fighters, RPGs, and shmups — have delivered such fine titles as Deathsmiles, Under Night InBirth, and, most recently, goofy shooter Miss Kobayashi’s Dragon Maid: Burst Forth !! Choro-gon Breath.
If you want to check out the live stream for yourself, then tune into the official Aksys Games Twitch or YouTube channels at 10:00 PT / 13:00 ET / 18:00 BST, and you can catch up on all the hot deets. We will, of course, be bringing you some of the scoops right here on Destructoid. So maybe you can just sit back and let us do all the work for you. Lazy.

                              <span>Subscription service the cornerstone of Xbox brand
According to new statistics published by Brazil&#x27;s Administrative Council for Economic Defence (CADE), celebrated subscription service Xbox Game Pass raked in a staggering $2.9 billion USD in revenue over the course of 2021. The figure was published in a CADE report on the Microsoft/Blizzard acquisition.
The figure, shared by TweakTown and reported by GamesIndustry.biz, offers up one of the first dollar amounts for the increasingly popular service, which offers its subscribers access to a huge library of new and classic games on both the Xbox and PC platforms. No further information about the eye-watering figure was released, with the figure focusing solely on Xbox subscribers, eschewing PC players.
Assuming that the listed figure is accurate, Xbox Game Pass makes up something in the region of 18% of all Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox revenue for 2021 — a year that generated a total revenue of just over $16 billion. The Xbox Game Pass service has continued to grow in both its userbase and its global reputation since its initial launch in the summer of 2017, and currently boasts a huge 25 million subscribers.
Earlier this year, Sony Interactive Entertainment launched its own Game Pass competitor in the form of the revamped PlayStation Plus service, which utilizes a tier-based system to offer games from all eras of the PlayStation platform to its subscribers. Subscription gaming is fast proving itself both rewarding for the players themselves, and very profitable for the publishers, leading one to wonder whether future generations of console gaming will explore the possibilities of gaming subscriptions as a core concept.

                              <span>The Switch version was updated to 1.1.0
No More Heroes 3 Japanese audio is in, thanks to a new patch that also coincides with the launch of the game on PC, PS4/PS5, and Xbox One/Xbox Series X.
The Switch patch isn&#x27;t massive, but brings the game up to version 1.1.0, and adds a new Japanese voice option to the game. It&#x27;s enough to get me to play it again for sure!
As for the rest of the versions, the PS4, PS5, and Xbox editions were all touched in some way. The PS4 port had the least to fix (minor bugs), while the PS5 version has a small handful of fixes (including jump and dodge button flipping). That same swath of fixes applies to both the Xbox One and Xbox Series X ports.
So if you&#x27;re having issues, update your game! It usually goes without saying, but just in case you assumed you could play it day one while offline. You can find the full patch rundown below!

                              <span>The Paldea region&#x27;s Poke-influencer is revealed
Today&#x27;s Pokemon Scarlet and Violet trailer has premiered, showcasing the debut of a new Gym Leader. Iono is an Electric-type Gym Leader in Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, which launches for Nintendo Switch on November 18.
The new video centered on Iono and her livestream antics. The Gym Leader is also a streamer and influencer on the side. As an Electric-type Leader too, her Magnemite hair clips are a pretty cool accessory.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;U9HAaHc3wnc
The video caps off with a &quot;guess that Pokemon&quot; segment. Iono does a 20 Questions-style game where her viewers ask questions about her partner Pokemon, trying to deduce which one it might be.
Hints include the Pokemon being squishy, not being Magnemite, and being sluggish with an easy-going vibe. It has two &quot;big ol&#x27; bumps on its noggin&quot; that people mistake for eyes, and it is an Electric-type Pokemon. Its body also expands to generate electricity, and it&#x27;s cute.
Honestly, I have no clue. My bet would be that this is a tease for a future Paldean-region Pokemon reveal for Scarlet and Violet. Wiglett and Grafaiai were also teased before being fully revealed.
Paths to Pokemon victory
At least we now have another Gym Leader to add to the list. We&#x27;ve already seen Ice-type Leader Grusha and Grass-type Leader Brassius.
These three, alongside the other heads of different Gyms, will make up one of Pokemon Scarlet and Violet&#x27;s storylines. But there are two other ones as well.
On the Path of Legends, for example, you&#x27;ll go off in search of rare special ingredients. And in another, you take on this generation&#x27;s antagonistic crew Team Star. From a recent trailer, it seems like that will also be an area where the auto-battle mechanic will come in handy.
It won&#x27;t be long until we have to face off against Iono and the other Gym Leaders either, as Pokemon Scarlet and Violet go live on November 18.

Bayonetta 3 is nearly here after a years-long wait, and amidst its release, we have some Hideki Kamiya Switch thoughts. Those are arguably the best kind of Kamiya thoughts.
Speaking to VGC (alongside of Platinum vice president and CBO Takao Yamane and CEO Atsushi Inaba), vice president Kamiya chimed in on several industry topics (as he does!) and touched on a theoretical follow-up to the Nintendo Switch: as well as how he currently engages with his current hardware, and the hobby in general.
Here&#x27;s Kamiya&#x27;s full rundown on the issue:
&quot;And that’s exactly how we approached Bayonetta 3: we had to make use of the full potential of the hardware that we have. And as I said, this mentality will be the same on every hardware platfor…</span>

Nintendo&#x27;s colorful arena shooter series made its grand return last month, with the arrival of madcap multiplayer release Splatoon 3 — And, according to new figures in Famitsu, it appears to have had nothing less than the proverbial blockbuster launch, raking in physical and digital sales worldwide and taking the retail market by storm in Japan in particular.
In fact, for September 2021, Splatoon 3 sold 2.7 million physical copies in the territory, which accounts for an incredible 69% of all of Japan&#x27;s gaming retail for the month in question. Previously, Nintendo had already celebrated Splatoon 3 shifting 3.45 million copies in a mere three days, making it Japan&#x27;s fastest-selling Nintendo Switch release ever. Splatoon 3 has been the most dominant seller in …</span>

Now that the stellar anime series Edgerunners has seemingly made everyone forget the disaster that was the Cyberpunk 2077 launch, the merchandising machine can move back into full gear — Presented for your consideration: An original novel set within CDPR&#x27;s hi-tech universe, which will release in 2023.
The novel &quot;No Coincidence&quot; is not a direct adaptation of its source material&#x27;s narrative, but will instead be a standalone story from the avenues and alleyways of Night City. Penned by Polish author Rafał Kosik, the book will no doubt contain the sleazy customers, upmarket locales, and dangerous dealings of the gorgeous-looking, but ultimately extremely dangerous &#x27;berg.
The Cyberpunk 2077 team has also confirmed that No Coincidence is a full novel, not a comic book.
https://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1580105868347342849?s&#x3D;20&amp;t&#x3D;jVbwkNBh3FNBa4_tiA4ETw
No doubt the literary adventures of Cyberpunk 2077&#x27;s metal mickeys and minnies will help plug the gap while players wait for DLC expansion Phantom Liberty, which is also currently scheduled for launch at some point in 2023. Earlier this month, CD Projekt RED confirmed that Cyberpunk 2077 will be receiving a sequel at some point in the far-flung future. So while it might have had something of a rough start, it seems that CDPR is hoping to get its slippery new franchise back on stable rails.
Cyberpunk 2077 is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

Warner Bros Games&#x27; fun platform scrapper MultiVersus has received a fresh update, bringing with it a selection of gameplay tweaks, some spooky-ooky Halloween content, and a brand new character in the form of the vicious and malevolent gremlin, Stripe.
Version 1.04, now available on PC and console platforms, sees Stripe join the star-studded roster as one of Season 1&#x27;s additional characters. Wielding a chainsaw and crossbow, the Assassin class fighter will utilize speed and power in lieu of health and defensive abilities. The little bastard is a pretty frightening opponent, and Gizmo better ensure that he&#x27;s stocked up on flaming Tippex to take this punk down.

And speaking of frightening, the new update includes a selection of Halloween-themed Elite skins for some of the MultiVe…</span>

                              <span>There are some strings on me
Ever wanted a living Cuphead for your very own? Well, merchandiser iam8bit has the next best thing, opening pre-orders on a special Collector&#x27;s Edition of Studio MDHR&#x27;s excellent 2017 platformer.
The Cuphead Collector&#x27;s Edition offers up a boxed physical copy of Cuphead — complete with its Delicious Last Course DLC — on PS4, Xbox One, or Nintendo Switch, alongside several suitably old-school goodies. These include a membership card for The Cuphead Club; six art cards or newspaper-style &quot;funnies&quot;; a sweet, hand-cranked music box; a map of the Inkwell Islands, and an exclusive outer sleeve for your game case, all of which are in keeping with Cuphead&#x27;s classic cartoon style.
The centerpiece of the collector&#x27;s edition, however, is an utterly delightful marionette of old crockery skull himself. Standing eight inches in height and sporting a weathered design, the super cute puppet will allow Cuphead fans to entertain/frighten their friends and family members with fun little performances... Or just hang him on the back of your bedroom door. Whatever works for you.

As a fun additional touch, the collector&#x27;s edition box doubles as a stage, complete with an &quot;asbestos curtain&quot;, so you have a charming little ramshackle display case for your new string-based pal. The marionette was designed by legendary Prague studio Rici Marionettes, with the team&#x27;s loving attention to detail reflected in the model&#x27;s authentic look and turn-of-the-century build.
It&#x27;s good day for a great pre-order, and if you want in, then you can bag the Cuphead Collector&#x27;s Edition over on the iam8bit website right now, priced at $199.99 USD. The box set is expected to ship in the first quarter of 2023. For those of you who are simply looking for the game itself, then standard boxed editions of Cuphead will launch on PS4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch on December 6.

According to murmurs circulating the information superhighway this week, Activision might be considering eschewing its annual Call of Duty release in 2023, and is instead looking into the potential of instead releasing a DLC expansion for this year&#x27;s entry, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II.
The speculative news comes from regular Call of Duty leaker TheGhostofHope, who posted the proposal on their Twitter account this past weekend. According to TheGhost, Activision will instead use 2023 to boost the content of 2021&#x27;s release, adding new campaign missions, and a 20th anniversary &quot;Best of&quot; map pack, featuring revamped multiplayer maps from the billion-dollar shooter&#x27;s storied history.

Yet another live-service mobile title is being readied for the scrap heap — No big surprise, perhaps, but this particular example is branded with one of the most recognizable gaming IPs of all time. Square Enix has announced that Final Fantasy VII: The First Soldier, will be ending service in January 2023.
Originally launched November 2021, Final Fantasy VII: The First Soldier is a free-to-play title that tells of the formative years of the Shinra Corporation and its dedicated and ruthless merc army, SOLDIER. Following the typical battle royale format, The First Soldier tasked 75 custom characters with fighting it out in an ever-decreasing circle, procuring weapons and materia on-site in a bid to be the Last Soldier Standing.

                              <span>Unveiled at Nintendo Live 2022
Recently, Nintendo held a &quot;Nintendo Live 2022&quot; celebration in Tokyo, Japan, which included concerts for both Splatoon 3 and Animal Crossing: New Horizons. But they also had a few other things on display, like this Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom statue.
Link is donning his newer outfit, complete with a badass shonen cape, a bow, a sword, and a killer arm. The detail on the chain links of his armor and his gloves (and the belt!) are excellent: and the base he&#x27;s on gives off the aura of &quot;dilapidated stone,&quot; which fits the dire/ruin theme of the game we&#x27;ve seen thus far.
Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom (which we know is pronounced like &quot;tears of joy&quot;) is due out on May 12, 2023. It feels like it&#x27;s been a long time coming, and it kind of will be! Zelda: Breath of the Wild was released in March of 2017, so by then, it&#x27;ll be a whopping six years since it launched alongside of the Switch.
I literally can&#x27;t believe it! I&#x27;ve talked about this often, but Breath of the Wild is still deeply relevant, and I have to constantly double and triple check to make sure I didn&#x27;t get the release date wrong.

                              <span>Don&#x27;t be suspicious, don&#x27;t be suspicious
A virtual reality version of a very popular impostor game hits headsets soon. Among Us VR arrives on November 10 for Steam and Meta Quest.
This version of Among Us is a collaboration between Schell Games, Innersloth, and Robot Teddy. The new version will run for $9.99, and you can find it on the Steam store here or over at the Quest storefront.
As you can tell from the trailers we&#x27;ve seen thus far, this is essentially first-person VR Among Us. Players take on the role of different crewmates, all trying to complete their tasks on the ship. Meanwhile, one or some of them are impostors, and their goal is take out the crew while not getting caught.

A brand-new perspective
Among Us VR will support four to ten players in a match. VR players can only play with other VR players, though. And it looks like the level included so far is called Skeld II, a 3D made-for-virtual-reality version of the Skeld from classic Among Us.
The old mini-games will return, as will some new ones just for VR. And of course, there&#x27;s the difference in perspective. While 2D Among Us takes an overhead view, Among Us VR goes fully first-person. Seeing someone vent in VR will probably be terrifying.

Alongside the news of Among Us VR&#x27;s release date, today&#x27;s Meta Connect showcase also held a few more big reveals. Meta has picked up several gaming studios, including Iron Man VR developer Camouflaj, Twisted Pixel, and Armature Studio, the team behind Resident Evil 4&#x27;s Meta Quest adaptation.
Meta also unveiled its new virtual reality headset, the Meta Quest Pro. It&#x27;s a high-end piece of hardware that comes with a hefty price tag. Among Us VR, meanwhile, can run on the Meta Quest 2 or on other headsets via Steam.

I think it&#x27;s pretty safe to say that Mario is one of the most instantly recognizable and beloved video game characters in history, and I think we chose well to have him represent the medium we hold so dear. There are many facts to what makes Mario so universally adored (which is in no small part thanks to the decades-spanning voice performance of Charles Martinet), but one of them is his chunky little character design, which doesn&#x27;t look as prominent in his upcoming movie.
Even compared to other human characters on the roster like Princess Peach, Mario&#x27;s proportions are much more distinct. He&#x27;s short, he&#x27;s round, and his little circular torso acts as the point from which the rest of his limbs emanate. It&#x27;s an iconic look, and considering we&#x27;ve seen it so many times …</span>

Welcome back! It is a new Tuesday, which means tonight there will be a new episode of Spot Dodge Podcast exclusively on Destructoid. Topics: With the controversy around the web regarding Sony possibly remaking/remastering Horizon Zero Dawn, I thought it&#x27;d be fun to do a roundtable discussion about what our favorite and actually necessary remakes/remasters have been throughout the years.

A quick note before we begin: The following interview was conducted prior to the news that lead designer Robert Kurvitz, artist Aleksander Rostov, and writer Helen Hindpere had all departed from developer ZA/UM, apparently under involuntary circumstances. This feature is focused entirely on Sea Power&#x27;s work on Disco Elysium, but if you want more context around the recent news regarding ZA/UM, you can check out our coverage for more details.

Last week&#x27;s announcement of the Pokémon-themed Splatfest coming to Splatoon 3 in November introduced us to three particularly neat-looking t-shirts commemorating the collaboration.

The details of the interview have leaked ahead of the publication of issue #1767 of Weekly Famitsu, and in the snippet, Yamamoto highlights that a few things have been optimised, such as &quot;the number of the pieces of debris that blow away for each model.

Soon to celebrate its fifth anniversary on the Switch, Rocket League has now been hit with a new update addressing in-game bugs and adding new content.
The update sees two new arenas added alongside an Esports shop. Changes and modifications have also been made to the game itself, dominantly around the &#x27;cage&#x27; ball indicator.

There is a moment in a young person&#x27;s life — a brief window, around 13 years of age — when their internal maelstrom of hormones, peer pressure, and insecurity reaches its peak, turning the teen into soft, malleable putty, ready to be coaxed into a fandom by the next influential moment that comes along. These fandoms range from books (Harry Potter) to movies (Pirates of the Caribbean) to real-life people (any attractive actor, really) — but it&#x27;s music that defines that adolescent era unlike any other medium.
For me, it was emo music, which thankfully/horrifyingly is back in vogue right now, but it can be just about anything. The boy you like is into Irish folk? Alright, now you&#x27;re into Irish folk, with an encyclopaedic knowledge of shillelaghs that you&#x27;re hoping will impress him. Somehow. Your boyfriend has two tickets to see Iron Maiden, baby? Fantastic. Time to learn what the past twenty years has in store for you, metal-wise. For modern teens, TikTok is a culture-shaper, as the songs that people choose to accompany their short videos can become chart-toppers through sheer exposure (and catchiness).

Halloween is a good excuse for lots of different things — getting dressed up, overindulging in chocolate, and drinking some very nice warm (or cold) beverages. But also, sales! And Ubisoft is taking advantage of the spooky season by offering up to 75% off of multiple digital titles on the North American eShop.
From now until 11:59pm PT on 25th October (we&#x27;ll ignore that it ends before Halloween), you can get savings on games such as Scott Pilgrim vs. The World: The Game – Complete Edition, Assassin&#x27;s Creed: The Ezio Collection, and Immortals Fenyx Rising Gold Edition. Those are just a few picks, though — here&#x27;s what you can nab from Ubisoft&#x27;s Spooky Sale!

Today&#x27;s Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet trailer is here! And it&#x27;s quite a bit different to the past few reveals we&#x27;ve seen. It&#x27;s not an official Pokémon reveal, nor is it a rundown of any mechanics. Nope, we&#x27;re watching a &quot;livestream&quot; from the Paldea region&#x27;s Electric-type Gym Leader, Iono!
This bubbly, bouncy trainer is the leader of Levincia&#x27;s gym who is a streamer and influencer. She&#x27;s very expressive and electric, with two Magnemite-like hair accessories and a very pastel-coloured head of hair. But she wants us to play a game — who&#x27;s that Pokémon? Or, &quot;Who&#x27;s Iono&#x27;s Partner?&quot;, sorry.

It is a fact that we are going to have to come to accept that at some point in all of our lives we will become a playable character in Fortnite. It is the natural order of things. Joining the likes of Spider-Man, Darth Vader and, erm, The Rock, Dwayne Johnson has taken to Twitter to announce that a Black Adam skin will be dropping into the game soon.
Despite the huge amount of hype that Johnson seems to be single-handedly churning out for the upcoming DC superhero flick, public excitement seems pretty low. What is the best way to get people interested in your movie? We hear you ask. It&#x27;s to release a Fortnite skin, of course - that&#x27;s sure to bring the youngsters around! Black Adam is doing just that, with The Rock taking to Twitter to announce that his latest Fortnite skin will be fully revealed tomorrow alongside the film&#x27;s world premier.

                              <span>Find the truth behind a whole new set of grizzly murders.
The Science Adventure series of visual novels usually don’t share much in common aside from a shared universe and an unusual naming convention, but Chaos;Child is the most direct sequel the series has seen so far. Set six years after the events of Chaos;Head Noah, this game offers a similar experience, with players taking control of a high school student investigating a series of grisly murders.
Unlike Chaos;Head Noah, this isn’t the first time that English-speaking fans have been able to play an official release of Chaos;Child. The Switch version is the newest port by Spike Chunsoft, which you can buy both individually or as part of a double-pack with Chaos;Head Noah.

After hearing that the UK and European releases of the Xenoblade Chronicles 3 Collector&#x27;s Edition would be pushed back to the first half of October, it has been an anxious wait to find out when (or, indeed, if) the release would drop. Well, the Collector&#x27;s Edition is finally here and, predictably, the My Nintendo Store was not prepared for it.
Nintendo of Europe has today sent an email saying that pre-orders are now open for the game&#x27;s special edition and you can visit the My Nintendo Store to bag a copy.

The Analogue Pocket platform has become a hub for a bunch of wonderful cores that allow us to play classics in the palm of our hands — literally. Now, it looks like a pretty unusual FPGA core is coming to the system: the Pokémon Mini, a tiny little handheld console that launched in 2001.
Time Extension spotted the tease on Twitter from well-known Analogue Pocket core porter Adam Gastineau. The core was originally developed by Nick Tasios, but will also be available to download for your Analogue Pocket sometime soon. So, alongside your NES, Game Boy/Game Boy Colour, SNES, Mega Drive, and Neo Geo cores, you&#x27;ve now got Nintendo&#x27;s smallest, lightest-ever handheld coming to the system.

What is with this slate of large Pokémon plushies that keep coming up? We love them, of course — recently we&#x27;ve had Spheal (which you can now buy worldwide) and Altaria, among many others. And now, Cynthia&#x27;s ace Garchomp is entering the gigantic Pokémon plush ring.
This 160cm long plush was shared online by PokéJungle (via Nintendo Soup) and will be available to pre-order Premium Bandai Japan&#x27;s store later today, 12th October. 160cm means it&#x27;s around 5&#x27;2&quot;, so it&#x27;s only a little bit shorter that this writer! And, given that Garchomp is laying down and seems to be having a nap, it looks like it&#x27;s the perfect sleeping buddy.

In case you needed a reminder, Bayonetta 3 is launching later this month on October 28th - this month, Umbra Witches! It&#x27;s crazy to think that prior to September 2021, we hadn&#x27;t the foggiest idea when this game would show up, and now it&#x27;s almost here.
The lucky ducks over at Game Informer have managed to get extensive hands-on time with Bayonetta 3 and are currently showcasing various aspects of the game on the outlet&#x27;s YouTube channel. The first video is a relatively brief overview of everything new in the sequel, including the rather fancy &#x27;Demon Masquerade&#x27; mechanic, environmental puzzles, side activities, and the introduction of &#x27;Embryos&#x27; as the game&#x27;s primary currency. You can check out this video above.

So for your viewing pleasure today are some initial AMD Ryzen 9 7950X benchmarks under Microsoft Windows 11 22H2 up against Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS and a near-final development snapshot of the upcoming Ubuntu 22.10.</span>

Výhodou Rustové implementace je to, že vedle rychlejšího běhu oproti GNU Coreutils benefitují i ze zabezpečení paměti a dalších výhod Rustu oproti C.</span>

                              <span>Final Fantasy VII The First Soldier, the mobile multiplayer battle royale, is being shut down in January. The news comes a month shy of the game&#x27;s one-year anniversary, having launched for iOS and Android in November 2021. 
Square Enix states that it feels it hasn’t delivered the experience it aimed for, so it will begin winding down service starting today. A roadmap on the game’s website lists a three-step sunsetting schedule. Today, you can no longer purchase Shinra credits from the shop, but you can still spend the credits you own until the game shuts down. On November 1, support for non-English localization ends (meaning text will only be displayed in English going forward). Finally, on January 11, The First Soldier goes offline for good.
Here&#x27;s the full End of Service announcement via Twitter:
The First Soldier was revealed in February 2021 alongside another mobile FFVII RPG, Ever Crisis (which has yet to release but has a closed beta planned for this year). The third-person battle royale took place before the events of FFVII and pit 75 players against each other as SOLDIER candidates. In addition to using firearms, players wield magic and even summons. Square previously stated The First Soldier was an attempt to attract a wider fanbase to the FFVII universe while giving existing fans a new way to enjoy its mythos. 
Unfortunately, this isn&#x27;t the first Square Enix published multiplayer game to get the axe this year. Babylon&#x27;s Fall, Platinum Games&#x27; live-service action RPG, is also being shutdown in February, less than a year after its ill-received launch. 
While The First Soldier is going away, plenty of FFVII content is in the pipeline. As previously mentioned, Ever Crisis remains on the docket, and Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII Reunion releases on December 13. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, the follow-up to Remake, is scheduled to launch next winter.</span>

                              <span>The Pokémon Company and Nintendo have released a new Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet trailer all about Iono, the electric-type gym leader of Levincia and the most popular streamer in the Paldean region. 
If you&#x27;re expecting a look at Pokémon Scarlet and Violet gameplay or the reveal of some new Pokémon or gameplay mechanics, temper your expectations because this video is all about Iono. Check out the gym leader Iono trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, there&#x27;s a lot going on in this new video. Iono is very much a Paldean influencer, which is a fun addition to the universe of Pokémon, but she&#x27;s also a gym leader that we&#x27;ll be facing off against in the game. As for her type, it&#x27;s Electric, and while not confirmed, it seems the video is hinting toward a gym challenge for her. Before actually battling her, we might have to successfully complete her &quot;who&#x27;s that Pokémon?&quot; test.
In this instance, she describes her very own Pokémon pal, but we don&#x27;t get the answer. Perhaps we&#x27;re meant to know what it is based on her description or maybe she&#x27;s describing a Pokémon we haven&#x27;t yet met. Only time will tell. Fortunately, we don&#x27;t have to wait too much longer to meet this &quot;Supercharged Streamer&quot; because Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet hit Switch on November 18. 
In the meantime, check out this 14-minute Pokémon Scarlet and Violet gameplay trailer from last week, and then watch this video all about Wiglett, a new Diglett-like Pokémon. Check out this trailer all about competitive play after that, and then read our Pokémon Scarlet and Violet preview for more details about Paldea, Terastallizing, and more. 
Do you have an idea of which Pokémon Iono is describing in today&#x27;s trailer? Let us know in the comments below!</span>

                              <span>Witchfire has been one of the most promising-looking shooters since its reveal in 2017. The dark fantasy romp was slated to launch in early access later this year, but a shift in design has forced developer The Astronauts to push that launch into next year.
The Astronauts has decided to rework Witchfire’s arena-style combat into an open-world format. Creative director Adrian Chmielarz writes in a blog post that the change makes Witchfire a “better” game. 
“The feature is now 95% implemented. It makes the game better. It is kind of hard for me to imagine the player did not have that freedom before. Sure, you can still be trapped by the witch in this or that spot, and some doors will be closed until you find a key, and it might be too dangerous to enter areas closer to the boss before you are ready– but the world is wide open for you to explore in almost any order, and you can both push forward and retreat as you please.”
Chmielarz also teases more Witchfire news to emerge in the next week or so. It won’t be gameplay footage but rather content promoting the game’s art and world in some fashion. 
Witchfire blends gunplay with the supernatural as players wield guns and magic to fend off otherworldly threats. The game is set in an alternate reality where you’re tasked with hunting down a witch at the behest of the church. The Astronauts previously developed The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, and the studio is made up of ex-People Can Fly employees. 
Witchfire is still slated to launch on PC via The Epic Game Store in early 2023. You can watch the most recent trailer from this year’s Summer Game Fest here.</span>

                              <span>New Blood Interactive have made a name with various flavours of retro first-person shooter, including Dusk, Amid Evil and Gloomwood. They&#x27;re branching out into nostalgic throwbacks for other genres, however. To mark the 25th anniversary of the orignal Fallout, CEO Dave Oshry showed new footage from their unnamed, unannounced CRPG.

It promises a swankier virtual reality experience over the Meta Quest 2, with higher resolution displays, a lighter headset, and new Quest Touch Pro controllers included. It&#x27;s also launching imminently, on October 25th, with pre-orders open now.

The downside: it&#x27;ll cost you £1500/$1500 versus the Quest 2&#x27;s £400, with Meta saying the headset is designed for business and not gaming.

                              <span>I picked up the Romancelvania demo at Steam Next Fest on Alice Bee&#x27;s recommendation, and she was quite correct when she described it as &quot;extremely relevant to [my] interests&quot;. So relevant, in fact, that I&#x27;m starting to wonder if this wasn&#x27;t an attempt at psychological sabotage disguised as a friendly gesture. (You wouldn&#x27;t do that to me, would you, Alice?)
Romancelvania is exactly what it sounds like: dating sim meets Castlevania. No idea how I missed it during my own perusal of the demo list, because unsurprisingly it&#x27;s immediately become my favourite thing I&#x27;ve ever played at a Steam Next Fest. I was so drawn in, in fact, that I&#x27;ve been having a tough time putting it down, even when I really need to — hence my suspicion that this was some sort of test on Alice&#x27;s part. No idea if I&#x27;ve succeeded or failed.
The demo starts on a promising note, awakening you in the persona of a comically brooding and exaggeratedly shirtless hunky Dracula. (The final game will include the option to play as a Lady Drac, if you prefer, who will not be shirtless, but not by a large margin.)

                              <span>I was underwhelmed by Prime Day’s lack of compelling desktop RAM deals, and Amazon’s follow-up – the Prime Early Access Sale – is also pretty quiet for good memory discounts. However, there are some intriguing offers on DDR5 RAM, which is perfect timing: AMD Ryzen 7000 CPUs have just launched, and unlike their Intel 13th Gen/Raptor Lake rivals, won’t be compatible with older DDR4 at all.

Apparently it was quite technically impressive for its time, as one of the very first 3D pool or snooker games. I wouldn&#x27;t have known anything about that as an eight-year-old playing games after school. Much like I knew absolutely nothing about how to play pool well. I mainly just liked the noise it made when a ball was potted. Whether it was my ball or my opponent&#x27;s ball: that was just extraneous detail.

                              <span>Not keen on the snazzy driving effects in recently announced racer Need For Speed Unbound? That’s okay, because devs Criterion Games have confirmed that you don’t have to play the game with great big puffs of colourful smoke dredging up from your car’s wheels, or cartoon wings popping out when you drive up a ramp and get some air. I’m into the effects myself, but it’s good to know you have the option to turn them off if you’re not.

That, and it’s currently a lot cheaper than usual in the Amazon Prime Early Access Sale, which runs until midnight tomorrow (October 12th).

                              <span>Coral Island  self-describes as a &quot;reimagining of farming games&quot;, but if we&#x27;re being real it doesn&#x27;t reimagine the Stardew Valley template totally differently. The titular island, and your overgrown plot of farmland on it, has almost the same layout as Stardew Valley, and the tasks you do - growing stuff, keeping animals, making friends with locals, exploring a mine five levels at a time, and appeasing local spirits by giving them bundles of different crops - will also be very familiar to any DewHeads (that&#x27;s what we call ourselves).
That&#x27;s not to say Coral Island isn&#x27;t good. It&#x27;s all in very beautiful bouncy 3D, for one thing, and I found the island setting (which impacts the flora, fauna, and architecture in general) made everything feel less like work. Combined with a thread of environmentalism weaving through the game, and the fact that Coral Island is slightly easier than Stardew Valley, and you feel like you&#x27;re doing more progress in less time. If you loved the vibe of ConcernedApe&#x27;s smash hit, but found the need to hand-write your own almanac a bit intimidating, this is the game for you.

Game director Kento Kinoshita told Polygon that although playable Lady D is still taller than any other character in Mercenaries, she’s been shortened to “a little under nine feet tall” from her canon height of around nine feet six inches. Kinoshita also went into some detail about Additional Orders’ other characters, including punch-maestro Chris Redfield.

Boo, but also, the 400GB model is now on sale, so I&#x27;ve replaced the former with this mid-sized card in the lists below. I&#x27;ve also updated the 256GB SanDisk Ultra&#x27;s price, as it&#x27;s dropped slightly further. The otherwise original version of the article is as follows...

In case you missed the mega-guide that went up earlier, today marks the start of Amazon’s Prime Early Access Sale: a two-day buffet of discounts that’s exclusive to Prime members. That includes loads on PC gaming hardware, though my eyes were most immediately caught by something not very desktop-grade at all. The SanDisk Ultra, one of the best microSD cards for the Steam Deck, is on sale across a choice of capacities – with the 1TB model getting especially juicy &gt;50% savings in both the UK and US.

It&#x27;s a competitive PVE game where teams of heroes fight it out to finish a dungeon run the fastest. And having seen a brief presentation of it behind closed doors, it looks like a good time - albeit one taking heavy inspiration from its main competitors.

                              <span>A DDoS attack on Blizzard caused issues for Overwatch 2 players earlier today, following on from similar attacks on the company during the free to play shooter’s launch last week. The latest attack came just after Overwatch 2 had finished a period of emergency maintenance. Although Blizzard have confirmed the DDoS attack has now ended, the recurring attacks aren’t exactly a good sign for a game already beset by technical issues.

He’s finally spilled the tea, confirming players’ suspicions that the two Arkane series beginning with a D and featuring magical abilities are linked.

                              <span>Dumb it down for me
One of the most significant and recognizable changes in my gaming habits over the past 30 years has been my slow retreat from the fighting game genre. Mind you, I was never really into the FGC, having participated in one entire tournament in my life when I was very young. But like many of those who came of age during the original console wars, Street Fighter II and its various iterations integrated itself into my life, my leisure time, and my many playground conversations with friends. We shared strategies, talked up our favorite characters (Cammy here), and convinced each other that the lies of secret characters we heard from the older kids were totally true but we just weren’t skilled enough to access them.

I’ve been to Hooters at some point during my teen years. I can tell you that all the hormones in the world would not take away from how awkward I felt. I’d say it was mutual shame, like getting your genitals waxed, but I don’t know who would take that job not feeling comfortable with the implications. So, the shame was all me. It’s like going to a strip club; I understand the purpose, but I’m still afraid to make eye contact. At the very least, I respect a place that moves ogling out of parks and beaches and into a consensual environment, but I have damage in the ogling center of my brain.
Believe it or not, Hooters actually had a video game. Sort of like how McDonald’s had McDonald’s Treasure Land Adventure, except instead of mascots, there are tits. …</span>

                              <span>More story content is also on the way for Saints Row
The team at Volition is laying out the future of updates for Saints Row. As the reboot passes a significant milestone, the developer is also talking about its plans for fine-tuning the game post-launch.
In a new blog, Volition and publisher Deep Silver confirm the 2022 Saints Row has seen 1 million players boot it up. That&#x27;s a lot of players, but Saints Row has also been dealing with a number of bugs, too.
The studio says it is prioritizing delivering improvements over new features. Part of that is the major update planned for late November, the first one Saints Row is receiving since its launch in August.
The update will see &#x27;over 200&#x27; bug fixes and stability upgrades. There will be a focus on challenges, overall stability.
&quot;We’re especially aware of issues some players have been having with co-op and we’re sorry these fixes have taken longer than expected while we apply and test them thoroughly,&quot; said Volition in the update.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;YgjzDJA1o1E
What&#x27;s in store the reboot
Quality-of-life improvements are also in store for the autumn update. A few specified changes include reducing repetition in some activities, improving management of vehicles, and making challenges more rewarding.
Though newer content is &quot;less of a priority&quot; for the Saints Row team now, the crew is still planning for the future. Volition and Deep Silver say they plan to support Saints Row for the long-term.
Saints Row is due to receive all-new story content in 2023, included in the Expansion Pass or purchasable as a separate piece. Free ne gameplay experiences and city areas are also in development. Cosmetic DLC is also expected to arrive this week for all Saints Row owners, with more on the way this year. Expansion Pass owners will get a few additional cosmetic packs, too.

                              <span>You can take screenshots in the Switch Online menu now
Nintendo has released a Switch 15.0.0 firmware update, and although it&#x27;s mostly stability related, like some updates in the past, a few small things have changed.
The most obvious alteration is the following: &quot;Screenshots can be taken using the Capture Button while in the Nintendo Switch Online application found on the Nintendo Switch HOME Menu.&quot; In short, this will now allow users to screencap the Switch Online menus: where you can view various My Nintendo challenges, bits of news, special offers, and expansion pack info.
One of the main bonuses of this change is the ability to easily take photos of the cycling array of Switch profile icons, which currently include Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Animal Crossing. At the moment you cannot take screenshots of several other menus in the Nintendo Switch OS, including the eShop.
The other even smaller change involves moving the Bluetooth audio menu (where you can connect various accessories, including headphones). It&#x27;s not very exciting for a firmware update, right?! Well, that&#x27;s par for the course.
Switch 15.0.0 firmware patch notes (Released October 10, 2022):
The location of the Bluetooth Audio menu within System Settings has moved.
Screenshots can be taken using the Capture Button while in the Nintendo Switch Online application
General system stability improvements to enhance the user&#x27;s experience

                              <span>But you should probably go to bed
Atlus&#x27; celebrated JRPG Persona 5 Royal is getting set to head to tabletops everywhere, in the form of a brand new card game adaptation that is currently in the works at Pandasauras Games. Designed by veteran designer Emerson Matsuuchi, the new game hopes to capture the surreal adventure and excitement of the 2019 smash hit.
Details are slim-to-none on the rules and setup of the Persona 5 Royal card game but, according to Matsuuchi, games will see players will team up as members of The Phantom Thieves before embarking upon quests to steal hearts, defeat demons, and redeem a rogues&#x27; gallery of bad dudes and dudettes. The world and characters of Persona 5 will all be putting in an appearance, from Joker, Lady Ann, and Morgana, to the Palaces, The Metaverse, and the luxurious but unnerving Velvet Room.

The Persona series has always been a fine fit for tabletop adaptation, what with its compendium of monsters and demons, multiple protagonists and antagonists, dungeon-crawling nature, and, of course, its sexy and immediately recognizable visual style. The franchise has seen a number of official and unofficial adaptations already, in the form of the Japanese card game Persona VS, and the very cool Unofficial Persona 5 Phan-Game.
Persona 5 Royal will launch in the fall of 2023. In related news, Atlus announced this weekend that series classics Persona 3 Portable and Persona 4 Golden will finally launch on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms in January 2023. You can read more about these releases right here.

                              <span>Get another glimpse of the Paldea region
The next Pokemon generation is just around the corner, and there&#x27;s still some more info to share on what&#x27;s in store. The Pokemon Company confirms that more info on Pokemon Scarlet and Violet will air on its YouTube channel this week.
A new drop will happen on October 12, tomorrow, at 6 a.m. PT. The video will go live on the official Pokemon YouTube channel then.

There isn&#x27;t any indication about how long this particular video will be, or what content it will cover.
Exploring Scarlet and Violet&#x27;s new region
We&#x27;ve had a number of these info drops pop up over the last few weeks. On October 6, a new trailer dove into the world of Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, showing some battle footage and the Terrastallize mechanic in practice.
The auto-battle function that&#x27;s been teased was also shown off. This option lets Pokemon run off and fight their own battles, separate from the trainer. It can be used to pick up items too, and it seems like one of this generation&#x27;s three main story pillars will involve storming a Team Star hideout alongside your Pokemon.
A quiet surprise was the TM Machine, which will let players create TMs using items dropped by Pokemon. This could be a big one for endgame Pokemon raising and training, as well as helping players adapt to the gyms.

Alongside news like that, we&#x27;ve also seen info about some of the new Pokemon and regional variants. New faces like Wigglett and Lechonk are already stealing hearts, or terrifying them in the former&#x27;s case.
All this, alongside legendary mounts that can help you can get around Paldea, sure makes Pokemon Scarlet and Violet look like interesting entries in the mainline Pokemon series. We&#x27;ll see what more the Pokemon team has in store to show off tomorrow.

                              <span>It&#x27;s all Greek to me
The studio formerly known as Square Enix Montreal has now rebranded as &quot;Onoma&quot; — The name change comes following the outfit&#x27;s acquisition by Swedish holding company Embracer Group.
In a statement on the studio&#x27;s sparkling fresh website, Onoma reveals that it went through over 160 name suggestions before settling on the new name, which is Greek for &quot;name&quot; and was chosen due to its easy pronunciation in almost any language — most notably French and English, the native languages of the French-Canadian studio.
&quot;Our strength has always been our ability to evolve and adapt to trends and market changes,&quot; reads the statement. &quot;Our rebrand as Studio Onoma is one more transformation that we are excited to take on. Our new brand identity will serve as an umbrella to multiple products, programs, and initiatives, each with distinct personalities.&quot;
Onoma was acquired from Square Enix by Embracer Group back in May of this year, in a smart and lucrative deal that also included proven developers Eidos Montreal and Crystal Dynamics, as well as a catalog of well-known and successful IPs including Legacy of Kain, Thief, Deus Ex, and, most notably, Tomb Raider. The $300 million (USD) acquisition was finally completed in August.
&quot;Our name and look might have changed,&quot; concludes the developer&#x27;s statement, &quot;but we are still us: a studio that empowers creativity and innovation and always puts people before products. (Just in a new and improved version!)&quot;

Although the quality of the Fallout series has waxed and waned over the years, the name still means something. The original series was a trailblazer in the genre, and there&#x27;s still a lot of goodwill left from modern adaptations like Fallout: New Vegas. To remind people of how important this series is, Bethesda is running a new Fallout retrospective series, which you can watch for free on YouTube.
The first clip, &quot;conceiving Fallout,&quot; has a few familiar faces, including folks from Black Isle Studios. Original producer Tim Cain, executive producer Brian Fargo, and original artist/designer Leonard Boyarsky are present for this first episode, in addition to Feargus Urquhart (division director at Black Isle).

Sensational rap artist Megan Thee Stallion seems to be on a one-woman mission to twerk her way to pop culture infamy — Not content with getting all the knuckle-draggers angry via her recent appearance on Marvel&#x27;s She-Hulk: Attorney at Law, the Texan lyric spitter is now cutting a rug with, of all the people, Halo&#x27;s legendary spartan warrior, Master Chief.
The bizarre but energizing confrontation took place at TwitchCon this past weekend, where Ms. Thee Stallion was performing an on-stage set for a rabid crowd of fans and attendees. It was a typical flashy and energetic appearance from the artist, but things took a turn for both the bizarre and the fantastic when Megan was joined by the Halo protagonist, who promptly bust out some fuckin&#x27; moves in full Spartan arm…</span>

                              <span>At least we&#x27;re getting a compilation next year
While any given year for Mega Man can be a dire situation, there&#x27;s at least something on the horizon for the 35th anniversary: the Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection in 2023. Of course, the Mega Man 35th anniversary celebration is mostly centered around merch for now.
As reported by Rockman Corner, the &quot;first collaboration&quot; for the 35th anniversary of the Blue Bomber is...an expensive t-shirt line. In a partnership with Japanese company Avirex, Capcom is putting out Mega Man t-shirts, which will run you about 45 USD (as Rockman Corner points out, there&#x27;s international shipping).
The main bit of news here (because there is always an endless supply of Mega Man merch) is the logo reveal, which came by way of the Avirex store. It&#x27;s a stark contrast to the other logos (gathered by Rockman Corner), dating all the way back to the old school 10th anniversary. For four straight anniversaries (10th, 15th, 20th, 25th) we have a clear view of Mega Man&#x27;s face (in various incarnations). Then for the 30th anniversary, Capcom opted for a cool minimalist design that lined up with the release of the Mega Man 30th Anniversary Bundle.
But the 35th logo is simply text, an off-putting giant &quot;35th&quot; numerical value, and a Capcom copyright. Mega Man fans know better than to expect anything from any given anniversary, but hopefully there&#x27;s something in the cards for this milestone.

                              <span>But don&#x27;t you be playing no emulators, ya hear?
Valve has announced that its powerful and alluring handheld console, Steam Deck, is now &quot;readily available&quot; for purchase — The portable PC had previously been a pre-order-only product, but the publisher now believes that it is comfortably in place to receive and deliver upon all customer orders.
Originally announced back in July 21, with pre-orders opening not long thereafter, Valve has been steadily manufacturing and delivering Steam Deck hardware to its customers in batches — impacted production delays and component shortages brought about by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Valve, true to its word, was able to rapidly increase its output since spring of this year, and has seen to delivering upon all of the initial pre-orders. Manufacturing woes have continued to stifle hardware production for all major industries over the past three years.

Despite the Steam Deck&#x27;s relative availability, Valve has warned that production on the expensive piece of tech may slow once again should the company be inundated with orders. It seems that, for the most part, anybody who has been waiting on the opportunity to bag themselves a handheld PC can now do so over on the official website. In addition, the company is now taking pre-orders in Asian territories including Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and South Korea.
In other related news, a weekend hotfix saw the Steam Deck handle Capcom&#x27;s Street Fighter 6 beta with what appears to be relative ease, Valve also took down several online videos over the weekend that showed the console running naughty emulators. Now Homer, Don&#x27;t You Eat This Pie.

                              <span>Fan Fest was a blast, I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s back
In-person Final Fantasy XIV Fan Festivals were on hold, but Square Enix has triumphantly announced that they&#x27;re back on as of 2023.
By way of a new YouTube video, the publisher is ready to bring back the convention series to in-person events, starting with a kickoff in Las Vegas, Nevada (a prior Fan Fest site in the US) in July of 2023. Several months later the team will move to London in October of that same year, followed by a concluding Fan Fest in &quot;early 2024&quot; in Japan.
For those of you who aren&#x27;t aware of Fan Fest, it&#x27;s a two-day celebration of Final Fantasy XIV, complete with merch to buy, hands-on events and challenges (some of which are unique to the convention), meet and greets, and even full-on concerts and performances. Typically, we also get content teases and reveals, including new jobs and features of upcoming updates and whatever future expansion is in store at the time.
If you&#x27;re remotely a fan of Final Fantasy XIV, I highly recommend attending. Given the cooperative nature of the game itself, and the positive reputation of the fanbase, it&#x27;s a great way to meet people or just enjoy the game on your own.
You can find the full landing page for Fan Fest here.
Final Fantasy XIV Fan Festival 2023-2024 dates:
Las Vegas, Nevada: July 28-29, 2023 (Las Vegas Convention Center)
London, UK: October 21-22, 2023 (ExCeL London)
Japan: Early 2024 (no venue selected yet)

As if the chaotic, madcap world of MultiVersus wasn&#x27;t already total mania, things are getting set to go completely off the deep end this week, with the arrival of the malevolent, dangerous, and utterly unpredictable Stripe, the chief antagonist of Joe Dante&#x27;s 1984 horror-comedy, Gremlins.
As the alpha male of cutie-pie Gizmo&#x27;s villainous brethren, Stripe quickly establishes his dominance as the self-styled &quot;leader&quot; of the mischievous/homicidal batch of Mogwai — rendered vile due to the breaking of the golden &quot;Never feed them after midnight&quot; rule. Following a terrifying rampage across the sleepy town of Kingston Falls, Stripe&#x27;s arrogance finally oversteps his cunning, and he eventually finds himself bursting into an explosion of goo, hit with the harmful rays of the dawn&#x27;s…</span>

                              <span>The &quot;winter&quot; window has been narrowed down
Several months ago, Nintendo teased a trio of Splatoon 3 amiibo (Octoling Blue, Inkling Yellow, and Smallfry) arriving &quot;this holiday.&quot; Well thanks to a new YouTube video, the release date has been narrowed down to November 11.
Roughly the first minute of the video is a recap of everything we covered here: including basic amiibo functionality. But in the remaining 20 seconds or so there&#x27;s a release date announcement, plus a brief look at what costumes the upcoming amiibo will grant players. Reprints of several old Splatoon amiibo (including Pearl and Marina) are coming around the same time, so keep an eye out for those as well.
Keep in mind that as of late, amiibo haven&#x27;t been as super rare as they have been in the past. While old school amiibo hunters are always ready for an instant-sell-out situation, stock has generally been plentiful: so hopefully that will be the case for these figures too.
Once these three are released in November, we&#x27;ll have the following announced amiibo remaining:
Super Smash Bros. Ultimate Wave 11 (2022-2023):
Sephiroth
Pyra/Mythra
Kazuya
Sora (still needs full confirmation)
As always, you can check out when those were released here in our master amiibo list, which has been updated since 2014.

                              <span>In the early &#x27;90s, the fighting game genre was a far cry from what it is today. Inspired by series like Final Fight, Kung-Fu Master, and Karate Champ, the fighting genre emerged in arcades, buoyed by a few significant players in the space. One of those franchises was Mortal Kombat, a bloody, gory fighting game that took concepts from other fighting games and dialed them to 11. The series became notorious for its spine-ripping, heart-grabbing, limb-chopping action, but beneath the controversies and the hearings was a technically sound, capable fighting game. 
The Mortal Kombat franchise has continued to grow and evolve, showcasing massive staying power in a sometimes ruthless industry. Now, 30 years into the series&#x27; existence, Mortal Kombat has proven it&#x27;s here to stay as one of the preemin…</span>

                              <span>Viola, a newcomer to the series and Bayonetta 3’s second playable protagonist, is a figure shrouded in intrigue. This punk rock-inspired warrior hails from another universe and is an Umbra Witch in training. She doesn’t have the same handle on her abilities as Bayonetta (nor her confident elegance), so Viola sports a vastly different playstyle that reflects her inexperience. 


Instead of being adept at using a variety of weapons like Bayonetta, Viola only uses her katana and throwing darts. She also summons her demonic companion Cheshire for backup. What she lacks in finesse, though, she makes up for with raw power.
Playing as Viola, her style feels noticeably more deliberate. She’s still quick, but her sword attacks feel more measured and, most of all, impactful. This approach tells me t…</span>

The game introduces several big additions, quite literally in some cases, to the game’s already winning formula, and you can check them out in this exclusive gameplay video. 
Before we jump on what’s new, the core of Bayonetta 3’s combat remains the same, so veterans will find it easy to slip back into the fun dance of chaining combos, peppering foes with gunfire, unleashing torture attacks, and split-second dodging to trigger the time-slowing Witch Time effect. However, one of Bayonetta’s new tricks is Demon Masquerade. Weapons are now imbued with the power of Bayonetta’s many Infernal Demons.

According to Sega’s Japanese website, the bundle features the Rioreus equipment to outfit Sonic. You’ll also get a grilled meat set, which not only lets you cook up tasty meat but also play mini-games to raise Sonic’s strength. It&#x27;s a small bundle but a neat way to return the favor after Capcom introduced Sonic-themed content in Monster Hunter Rise last year. Check out Sonic in his armored glory in the photo gallery below.

The Monster Hunter pack will be available to download on November 14, almost a week after Frontiers launches on November 8. For more Sonic Frontiers, check out the latest trailer featuring the reveal of Super Sonic.</span>

Everybody up for yet another Soulslike? Yeah, we thought as much. However, Black Mermaid&#x27;s Moonscars has been turning heads since it was first announced due to its rather exquisitely detailed pixel art style. This is a deliciously dark 2D slasher with Metroidvania elements that reminds us a little of Motion Twin&#x27;s dazzling Dead Cells, albeit with much starker environments housing its meticulously animated combat. But how does all of this lovely-looking murder actually play?
Well, it&#x27;s a bit of a banger all things told, an attractive marriage of excellent presentation and punchy combat. However, there are some pretty persistent frame rate issues present in this Switch port that have put the brakes on us scoring it exactly as we&#x27;d have liked to. Let&#x27;s keep our collective fingers crossed that Black Mermaid can get this stuff patched up ASAP because, if these problems can be ironed out, you&#x27;re looking at a super slick and stylish action game that looks fantastic and has some very clever gameplay wrinkles tucked up its blood-soaked sleeves.

                              <span>Over at Walmart in the US, you can pick up a set of Klipsch ProMedia 2.1 Bluetooth PC speakers for $59, rather than the $95 they normally cost. This is a better deal than I expected to find for this model, which offer a small but powerful 100W subwoofer and two speakers with &#x27;exclusive horn-loaded tweeter technology&#x27;. No, I don&#x27;t know what that means either.

This was back when cereal had that Happy Meal generosity, and you&#x27;d look forward to that thump as a gift caked in dust landed in your bowl. You won&#x27;t find any game demos in those wheat crunchie crumbs anymore.
Definitely not one on the level of Action Man: Raid On Island X at least. It was the absolute business.

Well, now Activision Blizzard are planning to insist people sign up for two-factor authentication to play the upcoming Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, too. They’re also warning that players with pre-paid plans might not be able to get the process to work.

I was lucky enough to go hands-on with an early build of the Wild Hearts&#x27;s opening hours to see how it stacks up against its age-old competitor, and whether it has any chance of melting down Monster Hunter&#x27;s trophy cabinet and forging itself a golden crown.

                              <span>Owners of Valve’s handheld PC Steam Deck have been fiddling about with creating and sharing their own ten-second animations for the machine’s new custom boot video feature, implemented in a client update last week. Some pay homage to Valve and Steam, while others nod towards games in general, or even classic telly and film. I’ve had a rummage around to help give you some ideas, and found the batch below.

Although there’s nothing more than that, and Nightdive haven’t announced anything themselves, it’s a step forward for the game.

You&#x27;ll need to log in to your GI account and click &quot;okay to print&quot; for your letter or question to go through. We&#x27;d also love it if you included your location (city, state, or country will do). We&#x27;ll look through the questions and pick a few to include in our next issue, which releases on November 8.
For each issue, we ask our community a question for our SoundOff section. This time around, we want to know...
&quot;Which video game franchise has the best soundtrack?&quot;
You can answer this question and/or include any other feedback you want. Thank you again for your support throughout the years, and we hope many of you get the chance to have your letter printed in an upcoming issue!

                              <span>It looks like Crash Bandicoot 4: It’s About Time is heading to Steam, with Activision Blizzard announcing the news in an unorthodox fashion. The publisher also appears to be teasing the reveal of a new Crash game 
The publisher sent a special Crash-themed pizza box (from &quot;Aku Aku&#x27;s Steam-In Pizza Shack&quot;) to influencers, such as YouTuber Candian Guy Eh. His unboxing video shows that the box is taped with a not-so-subtle message that Crash 4 heads to Steam on October 18. The game, which launched in 2020, is currently playable on PC only through Battle.net. 
Additionally, the box was also taped with a message that read, “Hungry for more? Try our new Wumpa Pizza for $12.08!” Given that The Game Awards is set to air on December 8, it appears highly likely we’ll find out the nature of this title (rumored to be a party game called Wumpa League) during the annual show.
Are you excited to play Crash Bandicoot 4: It&#x27;s About Time on Steam? What do you think the rumored new game will be? Let us know in the comments!</span>

                              <span>With Persona 5 Royale set to launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox, and Switch on October 21, Atlus has announced the multiplatforms release dates for Persona 3 Portable and Persona 4 Golden. Thankfully, fans only have to wait a few months before all three acclaimed RPG’s become available on modern platforms. 
On January 19, Persona 3 Portable arrives on PlayStation 4, Xbox consoles, Switch, and PC via Steam. That same day, Persona 4 Golden will hit PlayStation 4, Xbox platforms (including Windows), and Switch. Both titles will also be available on Xbox Game Pass at launch.
Persona 3 Portable is the enhanced PSP port of 2007’s Persona 3 (which originally released on PlayStation 2). It launched in 2010 and has never been ported beyond Sony’s handheld. Similarly, Persona 4 Golden is a PS Vita title and the definitive version of its entry, Persona 4. Golden launched in 2012 and has only migrated to Steam, but that didn’t happen until 2020.

                              <span>It&#x27;s easy to take backwards compatibility for granted on PC, so much so that we rarely even use the phrase &quot;backwards compatibility&quot;. Most old games will simply run, and for everything else there&#x27;s usually a compatibility mode built into Windows or DOSBox to get it going.

This didn&#x27;t happen by accident, as an old blog post by a former Microsoft programmer explains. When Microsoft wanted users to switch to Windows 95, for example, they went so far as to add specific code that looked for SimCity and, if it was running, changed how memory allocation worked so that the game wouldn&#x27;t crash.

                              <span>Graphics cards are getting bigger, hotter and more expensive - and that first one is more of a problem than you might think. With the RTX 4090 and a whole family of oversized GPUs on the way, those tiny PCIe slots on your motherboard are taking on an incredible amount of weight, such that even mid-range cards can sag and bend over time. 
The best way to prevent this is with a brace, which pushes up from the bottom of your case to the far end of the graphics card, holding it level and preventing all that force from affecting the card or the PCIe slot. You sometimes get a support brace like this free with your graphics card, but otherwise you can pick one up fairly inexpensively from a range of manufacturers.

This GP66 Leopard is one of the fastest gaming laptops on the market, with a Core i7 processor, 16GB of RAM, 1TB NVMe SSD and a 144Hz screen - not to mention that flagship-grade graphics card. 
It normally retails for a cool £1998, but today Laptops Direct has discounted it to £1399.97, making it the cheapest RTX 3080 laptop we can find right now.

Some choose to get out while they can to avoid a full-blown lawsuit, but others only see a potentially lucrative gap in the market. Rolling the dice can pay off but it can also go terribly wrong, as a PrimeStreams reseller has just discovered.

The group shut down the popular movie streaming site Ymovies.to through a suspect in Columbia. Around the same time, a Brazil-based pirate video CDN was pulled offline, blacking out dozens of other sites in the process.

                              <span>Bungie has responded to the &quot;hacking&quot; claim submitted to the court last month by cheat developer AimJunkies. According to the game developer, these allegations are patently false and not properly pleaded either. Bungie asks the court to dismiss all counterclaims, arguing that the cheaters throw around untrue claims to see if they stick.

                              <span>To celebrate our Bayonetta 3 cover story, we&#x27;re bringing back good old-fashioned Replay to revisit its direct predecessor, Bayonetta 2. You can tune in on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central to join in on the fun, or catch the archive when it hits on our Game Informer Shows YouTube channel. 
Released in October 2014 as a Wii U exclusive, Bayonetta 2 is a sequel that almost didn&#x27;t happen. Despite a strong critical reception to the first game, sales didn&#x27;t meet expectations, leading to publisher Sega passing on a follow-up. Thankfully, Nintendo swooped in to fund and publish Bayonetta 2, locking it in as a third-party exclusive. Bayonetta 2 features improved combat, new features, an even nuttier plot, and a near-bottomless well of action. Join me, Marcus Stewart, as I dig into my personal GOTY for 2014 and chat all about our Bayonetta 3 cover.

                              <span>Mortal Kombat was released three decades ago, in October of 1992, and its gory style of fighting has persisted through the years, through controversies, movies, and more. 
The NetherRealm-developed series celebrates its 30th anniversary this month, and the studio has released a new trailer to highlight the legacy of the franchise and bathe players in nostalgia and hype. If you&#x27;re looking for a special Mortal Kombat announcement, though, keep your expectations in check. Maybe something like that comes at a later date this month – who knows? – but today&#x27;s trailer is all about Mortal Kombat&#x27;s 30-year history in video games and other entertainment mediums. 
Check out the Mortal Kombat 30th Anniversary trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, the video above doesn&#x27;t announce any new movies or games, or even DLC for Mortal Kombat 11, but that&#x27;s okay because it&#x27;s still a great watch nonetheless, especially for longtime fans. 
Here are some fun Mortal Kombat 30th Anniversary logos as well:

                              <span>More than six years after its original release, No Man&#x27;s Sky is finally out on Switch today alongside the new Waypoint update, which brings the game up to a new 4.0 version. This update is live on PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Switch, and PC as of today. 
As for what to expect, Waypoint is best described as a major overhaul to No Man&#x27;s Sky geared toward making the game easily tailored to players, regardless of the experience they&#x27;re trying to get out of it. If you want something more relaxing and casual, you can do that. If you want a more challenging experience, the Waypoint update lets you do that too. 
&quot;Access the universe of No Man&#x27;s Sky from anywhere in update 4.0 Waypoint, launching for the first time on Nintendo Switch, and overhauling fundamental elements of gameplay including game modes, inventory size, and usability, milestones, journey cataloging, and much more,&quot; the No Man&#x27;s Sky Waypoint blog post reads. &quot;Tailor every aspect of the game to your unique playstyle with custom game modes. Launch into the action quickly with an existing difficulty preset, or tinker with everything from economy to combat challenge to survival difficulty to perfect your experience.&quot; 
Alongside today&#x27;s Switch release and Waypoint update, Hello Games has released a new trailer giving a tease of what to expect in the 4.0 version of the game: 


As you can see, Waypoint is bringing a lot of changes to No Man&#x27;s Sky. Alongside game mode customization, there are also new seamless auto-saves, the launch of trade rockets, a new inventory overhaul with streamlined item management, unique Switch rewards, and so much more. Be sure to read the entire Waypoint blog post for all the details.

                              <span>Nintendo has revealed what the next Splatoon 3 Splatfest will have players battling over and it begins next month. 
More specifically, it begins November 11 at 4 p.m. PT/7 p.m. ET. This is perfect timing because it&#x27;s a three-way battle between Grass-type Pokémon, Fire-type Pokémon, and Water-type Pokémon, the types of the three starters we&#x27;ll be choosing from in Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet on November 18. Check out the announcement tweet for yourself below: 
Grass-type. Fire-type. Water-type. This debate has perplexed our great philosophers for ages. Let’s settle it.
#Splatfest collaboration begins 11/11 at 4pm PT!

The event will begin on November 11 and it will run through 4 p.m. PT/7 p.m. ET on November 13. While nothing is confirmed just yet, the image released alongside today&#x27;s news seems to tease some Pokémon-inspired gear. Hopefully, we all get to show off our favorite of the three types in our gear and weapons of choice. It&#x27;s also worth noting that Nintendo calls this Splatfast a &quot;special...collaboration&quot; so there might be even more  Pokémon integration than we expect. Only time will tell. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer&#x27;s Splatoon 3 review and then watch this 14-minute Pokémon Scarlet and Violet trailer released yesterday.

                              <span>The new guards of Batman&#x27;s city rise up in the launch trailer for Gotham Knights released by WB Games Montréal today. 
With just two weeks to go until the October 21 release date, marketing for Gotham Knights has begun to ramp up. We recently went hands-on with the game, and you can read our impressions and key takeaways about how it plays now, and recent videos have shared some of the behind-the-scenes inspirations for the game&#x27;s narrative design. But now, as the official release date draws nearer, WB Games Montréal is bringing the hype. 
Check out the Gotham Knights launch trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Gotham Knights&#x27; story of the Court of Owls and how they interact with both the Gotham Knights – Batgirl, Nightwing, Robin, and Red Hood – as well as other Gotham villain mainstays like Penguin, Mr. Freeze, Clayface, and Harley Quinn is shaping up to be something exciting for the Bat-verse of games. Fortunately, we don&#x27;t have to wait too much longer now to experience it for ourselves because Gotham Knights hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on October 21.

This news comes after weeks of Kojima teasing a face with the words, &quot;Who Am I?&quot; in bold white letters. The face was obscured due to some neat shadow tricks, but right from the jump, fans tried determining whose face it might be, and it didn&#x27;t take long for Fanning to become the frontrunner. Continual teasing led us to yesterday, when Kojima finally released the images below, confirming Fanning as the face in question.

                              <span>I keep forgetting Valkyrie Elysium&#x27;s PC release date is later than its console one. The action platformer came out on PlayStation late last week, but it&#x27;s not coming to Steam until November 11th. So far, reviews have been quite middling, which isn&#x27;t wholly surprising in some sense, but having played the public demo the other week, I&#x27;m not ashamed to say that I had a pretty all right time with it! Based on two hours of play time, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s very much in the same kind of vein as your Bayonettas and Nier: Automatas, and I&#x27;m 100% down for that.

                              <span>It feels odd saying &quot;Overwatch 1&quot;, but Overwatch 1 occupies an important place in my personal and professional life. And all things considered, I do not miss it in the slightest. I spent so much time straining against the game&#x27;s tug-of-war matches that I simply grew tired of trying really hard at it - or perhaps more accurately, trying not to launch my head through the nearest plaster wall.
Clearly, there was a time where I adored Overwatch, though. A time when I&#x27;d grind solo-queue most evenings until 3am, in a bid to climb the ranks ever higher. To what end? My own personal satisfaction, I suppose. I&#x27;d eventually hit Master (let me brag just once, okay) and then a few months later, I applied for a job at Gamer Network writing guides about Overwatch&#x27;s intricacies. I moved to Brighton for my first proper job. Now, with Overwatch 2&#x27;s release, it all feels like it&#x27;s come full circle.

                              <span>Archtower is a roguelike and therefore bad, but... hnnnnnnngggh I like it. I might even come to love it, considering it&#x27;s already so enjoyable even with a few years of early access left (a fact I forgot until I reached a &quot;work in progress&quot; marker several hours in).
You climb a tower and splat monsters and culty magic nerds. You loot, and avoid traps, chug red liquids, and occasionally die and have to start again. But I enjoyed every moment, and never once hit the usual aggravating points that push me out of the genre. It&#x27;s good stuff all round, frankly.

                              <span>A new experience: Weird RPG is the first video game to make my lips numb. My character in the action-RPG is wearing magic tousers, see, which launch explosive basketball hoops every time I make noise into my microphone. Turns out, the most DPS-efficient noise is continually blowing to trill my lips like a child pretending to be a car. Weird RPG does have some fun ideas but sadly, it&#x27;s too mundane an ARPG to be truly weird—or good. Still, I was delighted when I found a helmet whose stats get better the worse your graphics card is.

                              <span>Scrolling through Twitter, Daniel Griffiths&#x27; interest was piqued when he saw a post describing a mysterious phenomenon being shared in the Nier: Automata community: A2 opening a hidden door in The Copied City and strolling into a secret, never-before-seen area. Curious, he decided to pursue more knowledge, and landed in the Nier modding Discord server. 


Like him, many other Nier: Automata players who caught wind of the phenomenon sat upright - metaphorically and perhaps literally - and flocked to both Reddit and Discord to check out what exactly was up with the secret area. It was dubbed the &quot;church mystery&quot; or &quot;sadfutago&#x27;s posts&quot;, among other monikers.

That’s why Tyler Hallada put together Modmapper, a free tool released earlier this year that shows which of the mods hosted at NexusMods affect which areas of Skyrim. Now, Hallada’s written about the experience of creating the tool in a blog post, and the reasons for taking on the project.

It was only a five-minute long clip at the time, but I&#x27;ve now played an expanded version of that particular scene, and yep, I still don&#x27;t much like the look of that there laser bot.

Key to this are custom game modes, auto-saves, dynamic difficulty, and inventory streamlining. There’s also a new relaxed mode for the particularly chilled among us. Watch the update trailer below for a rundown, and some trippy space visuals.

                              <span>Electronic Arts have formally launched their new store client doodad after a long open beta, replacing the much-maligned Origin with something they refer to as &quot;the EA app&quot; (its actual name is only &quot;EA&quot;). They say it&#x27;s faster and better. I think maybe it is? But it doesn&#x27;t really matter, as long as it&#x27;s not a disaster, because it&#x27;s not like you&#x27;re using it unless you have to anyway.

                              <span>A piece of interactive fiction that was created for a 16-bit minicomputer in the early 1980s has finally been completed, four decades later. Ferret, a Zork-like text adventure, began development in 1982 for the Data General Nova 2. The game was put together by a group of software engineers from Data General’s UK-based Systems Division. Ferret only received a final functional release complete with an endgame in August this year, according to a post on the game’s Facebook community.

People who scanned a QR code on the standee image were directed to another picture on the Kojima Productions site, which shows Fanning’s face in red light and the message “Who am I?”.

                              <span>When Bayonetta 3&#x27;s first gameplay trailer hit last year, her new braided hairstyle caught the attention of fans for its resemblance to the look of Cereza, the little girl who tagged along with players in the first game. Spoiler for Bayonetta 1: Cereza is the child version of Bayonetta, so perhaps our hero simply wanted to return to her adolescent roots. However, the third game&#x27;s focus on the multiverse has prompted some fans to consider a more tantalizing theory. 
First, to provide some context, here&#x27;s a (relatively) quick refresher of Bayonetta&#x27;s backstory for newcomers or lapsed fans. Five hundred years prior to the events of the first game, Bayonetta, whose real name is Cereza, was born the child of an Umbra Witch and a Lumen Sage.

                              <span>Nintendo has released the first trailer for its upcoming Super Mario Bros. movie and it features plenty of the famed plumber as well as Toad, Luigi, Bowser, the Mushroom Kingdom, and more. It also features our first listen to Chris Pratt&#x27;s Mario.
Pratt teased back in June that his Mario voice is &quot;unlike anything you&#x27;ve heard in the Mario world,&quot; and it turns out he&#x27;s right in that we&#x27;ve never heard Pratt&#x27;s voice in the world of Mario, which is to say his Mario just sounds like him. Elsewhere in the trailer, which aired during a special Nintendo Direct all about the film today, we get a glimpse at the movie&#x27;s villain, Bowser, who is voiced by Jack Black, Toad, voiced by Keegan-Michael Key, and even a quick shot at Luigi at the end. 
Check out the Super Mario Bros. movie trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Super Mario Bros. looks like you&#x27;d expect, in line with Illumination&#x27;s other animated movies like Despicable Me and Minions. It looks like it will be a great time at the theater, making the wait until its silver screen release on April 7 that much harder.

                              <span>EA has officially revealed Need For Speed Unbound, the first new Need For Speed game in three years, and it hits new-gen consoles and PC this December. 
After leaking earlier this week, EA has released the official reveal trailer for Need For Speed and as leaks and rumors suggested, it&#x27;s quite a drastic shift in style for the series. It features the slick realistic visuals fans of the series know quite well but this time, it&#x27;s mixed with an almost anime-like animation style. It looks great, in my opinion, but it likely won&#x27;t be for everybody. 
Check out the Need For Speed Unbound reveal trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Unbound represents a pretty drastic departure for the series in terms of visuals but elsewhere, it looks like Need For Speed. There seems to be plenty of car customization, cops to run from, city streets to speed through, and if the reveal trailer&#x27;s song by A$AP Rocky is any indication, a great soundtrack.
Only time will tell but fortunately, we don&#x27;t have to wait too long because Need For Speed Unbound hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on December 2. As you might have noticed, the reveal trailer doesn&#x27;t mention consoles from the previous generation, like the PlayStation 4 or Xbox One, so you might need a current-gen machine to play the game.

Returning favorites from 2019&#x27;s Modern Warfare like Ghost and Price make an appearance in the trailer as do newcomers to the series, both good and bad, all to the backdrop of the war on drugs, cartels, terrorism, and more.

                              <span>Since the launch of Overwatch 2 earlier this week, the game has struggled in a number of ways. Some players are excited about the numbered sequel while others wonder why this wasn&#x27;t just a big update for the original Overwatch, which is no longer accessible. Regardless, actually playing Overwatch 2 has been its own challenge due to at least two DDoS attacks Blizzard has weathered, making it tough to actually queue into the game and access it beyond the eternal loading screen. 
On top of that, some players have found themselves unable to play once logged in due to the game&#x27;s SMS Protect system, which requires you to give Blizzard a &quot;unique&quot; phone number for authentication purposes.

                              <span>Up until now, buying a Steam Deck meant first purchasing a reservation, then waiting weeks or months until you came to the front of the queue before you could complete your purchase. No longer. Valve say that they&#x27;ve increased their manufacturing capacity such that you can now buy a Steam Deck without a reservation.

They&#x27;ve also made the Steam Deck&#x27;s dock available to purchase. It costs $80/£80 and has the same 1-2 week delivery estimate as the Deck itself.

                              <span>Core developers of Disco Elysium were allegedly &quot;fired on false premises&quot;, according to Martin Luiga. Luiga, who worked on the game in its early days, made the comment in a new interview in which he also says that he believes &quot;fans had a right to know&quot; about the developers&#x27; departure from the studio.

More interestingly, it also includes a new expansion that hasn&#x27;t even been announced yet.

                              <span>When the mysterious sci-fi action shooter Scars Above was first unveiled during Geoffcom&#x27;s Opening Night Live at the end of August, I thought it had big Returnal energy. Based on the reveal trailer, it certainly seemed to be riffing on several of the same themes as Housemarque&#x27;s challenging PlayStation exclusive - what with its lone female scientist stranded on an alien planet schtick, third-person shooting, and big eerie alien monsters after her etc. - so when I saw it was part of this month&#x27;s Steam Next Fest demo bonanza, I knew I had to give it a try. And while it certainly captures the same kind of atmosphere as Returnal, I&#x27;m sorry to say that&#x27;s about as far as the comparison goes, as the rest of Scars Above is a much slower, more traditional kind of space action game.

Pre-orderers can play the campaign a week early, technically, but that’s still a good couple of weeks away as well. By the way, could you help me out? I can’t remember the actor who’s playing the shouty general’s name and it’s really bothering me. He’s in the trailer below, watch it and let me know in the comments please.

                              <span>Let&#x27;s be clear about one thing: whatever else I say today doesn&#x27;t deny that building games are in a great state right now. Within just the last few years, we&#x27;ve not only had many releases, but an impressive proportion of well-designed, enjoyable games made with obvious care and enthusiasm. Things, in a word, are good. And yet I keep coming back to Ostriv, and Workers &amp; Resources. Neither are out of early access yet. But they&#x27;ve had me contemplating the nature of a settlement, and the complex relationships between people, leaders, and the land itself, where so many of their peers feel like a dispassionate excercise in placing tokens.
Building games are doing well. But they could be doing more.

                              <span>The next Need For Speed has been revealed at last, and its new graphical direction is what I can only describe as pulling an &#x27;Into The Spiderverse&#x27;. Yep, Need For Speed Unbound is looking pretty cel-shaded, with little cartoon streams of dust flying up from the wheels of your speeding vehicle. Substantially pimped-out vehicle, might I add, courtesy of rapper and general lad A$AP Rocky. Take a look at his motor in the trailer below.

                              <span>Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 isn&#x27;t even out yet and there&#x27;s already a rumour circulating that, to celebrate the series&#x27; 20th anniversary, the game&#x27;s going to receive a paid &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; map pack featuring a bunch of the classic maps from across the series. We&#x27;re talking favourites from Infinity Ward, Sledgehammer Games, and Treyarch, all rolled into one mega-bundle.
Of course, it&#x27;s only a rumour, which means it could be debunked at any moment. But it did get Hayden and I – the resident codders of the RPS Treehouse – thinking. If this rumour turns out to be true, which maps would we like to see return for Modern Warfare 2?

Y’see, Biotech introduces pregnancy, child-rearing, and families. It isn’t stopping there, because there’s also genetic engineering now. Your character will be able to psychically command semi-living machines too thanks to a special implant, making them your thralls. That’s one word for it, anyway.

The two week drought is broken with a shower of Electronic Wireless Show podcast rain, were we discuss the best villainous breakdowns we&#x27;ve enjoyed in video games. Matthew is sadly away this week because, while my coronavirus dose is mild, like the tingle of delicious Rio Tropical on your tongue, Matthew&#x27;s is wild and aggressive, like a super-charged Electricity Cop.
In his absence, Nate and I talk about some proper good villains, and even discuss some sensible things like evil cartoon monsters vs. villains you can sort of sympathise with. Handsome Jack? GLaDOS? LeChuck? Andrew Ryan? That&#x27;s one hell of an awkward dinner party. Plus stick around for a Cavern Of Lies that proves Warhammer 40k is essentially the same as Tumblr.

                              <span>Last month, I enjoyed playing Card Cowboy, a wee wild west adventure which uses cards to tell silly stories. As you cross the land in search of revenge, you build a hand of cards representing resources and events, which you use to resolve situations—often with strange and surprising results. What does happen if you try to lasso a villain with a mezcal worm? That free version was fun, and now the devs have expanded it into a £2 paid version with new cards, conundrums, and voice acting. It too is fun!

Ahead of Modern Warfare 2’s eruption on October 28th, rumours are circulating that Sledgehammer Games will return to the near-future world of their 2014 boots-off-the-ground instalment, Call Of Duty: Advanced Warfare.

                              <span>Over at Eurogamer, I kind of have a thing for LG&#x27;s Fast IPS screens. This tech combines the best feature of TN panels - their incredibly fast pixel response times - with the traditional advantages of an IPS screen, namely gorgeous colours and wide viewing angles. These screens pop up in LG&#x27;s 27GL850 and 27GL83A monitors, but are also used in Dell&#x27;s even better S2721DGFA - and it&#x27;s this monitor that&#x27;s on sale today. With a code available here, you can take an extra £30 off a model that&#x27;s already seen an £80 discount, dropping the price from £380 to £268 - an incredible deal for a monitor of this specification. I used the code $6ZZXZWLF0WV7D, but your code is likely to be different!
So what is this specification? Well, the S2721DGFA exists right at the sweet spot for gaming monitors too, with a 27-inch screen size, 2560x1440 resolution and 165Hz refresh rate. This spec is good because it&#x27;s not too hard to drive, even with a mid-range gaming PC, but you still get a noticeable increase in clarity and fluidity compared to your standard 1080p 60Hz monitors. And with the Fast IPS screen that I was talking about earlier, you have a monitor that&#x27;s equally well-suited to fast-paced, competitive shooters as it is slower-paced and more atmospheric games from a wide range of genres.

I have gone on about the Dell S2721DGFA a few times now, so I&#x27;ll link to those previous posts so you can find out a little bit more about this monitor - and see how much it used to cost too! Suffice it to say, if you have a look at some reviews you&#x27;ll see that I&#x27;m far from the only fan of this model, so I hope this deal is useful to you! Thanks for joining me once again and I&#x27;ll see you tomorrow for more deals.

                              <span>The Crucial X6 is one of the best portable SSDs on the market, and a ginormous 2TB model is currently discounted to £129 at Amazon, from its normal price of £150. This makes it the cheapest 2TB portable SSD by a significant margin, with alternatives like the Samsung T7 and SanDisk Extreme 2TB costing £191 or more - and an excellent value for a drive of this calibre.

Described as a “live tuning update”, the patch adjusts the difficulty of penalties and fiddles with dribbling speed for some players. These changes are already live in the game, but you’ll need to restart your FIFA session when the tuning update message pops up to apply it.

                              <span>Last time, you decided that ridiculous spell animations are better than the mangled hands of Ethan Winters. I would&#x27;ve been happy for that one to go either way, so I&#x27;m glad that the outcome was closer than I expected. This week, it&#x27;s a question of whether you leave a place with a song on your lips or your pockets bulging. What&#x27;s better: an end credits song, or utterly rinsing a place?

                              <span>Moonbreaker is an early access turn-based tabletop game by the Subnautica devs, and before you ask, no there isn&#x27;t a Blue Eyes White Basking Shark piece that inhales everything on the board. There are, however, plenty of sci-fi people who wield spears and guns and do battle by spending a currency called Cinder, if that&#x27;s your jam.
Whether you&#x27;re new to tabletop strategy or already like bashing miniatures together, the game makes for a perfectly enjoyable time. I just don&#x27;t know whether it goes beyond &quot;perfectly enjoyable&quot; into &quot;thrilling&quot;, though, and that may be down to its lack of, well, lots of things. Give it time and it may just evolve into a game of serious depth but right now it&#x27;s a bit too miniature to recommend wholeheartedly.

TaleWorlds Entertainment shared details of what’s coming to the game before it releases on October 25th, along with a look at what to expect after. That includes the possibility of DLC further down the road.

                              <span>Somewhere at the edges of the galaxy in No Man&#x27;s Sky lies a large, verdant planet with an abandoned, but functioning, starter ship on it. I left it there in 2016 after discovering a larger ship out in the wilds, but it&#x27;s a decision that still haunts me to this very day. You see, I was so taken with my new set of wings that I failed to notice it didn&#x27;t have a functioning hyperdrive attached, which is needed to punch through the atmosphere to visit another solar system. It also turned out that this particular planet didn&#x27;t have any of the necessary resources to craft a new one either, leaving my only form of escape back in my tiny little starter ship – which, of course, was now nowhere to be seen. I spent hours looking for that little ship, but the planet was so vast that I never saw it again. 
Upcoming aerial survival game Forever Skies doesn&#x27;t have lots of large planets to lose your only means of transportation in, thankfully. In its Steam Next Fest demo at least, the only things I was able to land my makeshift aircraft on were tiny, rusty platforms perched atop decaying skyscrapers on an Earth ruined by disease and an ecological apocalypse. But that fear of getting stranded somewhere I shouldn&#x27;t be has never left me, and I&#x27;d be lying if I said I wasn&#x27;t just a teensy bit scared of jumping down from my ship and finding I wasn&#x27;t able to get back up to it again.

Did I mention it’s coming out in 2023?

                              <span>Last month, Rachel and I made the long pilgrammage to Seattle in order to attend PAX West 2022. While we were there we ran around the show floor with a bag full of loose camera equipment, stopping frequently to enthuse about cool video games we&#x27;d discovered or to interview someone interesting. At the time, all of these videos were only accessible to our premium supporters. However, as 30 days have passed since we originally shared them, we&#x27;re now making them free for everyone to enjoy. Surprise!
From an interview with the voice cast of Team Fortress 2 to a comprehensive tour of the show floor, there&#x27;s something for everyone in this bundle of audio-visual delights. Scroll down to see what we got up to, and remember, if you like what you see please do consider funding content like this via our supporters programme. It truly means an awful lot.

                              <span>After years in operation, Canada-based IPTV provider SmoothStreams was shut down in July by Bell Media, Rogers, and members of MPA-Canada. An interim order was obtained to keep the service down and, among other things, compel its alleged operators to reveal who else was involved in the operation. Both stand accused of contempt of court for alleged non-compliance.

                              <span>DISH Network has won yet another significant damages award following a lawsuit filed against a pirate IPTV supplier. The U.S. broadcaster filed a complaint against My Indian TV in August 2021, but the service stayed online until this April. DISH will now take control of the service&#x27;s domains but whether it will see any of the $26.5m awarded by a New York court remains to be seen.

                              <span>Last week, Google announced it plans to shut down Stadia on January 18. One of the less-discussed casualties of the news was that Tequila Works’ Gylt, a horror adventure game and the first Stadia-exclusive title, would disappear entirely. Thankfully, that won’t be the case.
Tequila Works has confirmed that it plans to make Gylt multiplatform in 2023. It doesn’t specify which platforms the game will become available on, but it’s a relief to know that one of Stadia’s few original gems won’t be lost to history. 
🎃 We bring terrific news: GYLT is going multiplatform in 2023! More info to come in the upcoming months.https://t.co/ON1pbiGsB9 pic.twitter.com/2sWdseym2G
October 4, 2022
Gylt launched in November 2019 alongside Stadia. It stars a young girl named Sally who searches for her missing cousin across a town haunted by evil spirits. The narrative also serves a commentary on bullying and depresssion. The game’s vibe and art direction evoke films like Coraline or Tim Burton’s animated works and channels games like Inside and Silent Hill. Gameplay emphasizes stealth, with players using a flashlight to defeat enemies. Despite its more innocent veneer, the game has its share of genuinely creepy moments, and I personally found it to be an enjoyable horror romp.
Will you be checking out Gylt before Stadia shuts down or wait to play it elsewhere next year? Let us know in the comments!</span>

                              <span>Sony announced its new gaming loyalty program, PlayStation Stars, back in July, and the service is now live in North and South America. PlayStation users can sign up for the free program, but there’s one big caveat.
PlayStation Stars allows players to earn points and digital collectibles by completing “campaigns,” which range from completing small objectives while playing games to larger monthly challenges. Any PlayStation player can join Stars; you don’t need a Plus subscription. 
Completing campaigns also raises your Star Status, a leveling system consisting of four ranks. Everyone begins at Level 1, but doing things like purchasing games from PSN or earning a certain number of trophy rarities raises this level, increasing the quality of rewards you earn. 
Digital rewards, which Sony confirmed are not NFTs and cannot be resold, include models of old PlayStation consoles and characters from first-party titles. You can also redeem points to use as funds for your digital store wallet and to purchase DLC. Points remain available for 24 months after earning them. 
If you’re running to sign up now, there’s already a waitlist to join PS Stars. Sony states that new users will have to wait about two months after the date they register to be accepted into the program. It&#x27;s unclear why this is the case, but one could assume Sony doesn&#x27;t want to be flooded with too many memberships at once as it gradually gets the program off the ground. Registration also doesn&#x27;t seem consistent yet, as some folks were immediately let in while others have been told to wait (and some others still can&#x27;t access Stars in parts of the U.S. as of publishing). 
PlayStation Stars will launch in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand next week on October 13. To learn more about the program, including its handy FAQ, you can visit its official site here.</span>

Gotham Knights launches in just a couple of weeks, and Batman fans have been excited – and trepidatious – about the Bat clan’s big family adventure. To find out how the project is shaping up, I took a trip to Warner Bros. Montreal to play two hours of the game. I spent time-fighting crime as all four characters, explored Gotham’s open world, and took down criminals alongside a co-op partner. I also chatted with the dev team to uncover more nuggets about what the adventure brings to the table. Here are some general hands-on impressions and intr…</span>

                              <span>Bandai Namco has released a new trailer for the new-gen release of Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot alongside news that it hits PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S in January. 
More specifically, Kakarot comes to new-gen consoles on January 13, 2023, meaning we&#x27;re just a few months away from this re-release. To accompany today&#x27;s news, Bandai Namco has released a new trailer showcasing some of DBZ&#x27;s most iconic moments alongside some comparison clips between the PlayStation 4/Xbox One version of Kakarot and the upcoming new-gen update. Unsurprisingly, it looks a lot better. 
Check it out for yourself below: 


Kakarot on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S features updated visuals that look even better than the original release and 60 frames-per-second gameplay. If you already own the game, you can upgrade to the new-gen version of Kakarot for free. 
This new trailer also teases what&#x27;s to come in the game&#x27;s second season pass. The first DLC is called Bardock: Alone Against Fate, and it&#x27;s a new story arc. Two more story arc DLCs are in the season pass as well. Plus, Season Pass 2 owners will get a cooking item that increases HP and Ki defense. 
While waiting for January, read Game Informer&#x27;s Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot review to find out why we think the game is flawed but still highly enthralling.

Similar to Capcom&#x27;s Monster Hunter series, the central draw of Wild Hearts is the massive creatures and how you successfully hunt them down. You craft new weapons and armor along the way, growing stronger and stronger with each hunt, as you attempt to rid the land of Azuma of these beasts. The reveal trailer released last week gave some quick glimpses of what that looks like, but a new gameplay trailer showcases seven minutes of Wild Hearts gameplay.

Newcomer developer Stubby Games and publisher Playstack revealed The Entropy Centre during the Future Games Showcase in June, and it immediately caught my attention. On the one hand, it seemed to wear its Portal-inspiration on its sleeve, an immediate draw for me.

Both display a vast chaotic ballet, in which two teams composed of some of the most well-realised characters in hero shooters wage war until one team emerges triumphant. Just like its predecessor, Overwatch 2 is one of the most delicately crafted sensory onslaughts I&#x27;ve experienced in a game.
Guiding my old favourite heroes through venerable maps like King&#x27;s Row and Route 66, it&#x27;s like I never left. In many ways, it feels like I&#x27;ve simply been given a reason to play Overwatch 1 again. Is that enough for a sequel? Is it enough to justify the incredibly confusing, lengthy, and oft-botched process of trying to make Overwatch feel relevant again? I&#x27;m not certain it is. But perhaps it should be.

Overwatch took the gaming world by storm when it launched in 2016, thanks to its well-balanced roster of unique heroes and terrific objective-based, first-person-shooting gameplay. The game’s popularity endured through the years thanks to a wealth of new content like characters, maps, cosmetics, and game modes, adding to the terrific foundation. However, once the content dried up for Overwatch, the public interest followed shortly afterward. Overwatch 2 represents the re-emergence of one of…</span>

                              <span>Your host Wesley LeBlanc is joined by Game Informer editor Marcus Stewart to discuss Nier Automata: The End of YoRHa Edition, a new version of the game exclusive to Switch. The two discuss how the game runs and looks on Switch, how the experience holds up five years after its original release, and whether Nier Automata is still worth playing all these years later. 
While Nier Automat has, over the year, hit PlayStation and Xbox consoles, as well as PC, it has yet to reach a Nintendo platform...that is until this Thursday, October 6, when The End of YoRHa Edition is released. As for what to expect, this new edition of Nier Automata includes the following:
Nier Automata base game
All previously released DLC
New costumes exclusive to Switch
If you&#x27;re wondering whether Switch is the platform to play this on for newcomers, or if you&#x27;re wondering whether this new release is worth a replay, we have you covered in the latest New Gameplay Today, which you can watch below. Enjoy!

                              <span>The year 1985 contained so many cultural touchstones: Queen’s legendary Live Aid performance, Coca-Cola’s infamous New Coke release, the first-ever WrestleMania, and much more. Likely the most crucial moment to readers of Game Informer was the debut of the Nintendo Entertainment System.
The NES pulled the burgeoning industry out of the “video game crash” and introduced countless iconic characters and franchises. It seemed like every hit property received a game at the time. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Top Gun, DuckTales, Dungeons &amp; Dragons, American Gladiators: the list goes on and on. However, one iconic brand shockingly never made the transition into a NES game.
Garbage Pail Kids, which also debuted in 1985, was a trading card series that mixed the cuteness of the hit Cabbage Patch Kid…</span>

Platinum Games’ long-awaited threequel doesn’t rest on the laurels of its beloved predecessors. Gaming’s favorite witch has new tricks up her sleeves in the forms of Demon Masquerade and Demon Slave, letting players utilize their demonic minions in combat in new, kaiju-sized ways. If one Bayonetta wasn’t enough, a multiversal storyline introduces several variants that bring their unique brands of flair. At the center of this crisis stands newcomer Viola, the second playable character and rookie Umbra Witch, who serves as a mysterious key to the game’s events.

This news comes by way of the studio&#x27;s investor call today, in which the studio revealed Orion, the codename for its next Cyberpunk game. Not much else was revealed, but CDPR says Orion &quot;will take the Cyberpunk franchise further and continue harnessing the potential of this dark future universe.&quot; 
Up next was The Witcher. CDPR has revealed that its next Witcher game, which was announced earlier this year, is being developed under the codename Polaris. The studio says &quot;it is the beginning of a new saga&quot; and that it aims to release two more Witcher games after Polaris, creating a new AAA RPG Witcher trilogy.

                              <span>EA and Motive Studios have released the first official gameplay trailer for the upcoming remake of Dead Space. 
The studio has been slowly releasing new information and video clips of this remake in its behind-the-scenes showcases focused on things like the game&#x27;s sound, visuals, or something else. But today&#x27;s trailer marks the first time we&#x27;ve seen this much official gameplay at once and it looks great. Terrifying, of course, but great. 
Check out the official Dead Space remake gameplay trailer for yourself below: 


And here are some high-resolution screenshots from today&#x27;s trailer: 

As you can see, this remake is looking awesome and we can&#x27;t wait to go hands-on with it. Fortunately, we don&#x27;t have to wait too much longer because it hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on January 27, 2023.</span>

                              <span>Nintendo has revealed the first look at its upcoming Super Mario Bros. movie. 
Don&#x27;t get too excited just yet – this first look isn&#x27;t a trailer. But it is a new image showcasing our first look at the famed plumber in the Mushroom Kingdom of this movie, which is being made by Minions studio Illumination Entertainment. This image accompanies the announcement of a Nintendo Direct happening this Thursday, October 6, all about the movie. Nintendo specifically points out that there will be no video game news, however, so don&#x27;t expect anything more than Super Mario Bros. 
Tune in at 1:05 p.m. PT on 10/6 for a #NintendoDirect: The Super Mario Bros. Movie presentation introducing the world premiere trailer for the upcoming film (no game information will be featured).

Here&#x27;s a better look at it, too, courtesy of the film&#x27;s first poster:
As you can see, this image reveals quite a lot. There&#x27;s Toad, an antiques stall selling relics of Mario&#x27;s past video games, plenty of pipes and platforms, and of course, Princess Peach&#x27;s castle high above the rest of the kingdom. There&#x27;s probably plenty more to glean from the image so have at it. 
This image is our first look at the movie, but during the Direct on Thursday, which begins at 1:05 p.m. Pacific/4:05 p.m. Eastern, Nintendo will formally introduce the movie with the first-ever world premiere trailer, so be sure to tune in. 
Super Mario Bros. hits theaters on April 7, 2023.
While waiting for this Thursday direct, read about how Nintendo is reportedly happy with the film and so happy, that additional Nintendo movies are likely on the way. Read about how Chris Pratt says his Mario voice is &quot;unlike anything you&#x27;ve heard in the Mario world&quot;. After that, then check out this story about how a producer from the movie says Mario won&#x27;t have an Italian accent in the film.

                              <span>Sony might be interested in helping produce movies and television shows based on From Software games. 
This news comes by way of a new interview between Reuters and PlayStation Studios head Hermen Hulst, in which Hulst explains PlayStation&#x27;s investments into its PC and mobile efforts as of late, as well as its recent investment into Elden Ring developer From Software. According to Hulst, &quot;further investments in areas that will strengthen the expansion on to PC, on to mobile, and into live services&quot; is definitely a possibility for PlayStation. 


However, more interesting to From Software fans perhaps is Hulst&#x27;s answer when asked about Sony&#x27;s investment in the studio. 
&quot;You should think of collaborations on the game development side first and foremost, but it&#x27;s also not unthinkable with our PlayStation Productions efforts that we explore opportunities,&quot; he said. 
While Sony has a 14.09% stake in From Software, that&#x27;s not quite enough to make decisions independent of the studio&#x27;s other investors, like Tencent, which acquired 16.25% of From Software around the same time Sony invested. So while PlayStation Productions might be interested in a Bloodborne horror movie one day or an Elden Ring TV series about Jar Bairn, for example, From Software and its other investors would likely need to give the green light as well. Here&#x27;s hoping, though, because From Software&#x27;s properties, be it Bloodborne, Elden Ring, Dark Souls, or something else, seem ripe for an on-screen adaptation. 
While waiting to see if anything comes of this, read about how Bloober Team is making a TV series adaptation and then read about how Sony is developing God of War, Gran Turismo, and Horizon screen adaptations after that.

                              <span>Bloober Team has announced that its 2021 psychological horror game, The Medium, is getting a TV adaptation. 
The studio announced this in a new blog post today, as translated by Bloody Disgusting, which reveals Tomasz Bagiński, an executive producer for Netflix&#x27;s Witcher series, and Bloober Team&#x27;s own Piotr Babieno will oversee the show. 
&quot;Both the film industry and the video game industry are close to my heart, and I am very happy that there is finally an opportunity to bring them both together,&quot; Babieno writes in the blog post, according to Bloody Disgusting. &quot;The story we told in the game was appreciated by players, and now more people will be able to hear about it. The latest hits of streaming platforms based on games such as Cyberpunk: Edgerunners or Arcane have shown that this is the perfect time for such productions.&quot; 
As noted in Babieno&#x27;s writing above, The Medium will join a slew of recent video game adaptations that have found great success, like Cyberpunk: Edgerunners (Cyberpunk 2077) and Arcane (League of Legends), and others still in development, like Sony&#x27;s God of War, Horizon, and Gran Turismo productions.

Much like my Liverpool fandom over the past 20 years, I vacillate between happily obsessive and begrudgingly bewildered with FIFA. Like Liverpool, when FIFA works like a well-oiled machine, play on the field is beautiful, slick, and drives my football-loving brain to elation with dopamine hits. However, FIFA 23 feels like FIFA 22, which was similar to FIFA 21, with additions ranging from mildly impactful to invigorating.
FIFA has focused on one facet of soccer for years: the attack. It’s almost arc…</span>

Once you get past its bizarre name, Dorfromantik offers simple, relaxing sessions of tile-matching puzzle goodness. Connecting hexagons to build pretty landscapes offers the thoughtful strategy of a city-builder to provide a stimulating yet overwhelmingly Zen atmosphere. 
Fans of the board game Carcassonne should quickly grasp Dorfromantik&#x27;s concept of drawing random tiles and finding high-scoring – and aesthetically pleasing – ways to place them on the field based on their scenery. Tiles only fit next to those with corresponding edges; r…</span>

                              <span>Dead Space fans will finally get a new look at gameplay for the upcoming remake of the first game. The game’s official Twitter account announced that we’ll see this footage tomorrow at 8 a.m. Pacific/11 a.m. Eastern on the game’s YouTube channel. 
Trailer tomorrow. Tune in at 8am PT for the first official look at #DeadSpace gameplay.

This premiere is being dubbed as the &quot;first official” look at gameplay. That distinction likely means that the footage will be of a near-complete build of the game since developer Motive Studios has spent the last year releasing several behind-the-scenes videos showcasing gameplay in more unfinished forms. This transparent approach to Dead Space’s development has given fans raw looks at how the 2008 classic is being updated. Player feedback from these videos has even allowed Motive to make subtle but important changes earlier in the pipeline. With the game only a few months away, we&#x27;re curious to see how all of that work has coalesced. 
Dead Space launches on January 27 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</span>

This news comes by way of MP1st, which reports that its sources tell the publication that this remake/remaster will feature an improved lighting system, overhauled textures, better animations, and character models more in line with those of Horizon Forbidden West, Zero Dawn&#x27;s sequel that released back in February. However, MP1ST notes that its sources didn&#x27;t say whether this was a &quot;built from the ground up&quot; remake or a remaster – it might fall somewhere in between for all we know. 


According to MP1st, one of the project&#x27;s big focuses (ha) is bringing Forbidden West&#x27;s accessibility features over to Zero Dawn, something Sony did with The Last of Us Part II and Part I. As f…</span>

                              <span>Rowing Blazers, a New York-based clothing brand, has announced a new line of Sonic the Hedgehog apparel. The collection draws inspiration from Sonic&#x27;s aesthetic from the 1990s, with graphics inspired by art from the time. 
Those who are interested in the collection can look forward to clothing items like a cotton sweater with Sonic&#x27;s image, a zip-up polar fleece, heavyweight rugby jerseys, a French terry loopback hoodie, cotton tees, and mesh shorts. The line also includes baseball caps, canvas tote bags, a necktie, and a hand-embroidered Sonic patch for blazers and other clothing items.
You can see a gallery of some of the items in the collection below.

According to Jack Carlson, founder and creative director of Rowing Blazers, which has done collaborations with FILA, Umbro, the NBA, and more, the company&#x27;s creations all hold important links to his personal life.
&quot;A lot of it has to do with the things I loved growing up: the sports, the brands, the culture,&quot; he said in a press release. &quot;I grew up in the &#x27;90s playing Sonic the Hedgehog on the Sega Genesis. Sonic has always been such an interesting character to me. In the original games, he was a little bit brash, a little bit punk. He was different from other cartoon and video game protagonists. He was very &#x27;90s. Of course, there have been a lot of Sonic clothing capsules created over the years. I wanted to do something elevated, really beautifully made, and kind of timeless in its aesthetic. Of course, there&#x27;s a kind of irony to it because Sonic himself isn&#x27;t really very preppy, but that&#x27;s the fun of it.&quot;
The collection retails as low as $38 to $325, though nothing is currently listed at the higher end of that spectrum just yet. The collection is live now, having launched yesterday. If you&#x27;d like to check out the collection for yourself, you can head here.</span>
