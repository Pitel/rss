She&#x27;s been added as a human woman in a festive coat who intermittently turns into an invulnerable deer that can charge about the screen, plunging into enemies that would normally kill you in a heartbeat. She might be a little overpowered, but hey, it&#x27;s Christmas.

While we settle down into our mountain of games, sweet wrappers and warm blankets for a couple of weeks, we wish you a merry Christmas, a happy holiday and a general Festivus to all who celebrate. The site won&#x27;t be completely silent during the break - we&#x27;ve got a couple of fun things planned for you over the next week and a bit - but we&#x27;ll be back in full bright and early on Tuesday, January 3rd 2023.

                              <span>Death Stranding director Hideo Kojima has claimed his upcoming Death Stranding movie is &quot;taking a direction that nobody has tried before with a movie adaptation of a game&quot;, arguing that other attempts to wring movies out of game-ies have failed because they &quot;cater to gamers&quot;. His will be different, he says, because he&#x27;s &quot;taking the approach of changing and evolving the world of Death Stranding in a way that suits film well&quot;.
He also says there&#x27;s &quot;no real need&quot; to turn games into films, which is a true and enjoyable acknowledgement from someone who is doing that.

                              <span>The Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit is a playable teaser released to promote Life Is Strange 2, the first episode of which followed on three months after this surprise p.t. dropped during E3 2018. Not to be confused with Silent Hills P.T. (it&#x27;s like… the exact opposite of that), Captain Spirit is free to play, takes two to three hours to complete, and manages to perfectly encapsulate the Life Is Strange experience without giving anything away about the main (read: paid-for) games in the series. It also features possibly my favourite LIS protagonist in adorable wannabe superhero Chris, which is quite a high bar to clear, considering how much time I spend banging on about what great characters Chloe and Sean are.

                              <span>Legendarily complicated (and just generally legendary) colony sim Dwarf Fortress launched on Steam a few weeks ago, bringing sprite graphics, more players and millions of dollars for developers Bay 12 games. Brothers Tarn and Zach Adams have spent the past 16 years relying on donations, so actually selling their game has now allowed to expand their team and hire someone from their community to help with the programming. They say &quot;Putnam&quot; will be the first non-Adam to ever see the code behind the curtain. Cue the Indiana Jones face-melting gif.
An update yesterday also added Steam trading cards, as well as giving you the option to flick between classic and premium graphics.

It is interesting to consider that I could try to wipe the website, delete loads of articles, do something to burn down my job. I don&#x27;t particularly want to, but the coiled potential to do it exists, because I am unsupervised. There is no other member of staff between me and all of you. The great filter is removed. Any typos are on purpose. How you doin&#x27;?
This gives me a great opportunity, because I get to have, in a sense, the final word on RPS this year. There are a lot of posts coming up (if we include the Advent Calendar posts that have already gone, we have 50-ish bits of hashtag seasonal hashtag content this year, which I think is the most I&#x27;ve had to schedule for a Christmas break yet), but almost everything after this point is a scheduled post, made of time travel words written days or weeks ago. I&#x27;m live and uncensored, baby. I&#x27;m going to fire up Among Trees. Let&#x27;s go and be alone together. But don&#x27;t worry, I take my responisbility seriously, so I&#x27;ll make sure the final word is a joke.

                              <span>It&#x27;s a well known fact that there are &quot;Too Many Games&quot;(TM) these days. I have not done the maths, but I&#x27;ve seen enough graphs, tweets and analysis from people who have crunched the numbers to know there are more games coming out on Steam every day than a site like RPS could ever possibly hope to cover a single month, let alone every week. But gosh darn it if we don&#x27;t try our hardest all the same. 
Inevitably, though, time does get the better of us sometimes (or, in my case at least, maybe my eyes are just too big for my gaming stomach), and certain games end up slipping further and further down our to-do lists until they eventually fall away entirely. Not through any fault of their own, mind. Just... time. But as a final parting shoutout for 2022, I wanted to memorialise all the games that fell of my personal to-do list this year and say, &quot;I&#x27;M SORRY, I DIDN&#x27;T MEAN IT, I PROMISE!&quot; (For real, though, I still want to talk about all of these at some point. Maybe January...? Please don&#x27;t hate me)

                              <span>Serious racing games are not, as a rule, my thing. If the goal is to repeat a course 20 times to trim 0.2 seconds off a number, and not to cackle like a petty chaos gremlin as you slam someone off the track at a tight corner, I am probably not going to enjoy myself much.
Rush Rally 3 isn&#x27;t all that serious, but it&#x27;s still on the wrong side of the tracks for me, I thought, before accidentally playing it for 3 hours. This is an excellent bundle of rally trials, challenges, and simple circuit racing with a cheerfully mid-2000s feel. I might prefer the messy nonsense of Trail Out, but if you value actual driving skill more highly, this is well worth your time.

                              <span>Last week I spoke to Larian&#x27;s founder and director Swen Vincke about the latest big update to Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3, and the road to 1.0 release. But also it was December the 16th, so I saw fit to waste his time asking a bunch of fun seasonal questions that blended the love and goodwill of Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3, with the companion-wrangling and clutch strategy of Christmas. D&#x27;you see what I did there?
My questions are in bold, and Vincke&#x27;s answers are undeneath - and they are both amusing and instructive. I for one hope that Wyll&#x27;s romcom visit home becomes a future winter DLC.

                              <span>December always feels like a good month for VR gaming. Perhaps it&#x27;s because Christmas and VR headsets go together like mangers and Messiahs, or perhaps its because virtual reality is the only place I&#x27;m likely to see sunlight before March. In any case, if you&#x27;re giving or receiving a pair of magic goggles this festive season, I&#x27;ll be recommending a couple of stocking fillers to go with it at the end of this article.


First though, it&#x27;s time for a more general bit of stocktaking. 2022 was a big ol&#x27; shrug of a year for VR gaming. Which is not to say it was bad, plenty of fun and interesting games launched in the last twelve months, one of which I&#x27;d probably put in my personal top ten. But from both a hardware and software perspective, nothing released this year is likely to shift the needle.

                              <span>A scarce commodity
Do you own a jar of my toenail clippings? Not many people do. They’re a scarce commodity, but scarcity is a daft reason to own anything. It’s hardwired into our brain that if there are few of something, we want it more. We know it as the “fear of missing out,” and it’s one of the most annoying subsets of greed.
Video game collecting is a pretty innocuous embodiment of this. To my knowledge, no wars have been fought over a copy of Snatcher on the Sega CD. However, it’s still rather annoying. I collect games because they are a tangible representation of the game. I like to play them. Don’t give me a factory-sealed game, because I will open it. I don’t want to look down on anyone else’s reasoning for why they collect games, but I can’t help but find it ridiculous that some …</span>

I don’t know how Steel Empire snuck up on me, but I had never heard tell of it until I held the Genesis clamshell case in my hands. A horizontal shoot-’em-up where you can pilot a blimp? Get out of my dreams and into my Genesis. However, I later learned that Steel Empire had been ported to 3DS and then to PC. Our boy, Chris Carter, even reviewed it back in the day. Since I was an avid reader of Destructoid at the time, I probably saw it, but it didn’t connect.
So, here I thought I discovered some lost gem of the Genesis library, and really it’s been in circulation this whole time. Ah well, it’s not some sort of competition. If it was, I would have so many participation trophies.

The wallet-troubling merchandisers over at Good Smile Co. have opened pre-orders on the next gaming superstar joining its enormous range of ridiculously adorable Nendoroid figurines — And this time around, it&#x27;s a true icon of the medium, with the coming of Street Fighter legend Chun-Li!

As with all Nendoroid releases, Chun-Li stands a dinky 100mm in height, (that&#x27;s just under four inches), and comes complete with a stand and several faceplates and accessories — allowing fans to stage The Strongest Woman in The World in all manner of dynamic poses. The additional Faceplates include a business face, a cute smile, and even a tearful expression, though why you&#x27;d use that is beyond me. Accessories include alternate hands, a Kikoken fireball, and Chunner&#x27;s famous Lightning Legs kick!

If you&#x27;d like your own pocket-sized Chun-Li to stand guard over your desk, then you can pre-order her right now over at the official Good Smile Co. store and other toy retailers. Nendoroid Chun-Li retails for ¥8,400, (or roughly $58 USD), not including shipping, handling, or any potential customs charges. Chun-Li is expected to ship in the summer of 2023. Surprisingly, this is only the first of the Street Fighter Nendoroids. Given the huge roster of characters on offer, one would think Good Smile would have tapped this market long before now.
YA-TA!

                              <span>Gods revel, lands tremble
Final Fantasy XIV isn&#x27;t waiting too long in the new year for its next update. Patch 6.3 for Final Fantasy XIV is due to arrive on January 10, 2023, bringing new story and raid content, as well as many other changes and additions.
The trailer shown off today during the Live Letter spotlights what the protagonist, or Warrior of Light, will be getting up to as the main story content continues. We see newer addition to the cast Zero a fair bit, but it also looks like Alisae and Alphinaud will be involved too.

We also see some of the new raid content coming to Final Fantasy XIV&#x27;s current 24-player raid series, Myths of the Realm. Seems the gods will continue to test players, and I&#x27;m really digging the bits we saw of their arenas.
Home sweet Island Sanctuary
Of course, a Final Fantasy XIV patch is a grand affair, and there&#x27;s much more on the way too. As outlined on the Patch 6.3 site, there are updates to Tataru&#x27;s Grand Endeavor, additional Duty support, and both a new Unreal Trial and Ultimate Raid. It seems like XIV players who like the high-end content will have their hands full with the new update.
But if you prefer a quiet life, in the sanctity of a peaceful island, there&#x27;s something for you too. The Island Sanctuary is getting an update, which will include a new landmark, and some big quality-of-life changes that Square Enix&#x27;s Naoki Yoshida outlines during the Live Letter. Picking up all leavings and yields in one fell swoop is going to be a game-changer.
While the holidays may just be getting started, Final Fantasy XIV looks poised to ring in the new year with a big patch. We&#x27;ll see where the MSQ goes, and maybe head back to our islands for a little maintenance, on January 10, 2023.

                              <span>What could I do (a thousand nights without you)
Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII has had a somewhat mythical status for me over the past half-decade or so. I didn’t get into the Final Fantasy VII compilation until just a few years ago when I finally played through the PlayStation original for a short-lived feature series here at Destructoid. I absolutely fell for the game and its world before I watched the credits roll on it. I wanted more, but by then, the PSP was already a dinosaur, and for whatever reason, Crisis Core never found its way onto PSN. Not wanting to drop the money on a handheld for just one game, I was left to admire what I perceived it to be from afar.
Last year, when Square Enix announced Final Fantasy VII: Ever Crisis, my first thought was how I’d finally be able to see Za…</span>

Today&#x27;s the last day of Nintendo&#x27;s House of Indies celebration, and one particular indie closed out the festivities. Sports Story from Sidebar Games is out now on the Nintendo Switch.
The follow-up to 2017&#x27;s Golf Story is live now on the Nintendo Switch eShop, with a $14.99 price tag. According to the description, Sports Story continues to mix sports and RPG, much like Golf Story did.
But as the name implies, there are a lot of sporting activities in the mix. There are eight unique golf courses, a tennis world tour, the ability to start your own soccer team, and apparently even some radical BMXing to do.

Good Smile Co. has opened pre-orders on its second Nendoroid figure pulled from Supergiant Games&#x27; excellent roguelite, Hades — Joining the huge collection of dinky PVC pop-culture characters is our first boss, the guardian of Tartarus, and Zagreus&#x27; rival in both love and war, Megaera.

Megaera stands a miniature 100mm in height (just under four inches) and is packed out with the posing power that comes as standard with the Nendoroid range. The harsh-whisperin&#x27; fury sister comes complete with a selection of alternate hands and faceplates, including her trademark RBF and even a rarely-seen smile. Of course, Meg would not be Meg without her trusty whip, though she can also be posed with her Skull Earring Keepsake or her cute, but surprisingly powerful, Battie Companion.

 
The Hades Megaera Nendoroid is available to pre-order now over at the Good Smile Co. website and other collectible retailers. Meg retails for ¥8,500, (or roughly $58 USD), not including shipping or any potential customs charges. The fury sister will ship in the summer of 2023. Previous Hades Nendoroids Zagreus and Thanatos are available now. I&#x27;m not really a Nendo collector, but if they release all three Fury Sisters then I&#x27;ll definitely pick the trio up.
They can keep me in line on days I don&#x27;t want to work. Today is a fine example, to be honest.

                              <span>25 years of Real Driving excellence
Today is the 25th anniversary of gaming&#x27;s foremost driving simulator, Gran Turismo. And to celebrate the occasion, Sony Interactive Entertainment and Polyphony Digital released a video message, thanking the community and the team for delivering over two decades of critically acclaimed racing action.
The first Gran Turismo launched on PlayStation on December 23, 1997, kicking off a franchise that aimed to bring a sense of realism and technical authenticity to the racing game genre. With the ever-evolving technology of PlayStation hardware, developer Polyphony Digital has been afforded the opportunity to push the envelope further and further, with sequels boasting increasingly photo-realistic visuals and immersive driving physics almost unparalleled in the genre.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;1zIcBFcLM7U&amp;ab_channel&#x3D;GRANTURISMOTV
A lengthy letter from Polyphony Digital CEO Kazunori Yamauchi, released for the anniversary, reflects on the history of the franchise, while also revealing that a staggering 90 million Gran Turismo titles have been sold since the series&#x27; debut. Yamauchi speaks of his and the Polyphony team&#x27;s immense pride in the franchise, noting that the studio still carries a sense of revitalized determination into the current and forthcoming gaming generations.
&quot;I can’t ever thank enough the Gran Turismo users and people of the Gran Turismo community who have played our new titles, which at times could be said to have been very experimental, writes Yamauchi. &quot;We are here today because of all the people who supported us. I believe the Gran Turismo series have always pursued “beauty.” The beauty of the cars, the beauty of the scenery, the beauty of the lighting, the beauty of driving, the beauty of sounds/music and the beauty of the graphics.&quot;
&quot;The “pursuit of beauty” is the motivation for creating Gran Turismo.&quot;

                              <span>Rockstar and Coffee Stain buttin&#x27; heads
Coffee Stain Games has been forced to pull a new ad for its upcoming sequel Goat Simulator 3 after Rockstar Games took umbrage to its use of the leaked Grand Theft Auto (GTA) VI development footage.
The commercial saw the supposed four-legged hero of the physics-sim sequel, Shaun, discussing the preparation it takes to really deliver the goods as the premier star of the Goat Simulator series. As we see Shaun practicing his very finest ragdoll efforts, he tells us that he has been keeping busy between games — cutting to a montage of Shaun in action, which includes a clip of the controversial GTA VI dev footage, leaked earlier this year.
While this is not the first time the Goat Simulator crew has referenced another developer for satirical fun, Rockstar Games — as billion-dollar companies are wont to do — clearly didn&#x27;t see the funny side. The ad in question has since been pulled from all official outlets, with even reuploads posted to Twitter and other social media sites by members of the public being shut down as quickly as they appear.
Rockstar Games is still shining from the theft and broadcast of the (clearly very, very early) development footage. The videos were allegedly stolen in September directly from the company&#x27;s own Slack channels by a 17-year-old hacker, who, is it also claimed, had planned to extort the publisher, but instead found himself in the bad books and black vans of the feds. The suspect is expected to appear in a high court at a later date.
Goat Simulator 3, which does not feature any GTA VI source code , (that we know of) is available now on PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X.

Hot on the heels of yesterday&#x27;s update for Konami&#x27;s TMNT: The Cowabunga Collection, publisher Dotemu has announced a new patch for Tribute Games&#x27; great brawler TMNT: Shredder&#x27;s Revenge. Now available on all platforms, the update adds a variety of fun modes and features to the retro scrapper.
First and foremost, the new Custom Game mode allows hosts to tweak a variety on in-game options in order to fine-tune their Shredder-smashing experience. Players can now take on fast enemies, play as the same characters, turn up the difficulty, switch out health for supers, and even access infinite credits for shellfish ease. It should be noted that turning on any of these extra options rules out leaderboard access, or the unlocking of achievements.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;GemOAwU-9fo&amp;ab_channel&#x3D;Dotemu
Additionally, some fun new filters have been made available, allowing for players to give the screen the curved, pixelated look of an arcade monitor, or a &#x27;90s-tastic, bleeding-color style of a VCR tape. Radical. In regards to online play, a new option will allow the host to dictate the amount of players allowed to join a game, from two to four. Guest players can also rejoin previously left games.
Importantly, the new update brings a host of tweaks, balance changes, and bug fixes to Shredder&#x27;s Revenge. While many were happy to praise the game for its authentic retro style and attention to detail, many critics and fans have papered over the litany of bugs that ruin an otherwise great experience. Fortunately, this new patch addresses a variety of problems — from random crashes and vanishing bosses, to broken scores and input glitches. Additionally, a small selection of player and enemy moves have been buffed/nerfed, in order to provide a tighter, fairer experience.
TMNT: Shredder&#x27;s Revenge is available now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.

                              <span>Ragnarok will return
The latest God of War game has been out for a bit now, and players are likely finishing up and watching credits roll over the holidays. And if they wanted a reason to start it all over again, they&#x27;ll have it later on in 2023 too. Sony Santa Monica confirms that New Game Plus is coming to God of War Ragnarok next spring.
&quot;We know many of you have been asking, so we&#x27;re happy to confirm that New Game Plus will be coming to God of War Ragnarok in Spring 2023!&quot; the tweet reads. More details will be shared closer to the mode&#x27;s actual release.
https://twitter.com/SonySantaMonica/status/1605971630609539073
No details have been given as to what the mode will officially entail. The 2018 reboot of God of War also got a New Game Plus mode down the line, so we can extrapolate a bit from that. The previous God of War&#x27;s NG+ included a difficulty option, a handful of new armor sets and abilities, and some new attack patterns for enemies. It&#x27;ll be interesting to see how much Ragnarok carries into its own New Game Plus, because the 2018 God of War&#x27;s version is pretty hefty.
A new father-son adventure
On top of the New Game Plus mode, support has been rolling out steadily for God of War Ragnarok. Recently, Sony Santa Monica added a photo mode into the options. And early patches have hit a sizeable number of tweaks and fixes.
It&#x27;s Sony&#x27;s big game for the end of the year. But it&#x27;s nice to see that Ragnarok will carry on into 2023, too. Hopefully fans get a little extra fun out of the game when the New Game Plus rolls out.

Success Corporation has announced that it will launch a PC port of modern cute-&#x27;em-up Cotton Fantasy in January 2023. Following on from its previous release on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, the colorful shmup will launch on Steam under its far superior Japanese moniker of Cotton Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll!
Developed by Studio Saizensen to coincide with the series&#x27; 30th Anniversary, Cotton Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll sees the titular witch-in-training continue her broomstick-riding, monster-blasting ways as she takes to the skies for 10 stages of hyper-energetic pew-pew action. As always, our mop-topped hero is not alone, and players can choose from several classic characters and guest stars including Appli, Ria, Fina, Kawase, and Luffee, don&#x27;t forget to seek help from Cotton&#x27;s bestie — the sexy space fairy Silk.

Along with a brand new story mode, packed with shenanigans and candy, Cotton Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll will feature a handy Training Mode, allowing players to practice their skills on a particularly tricky part of the adventure. Online leaderboards will also let the best of the witches show off their finest scores and times. While I will admit that the concept of the 100% Cotton franchise making a comeback in the 2020s couldn&#x27;t have been further from my mind, it is definitely still cool to see these long-forgotten franchises dusted off, decades later, for one more spin through the stars.
Cotton Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll launches on PC, (via Steam) on January 5, 2023 — It is available now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch as Cotton Fantasy.

Did you know that every year Nintendo publishes at least one new IP? It’s true, they haven’t missed a year since 1983, the year the Famicom launched in Japan.  In 2020 we had Good Job!, Astral Chain in 2019, Sushi Striker in 2018, and Ever Oasis in 2017 — and that’s only naming one each year. Given how only a few of them ever hit a mainstream audience though (like 2019’s Ring Fit Adventure), it’s no surprise if they slipped your mind.

And we&#x27;re back! Another year done and dusted; one that was jam-packed with Switch games. It might have lacked a mainline Zelda or Mario, but Pokémon fans got double bubble in 2022, with Pokémon Legends: Arceus and Pokémon Scarlet and Violet topping and tailing the year.
In between those potent Pocket Monster packages, we got a large portion of Kirby (plus a tasty side dish), a selection of sports (both the Switch and Mario Strikers variety), a trio of excellent games with a &#x27;3&#x27; in the title (Xenoblade, Splatoon, and Bayonetta), and both Koei Tecmo and Ubisoft taking the reins on Nintendo IP with Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes and Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope respectively.

Well folks, it&#x27;s certainly been a long time coming but we are pleased to see that Sports Story (the much-anticipated sequel to 2017&#x27;s Golf Story) is now available on the Switch eShop!
The announcement came as a part of today&#x27;s Inside the House of Indies event - which has been revealing upcoming Switch titles and shadow drops for the past five days. As the final day of the showcase, we were keeping our fingers crossed that Sports Story might finally see the light of day, and here we are.

Update #4 : It&#x27;s here, folks! Sports Story is the headliner of Nintendo&#x27;s final day of its festive House of Indies. Boy, if we found something like that in our Advent Calendar, we&#x27;d be very happy.
The long-awaited follow-up to Golf Story, after being teased for a December release date in the last Indie World, is out now! But that&#x27;s not the only cracking release Nintendo has shared on the final day of treats. There&#x27;s some Sea Of Stars news too from Yasunori Mitsuda, the legendary Chrono Trigger and Cross composer.

Trim the sails and hoist anchor, because Sail Forth has launched without warning on Switch. This relaxing, laid-back exploration game drops players in an ocean filled with strange locals and even stranger characters. Those looking for realism in their sailing game will find better options out there, but Sail Forth has an undeniable charm that will suck you in from the opening.
Sail Forth opens with Captain Toot awakening on their damaged boat with words of doom delivered by a glowing light in the sky. Within moments, they are setting off across the water, recruiting new sailors to their cause and, eventually, building a fleet of ships under their command. Despite the opening cutscene promising a tale of saving the world, that concept is quickly dropped for what becomes the focus of the game: wandering aimlessly.

Think for a second about Nintendo&#x27;s biggest games of 2022. There was Pokémon Legends: Arceus, Kirby and the Forgotten Land, Xenoblade Chronicles, Bayonetta and Splatoon 3, Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, the list goes on. It would make sense then, don&#x27;t you think, for the company to use one of these in a comical festive pose for its usual &#x27;Happy Holidays&#x27; social media post, right?
So what did @NintendoEurope decide to go for this year? Was it a cute image of Pawmi and Fuecoco frolicking in the snow? Perhaps a giant snowball shaped like Kirby or the Gura Flava Camp experiencing a heavy frost? Nope, it&#x27;s a post from @SplatoonJP of an Inkling and two Octolings. And they&#x27;re just standing there...

The latest Japanese boxed charts are here (albeit slightly late this week) and there&#x27;s no change for the top two spots, with Pokémon Scarlet and Violet and Splatoon 3 sitting comfortably in their usual positions. Scarlet and Violet are very close to crossing the 4 million sales mark, and we wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if it hasn&#x27;t already achieved such a milestone by the time you&#x27;re reading this.
Crisis Core - Final Fantasy VII - Reunion made its debut, coming in at number three, four, and five for the PS5, PS4, and Switch versions respectively. Adding up sales across all three platforms, the game managed a total of 156,530 units sold, which is genuinely fantastic for a spin-off title.

First up we&#x27;ve got Gravity Circuit by Domesticated Ant Games - a &quot;flashy&quot; action packed 2D platformer drawing inspiration from the classics of yesteryear. Players take control of a hero named Kai - who is the world&#x27;s last line of defense. Some key features include a slew of combos and moves, new power-ups to unlock, and a single-player campaign with 12 stages.

If you keep up with Nintendo Switch Online&#x27;s icon rewards scheme, you&#x27;ll know it normally offers up new ones on a regular basis. Today is a little bit different though...
The latest round features returning icons, so if you missed out on certain icons the first time around, now is your chance to secure them as they&#x27;re rotating daily. In this run, players can redeem icons based on series such as Breath of the Wild, Super Mario Odyssey and Xenoblade Chronicles 3.

Square Enix is known for releasing some pretty generous game demos and this time it&#x27;s back with one for its latest Dragon Quest spin-off, Dragon Quest Treasures.
This game arrived on the Switch earlier this month and was generally well-received by the critics. In our own Nintendo Life review we gave the title eight out of ten stars - calling it a &quot;great&quot; introduction to the RPG genre. It can be just as fun for veterans as well.

Pokémon Scarlet and Violet have been out for less than a few months now and the new generation has already had a number of distribution events. In case you missed it earlier this week, the latest promotion gives trainers the chance to catch a Delibird.
From between the 23rd and 25th of December, Delibird will appear more frequently in Tera Raid Battles. These Delibird will have &quot;various Tera Types&quot; - so be ready for a fierce battle. Defeating these Delibird will also yield plenty of rewards including Tera Shards.

Actor Gaten Matarazzo, who&#x27;s most famous for playing Dustin Henderson in the hit Netflix show Stranger Things, has partnered with Nintendo for the Holiday season to talk about the company&#x27;s latest games. It turns out, the star is actually a big fan of the Big N. In an interview with Variety, Matarazzo spoke of his love of Nintendo and its properties — including one series that he thinks would make a fantastic animated film.
While the actor spends time looking ahead to this year&#x27;s festive period and reflecting on his busy year, Matarazzo muses on the idea of an animated Legend of Zelda movie. He tells Variety that he&#x27;s a big fan of the series and that he wants to see a &quot;very visually and musically driven animated film&quot;. He continues:

                              <span>Sports Story is available now, Nintendo and developer SideBar Games announced during a special Inside the House of Indies holiday video. The surprise launch comes a month and a half after the developer gave us a December 2022 release window for the long-awaited follow up to its 2017 smash hit, Golf Story.
Golf Story provided players a retro-styled RPG with a zany story centered around golf of all kinds: regular, disc, and more. Sports Story sees SideBar Games expand the formula to include various other athletic events, including BMX, tennis, cricket, soccer, volleyball, fishing, and more. If you loved the golf of Golf Story, don&#x27;t worry: That sport carries over to Sports Story, bringing with it eight unique golf courses. 
You can see the full video, which also provides updates for Sea of Stars, Undying, and Dust &amp; Neon, below.


Golf Story, SideBar Games&#x27; predecessor to Sports Story, arrived on Switch on September 28, 2017. In our review, we called it &quot;a breath of fresh air for sports, and another fun story to follow for role-playing fanatics,&quot; awarding it a 9 out of 10. Sports Story was initially announced by SideBar Games in December 2019, with long stretches of silence from the development team. Then, during last month&#x27;s Indie World Showcase from Nintendo, the developers finally announced that the game would arrive at some point in December 2022.
Sports Story is available now for Switch.</span>

                              <span>The Gran Turismo series has long been a favorite of sim-racing enthusiasts, and today marks a special milestone for the franchise. Gran Turismo: The Real Driving Simulator was released on PlayStation in Japan on December 23, 1997, meaning that the series has officially crossed the quarter-century mark. To celebrate 25 years of Gran Turismo, PlayStation released a special blog post and a retrospective video.
The blog post comes by way of Kazunori Yamauchi, creator and producer of the franchise and CEO of Polyphony Digital. In the post, Yamauchi recounts how the series came to be, with his original plans for the series stretching as far back as 1992.

Do you wonder if The Game Awards are fair? Try asking a Xenoblade Chronicles fan.
Every year, The Game Awards come and go with some measure of controversy. For many category winners, the gaming community throws accusations of an anti-anime bias or a preference towards publishers with the most money. Other times, the community will wonder why games like Sifu wind up in categories like “Best Fighting Game.” No matter what game wins each category, there is rarely a universal consensus that the pick makes sense. Even a category like “Best Community Support” draws ire from fans.
It&#x27;s easy to look at this and say “gamers, am I right?” Except these issues exist across all awards shows. In 2019, Green Book faced scrutiny for winning the Oscar for Best Pic…</span>

After months of waiting, Nintendo shadow-dropped the Kirby&#x27;s Dream Buffet keychain today on the US My Nintendo marketplace. In a separate set of posts, a few more surprises showed up: EarthBound stuff!
Celebrating EarthBound and EarthBound Beginnings (which are on the SNES and NES service for Switch Online respectively) there&#x27;s two things on offer: an EarthBound Beginnings Eight Melodies Notebook, and a Phase Distorter Luggage tag. Nintendo also dropped a Mario-themed 2023 desktop calendar, inline with previous years.
The notebook clocks in at 64 pages, and has &quot;illustrations of characters from the game, and eight pages for composing music.&quot; For 400 Platinum, it&#x27;s one of the fancier notebooks Nintendo has offered on the service to date.
[gallery columns&#x3D;&quot;4&quot; size&#x3D;&quot;medium&quot; ids&#x3D;&quot;355550,355551,355552,355553&quot;]
Here&#x27;s a full recap of everything that arrived on My Nintendo on December 22, 2022, as well as direct links to the merch:
EarthBound Beginnings: Eight Melodies Notebook (400 Platinum Points)
EarthBound Beginnings: Phase Distorter Luggage Tag (400 Platinum Points)
Kirby&#x27;s Dream Buffet Keychain (600 Platinum Points)
My Nintendo 2023 Desktop Calendar (400 Platinum Points)
If you need more My Nintendo Platinum Points now, we have you covered:
As a reminder, if you want physical rewards, you can find our full Platinum Point guide here, which has been updated with details on weekly missions: bookmark it for when you need quick points for a reward. A handful of points is incredibly easy to get, as that’s basically just 15 minutes with Super Mario Run, or a quick sign-on to the 3DS or Wii U 3Shop. Also remember that any shipments are bundled together, so you can pay a flat rate for multiple items instead of paying it each time. Just know that items go out of stock on My Nintendo frequently, and some are never restocked.

                              <span>Just the classics
Today&#x27;s Epic Games Store giveaway is here for a limited time, and it&#x27;s some post-apocalyptic goodness. The original Fallout, as well as its sequel Fallout 2 and Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel are free on Epic, today through December 23.
It&#x27;s all part of Epic&#x27;s holiday game giveaway, which has seen some solid games go up for free on the store. Every day, Epic&#x27;s been rolling out some new free games to give out for the holiday season, ranging from Lego Builder&#x27;s Journey to Bloons TD 6. The 15 Days of free games, running from December 15 through 29, now adds Fallout to the mix.
Fallout and its sequel are easily western RPG classics. While the series has made the jump to 3D, these isometric games hail from the era of PC RPGs with overhead views and immense malleability. They&#x27;re also fantastic, and well-worth looking into if you&#x27;re only familiar with the more recent titles.
Bethesda actually held a special retrospective event earlier this year, commemorating the series and detailing its history as part of its 25th anniversary. You can find one of the earlier episodes, all about the creation of Fallout, in the video below.

A nuclear winter wonderland
If you&#x27;re an Xbox Game Pass subscriber, you already have access to these games. So for those already using the service, today&#x27;s freebie might not seem like much. However, I&#x27;ll argue two points: it&#x27;s a free game, and one that gets added to a separate library. Having a game license in a few places for the low, low price of free isn&#x27;t really a bad thing.
And hey, maybe today&#x27;s freebie is just a push for everyone to pick up and play some Fallout this holiday season. With Starfield set for 2023 and The Elder Scrolls next up on Bethesda&#x27;s docket, it seems like we&#x27;ll be waiting a bit for the next Fallout entry anyways.

Every so often, a game comes around and becomes a phenomenon overnight. Although the Elden Ring beta showed me that future was possible, few could predict just how ubiquitous the From Software juggernaut would become.
After launch, I looked around and basically everyone I knew was playing it. My wife, who only plays action adventure games once every few years, was — and still is — into it. All of her office co-workers were playing it, and several folks who had never Platinumed anything in their lives were going for a full clear. People I hadn&#x27;t spoke to in a while were texting me for tips. It managed to break through like no other From Software game in recent memory: far more than the Bloodborne craze that you couldn&#x27;t escape from for roughly a full year and change.

                              <span>Surely we can do better than this
Final Fantasy, one of the most revered and influential JRPG franchises in history, saw its 35th anniversary a few days ago. Square Enix chose to celebrate the occasion with something fans have wanted for years: PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch ports of the first six numbered games. This is, of course, great. Sure, the games are arriving in their just-okay Pixel Remaster iterations, but even a just-okay version of Final Fantasy IV on Nintendo Switch is a treat.
The not-so-great part came after the big announcement in the form of the Pixel Remaster physical editions. Square Enix elected to release two Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster collections on physical discs and cartridges — a Standard Edition and an Anniversary Edition. Both editions include all six Pixel…</span>

                              <span>MSRP is $60.45
Today, 2K has announced a &quot;Firaxis Tactical Legends special offer&quot; bundle on Steam that includes Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns, on top of XCOM 2 and XCOM: Enemy Unknown. All three games will be available at a &quot;suggested retail price of $60.45,&quot; and there&#x27;s also going to be a &quot;complete the set&quot; offer, so you can &quot;only pay for and receive items that you don&#x27;t already own.&quot;
This offer is live today, and will run through January 2, 2023 (specifically, 9:59 AM PT on that day). The concise phrasing used for this bundle is that they include the &quot;base games,&quot; so keep that in mind.
All of these games are well reviewed
Truth be told this is a pretty great bundle: one of the best I&#x27;ve seen in a long time. It not only involves a newish well received Marvel strategy game, but a good chunk of modern classic gameplay via XCOM. If you pick these up, they&#x27;ll likely last you the entire rest of the month, as you can really dig into them almost indefinitely. Plus, I&#x27;ve replayed XCOM 2 many times since it was released years back, so for most people already invested in the strategy genre, it&#x27;ll pay dividends down the line.
You can check out our own reviews of each core game here!

                              <span>It&#x27;s for Kirby&#x27;s Dream Buffet
[Update: In what is easily one of the longest waits between My Nintendo merch announcements and a release date, Nintendo has released the Kirby&#x27;s Dream Buffet keychain into the wild on December 22, 2022. You can find it here for 600 Platinum Points.]
A My Nintendo Kirby keychain is in the pipeline and will come out in the near future, a new My Nintendo post has revealed.
In typical my Nintendo fashion it&#x27;s only done in passing on a post about the greater Kirby franchise, but we do know the design (pictured here) and that it&#x27;ll be celebrating Kirby&#x27;s Dream Buffet. Typically, this means that the reward is roughly a week out. While there are no keychains currently for sale, they&#x27;ve ranged from 400 to 800 Platinum Points in the past.
If you don&#x27;t want to wait, there&#x27;s a printable (digital file) pop-up card for Kirby&#x27;s Dream Buffet that you can get now. It&#x27;ll cost you 30 Platinum Points. Nintendo also reminds everyone that the recent Kirby 30th anniversary concert is now online, and there&#x27;s a Dream Buffet wallpaper reward available.
As a reminder, if you want physical rewards, you can find our full Platinum Point guide here, which has been updated with details on weekly missions: bookmark it for when you need quick points for a reward. A handful of points is incredibly easy to get, as that’s basically just 15 minutes with Super Mario Run, or a quick sign-on to the 3DS or Wii U 3Shop. Also remember that any shipments are bundled together, so you can pay a flat rate for multiple items instead of paying it each time. Just know that items go out of stock on My Nintendo frequently, and some are never restocked.

                              <span>Dream to the beat, or beat your opponent
The fourth day of Nintendo&#x27;s House of Indies holiday event has arrived, and four more games have been confirmed for the Nintendo Switch. Whether it&#x27;s rocking through your dreams or rocketing the ball into the opponent&#x27;s goal, there&#x27;s a good variety of games here on the penultimate day of indie joy.
First up, the surprise drops. Dreamy rhythm game Melatonin is out today on Nintendo Switch, mixing a gorgeous art style with music specifically designed to flow with the visuals. It&#x27;s a dreamlike Rhythm Heaven, it seems, and I&#x27;ve heard some pretty positive buzz around Half Asleep&#x27;s new game.
But if you want something a little higher octane, Necrosoft&#x27;s Hyper Gunsport hits Nintendo Switch today too. Each team is made up of a keeper and striker, who shoot t…</span>

It&#x27;s a holiday week on the Nintendo eShop, which means that not much is actually coming out this late in the year. Nintendo hasn&#x27;t even opted to feature anything in their weekly mailer, but I decided to make a choice of my own.
After skimming them all, the one that really stands out is Kaiju Wars. Released on Steam in April of 2022, it seems like it&#x27;s a recreation of Into the Breach at first glance, but gameplay tells a different tale. I&#x27;m considering picking it up as a fun holiday game, but I also have plenty to do with the November/early December rush!

Digital Eclipse has released a major update for its tubular anthology TMNT: The Cowabunga Collection — Now available to download on all platforms, the patch features a fistful of highly-requested tweaks across all titles, as well as a fresh round of bug stomps and improved online capabilities.
There are a shelluva lot of changes listed in the official patch notes, with notable examples being PS4 controller support for the PS5 edition, arcade stick support for Xbox platforms, and a selection of four filters for all included Game Boy titles. Additionally, a variety of additional dip switch and option settings have been applied to several titles, while new tips have been added to the in-game strategy guides.

In regard to online connectivity, TMNT IV: Turtles in Time now supports online multiplayer, while a future update will add the same feature to TMNT III: The Manhatten Project. Across the board, improvements have been made to all games&#x27; online stability, while players can setup up lobbies for the two arcade releases, limiting them to two-to-four players as desired. In addition to all of the above, several bugs have been patched out, while fixes have been applied to the collection&#x27;s U.I. and menus.
TMNT: The Cowabunga Collection almost seems too good to be true. Usually, when a collection such as this is put together, red tape and licensing snafus always leave several titles off-grid, but Konami has successfully gathered together all of the most memorable TMNT adventures from arcade, home console, and handheld, packaged together with fun features and online support. With this new update, (and further updates planned), the collection remains an absolute must-buy for any fan of the Heroes in a Half-Shell.
TMNT: The Cowabunga Collection is available now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.

                              <span>It&#x27;s the same deal as ones in the past
Fire Emblem Engage is roughly a month away, and Nintendo is starting to promote it in earnest. Although the announcement kind of came out of nowhere, we&#x27;ve gotten quite a few character trailers up until this point: and now you can act them out in scenes of your choice with acrylic standees. Provided that you win the My Nintendo sweepstakes that was just revealed.
Just like other past sweepstakes, this is how the Fire Emblem Engage one works:
To enter, you just need a My Nintendo account
You can spend up to 30 Platinum Points: 10 points per entry, for a max of three entries
This one ends on February 28, 2023, so you have some time
The reward includes &quot;a set of seven colorful acrylic stands,&quot; featuring &quot;popular characters&quot; from the game. As you m ay have noticed, the suite also includes at least one character from the series in general, like Marth.
Typically Nintendo uses this opportunity to tease a physical reward for the My Nintendo program, but it hasn&#x27;t done so thus far. It&#x27;s uncommon for a major first party game to not get some form of tie-in (even Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes had something), so it&#x27;ll likely be revealed at a later date: possibly around launch.

Nexon has a glut of exciting new info for fans of its highly enjoyable and ultra-aggressive scrapper DNF Duel — Not only is the vaunted &quot;Grand Balance Patch&quot; now live on all platforms, but the publisher has offered a release date for the Nintendo Switch port, and also revealed that multiple new characters will be rolling out across 2023.
The Grand Balance Patch represents the first major update to DNF Duel&#x27;s frenzied and chaotic action, with a flow that favors aggression, flashy combos, and highly extensive damage. The patch hopes to bring some of the characters that were struggling a little — such as Grappler and Inquisitor — in line with some of the online monsters such as Swift Master and Dragon Knight. In addition, the patch offers higher HP …</span>

As the furor continues around Microsoft&#x27;s proposed $68.7 billion purchase of publisher Activision Blizzard, global regulators continue their investigations into the sale and any potential antitrust issues raised by the coming together of two of the most powerful companies in the gaming industry.
The UK&#x27;s Competition and Markets Authority, a British regulatory body looking into the sale, has revealed the results of a public survey held in October, wherein The CMA asked customers whether they were in favor or against the deal being completed. Around 2,600 email responses were recorded, with around three-quarters of the replies being in favor of Microsoft completing its purchase.
Of the 2,600 emails, only 2,100 qualified for the survey, with t…</span>

                              <span>Valve found a hardware winner in the Deck this year
2022 saw gaming shift in a lot of big ways. But amid a clamor of big headlines, Valve managed to work its way into the home console space with the Steam Deck this year. And this one really seems like it&#x27;s going to stick it out.
Valve has had a, let&#x27;s say, interesting record when it comes to home hardware launches. The build-your-own PC nature of the Steam Machine didn&#x27;t really take off, and neither did the Steam Link. Even the Steam Controller, which has its defenders, got lumped in with the successes and failures of Valve&#x27;s work to put a box in the living room.

                              <span>&quot;Surprisingly this is an excellent build&quot;.
Zack Fair&#x27;s story made its Switch debut last week in Crisis Core Final Fantasy VII Reunion, an impressive remaster of the 2007 PSP favourite and prequel to Final Fantasy VII. The game launched on multiple platforms, and many were concerned that the Switch version would suffer thanks to the incredibly detailed visuals.
Leave it to the team at Digital Foundry, however, to break everything down for the Switch version. In their in-depth analysis of all versions of the game. Despite being a &#x27;remaster&#x27;, Crisis Core has been entirely rebuilt in Unreal Engine 4, which is why the action is smoother and the world looks so great.

We&#x27;ve already had one helping of delicious pizza thanks to yesterday&#x27;s Cowabunga Collection update, but the Turtles aren&#x27;t done yet. Dotemu and Tribute Games have released a brand new patch for the outstanding beat &#x27;em up Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder&#x27;s Revenge.
In the patch — which is available to download now on Switch — the toppings are particularly delicious. Us retro-heads here at NL are pretty excited about the new VCR and CRT filters which makes it look like we&#x27;re actually playing the game on a dusty old arcade cabinet, just like the good old days.

Strategy game fans have been eating well on Switch this year. We’ve gotten exciting new releases like Triangle Strategy and Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope; as well as remasters of classics like Tactics Ogre and Front Mission gracing our portable screens. 2023 shows no signs of slowing down, with Fire Emblem Engage hitting in January, as well as some promising third-party releases like Marvel’s Midnight Suns and Metal Slug Tactics, both originally scheduled to hit in 2022 before being hit themselves with the delay stick.
But still our strategy brains aren’t satisfied. So we decided to compile a list of some franchises we think are ripe for a strategy/tactics title. If Mario can make the leap, anyone can! Retro Studios once had a Zelda tactics game on the drawing board, but there are plenty of other series — Nintendo and otherwise — that we think would be perfect candidates for a strategic injection on Switch.

                              <span>Publisher Dotemu and developer Tribute Games are bringing a custom arcade mode, new filters, and more to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder&#x27;s Revenge. 
This news comes by way of a Steam blog post for the game that reveals this new update is available to download right now. It includes a new custom arcade mode, CRT and VCR filters, and additional fixes and changes to the game. 


&quot;The update implements Custom Game options, granting ninjas greater control over their tubular battle against the Foot Clan through 11 mix-and-match modifiers reminiscent of the dip switches found on old school arcade machines,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;Retro-themed filters and an extra large serving of refinements round out the surprise update, which reaches PC, PlayStation, Switch, and Xbox players today.&quot; 
Here is a look at the Custom Game options dip switch board: 
As you can see, it looks like there&#x27;s plenty to mix and match to make each custom arcade session feel unique. If you&#x27;re interested, be sure to boot the game up today and get the update downloading.

                              <span>Santa Monica Studio has announced that God of War Ragnarök, which hit PlayStation consoles last month, is getting a New Game Plus mode in spring. 
This news comes by way of a short and sweet tweet posted today by the studio that says Spring 2023 is when fans can expect the feature to hit Ragnarök. As for what to expect, though, that remains unknown – Santa Monica Studio says it&#x27;ll &quot;share more details once we get closer to the release.&quot; 


While many had hoped Ragnarök would launch with a New Game Plus mode built-in, its arrival after the game&#x27;s release isn&#x27;t surprising. God of War (2018) received its New Game Plus mode after launch as well. For now, we wait until next spring. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer&#x27;s God of War Ragnarök review and then read about how the game&#x27;s director fought to keep its most unexpected and cartoonish character in the game. Check out this story about how Kratos voice actor Christopher Judge originally quit when he learned someone else was directing Ragnarök after that and then read about how Amazon Prime Video has ordered a God of War TV series set during the Norse era.

                              <span>We’re approaching the end of 2022, and we’re concluding the year by going back to our Super Replay roots by tackling an old-school survival horror game. In this case, we’re replaying one of the greatest games of the PS1 era, Silent Hill! Join us live on Twitch today at 3 p.m. Central as we endure two hours of nostalgic, hair-raising scares. If you can’t catch us live, each episode will be available to watch on Saturdays on the Game Informer Shows YouTube channel. 
Episode 1 - The Harry Mason Shuffle
Episode 2- When Doves Cry
Episode 3 - Bible.
Episode 4 - Age Seven, Short, Black Hair


In 1999, Konami put the fear of fog in a generation of players with the release of Silent Hill. The eerie title eschewed the more bombastic horror of its main rival at the time, Resident Evil, in favor of more psychological frights. Protagonist Harry Mason must embark on a terrifying search for his missing daughter, Cheryl, within the eerie town of Silent Hill. What unfolds is a descent into madness that kickstarted a franchise that&#x27;s (finally) returning to the limelight after years of dormancy. Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Kyle Hilliard, as we survive Silent Hill’s debut adventure and see how its scares stack up 23 years later.

                              <span>Ubisoft stopped releasing their games via Steam back in 2019, starting with The Division 2. The Tom Clancy shoot-to-looter was instead released via Ubisoft&#x27;s own digital storefront and via the Epic Games Store. It&#x27;ll finally arrive on Steam next month on January 12th, as part of Ubisoft&#x27;s broader shift back to Valve&#x27;s storefront.

It seemingly already has the scope of the 16-bit games that inspired it, but that doesn&#x27;t mean there aren&#x27;t post-release updates to come. Its developer is now working on a New Game Plus mode.

By contrast, Sail Forth looks more my speed, with its enormous sea creatures, secretive faction of frogs in submarines, and a wind system itd developers claim is &quot;deeply accessible&quot;. It&#x27;s out now and there&#x27;s a launch trailer below.

                              <span>Nope, you don&#x27;t need to get your eyes tested. Alt254 is a minimalist action adventure game that plays out on a small (albeit greatly enlarged) map that measures just 21x26 pixels. In this tiny space, you, a black dot, must venture forth, solving puzzles, deciphering the strange, colourful world around you and piecing together your broken memory along the way. It&#x27;s a very enigmatic little game, but one that&#x27;s instantly charming in its old-school vibes and artfully constructed world. Its soundtrack is a bit of a corker, too.

                              <span>Yesterday, I used my amazing arithmetical reasoning abilities to surmise that there were only eight free games left to come from the Epic Games Store’s Winter Sale giveaway. I was wrong. Don’t look shocked, it happens. Today sees three of the earliest Fallout games being offered up for nothing. They’re Fallout: A Post-Nuclear Role-Playing Game, Fallout 2, and Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood Of Steel. I already own all three elsewhere, as you might well too, but if you don’t then it’s a good way of picking up three classics of 90s PC gaming.

Well, Ubisoft and Capcom have teamed up to make the lives of digital peasants even harder, by shoving some Monster Hunter World themed gubbins into Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla. Have a watch of the trailer below to see just how bizarre this crossover is.

                              <span>Tradition is a transformative power. Often unintentionally, something happens during an event and, if people want, it becomes more than an occurrence, it becomes part of the event. They repeat it, and they share it with other people in their lives and hearts, and the tradition grows. Often the original food/game/gesture/saying/joke/whatever had nothing to do with the event&#x27;s core, and that doesn&#x27;t matter. Sometimes it simply brings joy and feels right. For example, the use of 1956 pop song Green Door in free festive indie game Dracula Cha Cha feels so right that to me, it is a Christmas song. Green Door has run through my head for weeks, and it is once again time for the annual go on Dracula Cha Cha.

                              <span>CD Projekt RED have pushed out another hotfix for The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt’s ever-so-slightly borked next-gen update that was released last week. You can expect some extra stability compared to the previous version of the update, something that’ll always be welcome on my PC. Along with Roach’s early Christmas present of some stabilisers, the hotfix also tackles the annoying bug that caused toxicity to be stuck at max level, along with some minor tweaks to photo mode, and unexplained improvements for The Witcher 3’s performance on Steam Deck.

As far as I can tell, their Sphynx Ampere toiletries do not smell like new graphics cards, so who cares? However! This does make me wonder: which PC gaming smells would you like as a shower gel, perfume, deodorant, aftershave, air freshener, or such? What are the good smells of PC gaming? Which would you eagerly accept as a boxed toiletry set from your aunt this Christmas? I&#x27;ll go first.

Blizzard have released a roadmap for the next year’s worth of shenanigans for the expansion, with new zones, raids, a megadungeon, and profession changes planned. Two major updates, one each scheduled for the first and second halves of the year, will kick off new seasons for Dragonflight.

But given the game&#x27;s subject centres on the depiction of women on film, and their exploitation in the film industry by male creators, it felt appropriate to examine it from the extremely talented femme members of the team. That means not just the star Marissa Marcel herself, played by the award-winning Manon Gage, but other women and non-binary creatives who played different roles in bringing this game to life.

                              <span>Creepy stealth fest Gloomwood snuck into early access a few months ago and made fans of immersive sims look out from under their hoods - but sadly the work-in-progress won&#x27;t let you slip past its city gates. With Gloomwood’s final update for this year, though, you can at least nip in the local tavern now. Only, it seems there’s something pretty nasty dwelling inside its presumably one-star walls. Have a watch of the trailer below, and get us a Guinness and a packet of Golden Wonder from the bar. Ready salted, please.

                              <span>If I were a PC graphics bigwig, choosing which aged game to spruce up with ray tracing as an elaborate mod tools advert, I wouldn’t have gone for one with as timeless an aesthetic as Portal&#x27;s. Maybe that’s why I’m not one – Portal with RTX is a gorgeous return to Aperture Science, a borderline must-play for anyone with a premium GeForce RTX GPU, and a mightily impressive demonstration of the Nvidia RTX Remix tools that built it.
Admittedly, that’s in spite of some shortcomings, including utterly broken performance on even the strongest Radeon RX graphics cards. Equip yourself with RTX hardware, however, and this free mod is a real Christmas treat.

                              <span>Sometimes, I like to daydream about what games could have been like if they’d taken another direction during development. Raising The Bar: Redux is exactly that, a reimagining of Half-Life 2 as though Valve never dropped their original concepts for the sci-fi shooter sequel. The next instalment in the modding project to bring that abandoned game to life, Division 2, is releasing soon. You can watch the fairly hefty trailer for Raising The Bar: Redux: Division 2 below.

                              <span>Super quick, very good card battler Marvel Snap rolls out a new location every week, then boosts it with a 40% likelihood to appear for 48 hours. New, temporarily common locations are a clever way of mixing things up, imposing restraints or possibilities depending on how much you tinker with your decks. 
The latest location, Vormir, is a bit borked. I just spent a minute or so swapping emotes with someone while the game tried to load our (unrelated) animations, which might not sound like much but constitutes a good third of a match&#x27;s normal running time.

That means the skies can be yours for just £10/$15, if you pay for a month. The trial&#x27;s only available until Jan 2nd, though, so best hop on it quick.

Reader, I am telling you this so that you don&#x27;t waste all of them pointlessly knocking on the door like I did, as you are in fact supposed to use them to knock out guards. 
It&#x27;s a procedurally generated game made for 7dfps 2022, a game jam that challenges folks to make an fps game in seven days. Your manor will be different to mine, but the toilets will probably still be silly.

Goat Sim developers Coffee Stain Studios knew this would happen, and they knew people would report on it when it did. I am facilitating shenanigans, and I can hear that damn goat laughing at me from within the black void of its copyright takedown notice.

                              <span>I’m a big fan of life-sim mini-games. Cooking, crafting, mining, gardening, and all those other videogame-y tasks make something that&#x27;s a bit mundane into a fun little treat. It looks like developers Niceplay Games agree, as they’ve taken the joy of tactile crafting and created an entire potion-brewing sim around it - and not only is their crafting system both creative and clever, it&#x27;s oh so satisfying.
We&#x27;ve written about it before, but Potion Craft is out now. You play as an alchemist who has set up shop in an old wizard’s hut, ready to sell your many bubbling brews and concoctions to the locals. People will come by the shop during the day banging on about their problems, so you need to listen to each customer&#x27;s issue, create an appropriate potion to help, and receive a lovely handful of gold in return. It’s essentially a shop management sim, since you make money, buy ingredients, and haggle to get a good deal. But the best part of Potion Craft is all in the title; it&#x27;s getting to grips with the art of potion brewing.

                              <span>Some point-and-click adventures prefer their heroes all comedic and wacky, your Guybrush types. Others are more stoic and action-orientated, such as Indy Jones or Graham of Daventry. Who fits better as an adventure game protagonist than Sherlock Holmes, consulting detective, though? The Lost Files Of Sherlock Holmes: The Case Of The Serrated Scalpel taught me that when I was about eight years old, trying to figure out its mysteries while sitting at my dad’s Amstrad 286 accompanied by my sister Gem. Okay, I was definitely the Watson of that duo.

                              <span>Bricky puzzle game Lego Builder’s Journey is the latest freebie being given away on the Epic Games Store as part of their Christmas sale. Honestly, I did not immediately mistake this for Lego Bricktales, which I’m sure you didn’t either. Builder’s Journey tasks you with solving puzzles by, well, building with Lego. It’s also a bit of a looker, with some snazzy visual accoutrements such as ray tracing and global illumination. You can have a watch of the very pretty Builder’s Journey trailer below.

                              <span>Last time, you decided by a narrow margin that becoming overpowered is better than a chunky manual. With no chunky manual to teach you a game&#x27;s systems, I guess you&#x27;ll be busy experimenting with that for a while. This week, I&#x27;ve had a queer fancy to (for once) make you pick between things which have absolutely no connection. What&#x27;s better: seasonal events, or dynamic snow? I know, it&#x27;s a bit of a silly choice, but hey, it&#x27;s the last week of work before Christmas, let&#x27;s goof off.

                              <span>As you might have noticed, there’s just a few days until Christmas lands on us all like an overladen sleigh pulled by some very exhausted and confused reindeers. Overwatch 2’s marking the occasion by turning robotic damage hero Bastion into a gingerbread automaton with a new legendary skin. Seeing as it’s the holidays, Blizzard are charging just a single Overwatch Coin for the skin, which is way, way less than the thousands that legendaries usually cost. Bastion’s fresh look is also quite a bit more involved than some of the other legendary efforts Blizzard’s dreamt up for Overwatch 2 so far.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been playing Blacktail, ostensibly for review, but with all the seasonal nonsense going on I haven&#x27;t played enough to give you a big wot I think. It&#x27;s worth writing about though, so here I am, doing that. It&#x27;s a weirdo little first-person action-adventure game where you play as the 16-year-old Yaga, who has been run into the forest because the local villagers think she&#x27;s in league with the witch Baba. If you know any European folklore you may have reason to suspect they&#x27;re right.
Yaga&#x27;s childhood friends have all vanished, along with her sister, and the game sends you off to breadcrumb trails around a bright, unreal forest, to find the memories of what happened to the unfortunate kiddies. Along the way you grow in power and skill, using different types of arrows with your bow, as well as lures and spells. I like Blacktail because it&#x27;s a little bit janky in ways that don&#x27;t break the game, and is absolutely committed to its own particular flavour of odd. It&#x27;s the kind of game you used to see a lot in the early-mid 00s, and just don&#x27;t get much anymore.

The low-fi indie developers of the Haunted PS1 community have another Madvent Calendar this year, offering another 24 small horror games and oddities released daily.

A lovely thing, and free!

The arcade holds significance for Nakayama, with ties to his early years on Capcom&#x27;s fighting team.

                              <span>Today&#x27;s Season 5 update is also its last major one
Major support for Chocobo GP is coming to an end. Today, Square Enix confirms that there won&#x27;t be any further large-scale updates to Chocobo GP after the Season 5 update that goes live today, December 21.
What it means by &quot;large-scale&quot; is that major additions, like new characters or maps, will not be arriving in any further updates. Season 5 will also be the last season where prize pass levels are used in the special Chocobo GP mode. The GP mode will still be playable and rankings will continue, without the use of prize pass levels, in the same manner as the current season off period.
Sales of Mythril, a currency for the shop, have also been discontinued on the Nintendo eShop. Players who have Mythril can still spend it, up until the shop disappears on January 6, 2023. The currency is not refundable either.
New items will continue to be added to the shop during the course of Season 5, but the same items may also go into the ticket or gil shops, making them available without Mythril. Items originally added to the Mythril shop during Seasons 1 through 4 &quot;may&quot; also be added to the ticket or gil shops, per Square Enix&#x27;s announcement.

Hitting the brakes
This effectively means Chocobo GP is hitting the brakes on its online support. New characters and maps are coming to a close, the premium currency shop is closing, and it sounds like Season 5 will be the last major one.
It&#x27;s a bummer to see. Chocobo GP didn&#x27;t receive the warmest reception, but my fond memories of Chocobo Racing had me hoping this one would turn things around a bit over time. It looks like that&#x27;s not the case, as the game&#x27;s ending major support within the same calendar year as its launch.

The longest gaming session I have ever had was six straight hours of Cult of the Lamb. This may not be a huge feat for many of you, but I am in shock that for six hours, I didn&#x27;t drink water, eat food, or even use the bathroom. My entire day flew by while I gathered followers and tended my garden.
Was it fun? Yeah. My camp looks really good, and I sacrificed my first dissenter. But my neck hurt after, and I was jittery like there were bees in my brain. I can&#x27;t even imagine the dedication it took for the first player to achieve max renown in World of Warcraft: Dragonflight.

The latest Pokémon game is out in the wild, and players have been exploring the new region of Paldea. As it so happens, some of the tunes playing while they roam around this Pokémon world were penned by Toby Fox, the creator of Undertale.
Fox announced he&#x27;d be working on Scarlet and Violet&#x27;s soundtrack before the game&#x27;s release. Now, Fox has shared his exact contributions in a newsletter mailing list that he spun up for fans of Undertale and Deltarune. (Destructoid has received a copy of this because yes, I would like to receive news about Undertale and Deltarune.)
In it, the developer writes that he had the honor of making a few songs for the game. These include the tracks &quot;Tera Raid Battles&quot;, the &quot;Academy Ace Tournament&quot;, …</span>

                              <span>Underwater citybuilder Aquatico will submerge players on January 12th, 2023. This new release date comes a little more than a month after its release was set for January 19th, but I won&#x27;t look a gift seahorse in the mouth. There&#x27;s also a new trailer below which breaks down how you&#x27;ll build your very own Rapture equivalent.

                              <span>The cat game reigned supreme in 2022, but there&#x27;s a chance 2023 could be the year of the gecko game. That&#x27;s how I feel after watching the trailer for The Gecko Gods, at least. It&#x27;s an action adventure in which you control a cute little lizard who can crawl across walls and ceilings, and also solves puzzles, fights golems and pilots a boat.

                              <span>Wolfenstein: The New Order rebooted the classic FPS series back in 2014, turning it into a tonally incoherent, ultra-violent sometime-stealth &#x27;em up about murdering robo-Nazis in an alternate 1960s. It was surprisingly great. It&#x27;s also free to keep if you grab it from the Epic Games Store right now.

There was also the promise that Hopoo and Gearbox were working on one remaining Risk Of Rain project together, however.

It was announced today: Risk Of Rain Returns, a remaster of the 2013 2D roguelike with all new pixel art, new survivors and new everything else.

The weighty Dungeons &amp; Dragons fantasy RPG has been in early access for a couple of years, but it&#x27;s now scheduled for a 1.0 release in August next year. As well as that, BG3 got its ninth update, the last significant one before release, which raises the level cap to 5 and adds Paladin as a playable class. I caught up with Larian&#x27;s founder and director Swen Vincke (this time sans full suit of armour) and he told me that, despite Update 9 being a big one, there&#x27;s still a lot to come.

                              <span>If I were only allowed to give a single, solitary reason for trying Control, I’d probably settle on this: it has the most satisfying “throw desk at face” interaction I’ve experienced in a game. Yes, even more so than Half-Life 2. Maybe it’s the slower flying speed of the desk, giving you more time to anticipate the blow. Maybe it’s the recoil of the face. Or maybe it’s just how the desk, or whichever piece of office fixture you’re telekinetically hurling, impacts in a hilarious explosion of shards and scraps.

From the snippets Sloclap have shown, the update will have a new arenas mode that seems to be similar to combat challenge maps from the Arkham series. A new patch, 1.16, has also gone live for Sifu today to duff up some pesky crashes and bugs, although patch notes haven’t been released yet. You can watch the teaser for the arenas mode update below.

It’s the Director’s Cut too, which adds some more stuff for nosey American tourist George ‘Goat-wrangler’ Stobbart and French journalist Nico ‘Curtains’ Collard to investigate. Good grief, I can’t even remember the last time I played a Broken Sword. The first one is a classic adventure game from a time when they were beginning to fade from PC, goat puzzle notwithstanding.

                              <span>Shipmas arrives in Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 tomorrow, with the game’s Christmas update for multiplayer. The reimagined version of the classic Shipment map - introduced with last week’s Season 01 Reloaded midseason update - will be festooned with decorations, along with the bodies of your enemies. COD now has its own Santa, too, and I wouldn’t want to tangle with him. You can see what I mean, and catch a glimpse of the holiday version of Shipment, by watching the trailer below.

                              <span>The skeleton-smashing and lock-picking action of first-person dungeon-crawlers combines with the PvPvE tension of Escape From Tarkov in Dark And Darker, which currently has a free alpha playtest running. Alone or with a party of pals, you head into dungeons to mash AI-controlled monsters and fill your pockets with loot. Other players are out there doing the same, and might come to claim your goodies, especially as you&#x27;re all competing for the limited escape portals that let you keep your shinies. It&#x27;s an interesting one, and doing well on both Steam and Twitch.

If you open the door wrong you could cause a huge explosion that kills you - but to mitigate that risk you can spend money buying an Official Safe Door Opener. Don&#x27;t worry, you can just work more to pay it off.

LucasArts shooter Star Wars: Dark Forces has been given a modern makeover by The Force Engine project, and they’ve just released version 1.0 to the public after three years&#x27; work. During that time, the team’s reverse engineered Dark Forces and added a whole bunch of mod-cons, such as support for modern high resolutions and mouse-look. The project even has a trailer, which you can watch below.

                              <span>Hello, yes, I know this is our fourth post on the subject but it’s mostly good news – The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt’s next-gen update is now considerably less of a technical muddle. After applying yesterday’s PC hotfix, performance with the new ray tracing settings is majorly improved, and if you don’t (or can’t) use those, The Witcher 3 no longer runs slower than it did before the next-gen update hobbled it. 


That’s judging by some tests I’ve run using the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070, on which overall stability seems to have improved as well. I’m still having trouble with AMD graphics cards, however, with FSR upscaling being a particularly reliable source of crashes.

                              <span>&quot;Do not be afraid to die.&quot; That&#x27;s the advice of Haemimont Games&#x27; CEO Bisser Dyankov when it comes to playing their new open world survival sim Stranded: Alien Dawn. Having launched into early access in mid-October, the latest game from the Surviving Mars devs has just recently doubled in size to include a brand-new desert biome in its Dunes And Moons update, adding harsh temperature extremes to deal with, new alien lifeforms to observe, and, you know, just the odd Chaos Moon to endure while you&#x27;re at it. 
The world of Desertum is certainly a marked change from Stranded&#x27;s initial mountainous forest planet, Sobrius, but after a few weeks of trying (and inevitably failing) to stay alive in them, I do feel like I&#x27;ve settled on a couple of vital dos and don&#x27;ts now. For example, Do: invest in defences early on. Don&#x27;t: eat that weird alien zebra camel until you know whether it&#x27;s going to give you gut rot. The list goes on, and has only grown larger with the addition of Desertum, which was deliberately designed to &quot;challenge players to plan better and not rely on their previous knowledge,&quot; Dyankov tells me. &quot;Our aim here has been to find a balance between the familiar and unfamiliar within the Desertum Biome, to ensure it&#x27;s a challenging place to build your base, but is also enjoyable.&quot; I&#x27;ll try to remember that the next time horned dinosaurs are gnawing my survivors&#x27; legs off.

Described as an “end of time adventure gacha puzzle apocalypse visual novel simulation horror trip”, Roman Sands RE:Build hails from the devs behind horror game Paratopic. It’s got a vaguely vaporwave sensibility that reminds me a smidge of Paradise Killer. Watch the trailer for Roman Sands RE:Build below, and please explain to me if you understand what’s going on.

                              <span>After reaching consensus that isolated actions are ineffective in the fight against online piracy, around 20 companies, regulators, and government representatives have signed an agreement to form a new global anti-piracy coalition. Global Anti-Piracy Pact lists pirate IPTV as a key issue, noting that pirates today are &quot;extremely dynamic&quot; criminal organizations.

                              <span>Hundreds of thousands of pirating BitTorrent users have been sued over the years. These cases rarely ever make it all the way to trial but, in a Florida court, this is about to happen. Before the trial starts, however, several outstanding issues have to be decided, including the use of the term &quot;copyright troll&quot; before the jury.

                              <span>2013’s Risk of Rain is getting an enhanced remake, and it’s coming next year to celebrate its 10th birthday. Titled Risk of Rain Returns, it spruces up the original with improved art, new survivors, and more.
Announced during Nintendo’s House of Indies: Holiday Event Day 2 today, Risk of Rain Returns expands upon the first game while applying the lessons and improvements of Risk of Rain 2. Although Returns does not adopt the sequel&#x27;s 3D art direction, it features new HD pixel art, balancing tweaks, and new music tracks from composer Chris Christodoulou. It also has improved multiplayer, with other content updates to be shared in the future. Check out the animated announcement trailer below. 


In a press release, Hopoo Games co-founder Duncan Drummond says that, “As we chart our future as developers, it was important to us that we look back on our early work. Risk of Rain Returns is a small token of our appreciation to this incredible community. We hope everyone is as excited about the future as we are.” While still developed by Hopoo, Risk of Rain Returns will be published by Gearbox. 
Risk of Rain Returns will be available on Switch and PC. To learn more, check out our review for the original Risk of Rain here. Be sure to also visit our evolving list of upcoming video game remakes.</span>

                              <span>The tough-as-nails martial arts brawler Sifu is migrating to Xbox platforms and Steam sometime in March. Not only that, but the game is receiving a big content update free to all players.
This update is called Arenas, and as the name suggests, it adds nine new maps that feature combat challenges. Overcoming these missions unlocks new modifiers that introduce alternative combat moves, cheats, and outfits. Arenas also arrives in March and serves as the latest addition in a roadmap of seasonal post-launch updates that have bolstered the title with more cosmetics, cheats, difficulty settings, and even a replay editor. 


Sifu is now available on PlayStation consoles, Switch, and PC via the Epic Game Store. You can read our review of the game here.</span>

Many have been anticipating this long-awaited sequel since its original reveal back in 2014, just a few years following the franchise&#x27;s start. That&#x27;s why I went to Nottingham, England, to go hands-on with the game for more than seven hours. And soon, you can read everything I learned because Dead Island 2 bloodies up this month&#x27;s cover of Game Informer. 
Game Informer video editor Alex Van Aken and I visited Dambuster Studios in Nottingham to play two extensive portions of Dead Island 2, talk with the game&#x27;s director about its development and why the team started with a blank slate, learn from the narrative lead about why a game with &quot;island&quot; in its name is set in…</span>

The sequel to Star Wars: Fallen Order, Star Wars: Jedi Survivor, was announced some time ago, but developer Respawn Entertainment has remained mostly silent on what to expect. That changed earlier this month when a new gameplay trailer pulled the veil back on several new gameplay features, not to mention an impending March release date. We followed up with game director Stig Asmussen to learn more details about the anticipated title.
One of the most notable additions is the arrival of several new fighting stances for Cal Kestis as he goes into battle. “We have five fully realized stanc…</span>

It&#x27;s a first-person factory-building game set in an alien cavern complex with pretty bioluminescent plants. I am excited to lose dozens or hundreds of hours to it when it launches on early access.

                              <span>Riot Games are attempting to get out of a silly sponsorship deal they made last year with now defunct crypto exchange company FTX. The deal involved FTX paying many millions of dollars to League Of Legends developers Riot, who have only received $6.25 million of the $12.5 million FTX were supposed to cough up in 2022. This is on account of FTX being a) bankrupt and b) formerly lead by Sam Bankman-Fried, who was arrested last week in The Bahamas. It is hard not to LoL.

I’m still very happy with the 4K gaming monitor I got for a pittance, and have spent the past twelve months becoming increasingly convinced that tenkeyless keyboards are, in fact, the best keyboards.


That’s just me, though. On an everyone’s-invited macro level, 2022 ended up being the most transformative year for PC gaming kit in recent memory. We’ve had it all: long overdue launches, bitter disappointments, and genuinely impactful performance innovations. Also, Valve made a handheld PC. That was cool.

Duelyst the first boasted a dead clever combination of card-battling and physical manoeuvring, a bit like Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns but better and multiplayer. I was sad when it died. This is by a different team of developers, and it&#x27;s more of a revival with a few tweaks than a true sequel. Who cares, I can play Duelyst again.

                              <span>I love a courtroom visual novel and after dealing with the wonderful nonsense of the Ace Attorney and Danganronpa series, I barely batted an eyelid at Aviary Attorney’s schtick of playing as a bird-brained lawyer (who is literally a bird). At first glance, it seems kinda gimmicky, but this short visual novel has a special flair for melodrama that can turn a boring, stuffy courtroom into a theatre of drama and spectacle (plus some lavish visuals to boot).
The setting is 1840s France, a time when Paris is on the brink of revolution against the (literal) fat cats. You play as the dapper defence attorney Jayjay Falcon who alongside his witty lackey Sparrowson take on four seemingly unrelated cases. Travelling around Paris, you collect evidence and interview witnesses then present your findings in the courtroom and bring justice to your client.

                              <span>Fortnite developer Epic Games is settling two complaints made to the US Federal Trade Commission by paying out a total of more than half a billion dollars. Wall Street Journal report that the FTC alleged Epic had violated protections intended to secure children’s privacy, and tactically drove players to make unintended purchases that amounted to hundreds of millions of dollars. The company are now settling for $520 million (£427 million).


A federal court case claimed that Epic breached the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) by collecting details about Fortnite players who were younger than 13 years old without getting parental consent or contacting their parents. That’s been settled for $275 million. The complaint also alleged Epic illegally enabled real-time voice and text chat for young players as Fortnite’s default, which the FTC said put them at risk from strangers.

                              <span>After all these years of going fast, it would appear that Sonic (T. Hedgehog) has finally arrived. He’s thrown off the shackles of individuality and joined the open-world herd with Sonic Frontiers, a game that sees the blue blur himself canter and gambol across primarily barren environments that closely resemble the default assets that ship with certain game engines. Do I seem embittered? Perish the thought. I’m happy for Sonic, honestly. He’s made it. He’s on top of the world right now, getting review scores he never could have dreamed of since the salad days of the Mega Drive. A Metacritic in the 70s! He may as well have been kissed on the nips by Jesus Christ himself.

Custom controller maker Super Louis 64’s done just that, crafting a Buster Sword that lets him play through Final Fantasy 7 Remake in true Cloud style. When he shared a clip of his antics on Twitter, Super Louis insisted the whole game is playable using the big knife. The honorary Soldier says he’s hoping to have a full video of his time spent pretending to be Cloud up on his YouTube channel today.

                              <span>Microsoft may be considering a lower-priced tier of their Game Pass service, with a few adjustments from the current standard options. A Spanish-language survey shared on ResetEra has allegedly shown the company asking current subscribers whether they’d be up for cheaper Game Pass for PC and console, if that reduction came with a delay for first-party games or running ads. It’s worth taking this with a heavy pinch of salt though, as there’s no confirmed source to the survey.

                              <span>Sandy hoverbike-riding climb ‘em up Sable’s being given away for free on the Epic Games Store up until 4pm GMT on December 19th. That’s today, if you’ve not checked your advent calendar yet. This one’s got my attention because I’m a sucker for a fishing minigame, something Sable added in a free update just last month. It’s also a relatively peaceful game to add to your pile ahead of the beckoning wintertide break, thanks to the complete lack of combat. John Lennon would be chuffed.

People who share their Netflix, Amazon Prime, or Disney+ passwords are violators of copyright law. And it gets worse. The IPO informs TorrentFreak that password sharing could also mean criminal liability for fraud.

The domains in question were used by sites targeted in a similar action a week earlier. This triggered a game of whack-a-mole that&#x27;s not over yet. Meanwhile, other sites are being targeted, including the popular Soccerstreams portal.

                              <span>Square Enix announced its Final Fantasy pixel remasters of the series&#x27; first six games in June of last year, and over the course of roughly eight months, each of those remasters hit PC platforms. Fans have been waiting since that announcement for the reveal of console versions of these remasters and finally, Square Enix has revealed that all six are coming to PlayStation and Switch next year. 
More specifically, these pixel remasters will hit PlayStation 4 and Switch sometime in the spring of 2023. Each of these games can be purchased individually or together as a bundle, and a limited physical edition will also be available on the same day. Here&#x27;s a look at what to expect in the Final Fantasy I-VI Pixel Remaster: FF 35th Anniversary Edition: 
Final Fantasy I-VI Collection - physical collection of all games for either PS4 or Nintendo Switch
Anniversary Edition goods box
A bonus lenticular sleeve for the game package
2-disc vinyl record set featuring newly arranged game music with exclusive cover artwork by Kazuko Shibuya
A specially compiled artbook showcasing beautiful character pixel art 
Eight stylized pixel art character figures in window packaging
This edition of the game is available exclusively on the Square Enix Store and its first batch is already sold out (although you can join a waiting list here)
The company says a &quot;small run of physical standard editions [of the collection] will also be available exclusively from the Square Enix Store from Spring 2023,&quot; but notes that quantities will be &quot;extremely limited&quot; so if you&#x27;re interested, you should preorder. 
For more information about each of these pixel remasters, head to Square Enix&#x27;s blog post. Check out our ranking of every mainline Final Fantasy game to find out where Final Fantasy I-VI land on our list after that.

It&#x27;s a Metroidvania shmup in which you fly about, blast enemies with guns, and cast spells from a deck of cards. For all the bang and zip of the combat, it&#x27;s also deeply cosy, with lush 2D art and sweet character relationships in an underground post-apocalyptic world that&#x27;s still somehow filled with plants, rustic cabins and cute market stalls. There&#x27;s a free demo to play now.

It turns out the standalone expansion I needed was a son. He&#x27;s six years in development and today I introduced him to a private Minecraft multiplayer server for the first time. Exploring, building, and the vibes are all as wonderful as I remember.

                              <span>The Z-Library crackdown has resulted in some unusual takedown notices that have little to do with authors or publishers. Knockoff sites such as Zlibrary.to and Zlib.is appear to be most interested in protecting their newly gained popularity. At the same time, a publication that wrote about Z-Library alternatives is going after sites that copied its article.

                              <span>Valve have announced that the Steam Winter Sale will begin next week on December 22nd. I can already see myself standing in front of my mirror, chanting &quot;I do not need more games&quot; before sitting back down at my desk and splurging on everything I missed from this year&#x27;s RPS advent calendar. 
Valve have given us a peek at what&#x27;s going to be on sale, so click through to see what you should avoid buying until it starts.

                              <span>All the flap about World Of Warcraft: Dragonflight has made it easier than ever to forget there&#x27;s a whole New World out there, but there is, and it&#x27;s temporarily free. You can jump into the frontier of Amazon Games vaguely piratical MMO without paying a penny this weekend, where you&#x27;re free to lark about until December 19th. Has the recent early game overhaul alleviated the opening grind? Perhaps!

                              <span>I can&#x27;t think of a better place for turn-based fights than in the margins of medieval manuscripts. There&#x27;s a wealth of weirdness to draw on, and Inkulinati seems admirably willing to dip its quill into messed-up cats and donkeys playing double-ended trumpets. We&#x27;ve been waiting a while for it, but we&#x27;ll only have to wait a little longer, as developers Yaza Games have just announced they&#x27;ll be launching on Steam Early Access on January 31st.
They&#x27;ve also sketched out a new demo to tide us over, and I&#x27;ve enjoyed my little poke at it.

It&#x27;s the most magical time of the year, especially now that charming co-op shooter Deep Rock Galactic has launched its annual Yuletide Elf Hunt. It&#x27;s time to dress up your dwarves, grab your pickaxes, and get back to hauling rocks for an oppressive corporation. There&#x27;s double XP in it for you.

                              <span>As has seemingly become a yearly tradition in my gaming calendar, I have ended up finishing 2022 in much the same way I finished 2021: reviewing yet another Final Fantasy VII game. Last year, it was the PC release of Final Fantasy VII Remake, this year it&#x27;s Crisis Core - Final Fantasy VII - Reunion, a remaster of the original game&#x27;s PSP prequel. As such, I&#x27;ve been thinking a lot about Final Fantasy VII these last few weeks, and playing them so close together has ended up highlighting one key thing for me. Namely, that story chapters that break up the action by giving players some &#x27;downtime&#x27; to &#x27;hang&#x27; with your party pals, either by doing side or fetch quests for them MUST DIE. 
Drop a meteor on them or let them go the way of Aerith and be skewered into oblivion, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, because please, Square Enix, I simply cannot with the interminable sidequest chapters any more.

                              <span>The universe that began with Horizon Zero Dawn is expanding, with devs Guerrilla Games confirming that they’re working on a new single-player games for Aloy, and a separate &quot;Online Project&quot; set in the same universe. Announced in a tweet today, it confirms previous rumours that Guerrilla were working on an online multiplayer Horizon game, and a recent batch of job listings for the project have given us a glimpse of what we might be able to expect once it&#x27;s ready.

                              <span>Two months after leaving early access, Vampire Survivors yesterday launched its first paid expansion. Its name is Legacy Of The Moonspell, and it adds a new map along with new characters and enemies and weapons, all inspired by Japanese folkore (including a variety of yokai and oni). For a mere £1.50, it is perfect. Do you like Vampire Survivors and want more? Buddy, it&#x27;s right here.

I&#x27;ll talk a bit about how Wavetale does it, but the first one is obvious within a few minutes, because if you&#x27;re anything like me you&#x27;ll be ignoring the danger your family is in to slide around with your newfound powers going &quot;wheeee!&quot;.
Very quickly, you see, you gain the ability to not just walk on water, but run up a little and you&#x27;ll start power sliding freely around. Hold the jump button and you even charge up a big boosted power charge. Jump off the land and press sprint and you&#x27;ll dive, briefly powering through the water before smashing out again. It is delightful.

                              <span>The NZXT H510 Elite is a rather excellent mid-size case, offering beautiful visuals courtesy of its glass-heavy design and an easy build experience thanks to the company&#x27;s long-ass history of case-building. The H510 Elite also comes with a controller for its integrated RGB lighting, so you can easily plug in other NZXT gubbins for a pretty sweet setup. 
Anyway, why am I bringing this up? Of course, it&#x27;s because the case is discounted on Amazon US, where it&#x27;s been reduced to $79.99, exactly 50% off its $159.99 MSRP. Given that the case has been selling for $145 or higher outside of Black Friday, when it dipped to $100, this is a pretty awesome deal!

                              <span>When I previewed High On Life at Gamescom earlier this year, I came away with a little skip in my step. Justin Roiland and Squanch Games might be on to a winner, I thought. The talking alien guns weren&#x27;t that irritating and the gun fights seemed solid! And it appealed to my juvenile sense of humour too. Poo and wee? Yeah, you&#x27;ll get a cheap chuckle from me. I understood then that it might not be for everyone, but hey, I can roll with that if the FPS bit is good.
Having now spent a few hours with the final game, I&#x27;ve concluded that my mind must&#x27;ve been chemically altered by the doner kebab I consumed the night before. You can switch off your gun&#x27;s verbal diarrhea through the in-game menu, but what you&#x27;ll find behind the brown curtain is a very unimaginative shooter. For a world so colourful and zaney, it&#x27;s a shame the FPS side can&#x27;t match it.

                              <span>Nothing beats the audio design of Star Wars: Jedi Knight - Dark Forces II. You know when you look at a light for too long and then close your eyes, and you see an imprint of the light against your retinas? The sound of an elevator in Dark Forces II is similarly burned into my memory, whether I like it or not. As is the excellent &quot;EUURRYAAAARRGH!&quot; death-cry that protagonist Kyle Katarn makes as he takes one blaster bolt too many and collapses onto the ground.

It&#x27;s by developer Paul Schnepf, who made minimalist skateboarding game The Ramp and worked on the lovely yet much more goal-oriented Islanders. The Block is just about making something nice-lookin&#x27;. It&#x27;s out now, and cheap as chips.

                              <span>We all know that Hideo Kojima’s a big fan of the film industry, and that many of his games feature big Hollywood talent and have verged on movie-length cutscenes at times. I can’t say it’s a surprise, then, that Death Stranding, which just had its sequel confirmed at The Game Awards last week, is being adapted for film. Kojima Productions are working with production company Hammerstone Studios to bring the BB Boys&#x27; post-apocalyptic hiking trip to life.

                              <span>Remember the Steam controller? It was kind of like the Neanderthal to the Steam Deck’s Homo sapiens, existing for a brief few years before being discontinued back in 2019. Steam Controllers were an unusual evolutionary offshoot of the by-then fairly standardised controller layout, with funky clickable trackpads taking the place of thumbsticks. Well, Valve’s designers seem to be up for reviving the concept in some form. At least, that’s what they’ve told The Verge in an interview about the Steam Deck’s first nine months.

Metzen had retired back in 2016 after decades of working on Warcraft and Blizzard’s other games. The return was shared by Warcraft general manager Jon Hight in a statement posted to Twitter, which confirmed that Metzen will initially return to the company to work on the long-running World Of Warcraft. It’s expected that Metzen will follow that up by moving onto other connected projects.

                              <span>After 25 years, the latest season of the Pokémon anime saw protagonist Ash Ketchum finally achieve his dream of becoming Pokémon World Champion. Now that he’s reached the top of the mountain, the series is giving the perpetually young hero his last hurrah before kicking off a fresh adventure starring a new cast of characters.


The Pokémon Company announced that beginning January 13 (in Japan), Ash and Pikachu’s final chapter begins. It consists of 11 special episodes serving as a grand send-off celebrating the duo&#x27;s achievements. It also features some familiar faces from Ash’s past, including Misty and Brock.
Sometime later in the year, a new yet-to-be-titled animated series set in Scarlet/Violet’s Paldea region kicks offs. It stars two young trainers, Liko and Roy, joined by the three starters of that region: Sprigatito, Fuecoco, and Quaxly. The trailer also teases the appearance of a shiny Rayquaza.
So this is it. If you spent your childhood following Ash&#x27;s exploits or have stuck with him for his entire run, how does it feel to finally see the character get his flowers and ride off into the sunset? Are you looking forward to finally seeing a series starring new heroes and storylines? Let us know in the comments!</span>

                              <span>Fortnite is crossing over with another big anime. This time, the saviors of My Hero Academia join the fight. Beginning today, you can rack up victory royales as characters from the hit series, compete in a new game mode, and earn rewards by completing special challenges. 


You can purchase outfits for Izuka Midoriya, All Might, Katsuki Bakugo, and Ochaco Uraraka. Each comes with a matching back bling and pickaxe. New items include the Deku’s Smash item, which allows players to pummel opponents and structures by challenging the power of One for All. You can also pick up two new emotes: Symbol of Peace and Hero Analysis. All Might will also be showering the battlefield with loot-filled supply drops. 
You can sharpen your superhero skills at the Hero Training Gym. This new Creative mode lets players select one of three classes to face other players in team battles. You’ll earn Rescue Points for your squad by eliminating players or capturing Rescue Zones that pop up in the arena. The first team to earn 100 points wins the challenge. 
Completing limited-time My Hero Academia quests earns XP and special items in either battle royale mode or the Hero Training Gym. These missions are:
Complete the “Assist in Eliminating Opponents on the Hero Training Gym island” Quest to earn the Deku Spray.
Complete the “Secure Rescue Points on the Hero Training Gym island” Quest to earn the Plus Ultra Spray.
Complete a total of four My Hero Academia Quests to earn the Deku’s Glove Emoticon.
Complete a total of eight My Hero Academia Quests to earn the U.A. Cape Back Bling.

Soccer Story is a charming role-playing adventure that seamlessly builds a joyous and often goofy story around something as simple as kicking a ball. A cataclysmic event causes soccer to be banned unless sanctioned by the evil Soccer Inc. (with more than a few parallels to real-world FIFA), and our young hero’s father goes missing during the catastrophe. A year later, a magical soccer ball comes crashing into our hero’s life. What comes next is an often silly and fun story about bringing soccer back to the world, filled w…</span>

                              <span>PlayStation has revealed that Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2 will hit PlayStation 5 sometime next fall. 
This news comes after leaks from earlier this week indicating the game would be hitting the console in the fall of 2023. It seems those leaks were correct. While we do have this fall 2023 release window, PlayStation did not reveal a release date. 


&quot;What a year it&#x27;s been for PlayStation Studios; here at Insomniac Games we&#x27;ve been in absolute awe of the work of our peers,&quot; Insomniac Games creative director Bryan Intihar writes in a PlayStation Blog post. &quot;Congrats to everyone on a successful 2022... and here&#x27;s to next year being just as exciting as we continue to get Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2 ready for release next fall.&quot; 
Not much else was revealed about this upcoming sequel, but PlayStation says, &quot;Following the events of Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man and Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man: Miles Morales, the Spider-duo of Peter Parker and Miles Morales are back in the next blockbuster action chapter of the Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man series.&quot; 


The rest of the PlayStation Blog post details other upcoming titles, like Hogwarts Legacy, which had a gameplay showcase yesterday, Forspoken, which I previewed last week, and Final Fantasy XVI. Head there for additional details about these games and more. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer&#x27;s Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man review and then check out our review of Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man Miles Morales.

In April, Crystal Dynamics revealed that it was developing the next Tomb Raider game in its series that began with a reboot back in 2013. They did so during the State of Unreal 2022 presentation, revealing that this Tomb Raider sequel – the fourth in this rebooted series – will be built on Unreal Engine 5. Now, Crystal Dynamics has announced that Amazon Games will publish this sequel.

                              <span>Two months ago, Studio MDHR announced a physical retail edition of its smash hit Cuphead. The charming trailer features physical puppets of Cuphead and his friends out on the high seas, searching for sunken treasure. What they find is news of a physical and collector&#x27;s edition of Cuphead. The cute trailer runs at just around a minute long, but the set and puppet designs are intricate, making you wonder just how much work went into creating the trailer.
Today, the studio released a behind-the-scenes look at how its retail partner iam8bit created the sets and puppets of that trailer. You can get a look at the team building and shooting it in the video below.

                              <span>A new PlayStation Blog post highlights six new PlayStation VR2 titles coming from various Japanese developers, including a sequel to the 2000 PlayStation 2 rhythm game, Fantavision. 
Other games announced include action game Altair Breaker, rhythm game Kizuna AI – Touch the Beat!, and more. We&#x27;ll break down what PlayStation has to say about each of these six new titles below. 
Fantavision 202X
Fantavision is a puzzle-rhythm game released on the PS2 in 2000 and it&#x27;s somewhat of a cult classic. The series has remained dormant since that original release, but developer Cosmo Machia Inc. is bringing it to this decade with a brand new sequel called Fantavision 202X.

                              <span>Resident Evil Village&#x27;s VR mode will hit PlayStation VR2 the day it launches, February 22, and it will be available as free DLC to anyone who owns Village on PlayStation 5. Those who own the Gold Edition of Village will get it for free, as well. 
You will need, however, the $549.99 PSVR2 hardware in order to check out this new mode for Village, as its name suggests. The VR mode isn&#x27;t just a slice of Village; you can play through the entire campaign in this new (probably horrifying) way. And you can do so the day you bring home your PSVR2 system. 


&quot;A deeper and more captivating adventure awaits with PlayStation VR2, as Ethan Winters&#x27; journey takes full advantage of the headset&#x27;s advanced features,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;VR Mode utilizes the 4K HDR display, eye tracking, and 3D audio to make Resident Evil Village more realistic and intense than ever.&quot;
Capcom says the platform&#x27;s PSVR2 Sense controllers will add even more immersion to the new mode. 
&quot;These [controllers] represent Ethan&#x27;s famously resilient hands and allow intuitive actions to be performed in-game,&quot; Capcom writes in a press release. &quot;Players can hold up their arms to guard against enemies that get too close for comfort. Weapons all feel tangibly more realistic in VR Mode with new gameplay elements that dial up the immersion, such as dual wielding and natural motion controls for reloading firearms and brandishing knives.&quot;

The plaintiffs claim the ISP turned a blind eye to pirating subscribers responsible for millions of infringements. The lawsuit lists thousands of songs and could be worth over a billion dollars in damages.

                              <span>Driller aka Space Station Oblivion (in the US), the FIRST supported game of the Freescape engine, is ready for public testing!
Published in 1987 by Incentive Software Limited, this revolutionary new engine allowed players to explore a solid 3D graphic environment with complete freedom of movement for the very first time in videogame history. 
A new threat emerges after humanity abandoned a dying Earth to establish a new home on planet Evath. Evath&#x27;s moon Mitral has turned into a gigantic gas time bomb. A meteor is also due to impact Mitral in the next several hours. You were chosen to secure each of Mitral&#x27;s 18 sectors by positioning a drilling rig over the gas pockets in each sector before the meteor strikes.
Solve challenging riddles by relying on geological clues, intuition, or good old trial and error. To survive your mission, find Rubicon crystals to restore energy and destroy (or avoid) the Laser Beacons and Skanners left behind by the Ketars. Good luck!
Our reimplemented engine features graphics using software (TinyGL) or hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Driller support is limited to DOS (EGA mode), Amiga and AtariST releases, but we hope to be able to add more soon! Please contact us if you have some other release.
To play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.

The reason is the company wants to, in its own words, “move to solely support Epic Online Services with its unified friends system, voice chat features, parental controls, and parental verification features.” 
Epic states that by January 24, the following titles no longer be playable online (albeit with some caveats, which are noted). Epic has also started removing these titles from digital storefronts and will disable DLC purchases. Most of these games can still be played offline if you own them. The list of affected games are:

                              <span>Mega Man, Lan, and the whole NT crew are making their return via the Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection on April 4.


The bundle includes remastered ports of the 10 Game Boy Advance titles divided from the first six entries, such as:
Mega Man Battle Network
Mega Man Battle Network 2
Mega Man Battle Network 3 White
Mega Man Battle Network 3 Blue
Mega Man Battle Network 4 Red Sun
Mega Man Battle Network 4 Blue Moon
Mega Man Battle Network 5 Team Protoman
Mega Man Battle Network 5 Team Colonel
Mega Man Battle Network 6 Cybeast Gregar
Mega Man Battle Network 6 Cybeast Falzar
You can play these games solo or challenge other players in online matches. Legacy Collection even tosses in previously exclusive Battle Chips, such as those offered at Japanese promotional events. The collection also includes an optional high-resolution filter for each title, and museum features include over 1,000 pieces of artwork and nearly 200 music tracks. 
As an added bonus, Capcom announced plans to stream Seasons 1 and 2 of Mega Man NT Warrior, the anime that the Battle Network series is based on, on its Twitch channel early next year. The episodes will also be available to watch for free on Capcom’s YouTube page. 
Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection will be available on PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC.</span>

                              <span>In this special travel vlog, Game Informer&#x27;s Alex Van Aken and Brian Shea tour Super Nintendo World while visiting Osaka, Japan. The pair show off everything the park offers, including Peach&#x27;s Castle, Bowser&#x27;s Castle, Toad&#x27;s Cafe, Yoshi&#x27;s Adventure, and a final battle against Bowser Junior. Universal Studios&#x27; rendition of the Mushroom Kingdom is magical and easily the best theme park we&#x27;ve experienced.
Earlier this morning, Nintendo announced that the first Super Nintendo World U.S. location is opening in February 2023.

                              <span>PlayStation revealed earlier this year that it was developing new TV shows based on Gran Turismo, Horizon, and God of War. At the time, PlayStation Productions said the Horizon series was happening at Netflix (read some details about that here) and the God of War series was being handled by Amazon. That was it, though. 
Now, we know a little bit more about this God of War series, courtesy of Amazon Prime Video, as reported by Deadline. Amazon Prime Video has officially given a series order to God of War and as the name suggests, it will be based on the hit PlayStation franchise (which just received a sequel last month). More specifically, it will take place during the Norse era of Kratos&#x27; adventures, seemingly bypassing his more gruesome and violent Greek history. God of War (2018) directo…</span>

Hogwarts Legacy hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on February 10, with a recent delay pushing back the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions to April 4 and the Switch version to July 25. Perhaps as a way to soothe the news of yesterday&#x27;s delay, or as a way to get players excited about February, four new looks at Hogwarts Legacy gameplay have been released, and you can watch all four below:

                              <span>The first Super Nintendo World in the US will finally open in February. 
More specifically, the opening day will be February 17, 2023. This news comes by way of a new trailer showcasing what to expect in the new park within Universal Studios Hollywood. There&#x27;s a look at Mario Kart: Koopa&#x27;s Challenge, Yoshi&#x27;s Adventure, the decor of the park, and of course, Mario and Luigi. It looks fantastic, as expected, given how great Super Nintendo World in Japan turned out to be (check out our photo slideshow from our recent visit to the park).
Check out Universal Studios Hollywood&#x27;s video announcing the Super Nintendo World release date below: 


As you can see, the park is looking great. We can&#x27;t wait to visit one day! Universal Studios Japan opened its Super Nintendo World last year and back in June, Universal revealed that Hollywood&#x27;s Nintendo-themed land would be opening in &quot;early 2023.&quot; Now we know the opening day is February 17, 2023, so get your travel dates in order if you plan on visiting this new park next year.

Characters would ramble on as long as you stuck around to listen, and I would find myself standing in certain spots for upwards of five or six minutes, just listening to Roiland (who voiced many characters, Trover included) riff on one joke over and over again. While High on Life and Trover are two very different games, Roiland’s style of comedy is featured heavily in both. When I got a chance to talk to Roiland (an…</span>

                              <span>The Switch and last-gen versions of Hogwarts Legacy have been delayed. The game is still slated to release on February 10 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. However, everyone else will have to wait a few more months. 
The open-world Wizarding World adventure now has two additional release dates. The PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions launch on April 4. The Switch port comes a few months later, on July 25. Developer Avalanche says it decided to stagger the release to ensure the best possible experience on each platform. 
Hogwarts Legacy will launch on April 4, 2023 for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One and on July 25, 2023 for Nintendo Switch. The team is looking forward to bringing you the game and we want to deliver the best possible game experience across all platforms.
December 13, 2022
Additionally, a game FAQ about the change in dates clarifies that the PS4/XB1 Deluxe Editions will not include the 72-hour early access that the current-gen and PC bundle is receiving.

                              <span>Platinum Games vice president Hideki Kamiya doesn&#x27;t see the Bayonetta series ever ending. 
He told IGN Japan this during a new interview, which touches on the creator&#x27;s post-Bayonetta 3 thoughts, possible spin-off games, and a brand new game with the codename Project G.G. When asked if there&#x27;s a chance players get a Bayonetta 4 or even a Bayonetta 5, Kamiya said he wants to make both of those games. 


&quot;I personally can&#x27;t conceive the Bayonetta series ever ending,&quot; Kamiya told IGN Japan. &quot;I want to make a Bayonetta 4 and Bayonetta 5, and I intend on pitching them to the company.&quot;
Kamiya goes further, revealing that the team often talks &quot;internally about how we could make nine of them.&quot; He also said he wants people to believe him when he says, &quot;I&#x27;m not going to do anything that will betray the players.&quot; 
While not official announcements, it seems players hoping for a Bayonetta 4, 5, or even Bayonetta 9 are in luck if Kamiya remains at Platinum Games. While waiting for additional Bayonetta sequels, read about the upcoming spin-off, Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon, and then read Game Informer&#x27;s Bayonetta 3 review.

Since its inception nearly three decades ago, Need for Speed’s best entries have combined style and substance to produce thrilling homages to the street racing scene. Need for Speed Unbound feels like the ultimate realization of that philosophy, creating one of the franchise’s best in years.
Sliding into the driver seat of the nearly 150 cars in Need for Speed Unbound feels terrific. Blasting down a straightaway in a McLaren delivers a remarkable sense of speed but nailing a corner drift in a Mitsubishi feels just as good.…</span>

                              <span>Join hosts Wesley LeBlanc and Kyle Hilliard as the two discuss all things One Piece Odyssey, an upcoming One Piece JRPG based on the hit anime and manga series. 
Wesley recently went hands-on with the game for a couple of hours, exploring One Piece Odyssey&#x27;s first two chapters, and he had a blast. In today&#x27;s New Gameplay Today, the two discuss the game&#x27;s narrative, its combat and what it&#x27;s doing different in the JRPG genre, and why One Piece makes for such a fun world to play around in. Enjoy!

I finished the Arlong Park arc of the One Piece anime this year and took a break to watch some other shows on my lists and play through some games I’ve been meaning to finish. That’s to say, I went into a hands-on preview session with One Piece Odyssey with just a dash of One Piece knowledge, knowing there are still 1000-plus episodes for me to watch to catch up on the series.

I’ve been excited about Forspoken since its reveal as Project Athia in 2020. The fish-out-of-water game set in a medieval fantasy realm is developed by Luminous Productions – an internal Square Enix team that helped develop Final Fantasy XV, a game I quite enjoyed despite its problems. It also features the talents of Uncharted series creator Amy Hennig and Rogue One: A Star Wars Story writer Gary Whitta on the narrative side, which makes me interested in playing through protagonist Frey Holland’s journey.

                              <span>We are pleased to announce that ScummVM now supports Adibou 2, a popular educational game developed by Coktel Vision in 1996.
Designed for children from 4 to 7 years old, the world of Adibou is warm and full of surprises. It offers an intelligent and appealing introduction to essential knowledge like reading and math.
Whether you have young kids in your family, or are keen on reliving your childhood memories for a while, fetch the latest daily build of ScummVM, your own copy of Adibou 2, and start learning having fun with Adibou, Plop, Robitoc and Kicook!
You must copy the content of your Adibou “Environment” CD into the game directory added to ScummVM. Then, for any Adibou Application you want to add, just copy the content of their CD into a freely named subdirectory of the main game directory.
Only Read/Count 4-5 years, Read/Count 6-7 years applications are supported for now, but we hope Science, Music and English will come soon.
Currently ScummVM is aware of several Adibou versions in French, German and English, let us know if you own any language/version not yet registered. Please also report to the issue tracker any glitch you may encounter.

                              <span>The Game Awards have come and gone, and on top of giving quality games, creators, and performers their flowers, we got a boatload of new games to look forward to. So we ask: what was your favorite game announcement of the show?
Did the reveal of sequels like Death Stranding 2, Hades II, or Armored Core VI get you psyched? How about new IPs such as Ken Levine’s Judas, Dontnod’s Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden, and Crime Boss: Rockay City? Did new trailers for Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, Tekken 8, and Final Fantasy XVI raise your anticipation for those titles or put them on your radar? How head-turning was that weird Bayonetta prequel? 
The table is set, and it’s time to feast. Let us know your favorite announcement(s) in the comments below!</span>

                              <span>A generation of fans may love From Software for its litany of Souls games, but the studio was once primarily known for its other beloved series, Armored Core. Tonight at The Game Awards, the studio revealed a new entry in its mech shooter franchise: Armored Core IV: Fires of Rubicon. 
A cinematic trailer set the table, which begins on a rather gloomy (and lava-filled) note before the mechs emerge to kick up the tempo a few notches. Fires of Rubicon is the first entry in the series since 2013’s Armored Core: Verdict Day, so fans have waited a long time for tonight’s news. Check out the trailer below. 


Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon is launching in 2023 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.</span>

                              <span>While the new trailer for the upcoming expansion of Cyberpunk 2077 starts out with some voice lines from Keanu Reeves, the surprise appearance comes from a newly revealed character. Solomon Reed appears as a new figure played by Idris Elba.
Few concrete details are apparent from the trailer, but the spirit and visual styling of Cyberpunk 2077 remains in clear evidence. We know that Phantom Liberty is built as a spy-thriller set in a new district of Night City and that V somehow works together with the government of the New United States of America, and presumably alongside the newly revealed Solomon Reed.
Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty is set for release in 2023 on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</span>

                              <span>At long last, Final Fantasy 16 has a release date. Announced tonight during The Game Awards, Square Enix revealed the game will be released on June 22, 2023.
Following in the tradition of other FF16 trailers, our new glimpse looks great – and definitely expensive. From combat, bosses, story, and world, everything pops off screen – a few short minutes of bombast and spectacle.

Final Fantasy 16 will be a PlayStation 5 console exclusive for six months.</span>

                              <span>Publisher CI Games and developer Hexworks have released a new trailer for its upcoming sequel, The Lords of the Fallen, and it&#x27;s another dark and terrifying look at the Soulslike series. 
Lords of the Fallen was released back in 2014, and GI Games revealed its long-awaited sequel, The Lords of the Fallen, during Gamescom&#x27;s Opening Night Live back in August. A new trailer showcasing another look at the world of this sequel was released during The Game Awards 2022 tonight, and while it only featured a few glimpses of gameplay, it seems The Lords of the Fallen is shaping up to be a worthy successor. 
Watch The Lords of the Fallen gameplay teaser below: 


The Lords of the Fallen is set 1,000 years after the original Lords of the Fallen, and it&#x27;s been designed with cooperative play in mind, according to Hexworks. Two players can play together in uninterrupted online play and experience an &quot;expansive RPG experience filled with NPC quests, compelling characters, and rich narrative,&quot; according to a press release from earlier this year. 
The Lords of the Fallen will be released on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. A release date has not yet been revealed, but it&#x27;s due out sometime in 2023.

                              <span>Multiple beta releases often indicate lots of bugs to be fixed, but in this case we got carried away adding features and thought more testing was needed. New features since beta1 include: Variable interface scaling at whatever size you want (not just 2x and 4x), with optional chunky bevels for that retro feel. Multi-track level crossings to keep road vehicles from stopping in the middle of the crossing. A new Generate World menu which now includes NewGRF, AI, and Game Script configuration menus. Cargo filters for vehicle lists (such as at stations) to allow better visualization of traffic. Optional cargo names above vehicles in vehicle lists, to show at a glance what they carry. The ability to clone or share orders with vehicles grouped by shared orders. An improved local authority action window which now shows you actions you can’t afford, instead of hiding them. In addition, some new tools are available to AI and Game Script authors: Scriptable league tables which can replace the default scoring system AI and Game Scripts can now be modified in Scenario Editor for existing scenarios (although not savegames) (As ever, see the changelog for further details). If you’ve been working on an entry for the title game competition, it’s time to finish and submit it! Download Changelog Bug tracker</span>
