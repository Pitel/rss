                    <span>If you buy the yearly iteration of your favorite sports video game, chances are you haven’t had much to cheer about the last few years. To put it bluntly, the genre is struggling, and even the new console generation hasn’t been the answer to rejuvenating it. Take just this year, for example. Metacritic scores are anything but impressive for the biggest sports around. Madden NFL 22 earned an abysmal 60, NHL 22, which promised to change its metagame, disappointed with a 74. NBA 2K has largely been the franchise to beat, but NBA 2K22 only holds a 76, some of the lowest marks the series has seen in years. FIFA 22 and MLB: The Show 21 earned the highest averages, around 78, but it’s telling that none of these franchises could even crack the 80 mark. 
This downward trend has been going for some …</span>

                    <span>The holiday gifting season is fast upon us, and many of us have kids in our family or friend groups who are hoping for something fun wrapped up to enjoy. Beyond gift-giving, if you’ve got a family of your own, you may be trying to come up with ways to keep yourself and the kids entertained over the holiday break from school. Either way, I can say with confidence that a good family board game is worth its weight in gold, both for keeping everyone happily entertained, but also ensuring some fun shared activities to make memories.
The board gaming hobby has no shortage of wonderful family games, but I’ve kept the focus here on mostly newer projects that you may not have heard of. As you consider which game might be right for your family group, make sure and check against the age recommendatio…</span>

                    <span>I’ve played a lot of Halo Infinite since its free-to-play multiplayer suite launched during the Xbox 20th Anniversary Celebration last week. Coincidentally, I’ve also watched way too much TikTok since then. It’s a real problem I’m dealing with right now. In-between the cooking tutorials and cursed comedy sketches populating my For You page, I’ve stumbled upon several Halo Infinite multiplayer tips that positively affected my knowledge and skill.
In the spirit of Thanksgiving – and being the generous person I am – I’d like to give back to the gaming community by sharing a curated list of the best videos I’ve watched while doom-scrolling this hellscape of a social media app.

                    <span>With winter just on the horizon, this is the last entry in our Fall For Indies series. So, it seems only fitting to end with a glut of great titles to keep players sustained over for the long, dark months ahead. One of our most anticipated games this year, Solar Ash, was originally slated to arrive earlier in the season but is now hitting just ahead of the frostiest time of the year. And while the nights are getting darker sooner, there are still plenty of bright indie launches we’ve got our eye on for the rest of 2021 and beyond.

                    <span>From Thanos to Batman, Fortnite is becoming a comic book fan&#x27;s dream come true. If Epic Games keeps adding Marvel and DC characters at a rapid-fire clip, there&#x27;s a chance we could have an awesome showdown of 100 heroes and villains years down the road. The latest addition is The Batman Who Laughs, a prominent character in the new Fortnite comic book published by DC Comics. Epic surprisingly didn&#x27;t create any skins for the recently released movie, Eternals.

                    <span>When you think of Disney today, there’s a good chance either Star Wars or the Marvel Cinematic Universe comes to mind. That’s not surprising either – it’s the two properties Disney pumps the most time and money into. 
In games, it seems as if Disney exclusively pours resources into them – yes, there’s Kingdom Hearts, which has been great for decades but it seems that series is heading into a decidedly less Disney-based future – and it’s a shame because the nearly 100-year-old company has so much to offer to the video game space, both to classic fans and new ones alike. That’s why Disney needs to tap into its history.
I love a good Star Wars or MCU flick, and I, for the most part, love a game set in a galaxy far far away or in a Marvel-based timeline. But let’s be honest: we almost always k…</span>

                    <span>This holiday season, maybe you&#x27;re traveling. Maybe you&#x27;re not. Maybe you&#x27;re going to be stuffing massive quantities of turkey into your craw, with handfuls of stuffing and cranberry gobbler sandwiches for weeks of high-quality leftovers. Perhaps you&#x27;re just hanging out with a can of carbonated water and a good video game. Whatever you&#x27;re doing, the holidays can be full of hustle and bustle, stress, good times, and everything else – so it might be time for an idle game. A game you can boot up, make a few decisions, and then either return to it five minutes later, five hours later, or even five days later. Good idlers, also known as &quot;clickers&quot; since the genre primarily began with games that took tons of tapping or clicking alongside idle economy and resource management, can be tough to find.…</span>

                    <span>Scyther shouldn’t get all the love.
With Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl releasing last week, we’re now all aboard the Pokémon Legends: Arceus hype train, and we don’t expect it to stop chugging along until the game drops early next year. From the Pokémon Presents last August, where we learned of new evolutions for the oft forgotten Basculin and Stantler, to the trailer drop which revealed Kleavor, the continued promise of new evolutions for old Pokémon means we couldn’t get off the hype train even if we wanted to. It&#x27;s a choo-choo.

Pokémon Legends: Arceus Pokédex - Every Confirmed Pokémon So Far

As of these three reveals, there are 901 Pokémon in existence, not including regional variants and different forms. Of these hundreds, it&#x27;s hard to deny that some Pokémon are outright underwhelming — whether because they’re underpowered, do not evolve, or are of questionable design (looking at you, Bruxish).

The hunger for Animal Crossing-themed LEGO remains as high as ever, and even though the company did sadly reject an Animal Crossing set proposal last month, fans are still hard at work coming up with great designs.
Take these, for example, shared online by a Rebrickable user named iprice. With around 40 designs under their belt already (and they&#x27;ve promised us there are more to come), iprice has been busy putting together designs for a number of non-playable characters from the Animal Crossing franchise. The best bit is that each design uses bricks that you can get – or perhaps already own – yourself.

If we say &quot;there&#x27;s a 2D puzzle platformer coming to the eShop&quot; we&#x27;d understand if the response would be yeah, along with a hundred others. But One Hand Clapping is aiming to be a little different when it arrives on 14th December as you solve puzzles by singing, with the pitch of your voice being key.
It&#x27;s an interesting idea, and of course to play you&#x27;ll need a microphone and headphones - so a Switch-compatible headset is probably the way to go. The game also promises that you don&#x27;t necessarily need a strong singing voice to play.

                    <span>Official art from Zelda, Zelda II and Link&#x27;s Awakening.
Earlier this month saw the launch of Nintendo&#x27;s second modern Game &amp; Watch system, this time inspired by The Legend of Zelda series.
It&#x27;s a cool little collectable to keep on your shelf at home, and aside from the odd little secret that it hides, one of its biggest selling points is the fact that you can actually use it to play three classic Zelda games – the original Legend of Zelda, its sequel Zelda II: The Adventure of Link, and the 1993 Game Boy title Zelda: Link&#x27;s Awakening are all included.

The Switch OLED model&#x27;s arrival gave us a bit of a bump in screen size, which is useful both for the quality of the screen and to make games / UI text a little easier to see. Yet we&#x27;ve stumbled across a quirky product that goes to the next level, and then some – Switch Pro, anyone?
The video above is a pitch video from August, though an Indiegogo campaign only launched last week and has attracted around 60 backers. It&#x27;s also popping up on retailers like GameStop with shipments expected in early December, though it&#x27;s actually less expensive via the Indiegogo page.

Update (Fri 26th Nov, 2021 14:45 BST): If you missed out last time, you might just be able to snag one of the lovely Animal Crossing Dodo Airlines bags that appeared on My Nintendo in Europe last year. Nintendo has announced another restock...

Original Article (Wed 5th Aug, 2020 12:15 BST): We often find ourselves lamenting the days of good old Club Nintendo and its physical gifts, but the My Nintendo store has given us reason to smile once again with the addition of this adorable Dodo Airlines reusable bag.

                    <span>Lobster Link.
Another day, another thing that we didn&#x27;t know about this almost-five-year-old game: Breath of the Wild has a sunburn mechanic.
Unlike real sunburn, the slight blush upon Link&#x27;s body is a little hard to notice: it&#x27;s a very subtle reddening of his shoulders, nose, cheeks, and collarbone, which is to say the most raised areas on his body. He&#x27;ll get this sunburn if he spends too long in an area of extreme heat (the Gerudo Desert) without clothes on, but Nintendo didn&#x27;t want us to worry — so the sunburn layer is capped out at 4%.

                    <span>Racing to leave you cold.
By now, Nintendo fans must be used to drawing the short straw when it comes to multi-platform games. With the Switch containing objectively weaker innards than its closest competitors, many third-party devs will need to cut a few corners in order to allow their games to run on the hybrid console. This might come in the form of lower resolution, cut assets, or even the bold decision to bypass a conventional release in favour of the cloud.
Historically across platforms, racing sims have always been spectacular visual showcases. With less to worry about when it comes to complex animation or AI, a lot more focus can be put into making the games look slicker than Fonzi’s hair-do. With this in mind, it brings us great pain to declare that NASCAR Heat is one of the worst looking racing games we’ve seen on the Switch in some time. So much so, in fact, that we’d wager the game would comfortably run on the GameCube or the Wii. It’s 2021, man.

                    <span>Around 18 months after the game&#x27;s launch.
The Wonderful 101: Remastered on Nintendo Switch and other current-gen platforms had a surprising (at the time) Kickstarter campaign, which was also the first time that PlatinumGames was self-publishing a game. Though it&#x27;s been excellent to see a hugely fun title get a second chance in the spotlight after its previous life as a Wii U exclusive, issues around the Kickstarter campaign have lingered.
The key issue relates to physical rewards that have endured a number of delays, especially when you consider that the game has been out in the wild since May 2020. Today Yetee, which has handled large parts of the production and distribution for PlatinumGames, addressed the remaining rewards and their status in an update sent to backers.

Only a week has passed since the release of Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, but here we are with the games&#x27; first post-launch distribution event.
The distribution is offering players a set of special in-game statues of Turtwig, Chimchar, and Piplup, the games&#x27; three starter Pokémon. These statues can be used to decorate your Secret Base (once you&#x27;ve unlocked that feature, of course), so they&#x27;re well worth picking up if you&#x27;ve been enjoying making your Base as perfect as can be.

Mario Kart Tour is still rolling along with frequent changes in theme, but on 30th November it&#x27;ll shift into an extended Holiday Tour (the equivalent of three tours) to guide players through the festive season.
As you can see in the teaser trailer there&#x27;ll be cute festive versions of characters to try and obtain, quite a few of which have been available in the past but may have passed you by. By the looks it&#x27;ll be light in terms of new content, perhaps with the game ramping up again in the new year.

Although Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl are remakes, there is new stuff to uncover in the Switch releases.
One thing you might have noticed yourself is a new hidden tale located within Canalave library. As explained by IGN, this text wasn&#x27;t featured in the original game and can be located on the second floor of the building. It&#x27;s titled &quot;The Sea&#x27;s Legend&quot; and was apparently &quot;only recently discovered&quot; and so its &quot;ancient letters&quot; have only just been decoded. Here is the tale in full:

                    <span>Think you&#x27;ve got what it takes?
There have been all sorts of mods created for The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild since it was released in 2017, but one thing we&#x27;re yet to really see is one that supports multiplayer. Can you imagine running around the game world with other players - fighting enemies, discovering shrines and climbing mountains together?
Well then, you&#x27;re not alone - a YouTuber, streamer, and modder known as &#x27;PointCrow&#x27; is offering anyone who can make a Breath of the Wild multiplayer mod that supports four players and fulfills a number of other conditions (as detailed in a Google document) $10,000 USD. Yep, that&#x27;s quite the payout, but it&#x27;s not exactly an easy task, either. Admittedly, we&#x27;re not sure how Nintendo might react.

                    <span>It&#x27;s Japan only, for now.

Earlier this year, Square Enix celebrated the Dragon Quest 35th anniversary with multiple announcements, and one of them was Dragon Quest X Offline. As the title reveals, this is a completely &quot;offline&quot; version of the MMO Dragon Quest X featuring updated chibi visuals.

                    <span>The 3DS titles are still out in front.
Yesterday, Famitsu released its latest game charts - revealing Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl for Nintendo Switch got off to an amazing start in Japan, shifting 1,395,642 copies in just the first three days.
This figure was based on in-store purchases alone and means these titles are now officially the second largest Switch game launch in Japan. They&#x27;ve even managed to outdo Pokémon Sword and Shield on release, which sold 1,364,544 million units on release in Japan.

                    <span>When I write one of these Black Friday deal posts for your perusal, the first thing I do is light up a candle and delve into the dusty depths of the RPS archives to see if we have reviewed the product in question. Due to my lowly status, I’m not allowed to handle such hallowed items, so I must consult the wisdom of my betters. We haven’t written about the wired HyperX Cloud II 7.1 headset, but Katharine looked at the wireless version, which is the same, but with less wire. Katharine again, hmm? Is this some kind of conspiracy? Is she using her boss lady powers to get all the good stuff? Or did she just used to be our hardware editor? I’ve connected the dots!

I still have to do exactly what I’m told, but now I’m allowed to pull the big, brass lever that fires the deals cannon. In practice, that means I can keep updating you with the best bargains late into the sunless hours, while  James goes home to do whatever hardware editors do in their free time. Since I have promised not to publish my thirty seven page manifesto entitled “Why I think dogs should vote,” I’m going to talk about this BenQ MOBIUZ EX2710Q monitor instead.

                    <span>As awards season approaches and I start to compile a list of all the great games I missed this year, there&#x27;s one game I really regret not covering in more detail at RPS around the time it came out. That game is The Vale: Shadow Of The Crown, an audio-only RPG about a blind princess fighting to save her kingdom. You may have seen it nominated in the Innovation in Accessibility category of The Game Awards this year, and frankly if it doesn&#x27;t win then a great disservice will have been done. A stark contrast to the other, all very AAA nominees in its category, The Vale doesn&#x27;t rely on flashy visuals to tell its story. In fact, it barely has any graphics at all. Instead, it conjures its world - and tense fighting sequences - from sound alone, creating an experience like nothing else I&#x27;ve ever played.

                    <span>Typically, I&#x27;d associate Google Docs with work, and any form of spreadsheet with even more work, but indie game developer &quot;droqen&quot; has made me reassess that outlook. He&#x27;s the dev behind the 2D platformers Starseed Pilgrim and Probability 0, and now Demon Deleter, a game in which you have to delete the names of a bunch of demons from a spreadsheet. It&#x27;s a simple yet surprisingly fun idea that lets players hang out in this unusual shared space together. The inspiration behind it is pretty random too - droqen tells me he got the idea after spending hours cataloguing items for Animal Crossing.

I know that it’s Actual Black Friday and I’ve had a bit of a rubbish week and coming up with new openers to these deal highlights is starting to get a bit difficult now. I don’t care that I have a bunch of Google docs that have stuff like “I’ve been playing Empire of Sin so I know all about offers you can’t refuse oh this is bloody awful and you are an absolute hack Caelyn” written in them. It doesn’t even matter that this is RPS and Baron James von Hardware-Editor is quite happy to let me make all the puns I like (well, don&#x27;t test me - J). I have standards and that means I will not make the obvious Crucial joke.
Actually I will. It’s Crucial that you check out these fantastic portable SSD deals.

                    <span>I&#x27;d say call your family, but do we not all view phonecalls as deeply suspicious now? My phone is a glass-and-silicon brick for displaying text that makes me unhappy.
It&#x27;s been a while since we&#x27;ve found ourselves here, looking at some indie games, and once again I have been drawn to some that are a little melancholy, but in a sort of healing, wholesome way. I&#x27;m not sure if that says anything great about my state of mind right now, but hey - the nights are drawing in, there&#x27;s a bit of a nip in the chip, and it&#x27;s the time of year when we&#x27;re encouraged to think about family, found or otherwise. And who in their 30s doesn&#x27;t get sad thinking about that.

                    <span>When the PC version of Monster Hunter Rise arrives in January, it will include all the post-launch content released so far on Switch, Capcom have confirmed. Yes, this includes the weird Sonic The Hedgehog crossover which launches today. So when the game finally comes our way, it&#x27;ll be both larger and sillier.

                    <span>This week&#x27;s episode of the Ultimate Audio Bang is, once again, all about the big releases. Battlefield 2042&#x27;s in a bit of state, so we talk about the many patches scheduled to fix it up. We&#x27;ve also heard that those banned in Call Of Duty: Vanguard will be banned across the entire series, which is nice. Halo Infinite&#x27;s multiplayer surprise launched and Outriders DLC appears out of nowhere too. Imogen rounds off the news with her Apex Legends ranked update. Has she reached the platinum dream?

It might not be as big as Steam&#x27;s sale (check out our Steam Autumn Sale recommendations) but GOG&#x27;s games are (mostly) DRM-free, and many of their good discounts are the same. Deals include 90% off Shadow Tactics, half-price Cyberpunk 2077, 80% off The Witcher 3 GotY... yeah, these will do nicely.

                    <span>I recently spent a couple of weeks with the Roccat Pyro as my main work and gaming keyboard, and it was a lovely bit of kit for the price; full-size mechanical keyboards rarely cost under £100, yet here was one that started at £90 and had everything a typical PC gamerist could ask for. Now, what with it being Black Friday and all, it’s hit a new lowest price of £60 – a 33% saving.


For such anti-riches I can’t recommend any other tenkey-equipped, fully mechanical keyboard more; indeed, it held the ‘best cheap mechanical gaming keyboard’ title on our best keyboards list well before this discount revealed itself. The only thing missing here is USB pass-through, but N-key rollover, a volume dial, a detachable wrist rest, macro recording and RGB backlighting are all part of the deal. 


Sadly I haven’t found such a drastic saving for US buyers, though Amazon has sliced off a few dollars to bring it down to $75.

                    <span>If you enjoy carefully constructing a lineup of warriors in games like Darkest Dungeon or Monster Train, here&#x27;s a surprising recommendation: play Super Auto Pets. The free-to-play auto-battler reminds me much more of those games than the likes of Dota Auto Chess or Teamfight Tactics, focused on building and arranging a line whose abilities will compliment each other. And for something so cute and simple-sounding, it has a delightful amount of buildcrafting. Even the F2P monetisation is good!

                    <span>Black Friday is here. There are only deals. Deals on games. Deals on monitors. Deals on graphics cards, in the sense that they’re slightly less of a rip-off. The deals converge, parting the clouds and blackening the sky until but one shines through: £110 off the AMD Ryzen 7 5800X. Hey. That’s pretty good.

                    <span>The Apocalypse came, and it was a shambles. The angels, you see, the divine powers, they did not anticipate that the world had changed, and instead of a hundred million people still impressed by hot food, they had to deal with 8 billion who had long since invented the AK47, and when the holy fires came, humanity tooled up.
This is how the Sin Collector Colon Repentless starts. I am enjoying it a great deal.

Mezi hrami najdete Kerbal Space Program (stavíte rakety), Besiege (stavíte obléhací stroje) a Universe Sandbox (simulátor vesmíru s gravitací a srážkami).

                    <span>Is there anything better than sitting down to a big feast, surrounded by friends and family on Thanksgiving? Yes. Absolutely crushing a culinary rival before sitting down to that feast. Which is why, this year, I sparked up a totally friendly cooking competition with Game Informer’s resident Instagram chef, Brian Shea. Of course, I have no cooking skills. Even the least flammable foods turn to fiery ash as soon as I enter the kitchen. But that doesn’t matter because I have a virtual ace up my sleeve.
I’ve been putting Animal Crossing: New Horizons’ newly introduced stove through its paces, growing crops, stealing techniques from villagers, and gathering all possible ingredients to whip up some mouth-watering dishes. So, instead of a fair fight that I’d lose, I challenged my fellow editor t…</span>

                    <span>Thanksgiving Day used to be the start of the holiday shopping season, and the parade Macy&#x27;s holds in the middle of New York City every year is designed to promote the biggest names and brands you&#x27;ll be hearing about for the next month. Given how big of an industry video games have become in the last 40 years, you&#x27;d think every other balloon in the show would feature a memorable Nintendo or Sony character hovering down the chilly street. Surprisingly, that&#x27;s not the case, and only a handful of characters and games have had the honor to join in the festivities. We&#x27;ve collected them here in one place for you to gawk at, and have ranked them for your enjoyment.
Here are all of the video game balloons featured in the Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade over the years:

                    <span>Solar Ash represents a dramatic leap forward for Heart Machine. After eleasing the 2D Zelda-inspired Hyper Light Drifter in 2016 to critical acclaim, fans of the game clamored to see what was next and many were surprised to see something totally different. Solar Ash is bigger and bolder than Hyper Light Drifter in every way, from its switch to a fully 3D world to its new emphasis on high-speed traversal over combat-focused dungeon crawling. But what is Solar Ash? Heart Machine’s creative director, Alx Preston, took us through a tour of the game to discuss its origins, gameplay, and how he is coping with the fear of the sophomore slump.
In Preston’s words the “stupid elevator pitch” for Solar Ash is Super Mario Galaxy meets Shadow of the Colossus. Given that Solar Ash takes place in a beaut…</span>

                    <span>With Thanksgiving upon us, there are two types of people out there: the person who’s been thinking about the upcoming turkey meal since November 1 or the person who jumps straight to the winter holiday of Christmas, Hanukkah, or something else. Regardless of where you land, there’s a good chance that you’ll be eating some kind of breakfast, lunch, or dinner with family and friends sometime in the next two months. 
These meals can be fantastic, but they can also be a nightmare for those that hate these typical family gatherings. The same can be said for family gatherings and meals in video games, and we’ve gathered up some of our favorites. Here are 10 of the best family meals in video games.

                    <span>Thanksgiving sucks. It&#x27;s the one time of year you see all those family members you spend the other 364 days of the year avoiding. You know, the cousin that&#x27;s way into NFTs and meme stocks. The uncle who listens to the Joe Rogan Experience and somehow finds a way to reference it at every drop of the hat. It&#x27;s all just exhausting. 
And that doesn&#x27;t even get at how bad turkey is. Turkey is like the Bunny Bread of meats. Dry, flavorless, and gross. Thanksgiving is a problematic holiday for many reasons, but I think turkey is the cherry on top of this crap sundae. How have we made such a bland, ugly bird the centerpiece of this entire annual tradition? Don&#x27;t get me started on those weird things under turkeys&#x27; chins. I find it unfathomable that people eat these creatures.

                    <span>When Halo: The Master Chief Collection was announced in 2014, fans were excited at the prospects of bringing forward the mainline Halo series to the brand new Xbox One with myriad enhancements and ways to engage with the multiplayer. Unfortunately, the launch of the compilation, which originally included Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary, Halo 2 Anniversary, Halo 3, and Halo 4, featured several problems surrounding the multiplayer suite and The Master Chief Collection seemed like it was well on its way to being one of the cautionary stories of unfulfilled potential within the games industry.
The disappointing launch, underwhelming feature set, and broken matchmaking could have been the way we look back on Halo: The Master Chief Collection in 2021, but developer 343 Industries wasn&#x27;t satisfi…</span>

                    <span>It’s 4pm on Thanksgiving Day. You’re probably stuffed with turkey right now, or in the process of stuffing yourself with turkey, or still waiting to stuff yourself with turkey. (If you ate ham, get the hell out of here.) You know what that means? It’s time to make hats!
Making turkey hats is an old Thanksgiving tradition. It’s not hard to see why; turkey hats combine two of our favorite things: food and fashion. Hats also make your head look bigger, which will convince people that your brain is huge.

People who wear hats are often the life of the party. Need proof? Check out this picture of Spock.

Boy what a boring guy. Now, what if we throw a hat on him?

Instant party animal! You too can be this guy. But instead of making the traditional Turkey hat for Thanksgiving, why not make a hat …</span>

The arrival of Halo Infinite&#x27;s campaign is imminent. To get you ready for December 8, we sat down with the team at 343 Industries to learn everything we need to know about the upcoming return of Master Chief.


Halo Infinite takes place 18 months after the events of Halo 5, and a lot has changed since we last saw the Xbox icon. The UNSC is fighting for its life on Zeta Halo, The Banished are getting closer to completing their nefarious goals, and humanity once again hangs in the balance. Some of those tropes may sound familiar, but 343 is here to tell you why Chief&#x27;s new story should have fans excited. Quick SPOILER warning: We discuss where the characters are and some of their motivations headed into Halo Infinite. If you want to go in clean, come back to …</span>

                    <span>A few big&#x27;uns still to come in 2021, plus 2022&#x27;s heavy hitters.
We&#x27;re approaching the end of 2021 now and we&#x27;ve have seen some fantastic games come to Switch this year. It&#x27;s also true that a few big names have slipped into 2022 — for understandable reasons — but there are still some heavy hitters to come before the bell rings on 31st December.
Below we&#x27;ve updated our list and rounded up thirty of the biggest Switch games we&#x27;re looking forward to — both the remainder we&#x27;re waiting for in the final month of 2021 and all the big ones lined up for 2022. They run the gamut from AAA first-party offerings to promising-looking indies. There are a few big names that are still pencilled in for this year, so we&#x27;re hoping for some surprise drops as we head into the Holidays (fingers crossed!).

                    <span>It sure is a strategy.
We&#x27;ve seen developers and publishers race to the bottom in terms of Switch eShop prices, practically giving games away. Then we&#x27;ve seen promotions that have actually given games away for free, with No Gravity Games the latest to jump into that approach this festive season.
It&#x27;s worth noting that all of this is only for North American accounts, it isn&#x27;t happening on the European eShop.

                    <span>Next week&#x27;s free game on the Epic Games Store will be a big&#x27;un: Dead By Daylight. I&#x27;ve been impressed by the 1v4 multiplayer horror game, watching it steadily grow into one of Steam&#x27;s most popular after a while looking like it might slip a way, so that&#x27;s a nice get. But before then, Epic are currently giving away a whole other manner of slaughter, the hunting sim TheHunter: Call Of The Wild. You know, you can skip guns and just play that as a very pretty walking simulator.

                    <span>Keyboards are one of, if not the most, integral part of a PC set up. Second only to the monitor. Therefore, finding a good one is imperative - especially for anyone spending long stints gaming while using said keyboard. Within the stellar range of gaming keyboards on offer, there are a few different types: ones with lights, mechanical, compact, wireless - I could go on. The beauty of Fnatic&#x27;s offering is that it covers most bases, so you really can&#x27;t go wrong with it.

                    <span>Katharine and I went hands-on with Babylon’s Fall last week, that online action RPG by PlatinumGames which falls in and out of memory as the years tick by. Still, when an invitation to the third phase of its ongoing closed beta test arrived, I couldn’t help but get excited. These are the folks behind NieR: Automata and Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance, after all, and now they’re making a live-service, co-op slasher. Sign. Me. Up.
As it stands, the closed beta only showed a very small, very early build of the game, but we’ve got some thoughts. Combat, exploration, and co-op were all on offer here, and there’s a fair amount to unpack. Look beyond the early build jank and there’s definitely potential.

                    <span>Warhammer 40k has a bunch of interesting gods, and I have to say my least favourite is Nurgle. He&#x27;s a big plague monster that infects everything with grossness, and uh oh, he&#x27;s the big bad in the upcoming turn-based tactical RPG Warhammer 40,000: Chaos Gate - Daemonhunters. Developers Complex Games have released a new dev diary talking about how his minions will bring plague across the land and, admittedly, it looks quite cool. But also: yuck!

We didn&#x27;t think we&#x27;d manage to get a whole show out of it, but boy did we.
Also tune in to learn about Matthew&#x27;s new (and extremely one-sided) rivalry with an Olympic swimmer, a cavern of lies featuring bar tender Ed Harris, and a digression so self-indulgent we talk about how self-indulgent we are, and decide that it is a good thing.

                    <span>Recently, I’ve moved out of the city and into a little village in the middle of nowhere. Look outside the window and I see trees, maybe a little house nestled atop a hill. I walk past sheep and hope they don’t shuffle away from me this time, as it could mean we’re finally mates. At night it gets really dark, darker than you think is possible. An owl screeches and it scares the bejeezus out of me.
Yeah, it’s nice out here. But getting into the village by car is a challenge. The roads are wobbly and narrow, with little patience for noisy machines. This means I’ve had to stop and let other cars pass a lot. At first it was irritating, but now I’ve come to enjoy it. Getting a wave or a flash of the lights warms the heart and can turn a bad day into a good one. It strikes me that multiplayer games lack this fleeting comradery, which is a shame.

It has the gorgeous pixel art and presentation of a classic tycoon game, as well as all the simulation aspects you’d ever want. But buried under that business management exterior is a game equally interested in exploring moral choices, and one that leaves me thankful it pauses before I have to make a decision.

                    <span>Amazon Studios are &quot;nearing a deal&quot; to develop a TV series based on Mass Effect, according to a recent Deadline report. Excellent stuff. I&#x27;m all for it! If Mass Effect were to be adapted into anything, I&#x27;d much rather it be a potentially long-running series rather than a film so it has enough time to establish its excellent sci-fi setting. However, we need to talk about what story Amazon could potentially take from the games. To me, it seems likely they&#x27;d follow the trilogy, which I reckon is the right move. But I don&#x27;t think we need to see more of Shepard&#x27;s side of things, you know? They should put Liara front-and-centre instead.

                    <span>After releasing Battlefield 2042 in an unready state, Dice today took a step towards fixing and finishing it by releasing a wee patch which tweaks weapon balance and fixes some bugs. Bullet spread on all guns except shotguns is reduced, for starters, making them more accurate. The ludicrous hovercraft is less murderous too. And they&#x27;ve wiped out bugs including one which left players stuck downed, unable to respawn. Read on for more.

To gain a sneak-peek into that world, we asked the A.I.-based text generator InferKit to rewrite some of our favorite games, and the results ranged from hilarious to outright eerie. Below are the A.I. rewrites – the seed text is in bold, and everything else is machine-generated.
Batman: Arkham Asylum
The inmates of Arkham Asylum have been set free – and it&#x27;s up to Batman to bring order to the chaos and take back the asylum. Along the way, he reunites with some old allies and discovers an even deeper secret: he isn&#x27;t the only one with a destiny, and this time, his isn&#x27;t a fairy tale.

                    <span>Hey, look, it’s almost Thanksgiving (AKA Black Friday’s Eve)! Soon, those of us in the U.S. will spend the day chowing down on all manner of homecooked foods. If you’re reading this, odds are you’ll be spending just as much time catching up on the year’s best video games. It’s a lot like treating yourself to a digital feast, and given that Thanksgiving dinner is, scientifically speaking, the perfect assemblage of food, there’s only one way to determine the best combination of games you can play. We must figure out which games are most similar to a classic Thanksgiving dish. Science demands it!

                    <span>After the first series of Resident Evil movies made over a billion dollars in box office revenue, production company Constantine Films is ready to reboot its biggest film franchise. But where the original series deviated drastically from the source material, new director Johannes Roberts – known for his work on 47 Meters Down and The Strangers: Prey At Night – wants to do right by Capcom&#x27;s original games with his new film, Resident Evil: Welcome To Raccoon City. We caught up with Roberts, to ask what it&#x27;s been like bringing the first two games to life.

Halo Infinite is having a big few weeks. On top of the free-to-play multiplayer suite launching ahead of the full game&#x27;s release on December 8, Master Chief&#x27;s next adventure is also the focus of the latest Game Informer cover story! And what&#x27;s a cover story without a brand new Rapid-Fire interview with the one and only Joseph Staten?
Join us as we sit down with 343&#x27;s head of creative to discuss all things Halo Infinite in our patented scorching-fast style. Joseph was kind enough to put up with us for 117 questions that span everything fans will want to know about one of the biggest games of 2021. In true Rapid-Fire fashion, we have plenty of questions centered on getting to the bottom of Halo Infinite. Who is the Weapon? Will there be new maps and firearms added to the multiplayer suite as time goes on? What happened to Chief and Cortana after the events of Halo 5?
It also wouldn&#x27;t be a Rapid-Fire without some questions you probably wouldn&#x27;t think to ask, like what kind of broadway musical does Chief listen to while slaying The Banished and saving the universe? You&#x27;ll get the answer to that question and so much more during this exclusive interview that you can find above!
Is the wait for Halo Infinite&#x27;s campaign feeling too long? We understand and want to help you through this time with our exciting new cover story! This month, we&#x27;re diving into a ton of new and compelling interviews, gameplay videos, and more from the team behind the next entry in Master Cheif&#x27;s story. Be sure to check out our quick looks at the game&#x27;s opening level, our campaign impressions, learn more about exploration and progression, and our look into the creation of the devious bots from the earlier versions of the multiplayer test flights. Thanks for watching, and let us know what you thought of the video in the comments below!</span>

                    <span>Children of the ’90s may remember the surge of enthusiasm surrounding Pokémon Snap’s N64 release. Unlike other popular Pokémon titles up to that point, it offered the chance to catch creatures not with a Poké Ball but with a camera. The game featured rushing rivers, sunny beaches, and dark caverns, all stuffed with familiar specimens. The most skilled players snapped – to our young minds – unbelievably realistic shots of these roving Pokémon in their natural habitats while the ever-moving vehicle pushed onward. But it wasn’t enough to capture wild pictures of our favorite creatures. We needed to share these works of art with the world.
Short of parading friends past the home console to admire our digital albums, there didn’t seem to be a good way to do so. Enter the Pokémon Snap Station. I…</span>

                    <span>You&#x27;ve probably seen a million lists online about pairing wine with food or wine with music, hell, even wine with movies. But where are the wine pairings for video games? To address this absence, we talked with master sommelier Morgan Harris about what types of wines go best with which games.
Before we start, we should note that wine and game pairing isn&#x27;t an exact science. Pairing wine with food often results in chemical interactions that enhance or alter flavors; this doesn&#x27;t happen with game pairings, obviously. &quot;Fundamentally, wine is a grocery which means it doesn&#x27;t really have a lot of structural overlaps with gaming, which is a leisure activity,&quot; Harris says. &quot;At their base, they&#x27;re very different things, but there is certainly some overlap and both of them are designed to give plea…</span>

                    <span>Every year, when the daylight wanes faster than I’d prefer and the air chills to bitter cold, I retreat from any outdoor activities and turn to the warmth of my computer. That’s where I sink deep into my chair, crack open some sodas and junk food, and boot up my chosen genre to escape the harsh months of Minnesota weather. It’s when I’m most at home diving deep into a good MMO.
Each winter is a new opportunity to explore another facet of the vast worlds I’ve explored many times before. Usually, my go-to MMO is World of Warcraft, which I’ve been playing on and off since 2005. Maybe I never hit the current level cap on the last character I was playing, and that’s my jumping on point, or a new expansion is releasing, and I want to get caught up on the juicy lore and character moments leading …</span>

                    <span>How does a video game from another region make it into your hands, and how do companies ensure you’re getting an experience that lives up to the original? As the gaming industry becomes more globalized, video game localization is an increasingly pertinent topic. But few people actually understand what goes into the process. Preparing to release a game in a new country or region comes with many challenges that go well beyond simple translation.
When a game is localized well, it’s free of typos and grammatical errors, the dialogue is natural, and the instructions make sense. But even this is skimming the surface of the localization team’s role in the process. As games become more complex and text-heavy, not only do the challenges continue to grow, but the quality bar – and our expectations –…</span>

Epic Games is ending Fortnite&#x27;s second chapter sooner than expected. On December 4 at 4 p.m. ET, the Cube Queen is waging war against all of the combatants on the Island in a new limited event called &quot;The End.&quot;
This event is a one-time instance, meaning you won&#x27;t be able to play it again after you complete it. Epic recommends content creators and players record their playthrough as it will be the only way to see it again.
The End allows for groups of up to 16 players to queue together. Friends can get together 30 minutes before the event begins. This current season is ending a day earlier than Epic originally announced, so anyone who logs in now between December 4 will receive a 225,000 XP reward. Players who compete in The End event will earn a themed loading screen and wrap. From November 26 to 29, Epic is holding a power-leveling weekend with supercharged XP to help players complete the battle pass.
What comes next is anyone&#x27;s guess. Epic will likely continue on with Chapter 3 and a new theme. We know Boba Fett is coming to the game, and there are rumors that The Matrix will be involved as well.
What do you hope to see from Fortnite next? And what did you think of the current chapter? Let us know in the comments section below!</span>

Halo Infinite&#x27;s free multiplayer experience offers many avenues of play, including timed events. This week, 343 Industries introduced the game&#x27;s first limited event called Facture: Tenrai.
From now until November 30, players can make progress on a new 30-tier battle pass, with the ultimate goal of unlocking a complete set of Yoroi Armor. The Tenrai battle pass is free, and although it isn&#x27;t here for long, 343 Industries states that it will return at future dates, starting again in January. All progress made on the battle pass now will carry over when it returns.
Most unlocks on this new battle pass come after gaining experience by completing challenges in the limited-time game mode: Fiesta. This 4-versus-4 skirmish gives random weapons to every player each time they spawn. Rockets, swords, and sniper rifles are all a part of the mix.
On top of this event, 343 Industries has set 10 a.m. PT as the weekly date that Halo Infinite&#x27;s shop is restocked with new gear. This week, players can purchase the Chonmage Armor set (for 2,000 credits, which is roughly $17.99). Along with the samurai-like armor, this bundle includes the Thorn Diver legendary stance, Sundown Smile epic armor coating, and the Chonmage epic helmet.
Other items in the shop include the Sentinel&#x27;s Blade legendary utility, which comes with the Sentinel epic nameplate and emblem. If you want your weapons to have a little more style, the Shinobi Wrap decal is available, and gives your weapon a lilac-steel color, along with a Shinobi wrap model and a Shuriken charm. The last item available this week is the Six Date Loyalty bundle, consisting of the Noble Loyalty epic armor coating and two sixth gate shoulder pads. You can see all of the offers below:</span>

                    <span>If you have family visiting for a Thanksgiving feast and a holiday weekend of relaxation and shopping, there&#x27;s a good chance the younger demographic will be looking for entertainment. If they have their iPads, they&#x27;ll likely retreat into YouTube watching mode, but you can use that screen to bring the family together for some fun game time as well. 
I rounded up a handful of games that should deliver entertainment for groups of kids and adults alike. The difficult task is finding games that are available on a wide variety of devices and offer crossplay support – meaning you can play together, even if you are on PlayStation 4 and the kids are on their iPads.
If you are just entertaining one or two kids, I also included a few games that they should get a kick out of, yet are only available on…</span>

Even after some patches, these darn creepy crawlies aren’t shaken off so easily. These games are plagued by crashes, glitches, and general instability, to the point where playing them can be as fun as wading through a swarm of locusts.
Halo Infinite, though? The multiplayer component that had a bunch of flight tests? Pretty solid. Sure, a few bugs and matchmaking issues, but for the most part, it’s the most stable multiplayer FPS I’ve played this year. What was 343’s magic pesticide? Time. Simple as. Something Vanguard and Battlefield 2042 are only just catching up on.

Oculus have just announced their official Black Friday deals for their standalone VR headset, and all you&#x27;re going to get is a £50 / $50 voucher to spend on today&#x27;s best VR games rather than a discount on the headset itself. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s a decent amount to kickstart your VR library, but the credit voucher also has some niggly conditions attached to it that make it a lot less satisfying than a simple £50 / $50 discount off the regular headset price.

It&#x27;s one of those, well, sims, where it&#x27;s all too tempting to recreate friends and family you know in real life and send them on a path you&#x27;ve chosen. Right now in The Sims 4, players are limited to making life choices for these Sims they&#x27;ve created, doomed to watch Neighbour Sims do their own thing. But on November 30th, the Neighborhood Stories update will let you influence what these NPCs do, from starting families to changing careers.

                    <span>Battlefield 2042 isn&#x27;t in the best place right now. It&#x27;s a game lacking many classic Battlefield features, and in amongst those empty spaces? Bugs. Lots of em. Dice know this and they&#x27;ve detailed three updates to address some of these issues, all of which are due out by the end of this year.

                    <span>The world of PC parts can be mighty confusing, especially with so many different options popping up almost daily. New technology here, there and everywhere. Sometimes it can be all too overwhelming to figure out what parts are good for a fast computer, but don&#x27;t worry - we&#x27;re here to help. 
WD - or, Western Digital - have been on a crusade to rival Samsung&#x27;s computer bits for a while now, and may have finally achieved it with this SSD. In layman&#x27;s terms, it will kick your computer into super speed, running games and operating system super fast and quick like. This particular SSD supports the PCle 4.0 standard, allowing for much faster read and write speeds than the older 3.0 interface. As Katharine found in her WD SN850 review, this drive is also both faster and cheaper than its big PCIe 4.0 rival, the Samsung 980 Pro.

                    <span>Epic Games have bought Harmonix, the studio behind rhythm games including Rock Band and Fuser, to help support their boring attempt to &quot;build the metaverse&quot;. The Fortnite and Unreal Engine overlords say that Harmonix &quot;will collaborate closely with Epic to develop musical journeys and gameplay for Fortnite&quot;. The battle royale has seen some fancy musical performances, with elaborate in-game events to promote pop stars including Travis Scott and Ariana Grande, but hopefully Harmonix aren&#x27;t consigned to advertising for eternity?

                    <span>Xbox has announced the Xbox Games With Gold line up for December and per usual, it includes two Xbox One games and two older-generation games. 
Four games are up for grabs this month. They are The Escapists 2 on Xbox One, Tropico 5: Penultimate Edition on Xbox One, Orcs Must Die on Xbox 360, and Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet on Xbox 360. Of course, thanks to Xbox’s backward compatibility features, anyone with an Xbox Series X/S or Xbox One can download and play all four of these games. 
The Escapists 2 is a game about, well, escaping... be it from snowy tundras to deserts and more. You and up to three friends can team up to escape from some of the toughest prisons in the world, and you can do so by following the rules, learning the routines, and discovering the best ins and outs of each l…</span>

                    <span>According to announcements from both companies, music and rhythm game developer Harmonix is being acquired by Epic Games. 
Epic Games made a statement saying on its website about the company&#x27;s future, saying, &quot;The Harmonix team will collaborate closely with Epic to develop musical journeys and gameplay for Fortnite while continuing to support existing titles including Rock Band 4.&quot;
Harmonix has a brief blog post on its site as well, followed by a short Q&amp;A covering the obvious questions regarding its active support for Rock Band and most recent release FUSER. Here&#x27;s the statement from Harmonix about joining the Epic family: 
For the time being, the company is sticking to keeping its upcoming seasons and events for its games in the pipeline, and won&#x27;t be discontinuing support in any way. Other than that, details are scant other than Harmonix games like Rock Bank will continue to stay up and running, though expect the developer to leverage its talents in Fortnite sometime in the future musical talents as well.
Epic has, of course, been dipping its toes into interactive concerts and musical performances in recent years, and that trend will undoubtedly continue and expand with a team like Harmonix under its umbrella. If any team can top what Epic has done with experiences like last summer&#x27;s Ariana Grande performance, Harmonix would be the group to do it. 
Does this make you hopeful for more dedicated music games, or are you potentially excited for more rhythm content in Fortnite? Give us your thoughts on the Harmonix acquisition in the comments below.</span>

                    <span>Nintendo and Illumination announced that Chris Pratt would voice Mario in the upcoming Mario movie exactly two months ago. In those eight weeks, the conversation around this choice has focused on the accent of the famous plumber. Will he be doing the traditional Mario accent, or will he do something else?
In a new interview with TooFab, Mario movie co-producer Chris Meledandri has defended Pratt’s casting, calling his voice for Mario phenomenal.

“All I can tell you is the voice that he’s doing for us, and Mario, is phenomenal,” Meledandri told TooFab. “Yeah, I can’t wait for people to hear it.”
TooFab asked the producer about the decision to cast Pratt, someone who isn’t Italian, as the Italian plumber. Meledandri said he’s an Italian American and understands some of the feelings people have over the casting choice. He said Charlie Day, who is Italian, being cast as Luigi, is this movie’s nod to the Italian background of the famous plumber duo. 
However, Meledandri adds that you can expect the Mario movie to touch on the Italian accent, or rather, lack thereof. 
“We cover it in the movie,” he said. “So, you’ll see we definitely nod to that.” 
Meledandri also said that you should not expect Pratt’s performance to lean too much into the “It’s a-me, Mario!” side of the character, popularized by Charles Martinet, who’s been the voice of Mario for decades.

                    <span>With it being Xbox’s 20th anniversary this year, the company has done a lot to commemorate the special milestone. There’s the limited edition Adidas shoes, the fancy Halo Xbox Series X, and more. Now, there’s a digital Xbox museum you can peruse through, too. 
Getting there is quite simple – head to museum.xbox.com. We highly recommend signing in because doing so will create a museum space unique to you that features information about your history with Xbox as a brand, your achievements, and more. That’s not all, though. Within the museum are multiple other sections for your metaverse-like avatar to visit: the original Xbox, the Xbox 360, the Xbox One, the Xbox Series X/S, and a Halo section. 
As you walk through each museum section using your keyboard, you can place your 3D avatar into yellow circles on the ground. These circles are found in front of museum exhibits and once in the circle, you can interact with the exhibit to learn more. For example, in the original Xbox space, there’s a circle in front of an exhibit with the title “Bill Gates and The Rock join forces to unveil Xbox.” Upon interacting with this exhibit, you’ll be taken to an interactable story that features information about this unveiling, a video of the event, and more. 
That’s what each of the digital exhibits is like, too, and it seems like making your way through the entire museum would take hours. It’s quite an expansive lineup of information, not to mention it features your own personal history with Xbox in a section as well. 
Head to museum.xbox.com to tour through the exhibit yourself and then catch up on some of Game Informer’s Halo Infinite coverage – it’s Halo’s 20th birthday too this year, after all. After that, check out these Xbox 360 Adidas sneakers and then take a look at this new Halo Xbox Elite controller.

                    <span>When the PlayStation 5 was first revealed last year, the console design was polarizing. On one end of the spectrum, PlayStation fans were excited about the new futuristic, sleek look. In contrast, other consumers were not as impressed, namely in regards to the white faceplates. Once the next-gen console launched, third-party companies began producing different colored faceplates, with black being one of the most popular options on the market. Sony, for the most part, legally brought an end to those competitors. And now, the entertainment conglomerate has been granted its own patent for official PS5 faceplates. 
According to GameSpot, the patent is listed as a “Cover for Electronic Device” and comes paired with a few mock-up sketches of the PlayStation 5. The text within the patent claim mentions a “Skin cover for PS5 console” and “the ornamental design for a cover for an electronic device.” 
Of course, this doesn’t immediately equate to a future where Sony-labeled faceplates might be sold at your local electronic establishments. For all we know, nothing will come of this. But it’s nice to imagine a new look for the PlayStation 5. Only time will tell what this patent means for the console’s aesthetic. 
Do you think this is simply Sony cornering the market without the intention of actually releasing faceplates? Or are we going to see this patent put to use? Throw down your theories in the comments below!

Death is one of the few things we all have in common. We all experience death sooner or later, and that can be terrifying because we don’t truly know what awaits us on the other side. Salvation? Oblivion? Death’s Door offers an amusing interpretation of death by framing it as a boring, day-to-day business run by crows.

                    <span>Keanu Reeves has revealed that he doesn’t believe Mortal Kombat to be a good fit for John Wick or Neo. 
It’s always tough when you hear people you look up to say something wrong, but sometimes you just have to power through it and that’s what we’re all doing after Reeves told Esquire he doesn’t want his characters in Mortal Kombat. As reported by GameSpot, it’s not that Reeves isn’t a fan of Mortal Kombat – he just thinks John Wick and Neo don’t belong. 
“If it was up to me? No, Mortal Komat is awesome in so many ways, but I think...you know, Neo, John Wick, they’re doing their own thing,” Reeves told Esquire. “Mortal Kombat is doing their own thing.” 
Look, Reeves certainly knows these characters more than us Internet folks who want to see Neo lean back to dodge Scorpion’s infamous “get over here” chain attack, but c’mon, no to John Wick as well? That character is a trained assassin that has killed anyone in his way – surely Sub-Zero doesn’t stand a chance. 
Regardless, there might still be a chance despite what Reeves says. As noted by GameSpot, Mortal Kombat and its developer NetherRealm are owned by Warner Bros. which is the same company that owns The Matrix franchise...so the possibility is there. In fact, Game Informer reported in 2019 that series creator Ed Boon said NetherRealm was “pretty close” to adding Neo to Injustice 2.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve always found it hard to get excited about the Men Of War series. This is admittedly partly down to the name. Short of outright calling your game &quot;War&quot;, Men Of War is about as generic a title as you can get for a video game. And I think this was at least partly reflective of the games behind it. Men Of War has generally delivered dependable real-time tactics games, but the series has never excited me in the way that, say, Relic&#x27;s Company Of Heroes does.
So it&#x27;s a promising sign that, at the end of Best Way&#x27;s demonstration of the just-announced Men Of War II, I came away keen to play it. Not only does it look slicker and more user friendly than earlier games (without compromising on the depth that appeals to the series&#x27; core fanbase) there are a couple of ideas it’s playing with that lodged themselves in my mind like chunks of grenade shrapnel.

                    <span>Black Friday is weird. Partly because it’s not a Friday in any meaningful sense; what feels like a majority of deals start at least a fortnight in advance and continue well into the following week, an almost month-long commerce safari. The best Black Friday deals? Uncountable, not for lack of trying.


I have mixed feelings about it, clearly. I get why some people hate it. But I like having better computer stuff, and I like not having to spend as much money to get it. They’ve kind of got me over a barrel here. Still, while I’d never begrudge anyone climbing above the bottom layers of the ol’ Maslow’s hierarchy, it’s worth making sure that you’re only buying the things you want – not the things a big red “percentage figure off!” sticker makes you think you want. With that in mind, I asked around the RPS crew whether there’s anything specific they’re keeping an eye out for this Black Friday.

                    <span>I was toiling away in the Black Friday deal mines when I uncovered one that our US friends might particularly appreciate: a titantic $1400 off the 2020 Razer Blade 15 Advanced. This slimline gaming laptop, complete with a 300Hz IPS display, is now only $1600 – close to half price, which is an even bigger deal when the MSRP is the same as a serviceable used car.

                    <span>Alright, so I played Sherlock Holmes Chapter One, and just yesterday I finished Agatha Christie - Hercule Poirot: The First Cases, and now I&#x27;m like, &quot;When is someone going to put these hot, young investigators into a dating sim?&quot; because that would be extremely funny. You know, Dream Daddy but Dream Detective or whatever.
Thing is, we&#x27;ve got Sexy Young Holmes and Sexy Young Poirot, sure, but two dudes don&#x27;t make a dating sim, right? Why, ITV needs somewhere in the region of 35 fragile young adults to head-wreck every summer in Love Island. So who else would I need hot young versions of for my imaginary dating sim game?

The Everyone Is Here update went live yesterday, bringing new challenges to Motion Twin&#x27;s soulslike that will let you unlock characters from Blasphemous, Hyper Light Drifter, Guacamelee, Skul: The Hero Slayer, Curse Of The Dead Gods, and, most importantly (for me), Hollow Knight. Hooray for Hollow Knight content!

The company&#x27;s board of directors have formed this committee to oversee new policies and procedures &quot;to improve workplace culture and eliminate all forms of harassment and discrimination&quot;. And amidst calls for CEO Bobby Kotick to be removed, he&#x27;ll be one of the people in charge of bringing the committee progress reports.

The custom mode editor isn&#x27;t exactly swimming in creativity just yet, but interesting things are slowly beginning to emerge as time goes by. Like Andy&#x27;s Wingsuit Trainer, a course set among the clouds where you wing it through floating hoops as quickly as you can. Bravo Andy. Bravo.

                    <span>I doubt I’d be much cop at counting cards in Vegas, but I have just counted every single item on the patch notes for Precinct, the latest update for Romero Games’ prohibition-era kingpin sim Empire Of Sin. There are over 350 of them, from making gangsters less flirty to giving Al Capone his cigar back on the character select screen. It’s no act of Capone-worthy self-mythologising, then, when game director Brenda Romero describes the patch list to me as “monstrous”. 


“Once we put out the immediate flames, we prioritised feedback,” says Romero “Chris [King, senior systems designer]&#x27;s hair was fully black when we launched this game. It’s all gone fully grey. I think we were awesome on launch. Incredibly responsive. The team worked their asses off.”


Thankfully, the launch of the Make It Count DLC - and the accompanying free Precinct update - has been a lot smoother.

                    <span>This Friday is dubbed Black Friday in the USA because it&#x27;s a dark time, when people will literally be maimed or killed in the crush to buy cheap televisions. The lowest ebb of the year before Cyber Monday brings to the light of redemption to the world when kewl d00dz hackers hack the planet. But it does bring cheap video games. GOG have already started a small &quot;Pre-Black Friday sale&quot;, with good discounts including 50% off Disco Elysium and 50% off Cyberpunk 2077. Hmm. I might recommend it at that price?

                    <span>Riot Games&#x27; League of Legends fighting game, still known only as Project L, was shown off in much greater detail during this weekend&#x27;s Undercity Nights event, solidifying its genre, a few characters, and even its plans for online infrastructure. 
The video features executive producer Tom Cannon and technical lead Tony Cannon unveiling a verticle slice of what Project L will eventually offer. The title will remain a 2D fighting game set in the world of Runeterra, as was initially hinted towards when the game was revealed, but now we know it&#x27;ll feature 2-on-2 battles, and character assists will factor into the gameplay. &quot;We feel this is the right foundation to build a game that rewards strategic team building and on-the-fly decision making on top of strong fighting fundamentals,&quot; says the ex…</span>

                    <span>Dead Cells’ 26th update is assembling the best and brightest of the indie action adventure genre. The aptly named Everyone Is Here patch adds familiar faces from games like Hollow Knight and Guacamelee, along with their respective weapons, to use in-game.

The free update, which is now available on PC and comes consoles later this year, lets players don the costumes of the protagonists from Hollow Knight, Hyper Light Drifter, Blasphemous, Guacamelee!, Skul: The Hero Slayer, and Curse of the Dead Gods. Better yet, you’ll wield the weapons/ability of each character. They control largely as you’ll remember them but have a Dead Cells twist.

You wake up in a dark cabin, chained to a worn table. A mysterious man sits on the other side of the room. You can&#x27;t see the details of his face through the darkness, but his crazed eyes pierce the shadows. Something under your belly lurches as he invites you to play a card game. The rules seem simple; you summon creatures to attack your opponent&#x27;s army of foes, and you easily win the first few hands. Still, you can&#x27;t shake the anxiety of what might happen if – no – when you lose. You play on, the eyes on the other side of the table slowly burning a hole in your stomach.
Inscryption is an incredible tone piece that taps into horror …</span>

                    <span>This isn’t the first time we’ve read a Horizon Forbidden West blog post to see what Guerrilla Games has been up to. Not only is Aloy more dynamic and realistic-looking in this new chapter, she’ll also be exploring an immense map with its fair share of cutting-edge qualities. According to lead living world designer Espen Sogn, the dev team hopes that players will “encounter a world that feels more alive and more real than ever.” And knowing the impressive pedigree of Guerrilla Games, this will likely be the case.
The latest blog post states that designing Horizon Forbidden West’s sandbox was all about maintaining authenticity. This is primarily reflected in the cultural norms of the tribes that Aloy meets. Espen mentions two tribes and juxtaposes their customs to showcase the player’s posit…</span>

                    <span>Geoff Keighley’s annual Game Awards show is right around the corner – December 9 to be exact – and a new podcast leading up to the show will dive deep into all that goes into it. 
The Game Awards announced today that it is teaming up with music streaming service, Spotify, which will be its “exclusive audio streaming partner” for the show. It also revealed that leading up to it, a limited four-episode podcast called Inside The Game Awards will be released. 
“As part of the partnership, The Game Awards creator, executive producer, and host Geoff Keighley is hosting a special 4-episode Inside The Game Awards podcast, exclusively on Spotify beginning today, highlighting the latest news on the awards ceremony, including the incredible nominees for this year’s show, and a look at the musical elements of the show, including the return of The Game Awards Orchestra.” 
Spotify will also announce the “most listened to Spotify artists and songs” on gaming platforms globally in 2021 during the show. 
The first episode of Inside The Game Awards is now live, and the other three episodes are expected to drop leading up to the actual show on December 9. While waiting for those, read through the nominations for the Game Awards 2021. Check out Game Informer&#x27;s interview with Keighley about this year&#x27;s awards show after that.

                    <span>Hitman 3 has been out for nearly a year, and while its first year of content was expansive, Year 2 is shaping up to be just as big, if not bigger. 
IO Interactive, the developer behind Hitman 3 and the two Hitman games that came out before it, released a new blog post today detailing the game’s first year. IO revealed that Hitman 3 is the most successful Hitman game of all time and that its World of Assassination Trilogy has reached the milestone of 50 million players. It also revealed that Year 2 is starting in less than two months.

“Hitman 3 – Year 2 will start on [January 20, 2022] with post-launch support confirmed for another 12 months,” IO writes in the blog. “New maps, storylines, modes, and ways to play are all lined up for 2022, which is set to be another exciting year.” 
Also, coming to Hitman 3 next year is ray tracing on PC. Plus, PC VR support is coming in January, as is a new Elusive Target Arcade mode. 
“A new way to play Elusive Targets arrives in Hitman 3 in a brand new game mode that we’re calling Elusive Target Arcade,” the blog post reads. “Prepare to take on the ultimate Elusive Target challenge in a change to the established formula in this fan-favourite game mode. All Elusive Target Arcade content will be a permanent addition to the game. Full details on how this game mode works will be shared in early January 2022.”
The blog post ends with a “[REDACTED] update that states that IO has a “major update to the game planned” for Spring 2022. No other details were given, but the image below was included with it.

Since before the game even launched, fans of Marvel&#x27;s Avengers, specifically those on PlayStation, have anxiously waited for Spider-Man to swing into the adventure. Over a year later, Marvel&#x27;s flagship character finally arrives on November 30.

                    <span>Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition continues to be stuck between a rock and a hard place. Just one week after the highly-anticipated remasters released everywhere, Rockstar Games promised the originals would eventually be available on PC in an effort to calm angry fans. The Red Dead Redemption developer released a statement acknowledging that “the updated versions of these classic games did not launch in a state that meets our own standards of quality, or the standards our fans have come to expect.” Some players, however, are taking matters into their own hands. GTA Trilogy modders are working together to fix the game.
According to Gamespot, a bevy of issues that range from bizarre typos to immersion-breaking bugs have plagued all three GTA titles. But, as we already kn…</span>

                    <span>The Game Boy-like device known as the Analogue Pocket will finally ship out in three weeks. 
More specifically, the first batch of devices will begin shipping on December 13 and orders are expected to reach customers sometime between December 14 and December 30. This news comes after multiple delays for the Pocket, most of which occurred due to ongoing shipping struggles and chip shortages due to the global COVID-19 pandemic. 
If you preordered the Pocket, you should have received an email already from Analogue that states the Pocket will ship in three weeks. That email also includes information about delaying your order should you be out of town for the holidays when it’s delivered. 
“We understand that some of you will be away during the holiday season and would prefer delivery in the new year,” Analogue’s announcement reads. “With this in mind, we are offering to hold your package over the holiday period and start shipping on January 3. If you cannot accept delivery between December 14 and December 30, you should request a hold for your order.”
The final date to change your order is November 28, and Analogue says no changes can be made following that. The email you’ve received includes more instructions on how to go about those changes, if necessary. While waiting for your Pocket to ship, check out the various features it includes and the accessories that go with it.

                    <span>Kojima Productions is opening a new California-based business division that will focus on movies and television. 
It’s no secret that Kojima, the famed game director behind the Metal Gear Solid series and Death Stranding, is a fan of movies and TV. All it takes is one glance at his Instagram feed to realize that. His primary focus has always been games, but it seems his studio, Kojima Productions, is preparing for a shift to other entertainment mediums. 
“Today, I can finally confirm that Kojima Productions will be opening a new business division in California, USA,” division lead Riley Russell writes in a press release. “The new division will be tasked with working with creative and talented professionals in television, music, and film, as well as the more familiar games industry. The team has as its charter, the goal of expanding the reach and awareness of the properties now under development at Kojima Productions, and to make them even more a part of our popular culture.” 
Kojima Productions business development manager, Yoshiko Fukuda, says this new division will take the studio into new sectors to develop narratives beyond video games. 
As for what to expect first from this business division, that’s unclear, although Russell does mention that it will focus on expanding narratives outside of games based on games currently in development at the studio. Perhaps it’s cooking up a Death Stranding TV series, or maybe a film based on some game the studio is working on that hasn’t even been announced yet. Only time will tell. 
While waiting to learn more, check out Game Informer’s thoughts on Death Stranding and then read this story about why Death Stranding Director’s Cut is worth another trek across America.

Game Update 2 (about as big as Game Update 1) brings a slew of changes to many of the game’s systems alongside bug squashes and fixes, too. The two most notable changes coming to Deathloop by way of this update are that NPCs are a lot smarter now, and Colt will have a harder time avoiding Julianna during an invasion, as reported by Digital Trends.

The CEO told his colleagues he’d consider resigning if the countermeasures in place to combat the developers’ criminally-toxic workplace culture didn’t fix issues “with speed.” This news comes days after company shareholders called on Kotick to resign. Consequently, some of the executives that Kotick conferenced with last week emphasized that a number of staff members want him gone.

                    <span>The latest in Riot Games&#x27; numerous departures from MOBAs is a fighting game they&#x27;re calling Project L.

                    <span>Hitman 3 is the conclusion to IO Interactive’s sandbox homicidin’ trilogy, but the game itself still has plenty of life in it yet. In a new “Year 2” trailer, IO producer Hakan Abrak has teased some fresh additions coming in 2022, from new modes to PC-specific upgrades like ray tracing and VR support.

                    <span>Following the conclusion of Arcane on Friday, Riot Games and Netflix have confirmed that the animated series based on League Of Legends will indeed get a second season. The only detail they are willing to confirm right now is that the voice actors behind Vi, Jinx, and Caitlyn will return, and I have no idea if that constitutes a spoiler or not because I&#x27;ve only seen the first three episodes. Check out the teasing teaser trailer below.

                    <span>It&#x27;s that time of year again, folks. It&#x27;s the week in November when the sky grows dark, the ground trembles underfoot, and wallets are busted open in the never-ending search for the biggest and best Black Friday deals. You will likely be seeing a lot of these deals posts appearing on RPS over the coming week, but I promise you this one&#x27;s properly good - because it&#x27;s us that&#x27;s on sale rather than a fancy mouse, keyboard or headset.  
From now until November 30th, yearly subscriptions to RPS are 35% off for new subscribers - and all you need to do is head over to our sign up page to get started. No codes or secret password at the Treehouse door required.

                    <span>Rockstar have apologised for &quot;the unexpected technical issues&quot; in Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - Definitive Edition, saying the remastered versions of GTA 3, Vice City, and San Andreas did not launch in a state with meets their standards of quality. Probably shouldn&#x27;t have released them in that state, then. They say they plan to improve them, and did release a bug-fixing patch over the weekend. They will also put the original versions back on sale, and will give them to people who buy the remastered trilogy.

This sequel to the acclaimed Metroid Prime was released November 15, 2004 in the U.S. and upped the ante with Zelda-style dark world/light world exploration. Players traverse two versions of a labyrinthine map, solving puzzles that opened paths in the opposite dimension and enduring the damaging effects of the dark world. Samus faces off against Dark Samus for the first time, one of a series of challenging boss encounters that cemented Echoes as the most challenging entry in the Prime series – for better or worse. 
Join hosts Ben Reeves (@BenjaminReeves), Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), and Nintendo Ambassadors/Metroid fanatics Ky and Kyle Parker (@CaptDangerous64, @admiralboogaloo) for the next hour as we explore Metroid Prime 2&#x27;s lore, development history, and lasting impact.

                    <span>Radiohead&#x27;s surprising collaboration with Epic Games is out now. The Kid A Mnesia Exhibition is a virtual environment designed to accompany and celebrate Radiohead&#x27;s classic Kid A and Amnesiac albums. It&#x27;s an odd project, but it&#x27;s one that makes sense for a band that are often experimental and technologically progressive.

Then they&#x27;ve also made items and costumes available for Rocket League, Fall Guys and Fortnite, turning Radiohead into just another brand to be engaged with in Epic&#x27;s dull metaversal future.

                    <span>December is here, and you know what time that is: time for the RPS Advent Calendar. We&#x27;ll soon start counting down our favourite games of the year (well, counting in no particular order until we open that final door), but what will we pick? I know, because voting has just closed. If you think you can guess, do head on over to the RPS community Discord, where this year&#x27;s calendar guessing game is underway. But first, please do tell me: what are you playing this weekend?

                    <span>Black Friday is a time of excess, kicking off a season of even more excess. In that spirit, I’ve been thinking about buying four more of my current monitor and lashing them together into a makeshift array using rope fashioned from my corgi’s shed hair. There’s no way that I could achieve such an impressive display in any other way, certainly not with a single monitor. At least that’s what I thought, until hardware ed James reminded me that the humongous Samsung Odyssey G9 exists.

                    <span>Chums, I have a confession to make. For someone writing about Black Friday PC hardware deals, I don’t know all that much about PC hardware. Oh, I’ve been building my own PCs for 20-odd years, I just sort of ran out of storage in my brain around 2011 and now I have to spend ages reading up on the latest developments every time I need to buy a new component. If only I could just slot one of these Samsung 980 Pro SSDs into my brain, I would no longer have that problem.

                    <span>The holiday season, heralded by Black Friday, is often a time for reminiscing about the past. For instance, I remember a time, a few years either side of 2000/Y2K/The Willenium, when really big pockets were a thing. Particularly if you were a bit nu-metal or a bit goth. They were great. There’s nothing like walking down the street with your Gameboy banging against your knee. Sadly, as technology shrank faster and faster, so did trousers, until everyone was stuck with skinny jeans that you can’t even squeeze a bit of change into. It’s especially frustrating as I reckon you could happily fit the lovely Logitech G915 TKL Lightspeed Wireless into one of those big pockets.

You can perform violence upon new enemies too, because various Varangian forces have arrived to plunder the island.

It only came out scant weeks ago and it&#x27;s already on the sharp end of a meaningful discount. Not that I&#x27;m complaining, mind, as this Intel 12th Gen Alder Lake mid-ranger proved itself the best CPU for gaming immediately upon arrival.

                    <span>Slipping into a military-controlled ‘dark zone’ to plunder some high-end electrical equipment sounded like an easy job. You could be in and out in minutes, in theory, slinking through the locked-down multi-storey car park with a nice sequence of slides and skids to grab your treasure before vaulting a fence and scampering off. But there’s a problem: the lights are out, down in these concrete depths. The zombies are strong here. Special banshee-like screechers are primed to alert their undead brethren to the presence of any would-be intruders, prompting an unending wave of decaying meat to fling itself at you, all teeth and claws.


So this mission requires more finesse. You need to use all that agility and poise you’ve mastered in Dying Light 2’s impressive parkour &#x27;n&#x27; puching open-world city, sure, but you also need to layer more skills on top of that, cherry-picked from the new toolkit Techland has provided.

                    <span>For all the loathsome talk of the metaverse from companies like Facebook and Epic as the future of reality, many facets of the concept already exist in sandboxes like Roblox. The problem with Roblox for them is that it&#x27;s a lawless frontier town, one they don&#x27;t control. Still, Roblox is obscenely popular, so it&#x27;s popular with brands who don&#x27;t need control, they just want to advertise products. Enter Nikeland, an official Roblox game from the cobblers at Nike.

                    <span>I’ve spent some more time with FPS Battlefield 2042, having freed myself from EA’s vice grip. And it’s safe to say the fields of battle have taken on a vastly different complexion now it’s largely in the hands of many more players. Compared to my three-night imprisonment alongside other journos and influencers, my feelings have definitely levelled out.
The honeymoon period is over, basically. My relationship with the game in the real world, outside of EAs strict boundaries has lessened. I’m sorry to say it, but we’ve grown apart. Things are average between us, and perhaps only Portal, the game’s custom mode creator, can salvage things.

                    <span>Arkane&#x27;s sneak-o-shooter Deathloop is a good game, but maybe not quite as stealthy as you might expect from the studio behind Dishonored. Even our Deathloop review said &quot;stealth is just the thing that goes wrong before a good fight&quot;. Well, you might want to be a bit sneakier now, as the game&#x27;s second major update has arrived and it makes NPCs a fair bit smarter. The patch addresses some common complaints about the PvP Invasion mode too.

                    <span>As the nights grow colder and we seek the warm, sweaty embrace of a VR headset to while away our evenings with, HTC have kicked off their Black Friday deals early this year with a whole week of deals on their various Vive headsets. There are savings of up to £250 to be had here across all of their Vive headsets, including the full Vive Cosmos and Cosmos Elite kits, and their eye-tracking Vive Pro Eye.

                    <span>Within 60 seconds I was dead and laughing. Halo Infinite&#x27;s multiplayer is a finely tuned mechanism for delivering explosions and dopamine. Developers 343 Industries did whatever the opposite of a jumpscare is this week, delighting deathmatch dilly-dalliers with a surprise release of their classical arena shooter. It&#x27;s a beta, they insist. But we all know it&#x27;s the proper game because they&#x27;ve had their betas already (excuse me, &quot;flights&quot;). 
Also, look, this thing is impeccable. Clean, powerful shots trace across immaculate skyboxes, straight into the shining dome of your armoured clunkperson, with a frightening thud that is satisfying even in death. There are problems, of course, but most reside outside the actual shootouts, which are frenetic, zappy confrontations longtime Halo players will savour.

                    <span>During Battlefield 2042&#x27;s week of early access for people who paid extra, players were more forgiving of bugs and wonk with the expectation that it would be fixed by a launch patch. Well, the game is out today, the launch patch has hit, and the game is still in a bit of a state. 78% of the 5500-odd player reviews on Steam are negative right now, with many complaining about crashes, poor performance, and more. Dice have said they plan to launch two patches in the next month.

                    <span>Back when Black Friday was only just revving up its deals engines, I asked you – the lovely RPS readership – to tell us about your hardware. And it turns out that just like in 2019, your collective favourite gaming mouse is the Logitech G502. Truly, a timeless classic of clicks and scrolls.


Of course, the G502 has come in a few different flavours, but you can now get one of the most recent models at the lowest price it’s ever been (at least in the UK). Amazon has the Logitech G502 SE Hero for £34: an entire pound less than the standard G502 Hero has ever dipped to, most recently during Prime Day 2021. 


US denizens aren’t missing out either, as the G502 SE Hero is $33 at Best Buy in their own Black Friday sale. That’s not quite as cheap as its all-time low of $28, but its still a very good price on a very good mouse. The G502 SE Hero is essentially the classic G502 Hero with some white go-faster stripes – there’s been no funny business making adverse changes to keep the costs down.

Chances are you already know what you&#x27;re getting with each new iteration of Civ, however, whereas committing to an entirely new 4X can feel like a large risk.

Enter Humankind&#x27;s new 100-turn demo, available now.

If you want to spend more time in its world, with its story and characters but without the puzzles (or space-sailing), then good news: Heaven&#x27;s Vault is now available as a two volume novel from Jon Ingold, the original game&#x27;s narrative director.

                    <span>I had my first eggnog latte of the year yesterday, which means that like Black Friday, the actual holiday season is officially upon us. I’m sorry, I don’t make the rules. For many of us, me included, that means stuffing our faces with delicious treats like we’re in training for Fat Bear Week. What&#x27;s your favourite? Mine&#x27;s the 
lebkuchen hearts with apricot filling, plus anything with marzipan.
The point I’m trying to get to is that this isn’t really a slim and sexy time of year for me. More of a fat and cuddly (but still sexy) season. On the other hand, this Alienware m15 R4 gaming laptop is both slim and sexy, as well as a full $500 off in Dell&#x27;s early Black Friday sales.

                    <span>It&#x27;s been a few weeks since I came down on the side of basically liking Age Of Empires 4. Lukewarm praise, perhaps, but it seems to be doing well, and that makes me glad. We&#x27;ve needed an RTS revival for ages, right? And this one is good, if a bit safe.
For the last few weeks I&#x27;ve been puzzling over the lingering feeling that it could have been more ambitious. Why do I think it could have pushed the trireme out further? Is it possible to make a modern RTS that captures the best of the classics without simply rehashing them? Has it even been done already and gone unrecognised?

On November 30th, Mojang will give the game&#x27;s mountains and caves a makeover, adding new sub-biomes and letting folks explore deeper than before. I&#x27;m very much looking forward to the new Lush Cave biomes, which are gonna be full of vines, moss and pretty blossoms. I reckon that would make a lovely location for an underground home.

                    <span>Warner Bros. today announced a Smash Bros-style platformer fighter of their own, throwing characters from across their many series and franchises into one big rumble. In MultiVersus, you can expect to see Shaggy from Scooby Doo teaming up with Steven Universe to battle actual killers like Harley Quinn and Arya Stark, and more. It&#x27;s due to launch in 2022, and will be free-to-play. Check out the trailer below.

                    <span>I can&#x27;t remember why I picked this theme, but for this episode of The Electronic Wireless Show podcast I wanted to talk about AI characters - as in, characters that are, in game, an artificial intelligence of some kind. This definition does cause some trouble. After all, is not every character in a game that isn&#x27;t player controlled an AI character, fn fn fn?
No, because you all know what I mean and so does Nate. Matthew doesn&#x27;t, know, and had prepared a list of just, companion characters. Don&#x27;t worry, he actually pulls out some really good examples. We talk about a lot of games this week, not least because I didn&#x27;t prepare a Cavern Of Lies again. Sorry. There is also a lot of talk about clones, and what Matthew would do with clones of himself (e.g. shove them out of an airlock).

                    <span>Supercars are boring. That one on Forza Horizon 5’s front cover? Don’t care how fast it goes, mate. Oh, goes from 1 to 60 in 2.7 seconds does it? Yeah, well, that&#x27;s how long it takes to prepare this knuckle sandwich. No, but seriously, they’re all the same to me: just wedges of carbon fibre with wheels. I’m sure the engineering is marvelous and the innovation groundbreaking. But let’s be honest, in videogames they’re virtually all the same.
My Forza Horizon 5 fantasy doesn’t involve Lamborghinis or Ferraris. In fact, it’s the complete opposite of opulence. Mexico’s roads are for me and my mundane companions. The Volvo Estate, the Ford Focus, the Honda Civic. The everyday vehicles that make up for their lack of speed with heaps of character. I just wish there were more to choose from.

                    <span>Undungeon is a peculiar action RPG set at the end of the universe, in which you play an immortal herald called Void who has been pieced together by God themselves using a primordial stew of hot organs, conscious essence and wet rib cages. Something very complicated has happened to reality, and you’re here to fix it with your swooshing Freddy Kreuger claws and clever dialogue choices. 


I’m still not entirely sure what Undungeon is about. The characters, a cast of hovering orbs, corrupted flesh angels and crystal beings, repeatedly try to explain what’s going on, but it never quite sinks in. Collapsing dimensions are causing no end of trouble, that’s pretty clear, shattering into an infinite number of spinning shards that rain like an exotic meteor shower over a scorched wasteland inhabited by nomadic technomancers and acid-spitting scorpions. You’re sent down to the dusty mortal plane to plug everything back in again and reset the multiverse, like an interdimensional BT engineer.

                    <span>If you&#x27;ve been struggling with crashes or online stability in Forza Horizon 5, it&#x27;s probably worth updating your game. Last night, Playground Games released a patch for the new open-world race &#x27;em up, fixing a number of crashes that can occur when upgrading cars or spawning traffic, and improving stability for Horizon Life (the game&#x27;s online component). This hotfix was supposed to arrive last week, but better late than never.

                    <span>Yesterday, I reported that 343 Industries were looking into Halo Infinite&#x27;s battle pass progression, which players have found overwhelmingly slow so far. Our very own Ed Thorn played for four hours, only to reach battle pass level 3 the other night. Thankfully, the developers have already detailed a handful of changes coming this week that should improve things - from adding new, easier challenges, to removing some of the rubbish weeklies players don&#x27;t like.

                    <span>Despite my interest in pirates, piracy is probably the least interesting thing about Sea Of Thieves. It&#x27;s not just its excellent ocean that I want to enjoy without pointless random murder. It&#x27;s the sailing. The thrill of moving around and operating this vehicle, hearing it creak as you turn a wheel, and whoosh as you catch the wind.
Sailwind is all about that. You sail a boat. Nobody will attack you. There are no monsters to fight, or guilds to appease. It&#x27;s just you, the sea, and the skills that will take your boat across it well enough that you don&#x27;t starve on the way.

Are the tiny computer people who write all the information down on the hard disks inside your PC old and tired? Yeah, mine too. Well, I have good news! The superb Samsung 870 Qvo 2TB SSD is the cheapest it’s ever been here in the UK.

Then, Hextech Mayhem is a cute-looking rhythm runner.

                    <span>If you haven’t heard, we&#x27;re in the middle of an indiepocalypse. It’s probably not the kind you’re thinking of; it doesn’t spell doom for the independent games scene. This one is a monthly compilation of games all in one conveniently packaged digital zine, from a variety of diverse creators. That Indiepocalypse. 


Indiepocalypse is composed of 10 games every month, one of which has been commissioned by Editor in Chief Andrew Baillie personally. Started in February 2020, the zine has already managed to rack up 22 issues, as well as one bonus issue. You never know what you’re going to get from one issue to the next, each one platforming small games that likely wouldn’t succeed elsewhere. There’s no exclusivity clause either, meaning developers are free to do what they want with their games outside of the zine. Most importantly, every developer included is paid. Baillie spoke to me about how and why Indiepocalypse started.

But a lot of players have one major grievance: the battle pass is a massive grind. Complaints about challenges that award very little XP are all over the game&#x27;s subreddit. Fortunately, the devs have seen this feedback, and are already looking into the slow progression.

                    <span>There’s something about Call Of Duty: Vanguard and its multiplayer modes that feels thin. Much like my time with the game’s campaign, I’m left wanting. This is a World War II veneer glossed over a Modern Warfare canvas, with familiar pacing and shooting, but ultimately lacking the weight of Infinity Ward’s reboot.
As a Call Of Duty multiplayer experience, Vanguard delivers. But what it delivers is a stop-gap. An FPS experience that isn’t concerned with pushing the series forwards, or taking risks. Fans will have fun, sure, but its deathmatches and dominations are stuck in the past. Not to mention Zombies, which is too eager to turn back the clock.

The Wall Street Journal even claim that Kotick himself had allegedly threatened to have someone killed. This is the second walkout workers have held this year following the first lawsuit that made allegations of widespread discrimination and harassment.
