Now, Sony has not only pulled back the curtain on its new PlayStation Portal remote play device, but two new audio devices it’s releasing for PS5. 
The wireless earbuds revealed earlier this summer are called PlayStation Pulse Explore wireless earbuds and provide “a premium portable audio experience with dual microphones and AI-enhanced noise rejection capable of filtering background sounds” with lossless audio and a charging case. They will cost $199.99. 

The new over-the-ears headset revealed today is called the PlayStation Pulse Elite wireless headset and it offers lossless audio and comes with a retractable boom mi…</span>

                              <span>Earlier this summer, PlayStation revealed a dedicated handheld remote play device that puts one half of a DualSense controller on each side of an LCD screen. However, it stopped short of revealing its name or a price. Today, PlayStation has revealed it’s called the PlayStation Portal and will cost $199.99 when it’s released later this year.

The PlayStation Portal remote player includes the features you’d expect from a DualSense controller like adaptive triggers and haptic feedback. But wedged between the two controller halves is an 8-inch LCD screen capable of 1080p/60FPS playback. PlayStation says the device is “for gamers in households where they might need to share their living room TV or simply want to play PS5 games in another room of the house.” 
The PlayStation Portal will connect remotely to your PS5 over Wi-FI, and can play supported games installed on your console. The device includes a 3.5mm audio jack for wired audio, although the new PlayStation Pulse Elite headset and Pulse Explore earbuds (and the already existing Pulse headset) will connect to it wirelessly via new technology the company is calling PlayStation Link. You can read more about these two new audio devices here. 

PSVR2 games, which require the headset, and games streamed through PlayStation Plus Premium’s cloud streaming are not supported, however. 
PlayStation Portal will launch later this year for $199.99. There’s no release date yet for the device, but PlayStation says it will have more details soon on when preorders begin.</span>

This summer’s announcement of Mortal Kombat 1 brought with it a new era for the long-running fighting franchise. The latest game from NetherRealm Studios brings the outstanding fighting mechanics the series has been known for since the 2011 reboot, but adds layers of complexity. The most notable addition to the core mechanics in this entry is perhaps the Kameo feature, where you can bring in a secondary character to perform a quick move at a crucial time in a fight. But as I learned during my final time seeing the game before launch, during w…</span>

                              <span>The Steam Deck comes with a beautiful 1280x800 LCD screen, and you can have an anti-glare filter slapped onto it if you buy the premium 512GB version. For those who aren’t satisfied, there’s the DeckHD screen which boasts a 1920x800 resolution and promises to deliver more vibrant colors.
After going on sale, the aftermarket screen replacement sold out within 5 minutes. The possibilities are exciting, and the Steam Deck is designed to be easily disassembled, though owners of the handheld should proceed with caution if they intend on making such modifications.

                              <span>As of writing, Starfield is just two weeks away from release. Will the long wait finally pay off? We don&#x27;t know, but until we get our collective hands on it, you can scope out this new live action trailer for Bethesda&#x27;s upcoming sci-fi RPG.
Accompanied by a more &quot;floaty&quot; and orchestral version of Elton John&#x27;s &quot;Rocket Man&quot; (because of course), the footage shows a heroic-looking astronaut who gifts a young girl a badge bearing the Starfield logo.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;Ek3I6_9c58E
He then jettisons off into space, flying among the cosmos, hope and awe in his eyes. Then some brief pew-pew-pew-ing before he finds himself touching grass (or...dust, in this case) on a new planet.
I would have chosen Babylon Zoo&#x27;s &quot;Spaceman,&quot; personally
As if Starfield needed any more hype. This is Bethesda&#x27;s newest IP in 25 years, and it&#x27;s easily one of the most anticipated video games of this generation. While there&#x27;s already been some criticism towards the game&#x27;s main menu, many are excited about Starfield.
Still, this live action trailer does have a certain &quot;epic&quot; quality about it, if you&#x27;ll pardon the cliché. If nothing else, it gives Microsoft a chance to flex its Big Budget muscles.
If, for some reason, you haven&#x27;t committed the date to memory, Starfield will be launching on September 6 for Xbox Series X|S exclusive and PC.

                              <span>When playing through Pikmin 4, I generally didn&#x27;t want to stop. The joy of treasure hunting, discovering new areas, and taking breaks to hang out at the home base (or go on Castle Defense-esque night missions) was too enticing: and now its existence has spawned a real-life treasure hunter.
A self-described &quot;clay artist with a love of Pikmin,&quot; Twitter user ZatchMehr is trying to eventually locate and acquire every in-game Pikmin 4 treasure in real life. They&#x27;ve noted that they started their quest roughly three days after the game came out, and it&#x27;s taken them about a month to get this far.
If you&#x27;re curious, they&#x27;ve even been chronicling their journey with tweets of individual collections, in a near 1:1 recreation of the in-game collection screenshots:
Recreation Collection
Hands of Fate
The Rescue Command Post tutorial
Newly Nostalgic
As a reminder Pikmin 4 has 239 treasures (that are uniquely designed): so there&#x27;s still a ways to go.
https://twitter.com/ZatchMehr/status/1694121307129127421
How many treasures do you have?
In terms of the electronic stuff, I own that exact Wavebird, the small Game and Watch portable, the GameCube Wave Race disc, the SNES mouse, the red/blue Switch Joy-Con set, and that blue GBA SP. It was a blast going through Pikmin 4 and pointing at the screen like that Leo meme: the idea of collecting Earthly &quot;treasures&quot; during your adventure is genius.
The attention to detail is impressive, as some of these items are exact replicas, and many come as close as humanly possible without resorting to making a Pikmin-specific Etsy store. As for the food items, ZatchMehr explains that &quot;fake fruit comes in clutch,&quot; so don&#x27;t worry about it spoiling!

                              <span>Nightdive Studios has been hard at work bringing us remasters and remakes of classic FPS games from a bygone era. We&#x27;ve already had revamped versions of the first two Quake games, and now the developer is bringing back Star Wars: Dark Forces.
In a recent trailer on the studio&#x27;s YouTube channel, Nightdive will be collaborating with Lucasfilm Games (formerly LucasArts) to create a remaster of the mid-90&#x27;s Star Wars title.
https://youtu.be/4b9TTurkH4c
The trailer (which demonstrates alpha footage) shows off some of the work so far. You&#x27;ll definitely want to check out the renewed cut scenes. Much like previous projects done by Nightdive, it&#x27;ll still look and feel like Dark Forces, but will be given a modern lift with 4K visuals, plus &quot;advanced 3D rendering, modern gamepad support, trophies and achievements, and more.&quot;
The (dark) force is strong in this one
The original game was released all the way back in 1995, and was the first in the Jedi Knight series. It was developed on the aptly named Jedi engine, which is a toolkit that shares similarities with Build, the engine that powered the likes of Duke Nukem 3D and Shadow Warrior. Nightdive&#x27;s remaster of the ancient Star Wars game will utilize the KEX engine instead, which the studio has used in a number of projects, including for the Quake remaster.
We recently got treated to a modern version of Quake 2, which improved the graphics (particularly in the lighting department) while also adding quality-of-life changes and the DLC.
At the moment, we don&#x27;t know when Star Wars: Dark Forces will be coming out, but it&#x27;s set to release on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC.

                              <span>Nightdive Studios has announced that the N64 version of Turok 3: Shadow of Oblivion will be among the next games to get the remaster treatment. Not only that, it already has a release date of November 14 and is coming to PC and consoles.
Originally released in 2000, Turok 3: Shadow of Oblivion was an interesting turn for Acclaim’s Turok series. It really shows the awkward evolution of the first-person shooter genre in the wake of 1998’s Half-Life. While the first two games were largely just fast-paced key-hunting games like early FPS, Turok 3: Shadow of Oblivion incorporated more story elements and cutscenes. It involved two would-be Turoks trying to fight back against an encroaching threat in the wake of Joshua Fireseed’s apparent death.
https://youtu.be/SdCaj5ZRp-A
It’s the last numbered Turok entry and, really, the last good one. The level design kind of gets mired in the muddy brown industrial look of the late ‘90s, and the action isn’t as swift as the earlier titles. A lot of the real Turok identity gets lost in the pursuit of gaming trends. Despite that, it’s an interesting early-3D game.
While Nightdive previously remastered the first two Turok games, a rerelease of Shadow of Oblivion wasn’t guaranteed. The first two titles already had PC ports that the studio could work off of, whereas Turok 3 never left the N64. However, since they were able to “reverse engineer” and provide the N64 campaign of Quake 2, I had hoped that they put in the effort because they were working on a port to Turok 3. And sure enough…
Does this mean we&#x27;ll get Turok: Rage Wars someday?
Turok 3: Shadow of Oblivion is getting the KEX Engine treatment. Nightdive is boasting a lot of the same enhancements that the Quake 2 remaster received, including real-time lighting and updated models. It’s coming to PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch on November 14.

                              <span>Persona 5 Tactica continues a fascinating tradition of Persona spinoffs that want to break you into new genres.
It wasn’t until I sat down to write this that I realized how wild the Persona brand has gotten. I mean sure, every big brand has to have a Musou eventually. And you can see the RPG throughline that connects Persona with the Etrian Odyssey-style Persona Q. But a fighting game set in the Persona universe? A collection of rhythm games based on Persona soundtracks? The crazy part is, no matter what direction Persona spinoffs take, they always seem to land strong and find fans. Heck, I know a guy who’s chomping at the bit for a Persona 5 fighting game, even though he’s since graduated to fighters like Guilty Gear and Street Fighter.
I say all this to set the stage for what kind of gam…</span>

                              <span>Persona 3 Reload proved to me just how much Persona 3 has needed a remake.
Originally released in 2006 (2007 in North America), Persona 3 marks the start of the “modern” Persona series. Sure, the first games featured students summoning demons like they’re Pokémon.

                              <span>Baldur’s Gate 3 is the biggest D&amp;D video game the world has ever seen. It has brought countless new players to the genre, many of whom likely got absolutely hooked and have already done everything there is to do in the game — despite that likely requiring up to 200 hours of playtime. If you&#x27;re one of these heroes, maybe you could find some use in a list of masterpieces of old and new that capture the same magic as 2023&#x27;s biggest game.

But references to Remedy’s past games have been the big conversation driver, especially since the studio is building up a “Remedy Connected Universe.” Creative director Sam Lake has now clarified that time-bending shooter Quantum Break and the Max Payne games aren’t cool enough to join the Remedy-verse, while also breaking down their approach to these shared-world games.

The immersive sim playground, sequel to an RPS favourite from 2019, looks even more over-the-top than the original. You can smash through buildings in a truck. Or smash through buildings on horseback. Or smash through buildings as a giant gorilla. Or... you get the gist. In other words, there should be a metric mega-ton of options when the game hits early access next year, as you&#x27;d expect if you played the first Streets Of Rogue.

                              <span>Tencent are bringing back NovaLogic&#x27;s venerable tactical FPS series Delta Force. Created by Shenzen-based TiMI Studios, who have now acquired the IP from THQ Nordic, the new Delta Force will be a free-to-play military-realist PvP shooter set on destructible maps featuring driveable vehicles and aircraft, with dynamic weather and a variety of enemy factions and classes. It&#x27;ll launch in 2024 across PC, consoles and mobile, and will support crossplay.


The original Delta Force launched in 1998, which was a busy year for videogames: it saw the release of Half-Life, Starcraft, Thief: The Dark Project, Baldur&#x27;s Gate, Fallout 2 and Grim Fandango, together with Zelda: Ocarina of Time and Metal Gear Solid on the console side. I&#x27;m not sure Delta Force can hold a candle to any of those, but it had a decent critical reception and attracted enough fans to spawn a fairly staggering number of sequels. It stands apart in my memory mostly for its huge draw distances and its corresponding emphasis on long-distance firefights.

                              <span>Revealed last night at Gamescom 2023&#x27;s Opening Night Live, we now know that Little Nightmares 3 is indeed a thing, coming in 2024. It&#x27;s being made by Supermassive Games, who specialise in horror games (although not quite the same as the nitty-gritty childhood terrors style of Little Nightmares). Following the trajectory of the previous two games, Little Nightmares the third has two controllable protagonists, so you can play in co-op. It also has a tie-in podcast, to build out some of the Little Nightmares lore, a thing you might not have known existed.

                              <span>Blizzard tonight announced that Diablo 4&#x27;s second season, named Season Of Blood, will begin on the 17th of October. Given that the first season is uninteresting, I&#x27;m not super fussed about that. What does sound good is quality-of-life changes coming alongside the new season. For starters, your inventory will no longer become clogged with six billion gems. Season Of Blood will also let you pick specific Unique and Uber Unique items to farm bosses for, which is most welcome given how vital Uniques can be for builds. Here, watch the trailer.

                              <span>Geoffcom 2023 has crested its initial crescendous wave with Gamescom Opening Night Live. The yearly gaming show has delivered its usual tantalising (and sometimes baffling) smorgasbord of videogame announcements, trailers, updates, news, and more. And now we’ve got a much better idea of what games to expect over the course of the next, oh, seven hundred years.
Below we’ve compiled an exhaustive (oh so exhaustive) list of all 36 trailers and announcements shown at this year’s Gamescom Opening Night Live, so if you want a roundup of everything you missed, you’re in the right place. Deep breaths everyone. And away we go.

This week, the company filed a lawsuit against a group of online stores that sell pirated DVDs of key titles such as &#x27;The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power&#x27; and &#x27;The Peripheral&#x27;. While these DVDs may look real they are definitely pirated, as these series are only available on Amazon Prime.

                              <span>Over a long beer and some (Ed: very crispy, hotel) cheeseburgers, Katharine and I tuned into this year&#x27;s Gamescom Opening Night Live having just arrived at our hotel. Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 3&#x27;s campaign reveal happened to be on, and I predicted it would feature three things: darkness, rain, and goggles. I was right! Even though there was mention of more &quot;open ended&quot; COD missions, the one shown certainly seemed like any vintage, largely linear COD level.

                              <span>As Geoff Keighley continues to use his gaming shows to parade his menagerie of film star friends, this year&#x27;s sacrifice was Batman vs Superman director Zack Snyder, who was mainly wheeled out at tonight&#x27;s Gamescom Opening Night Live show to promote his new pair of sci-fi Netflix films - which, oh, by the way, also have a game attached to them. And thus, a new Snyderverse is born. Not that they showed us said game, mind, or really told us anything about it. It will be set after both Rebel Moon films, though, so you better get watching if you want to know what the hell is going on. Honestly, did we learn nothing from Final Fantasy 15&#x27;s failed multimedia project mistakes?

                              <span>It&#x27;s rare for a game to have showy tech which is more than skin-deep and actually enables new types of play. Sure, the dynamic mud of driving sim Spintires was impressive to look at, and it also gave us a game where driving two metres through a puddle could become a serious puzzle. So I&#x27;m certainly interested in today&#x27;s announcement of Expeditions: A MudRunner Game, this time sending us off-roading to conduct science. Well, if the mud doesn&#x27;t blind me, the science surely will.

                              <span>The misfits-on-a-road-trip genre arguably began bloody ages ago, it&#x27;s true, but I think it&#x27;s really been building momentum over the last few years with stuff like Signs Of The Sojourner, Hitchhiker, and even Road 96. Red Thread Games, who made Draugen (a horror game I liked quite a bit), are adding to the list with Dustborn, a single-player action-adventure with a heavy lean towards story, which was revealed at this year&#x27;s Gamescom Opening Night Live.
You play Pax, a pregnant con-artist on the run transporting an important package across the Northern border of what appears to be an authoritarian, dystopian USA. And you tell me this is in no way related to Road 96? Well, alright. Dustborn is being published by Quantic Dream, so I feel dutybound to make fun of it. No. Must... resist...

                              <span>Cyberpunk 2077 expansion Phantom Liberty releases on September 26th. It continues the story of V and her sidekick, imaginary sweary Keanu Reeves, but it also overhauls skills, perks, car chases, police and more.

You can watch some of the updates in action in a new trailer shown during tonight&#x27;s Gamecom Geoffstravaganza, but the exciting bit is that several of those overhauls are also coming to the base game in a free 2.0 update,

                              <span>Across years of updates and new missions, Payday 2 ultimately escalated to such a ridiculous degree that the gang broke into the White House to stole pre-signed Presidential pardons for themselves. It was good ridiculousness. Now Payday 3 is on its way, and the cooperative heisting looks far more down-to-Earth in a new trailer fresh out of Gamescom.

Not too far away from 2023’s punch-a-thon, though, and to tide us over, publisher Bandai Namco dropped a brand new trailer at Gamescom’s Opening Night Live. Bears, arcades, and lots of kicking down below.

The Geoffcom mega show also revealed there&#x27;s a new mage class called the Runemaster heading to the game next month that&#x27;s capable of casting 40 different spells on a single attack key, but given this is the first time we&#x27;ve written about Last Epoch, I realise that probably won&#x27;t mean much to a lot of you. So let&#x27;s back up a bit and introduce Last Epoch properly, because hoo boy, if you love customisable skill trees, this is the ARPG for you, my friend.

                              <span>Mark your calendars for November 17th, strategy fans, as that&#x27;s when Warhammer Age Of Sigmar: Realms Of Ruin is heading to PC - the same day as Atlus&#x27; Persona 5 Tactica, don&#x27;t you know? Announced at tonight&#x27;s Gamescom Opening Night Live show, Frontier Developments also showed off the game&#x27;s new single-player Conquest mode, a procedurally generated series of challenges that will pit players against increasingly unpredictable combat scenarios, as well as its third playable faction: the wraith-like Nighthaunt. They&#x27;ll be going up against the Stormcast Eternals alongside the Orruk Kruleboyz in the game&#x27;s campaign, and I got to see them in action ahead of tonight&#x27;s showcase. And I can confirm: they&#x27;re a nasty bunch of spectral rags, this lot, especially when they pile on in large numbers.

Hence, though I have absolutely no interest whatsoever in open world survival crafting games like yer Valheims and what have you, I cocked my head like a dazzled magpie at the Gamescom release date trailer for Nightingale. It&#x27;s the chintzy big swing fantasy (okay, Victoriana urban fantasy but it still counts) coming from Aaryn Flynn-founded studio Inflexion Games. And it&#x27;s coming to an early access release near you on February 22nd next year.

                              <span>If you&#x27;ve been keeping an eye on Stormgate, the upcoming free-to-play RTS being made by former Starcraft II and Warcraft III devs, then its big bads, the Infernal Host, will probably be familiar in name, if nothing else. But during tonight&#x27;s Gamescom Opening Night Live show, we got our first proper look at this demonic alien faction, as well as three of the units that will be at our disposal on release. And sure, the worker Imp and its long ears will no doubt appease the Grogu fans out there, but my personal highlight is the creepy flesh monster, the Brute. It looks rightly horrific, with its pair of grinning maws and glistening, pale skin, but at the tap of a key, it will rip itself down the middle in a mess of blood and gore so that two Fiends can burst forth Alien-style to continue the assault. It&#x27;s kinda gross, but also weirdly rad? In any case, I&#x27;m into it.

                              <span>Cooperative horror FPS series Killing Floor will return for another monster mash (hopefully it&#x27;ll be a graveyard smash) in Killing Floor 3, developers Tripwire Interactive announced today. Sadly they&#x27;ve said little about the game and shown even less but yup, once again you and your pals will get to fight through hordes of wacky bioengineered monsters. Honestly, science was a mistake. Isaac Downtown and his pal Harry Stottle owe us all an apology.

Interesting stuff all around. Take a peek below.

                              <span>LG&#x27;s 27GL850 was a legendary monitor, as this 27-inch model was the first to use the Korean chaebol&#x27;s Fast IPS panels - which combined the extremely fast pixel response times you&#x27;d expect to see on TN panels with the wide viewing angles and gorgeous colours of IPS screens. This combination proved popular, and today there&#x27;s a deal on the modern successor to the 27GL850 - the 27GP850. 
The 27GP850 is down to $299.99 at Amazon, versus an original price of $429.99. We saw a lot of sales on the 1440p 144Hz 27GL850 when it reached this price, so seeing an even better 1440p 180Hz model at the same point could result in quite a popular pickup.

                              <span>Bandai Namco brought some news to this year&#x27;s Gamescom 2023 Geoff Fest show that was very exciting for me, personally. Though it was but a short teaser trailer, we now know that Little Nightmares 3 is coming next year - and it&#x27;s a co-op game that you can play with your pals. Good for moral support with a creepy horror game, although it&#x27;s online co-op, so don&#x27;t expect anyone to literally hold your hand. Also, and this is kind of unexpected, but there&#x27;s a podcast tie-in.

That makes it an awesome choice for a full-fat gaming PC, and today you can pick up this top performer for just $385 at Amazon USA - with a free copy of Starfield included.

It&#x27;s one of those live-action affairs with CG up the wazoo, complete with an &#x27;epic&#x27; cover of Elton John&#x27;s Rocket Man that would bring a tear to the eye of Zack Snyder*, and only Zack Snyder. It does not show the game at all, nor does it capture the thrill of escaping our Earthly bonds to find a load of grey rocks just like we have at home. But you can watch the trailer below.

                              <span>Out of all of Supergiant’s games, I feel like Pyre is the odd duck out. Bastion, Transistor, and Hades - all fit nicely into the action-RPG genre (as well as all being absolute bangers) but Pyre is something else entirely. Sure it also has action-RPG elements, but also is a story-rich visual novel and sports game? And they not only work together but also compliment each other?? It’s a magical wizardry mix of genres that still feels fresh today, even though it’s been five years since it released. It’s story following a group of ethereal exiles playing fantasy sports ball in mystical purgatory isn’t half bad too (by which I mean it’s amazing).
The rules of the sport are simple - two teams are placed at opposite ends of a pitch each with a flame  (the titular pyre) they must protect. An energy ball appears on the map and the two teams must grab the ball and dunk it into the opponent’s flame until that flame has been snuffed out. Each character has a special ability, movement feels good, and when you pull off a combo you feel fantastic.

                              <span>Developer Sad Cat Studios have delayed their debut cyberpunk platformer Replaced into 2024, because they “can’t afford to release a sub-par game.” The Belarusian-based studio previously pushed the game from 2022 into 2023 due to the ongoing war in Ukraine, but based on its moody retrofuturist trailers I’m happy to wait until every pixel is perfectly positioned, as long as the teams are staying safe.


“After Replaced&#x27;s initial announcement in 2021 and its follow-up trailer in 2022 we had this incredibly high bar of community&#x27;s expectations,” the studio wrote in a recent Steam blog. “And at this point, we knew that we can&#x27;t afford to release a sub-par game. We truly want Replaced to be something special and memorable for everybody. This is our first game, and we want to make every aspect of it the best it can be.”

                              <span>As with Half-Life 2 RTX, Nvidia have taken to Gamescom to make a heap of DLSS announcements. Chief among these is an upcoming new version, DLSS 3.5, which will add to DLSS 3’s existing toolkit of upscaling and AI frame generation with a new trick named Ray Reconstruction. And it sounds pretty clever, if currently limited in application.

                              <span>Nvidia are making an early start on their Gamescom announcements, which include the reveal of Half-Life 2 RTX. This incoming mod for the seminal 2004 FPS will, in the style of Portal with RTX, rejig the original game with modern technical goodies like ray tracing, updated environmental details, and Nvidia Reflex support. DLSS will also be on hand to absorb the inevitably mahoosive performance hit from bouncing all those rays around, and that includes DLSS 3, provided you have a compatible graphics card.
It’s being developed by a collective of experienced HL2 modders, Orbifold Studios, without direct input from Valve. No release date yet, as Half-Life 2 RTX – or to use its full name, Half-Life 2 RTX: An RTX Remix Project – is still in the early stages. There is a teaser trailer, though.

Fortnite skins based on Mexican comedy shows from the 1970s? Pentiment characters in mediaeval strategy Inkulinati? Okay, that last one makes sense. But now, a team-up between management game Cult Of The Lamb and co-op survival gem Don’t Starve Together has joined the small club of fun but sensible crossovers. Games about cults and starving stick together, you know, so both games are celebrating each other’s birthdays with free updates.

Should the deal finally close, cloud streaming rights to existing and future Activision Blizzard games released over the next 15 years will (surprisingly) fall under Ubisoft’s control. Those rights will then stay with Ubisoft “in perpetuity.”

                              <span>As someone whose auto-battler experience has, up until now, only been limited to minor forays into the excellent Alice0-recommended Super Auto Pets, sitting down to play a run of Tales &amp; Tactics was somewhat overwhelming. Recently launched into early access and made by the same team behind Slay The Spire&#x27;s popular Downfall mod, this is a fantasy autobattler cloaked in the skin of a roguelike. That means that in addition to creating an army of tabletop-esque miniatures to do your automatic bidding on a grid-based board, you&#x27;ll also be picking from randomly generated opponents on a lightly branching story map as you sword chop your way to your ultimate goal: The Grand Tournament. 
It&#x27;s an intriguing combo, but as a relative newcomer to the auto-battling genre, there&#x27;s maybe a bit too much going on here for its own good. That&#x27;s not to say I haven&#x27;t had a good time with it so far, but there are so many things to juggle in my brain that I feel like I&#x27;m fumbling my way through it by chance rather than making confident and informed tactical choices.

                              <span>Immortals of Aveum is making me wonder whether there’s some kind of gigantic hidden market for floaty magic shooters with overcooked YA dialogue and exceedingly high PC hardware demands. After this and Forspoken releasing within a few months of each other, I’m half expecting Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 to open with Captain Price shooting GPU-smelting laser beams out of his &#x27;tache.
Indeed, this first person sorcery adventure will be hell on your hardware, even if you’ve tooled up with a high-grade graphics card and CPU. This is somewhat more understandable than with the other low-performing PC games we’ve seen this year, as Immortals of Aveum is one of the first Unreal Engine 5.1 games, and makes extensive use of its sparkly new lighting and VFX tech. Sadly, it also aims so high that the only way to get playable performance on lower-end and older mid-range kit it to gut the quality settings.

                              <span>A challenge: hold your arm at a right angle to your torso, bent at the elbow so you can see your wrist and hand in the corner of your eye. Keep it there for as long as you can. Hurts after a while, huh? This is the default position for Jak, awesome FPS wizard with a magic gun arm, and possessor of a personality so inoffensive that when I am not playing the game I struggle to remember he exists. I noticed how hard it is to hold your arm in wizard mode when I was about 10 hours into the 20-or-so span of Immortals Of Aveum, and half way through is too early for a game to make me go all Cinema Sins out of boredom.
Despite this, I very much appreciate Immortals Of Aveum taking a crack at a good old-fashioned mid-length action adventure. There are shining moments where it&#x27;s great fun (though sometimes by accident; I have never, in my life, laughed so hard at some tiny wee orphans being exploded in front of me), but it&#x27;s let down by its FPS combat becoming too repetitive too early, which is the kiss of death for a game built around shooting stuff. It also commits the terrible crime of taking itself too seriously, but then I level that charge at most fantasy I encounter.

That&#x27;s a winning combination for models backed by positive critical reviews, and today we spotted a deal on perhaps their best monitor yet - the Innocn 27M2V, a 27-inch 4K 160Hz monitor with a Mini LED backlight and HDMI 2.1 ports, providing an extremely good HDR experience and full compatibility with PS5, Xbox Series X and PC.

                              <span>During Gamescom Opening Night Live we got to see the first official gameplay trailer for Crimson Desert. It&#x27;s no surprise, but the gameplay looks like a revamped and enhanced version of the combat from Black Desert Online.
The war-torn and medieval fantasy world of Pywel looks absolutely beautiful, and I can&#x27;t wait to explore it. Not to mention about halfway through the trailer we get to see some quality fishing gameplay. Why can&#x27;t every game have fishing? In the video the player caught a nice sized Barracuda that looked like it could be consumed to replenish 150 HP.
Despite how beautiful and honestly polished the open-world action-adventure title looked, there was no release date or timeframe.

We first saw Crimson Desert during the 2020 Game Awards. It&#x27;s been in development for quite some time now by developer Pearl Abyss, creator of Black Desert Online. It was originally announced as an MMORPG but by the end of 2020 Pearl Abyss announced that was no longer the case. Instead, Crimson Desert will intertwine a single-player and multiplayer experience.
Despite its many flaws—and abhorrent pay-to-win mechanics,—Black Desert Online has one of the best combat systems ever in an MMORPG. Seeing Crimson Desert utilize an even more enhanced version of the combat system has me excited to try it out.
There is no release date yet for Crimson Desert, but we do know it is coming to PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S.

                              <span>Full disclosure to start off with: the reason I’m not doing a formal scored review of Wrestlequest is because I did a stint of remote freelance writing for the developer, Mega Cat Studios. It wasn’t anything glamorous, but I got the opportunity during one of the lowest points in my life. COVID was in full swing, and I had lost my job. It helped me hold onto a shred of self-worth for a while. I faded off shortly after, but I enjoyed the time I spent collaborating with them.
I didn’t work on WrestleQuest, though. The closest I came was when I was asked if it looked like one of the crowd members was flipping the middle finger. I didn’t even remember that until I noticed that same crowd member.
Anyway, the real reason I’m playing WrestleQuest is because of Macho Man Randy Savage featuring prom…</span>

                              <span>During Gamescom 2023, Blizzard revealed Season 2 for Diablo 4: Season of Blood. It looks like Blizzard will be following the originally promised quarterly release schedule for Diablo 4 seasons. Season of Blood will release on October 17, almost exactly three months after Season of the Malignant.
After a pretty lackluster Season 1, hopefully Season of Blood adds more meaningful content, especially in the end-game of Diablo 4.

The announcement trailer didn&#x27;t give us much information, other than that we&#x27;ll be accompanying a new character named Erys. Erys is voiced by actress and producer Gemma Chan and leads the effort against a deadly new evil in Sanctuary. Based on the trailer, the new evil seems to be some blood-thirsty vampire-like creatures with extremely pointy teeth.
At the end of the trailer, we get a few quick glimpses of new features coming in Season of Blood. A new questline, new vampiric powers—which will probably replace the existing malignant hearts—and five new endgame bosses. Honestly, the endgame bosses could be pretty exciting, as that&#x27;s currently a lacking feature of Diablo 4 compared to other ARPGs like Path of Exile.
Also, it appears we&#x27;ll be getting updates to renown rewards, gem and stash storage, and resistances and status effects. Without concrete details it&#x27;s hard to know how exactly to feel. But, all of these sound like good things, so I&#x27;m excited to find out more.
Diablo 4 Season 2, Season of Blood, will release on all platforms on October 17.

                              <span>A new trailer was shown off for Mortal Kombat 1 as part of the Gamescom Opening Night Live stream. Beyond being another peek at the narrative, there are a few character reveals, as well.
https://youtu.be/nr4lA4N9lFU
At this point, I thought we&#x27;d seen the entire roster, but it looks like that isn&#x27;t the case. Both the legendary Mortal Kombat boss Shao Kahn and his Queen, Sindel, have been shown off.  We also get a closer look at a younger, spunkier Raiden. Mortal Kombat 3 sub-boss Motaro also appears as a pretty awesome-looking Kameo. Uh, I think I know who I&#x27;m picking.
You know, If Liu Kang was trying to remake the universe to be a more peaceful and prosperous place to live, I&#x27;m not sure why he&#x27;d bring back Shao Kahn. At least now, he seems to exist beneath the heel of Sindel, which is a bit of a flip.
Uhh, so does this mean there&#x27;s still a chance that I&#x27;ll get Sheeva? Please?
Mortal Kombat 1 comes out September 19, 2023 to PC, Switch, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5.

                              <span>As part of the Gamescom Opening Night Live trailer, CD Projekt Red showed off some of the upgrades that are coming to the Cyberpunk 2077 base game and its expansion, Phantom Liberty.
Most of this stuff was already shown off, but it&#x27;s some appreciable features. The perk system is getting overhauled, new weapons and vehicles are being added, and a number of systems and mechanics are getting brushed up. Not all of it looks completely revolutionary, but they did give a peak at the upgraded police system and showed off vehicular weaponry. Both of which I think will definitely improve the moments between narrative.

They&#x27;re also finally implementing a Relic upgrade screen. It was viewable on the base game, but for whatever reason, it wasn&#x27;t implemented. When I played through, I was saving upgrade points for when it would eventually unlock, but I got impatient and looked it up and found out that there wasn&#x27;t a talent tree for it. What a tease.
There are a few other bullet points that sound interesting, including an increased level cap, upgraded combat AI, and redesigned cyberware. I&#x27;m hoping that you can now have more visible cyberware, but I&#x27;m not holding my breath. I thought Cyberpunk 2077 was a bit up its own ass when it came to showing off its production values, but I&#x27;m still looking forward to the expansion.
Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty expansion releases on September 26, 2023. Even if you&#x27;re not interested in the new narrative, the Update 2.0 overhauls will be incorporated for free into the base version.

                              <span>Earlier this year we saw the first gameplay trailer for Flashback 2, and now our hero Conrad B. Hart is back for more. With Gamescom underway, a new trailer is here to show off more of the sequel&#x27;s action and intrigue.
Flashback 2 has original creator Paul Cuisset teaming up with developer Microids Studio Lyon to put players back in the role of the young GBI agent, and this new trailer shows more of how the new release differs from the 1992 original. Previously confined to methodical side-scrolling movement and quick and deadly gunplay, Conrad&#x27;s freedom has expanded. You can see the 2.5D potion in motion as Conrad rolls, jumps, and shoots below.

Hangin&#x27; tough
Flashback 2 has other original team members on board in addition to Cuisset. This includes Thierry Perreau on game design and Amiga composer Raphael Gesqua. 
While it looks like a faster-paced take on the classic, it&#x27;s nice to see Flashback 2 clinging to cinematic adventure game animations. The way Conrad hangs from ledges and performs all-important combat rolls should look familiar enough to longtime fans. Sure, they may have misspelled &quot;Washington&quot; in one of the cinematics, but it looks like a lot of care was put into bringing the battle against the Morphs to 2023.
Flashback 2 spins its dystopian sci-fi yarn on PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and PC on November 16. It&#x27;s going physical and digital on consoles, too, and the Collector&#x27;s Edition packs in some extras for those who want to shout their Flashback love from the heart of their shelves.

                              <span>Gamescom&#x27;s first batch of big announcements includes another shift for the Granblue Fantasy Relink release date. During today&#x27;s Opening Night Live, Cygames revealed its mobile game-turned-action-RPG will launch on February 1, 2024.
For those keeping track, yes—that is indeed a delay. Originally, the GBF open-world adventure was set to launch sometime this year, in 2023. The new date&#x27;s trailer also showed off a few of Cygames&#x27; extra goodies, including a Deluxe and Collector&#x27;s Edition. The beefier of the two includes a Proto Bahamut statue.

So far, Cygames has confirmed several familiar faces from its gacha hit for Relink. We&#x27;ve seen series hero Lyria and her bodyguard, Katalina. The swordswoman Narmaya, dragonslayer Siegfried, ghostly Ferry, and, of course, both designs for the mobile version&#x27;s silent player avatar. As you adventure with old and new series companions, players can invite a friend along for the ride; the GBF action game supports up to four players for co-op.

It&#x27;s been a long wait for folks eager to see some of their favorite 2D heroes get the full-fledged action RPG treatment. Relink&#x27;s first announcement goes all the way back to 2016. That&#x27;s back when we knew it as &quot;Project Re: Link,&quot; instead. After some developer limbo, a period of silence, and a change in studio involvement, we&#x27;re finally getting there. Back in May, Relink made another appearance at the PlayStation showcase with its 2023 release window.
Pre-orders for the GBF RPG open on August 23, 2 am CEST. Granblue Fantasy: Relink launches on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC via Steam next year.

                              <span>Gamescom 2023 has had quite a few vague &quot;this exists&quot; trailers, and Killing Floor 3 is one of them.
Look, I really dig the staying power of the Killing Floor series. The second game in particular remained relevant for several years after its initial 2016 debut, well into its release on Xbox One a year later. It&#x27;s a great take on the typical horde mode formula, and Tripwire Interactive spawned an entire diehard audience out of it. Now, a third entry is in the works.
If you&#x27;re interested, here&#x27;s a synopsis from Tripwire to hold you over:
&quot;Killing Floor 3 is the next installment in the legendary co-op action/horror FPS series. The year is 2091, 70 years after the events in Killing Floor 2, and megacorp Horzine has produced the ultimate army: an obedient horde of bio-engineered monstrosities called Zeds. Now, the only thing standing between these infernal creations and the future of humanity is the rebel rogue group known as Nightfall. This intense first-person shooter puts players in the role of a Nightfall specialist, joining forces with up to five teammates as they battle through a war-ravaged, dystopian future, surviving unrelenting waves of Zeds, unlocking new skills, and building the ultimate arsenal.&quot;

Okay, an even more futuristic take on the series? I can work with that! It sounds like we could get even more lore tidbits this time around, with the clash between Nightfall and Horzine.
Killing Floor 3 will arrive on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S for sure (with no prior generation console releases planned): but it currently has no release date, or even a release window.

                              <span>Sonic the Hedgehog made sure to show up at Gamescom 2023, and with that came a treat for those who bought Sonic Frontiers. A short teaser trailer for an update called &quot;The Final Horizon&quot; was unveiled, promising new story, new playable characters, and new challenges.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;RMbtrz3ut9w
The trailer itself isn&#x27;t terribly illuminating on its own. We see a giant robot looking down on Sonic and friends, which goads Sonic into taking out some Chaos Emeralds. As a hedgehog naturally does, he goes Super Sonic shortly after, and the teaser ends. This might mean something to those who played Sonic Frontiers, I just didn&#x27;t join Destructoid fast enough to cover it. That said, I know that Super Sonic always warrants celebration, so I&#x27;m excited for that!
Though details on The Final Horizon remain scarce, we do know it will release for free. While Sonic Frontiers remains a somewhat divisive game, I&#x27;m happy that fans of the title will get a nice bonus for their loyalty. I&#x27;ll be plenty curious to see how this update pans out when it launches on September 28.

                              <span>Inflexion Games revealed during Gamescom that Nightingale would be getting one more final delay. The survival crafting adventure will now release in Early Access on February 22, 2024.
Despite the delay, we also get an official release date trailer that shows off some more gameplay. I have to admit, the procedurally-generated Victorian universe is looking better than ever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;1dcRqDhVVV8
&quot;After years of dedicated work from the team, we are thrilled to announce that Nightingale will enter Early Access on February 22nd, 2024,&quot; CEO Aaryn Flynn said in a press release. &quot;That date is a few months later than we previously announced. But as a studio, we’re committed to quality, and we take player satisfaction very seriously. We want to ensure that the game delivers on the expectations of our community, who have played a vital role in the development to date. We strive to ensure that Nightingale not only fulfills our vision but also becomes a cherished place for our players to explore and discover with their friends for many years to come.&quot;

With this trailer being titled &quot;Official Release Date Trailer&quot;, surely this has to be the last delay, right? I&#x27;ve been very excited about Nightingale since its announcement. I&#x27;m a huge fan of these open-world survival crafting games, especially with Nightingale spanning multiple worlds. It has the potential to be a truly unique experience in the genre.
Nightingale will now release in Early Access on Steam and Epic on February 22, 2024 at a pricepoint of$29.99

                              <span>Tekken 8 has been hotly anticipated since it was revealed, and now we finally have a firm release date to pin down. At Gamescom 2023, a new trailer confirmed that the game will launch on January 26, 2024.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;tG_gUIaRQ8I
Accompanying the release date, Tekken 8 producer Katsuhiro Harada teased a new mode called Arcade Quest. The trailer footage shows players making a custom avatar to bring into a virtual arcade, though we didn&#x27;t see much more than that. We can confirm Arcade Mode is strictly a single player mode, so we know that much at least.
Additionally, the presentation noted that we&#x27;ll see &quot;all new gameplay that actually has some AI kind of infused learning aspects to it&quot;. Those words are as interesting as they are vague. Will we train characters as we advance through Arcade Quest? Your guess is as good as mine.
Also, while not a specific highlight of the trailer, our own Zoey &quot;The Yellow Dart&quot; Handley pointed out that Yoshimitsu makes his Tekken 8 debut here. As someone who mostly grew up with Soulcalibur, I always love to see him.
We&#x27;ll learn more about everything Tekken 8 offers when it launches on January 26, 2024 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.

                              <span>During Gamescom, developer Supermassive Games revealed the next entry in the Little Nightmares franchise: Little Nightmares 3. We got a first look at the gameplay in the third dark atmospheric adventure title that will be released in 2024.
Players will follow the journey of Low and Alone, two friends looking to escape the nightmarish world of The Nowhere. In typical Little Nightmares fashion, players will encounter signature elements including dubious puzzles and memorable monstrosities including the Monster Baby we see in the trailer.
Also, from a gameplay perspective, the sequel adds a new element. Both of the characters have their own unique items to progress through the journey. As such, teamwork will be a big part of the adventure with two-player online co-op. However, for those looking to play solo, you will still be able to do so. But instead of another player, AI will control the other character.

Little Nightmares and Little Nightmares 2 are staple dark atmospheric adventure titles in my opinion. It looks like that will only continue with Little Nightmares 3. If you were a fan of the first two, chances are you already know you&#x27;re getting this one.
Little Nightmares 3 will release in 2024 on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S and Nintendo Switch.

                              <span>As part of the Gamescom kickoff stream, Microsoft has announced the 2021 RTS Age of Empires IV is launching on Xbox consoles right now!
Developed by Relic Entertainment and released for PC in 2021, Age of Empires IV continues the long-running franchise. Considering it was published by Xbox Game Studios, it&#x27;s surprising it took this long, but real-time strategy has long been a poor fit for consoles. Microsoft touts that this version will be reworked a bit to accommodate the controller interface.

I haven&#x27;t played Age of Empires since the original 1997 release, but this one was well-received on its PC launch. So, that&#x27;s cool.
Age of Empires IV is currently available on PC, and launches on Xbox platforms right now.

The spectral horde joins the Stormcast Eternals and Orruk Kruleboyz has confirmed factions in the RTS. The fourth and final faction has yet to be revealed.
Alongside the reveal of the new faction, we also got a release date. Warhammer Age of Sigmar: Realms of Ruin will release on November 17 on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.
Fellow Age of Sigmar fans will have some options when purchasing an Edition of the game. The Standard Edition will include the game for $59.99, while the Deluxe Edition will also include four Alternate Hero Skins and two Profile Customization Sets for $69.99. Those devoted to the Order …</span>

                              <span>The dream of owning the first Metal Gear games in one location will soon come to fruition with the Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection. Now, a new platform is getting on on the action. In addition to current-gen consoles and PC, Konami announced plans to bring the first volume of the Metal Gear Solid bundle to PlayStation 4.
The PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC versions were previously locked in for October 24. PS4 details are still TBD, however, so we&#x27;ll have to wait for further info. For now, we know the Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection will be digital-only on PS4. The PS5, Xbox Series, and Switch collections will be available both physically and digitally.

Bring back Ultra Games
As previously reported, Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection packs in some essential sneaking missions, including the MSX classics. In addition to Metal Gear and Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake, players can relive the stealth action of Metal Gear Solid, Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty and Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. 
The NES version of Metal Gear I spent too long attempting to figure out back in the day is there, too, as is the less celebrated followup, Snake&#x27;s Revenge. Much like the NES Metal Gear, creator Hideo Kojima was not involved in this sequel, and it shows. As a piece of gaming history, though, it&#x27;s essential. Snake&#x27;s Revenge reflects a company capitalizing on the popularity of an original title in international regions. Also, like most Ultra Games, the soundtrack — from composer Tsutomu Ogura — rips. 
As for what lies beyond all this, we&#x27;ll have to wait and see if those volume 2 leaks pan out whenever Konami gets around to detailing the next collection.

GamesHub&#x27;s Edmond Tran recently revealed an interesting detail that suggests the upcoming game may feature some nifty accessibility options. After losing in the Mortal Kombat 1 beta, he did a little sleuthing and discovered that he was playing what he believes to be a blind gamer. This led to him learning that the fighting game features a descriptive audio option for Fatalities.

The example Tran posts has a narrator describing how Li Mei yanks out her victim&#x27;s guts and decapitates them with a kick. The gruesome descriptions should serve as a great aid for visually impaired gamers hoping to immerse themselves in Mortal Komba…</span>

                              <span>The recent Quake 2 remaster by Nightdive Studios is arguably the best way to experience the classic 1997 shooter. But could it be better? That&#x27;s what one modder thinks, who&#x27;s currently working on a path tracing mod.
Reddit user mStewart207 (as spotted by DSO Gaming) recently uploaded some images from their upcoming &quot;RTX Renderer&quot; project, which will aim to implement even greater lighting algorithms to the revamped version of Quake 2.
[caption id&#x3D;&quot;attachment_397928&quot; align&#x3D;&quot;aligncenter&quot; width&#x3D;&quot;640&quot;] Image via mStewart207/Reddit.[/caption]
Judging by the screenshots so far, it looks pretty great. The modder is aiming to publish it to GitHub &quot;as soon as it&#x27;s more or less playable.&quot; We don&#x27;t know when that will be, though.
What is path tracing?
There are a lot of technical terms that get thrown around in this modern gaming era. From image upscaling to things like RTX and rasterization, it can be difficult to know what&#x27;s going on when it comes to visual acuity.
Many of you may already be aware of ray tracing, which is – in a nutshell – a piece of AI that uses the position of the player to make light and shadows look more realistic. But is this any different to path tracing? According to TechSpot, &quot;Path tracing differs from ray tracing in that instead of following lots of rays, throughout an entire scene, the algorithm only traces the most likely path for the light.&quot;
It&#x27;s up to you to decide whether you understand that definition or not.
At the very least, it sounds like the remaster of Quake 2 could potentially look even better once this mod comes out. Who knew id Software&#x27;s brown-and-gray FPS would get a second chance in the limelight?

                              <span>Fallout 76 is gearing up for Season 14, and every time that number gets bigger I just can&#x27;t believe it. It feels like just yesterday that the disastrous launch took the world by storm, followed by subsequent promises of NPCs and an even bigger focus on microtransactions. But all of that is in the rearview (well, except the microtransactions!), and we&#x27;re so far removed from that launch mess that it&#x27;s not even funny. Here&#x27;s a quick look at what&#x27;s coming to Season 14.
Here&#x27;s the full rundown from Bethesda on what to expect for Season 14
The team will continue to drop updates throughout the season, but the big focus right now is on the &quot;Fight for Freedom&quot; season pass track, as well as some upcoming quality-of-life enhancements that will be ready out of the gate.
&quot;Season 14 features a variety of quality-of-life improvements, including lowered Perk Card requirements, streamlined Workbench changes along with a new free cam feature in Photo Mode. Active Fallout 1st subscribers will also receive bonus rewards as they level up.&quot;

It sounds small, but someone out there is likely freaking out (in a good way!) about just one of these enhancements.
Here are the main features for Season 14:
New Ally: Grandma Junko is on a mission to find her grandchildren... she thinks. While her memory isn&#x27;t what it used to be, she can still cook up a good old-fashioned home-cooked meal for you.
Presidential Power Armor Skins: Who needs Secret Service when you have Power Armor?
Oval Office: Create your own base of operations with the Oval Office Rug and Wallpaper.
Autominer Collectron: This new Collectron does all the mining for you, hunting for Ore!

                              <span>Despite numerous controversies over the years, Twitch remains the biggest platform for streaming and broadcasting video game content. However, the Amazon-owned site has recently tried to implement better features to help users moderate their channels, and it looks a new tool is on the way.
According to a screenshot uploaded by streamer and partner Lowco (thanks, Eurogamer), Twitch plans on adding a way for content creators to block banned viewers from watching their streams. The image depicts a new setting that &quot;when enabled, banned users will not be able to watch your live broadcasts.&quot;
https://twitter.com/LowcoTV/status/1691893134609813526
Currently, a Twitch ban only stops users from chatting, but they can still watch. Note that this new feature is not considered an IP ban, but Twitch&#x27;s senior product manager Trevor Fisher says the company will look into feedback from streamers with the hope of making moderation tools more powerful.
When are Twitch ban changes coming?
Updates to Twitch bans should roll out in September, available to all users interested in the new feature. We don&#x27;t know what date exactly, but details should trickle in as Twitch implements changes from its Patch Note streams.
Blocking users from watching streams (and chatting) won&#x27;t stop them from being able to watch VODs or clips, though. Just as Fisher noted, maybe that&#x27;s something the platform could implement in the future with enough feedback.
With viewership up, amassing around 1.8 billion watched hours for July 2023, Twitch retains its position as the number one place for streaming content. Alternatives like YouTube Gaming are trying to compete, but the purple site in its current iteration still rules the market. For now.

GameFreak seems happy to stir the pot so far, with reveals like a 19th Tera Type without much context. Yet the recently released video for the Grass/Ghost-Type Pokémon Poltchageist is wild even by those standards. I’m going to spoil the heck out of it, so watch the short yourself if you want the blind experience.

Our story starts with an older man at a festival telling a ghost story to an audience of children. Apparently, once upon a time, there was a tea master who was an obsessive perfectionist. He was so obsessive that he would yell at any guest handling his tea, leaving him alone with his craft. With no one …</span>

                              <span>KO_OP&#x27;s Goodbye Volcano High was first revealed during Sony&#x27;s 2020 PlayStation Showcase. Featuring colorful dinosaurs in their last year of high school, the game has been subject to numerous delays. The first came in 2021, when countless other games were subject to the same fate due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2022, it was pushed to this year and then delayed again after missing its June 15 release date.

Its August 29 launch date appears to be the one to stick, as KO_OP has announced that the game has gone gold. The announcement congratulates the team for their &quot;huge achievement&quot;, which is understandable, as it appears development was a trying process. Finally, almost four years after the first reveal, we&#x27;ll finally get a taste of what the studio has been cooking up.

What to expect from Goodbye Volcano High
Fang, Reed, and Trish, members of the band VVORM DRAMA, are three dinosaurs in their final year of high school. With only a limited time left, they&#x27;ll have to make some tough decisions. In a PlayStation blog post, KO_OP described it as a cinematic game that&#x27;s meant to feel like binging on a series, though &quot;unlike with TV, you’ll have the power and the emotion in your hands as you guide our characters through a branching narrative.&quot;
The game has rhythm elements to complement its musical themes and features an original soundtrack by Montreal-based artist Dabu. A demo of Goodbye Volcano High is available on Steam for players to discover more about what the game has in store.

However, the remarkable success of Remnant 2 has shown that there&#x27;s still a substantial market for smaller, more contained experiences. Remnant 2&#x27;s sales have been so remarkable, in fact, that the game managed to dethrone Diablo 4 last month, skyrocketing to the very top of the July list of bestsellers.
This information comes from Mat Piscatella, a renowned gaming industry analyst who often posts sales information on his Twitter account. Piscatella&#x27;s stats summarize sales data from the Nintendo eShop, PlayStation, Steam, and Xbox platforms, ranking games based on their revenue.

This delightful-looking &quot;slapformer&quot; comes from the team at Coal Supper, Will Todd and James Carbutt. Thank Goodness You&#x27;re Here is a surreal tribute to their home in northern England: Barnsworth.

While Alan Wake 2, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III, and Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty were the biggest multiplatform draws, we got a release date for Sonic Superstars, a brand new Mortal Kombat 1 trailer, and a surprise Little Nightmares sequel announcement.

You’ll team up with a new character, Erys, voiced by actress Gemma Chan (Eternals, Crazy Rich Asians), a seasoned warrior and vampire hunter who is described as complex and jaded, having experienced plenty of horror in her life. Season of the Blood is a brand-new questline featuring five new endgame bosses. Check out the teaser trailer below.  


Diablo IV Season of Blood begins on October 17. As a reminder, the game&#x27;s currently ongoing Season of the Malignant wraps up on the same day.</span>

                              <span>Today during Gamescom&#x27;s Opening Night Live, we got a new look at the gameplay and live-action scenes in the upcoming Alan Wake 2. The trailer begins with a slew of live-action footage – including Wake on a talk show.
The footage is then followed by gameplay showing combat with dual protagonists Saga Anderson and, of course, Alan Wake. It&#x27;s all very spooky.
The footage was brief, but to see it yourself, check out the trailer below:


Alan Wake 2 was originally set to be released on October 17 but was pushed back to October 27. For more info, check out our recent preview.</span>

                              <span>NetherRealm Studios has released a brand new trailer for Mortal Kombat 1, and it’s one of the wildest ones yet. It confirms that both Sindel and General Shao are playable characters, and we get another look at Liu Kang’s chosen champion, Raiden. 
The trailer begins with a cinematic cutscene setting up the ensuing fight as Liu Kang challenges Sindel to a duel by way of Raiden. It doesn’t take long for the trailer to become a gory mess of blood and guts, though, as we see Sindel, General Shao, and Raiden face off in various fights. The trailer also reveals two additional Kameo fighters: Motaro and Shujinko. 
Check out the Rulers of Outworld Mortal Kombat 1 trailer for yourself below: 


&quot;As supreme ruler of Outworld’s army, General Shao has proven loyalty to his realm through countless victories in battle and possesses a gameplay style that dominates opponents with conquering strength and iron will,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;Sindel is the empress of Outworld who fights to protect her family and empire with the ability to vanquish enemies with her mystifying hair, piercing scream, and power of levitation.&quot; 
Mortal Kombat 1 hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC on September 19.

                              <span>Marvel Snap took fans of both the popular comics and movies company and collectible card games by storm last year thanks to its bite-sized, exciting gameplay and compelling collection and leveling-up mechanics. Both the mobile and Early Access PC versions have received various updates that include a Conquest series mode, friend PvP, and a ton of new cards and variants, but the PC version has remained in Steam Early Access until now.
However, during today&#x27;s Gamescom Opening Night Live showcase, developer Second Dinner Studios&#x27; Ben Brode announced that Marvel Snap has exited Steam Early Access and is officially out now on PC. To celebrate, players who log into the PC version of Marvel Snap will receive a Devil Dinosaur Mech Variant. Additionally, players who watch the Marvel Snap category on Twitch will be eligible for drops starting today and running until August 29. 
&quot;Launching the game on PC has been a dream of ours for years now, and we&#x27;ve worked really hard to ensure it&#x27;s an experience that players new and old are going to absolutely love,&quot; Brode said in a press release. &quot;This is especially an exciting time for the streaming community, who have welcomed Marvel Snap with open arms. The game looks absolutely beautiful on PC and we can&#x27;t wait to see the epic streams on Twitch now that we&#x27;re live.&quot;
The PC version includes a native widescreen format. You can see the animated reveal trailer debuted during today&#x27;s livestream below.


Marvel Snap was so well-received in 2022 that it was a rare free-to-play mobile title to land on Game Informer&#x27;s Top 10 Games of the Year list.

Now, the studio has formally unveiled The Final Shape, the expansion concluding this decade-long story arc, and it launches on February 27, 2024. 
Bungie says in The Final Shape, Guardians will confront their ultimate adversary, The Witness, alongside companions from their years of adventures in Destiny 2, like Ikora Rey, Commander Zavala, and Cayde-6, who has somehow returned after dying in the game’s Forsaken expansion. The Final Shape will take players right into the heart of the Traveler to end the War of Light and Darkness with the Vanguard.

                              <span>When Sonic Frontiers was released late last year, it was generally regarded as good but &quot;rough around the edges.&quot; Because of that, it&#x27;s been great to see Sega move to support the game further post-launch with a series of updates with free content. Teased today at Gamescom, the next pack of content, known as &quot;The Final Horizon&quot; update, is the most exciting yet, promising new story, new challenges, and even new playable characters.


The teaser itself doesn&#x27;t give us much to go on. Sonic and friends stand on the edge of a cliff, ready to face a massive Titan. Knuckles, Amy, and Tails are all candidates to be playable characters in the future, but there&#x27;s no indication of that here – Sonic summons the Chaos Emeralds to become Super Sonic, ready to face off against this mysterious threat, then powers up yet again as he races toward the Titan.
For any more details, we&#x27;ll have to wait until the full update drops on September 28, just over a month from now.

                              <span>We already knew that Sonic Superstars was arriving this fall, but thanks to today&#x27;s Gamescom Opening Night Live stream, we know exactly when. In a month that already features the likes of Super Mario Bros. Wonder, Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2, Alan Wake 2, Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage, Forza Motorsport, and Cities: Skylines II, we have another high-profile game that will contend with our precious free time. Sonic Superstars joins the mix with a release date of October 17.
Sonic Superstars brings the Classic Sonic action into a more modernized setting with 3D visuals and myriad new powers. It&#x27;s also the first Sonic game to feature true cooperative play. As our most recent cover story, we&#x27;ve played and talked a lot about Sonic Superstars, including an exclusive look at every Emerald Power in the game, plus a first look at several never-before-seen zones.
This announcement also brought us a look at other multiplayer modes, which you can see in the trailer below.


Sonic Superstars arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on October 17. That date puts it the same week as another highly anticipated 2D game from one of gaming&#x27;s most fabled and beloved franchises, as Super Mario Bros. Wonder arrives on October 20. We already knew this fall and holiday season would be fantastic for gamers, but it looks to be particularly awesome for fans of 2D platforming. For more on Sonic Superstars, be sure to hit the banner below for exclusive details surrounding the highly anticipated 2D adventure.</span>

                              <span>Gamescom Opening Night Live provided a platform for a new gameplay walkthrough of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III. The video focuses on a new wrinkle called Open Combat Missions. These are player-directed missions, letting players engage how they want.
You can play stealthy with appropriate gear, go loud, use vehicles, tacticals, and even use killstreaks in campaigns. They work seamlessly with cinematic moments, with the idea being that players have increased agency and flexibility in how they choose to tackle story missions. 
Similar to last year’s Modern Warfare 2 gameplay reveal, we see a squad infiltrate a deep-sea vessel during a violent storm. After making their way into a base situated within an old fort, they proceed underground into a facility, blasting foes along the way. Though it&#x27;s hard to get a sense of the Open Combat Missions in this demo, the video provides a nice look at MWIII&#x27;s impressive visuals. 


Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III launches on November 10.</span>

                              <span>Nightingale, the highly anticipated debut game from Inflexion Games, received a new Early Access release date during today&#x27;s Gamescom Opening Night Live stream. We now know that the shared-world survival game will hit Steam and Epic Games Store in an Early Access state on February 22, 2024. 
In Nightingale, you control a Realmwalker as you venture through arcane portals in a procedurally generated Victorian gaslamp fantasy universe. Though survival crafting serves as the core gameplay loop, the studio touts its world-building and excellent visuals. The studio also pushes forward its ever-evolving narrative, which emphasizes play autonomy.

&quot;[The Early Access date] is a few months later than previously announced,&quot; Inflexion Games CEO Aaryn Flynn said in a press release. &quot;But as a studio, we&#x27;re committed to quality and take player satisfaction very seriously. We want to ensure that the game delivers on the expectations of our community, who have played a vital role in the development to date.

                              <span>Pearly Abyss, the studio behind Black Desert Online, has released a new trailer for its upcoming single-player open-world RPG, Crimson Desert, and it features our first look at new gameplay since 2020. 
The studio released this trailer as part of Geoff Keighley’s Opening Night Live presentation for Gamescom, and it features new 4K footage of protagonist Kliff investigating the region of Hernand. It also highlights various other areas in this sprawling open world, NPCs, and more. And, of course, it features a healthy dose of the game’s hand-to-hand combat and wrestling-inspired moves. 
Check out the Crimson Desert gameplay trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see in the trailer above, we also see some of the game&#x27;s traversal, including skydiving, Kliff climbing up buildings and trees, and more. We also see some minigames featured in Crimson Desert, like fishing, arm-wrestling, and the one that occurs when trying to tame wild horses. 
“Developed on Pearl Abyss’ proprietary next-generation ‘BlackSpace Engine,’ Crimson Desert is an open world action-adventure game,” a press release reads. “With an engaging setting and realistic characters, Crimson Desert depicts the story of mercenaries fighting for survival on the expansive continent of Pywel.” 

Pearl Abyss says it aims for a simultaneous global release of Crimson Desert on PC and console. While the studio’s CEO, Jin-Young Heo, stated earlier this year the game was targeting a fall 2023 release window, there’s still no word on when to expect it to launch.

                              <span>Developer Game Science has released a new trailer for Black Myth: Wukong. Revealed during Gamescom’s Opening Night Live ceremony today, Black Myth: Wukong continues to look great.
Today’s trailer showcases more of the game’s action RPG combat alongside its dive into Chinese mythology. The combat looks reminiscent of From Software’s Sekiro and this year’s Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty from Team Ninja, but it’s clear it’s aiming for its own take on the fast-paced action combat. 
You can check out the Black Myth: Wukong trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Black Myth: Wukong pits the player’s monkey warrior character – the Destined One – against various legends, foes, and creatures from throughout Chinese mythology, and it looks fun (and difficult). Game Science says Black Myth: Wukong’s story is based on Journey to the West, one of the four great classical novels of Chinese literature. “You shall set out as the Destined One to venture into the challenges and marvels ahead, to uncover the obscured truth beneath the veil of a glorious legend from the past.” 
Today’s trailer did not reveal anything by way of a release date for the game, but it’s due out sometime in the summer of next year on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.

The team revealed the game during today’s Opening Night Live stream hosted by Geoff Keighley for Gamescom 2023, with a debut trailer showcasing some of the game’s strategy action. It’s set to hit Steam sometime next spring. In Endzone 2, players must fight to survive in an unforgiving environment while trying to discover habitable grounds and repopulate them with humanity. Like its predecessor, it combines survival action with strategy colony sim gameplay.

                              <span>During Gamescom&#x27;s Opening Night Live event, CD Projekt Red shared a new trailer and took to the stage to share what is coming to Cyberpunk 2077 with its 2.0 update and Phantom Liberty expansion. Phantom Liberty is a paid expansion that will include all kinds of new story content and Idris Elba, but even if you don&#x27;t buy into the expansion, the game will receive all kinds of improvements.


The footage from the game showed protagonist V launching herself from a motorcycle to slam into a group of enemies. New weapons, like guns and blades will be added and perks have been redesigned. There are also all kinds of new animations in the combat. We also saw V throwing an enemy at another in combat and dashing in mid-dair. The police have also been revamped and will call in MaxTac to fight you, you can hack while driving, and new vehicles will have built in guns for expanded car combat.
The 2.0 update releases September 26 and the paid Phantom Liberty expansion will also be available that day. You can find Game Informer&#x27;s Cyberpunk 2077 review by following the link.</span>

                              <span>Hyper Light Breaker, the upcoming action title by Solar Ash and Hyper Light Drifter developer Heart Machine, has been delayed. It was set to launch in Steam Early Access later this year, but the team needs more time to bring it together.
As such, the game will now launch early next year. A developer video simply informs fans of the team’s desire to spend more time with Hyper Light Breaker, with creative director Alx Preston stating in a press release, 
“We&#x27;ve made remarkable progress and the game has come a long way since we started development. Taking this additional time to focus on Hyper Light Breaker’s development will allow us to bring the game to its full potential and we are incredibly grateful for the support from our community that’s been with us every step of the way. We thank you for your patience and understanding as we work to deliver a new adventure that lives up to what fans expect from a Heart Machine title.”


Hyper Light Breaker is a spiritual follow-up to Hyper Light Drifter, set within the same universe but imagined in 3D graphics. The third-person action game can be played alone or with friends in 3-player online co-op. Players roam the large, colorful world discovering new areas, battling monsters in flashy combat, and obtaining powerful gear in a quest to overthrow a powerful king.

                              <span>Before the 1983 video game crash and Nintendo’s subsequent takeover of the industry with the NES, the Atari 2600 reigned supreme. The popular console was pretty much the poster child for ‘late 70s/early ‘80s gaming, boasting a vast library of titles that have since inspired a multitude of games for decades to come. Over 30 years after the 2600 was discontinued, it’s making a contemporary comeback. 
Atari and Plaion have announced the 2600+, a modernized recreation of the four-switch model introduced in 1980. In addition to sharing the same woodgrain aesthetics and metal switches, it also includes modern features such as HDMI output, USB port, and support for multiple screen resolutions. The console comes with a new CX40+ joystick faithful to the original and supports two players. 


The 2600+ includes the single cartridge slot and can play original 2600 and 7800 cartridges (including physical versions of newly released titles, such as Mr. Run and Jump and Bezerker Enhanced Edition). Additionally, the console comes bundled with a 10-in-1 cartridge with the following games:
Adventure
Combat
Dodge ‘Em
Haunted House
Maze Craze
Missle Command
Realsports Volleyball
Surround
Video Pinball
Yar’s Revenge
“We’re excited to be working with Atari to bring back the Atari 2600 and help meet the growing consumer demand for retro hardware,” said commercial director of retro at Plaion, Ben Jones in a press release. “For gamers who remember the thrill of playing arcade games at home for the very first time, the Atari 2600+ will bring you right back. For everyone else, the offer is one of timeless fun and the chance to experience a golden age of video games in a way that could only come from Atari.”
The Atari 2600+ launches on November 17 for $129.99. You can pre-order it now on Atari’s website. CX40 joysticks will also be sold separately for $24.99. Atari and Plaion also plan to launch the CX-30 Paddle Controller bundle that includes the paddle and a 4-in-1 game cartridge for $39.99.</span>

                              <span>Microsoft has submitted a new deal to the U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority regulatory agency that proposes Ubisoft get the rights to Activision Blizzard game streaming for 15 years. 
After the CMA blocked Microsoft’s proposed acquisition of Activision Blizzard for a colossal $69 billion back in April over cloud gaming concerns, Microsoft set its sights on the U.S. Federal Trade Commission for approval. In July, a California judge denied the FTC’s request for a preliminary injunction in its case to block Microsoft’s proposed acquisition. Shortly after that decision, Microsoft announced it was pausing its appeal efforts in the U.K. to negotiate with the CMA, and the CMA extended the company’s deadline to do so to August 29, 2023. 


Today, the CMA confirmed it is blocking Microsoft’s…</span>

Plenty of great first-person shooters take players on globe-trotting adventures using modern military technology, to World Wars, and sometimes the moon or even hell. Immortals of Aveum carves out its own place in the broad genre of shooters by setting its first-person action in the fantasy realm of Aveum, and it’s refreshing to shoot at ax-wielding knights, magic sorcerers, dragons, and more. 
It helps that Immortals of Aveum mixes up its competent shooting with unique, puzzle-like twists to keep most encounters fresh and ex…</span>

                              <span>Poslední generací GPU Nvidia, které nevyžadovaly pro svoji plnou funkčnost digitálně podepsaný firmware v podobě binárního blobu, byla zhruba 10 let stará generace GeForce GTX 700. Vše další už vyžaduje digitálně podepsaný firmware, což činí obrovský problém například open-source ovladači nouveau, resp. jeho vývojářům. Proto jsou grafické karty s GPU Nvidia na Linuxu rozumně použitelné jen s uzavřeným ovladačem přímo od Nvidie. Ale to se možná změní.</span>

We’ll see just how lucky the ship is when The Invincible comes out on its newly-revealed release date, November 6th, though some readers may know how this story ends already, since it&#x27;s based on Stanisław Lem’s 1964 science fiction novel of the same name.

                              <span>When listing off my favourite games, I&#x27;m shamefully likely to neglect to mention Firewatch. This is probably because Firewatch isn&#x27;t a game that had some huge formative impact on me, or reframed my entire relationship with gaming, or became an enduring obsession of my hyperfixation-prone brain. Firewatch is, quite simply, a very lovely game, and one that I happily revisit on a fairly regular basis.
I think the main draw of Firewatch, for me, is the forest. I am one of those people who&#x27;s often happiest on a day-long hike into the middle of nowhere; and when life doesn&#x27;t provide me with the opportunity to do something as often as I&#x27;d like, I&#x27;ll turn to thematically appropriate video games to tide me over.
Don&#x27;t get me wrong: Firewatch&#x27;s central story of Henry and Delilah is a good one, and the marvellous Cissy Jones deservedly picked up a BAFTA for her performance as the latter. But the free-roam mode is, to my mind, just as important for ensuring Firewatch&#x27;s enduring appeal.

                              <span>Despite my best efforts, I’m still not proficient at wall-running or motorbiking. But lucky for me, publishers 505 Games have announced that Ghostrunner 2 is coming out on October 26th, which is shaping up to be another very busy month for very good-looking games. The original Ghostrunner bashed the first-person parkour of Mirror’s Edge with cyberpunky ninja swords to great success, and the sequel bolts on a rideable bike and a parry system to the winning formula.

                              <span>Every weekend, indie devs show off current work on Twitter&#x27;s #screenshotsaturday tag. And every Monday, I bring you a selection of these snaps and clips. This week, my eye has been caught by a good deal of wetness, sailing over a post-apocalyptic sea, walking going under a post-Apocalyptic sea, and ogling a waterfall. Check out these interesting indie games and so many more in our latest highlights!

                              <span>The Sims 4 has long dominated the life simulation arena, but a pair of hopeful rivals are soon stepping into the ring to challenge the undisputed champ. Life By You and Paralives both have grand plans to unseat (or at least share it with) EA’s life sim juggernaut, and they both promise to set themselves apart with features that Simmers have long been asking for. But I only have one question for both of them: can I kill my Sims? Or Parafolk? Or… Lifers? In the case of Paralives, the answer is thankfully a big fat yes.

                              <span>Developer Cardboard Computer sporadically released their poetic adventure game, Kentucky Route Zero, in acts spread across multiple years. It was a teasing release schedule that only aided the game’s surreal mystery, so it’s no surprise that the studio have dropped the game’s first major update three years after the fifth and final chapter wrapped things up. The aptly named Postmodern Update overhauls the game’s user interface with a new Modern mode, alongside a host of bug fixes and more language options. 


“The new ‘Modern’ interface is designed to be more flexible and readable on a wider variety of devices, including tablets and the Steam Deck,” the studio wrote in a recent Steam blog. Kentucky Route Zero’s smaller acts and text-based nature make it almost perfect for on-the-go devices, although I’m more interested in using the game as bedtime reading instead, as someone who regrettably bounced off of it in the early acts. “We&#x27;ve also overhauled and improved the ‘Classic’ interface from the original release, and its lo-fi companion, ‘Retro,’” the studio also wrote.


The update also lets you “zoom in on details in the scene,” which sounds handy for smaller screens. New translations now support Arabic, Chinese, Polish, Thai, Swedish, Turkish, and Brazilian Portuguese, too.

                              <span>It&#x27;s hard to know where to start with Six Ages 2 Colon Lights Going Out. The initial uncertainty and esoteric nature of its world has always been the series&#x27; biggest problem, as it appears to demand a lot of foreknowledge to play. But rather than memorising facts and (ugh) &quot;lore&quot;, it&#x27;s a series that encourages a different mindset to pretty much any other game. These games are about culture and myth, and how both interact and change over time.
It&#x27;s harder, though, to write about this entry without just repeating myself. It is a Part Two of a planned three, thus much the same as before, yet different in some interesting, but esoteric ways. Do I try to convince the unfamiliar, detail those differences for fans, or try to cover both and succeed in neither?

                              <span>Explaining the concept of Fight Crab feels redundant because, well, it’s all right there in the name. It’s a fighting game… with crabs. The kaiju crustaceans left such a good impression that developer Calappa Games went fishing for more maybe-not-voluntary battlers and announced a follow-up: Fight Crab 2. Just in case you’re uncomfortable with imposing a combat sport on sea creatures, the sequel adds humans to the mix, so you can enjoy the zany announcement trailer with a clear conscience.

                              <span>Microsoft has revealed new console wraps for the Xbox Series X. 
These wraps work similarly to Sony’s PlayStation 5 console covers, allowing players to change the console’s cosmetic look without buying an entirely new one. Instead of sliding covers off like with the PS5, Xbox’s solution is to wrap the cosmetic change around the console, hence the name. The company has revealed three wraps to kick off the product, including a special edition Starfield wrap. 
“The Starfield-inspired console wrap reimagines your console as an on-board avionics module, powering you through your adventures,” an Xbox blog post reads. “Key internal console components are highlighted through outlined access panel and game-inspired graphics.

Madden NFL 24 from EA Tiburon expands on the rebuilt fundamentals from last year, creating a football simulation that takes a solid next step toward authenticity. However, new poorly implemented features and an interface showing its age are enough of a drag to make this latest iteration feel like a step back for a series badly in need of forward progress.
The on-the-field gameplay is more realistic than ever. The physics-based player interactions are noticeably improved, with ball carriers pushing against piles…</span>

                              <span>The Invincible will be released this November. 
More specifically, publisher 11 bit studios and developer Starward Industries have revealed that its upcoming sci-fi mystery game will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on November 6. Starward Industries has released a new trailer highlighting this release date as well as new footage of the game, and you can watch it below: 


In The Invincible, players control Yasna, an astrobiologist in search of her lost crew that she must bring back dead or alive. They’re lost somewhere on the Mars-like planet of Regis III.
“On the surface, it may seem that Regis III is uninhabited but that doesn’t mean the people who visit here can feel like unopposed rulers,” a press release reads.
Starward Industries says the philosophical nature of what happens to Yasna on Regis III will have her forever questioning “the scale of humankind’s ambitions.” 

The Invincible is based on Stanislaw Lem’s novel of the same name, which mixes “retro-futuristic and atompunk design and aesthetics” to create a poppy art style. We’ve experienced a decent chunk of the game already, and you can read our preview thoughts of The Invincible right here. 
The Invincible hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on November 6.

Yesterday, after Nintendo announced the news that Charles Martinet would no longer be voicing Mario and would instead work for the company as a &quot;Mario Ambassador,&quot; a brand new role, Game Informer reached out to ask if Martinet voices Mario in Super Mario Bros. Wonder. Nintendo says he does not. 
&quot;While Charles is not involved in Super Mario Bros. Wonder, we&#x27;re excited to honor his legacy and contributions, including looking ahead to what he&#x27;ll be doing as Mario Ambassador. Character voice actor will be credited in the game credits, so please wait for the game to be released.&quot;

Initially set to release sometime this year, the team recently announced that it is delaying the game to early 2024, as reported by Eurogamer. As for why, Ironwood Studios says it needs more room to make Pacific Drive the best it can be while also prioritizing the health of everyone on the team. 
As summer comes to a close, we’d like to share that Pacific Drive is moving its release to early 2024.

“As many know, we’ve been hard at work bringing this idea to life for quite some time, and every day adds even more to a game we’re all proud of,” the studio writes on Twitter. “In this final stretch, however, it’s important to us that we stay true to ourselves, and not compromise on the team’s well-being. 
“As our community grows, the support and excitement everyone has shown has been incredible and we can’t wait for everyone to take their own set of wheels out into the Zone. Everyone here at Ironwood truly appreciates your patience and understanding.”
Ironwood Studios says it has a surprise to share this week, as it will be a part of the Future Games Show with a new trailer. 
The team revealed Pacific Drive in 2022, and after checking out a hands-off preview of the survival game last year, we came away excited about its potential. It mixes elements of racing with the survival genre alongside a spooky Pacific Northwest setting that we can’t wait to see more of. You can read our Pacific Drive preview thoughts here.

A slightly longer and much improved sequel, Killer Bean 2: The Party, was released in 2000.

Now it&#x27;s getting a video game from original creator Jeff Lew, and it&#x27;s an open world, first- and third-person roguelike shooter with the same acrobatic, John Woo-inspired combat as the nearly thirty-year-old animations. There&#x27;s a first trailer below.

                              <span>Intel&#x27;s A750 and A770 graphics cards tend to be great value, but have a few gaping holes when it comes to performance in older graphics APIs like DirectX 9 and DirectX 11. That&#x27;s slowly changing though - in fact, the company announced significant frame-rate improvements in DX11 titles today - while price drops continue to bring these GPUs into an even more favourable price/performance window. One case is the Arc A770 16GB, which is now available from Newegg for just $300, down from their regular US MSRP of $330.

I&#x27;m playing Edders Sheeran in Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3, a bard with a Dark Urge to lash out and murder largely anything and everything. He doesn&#x27;t know what causes it, and he doesn&#x27;t know when the urge might strike. For a first playthrough, it&#x27;s been a learning experience. Namely, I have learned that friends aren&#x27;t safe, lest I puncture their guts with my bare fists in the middle of the night.
I thought the urge would only bring downsides (what you&#x27;d normally get as a murderer), but I&#x27;ve also learned that it actually has benefits? You get capes in exchange for pulping people! I love capes! Here&#x27;s to more of them.

This is the dilemma Black Skylands leaves me with.
You&#x27;re a very young officer of... something, battlefield promoted to captaincy of the Fathership, essentially a giant floating base from which you set out on your airship in an open world kinda way to trade broadsides with baddies and land at occupied islands to do the twin stick shooter thing on foot. I… don’t like it as much as I want to.

                              <span>Hello everybody! This is Edwin, your resident news-wrangler. I&#x27;ve been in this glorious job for a whole two weeks now, and alas it is time to say goodbye... because I&#x27;m off on holiday. Genius-level journostrategist that I am, I managed to book a week away walking in Scotland during Gamescom before landing the gig, and I can&#x27;t rebook without incurring the everlasting hatred of Caledonian Sleeper. I do have a few under-embargo stories and a review going live next week, but beyond that I&#x27;ll be up a mountain somewhere until 29th August. Apologies - if you&#x27;re up that neck of the woods and we happen to sight each other on opposing hillsides, I&#x27;ll try to bellow something about Starfield.


Before I go, though, I wanted to check in about this whole &quot;news&quot; concept that&#x27;s doing the rounds. The past two weeks have essentially been an exercise in tentatively pressing buttons and apologising to Katharine when half the website backend catches fire. I&#x27;ve tried to put together a fun mixture of stories - I particularly enjoyed the chat below yesterday&#x27;s musings about pacifism - but I&#x27;ve mostly been settling in, and dealing with such evergreen journamalism questions as whether companies are singular or plural, and what proportion of any given article should consist of begging Blackbird Interactive to reveal something else about Homeworld 3.

                              <span>A single GTA 5 mod has rekindled the age-old shouting match about the precise legality and contribution of videogame mods, in the eyes of developers, publishers and players - while also threatening to trigger fresh debate on the use of large language models, aka AI, in game development. The mod in question, &quot;AI Powered GTA V: Story Mode with AI NPCs&quot; sees you investigating a cult of weirdo AI worshippers, with characters who speak AI-generated dialogue. It&#x27;s now been struck from several sites by GTA 5 publisher Take-Two Interactive.

                              <span>The characters in what we might term the Aperture Cinematic Universe are a memorable bunch (as I have said before). Though GLaDOS rightfully tops the list another, introduced in 2011&#x27;s sequel spectacular Portal 2, became an instant favourite. Voiced by J.K. Simmons, doing a turn adjacent to his J. J. Jameson from Spider-Man, Cave Johnson is the founder of Aperture Science (which used to primarily make shower curtains before it evolved into being a death trap puzzle company), and he made an instant impression. And though Aperture Desk Job is nominally a tech demo for the Steam Deck, it also expands the Cave Johnson lore in a very satisfying way. Spoilers beyond for Aperture Desk Job, and Portal 2 if you haven&#x27;t played it.

                              <span>The Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 modding scene remains dominated by blunt practicalities - more XP! More spellslots! More party members! HIGHLIGHT EVERYTHING! - but there are a few intriguing mods percolating to the top. We&#x27;ve already had one that makes Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 a single character RPG, which I am hoping somebody at the RPS Treehouse will do a diary feature about, plus a Painterly Scenery filter created by 1wk, which makes the game look like it&#x27;s daubed on canvas. But the cluster of mods that caught my eye this morning are a simple change of camera perspective and controls that make the game look strikingly like Bioware&#x27;s Dragon Age: Origins.

I do a bit of bow, a bit of sword, a bit of plucking the lute and buffing my pals with a nice song. My greatest strength, though, lies outside of combat in the arena known as &quot;conversation&quot;. Seriously, I&#x27;ve played for around 30 hours now and haven&#x27;t lost a single chat skillcheck. At first I loved being a master of chats, but ever since I played some co-op with my pals using a less charismatic dude, I&#x27;ve found Edders Sheeran&#x27;s unbeatable gob a bit… deflating?

                              <span>This week on All Things Nintendo, Brian renders his final verdict on Blasphemous 2, the new challenging Metroidvania that takes inspiration from games like Dead Cells and Dark Souls. After that, we have two interviews with folks who are involved with the music of the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise, but in very different ways. First up, we talk with Katie Chrzanowski, who you may know as the social media manager for the Sonic the Hedgehog brand. However, she&#x27;s also the producer of the Sonic Symphony, which was livestreamed in 2021 and is heading up the world tour happening this fall. Then, Brian is joined by Tee Lopes, composer of Sonic Mania and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder&#x27;s Revenge. He also happens to be the composer for the upcoming Sonic Superstars.

                              <span>Last month I visited Sonic Team&#x27;s new headquarters in Burbank, CA, alongside Game Informer&#x27;s Brian Shea, who&#x27;s now played half of Sonic Superstars. The upcoming 2D platformer brings Sonic The Hedgehog, Tails, Knuckles, and Amy back for a new cooperative adventure — however, I&#x27;d like to note we only engaged with the single-player experience. After our several-hour hands-on play session, we sat in my hotel room to break down our time playing six of Superstars&#x27; 12 zones, including details about each level, boss fights, the signature Emerald Powers, and how the platforming physics behaved.

After a strange, but funny tease and an official teaser trailer earlier this month, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III (not to be confused with Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3) is been fully unveiled with a full trailer, new details, and a handful of screenshots, which you can find below.


Expectedly, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III&#x27;s campaign picks up where Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II left off. Modern Warfare III will also include what Activision is calling an, &quot;open world Zombies set on the largest Call of Duty Zombies map ever.&quot; It is also promising a big collection of fan favorite and brand new multiplayer maps. You can check out screens from the campaign in the gallery below.

Before all of that, however, Marcus dives into his recent visit to Universal Studios&#x27;s Minion Land and his sampling of the park&#x27;s The Last Of Us-themed menu featuring a delicious pasta dish titled &quot;Left Behind Ravioli.&quot;

One of the requests that has come up with my ongoing testing has been how well the default Microsoft Windows 11 installation compares to loading up Linux on this 8-core AMD Zen 4 laptop. Well, in this article is a look at the Linux performance compared to Windows 11, including when making use of the Linux 6.5 development kernel where AMD P-State is now the default and also for seeing what workloads are impacted by the recent AMD Inception vulnerability.</span>

                              <span>When I wrote up yesterday&#x27;s big dollop of Starfield info I was expecting readers to focus on the stuff about housing, mechs and giant snake cults, in roughly that order. I wasn&#x27;t expecting a slight stir about the inability to complete the game without killing anyone. &quot;Disappointing&quot;, responded Youtuber Mike BurnFire in the QTs. Opined Mama Bedlam: &quot;A fully pacifist run not existing (without mods) is a genuinely worrying sign to do with the flexibility of what the game can do&quot;. Some players took the news as a brazen provocation. As ManyATrueNerd put it: &quot;CHALLENGE. FUCKING. ACCEPTED.&quot;

                              <span>The brutish &quot;X curio is like Y behemoth&quot; logic of mass entertainment nooze requires me to associate Selkie Harbour&#x27;s The Anglerfish Project with Starfield. They do form a pleasant contrast, in fairness. Both are space games but one doesn&#x27;t have a fishing mechanic, whereas the other is all fishing mechanic. One is about visiting strange new worlds, establishing outposts and shooting or romancing the heck out of the locals, while the other maroons you on a single asteroid. The Anglerfish Project deserves better than to serve only as a counterpoint for the Bethesda colossus, however - it&#x27;s a sweet and tidy stargaze &#x27;em up with a dry sense of humour, and you can download it for free on Itch.io.

                              <span>The rest of the RPS Treehouse might be fully engrossed in Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 at the moment, but the main thing that&#x27;s been on my mind for the last couple of weeks is stealthy strategy games. Primarily, the exceedingly excellent Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew, but also Harebrained Scheme&#x27;s upcoming turn-based tactics &#x27;em up, The Lamplighters League, a game I&#x27;ve been quietly looking forward to ever since it was announced earlier this year.
Specifically, I&#x27;ve been playing through a handful of missions from the middle of The Lamplighters League&#x27;s campaign, getting to grips with its full roster of agents and their unique set of skills. It continues to be just as stylish as the opening mission I played in May, but I&#x27;m not gonna lie. I&#x27;ve had quite a bit of whiplash coming straight from Shadow Gambit into this, but even if I&#x27;d arrived fresh and green, I don&#x27;t think even all my years of tactics playing and XCOM-liker-liking would have been enough to prepare me for just how gosh darn difficult it is.

With divine expedience you must go forth into a world from which all unworthy creatures impart their knowledge with great excitations, entangling their speech with a verbosity comparable only to how the holy miracle does imbue our city with its fearsome illumination. If you think this a questionable affectation then guard thyselves, oh Penitent Ones, for you really are in store for an awful lot of this.  


Beyond that, Blasphemous 2 is a cracking Metroidvania rooted in satisfying combat and rewarding exploration of the ‘ooh, I didn’t realise this bit was connected to that bit’ vein. Neither element is on the same level of Dark Souls, but then what is?

                              <span>Bethesda&#x27;s vaunted space bonanza Starfield is available for preload today on PC Game Pass - if you&#x27;re downloading it on Steam, you&#x27;ll need to wait a little longer (even longer, if you plan on playing Starfield on Steam Deck). The file weighs in at 139.84 GB, so be sure to clear some disc space before you force this galaxy&#x27;s worth of grey rocks, NASApunks and hopefully extensive Event Horizon comparisons into your protesting PC, which has only ever lived to serve you and bring you joy. Might be an idea to double-check those Starfield system specs, too, and make that final call on whether to invest in a new SSD.

They&#x27;re the team behind this May&#x27;s triumphant System Shock remake, which Jeremy Peel described in his review as &quot;a breathtakingly beautiful and astonishingly faithful remake that proves the enduring power of Looking Glass design&quot;. They&#x27;re also the studio behind last week&#x27;s surprise-released Quake 2 remaster, and a bunch of other classic 90s remasters including the PC version of DOOM 64 and Rise of the Triad: Ludicrous Edition. It&#x27;s safe to say they know how to pull off a retro (sorry, Kamiya-san) comeback.

                              <span>Like many people that near their eighteenth birthday, the Xbox 360 will soon lose support from its parent company. Today, an announcement on Xbox Wire revealed that the Xbox 360 store will be shutting down on July 29, 2024. This means you will no longer be able to purchase games or DLC on the console, and the Microsoft Movies &amp; TV app will stop working altogether.
However, the post makes it clear that content bought beforehand will still be playable after the cutoff date, so digital games on the 360 should still work just fine, and you&#x27;ll always be able to re-download them. Games with online multiplayer features will also still be functional, though that exists on more of a game-by-game basis. For example, the servers of many Halo games have already been shut down. And while the Microsoft Movies &amp; TV app will no longer work on the 360, your content there transfers to anywhere else you have the app.
Additionally, backwards compatible 360 games will still be available to purchase and play on the Xbox One and Series X/S. While this doesn&#x27;t encompass every game on the 360 store, it does cover most of the platform&#x27;s most popular titles. Xbox linked its full list of backwards compatible games in today&#x27;s announcement post. Here&#x27;s the most recent batch from November 2021:

                              <span>Alan Wake 2 has been a long time coming, but fans will have to wait a little bit longer as the game has been pushed from October 17 to October 27.
In a press release, developer Remedy Entertainment doesn&#x27;t cite a technical reason for the delay, only writing that “October is an amazing month for game launches, and we hope this date shift gives more space for everyone to enjoy their favorite games.”
This likely refers to the fact that Alan Wake 2 was originally going to release just three days before the arrival of heavy hitters Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 and Super Mario Bros. Wonder, which both launch on October 20. The new date now puts it a full week outside of that blast radius, providing some breathing room for players looking to enjoy some or all of those titles around launch. 
Alan Wake 2 unfolds 13 years after the original game and stars two protagonists: the titular author and FBI agent Saga Anderson. Saga is investigating a murder case in the Pacific Northwest, while Alan has been trapped in the nightmarish realm of The Dark Place since the first game&#x27;s conclusion. Players switch between both characters and can play as much or as little of their stories as they see fit. Remedy has stated that the sequel is a pure survival horror title this time around. To learn more about the game, check out our preview of co-protagonist Saga Anderson’s gameplay chapter from Summer Game Fest. 
Alan Wake 2 will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC via the Epic Games Store.</span>

Steeped in religious themes, the narrative of Blasphemous 2 tells of a land unable to overcome the curse placed on it by a higher power, regardless of how repentant its people are. Playing Blasphemous 2, I sometimes felt the same, as I wondered how I could possibly overcome the challenge before me. But like the denizens of The City of the Blessed Name, I persevered. And though the curses being thrown around my house each time I died were of a different variety than those cast in Blasphemous 2’s story, I loved nearly every minute o…</span>

TEKKEN 7, Street Fighter V, MechWarrior 5: Mercenaries ad.) – s dodatkem, že nejlepší výsledky jsou při běhu přes wined3d (Wine implementace Direct3D) namísto obvyklého DXVK (mapujícího Direct3D na Vulkan).</span>

                              <span>When The Messenger was released in 2018, Thierry Boulanger went into its launch with reasonable expectations. He was proud of the game he and the team at Sabotage had made, but he was prepared to consider it a success even if it didn’t sell well. “If 100 People bought it, I would have been like, ‘Oh my God, we hit three digits. So, for sure, there’s at least one person I don’t know that bought it,’” Boulanger says. The Messenger sold far more than 100 copies and even took home The Game Awards’ Best Debut Indie award alongside many other accolades. With its unique approach to platforming and a fun story twist that allowed it to exist as both an NES and SNES throwback, The Messenger was a hit and quickly allowed Boulanger and Sabotage to pursue its dream project: A large-scale RPG unabashedly inspired by 16-bit greats like Chrono Trigger, Super Mario RPG, and many more. “It’s been seven years, and it’s still kind of a dream,” Boulanger says. Read more...</span>

                              <span>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge&#x27;s big DLC Dimension Shellshock finally has a release date, as well as another new playable character. 
The expansion arrives on August 31 for $7.99, and a new trailer reveals that fan-favorite character Karai is joining the fun. Karai is a high-ranking member of the Foot Clan that made her TMNT comics debut in 1992 and has appeared in several animated adaptions. She’s usually depicted as Shredder’s second-in-command but has also been portrayed as his adopted daughter, depending on your choice of Turtles’ lore (perhaps most famously in the 2003 animated series). Despite her allegiance to the Foot, Karai has often been an uneasy ally to the Turtles in the face of mutual threats.


Dimension Shellshock also features Usagi Yojimbo as the other new playable fighter and will include a new survival mode. Today’s trailer shows off some of the new filters, including a neat black-and-white comic-panel style presentation inspired by the original TMNT books. The DLC also features new music from composer Tee Lopes and alternative color schemes for each character.

Going &quot;gold” basically means the game is complete and ready to be sent to be printed on discs and shipped to stores. Bethesda also revealed when players can pre-load the digital version of the game. Xbox players can do so beginning tomorrow, August 17. Steam users get their turn on August 30.

                              <span>Each year, the NHL development team at EA Sports attempts to recreate the fast-paced and hard-hitting sport of professional hockey within its games. While the results have been hit or miss over the last few years, EA Sports aims to deliver myriad updates to NHL 24 to make it feel more authentic to the real-life game of hockey than ever before.
It all revolves around the Exhaust Engine, which is a system that dictates player performance based on stamina while rewarding players for attacking on offense. The new Goalie Fatigue system ensures the goalie isn&#x27;t as effective on the first shot of a power play as he is on follow-up shots. Goalie fatigue levels increase or recover as play goals on, so if the puck is on the other end of the rink for long stretches, that gives the goalie a chance to c…</span>

Baldur’s Gate 3 is a surprisingly human tale. That may sound strange to say about a game with space lizards and brain worms at its center, but behind the hags and psychic tadpoles, Baldur’s Gate 3 is about a group of very broken people trying to find their way in life and maybe save the world. Or turn it into a smoldering heap of agony and misery. It depends on how you feel that day. Whether you choose peace or something less savory, Baldur’s Gate 3’s intricate writing …</span>

                              <span>Gamescom is on the horizon and kicks off with Opening Night Live next week, the E3-style showcase of upcoming games hosted by Geoff Keighley. Today, Keighley revealed that the long-quiet Crimson Desert will make its presence known in the form of new gameplay footage.
Crimson Desert was first revealed at The Game Awards in 2020 and comes from Pearl Abyss, the studio behind the popular MMO Black Desert Online. Crimson Desert is a single-player open-world RPG set in the gritty medieval fantasy world of Pywel. This biodiverse continent is inhabited by humans, fantastical races, and mystical beasts and centers on Macduff, a mercenary who assembles a band of comrades to survive an ensuing power struggle of numerous factions vying to take control of the continent. 
Next Tuesday, join us at @gamescom Opening Night Live, to see a brand new look at the gameplay of CRIMSON DESERT (@CrimsonDesert_) from Pearl Abyss.

The game&#x27;s presentation and tone have Western fantasy vibes reminiscent of series such as Game of Thrones. Combat consists of fast-paced melee combat (both unarmed and with various weapons) and flashy magic abilities. If you haven’t seen Crimson Desert in action, check out this gameplay overview released around the game’s announcement.


Crimson Desert doesn&#x27;t have a release date, but Pearl Abyss CEO Jin-Young Heo stated earlier this year that the game was targeting a fall 2023 release window. We&#x27;ll likely find out of that&#x27;s still the case when Opening Night Live airs on August 22 at 11 a.m. Pacific/2 p.m. Eastern.</span>

                              <span>Vampire Survivors is finally coming to the platform it was always destined for: the Nintendo Switch. Alongside the full game and its DLC being fully playable on Nintendo&#x27;s platform, it also includes a new co-op mode. Join Game Informer&#x27;s Kyle Hilliard and Marcus Stewart to see if the Switch can handle the game firing on all cylinders and to see some of the co-op in action.

I took a look at it for Digital Foundry last year, and it remains one of my top choices in 2023. Now, with three years of burn-in warranty as standard and a modest price reduction from $1079 to $899, it&#x27;s well worth writing up in a US deals post for Rock Paper Shotgun!

                              <span>Hold onto your warp nacelles and hyperdrives, Starfield aficionados. The game&#x27;s lead designer Emil Pagliarulo and lead quest designer Will Shen have hosted a Discord Q&amp;A about Bethesda&#x27;s forthcoming space colossus. Self-despising fool that I am, I sat up late at the office taking notes throughout - please accept a modest avalanche of new details.


First off, a note on the subject of Starfield and housing. You can own property in &quot;all the major cities in the game&quot;, according to Pagliarulo, with some dwellings being purchaseable and others, quest rewards.


Building on the character creation systems of Fallout 3 and Fallout 4, the game features a &quot;Kids Stuff&quot; trait that generates parents based on your choice of custom character, allowing you to inflict your terrible physiognomical experiments on at least two other in-game entities. &quot;No spoilers, but I think fans will really appreciate the actors we got to play those roles,&quot; Pagliarulo added.

                              <span>Lexar&#x27;s Play 1TB Micro SD card is a popular option for anyone that wants to slam a full terabyte of space into their Steam Deck, Switch or other Computing Device on the cheap. Its performance isn&#x27;t quite up there with the fastest options from Samsung or SanDisk, but this memory card still works great on Steam Deck. This Micro SD card normally hovers below the £90 mark, but today it&#x27;s down to a new historic low of just £67, a great value for a Micro SD card of this size!

                              <span>Last time, you decided that Dark Souls bonewheels are better than in-game memorials to players. Reader dear, I now know how you wish to be remembered. I&#x27;m going to ask the lads in corporate if we can launch an official RPS funeral plan whereby you can pre-pay to have your skeleton lashed to a wheel and turned loose round the foot of the RPS treehouse. &quot;It&#x27;s what she always wanted,&quot; your assembled family will say, dabbing at a tear gathered in the creases of a bittersweet smile. This week, I ask you to choose between deadly openings and safe closings. What&#x27;s better: mimics, or tactically sealing doors?

You know what’s also a pretty great puzzle game set in successive rooms you need to escape? Portal. You may have heard of it. And now the two are set to collide in an upcoming bit of free DLC that brings Portal’s test chambers to Escape Simulator.

If you wanted some more proof that Netflix is pretty serious about this whole “getting into video games” thing, the movie streaming platform-turned-games publisher is now looking to unite their two fronts by experimenting with game streaming.

                              <span>The Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood is many, magical things, but initially, at least, it is a card game in which you create your own cards. This takes the form of an MS Paint-esque editor in which you glue together a background, character assets and a collection of props, rotating, duplicating and altering the size of each asset with the mouse. Each asset soaks up a certain amount of arcane energy, divided between the four elements, which mean somewhat different things here than in the spell systems of other games. And each final design generates a different combination of meanings, some of them contradictory at a glance, all of them keys to the game’s weird, whimsical and sorrowful wider universe.
It seems an overly rudimentary system at first, though that’s coming from the perspective of somebody who’s reasonably familiar with Tarot, one of the game’s chief influences, and partial to devising their own crummy decks of visual poetry cards. In particular, I grumped to myself about the limits on shrinking and enlarging: I wanted to fashion more abstract, prog-rock designs with faces in pixellated close-up, whereas The Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood sort of defaults to “dude holding thing against landscape” setups familiar from the Rider-Waite Tarot. While there are pieces you can plug in and leave out as you see fit, the system also insists that you include certain props from each batch, and I’ll admit to using the layer tool to hide unwanted skulls, floral wands and so forth behind other assets.

                              <span>The first game in the Opus series of visual novels (not to be confused with alchemy-themed puzzle machine game Opus Magnum), The Day We Found Earth, begins 14,000 years in the future, on a starship far from our familiar home planet. The humans in this far-flung future don’t even remember their ancestral home - it’s just a rumour, a fantasy. Yet that rumour is driving scientist Lisa, as it may be all that humanity has left. Players control a robot, Emeth, trained by the humans Lisa and Makoto to ‘find’ Earth, in the hope that reconnecting with the past will solve the issues facing humanity in the present.


Opus may lean into the sci-fi aspects with its visuals and setting, but The Day We Found Earth and its sequels, 2018&#x27;s Rocket Of Whispers and 2021&#x27;s Echo Of Starsong (which Katharine absolutely loved), are ultimately story-driven games with a human core far warmer than the coldness of space. Sigono announced a new entry, Opus: Prism Peak, earlier this year. &quot;They’re narrative adventure titles that have heartfelt stories that always touch on themes of love and self-fulfilment,&quot; is what studio co-founder Scott Chen emphasises to me, as we start our conversation on the hectic floor of Bitsummit, Japan’s largest indie games event.

I know there&#x27;s a dungeon master, or DM, who directs proceedings behind a cardboard shield. I know you lob some dice to determine the outcomes of an adventure that&#x27;s contained in the heads of everyone at the roundtable. And that&#x27;s about it.
Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 is based on D&amp;D&#x27;s 5th edition and it&#x27;s meant to honour its rules to the absolute tee. I&#x27;m sure it does! To be honest, though, I haven&#x27;t exactly learned much about D&amp;D by playing it. I don&#x27;t even think of myself as playing D&amp;D, instead I&#x27;m just playing an RPG whose complexity adds a nice mystery to proceedings.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve not played a huge amount of Dungeons &amp; Dragons, but I get why those kids from Stranger Things won&#x27;t stop banging on about it. It turns out all those librarians in the 90s were right: using your imagination really is cool and fun! Indeed, our ability to conjure fiction from the ether is fundamental to the ongoing success of D&amp;D. Making up stories with friends is very much a good time, and if you get to kill a goblin or two in the process? Well. That&#x27;s just gravy.


Built upon the foundations of D&amp;D&#x27;s fifth edition ruleset, Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 attempts to translate the fundamentals of the game into digital form. But how successful is it at doing so? Can a video game - with all the rigidity that comes with the medium - replicate the freedom of a table-top role playing game?

                              <span>Winding back the clock to rewrite past mistakes is a core stratagem of any Mimimi game. Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 might have rekindled the debate about save-scumming over in RPG circles, but in the stealth strategy arena where Mimimi operate, reaching for the F5 and F8 keys to quick load a previous save is as natural as swapping between your party members on 123, or activating their unique abilities to clobber all manner of unsuspecting guards on the back of the head with ASD and F.
In their latest real-time tactics-me-do Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew, however, the act of quick saving has been woven directly into the language of the game, presented not as cold, hard button commands, but as &#x27;captured memories&#x27; that your magical ghost ship The Red Marley is able to unleash to make sure your supernatural pirate crew don&#x27;t get caught or die (again) on the job.

                              <span>MiHoYo have released Genshin Impact 4.0&#x27;s update, adding a new area, story elements, characters, domains and equipment to the gacha-driven free-to-play action RPG, which I remember having a lot of fun with last year. I&#x27;ve since inhaled a vast amount of shonen anime, and have accordingly been looking for a moment to reconnect with Genshin, one of the better anime games on the shop - perhaps this is it.


As Rebecca (RPS in peace, sob) wrote last week, Genshin Impact 4.0&#x27;s big new feature is the the sunken kingdom of Fontaine, which you can dive into after completing prologue mission Act III and unlocking the associated teleport waypoint in Sumeru. That&#x27;s literally dive into: Fontaine - not to be confused with the nice man from the Bronx you encounter in Bioshock - is water-themed, and there&#x27;s a new mechanic, Fontaine&#x27;s Blessing, which allows you to navigate local lakes, together with a Lucin Fountain system that can be levelled up for certain items.

Tantalisingly, these include a few changes asked for by players. &quot;Our focus now is fixing any issues you report, but we are listening to suggestions,&quot; Vincke wrote on Xitter. &quot;Current roadmap: a) Hotfix 4, b) Patch 1 (+1000 fixes and tweaks), c) Patch 2. The latter will already incorporate some requests.&quot; What could those requested incorporations be? Here are a few possibilities derived from my own crystal ball.

You get a 4K resolution for pin-sharp graphics and text, a 144Hz refresh rate and Fast IPS panel for excellent motion handling, and a 27-inch span that fits easily onto a desk or monitor arm. After debuting at an eye-watering $800, this monitor has dropped on Amazon.com to a more reasonable $543.

                              <span>Being a reviewer during Big Game Season often feels like being chased through a massive, winding building in a serial killer movie (or possibly Until Dawn). You gallop shrieking and blundering round a corner and are confronted by a series of ominous doors with labels such as &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3&quot;. You only have a few seconds to pick one and dive through, sweating in the knowledge that each door leads to a confusing network of corridors that exist wholly apart from each other - that each door not opened is a route to an Elsewhere you are doomed to never know, unless you&#x27;re commissioned to do a, haha, &quot;retrospective&quot; 10 years later.
This summer, in my previous dishonourable capacity as a freelancer, I barged through the doors marked &quot;Zelda&quot; and &quot;Final Fantasy 16&quot;, then spent a frantic moment trying to force the &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3&quot; door, before giving up and throwing myself under a heap of unedited features. Now, in the relative lull before the monster named Starfield crashes through the ceiling (yes, I know, I&#x27;m mixing my scenarios - it&#x27;s the end of the day and I&#x27;m tired), I emerge from the heap reborn as RPS News Editor, and peer back fearfully at some of the doors I left unopened. By far the grimmest and grandest of these is, of course, Diablo 4.

                              <span>Paradox have posted a Cities: Skylines 2 developer diary in which the studio discusses the new game&#x27;s rather elaborate-sounding economy simulation. This follows equally knotty breakdowns of its zoning tools, which allow you to mix architectural styles, and its road traffic system, which will hopefully dispense with some of the pathfinding issues from the original Cities: Skylines. In unravelling how individual agents - households, businesses or city services - function within the simulation, the post also touches on the topic of homelessness, a subject the 2014 game left unaddressed.

                              <span>There are loads of good Steam Deck games – as in, games that happen to play well on a Steam Deck, even if they were originally crafted around desktop hardware and intended to be poked around with a mouse and keyboard. This is a joy of the portable PC in itself: that if you already have a populated Steam library, a box-fresh Deck will immediately have a selection of familiar favourites to install at no extra cost. 
Still. While the Steam Deck doesn’t do exclusives, it does have a killer app. Nearly a year and a half after Valve surprise-launched Aperture Desk Job alongside their handheld, the comedy tech demo remains unsurpassed as a playable introduction to the hardware. Again, there are thousands of compatible games, but if you’ve just recently grabbed a Steam Deck (perhaps via the new official refurb scheme), Aperture Desk Job could hardly be more perfect as an inaugural install.

                              <span>I have, for the past several weeks, been playing Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3, the RPG equivalent of paying for ex-special forces lads to kidnap you at an unappointed day when you&#x27;re walking your labradoodle, and put you through a rigorous (pretend) interrogation schedule. Will you learn something? Will it occupy your waking thoughts until it&#x27;s over? Is the commitment of everyone involved assured? Yes. But would describe the experience as restful? Extremely debatable.
Hammerwatch 2 is out today, and it&#x27;s kind of an isometric RPG that you can play in multiplayer, and which is at base kind of hacky-and-slashy, but has stacking complexity the more you play. It&#x27;s like paying for ex-special forces lads to read a choose your own adventure book to you, but they get really into doing the voices. I feel comfortable describing the pixel art as &quot;adorable&quot;, and it makes everything seem like it&#x27;s a cute little miniature you can hold in your hand. Hence Mighty Max, which was a key part of my childhood. I don&#x27;t want to say that Hammerwatch 2 is easy, because that isn&#x27;t quite right and there&#x27;s some jank lurking in there. But what it is, is easy to get a handle on. It has also functioned as a way of reintegrating my diseased Faerûined mind back into normal society.

                              <span>SPOILER WARNING FOR PEOPLE SENSITIVE TO SPOILERS. SPOILERS. I HAVE WARNED YOU. RIGHT, ONTO SPOILER TERRITORY.
I met this really nice bard in Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 called Alfira the other day. She was perched on a rock, swinging a sweet medley to a couple of squirrels. Being the bard Edders Sheeran, I wandered over and listened to her perform. She kept getting stuck on some verses, so I helped her fill in the blanks. Then things went Disney, as the camera pulled away and circled her as she performed a beautiful ballad, one dedicated to her late teacher. She seemed content, belting out the ballad. The squirrels, it turns out, thought her voice was awful.
Anyway, she took me by surprise much later on as I slew the last of some goblin leaders. She snuck into danger just to say she wanted to join our adventures; see the world! I, Edders Sheeran, was thankful to have such a ray of sunshine enter the camp. &quot;Of course, we&#x27;d love to have you,&quot; I replied. What could possibly go wrong?

                              <span>Sclash is gorgeous. That&#x27;s not the reason I&#x27;m writing about it, but it definitely helps. Style can&#x27;t fix a bad game, but it can elevate a decent one about, say, a little hand-drawn 2D samurai running across the world stabbing dudes for peace. Little Jinmu does a lot of running to the right, a lot of slashing, and probably very little parrying and punching once you figure out the power attack.


There is, bluntly, not a lot to it, especially while its online mode is still listed as &quot;coming soon&quot;. But even with remote multiplayer, I see this as more of a diversion for friends to enjoy than a serious competitive fighter and intentionally so.


I enjoyed it though. Actually, I think I enjoyed it more for that, though it does perhaps limit its audience.

                              <span>This week I wrote a little post alerting you, my best friends, to the existence of Murdle. This weekend I went to town and bought a copy of the Murdle book - or, I should say, Volume 1, because you can already pre-order Volume 2. It&#x27;s a chunky enough tome made up of 100 of the puzzles that form Murdle&#x27;s daily little treat, split into sections of escalating difficulty. And, against my expectations, and despite basically being a vehicle for logic grid puzzles, Murdle has an actual plot. Which is more than many video games manage.

                              <span>Star Wars is no stranger to video game adaptation. In fact, depending on your age, video games may be the primary way you interact with the far away galaxy from a long time ago. Outlaws, however, represent something new for the franchise, even if it isn’t new to video games. We’ve shot from the first-person perspective in Battlefront, explored labyrinthine, Metroid-inspired levels in Respawn’s Jedi games, and even commanded armies in Empire at War, but Outlaws is the first time we will explore an open Star Wars world.
Following a panel on the game at Comic-Con, we spoke with Outlaws&#x27; narrative director, Navid Khavari, over e-mail about a number of topics related to the game, including potential overlap with Shadows of the Empire, what exactly protagonist Kay Vess is going after, the fate o…</span>

                              <span>Bungie is holding its annual Destiny 2 Showcase on August 22. The event will shed more light on The Final Shape expansion and other upcoming events.
The event airs at 9 a.m. Pacific/12 p.m. Eastern with an hour-long pre-show prior and a live post-show roundtable discussion. The Final Shape is a significant expansion for fans as it’s billed as the conclusion to the Light and Darkness Saga. That means everything that has occurred up to this point will culminate with this story. Speaking of which, Bungie released a new video recapping the biggest moments of the Destiny journey.


The showcase will also dive into Season 22, the next reprised raid, among other announcements. For more on Destiny 2, check out our review of its most recent expansion Lightfall, then read about how Keith David has been cast as the new voice of Commander Zavala.

                              <span>After a four-year legal process that began before the coronavirus pandemic, Italian film production company Lux Vide has emerged with a $1.86m judgment against the operator of file-hosting platform Easybytez. A Michigan district court found Sven Hansche liable for 748 violations of copyright law and was guided on damages awarded in lawsuits against IPTV providers Nitro TV and Area 51.

                              <span>BREIN is systematically taking down pirate IPTV services, especially those that cater to Dutch consumers. The anti-piracy group recently closed the books on a multi-year case against the once-largest IPTV service in the Netherlands. While the matter had a successful outcome, it took multiple trips to court to wrap things up neatly.

                              <span>Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage is one of the most anticipated games of 2023, and after years of rumors and delays, its release date is still just out of reach. However, that wait has been shortened just a little; today, Ubisoft revealed that the game has gone gold, and since they&#x27;re done ahead of schedule, it will now come out on October 5th, a week earlier than previously announced.

The game follows Basim Ibn Ishaq, an Assassin previously introduced as a supporting character in 2020&#x27;s Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla. While the series was traditionally about stealth-focused combat in dense cities, more recent entries have put the player into more open-world environments and incorporated RPG mechanics. Mirage is a return to that classic formula of old, complete with the iconic white hood, hidden blade, and parkour. Set in Baghdad, the game takes place 12 years before the events in Valhalla.
In an era where it feels like games are constantly being delayed, it&#x27;s a nice change of pace when a game is moved up instead. Recently, Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 moved its PC release up to avoid competing with &quot;other RPGs,&quot; which most likely refers to Starfield. Mirage&#x27;s new date doesn&#x27;t seem to be motivated by the desire to avoid competition, but it does pull it a little ahead of the other huge games releasing in October, specifically Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2 and Super Mario Bros. Wonder, which both come out on October 20.

Through a new trailer that premiered at the Pokémon World Championships last weekend, we&#x27;ve learned that The Indigo Disk, part two of the DLC, will have returning favorites, brand-new moves, and a mysterious nineteenth Tera Type.


Right off the bat, the trailer starts with an exciting reveal: every past first partner Pokémon (known more commonly as &quot;starters&quot;) will be returning in the Winter expansion. In most games in the series, starters can only be obtained at the very start of the game, and you can only ever obtain one of three. They&#x27;re also typically exclusive to every region, so partner Pokémon from Gold…</span>

                              <span>The Internet Archive&#x27;s online book lending library will be severely limited to avoid copyright liability. The library and book publishers have agreed the terms of a judgment that leaves one crucial question open for the court. While restrictions are unavoidable, for now, the Internet Archive is eager to reverse the court&#x27;s liability ruling on appeal.

                              <span>During today&#x27;s THQ Nordic Digital Showcase, we learned about a new game starring everyone&#x27;s favorite raunchy Colorado kids. South Park: Snow Day looks to carry on the series&#x27; legacy of over-the-top and mature-rated humor while still viewing life through the eyes of children. 
Starring the core group of Cartman, Stan, Kyle, and Kenny, players take part in celebrations surrounding the magical occasion of a snow day. Four players can join together in this co-op title on a quest to save the world during a day without school. You can see the teaser trailer for this game below.


We don&#x27;t have many more details surrounding the title, but the game is in development by Question Games, a  studio based in California and Virginia. In the past, the studio has worked on The Blackout Club and The Magic Circle. South Park: Snow Day! is set to arrive on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC in 2024.</span>

                              <span>A little while has passed since the release of 2.7.0, and we are now excited to present you with the bugfix release 2.7.1.
We have included a significant amount of fixes and small improvements, in particular:
Added ScummVM Log file viewer, so you can easily report the problems on platforms with limited file access, e.g. Android, iOS or even modern Windows.
Fixed the shader-based scaler loading on some platforms.
Added multiple improvements to AGI, AGS, Cryomni3D and 12 more engines.
We also improved the detection of Broken Sword 1 &amp; Broken Sword 2, so more original versions get properly detected. Thank you to those who submitted bug reports about this, and if you still locate a version that is not recognised, please report it to us (beware that the frankenstein versions that are floating around the internet will not be accepted, only those copied from the original media).
For the full and comprehensive list of notable changes, please refer to the Release Notes.
If you are as excited about the release as we are, you can share our joy by downloading it from our downloads page. If you are using Windows, macOS, or either of the Ubuntu Snap or Flatpack packages, the autoupdater will pick up the ScummVM 2.7.1 release automatically. For our Android app users, the update will be available on the Play Store.
Thank you very much for your continued support. Enjoy!
