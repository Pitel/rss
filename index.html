                              <span>Last year, a game was released on the Nintendo Switch in Japan called Crayon Shin-chan: Ora to Hakase no Natsuyasumi (Crayon Shin-chan: My Summer Vacation With The Professor). A crossover between legendary manga Crayon Shin-chan and the long-running My Summer Vacation series of video games, it looked slow and cruisy…

The new bill could make it harder for studios to recruit and keep talent in a part of Canada that contains numerous big game studios and companies.

You know, for every kind of business I&#x27;ve (attempted to) manage in simulation games, I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ve ever been on the hook for an up-and-coming summer camp. Cities, zoos, prisons, and farms, sure, but never a summer camp. Camp Canyonwood is coming to Steam Early Access on August 4, and it&#x27;ll task us with keeping campers in line, expanding the campground, and exploring mysteries in a Don&#x27;t Starve-ish world. I&#x27;m intrigued.

The best part of the trailer is arguably the end, where it&#x27;s confirmed that ghosts, UFOs, and other oddities are in the mix. And who&#x27;s that ominous figure?
Everything up to that point looked fine, in a familiar way, and I&#x27;m hopeful that the story isn&#x27;t afraid to get dark and weird and a bit …</span>

                              <span>Little mouse, big adventures
The Spirit and the Mouse is an upcoming narrative puzzle platformer from Alblune Games, an indie team made up of two developers, Lucie Lescuyer and Alex Strook. Players will take on the role of a mouse named Lila who lives in a quaint French village, making friends with little electric spirit friends and helping out the local townspeople.
The game&#x27;s trailer shows off the cozy setting, some of the characters that we&#x27;ll meet, and of course, some gameplay segments of Lila running along rooftops and using electricity powers. The Spirit and the Mouse looks like one of those games that gives you plenty to do, but lets you go at your own pace and chill out, which is a perfect combination in my eyes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;H5jpnShiiLs
I&#x27;ll be interested to see what kind of narrative they have going on too, because we didn&#x27;t get to see a lot of that from the trailer, but I have a feeling it&#x27;s going to make me feel all warm and fuzzy (and not just because of the electricity). Another highlight from the trailer for me is definitely the music — I love an upbeat, jazzy score, so this might turn out to be one of those game soundtracks I have on a loop for a while.
I also never would have guessed just from looking at it that The Spirit and the Mouse was made by only two people. It looks great and well-polished — we&#x27;ll have to see what it&#x27;s like in practice when it comes out later this year. Alblune promises a wholesome, heartwarming experience with this one, and based on vibes alone, The Spirit and the Mouse feels like it might be in the same vein as the highly-anticipated Stray. Either way, we&#x27;re always in need of more uplifting games out there.
The Spirit and the Mouse is set to electrify us sometime in 2022 on PC and Nintendo Switch, and a demo is available to play right now on Steam.

                              <span>&quot;Thank you for your support&quot;
New figures from Square Enix claim that NieR: Automata sold 6.5 million units since launch, which was a staggering five-ish years ago.
The announcement comes from the game&#x27;s official US Twitter account, as well as the Japanese Twitter arm. Both tweets thank fans for their support, while the Japanese one reminds us that the game came out five years ago somehow, and this past February was actually the fifth anniversary (周年) of its release.
Well, it looks like it&#x27;s going to sell a little more, too, as the company just announced that NieR: Automata is coming to Switch later this year in October. This version will include prior DLC, as well as new outfits. At this point, you have a ton of Switch-only players who are going to bite, as well as double/triple-dippers.
To that end, that same account announced that there will be a five-year anniversary event held on November 25 and November 26 later in 2022. It&#x27;ll take place at the Tokyo Garden Theater, and there&#x27;s currently a lottery event so that folks can attend. There&#x27;s a lot of NieR: Automata news popping up this week all of a sudden! It&#x27;s always a pleasure to remember that this game exists, and it&#x27;s still wild to me after all these years to see a NieR/Drakengard-adjacent game getting so much buzz.

                              <span>Paid gaming subscriptions to hit record high
Modern gaming subscriptions, such as PlayStation Plus, Nintendo Online, and Xbox Game Pass, continue to rake in millions of dollars each year and are currently set to hit a record number of subscribers by the end of 2022.
According to the number crunchers over at DFC Intelligence, revenue from paid subscription services is set to grow in the second half of the year — with money earned from each service&#x27;s respective subscribers expected to offset what is predicted to be a weaker winter period for the industry. DFC predicts that roughly a third of the overall revenue for Nintendo, PlayStation, and Xbox will come from subscription fees, rather than straight game sales.
It&#x27;s difficult to argue against such predictions. The Xbox Game Pass service has all but reignited the Xbox brand in the aftermath of the somewhat submissive Xbox One years. Additionally, the recently revamped PlayStation Plus service is expected to see many users upgrade their standard subscription to the new &quot;Extra&quot; and &quot;Premium&quot; tiers, adding further free titles and access to a library of classic titles.
2022 — and the ninth generation in general — has been tentative for the industry, hindered by the COVID-19 pandemic and its major impact on the production and distribution of games, accessories, and hardware. Through subscription services, players have been able to receive instant access to a huge variety of new, recent, and old-school releases — for a relatively nominal fee. Much like Netflix and other paid streaming services changed the game for movies and television, gaming subscriptions are fast becoming a major component for our corner of the entertainment industry.

                              <span>Some fantastic songwriters are on board for this adventure
When Mario and the Rabbids hit the battlefield this October, they&#x27;ll have some solid tracks backing them. During today&#x27;s Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope showcase, Ubisoft unveiled three well-known composers crafting the tunes behind the battles.
Grant Kirkhope, the BAFTA-nominated composer, is back for the new Mario + Rabbids game. Joining him to contribute to the soundtrack are Gareth Coker and Yoko Shimomura.
Coker accrued many accolades and recognition for his work on the Ori series. Shimomura, meanwhile, is a legendary name in the world of video game music with credits on everything from Final Fight and Live a Live to Kingdom Hearts and, particularly relevant, the Mario &amp; Luigi RPG series. This trio of composers could mean very, very good things for the tunes of Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope.

A tactical approach
Alongside what looks like a stellar lineup for the music, we also got a look at some more gameplay of Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope. It&#x27;s still a tactical adventure, mixing action and platforming with a turn-based strategy system.
A few new faces are joining the fray, including the sword-wielding Rabbid Edge, the Rabbid version of Rosalina, and the big lizard himself: Bowser. Bowser was shown in yesterday&#x27;s Nintendo Direct Mini, but today we got a little more of a look at him and his, uh, Bowzooka?

With a release date set for this October 20, Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope is entering a fairly busy fall. But this new adventure looks like a fun, interesting twist on the systems of the first. With even more composer star-power behind it, Sparks of Hope might be one for Switch owners to watch out for this fall.

[Update: Following a right-on-cue leak, Sony has confirmed the PlayStation Plus games for July: Crash Bandicoot 4: It’s About Time, The Dark Pictures Anthology: Man of Medan, and Arcadegeddon. PS Plus Essential subscribers (and above) can claim them starting July 5.]
Death, Taxes, and the leaking of next month&#x27;s PlayStation Plus offerings — sunrise, sunset, and all that. Yes, it seems that regular PS Plus spoiler billbil-kun of Dealabs has blessed us with a sneak peek at the free titles had to all PlayStation Plus subscribers in July — as spotted this weekend by VGC.
And, y&#x27;know what? Next month isn&#x27;t looking too shabby at all.

During yesterday&#x27;s Nintendo Direct presentation, Bandai Namco revealed that it is developing a remake of the 1999 PlayStation adventure Pac-Man World, starring the company&#x27;s eponymous mascot and his memorable crew of friends and enemies. Unfortunately, however, it seems that one family member will be conspicuous by their absence.
Pac-Man World Re-Pac, (neat name), will once again see the pill-popping hero on a quest to rescue his family from the villainous Toc-Man, who has not only kidnapped the spherical clan but also chosen to perform this nasty deed on Pac-Man&#x27;s birthday! What a complete bastard. While the remake will feature a fully revitalized replication of the original 3D platform adventure in its entirety, tiresome red tape will call for alterations to be made pertaining to…</span>

Tri-Ace&#x27;s next entry in the Star Ocean series has set a date. Star Ocean: The Divine Force will launch on October 27, 2022 for PlayStation and Xbox consoles, as well as PC.
A new trailer for Star Ocean: The Divine Force premiered on Square Enix&#x27;s channels today, highlighting the gameplay, story, and setting of this new RPG. Alongside a story blending the worlds of fantasy and sci-fi together, it looks like a colorful cast of characters will be available to recruit in-game. This trailer gives us a few good looks at the new crew working together in battles, as well as some of the 3D world exploration.

Blizzard is putting out a rather large Diablo II: Resurrected patch today, and it aims to address backend stuff to make the game smoother.
The chief thing it tackles is matchmaking, as well as lobby displays. The Resurrected team admits that these elements weren&#x27;t working as well as they should have, so you should see more games populated than before as of today when the patch is live. &quot;Any number of games in your region that have a strong enough connection&quot; are now visible, and the game list has been doubled from 20 to 40, with a real-time ticker/updates. Both consoles and PC players will see the benefits of this change.
Online play has also been siloed into three categories: private, game creator (a more customizable form of public game), and g…</span>

                              <span>600 Platinum Points via My Nintendo
A My Nintendo Fire Emblem Warriors reward is coming soon, but don&#x27;t get too excited! For 600 platinum you&#x27;ll net a memo pad.
Announced by way of My Nintendo news, the reward will contain &quot;full color images&quot; of both versions of new protagonist Shez, as well as several key characters in the narrative (including members of the titular &quot;three&quot; houses). Typically it takes roughly 1-2 weeks for these rewards to go primetime.
Here&#x27;s the full description from Nintendo:
&quot;Jot down battle strategies, take notes, or simply doodle &#x27;til you drop with this full-color memo pad themed after the new Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes game for the Nintendo Switch system. Its pages feature stunning character art of new protagonist Shez (both male and female variants), Arval, Edelgard, Dimitri, and Claude.&quot;

Currently the listing is not live. In fact, if you click on it, it&#x27;ll bring you to this random printable Triangle Strategy box art cover page. But having followed rewards like this closely for some time, I wouldn&#x27;t expect it to sell out instantly. In fact, several recent rewards like the Mario Strikers bag and the Switch Sports cooling towel are still up for grabs. Stranger things have happened in terms of items running out of stock, but this one should be fine within a 24-hour window of going live; at least.

Proletariat has announced that it is preparing to shut down its fantasy battle royale title Spellbreak.

As reported by VentureBeat, the studio has been acquired by Blizzard Entertainment, and will now work support duties on World of Warcraft.

                              <span>The trailer is out now, the full thing arrives on June 27
In case you&#x27;ve been wondering why there&#x27;s been some GoldenEye 64 news this year, note that it&#x27;s the 25th anniversary of the series (amid rumors that it could be coming back in some capacity). That&#x27;s partially why it&#x27;s getting a whole GoldenEye 64 documentary!
Directed by documentarian Drew Roller, it&#x27;ll bring us through the journey of the game &quot;developer in a farmhouse in Warwickshire by a small ragtag team of university graduates, most of whom had never worked on a game before.&quot; Based on the trailer, the doc will take a look at how GoldenEye 64 (among several other games), changed the way shooters were perceived on consoles. There&#x27;s interviews with past developers afoot, as well as tons of classic late &#x27;90s footage sprinkled in to take some of us back: or give younger folks a frame of reference for the &quot;Xtreme/Attitude&quot; period of the industry.
If you&#x27;re interested, you can find the site for the production team here, which is where it&#x27;ll debut in digital format on June 27. Although the digital platforms differ by region, it&#x27;s currently being sold on iTunes [Apple TV] for roughly $9.99 USD, and the film clocks in at one hour and 39 minutes.
It&#x27;s starting to get to the point where a lot of these retro games are &quot;ancient history,&quot; and can be looked at in the same way that old relics of the past (like Pong) were just 20 years ago. I&#x27;ve come to accept it!
[Update: The documentary is out now. The digital platform options now include Prime Video, Sky, and Google Play in addition to Apple TV.]

                              <span>Before it was even officially out a full day
Nexon&#x27;s absurdist, highly enjoyable fighting title DNF Duel launched yesterday, and it wasn&#x27;t even 24 hours before modders were already adding popular anime and gaming heroes into the PC edition of fast-paced fighter — such is the way of the FGC and its incredibly talented modding community.

The first that caught my eye was this wonderful skin of Persona 5&#x27;s button-down bookworm Makoto Nijima, whose skin fits like a glove over DNF&#x27;s martial arts cutie-pie, Striker. Created by modder Monkeygigabuster, the skin sees the school president rocking her &quot;Queen&quot; biker persona, throwing out fists and feet in keeping with her own martial arts expertise. A video from YouTuber DanteLive4Game spotlights the skin in…</span>

                              <span>Available to Nintendo Switch Online members
Nintendo Switch Online subscribers can spend their extra Platinum Points on player icons, and this week, Nintendo added new avatars based on The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Now we&#x27;re talking! Since I last spoke about these wave-based profile pics, I&#x27;ve mostly tuned them out — but today is a big exception. Among other options, it&#x27;s possible to set your Switch icon as the revolting (and amusingly censored) Dubious Food.
Link, Zelda, Urbosa, Revali, Tera, and a riled-up Bokoblin — the gang&#x27;s all here. If you want to be prim and proper, the choice is yours. My eyes immediately darted elsewhere.
[caption id&#x3D;&quot;attachment_332306&quot; align&#x3D;&quot;alignnone&quot; width&#x3D;&quot;1920&quot;] Zelda: Breath of the Wild player icons are up for grabs until July 4 at 5:59 p.m. Pacific.[/caption]
If you&#x27;re feeling bold, you&#x27;ll drop 10 points on the Dubious Food and swap it in as your (permanent?) new Nintendo Switch player icon. Well, at least until the joke wears thin.
You can find the current selection from your Switch home screen — click on the red Switch Online icon, then scroll down to Missions &amp; Rewards to see what&#x27;s available.
This whole &quot;weekly avatars&quot; scheme is still pretty fresh, with tons of games and imagery to pull from, so I think it&#x27;s amusing that Nintendo is willing to include some off-kilter imagery this early into the proceedings. If anything, the trick is just getting people to pay attention — I would&#x27;ve totally missed the Dubious Food if not for a Reddit shout-out.
After appearing in Breath of the Wild and Age of Calamity, I&#x27;ll be bummed if this so-called food doesn&#x27;t return for the sequel. I hope it&#x27;s even more of a wildcard next time around.

                              <span>Favorites from Spy X Family, Kaiju No. 8, and more guest in this tactics game
There were a bunch of third-party games shown in today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct Mini Partner Showcase, but one in particular threw me at first glance. Captain Velvet Meteor: The Jump+ Dimensions is an upcoming tactical RPG that leans into guests from the Shonen Jump+ catalog.
The new tactics game from Momo-Pi Game Studio and Shueisha Games follows Damien, a boy who&#x27;s just moved to Japan. Feeling lonely in his new home, he dives into his imagination as the superhero Captain Velvet Meteor.
Along the way, he imagines a roster of his favorite Jump+ characters filling his adventures. It&#x27;s an interesting premise, emphasized by the presence of actual famous faces from the Shonen Jump+ lineup.

                              <span>Despite some growing pains, it&#x27;s a good time to fall off inflatables
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout is free-to-play now, for close to a week. Over the last weekend, I spent hours getting back in; acclimating to the new model, browsing the new rewards, and marveling at all that&#x27;s changed since I dropped off. And despite some early wrinkles, I can&#x27;t really deny it. It&#x27;s a good time to be back into Fall Guys.
It&#x27;s almost impossible for me to divorce Fall Guys from the moment when it launched. It was the first summer of the pandemic, and with everyone inside and socially distanced, Fall Guys was a welcome reprieve. Much like Animal Crossing: New Horizons, it became a forum for social interaction. But that&#x27;s not to say Fall Guys wasn&#x27;t good on its own merits, either.

                              <span>Monster Rancher was revived late last year with the release of the Monster Ranger 1&amp;2 DX collection, and Bandai Namco isn&#x27;t going to stop there. In fact, the series is going bigger. Much bigger!


The first trailer for Ultra Kaiju Monster Rancher asks a crucial question, &quot;How would you like to raise your very own Ultra Kaiju?&quot; To which I responded, &quot;Yes, please. I&#x27;d very much like that. Give it to me now.&quot; Foregoing the dull, average-sized creatures you used to raise in Monster Rancher, Ultra Kaiju Monster Rancher lets you take care of some colossal sweet boys. You&#x27;ll raise the likes of Zettan, Gomora, and Alien Baltan – all licensed Kaiju from the Ultraman franchise. Many other existing Kaiju appear in the game, and you&#x27;ll take them to help townsfolk in ways only a giant monster could. You can also participate in massive monster battles or watch the colossal beings waddle like big clumsy babies. As a fun bonus, the Kaiju can be bred, making wild combinations of their attributes appear in their children. It all seems like a lot of goofy fun.
We&#x27;re not sure if Ultra Kaiju Monster Rancher is coming to North America, but it&#x27;s slated to hit Japan and Southeast Asia this year. At the very least, a version will be translated into English for those looking to import.</span>

2017&#x27;s Mario + Rabbids: Kingdom Battle pleasantly surprised players by deftly combining two very different universes and utilizing the unexpected template of a turn-based tactics game. Five years later, a sequel, Sparks of Hope, launches on October 20 and builds upon the winning formula while also shaking up the foundation to make it more than a retread.
Speaking to the game&#x27;s associate producer Christina Nava, Ubisoft was pleased as punch at Kingdom Battle&#x27;s success and how it entertained turn-based strategy fans and non-fans alike. 
&quot;We were particularly happy by the fact that we saw many players who were not too used to the tacti…</span>

                              <span>Tri-Ace and Square Enix have largely kept quiet about Star Ocean The Divine Force since its reveal last fall, but that changed in a big way today. In addition to dropping not one, not two, but three videos fleshing out the game&#x27;s narrative, characters, and combat, we now know the JRPG launches in October. 
The Divine Force arrives on October 27, exactly one year after it was first announced. The first trailer showcases the plot with a montage of out-of-context story clips that sets the tone for what&#x27;s to come in the sci-fi action RPG. 


The second video provides a more thorough walkthrough of Star Ocean&#x27;s characters and combat. Players assume the role of one of two protagonists: Raymond Lawrence, a hot-headed merchant ship captain searching for his lost crew, and Laeticia Aucerius, a princess fighting to save her kingdom from destruction. The story unfolds differently depending on your chosen hero, and a ragtag party of allies accompanies each. The action-focused combat utilizes four party members players can swap between on the fly. You can battle in real-time or pause the action using Stop Mode to allow time to change tactics.  


Lastly, you watch the entire 8-minute opening cinematic for Raymond&#x27;s campaign to see how the adventure kicks off for the young captain. 


Tri-Ace promises to share more information in a future Mission Report video. Star Ocean The Divine Force will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.</span>

More specifically, Fallen Angel will hit Switch on July 19, meaning there’s already less than a month left until you can take the archangel experience with you on the go. If you aren’t familiar with Fallen Angel, you can get a look at what awaits you in it in the special Switch announcement trailer below: 


As you can see in the trailer above, there are a lot of hellacious things going on, which makes sense considering you control Lucifer as he attempts to ascend from hell to get revenge on those who banished him from heaven.

                              <span>Yesterday, Spellbreak developer Proletariat released a blog post detailing the future of its spell-based battle royale that launched years ago. In it, the studio revealed that the servers for Spellbreak will shut down in early 2023, effectively ending the run of this battle royale. 
This shutdown likely had to do with the game’s low player count. Still, there might be more to it than that: Blizzard Entertainment, the studio behind franchises like Overwatch and Warcraft, is acquiring Proletariat and using its force of roughly 100 employees to staff up its World of Warcraft team, according to a new report from GamesBeat. 
“We are putting players at the forefront of everything we do, and we are working hard to both meet and exceed their expectations,” Blizzard president Mike Ybarra told the publication in a statement. “A big part of caring for our teams is making sure we have the resources to produce experiences our communities will love while giving our teams space to explore even more creative opportunities within their projects. Proletariat is a perfect fit for supporting Blizzard’s mission in bringing high-quality content to our players more often.” 
This news comes just months before the launch of the newest World of Warcraft expansion, Dragonflight, which you can read more about here. As noted by GamesBeat, this acquisition is one of the largest in recent memory for Blizzard. This purchase means that the Proletariat team will be under the Microsoft-Xbox umbrella soon following the completion of Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard.
According to the GamesBeat report, the purpose of this acquisition is to beef up World of Warcraft staff numbers so “that it can hit quality and timing goals for expansions.” Neither of the involved parties has publicly released a price for this transaction.

                              <span>With Atari&#x27;s 50th anniversary happening this week, the company has revealed Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration. This classic compilation of games stretches beyond the standard game-collection bundles we&#x27;ve seen in the past, with aspirations of serving as a virtual, interactive museum to paint a picture of just how influential and important Atari was, particularly through the nascent years of the video game industry. I went hands-on with Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration to see how well it accomplishes that lofty goal.
At its core, Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration delivers more than 90 playable games in one $40 package. Players can expect classic and retro titles from six hardware platforms (Atari 2600, 5200, 7800, ST, Jaguar, and Lynx), all with emulation created by renowned re…</span>

                              <span>You’ve probably heard of or played Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes, the character-collecting adventure set in a galaxy far, far away. The mobile game launched in 2015 and, in the years that followed, amassed a substantial fanbase that continues to get support from sizeable roster updates. The creators behind Galaxy of Heroes recently formed Azra Games. And the studios’ debut title will appropriately be a collectible and combat RPG called Legions &amp; Legends. 
Azra Games CEO and co-founder Mark Otero excitedly spoke about the announcement of the new game:
“This will be my ninth collectible and combat RPG, one that builds upon and perfects the genre I’ve spent my entire career developing. I truly believe that we’ve cracked the code for a captivating gameplay experience built around the joys of collecting toys and taking them to battle against each other, just as we used to do when we were kids. At Azra, we’re looking to bring back that excitement of the toy box and playing with friends – remastered for a new generation of players.”
Azra Games is a blockchain games company. Legions &amp; Legends launches this summer (an exact date wasn’t specified) with the release of the “Genesis Collection” NFTs which generate in-game resources through Ethereum. But what exactly is Legions &amp; Legends? A press release/blog post penned by Otero gives us a brief look into the Legions &amp; Legends’ “uncharted galaxy where magic and technology collide.” 
Civilizations unknown to humankind are at war, and players will be at the forefront of the bloody conflict to claim the galaxy. Three character types can be deployed on the battlefield – Legionnaires, best used in large numbers, Commanders, known for special attacks/buffs, and Behemoths, slow and tanky creatures with devastating power. The aforementioned NFT collection introduces Genesis Explorers, which players can send on Exploration Missions for craftable parts. 
As Otero put it, “Your journey deep into the Corvus Galaxy awaits.”</span>

                              <span>Size doesn&#x27;t matter, right?
The Direct rumours (sort of) came true, and we finally got a Nintendo Direct at the end of June — but wait, what&#x27;s this? It&#x27;s a &quot;Mini&quot; Direct? What does that mean?
Honestly, we&#x27;re not fully sure what it means, but presumably Nintendo was trying to temper our expectations after a bombastic but Nintendo-light E3 Not-E3. Still, it was a jam-packed Direct, with a ton of JRPG news, a sprinkling of indies, and some much-awaited port announcements — but the question is, did you enjoy it? Was there something for everyone? The Nintendo Life team sat down to discuss...

There&#x27;s a pretty long list of players who have beaten or tackled The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild in weird and wonderful ways. Speedrunner Limcube is one of those people, and earlier this week, the streamer completed a pretty huge feat that could be a huge boon to speedrunners.
Limcube has managed to beat all 120 shrines in one sitting without using the Sheikah Slate&#x27;s runes, and not only that, he did it all in one 28-hour stream (thanks, Eurogamer!). Beating every single shrine in one sitting would be incredible enough, but not using the runes — which many shrines specifically encourage that you use — makes the task ten times harder. Consider us majorly impressed.

The XIII remake has had a bit of a rough go of it, hasn&#x27;t it? After launching on the PS4 back in 2020 to less than stellar reviews, with many even heading out to buy the original 2003 game instead, the Switch port received multiple delays. Today, however, Microids has announced that Switch owners will get their hands on this remake on 13th September — isn&#x27;t that apt?
But to coincide with the Switch release, Microids has revealed that the studio has handed the reins over to Tower Five, creators of Lornsword Winter Chronicle. This developer has worked on the Switch port on top of adding online multiplayer, refining the art style to look closer to the original, and tweaking the AI among other things. Switch owners will be getting the best version of this remake on day one. But Steam, PlayStation, and Xbox players won&#x27;t miss out either, as the game will receive all improvements in a free day one patch.

Undertale creator Toby Fox has made no secret of the fact that he was heavily inspired by EarthBound when crafting his legendary post-modern take on the humble RPG, and he&#x27;s one of many people who has spoken to Lost in Cult for the next issue of its boutique video game publication, Lock-On.
Lock-On is gearing up for its fourth issue, which you can pre-order now. In this new issue, there will be a piece focused on the incredible impact of EarthBound and the Mother series in general, with contributions from Fox, musician Austin Jorgensen (Lisa: The Painful), Kody NOKOLO (founder of the fan site Mother Forever), Ryan Vandendyck (Citizens of Earth), and Daniel Airey (Reverie). In fact, issue 4 is shaping up to be the biggest issue yet, with almost 50 articles by 45 authors and art from more than 30 artists and developers.

As revealed in Nintendo&#x27;s June 2022 Direct Mini: Partner Showcase, Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope is launching on Switch on 20th October. This afternoon, Ubisoft&#x27;s dedicated showcase, a separate 15-minute stream from Nintendo&#x27;s Direct Mini, has revealed various elements of the upcoming game, including new gameplay details (no grids!), characters (Bowser, Rabbit Rosalina, and the ever-mysterious green and purple Rabbid, Edge), and more information on the evil force trying to absorb the galaxy&#x27;s energy, including that of the titular Sparks.

Watch: Mario + Rabbids Sparks Of Hope Showcase - Live!

Tough as it might be to believe, it&#x27;s been nearly five years since Ubisoft and Nintendo released a crossover that seemed unlikely and — dare we say it — unnatural at the time. Multiverse crossovers are ten-a-penny these days, but rumours that Mario&#x27;s Mushroom Kingdom crew would be collaborating with Ubisoft&#x27;s love-&#x27;em-or-hate-&#x27;em Rabbids (anarchic bunnies which spawned from the Rayman series into a pre-Minions world) seemed crazy enough, but coming together in an XCOM-style turn-based strategy game that outfitted the cast with blasters? Surely not.

One of the biggest surprises to come out of yesterday&#x27;s Nintendo Direct Mini: Partner Showcase (which was much bigger than Mini in our eyes!) was Pac-Man World Re-PAC, a remake of the Pac-Man platformer Pac-Man World on PlayStation.
This spin-off launched a whole new sub-franchise for the yellow puck on his 20th anniversary back in 1999, and fans have been desperate to see the game make a return. And now it will be this August!

First 4 Figures has made a pretty impressive name for itself thanks to its wide range of highly detailed and super-collectable statues and figurines, and the latest Zelda-related product has just dropped in the Nintendo Life office.
We&#x27;ve already sampled the delights of Link and Revali, and now it&#x27;s the turn of one of the most iconic items in the entire Zelda universe: the signature Hylian shield which Link takes with him into battle. Outside of the Master Sword, this has to rank as one of the most essential objects in any Zelda outing; emblazoned with the Tri-Force and the Hylian crest, it has arguably become the trademark for the entire series.

One of the big headliners during the Nintendo Direct Mini: Partner Showcase yesterday was Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope, the sequel to Ubisoft&#x27;s XCOM-esque Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle. The original was a surprising mash-up of genres and characters that maybe shouldn&#x27;t have worked, but darn, they worked really well together.
So we&#x27;re delighted we&#x27;re getting a sequel this year! And yesterday, we found out that the space-based game will be launching on the Switch on the 20th October along with some new details on the upcoming strategy sequel. But we&#x27;re about to get more info today. As revealed yesterday, Ubisoft is having a special Showcase which promises to give us a better look at the unique tactical combat, as well as &quot;a few surprises&quot;, so if you&#x27;re a fan of the original, you won&#x27;t want to miss this.

                              <span>Phew, Digital Eclipse is handling this one.
Atari has unveiled a new collection coming to Switch and other consoles in celebration of the company&#x27;s 50th anniversary. The appropriately-titled Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration will include over 90 games spanning the Atari 2600, 5200, 7800, ST, Jaguar and Lynx, and it&#x27;s coming later this year.
As reported by Game Informer in an exclusive first-look feature, the collection covers those six platforms and also represents the first time Jaguar and Lynx games will be officially available to play on modern consoles. There&#x27;s no word on exactly which games will be included just yet, but we&#x27;ll update this post when we hear more. It will apparently feature &quot;six new titles inspired by the classics&quot;, though — see the blurb below for more details.

Pokéfans, get ready - it looks like Pokémon Happy Meals will be making their way back to McDonald&#x27;s in the UK.
Our anonymous McDonald&#x27;s reporter has shared a new image of the Pokémon Happy Meal promotion, which you can check out below. It&#x27;s said that the promotion will begin on August 3rd, 2022. Although there&#x27;s no word currently on what exactly will be included at this time, it&#x27;s probably safe to assume that Pokémon Trading Cards will no doubt be part of the promotion.

Publisher V Publishing and developer Matrisoka Games are bringing frenetic pixel art combat and boss rushing to the Switch as the action RPG Fallen Angel will be descending onto consoles on 19th July.
Fallen Angel looks like a biblical version of Hyper Light Drifter with fluid animations and frantic combat, but instead, you&#x27;ll be fighting archangels as the fallen angel Lucifer to try and claim heaven for yourself.

Portal: Companion Collection has only just come out, but it seems a lot of interesting discoveries are already being made. Just earlier today, we reported on the existence of Half-Life 2 data within the game that&#x27;s actually allowed some users to run the Valve classic on Switch hardware.
Now, it looks like never-before-seen Portal 2 beta content has been discovered for the first time within the Companion Collection&#x27;s data. As reported by GamesRadar, YouTube user Ossy Flawol has uncovered a lot of interesting data, including cut levels, dev tools, and even an early version of the game&#x27;s ending. A huge co-op level has also been discovered that features puzzles and mechanics that would eventually make their way into Portal 2&#x27;s multiplayer component.

Less than a day after the shock announcement that magic-based battle royale Spellbreak will be shutting down early next year, it&#x27;s been announced that Blizzard Entertainment has snapped up the game&#x27;s developer, Proletariat.
VentureBeat reports that the 100-strong team at Proletariat will be joining Blizzard and helping with the development of its titanic MMORPG World of Warcraft. Blizzard is looking to beef up its staffing numbers for the game as the developer approaches the MMO&#x27;s next expansion coming later this year, Dragonflight.

                              <span>According to the website.
Yesterday, Nintendo gave us some treasure that was more than worthy of a hunt — but they just handed it to us on a gold platter. We found out that Return to Monkey Island, the newest game in the famous LucasArts Monkey Island series, would definitely be coming to Switch. And not only that, it&#x27;ll be coming to the hybrid console before anything else (other than PC, of course!).
However, after digging around a bit on the brand spanking new website for the game, Eurogamer reports that this may well be the last game in the series.

During the Nintendo Direct Mini: Partner Showcase, Valve announced that Portal: Companion Collection would release the very same day, giving Switch owners access to both Portal and Portal 2. Not even a full 24 hours after its release, however, it seems modders have discovered significant date related to Half-Life 2 within the game and have now managed to get it running on the Switch... To a certain extent.
As reported by VGC, Twitter user @OatmealDome has posted a video of Half-Life 2 running on Switch hardware. While it&#x27;s stated that the game currently crashes along with multiple other reported errors, we have to say that the footage itself looks exceptionally clean.

The upcoming Legend of Mana anime — Legend of Mana: The Teardrop Crystal — has received a brand new trailer earlier today (Thanks Comicbook and GoNintendo!). Produced by Graphinica (Chain Chronicle ~Light of Haecceitas~, Muv-Luv Alternative) and Yokohama Animation Lab (Monster Strike), the show looks pretty darn lovely so far.
Based on the fourth game in the Mana series, with character designs from series artist HACCAN and music by legendary composer Yoko Shimomura, we got a first look at the show a few months ago:

After what felt like years of having to make do with just a single image to promote the launch of Sonic Origins, the game is finally in the hands of Switch owners. Pooling together the classic 2D Sonic titles, including Sonic the Hedgehog, Sonic the Hedgehog 2, Sonic CD, and Sonic the Hedgehog 3 &amp; Knuckles, the game is a commendable compilation that newcomers in particular would do well to check out. But could it have been more?
In its latest technical analysis video, Digital Foundry puts Sonic Origins under the microscope, and while it concludes that the game is &quot;good&quot;, there are a few glaring issues that prevent it from being a true must-buy experience.

Disney&#x27;s Mickey Mouse has been no stranger to video games over the years, from classic The Magical Quest and Illusion series to kart racers, and even Kingdom Hearts. His best friend, Donald Duck, has also been in the limelight plenty of times too — including a bigger role in Square Enix&#x27;s action RPG series.
Perhaps one of the more notable and recent Mickey Mouse games is Epic Mickey, designed by Deus Ex creator Warren Spector. This Junction Point-Developed game got two sequels — Epic Mickey 2: The Power of Two and the 3DS spin-off Epic Mickey: Power of Illusion. There was, however, one more game in development in the series that was sadly cancelled, and it would&#x27;ve starred everyone&#x27;s favourite cantankerous duck — Epic Donald.

Yesterday&#x27;s Nintendo Direct Mini in Japan included some extra Switch announcements, and in case you missed it, one of them was Ultra Kaiju Monster Rancher. It&#x27;s published by Bandai Namco and developed by Koei Tecmo and will launch at some point this year in Japan and Asia. There&#x27;s no word on a western release (yet), but it does include English subtitles.
As you may have already worked out from the title, this is a collaboration between the Ultraman franchise and also the monster-raising simulation series, Monster Rancher - which is currently celebrating 25 years. This new game is described as a Kaiju raising simulation - adopting the base systems of Monster Rancher and Monster Rancher 2 - allowing you to raise all sorts of Ultra Kaiju.

                              <span>Aside from the many indies and Sonic Frontiers and this breakfast sandwich I got from Birdies, I must say that Street Fighter 6 was a major highlight of my time in LA for Summer Geoff Fest. Honestly, I went into my hands-on slot expecting to plaster a big &quot;meh&quot; on the game in my notepad. But the inclusion of a &quot;modern&quot; control scheme flipped this on its head. I&#x27;m telling you, it&#x27;s an absolute game changer.

Developers Rogue Factor didn&#x27;t provide many other details, besides a few buzz words: &quot;semi-open world&quot;, &quot;true adventure&quot;, &quot;third person&quot;.
So, I sat down with the game&#x27;s creative director Jonathan Jacques-Belletête in the hopes he could shed some light on the aforementioned vibes, perhaps even turning them from ethereal gusts of Annihilation-ness to concrete info on just how the game aims to be a &quot;true adventure&quot;. Lo and behold, I think it worked!

                              <span>I loved Monster Hunter: Rise when I first played it on Switch last year, but I’ll admit that I sort of sleep-walked through its entirety, dreamily kicking the tails off a couple of raptors before making them into a fashionable pair of hot pants. This wasn’t a bad thing, mind. Far from it. I found Rise to be a substantially better-paced MonHunt entry compared to its predecessors, the series’ steep barrier to entry readjusted to a gentle incline that was more palatable for newcomers like me. Monster Hunter’s particular flavour of RPG design has always felt like trying to find a fork in a friend’s kitchen while they’re in another room. Nothing is where you expect it to be and there are a lot of things here you just don’t understand. Admittedly Rise wasn’t much better, stuffed as it was with endless text-based tutorials, but at the very least it pointed out the right drawer this time around.

You may remember him from such roles as future emperor of the universe Paul Atriedes in David Lynch’s Dune, cafficionado Special Agent Dale Cooper in David Lynch’s Twin Peaks, and for his turn in David Lynch&#x27;s Oscar-nominated Blue Velvet. Please tell me David Lynch will at least direct the pilot.

                              <span>Pop-punk is not my musical (brand new) bag but I can&#x27;t resist a coming-of-age story about a teenager who finds their place in the world by picking up a guitar. Give me Pugwall, give me Ladies And Gentlemen, The Fabulous Stains, give me Loud. Announced yesterday, the rhythm game will tell the tale of teen girl who goes from playing air guitar on a broom to wailing on the world stage. Loud looks cute, somewhere between Life Is Strange and Guitar Hero, and you can see a bit in the trailer below.

                              <span>The Mighty Thor, Jane Foster’s godly alter ego, swoops into Marvel’s Avengers today. Crystal Dynamics released a pair of videos showcasing her thunder-based abilities, giving fans a look at how she compares to her original male counterpart.
Jane arrives as a free character in all versions of Marvel’s Avengers. The narrative explains that Jane was torn from an alternate reality in which she is the one and only Thor. Odinson renounced Mjolnir following A-Day, and though Jane developed cancer, her transformation into the Goddess of Thunder halted the disease as she battled to protect Inhumans from persecution. One day, a Tachyon Strom caused by AIM opened a portal that dropped Jane into the game’s universe. She joins up with the Avengers to uncover the cause of the rifts and figure out how to return home. 
The Mighty Thor wields Mjolnir with more precision than Odinson and sports new abilities that highlight her increased finesse. You can watch the War Table video below for a complete breakdown of her skills or watch the video below for a non-commentary gameplay demonstration.




Jane’s addition brings the game’s total roster of heroes to 10 on most platforms and 11 on PlayStation, thanks to Spider-Man’s exclusivity. You can catch up on the roster by checking out our list of every playable hero in Marvel&#x27;s Avengers.</span>

                              <span>Harvestella is Square Enix’s new RPG meets farming sim announced during today’s Nintendo Direct Mini. 
The game takes place in a world where the four seasons are dictated by four giant crystals called Seaslight. But the cycle is interrupted due to an abnormal event that creates a “season of death” called the Quietus, which causes crops to wither and threatens all life.
Harvestella’s gameplay splits time between action-focused dungeon crawling and laid-back farm management. Players globetrot to areas representing the four seasons to battle monsters and explore dungeons. You can even hop in a submarine to traverse the oceans. Combat involves executing team maneuvers with party members, and each character can be outfitted with different jobs that grant unique characteristics, skills, and combat styles. 


When you’re not fighting for the world’s survival, you’ll return to your village to tend to your farm. Raising crops and livestock lets you harvest ingredients for crafting. When the work is done, socializing with townsfolk is another key diversion. Along the way, you’ll meet a cast of characters such as a time traveler from the future, and completing tasks for them grants rewards and improves your bonds with them. 
Harvestella looks intriguing and we can’t wait to see more of it. It’s also not terribly far away, launching November 4 for Switch and PC via Steam.</span>

                              <span>With Gotham Knights exploring what life is like in a post-Bruce Wayne world, his iconic sidekick is wondering what a Robin is without a Batman. Apparently, he&#x27;s unleashing his full potential and hacking advanced superhero bases to level up his vigilanteism.


In a new character trailer, Robin shows off how he disposes of Gotham&#x27;s thugs. His standard melee combat is centered around quick attacks and the use of his quarterstaff for leverage and mid-range beatdowns. Robin also has a stealthy element, enabling active camouflage to mask his presence and sneak up on unsuspecting suspects. The most surprising reveal in the trailer is that the Boy Wonder has tapped into the Justice League satellite to enable short-range teleportation to zip around Gotham to get the drop on enemies or make impossible leaps a reality. He&#x27;s also using holograms to deploy decoys to deceive dummies in combat.
Gotham Knights is looking great after the last couple of trailers, and I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing this team take on the Court of Owls when it releases on October 25.</span>

                              <span>Over the last 31 years, the Sonic the Hedgehog fan base has dashed through several distinct eras. The Classic Era let fans platform through brilliantly designed 2D stages, while the Modern Era gave us the Adventure games and Boost games, and that&#x27;s not even counting the Sonic Boom titles. Now, with the movies setting box office records and reinserting everyone&#x27;s favorite blue hedgehog back into the mainstream consciousness, a new era for Sonic the Hedgehog games could very well be upon us. With Sonic Frontiers, Sega and Sonic Team could hope to welcome fans to the Open-Zone Era of the franchise.
For this issue&#x27;s cover story, I traveled to Burbank, California to Sonic Team&#x27;s U.S. headquarters to play hours of Sonic Frontiers. I spent that time exploring Kronos Island, fighting enemies, solv…</span>

                              <span>Sonic Frontiers’ “open zone” format has been the centerpiece of discussion, and for a good reason. Dropping Sonic in an open-world style environment gives fans a new, bigger arena to roam around and go fast in. However, traditionalists may be happy to learn that Frontiers includes standard, linear platforming stages hidden in unlockable areas called Cyber Space. I got to play one of these stages during my demo during Summer Game Fest Play Days a couple of weeks ago to get a handle on how these self-contained levels compliment Frontiers&#x27; exploration-heavy gameplay. 
As seen during today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct Mini, while exploring the open world (which you can read about in my previous preview), I collected special items called Portal Gears. You can obtain these gears by solving puzzles and comp…</span>

Hot on the heels of the announcement of Persona 3 Portable, Persona 4 Golden, and Persona 5 Royal coming to PlayStation, Xbox, and PC, Atlus announced during today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct Mini presentation that the three upgraded versions of its beloved Persona games will also arrive on Nintendo Switch.


Persona 5 Royal, the 2020 upgraded version of the 2017 base game, comes to PlayStation 5, Xbox, Switch, and PC on October 21. Persona 3 Portable and Persona 4 Golden are also coming to PlayStation, Xbox, and PC, though they&#x27;ll do so later. 
Only Persona 5 Strikers, the spin-off/follow-up to Persona 5, and Persona 4 Arena Ultimax, a fighting-game follow-up to Persona 4, have appeared on Switch platforms. For our review of Persona 5 Royal, head here. To learn more about Persona 5 Strikers, head here.</span>

While we already knew it was coming sometime this year, today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct Mini presentation news revealed that we&#x27;ll be able to play two of the greatest puzzle games of all time on Switch beginning today.
Portal was released in 2007 as a part of The Orange Box, a bundle that gathered Half-Life 2, Half-Life 2: Episode One, Half-Life 2: Episode Two, Team Fortress 2, and Portal. Initially considered a unique side dish to the main courses that populated the rest of the bundle, Portal quickly gained popularity for its clever design, mind-bending puzzles, and dark humor. In 2011, Valve released a full-fledged sequel, Portal 2. This standalone title added several new mechanics, extended playtime, a more involved story exploring the backstories of Aperture Science and GlaDOS, and a separate co-op multiplayer campaign.
Both Portal titles are considered among the greatest video games ever made and are available today on Nintendo Switch.</span>

                              <span>Square Enix has pulled back the curtains on Dragon Quest Treasures, a new spin-off entry in the legendary Dragon Quest franchise that was first teased in May 2021. This game focuses on the childhoods of Mia and Erik, two siblings from Dragon Quest XI: Echoes of an Elusive Age. As these two characters, players embark on hunts for treasure in Draconia before the events of Dragon Quest XI.


As Mia and Erik travel through Draconia, they can recruit monsters to locate loot, explore the world, and fight enemies. Your recruited monsters are more helpful than just battling, it turns out: Using Slimes, you can bounce up to higher ledges, while grabbing onto a Dracky while you&#x27;re exploring can allow you to glide like Breath of the Wild&#x27;s paraglider. Once you complete your treasure hunt and obtain your prize, you can bring it back to your base to see how much it&#x27;s worth. Using the funds you obtain from your hunts, you can improve your base and increase your treasure hunting level. 
Dragon Quest Treasures launches on December 9 for Switch.</span>

                              <span>Live A Live is just over three weeks from release, but Nintendo and Square Enix are ready to rev the hype engine. During today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct Mini, we received an update on the exciting, beautiful HD2D title that remakes the 1994 Super Famicom RPG that never came to Western markets. However, the big news from the presentation is that if you want to see what the buzz is all about, you can get a taste starting today.
The game puts you in the roles of multiple stories and multiple protagonists across different eras. The demo that hits the eShop today allows you to play three chapters from three different eras to get an idea of what to expect. Not only that but the save data transfers to the full game if you decide to buy it; it&#x27;s always nice to know your time in a demo is productive when it comes to the final release.
Live A Live comes to Switch on July 22.</span>

                              <span>When Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle arrived on Switch in 2017, it was an unlikely success that blended the worlds of Nintendo&#x27;s Super Mario franchise with Ubisoft&#x27;s zany Rabbids. The result was a turn-based tactical title starring the Mushroom Kingdom&#x27;s finest and the most unpredictable characters in Ubisoft&#x27;s stable. Announced during Nintendo&#x27;s E3 2021 Direct, Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope promises to carry forward the legacy of that fan-favorite title, but it&#x27;s been a while since we&#x27;ve heard anything about that game. That changed today during the Nintendo Direct Mini, which shined the spotlight on the company&#x27;s third-party partners.

                              <span>Bandai Namco has announced a new remake of Pac-Man World called Pac-Man World: Re-Pac. This throwback to the 1999 PlayStation 1 title features revamped graphics and more, and is scheduled to release this August.


Pac-Man World puts you in the shoes of Pac-Man as he platforms through six worlds on Ghost Island to rescue his friends. Each world consists of five levels, with each world&#x27;s final level featuring a boss battle. In the game, Pac-Man can use a variety of skills, including the ability to Rev Roll, Butt Bounce, and turn into Giant Pac-Man. When the original title was first released on PS1, Game Informer liked the title, scoring it an 8 out of 10 in 1999.
This is the second remake the original 1999 title has received, the first of which was in 2004 for the Game Boy Advance. The game also appeared on PlayStation Network beginning in 2013 under the PSOne Classics branding. However, the original PS1 version is not among the classic titles currently included in the PlayStation Plus Premium tier&#x27;s classic catalog.
Pac-Man World: Re-Pac launches on August 26 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.</span>

                              <span>When the first Mega Man Legacy Collection launched in 2015, players hoped there was more to follow. Sure enough, there was, as Mega Man Legacy Collection 2, Mega Man X Legacy Collection, Mega Man X Legacy Collection 2, and Mega Man Zero/ZX Legacy Collection followed in subsequent years. However, one pain point among the fan base is the lack of a modern way to enjoy the myriad Mega Man Battle Network titles.


Today, Capcom finally gave that segment of the fan base what it&#x27;s been clamoring for with the Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection. Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection gathers 10 games from the series, along with over 1,000 illustrations and a music mode featuring more than 150 songs. The collection includes:
Mega Man Battle Network
Mega Man Battle Network 2
Mega Man Battle Network 3 White
Mega Man Battle Network 3 Blue
Mega Man Battle Network 4 Red Sun
Mega Man Battle Network 4 Blue Moon
Mega Man Battle Network 5 Team Protoman
Mega Man Battle Network 5 Team Colonel
Mega Man Battle Network 6 Cybeast Gregar
Mega Man Battle Network 6 Cybeast Falzar
Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection is slated for PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC and launches in 2023.</span>

                              <span>Konami announced Super Bomberman R 2, a successor to the Switch launch title Super Bomberman R. In addition to announcing the game, we also got our first look at a promising new way to play called Castle Mode and a release window.


In the asymmetric multiplayer Castle Mode, a team of 15 players must blast their way to treasure chests scattered across the battlefield. Meanwhile, a solo player tries their best to hold them off. On top of what sounds like a wild mess of action, players can create and share their own battle stages for the mode, adding a ton to the replayability potential of this new form of play.
When the first Super Bomberman R launched in 2017, I heavily criticized it for poor network performance, frustrating level design, and an overall lack of content. However, in the years since, the developers have improved the title through various updates and expanded the Switch-exclusive game to also appear on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC. Hopefully, the development team learned from its mistakes with Super Bomberman R 2 and delivers a stronger product at launch. The aforementioned Castle Mode looks like a good time, so I&#x27;m hopeful. Super Bomberman R 2 arrives in 2023. It will be available on PlayStation and Xbox consoles as well as Switch and PC.</span>

                              <span>One of the most requested titles is finally coming to Switch later this year. Nier: Automata quickly found a large fan base when it launched in 2017, with many praising the storytelling, action, and soundtrack of the Platinum Games-developed title. Now, more than five years later, the heartfelt story of 2B and 9S comes to Nintendo Switch.
Nier: Automata The End of Yorha Edition includes previously released content and new costumes that will be available at launch. We don&#x27;t know much else about what appears to be an &quot;ultimate&quot; or &quot;game of the year&quot; edition of the title, but the game&#x27;s inclusion in the Switch library is noteworthy. When Nier: Automata launched in 2017, it received critical and fan acclaim, with the PlayStation 4 version garnering an 88 out of 100 score on reviews aggregate website Metacritic.
Nier: Automata The End of Yorha Edition arrives on Nintendo Switch on October 6. For one Game Informer&#x27;s opinion on why you need to play Nier: Automata in some form, head here.</span>

                              <span>Nintendo kicked off its Direct Mini presentation today with a new trailer for Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak. The expansion, available this week, delivers a hearty amount of content by adding new biomes to explore and creatures to track down/battle. However, Capcom isn&#x27;t stopping there, as the new trailer gave way to a roadmap of free title updates for players over the next several months.


The first title update hits in August, adding Seething Bazelgeuse, Lucent Nargacuga, and several other monsters. That update also adds rare species monsters, special species monsters, and a new locale in the Forlorn Arena. Later this fall, a second free title update adds more rare species monsters, subspecies monsters, and powered-up monsters. A third free title update is scheduled for this winter, promising several special species monsters and powered-up monsters. Finally, Capcom says a fourth free title update will arrive in 2023, but it isn&#x27;t ready to say anything about what to expect with that one.
Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak is available June 30 on Switch and PC. For more on the base game, check out our review from 2021 when it first hit Switch. For more on the Sunbreak expansion, get caught up on every monster confirmed right here.</span>

                              <span>Last year, the team behind Fallout: London, a “DLC-sized mod” for Bethesda’s Fallout 4, released a reveal trailer that showcased what to expect across the pond in the world of Fallout, and it looked great. Today, the team released another video spanning almost five minutes that highlights some of the well-worn and lesser-known locales of London that players can visit when the mod is released. 
And speaking of release, today’s trailer revealed that Fallout: London will be released in 2023, as reported by IGN. The release window comes after a stunning four minutes of in-game footage. Had I not known Fallout: London was a mod, I probably would have assumed it was a brand-new chapter in the franchise – that’s how good this looks! Check it out for yourself below: 


As you can see in the trailer, players can expect to see Tower Bridge, Big Ben, and more. Plus, the trailer hints that players won’t win every battle with bullets – they might be going medieval in some quests, donning a knight’s armor and taking down enemies with a sword. Everything about this trailer is exciting. Fortunately, Fallout: London is releasing sometime next year. 
Here’s some more information about the mod straight from the team:

Now there&#x27;s a soiree full of suspects and locations to investigate to find out who did the dirty deed in Murder at Castle Nathria.


Murder at Castle Nathria has three key aspects to the set, including a couple of new mechanics to the digital card game. First are ten Legendary Suspects, new legendary minions with one representing each Hearthstone class. These legends include fishy detective Murloc Holmes which allows you to copy cards from your opponent&#x27;s deck by guessing three questions about cards in their hand or deck correctly and Decima…</span>

                              <span>Adata&#x27;s Premium SSD for PS5 might be the most misleadingly titled storage device on the market. Okay, it is a high-spec SSD suitable for the PS5, but it&#x27;s also a really good value PCIe 4.0 SSD for PCs too. Today, it&#x27;s down to $185 at Adata&#x27;s official Ebay store when you use the code FREEDOM15 - an unbelievable price for the level of performance on offer. 
That&#x27;s some $145 below MSRP and way cheaper than similarly-specced 2TB PCIe 4.0 SSDs like the Samsung 980 Pro ($260) or Crucial P5 Plus ($244).

                              <span>I think of Disney as a company that will protect their image by working on something until it&#x27;s both good and finished, which is frankly stupid of me given I just finished watching Obi-Wan Kenobi. Still, I found myself surprised when I learned that Disney Dreamlight Valley will be an early access game when it launches on September 6th.

Its name also does most of my job for me: this is a game about constructing islands, right? And then you build trains on them, yeah? It&#x27;s &quot;coming soon&quot; and it looks delightful in GIFs the developer has been posting on Twitter.

                              <span>Terrible Toybox have shared more of point’n’click adventure threequel reboot Return To Monkey Island today. It’s the first time we’ve got a good look at the third Monkey Island captained by Ron Gilbert in motion, but it had the weird honour of appearing during a Nintendo Direct. Have a watch of the trailer below.

And that was the extent of our knowledge at the time. Well, thanks to Nintendo&#x27;s latest Direct Mini, we got the briefest slice of new gameplay which expands our knowledge just a smidge further. Seems fun? I think?

You’ll need to wait for 7pm BST/11am PST to arrive before you can jump into the beta though. It’s also the first proper opportunity to play as the new tank Junker Queen, revealed at the Xbox &amp; Bethesda Games Showcase earlier this month.

                              <span>I thought Sonic Frontiers was less Breath Of The Wild and more Super Mario Odyssey after I&#x27;d given it whirl in LA at Summer Geoff Fest. Despite its rough edges, Frontier&#x27;s open-ish world was a joy to blitz around as a hedgehog renowned for going particularly fast. But there was one thing I couldn&#x27;t talk about – Cyberspace stages: Bite-sized levels à la classic Sonic. And here&#x27;s why it might&#x27;ve been one of the best bits of the demo.

I demand they dig a new hole for the monthly RPS Time Capsule of games we&#x27;d like to save from a certain year, and usually it isn&#x27;t a problem. This time, however, the staff complained a lot about the year choice: it&#x27;s 2005, baby, and they struggled. I&#x27;m okay with it though, because we ended up with a lot of cool abandonware and interesting choices I couldn&#x27;t have predicted. Especially because, since I got to the Time Capsule first, I got to stuff in the most obvious choice.

                              <span>Also in Steam Deck news, Valve’s Lawrence Yang – a designer who worked on the on the handheld PC – has weighed in on a widely shared mod that replaces the pre-installed SSD with a larger, faster model. His advice: don’t do it.


The mod, by Twitter user Belly Jelly, swaps out the dinky default M.2 2230 SSD for a slightly longer M.2 2242 drive. It seems to mostly work fine except for making “the heat spreader bow a bit.” It was subsequently shared by PC Gamer, GameSpot and others before Yang tweeted a warning that such a change would “significantly shorten the life of your Deck” by moving thermal pads vital to cooling the charger IC (integrated circuit).

                              <span>Keep those genre mashups coming, game devs
There are a lot of video games out there in the world. Shooters, platformers, narrative adventures, fighting games — iconic genres that have almost forty years of precedence to make them what they are today. Various developers and studios have given us some truly amazing entries in all of these genres and many more, but sometimes, I find myself wondering if there&#x27;s anything new out there that will shake up the industry. Of course, this is always a silly thought, because people are endlessly creative, especially when it comes to game design. The industry has plenty of answers for keeping things moving forward, but my absolute favorite trend in games right now is genre mashup.
That&#x27;s right, it&#x27;s as simple as taking two game genres and combining them…</span>

Ever since Capcom released Street Fighter II 30 years ago, the fighting game genre has attempted to strive for perfection. Oh sure, the methods, modes, mechanics, and artistic styles for every ring-rocker are very different, but every one of these games is pushing toward the same goal: the capture of a community; a passionate player base that will keep said fighter alive, kicking, and perpetually on its feet, lest it falls to a 10-count like so many contenders that have come before.
Today, it is incredibly rare that a developer makes a &quot;bad fighter.&quot; Whether billion-dollar franchises such as Tekken, Mortal Kombat, and Street Fighter itself, to mid-size slugfests such as The King of Fighters, Guilty Gear, and Skullgirls, to cultish outliers such as Melty Blood, Samurai Shodown…</span>

                              <span>Avast ye, the first trailer for Return to Monkey Island is finally here!
The Monkey Island games are heralded as some of the best point-and-click games ever made, so fans are pretty thrilled to be getting another mainline game twelve years after the series&#x27; last release, which was a special edition of the first two games. Another sequel is long overdue, and thankfully the developers behind the project, Terrible Toybox, just released a new trailer to satiate us as we wait for the game to drop later this year. The trailer was also posted by Monkey Island&#x27;s beloved designer and creator Ron Gilbert, who shared the news with the exact type of humor we&#x27;d expect from him.
The new trailer shows off Return to Monkey Island&#x27;s revamped art style, which captures the quirkiness of the characters and world perfectly. Although we didn&#x27;t get to see all that much of it, the gameplay itself looks like the classic Monkey Island experience we know and love. Story-wise, our plucky protagonist Guybrush Threepwood promises we&#x27;re in for an adventure with &quot;ships, fights, love, treasure, betrayal, and root beer.&quot; As an avid lover of all things pirate-related myself, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s much more I could really ask for.

I can be pretty hesitant about sequels this far out from the originals, especially when a series&#x27; legacy is on the line, but I have to say that I&#x27;ve been blown away by everything I&#x27;ve seen of Return to Monkey Island so far. It also says a lot that they have some of the original creators involved. At this point, I&#x27;m optimistic that the game will bring a thrilling adventure from a classic series to a brand new audience.
Return to Monkey Island takes to the high seas sometime in 2022 for PC and Nintendo Switch.

                              <span>It doesn&#x27;t even have the French Goth one
When esoteric publisher Microids announced that we were getting five Smurfs games in as many years, we all laughed, then we cried a little, then laughed more to alleviate the pain. But it seems that we all had a lot of growing up to do, as Microids has channeled that bemusement into sadistic determination.
Following up the fall 2021 release of platform adventure The Smurfs: Mission Vileaf, the French publisher has now moved on to that second video game genre detailed in the Big Book of IP Licensing: Kart Racing. Smurfs Kart will see the little blue buggers taking to the rural raceway in a selection of rickety-looking wooden karts, loaded for bear with special items and unique abilities.
Players can choose from The Main One, The One With The Chef&#x27;s Hat, The Old One, Smurfette, or The Others. (Kinda &#x27;sus that I only know Smurfette by name, frankly), before hitting a series of woodland tracks in what is sure to be the bog-standard Mario Kart template that has been previously adopted by The Simpsons, Wacky Races, Garfield, Family Guy, Shrek, Angry Birds, LEGO, Nicktoons, Hello Kitty, Woody Woodpecker, Danger Mouse, and fucking M&amp;Ms.
Honestly, once Sonic and Sega All-Star Racing Transformed was released, we already had a grandstand champion. Still, now we&#x27;ve done platformer and kart racing, we have no choice but to go to the obligatory next stage: Smurfs Wrestling.
Smurfs Kart is currently in development for Nintendo Switch. It is expected to launch this winter.

Sonic Frontiers is an open-world game, but it also has more traditional 3D Sonic levels, and thanks to a gradual info rollout, we&#x27;re only now getting to see them up close. While Sega only showed a few seconds of these Cyber Space levels at today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct Mini, for some fans, it&#x27;s a sign of life — a glimmer of hope for this rocky-looking game.

Today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct Mini video introduces the main setting of Sonic Frontiers, the Starfall Islands, and shows off the Cyber Space levels starting at the 0:45 mark.
By doing open-world stuff — solving puzzles, completing challenges, and the like — Sonic will earn Portal Gears that open up entrances to the Cyber Space levels. Sega is no stranger to leaning on …</span>

There&#x27;s another reason for shmup fans to get their trigger fingers in gear today, as the legendary arcade developer Taito and ShotTrigger makers M2 have announced a brand new compilation, Ray&#x27;z Arcade Chronology, which will compile the button-pounding titles of the cult shmup series, &quot;Ray.&quot;
Currently in development for PS4 and Nintendo Switch, Ray&#x27;z Arcade Chronology will contain four classic Ray releases. Featured in the compilation are the original RayForce (1994), sequels RayStorm (1996) and RayCrisis (1998), as well as a revamped version of 2013 remaster RayStorm HD, complete with brand new features. The chronology will be rounded out with a brand new remaster of RayCrisis — titled RayCrisis HD — so fans will be able to enjoy a brand new take on the franchise along with the aforementioned hits.

Unfortunately, that&#x27;s where the info ends, with nary a release date or trailer to be seen, (though Taito Japan has opened a brand new website for the collection).
M2 have been done fantastic work in ensuring that the history of the shmup genre has been collated, archived and/or rereleased for modern audiences, and this upcoming collection will only add to the burgeoning catalog of coin-op classics.
Taito is yet to announce a western localization for the compilation, but we&#x27;ll be sure to give you a heads-up when more information is forthcoming.
Ray&#x27;Z Arcade Chronology is in development for PS4 and Switch, with a launch window of 2023.

                              <span>Handheld PC power is headed your way soon
Following up on its recent promise to increase the production and distribution of its Steam Deck hardware, developer Valve has announced that it is on track to double the number of consoles currently headed to its eagerly-waiting army of pre-order customers.
Speaking on Twitter, Valve noted that customers in the &quot;Q2&quot; reservation bracket should have already received their confirmation email, with Q3 confirmation emails expected to arrive in the coming fortnight. Customers should think fast, however, as they only have three days to confirm and pay for their chosen model, which will lock in their order and see their lil&#x27; black box begin the journey to their front door. Those still waiting on their email can check the status of their order at the Steam Deck store.
Valve&#x27;s Steam Deck has proven to be yet another victim of electronic component shortages. Ever since the global COVID-19 pandemic severely impacted international production and shipment industries, manufacturers have struggled to meet their initial targets for hardware rollout. The delays that currently affect the Steam Deck platform have also affected the production and distribution of consoles such as Sony&#x27;s PS5, Xbox&#x27;s Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch, as well as graphics cards for PCs and tech markets outside of the gaming sphere.
The Steam Deck officially launched in March 2022, and currently supports well over 2000 titles.

                              <span>A new view of the post-apocalypse is on the way
Fallout London, a massive &quot;DLC-sized&quot; mod for Fallout 4, has a new trailer and a release window. The huge fan-made expansion is set to arrive next year, in 2023.
The trailer, which premiered over the weekend, showcases the sights and sounds of London in the post-nuclear apocalypse of Fallout. Though there&#x27;s ruins and destruction abound, you can still make out plenty of landmarks and vistas you&#x27;d expect to see.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;zzGG-eImQ_Q
Fallout London is billed as a continuation of base Fallout 4. The setting is a pretty drastic jump as Fallout has never really ventured outside the U.S. for its locales. The team says tackling the London setting allows them to explore cultures that have not homogenized with the American wasteland, as well as explore the effects of the Resource Wars on pre-war Britain.
A new wasteland
We&#x27;ve seen some gameplay of this massive mod before, but it looks like the dev team has at least a decent inkling of when Fallout London will see the light of day. And even though Fallout and other Bethesda RPGs have a history of massive mods, this one has some particularly intriguing elements.
The boat and canals look really interesting. The obvious London theming feels like a good, healthy departure and exciting environment to explore. And at one point, at the very end of the trailer, I swear I saw a battle elephant. An honest-to-goodness, Lord of the Rings-style war elephant. Seems like London gets wild in the nuclear future.
Since it seems like it will be a very, very long time before Bethesda ever circles back around to the Fallout franchise, Fallout London seems like a decent hope for those looking for a fresh take. The massive Fallout 4 mod is planned to arrive sometime in 2023.

Did you ever play Attack of the Friday Monsters! A Tokyo Tale? Released nearly a decade ago for Nintendo 3DS as part of Level-5&#x27;s Guild02 compilation, the game is a slice-of-life adventure about a young kid named Sohta who&#x27;s just moved to a small town where giant kaiju fight every Friday. Its developer, Millennium Kitchen, found inspiration for the title from its flagship franchise Boku no Natsuyasumi, a somewhat popular slice-of-life series that saw a string of releases in Japan throughout the aughts.
Despite it never getting an official localization, Boku no Natsuyasumi has developed a pretty niche following in North America. So much so that it was pretty big news among a small group of fans when Millennium Kitchen announced it was developing a spin-off featur…</span>

                              <span>Square Enix takes you to the Rune Factory
A new farming game is coming to town this fall. Square Enix&#x27;s Harvestella is the company&#x27;s take on the farming life sim RPG, arriving November 4 for PC (via Steam) and Nintendo Switch.
Shown today during the Nintendo Direct Mini: Partner Showcase, Harvestella is a new RPG from Square Enix that mixes farming, socializing, and RPG action into one big pot.
It immediately gives off some Rune Factory vibes, as it seems to have a similar mix of combat and farming. But it&#x27;s also got some interesting twists on the formula.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;5Yd3tzhN99E
While there are four seasons—spring, summer, fall, and winter—there&#x27;s also a season of death called Quietus. During this time, crops wither and lethal dust keeps the denizens of the world indoors.
Planning harvests will have to accommodate for this bizarre mystery, and it looks like a major drive will be figuring out why the Quietus is happening.
A bountiful harvest
Of course, there&#x27;s both crop harvesting and livestock raising. Harvestella has many of the familiar farming trappings. It also has combat and an overworld to explore, though, which is where the Rune Factory comparison starts to feel more apt.
The Square Enix blog dives into more detail, noting a job system that will let the player character specialize in certain combat forms. Be a Fighter and dive right into the fray. Or play a Mage, and launch magic from afar. The overworld has new characters to meet, dungeons to explore, and even a submarine.

More and more companies have been trying their hand at a farming life sim. (A Disney-themed one was even in this showcase, too.) What Square Enix has with Harvestella seems pretty darn interesting. A game with all the expected features like farming, fighting, and socializing plus some RPG goodness in the mysteries of the world? Sign me up.
Harvestella arrives for Nintendo Switch and PC on Nov. 4, 2022.

Well, there&#x27;s something for everyone today! Although it wasn&#x27;t a massive heavy-hitting first-party live-streamed Nintendo Direct with huge &quot;reaction-worthy&quot; reveals (it was a 26-minute Direct Mini that was dumped onto YouTube instantly), Nintendo did give us a good look at some upcoming games on Switch.

A stone-cold classic of dystopian gaming is headed to Switch this year — as revealed during this morning&#x27;s Nintendo Direct, Square Enix&#x27;s apocalyptic and dramatic action adventure NieR: Automata will bring its wistful storytelling and dark, indelible worlds to the Switch platform this fall.
NieR: Automata: The End of YorHa Edition will see the award-winning 2017 release faithfully recreated for the Switch platform, bundled alongside all previously released content including DLC expansions, additional modes, and a fully-stocked wardrobe of snazzy duds for automated heroes 2B, 9S, and, A2. In addition, the Switch port will feature its own range of console exclusive skins, so you can ensure 2B is rocking all of her fineries as she picks her way through our miserable, dilapidated planet.

Originally developed by PlatinumGames, Nier: Automata sees an Earth lying in devastation, with mankind locked in a brutal proxy war against a seemingly insurmountable army of alien-created machines. In response, humanity builds its own automated protection in the form of sentient androids, who do battle with the machines in a never-ending war of attrition for control of the planet. NieR: Automata tells the story of three such androids and their dramatic, emotive, and often heart-breaking existence as pawns in a galactic battle for world domination.
NieR: Automata: End of YorHa Edition launches October 6 on Nintendo Switch. Pre-orders for the physical release are now live at the official Square Enix store and include a pretty rad-looking shirt.

As part of this morning&#x27;s Nintendo Direct presentation, it was announced that the iconic, smash-hit puzzle platformers Portal and Portal 2 are hitting the Switch platform in the form of Portal: Companion Collection. Even better news, the irreverent, brain-teasing title will land on the eShop today!
https://youtu.be/wMQASUA_1Do
Portal Companion Collection compiles 2007 hit Portal along with its 2011 follow-up — the two classics are freshly repackaged for their release on Nintendo&#x27;s hybrid console. Return to the terrifying Aperture Science Enrichment Center and utilize the power of physics, gravity, and portals to guide our hero out of her cell, out of the system, and out of the hazardous clutches of the scarily sentient overseer, GLaDOS.
Combining dark humor, genuine pathos, and some fantastic lateral thinking shenanigans, the Portal games became instant classics upon release and have only welcomed more disciples into their twisted coven in the ensuing 15 years. Already available on practically every platform under the sun, this new compilation of two of gaming&#x27;s finest and most beloved puzzlers will allow Switch players to set their heads fizzing and spinning whilst in bed, on a commute, or simply out and about. Just watch your step.
Portal: Companion Collection launches on the Nintendo eShop today for $19.99.

                              <span>Two volumes in 2013
Announced today via the Nintendo Direct Mini showcase, a Mega Man Battle Network Switch collection is on the way, and it&#x27;ll feature 10 games.
Originally released in 2001, Capcom&#x27;s tactical RPG spinoff hit the ground running, and eventually saw a number of sequels, including a few &quot;different version&quot; launches similar to how Pokemon handles things. A &quot;complete&quot; edition with everything sort of solves that problem in the modern era.
Nintendo says that there will actually be two volumes (Volume 1, and Volume 2, which are &quot;each sold separately&quot;) to contain all those games, and that the release is coming in 2023. The Mega Man Battle Network collection on Switch will also sport a gallery &quot;with over 1000 illustrations,&quot; and &quot;over 150 songs from across the series.&quot; Capcom has confirmed that the re-releases &quot;feature optional high-resolution filters that allow players to enjoy smoother, less pixelated visuals,&quot; and &quot;players can turn the filters off/on at any time if they would prefer to enjoy the original visuals of the Battle Network games.&quot;
You can find Volume 1 on the Nintendo Store here, and Volume 2 here. Of note, Rockman EXE 4.5 Real Operation and Mega Man Battle Network 5: Double Team DS do not seem to be part of this collection.
Mega Man Battle Network Switch Volume 1 game list:

Mega Man Battle Network 2
Mega Man Battle Network 3 Blue
Mega Man Battle Network 3 White

A proposal to repeal the applicable law was submitted in Parliament last year, but that ultimately failed.

                              <span>Nvidia DLAA (Deep Learning Anti-Aliasing) is more of a niche prospect than its upscaler cousin DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling), though it shares the same ultimate goal of making your PC games look sharper. Like DLSS, DLAA uses a dash of AI brainpower to stitch together frames with more detail than conventional anti-aliasing techniques like TAA and MSAA – only with DLAA, there’s no upscaling involved. That means no performance gains, but for those with sufficiently powerful Nvidia RTX GPUs, potentially superior image quality at all resolutions. Even better than DLSS, mayhaps.

                              <span>First announced last year, Endless Dungeon is a top-down, tactical roguelite hero-shooter set in Amplitude&#x27;s Endless universe - yer Endless Legend and Endless Space types. Lots of things with no end, basically. It&#x27;s also a sort of sequel to Dungeon Of The Endless, a turn-based game from 2014 that laid a lot of the groundwork for Endless Dungeon&#x27;s core loop of dungeon runs and wave survival. I got to sample one of its earliest levels with three different heroes in a recent hour long preview session, but came away with mixed feelings. If you can get a foothold in a run it&#x27;s fantastic, but getting that foothold can be frustrating in its current state.

                              <span>One of the developers behind the component games of Sega’s Sonic Origins collection has spoken out on Twitter to defend their team in light of the collection’s numerous alleged bugs. Headcannon founder Simon Thornley, also known as Stealth, took responsibility for some of the collection’s issues in a lengthy series of tweets, but said that “a lot was beyond our control”.

                              <span>During its annual Spark 2022 conference, Tencent Games unveiled Code: To Jin Yong, a new open-world action title steeped in wuxia literature and created in Unreal Engine 5.
The upcoming game comes from LightSpeed Studio, a Chinese team most notable for developing Apex Legends Mobile and PUBG Mobile. Code: To Jin Yong is an adaptation of a series of wuxia (a genre of fantasy martial arts) novels by acclaimed author Jin Yong, whose works have been extremely popular in China since the 1950s. The game features heroes from Yong’s novels and leverages Unreal 5’s power, such as photogrammetry technology, to create dazzling martial arts combat and physics that fans of wuxia films should appreciate. Check out the gameplay demo below to see it in action. 


Code: To Jin Yong has no release date or confirmed platforms, but Tencent’s press release states it will be available globally “in the near future.” What do you think of this first look at the title? Let us know in the comments!</span>

                              <span>Gamescom returns as a hybrid in-person/online event this August, and the pieces have begun falling into – and in several cases, out of – place. Although several big publishers have already pulled out of what’s arguably the biggest convention in gaming, Ubisoft has confirmed it will have a presence at the show.
See you at @gamescom!

Ubisoft’s attendance is noteworthy because other heavy-hitters such as Nintendo, Sony, Take-Two, and Activision are skipping the show this year. Although there’s no confirmed list of attendees, THQ Nordic will also attend and plans to reveal four unannounced games. 
As for what Ubisoft has in store, we know that it plans to discuss the future of Assassin’s Creed during its own special event in September, so we probably won’t learn anything substantial about the next mainline entry at Gamescom. Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake recently shifted development teams, so it also seems unlikely to reappear. Do we see Skull &amp; Bones, the development of which Ubisoft described as proceeding “well” earlier this year? Splinter Cell Remake? Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2? We’ll have to tune in to find out. 
Gamescom takes place from August 24 to 28 in Cologne, Germany, at the Koelnmesse Convention Centre. The event kicks off on August 23 with Opening Night Live, the big showcase of game trailers, reveals, and announcements hosted by Geoff Keighley.</span>

                              <span>Valve’s handheld PC and most successful Steam Machine to date is wrapping up its Q2 2022 reservation fulfillment today and will be moving on the Q3 preorders starting next week. The devices will also be manufactured at an increased pace, so those who thought they might have to wait a while longer to pick one up may be in luck.
Valve tweeted today from its Steam Deck account that those who preordered the Steam Deck and have an expected Q3 2022 fulfillment date should check their email inboxes starting on June 30. The announcement of the latest group of preorder shipments comes paired with the reveal that Valve is increasing production of the handheld, essentially doubling the previous quarter’s output. 
“Hello! Some great news on the production front. We just sent the last batch of Q2 emails, and we’ll start sending Q3 reservation emails on the 30th,” says the @OnDeck tweet. “Production has picked up, and after today we’ll be shipping more than double the number of Steam Decks every week!”

This is excellent news for folks waiting to get their hands on a Steam Deck and might be a positive sign to those who have yet to pull the trigger on a reservation. I just got the go-ahead to purchase my Deck last week and can’t wait to get my hands on it to play all the hottest JRPGs from the ’90s and early 2000s instead of new releases like Elden Ring or DNF Duel. Who am I kidding? I’ll be playing those as well. 
If you’re curious about what the Steam Deck is all about, check out our official review of the device here and this test of 23 games on the device to see what it’s capable of playing. If you’re interested in preordering one for yourself, you can do that by slapping $5 down through the Steam client or website.</span>

Below is an obituary written by Steven L. Kent, author and gaming journalist, sent to Game Informer for use, in full: 
Bernard “Bernie” Stolar, a former top executive at Atari, Sony Computer Entertainment America, and Sega of America, passed away at the age of 75.
“Bernie was a low-key guy. He kept his ego in check,” remembers Vince Desi, founder of Running with Scissors. “I’ve known Bernie for a long time, and I’ve never heard him raise his voice. He was a gentleman in an industry where there really aren’t many.” 
Stolar’s introduction to the video game business came with the 1981 release of an arcade game called Shark Attack. Created by Pacific Novelty and manufactured by Game P…</span>

                              <span>Nintendo has revealed that a Direct Mini: Partner Showcase is happening tomorrow. 
As many have predicted and expected, Nintendo is hosting a Direct tomorrow, but it&#x27;s not the typical Direct many were hoping to see happen sometime this month to coincide with the rest of the big June gaming showcases. That&#x27;s because it&#x27;s a Direct Mini that&#x27;s also a partner showcase. This means it will be a smaller-scale Direct (see: mini) focused on third-party titles. However, this doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean we won&#x27;t see anything from Nintendo&#x27;s first-party studios because surprises can happen – just don&#x27;t go in expecting it. 
A new #NintendoDirectMini: Partner Showcase is on the way! Watch on-demand via our YouTube channel beginning Tuesday, June 28 at 6am PT for roughly 25 minutes of info on upcoming third-party #NintendoSwitch games.

Not much else is known about the direct, and there aren&#x27;t too many rumors swirling around this partner showcase in regards to specific titles or announcements. Fortunately, we don&#x27;t have to wait long because we&#x27;re less than 24 hours away from this Direct Mini. 
While waiting for tomorrow, read about how Shigeru Miyamoto initially cringed when he saw the art style of The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker.

                              <span>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker is a beloved game in the long-running Zelda series, but when it was first revealed, the reception was mixed. Some were completely on board, ready for this new take on the franchise, while others weren’t too happy about the visual style of the game. The latter party apparently included Legend of Zelda creator Shigeru Miyamoto. 
According to a translation of an old issue of Nintendo Dream Magazine by DidYouKnowGaming, Wind Waker director Eiji Aonuma said Miyamoto “literally cringed” when he first saw the game’s visual style, as reported by Video Games Chronicle. 


“If I had gone and talked to him from the very beginning, I think he would’ve said ‘How is that Zelda?&#x27;.&quot; Aonuma said in the magazine. “Miyamoto had trouble letting go of the realistic Link art style until the very end.
“At some point, he had to give a presentation against his will. That’s when he said something to me like, ‘You know, it’s not too late to change course and make a realistic Zelda.&#x27;” 
Miyamoto is a legend, obviously, but it might’ve been a good thing that Aonuma trusted he and his team’s instinct and continued forward with Wind Waker’s art style – the game’s all the more memorable for it. 
For more about Miyamoto, read how he wants to make the world a better place and then check out this story about how the latest Zelda, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild 2 (or whatever its sequel ends up being titled) has been delayed out of 2022 and into spring of 2023.

                              <span>The Boys is one of the most popular shows on television right now, with Season 3 currently underway. It’s a brutal show, with hilarious satire and multiple wild characters, but it seemingly didn’t hold the interest of Metal Gear Solid and Death Stranding director Hideo Kojima. 
That’s because he quit after watching three episodes of Season 1, but the reason might have to do with more than just interest in the series. In a new series of tweets first spotted by Video Games Chronicle, Kojima has revealed that at one point in the past (likely 2019, which is when the first season of The Boys aired), he was making something similar in concept to The Boys. In fact, he put it on hold because of its similarity.

                              <span>Space Bob vs. The Replicons is an ambitious 2D game about flying your spaceship onto a procedurally generated planet surface, gathering resources and tethering them to your ship, then blasting back into orbit to explore more of outerspace. There&#x27;s a new trailer for it below, but it&#x27;s not a new game. Space Bob launched in 2018, sold poorly, and then its developer left the games industry. That developer is returning now to take a second swing at the game and released a major update earlier this week.

Xbox Game Pass now helps me in my tests by, eventually, adding each iteration, and FIFA 22 is now available through the subscription service as part of June&#x27;s haul of new games.

Also added this past week: the Shadowrun Trilogy, Total War: Three Kingdoms, Naraka: Bladepoint. And Far Cry 5 will arrive on July 1st.

If you bought the game on GOG, you could at least switch over to the superior ScummVM release, but not on Steam... Until earlier today, when Blade Runner Classic was added to the Steam version, too.

Despite the gloom, overall piracy volumes are down 53% on figures reported in 2016 but FAPAV says that Italy needs to do much better.

                              <span>With its approachable gameplay and chess-like complexity, Into the Breach has been an incredible strategy option for PC and Switch owners. With its upcoming Advanced Edition expansion, new content is getting pumped into the mech tactics games where it can already be played. Even better still, mobile versions are landing the same day with the new DLC bolted right in from the start.


Subset Games, which also developed the space-faring rogue-lite FTL, is releasing the Advanced edition on July 19. It comes new units, weapons, pilots, abilities, and more. For expert players, there will be a more challenging difficulty mode to contend with, along with new bosses and enemies to learn to defeat efficiently and effectively. Here are some bullet points of what to expect in Into the Breach&#x27;s Advanced Edition Update:
Five new mech squads
Nearly 40 new weapons
Four new pilots and new pilot abilities
New enemies, bosses, and missions
More challenging difficulty mode
Seven new languages
New music from Ben Prunty
Into the Breach will be making its mobile device debut on July 19 as well, but these editions are only available for Netflix subscribers. Subset Games promises there are no ads or in-app purchases involved with the mobile app. All you need to access it is to be a Netflix subscriber, and the game is free to access on your iOS and Android device. These versions include a revised touch interface designed to function better on a smaller screen like a cell phone.
For those who like to collect, Into the Breach is going to have a physical edition on Switch courtesy of Fangamer. Preorders are live now, and the boxed copy will be released later this year. This tactile copy of Into the Breach will include the Advanced Edition content listed above but will also come with other physical goodies like a poster, inside cover box art, an instruction manual, and sticker sheets.</span>

In Jurassic World Evolution 2&#x27;s new expansion, Dominion Biosyn, you play through this corporation&#x27;s first days and learn how its hunger to bring back never-before-seen dinosaurs takes a turn for the worse.
My time in Biosyn&#x27;s sprawling dinosaur sanctuary was short yet rewarding. The new campaign flows harmlessly from mission to mission, allowing for success with little pushback. Some dinosaurs get sick or may misbehave, but this is essentially a stress-free playthrough that lets you interact with a handful of fantastic new dinosaurs within just an hour or two.
All of the Biosyn dinosaurs are fantastic additions, bringing the r…</span>

                              <span>Jupiter looms large, serving as an imposing backdrop as cargo ship pilot Jacob Lee crashes on the Gas Giant’s second-biggest moon. Our solar system’s largest planet may play host to a seemingly eternal storm, but something far fiercer is brewing on Callisto. It’s here that the creator of the Dead Space series, Glen Schofield, stages perhaps his most horrifying project yet.
Set 300 years in the future, The Callisto Protocol unmistakably carries Schofield’s creative DNA, but through innovative technology, an uncompromised vision, and lessons learned from decades of development experience, Striking Distance Studios feels it has something more than a spiritual successor on its hands. The Callisto Protocol challenges players to face their fears as they descend into the depths of a lunar prison overrun by monstrous, infected humans and uncover what happened to one of our great hopes for life beyond Earth. We witnessed never-before-seen gameplay and spent hours picking the brains of Striking Distance Studios’ veteran developers to learn how this team is creating one of the scariest, most intense games of 2022.
In 2019, Schofield took a trip out to the desert to get away from the hustle and bustle of the game industry. Just months prior, he had left Activision, a publisher with whom he had worked for nearly a decade. While there, he helped lead a studio he cofounded, Sledgehammer Games, as it worked on three mainline Call of Duty titles: Modern Warfare 3, Advanced Warfare, and WWII. Schofield eventually transitioned to an executive role within Activision before leaving the company less than a year later. He decided to take some time off and plot his next move.

                              <span>coverage here.

In a recent Reddit AMA, the Overwatch 2 team from Blizzard Entertainment took questions from the community regarding the state of the franchise and the upcoming pseudo-sequel to its popular hero shooter. In one answer, the folks from Blizz confirm an interesting detail about OW2 when it hits Early Access in the first week of October: it’ll replace the original Overwatch entirely.
When OW2 launches on Oct 4th it will be a replacement for the current Live Service.

Rather than being a separate app on your console of choice or the Blizzard launcher, Overwatch 2 won’t be built up bit by bit on its own but will take the place of the original game and build off of that instead.
While Overwatch 1 and 2 have always been planned to be tied together into a single client and overall roadmap, this is the first time Blizzard has announced publically that Overwatch 1 will cease to exist entirely when the sequel launches. Get your 6v6 games in now because they won’t be playable as of the OW2 Early Access launch.
Also of note from this quote is the timeframe of PvE content coming to OW2. Its initial Early Access content this year will provide a revamp to the PvP experience with new heroes, maps, modes, etc., but the long-touted narrative content for the sequel will be coming sometime in 2023 instead of with the rest of the package.
Overwatch 2 will be free-to-play starting on October 4 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.</span>

                              <span>Along with the debut of Tiny Tina&#x27;s Wonderlands on Steam this week, a brand new DLC has landed for the Bunkers &amp; Badasses-themed shooter. You can check out the trailer for Molten Mirrors below.


Those who venture into the Molten Mirrors DLC will face off against the Fyodor, the Soul Warden who digs holes and hordes souls, probably. In the trailer, there&#x27;s plenty of footage of the bullet-hell elements added to Molten Mirrors that will surely put players&#x27; abilities at dipping and dodging to the test. 
However, taking on the challenges of the Soul Worden and the Molten Mirrors content isn&#x27;t free. You can join in on the fresh mayhem if you own the Wonderlands with the $29.99 Season Pass or purchase the DLC on its own for $9.99.
If you&#x27;re still on the fence about whether to check out Tiny Tina&#x27;s Wonderlands, read our review to better inform your potential purchasing decision.</span>

                              <span>In an interview with 4Gamer.net, Elden Ring director and president of From Software, Hidetaka Miyazaki, revealed some information about the studio&#x27;s next project and even left some room for the possibility of an Elden Ring sequel. Translations of the interview are courtesy of Google translate, so please forgive if they are a little rough.
Regarding the next From Software project, 4Gamer inquired about three games that were in the pipeline when Sekiro was in development. At the time, two of the titles were unknown to the public, with one ending up being this year&#x27;s smash hit Elden Ring. As for the other, we seemingly don&#x27;t have to wait too long to see what it is. When asked whether that other game was still in development, Miyazaki responded, &quot;Yes. Development is in its final stages.&quot;

                              <span>Illumination’s upcoming animated Mario movie was recently delayed to next spring. Perhaps the biggest downside to that news is the fact that we have to go even longer before hearing what Chris Pratt’s Mario voice sounds like. Today, Variety caught up with Pratt to ask about the film, with the actor describing his take on Mario as “unlike anything you’ve heard in the Mario world before.”
For those unaware, Pratt portrays Mario in the film and much the biggest buzz around the film has centered on his voice. Some have expressed concern about a non-Italian playing an Italian character and the voice potentially being offensive while the film’s co-producer described Pratt’s performance as “phenomenal.” 
Speaking to Variety, Pratt discusses how he experimented with the voice and worked closely with directors to find a unique take on Mario that he felt proud of, saying in part “It’s an animated voiceover narrative. It’s not a live-action movie. I’m not gonna be wearing a plumber suit running all over. I’m providing a voice for an animated character, and it is updated and unlike anything you’ve heard in the Mario world before.”
Regardless of what Pratt sounds like, Nintendo is reportedly happy with the film, which was said to be mostly finished last November, so Illumination must be doing something right. The Mario movie is slated to premiere in U.S. theaters on April 7. In addition to Chris Pratt’s Mario, the cast includes Charlie Day (Luigi), Anya Taylor-Joy (Peach), Jack Black (Bowser), Keegan-Michael Key (Toad), and Seth Rogen (Donkey Kong).

                              <span>The old school FPS revival has largely left me cold, if I&#x27;m honest. Even the ones I&#x27;ve enjoyed tend to get old within an hour. Most of the things that get recreated aren&#x27;t the things I miss about 90s games, and if they were... Doom still exists, you know? So does Blood, and Strife, and Quake was never that good anyway.


Extraneum is good, though. I think it&#x27;s precisely because it&#x27;s not doing a big song and dance about its influences, although those are very clear. It&#x27;s not big or brash, nor overly stripped down or obnoxious about difficulty. Clean blasty strafey fun, with a tiniest hint of horror. In an odd way, it&#x27;s all the more faithful for that.

                              <span>In the giant jumbled word cloud of all my qualities and traits, I&#x27;m willing to bet that &quot;pluviophile&quot; would be one of the biggest words. I adore rain. Whenever it starts, I tend to drop whatever I&#x27;m doing - work, dishes, significant other - and I&#x27;ll be out frolicking in the downpour before they&#x27;ve hit the floor.
Because I love rain so much, I hold games to an almost unfair standard when it comes to the simulation of precipitation. How in the world can a videogame come close to emulating that wonderful, transcendental feeling of being outside in the middle of a thunderstorm? The answer is, it can&#x27;t. Games have to rely on other things, like textures, sounds, and clever little animations to really sell the idea of being out amongst the H₂s and the Os.
The time has come, fellow pluviophiles. It&#x27;s time to grade the very best rain that PC gaming has to offer. Below you&#x27;ll find our eight worthy contenders. Each has been chosen for their spectacular rendition of one of nature&#x27;s greatest phenomena. Each one shall be marked according to my patented and cutting-edge WIPERS grading system for digital rain. So drop what you&#x27;re doing. It&#x27;s time to frolick. No umbrella required.

                              <span>A pair of new hidden object games have a pleasingly straightforward name to describe their inception: I Commissioned Some Bees. The developer paid illustrators to draw pictures with bees, and you can find the bees. It&#x27;s quite fun to find the bees. I got into hidden object games a few years back with the lovely Hidden Folks and the vast 100 Hidden X series, and today have enjoyed poring over colourful and often surreal landscapes to find our striped friends.

                              <span>We finally got our first glimpse of Starfield at the Xbox &amp; Bethesda showcase at Summer Geoff Fest, having seen lots of clips of Todd Howard speaking words with devs who nodded across tables. I partly share the same opinion as Alice Bee, who thought the game could&#x27;ve shown us anything and they chose grey rocks again.
What I wasn&#x27;t expecting was to feel a bit emotional about the game&#x27;s reveal, though. I mean, I felt this weird swell in my chest of excitement or something. Maybe it was the crushing jet lag, or maybe it was a heady mixture of nostalgia. Let&#x27;s investigate.

                              <span>Into The Breach was our second favourite game of 2018 and remains the best strategy game ever made. So it&#x27;s exciting news that Into The Breach: Advanced Edition is coming next month with new mechs, weapons and enemies to shove around in a free update.

                              <span>As odd as it might sound, there has long been an urban legend that Michael Jackson was involved in creating part of the soundtrack for Sonic 3. Now Sonic creator and Sonic 3 programmer Yuji Naka has seemed to lend credence to that legend on Twitter, as it relates to the replacement of certain tracks in the recently released remasters in Sonic Origins.

                              <span>A Plague Tale: Requiem is a stealth game with several fantastical elements. The first fantasy is that you can consistently remember how to spell &quot;Requiem&quot;. The second is &#x27;What would it be like if you had the power of rats?&#x27;. The third is, &#x27;What if rats had any power to have?&#x27;. As a new extended trailer shows, the answer is: you can sense blood, and use that power to avoid the guards who want to do a big murder on you and your sister.

The trailer is worth watching for its own sake, but also comes with news: Requiem will launch on October 18th, forwarding another fantasy called &#x27;What if a game actually came out in 2022 and wasn&#x27;t delayed until next year?&#x27;.

                              <span>There are two reasons to consider playing the new &#x27;Enhanced Edition&#x27; of Blade Runner over the version which hit GOG in 2019: 1) it has controller support; 2) it&#x27;s on consoles. Beyond that, Nightdive&#x27;s remastering has made Westwood&#x27;s 1997 adventure game look notably uglier and you&#x27;d be better off with GOG&#x27;s ScummVM version. The Enhanced Edition is out today and I&#x27;ve been flicking back and forth between the two versions, tutting. The Enhanced Edition still looks like a 25-year-old game, only now it looks 25 years old, blurry, and unlike itself.

                              <span>I still don&#x27;t know whether to describe The Heroic Legend Of Eagarlnia as &quot;complicated&quot; or &quot;simple&quot;. Before starting a game, it gives an impression of being a complex grand strategy that&#x27;s something like a fantasy Total War with a D&amp;D alignment system and a distinctly East Asian focus on characters and dialogue.
It&#x27;s far simpler than that. There was a period of disappointment, even, when it seemed like there wasn&#x27;t much to it at all. That&#x27;s partly because it&#x27;s easy to play it too passively, or get stuck in attritional stand offs, and partly because of the need for a bit too much repetition. But over time its subtler details become more apparent, and your choices start to feel more multifaceted.
And yet, it remains at heart the same throughout. On your first ten turns you&#x27;re doing the same actions as in your 200th, and its battles in particular are largely hands off. So maybe it&#x27;s complicated, but simple to actually play? Hmm.

                              <span>An ongoing crash in cryptocurrency prices is causing some miners to abandon ship, selling off their racks of graphics cards at discount prices in a bid to recoup some cash. Wccftech spotted that some erstwhile miners across China and South Asia, previously encouraged by low energy costs, are even hosting livestreamed auctions to get rid of their GPU ‘stock’ en masse. 


First off: ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. Second, while it’s entertaining to imagine desperate crypto barons hosting a kind of QVC channel for dusty PC components, I wouldn’t necessarily take this as a long-overdue opportunity to upgrade your graphics card on the cheap.

This week Nate returns, but Matthew is away - and since he is the real agent of chaos, Nate and I have a remarkably sensible conversation about different weather and seasons in a lot of games. Who&#x27;d have thought? Not me. And in fact there is weather in all sorts of places you wouldn&#x27;t expect to look.
Don&#x27;t worry, though, because we find time to talk about how our weeks have been, as well as a bit where I tell Nate there&#x27;s going to be a survival crafting game set in Moria and he gets excited. Also, stay tuned for a Cavern Of Lies where Nate does a lot of cowboy voices. And shout out to John for sending in cheery EWS fan game Aquarium Assault: Dark Day For A Dogfish!

                              <span>Valve are kicking off 2022’s Steam Summer Sale today with discounts on AAA and indie games, starting at 6pm BST/7pm CEST/10am PST. It’s being styled as the ‘Steam 3000’ sale even though that year is a long way off according to my calendar. For some reason, Valve have decided they&#x27;re doing videos to hype this stuff now too. You can watch the trailer below to get some idea of what might be discounted very soon.

                              <span>The RTX 3060 is the best value 1080p graphics card, and recently it&#x27;s gotten significantly cheaper as next-gen Nvidia GPUs have been rumoured. Right now, you can pick up a Gigabyte RTX 3060 Eagle 12GB for just £330 at Scan UK, a £61 reduction over the same card at Amazon UK and some £40 cheaper than the cheapest RTX 3060 we spotted last month. If you&#x27;re in the market for a new GPU and you&#x27;ve got a 1080p monitor, this is an awesome shout.

Set in that most dodgy of times, the future, Hyenas is about pilfering relics of pop culture such as Pez dispensers, Mega Drives and Sonic The Hedgehog paraphernalia before tech billionaires who’ve colonised Mars can furnish their homes with it all. You can be bemused at your own leisure by watching the trailer below.

That&#x27;s a £50 reduction from its normal price, and some £22 cheaper than the CPU and cooler on Amazon. This would make an excellent start to a new system, with the 3600&#x27;s six cores and twelve threads pairing well with a modern RTX 20-series or Radeon RX 5000-series or later graphics card.

                              <span>I don&#x27;t tend to be biased towards games just because they&#x27;re new, so I feel it carries some weight when I say that The Sims 4 Werewolves Game Pack has immediately become one of my favourite add-ons for The Sims 4. Having been a fan of the Vampires and Realm Of Magic (a.k.a. wizards, basically) game packs since their respective releases, I can safely say that Werewolves has done an excellent job iterating and expanding on what worked from those previous supernatural outings.

                              <span>I was in LA for Summer Geoff Fest and I played a whole bunch of games. No, not lots of blockbusters – mainly because there weren&#x27;t too many of those about - but lots of indies, instead. In fact, out of all the games I saw or played or glanced at while I dashed between appointments, it was the indies that really stood out.

                              <span>Former Ubisoft developer Charles Randall has been spilling the beans about the original Assassin’s Creed on Twitter again. This time, Randall made several of the RPS team spit out their tea when he revealed that the game’s horse model is really a stretched out human skeleton. That’s some genuinely nightmarish imagery to contemplate first thing in the morning.

                              <span>Despite being heavily criticized for his role in Activision Blizzard’s ongoing employee sexual abuse scandal, CEO Bobby Kotick will remain on the company’s board of directors for another year.
The publisher held its annual meeting of stockholders, who voted on five proposals, such as its list of ten directors, including Kotick, to serve one-year terms. The document detailing the results shows that an overwhelming 533,703,580 investors voted in Kotick’s favor against 62,597,199 who voted against him. 2,162,178 shareholders abstained from voting.
The result means that Kotick retains his spot until Activision’s 2023 stockholder meeting next June. The development comes after Kotick spent the last year under fire for reportedly hiding details of the company’s abuse problems from shareholders, which caused some employees and investors to call for his resignation. Kotick has responded by reducing his salary until “transformational gender goals” were met. Activision has since hired new chief diversity, equity, and inclusion officer. 
Although Kotick remains on Activision’s board, his future as CEO once Microsoft’s acquisition of the company is complete remains unknown. The deal isn’t expected to go through until sometime next summer, possibly around the time of the next stockholder meeting.</span>

                              <span>Crystal Dynamics announced in April that Marvel&#x27;s Avengers&#x27; next hero would be Jane Foster as the Mighty Thor. A new War Table blog post names the date fans will see the Goddess of Thunder in action.
Mark Monday, June 27 on your calendar as the date to watch a War Table Deep Dive detailing Jane&#x27;s powers and abilities. Jane will become available as part of the 2.5 update, which arrives just a day later on June 28. That should whet fans&#x27; appetite for the character&#x27;s Norse-powered return in the upcoming Thor: Love &amp; Thunder, which hits theaters on July 8. 
It&#x27;ll be interesting to see how Crystal Dynamics differentiates Jane&#x27;s moveset from Thor&#x27;s. In the comics, Jane possessed all of the abilities of Thor during her time as the Goddess of Thunder. The only notable difference was her ability to manipulate Mjolnir with greater control and creativity (especially when throwing it) than her predecessors, so that&#x27;s something the studio can certainly hone in and expand upon.

                              <span>A Plague Tale: Requiem finally arrives on October 18, Focus Entertainment announced today during a special broadcast. The release confirmation comes alongside an extended gameplay showing that follows Amicia and Hugo as they attempt to escape an enemy-laden quarry.
You can watch the new demo below to get an in-game look at a slice of the game’s story, as the siblings are pursued by soldiers. This leads to a good showing of the game&#x27;s stealth as the pair sneak around the quarry. Amicia also gets her hands dirty taking out enemies in a showcase of the game&#x27;s action. 


Additionally, a video showcasing the game’s previously announced $189.99 Collector’s Editon provides up-close looks at the Amicia and Hugo resin statue. 


A Plague Tale: Requiem will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. It will also be playable on Switch via cloud streaming.</span>

                              <span>The Biophage, The Callisto Protocol’s monstrous antagonists, are as mysterious as they are deadly. To understand the design process behind the Biophage and the game’s copious amounts of gore, we spoke with Striking Distance’s Character Director Glauco Longhi to learn how the studio created nightmares it hopes will terrify players. 
Longhi tells us the Biophage was born out of the studio’s philosophical desire to create enemies grounded in reality while also applying their own creativity. He even cites realism as one of his personal pillars of what makes the most effective horror monster.
“It has to feel grounded, it has to feel real,” Longhi explains.  “It doesn&#x27;t have to be real, but it has to feel real, right? That can mean many different things. But in my opinion, it has to be interesti…</span>

                              <span>Welcome back to a new episode of The Game Informer Show! We know what you&#x27;re thinking, and yes, we are aware that Nintendo just put on a Xenoblade 3 digital showcase, but that won&#x27;t stop us from hoping for more. Just like with Sony and Microsoft, we&#x27;re brushing off our crystal balls and predicting what Nintendo will have at its big summer Direct...whenever that may be.
Will The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild&#x27;s sequel make an appearance with a more concrete gameplay section and a name reveal? Will Nintendo continue to roll out its iconic characters on Switch with a new Donkey Kong game? Can we expect to see Samus in the form of the rumored Metroid Prime Trilogy port or the much-anticipated Metroid Prime 4? Only time will tell, but we hope today&#x27;s podcast will be a fun distraction while we wait for the next big Nintendo Direct!

In the original story, posted below, he seemingly expressed disappointment that some of Sonic 3&#x27;s music has been swapped out in Sonic Origins due to Jackson&#x27;s connection to it. In a follow-up tweet, he posted: &quot;I feel like I&#x27;m being misunderstood a lot, probably because I don&#x27;t speak English and I&#x27;m using a translation tool. Sorry.&quot;

                              <span>No Man&#x27;s Sky creator Hello Games has teamed up with Bandai Namco to bring its hit survival title to the Nintendo Switch. We knew from a Nintendo Direct that aired earlier this year the game was coming to the portable console before today&#x27;s announcement. However, the last mention of the project came with a summer release window, which has now been pushed back. But vague time frames are a thing of the past, No Man&#x27;s Sky is officially coming to the Switch October 7. 
Fans all over the world can pick up either a physical or digital copy of the game come October. In addition to the Nintendo console launch, PlayStation 5 owners will be able to buy a physical remastered edition on the same date. The remaster will come with all the previously released content included, which when tallied up means new-gen PlayStation owners will have access to 20 different updates in total.


Looking over the titles&#x27;s long history and its new leap onto the Switch, Hello Games founder Sean Murray observed the following.
 No Man&#x27;s Sky&#x27;s Switch and PS5 remastered editions are set to release on October 7, but you can also purchase a copy of the game on all major platforms.</span>

                              <span>Atari is among the oldest and most well-known names in the gaming industry, and it’s celebrating its 50th year on June 27. It first established its headquarters in Sunnyvale, California, neighbor to a host of now-famous tech startups. The new logo, a callback to the retro design of the old location, features the company’s classic branding alongside a semi-transparent “50.” Atari is calling the limited-time celebration logo “Borregas” after the street where you could find the headquarters. According to the company, this design will join with the previously revealed “Sunnyvale” anniversary logo in gracing the many upcoming corporate announcements, game reveals, partnerships, and merchandising collaborations.
 “Design innovation was a fundamental driver and differentiator for Atari during the golden age of video games,” said Wade Rosen, CEO of Atari. “Every artist, designer, and engineer challenged themselves to reach creative excellence; it is a hallmark of Atari that persists to this day.”
In the midst of the logo’s reveal, it also looks like an Atari classic is getting a revival. According to Gamerbraves, a follow-up to Yar’s Revenge is in the works. The information comes straight from Howard Scott Warshaw, who worked at Atari in the ‘80s and created the title for the Atari 2600. The interview contained few concrete details on the project, just that it seems the sequel has been greenlit. Hopefully, we will hear more about the game as development continues.</span>

                              <span>Sega&#x27;s Creative Assembly is working on a brand-new game revealed today: Hyenas. The title is described as a multiplayer, multi-team heist experience set in space with a punky comic book aesthetic. What this means practically is players can jump into five teams of three to battle each other over a prize and &quot;engage, evade, exploit, and steal their way to victory.&quot; The game&#x27;s debut trailer shows off some fast-pasted action, but to see everything for yourself, you can check out the trailer below.


The story envisions a world in which the billionaires have finally made it to mars, destroying Earth in the process. However, the rich get nostalgic for their former planet&#x27;s culture. So, they send out ships to collect plunder from the remnants of Earth&#x27;s poor survivors. Not content to take this sitting down, the Hyenas are fighting back.
The game is still in early development, so the creators have not revealed the release date, but we do know the game is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Though it&#x27;s still a ways off, you can sign up for Hyenas&#x27; alpha today, and you can learn much more about the title in IGN&#x27;s Summer of Gaming interview-filled stream.</span>

                              <span>Glen Schoefield has made a name for himself, working on Dead Space, Call of Duty, and even Barbie: Game Girl. Heading up Striking Distance Studios, the industry icon sits down with us today to go over 83 Rapid-Fire questions focusing on The Callisto Protocol, the horror genre, and so much more!


It&#x27;s Alex Stadnik&#x27;s turn to host, and he has plenty of questions. One of the main focuses is getting to know The Callisto Protocol and what players can expect. We find out basic information such as what kind of weapons we&#x27;ll be using, why the game takes place on the dead moon of Jupiter, and the new gruesome Biophage enemies. We also dive into inspirations, definitively answer a circulating fan theory, and much more.
But this isn&#x27;t Rapid-Fire without some fun, right? We also tell Glen our best Candyman joke, see if things like The Strangers or your mom using your full name are scarier than his upcoming game, and whether or not he can think of five words that rhyme with gore. But what other secrets does Glen have up his sleeve? You&#x27;ll have to watch the video to find out! 
The Callisto Protocol is releasing on December 2, 2022, for PlayStation and Xbox consoles and PC. Head to our exclusive cover hub below, where you&#x27;ll find our preview impressions, the GI cover reveal, and more looks at the game in the upcoming days. For more Rapid-Fire fun, check out our curated playlist on YouTube, featuring industry legends such as Tim Schafer, Joseph Staten, and Jake Solomon. Thanks, as always, for watching.</span>

                              <span>Quentin Tarantino has asked a California court to dismiss a copyright lawsuit filed by Miramax against his &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; NFT project. The director&#x27;s legal team submitted a motion for judgment, arguing that the movie company&#x27;s claims fall flat. The Pulp Fiction film is a derivative of the screenplay, not the other way around, they stress.

                              <span>In May, former Megaupload executives Mathias Ortmann and Bram van der Kolk revealed a deal to avoid extradition to the US by being charged with crimes in New Zealand. Today the men pleaded guilty and both face up to 10 years in prison. Kim Dotcom - who is not part of the deal - congratulated his former friends last month but now accuses them of facilitating Chinese spying.

                              <span>When I got a hands off look at Oxenfree II: Lost Signals, my analysis was that it looked a lot like Oxenfree and therefore if you liked Oxenfree you would like this. I have now played through a small bit of the game, a slightly extended version of the area I saw in the hands off preview, and my analysis is... largely the same.
I know that&#x27;s very boring, but it&#x27;s also positive, isn&#x27;t it? Oxenfree was good, and Oxenfree II looks to be doing those same things that made Oxenfree good. A 2D, side-on supernatural thriller with radios. Good thing remains good! In a world where sequels to beloved media seem to only get progressively worse, I&#x27;ll happily take it (especially since this one is a Netflix-published project now). And although it&#x27;s directly related to the first game, the characters and happenings in Oxenfree II are distinct enough that it&#x27;s going to be accessible if you&#x27;re new to the series. And even if you did play the first game, it&#x27;s possible that Oxenfree II will be more thrilling and unsettling to you now, five years later.

                              <span>Now that all the unusually stressful benchmarking is out the way, let’s talk how mineral-grubbing “quest shooter” The Cycle: Frontier performs on PC. Short version: pretty well! It can make do with older and lower-end hardware at 1080p, and scales nicely all the way up to 4K and ultrawide resolutions, taking full advantage of the best graphics cards or the best gaming monitors with high refresh rates. If your rig is only just scraping past the system requirements, there are also some chunky performance improvements available via the right graphics settings tweaks.

                              <span>Last time, you decided that undo is better than invert mouse. For many people, this result will turn the world on its head.

                              <span>The Razer Basilisk Ultimate is one of the best wireless mice on the market, offering a comfortably wide design with plenty of buttons and a fancy scroll wheel - a popular recipe that could also describe the Logitech G502. The Basilisk Ultimate normally oscillates between $140 and a sale price of $90, but today it&#x27;s gone lower - it&#x27;s $80 at Amazon. That&#x27;s a pretty solid price for what you&#x27;re getting!

It has gained even more attention in the last day or so, because its creation reunites some of the people who worked on AM2R, the well-liked unofficial Metroid 2 remake that Nintendo DMCA&#x27;d out of existence in 2016.

It looks cute and, as of its departure from Steam Early Access today, robust.

The filing, made last year and published this past week, describes a head-mounted display with a rear housing, and the mechanisms by which that display could be adjusted. It&#x27;s not thrilling stuff - but it is further confirmation that Valve continue to work on designs for VR hardware.

                              <span>I love the name &quot;SpellForce&quot;, mid-word capital letter and all. It conjures a mental image of a kid’s TV show where some, possibly sentai-style, superheroes learn about the importance of spelling and grammar. Maybe a little punctuation, as a treat. SpellForce the video game series isn’t that; it’s a trio of RPG-RTS hybrids which, by the time you read this, will have had a new entry announced in the form of SpellForce: Conquest Of Eo. It’s a fresh, turn-based take on the series which casts the player as a wizard attempting to further their mastery of magic.

                              <span>Since The Cycle: Frontier is having its second (???) launch tomorrow, June 22nd, I thought I’d knock together a performance and settings guide to mark the occasion. This would involve, as they always do, a bunch of benchmark tests: repeatable runs through a specific area or sequence that would give an accurate indication of how different settings and hardware affect performance. In most games these are either quick and easy or time-consuming and easy, but not The Cycle: Frontier. Oh no.


See, without a dedicated benchmarking tool, running these kinds of tests requires a certain controllable environment, where variables are known and parameters can be reset in a click. This is not the case for The Cycle: Frontier, whose environment is usually trying to fucking kill you, particularly though the unavoidable presence of other players. I’ve never sat down to record some average FPS values only to spend half my time cowering behind a tree, fearful of being shot, robbed and – worst of all – forced to start work over again.

                              <span>Yesterday I wrote about eco-strategy game Terra Nil’s demo, which went gangbusters during last week’s Steam Next Fest and shot up into the top 50 most played games on Valve’s storefront. Well, turns out that might be at least partly down to a practice called badge-farming. That’s according to industry pundit Simon Carless’ latest GameDiscoverCo newsletter, anyway.

                              <span>So, you went and flubbed a Reservoir Dogs type of deal, and now you’re a dead’un. As if that wasn’t bad enough, it turns out that Heaven is a corrupt bureaucracy that’s absolutely stuffed with shadowy demons and talking cats. Those demons become your problem when god decides to give you a chance to earn your place in Heaven by committing murder - stylish, speedrunning, parkouring demon murder. It’s perdition with extra steps, then, but is it any fun? Dear reader, Neon White kicks ass.
The game opens with an extremely anime narrative sequence and we’re introduced to the lovable (and less so) doofuses we’ll be shooting up paradise with. This is where most folks will stop and squee at the fact that player character Neon White is voiced by the incomparable Steve Blum, perhaps known best for his role as sonorous space cowboy Spike Spiegel in Cowboy Bebop. White is joined by his fellow demon-slaying Neons including Yellow (best boy), Violet (sucks), Red (mysterious), and Green (bad guy).

                              <span>Last time I played Raft, it was a small but solid survival game about hauling rubbish from the ocean to expand your little slab of planks into a roaming home and farm while fending off hungry sharks. That was maybe 2018. Now, Raft has finally launched out of early access and whoa what is this game now? Undersea cities to explore? Utopian biodomes? A whole post-apocalyptic story? Friendly wildlife like whales and turtles? More murderous fish? Have a look at the cooperative survival wonders in the new trailer, below.

The delay was originally announced on Sunday by the game’s regional publisher in China, NetEase, and was picked up on by industry analyst Daniel Ahmad on Twitter. The decision to delay came a few days after Chinese microblogging site Sina Weibo banned the Diablo Immortal account due to unspecified &quot;violation of related laws and regulations&quot;.

I’m partial to the giant foam hand costume myself. However, Fall Guys has also been removed from sale on Steam so it can become an Epic Games Store exclusive. Don’t worry if you already own the game on Steam though, because you’ll still have access through Valve’s launcher. Here’s some bouncy Free For All update gameplay in the trailer below.

                              <span>Last week Intel published a “quick start guide” for their upcoming Arc A-series graphics cards, including a “Supported Hardware Configurations” section that only specifically namechecked their own 10th, 11th and 12th Gen Core CPUs. Cue a heady mix of confusion and perturbation – surely Intel weren’t suggesting that Arc GPUs would only function when paired with an Intel CPU, and a relatively new one at that?


No, they weren’t, though the guide’s vague wording isn’t doing it – and worse, potential Arc users – any favours. Parts of the guide appear to conflate support for Resizable BAR with support for the Arc A-series in general, which further muddies things as Resizable BAR works on AMD Ryzen chips as well as those three Core CPU generations. I asked Intel directly for clarification and essentially, Arc GPUs won’t have such super specific CPU requirements just to run - though they’ll apparently perform better in systems that do support Resizable BAR.

                              <span>The Acter Nitro 5 is a strong if unremarkable gaming laptop, offering excellent performance for the money in a rather typical gamer-y design. It doesn&#x27;t look quite as cool as a Razer Blade or as beautifully thick as an XMG Apex 15, but it&#x27;s got it where it counts: inside. Right now, you can pick up a Nitro 5 laptop with an RTX 3080 graphics card, Ryzen 7 5800H processor, 1TB NVMe SSD and 1080p 360Hz screen for just £1499 at Ebuyer - a nearly £400 reduction from its original UK RRP.

Most cases are filed by smaller creators, including an artist who accuses Paris Hilton of repeatedly sharing photos on social media that infringe on her fairy wing design.

Many of the questions seek information to help improve the platform but others raise a few concerns. Users are invited to confess to being pirates, say whether they are heavy users of pirate sites, and then name the pirate sites they use the most. Savvy business move or something more sinister?

                              <span>The Arctic P12 is one of the best value high-performance case fans - and now you can get five for £23, some 20% off their usual (already good!) price.  
These fans come in black without RGB for a stealthy look, can be daisy-chained to make cable management easier and can be controlled via PWM from 200 to 1800RPM. In terms of performance, every review I&#x27;ve found mentions their great value, but they also detail whisper-quiet performance at low RPMs.

It&#x27;s very cool, and I have only crashed about a hundred times.

                              <span>I realised earlier that today was the last day of Steam Next Fest, and I panicked. I remembered seeing one particular demo on Steam which made my ears prick up and my eyes expand to thrice their usual size, and until now I hadn&#x27;t the time to try it out. So today I carved out a small portion of the day to download and play the demo for Dome Keeper, a wave-based survival game about protecting your glass dome home from alien invaders using a gigantic laser.
Unfortunately, I ended up playing it a little too long, and now I&#x27;ve left myself no time at all to write about why it was so great. Argh. Let me try anyway.

                              <span>The blue hedgehog is back! He goes very fast in his latest instalment, Sonic Frontiers! And lots of fans – naturally – think it looks terrible! The scepticism is understandable. But having gone hands-on with it at Summer Geoff Fest, I&#x27;d like to pose a counter argument: the game needs to be played. Just seeing it with your eyeballs doesn&#x27;t do it justice. Yes, it&#x27;s a weird departure for Sonic, but I am here for it.

                              <span>I didn&#x27;t get to play as much at Steam Next Fest this weekend as I usually do, partly because I just ran out of time, and partly because the time I did have I spent playing Necrosmith. There were some demos I was meant to play for, like, actual work, and then I ran into a puzzle wall or a bug or something so I just fired up Necrosmith again.
Necrosmith is a 2D necromance &#x27;em up that is also sort of a tower defence game. In the middle of the map is your evil lair, the Hall Of Bones, a sort of legally distinct Sauron&#x27;s tower that gets more flying buttresses the more you upgrade it. If enemies (which can be packs of wolves or flying bugs or all manner of things) do enough damage to destroy it, you lose - so that&#x27;s your defense bit. For the towers bit, you have to imagine that the towers can move on their own, and also that they&#x27;re shambling undead monsters made from a jigsaw of different limbs you find, like an army of very unhygenic Mr Potato Heads.

                              <span>Of all the demos featured in this past week’s Steam Next Fest, indie environmental ‘reverse city-builder’ Terra Nil has performed exceedingly well for itself. The demo has cropped up among the top 50 on the most-played games on Steam over the weekend, and is currently nestled between Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord and Vampire Survivors. Not bad for a chill game about rewilding a barren planet.

While the defendants are likely to be somewhat upset, major Hollywood studios are absolutely fuming. Despite their lawsuit against Nitro being filed months earlier, it&#x27;s still not over, allowing DISH to strike first against any available cash.

If it&#x27;s your turn this time, reader dear, wait one second! Perhaps you might enjoy a twist on this classic immersive sim?

                              <span>A few months have passed since we released ScummVM 2.5.1.
No matter if you expect the scorching heat of the upcoming summer or freezing blizzards in winter (depending on your favorite hemisphere): it’s release time again!
Our lovely developers added support, yet again, for a bunch of new ancient games that require testing:
Sanitarium
Hades Challenge
Marvel Comics Spider-Man: The Sinister Six
The 11th Hour
Clandestiny
Tender Loving Care (CD-ROM Editions)
Uncle Henry&#x27;s Playhouse
Wetlands
Chewy: Esc from F5
Besides these games, we’d appreciate it if you could check our release testing list - maybe you’ll even find your favorite game on there that has been sitting on that shelf for way too long.
And since ScummVM is about playing games in general, we’ve seen quite a bunch of changes across many, many engines - so this is the perfect time for giving your favorites another go.
The AGOS, SCI and SCUMM engine received some really extensive modifications which make all games using those engines very good testing targets as well.
All testing must be done with stable builds, not development ones. Please report any bugs or oddities on our issue tracker.
A detailed list of all exciting new features and fixes is available in our NEWS file.
Thank you very much for your support!
