Just when I thought I&#x27;d seen everything Star Wars had to offer, Zynga introduces one of the strangest ideas yet: a Jawa standing on his brother&#x27;s shoulders to create a tall fighter named Utooni. This puzzling creation is just one of the many combatants in Zynga&#x27;s Star Wars: Hunters, a Switch and mobile game that is slated to release next year.

In the lead-up to the holiday season, Nintendo has been getting celebrities to promote the Switch and its extensive library of games in brief commercials. So far, there have been actors like Neil Patrick Harris and Jessica Alba playing games like Big Brain Academy and Mario Golf: Super Rush.
It turns out though that Nintendo has also given some of these superstars a chance to play games that aren&#x27;t even out yet. According to Elle.com, singer Christina Aguilera mentioned how her family supposedly got to try out Pokémon Legends: Arceus when filming her &#x27;My Way&#x27; promo. Well, kind of... while she did get to see it in action, it was actually her daughter who went hands-on with the upcoming release, due out next month. Here&#x27;s what she had to say about it:

                    <span>This is a conversation that I’m sure has played out countless times across kitchens and living rooms around the world as children, friends and partners patiently try and explain the difference between a video game universe and a tabletop wargaming universe. I just don’t know if it’s ever been done so smoothly.

                    <span>One of the joys of Halo is its replayability. Ask any devotee and you’ll get some story about endlessly rerunning “The Library” in Halo: Combat Evolved, or replaying Halo 2’s “Delta Halo” to get out of bounds and explore that uncannily Canada-looking mountain range. Sadly, at least at launch, you can’t do any of that…

As you&#x27;ve probably noticed by now, the hardware allows for lightning fast gaming when compared to previous generations, and the Quick Resume feature that allows you to seamlessly change games is, well, a game-changer. While the feature set of the Xbox Series X is impressive (not to mention its stellar backward compatibility library), you probably want some games to play on that beast of a console.
The team at Game Informer worked together to compile a list of the 10 games we think are the best on Xbox Series X/S. As more games come out, we&#x27;ll update this list with the latest releases that we feel deserve to crack the top 10.
Please note that while the list below contains 10 entries, we aren’t ranking them. If a game has made it th…</span>

                    <span>Solar Ash is a great game that cherry-picks ideas from Jet Set Radio, Shadow of the Colossus, and Super Mario Galaxy. However, only one series came to mind as I skated across its teal clouds: Sonic the Hedgehog. More specifically, the 3D entries, which are the oft-maligned titles responsible for decades of headaches for the Blue Blur. 
I’ll admit that I’m a Sonic traditionalist. My love of Sonic, like many other 30-somethings, began on the Sega Genesis, so I firmly believe the character is at his best in 2D. Sonic 2 is my favorite in the series and Sonic Mania, the 2017 throwback developed by a team of fans rather than Sonic Team proper, is the best entry in years. 
The 3D installments have never gotten Sonic right. Yes, even the Adventure series, which I respect but still maintain are bad…</span>

                    <span>The first game from Embark Studios, a veteran team led by former EA and Dice head Patrick Söderlund, is set to be revealed this week. The game is called Arc Raiders, and we got a glimpse of what to expect in a cryptic teaser video.
The video is one of those “trailer for the trailer” as it states a full reveal is slated for Thursday, December 9. Hey, that’s the same day as The Game Awards — what a funny coincidence. The video shows some third-person shooting, a woman calling for volunteers, and an “Enlist. Resist” tagline. You can watch the teaser in the tweet below.

December 6, 2021
We first caught wind of Embark’s new game last November, when the studio began hiring for a PvP team-based shooter and shared concept art of the project. It seems safe to assume that Arc Raiders is this project, but we’ll find out for sure soon enough. Embark was formed in 2018 after Söderlund departed EA earlier that same year. The team is based in Stockholm, Sweden, and boasts roughly 200 employees as of November 2020. The company’s mission statement, according to its website, is “to blur the line between playing and making,” and many of the posts have centered on showcasing development tools.
What do you think about this first tease for Arc Raiders? Any guesses as to what kind of game it could be? Share your thoughts in the comments!</span>

                    <span>With the world&#x27;s return to The Matrix franchise a couple of weeks away (the time it would take to download a movie on Limewire in the early 2000s), Epic Games is releasing a new experience built on its new engine. Partnering with the cast and crew from the upcoming film, The Matrix Awakens: An Unreal Engine 5 Experience will show off what the new software can do.

The Matrix Resurrections director Lana Wachowski is involved in bringing this tech showcase to life, and so are the film&#x27;s stars, Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss, who provide performances for Awakens. The trailer for the Unreal experience is exceptionally short, only providing a couple of seconds of Reeves doing what&#x27;s demanded of him in a bright white void: questioning existence, asking, &quot;How do we know what is real,&quot; which is a question that&#x27;s probably pointed at his own physical being in the trailer, a near-lifelike recreation of the well-known actor. Or else he&#x27;s messing with us, and that is actually Keanu on film. To that, I say, kudos for making me question three seconds of footage all day.
The Matrix Awakens is available now to pre-load on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. Stay tuned for more info on the experience at The Game Awards this Thursday.

                    <span>A senior executive at Sony was fired after being caught in an alleged pedophile sting video posted online. 
George Cacioppo was a senior vice president of engineering for Sony for over eight years, having worked on products such as the PlayStation Store and more. Over the weekend, the amateur pedophile-busting YouTube channel People v. Preds posted a video online that accused him of trying to meet with a 15-year-old boy. After the video began to pick up steam, Sony told CNET that Cacioppo had been fired. 
“We are aware of the situation and the employee in question has been terminated from employment,” Sony told CNET in a statement on Sunday. 
CNET attempted to contact Cacioppo via his LinkedIn profile but did not receive a comment. At the time of this writing, the former vice president of engineering has not publicly commented on the video or his subsequent termination from Sony. 
People v. Preds told Kotaku that its videos are posted online publicly rather than turned into police for an official investigation, because “the police department doesn’t work with ‘Cyber groups’ like us,” and that “that’s when the internet takes over.” However, People v. Preds also told Kotaku that “evidence has been turned into the authorities.” 
The video, which is still publicly available for viewing, shows Cacioppo in a PlayStation 5 shirt being accused by People v. Preds of trying to meet with a 15-year-old he met on Grindr. CNET says Cacioppo told the 15-year-old that his name was “Jeff” and that “Jeff” gave the teen an address for the two to meet and have sex. 
The San Diego Police Department has received People v. Preds’ evidence, but police have released no public information regarding this incident. It’s still unclear if this will developer into a case, but regardless, Cacioppo is no longer a Sony employee.

                    <span>Spider-Man: No Way Home premieres in theaters this month. If you’ve kept up with any marketing or merchandise, you already know that Peter Parker will rock a pair of new suits in the film. And when new Spidey costumes swing in, Insomniac is right there to put them into its game, Marvel’s Spider-Man, as quickly as possible. 
On December 10, Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered is getting the &quot;Black &amp; Gold&quot; suit (yes, that’s its official name, according to Marvel) and the Iron Spider-like “Integrated Suit” that seemingly has ties to Doctor Strange. Once again, these suits are only coming to the Remastered edition, the PlayStation 5 version of the 2018 game that is only available as part of Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales Ultimate Edition. You can catch some quick looks at the suits in the trailer below.

While not surprising to see, new costumes are always cool this expands Marvel’s Spider-Man roster of movie suits. It already has Tom Holland’s suits from Spider-Man: Homecoming, Far From Home, and Avengers: Infinity War/Endgame, as well as the costumes worn by Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield in their respective film series. 
Spider-Man: No Way Home hits theaters on December 17. You can watch the latest trailer here.

                    <span>An actor from HBO’s upcoming TV adaptation of The Last of Us has revealed that Nick Offerman of Parks and Recreation fame has a role in the series. 
This news comes by way of a new interview from The Guardian, which interviewed Murray Bartlett, the actor who will be playing Frank, the partner of The Last of Us’ Bill. Frank isn’t seen (alive) in the game, but he’s talked about when Joel and Ellie visit Bill in his secluded booby-trapped town. Bartlett told The Guardian that he filmed some scenes with Ron Swanson actor, Offerman, as first reported by GameSpot.

                    <span>The Marvel Cinematic Universe finally has a Daredevil and fans of the character will likely recognize the actor behind the mask. 
That’s because the performer is Charlie Cox, who portrayed the hero across three seasons of Netflix’s Daredevil series, which is technically canon to the MCU. Marvel boss Kevin Feige finally announced the news, long-rumored to be in the works, in an interview with CinemaBlend and in it, he revealed that while Cox’s casting has been announced, where we’ll first see him remains a secret. 
“If you were to see Daredevil in upcoming things, Charlie Cox, yes, would be the actor playing Daredevil,” Feige said. “Where we see that, how we see that, when we see that, remains to be seen.” 
Fans have long speculated that Cox would be returning to the role in the MCU, with some hoping he makes a more lawyer-related appearance in Marvel and Sony’s upcoming Spider-Man: No Way Home (Peter Parker is in need of a lawyer, after all, considering he’s been accused of killing Quentin Beck aka Mysterio). Perhaps that’s what Feige is alluding to – it’s also possible that the MCU hasn’t quite figured out Daredevil’s first outing, meaning Feige wouldn’t have much to say on Cox’s role in the universe just yet. 
Only time will tell, but for those who have watched Daredevil, today’s news is sure to be welcome. Daredevil is largely viewed as Netflix’s best Marvel series, in no small part due to Cox’s role as the vigilante. If you haven’t yet seen Cox as Daredevil, the entire Netflix series is worth watching. Plus, some have speculated that Kingpin, the villain throughout the Daredevil series, might be making an appearance in Marvel’s ongoing Disney+ show, Hawkeye.

                    <span>Xbox head Phil Spencer has revealed that he believes today’s Microsoft could have kept Bungie around. 
This news comes by way of Axios, which reports that Spencer understands why Bungie left Microsoft to become independent in a new interview. He also said that in today’s Xbox ecosystem, Bungie might have stayed with Microsoft. 
“Could we [keep Bungie around] today? I think we could,” Spencer told Axios when asked if Bungie’s departure was inevitable. 
Spencer said that since Bungie’s departure, Xbox has learned a lot but understands why the studio left. 
“At the time, they had big ambitions,” Spencer said. “They had sold their business for a certain amount of money. They saw what Halo turned into. And it’s like, ‘Okay, Microsoft benefited more than Bungie did from the success of Halo.’ There’s no other story that can be written there.” 
Spencer continued and said he understands the appeal of becoming independent, citing that Bungie probably felt like it had another Halo-like franchise in them. 
“If you’re saying, ‘Hey, I think I’ve got another one of those in me. I want to really take another chance,’ I can understand the allure of doing that as an independent company,” the Xbox head said.
Bungie formally split from Microsoft, with whom it had made multiple Halo games, in 2007. On October 5 of that year, Bungie announced the split and said it had become an independent company. In the division, though, Microsoft retained all rights to Halo, a franchise now developed primarily by 343 Industries.
Nearly three years later, Bungie signed onto a ten-year publishing deal with Activision, with which its popular Destiny franchise would begin. In January of 2019, the studio announced that it had ended this publishing deal early, meaning Bungie was independent once more. It seems that Bungie intends to retain its independence for now.

He also revealed that the team will give all active players and owners of Final Fantasy XIV seven days of game time for free to make up for the current queue times and congestion. This news comes after the early access release of Endwalker, which has seen players waiting hours to queue into the game. Many find themselves in the thousands in terms of their spot in queue lines, meaning there’s a large number of people that players must wait in line behind before they’re able to enter the MMO.

This news comes by way of a new blog post recently released by BioWare, as reported by GameSpot, and in it, the team reveals that it’s excited to talk about Dragon Age 4 again next year. Seeing as how The Game Awards 2021 is happening on December 9, it seems another Dragon Age 4 appearance at the annual awards show is not in the cards.

“Speaking of building new worlds and stories for you to explore, we want to let you all know that we’re still hard at work on building the next single-player focused experience for Dragon Age,” the blog post reads. “We’re excited for next year when we can talk more about what we’re working on.”
However, the blog post continues and says that BioWare has released two new short stories from the world of Dragon Age for fans to read in the meantime. Elsewhere in the blog post, the team thanked its fans for their continued support and discussed plans for Dragon Age Day, which includes new merch, a charity auction, and more. Check out the full blog post for more information about all of that. 
For more about Dragon Age 4, check out the trailer shown during The Game Awards 2020 and then take a look at this new Dragon Age 4 concept art revealed earlier this year. Read about how BioWare has confirmed that Dragon Age 4 is set in Tevinter after that.

                    <span>The answer is &quot;because he wants to&quot;.
&quot;It may sound surprising to some people that PlatinumGames is working on ,&quot; says Hideki Kamiya in an interview with Cutscenes, a YouTube channel that creates documentaries about Japanese creatives. &quot; we haven&#x27;t built the studio with the sole purpose of making action games.&quot;
Kamiya&#x27;s studio, PlatinumGames, is best known for their work on Bayonetta — a chaotic, inspired-by-the-Old-Testament hack-and-slash game about a witch in a tight-fitting jumpsuit made out of her own hair. It&#x27;s unusual to see them working on a game like Sol Cresta, a retro-style vertical shooter that &quot;bears the soul&quot; of &#x27;80s arcade games, Moon Cresta and Terra Cresta.

                    <span>It&#x27;s not Fantasy Life 2, but we&#x27;ll take it!
After Level-5&#x27;s wonderful cult classic Fantasy Life came out on 3DS, and blew us all away with its depth, heart, and charm, it was a little disappointing to find out that the sequel would be a mobile-only game called Fantasy Life Online. It was even more disappointing to find out that it was only destined for release in Japan.
However, alongside the news that Level-5 will be closing down the servers for the Japanese version of the game on December 15th, the news broke that publisher Boltrend Games picked up Fantasy Life Online for a Western release.

                    <span>The &#x27;next Switch&#x27; will need to match the current system&#x27;s all-round strengths.

When it comes to the world of entertainment technology, everyone likes to get ahead of themselves. Everything is &#x27;the next big thing&#x27;, until about a year later, that is, when it&#x27;s evident that the tech isn&#x27;t ready yet. Augmented reality and virtual reality are good examples; they&#x27;re both exciting technologies with some excellent games and a handful of major success stories, but the majority of gamers around the world are still playing on flat screens with controllers (or on touchscreens with their smartphones / tablets). There have been fantastic innovations and shifts in the market in the last five or so years but, actually, the mainstream scene continues to tick along with a lot of the same conventions.

Danganronpa Another Episode: Ultra Despair Girls was not included in the recent four-game compilation, Danganronpa Decadence, that came to Switch on December 3rd.
For the most part, it seems that fans didn&#x27;t mind — the games that were included were the more traditional, story-based ones, and Ultra Despair Girls is instead a third-person action-adventure game — but the fans who do mind may be able to change that.

                    <span>It&#x27;s not even a cube.
2021 marks the GameCube&#x27;s 20th anniversary, which means it&#x27;s already been hitting pubs in the UK for two years by now, but being the old group of sods on the video team that we are, we remember it when it was merely a proverbial babe in Nintendo&#x27;s proverbial (thankfully) arms.
At 20 Nintendo&#x27;s cuboid console hasn&#x27;t even been around for half as long as our editorial director Damien McFerran, but it&#x27;s still packing a punch in people&#x27;s minds for its wide array of incredible games and meme-worthy boot animation.

                    <span>Two Nintendo franchises are top of the Keighley tree.

Nintendo often marches to the beat of its own DK bongos, hoarding its own first-party announcements for sporadic Nintendo Direct presentations – bar one exception, that is: Geoff Keighley’s yearly awards bash, The Game Awards. Over the years we’ve seen some surprising announcements and reveals from the House of Mario at the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles, so it’s no wonder Nintendo fans anticipate a surprise or two at this year’s TGA ceremony on December 9th.

Star Wars: Hunters is an intriguing upcoming release for Switch and mobiles, a free-to-play PVP take on the iconic franchise. Its release was pushed to next year a few months back, but now developer Zynga has unveiled an official gameplay trailer to show it off.
It looks promising but emphasizes that it&#x27;s mobile footage, no doubt using the latest and most powerful hardware to show the game in its best light. With the relatively simple visuals, though, hopefully the Switch version will hold up.

Spiritfarer, the charming cosy game about ferrying spirits to the afterlife, is getting its final update this month — and it&#x27;s going to be the biggest one. According to the creative director, Nicolas Guérin, the team have &quot;saved the best for last&quot;, describing the update as &quot;a lovely curtain call for Spiritfarer as well as a great show of gratitude to the fans.&quot;
The Jackie and Daria Update will be the last free content update for the game, introducing a new island to explore, two new Spirits, a new event, and more for you to discover while playing.

The Pokémon Company has announced that Pokémon Unite, the free-to-play MOBA available on both Nintendo Switch and mobile devices, has now surpassed a whopping 50 million downloads.
After initially launching on Switch in July, the game achieved nine million downloads on Nintendo&#x27;s platform by September. In that same month, the mobile version was released, seemingly helping the game to reach huge new heights with this latest milestone.

                    <span>Changes may be coming.
Nintendo&#x27;s approach to consumer rights in the eShop has always sparked a bit of debate, in particular its approach to pre-orders and refunds. In Europe the policy of not allowing refunds on eShop pre-orders led to legal action, a case that Nintendo won pending appeal. Now, however, the German court of appeal has reversed that decision following work by the Federation of German Consumer Organisations (VZBV) and The Norwegian Consumer Council.
Nintendo had already changed its policy slightly in September 2020, allowing pre-orders more than 7 days ahead of a game&#x27;s release to be cancelled directly on the eShop or via Nintendo Account pages. For example when we tested this today, selecting a pre-order for a game out in less than 7 days showed &#x27;pre-order and purchase&#x27;, making clear that there would be no right to an immediate &#x27;voluntary right to cancel&#x27;. When you select a game more than 7 days from release you get a lengthy page explaining your right to cancel up to that point, with payment and pre-loading also held off until a week before release. This customer page explains the process for cancelling, too.

Since Disney now owns a vast selection of major pop culture properties, many of which permeate our lives on a near daily basis, it can be easy to forget the characters that make up the heart of Disney. We’re talking Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck, Goofy — remember those? In recent years, such characters have largely been tied to third party franchises like Kingdom Hearts when it comes to video games.
In Disney Magical World 2: Enchanted Edition, some of the company&#x27;s most enduring characters take centre stage in a game that feels very much like Disney’s answer to Animal Crossing. Originally released on the 3DS back in 2016, the Switch version of this sequel remains largely the same in terms of content, but the visuals have been given a nice lick of paint; you could say the game has been Enchanted… er, or remastered. Up to you.

                    <span>&quot;It&#x27;s possible that some of these combos have never actually been done before now&quot;.
Street Fighter II, as we know, got ported to a lot of machines – even ones which perhaps weren&#x27;t up to the task of actually playing the game properly, like the Game Boy.
With its monochrome display, feeble processor and two (count &#x27;em) buttons, it was far from the ideal platform to host Capcom&#x27;s cutting-edge one-on-one fighter – but that didn&#x27;t stop the Japanese company from comissioning a port, because the Game Boy market was huge.

                    <span>Throw in Just Dance 2022, too, for a very small saving.
Last week Nintendo UK dropped a handful of Switch hardware bundles which included Ring Fit Adventure and a Switch, plus additional games. This week it looks like Amazon UK is getting in on the action, too.
Amazon UK&#x27;s base deal is the same — £309.99 for a Switch and a Ring Fit Adventure digital download code, plus the required Ring-Con controller and leg strap — and there&#x27;s also a second bundle which throws in Just Dance 2022. You know, just in case Ring Fit doesn&#x27;t tire you out and you&#x27;ve still got some energy to dance with pandas.

                    <span>Could it be launching sooner than we think?
Last year saw the entire BioShock series (well, its mainline games, at least) arrive on Nintendo Switch, introducing a whole new wave of players to a franchise widely considered to be one of the best in the single-player shooter genre. If you&#x27;re one of the many who picked up the series on Nintendo&#x27;s platform and are eager to see what&#x27;s next, you&#x27;ll want to read on.
In a recent Sacred Symbols podcast, journalist Colin Moriarty shares details on &#x27;BioShock 4&#x27;, the unofficial name for the next title in the series. He claims that developer Cloud Chamber is aiming for a 2022 release and that the game will take place in a fictional Antarctic city during the 1960s – UK news outlet VGC claims to have heard similar.

                    <span>It&#x27;s a lot of Fortnite.
Fortnite remains a behemoth of a video game, available on almost all conceivable hardware and continually building its world through events, lore and seasonal reboots. It&#x27;s now live with its latest major update, taking us into Chapter 3.
The summary trailer at the top of the article gives a good overview and it introduces a &#x27;flipped&#x27; island that is effectively an all-new location. The new chapter notably beefs up and emphasizes squad-based co-op features, such as setting up camps to replenish supplies between battles. In terms of gameplay there&#x27;s a slide that reminds us of the equivalent in Apex Legends, and an option to swing around like Spider-Man.

And not only because of the bugs.

                    <span>If you&#x27;re bored of Halo Infinite&#x27;s usual multiplayer modes playlist, there&#x27;s a sneaky way you might be able to gain access to more on PC. A player has discovered that if you boot the game offline you can look through and save 14 hidden modes that aren&#x27;t yet available in the online game, including a new mode named Attrition, as well as a bunch of Fiesta and Tactical variants.

                    <span>Buying a new mouse is about more than how accurate it is or how many buttons it has. It&#x27;s about finding a mouse that&#x27;s the right fit for your hand. You don&#x27;t want to be cramping up your fingers trying to grip a mouse that&#x27;s too small or big, or struggling with a shape that&#x27;s isn&#x27;t designed for your dominant hand. The feel of a mouse is as important as the fit, too. You&#x27;re obviously going to be touching it a lot, so you want something with a comfortable texture and a click that feels right beneath your precious little fingers.

                    <span>The original Elex was divisive, to say the least. It was a game in which I was perpetually lonely and confused and being battered to death by carcinogenic poultry, but it must have been a profitable enough venture on its own terms to warrant a follow-up. That follow-up is Elex II, which is still several months away from release right now, but one I&#x27;ve been playing an early preview build of recently, showing off the first chapter of the game.
I was talking to Graham (RPS in peace) about this and he said: &quot;Eventually one of these RPG sci-fi fantasy things will get close enough to being a BioWare game that it makes loads of money.&quot; This being the games equivalent of monkeys and typewriters. But although I agreed with Graham at the time, I think comparing it to BioWare might be mistaking the particular appeal of Elex II. It would be too simple to say that I &quot;enjoyed&quot; the hours I have spent with it so far. I didn&#x27;t not enjoy it. I mostly came away respecting it for how little it respected me. Like the popular kids on the playground making life so difficult for you that you wish to become best friends with them.

                    <span>It&#x27;s easy to underestimate the nuances of buying a new keyboard, but it isn&#x27;t as simple as finding one that&#x27;s got all 26 letters on it. Whether you want lightning fast keystrokes to get the edge in multiplayer gaming, a fantastic-feeling keypress for a more tactile experience, or an RGB lightshow that makes your desk look like it&#x27;s hosting a tiny rock concert, there&#x27;s are many different factors to consider when investing in a new letter-rectangle.

Oh, the perils of popularity! Sharing a status update over the weekend, game director Naoki Yoshida apologised again for the problems, and said they plan to give all active subscribers seven days of free game time.

The game&#x27;s island flipped over too, revealing a whole new map for players to explore in Chapter 3 Season 1. And I find myself being lured in by two new features I usually adore in games: sliding on your knees while shooting, and swinging around like Spider-Man.

This year, BioWare got involved too, releasing new short stories and hosting charity streams. They also took the opportunity to remind fans that Dragon Age 4 is still on the way, confirming that it&#x27;ll be singleplayer. Don&#x27;t get your hopes up for Game Awards news though, because it sounds like we won&#x27;t hear any more about it until 2022.

                    <span>The breakout novelty simulator this year for me is Powerwash Simulator, a game about methodically moving your mouse over the surface of objects to blast away grime and rust with a murderously strong stream of water. It&#x27;s not a chaotic system like Viscera Cleanup Detail, it&#x27;s just a game where you slowly make something dirty all sparkling clean. Very chill. Now you can unwind with your pals and clean cars, toilets, fairground rides, and the rest together, thanks to the online co-op added in a recent update.

                    <span>Driving around with three snipers in the back of your jeep is overkill. But the shiny soldier boy of the Halo games has never cared less. This is the prime indulgence of Halo Infinite, the latest of the venerable sci-fi shootybangs. Sweet moments where it&#x27;s just you, an open country of undulating hillsides, and a truck full of trigger-happy marines. The developers have taken the eponymous second level of the first Halo, in which the big tin fella had to drive about helping his marooned space crew, and they&#x27;ve used it as a mood board for an entire game. Aside from a few gripes, it has worked splendidly.

Spider-Man is joining the Battle Royale, and he&#x27;s bringing his web-swinging techniques with him. Players can play as the Wall Crawler in three suits: his classic red and blue comic-book look, the white Future Foundation suit, or his symbiotic black alternate.

Update 12/4/21 4:00 p.m. Central: *SPOILERS AHEAD* Fortnite&#x27;s Chapter 2 finale titled &quot;The End&quot; has come and passed. Watch the video above to see the exciting climax featuring Jonesy and The Foundation. The island as we all know it has changed forever. Well, it&#x27;s still there, just flipped or rotated. In the meantime, we&#x27;re stranded in the ocean, left to await whatever adventures lie on the newly-inverted landmass, and what role The Foundation (now double confirmed to be Dwayne Johnson!) will play moving forward.
Original Story: Epic Games is ending Fortnite&#x27;s second chapter sooner than expected. On December 4 at 4 p.m. ET, the Cube Queen is waging war against all of the combatants on the Island in a new limited event called &quot;The End.&quot;
This event is a one-time instance, meaning you won&#x27;t be able to play it again after you complete it. Epic recommends content creators and players record their playthrough as it will be the only way to see it again.
The End allows for groups of up to 16 players to queue together. Friends can get together 30 minutes before the event begins. This current season is ending a day earlier than Epic originally announced, so anyone who logs in now between December 4 will receive a 225,000 XP reward. Players who compete in The End event will earn a themed loading screen and wrap. From November 26 to 29, Epic is holding a power-leveling weekend with supercharged XP to help players complete the battle pass.

What comes next is anyone&#x27;s guess. Epic will likely continue on with Chapter 3 and a new theme. We know Boba Fett is coming to the game, and there are rumors that The Matrix will be involved as well.

                    <span>The first season of Game Informer’s Video Gameography explores the history of the Metroid series. This week, we&#x27;re tackling the franchise&#x27;s most reviled – or misunderstood – entry: Metroid: Other M. 
Released for the Wii on August 31, 2010, Metroid: Other M saw Nintendo pass the development reins to Team Ninja, the studio most famous for the 3D Ninja Gaiden games. With a new developer came a drastic new vision for the series. A considerable emphasis on narrative gave Samus her first real speaking role (and boy does she talk) and the tale fleshed out her past life with the Galactic Federation.  We&#x27;ll examine this polarizing narrative along with the development decisions behind Other M&#x27;s blend of 2D and 3D gameplay.  
Join hosts Ben Reeves (@BenjaminReeves), Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), and special guest, MinnMax cohort and former GI editor Kyle Hilliard (@KyleMHilliard) as we unpack the history and lore of Metroid: Other M. Is it as lousy history has led us to believe? Tune in to get our takes.

                    <span>Added to the in-development Linux 5.16 kernel was cluster-aware scheduling designed to enhance system performance where groups of CPU cores may share caches or similar and thus the scheduler could benefit from knowing that information for making more optimal task placement. But as I pointed out early on with Linux 5.16, this cluster scheduling is hurting the Intel Alder Lake performance on the new kernel. Intel is now working to correct this by making the cluster scheduling configurable and disabling this functionality by default for hybrid CPUs  such as Alder Lake...</span>

                    <span>A side effect of fatherhood is that I now see everything through my five-year-old&#x27;s eyes. Hot Wheels Unleashed is, to me, most likely a middling racing game and lesser Trackmania - but then, if I think about it, I know my kid would love it.

Hot Wheels Unleashed&#x27;s Batman expansion, featuring a handful of cars and a Batcave? To me, meaningless licensed tie-in. But my kid... My kid must never know this exists.

                    <span>It feels at times as if, over a long enough timeline, all first-person shooters trend towards becoming the same game by cribbing modes from one another. Case in point: Quake now has a horde mode. It comes as part of a new update for Quake Remastered, Bethesda&#x27;s recent spit-and-polish of the classic 3D shooter. The horde mode is made by MachineGames for 1-4 players - and the update also includes a new (or &quot;new&quot;) singleplayer add-on.

When I do decide to head down Mexico way, I&#x27;ll get a better experience for having waited. Playground Games&#x27; second patch for the game went live this week, bringing tons of fixes.

Next up: a bundle of 66 games on Itch.io. Are you big hard-drived enough to let A Good Snowman Is Hard To Build, Old Man&#x27;s Journey, Lieve Oma, A Normal Lost Phone, Secrets Of Raetikon, Cosmic Express, Fugl, Botanicula, Hacknet, The Stillness Of The Wind, The Hex - *deep breath* - Art Sqool, Hidden Folks, Cloud Gardens, Signs Of The Sojourner, Wide Ocean Big Jacket, Coffee Talk, Ynglet and many more onto your computer?

Go on, have a heart. It&#x27;ll cost $5 and 100% of the money goes to the World Land Trust.

They&#x27;re now sending out a new wave of dev kits to creators, and as part of that they&#x27;re also testing their final packaging. That includes the neat-looking case pictured above.

A shock indeed. There are at least a few of us left, walking up and down the halls looking for something to do. Maybe we&#x27;ll find some games to play! Who knows? It is my eternal hope, at least.

                    <span>After playing around with cards and mechanics exclusive to Magic: The Gathering Arena, Wizards of the Coast is expanding into supporting a new digital-only format called Alchemy. This new format and everything that comes with it will launch on December 9. 
Alchemy is built on the Standard format and its yearly rotation of sets. That means when the time comes for a year&#x27;s worth of cards to drop out of Standard, they will lose legality in Alchemy as well. However, a pool of new, Arena exclusive cards will be added a few weeks after each Standard-legal set launches, meaning we&#x27;ll see new batches of digital cards every few months. Players will find these via Alchemy booster packs or by cashing in wildcards like any other card in Arena. Our first Alchemy infusion will play off of the most recen…</span>

                    <span>343 Industries is preparing for the launch of the Halo Infinite campaign next week, but it’s also kept multiplayer feedback and improvements as one of its top priorities. 
The team recently updated its multiplayer progression system to give players increased XP for the first six matches of any given day in response to calls from the community for battle pass progression to be sped up. Another popular ask from the community involves playlists, or specifically, the lack of dedicated free-for-all and SWAT playlists, amongst others such as a Slayer playlist.

                    <span>I’ve played a lot of Halo Infinite since its free-to-play multiplayer suite launched during the Xbox 20th Anniversary Celebration last week. Coincidentally, I’ve also watched way too much TikTok since then. It’s a real problem I’m dealing with right now. In-between the cooking tutorials and cursed comedy sketches populating my For You page, I’ve stumbled upon several Halo Infinite multiplayer tips that positively affected my knowledge and skill.
In the spirit of Thanksgiving – and being the generous person I am – I’d like to give back to the gaming community by sharing a curated list of the best videos I’ve watched while doom-scrolling this hellscape of a social media app.

                    <span>Sony is reportedly working on an Xbox Game Pass competitor that will include three tiers of service and essentially see PlayStation Plus and PlayStation Now merge. 
This news comes by way of a new Bloomberg report that says the service will be subscription-based, much like Sony&#x27;s current Plus and Now offerings and of course, Xbox Game Pass. The service, currently code-named Spartacus, will let PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 owners pay a monthly fee for access to a catalog of both modern and classic games.

The subscription will be spread across three different tiers and Bloomberg’s report says the first (and cheapest) tier will basically be what players get with PlayStation Plus at the moment. The second tier will open players up to a larger library of PlayStation 4 games and eventually PlayStation 5 games. The third tier would include the services of the first two tiers and access to “extended game demos, game streaming, and a library of classic PS1, PS2, PS3, and PSP games,” Bloomberg writes. 
Bloomberg’s report points towards Spartacus releasing in Spring, which is also when PlayStation Plus and Now will be merged. Sony reportedly plans to keep Plus’ branding around after the new service is out, but Now will be phased out. One important thing to note is that Bloomberg says the documentation it reviewed revealed that details on the service have yet to be finalized so there’s a chance things could change between now and its supposed Spring release. 
While waiting to learn more about Spartacus, be sure to check out the December PlayStation Plus lineup.

                    <span>Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy, the Naughty Dog-developed platformer that spawned two sequels and multiple spinoffs, is now 20 years old, and to celebrate the anniversary, Sony has rounded up some retrospective thoughts from Naughty Dog devs and other PlayStation studio leads. 
Hitting PlayStation 2 on December 3, 2001, The Precursor Legacy is officially 20 years old, and as noted by Sony Interactive Entertainment content communications manager, Tim Turi, who wrote today’s PlayStation Blog post, it marks an interesting point for Naughty Dog. Today, Naughty Dog is best known for Uncharted and The Last of Us, but before those two franchises, their bread and butter was Jak and Daxter, the series the studio developed after its bout of Crash Bandicoot games.

This news comes by way of Eurogamer, which reports that Hazelight has indeed abandoned its trademark for “It Takes Two,” but remains hopeful as a studio that a resolution will be reached. The publication’s report indicates that Take-Two filed a trademark claim against Hazelight shortly after It Takes Two was released. Records show that Hazelight then abandoned ownership of the name.

                    <span>Developer One-O-One Games and Meta Publishing have pulled the curtain back on Aftermath, a new survival horror game coming next year. Players control an astronaut who returns to Earth after a mission only to find the planet upended by an alien invasion.
After a botched reentry to Earth, protagonist Charlie Gray finds herself alone, emotionally broken, but driven by a singular mission to locate her missing daughter. She’s up against an intimidating extraterrestrial menace, specifically an invisible hunter tracking her every move. Charlie must outwit this foe to survive while also confronting more in-your-face threats such as shambling corpse-like creatures in over-the-shoulder third-person combat. Charlie may not be a soldier, but she is a brilliant engineer, using those skills to concoct blueprints for tools by examining everyday objects. Think of her like a McGyver. As a survival game, managing Charlie’s nutrition, hydration, and mental health are vital.

Aftermath’s foreboding presentation and atmosphere come courtesy of artist Alessandro Bavari, art designer for Alien: Covenant. The soundtrack boasts original tracks from artists such as Unkle, Planet Funk, and others. 
If Aftermath piques your interest, keep an eye out when it launches in 2022 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC.

New skins are likely a welcome addition to the online FPS, but some fans on the official Battlefield 2042 subreddit voiced their concern that a “Father Winter” skin for one of the specialists was a step too far – fans fear these skins indicate that 2042 will head in the route of Call of Duty: Warzone, which includes skins from Saw, Donnie Darko, and other less-serious cosmetics. The concern amongst fans is that 2042 is a more serious shooter compared to Warzone where skins similar to “Father Winter” might appear. You can see some of the supposed leaked skins below, courtesy of Battlefield Bulletin on Twitter.

Revealed on Twitter, the company released a trailer for the Nintendo 64 game, sharing that it will join the Switch’s online games service next week on December 10. However, because it’s an N64 game, not all Online users will have access to it as you must be subscribed to the Expansion Pack version of the service to play it.

                    <span>It&#x27;s the launch of a new MMO expansion, and you know what that means: queues. Early access to Final Fantasy XIV&#x27;s Endwalker expansion kicked off today and players are reporting hours-long waits, frequent errors and more while trying to join servers.

In a forum post, Endwalker&#x27;s developers say that the game&#x27;s surge in popularity over the past year means that they&#x27;re expecting &quot;a number of logins that is yet to be seen since the launch of FFXIV,&quot; but that the global semiconductor shortage means they can&#x27;t fix the issue.

                    <span>The Last Night was announced at E3 2017 to great excitement, before that excitement was cut short the same day by the re-emergence of pro-Gamergate tweets made by creator Tim Soret in 2014.

The cinematic pixel art platformer has been quiet almost ever since, but rumours began circling this week that it would resurface at the Game Awards later this month. Not so, says Soret. &quot;It will be shown next year, not before,&quot; he told PC Gamer.

As part of the changes, Vince Zampella - co-founder of Respawn, developers of Apex Legends - is now overseeing the Battlefield franchise, and Marcus Lehto (best known for Halo) is building a new studio to create narrative experiences within the series.

                    <span>It’s been a little over 9 months since Fights In Tight Spaces first released on to Steam Early Access, and as of December 2nd, it’s kicked open the door and walked into a full release. It’s a unique combination of deck-building and turn-based strategy, presented in satisfying and stylish 3D animation. Sort of Superhot meets Slay The Spire. 


  In Fights In Tight Spaces, you play as an anonymous secret agent with the aim of assassinating bosses, while moving through the game&#x27;s multiple chapters. On the way to each boss are several smaller encounters, which act as opportunities for you to get some practice in. You take turns planning the best way to take out roomfuls of enemies, and eventually upgrade your skills and continue the cycle.

                    <span>I hate to caveat a recommendation with “it gets good later” but unfortunately, the first hour of Chorus (despite the title stylisation, promotional materials do not write it out as Chorvs, cowards) is not good. Yet beyond that lacklustre start is a surprisingly tight arcade space fighter wrapped up in a wonderful bundle of pompous space magic.

It&#x27;s a game I have very fond memories of, and publisher Dotemu&#x27;s latest dev diary about the soundtrack for the upcoming remake has cast me right back to those glorious, if rather futile afternoons spent staring at my parent&#x27;s living room computer. Musician Louis Godart is recreating the original game&#x27;s music from scratch for Pharaoh: A New Era, but he&#x27;s also adding some authentic touches of his own to help do those classic tunes justice.

                    <span>If you weren’t satisfied with only three DLC packs to play with in the hybrid metroidvania roguelike Dead Cells, don’t worry. The teams over at Motion Twin and Evil Empire have got your back. The latest DLC, The Queen And The Sea, has been teased with a tiny new trailer.
The Queen And The Sea is currently planned for a release early next year. It&#x27;s described as the largest update to Dead Cells yet, and is designed as an ending to the route started by the two previous DLCs (The Bad Seed and Fatal Falls). I think it’s going for more of a The Lighthouse vibe, and not so much The Little Mermaid. You can take a look at the new teaser trailer below.

                    <span>Neon Giant&#x27;s first DLC update for The Ascent is out now. They say the Cybersec Pack’s contents include “two new weapons, a new tactical, four new pieces of armor and four new animated weapon skins.” They’ve also put together a new trailer showing off these features, which you can take a look at below.


That&#x27;s pretty much it when it comes to the DLC pack, but along with it, Neon Giant have also dropped a new patch for The Ascent too. This is the fifth patch for the game since its initial launch near the end of July 2021. This one includes fixes for various crashes, increases to the stability in co-op play, improvements to the audio, as well as other miscellaneous changes. 


The patch also adds a new feature called Transmogrification, which you’re probably familiar with if you’ve played games like Destiny 2 or World Of Warcraft. In the words of Neon Giant, this’ll allow players to “change their appearance to match the visual style of any armour currently in their inventory by visiting the Stylist and paying a small fee.” Once that’s done, you can equip any armour you want, and your character’s look won’t change.

                    <span>Americká FTC (Federal Trade Commision) zkoumala dva týdny prodej společnosti ARM firmě NVIDIA. Výsledek je, že FTC podá na transakci žalobu. Hlasování ve čtvrtek dopadlo 4:0 ve prospěch žaloby, tedy jak dva demokratičtí tak i dva republikánští zástupci v komisi byli proti prodeji.</span>

Techland&#x27;s most recent episode of its video series Dying 2 Know shows off 15 minutes of gameplay and has an extra surprise at the end, which will be spoiled here, I guess. It&#x27;s free games!
Senior producer Kornel Jaskuła sets up the footage (at the 4:36 mark in the video above), which starts with protagonist Aiden Caldwell and his associate Lowain, played by Rosario Dawson, celebrating The City&#x27;s power roaring back to life before suddenly shutting back down. From there, you&#x27;ll see plenty of what I&#x27;m now calling &quot;the Five P&#x27;s of Dying Light 2 Stay Human&quot;: Parkour, Paragliding, Politicking, Powering structures, and Popping zombies in the mouth with a lethal weapon ... It&#x27;s not a perfect mnemonic. It covers a mission titled &quot;A Place to Call Home&quot; that shows off plenty of traversal, fighting, NPC interactions, and how your choices affect The City, its residents, and Aiden&#x27;s relationships.
At the tail end of the broadcast, it&#x27;s announced that Techland is celebrating its 30th anniversary, and it&#x27;s the one giving out the gifts! Starting today on GOG, you can pick up a $0.00 copy of 2001&#x27;s Crime Cities, and next week Steam will be harboring a complimentary copy of Call of Juarez: Gunslinger to add to your library.
For more in-depth, hands-on impressions of Dying Light 2, please see your way to this New Gameplay Today and Brian Shea&#x27;s piece on his time at the game&#x27;s recent preview event.</span>

                    <span>The Stanley Parable is as unique and humorous today as when it launched way back in 2013. However, during the 2018 Game Awards, fans were treated to the announcement that an expanded version of the game, The Stanley Parable Ultra Deluxe, would arrive in 2019. It&#x27;s now 2021, though developers Davey Wreden and Crows Crows Crows have always been the first to admit that window may have been wishful thinking. But after three years and a few sassy trailer updates, the game appears to be ready to ship – for real this time (hopefully).
Crow Crows Crows announced on Twitter that The Stanley Parable Ultra Deluxe is now content complete and is prepping to release it to consoles and PC in early 2022. This marks the first time the game will be available on consoles, though there’s still no mention of specific platforms. The game’s website only states the intention to release it to all platforms, basically.

For those who missed the boat in 2013, you may be asking, “what exactly is The Stanley Parable?”. Good question, and unfortunately, it’s one of those games that’s best experienced as blindly as possible. But if you really need to know what you’re playing before committing cash to it (fair), you can read our review of the original game here.
Are you a Stanley Parable fan looking to revisit the experience with Ultra Deluxe? Are you diving in for the first time to see what the fuss has been all these years? Let us know in the comments!</span>

                    <span>Quake, which was re-released for modern consoles and PC back in August, is receiving even more love from the devs at Bethesda and Wolfenstein developer Machine Games with a new mode and content added with Update 2.
Out today on all platforms, Update 2 brings a host of big fixes, but most importantly, an entirely new Horde Mode. Developed by the team at Machine Games, Quakes Horde Mode pits teams of 1-4 local or online players (or bots!) against swarms of AI enemies on four brand new horde maps. Every third wave of baddies will include a boss which coughs up a silver key which can be cashed in to collect more weapons and items, bolstering your arsenal for further battles.

Also included in Update 2 is an add-on called Honey where you&#x27;ll &quot;delve deep into the darkness to conquer a deadly plague infecting the land.&quot; It&#x27;s a new Quake experience authored by senior level designer Christian Grawer from Machine Games.
Quake is making its Epic Games Store debut today, as well. Pick it up there if EGS is your PC game launcher of choice. You can find the full contents of Update 2 here.

                    <span>Moss is one of the better received PlayStation VR games, and Moss: Book II continues the adventure of Quill next spring. A new trailer gives a sneak peek at the journey that lies ahead for our diminutive heroine. 
Quill has hatched a plan to bring down the Arcane’s violent rule, but she’s being hunted by a winged foe. As she explores the castle that held her uncle Argus captive in the first game, she’ll encounter friends new and old while also solving devious puzzles and cutting down obstacles with her trusty sword.

                    <span>Platformers used to be a dominant gaming genre, but today they often feel like a relic of a bygone era. Even so, 2021 has seen the release of several stellar platformers. If you’re looking for a game that will challenge your hand-eye coordination and jumping skills, then look no further than this list. The following games all share common elements but carve a unique path in the genre.

                    <span>Battlefield 2042 had quite the rocky start when it launched just a few weeks ago, mainly regarding bugs that plagued the experience for many players. Recent updates, such as Update 3, which was revealed yesterday, indicate that EA is committed to improving the 2042 experience. Now, new shake-ups at the company provide further evidence that EA is doubling down on Battlefield as a core franchise. 
In a new report by GameSpot, these shake-ups and changes are detailed, including news that Respawn Entertainment lead Vince Zampella, the person currently in charge of Apex Legends and other studio projects, is now the head of Battlefield. In this new position, Zampella will manage both his Respawn projects and serve as the overall boss of Battlefield.

                    <span>The new expansion for Kingdoms of Amalur: Re-Reckoning, Fatesworn, will be released this month. 
More specifically, Fatesworn will hit PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on December 14, and it will be available for $19.99. Oddly enough, despite Amalur being available on the Switch, THQ Nordic’s press release about today’s Fatesworn news doesn’t mention the Switch when it comes to platforms for the expansion.

“This year on December 14, the journey of the Fateless One continues,” THQ Nordic’s press release reads. “After the Crystal War has been fought and Gadlow has been defeated, the people of Amalur were hoping for peace to return to their lands. And although peace has indeed come to Amalur, rumors of a new threat are starting to spread, rising in the far west, the icy lands of Mithros. None other than Telogrus, the God of Chaos himself has awoken and is gathering followers to throw the whole world into chaos.” 
THQ Nordic says Fatesworn adds a whole new storyline to Amalur, a new environment to explore, multiple new quests and missions, new Chaos Realm dungeons, extra gameplay mechanics, more weapons and armor, never-before-seen enemies, and more. It will also raise the level cap of Amalur to 50 and it features a new soundtrack by composer Grant Kirkhope.
You must own the base Kingdoms of Amalur: Re-Reckoning in order to purchase and play Fatesworn, which will be out on December 14. Perhaps more interesting than the content of Fatesworn is the fact that it’s an expansion for a game that came out 10 years ago. That’s quite unheard of in games, especially single-player ones. For more about the game, check out the Game Informer Kingdoms of Amalur: Re-Reckoning hub.

                    <span>Microsoft&#x27;s surprise launch of the Halo Infinite multiplayer beta has been warmly received by many of us at Game Informer. It&#x27;s all I&#x27;ve been playing the last few weeks, and I can&#x27;t wait to jump back in. I&#x27;ll be joined today by Alex Van Aken, Wesley LeBlanc, and returning guest Jesse Vitelli (Prima Games) to duke it out in Team Slayer, Capture the Flag, and hopefully a little Oddball. 
Many rockets will be fired! Grenades will also be thrown! We&#x27;re hoping a few of them hit their targets. Knowing this crew, they definitely will. At 2 p.m. CT, the Game Informer crew is suiting up for our third round of Halo Infinite multiplayer, and you can watch the mayhem unfold exclusively on Twitch.

                    <span>Cyberpunk 2077 might not be at the forefront of games news like it was almost a year ago, but it’s still making waves as players await 2022’s next-gen overhaul and expansion content. CD Projekt Red’s futuristic adventure was even nominated in the Best RPG category at this year’s Game Awards show. So, what’s next? More merch, of course. CDPRgear and Blonie Watches have teamed up to bring a stunning (and very expensive) watch to Cyberpunk fans everywhere. In addition to a bevy of other cutting-edge features that I’ll elaborate on below, the pricey accessory uses blockchain technology to prevent counterfeiting.

                    <span>Since the reveal of The Foundation, a character critical to Fortnite Chapter 2’s ongoing overarching narrative, fans have speculated on who it might be. The number one theory links The Foundation to Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, and for good reason – the character’s armor features a design that matches up nicely with Johnson’s tattoos. 
We were all but confident that Johnson was The Foundation, but the actor’s new Twitter video today seems to finally confirm the role. Oddly enough, it comes by way of a ZOA energy drink ad in which Johnson is seen talking about ZOA while using words that match up with Fortnite – zero point, higher ground, foundation, and the universe, to name a few.

Then, as you can see above, he reaches into a fridge to grab a ZOA, and lo and behold, The Foundation’s helmet is sitting there. Of course, Johnson ignores it – cheeky – but then he returns right to using some Fortnite-centric words again. The tweet that accompanies his video also says “#ifyouknowyouknow” with a robotic arm beside it, so...uhh yeah, Johnson is The Foundation – we smell what you’re cooking. 
The timing of this reveal is curious, too – Fortnite Chapter 3 is right around the corner. Perhaps The Foundation is primed to take on a more significant role in the battle royale’s story. Maybe we’ll hear Johnson’s voice as The Foundation in Chapter 3. Only time will tell for now. 
While waiting to learn more, check out this trailer that shows Fortnite Chapter 2 is coming to an end before Chapter 3 launches sometime soon. Check out Game Informer’s Fornite review after that, and then give Game Informer’s list of all Marvel and DC characters in Fortnite a look.

Rei awakens, dazed and confused within the Ultravoid. She’s a voidrunner, meaning she explores black holes with the help of advanced technology. Unfortunately, the Ultravoid is an exceptionally massive black hole with Rei’s home planet ensnared in its vacuum. Time is of the essence; Rei was sent into the Void as part of a team to activate the Starseed, a device designed to collapse the black hole and save her planet. But her allies have vanished, and the Ultravoid has native defenses in the form of ink-like monsters. With dire stakes and Hail Mary solutions, Rei’s solo mission is worth seeing t…</span>

                    <span>With the release of Sora back in October, the Super Smash Bros. Ultimate roster was finally complete, and now, the game’s balance tuning is also complete after a new update that’s now live. 
First reported by Kotaku, Nintendo revealed on Twitter that the latest Ultimate balance update, Ver. 13.0.1 has been distributed and will be “the last update related to the balance adjustments of the game.” However, Nintendo said that other updates might happen to fix problems related to Ultimate. Director Masahiro Sakura also used this update to give thanks to everyone involved. 
バランス調整もこれで完了です。調整関係者各位、おつかれさまでした。
https://t.co/10X7YREOnJ
December 2, 2021
“Balance adjustment is now complete,” Sakurai writes on Twitter. “Thank you to everyone involved in the coordination. The fighters used in the top-ranked battles and the average online win rate are all different, so I think this is a generally desirable distribution.” 
The actual update features nearly 60 changes to character moves, spanning 24 different fighters. There are damage increases, speed boosts, animation length changes, and much more. You can check out the full update patch notes here. As noted by Kotaku, there are quite a handful of buffs – more buffs than nerfs, even – so many of your favorite fighters are probably feeling a touch stronger than usual. 
For more about Ultimate, check out our thoughts on it in Game Informer’s Super Smash Bros. Ultimate review and then read about how Nintendo has partnered with Panda Global for new Ultimate and Melee tournaments. Check out this story about how Sakurai is not currently thinking about a sequel to Ultimate but won’t rule one out just yet.</span>

                    <span>Halo Infinite’s full release is just around the corner, and several players have already taken a liking to its free-to-play multiplayer mode. One player, in particular, named “Sakana,” posted a ridiculous clip (seen below) to Twitter, showcasing the stopping power of one of the franchise’s most popular rifles. With one sniper bullet, 23 players are eliminated in mere seconds. 
23人抜きスナイパー　#HaloInfinite pic.twitter.com/AjCoGewbL1
November 30, 2021
Impressive, right? Sure, Sakana got a bunch of buddies to stand single-file, but the results are still cool as hell. Watching the kill-points increase and the red-hued damage indicator flash per each downed Spartan is pretty satisfying. The only highlight that could top this would be if 23 players somehow lined up inadvertently in the middle of a standard multiplayer match. Let’s see how many people load into big team battles in the hopes of achieving this legendary feat. Trust me, you’re more likely to get a 23-player killing spree by playing the game mode normally. 
This isn’t the only wild thing that people have done in Halo Infinite. We’ve seen players grapple the vehicle bumpers as if wakeboarding … but without the board. We’ve learned that Spartans can lob fusion coils with NFL-level arm strength. The list goes on and on and will likely extend to Infinite’s single-player mode when it releases on December 8 for Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC. 
If you’re a Halo fanatic like we are, be sure to enter the Swarovski sweepstakes for this crystallized Master Chief helmet and energy sword. And if you’re not an Xbox Games Pass member, then you’re missing out as Ultimate subscribers are slated to get access to monthly multiplayer bonuses.  Those’ll go nicely with the extra six-match XP that 343 Industries implemented in its latest Halo update. 
That 23-player killing spree was nuts, right? Let us know what other zany stunts you’ve seen in the latest Halo installment!</span>

                    <span>As much as I enjoy your Call Of Dutys and Valorants, I just don’t think any multiplayer shooter will eclipse Gears Of War. For me, at least, it comes down to movement. The way the beefy boys slide into cover and bounce off it with ease. The side-steps and strafes in those tight-knit shotgun battles.
Recently, I wondered if there was more to my connection with Gears and its lovely movement. And then it struck me: badminton. Yes, the racquet sport I’ve played for 19 years and consider an immensely important aspect of my life. Turns out they have quite a lot in common, actually.

                    <span>The release of the new live-action Cowboy Bebop reminded me just how much I love the show, and how hard it is to find anything remotely like it. I think it’s just because of how eclectic the show is. It’s got so many different influences, ranging from Chinese action films to space operas to even the Western. It’s rare to see something with the same tone, because of how many things compose its DNA.

                    <span>Let me start out by immediately apologising to our podcast editor Alix for the fact that this best cars in games episode of The Electronic Wireless Show Podcast does not mention the Regalia from Final Fantasy XV. Mea culpa. But that glaring mistake aside, we do have a bit of a chat about Forza Horizon 5, and other good cars in games and car games in general. I balance out not talking about the Regalia by not mentioning any vehicles from the Mass Effect games.
We also have a very good Cyberpunk-themed Cavern Of Lies courtesy of Matthew, who has no updates on his Olympic feud this week, but does reaveal (during a long digression about whether or not we, personally, can drive) that it took him nine goes to pass his driving test. Nine honestly seems a bit excessive.

                    <span>If you fancy some cyberpunk ninja action to spice up your new year, Ghostrunner is getting a new DLC on January 27th. Project_Hel will let players take control of Hel, one of the game&#x27;s original bosses, as she heads out on her own quest. I hope it&#x27;s evil. I like seeing what antagonists get up to in their free time.

To celebrate Halo Infinite&#x27;s release, as well as Halo&#x27;s 20th anniversary, Xbox have collaborated with Swarovski to make the Halo-themed crystals that fans can win via a sweepstakes or charity campaign. You can&#x27;t buy them. I don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;d want to? They look very expensive.

                    <span>It’s the last day of Qualcomm’s Snapdragon Tech Summit 2021, and it saved the biggest announcement for the end. The company has developed a suite of new technologies designed specifically for the mobile gaming space, called the Snapdragon G3x Gen 1 Gaming Platform. On top of this, it has teamed up with Razer to create a handheld dev kit powered by the new chipset in the hopes that developers will produce tailor-made experiences for the device.
What does that mean? The Steam Deck might have some handheld competition before long, as Qualcomm is aspiring to jump into the market with this Android-based product.

                    <span>Halo marketing is pretty much always top-notch, and the marketing campaign behind Halo Infinite is no different. Just yesterday, 343 released a new (and very hype) Halo Infinite campaign trailer, and today, Swarovski – yes, the famed crystal maker – revealed two new Halo Infinite-inspired crystal figurines. 
As part of its Swarovski x Halo Collectibles collection, the company has created a crystal Master Chief Helmet, complete with a yellow-tinted visor, and a crystal Energy Sword, as reported by GameSpot. You can check out both below:

“In celebration of the game’s 20th anniversary and the launch of Halo Infinite, Xbox and Swarovski step into the epic sci-fi universe with two collectible crystal figurines,” Swarovski’s website reads. “A unique collaboration for both brands that serves as a reminder of what self-discovery and imagination can do. Created in an extremely limited-edition run, only the bold will reap their rewards. Enter your information below for a chance to win one of 117 [we see what you did there] Swarovski x Halo collectibles.” 
As mentioned above, Swarovski is not selling these (we don’t even want to know what the price tag would be), and the only way to get your hands on one of 117 of these crystal figures is to enter the company’s drawing. You can register for that on the Swarovski site. 
While waiting to see if you win one of these crystal figurines, read about how Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers will get monthly Halo Infinite multiplayer bonuses starting next week and then read about how a new change in multiplayer makes it so that players earn increased XP for the first six matches played on any given day. Check out the best Halo Infinite multiplayer tips we’ve learned from watching TikToks after that.

                    <span>Battlefield 2042 launched just a few weeks ago, and if the conversation surrounding it can be summarized by one word, that word is “bugs.” 
Game Informer’s own reviewer said 2042 is “an otherwise solid online shooter bogged down by an abundance of bugs,” and that’s a sentiment echoed across the entire battlefield discourse. To EA and DICE’s credit, though, the team behind the game has been open about the things it needs to fix, and Update 3, which hits the game tomorrow, is another example of that.

                    <span>Respawn Entertainment has announced that its first game, 2014’s multiplayer-only Titanfall, has been delisted from storefronts and will remain delisted for good. 
This means that anyone who doesn’t own Titanfall digitally will now not be able to as it’s no longer available for purchase on digital storefronts. However, you could still technically find a physical copy and own it that way. Titanfall will also be removed from subscription services on March 1, 2022, which means it’ll be taken off Xbox Game Pass and EA Play that day. 
Fortunately for those that do already own it, Respawn says it’s keeping servers live so actually playing it is still possible for the foreseeable future. 
studio’s official announcement on Twitter reads. “It’s a game that showcased the ambitions of the studio when it was first released more than 7 years ago and it continues to be a beacon of innovation that we strive for in all of our games.

We’ve made the decision to discontinue new sales of the original Titanfall game starting today and we’ll be removing the game from subscription services on March 1, 2022. We will, however, be keeping servers live for the dedicated fanbase still playing and those who own the game and are looking to drop into a match. 

Rest assured, Titanfall is core to Respawn’s DNA and this incredible universe will continue. Today in Titanfall 2 and Apex Legends, and in the future. This franchise is a north star for the caliber of experiences we will continue to create here at Respawn. Thank you from the entire Respawn team.”

                    <span>Another month, another batch of games arriving (and leaving) Xbox Game Pass. Are there interesting games coming to the subscription service this month? Yes, but this is true so often that I&#x27;ve grown blasé. I am a hedonistic king and I have grown weary of pleasure. Stardew Valley, Halo Infinite and Space Warlord Organ Trading Simulator cannot rouse me out of ennui.

                    <span>&quot;Titanfall is part of our DNA,&quot; says the latest announcement from Respawn Entertainment, before going on to reveal that they&#x27;re having gene therapy. Titanfall 1, the studio&#x27;s first game, is being removed from sale today and will disappear from subscription services on March 1st, 2022. It&#x27;s the inevitable end for the wall-running mech battler, a multiplayer experiment that started cutting bits out of itself mere months after release.

                    <span>ConcernedApe is working away on his next game, but Stardew Valley is still receiving patches. Version 1.5.5 was released today, and while it adds no new content it makes &quot;some important technical changes for modders, some quality of life changes, and some bug fixes&quot; for the farming simulator.

                    <span>The folks over at Heart Machine have slid back into the fold with a game set in the same universe as their action-adventure debut Hyper Light Drifter. Except this time it’s not a top-down hack-and-slasher, but a stylish skate to save a civilisation on the brink of collapse. Solar Ash sees you flipping onto the backs of massive monsters and felling them like you’re performing athletic acupuncture. So yes, it does retain something from its predecessor, and that’s the element of cool. This is a cool game. One that excels when it lets you off the leash, only, that doesn’t happen as often as I’d have liked.

                    <span>Digital Extremes have announced the release date for Warframe&#x27;s hefty new expansion, The New War. On December 15th, players will be able to jump into a fresh set of campaign missions in the looter shooter, but instead of playing as your usual Warframe, you&#x27;ll hop into the shoes of a bunch of different characters. The devs call it a &quot;cinematic expansion&quot; that&#x27;s  chock-full of story stuff answering &quot;long-standing questions&quot; about the game&#x27;s universe.

                    <span>Last year, Overwatch introduced an experimental mode that Blizzard have mostly used to test potential balance changes, and show players what the devs have been messing around with internally. They tend to be fairly minor tweaks, and there hasn&#x27;t been an experimental update in a little while. But last night we finally got a new one, and from what I&#x27;ve played it&#x27;s full of daft and fun tweaks. Prepare yourselves for flying Roadhogs and Genjis, nanoboosted Anas, and a handful of wonderfully-timed voicelines.

The co-op shooter will also introduce new guns, challenge cards and a place for you to see your alien-bashing stats. What&#x27;s more,  it&#x27;s coming to Xbox Game Pass too. I was never going to buy this game, but I&#x27;d love to try it out. Thanks for that one, Game Pass.

The developers have announced plans to release version 1.0 on the 2nd of February, 2022. The care and attention to detail of this mod is stunning, looking so much nicer than both Capcom&#x27;s official makeover and the recent Resident Evil 4 VR, and I can hardly wait to play RE4 again with it.

                    <span>Halo Infinite surprise-launched its multiplayer a couple of weeks ago. People seem to like it a lot, grindy and unrewarding battle pass aside. If you, like me, are more interested in the game for its singleplayer, then have a gander below for the launch trailer put together ahead of the campaign&#x27;s December 8th release.

                    <span>I don&#x27;t much envy Bethesda. All game development seems like a bunfight with the impossible, but following in the footsteps of Skyrim is surely cursed. Starfield, the team&#x27;s sci-fi open-world game, needs to be the same and different and better than Skyrim, a game that has been consistently popular for ten years.

In the latest, teasing, behind-the-scenes Into The Starfield video, the development team discuss some of the values that remain the same between Starfield and Bethesda&#x27;s other games. It maybe starts with the cups.

These jokes have been restored by GTA: The Trilogy - Definitive Edition&#x27;s latest patch, which corrects spelling on signage, puts the hard angles back on the Tuff Nut logo, and stops it raining indoors quite so often.

Released on PC today following Apple Arcade and Switch versions, it&#x27;s made by a team including two heavy-hitting murdergame veterans: the director of the Zero Escape series, and the writer of Danganronpa. It&#x27;s about a group of schoolchildren who find themselves in an undersea theme park and are forced by a clown to- oh for, what is it with these cheery mascots who have one jacked-up eye and a propensity for violence?

From one FPS to the other, I put my eye up to a lens and I press triggers. Sometimes I’m a sniper dropping Nazis to protect my father, sometimes I’m a soldier surrounded by 127 other players. Lately, I’m a chunky spartan with crunchy crayon armour.
All this time with the three big FPSes of the year, each packaged in their own ways, has left me wondering what’s important nowadays. Do they need campaigns, or is multiplayer-only the way to go? How about introducing one a bit later than the other?

The other big change with this season is a rework of the Outback map, which cleans up a lot of junk to improve sightlines, and help attackers strategise.

Instead, I fell back into stale, boring habits like “entrusting the lives of my comrades to someone with ambitions outside of ‘moar acorns plz’.” Not a moment goes by that I don’t wistfully consider what might have been.

Clarity Boost, as they call it, aims to make games look better through some client-side processing fanciness. The feature is currently only supported in a test version of the Microsoft Edge browser, planning to roll out to regular Edge soon.

The developers, 343 Industries already boosted progression pace, but evidently that wasn&#x27;t enough, and now they&#x27;re coming round for another pass at the pass. From today, they&#x27;re planning to offer bonus XP for the first six matches you play every day.

                    <span>As CD Projekt Red continue to fix up their fancy-but-oh-so-flawed futuristic RPG Cyberpunk 2077, they&#x27;ve confirmed that we should expect a &quot;major update&quot; next year, by the end of March. CDPR had previously said Cyberpunk 2077&#x27;s next-gen console update would be out by then, but confirming another big patch for everyone then too is news. Not big news, but welcome news, especially considering how many new players the game has picked up since going half-price in Black Friday sales.

                    <span>Here we are, chums, Cyber Monday. Ahh, how the mighty have fallen. What was once an interesting online addition to the Black Friday feeding frenzy, is now a withered and useless appendage. We all shop online now and Black Friday lasts for at least three months of the year. Well, either that or I’m in some kind of deals post writing, Groundhog Day-esque limbo. Whatever the case may be, Cyber Monday is still a weird 90s relic, like many other things with cyber as a prefix. Cybergoth, for example, a sub-sub-culture whose chief point of relevance in the modern era is having their entire aesthetic appropriated by gaming peripheral manufacturers. You can’t move for black and neon doohickeys with LEDs dripping from every orifice. While I’ll be the first to argue that anything is better than the beige everything of yesteryear, sometimes you need to be a bit grown-up and accessorise your PC with reliable, understated, no-nonsense black. Like this HyperX Cloud Alpha S headset which is now discounted at Amazon.

                    <span>I don’t know about you, but when I hear the word odyssey, I’m expecting something grand, something mythic, something literally homeric. Samsung’s line of monitors certainly contains models that fit the bill, including the cyclopean Odyssey G9. Sadly, such excess isn’t always practical. Your desk just isn’t big enough or, for some reason, you don’t have a grand just sitting around to spend on a monitor. Despite that, you still want to have a little odyssey, as a treat. An odyssette, maybe? Which I’ve just discovered is a real word and not something I made up for a bad gag. Well, don’t worry, chums, I’m here with a deal on the much more manageable Samsung Odyssey G5, for when you’re feeling just a little bit epic.

                    <span>Back in August, which is obviously an unfathomable length of time ago, the adverts for a mobile game called Merge Mansion went semi-viral on Twitter. The post was not unwarranted. The twists, the turns, the drama: it all makes Merge Mansion seem like it must be bananas.
In that original advert, a bride gets out of a taxi to find her house (and presumably husband) is on fire. Her grandmother takes care of her and unlocks the gate to a huge mansion, which the woman begins rennovating. Then out of nowhere the cops come and arrest grandma, and she presses her hand to the inside of the police car window where, Lost-style, she&#x27;s written a message on the palm of her hand reading &quot;He is alive&quot;. I was reminded of it this weekend because I saw a similar ad where a policeman comes to the house to arrest grandma and she escapes on a motorbike, pulling a sick wheelie.

                    <span>Gamesplanet is the next in a long line of vendors to post up its seasonal offerings - now into its second week of Xmas deals. In other words, this isn&#x27;t a Cyber Monday sale per se, though if you were already in a shopping mood from all the other Cyber Monday deals floating around you can still avail yourself of some big savings.
Last year&#x27;s festive Gamesplanet sale had some major discounts, and this year is no different. There has been a lot of releases to chew through this year, and with the end of lockdown sapping all of our collective motivation away, it meant that some things could slip through the net. But that&#x27;s where the sales come in, so we can pick up those games we were eyeing up for cheap.

                    <span>Earlier this month, Platinum Games held a closed beta for their upcoming action RPG, Babylon&#x27;s Fall. For the most part, feedback from the test looked pretty good, though some players noticed something a familiar - the game reused armour and emotes from Final Fantasy XIV. Producer Yosuke Saito says that&#x27;s because Square Enix let Platinum borrow them, letting the devs add lots more gear than they had originally planned.

                    <span>It’s not something my parents tell their friends, but I am a man who has played every Call Of Duty campaign. I’ve been in more helicopter crashes than you could believe. I’ve seen capital ships on fire off the shoulder of Mars, watched sniper scopes glitter in the smog near Brandenburg Gate. All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain.
Unless I can record them in a big list, of course, clawing back some of that sunk cost in the process. While the COD campaign no longer holds the high ground at the water cooler, where it once dominated pop culture discussion, it’s still a place you can reliably find solo thrills in a world of service shooters. You might be surprised to learn that, despite diminishing returns, some of the best examples are hidden among the duds of the last decade. I’ve made it my duty to point them out to you - the spotter to your artillery.

                    <span>They Always Run is the closest I’ve come to living out my dream of being a galactic bounty hunter. It’s a 2D platformer with two distinct halves to its gameplay. One portion is a rewarding parkour simulator, and the other’s this heavy, visceral combat system that I never got tired of. You play as a three-armed mutant called Aiden as he hops between planets collecting bounties, which are presented through a series of action-platformer linear levels. It almost never goes as planned. The title’s pretty accurate.

                    <span>Halo Infinite&#x27;s multiplayer beta has only been out for a couple of weeks, but the free-to-play FPS doesn&#x27;t have effective anti-cheat, and it&#x27;s really beginning to show. Players have been posting clips on social media of supposed cheaters using wallhacks, aimbots and more. Now Xbox Halo players are asking developers 343 Industries for an option to turn crossplay off, so they don&#x27;t have to deal with pesky PC hackers.

                    <span>It may be below freezing outside, but that doesn&#x27;t mean our hard working PCs will keep as cool. Even a modest gaming rig will be filled with  components kicking out heat for long periods of time, so it&#x27;s vital to equip your CPU with a competent cooler like the Cooler Master Hyper 212 Evo V2.
Thankfully, Cyber Monday is here with a deal that knocks a few quid off what was already an affordable chiller, making it even better for first-time builders and anyone looking to upgrade from stock coolers on a limited budget.

That news comes from a new financial presentation from Enad Global 7, the parent company of folks include DCUO devs Dimensional Ink Games and DCUO publishers Daybreak. What actually is the Marvel MMO? A secret, for now. But I wouldn&#x27;t feel wrong making some assumptions.

                    <span>Welcome to Cyber Monday, gang. While today usually marks the last chance to jump on any lingering Black Friday deals, there can and will be some shiny new savings on PC gaming hardware as well – hardware like the Gigabyte B550M DS3H, a microATX motherboard that’s dropped into prime territory for first-time builders on tight budgets.


Amazon has it for just £55, which is chump change for a mobo that’s compatible with both AMD Ryzen 3000 chips and the latest Ryzen 5000 series. That’s down from its £73 price tag on Black Friday itself, and down from a £100 RRP.

                    <span>Well, chums, Black Friday itself has been and gone. I’m still here though, highlighting deals for you, because we’re in deals season now and the ride is going to continue all through to Christmas and the New Year beyond! The whole Black Friday phenomenon is very weird if you’re old enough to predate online shopping and not from the USA. Feels like just yesterday that everyone was terrified of using their credit cards online, Amazon was just a book shop and Thanksgiving was just something you only heard of on American TV shows. Now it’s another huge American export, allowing retailers to extend their discounting shenanigans for a whole extra month. The worst thing about it is that our colonial cousins keep some of the best bargains for themselves, as is the case with this Razer BlackWidow V3 mechanical keyboard.

                    <span>As those of you who have been hiding behind my sofa, or just read our “What are we all buying this Black Friday?” article, are aware, the top item on my Black Friday shopping list was a new chair. I did manage to procure a solid bottom-rest at a good discount and I’m very happy with my purchase. Unfortunately, it still cost a good chunk of change, leaving me with much less to spend on my recently rediscovered Warhammer habit.

Luckily for anyone still looking for somewhere to park their behind while gaming, you can get your hands (cheeks?) on a Razer Iskur gaming chair worth £500 for free. You do have to buy a laptop first though.

                    <span>Around this time last year, I put out a call for headset recommendations, looking for something cheapish and not terrible. An Internet Friend offered me an old set and I gratefully accepted, not being in the position to turn down free stuff. A few days later, I opened the package that arrived to find, not the slightly dodgy cast-off I’d expected, but a shiny SteelSeries Arctis 5. I’m not someone who gets good quality peripherals very often and the sheer generosity made me shed more than a few tears. Using it is like having an angel gently hug my head while they whisper game noises in my ears.

Which is all just a long-winded way of saying that the SteelSeries Arctis headsets are very good and you should totally check out the SteelSeris Arctis 7 deals we have featured below the jump.

I do not know why so many of the megacorps now celebrate the day dedicated to all those cyberpunks who fight against injustice and corruption every day of their lives, but it&#x27;s a day which deserves recognition. So rest today and play some games in-between polishing your mirrorshades, dusting off your leather, and preparing a fresh boot disc. On Monday we hack the planet, but what are you playing this weekend?

Due to my lowly status, I’m not allowed to handle such hallowed items, so I must consult the wisdom of my betters. We haven’t written about the wired HyperX Cloud II 7.1 headset, but Katharine looked at the wireless version, which is the same, but with less wire. Katharine again, hmm? Is this some kind of conspiracy? Is she using her boss lady powers to get all the good stuff? Or did she just used to be our hardware editor? I’ve connected the dots!

I still have to do exactly what I’m told, but now I’m allowed to pull the big, brass lever that fires the deals cannon. In practice, that means I can keep updating you with the best bargains late into the sunless hours, while  James goes home to do whatever hardware editors do in their free time. Since I have promised not to publish my thirty seven page manifesto entitled “Why I think dogs should vote,” I’m going to talk about this BenQ MOBIUZ EX2710Q monitor instead.

                    <span>As awards season approaches and I start to compile a list of all the great games I missed this year, there&#x27;s one game I really regret not covering in more detail at RPS around the time it came out. That game is The Vale: Shadow Of The Crown, an audio-only RPG about a blind princess fighting to save her kingdom. You may have seen it nominated in the Innovation in Accessibility category of The Game Awards this year, and frankly if it doesn&#x27;t win then a great disservice will have been done. A stark contrast to the other, all very AAA nominees in its category, The Vale doesn&#x27;t rely on flashy visuals to tell its story. In fact, it barely has any graphics at all. Instead, it conjures its world - and tense fighting sequences - from sound alone, creating an experience like nothing else I&#x27;ve ever played.
