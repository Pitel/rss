                              <span>Some assets have been changed.
We&#x27;re running out of months in 2023 and there&#x27;s still no sign of Hollow Knight: Silksong arriving on the Nintendo Switch any time soon.

Before we hop into the ring with this week&#x27;s competition, however, let&#x27;s quickly recap what happened last time.

The North normally retails for £125 or more, but today you can pick it up for a more reasonable £110 when you buy from Box via Ebay, using code SAVINGS20 before September 28th.

                              <span>Dragon&#x27;s Dogma was the action-RPG for people who wanted to play alone, but didn&#x27;t want to feel alone. By far its most charming feature was the Pawn system, whereby you&#x27;d create an AI-controlled sidekick and hire two others, shared online by other players, to accompany you on your journey through a fantasy wilderness of tumbledown castles and goblin campfires. Pawns make dependable companions in many respects - pinning enemies for you to tag-team kill, healing or resurrecting you, opening chests you&#x27;ve missed, and enchanting your weapons at the outset of each skirmish. But what makes them fun to be around is that they&#x27;re a bunch of massive buffoons. 


Pawns talk without cease as you explore: a steady patter of idle observations about well-wrought staircases and the local fish trade, advice about the bestiary and, in the case of Pawns recruited from other players, quest tips based on time in their own worlds - all of it couched in the game&#x27;s quirky faux-medieval dialect. Pawn dialogue is highly context-sensitive, and very often, nonsensical. They&#x27;ll climb into fountains and complain that they&#x27;re wet, and launch into pithy descriptions of monsters even as they&#x27;re set on fire. It ought to be maddening, but somehow, it never is - probably because the Pawns never actually attempt to be witty like ally characters in, say, Xenoblade Chronicles. They&#x27;re resolutely straight foils in a realm of lions with snakes for tails, chaotic boulder traps, unpleasantly lusty ogres, and players who push the wrong buttons and make random decisions on the fly. Well, pawns are back in Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2, which I recently played an hour of, and they&#x27;re chattier than ever.

Sharing their creation with the rest of the word initially appeared to be too expensive, but then they discovered a new technology called BitTorrent. Fast forward two decades and their “Fanimatrix&quot; release is the oldest active torrent that&#x27;s still widely shared today.

                              <span>I recently had the opportunity to speak with Rowan Parker, the Creative Director at Riot Forge Games. While some of the interview with Rowan touched on the overall design process at Riot Forge, most of the focus was on the upcoming Song of Nunu: A League of Legends Story. I have to admit I had expected the interview to be rather straightforward. Based on what I had seen from the trailers for Song of Nunu so far, I thought I knew what was in store. A cozy and playful lighthearted adventure through the Freljord as Nunu, with Willump and Braum by my side. Surely there&#x27;d be some laughs, some gaffes, and maybe even a guffaw or two. 


As my questioning began, Rowan was quick to remind me: Song of Nunu is being developed by Tequila Works, a developer well known for their hard-hitting narratives …</span>

                              <span>The Sega Genesis didn’t technically get Valis II. Instead, it got the remake of the first Valis and Valis III. However, between these two games was a title that remained exclusive to the platform, and that was the bizarrely named Syd of Valis. The Japanese title makes more sense. It’s SD Valis, named such because it uses a “super deformed” anime art style, which might be better known in the West as “Chibi.”


Why? Fucked if I know.


Syd of Valis is presumably a play on the whole “SD” thing, but then the game goes on to refer to Yuko, the protagonist, as Syd, while the manual and box cover do not.


So, anyway, that’s a great start. Syd of Valis tells the same story as Valis II, but with smaller characters, essentially. And with a dumber name.

It&#x27;s the weekend! That means it&#x27;s time to sit back, relax, and enjoy some games.
Before we do so, however, let&#x27;s take a look back at what&#x27;s been going on this week. One of the biggest stories was actually in relation to the massive leak suffered by Xbox in which Phil Spencer expressed a rather blunt desire to acquire Nintendo. Good luck with that, Phil.

                              <span>Stardew Valley remains among the most beloved indie games of the past decade, and its content updates over the years help maintain its popularity. Developer ConcernedApe fuels the farming fanfare with additions both big and small, and it looks like he&#x27;s teasing another. 


The newest of these teases is an image of a parrot on top of a blue perch. It&#x27;s a cute picture, but the bird&#x27;s demand for money and capital J on the perch implies there&#x27;s more to it.




Fans noted these features and ascribed them to Jojamart, the supermarket chain that works as Stardew Valley&#x27;s antagonist. Blue is the company&#x27;s primary color and is transparently greedy just as this bird seems to be. 


Stardew Valley&#x27;s farm-hungry community also noted the tropical setting, leading some to speculate that Joja reached Ginger Island. Some assume Jojamart expanded into Ginger Island, so its reach goes beyond Pelican Town. Others speculate that the parrot is an upcoming incentive for players to pursue working with Jojamart.


Whatever the answer is, ConcernedApe is keeping mum about the situation. Whether it&#x27;s for Stardew Valley&#x27;s 1.6 updates or screenshots from the upcoming Haunted Chocolatier, any context given is often vague.


It&#x27;s an effective way to stir up Stardew chatter, as fans get a look into an upcoming project only to have more questions than answers. I&#x27;m among them, so I eat these teasers up while coming up with my own wild theories. 


Part of me gets annoyed these teasers have no elaboration, but it also adds to the fun of wondering. Whatever the answer is, a parrot demanding money from players fits right in with all of Stardew Valley&#x27;s oddities. As for when we&#x27;ll see the bird, no one knows for now. Stardew Valley version 1.6 doesn&#x27;t have a release date yet.

                              <span>8-Bit Legit has announced they&#x27;ll be handling the publishing duties for Project Blue, an NES-style cyberpunk sidescroller by ToggleSwitch/FrankenGraphics that is coming to modern consoles with a physical release on NES.


Writing about new NES games never gets old. Project Blue casts you as Blue, a child trying to escape a research laboratory in Neo Hong Kong. The trailer advertises Perfect Blue as being built from 256 screens, which kind of makes it look like the underappreciated Legacy of the Wizard. In fact, a lot of the game looks like a futuristic Legacy of the Wizard, which I am totally down for. The publisher also says that there will be three difficulty levels that will modify the game’s layout, which is pretty spiffy.




It’s worth noting that you can already grab Project Blue on PC over on Itch. 8-Bit Legit is the publishing arm of Retrotainment Games and Mega Cat Studios, and is just handling publishing on consoles. I know Retrotainment from Garbage Pail Kids, which was a pretty terrific NES release.


I’m always on board for a new NES game. We’ve come a long way from the early days of homebrew titles. Now, we’ve got boutique publishers who handle all the curation and quality control. It’s nice to have the option to play it on modern consoles, but given the option, give me that plastic rectangle and let me slot it into my computer-toaster.


Project Blue is currently available on PC. The console version will be available for pre-order starting on September 29, 2023, and the retail release will follow on October 6, 2023.

                              <span>The 2.0 update for Cyberpunk 2077 is out, and it contains a ton of changes big and small to CD Projekt Red&#x27;s RPG world. But hidden away in 2077 is a reference just for Cyberpunk: Edgerunners fans, and an especially emotional one at that.


It&#x27;s no surprise that, after the massive popularity of the Studio Trigger and Netflix anime, CD Projekt would find a way to work the world of Edgerunners more into its digital Night City in Cyberpunk 2077. Heck, we&#x27;ve already seen a few additions, ranging from a special gun to David&#x27;s signature jacket. With the 2.0 update, though, CD Projekt Red put in a tribute to not just one or two, but several different characters who all made Cyberpunk: Edgerunners what it is.

Saves of previous versions are not compatible, and Larian recommends Mac players fully uninstall previous versions of BG3 to minimize potential issues. 


Feature-wise, a new Magic Mirror is now at camp. Players can interact with the Magic Mirror to change their appearance at any time, however many times they want. While appearance, voice, pronouns, and your...uh...special parts, can be changed, race/subrace and body type cannot. Also, origin characters, hirelings, and full illithids cannot use the Magi…</span>

                              <span>HoYoverse, the company behind several gacha hits, has announced a follow-up to one in Honkai Impact 3rd Part 2. The next step in Honkai Impact 3rd&#x27;s journey is due to depart in February 2024.


While many in the western world became familiar with HoYoverse / miHoYo through Genshin Impact, Honkai Impact 3rd was the game that came before, and still holds a solid playerbase throughout its seven-year lifespan. This new chapter, Honkai Impact 3rd Part 2, heads to Mars.


Check out the first look below to get a glimpse at what HoYoverse is cooking up for this new chapter:




It seems like Honkai Impact 3rd Part 2 is a direct follow-up to the base Honkai Impact 3rd, but in what manner, I&#x27;m not sure. HoYoverse looks to be improving the combat, exploration, and more in Part 2, as well as departing on a new story branch of some kind.


I&#x27;ve played some Genshin and actually really dug Honkai Star Rail, but 3rd has eluded me a bit. Still, that might make this new release of Honkai Impact 3rd a good jumping-on point. Taking some of the popularity drummed up by Genshin Impact and Honkai Star Rail, and then funneling it back into the two games&#x27; predecessor, would be a good play to grab some curious folks already intrigued by HoYoverse&#x27;s world.


A world away


Still, Part 2 isn&#x27;t the only impending HoYoverse title. Alongside updates to Genshin and Star Rail, the company is also still working on Zenless Zone Zero, a stylish action RPG that&#x27;s been on my radar for a while.


HoYoverse recently confirmed that Z3 (as I call it in Slack) is coming to consoles, alongside a PC and mobile version. It&#x27;s unclear when that might be, exactly, but it&#x27;s a nice addition.


And it&#x27;s another game to add to the growing roster of HoYoverse titles. Keeping up with them all seems like quite a lot, but if you like the look and charm of these games, it sure seems like you won&#x27;t be hurting for more of them next year.

                              <span>Even in the pre-release review period for Armored Core 6, I didn&#x27;t encounter any major bugs. That&#x27;s kind of rare in this current AAA landscape, but that doesn&#x27;t mean they don&#x27;t exist! Thankfully, From Software is planning on swiftly addressing some snafus with a variety of patches, and we&#x27;re already three updates in at this point.


Patch 1.03 has been applied to all versions of the game, and is aimed at &quot;improving gameplay stability and applying bug fixes.&quot; One big quality-of-life upgrade is the ability to directly quit online matches while spectating, which was a bit of a pain to finesse before 1.03. A few visual bugs were also addressed, as well as more annoying issues like enemies getting stuck in terrain under specific circumstances, or boost problems with Tetrapod legs (my frame of c…</span>

                              <span>Cozy games have carved a chill little niche for themselves, and you don&#x27;t get much cozier than the Shire. The home of the Hobbits is the subject of a new game from publisher Private Division and developer Weta Workshop. The two paired up to announce Tales of the Shire: A The Lord of the Rings Game, currently planned for 2024. 


Specific platforms weren&#x27;t announced, but the official Twitter is live and lists the game for consoles and PC. You can see a quick live-action preview in the teaser trailer.




Pipe-weed dreams


There isn&#x27;t much in the way of information beyond what little we see in the teaser. Like anything chill and Hobbit-related, the video shows someone putting the finishing touches on some book illustrations. If said book covers another harrowing journey, we&#x27;re not likely to take any part of that in this quaint entry. The official accounts describe it as a &quot;cozy The Lord of the Rings game set in the Middle-earth universe.&quot; 


This all follows last August&#x27;s news of Private Division and Weta Workshop signing a deal for a new game set in Middle-earth. Weta has worked intimately with J.R.R. Tolkien&#x27;s world, handling effects for Peter Jackson&#x27;s The Lord of the Rings films, among many other projects. Now we&#x27;ll just have to wait to see exactly how relaxing this take on the material will be once it launches.


Tales of the Shire is just one of the new projects in the works based on The Lord of the Rings. There&#x27;s also Return to Moria, which will hopefully wipe the taste of Gollum (yuck, sorry) out of everyone&#x27;s mouths.

As part of his &quot;Grab Bag&quot; segment (which includes random things Sakurai feels like sharing with the world), this time he&#x27;s focusing on collectibles (which he calls &quot;rare belongings&quot;). If you&#x27;re the type of person who gets easily jealous, you may want to look away.




When Sakurai leads some of these reveals with &quot;only about three of these exist,&quot; you know you&#x27;re about to see some real stuff.

Here&#x27;s a full list of gaming collectibles Sakurai shows off



A Wii remote that has Sakurai&#x27;s likeness printed on the back, given to him as a gift by Nintendo &quot;when Miis were first implemented.&quot;


A Pit and Palutena figure that was printed as a reference for a float for a Nintendo-related event: only three of them exist in the world


Autographed copies of Mario Anniversary for Wii (signed by Miyamoto)


A signed bit of artwork for Kid Icarus: Uprising, from manga artist Shigeyuki Fukumitsu


An Xbox 360 Elite with Sakura&#x27;s name engraved on it: he got the plate directly from Microsoft as a gift (and funnily enough it got the Red Ring of Death [RROD])


A SEGA Associate Planner Certificate from the late &#x27;80s, awarded by SEGA to Sakurai



The last item is perhaps the most interesting; as Sakurai notes that he was awarded the certificate for coming up with the idea for Active Time Battles (ATB) in the RPG genre, before the ATB mechanic was widely adopted; and before he was part of the industry proper. What a milestone!

                              <span>Based on my review in progress, I was hoping Lies of P would improve over time. It didn&#x27;t.


No matter how much I play Lies of P, I can’t get over how heavily it borrowed from FromSoftware’s Souls series. I get it. The video game industry is built on trends. In the wake of every big success, there are always a number of followers who try to capitalize on the newfound hunger. But this isn’t Cities: Skylines borrowing the zoning system from SimCity 2000. This isn’t even Final Fantasy using the party system from Dragon Quest.


Lies of P borrows everything from FromSoftware’s titles. Movement, combat, right down to the aesthetic. A brief glance at Lies of P, and you could easily mistake it for Bloodborne. Lies of P is Bloodborne with puppets, and that is such a waste of Neowiz’s obvious talen…</span>

                              <span>In an open letter to its community, Unity has revealed its reworked free structure and controversial runtime fee changes. Under the new structure, the Unity Personal edition will remain free and incur no runtime fee. The new cap before the fee starts has been increased from $100,000 to $200,000, and no game with under $1 million in trailing 12-month revenue will be subject to the fee. Interestingly, the new Runtime Fee will only apply to the next version of Unity that is shipping in 2024. Already shipped and current in-development projects will not be subject to the fee unless they upgrade to the 2024 version of Unity. In the post, Marc Whitten, leader of the Unity Create team apologized for what has transpired in recent weeks.

Well, it did! And then some.

Resident Evil 4: Separate Ways DLC (PC, PS4, PS5 [reviewed], Xbox Series X/S)
Developer: Capcom
Publisher: Capcom
Released: September 21, 2023
MSRP: $9.99


If you&#x27;ve never played Separate Ways before (it was a side/unlockable mode in the original release and not a paid DLC), it&#x27;s a gaiden of sorts that deals with what Ada Wong was up to behind the scenes while Leon was out hamming it up and kicking ass. You&#x27;ll occasionally meet-cute with Leon during the narrative, and deal with old/new enemy types, as well as run through old/new locations.

                              <span>Microsoft and Rare have given details on the upcoming Season 10 of their shanty-inspiring game, Sea of Thieves. If you have friends, you might be interested in guilds. If you’re like me and don’t have friends, then the private sessions are going to be more up your alley.


First off, Season 10 is going to introduce guilds into the game. These are organizations for up to 24 players. Within these guilds, players and crews team up to accomplish common goals. Their success will help boost the Guild Reputation, and doing so will unlock new cosmetics for everyone involved. Guilds can be customized with names, branding, and mottos so you can all unite under a single humiliating banner.


Season 10’s addition of private sessions is more geared toward the introvert. Whether you have a tight group of friends or would just rather play alone, the “Safer Seas” mode strips out the PvP involved with other players sailing around. Instead, you can focus on completing Tall Tales or doing some fishing without worrying about distant cannonballs.


However, if you hate people and want to get back at them for existing, then there’s also a competitive addition in Season 10. This comes in the form of a new world event where you attempt to find the Skull of Siren Song. The catch is that any crew that accepts the quest has the same map, leading them to the same spot. Moreover, if you get there first, you’ll only find half of the treasure, which immediately illuminates you with a beacon that everyone can see. So, whoever has that second half is going to be looking for you.


Sea of Thieves is available on PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S. Season 10 starts on October 19th.

                              <span>There&#x27;s plenty to appreciate in Starfield. You get gorgeous looks at outer space, intense shootouts with Spacer Scum, and some good companions to enjoy your adventure with. The game also features a stellar soundtrack courtesy of audio director Mark Lampert and composer Inon Zur.


If you&#x27;ve fallen in love with Starfield&#x27;s soundtrack, you can enjoy the lo-fi version of it courtesy of Bethesda. The studio released Lofi Girl remixes, giving you the perfect background music when you&#x27;re sailing across the Settled Systems. 




In typical Bethesda fashion, Starfield features a soundtrack that is grand yet sits neatly in the background as you embark on your adventures. There are plenty of spacey synths and grand orchestras that lend themselves quite well to both space exploration and lo-fi remixes. 


If you&#x27;re interested, you can listen to Zur and Lampert discuss how they created Starfield&#x27;s captivating music. They are cleverly able to explain some of their more abstract ideas, such as how the melodies have been composed to form circular patterns. Players who have completed Starfield and headed into New Game+ will understand how this mirrors the game&#x27;s structure. 


Can&#x27;t get enough of the soundtrack? You can grab it and the artbook on Microsoft Store.

                              <span>In January 2022, Microsoft announced its intention to acquire Activision Blizzard for a whopping $68.7 billion. Since then, Microsoft has had to overcome several hurdles to get the deal approved in various regions. The UK has been one of the biggest obstacles, though it appears some important progress has been made. 


A press release from the Competition and Markets Authority reveals that it is pleased with the adjustments Microsoft has made to the deal following prior objections. As previously reported, Microsoft will no longer purchase Activision Blizzard&#x27;s cloud gaming rights. Instead, they will be sold to Ubisoft. This is being done to stave off any sense of Microsoft&#x27;s monopolization of cloud gaming.

                              <span>After a week of hints and teasers, Paradox Interactive has finally revealed its new title: Millennia. In Millennia, players will create their own nation in a historical turn-based 4X environment. From there, players will shape the nation across 10,000 years of history starting with the dawn of humanity and stretching into the future. According to Paradox, each playthrough will be unique as you craft an epic story based on your actions. The new strategy title is being developed by C Prompt Games, who doesn&#x27;t seem to have much of a history. Based on their Steam page, the only previous title by them is a digital board game called Heretic Operative. A teaser trailer was included in the announcement that briefly shows some of the many different Ages you can experience.




Many ages throughout the Millennia


In the trailer alone we see quite a few Ages starting with some rather common periods for the genre. Stone, Bronze, Iron, Kings, and Discovery, are all familiar periods in a historical 4X strategy game. However, near the end of the teaser, we get a glimpse at some rather peculiar Ages such as the Age of Old Ones, Age of Visitors, Age of Archangel, and even Age of Rogue AI. Wait did that say Old Ones? Where do I sign up?


Based on the screenshots on the Millennia Steam page, it looks like gameplay will be similar to the Civilization series and Humankind. The big difference here though appears to be the many different ways your nation can go, as opposed to just vertical technological advances.


I&#x27;m a huge fan of Paradox titles, but don&#x27;t get into Civilization-like games as easily. For comparison, I have almost 400 hours in Stellaris yet only 50 in Civilization VI. As such, I had trouble really getting into Humankind. I&#x27;m hoping Millennia does enough different to keep me playing like previous Paradox titles.


Millennia is aiming for a 2024 release on PC.

                              <span>Zenless Zone Zero, the stylish new game from HoYoVerse (MiHoYo) looks to be releasing on consoles, in addition to PC and mobile devices, as announced at the Tokyo Game Show Special Program. In past looks, the game was only announced for PC, iOS and Android.


Which consoles Zenless Zone Zero will be released for is, unfortunately, still a mystery. But if this game follows in its older sibling Genshin Impact’s footsteps, we can probably expect it to come to PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5. It most certainly could also come to Nintendo Switch, though Genshin Impact has not been made available for that platform as of writing — though it has been confirmed.




The TGS Special Program for Zenless Zone Zero features Yuka Iguchi and Yumi Igarashi, the voice actors behind Koleda and Corin, who discuss the game at length, from its setting as “the last urban civilization,” to “aspects such as the city and character design,” according to HoYoVerse. It’s about nineteen minutes in length, but as of writing, it has yet to be translated into English.


Zenless Zone Zero is, according to the official YouTube channel, a game taking place in “a dangerous world under constant threat from the mysterious calamities known as the &quot;Hollows&quot;, where the old civilization has been destroyed and world order lays in ruins.” It’s up to a variety of characters to take a stand and defeat the Hollows, each with their own unique reasons for fighting.

                              <span>While the Steam Deck has set the trend for portable PC-style gaming handhelds, there is some stiff competition aiming to make waves. The ASUS ROG Ally released recently and the Lenovo Legion GO is on the horizon. As such, Valve needs to keep ahead of the game, but a new iteration of the Deck may be some time off.


According to a report from The Verge, Valve&#x27;s own Pierre-Loup Griffais told the publication that he doesn&#x27;t anticipate a leap in performance that won&#x27;t compromise on battery life for &quot;the next couple of years.&quot;




This suggests that a Steam Deck 2 may not be on the horizon for some time. Indeed, Griffais, speaking to CNBC at the Tokyo Game Show, said the company is looking at a &quot;stable target&quot; over the next two years, suggesting that the team may not be looking to pursue a newer, more advanced model just yet.


How will Valve keep up with the market?


We know that the Half-Life developer is considering a follow-up to its popular Steam Deck device. However, Griffais&#x27; words make it seem like there won&#x27;t be one on the market for the foreseeable future.


A lot can happen in terms of technological leaps in a couple of years. How will Valve hope to retain its position in the mobile gaming world if it&#x27;s not looking at a new model just yet?


The report from The Verge speculates that a refresh of the Steam Deck could be a possible go-between. With the Nintendo Switch and graphics cards getting refreshed mid-generation, we could see something similar happen to the Deck, but it may not be one with more processing power or better hardware overall.


Of course, that&#x27;s all just speculation. You never know what can happen in this industry and as competition heats up in the market, Valve will likely be keeping a close eye on how the technology advances.

                              <span>When Nintendo announced that Game Boy Advance games would appear on the Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack service, I felt a tinge of excitement in my soul. Not because I love Game Boy Advance games, though that is certainly true. Rather, because I could never wrangle together the peripherals and people needed to make many of the system’s unique multiplayer experiences work. So when I saw this morning that Kirby &amp; The Amazing Mirror would be coming to Nintendo’s subscription service next week, I couldn’t help but smile.


For the uninitiated, Kirby &amp; The Amazing Mirror is a unique curiosity of a game. On one hand, it is as much a Kirby platformer as any. It has all the copy abilities and cute characters you could ask for. But instead of the traditional level-by-level structure, it veers…</span>

                              <span>It was only a matter of time until people started mashing Starfield up with Skyrim. Combining some of the assets of one Bethesda game with the world of another (or vice versa) was an inevitability. Trust the modding community to come through for us.


If you head over to Nexus Mods, user ndreams has just released a mod for Skyrim that lets you become companions with Starfield&#x27;s own Sarah Morgan, aka the Chair of Constellation.

It looks like a fairly simple change to The Elder Scrolls 5, adding Morgan in as a &quot;vanilla follower&quot; who can be seen wearing a standard miner outfit. Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t say whether or not she still retains any of her dialogue, so we may have to assume that she doesn&#x27;t.


Where can I find her?


Like with any follower – in Starfield or Skyrim – you&#x27;ll need to seek Sarah Morgan out before you can have her in your employ. The mod description page says she can be found wandering the streets of Whiterun during the day, or by the Temple of Kynareth at night.


You might need to do some tinkering before you can get her as a follower. For example, ndreams recommends some different textures. Other than that, it should be a pretty straightforward install.


Since Starfield came out just a few weeks ago, we&#x27;ve already seen a ruck of custom mods for the game. And more are coming out all the time. Indeed, there&#x27;s even been some crossover, such as this one, which is aiming to turn the Bethesda RPG into Star Wars.

                              <span>While we&#x27;ve still got a few days until Phantom Liberty drops, we can at least enjoy Cyberpunk 2077&#x27;s immense 2.0 update. Rolling out yesterday, the patch promises something of an overhaul for CD Projekt Red&#x27;s dystopian RPG.


In fact, despite a laundry list&#x27;s worth of tweaks, fixes, improvements, and implementations, a post on the game&#x27;s Steam page says that the changes are &quot;way too long to publish.&quot;




Having said that, what is listed is worthy of note. From AI enhancements to an overhaul of the perks and skills to even some remixed music from Idris Elba, version 2.0 of Cyberpunk 2077 could well be the ultimate way to experience the game.


CDPR has even said that a new save is highly recommended, given how many changes the game&#x27;s been through.

                              <span>LEGO&#x27;s Super Mario line is about to add a very hungry desk display piece in the form of a Piranha Plant figure. It may not be to scale, but it&#x27;s over nine inches tall and priced at $59.99. The set is yours to build and, if you choose, set alight with a fireball on November 6, 2023.


The LEGO Piranha Plant comes in a buildable pipe, which, yeah, I guess all LEGO things are buildable. Its head, mouth, stalk, and leaves are all posable. You&#x27;ll finally be able to capture that perfect &quot;Mario&#x27;s about to get eaten alive&quot; pose right on your shelf. Listed for builders 18 and older, the set is made up of 540 pieces.

That&#x27;s right, this is an adults only Piranha Plant. Like The Mighty Bowser set before it, the Piranha Plant is marketed to all the grown-ups out there who need more Mario foes on their shelves. I am absolutely including myself in that demographic. For my money, they nailed the look of this one, at least more so than Bowser. You might think it&#x27;s hard to mess up a Piranha Plant, but you&#x27;d be surprised. 


One thing this set is missing is any kind of digital play functions. It can&#x27;t interact with any of the other Super Mario LEGO sets, but it looks fine enough on its own. The best part is the fairly reasonable price. It would be hard to top the wallet-busting Bowser and NES LEGO sets, priced at $269.99 and $229.99, respectively. This is one plant I may actually be able to keep alive for longer than a week.

                              <span>Although a decade old, Final Fantasy XIV remains one of the best live-service games/MMORPGs to jump into. Its sprawling narrative and fascinating world were big draws to players like me, and now fans will can experience the world again from a new perspective.


In commemorating FFXIV&#x27;s 10th anniversary, Square Enix is adapting the game into a tabletop RPG. Many popular games make their way to the tabletop format and FFXIV is not a bad pick to adapt.


Based on the announcement and teaser website, FFXIV TTRPG operates something like Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Anywhere from 3-5 players work as adventurers in Eorzea to complete quests and go on TTRPG hijinks. Also like D&amp;D, a gamemaster manages sessions and controls the general pacing assuming the players don&#x27;t hijack the session.


A starter set is all that&#x27;s available, but for $60 it comes with guidebooks for players and gamemasters along with some accessories like a map and character tokens. There are also multiple scenarios pre-planned by the FFXIV development team to give players/gamemasters an introduction to its structure. It&#x27;s not a bad deal assuming everything included is high-quality.


I love FFXIV and D&amp;D, so this package is tailor-made for me. Potentially remaking my Miqo&#x27;te as a tabletop character is an awesome prospect and already a big sell for me.


Anyone who wants to pick up FFXIV TTRPG has to wait until May 2024 for it to come out. Pre-orders are available on Square Enix&#x27;s website, and the wait gives me enough time to pester my friends into trying out FFXIV.

                              <span>We won&#x27;t be getting a Sonic Mania sequel just yet, but we can expect a classic Sonic experience this year thanks to Sonic Superstars. We already know that the game will feature 2D side-scrolling, though it has ditched the pixel art style of Sonic Mania. Jun Senoue will be handling the soundtrack with some help from Tee Lopes. 




As the release date draws nearer, Sega has been dropping quite a few teasers, including a music track reveal. The latest tease comes in the form of a gorgeous animated short movie serving as the prequel to Sonic Superstars. You&#x27;ll be familiar with this colorful animation style if you&#x27;ve played Sonic games released in the past few years such as Sonic Origins.

Sonic&#x27;s troublesome trio


The short movie, titled Trio of Trouble, starts with Fang the Hunter up against Sonic, Tails, Amy, and Knuckles. Fortunately, Sonic and his friends outsmart Fang. 


Fang isn&#x27;t the only villain around, however. Dr. Eggman also makes an appearance and we get to see more of Trip, who is a new foe. As the prior reveal illustrated, Trip is dressed in metal armor, and she is quite clumsy and prone to setting off booby traps. 


Working together, Fang and Trip subdue a slippery serpent, but that isn&#x27;t quite what Dr. Eggman had in mind. Though they seem like a ragtag group of villains tripping over themselves, it does seem like they&#x27;ll pose a significant challenge.


You can play Sonic Superstars when it launches on October 17 on Nintendo Switch, PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S.

                              <span>Resident Evil fans have been waiting for Resident Evil 4 Remake&#x27;s VR mode, and at this year&#x27;s Tokyo Game Show, we saw a bit more of what&#x27;s in store. The free VR mode, which will be released on PS VR2, will allow you to experience Leon Kennedy&#x27;s tale in the most immersive way possible. 




As we learned from the latest trailer, the mode will feature realistic gunplay. You can experience this in Resident Evil Village&#x27;s VR mode where guns need to be physically reloaded and cocked back before you can fire, raising the tension in the game&#x27;s most frightening moments. The ability to throw knives is also back. 


Care has been taken to ensure a smooth VR experience. Hence you&#x27;ll be able to break crates holding loot with a single button press. You&#x27;ll also get to enjoy immersive 3D audio, allowing you to sense which direction foes are coming at you from.

Resident Evil 4 VR mode questions remain


Though we&#x27;ve learned a lot about the upcoming VR mode, there is still a lot that is left unanswered. There&#x27;s been no word yet on whether the DLC will support VR but if it&#x27;s anything like Resident Evil Village, it&#x27;ll be an exclusively main story feature. 


There&#x27;s also no certainty of whether you&#x27;ll be able to transfer your progress from the regular mode to the VR mode. Village did not have this feature which doesn&#x27;t give much hope that we&#x27;ll get it this time around. 


You can expect the game in Winter this year. Until then there&#x27;s the action-packed Separate Ways DLC to indulge in.

                              <span>At TGS 2023, Capcom released a nine-minute deep dive into the gameplay of Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2. Immediately I remembered the feelings I had when playing the original Dragon&#x27;s Dogma over a decade ago. I remember exploring the huge open world and scaling colossal beasts for the first time in an attempt to spam attack their head and drop them quickly. For the most part, Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 looks like an enhanced modern version of Dragon&#x27;s Dogma. And to be honest, that&#x27;s exactly what I want. Here&#x27;s the full nine-minute deep dive in its entirety:




A Tale of an Arisen and its Pawns


In the video, we get a look at several of the vocations—essentially classes—in Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2. Fighter, Archer, Thief, and Mage are all choosable vocations for both your Arisen and your Pawn. Magick Archer and Mystic …</span>

18 characters, both heroes and villains, will be available at launch. This includes the recent additions of Eijiro Kirishima, Momo Yaoyorozu, and Ibara Shiozaki.

                              <span>Following up on the recent Switch release of Baten Kaitos I &amp; II HD Remaster, Nintendo posted an interview with some of the original developers. Director and art director Yasuyuki Honne, planning director Koh Kojima, character designer Nakaba Higurashi, and composer Motoi Sakuraba all joined in to wax nostalgic. Thankfully, they shared relief while looking at how well both games have held up over the past two decades.


The original Baten Kaitos: Eternal Wings and the Lost Ocean launched on GameCube in Japan and the west in 2003 and 2004, respectively. Even 20 years later, there are many aspects of both it and its sequel that stand out today. &quot;One thing that amazed me once again was the background art,&quot; Koh Kojima commented. &quot;It is also surprising that [Yasuyuki] Honne drew all these almos…</span>

                              <span>Want to get a powerful Ryzen 7 7800X3D processor for $50 off with a free copy of Starfield Premium Edition? B&amp;H Photo in the US have you covered with their latest discount on AMD&#x27;s fastest gaming CPU*, which sees the processor drop to $389 after debuting earlier this year at $439. 
That&#x27;s still a hefty chunk of change, but it&#x27;s worth it for a gaming CPU that outfights the Core i9 13900K and trades blows with the much more expensive Ryzen 9 7950X3D, coming well ahead in some games and a tiny bit behind in others.

                              <span>Xbox&#x27;s Elite Series 2 controllers are a great pick for PC and Xbox consoles alike, but they&#x27;re also pretty darn expensive. Thankfully, you can pick up the cheaper Core version for significantly less money, especially if it&#x27;s on sale - which is the situation right now! Amazon US are selling the Elite Series 2 Core in white for $99, a solid reduction from its usual price of $130.

                              <span>My goodness, what a close thing. Fading Afternoon is a game of excellent vibes as you stroll around the city living your faintly sad life. It&#x27;s also an incredibly cool 2D beat &#x27;em up that is, at its best, comfortably the best I can think of. But the boundaries between the two are too frustrating to make it the legend it ought to be.
It&#x27;s a sequel to The Friends Of Ringo Ishikawa, a game I didn&#x27;t really vibe with. FA is much improved, a sort of pared down Yakuza game about beating rival gangsters up in between story bits about an ageing Maruyama trying to get the band back together after leaving prison and apparently not caring that he&#x27;s dying. I do recommend it, but be prepared for some friction.

The deck-building tower defence game casts you as an employee of Hell tasked with punishing sinners by building towers and deploying troops using a demonic computer system. I&#x27;ve played a few hours since Heretic&#x27;s Fork launched yesterday and while it hasn&#x27;t quite enraptured my hellbound heart, I am enjoying figuring it out—and seeing what my paperclip helper will do next.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve really been trying with Starfield! I want to experience the space adventure that&#x27;s been lauded by some critics as a 10/10 masterpiece, and by Bethesda as the most important RPG ever made. But I&#x27;m struggling, folks. I&#x27;m really struggling.
You see, I&#x27;d hoped Starfield&#x27;s side quests would be a bit more fun than collecting magic space rocks. But basically every side hustle I&#x27;ve tackled have all been the equivalents of early MMO fodder and I&#x27;m so tired of them.

                              <span>Malenia, Blade of Miquella, is a menace. Even among Elden Ring’s cast of bastard-hard bosses, the Goddess of Rot distinguishes herself as an ender of lives, a relentless steel tempest that has shredded the most prepared and dextrous of adventurers. She’s also been beaten, rather soundly, by a man using only his mouth.

Or, to be more precise, a QuadStick FPS, a specialised game controller comprised of a mouth-operated joystick and several &#x27;sip and puff&#x27; switches. It’s the favoured tool of professional streamer and Guinness World Record holder Rocky &quot;RockyNoHands&quot; Stoutenburgh, who in 2022 used it to become the first quadriplegic Elden Ring player to claim Malenia’s scalp. This was a win for a QuadStick as well: a showcase of how adaptive hardware and clever controller design could make games more accessible than ever, enabling players with disabilities to match and exceed the heroics of their able-bodied peers. And yet, there’s little sense – among disabled players, advocacy groups, or even controller manufacturers – that accessible hardware is entering its golden age. While major breakthroughs have been made, high prices and commercial concerns still carry the threat of willing, eager players being left behind.

                              <span>The polished-up 2.0 update for Cyberpunk 2077 is out now, ahead of its Phantom Liberty expansion on September 26th. I’ve been trying out both, partly to see if the 2.0 newly raised hardware requirement of SSD storage is a warning worth heeding.


Hard lines against hard drive installations are new to PC games, but it was only a couple of weeks ago when Starfield showed the dangers of crossing them. Broken audio, regular freeze-ups, load times so long you could measure them with a calendar...  an SSD really is the only way to play Starfield, and it sounded like Cyberpunk 2077 would follow suit. &quot;We advise against running the game on an HDD (or on a SD card on Steam Deck) due to lower bandwidth which may cause new content to not stream properly,&quot; reads CD Projekt Red’s 2.0 patch notes. That’s us told.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been a clear decade since the last entry in this co-op crimeathon FPS series, so I was interested to play Payday 3. Payday is exactly the sort of online multiplayer I can get behind: PvE with clear but theoretically malleable goals (theft!). But although compared to Crime Boss: Rockay City it&#x27;s a crushing 60st monster truck tyre, Payday 3 isn&#x27;t really reinventing the Payday 2 wheel. In some respects you might think it&#x27;s rolling backwards, and while dedicated Payday 2 players may well switch over to the current gen iteration, you get the sense they&#x27;ll be complaining about things the whole time.

Wētā Workshop and Private Division have announced Tales of the Shire, a &quot;heart-warming&quot; experience that will release on PC in 2024. I&#x27;ve got a live action trailer for you, in which a young person doodles pictures of Hobbits, while seated at a desk intriguingly strewn with modern appliances such as laptops and assorted Lord of the Rings paraphernalia. The book she&#x27;s doodling in contains sketches of celebrated locations such as the Green Dragon pub in Bywater, and there are drawings of dolls, Hobbit-holes and onions. Take a peek!

The CMA blocked the deal in April this year over concerns that it would &quot;alter the future of the fast-growing cloud gaming market&quot;, and might lead &quot;to reduced innovation and less choice for UK gamers over the years to come&quot;. Microsoft attempted to woo the regulator by agreeing to sell Activision Blizzard game cloud streaming rights to Ubisoft, and while the CMA have &quot;limited residual concerns&quot;, they&#x27;ve largely accepted Microsoft&#x27;s modifications.

Alas, it comes too late for the Wood Elf Druid I rolled during my first try at the 1.0 version. I wanted her to look like a sort of Kung Fu Galadriel, with cool tattoos and aerodynamic scars, but she emerged from the character creator looking like she&#x27;d been mugged by a packet of demon crayons. I&#x27;ve left my active character, a High Elf Sorceress, safely tattoo-less.

                              <span>With Mortal Kombat 1 on the horizon, we&#x27;re revisiting the entry that set the series on its current trajectory: 2011&#x27;s Mortal Kombat (aka MK 9). Join us today on Twitch at 2:00 p.m. Central as we take a bloody journey through the game&#x27;s genre-defining story campaign. Episodes will be uploaded to our Game Informer Shows YouTube channel the following Saturday morning. 
After 2006&#x27;s Mortal Kombat: Armageddon seemingly concluded the franchise&#x27;s main narrative, 2011&#x27;s entry picked up the bloody pieces. It moved the saga forward by resetting the timeline, serving as a soft reboot that brought Mortal Kombat back to its 2D fighting roots and ushering in the return of the classic roster. MK 9&#x27;s cinematic story mode served as an epiphany for the series and fighting games as a whole, establishing the blueprint for narrative fighting campaigns still utilized today. MK9&#x27;s story also serves as the first chapter of the modern trilogy of games that Mortal Kombat 1 builds upon. For a whole lot more on MK9 and its development, you can read this feature on how the reboot saved the franchise.
Join editors Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard as they battle their way through MK 9 to see how its reimagined tournament holds up.

                              <span>Tales of the Shire is a cozy new game set in The Lord of the Rings universe and it&#x27;s coming out sometime next year. Developed by Wētā Workshop, the New Zealand-based special effects and props company that worked on Peter Jackson&#x27;s Lord of the Rings movie trilogy, and published by Private Division, Tales of the Shire promises to let players live their best cozy Hobbit life. 
Private Division revealed little about the game with its announcement yesterday, although it did release a teaser trailer that captures the vibes of living on The Shire. Check out the Tales of the Shire teaser trailer for yourself below: 


&quot;Your cosy Hobbit life awaits in Tales of the Shire, a heart-warming new Lord of the Rings game by Wētā Workshop and Private Division,&quot; the teaser&#x27;s YouTube description reads. &quot;Coming 2024.&quot; 
And that&#x27;s all we know about the game. Here&#x27;s hoping we learn more soon because it sounds like a great premise. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer&#x27;s review of The Lord of the Rings: Gollum.

                              <span>Last month, Microsoft submitted a new deal to the U.K.&#x27;s Competition and Markets Authority regulatory agency that proposes Ubisoft get the rights to Activision Blizzard game streaming for 15 years. Microsoft did this to get its acquisition of Activision Blizzard approved by the CMA after the regulator previously blocked it over cloud gaming concerns. One month later, the CMA has granted preliminary approval to Microsoft due to its new Ubisoft deal. 
The CMA says it has &quot;identified limited residual concerns with the new deal&quot; but that Microsoft has put forward remedies (see: Ubisoft&#x27;s role) that the CMA &quot;has provisionally concluded should address these issues.&quot; The CMA is now consulting on those remedies before making a final official decision ahead of the October 18 deadline to do so.

It only took just over a week for Unity to make changes to its brand new Runtime Fee policy, but that&#x27;s exactly what it has done.
Announcing the changes in an open letter published today on the Unity Blog (shared on social media), the revamped model includes some pretty sweeping changes from the initial policy. Unity Create lead Marc Whitten started the letter off with an apology, acknowledging that &quot;We should have spoken with more of you and we should have incorporated more of your feedback&quot; before making last week&#x27;s announcement.

On May 12th, 2023, I, like countless other Switch owners, booted up The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom almost as soon as I was physically able and dove headfirst — quite literally, it seemed — back into the world of Hyrule.

Being one of the most recognisable and influential figures in gaming, it should come as no surprise that Masahiro Sakurai has managed to accumulate a number of extremely rare collectibles over the years.
In his latest YouTube &#x27;Grab Bag&#x27; video, the legendary game designer has taken a bit of a different approach to his usual content, opting to showcase some of the most rare antiques in his collection; items that simply would never become available to the general public thanks to their unique features.

Nintendo has just released a brand new overview trailer for Super Mario Bros. Wonder, which does exactly what it says it&#x27;s going to do — go over the game&#x27;s features.
Now, if you were around for the Super Mario Bros. Wonder Direct at the beginning of the month, you might be getting a bit of déjà vu here, and that&#x27;s because this trailer is pretty much a distilled version of what we got then. There are a few new locations and levels on show, but this is a digested version of what the Direct gave us.

We have taken a look at the YouTube channel Macho Nacho Productions a few times on Nintendo Life (remember the world&#x27;s smallest GameCube and the &#x27;thicc boi SP&#x27;?), but we were particularly interested in the channel&#x27;s latest video, which saw a Switch OLED get converted into a dedicated home console, and run a lot cooler in the process.
In the video (above), Tito from Macho Nacho showcased the TVii Switch Re-Shell Mod (working title), created by a modder called Set. This build converts a standard Switch into a dedicated home console, removing the chance for handheld play, but letting the system run much cooler in the process. The casing even works on Switch consoles without a working display — making handheld play impossible from the get-go.

Open-world tactical RPG Wartales will be getting a patch on Switch &quot;next week (at the latest)!&quot; to fix a number of bugs and issues with the game, developer and publisher Shiro Unlimited announced.
The game was announced and released on Switch during last week&#x27;s Nintendo Direct, and while many were initially delighted with the reveal, many have reported major technical issues with the game, including frequent crashes, the inability to pick up or throw out items, and framerate stuttering.

These days, Monolith Soft is well known for being one of Nintendo’s finest internal teams, with the Xenoblade Chronicles games delivering some of the finest open-world JRPG goodness available. Long before the company was acquired by Nintendo, however, some of the first projects it produced were the two Baten Kaitos games, both of which were originally created to address the lack of RPGs on the GameCube. Unfortunately, neither title sold very well, but they’ve now been given a second lease on life on modern hardware with Baten Kaitos I &amp; II HD Remaster. Though neither of these games prove to be exceptional, they’re still enjoyable refreshes of an interesting phase in Monolith’s past and stand as welcome additions to the Switch&#x27;s enormous RPG library.
The narratives of both games here — Eternal Wings and the Lost Ocean (2003) and Origins (2006) — are related, though just isolated enough that you can play either release first without feeling like you’re missing out too much on important context. Baten Kaitos follows a somewhat unlikeable protagonist named Kalas, a self-interested sellsword who is hellbent on getting revenge for the deaths of his brother and grandpa. Early on in this quest, however, he inadvertently releases an old seal placed on the God of Destruction, Malpercio, kicking off a race to get to the other seals before the evil Alfard Empire can use them to fully unleash chaos across the world.

With Super Mario Bros. Wonder out in, hang on... *checks notes*... less than a month on October 20th, 2023, you&#x27;ve probably already started to browse a number of outlets in search of the best deal.
Well, this one may take some beating. While the RRP for the game is £49.99, Currys is currently offering up Super Mario Bros. Wonder at £37.49 if you apply a &#x27;WONDER25&#x27; code to the game during the checkout process. That&#x27;s a pretty darn good deal!

Over at the Tokyo Game Show this week, Japanese hardware firm Tassei Denki has been showing off some hardware prototypes that could potentially give us a glimpse into the near future. One of these is of particular interest to us and appears to be a new concept for the Nintendo 3DS.
The two units on display are powered by Ryzen and are presumably emulating 3DS titles for the purposes of the demonstration. They both boast 6-inch screens with a 1080p AMOLED display and are capable of running games at 90Hz.

Now, we don&#x27;t actually know all that much about this one for the moment — the above teaser is more of a title reveal than anything else — though the following description from the Tales of the Shire website has us thinking that this might not be quite as action-packed as many of the LotR games that we have seen in the past:

Development on Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak officially wrapped some time ago, and now it seems Capcom is gearing up for a big 20th anniversary, which will take place in March 2024.
As part of its Tokyo Game Show 2023 online program, the Japanese video game company shared a new piece of anniversary artwork featuring what appears to be a brand new hunter alongside hunters from past entries in the series. It&#x27;s also released a new logo (thanks, Siliconera).

The title will be released on 29th September and follows four titles that were added to the service earlier this month on the SNES, NES and Game Boy. Here&#x27;s a bit about HAL Labratory&#x27;s 2004 release, which also contains both local and online support thanks to the Switch Online service.

                              <span>Sites subjected to a DMCA takedown notice should consider removing the content in question or contesting the claim. But consider this scenario. To reduce piracy, Google accepts DMCA takedown notices for URLs that don&#x27;t yet exist in its indexes. So what happens if you receive a &#x27;future piracy&#x27; notice that&#x27;s clearly bogus? A DMCA counter notice won&#x27;t work; they&#x27;re talking about things you haven&#x27;t even done yet.

To substantiate their claim in a Japanese lawsuit, the publishers took a detour through a U.S. court that recently granted a subpoena, requiring Google and Cloudflare to share traffic stats and other personal data.

                              <span>AMD&#x27;s RX 7800 XT is one of their best graphics cards in years, offering a genuine boost in performance over the competing RTX 4070 with FSR 3 Frame Generation tech on the way. These cards are meant to start at £499, but as with all GPUs to get a good review prices on most models are far higher - so it&#x27;s nice to see an Ebay 10% off code that brings these models back to down to the price of a base unit. Today you can pick up the Sapphire RX 7800 XT Pure in white for £499 using code COLLECT10 when you buy from Ebuyer via Ebay.

                              <span>I love creative tools in videogames, from drawing Worms levels in Deluxe Paint to optimising r_speeds in Half-Life maps to using Minecraft worlds to generate 3D renders. That love has only been amplified by having a kid whose first instinct in any game is to create his own character, unit, level - whatever is available.

The best creative games inspire that creativity by having some innate flavour of their own, though. Some personality that inspires you to lean in, or nudge it in some other direction. By comparison, the new trailer for Everywhere, seems like metaversal porridge.

The information is designed so that developers can opt-in to have their games included, and plan for the year ahead. But if you&#x27;re looking to buy a boatload of games, you might also want to plan when based on potential discounts.

Valve have now announced the relevant dates for the first four months of 2024.

                              <span>This week we wrote some articles about the hilariously comprehensive Microsoft leaks, and Alice0 wrote one in particular about Bethesda&#x27;s plans to not remaster Morrowind. It is, she points out, understandable why the sanitised Bethesda of today would leave well enough alone: &quot;2002&#x27;s Elder Scrolls game is an overambitious, odd, scrappy, and spiky beast. It is a game happy to leave you lost, confused, misunderstanding, weirded-out, frustrated, and stuck.&quot;
Yet, Morrowind is loved! And in the comments of that article Nic Rueben mentioned the demo for Ardenfall, an RPG with no release date but a Steam demo. So off I toddled to have a look, and though I haven&#x27;t played much of it yet, I&#x27;m confident in saying that if you liked Morrowind you should check the demo out.

But what we really want to talk about is intellectual property rights! Bill Willingham, the man who came up with Fables (the IP that brought you The Wolf Among Us) declared via. blog post that he&#x27;s making Fables a public domain property. What does that mean? Can we all just make Fables video games now? And what can we do with Sherlock holmes?

                              <span>Paradox Interactive and new indie team C-Prompt have announced their debut 4X strategy game Millennia, which I got to play for an hour at this year&#x27;s Gamescom. With development being led by former Irrational Games co-founder Robert Fermier and Age Of Empires II lead designer Ian M Fischer, Millennia will see you attempting that classic quad of Xs across ten distinct historical ages, starting in the Stone Age before eventually ending up in a &quot;post-modern future&quot;, designer Ben Friedman tells me. 
The twist here, however, is that you&#x27;ve also got what C-Prompt are calling &#x27;Variant Ages&#x27;, which let you bend the timeline to your will. Some of these variants are more historical in nature, such as an Age Of Monuments where everyone&#x27;s building Egyptian pyramids, Friedman explains, while others are more fantastical, with the words steampunk, alchemy and space alien invasions all mentioned in the same sentence. I had a good time with it during my demo, but the real delight was seeing my home army of Kyoto go and invade neighbouring settlement Telford, before going on to conquer Rome - as you do. So if historical melting pots are your kind of 4X jam, read on.

                              <span>Cyberpunk 2077&#x27;s Phantom Liberty expansion is attracting very positive reviews, and CD Projekt staff are naturally quite pleased about this. And also, very relieved. Released in 2020, the original Cyberpunk 2077 stands as an uncommonly thunderous example of overhype and project mismanagement, with technical issues at launch that extended from comical bugs such as disappearing penises to serious breaches such as graphical effects capable of triggering epileptic fits. CD Projekt have spent years attempting to address the underlying systemic and workplace issues and claw back some goodwill - hence, the general atmosphere on Xitter of developers needing to take five and stare at a flowerbed for a while. &quot;It was a rough few years but there&#x27;s finally celebration and closure (for me at least),&quot; posted senior level designer Seb Mcbride.

                              <span>Ellis Tucci grew up playing games like Thief, System Shock, and Deus Ex. Now she&#x27;s making an immersive sim of her own. It&#x27;s called Spectra, and it&#x27;s set in the US in an alt-history 1972 where Soviet Union is the dominant military power after President Roosevelt was deposed in a fascist coup. You play as a Soviet agent tasked with infiltrating and fomenting revolution in a fortress city called Hiwatha.
Tucci wants Spectra to meet the criteria players will expect from an immersive sim. &quot;To me, the immersive sim is the platonic ideal of the video game&quot; she says. &quot;I&#x27;ve tried to deliver on that immersion by creating an environment that is extremely interactable and flexible in the ways it can be used.&quot; She explains that &quot;a quite frankly silly proportion of the buildings in each map are enterable and that &quot;you can turn off the lights, set traps, and use things like televisions, radios, or payphones as lures.&quot;


It sounds like everything immersive sim fans want. But there&#x27;s one big difference between Spectra and the games that inspired it. Tucci is making it on her own. And she isn&#x27;t the only indie developer working in one of the most ambitious, developmentally complex genres in the industry. Games like Shadows Of Doubt, Fallen Aces and Gloomwood are merely the steam rising from the bubbling magma chamber that is indie immersive sim development, Like the recent revival of retro shooters, the indie space is on the verge of an immersive sim eruption.

                              <span>After the closure of original developers Troika, a long-awaited sequel announcement, delays and layoffs at Hardsuit, a secret change of studio (which led to further layoffs at Hardsuit), preorder refunds and the belated reveal that a developer best known for (very good) non-combat narrative experiences would be taking the reins, the only thing I really want to hear about Vampire: The Masquerade Bloodlines 2 is that it’s definitely, absolutely going to reach the finish line. There are actual vampires that come back from the dead less often. But I&#x27;m piqued nonetheless by Chinese Room studio design director Alex Skidmore’s thoughts on how this Seattle-set World of Darkness action-RPG adaptation will differentiate itself from other games in the genre, and especially, how it will put its vampiric premise to use.

                              <span>The Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 &quot;no possibility left unpossible&quot; choice-and-consequence train continues with the revelation that, if you break up with a lover in the game, you can slowly repair the relationship and spark a bit of your old chemistry. This might not sound earthshattering to anybody from outside the videogame world - what are you doing here? Run along and watch your silly non-interactive movies and TV shows - but it&#x27;s quite novel for a fantasy RPG in the BioWare tradition. In my experience, at least, most RPGs only give you the build-up to a character romance, then flash-freeze the relationship post-consummation, perhaps because you&#x27;ve unlocked a sexy &quot;loyalty&quot; companion ability and the developers don&#x27;t want to take it away from you. Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 is one of the few that thinks about how chemistry  might come and go.

CD Projekt tech support have shared region-specific download availability for the update, together with some advice for new and returning Cyberpunk 2077 players taking the plunge.

Titled Trails through Daybreak, I picked out a talking point from the NISA announcement stream that Trails through Daybreak would be the start of a new story arc, and therefore serve as a decent entry point for new fans. Little did I know that I stepped on a landmine with this comment.


Falcom’s The Legend of Heroes series has become an absolute monster of a work. Technically speaking, The Legend of Heroes dates back to the 80s with Dragon Slayer: The Legend of Heroes. We got this one in English on the Turbografx CD, which is something I’ve been dying to talk about. But to get back on track, what modern gamers usually refer to as “The Legend of Heroes” is actually a bit more sp…</span>

                              <span>Octopath Traveler II is one of the year’s most celebrated RPGs, and now Xbox fans have been invited to join the party. The game is coming to Microsoft’s consoles and Windows PC early next year.
The RPG was first released to PlayStation consoles, Switch, and PC in February. Octopath Traveler II, like its predecessor, sees players guide eight adventurers across a sprawling adventure in an HD-2D rendered world. Though similar on the surface, the sequel has been praised for its improvements in storytelling, character development, progression, and navigation. 
In our review, we scored Octopath Traveler II an 8.5 out of 10, with guest writer Josh Broadwell writing that “Octopath Traveler II does what an excellent sequel should. Instead of breaking new ground left and right, it improves on the original in nearly every way and feels more confident about the stories it tells.”</span>

                              <span>Assassin&#x27;s Creed Nexus VR hits Meta Quest devices in less than two months on November 16. This release date was revealed in a new gameplay trailer from IGN for Assassin&#x27;s Creed Nexus VR, which gives us another look at the game&#x27;s three protagonist assassins: Ezio from Assassin&#x27;s Creed II, Connor from Assassin&#x27;s Creed III, and Kassandra from Assassin&#x27;s Creed Odyssey. 
In the trailer, we get a look at how combat and parkour will work in the game. As expected, given the game is a VR exclusive title, everything happens from a first-person perspective. As Connor, players will explore 18th Century America during the American Revolution. As Ezio, players will parkour through 15th Century Italy during the Italian Renaissance, and as Kassandra, players will fight as a mercenary assassin through ancient Greece. 
Check out the Assassin&#x27;s Creed Nexus VR gameplay trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Assassin&#x27;s Creed Nexus VR looks pretty much exactly as you&#x27;d expect for an Assassin&#x27;s Creed game in VR. All the assassin tropes are still there, fortunately, like leaps of faith, hidden blades, parkour, and more. 
Assassin&#x27;s Creed Nexus VR hits Meta Quest devices on November 16. 
While waiting for its release, check out this Assassin&#x27;s Creed Nexus VR trailer from June and then read our preview after checking out more of the game earlier this summer.

The studio announced this in a new post on Twitter today, linking to a blog discussing the threequel. In it, Ubisoft reveals that Star Wars Outlaws creative director Julian Gerighty will take over as The Division brand&#x27;s executive producer once Outlaws ships. 
Gerighty joined The Division team as an associate creative director in 2014. After Massive shipped the first Division game, Gerighty moved onto Tom Clancy&#x27;s The Division 2 as creative director. As executive producer of the brand, Gerighty will work on The Division 3 and other projects set in The Division universe like Tom Clancy&#x27;s The…</span>

                              <span>Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 is one of the biggest games of the year, but it launched with its fair share of bugs. Luckily, developer Larian Studios has released two major patches to the game, and while the third was set to release today, it&#x27;s been delayed to tomorrow. In a post on X, the site formerly known as Twitter, the developers announced the patch would be delayed &quot;to ensure thorough testing.&quot; This is likely done to avoid the issue they ran into when they had to roll back a hotfix last month.
While we know the patch has been delayed, before now we didn&#x27;t have much of an idea of what that patch included. While specific bug fixes are still unknown, Larian tweeted about a new feature to expect tomorrow: the ability to change your character&#x27;s appearance. This includes details like pronouns, voice actor, and specific facial features, but notably does not allow you to change your race, which could alter the story depending on your choice. 
With Patch 3 comes the Magic Mirror, which lives in your camp and allows you to change your Tav’s appearance whenever you’d like!

Even though the patch plans have been derailed, Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 still launches on Mac today, so if you&#x27;ve been meaning to grab it on that platform, now&#x27;s the chance to do so. We&#x27;d highly recommend it, and you can read about why in our glowing review of the game. If you&#x27;ve been playing the game and enjoying it, maybe it&#x27;s a sign you should try D&amp;D, the game it&#x27;s based on, as well.</span>

                              <span>Ahead of Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth, which we just learned will be released in January, Ryu Ga Gotoku (RGG) Studio will release Like A Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name. Announced in September, The Man Who Erased His Name stars longtime Yakuza series protagonist Kazuma Kiryu and focuses on his life after Yakuza 6: The Song of Life before he appears in Infinite Wealth. And now, thanks to Xbox&#x27;s 2023 Tokyo Game Show broadcast, we know we&#x27;ll be hanging with Kiryu on Xbox Game Pass on the game&#x27;s November 9 launch day.
The Man Who Erased His Name will also hit Windows PC as part of Xbox&#x27;s PC Game Pass program on day one as well. 
Alongside this news, RGG Studio revealed that Like A Dragon: Ishin!, a Yakuza spin-off entry that hit PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 3 in 2013 in Japan (but never came to the West), will hit Game Pass later this year on both Xbox and Windows PC. 
While waiting for these games to hit Game Pass, read Game Informer&#x27;s Like A Dragon: Ishin! review and then check out the latest Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth trailer. After that, read our hands-on preview of Like A Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name.

                              <span>After playing Final Fantasy VII Rebirth for the first time (check out my full impressions here), I then spoke with director Naoki Hamaguchi, producer Yoshinori Kitase, and creative director Tetsuya Nomura to seek answers to some burning questions. That includes how much narrative ground Rebirth covers, the decision behind splitting it between two discs, and if there’s any form of data transfer between Remake and Rebirth.
How Did Rebirth&#x27;s Development Compare To Remake&#x27;s? 
Rebirth launches on February 29, a couple of months shy of Remake’s fourth anniversary.

Datovka Beta se instaluje jako samostatná aplikace s vlastními daty, která neovlivňuje produkční verzi mobilní Datovky.

                              <span>Last time, you decided that capturing enemy buildings is better than hand grenades exploding on impact with enemies?. Can&#x27;t say I disagree. I love a good frag but what&#x27;s even better is capturing your munitions factory and using that to make more grenades to throw at you. Doesn&#x27;t matter if I need to time or cook them if I have an entire production line behind me. This week, I ask you to decide who&#x27;s the boss (baby). What&#x27;s better: setting unit waypoints or receiving waypoints yourself?

You’ll still be able to keep playing for the time being, at least.

                              <span>Prior to joining RPS and coming into a possession of an Actual Contemporary Gaming PC, I did all my gaming on a plucky Erazer laptop from circa 2014. The old warhorse has certainly had some adventures, to the point that it isn&#x27;t really a laptop anymore but a hovering debris cloud of plastic and metal, constellated by strips of sellotape, from which a moving picture may be hesitantly conjured by means of screamed insults and the careful deployment of desk fans. 


Among the sicker jokes I&#x27;ve played on various editors as a freelancer is to review triple-A games on this sorrowing technological Igor, which - I swear to you - physically flinches and begins to whimper frantically when presented with any game more demanding than Far Cry 2. Thing is, I&#x27;m pretty sure I can run Ubisoft&#x27;s forthcoming Assassin&#x27;s Creed: Mirage on this hapless relic. The publisher have released minimum and recommended system specs for their latest historical throat-slitter, and they&#x27;re pretty dang reasonable.

Combined with a 10% Ebay discount that knocks £55 off the price of a unit from MSI, it&#x27;s now possible to grab this GPU for just £490 - around the same price as AMD&#x27;s RX 7800 XT while delivering around 15% better RT performance, while also packing in the frame-rate advantages of DLSS 3 Frame Generation and superior power efficiency.

                              <span>Farming life sims like Stardew Valley remain enduringly popular, and until Stardew dev ConcernedApe&#x27;s Haunted Chocolatier arrives, there are plenty other games popping up like cute life sim mushrooms to horn in on our shared desire for a simpler, more rustic way of life. The route to this in Stardew Valley is actually quite hard, requiring mastery of several different interlocked systems that each ask a level of expertise that, on most days, I cannot be arsed to work towards. I love Stardew Valley, to be clear, but I hold no expectation of ever getting the most out of the farm space alloted to you as a result of your grandfather&#x27;s death.
Fae Farm is a Stardewlike with a fantastical veneer and 3D graphics, but importantly it frontloads progress. It&#x27;s slightly easier, in ways that seem small but cumulatively mean it takes up way less of your brain&#x27;s runtime on bad days. For example: all activities, including watering your crops, use less energy than in Stardew Valley. This means you can run around clearing farm space and gathering resources, and have a working plot in just a couple of days. Heck, you can have a pretty full day in the mines before you&#x27;ve mechanised your farm. Game changer!

The case debuted at $130, but spikes in demand pushed it north of $150 at many retailers. Today things are swinging the other way, as Newegg has knocked $20 off its MSRP to bring it to $110.

                              <span>Cyberpunk 2077&#x27;s triumph was that it offered a sprawling story, dozens of hours long, which cohered around just a small number of themes. Or maybe even a single thesis: that the cynical, defensive, self-centred voice in your head - personified by ancient, soul-trapped, anarcho-rockstar Johnny Silverhand - offered only a literal dead-end, and that real rebellion in the face of a messed-up world lay in helping friends. It was Frank Capra with robot arms and samurai swords, and I ate it up.
V doesn&#x27;t go to Washington in Phantom Liberty, but Washington comes to her. CD Projekt Red&#x27;s major expansion to the first-person RPG opens up a new district and a new cast of characters, including the President of the New United States and an aging sleeper spy played by Idris Elba. The themes remain the same, but the thesis is being tested: how can you help your friends if you don&#x27;t know who they are, and if their goals are mutually exclusive?

                              <span>Spencer Yan&#x27;s My Work Is Not Yet Done is a narrative-driven investigative horror game that combines elements of the survival and simulation genres with a plot exploring &quot;the imbrication and dissolution of human identities/meanings within uncanny wilderness&quot;, to quote the project&#x27;s Github page. It follows the final days of Avery, last surviving member of a doomed hunt for the source of a strange transmission, and sees you performing complex acts of maintenance upon environmental sensors, while picking through journals and other found documents so as to &quot;to discern the most viable &#x27;truth&#x27; behind both Avery&#x27;s mission and the signal itself&quot;. 


It&#x27;s all wrapped up in a dense, warping two-tone aesthetic with shifting naturalistic sounds that makes my breath catch in my chest. I love everything I&#x27;ve seen and heard about Yan&#x27;s game, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever done it justice in writing, and I doubt today&#x27;s efforts will address this. For you see, what I&#x27;d like to call your attention to right now is the game&#x27;s complex recreation of shitting.

It&#x27;s &quot;by far the biggest expansion Stardock has ever made&quot;, according to company founder Brad Wardell, who claims this latest dollop of interstellar tyranny will &quot;transform the gameplay in ways not seen in a 4X game before&quot;. By which he chiefly means that the Supernova Edition uses large language learning models to generate civ backstories on demand. Let&#x27;s dig in!

                              <span>Among the chunkier morsels from yesterday&#x27;s leak of Microsoft documents is an extended email from Xbox CEO Phil Spencer, dating from 2020, in which he argues that today&#x27;s largest AAA videogame publishers remain dogged by their &quot;failure&quot; to adapt to the shift from physical to digital videogame distribution, and especially, subscription models such as Microsoft&#x27;s own Game Pass. This inability to move with the times, Spencer suggests, has created a situation whereby the largest publishers rely on sheer &quot;production scale&quot; to attract and retain customers. 


In turn, this has meant that publishers are unwilling to bet on new IPs - it could be billions down the drain, after all. Instead, &quot;AAA publishers are milking their top franchises but struggling to refill their portfolio of hit franchises&quot;, while relying on &quot;rented&quot; IPs such as Star Wars. This is an older email, of course, and there&#x27;s an obvious element of self-flattery in the shape of Microsoft talking up Game Pass. Still, it&#x27;s a persuasive account of recent industry history, bolstered by Spencer&#x27;s notes from conversations with Assassin&#x27;s Creed outfit Ubisoft and GTA publisher Take-Two Interactive in particular.

Kiryu&#x27;s back and in a battle with his biggest adversary yet. And you can become an unhinged Pokémon master, among many, many other things. We&#x27;re so back. We&#x27;re so effing back.

It doesn&#x27;t mean the game is completely done – Insomniac will continue to update the game and bug squash in the coming weeks and months – but the version that you will be able to play when the game releases October 20 is ready.
To celebrate the news, the game&#x27;s cast celebrated by shouting and throwing their hands in the air among other celebrations.

                              <span>In an announcement I personally never could have predicted, the 2001 PlayStation 2 Capcom video game Onimusha: Warlords (and subsequent sequels) is getting an anime adaption for Netflix. The reveal is surprising for a number of reasons. The franchise is not one that is particularly well-known or currently popular. Also, the anime seems to have little to do with the original game. Protagonist Samanosuke Akechi does not make an appearance in the trailer. But, like Samanosuke, who was modeled after Japanese actor Kaneshiro Takeshi, the anime&#x27;s protagonist, Miyamoto Musashi, is modeled after the late Japanese actor Toshiro Mifune. Coincidentally, Onimusha 2&#x27;s protagonist, Jubei Yagyu, was modeled after Japanese actor Yūsaku Matsuda, who had also passed away well before the game released. It&#x27;s an odd throughline for the series but is a key element.
The other surprise for the adaptation is it is being co-directed by Takashi Miike. Miike is known for films like Ichi The Killer and Audition, but he also has another big Capcom franchise under his directorial belt with Ace Attorney, a film adaption of the Phoenix Wright games.
I played Onimusha for the first time in earnest when it released on Switch and enjoyed revisiting it and finally beating it. You can find more of my thoughts on that topic here.


The anime premieres November 2 on Netflix.</span>

Since its disastrous launch in 2020, developer CD Projekt Red has delivered critical updates to Cyberpunk 2077 to align it more closely to the original vision, but Phantom Liberty, coupled with the free Update 2.0, is its biggest yet. This new expansion trades in the high-octane mercenary vibes of Cyberpunk 2077 for a more subdued spy thriller, and offers a well-made trove of new ways to experience Night City. The expansion features a great cast of personalities, all well-performed, even if some are underused. Interacting wi…</span>

                              <span>Sega and Like a Dragon series developer Ryu Ga Gotoku (RGG) Studio held a presentation this morning sharing all kinds of new details for its upcoming games, Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth and Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name.
First up, it shared a 10-minute story trailer for Infinite Wealth, which shared so many details that I am hesitant to write them all here in fear of spoiling potentially major plot beats in the game. The summary is that Ichiban Kasuga is offered the opportunity to find his mother, which means he must travel to Honolulu, Hawaii. Returning characters make an appearance, Ichiban will apparently be fighting sharks and giant squids, taking part in fun Hawaii activities like surfing, and, expectedly, will be getting into all kinds of trouble with the local gangs. Kazamu Kiryu&#x27;s role also gets somewhat defined in the trailer.


Some details not in the trailer include the fact that the playable party now has full freedom of movement while fighting, allowing for more strategy. The game includes a Crazy Taxi-inspired minigame, among many other money-making opportunities. Actors Danny Trejo (Machete) and Daniel Dae Kim (Lost) will also be playing Dwight, the leader of the Barracudas gang, and Masataka Ebina, the ruthless captain of the local yakuza syndicate, respectively. You can check out some additional screenshots for the game below.

Alongside the story trailer, there is also a five-minute gameplay trailer.


Arguably, the biggest news from the event, however, is Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth&#x27;s release date, which isn&#x27;t far off. The game releases January 26 on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, Xbox One, and PC. Preorders for the game will net you the Hero’s Booster Pack, to level up faster, and a Special Job Set that includes the Linebacker and Tennis Ace jobs.
Alongside all the Infinite Wealth details, Sega and RGG also released the full opening cinematic for Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name, which you can watch below.</span>

                              <span>Development of new content for Evil Dead: The Game has ceased, developer Saber Interactive has announced. The game’s planned Switch version has also been canceled.
In a statement posted to X (formerly known as Twitter), Saber explains that despite only releasing the game last May, it’s effectively moving on from it. Saber doesn&#x27;t give a reason behind the decision, but states that it still plans to fix any major bugs and will keep the servers running “for the foreseeable future.” Check out its full statement below. 
Evil Dead: The Game is an asymmetrical multiplayer game set within the popular film universe where players control Ash and his friends to survive against a player-controlled Kandarian Demon. We weren’t particularly enamored with the title at launch, with video editor Alex Van Aken scoring the game a 6 out of 10, writing in his review, &quot;It’s incredibly one-sided for a game all about two sides. And it’s majorly unbalanced.&quot; You can watch a team of editors tackle the game in this episode of New Gameplay Today.</span>

News of police raids at two French datacenters followed shortly after. According to an early report, a French court authorized the operation in response to a complaint filed by major Hollywood studios, StudioCanal, Apple and Amazon.

                              <span>Earlier this morning, various Xbox and Microsoft documents leaked online: emails, in-development plans, internal details, and more. It&#x27;s how we learned Xbox head Phil Spencer considered acquiring Nintendo and Warner Bros. Games at one point, that Xbox is planning an Xbox Series X/S refresher for next year, that it might be working on remasters of Fallout 3 and The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, and that Microsoft has plans for a next-gen hybrid console in 2028. 
The leaks were quite extensive, and after some online confusion, we learned via Bloomberg that Microsoft accidentally provided federal courts with confidential (and not redacted) documents. Following news of these leaks, Spencer has now addressed what’s happened with a brief statement on Twitter. 
We&#x27;ve seen the conversation around old emails and documents. It is hard to see our team&#x27;s work shared in this way because so much has changed and there&#x27;s so much to be excited about right now, and in the future. We will share the real plans when we are ready.
September 19, 2023
He shared that on Twitter, but The Verge has obtained a more in-depth memo sent to Xbox employees. Here it is, in full: 
Something of note, especially for those particularly excited about something that might have leaked today, is that in both the internal memo to Xbox employees and the public-facing statement posted to Twitter, Spencer says these leaked documents and email are old and plans have changed. He also says the team will share &quot;the real plans&quot; when ready. Now, he obviously can&#x27;t say the leaked information is what&#x27;s happening and must downplay it as a result, but it&#x27;s also a reminder to take everything that has come to light with a grain of salt because it&#x27;s very likely plans have changed.

                              <span>Microsoft and Xbox appeared in court earlier this year over its $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard. Various previously unseen documents from those court proceedings have leaked, revealing Xbox head Phil Spencer considered acquiring Nintendo and Warner Bros. Games at one point, an Xbox Series X/S refresh and a new Xbox controller planned for 2024, and potential remasters of Fallout 3 and The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. Another leaked document details the company&#x27;s plans for a next-gen hybrid console in 2028, as reported by The Verge.

                              <span>Microsoft and Xbox representatives appeared in court earlier this year to get its $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard legally greenlit. Per usual court proceedings, various emails, documents, and more were sealed away from the public and press, but many unseen documents leaked this morning. It&#x27;s how we learned Xbox head Phil Spencer considered acquiring Nintendo and Warner Bros. Games at one point, and that Microsoft is planning an Xbox Series X/S refresh with a new controller for next year. Other documents point to potential remasters of Fallout 3 and The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, alongside other games. 
More specifically, a &quot;ZeniMax Management Forecast&quot; document details plans for various games, including the aforementioned remasters of Fallout 3 and Oblivion, alongside a potential sequel to 2022’s Ghostwire: Tokyo and a third installment in Arkane&#x27;s Dishonored series.
You can take a look at the document for yourself below (credit to Game Pass Tracker on Twitter):

As you can see, this document mentions other games we know about, like Machine Games&#x27; Indiana Jones project, 2021&#x27;s Deathloop, and the recently released Starfield. 
It also mentions The Elder Scrolls VI, which we just learned will launch no earlier than 2026 and will not launch on Sony&#x27;s PlayStation 5. 
It&#x27;s important to note that this leaked document is over three years old, so it&#x27;s safe to assume plans have changed and that this schedule likely does not represent the company&#x27;s current plans.

Xbox and Microsoft spent a lot of time this year in courts working to get its purchase of Activision Blizzard legally approved, and many documents were sealed away from the public and press during these proceedings. However, various unseen documents from those court proceedings have leaked. One email reveals Xbox head Phil Spencer was considering an acquisition of Mario maker Nintendo and Mortal Kombat 1 publisher Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment (now known as Warner Bros. Games) at one point.

                              <span>Lies of P is finally out for everyone. It’s a tough game – it’s a Soulslike, after all – and will test your skills in various ways. Bosses will enrage you, hidden secrets will delight you, and even the weakest puppet enemies will get the best of you sometimes. But we’ve beaten the game with more than 40 hours in it and have some tips we think will help you, Pinocchio, Geppetto, and everyone else survive the nightmare city that is Krat and its surrounding areas.

Perfect The Perfect Guard
On paper, Lies of P is very much going for a Bloodborne style, and while that&#x27;s true mechanically and narratively, there&#x27;s a lot of Sekiro in it, too, specifically with guarding. To guard against an enemy attack, press the left bumper. If you simply hold guard, you will take a l…</span>

If you&#x27;re not, I need to stress that this is not a bit and I am not being ironic. The kids&#x27; cartoon that Rolling Stone named the 96th best sitcom of all time really is that good.

Now it&#x27;s getting a video game.

The past decade of innumerable remasters has been boring enough, but remastering these two games is particularly boring. When even bother when all Bethesda have made since Oblivion is Oblivion remakes with added spacesuits or yelling? Boring. But while I think the torrent of remasters is a miserable sign of big publishers just giving up, if they&#x27;re going to do it anyway: why not Morrowind?

Scumhead&#x27;s Franzen - released a few days ago on Steam and Itch - has a couple of big draws, straight off the bat. Firstly and least importantly, it&#x27;s free, which it really shouldn&#x27;t be. Secondly and more significantly, it&#x27;s one of those rare RPG miniatures that is both richly imagined and snappy, with a busy and befuddling world in which you have immediate clear motivations that escalate rapidly and breed Dire Implications. It also looks like a 16-bit Pathologic, so consider me firmly on board.

                              <span>At first glance, Lies Of P looks like a wannabe Bloodborne reskin, replacing the Gothic edges of Yarnham with a twisted version of a kid&#x27;s fairytale. There are silhouettes in windows sheltering from an infection that&#x27;s plagued the populace and puppets who&#x27;ve gone awol. Take damage and you&#x27;ve got a chance to recoup the costs by smacking the baddie back. There&#x27;s a bit where you platform down a large well, thin planks of wood marking your descent. Survive and you might want to visit your doll-like maiden and spend your souls.
But is Lies Of P just another boring pretender to Bloodborne? No! I think it&#x27;s worked with its Gothic Pinocchio theme remarkably well, and the option to snap and configure your puppet lad to your liking makes its journey feel distinct. Sure, Lies Of P might lack some of the presence of its main inspiration, and not all of its parts come together to form a cohesive whole, but the game is an undeniable must for Soulslikers who crave the dark. It&#x27;s perhaps the closest any Soulslike has felt to a FromSoft game, in everything from its presentation to the cadence of your character&#x27;s jog.

                              <span>I dunno if you&#x27;ve heard of this game Starfield, but there&#x27;s a lot of talk about it at the moment. It is a roleplaying experience where the role you play is not &quot;Viking-ish warrior who can shout with the power of a million metal frontmen&quot; or &quot;wasteland wanderer downing cans of irradiated coke&quot; but &quot;person in space following a broadly unexciting A-plot&quot;. Much of the most interesting stuff in Starfield is on the periphery of the main story, as is the case with most Bethesda RPGs, but I find Starfield to be much less whimsical (something I won&#x27;t relitigate here). As an RPG, Starfield is taking itself seriously, and sometimes this collides with the design game systems and menus.
An example of this is that you are supposed to experience the vastness of space, but cannot do so without going through a lot of loading screens. Another is that you have two sets of clothes: a spacesuit for places that are hostile and have no breathable atmosphere, and street clothes for planets that do. And NPCs keep making fun of me for wearing my spacesuit when I don&#x27;t need to, and I hate them for it.

                              <span>Overnight, in what Edwin called an &quot;unredacted document oopsie&quot; related to Microsoft trying to buy ActiBlizz, two things have been revealed that interest me. Well, three. Firstly, Phil Spencer capitalises &quot;Gaming&quot;, which I hate. Secondly, as noted in that linked story, Phil Spencer wants to buy Nintendo and, in pitying also-ran brackets, Valve, which has some of the same energy as me walking into an estate agent and demanding a six bedroom house with a new fitted kitchen and a hidden library. And thirdly, according to a release schedule from a presentation dated 2020, Bethesda and Zenimax have planned out their next few years of games in depressing MCU presentation-style. Boy, are the next couple of years going to be whelming.
As is predictable now, it is largely a list of sequels and remasters, many of them dated quite optimistically, it must be said. This document pegs Starfield for 2021, for example, and obviously that didn&#x27;t happen. There are also two unnamed games on there for this year (Projects Kestrel and Platinum; 2021&#x27;s Project Hibiki we know refers to the surprise-released Hi-Fi Rush) and it seems unlikely they&#x27;re going to appear before the end of the year. We know The Elder Scrolls 6 isn&#x27;t coming for at least another five years. They&#x27;re going to remaster Oblivion (but not Morrowind, the weird cousin everyone else likes most, but whose parents aren&#x27;t sure what job to give them in 2023). And they&#x27;re going to make Dishonored 3. I&#x27;m excited about that! But also fearful.

                              <span>Readers, I have a confession to make. I might have to stop playing Starfield. Not because its main story quests are intensely boring and repetitive. And not because its planets are all mostly dull, lifeless husks. It&#x27;s mainly because wherever I go in the universe, I&#x27;m haunted by the fleshy spectre of a misshapen man. I&#x27;m not even talking about the adoring fan (though he does also stalk my every step, too). Rather, I&#x27;m alluding to my own in-game father, who&#x27;s randomly generated face and features are so utterly horrifying to me that I do a little sick in my mouth every time I run into him. Who can blame me, honestly, when his mouth is so high it clips right through his goddamn nose?

                              <span>As you&#x27;ve hopefully read elsewhere on here, there&#x27;s been an overnight windfall of insider info about Microsoft&#x27;s long-term gaming biz objectives, thanks to documents accidentally released by the US Federal Trading Commission during its court case against Microsoft&#x27;s Activision-Blizzard acquisition. We&#x27;ve learned that Microsoft are still rather keen on buying Nintendo (and Valve), and that the company had planned out the release of Dishonored 3, an Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion remaster and a Ghostwire: Tokyo sequel during the run-up to its acquisition of ZeniMax. 


The leaked documents also include extensive internal pitch and presentation materials regarding Microsoft&#x27;s first-party gaming operations all the way to 2030. We can apparently expect a mid-generation Xbox console refresh, code-named Brooklin, in 2024; more intriguing, from a PC gaming perspective, is the promise of a 2028-bound &quot;hybrid&quot; Xbox platform, which will centre on a &quot;thin client&quot; OS that runs cloud-based games on “&lt; $99”, &quot;consumer or handheld&quot; devices. Oh no, it&#x27;s the power of the cloud all over again.

                              <span>I am in control of the RPS Game Club this month, so therefore I can do whatever I want - and this time I&#x27;m delving into the world of Hypnospace Outlaw&#x27;s music. No other game sounds like Hypnospace. Featuring a veritable mountain of tracks (most of which was composed by the game&#x27;s creator, Jay Tholen), Hypnospace’s extensive catalogue stretches across genres both real and imaginary. While Seepage’s Nothing Left For Me is a clear pastiche of Linkin Park, Fre3zer’s Icy Girl is a purposefully poor attempt to mimic Coolpunk, a genre built upon remixes of a jingle for a discontinued soda brand. The most exciting thing about Hypnospace is that its soundtrack is so dense and complex that there&#x27;s opportunity to hyperfocus on one particular area to an intense - even problematic - degree.
Enter The Chowder Man, a stetson wearing Kid Rock analogue who makes frequent appearances throughout Hypnospace. A prominent rock musician in the 80s, Erik Helman (portrayed beautifully by musician, comedian and inventor of the Rick Roll Hot Dad) is attempting a last-ditch revival after his music career flatlined, transforming him from Jagger-esque superstar to sold-out jingle writer. The Chowder Man’s in-game discography is strange and varied, spanning from glorious rock ballads to 22 second earworms about a microwavable butter-based dessert. Totalling ten tracks, I have decided that it is my duty - nay, my fate - to rank and review them in their entirety. So let us commence this spiritual journey together, my friends, into the complex mind of The Chowder Man.

                              <span>What does the future hold for ZeniMax and Bethesda? A sizeable helping of the same, if a 2020-dated release schedule leaked as part of today&#x27;s accidental FTC Microsoft court document blowout is to be believed. The document is from a July 2020 Microsoft presentation about the acquisition of ZeniMax, during the early months of the Covid pandemic - as such, it doesn&#x27;t reflect Microsoft and ZeniMax&#x27;s plans today, following global lockdowns and the buyout, and several of the dates are obviously bogus. Still, it&#x27;s probably a good steer as to current and future Bethesda and ZeniMax projects, which may include Dishonored 3 and remasters of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion and Fallout 3.

                              <span>In the latest unredacted document oopsie stemming from the US Federal Trade Commission&#x27;s efforts to stop Microsoft acquiring Activision Blizzard, an email from Microsoft gaming CEO Phil Spencer has surfaced in which he discusses the idea of buying Nintendo.


The email was sent 6th August 2020 to Microsoft&#x27;s current chief marketing officer Chris Capossela and commercial chief marketing officer Takeshi Numoto. It begins with Spencer speculating that Nintendo may be receptive to approaches, thanks to one of Microsoft&#x27;s allies, San Fran investment fund ValueAct, buying up Nintendo stock and so, attempting to steer the company&#x27;s board towards accepting an acquisition.

The Sapphire Rapids performance was largely flat while for an interesting class of workloads the Linux 6.6 performance drives the AMD EPYC server performance much higher.</span>

                              <span>Given the scale of the hype, Italy&#x27;s upcoming pirate IPTV blocking system seems unlikely to meet expectations. Although late and reportedly nowhere near ready, it has been given a name. Screenshots of &#x27;Piracy Shield&#x27; obtained by an Italian website are interesting but deliberately give little away for security reasons. &#x27;Luckily&#x27;, what appears to be the platform&#x27;s web portal can be located in seconds.

Founded in 2003 by a collective of hackers and activists, the small Swedish BitTorrent tracker grew to become a global icon for online piracy. The rebellious torrent site has a turbulent history and clashed with law enforcement authorities on multiple occasions. Despite these setbacks, it remains online today.

                              <span>Starfield is Bethesda&#x27;s big new release, but now that it’s finally out in the wild, some have already turned their attention toward any incoming news on The Elder Scrolls VI. While some always assumed the game was a good way off, we now know not to expect it for another two to three years at the earliest. 
Per The Verge, as a part of the ongoing FTC vs. Microsoft case over the latter’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Microsoft released a document to the court featuring a chart illustrating its approach to releasing Bethesda games since purchasing the publisher. It lists each title released under the Microsoft banner with details such as its release window and targeted platforms.

                              <span>One of the most depressing copyright lawsuits in recent memory celebrated its third birthday this month. How much has been spent by musician Eddy Grant and defendant Donald Trump over 40 seconds of unlicensed music is unclear, but it&#x27;s likely to be an obscene amount better spent on almost anything else. The chilling effect on fair use can&#x27;t be measured in money.

The conviction is the result of a broader crackdown on local torrent trackers, where both operators and users have been brought to justice. In addition to the sentence, the man also agreed to pay nearly $1,500 in damages to anti-piracy group Rights Alliance.

While part of me wishes this surface-level overhaul had been more radical, it&#x27;s maybe unwise to expect that. For decades this series has embraced its love of brainless ultraviolence and childish storytelling. If Mortal Kombat 1 can be praised for anything, it is unwavering kommitment to the bit.

                              <span>Often when we talk about &quot;hype&quot; surrounding a release, it’s in anticipation of shared cultural euphoria more than that of a great gaming experience. Either way, a great RPG game hits different. Recently, Elden Ring and Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 have both been landmarks. Not to mention the enduring sweep of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt and the Minesweeper-esque ubiquity of Skyrim. When studios get the RPG right, the end result inspires excitement and devotion in ways that feel utterly unique to the genre.
To this end I chatted to Dragon Age, Baldur’s Gate, and Mass Effect maestro Mark Darrah, some of the folks at Studio ZA/UM, and the minds behind the two definitive tomes on CRPG history: Matt Barton of Dungeons And Desktops, and Felipe Pepe of The CRPG Book. I wanted to ask these genere experts about all things choice and consequence, player freedom, and Baldur’s Gate 3’s phenomenal success. What turns a niche into a phenomenon? What goes into creating a great RPG? And what makes the genre so special to people? Turns out that last one is a big question to ask.

This week, my eye has been caught by dramatic skies, a body-surfing game I cannot help but suspect is not actually Starfield, and the fanciest interactive toilet I have ever seen in a video game. Check out these attractive and interesting indies, and many more!

                              <span>I continue to have astrophysics on the brain, and over the weekend, managed to spend an hour in Void Crew from Hutlihut Games and Focus Home. It&#x27;s part of the surprisingly prosperous genre of &quot;team up to complete some big unwieldy task with multiple moving parts&quot; games, and while it hasn&#x27;t yet hit the highs of Overcooked or reached the terrible depths of Barotrauma, I think the recently launched Early Access build might be worth your time. Amongst other things, it&#x27;s trying for a curious blend of jolly party game and macabre theocracy work simulator. And it does have some rather swanky-looking ships.

                              <span>Over the weekend, Starfield players began to share reports of a strange paranormal infestation. There are asteroids in the game that, for reasons known only to gods and/or programmers, follow you from orbit to orbit, flying eerily in formation with your ship, and sometimes even accompanying you to a planet&#x27;s surface. &quot;In one of my weirdest Bethesda glitch experiences, I&#x27;ve got a tiny asteroid that&#x27;s been following me for the past 30 hours,&quot; user ReverendRoo posted on Reddit, triggering an avalanche of comments reminiscent of UFO chasers spotting each other at a NASA open day. &quot;I would catch a glimpse of it from time to time,&quot; wrote fattfett. &quot;I tried to approach it but you can&#x27;t. It stays away. I assumed it had a deeper meaning [toward] the endgame.&quot; Some players, like Blackdius, have multiple asteroids in tow. It seems impossible to blow them up. I&#x27;ve dug up a Youtube video below of one such clingy space boulder from a couple of weeks back. As you can see, it&#x27;s not just a fixed background point like a screen artefact, but seems to move in response to the player&#x27;s ship. Most peculiar.

                              <span>My assumption thus far was that Warhammer Age Of Sigmar: Realms Of Ruin, whatever its eventual qualities, would be the kind of big-campaigned strategy game I&#x27;d never make time for. Then I watched the new &quot;game overview&quot; trailer below, and now I&#x27;m thinking it might have something for me after all.

                              <span>When anti-piracy software Denuvo is removed from a game days before its release date, it&#x27;s usually because pirates cracked an early access version. Not so with Payday 3. It&#x27;s due to release on September 21st, but its developers have decided to handle things themselves.

&quot;Denuvo is no longer in Paday 3,&quot; they announced yesterday, ahead of its release on September 21st.

She&#x27;ll carry the little felt balls around in her mouth and drop them in different places to explore new playpossibilities. In my slipper brings the fun of working in the dark. Beneath a chair makes for a great climbing frame ballsport straight out of a dystopian movie where a kickboxing freedom fighter (played by a muttering European) brings down The Man by being really, really good at batting a ball while dangling from a bar. Between two dumbells creates fun obstacles and windows of opportunity. And in the tangle of wires behind my PC brings the transgressive anti-authoritarian thrill of rolling around while being told &quot;Baby no! Don&#x27;t you...! Get out my wires!&quot; Anyway, what are you playing this weekend? Here&#x27;s what we&#x27;re clicking on!

                              <span>The Logitech G502 is one of the most popular gaming mice in the world - and also the reigning champion of the last RPS Readers&#x27; Peripheral of Choice Awards or whatever we called it at the time. There are both wired and wireless versions available across multiple generations, with the wireless models normally holding a steep premium - but that&#x27;s not true at the moment. 
Today, the G502 Lightspeed wireless model is down to $75 at Amazon US when you use the $20 coupon on the product page, making it 50% off MSRP. Note that this deal is only for Amazon.com, not Amazon UK or other Amazon regions.

This week, BREIN reports that several Usenet uploaders have settled for thousands of euros after being tracked down. In recent weeks, four people associated with a NZB community were caught and all agreed to a private deal instead of going to court.

Join Wesley LeBlanc, who reviewed the game, and me as we pick up the game at about the halfway point. You won&#x27;t encounter any major spoilers in the live stream archive, but you will get to see what the game looks like a little deeper in.

Following the apocalyptic events of Mortal Kombat 11 and its story-based expansion, Mortal Kombat 1 represents a new era for the franchise’s characters. While it purports to do the same for the video game series, the more I played Mortal Kombat 1, the more familiar the latest entry felt, but that’s far from a bad thing.
Mortal Kombat 1 brings the tight gameplay of its predecessors to the next level. Every punch, kick, throw, and special move feels impactful in the dances of death in which its characters participate. Once you get a fe…</span>

                              <span>Samsung&#x27;s 980 Pro NVMe SSD may not be quite as fast as the later 990 Pro, but it&#x27;s still an incredibly rapid option that&#x27;s often available at a more reasonable price. Samsung is currently running a money-back promotion that brings this high-end PCIe 4.0 drive down to an attractively low price in both 1TB and 2TB varieties. 
You can get £30 back on the 2TB size, bringing the price to £94, while the 1TB size offers £20 back, resulting in a final price of £52. (This cashback offer runs until 9th October 2023, for the record; see their site for more info.) These are great deals and well worth considering if you want to upgrade your PC (or even PS5) with one of the fastest SSDs on the market.

                              <span>We often hear that videogames can have a positive impact upon the world, but this is the first time I&#x27;ve seen somebody use one - an antique strategy sim, no less - to advocate for appropriately balancing the level design of your front lawn so as to stop indigenous insects being overrun by smaller invading species. The scientific research paper in question - uploaded in August this year, and brought to my attention by RPS contributor and apparent ant enthusiast Matt Cox - sees researchers Samuel J. Lymbery, Bruce L. Webber and Raphael K. Didham use Age of Empires 2 to study how human shaping of the environment affects the balance of power between the indigenous Australian &quot;meat ant&quot;, or Iridomyrmex purpureus, and the Argentine ant, or Linepithema humile, who are one of the world&#x27;s more invasive ant species.

The promise of jetpacking over to satellites and stations then tinkering in their innards is a solid one, and adjacent to my impossible space salvage game dream. Elements of it work. Others are within acceptable levels of wonkiness for me personally. But it needs a bit of an overhaul to fix some silly design choices it&#x27;s hobbled itself with.

                              <span>Now that’s more like it. The Radeon RX 7700 XT and Radeon RX 7800 XT graphics cards don’t just fill out a 1440p-shaped hole in AMD’s current lineup – they both, the latter in particular, make the kind of spirited attempt to get up in Nvidia’s face that previous red team GPUs simply didn’t.

                              <span>Broken Roads has looked promising since its Australian take on a Fallout-style post-apocalypse CRPG first appeared on our radar way back in 2019. Four years later, after multiple delays, Drop Bear Bytes’ fascinating throwback is finally almost here - close enough to get a proper full release date.

                              <span>One of the things I like best about Die Gute Fabrik&#x27;s forthcoming Saltsea Chronicles is an optional feature. It&#x27;s a card game, Spoils, which you can play while sojourning upon the game&#x27;s islands and searching for clues about your ship&#x27;s missing captain, Maja. Here&#x27;s how it works: two teams of two characters take turns to play cards, moving in clockwise around a table. Players must follow the lead player&#x27;s suit, and the highest-scoring card wins the trick, with four tricks comprising a round. It might sound like a straightforward competition, but different islands offer different house rules, and there are twists that reflect the game&#x27;s ethic of community, mutual respect and diversity, and help animate the detail of its gently post-apocalyptic oceanic world. 
The winning card from each trick is handed to the loser, so victory is, in its way, an act of generosity. Score more than 100 points in a round, meanwhile, and the &quot;Hoarding&quot; rule means you must relinquish those points to the other team. As Die Gute Fabrik&#x27;s CEO and creative lead Hannah Nicklin observes, this fits the anti-capitalist politics and mythology of Saltsea, in which &quot;hoarding is sort of seen as the apocryphal cause of the flood&quot;. The Spoils tutorial menus riff on this with a cute but mildly unsettling image of a sinking ship.

                              <span>Friends, I am excited. A new trailer for Final Fantasy VII Rebirth dropped last night during the Playstation State Of Play stream, and holy cow, despite feeling a bit ill and exhausted and generally not firing on all cylinders at the moment, I think I might be more pumped for this than literally any other video game on the horizon right now. Even that long-awaited PC release of Final Fantasy 16 can&#x27;t quite compare to this, if you ask me, and I might even be more enthused by it than the prospect of a Switch 2. And I don&#x27;t even really like Final Fantasy VII! That&#x27;s how much Nomura&#x27;s mad, timey-wimey game child has sunk its teeth into me. I&#x27;m mostly here just to see what mad nonsense comes Cloud&#x27;s way next - and from the looks of things, it&#x27;s a lot.

                              <span>A big shout out to indie games that are successors to existing games in all but name. It&#x27;s gotta be one of my favourite trends. Fed up of waiting for a big publisher to revive a series that’s been lying dormant for decades? Simply do it yourself instead. 11 years after the release of Jet Set Radio Future, and with Sega seemingly unwilling to exhume their cult-favourite rollerblading series outside of weird crossovers with Ubisoft’s Roller Champions of all things, Team Reptile have done exactly that.
Enter Bomb Rush Cyberfunk, as authentic a sequel to Jet Set Radio as you can get. Dripping with style and oozing cool, the team have crafted a carefully observed love letter that both respects and advances the original duology in meaningful ways, while taking a step back in others.

                              <span>US author and artist Bill Willingham has rather dramatically announced that he is placing the Fables comicbook property in the public domain, including all Fables spin-offs and characters. This means that - pending a judgement from third-party legal experts, anyway - anyone can now create art of any kind set in the Fables universe. &quot;What was once wholly owned by Bill Willingham is now owned by everyone, for all time,&quot; the author wrote on his Substack. &quot;It&#x27;s done, and as most experts will tell you, once done it cannot be undone. Take-backs are neither contemplated nor possible.&quot;


You might recognise Fables as the universe in which Telltale&#x27;s The Wolf Among Us is set. It&#x27;s a grubby noir fairytale world in which bedtime story characters like Snow White and Prince Charming live discreetly among regular humans, aka Mundies, having been driven from their homelands by a mysterious Adversary. I confess I&#x27;ve not read any of the original comics - I&#x27;ve only ever played the Telltale adaptation, which I enjoyed. I feel guilty about that in hindsight, because Willingham seems to have a pretty dim view of Telltale&#x27;s work, though that&#x27;s partly to do with what he considers to be his longstanding unfair treatment by Fables publisher DC Comics.

                              <span>Riot Forge have been quietly building up quite the catalogue of League Of Legends side story games over the last couple of years. In November 2021, they launched the double whammy of rhythm runner Hextech Mayhem and turn-based RPG Ruined King, and this year alone we&#x27;ve already had action RPG The Mageseeker and narrative platformer Conv/rgence. As you can probably tell, they&#x27;re all focused on different genres, different League heroes, and have all come from different developers - and soon they&#x27;ll be joined by Song Of Nunu, the next game from Rime developers Tequila Works. 
I got to play a very small slice of it at Gamescom last month, and yep, if you&#x27;ve been craving another low stakes adventure that&#x27;s all but guaranteed to wrench at your heartstrings and wibble your tear ducts, Song Of Nunu will almost certainly fill that Rime-shaped hole in your life when it comes to PC on November 1st.

                              <span>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor is a fantastic game, largely due to the fact that it does such a good job of mimicking the Star Wars cinematic style. Whether it&#x27;s the rush of stars streaking past a ship going into hyperspace or the distinct hum of a lightsaber, Respawn really went all out to match the aesthetic of one of the world&#x27;s biggest movie franchises. One of the most important elements in achieving that is through music, and while the Star Wars sound is iconic and well-known, a good video game score has to be more than just an imitation of what came before. The music for Jedi: Survivor was written by Stephen Barton and Gordy Haab, and when I ask them what makes a good video game soundtrack, they answer in unison.

With two fantastic Spider-Man games under Insomniac’s belt, Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 feels like the culmination of the 2018 game and 2020’s Miles Morales in all the best ways. At a recent preview event, I spent roughly 90 minutes swinging and gliding across its new and improved New York City, taking down scores of bad guys and even challenging the Lizard. When my session concluded, I walked away thinking one thing: The first two games swung so that this third act could soar. 
This preview contains spoilers for Spider-Man (2018) and Spider-Man: Miles Morales.

                              <span>Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage brings players to 9th Century Baghdad during the city’s Golden Age. More specifically, the year 861 is when protagonist Basim Ibn Is&#x27;haq&#x27;s journey begins in this city, the technological and cultural epicenter of the region at the time. After playing more than two hours of Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage in developer Ubisoft Bordeaux&#x27;s France-based office, I was impressed with its take on Baghdad. 
I love the open-world RPGs of the series&#x27; recent years, especially Assassin&#x27;s Creed Origins and Odyssey, but I’d be lying if I said I was a fan of their respective cities. It&#x27;s not that I didn&#x27;t enjoy them, but they weren&#x27;t memorable in the same way Assassin&#x27;s Creed II’s Florence or Assassin&#x27;s Creed Unity&#x27;s Paris was. And that&#x27;s because these cities were inserted into gigantic map…</span>

                              <span>In this week&#x27;s episode of The Game Informer Show, the crew breaks down our Lies of P review and discusses why the game is much more than a Bloodborne clone. Afterward, Blake talks about why he likes Armored Core VI and also why the hesitations from our cover story still ring true. Lastly, we chat about the games that continue to bring us joy: Fortnite and Nour: Play With Your Food.

                              <span>Millions of people use Plex as a platform to curate, organize, share and watch video content.  The software can be used for perfectly legitimate purposes, but some also treat it as a piracy gateway. Yesterday, Plex informed users that it will no longer allow users to run servers at a hosting provider where lots of TOS violations occur. While copyright infringement isn&#x27;t specifically mentioned, the action appears anti-piracy focused.

The publishers can&#x27;t currently identify the site&#x27;s operators but believe they are likely based overseas. Citing  &quot;staggering&quot; levels of infringement, the companies are seeking damages and an order that will allow them to seize the site&#x27;s domains or put them out of action.

                              <span>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, the sequel to 2020&#x27;s Final Fantasy VII Remake, will hit PlayStation 5 on February 29, 2024. This follows news from Summer Game Fest back in June where Square Enix announced Rebirth will require two discs and launch in &quot;early 2024.&quot; 
Alongside news of Rebirth&#x27;s release date, Square Enix and PlayStation also released a new and expansive trailer during today&#x27;s State of Play. In it, we get our first looks at characters like Cait Sith, Vincent Valentine, and more. We also get to see The Gold Saucer, some fun minigames inspired by the visual style of Final Fantasy VII on PS1, and more of the game&#x27;s open area exploration, which features ridable chocobos, vehicles, and segways.

                              <span>Today’s State of Play offered our latest look at Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora. The new trailer doubles down on the impressive visuals we’ve already come to expect from the game, with a colorful natural palette that looks like a gorgeous place to explore.
We also got a glimpse of a player’s ability to ride and interact with a variety of Pandora’s alien creatures – clearly a highlight of the gameplay.
Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is developed by Massive Entertainment and published by Ubisoft, and is headed for release in just a few months, on December 7 for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</span>

                              <span>Creative director Bryan Intihar shared all kinds of new Spider-Man 2 details during today&#x27;s State of Play. While showing off new gameplay Intihar shared a big list of Spider-Man 2 details, which you can see below.
The city has doubled in size
Web wings (which we have seen before) allow for even faster traversal
Peter Parker&#x27;s old high-school is a location you can visit, as well as Miles Morales&#x27; Visions Academy
You will be able to swap between Parker Spider-Man and Morales Spider-Man almost instantly
New U.I. options and more visually interesting tasks to do around the city will, hopefully, prevent you from using the menus too much
Parker and Morales can user a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man app
Folks will make requests for Spider-Man&#x27;s help. Sometimes they want a specific Spider-Man, often they don&#x27;t care
There is a new fast-travel system
There are over 65 suits to unlock and wear

Spider-Man 2 releases October 20 on PlayStation 5. Keep an eye on our website tomorrow for even more from the game, including hands-on impressions.</span>

                              <span>Today, during Sony&#x27;s recent State of Play livestream, we got a look at both the upcoming PSVR2 update and story DLC for the Resident Evil 4 Remake. 
The VR trailer is brief but does show the game in action. Much like the other VR port of RE4, the move brings the whole game into virtual reality. The big news is that the update is coming this winter.


More immediately, we finally got confirmation that &quot;Separate Ways&quot; is coming to RE4. For the uninitiated, Separate Ways was a side campaign starring, you guessed it, Ada Wong, initially released with the PlayStation 2 and all subsequent versions of the original Resident Evil 4. Separate Ways will be released next week, on September 21.
Moreover, Both Ada Wong and Albert Wesker will be made available as playable characters in the Mercenaries game mode.
For more Resident Evil 4 Remake, check out our review.
Correction: An earlier version of this story mistakenly identified &quot;Separate Ways&quot; as &quot;Assignment Ada.&quot; We regret the error.</span>

                              <span>Bennett Foddy, the developer behind Getting Over It, released another trailer for Baby Steps during today&#x27;s PlayStation State of Play. Foddy, along with fellow developers Gabe Cuzzillo and Maxi Boch, are bringing Baby Steps to PlayStation 5 next summer. 
Today&#x27;s trailer stopped short of revealing a more exact release date, though. Baby Steps was revealed during a June PlayStation State of Play earlier this year. In it, players control Nate, an &quot;unemployed failson with nothing going for him until one day, he discovers a power he never knew he had: putting one foot in front of the other.&quot; And as you might expect, players will control Nate on his journey to discover more of the world around him. 
Check out the new Baby Steps trailer for yourself below:


Baby Steps will hit PlayStation 5 and PC during the summer of 2024.</span>

Ascendant founder and CEO Bret Robbins released a statement on Twitter today, explaining the large reduction in staff. He says it was a painfully difficult decision but a necessary one following the release of Immortals of Aveum on August 22. Here’s Robbins’ statement in full:

The hearts of the Game Informer staff are with everyone affected by these layoffs and those still at the studio. 
These layoffs follow the release of Immortals of Aveum, a game we thoroughly enjoyed, on August 22. Before its launch, we went hands-on with Immortals of Aveum at Ascendant Studios and talked with the team about creating a new first-person shooter in Unreal Engine 5.</span>

                              <span>Another Code: Two Memories, or Trace Memory as it&#x27;s known in North America, is a Nintendo DS game that launched on the handheld device way back in 2005. Its sequel, Another Code: R – Journey Into Lost Memories, launched on the Wii in 2009, but it never came to North America. Now, players can experience both games when Another Code: Recollection hits Switch in January. 
Another Code: Recollection is an enhanced collection of Trace Memory and Another Code: R launching on Switch on January 19, 2024. During today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct, Nintendo revealed this collection of games with a new trailer showing enhanced visuals while pulling back the curtains on protagonist Ashley, who is traveling to the remote Blood Edward Island in search of her father. 
Check out the Another Code: Recollection reveal trailer for yourself below: 


After Ashley receives a letter from her father, who she believes to be dead, a chain of mysteries and visions from the past is set off, sending her to Blood Edward Island. There, Ashley must investigate her surroundings while solving puzzles to reveal the truth. Another Code: R completes Ashley&#x27;s tale. In it, she journeys to Lake Juliet two years after the events of Trace Memory to uncover the hidden truth surrounding her mother. 
&quot;This collection includes fully enhanced versions of both original games, featuring overhauled visuals, fully explorable environments, new voice acting, puzzles, music, and more,&quot; Nintendo&#x27;s description of the game reads. &quot;Optional hint and navigation systems have been added to help players new to adventure games.&quot; 
Another Code: Recollection will cost $59.99 and launch on Switch on January 19, 2024.

Preordering the game before its release will get you a bonus skin for Dave&#x27;s boat and an exclusive lamp decoration for the sushi restaurant. Mintrocket describes the boat skin as nostalgic and themed after an 8-bit visual style, whereas the lamp depicts Dave &quot;in [a] charming retro style.&quot; 
&quot;We&#x27;re over the moon seeing and hearing the reception to our first game,&quot; Dave the Diver game director Jaeho Hwang writes in a press release. &quot;Bringing this to the Switch community has been an important goal for us as we think the console is a home where the players will truly appreciate everything Dave the Diver has to offer.&quot; 
For the uninitiated, Dave the Diver tasks players with diving underwater to gather ingredients by day that are used to serve hungry customers at a seaside sushi restaurant at night. However, there&#x27;s a mystery bubbling up from &quot;the deepest depths of the Blue Hole, the setting that [Dave] will swim through in this incredible journey.&quot; 
Dave the Diver is currently available on PC. It hits Switch on October 26.

                              <span>Developer Robotality and publisher Chucklefish have announced that Wargroove 2 will be released next month. More specifically, the sequel hits Switch and PC on October 5, just a few months shy of the first Wargroove&#x27;s fourth anniversary. 
Chucklefish announced the Wargroove 2 release date during today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct alongside a new trailer showing more of the game&#x27;s beautiful pixel art and challenging turn-based combat. It also highlighted the new commanders to control, a new playable faction in Wargroove 2, and the sequel&#x27;s three interweaving campaigns. 
Check out the Wargroove 2 release date trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, this new trailer reveals the Faahri Republic, which Chucklefish describes as &quot;a nation of curious mouse-folk who have landed in Aurania on a scholarly expedition.&quot;
&quot;What the Faahri Republic lacks in military experience, they more than make up for with academic theory,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;Equipped with mysterious crystal technology, Commanders Lytra, Pistil, and Rhomb must work together in pursuit of information for their mysterious benefactors.&quot; 
Elsewhere in the press release, Chucklefish says Wargroove 2 features new recruits and veteran wardogs to control alongside the game&#x27;s new commanders. You can supercharge those commanders with a newly updated Groove system, too. Once you&#x27;re done with Wargroove 2&#x27;s three campaign arcs, you can battle with or against friends in co-op and multiplayer modes, both locally and online, with up to three other players. 

Preorders for Wargroove 2 are now live on PC and Switch. On Steam and Nintendo Europe and North American eShops, you can preorder for 20% off today. The game&#x27;s full price is $19.99.
Wargroove 2 hits Switch and PC next month on October 5.

                              <span>Vanillaware released 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim in 2020, and it was a bit of a sleeper hit. However, this team is also behind other games like Dragon&#x27;s Crown and Odin Sphere. Now, Vanillaware has announced Unicorn Overlord, a new tactical fantasy RPG, and it launches March 8 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4 as a digital-only game, and Switch.
During today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct, the team announced this new game with a trailer showcasing its various characters, unique art style, and tactics gameplay. And perhaps unsurprisingly, it looks great. 
Check out the Unicorn Overlord reveal trailer for yourself below: 


Vanillaware says Unicorn Overlord combines overworld exploration with an innovative battle system that&#x27;s very reminiscent of Vanillaware&#x27;s combat style. In the game, you&#x27;ll &quot;traverse the vibrant world, cultivate a grand army with over 60 uniquely designed characters, and grow your renown throughout the five nations in this unique epic fantasy experience.&quot; 
In addition to a Standard Edition of Unicorn Overlord, Vanillaware will also release a Collector&#x27;s Edition that includes a physical copy of the game, a premium box, a 16-bit BGM soundtrack CD that consists of two discs with 10 tracks on each, a 132-page artbook, and an original card game for Unicorn Overlord that includes 239 cards, tokens, and markers. The Collector&#x27;s Edition also includes the &quot;Atlus x Vanillaware Heraldry pack and preorder DLC, which lets you customize the Liberation Army’s flag with emblem designs from Odin Sphere, Dragon&#x27;s Crown, and 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim.&quot; 
Unicorn Overlord launches on March 8, 2024, on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4 (digital only), and Switch.

                              <span>During today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct, the company announced release dates and windows for some highly anticipated Amiibo figures, namely, the Zelda and Ganondorf Amiibo for The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, the Noah and Mio Amiibo for Xenoblade Chronicles 3, and the Kingdom Hearts Sora Amiibo for his inclusion on the Super Smash Bros. Ultimate roster. 
All five Amiibo look great, as Nintendo has especially become great at making these figures compared to the first few runs of Amiibo. Nintendo announced that the Zelda and Ganondorf Amiibo for Tears of the Kingdom were coming back in June, and now we know exactly when: both hit stores on November 3. While the two figures were announced together, each will be sold individually. Each Amiibo unlocks a special fabric for your paraglider in Tears of the Kingdom and special materials and weapons for the game. 
The Xenoblade Chronicles 3 Noah and Mio Amiibo go live on January 19, 2024. These two will be released as a single set. The Noah Amiibo gets you Consul N’s Armor for Noah in-game and the Leisure Time outfits for Noah, Lanz, and Eunie. The Mio Amiibo unlocks Consul M’s Armor for Mio and Leisure Time outfits for Mio, Sena, and Taion. 
And finally, the Kingdom Hearts Sora Amiibo for Super Smash Bros. Ultimate will join the figure lineup sometime in 2024. 
While waiting to get each, read Game Informer&#x27;s review of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and then read Game Informer&#x27;s review of Xenoblade Chronicles 3. After that, watch the Kingdom Hearts IV reveal trailer.

The release date was announced today as part of a developer stream, which also included a new cinematic trailer for the expansion featuring a little of Idris Elba&#x27;s character before the events of the game.

                              <span>I bought a Steam Deck thinking I would delight in being able to play the breadth and depth of PC gaming away from my desk. Then I downloaded arcade racer Horizon Chase Turbo and basically played nothing else. It was fast, accessible, a throwback to the Amiga racers of my youth, and perfect for sneaking in between work meetings and emails.

Now its sequel Horizon Chase 2 is out on PC... but only via the Epic Games Store. Damn.

                              <span>I wouldn&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve been itching to return to Amnesia: The Bunker, Frictional&#x27;s perfectly ghastly blend of horror game and immersive sim, but I&#x27;ve certainly been itching to write about it. The terrible beauty of that generator-based exploration and scavenging loop. That moment when you walk just a little too quickly down a corridor, and hear the awful rummaging in the walls. The agonising discovery that not only is it possible to roam with the lights out, but pretty much required, beyond a certain point. The dense burden of grasping more or less where to go, without knowing how to survive the journey - and above all else, those goddamn rats, always encountered where least convenient. Shoo! Shoo!
It&#x27;s by far the most oppressive and demanding horror game I&#x27;ve played in recent memory, and it&#x27;ll get considerably worse with the release of the Halloween update.

                              <span>Last year, the U.S. indicted two Russians who stand accused of operating the book piracy site Z-Library. Anton Napolsky and Valeriia Ermakova were arrested in Argentina, where they are currently &#x27;home confined’ pending their extradition battle. Meanwhile, their lawyers are trying to convince a New York federal court to dismiss the case for a myriad of reasons.

According to AimJunkies&#x27; lawyer, the day of reckoning is near.

                              <span>Earlier this year, the Alliance for Creativity and Entertainment shut down one of the largest piracy sites, Zoro.to. The anti-piracy group struck a deal with its Vietnamese operator, who also ran the popular 2Embed service. Shortly before shutting down, Zoro.to was &#x27;acquired&#x27; by Aniwatch.to, which now finds itself at the center of a new ACE investigation.

                              <span>The day has come. We are super happy to announce public beta testing for the iOS port of ScummVM in the store. Yes, you read it right! Since Lars Sundström, aka lman, joined our team as the iOS porter, we have made significant progress. Thus, you no longer need to compile ScummVM yourself in order to add it to your iOS or iPadOS device. 
If you want to help by testing this version, just follow this Testflight link and enroll yourself in the test program. This may require installing Apple’s Testflight app. You can find instructions on how to install games and how to play them on our documentation portal.
We truly appreciate your feedback. You can share your thoughts with the Testflight feedback feature, where you can attach screenshots and post detailed descriptions. Alternatively, you can use our bugtracker, e-mail us at ios@scummvm.org, or post on our Discord Server. Your help will let us eventually add ScummVM to the App Store.

                              <span>Following our announcement about affiliation with ZOOM-Platform, we would like to give a note that they have just started to offer the Macintosh versions of  Syberia 1 and Syberia 2 bundled with ScummVM.
This is important because ScummVM currently supports only the Macintosh versions of these games. These versions were produced by Tetraedge and are built on a completely different engine than the original Windows versions; basically, they are reimplementations, not ports. Now, thanks to the folks from ZOOM-Platform, you can easily obtain these game variants.

                              <span>We are pleased to announce an affiliate partnership with ZOOM-Platform, a supplier of DRM-free games. If you use a link from this website (or from our Wiki), the ScummVM project will receive a small amount of money to be used for web hosting and other expenses.
Any purchases from ZOOM-Platform qualify, but we especially encourage you to check out games supported by ScummVM, such as the Syberia 1, 2, Galador,  Obsidian as well as 18 titles from the Living Books series. In total, we counted 25 games supported by ScummVM, and this list is growing.
We will keep an up-to-date list of the games available from this platform on our Wiki and have added an affiliate link on the sidebar here.
