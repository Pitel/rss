PlatinumGames first foray into making a live service is otherwise a mess, with repetitive missions, dull combat, confusing stats and loot, and more problems besides.

Last time, we ended up running each other over with go-karts while the party leader tried to set up a mandatory LLC and email a tax return to Rockstar.

                              <span>If you’re unfamiliar with Redout, it’s an anti-gravity racer inspired by the likes of F-Zero and Wipeout. And if you’ve not played any of those before, then imagine a pod-racer from Star Wars belting it down Mario Kart’s Rainbow Road - except, hang on, there’s a mysterious white powder caked on the bristles of Mario’s mustache. The sheer speed of the first game made it pretty popular among race-heads, but a bit of a daunting prospect for those used to a traditional “wheels on the ground” racing experience.
Redout 2 doubles down on the speed element, that&#x27;s for sure. But there&#x27;s definitely an added air of approachability to this anti-grav racer, making the transition from Geforce to g-force a little less bruising than before. AI presets, added customisation, and more generous modes help make this a racing game you should keep up with.

                              <span>You may not have heard much about developer Complex Games, but the Canadian studio has a surprisingly storied history. Despite spending the last two decades building mobile and browser games for the likes of Disney, Nickelodeon and Zynga, their heart has always resided with the PC. &quot;There wasn&#x27;t a lot of game development in Winnipeg, so we tried to figure it out ourselves and spent a few years trying to build a PC game,&quot; says creative director Noah Decter-Jackson. Fresh out of college, Complex&#x27;s first project was a third-person hand-to-hand action prototype that they pitched to publishers at E3 2003, an endeavour that Decter-Jackson describes as &quot;phenomenally unsuccessful&quot;.
This led to Complex remodelling as a work-for-hire outfit, and their long track-record making mobile games. But in 2015, Complex launched The Horus Heresy: Drop Assault, a fast-paced tactics game in conjunction with Games Workshop. In the wake of Drop Assault&#x27;s success, the studio saw an opportunity. &quot;We had been wanting for a long time to return to our PC roots,&quot; he says. &quot;So we pitched a core idea for a game to Games Workshop, because Drop Assault had been quite successful... and that&#x27;s essentially how Chaos Gate: Daemonhunters came to be.&quot;

                              <span>First unveiled last week, Ship Of Fools is an upcoming seafaring roguelite where you and a fellow co-op pal take on hordes of horrible beasties as you sail the high seas. Depending on your choice of player two, it&#x27;s also likely to be an apt description of how you&#x27;ll feel playing it.
Having waded through an early preview build of its opening Forgotten Waters stage this week, this is one co-operative cannon fest that seems destined to see friends and family not so much walk the plank after an untimely defeat as get absolutely spanked by it. Imagine the visual chaos of a game like Overcooked combined with the frantic, tactile ship management of Lovers In A Dangerous Spacetime and you&#x27;re pretty much there, albeit with several more barnacles, bug-spewing mosquitoes and laser-firing totem poles in the mix. The jangle of Davy Jones&#x27; locker is never far away in this storm-stricken archipelago, so beware, fools. You will not be suffered gladly.

                              <span>The AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D, what the red team calls the “world’s fastest gaming CPU”, now has a price and release date: it’ll cost $449 and hit shelves on the 20th of April. A quick check of Intel’s current top chip, the Core i9-12900K, has it at $614 – so that’s potentially a big saving, if the Ryzen 7 3800X3D really can outpace it. UK pricing is still TBD.

The theme is broad but the deals are solid, including 80% off Valkyria Chronicles 4, 50% off Chrono Trigger, 45% off Yakuza: Like A Dragon, and hundreds more discounts. Heck, even RPG Maker is on sale, so you can make your own JRPG, and then sell it on Steam, and then join in the next JRPG sale.

                              <span>Behind the scenes I have been chipping away at Horizon Forbidden West on the PS5, a game I would characterise as good, lots of fun, very pretty. (Sidebar: having recently conducted an inventory of all my posessions for international shipping purposes, it appears the PS5 is literally the most valuable thing I own. I am 32 years old). I&#x27;m not very good at it, to be honest, so recently knocked it down to easy difficulty in order to stomp on robot heads with greater efficiency. Good ol&#x27; Aloy.
Anyway, now that I have awakened a sort of mother-surrogate AI and started the actual business of saving the world, I cannot help but ask the key question: why can I still not ride into battle atop a massive great robot T-Rex?

                              <span>A minuet of mods.
We&#x27;ve been covering the unofficial Ocarina of Time PC port for a little while now, and it&#x27;s close to finished. So as we approach that time, naturally, leave it to people to come up with a whole bunch of mods.
This project was only possible because the Zelda Reverse Engineering team decompiled the N64 classic last year. Harbour Masters - which is behind the port - have been testing a number of different mods and sharing the results among the group. These include simple things such as replacing the game&#x27;s textures with 4K ones, and widescreen support in the main game and menus - which the below video from VGC highlights.

Classic video game characters being reimagined in new and unique styles isn&#x27;t always surprising, but artist Canadian Turtle&#x27;s take on iconic Super Mario characters is nothing short of stunning.
By utilising Japanese mythology, Canadian Turtle has given classic scenes from the Super Mario series a completely new lease of life, opting for a more adult-oriented approach whilst still maintaining the classic look and feel of the franchise. Our personal favourite is the gorgeous take on Mario defeating Gooper Blooper from Super Mario Sunshine.

As Switch-owning LEGO fans await the release of the upcoming LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga — or perhaps LEGO Brawls if you&#x27;re not really a Jedi fan — it&#x27;s perhaps surprising to see just how many games based on the Danish plastic brick system (and invariably another juicy licence) have graced Nintendo&#x27;s hybrid system since launch. Looking back we&#x27;ve had ports of older games, all-new releases, and even a title that wasn&#x27;t a port or a licensed crossover with another huge media franchise.
With so many LEGO games on the system, it&#x27;s tough to know where to start when you&#x27;re looking for a brick fix. Fortunately, you lovely Nintendo Life readers are here to help.

                              <span>&quot;A complicated and rather compromised conversion&quot;.
The Switch has been well served with older Assassin&#x27;s Creed games, getting a number of ports that give players a lot of adventures to work through. The most recent arrival was Assassin&#x27;s Creed: The Ezio Collection, including three titles that are regarded by some as the original peak of the franchise.
We gave this collection a recommendation in our review, but with some caveats, and the Digital Foundry assessment (above) seems similar on the technical front. In terms of the visuals, there are some interesting points on the detail and general &#x27;look&#x27; lost from the originals when these games were reworked on PS4 / Xbox One. The further transition to Switch seems to have taken away some atmospheric details, leading to a &#x27;clinical&#x27; appearance at times.

Dubbed the &quot;fastest racing game in the universe&quot;, Redout 2 has been treated to a brand new overview trailer, with the game bringing lots of F-Zero vibes (although that might be because we&#x27;ve been playing F-Zero X all week).
Regardless, it&#x27;s looking pretty slick, showcasing the classic &#x27;anti-grav&#x27; racing that&#x27;s become popular with franchises like F-Zero and WipEout. You&#x27;ll need to strafe and tilt your ship in order to gain maximum speed on the tracks, but the game will also boast a selection of options to make it more accessible.

Why is it that YouTube has lots of hits for “Guitar Hero blindfold” but none for “Guitar Hero earplugs”? It’s music – you don’t need to see it. With A Musical Story, Glee-Cheese Studio have taken a punt on the idea that music is something you do indeed listen to. What kind of music? With a brown-galore colour palette and a deliciously funk-dipped prog-rock vibe, we have a love letter to the 1970s that practically types the word “groovy” into reviews by itself.
The story is about a band setting out on the road to pursue their dreams at a festival, with love and trippy adventures along the way. The game is structured into story episodes that must be passed in sequence, seamlessly flowing through animations and rhythm sequences from start to end. The visual presentation is stylish, focusing on a small area for the interactive sections, then luxuriously filling the screen for the rest. OLED-havers will appreciate the expansive blackness and bursts of colour.

Mode 7 is definitely one of the coolest features of many SNES games. Remember hopping into your first go-kart in Super Mario Kart and seeing your favourite characters drive around &quot;fully-3D&quot; courses? Or playing Secret of Mana and getting on Flammie&#x27;s back for the first time, and looking down at the world map? Don&#x27;t forget Star Fox&#x27;s polygonal Arwings blasting their way through space!
That&#x27;s only a small handful of games that utilised this unique feature, but as kids it dazzled us. Finally, video games could be in 3D! if you&#x27;re like us, you&#x27;ve probably always wanted to know how Mode 7 works.

Capcom today hosted a Digital Event for Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak, the &#x27;massive expansion&#x27;. It was full of excellent detail and footage, with the key information being that it&#x27;ll launch on 30th June on Switch, with pre-orders on the eShop due to go live today. 
The broadcast itself was just short of 20 minutes and is well worth a watch. Below is a summary of some key details:

Proper game guides really feel like a thing of the past now, with online walkthroughs and YouTube guides being a far more convenient, if a bit sterile, alternative.
One of the best examples of a game guide done right is the original 1996 Japanese guide for Super Mario 64, complete with commentary from the likes of Shigeru Miyamoto and a set of gorgeous dioramas based on the game&#x27;s levels.

In the Dark is a puzzle game in which the primary goal is simple: turn off all the lights. Presented in a 3x3 grid format, turning each light on or off will flip the state of all lights surrounding it.

A couple of years ago, we discovered that you could buy a big ol&#x27; Mareep plush for around $500. We know, it&#x27;s absolutely adorable, but $500? You can get a real Magikarp for 500 Pokédollars in Pokémon Red and Blue. We don&#x27;t know what the conversion rate actually is, and you might not be able to squeeze your digital Magikarp. But, Gyarados makes that worth it, right?
Anyway, if you want your own life-sized Mareep in real life and you live in the UK — and you&#x27;re not feeling the Poké pinch in the wallet department — you&#x27;re in luck! The Pokémon Center UK has just stocked up on some extra large Poké Plush for you to cuddle.

Monster Hunter Rise has proven to be a major success on Switch and now PC, and this Summer we&#x27;re due to get its major expansion, Sunbreak.
It could deliver a big boost to Rise, and with its release getting closer we&#x27;re promised &#x27;new reveals&#x27; in this Digital Showcase. We&#x27;ve had teases and some reveals already, but will we get the big details? Yes, we&#x27;d love to know its release date, among other things, but in any case we&#x27;re sure to see plenty of the upcoming content in this broadcast, potentially including an extended look at the &#x27;Elgado&#x27; location. It&#x27;s due to be about 20 minutes long.

                              <span>Well, March 2021-March 2022, to be precise.
Blimey, 2021 was pretty great for Switch games, wasn&#x27;t it? Nintendo&#x27;s hybrid system may be halfway through its lifecycle, but it&#x27;s still getting some solid-gold software – and last year was jam-packed with essential releases.
If you don&#x27;t believe us then check out our video above, which runs down the best Switch games released in 2021. And, because it runs from March 2021 to March 2022, it&#x27;s ever so slightly different from our previously-published written list.

                              <span>Freshly-picked thoughts from Takaya Imamura.
When you see a man in green latex, do you come out in a cold sweat? Does the sound of &quot;Kooloo-Limpah&quot; make you shiver? Does your poor wallet groan as it prepares to be emptied in exchange for an absolutely extortionate treasure map? Well, you&#x27;re not alone!
Ever since The Legend of Zelda: Majora&#x27;s Mask, one character has been on everyone&#x27;s lips for polarising reasons. Tingle, the map merchant and reincarnated fairy (so he says) is arguably unsettling for a number of reasons; his rosy 35-year-old cheeks and skin-tight outfit, as well as his bizarre catchphrases and dances. You do you, Tingle! — which should go without saying — but there are few characters in video games that split popular opinion quite so much.

                              <span>The end is nigh.
It&#x27;s no secret that the 3DS — along with its console sibling Wii U — is heading toward that bright light at the end of the tunnel. With the handheld&#x27;s eShop closing within the next year, it&#x27;s natural that publishers will want to capitalise on this unfortunate eventuality with some rather sweet deals.
It&#x27;s a nice opportunity for players to grab some titles they may have missed out on, and if you&#x27;re a fan of Capcom&#x27;s games in particular, we dare say you&#x27;ll be eating rather well with its new 3DS sale for the US eShop (sorry, Europe — no word on a similar sale across the pond just yet, although we&#x27;ll update this article should one appear).

                              <span>Mario Party Superstars brings the party back though.
The latest UK charts are now in, and it&#x27;s a big win for Sony and the PlayStation 5. Last week&#x27;s big winner, and new release, Gran Turismo 7, has maintained its 1st place position. Take 2&#x27;s WWE 2K22 — the newcomer of the week — bulldogs into 2nd, elbowing Elden Ring down into 3rd. Incidentally, their PS5 versions have all sold the best, making up 68%, 43%, and 58% of total sales respectively.
What about Nintendo, then? Last week&#x27;s new release Triangle Strategy has been forced to retreat out of the top 20 entirely at 24th, and Pokémon Legends: Arceus has also dropped few places further into 5th — which is still pretty strong for a game that&#x27;s been out for around for a month-and-a-half.

                              <span>Answering the ultimate question.
Animal Crossing is one of those series that has become something of an obsession with many gamers.
Since it made its debut on the N64 back in 2001, the franchise has spanned multiple Nintendo systems and sucked away countless hours from millions of players all over the globe – but when you have to explain to a layperson what makes Animal Crossing so incredibly appealing, it&#x27;s often hard to articulate.

                              <span>But don&#x27;t count on it.
The often fruitless desire for more Silent Hill games simply refuses to abate. In a new update from Reddit (thanks, GoNintendo), publisher Konami has filed trademark renewals for the survival horror franchise.
This may be a hint of things to come, but we&#x27;d recommend keeping your expectations in check. Trademark renewals are nothing new, and with Silent Hill being one of Konami&#x27;s biggest franchises it&#x27;s unlikely it&#x27;d let something like this slip.

Back in 2020, a Famitsu column suggested Masahiro Sakurai and his team considered rollback netcode for Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, but apparently, it didn&#x27;t work out.
While we have seen rollback support in other fighting games on the Switch, there&#x27;s one software engineer - known as &#x27;DShad&#x27; on Twitter - who has been working on his own Smash Ultimate rollback network code for Switch emulators, for some time now.

Over the past two decades, Rockstar Games has emerged as a force to be reckoned with in the games industry. Rising up from quirky Scotland-based developers with a taste for pulp and crime fiction, Rockstar evolved radically, shifting into innovators and provocateurs, creating some of the industry&#x27;s most influential and blockbuster titles. In the lead up to the eagerly anticipated Red Dead Redemption 2, we came together as a staff to rank every single game that Rockstar developed (this means we excluded published titles like L.A. Noire and Smuggler&#x27;s Run). From the humble top-down beginnings of Grand Theft Auto to the blood-soaked streets of Manhunt and the beautiful jaw-dropping vistas of Red Dead Redemption, you’ll find every single title put in its proper place in terms of influence, importance of innovation, and just plain fun.

Ghostwire: Tokyo launches in just over a week, and PlayStation 5 players will have a lot to consider in terms of getting the most out of the spooky experience. That’s because the game sports not one, not two, but six graphical and performance options.
We’re reviewing Ghostwire: Tokyo and have listed each mode along with their in-game explanation. However, the game only lays out what the two primary modes do, which are:  
Quality Mode: A high-fidelity rendering mode with ray tracing enabled. 30 FPS limit
Performance Mode: A high-framerate mode designed for the smoothest gameplay. 60 FPS limit.
Additionally, a category labeled HFR (High Framerate) is described as having &quot;an uncapped framerate and tweaks to graphic quality that allow for an even higher-framerate experience.&quot; It contains four options without descriptions, but Video Games Chronicle expounded on these which we’ve shared below:
High Framerate Quality: Quality mode with an uncapped framerate between 30-50 FPS.
High Framerate Performance: Performance mode with uncapped framerate over 60 FPS.
High Framerate Quality (VSync): Same as High Framerate Quality but with Vsync enabled. 
High Framerate Performance (VSync): Same as High Framerate Performance but with Vsync enabled.
Games with multiple graphical/performance options have become the norm in recent years, but Ghostwire: Tokyo may take the cake, and figuring out which one is “best” will depend on several factors (such as your monitor) as well as personal preference. 
Ghostwire: Tokyo launches March 25 on PlayStation 5 and PC. You can watch us tour its haunted streets in this episode of New Gameplay Today.

GhostWire Tokyo, one of our most anticipated horror games of 2022, is incredibly stylish. Developer Tango Gameworks&#x27; open-world environments are as ambitious as they are unsettling, as twisting hallways and shifting rooms give way to dreadful encounters with Yōkai – wayward spirits inspired by Japanese folklore. In this episode of New Gameplay Today, I sit down with Blake Hester to share our preview impressions from the second chapter of GhostWire Tokyo. We&#x27;re accompanied by footage from my hands-on gameplay session, which I captured via PS5 performance mode.

Halo: The Series is set to premiere on Paramount+ next week, on March 24, and to prepare viewers for the journey ahead, a new two-minute trailer has been released. 
The trailer features voice-over by multiple characters we’ll likely learn more about in the series, including what sounds like Dr. Halsey and others. It, of course, features plenty of the Covenant, including an Elite with a sword, and a handful of very-cool Master Chief moments.

As you can see in the trailer above, the narration that plays over it is all about the costs of protecting what’s sacred. As for what “sacred” is, it’s likely different for everyone involved. For Master Chief? It’s completing the mission, whatever it is. Like the trailers before this one, the series is looking great, and fortunately, we don’t have to wait long to watch it because it begins streaming on Paramount+ next week. 
In the meantime, watch the first teaser released for Halo: The Series and then read about how it’s already been renewed for a second season. You can also read about the decision to reveal Master Chief&#x27;s face in the show.

Disney has released the first official trailer for its upcoming Disney Plus series, Ms. Marvel, and it features Kamala Khan attempting to navigate the blinding lights of the life of a superhero. 
Hitting Disney’s subscription service on June 8, Ms. Marvel is, as the name implies, a series all about Ms. Marvel. However, before she becomes a hero, Kamala Khan, played by Iman Vellani, must work through all the responsibilities of he…</span>

In a presentation this morning, Capcom revealed plenty of new details on the upcoming Monster Hunter Rise expansion Sunbreak, including the announcement of its release date.
Sunbreak, an expansion Capcom has repeatedly described as being &quot;massive,&quot; will release on June 30 for both Nintendo Switch and PC. The digital edition of the DLC will be available for preorder today, producer Ryozo Tsujimoto revealed. Along with the base edition of Sunbreak, existing Monster Hunter Rise players will have the option to purchase a deluxe edition, which comes with additional cosmetics like Layered Armod, hairstyles, poses, and gestures. Preordering will net hunters a pair of adorable Palamute and Palico Layered Armor that make the animal companions look closer to their real-world pet counterparts.
Those who are new to Monster Hunter Rise, but want the whole experience when Sunbreak releases can purchase the Monster Hunter Rise + Sunbreak Set which bundles the full base game and the expansion together into one tidy package.
Announced to be released alongside Sunbreak is a new trio of Monster Hunter Amiibos. The set of three includes new Elder Dragon Malzeno and a Palamute and Palico each donning armor based on Malzeno. Using these Amiibos with the Switch version will grant players new Formal Dragon Layered Armor to use in-game.
A patch will be coming for all Monster Hunter Rise players on June 30 regardless of Sunbreak ownership status. The update will require about 13GB of storage space and will accommodate for weapon balance changes and new content coming to the game with the release of Sunbreak. This patch will be required for online play moving forward.
If you&#x27;re interested in trying out Monster Hunter Rise with Sunbreak looming on the horizon, Nintendo is offering a free trial for Switch Online subscribers this week.</span>

Babylon’s Fall, the latest from PlatinumGames and Square Enix, did not pan out well critically, with a 42% on Metacritic for PlayStation 5 versions and an even lower 37% on Metacritic for PC. 
It’s one of PlatinumGames’ worst-reviewed titles ever, but it seems Square Enix isn’t ready to give up on the live-service title just yet. That’s because the publisher has reportedly sent out surveys to players asking them how the game can be improved, as reported by Eurogamer. More specifically, the survey recently sent out is all about the graphics and visuals of Babylon’s Fall, and finding a way to “bring everyone an even better game experience.” 
Eurogamer reports that the survey asks players about their thoughts on the visuals of characters, equipment, NPCs, enemies, locales, battle effects, the UI, and the overall oil painting “brushwork” art style of Babylon’s Fall. The survey concludes by asking survey-takers what specific element of Babylon’s Fall’s visuals would need to be changed before they’d consider recommending the game to someone else. 
However, as anyone who’s played Babylon’s Fall or has read reviews for it know, there are multiple problems beyond the visual elements that make it hard to recommend. Perhaps Square Enix will canvass players about all of the elements viewed more negatively in the game and then fix each one so that with all of the fixes together, people might be able to recommend the game to someone. That remains to be seen, of course. 
If you’re curious about checking the game out yourself, you can do so thanks to a free PlayStation demo for Babylon’s Fall that’s available right now. For more info about the game, check out Game Informer’s Babylon’s Fall hub.

Grand Theft Auto V is out today, again, this time as a new-gen game for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, and perhaps unsurprisingly, its load times are great. 
They’re so great, in fact, that playing on new-gen consoles is going to save you a lot of time in Los Santos. That’s because load times are more than 150% faster in some cases and even at the new-gen versions’ w…</span>

Nejde pravda o nijak významnou a užitečnou aplikaci, ale hra ukazuje, jak může být řadič RP2040 výkonný v rukou zkušeného programátora.</span>

The Rune Factory series, a spin-off of Story of Seasons, combines action/RPG combat with its sibling’s farming and social elements. Now, almost a decade after Rune Factory 4’s debut on 3DS, a new Rune Factory game is just around the corner as a Switch exclusive on March 22. We chatted with director Shiro Maekawa to give you an idea of what you can expect, from the fun festivals to powering up Link Attacks with other town members.  
It’s been a long road to Rune Factory 5. Many fans were worried about the series’ future, especially with Neverland closing. Can you discuss the journey to get this long-awaited entry off the ground?

                              <span>Russia openly attacked and invaded Ukraine on February 24 after weeks of mounting tensions between the two countries, with hundreds of Ukrainian citizens reportedly killed by bombings and Russian militia as a result. As the world watches this historical and terrifying event unfold, efforts have begun to aid civilians and organizations on the ground floor and those displaced, like the Ukrainian Red Cross. Many of these efforts have come from studios within the video game industry, some in the form of charity drives, others with public displays of support for Ukraine.

Forspoken, the upcoming title from Luminous Productions and this month’s cover story, largely takes place in the magical world of Athia. Unfortunately, the realm has seen better days, as a creeping corruption has flooded the once-prosperous land. The Break, as the destructive fog is known in the game, has the power to corrupt anything it touches. Humans become hostile and mindless, animals morph into monsters, and even the land itself takes on a bizarre appearance.
While there have been several trailers for Forspoken, much of them take place in a dry, desert-looking region. This land is just outside Cipal, the last d…</span>

Hosted by AbleGamers’ Steven Spohn and Sony Santa Monica studio writer Alanah Pearce, this awards show highlighted what studios were doing to make games more accessible to everyone through nine categories, as reported by IGN. Here’s a roundup of all the studios that won, and their winning title, in each category:

                              <span>If you can’t get enough of everyone’s favorite blue blur, or Tails and Knuckles, as they’re depicted in Paramount Pictures’ movies, then we have some good news for you: there’s a “pre-quill” comic book for Sonic the Hedgehog 2 coming out later this month. 
As reported by Sonic Stadium, this prequel comic will lead into Sonic the Hedgehog 2 before it hits theaters on April 8 and part of it will be helmed by the movie’s own Dr. Robotnik, Jim Carrey. That’s because the comic book isn’t one big story but rather, five stories about different characters from the movie spread across 40 pages. One of these five stories will be centered on Dr. Robotnik and according to Sonic Stadium, Carrey is “spearheading” it. 
However, it’s important to note that Carrey does not have a writer’s credit in the comic solicitation so it’s likely that he simply helped out with the narrative, or shared ideas with the comic’s writer, Keil Phegley. 
“Catch up with Sonic and friends, if you can, in this exclusive prequel to 2022’s most anticipated family film,” the comic book’s solicitation reads, according to Sonic Stadium. “Life is good in Green Hills for Sonic the Hedgehog…maybe too good. He’s starting to get bored, and when Sonic gets bored, things become a lot less boring for everyone else – fast. Quicker than you can say, ‘Chili Dog,’ the Fastest Thing Alive is saving the day and causing all sorts of chaos along the way. Plus, new and returning characters starring in the Sonic the Hedgehog 2 film take the lead in stories of their own.” 
For more about Sonic, check out this awesome poster for the movie, and then watch the final trailer for Sonic the Hedgehog 2 released today. Read about Sonic Frontiers, which drops the blue blur into his first open-world game, after that.

Its quiet, meditative approach to gameplay and emphasis on multiplayer that promotes connection rather than competition was, for the time, especially novel. The game accrued a massive fan base, countless awards, and recognition from not only the game industry but the art world at large. 
More personally, it completely changed composer Austin Wintory&#x27;s life. Nowadays, he&#x27;s one of the more recognizable names in video game soundtracks. Though it wasn&#x27;t his first job, or even his first time working with Thatgamecompany (he composed the soundtrack to the studio&#x27;s first commercial game, Flow), it was the project that put him on the map.

System Shock 3 has quite the troubled development history, chronicled in Part 3 of Game Informer’s Games Stuck In Development Hell feature, and it seems the game has been pushed even deeper into development hell. 
In a new interview with VentureBeat, Deux Ex creator Warren Spector gave what sounds like will be his final comments in regards to System Shock 3, especially now that his studio, OtherSide Entertainment, is working on a new IP. When asked if OtherSide Entertainment’s work on the threequel had come to an end, Spector said there’s not much more clarification he can give at this point.

Hogwarts Legacy, the mysterious and long-awaited RPG set in the Harry Potter universe, will finally get its first gameplay showing in a new State of Play airing this week. 
PlayStation tweeted the news this morning stating that the presentation airs Thursday, March 17 at 2 p.m. Pacific/5 p.m. Eastern. There’s no word on how long it will be, but the tweet refers to it as an “extended look,” so that hopefully means we’re in for a deep dive on everything Hogwarts Legacy entails.

March 14, 2022
Hogwarts Legacy was first announced during the PlayStation 5 showcase in 2020. The open-world action RPG casts you in the role of a Hogwarts student and is being developed by Avalanche Software. Author J.K. Rowling has not been directly involved in the game’s development, which had been a concern to some fans in the wake of her controversial statements regarding the transgender community in recent years. Hogwarts Legacy was initially scheduled to launch in 2021, but in January of that year, it was delayed to 2022. 
Although Hogwarts Legacy has mainly been shown on PlayStation stages and is coming to PS5 and PS4, it’s also launching on Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC.</span>

Masahiro Sakurai, the famed director behind Nintendo’s mega-hit Super Smash Bros. franchise, is back from a long break after completing development on Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, it seems. And while he’s back to work, a new statement from the director teases that what he’s working on might not be a video game. 
News of Sakurai’s return to work comes from Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu, as translated by GoNintendo, which reports that Sakurai has revealed that he is, in fact, working on something. As for what, we might find out in the near future but Sakurai hints that it might not be related to gaming in any way. 
“I have been away for a while now, but I am working on something,” Sakurai told Famitsu, as translated by GoNintendo. “My eyes may be a little tired. You may see me in the near future in a place that has nothing to do with game production. You may or may not be able to see me. I hope to see you again in the future. Thank you very much for your time.” 
As you can see in the statement above, Sakurai seems to be dropping hints to his fans that they shouldn’t be expecting a new game from him anytime soon. Perhaps he’s working on something that’s very behind-the-scenes, or maybe he’s jumped industries and is now working in movie production or something like that. Only time will tell. 
For now, read about Sakurai’s journey to get Sora from Kingdom Hearts, the final fighter in Ultimate, in the game, and then check out this story about how Sakurai isn’t thinking about a sequel to Ultimate but won’t rule one out despite that. Read about how Sakurai thinks the next game in the Smash Bros. series would need a smaller roster and less dependence on his own vision after that.

Sonic the Hedgehog 2 hits theaters in just a few weeks, on April 8, and today, Paramount Pictures has released the final trailer for the sequel. 
If you’ve been watching the trailers for Sonic the Hedgehog 2 as of late, then you know Paramount and Sega are unsurprisingly pushing the return of Robotnik and the introduction of Tails and Knuckles to the fray. Also, unsurprisingly, Robotnik, Tails, Knuckles, and of course, Sonic look great in this final trailer.

Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands is right around the corner, hitting PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on March 25, and we now know it will launch with full crossplay support across each of these platforms. 
Gearbox Software’s own Randy Pitchford revealed the news with a tweet thanking the engineers behind Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands for making crossplay happen.

Even if you love Final Fantasy games, expect to feel like a stranger in a strange land when playing Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin. This violent retelling of the original Final Fantasy game from 1987 largely sidesteps the series’ adventurous spirit and heartfelt mysticism to focus on muscle, attitude, and everything extreme. Square Enix labels this remake as a “hardcore action/RPG,” an apt description for a game that rarely relents in its aggression.

The targets include Lookmovie and Cuevana3, both of which have millions of regular visitors. The suspensions, issued by the .io domain registry, are likely related to copyright issues. However, the two sites are not giving up and have swiftly relocated to new homes.

                              <span>The remake of 2008 limb-lopping horror game Dead Space should launch in early 2023, EA have now said. This comes off the back of a developer stream on Friday which showed off (sounded off? hearded off? noised off?) some of the fancy new noises and noise technologies they&#x27;re working on. It sounds pretty good. And sounds pretty good, too.

Riot&#x27;s unspecified share isn&#x27;t large enough to buy control of Fortiche, but they say &quot;this agreement ensures we&#x27;ll be working closely for decades to come.&quot; Fortiche&#x27;s League animations have been better than Riot&#x27;s games so yeah, go on, I&#x27;ll take more. They&#x27;re currently working on a second season of Arcane.

You hear nothing but ambient city sounds and the tromping of a cameraman&#x27;s feet. You could be watching a HUD-free FPS, albeit with incredi-graphics. Finally, in Ghostwire: Tokyo, someone has made a game of it, albeit with occasional ghost zapping.

In listing out the status of their own games, Microsoft say that Psyconauts 2 is &quot;Verified&quot; - meaning it&#x27;s fully supported - while Sea Of Thieves is merely &quot;playable&quot; and Halo Infinite isn&#x27;t supported at all due to its anti-cheat.

Hopefully those games will be better supported in future, but, Microsoft say, &quot;It&#x27;s up to our studios how they fit Steam Deck integration for their games into their busy schedules.&quot;

                              <span>The highest court in the Netherlands has ruled that card packs in FIFA Ultimate Team are not a form of gambling. The ruling overturns a decision from 2019 that ruled that they were, and rescinds a €10 million fine given to EA for breaching Dutch gambling law.

After tackling Metroid in season 1 and then Halo in season 2, Game Informer&#x27;s Video Gameography podcast turns its gaze to one of Sony&#x27;s biggest properties: Uncharted. Season 3 officially comes to a close with our discussion of Uncharted: The Lost Legacy. 
Released August 22, 2017 – less than a year after Uncharted 4 – Lost Legacy puts Chloe Frazer in the starring role for the first time. She&#x27;s not alone, however; former antagonist Nadine Ross partners with her, leading to an odd-couple-style treasure hunt that may be shorter than Uncharted 4 but was just as entertaining. Prior to this, Naughty Dog batted around other combinations of characters for this adventure including Sully and Sam Drake. How did the team turn The Lost Legacy around so quickly after A Thief&#x27;s End? What&#x27;s the deal with that &quot;wimpy&quot; train explosion? Listen here to hear the answers to these questions and more. 
Join hosts Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), Ben Reeves (@BenjaminReeves), and former Game Informer intern O&#x27;Dell Harmon Jr. (@ODellHarmonJr) as we unpack the history and narrative of the final Uncharted game to date. Tune to also find out the game series that will be the topic for Season 4!

This week&#x27;s episode is hitting a little later than usual. The reason? Our local comic shops in Minnesota didn&#x27;t get any Marvel comic books last week. We felt the show would be a little light without them, so we held off until we could get our hands on those books. The wait was worth it: The first issue of Strange is an absolute delight and a fantastic direction for the Sorcerer Supreme to go in.
Most of this episode is dedicated to new comic book releases that hit this week and last. We also dive into The Batman, which I give a score and review to, and also discuss Gotham Knights&#x27; new release date!

From Panel to Podcast is a weekly show created by two lifelong comic book readers who offer suggestions on which comic books you should be reading each week.

We&#x27;ll even discuss comic book collectibles and anything we think you should know about that pertains to this entertainment medium.

                              <span>It’s Friday yet again, and you know what that means: It’s time for another edition of Weekend Warrior! This week has been an absolute whirlwind with the Sony State of Play on Wednesday, plenty of new game reviews hitting the site (check out Destiny 2: The Witch Queen, Gran Turismo 7, Triangle Strategy, and WWE 2K22), and the announcement and digital release of our newest issue of Game Informer featuring Square Enix and Luminous Productions’ gorgeous Action/RPG Forspoken. Our team is certainly ready to kick back and relax for the weekend.
Here’s what the GI crew are up to over the next couple of planetary spins:

                              <span>Do you smell that? That’s the smell of justice, courtesy of John Cena, err, Peacemaker. If you haven&#x27;t had your fill of The Suicide Squad and James Gunn’s accompanying Peacemaker TV show on HBO Max and are looking for more from everyone’s favorite murderous justice-deliverer man, then Funko has you covered with five new Pop figures. 
Revealed today with new looks at each that you can see in the gallery below, these Funko Pop figures are perfect for any fan looking to add Vigilante, Judomaster, Eagly, and of course, Cena’s no-pants Peacemaker (and a version of Peacemaker holding Eagly), to their Pop collection.

These figures are now available for preorder too for roughly $12.99 to $14.99 each, depending on which one you’re curious to pick up. These figures will be released on July 23.

On this week&#x27;s episode of All Things Nintendo, Brian is joined by fellow Game Informer editor John Carson to run down all the latest news in the world of Nintendo – and there is a lot this week! Then, Game Informer&#x27;s Kimberley Wallace subs in for the final two segments to give her in-depth thoughts about Triangle Strategy, the new tactical RPG from Square Enix, and her picks for Definitive Ranking and eShop Gem of the Week.

Forspoken is a story-heavy game with the narrative mainly tying into the central quest. But Forspoken is not a linear game, and with such a vast, open world, we wondered what happens if you step off the golden path. To satisfy our curiosity, we recently sat down with developer Luminous Productions and got our first look at the game’s various side activities and optional objectives you can find around the map. Besides seeing more of the magical parkour in action and noticing the plethora of crafting materials lying around the realm, the team walked us through crafting in Refuges, enhancing stats at Monuments, finding …</span>

EA has released a new two-minute look at gameplay from its upcoming Dead Space Remake and it features a quick look at Isaac Clarke laying waste to a Necromorph. 
Revealed today during a special Dead Space Remake developer update stream focused on the title’s audio, this look at gameplay showcased a small snippet of protagonist Isaac walking around a very spooky section of the Ishimura before he’s attacked by a Necromorph. Fortunately, he has his newly-remade 211-V Plasma Cutter.

A not-so-long time ago in the same galaxy we all reside in, Respawn Entertainment deviated from its first-person shooter roots to create Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. This third-person action game was the studio’s first stab at tackling the coveted Star Wars license, crafting an original adventure set five years after Revenge of the Sith. It stars Cal Kestis, a padawan turned junker (played by Shameless star Cameron Monaghan) that manage…</span>

WWE 2K22’s long road to release stands as a redemption story as dramatic as any of the TV storylines. The series took a few years off to regroup following the trainwreck that was 2019’s 2K20, and the time away allowed it to learn some useful new holds. Though it doesn’t catapult the franchise to bold new heights, a revamped gameplay engine and a renewed focus on approachability make it the most entertaining – and most of all, playable – WWE game in some time.
The new engine strips away some of the complicated mechanics that made the pre…</span>

Elden Ring is a hard game. It’s a From Software Soulsborne game so that’s no surprise. Be it a mouse and keyboard or a controller, bosses like Godrick the Grafted will undoubtedly give you some trouble in Elden Ring. 
Now, imagine fighting Godrick with some bananas. Like real edible bananas that you can find at any grocery store. Sounds impossible, right? Well, somehow it’s not because SuperLouis_64 on Twitter recently posted a video showing him do just that, as reported by Eurogamer. 
THE BANANA CONTROLLER WORKS 🍌

As you can see in the video above, SuperLouis_64 plays Elden Ring with bananas as well as some of us do on intended controllers (better than me, at least – I’ll be honest). He seems to be using bananas on the bottom left to control his Tarnished’s movement while his right hand seems to use three bananas to control attacks and dodges. Of course, this is pure speculation because the official Banana control scheme for Elden Ring has not yet been released by From Software (we eagerly await the day, though). 
News of SuperLouis_64 tropical feat comes just days after someone beat Elden Ring in under three hours without dying a singe time. In other news, I am not as good at Elden Ring as I thought I was, it seems. 
If you need help in Elden Ring, Game Informer has you covered, though. Check out our guide on how to beat Godrick the Grafted and then read our guide on Elden Ring’s best rune farming location. After that, check out this guide on how to find Elden Ring’s best summon spirit, and then read about this tactic that will help you easily beat every boss in Elden Ring.

Another month, another roundup of U.S. NPD numbers and not surprisingly, Elden Ring was the best-selling game of February. 
Elden Ring is also the best-selling game of 2022 year-to-date and what’s more is that it is secured the second-best launch month sales of any title in the past 12 months, coming in second only to last November’s Call of Duty: Vanguard. On top of that, after just one month on the U.S. video game market, Elden Ring is already ranked as the fifth best-selling game over the past year. It ranked first on both Xbox consoles and PC, coming in second on PlayStation hardware.…</span>

It is important to keep in mind what is going on within Activision Blizzard at this time regarding ongoing allegations about the work culture. The ongoing lawsuit from the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) against the company is over reported toxic workplace culture. The bulk of the suit focuses on &quot;violations of the state&#x27;s civil rights and equal pay laws,&quot; specifically regarding the treatment of women and other marginalized groups.

                              <span>Made public this week was the Spectre-BHB / BHI vulnerability and while only Intel and Arm processors are currently believed to be impacted, in the course of that research the folks at VUSec discovered AMD&#x27;s current Retpoline strategy for Spectre V2 mitigations is not adequate. This has led to a change in behavior for AMD processors and is already applied to the Linux kernel. Here is a look at what it means for desktop and server performance due to the change in return trampoline handling.</span>

This executable / object code / shared library file format was used prior to the dominance of ELF but is seldom if ever used today.

                              <span>I can&#x27;t remember if I&#x27;ve mentioned this to you, dear readers, but I am currently mid-emigration. In about two weeks I&#x27;m moving to Ireland, which means for the past four months my live has been hellish. The paperwork the move involves, especially now we have from our European womb been untimely ripped, is a Kafkaesque nightmare. To ship my stuff without incurring importation tax I need to prove I&#x27;m going to live in Ireland and not just sell a bunch of second hand cutlery and old bras (one of those two things would probably be pretty lucrative, in fairness). This is all complicated even furtherer by the fact that I only found a flat to move to yesterday, and still don&#x27;t have the tenancy agreement for it, which means no proof of address. Life, oh life.
I don&#x27;t really have the option to have a piece of toast and watch the evening news, because when I&#x27;m not scanning my passport or estimating what worth to attach to my towels for the purposes of the shipping company&#x27;s insurance, I am packing said towels into boxes, along with everything else I own. Basically the only free time I have is my lunch break. And what I am doing in my lunch break is making huge, virtual jigsaw puzzles in Jigsaw Puzzle Dreams. It&#x27;s either that or go and sit in the toilets and have a little stress-cry. And as the move date approaches, the size of the puzzles has increased. On Thursday I started one that is 6k pieces. This may have been a miscalculation.

It launched in May 2021 in a sorry state and, while developers Frontier have been fixing it up, it&#x27;s still a mess now. This week Frontier announced that to help focus their efforts on fixing Odyssey, they&#x27;re cancelling the yet-unreleased console version. Good news for us on PC, I suppose, but oof! &quot;This was not an easy decision to make, but it was made with the long-term future of Elite Dangerous in mind,&quot; Frontier frontman David Braben said.

                              <span>Earlier this week, indie developers launched an amazing bundle with over 600 video games to raise money for charities helping relief efforts in Ukraine following Russia&#x27;s invasion. The Bundle For Ukraine smashed its $1 million goal in under a day, hit the second goal of $2 million hours later, and has now passed the third goal of $4 million. It is still a ridiculous bargain, offering so much if you pay at least $10.

                              <span>April 1st will bring the start of the London Games Festival, a loosely affiliated series of events which almost inevitably involves some poor fella in a Sonic costume posing for press photos on Westminster Bridge. Today, the Festival announced its Official Selection, 33 games which will be showcased online and in various events. Some good games in there, including PowerWash Simulator and Failbetter&#x27;s Mask Of The Rose.

                              <span>Aztech is a superb name for a game, and almost makes describing its premise redundant. Throwing in that it&#x27;s from the same developers who made Mulaka meant I had to give it a go.
I&#x27;m glad I did. Aztech No Colon Forgotten Gods starts with its weaker foot, showing rough edges right away, but that’s overshadowed by its entertaining movement system. During its opening, a quest prompt tells you to go home to sleep, as though they didn&#x27;t just give you a magical power arm that&#x27;s also a goddamn rocket.
My home was a short walk away. I didn&#x27;t get there for 40 minutes.

                              <span>Valve have gathered up some crucial Windows drivers for the Steam Deck, improving performance for those who want to ditch the default SteamOS and replace it with Windows 10. GPU, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth drivers are all available from Steam Support, so early Deck adopters looking for a change can get the requisite downloads all in one place.


These drivers come with caveats, mind. Audio drivers are still a work in progress, so only USB-C, 3.5mm, or Bluetooth headphones can output sound on Windows, and Valve’s post explains that dual-booting support still isn’t ready yet. Installing Windows, then, is an all-or-nothing switch that involves wiping SteamOS entirely.

                              <span>When Square Enix first released RPG classic Chrono Trigger on PC in 2018, it was in a sorry state. Their &#x27;updated&#x27; version was worse than the 1995 original, with blurry sprites, ugly menus, an incongruous font, and other problems. But they fixed it up a lot with patches, and now, almost four years since the last patch, they&#x27;ve applied a fresh coat of polish with another welcome update.

                              <span>The latest weekly giveaway on the Epic Games Store is a nice one, with Cities: Skylines free for keepsies if you grab it by next Thursday. First released in 2015, it&#x27;s a city-building game that&#x27;s quite nice to play around with, putting your utopian visions and public transport dreams into practice or simply seeing if you can do better than your local planners (council? more like clowncil, eh? right? eh? that&#x27;s them told).

                              <span>Gods. Those jerks. You know what the problem with god games is? They&#x27;ve got no subtlety. It&#x27;s all open worship and overt power, conquering and seizing so you&#x27;re only superficially different to a 4X or management game.


Shadows Of Forbidden Gods is different. It&#x27;s all about building the power of your evil god under the radar until it&#x27;s too late for anyone to defeat you. The more I&#x27;ve played it, the more I start to suspect that this concept will always suffer from being gamed by player who&#x27;ll seek the most efficient paths. Any system of influencing and manipulating characters will necessarily be abstracted, and at some point subtlety becomes just another numerical value.


I suppose what I&#x27;m saying is that SOFG is more fun if you revel in scheming and causing chaos, and given the choice between effective and interesting, will always do the right thing.

It can trade on other people&#x27;s glories by spaffing off blockchain rubbish and hotels that won&#x27;t get built and bad microconsoles and endless re-releases with the logo and rights it bought, and I&#x27;ll think it&#x27;s stupid but basically not care (aside from that cryptojunk, which is abhorrent). This has now changed with the news that the creature wearing the skin of Atari has bought MobyGames, the extremely good video games database. No, creature, please don&#x27;t touch things I use and care about.

                              <span>This episode of the Electronic Wireless Show podcast is all about our favourite mounts in video games - as in, animals that carry you around in games. Not cars. Machines don&#x27;t count as mounts, I think we can all pre-agree on that. We discuss a lot of different horses, and some things that are not horses, from a bunch of different games. This is an unfortunate crossover with our &#x27;best horses&#x27; special, which I forgot we had done. Also, Nate and I get angry at Metal Gear Solid.
There are some traditional digressions, although there&#x27;s no substantial Henry Cavill update this week. We spend some time discussing which dinosaur we would most like to ride as a mount, and whether we would rather fight one The Rock sized spider, or 30 spider sized The Rocks. This week&#x27;s Cavern of Lies is WoW-themed, and if you&#x27;d like to listen along to Latvia&#x27;s Eurovision entry this year then here&#x27;s the link. Be warned that it is NSFW.

                              <span>Social media sucks doesn&#x27;t it? You sign up for a feed of dross that never stops, like you&#x27;ve paid for a rotten Fruit Winder that simply won&#x27;t stop unwinding. Others who&#x27;ve bought into the same Fruit Winder exchange thoughts on its sour taste, until yet more, who quite like the flavour, come to its defense in droves. A war of words ensues over whether the Fruit Winder tastes nice. And it&#x27;s not even a Fruit Winder, it&#x27;s an app called Facebook, or Twitter, or Instagram, for goodness sakes.
Admittedly, there is something gratifying about popping off on social media. Even just getting a few likes for a dumb joke can make you feel alive. So, I say you swap Twitter for Elden Ring, a superior social media platform: You leave players helpful messages or total dross, it gets appraised, you feel great. Invading other worlds is a more interactive way of making friends and/or enemies too – it&#x27;s perfect.

                              <span>One of my earliest video game memories is at the swimming pool, where a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles arcade cabinet nestled amongst the vending machines. After a swim I&#x27;d stare longingly at the snacks I couldn&#x27;t afford then stand on tip-toes before the game I couldn&#x27;t afford to play, waggling a joystick and mashing buttons to pretend I was controlling the attract mode demo. Appealing to this sort of nostalgia, Konami have announced they&#x27;re releasing a collection of 13 vintage Ninja Turtles games.

                              <span>This article contains spoilers for Lost Ark&#x27;s main questline.


Lost Ark is a very silly game, but not in the way it initially seems. For its first 15 hours or so, Smilegate&#x27;s ARPG is like someone described Lord of the Rings to the developers through a door, an overblown yet generic riff on Western fantasy tropes with overdesigned yet underwritten characters, all of whom talk about the game&#x27;s plainly ridiculous lore with the gravity of a neutron star. The game&#x27;s ignorance of its own absurdity is funny, but the story itself is not much fun.


This begins to change once you approach level 50. After completing the continent of East Luterra, Lost Ark suddenly explodes in scale. It gives you a ship, and sets you off on a massive globetrotting adventure, with around a dozen other continents to explore, and dozens more tiny islands, each with their own little questlines. Your first destination across Lost Ark&#x27;s ocean is an island called Tortoyk (pronounced like &quot;Tortoise&quot;, but with a K), and it&#x27;s here where the game stops pretending to be a serious high-fantasy adventure, revealing itself to be something much more entertaining.

As a big kid, those are some words I&#x27;m interested in alright. It&#x27;s set in the near future, where mysterious Vortexes open in the skies to rain torrents of surprised dinosaurs, and we have to beat them back in exosuit mechs. These dinohordes remind me a bit of Earth Defense Force, maybe, and I&#x27;m certainly up for that.

                              <span>Thirty years ago, a small team based in Kyoto, Japan, came together to create a new kind of action game. Drawing inspiration from prior projects, that team released Super Mario Bros. in 1985 – a title that would go on to help console gaming step back from the brink of ruin. Since then, Mario’s influence has spread far beyond the games in which he appears. He helped turn Nintendo into an industry leader, and became a cultural icon. Super Mario Bros. started a revolution, and in the process, became one of the most recognizable franchises in the world.

In the first 35 years of the Super Mario series, Mario and his friends appeared in hundreds of titles, but in the core “Super Mario” series, the plumber was present in just under 20 titles. Since Super Mario Maker and Super Mario Maker 2 are such a unique experiences that are more along the lines of a creation toolset than an actual game, we decided to leave them off of the list.
Even so, the Super Mario series doesn’t have a bad entry to date, so this list proved difficult to put together in an order we all felt comfortab…</span>

It is important to keep in mind what is going on within Activision Blizzard at this time regarding ongoing allegations about the work culture. The ongoing lawsuit from the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) against the company is over reported toxic workplace culture. The bulk of the suit focuses on &quot;violations of the state&#x27;s civil rights and equal pay laws,&quot; specifically regarding the treatment of women and other marginalized groups.

                              <span>Lego Mario has been a hit for Nintendo it seems because both it and Lego are continuing to collaborate to create new experiences and Lego-vized versions of beloved characters in the Mushroom Kingdom. 
After revealing Lego Luigi last year, who is playable alongside Lego Mario and all of the Super Mario Lego sets revealed thus far, Nintendo has now revealed that everyone’s favorite Mushroom Kingdom princess is becoming a Lego this August. What’s more is that Peach is getting her very own course too: Adventures with Peach Starter Course. 
Fun-packed new #LEGOSuperMario Expansion Sets and characters are coming later this year, including the fabulous new LEGO Peach! #Mar10Day

As you can see in the tweet above, Lego Peach is looking great! She’ll be an excellent addition in existing sets, but she fits right in to the new Super Mario 64, Super Mario World, and Super Mario 3D World expansion sets joining the Mushroom Kingdom Lego universe. 
Nintendo (kinda) revealed these new expansions today for Mario Day alongside the new Peach figurine, but it didn’t go as far as to name them. However, fans of Mario will surely recognize which game each set is inspired by. The one on the left in the picture below is clearly reminiscent of Super Mario 64, the one in the middle looks a lot like Yoshi’s home/hideout/do dinosaurs own property in the Mushroom Kingdom (?) from Super Mario World, and finally, the set on the right features a cat goomba and climbing tree seen throughout Super Mario 3D World. 
Lego Peach and the Adventures with Peach Starter Course set will be available this August. As for the new expansion sets, a release date has not yet been revealed. 
For more about Lego, check out Lego Luigi and then check out this official boxed Lego Super Mario 64 set after that.

I don’t know about you, but Lego Star Wars was my go-to party game in middle school. The hilarious adventures I had when playing through the classic trilogy and its prequels continue to be some of my favorite co-op memories. The Skywalker Saga is slated to amplify the comedy and expand the universe. A new behind-the-scenes trailer provides exciting details about what the dev team is putting together for Star Wars fans, and it looks marvelous. For instance, assistant game director Dewi Roberts mentioned the sheer level of freedom that players wi…</span>

Persona 4 Arena Ultimax makes its triumphant return with new ports releasing on PlayStation 4, PC, and Switch next week. I&#x27;ve had the game in my hands for the last couple of nights fighting in and out of the Midnight Channel, exploring this new version of the fighting game pseudo-sequel to Persona 3 and 4, and grasping Arc System Work&#x27;s mechanics once again.
Well, what exactly is this port of Ultimax, and is it different from the prior release on PS3 and Xbox 360? To put …</span>

                              <span>Sony Interactive Entertainment has announced that it is suspending all sales and shipments of both hardware and digital goods in Russia amidst its ongoing invasion of Ukraine. 
Joining the likes of Microsoft and Nintendo and dozens of other studios and publishers who have done the same, PlayStation is showing its support for Ukraine by effectively cutting Russia off from its services and titles. SIE called for peace in Ukraine in a statement to The Verge alongside this news. 
“Sony Interactive Entertainment (SIE) joins the global community in calling for peace in Ukraine,” a spokesperson said. “We have suspended all software and hardware shipments, the launch of Gran Turismo 7, and operations of the PlayStation Store in Russia.”
This spokesperson also said that Sony announced a $2 million donation to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the NGO Save the Children to support those affected by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. 
For more, read Game Informer’s story about all of the video game studios and publishers that have shown public support for Ukraine amidst this conflict, as well as donating money to those affected.

This RPG brawler sports more depth than your run-of-the-mill beat ‘em up thanks to slick combat, enjoyable customization, and sharp writing. Whether you’re cutting down monsters alone or alongside a buddy, brawler connoisseurs should take notice.

                              <span>Nintendo is the latest company to halt sales and shipments of its products to Russia amidst its ongoing invasion of Ukraine. 
Joining the likes of Microsoft and PlayStation and dozens of other game studios, Nintendo has suspended all shipments to Russia for the “foreseeable future.” Still, the company did not say this was in support of Ukraine like most publishers and studios have, as reported by IGN. The publication reached out to Nintendo to ask if it’d be providing a message of support for Ukraine, and a Nintendo spokesperson said, “We would like to express our concern for all those affected by the conflict.” 
“We have decided to suspend shipping all Nintendo products to Russia for the foreseeable future,” Nintendo told IGN. “This is due to considerable volatility surrounding the logistics of shipping and distributing physical goods.” 
This news comes days after Nintendo placed the Russian eShop into maintenance mode, which prevents users from buying digital games, effectively suspending all sales and downloads in the country. As IGN points out, this wasn’t necessarily done in support of Ukraine either, at least not directly and publicly. Nintendo said its payment service no longer processed Russian Rubles, forcing the eShop to close temporarily. 
On top of all of this, Nintendo delayed Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp yesterday due to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. It did not announce a new release date for the game.

Soon after, the Alliance for Creativity revealed the &quot;shut down&quot; of two more &quot;streaming sites&quot; but that isn&#x27;t quite the full picture. Some pirates are well prepared.

Ideally, pirated streams should be taken offline within 105 minutes, before &quot;the damage is fully inflicted.&quot; The comments were made while many Ukrainians fight for their lives. UEFA is aware of the situation and notes that the requests are subject to a resolution of the military conflict.

There were Linux patches immediately posted for affected Intel and Arm processors while also making adjustments to AMD CPUs around its Retpoline handling. The VUSec security researchers that discovered BHI are recommending Retpolines be enabled for newer processors even those with hardware mitigations against Spectre V2, but that&#x27;s that performance cost? Here are some initial benchmarks.</span>

                              <span>Over a decade ago the major record labels agreed to remove DRM from music on Apple&#x27;s iTunes Store. ISP RCN believes that this move may have increased piracy and wants to know who was involved in this decision, to aid its defense in an ongoing piracy liability lawsuit. The New Jersey federal court has now rejected this request, noting that the DRM removal issue is irrelevant.

This includes foreign and local media outlets that refuse to regurgitate state propaganda.

                              <span>Half the point of the Steam Deck is that it’s portable, but the other half is that it’s a PC. With the right tools, then, you can plug into a monitor, add a mouse and keyboard, and get playing as if it were a (somewhat) conventional gaming rig. But how well does the Steam Deck work as a desktop PC, really? Valve’s use of the Linux-based SteamOS alone makes it less of a 1:1 equivalent to a Windows system, and its AMD APU was designed to handle the onboard display’s 1280x800 resolution – not 1080p and above.

                              <span>Have A Nice Death is a roguelike where you take control of an overworked Death, whose employees have ditched their jobs and run amok. You’ll journey into the bowels of your company, find the miscreants, and scythe them back into work.
Despite the game’s grim backdrop, it’s a joyful experience stacked with cracking combat and funny characters. The moreish roguelike hook is there, albeit with some early access hiccups to overcome. Give it some time and it could really shine, but whether it’ll get lost in the Steam release cycle before it even has a chance to fill out remains to be seen.

Due to launch next year, Snufkin: Melody Of Moominvalley will star the tootling nomad as he returns from his winter away only to find the Park Keeper has imposed order upon the freespirited valley by building parks everywhere. Sounds like a problem to be solved using friendship and mischief! It&#x27;s quite pretty too, check out the trailer below.

I&#x27;m glad to see it&#x27;s got a good amount of chat, not all Beastie Boys and laser guns, but I can&#x27;t get past one point. The voice actor filling in for Leonard Nimoy as Ambassador Spock sounds like he&#x27;s doing an impression of Diablo&#x27;s Deckard Cain. Stay awhile, watch, and listen.

                              <span>Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla enters its endgame phase with its final DLC Dawn Of Ragnarök, the very concept for which is kind of a big honking spoiler, so consider yourself forewarned.
The series as a whole is still electing to carry on with that subplot about super-advanced precursor god-people, like a chill friend who you ask to party knowing that they will, univited, bring along their mate who is really into a specific genre of sci-fi and will not stop derailing conversations to talk about it. In Valhalla this manifests as protagonist Eivor, Viking raider and big blonde buff meat sculpture, being the reincarnation of Odin, one of the aforementioned god-people. Dawn Of Ragnarök is Eivor dreaming that they are Odin for about 35 hours of adventuring and son-saving in the magical realm of Svartalfheim. That&#x27;s a pretty intense nap.

They, like what we’ve seen of the game itself, are pretty weird – the Nvidia GeForce GTX 1660 Super on the same tier as the much more powerful AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT, whaaa – but should be doable for most systems at 1080p.

It&#x27;s got me in its (melodic) hooks - and you can play it in your browser now.

                              <span>I&#x27;m not sure how I feel about the term &quot;boomer shooter&quot;. Given that it refers to new first-person shooters which evoke games from the &#x27;90s, shouldn&#x27;t they be millenial shooters? Fresh from killing napkins and mayonnaise, here come millenials to kill Shub-Niggurath.

This is clearly me fighting a losing semantic battle, but in any case, Humble&#x27;s Boomer Shooters Bundle has a lot of great games, including Dusk, Amid Evil, Ion Fury, HROT, and more for £9.05/$12.

                              <span>Every citybuilder is about keeping the districts of your city in balance, but Airborne Kingdom makes it rather more literal. As your flying metropolis expands, you have to apply propulsion machines - fabric wings, gigantic oars, pedal-powered rotors - to make sure it doesn&#x27;t tip dangerously this way or that. 

It&#x27;s delightful, and after a year on Epic&#x27;s game store, the Epic Games Store, it&#x27;s available on Steam.

These colourful JRPGs have been hiding some of the deepest and most satisfying levelling systems in all of gaming behind the world&#x27;s most obnoxious anime characters for years now.

The next brutal gauntlet is Disgaea 6 Complete, with a newly announced released date of June 28th. There&#x27;s also a new character trailer below, which sets out its stall. Can you survive it?

                              <span>Square Enix this week announced a four-and-a-bit-month delay for Forspoken, the open-world action-adventure game about a New Yorker pulled into a fantasy world. Previously due on the 24th of May, it&#x27;s now slated for the 11th of October. Sounds like Squeenix hope to make it the start of a new series, so they&#x27;re taking time to help ensure it&#x27;s proper good. Fair enough.

                              <span>Elden Ring has got me thinking again. Not about its terrible banter I adore or its rolling goats. My mind has turned to its elevators and how FromSoftware does them justice. They aren&#x27;t just tools to get from A to B but moving platforms that hide secrets or instill a sense of dread. Not to mention their little pressure plates - god they&#x27;re satisfying aren&#x27;t they?

                              <span>Built by two longtime RTS fans, The Fertile Crescent rekindles the age-old torch of elaborate strategy titles. Its combat and economy chains build on each other, a feat uncommon in the real-time strategy space. Despite taking cues from beloved franchises like WarCraft and Age of Empires, TFC carves out a niche with an unlikely ally: pomegranates. The Fertile Crescent trades the ol’ berry bush for pomegranate trees, a native of Western Asia.


Developers Anders Groenningsaeter and André Read from Wield Interactive looked to the past as they refined The Fertile Crescent’s economy. “Since childhood, André and I have been equally fascinated by RTS games and the Bronze Ages,” Groenningsaeter explained to me. “How we’ve been inspired by history has shaped the game. During the Bronze Ages, the usage of coins hadn’t taken root yet. It was still to a large extent a barter economy, and food played an important role.”

Today they release Update 0.3.3, with the main change being a new scoreboard which actually shows scores. They also now say that their multiplayer game where large teams compete over objectives will finally add voice chat with the next update, which is tentatively scheduled for early April.

The Bundle For Ukraine on Itch.io includes almost 600 games, and you can have the lot if you pay at least $10. Games include Celeste, A Short Hike, Superhot, Hidden Folks, and oh so many more worth mentioning. Barely 11 hours after launching, the bundle has already raised over $593,000 towards its $1 million goal. Probably because it&#x27;s a great deal for a good cause.

                              <span>The ruination of those behind pirate IPTV service Nitro TV now seems almost inevitable. A lawsuit filed by DISH Network could result in a $100m judgment and in another, filed by members of the Alliance for Creativity, the only defendant to appear has now failed to pay his lawyer. That leaves the possibility of another judgment, potentially in excess of $250 million.

To keep up with growth, the streaming giant has created a new position that brings together many facets of the company&#x27;s content protection work under one lead. Among other things, the ideal candidate will be required to support research on pirate streaming sites, cyberlockers, and other pirate platforms.

However, Russia has plans to live under sanctions if necessary, which may include the legalization of some software piracy. There has also been a call to unblock the country&#x27;s largest torrent site.

In the past few days, Activision Blizzard, Epic, and CD Projekt (including GOG) all announced plans to stop selling games or stop selling things in games to Russia, joining a list which also includes EA and Microsoft.

                              <span>Playing Elden Ring before its official launch was an honest experience. I&#x27;d flick the game online and see a few messages scrawled on the ground in glowing chalk. It was a Lands Between where &quot;try jumping&quot; wasn&#x27;t some evil trickery, and &quot;illusory wall ahead&quot; meant discovering a hidden passage.
Since the game&#x27;s release, the player messages have taken on a different complexion. Before, I trusted in our small community trying its best to get by. Now I must treat every message with caution as they fight amongst themselves. The world is awash with trolls and their terrible craic, but I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d have it any other way.

                              <span>Sci-fi colony management survival sim RimWorld is a cracking thing, with your efforts built upon on (and stymied by) a deep simulation of everyone&#x27;s minds and bodies. It&#x27;s a game which generates great stories, often delightful, often horrifying. This appears to have got it in trouble. Australia&#x27;s classification board last week gave RimWorld a rating of RC—Refused Classification. As a result, the game is no longer available to buy on Steam in Australia, though folks who already own it can still play.

                              <span>Simteract, the studio behind Train Life: A Railway Simulator, have announced their next project: a taxi tycoon sim called Urban Venture. In it, you&#x27;ll be taking to the streets of Barcelona as a professional driver, picking up customers and obeying traffic laws to get them from A to B. That&#x27;s the taxi bit. The tycoon bit comes a bit later, letting players build up their own business until they&#x27;ve got enough cars and staff to do the driving for them. It&#x27;s coming to early access on Steam toward the end of 2022, so let&#x27;s hail down an announcement trailer, shall we?

Considering its name that&#x27;s perhaps fitting; however, its two-decade anniversary shouldn&#x27;t go unnoticed.

But when she said she wanted me to do the first one, and that the first GOTY awarded on RPS was 2007&#x27;s Portal, I almost laughed. Does Portal hold up? Why even bother asking? Shut this whole article down. Of course it holds up. It&#x27;s Portal.
Of course, conventional bait-and-switch writing would dictate that this is the point where I tell you that, aha, after playing Portal again in the blinding light of 2022 it&#x27;s actually a heap of rubbish, such as could only otherwise be found on the streets on day ten of a two week bin-lorry strike. But obviously that is not the case, because we&#x27;re talking about Portal. If anything it&#x27;s even better than I remember. Like. It&#x27;s fuckin&#x27; Portal.

                              <span>&quot;Blimp&quot; is a great word and the Hindenburg robbed us of a world where we got to say it often.


Blimps is an odd game. At a glance, it looks like an Elite-esque trading game, but it&#x27;s more like... well. It&#x27;s more like a game from the time before genres. A confusing, poorly explained time that mostly produced rubbish but occasionally produced a strange little gem like this.


You run a little airship business, on paper. In practice, your job is to figure out how to make enough money to get out. Ideally within an hour.

I&#x27;m thinking that Halo 3 &quot;Believe&quot; one that featured a cool diorama, or Gears Of War teaming up with Gary Jules for an emotional rendition of Mad World. We just aren&#x27;t treated to the same level of grandeur nowadays. A few frames, Guns N&#x27; Roses, &quot;RATED M FOR MATURE&quot;. That&#x27;s our lot.
But Thailand clearly puts out good video game adverts. One of note features Elden Ring, a family, a strange trumpet noise, and a story as complex and obtuse as FromSoft&#x27;s offerings. Give it a watch below, you won&#x27;t be disappointed. More confused and emotional, perhaps.

I tried my darnedest to get into Dark Souls III when it first came out, but holy deathrattles, it was such a long, gruelling slog. Vordt of the Boreal Valley, the second (yes, second) boss of Dark Souls III, remains my lifelong nemesis. I just couldn&#x27;t get past it. I&#x27;m someone who always likes to be making forward, tangible progress when I play games, and banging my head against the same boss for hours on end is my idea of actual hell.
I&#x27;m no better at playing Elden Ring, to be honest. I spent a good couple of hours last night just trying to get past one of those big tentacle-beard monkey lads with the hollowed out stomachs on the way up to Stormveil Castle. Not even a named, actual sub-boss! And yet, I&#x27;m actually enjoying this version of Souls-style head-bashing a lot more than I&#x27;ve ever done before. And I think it&#x27;s to do with Elden Ring&#x27;s plentiful supply of save points.

                              <span>Elden Ring may be FromSoftware&#x27;s most approachable Soulsborne game but it&#x27;s still tough as nails. Especially when you can&#x27;t pause the action and take a breather, or like, dash downstairs because the microwave has pinged. But thankfully there&#x27;s a mod that lets you do just this, giving you peace of mind when faced with a bleep from your beloved 800W box. Worth a look, I reckon.

                              <span>The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050 might be the first GPU to benefit, in a roundabout way, from the bonkers price gouging that’s been spoiling the fun of graphics cards for nearly two years. In normal times, it wouldn’t make much sense to buy this £239 / $249 GPU – not because it’s the lowest in the RTX range, but because the much more powerful RTX 3060 would only cost a few notes more.


And yet, these are not normal times. While the MSI GeForce RTX 3050 Gaming X 8G model I’ve tested has already ballooned to £380 / $450, this leaves it looking like much more of a  genuine alternative to RTX 3060, which is generally around £500 in the UK. And while it’s ultimately still a 1080p specialist, the RTX 3050 takes a big step up from previous GTX XX50 GPUs by offering DLSS and ray tracing support.

                              <span>Babylon&#x27;s Fall is an online action-RPG developed by PlatinumGames, the devs behind excellent hack n&#x27; slashers like NieR Automata and Bayonetta. This is a studio that knows how to craft one-off stories filled with flashy combat, humour, and emotional gut-punches.
But the game is also Platinum&#x27;s first foray into the dreaded minefield of live service and it&#x27;s... not good. Aside from the teensiest glimpses of what could&#x27;ve been, the game is a bemusing cascade of loot and stats that don&#x27;t mean all that much. The combat has its moments but is largely bleh. The story is meh. And it&#x27;s all yours for £60 - heh?!

                              <span>Even the most minor character can accrue a rabid fandom. If there&#x27;s no outpouring of questionable illustration following the debut of your single-sentence plot-helper, then you&#x27;ve either failed at fiction or you are deeply blessed. Some breakaway characters begin as a joke, or an afterthought, some as a narrative necessity, or a kind of walking, talking environment art. Others are born as side characters to lighten the story because the main dudes frown too much and Derek from market research says frowns are &quot;cringe&quot;. Well, shut up, Derek. You&#x27;re cringe. Here are nine minor NPCs who became major players.

                              <span>Full disclosure: this episode of the Electronic Wireless Show podcast was initialy going to be called the best menial jobs in games special, but half way through we decided we didn&#x27;t like the term, and also that it was limiting the scope of the episode, so we changed it to regular jobs. Basically we&#x27;re talking about when you do normal work in games that isn&#x27;t hero-slaying-monster type stuff, you know?
A really bumper number of digressions this week, though. The train really gets derailed early as we start talking about Elden Ring, and thus, naturally, what bit of Matthew a king would steal for said king&#x27;s own body? (The answer is Matthew&#x27;s nice soft hair). We hear more about Nate&#x27;s orc/goblin dolls house too, of course, and at certain points in the podcast do manage to drag things back round to talking about the actual topic of the podcast. Plus, Nate has a Cavern Of Lies this week which is themed about, er, Nate.

                              <span>The Ziggurat is an imposing presence in the lakeside hub town of Babylon’s Fall, its broad, horizon-spanning arches giving away nothing about the kind of fantastical beasts and secrets you’ll find inside. Based on the Tower Of Babel, the mythological birthplace of all the world’s languages, it’s perhaps ironic that Square Enix and PlatinumGames’ latest hack and slash started life with its own kind of miscommunication. When it was first unveiled at E3 2018, it looked like PlatinumGames were doubling down on all the good stuff they’d delivered just a year earlier with Nier: Automata, giving us another high-octane, single player action game with a dizzying array of weapons and over the top soundtrack, all wrapped up in an enticing layer of gothic high fantasy as players fight their way skyward. 
A long silence then followed, release dates slipped again and again, and its single follow-up trailer during one of Sony&#x27;s 2019 State Of Play broadcasts remained as inscrutable as its iconic Ziggurat. It wasn’t until E3 2021 that the game’s true nature was finally revealed. Rather than being a solo adventure, Platinum and Square declared that not only would Babylon’s Fall be a primarily online multiplayer game, but that it was also going to be a live service game in the vein of Destiny and The Division. It was surprising, to say the least, but when I put the question to the PlatinumGames and Square Enix’s joint development team, Square Enix producer Junichi Ehara tells me that this was far from a sudden change of heart on their part: “From the very start of the project, it was decided that Babylon’s Fall would include the elements of high fantasy, hack-and-slash, and live service.”
