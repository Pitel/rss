                              <span>Game Awards reveal incoming?
Kojima Productions director Hideo Kojima continues his mischievous efforts to tease fans with iconography from his studio&#x27;s still-unannounced new title. Following on from the recent reveal of two of its main cast members, Kojima has now offered up a selection of mysterious symbols related to the project.
https://twitter.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1598512751436890114?s&#x3D;20&amp;t&#x3D;9x2KZB_zL0mBfqO8zPsKuQ
Kojima tweeted out a stark black image featuring three unique logo designs, all of which look like the type of emblems one might see on a flag or a company banner. Alongside the image, Kojima wrote a simple message &quot;Start a new journey&quot;, once again shrouding his studio&#x27;s next game with intrigue and mystery — as the Metal Gear Solid and Death Stranding creator is wont to do.
While we still do not have a title for the new game, we do know that it will star Elle Fanning of The Neon Demon and Maleficent fame, as well as Shioli Kutsuna, who eagle-eyed readers might have spotted in Marvel&#x27;s R-rated movie Deadpool 2. While there is no telling exactly when Kojima will play his hand and offer up more clarity on the new game, it should be noted that The Game Awards will take place next week — an annual event which Kojima has used frequently as an opportunity to offer updates on his studio&#x27;s work.
Ain&#x27;t no time like the present. I&#x27;d be very surprised if we don&#x27;t hear more info come December 8.

                              <span>Azumarill served me well
At 7PM ET on December 1, 2022, Game Freak unleashed the Charizard Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet event into the wild. After prepping earlier this week I went in with Azumarill, and caught it: my clear actually came from a group with two shinies in it! It was a fun time and I took screens all along the way. Here&#x27;s a look at some of the potential loot drops, and some stats to boot.
As a reminder, you can find the Charizard Tera Raid schedule here, and a guide for how to unlock it here.

Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet Charizard loot list
Here&#x27;s everything I earned when taking down the seven-star Charizard, so you have an idea of what to expect if you&#x27;re staking it out (remember, you can only catch one per save file):
Exp. Candy L x 25 (!)
Exp. Candy XL x 6
Rare Candy x2
Calcium x 7
Dragon Tera Shard x 15
TM157 x1
Ability Patch x1 (confirmed to not have a 100% drop rate)

Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet Charizard moves and stats
The Charizard from the event is a Dragon Tera Type, with fire and flying types as well. It clocks in at level 100, with the following moves:
Dragon Pulse (10/10)
Fire Blast (5/5)
Hurricane (10/10)
Focus Blast (5/5)
And the following stats:
HP - 297
Sp. Atk - 279
Sp. Def - 206
Speed - 236
Defense - 192
Attack - 183
Mine is &quot;modest by nature,&quot; and &quot;somewhat vain.&quot; It also provides the &quot;Mightiest Mark&quot; reward, which is a mark earned through catching a Pokemon in a seven-star Tera Raid battle. The title for the Mightiest Mark is &quot;Charizard the Unrivaled.&quot;
Does the Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet Charizard count as a Paldean Pokedex entry?
Seemingly, no. After catching it my Paldean Pokedex remained the same: ending at entry 400, just like it had at launch.
When the National Pokedex comes into play, it&#x27;ll likely fill out an entry then.

                              <span>The Monster Hunter party starts up on new platforms
Monster Hunter Rise is officially making its way to new platforms. Rise will launch for PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox One on January 20, 2023.
Initial leaks teased the info, and today, Capcom and the console manufacturers are confirming it. Monster Hunter Rise is heading to PlayStation and Xbox, and it&#x27;s also launching onto Xbox Game Pass for cloud, console, and PC on January 20.

Alongside the new platforms, some will also be getting some new features. The PS5 and Xbox Series X versions will get 4K and 60 FPS support, and PC will receive optimized keyboard and mouse controls. Advanced graphics settings are also coming to PC.
Across the board on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC, players will be able to turn on special screen filters. These can make the world Black and White, Sepia, Japanese or Warring Lands-style, to add a bit of a different look to the action.

More Hunters are on the way
Voice Chat is also being integrated into the PlayStation, Xbox, and PC versions of the game. And for PlayStation 5 owners, there will be some special adaptive trigger support, letting you really feel the impact of hits through the triggers.
Just base Monster Hunter Rise is arriving on January 20, while Sunbreak is expected to hit sometime in Spring 2023.
Previously, Monster Hunter Rise and its Sunbreak expansion have only been available on PC through Steam and on Nintendo Switch. Now, at least, there are some additional platforms to play on.
Sadly, those platforms aren&#x27;t going to interlink. Capcom notes that while PS4 and PS5 players can match with each other for multiplayer, Monster Hunter Rise will not support cross-play or cross-save with other platforms. So if you have a seasoned hunter on Switch or Steam already, you&#x27;ll need to start over on the new platforms.

Capcom have announced that Monster Hunter Rise will hit Game Pass in January 2023, a great entry in their brill beast-bashing series. Microsoft have also detailed some more of the games coming to Game Pass before then, including Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga next week. That one might be a fun way to distract the kiddywinkles over Christmas. Read on for more future Game Pass additions.

                              <span>Sometimes when we get sent review code for a game, the PR will say that they&#x27;ll be getting PC code later, but if we want we can have a console code so we can get a head start playing the game. There are a lot of reasons that might happen, but I&#x27;ll be honest: it&#x27;s never a great sign. I&#x27;m usually pretty chillaxed about the occasional wonky animation or frame stuttering when a game runs, but in this case The Callisto Protocol runs so badly on PC that if it were my child and the coach wasn&#x27;t putting it in to play football - even as a sub in the last five minutes, you know, just to give it a go, like - I&#x27;d be saying, &quot;Yeah, bench the sucker, I get it.&quot;
The stuttering and slowing down whenever anything moves is especially problematic in a horror game where your survival depends on quickly dodge-reacting to sudden threats. So I can&#x27;t, right now, recommend you get The Callisto Protocol on PC. If Striking Distance get it running properly? Eh. Maybe.

                              <span>Update: Nintendo offers an explanation.
Update : We heard earlier this week that the unofficial Smash Bros. championships and upcoming tour would be cancelled with immediate effect after receiving a cease and desist notice from Nintendo.
This was expected to cost the tournament a huge amount of money in cancellation fees and seemed to be something of a U-turn for the brand which had previously operated under good terms with Nintendo&#x27;s licenses.

Fire Emblem Engage is set to come to Switch on 23rd January, 2023, bringing the series to the new world of Elyos. As we have come to expect from the franchise, Engage will introduce us to a new team of heroes but, as confirmed by Nintendo, there are also set to be cameos from few recognisable faces of entries past.
Summoned via magical rings, these legacy heroes — &#x27;Emblems&#x27; — will be able to be called upon in battle to bolster your strength or to use their abilities alongside your own.

We saw the cover of this season&#x27;s Nintendo Magazine a few weeks back now - a gorgeous 3D render of a Splatoon 3 Inkling and Smallfry - but with the content only available in Japanese, we had to be content with just looking at the pictures. Fortunately, a digital copy of the mag is now available in English, featuring many excerpts from the Japanese original.
Amongst all of this Nintendo-y goodness is an interview with Deep Cut, an introduction to the Paldea region from Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, tips and tricks for Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope and much more.

If you enjoy lifestyle sims like Animal Crossing: New Horizons and are looking for something else to play, now is a great time to revisit Team17&#x27;s Hokko Life. A new post on the publisher&#x27;s official website reveals the Nintendo Switch version of the game has just been updated.
Hokko Life made its debut on Nintendo&#x27;s hybrid system back in September, and has now been updated with some performance fixes (such as improving FPS drops) and resolved some pesky bugs. As part of this update, the team has also &quot;laid the ground work&quot; for the next game update, which will apparently be coming soon.

Before Monster Hunter Rise was even released on Nintendo Switch, it was revealed the new game would be getting a PC release roughly a year later. The base game was then followed up by the Sunbreak expansion earlier this year in June.
Now, in another update, Capcom&#x27;s long-running series is no longer a Nintendo Switch Switch console exclusive. Capcom has announced Rise will be coming to the PlayStation (PS4, PS5), Xbox (Series X|S, Windows), and Game Pass on 20th January 2023. The Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak expansion will then follow in Spring 2023 on these same platforms.

Following Nintendo&#x27;s apology yesterday about the tech issues and bugs in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, the new entries have now been updated to Version 1.1.0. In the official patch notes it was mentioned how &quot;select bugs&quot; would be fixed, and now that this update has been released, there are already early reports of some performance improvements.
The folks at GameXplain have investigated this new patch and are also claiming it&#x27;s made a &quot;huge difference&quot; to the overall experience. In the video below, they&#x27;ve gone back and inspected areas where they experienced performance problems in the game and are now apparently getting a much smoother frame rate. Keep in mind, this is just one test of the new update.

                              <span>The U.S. Government&#x27;s crackdown against Z-Library continues to make waves online.

                              <span>Monster Hunter Rise is embarking on a new hunt on PlayStation and Xbox consoles in January. Its recent expansion, Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak, will follow suit sometime next Spring. 
The latest entry in the uber-popular series comes to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on January 20. It will also be available on Xbox Game Pass for console, PC, and cloud at launch. The current-gen versions specifically boast 4K resolution, 60 FPS gameplay, and 3D audio, among other customizable options. However, a disclaimer on a new trailer states that 3D Audio will come to the Xbox One version in a Spring update. The PS5 port also supports DualSense haptic feedback for ranged and shielded weapons. The game is priced at $39.99 across all platforms. 


Monster Hunter Rise first launched in March 2021 for Switch before migrating to PC in January of this year. Sunbreak made its way to both platforms this past June. In addition to this news, Capcom reveals that Rise has sold over 11 million units since its launch.

                              <span>Neon White is finally making its way to PlayStation consoles, roughly six months after the game&#x27;s initial release on Switch and PC. 
Publisher Annapurna Interactive and developer Angel Matrix announced this news today, revealing that Neon White hits PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 on December 13. This fast-paced, speedrunning FPS is well worth your time if you haven&#x27;t played it yet and you can find out why in Game Informer&#x27;s Neon White review. 


&quot;Neon White is a lightning fast single-player speedrunning FPS where players sacrifice their guns for godlike parkour moves,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;Assume the role of White, an assassin handpicked from Hell, and compete with other demon slayers for a shot at redemption and a chance to live permanently in Heaven. The game utilizes a unique card-based weapon system, bite sized hand-designed levels, and a breakneck soundtrack by Machine Girl to turn players into speedrunning freaks. 
&quot;As players unravel Heaven&#x27;s mysteries, they will discover the other demon slayers are more familiar than they first appear, and through the visual novel inspired story, they learn it&#x27;s never too late to seek forgiveness.&quot; 
Check out this new trailer released today for the game&#x27;s upcoming PlayStation debut:

                              <span>Ubisoft and Bungie have revealed that crossover cosmetics are coming to both Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla and Destiny 2. 
The items will drop into both respective games next week on December 6 and it&#x27;s then that you&#x27;ll be able to purchase these themed cosmetics from the Assassin&#x27;s Creed in-game store and the Eververse store in Destiny 2. As for what to expect, the image below includes some looks: 
However, that doesn&#x27;t seem to feature all of the cosmetics we can expect to see. If you don&#x27;t feel like waiting until next week to see what makes its way to Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla, you can check out MAK Moderator&#x27;s video (as spotted by Forbes) on YouTube below: 


What&#x27;s interesting is that MAK Moderator&#x27;s video also features some Monster Hunter-themed cosmetics, meaning there&#x27;s likely a collaboration with that series set to be announced soon as well. 
&quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla players can purchase a Destiny 2-themed character pack, which includes armor sets, swords, a scout skin, and a mount skin,&quot; Ubisoft&#x27;s announcement reads. &quot;Players can also grab a weapons pack which includes four unique spins on Destiny&#x27;s iconic subclasses, each with their own gameplay perks and custom effects. As Destiny 2 begins its next season on December 6, players will be able to visit the Eververse store to get their hands on an Assassin&#x27;s Creed-themed ship, Sparrow, Ghost, and finisher cosmetics, as well as three armor ornament sets.&quot;

                              <span>Pokemon Scarlet and Pokemon Violet hit Switch just a few weeks ago on November 18 and while the game excels at a lot, it struggles on the technical side. Various glitches, bugs, and frame rate drops are present throughout a lot of the game, something we noted in our review, and fans have been vocal about their dissatisfaction with this aspect of their Paldean journeys. It seems Nintendo is taking these frustrations to heart in a rare admission in the latest update for the game. 
The company tweeted last night that a new software update of Scarlet and Violet was going live today alongside the following: &quot;We take the feedback from players seriously, and will continue to work on improvements to the games.&quot; 


Nintendo further addresses these issues in the actual patch notes for the update too…</span>

                              <span>Ryu Ga Gotoku Studios has released a new trailer for Like A Dragon: Ishin and it features a look at the various combat styles and weaponry we&#x27;ll be using in the game. 
For the uninitiated, Ishin is a from-the-ground-up remake of a Yakuza spinoff released on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 3 back in 2014. However, this spinoff never made its way to the West so when Ishin hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC in February, it will be the first time a lot of players will be able to play this game. To get prepared, RGG Studios has released a brand new trailer detailing some of the combat and associated mechanics present in the game. 
Check out the Like A Dragon: Ishin combat trailer for yourself below: 


&quot;In 1860s Kyo, a solemn samurai&#x27;s fight for justice stands to change the course of Japan&#x27;s history forever,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;Draw your blade and join the revolution in this heated historical adventure.&quot; 
Players who preorder the Digital Deluxe Edition of Like A Dragon: Ishin will receive early access to the game starting February 17 (the standard release date is February 21) and the following in-game items: 
Shinsengumi Captain&#x27;s Set
Room Growth Support Kit
Sword Upgrade Materials Kit
Gun Upgrade Materials Kit
Third Division Armament Expansion Kit
The Dragon of Dogma Skin
An additional three weapons: 
	
Kijinmaru Kunishige, a dark sword with a white hilt
Bloody Sheen, a sword soaked in blood
Black Ship Cannon, a cannon taken from Western Ships

                              <span>Capcom has announced that the second closed beta test for Street Fighter 6 will begin later this month and you can register for a chance to check the game out during it right now. 
This second beta will officially begin on December 16 and run through December 19 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC via Steam, and it will feature cross-play across all three platforms. As for what&#x27;s available, Capcom lists ranked matches, casual matches, battle hub matches, open tournaments, extreme battle, the game center, and Street Fighter 6&#x27;s training mode. 


If you&#x27;d like to sign up to potentially participate in this second closed beta, you can do so here. It&#x27;s important to note, though, that completing Capcom&#x27;s application process does not guarantee you selection for the beta. Selection is handled via a lottery system, according to Capcom, and not a first-come, first-served basis. You&#x27;ll need to have a registered Capcom ID to even apply and it must be linked to your platform account so be sure to do that first thing. Other than that, good luck getting in! The response to the first closed beta for Street Fighter 6 a few weeks ago was quite positive so it sounds like this second beta is going to be a great time as well.

                              <span>Let&#x27;s get groovy, Nintendo style
If you love live gaming music, then you&#x27;re in for a treat -- Nintendo has posted a VOD of their Animal Crossing x Splatoon live concert performance from the recent Nintendo Live 2022 event to YouTube for our viewing pleasure. The event actually took place at the Tokyo Big Site in Odaiba back at the start of October, and featured tournaments for games like Nintendo Switch Sports and Super Smash Bros., as well as a stage performance from comedy duo Yoiko.
Arguably the main event, however, was the Nintendo Live concert, which of course featured the soundtracks of two of its biggest franchises to date. The show started off with a video of Animal Crossing&#x27;s Isabella welcoming everyone, and introducing DJ KK -- who then appeared on a screen with some other friends from the game. How adorable! KK&#x27;s set goes on for a good half hour before we get to see some friendly faces from the Splatoon games: Deep Cut.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;7ETszC6w-mg
This is where the show really kicks off in my opinion, because we get a whole live band including two percussionists, a keyboard player, a guitarist, and a bassist, as well as some other musicians who come out and join in the middle of the performance as well. They have amazing energy, and it looks like they&#x27;re having a ton of fun!
The Squid Sisters also make an appearance to join up with Deep Cut for the finale, which makes for a pretty epic conclusion to the whole thing. The stage set up looked amazing as well with all of the lights and LED screens, and the crowd looked like they were having a blast as well as they grooved along with their light sticks.
As someone who loves both live music shows and video game music, this Nintendo Live concert is definitely one I wish I could have seen in person. At least now we can watch and rewatch it in perpetuity, right?

                              <span>Could a Generation 5 Remake do justice to Black and White?
The dust has barely settled on the fun but rough Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet. However, there have never been more questions about the future of the franchise. Because right now, we’re looking at a potential Generation 5 Remake.
The mainline Pokemon series has alternated between new entries and remakes of old games since 2013, so it’s easy to see why Pokémon Black &amp; White could return as early as next year. In fact, Unova is specifically referenced in Scarlet &amp; Violet, which further fans the flames of speculation. On one hand, the timing couldn’t be better. While Black &amp; White were divisive in 2010, fans have since warmed to these titles. Many say this is the franchise’s best generation ever, including myself.
On the other hand, Black …</span>

                              <span>The DualSense controller will bring a whole new feel
The &quot;lightning fast&quot; first person shooter/puzzle platformer Neon White was one of this year&#x27;s best indie hits. It had some of the freshest gameplay ideas we&#x27;ve seen in a while, plus, who doesn&#x27;t love a game that pushes you to challenge yourself to beat a level as fast as you can? I could see Neon White being a gateway to the speedrunning community, for sure. The game was able to snag three different nominations from the Game Awards, including Best Indie, Best Action, and Best Debut Indie.
Now, PlayStation has announced that they&#x27;re bringing Neon White to PS4 and PS5 consoles on December 13, so a whole new group of players who have yet to check it out are going to have the chance. According to a PlayStation blog by Angel Matrix&#x27;s Game Director Ben Esposito detailing the port, Neon White will run at 120hz on PlayStation 5 across the board, because &quot;high framerate matters&quot; when a game is so focused on speed.
https://twitter.com/PlayNeonWhite/status/1598361286680535042
The port will also &quot;make use of PS5&#x27;s adaptive triggers to make each Soul Card feel unique when you fire them as well as when you discard.&quot; Another DualSense feature you can use to your advantage is the controller&#x27;s Gyroscope, which you can use to help aim with more precision. Esposito says &quot;gyroscope aiming can take some getting used to, but it’s well worth it for an extra degree of fine-grained control when sniping demons from the start of a level.&quot;
If my Breath of the Wild playthroughs have taught me anything, it&#x27;s that motion controls aren&#x27;t really my thing. Either way, Neon White is a game I&#x27;ve been itching to play since it came out, and now that it&#x27;s on my favorite console, it looks like it&#x27;s finally time for me to give this heavenly speedrunner a shot.

                              <span>Amnesia gets a gun
The next Amnesia from Frictional Games has been announced, and it&#x27;s descending into a twisted manmade horror. Amnesia: The Bunker is a new entry in the horror series, arriving on PC and consoles in March 2023.
Frictional showed off a short clip of the new Amnesia today, spotlighting what terror may lurk in its darkest corners. Amnesia: The Bunker is set in a decrepit World War I-era bunker, where something has quite plainly gone wrong.
There are horrors that lurk out of sight, and for that, you will have a gun in Amnesia: The Bunker. The problem is, it looks like Frictional&#x27;s only giving you one bullet.

The mechanical nature of the light and pocketwatch are already two major draws. As someone who loved the tactile feel of tools in games like the Metro series, that&#x27;s right up my alley.
And a gun might have felt like a strange addition to Amnesia, which is usually more in the run-and-hide realm of horror compared to something like Resident Evil. Yet as we can see in the trailer, and in the description, that gun starts with one bullet. Genius.

A more active Amnesia
Sadly, it does seem like you can craft more weapons and tools to deal with the nightmares of the bunker. (Yes, I was hoping that you&#x27;d only have one bullet, for the whole game.)
Amnesia: The Bunker takes place in a semi-open world, according to Frictional, where you&#x27;ll need to explore and test things out to find a way out. There&#x27;s also a dynamic and &quot;ever-present&quot; monster that responds to your actions.
Overall, it feels like Frictional tackling the Alien: Isolation brand of horror, and I&#x27;m interested in that. Frictional Games has been putting together horror games for some time, and while combat isn&#x27;t usually at the forefront of their games, I&#x27;m interested to see what they do with it.
Amnesia: The Bunker arrives in March 2023 for PC and consoles. You can wishlist it on Steam over here.

Gameloft has announced that its cartoonish karter Disney Speedstorm will no longer meet its initially planned 2022 release date — The free-to-play racer has been pushed back to 2023, when it will launch on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.
&quot;We have been working diligently to craft an amazing racing experience for Disney Speedstorm, capturing our vision of the exciting magic fans enjoy in their favorite Disney and Pixar characters and games,&quot; said Gameloft in a statement posted to Twitter. &quot;We want fans to not only be entertained, but to enjoy a fast-paced and competitive racing experience they will return to play for years to come.&quot;
&quot;With this in mind and after careful consideration, we have decided to delay the worldwide release of Disney Speedstorm to meet our expectations and provide players with a more immersive racing experience, customization offerings, game modes, and more. Fans are invited to join us on the speedway when Disney Speedstorm launches in 2023 on PC and consoles.&quot;
First revealed in February of this year, Disney Speedstorm is a curious-looking title that will adapt The House of Mouse&#x27;s huge litany of characters and worlds to the racetrack in rubber-burnin&#x27;, power-slidin&#x27; action. Players will select characters and vehicles based on series such as Monsters Inc, Pirates of the Caribbean, Mulan, Beauty and the Beast, and other famous franchises before tearing up themed tracks in online and offline play. Given the enormity of the Disney catalog, Gameloft is liking hoping for a long-life title, with new karts, tracks, and racers added over the ensuing seasons.
Disney Speedstorm is currently in development for PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.

Sony Pictures&#x27; cinematic adaptation of Naughty Dog&#x27;s adventure series Uncharted is to be further adapted into a new theme park ride: a roller coaster to be situated in Spanish park PortAventura World.
As reported by Variety, the new Uncharted coaster is described as a &quot;multi-dimensional&quot; dark ride, (that&#x27;s an indoor coaster for all of you not adept in the art of roller coasting). Riders will be treated to a pre-show as they stand in line, before hurtling off into &quot;unexplored territories&quot; on a quest for unexplored treasure. The ride itself will feature 700 meters of track and will feature five launches with up to 1G of acceleration.

The December Xbox Game Pass lineup this year is closing out with some pretty notable additions. Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga is the headliner, but several other big December games are on the way too.
With Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga, the Lego series got a bit of a tune-up. It&#x27;s apparently a bit more action-oriented, and yes, even allows for some sick air juggling.
If you&#x27;re looking for something a little more adult-oriented, the raucous High On Life arrives on Game Pass this month too. All your guns will talk, and talk a fair bit if the trailers so far are any indication. That&#x27;s on December 13.

There&#x27;s been much chatter on the information superhighway since the premiere of the second trailer for Illumination&#x27;s upcoming film The Super Mario Bros. Movie — While the preview offered up lots of fun &amp; recognizable action from the Mushroom Kingdom, an alternate teaser reveals just that little bit more.
The second 30-second trailer sees our mustachioed hero as he is shown around the colorful world by fan-favorite fungi, Toad. In the brief clip, we get to see the kingdom&#x27;s denizens going about their daily routine, gathering coins from Question Blocks, (which I guess is sort of an ATM in the kingdom), and traveling in style, via the Mario Bros. universe&#x27;s famous network of warp pipes.

The original clips are being swallowed up by the mighty suits of NBC Universal, but you can check out the alternate preview in the above tweet, courtesy of Twittererer @somekirbyfan. Of course, trailers leave absolutely zero to the imagination these days, so maybe you have already had your fill of previews and wish to simply wait for the film&#x27;s premiere. Good on you. Whilst I&#x27;m really not a fan of Illumination&#x27;s cookie-cutter, rubber-faced shenanigans, I must admit that the world and characters look absolutely delightful in the trailers so far, and I&#x27;m definitely looking forward to seeing all of these wonderful characters brought to life. We just need to see Wendy O. and Chain Chomp and I&#x27;m good.
The Super Mario Bros. Movie is scheduled to launch in Europe on March 30, North America on April 7, and Japan on April 28, 2023.

Welcome to another quiet week, in the wake of the massive phenomenon that is Pokemon. After Scarlet &amp; Violet sold 10 million collectively in just three days, there isn&#x27;t really a lot of love to spread around when it comes to the eShop.
There are a few things cycling in, though. Romancing SaGa -Minstrel Song- Remastered is out, as is the Switch port of Inscryption. It&#x27;s an odd pair, but a recent indie and a blast from the past definitely had me thinking about how much genre diversity there is on the Switch eShop at this point. So many developers are porting games to it!

                              <span>Harvest McDoom
While &quot;cozy&quot; games are all the rage on the indie scene these days, perhaps one of the gold standards for relaxing, casual-grind-based gameplay is Natsume&#x27;s iconic farming series, Harvest Moon — And the franchise seems to have had something of a strange effect on YouTuber Cloudie McDoom, who woke up yesterday morning to find themselves occupying a live-action recreation of the beloved franchise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;w8pCxPlryaI
Whilst I won&#x27;t spoil the work that has gone into this short, but authentic take on Harvest Moon&#x27;s hard-working world, Cloudie&#x27;s video raises more than a few smiles thanks to its U.I implementation, use of flailing limbs and stop-start photography to truly capture gaming&#x27;s classic &quot;zero-turning-circle&quot; animation style. The sounds, music, and fade-outs only complete the effect.
There are no squawking chickens, fox attacks, or trips to the market, unfortunately, but I dig the real-life recreation of Harvest Moon&#x27;s &quot;square-by-square&quot; gardening techniques. And if you enjoyed the Harvest Moon video, be sure to check out Cloudie McDoom&#x27;s channel over on YouTube for more parodies and recreations of classic video games.
The latest Harvest Moon title, Harvest Moon: One World, is available now on Nintendo Switch.

                              <span>If you miss it, you&#x27;ll have another chance in a few weeks
As promised nearly a month ago, Game Freak is opening up the Charizard Tera Raid event in Pokemon Scarlet and Violet later today: at 4PM PT, to be exact. The event will be live through Sunday, December 4, at 3:59PM PT, so you basically have a weekend and change to get it done.
Note that you will need to do some legwork to actually partake. As Nintendo puts it: &quot;You’ll be able to take on Tera Raid Battles at black crystals after completing certain postgame events. However, players who haven’t completed these events may still participate in these Tera Raid Battles by joining another Trainer’s Tera Raid Battle, whether they’re in a multiplayer group or using a Link Code.&quot;
Here&#x27;s a full guide on how to actually start that process. There&#x27;s another proviso too: you can only catch one of these Charizards per save file.
If you&#x27;re not free this weekend, you&#x27;ll get another shot! The event will also run from December 15 through December 18.

Here are the exact times for the Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet Charizard Tera Raid:
Thursday, December 1, 2022, at 4:00 p.m. – Sunday, December 4, 2022, at 3:59 p.m. PST
Thursday, December 15, 2022, at 4:00 p.m. – Sunday, December 18, 2022, at 3:59 p.m. PST

                              <span>All hands on Deck
Valve has announced that, during next week&#x27;s The Game Awards festivities, it is planning to give away one Steam Deck for every minute of the annual award ceremony. I am resisting the urge to make a &quot;so that&#x27;ll be 7000 Steam Decks&quot; joke. Please bear with me during this difficult time.
The rules are simple, yet frightening. Anybody can sign up for the giveaway, providing that they live within the UK, Europe, Canada, or the United States. All entrants must have made a Steam purchase between November 14, 2021 and November 14, 2022 in order to officially confirm their home country. Additionally, your Steam account must be in good standing, and not be limited for bad behavior or any other penalizations.
Then on December 8, be sure to tune into The Game Awards via the Steam app. All qualifying participants, who are currently watching the ceremony via Steam will be placed into a lottery. Names will be drawn at random on a minute-to-minute basis, with each winner bagging themselves a 512GB Steam Deck. Full terms, conditions, and rules are available over on the official Steam website.
If you were planning on watching the show anyway, then this might be a fine way to potentially bag yourself a reward for doing so. We can assume that a helluva lot of people will enter the sweepstakes, and given that The Game Awards 2021 was watched by some six million viewers on Twitch and YouTube alone, there&#x27;s gonna be more than a few names in the hat. Still, worth a shot, right? Besides, every participant will automatically bag themselves this super cute digital sticker.
The Game Awards 2022 takes place Thursday, December 8, at 16:30 PT / 19:30 ET / 00:30 BST.

                              <span>Nintendo taking player feedback &#x27;seriously&#x27;
Today sees the launch of the first major update for Nintendo&#x27;s Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet, but while Update 110 will add some new features to the juggernaut-selling Switch releases, those plucky trainers hoping for a hefty run of performance improvements are, sadly, going to be left wanting.
The core element of Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet Update 1.10 is the addition of Ranked Battles, which will allow players to fight for glory within the confines of the Battle Stadium of Paldea. This new, seasonal-based mode kicks off today with Series 1, allowing trainers to chase the rank of Pokemon Master through showdowns with their fellow players — using the cache of critters they have tucked away within their respective Pokedex. In addition, special events and tournaments will be held on a regular basis as the season progresses.
However, in regards to improving Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet&#x27;s heavily publicized technical issues, Update 1.10 only promises a handful of undisclosed &quot;bug fixes&quot;. In an additional statement published alongside the official patch notes, Nintendo said that it was aware of the performance issues that are being suffered by the millions of players who picked up one (or both) of the games during launch week, and that it is working on improvements to the games — noting that it was taking player feedback &quot;seriously&quot;.
Released on November 18 exclusively on Nintendo Switch, Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet sold over 10 million copies within the first three days of release, making it Nintendo&#x27;s biggest launch of all time.

Capcom has announced that it will be holding a second closed beta later this month for the highly anticipated release Street Fighter 6 — Once again, the invite-only test run will be open to PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X players, and will take place from December 16 until December 19.
Interested parties should sign up at the official beta application website. Capcom has decreed that, due to the unlicensed selling of codes from October&#x27;s beta, all participants MUST have their platform and Capcom ID linked in order to receive direct access to the test beta. The chosen participants will be picked by random lottery, not on a first-come, first-served basis.
All players who took part in the initial beta automatically qualify for the second, there is no need to reapply.

                              <span>And that&#x27;s no claptrap
Today is a day, and that means its time for a ratings board to reveal the existence of an unannounced game/port — On this occasion, its the turn of 2K Games&#x27; Borderlands 3, which is apparently getting a Nintendo Switch port, as leaked by the Pan European Game Information (PEGI) committee.
The new port, as spotted by Gematsu, was listed on PEGI&#x27;s website yesterday, appearing alongside its PC and console brethren and with a suggested release date of *checks notes* today! The listing includes the main game, first released in 2020, as well as a huge litany of DLC expansions, including Bounty of Blood, Moxxi&#x27;s Heist of the Handsome Jackpot, Guns, Love, and Tentacles, and both the Designer and Director&#x27;s Cut.

Though publisher 2K Games and developer Gearbox Software are yet to announce a Switch port of the nihilistic open-world shooter, the new PEGI rating all but suggests that the hybrid platform is about to get 3000% more explosive in the very near future. We&#x27;ll be sure to give y&#x27;all a heads up when Mad Moxxi, Claptrap, Psycho Krieg, and the rest of Borderlands&#x27; motley crew of gun-toting, bomb-tossing maniacs are heading to chez Nintendo.
Borderlands 3 is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

The January 2023 release date of HBO&#x27;s highly anticipated The Last of Us series is quickly approaching, which means we&#x27;re getting more glimpses of the show ahead of its debut than ever before. The most recent unveiling was a series of posters featuring the series&#x27; most prominent side characters, which HBO posted as a thread to the official HBO Last of Us Twitter account. There are five in total, featuring Bill (Nick Offerman), Frank (Murray Bartlett), Sarah (Nico Parker), Riley (Storm Reid), and Henry (Lamar Johnson).

This is a great pickup for PC gaming, especially if you like platformers, racing games, action titles and the like, of which there are plenty on PC.

                              <span>Today&#x27;s Google Doodle - the daily, sometimes-interactive twist on the search engine&#x27;s logo - offers up a handful of arcade mini-games to play with in your browser. They&#x27;re simple novelties, but there&#x27;s also an edit button on each one that allows you to tinker with them so you can plop down your own walls, enemies, switches and keys. The Doodle has been built to celebrate Jerry Lawson, a Black video game pioneer and the engineer who led the team that designed the first home video game console to use cartridges.

                              <span>The Amnesia series is returning in 2023 with another instalment in the long-running indie horror series, plonking us down in the already horrendous environments of World War I. With Amnesia: The Bunker, devs Frictional Games are also dialling down the scripted sequences in favour of a semi-open world survival sandbox. Steady your grip on your revolver and step into the dark to watch the trailer below.

                              <span>For the last six months, I&#x27;ve been slowly picking my way through Company Of Heroes 2 for the first time. I&#x27;m about halfway through its campaign at the moment, but the rhythm of calling up replacements and reinforcing my squads hasn&#x27;t quite been engrained into my hotkey fingers yet. I keep making the mistake of thinking I can just push through with my remaining forces, but as any COH stalwart will know, that kind of road only ever leads to total disaster. 
Imagine my surprise, then, when I came to preview the latest build of Company Of Heroes 3&#x27;s dynamic, Total War-style Italian campaign and seemed to be, you know, actually making some pretty steady progress as I pushed up its mission maps. I was, admittedly, only playing the opening levels of this particular campaign, and I also had the aid of a handy M4A1 Sherman tank providing some welcome backup muscle. But during my four hours with it, I felt more in control of the battlefield than I&#x27;ve ever done while playing COH2. I was making excellent use of its reinforcement options, and heck, I was even remembering to tell units to retreat back to the nearest aid post so I didn’t lose the buffs they&#x27;d earned through their new EXP-driven promotions and veterancy bonuses. Then I played a mission from its more linear North African campaign, and had a very rude awakening indeed. Why, hello, frantic pressure and torrents of death bullets from Company Of Heroes 2 again, it&#x27;s been a while.

                              <span>We&#x27;ve all worn the rose-coloured glasses when it comes to old games. It&#x27;s a real hazard of the job when you started out covering stuff from the 90s. It&#x27;s less common though, to fall afoul of whatever its opposite is. The uh, yellow-tinted glasses, maybe? My point is that I did you all a disservice when I described Emperor Of The Fading Suns as &quot;an intriguing, ambitious, crap mega 4X&quot; last year. It was a remarkable game, and more remarkably still, its developers Holistic Design Inc. recently updated it with a major patch, 25 years after its original release.

It&#x27;s a lot better than I remember. And only some of that is down to the patch.

Our boy dishes out the heat in the gnarliest of ways, but it all culminates with the &quot;Wild Dancer&quot; fighting style which turns Kiryu into a spinning top of death. Sign me up.

None of them are exactly what you would call a Christmas-y game. In fact, they&#x27;re all pretty bleak and threatening in tone. But they&#x27;re also amazingly comforting.
Just imagine: sitting down in your favourite chair, electric heat pad on your back, cat on your lap, mug of hot chocolate or coffee by your side. Legions of undead roiling at the gates, trying to break through your cosy little town&#x27;s defences. Ahhhhh. It&#x27;s Christmas.

After playing a chunky new preview build last week, it&#x27;s clear there&#x27;ll be lots to dive into come release day on February 23rd. But when I sat down with vice president of production David Littman to talk more about their WW2 RTS, I was curious where their focus would lie after launch. While many love Company Of Heroes for its top notch campaigns, Littman told me they &quot;still have over 400,000 players still playing COH 1 and 2 monthly&quot; via multiplayer, which is impressive considering the last game in the series came out nine years ago. And when it comes to COH 3, Littman says they&#x27;ll go &quot;where the players are&quot;.

                              <span>I knew the hulking Ogryn would be my class in Warhammer 40,000: Darktide as soon as I shot his starting gun: a shotgun which holds a single shell the size of a can of beans. Sounds excessive, but that&#x27;s the kind of firepower you need when four outcasts face thousands of cultists, mutants, and demons. The follow-up to Vermintide is once again a Left 4 Dead-style cooperative first-person shooter with a fair whack of melee and, having played a lot of the beta and a little after launch, it&#x27;s a joyously grubby brawl with a great cast of weirdos.

I can hear the clanking of metal boots in the distance, accompanied by laser fire and the gurgle of orc laughter rubbed raw by some nasty disease. Dare we enter and embrace the chaos lying within?

                              <span>Ray tracing has been temporarily disabled in newly released co-op accent simulator Warhammer 40,000: Darktide due to issues with AMD and Intel graphics cards. Devs Fatshark say they’re looking into what’s causing the problems. Anecdotal reports from the Darktide subreddit seem to suggest that ray tracing was staying on for people who’d set the fancy lighting technique to off. For now, Fatshark say they&#x27;ve turned off ray tracing by default for all players until they can figure out what’s going on and implement a fix.

                              <span>The hills are alive with the sound of objections.
Did you know there&#x27;s an unofficial Ace Attorney musical out there? We can&#x27;t believe we&#x27;re only just learning about it, because it&#x27;s been around since 2007. 2007!!!
However, it turns out that it might be the perfect time to find out about Turnabout: An Ace Attorney Musical, because the 90-minute first act of the musical was uploaded to YouTube on the project&#x27;s 15th anniversary — the 25th November, 2022.

                              <span>Vanillish.
After launching on Steam in 2017, O.T.K Games’ The Vagrant has finally released on consoles with the new alias Sword of the Vagrant. The game is heavily inspired by the games of Vanillaware; renowned developers of games like Muramasa: The Demon Blade and Dragon’s Crown. This inspiration can be seen straight away with the wonderful hand-drawn art style, and even down to the smaller elements like the animation and the uhh… let’s call it “sometimes gratuitous” character designs.
A 2D hack-and-slash adventure with some light Metroidvania-style exploration elements, Sword of the Vagrant places you in the shoes of Vivian; a young sellsword sailing toward the island of Mythrilla in search of her missing father. After being faced with a mysterious owl guy, her ship conveniently wrecks on the beaches of Mythrilla. After assisting a young local woman, Vivian returns with her to a village in ruin and is soon cursed by an evil witch who demands that she retrieve magic artefacts, or else she will destroy Vivian instantly. To ensure our hero does not try and escape, the witch sends her disciple Camden along for the journey to keep watch.

There is very little that we officially know about the Super Nintendo World coming soon to Universal Studios Hollywood apart from that 1) it is really happening, and 2) it will have a Mario Kart ride. But more information concerning the build may have just leaked online (thanks, WDW).
Reportedly found in an upcoming update for the theme park&#x27;s official app, @CygnusParkYT appears to have found a design for the Super Nintendo World map, showing off both Peach&#x27;s and Bowser&#x27;s castles, an ice area, and the potential entrance to the aforementioned ride.

Remember back in the hazy days of this February&#x27;s Nintendo Direct when Disney Speedstorm was announced to be coming to Switch in the Summer? That obviously never came into fruition, and now the developer, Gameloft, has made the decision to delay the game further into next year.
In a statement sent out via the official @SpeedstormGame Twitter account, the team shared the message that the game would not be available for 2022 as planned. According to the post, it appears that Speedstorm is just not currently up to the standards that the developers expect and it will continue to work on the title to provide &quot;a more immersive racing experience, customization offerings, game modes and more&quot;.

Soapbox features enable our individual writers and contributors to voice their opinions on hot topics and random stuff they&#x27;ve been chewing over. Today, on the 5th anniversary of Xenoblade Chronicles 2&#x27;s release, Alana wants to celebrate the influence of its predecessor and series spin-off...

Xenoblade Chronicles X wasn&#x27;t really what anyone was expecting. People were excited for a sequel to Monolith Soft&#x27;s Xenoblade Chronicles on Wii, and X came in and defied most expectations. People wanted Xenoblade Chronicles 2 — instead, they got a sprawling, open-world RPG where the main star of the game is an alien planet called Mira. And the series is all the better for its existence.

                              <span>Another half a million in the bag.
The latest Japanese Charts data is here and it&#x27;s another strong week for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, with the duo achieving another 577,279 sales over the course of the week to put them at a total of 3,114,571. Splatoon 3, meanwhile, added another 39,322 sales to make up a total of 3,407,477. What this means is that Scarlet and Violet are just a couple hundred thousand copies off matching Splatoon 3&#x27;s total sales in just two weeks. Phenomenal!
While this week&#x27;s sales for Scarlet and Violet are significantly less than the previous week (2,537,292), the games are still proving to be incredibly popular and there is currently no indication that the technical issues documented since their release have had any tangible impact on their commercial performance.

                              <span>Or could it be a remake..?
Game Freak, the core developer behind the Pokémon franchise, released a much loved 3DS title back in 2013 called Pocket Card Jockey. Exclusive to Japan for three years, it eventually made its way to other regions in 2016 to positive reception.
Now, it appears there may be a new game on the horizon, as a trademark for ‘ソリティ馬 Ride On!&#x27; (Solitaire Horse: Ride On!) has been filed by Game Freak (thanks for the spot, VGC). It&#x27;s not clear at this stage whether the game is a sequel or a remaster of the original, but either way, count us in!

                              <span>You have to draw the line somewhere.
Railbound, the latest title from Polish studio Afterburner, makers of Golf Peaks and inbento, is a super-cute puzzler of polished presentation and deceptively monstrous difficulty. It starts ever so innocently, asking for a little railway line to connect a carriage to its engine, and sings with toots and chuffs as a billow of smoke from the locomotive clears to reveal the next stage. By the 100th level, however, it becomes a head-scratcher that’ll wear your nails to nubs.
The goal is to couple cars to engines in numbered order. A level starts with one to four cars spaced around a grid and the engine sitting at the edge of the play area. You have a fixed number of track pieces that can go in any direction, turning and branching off each other. You connect the cars to the engine with rails such that car number one will arrive there first, followed by number two and so on. When you press go, the cars rattle along charmingly and you see if your plan worked. It’s so intuitive a concept that we’d played a good 20 levels before we realised that this is absolutely not how trains work.

                              <span>Game developer Bungie is showing patience and determination in its pursuit of cheat creators and distributors. A lawsuit targeting people behind the &#x27;Wallhax&#x27; operation has already produced a $13.5m settlement  and in an amended complaint filed this week, Bungie identifies several people who previously enjoyed relative anonymity. It&#x27;s a chase that now spans three continents.

The company reiterates this stance after rival platforms Hellshare and Hellspy signed piracy filtering agreements with local rightsholders. According to Uloz, these measures will likely result in overblocking, something that should be avoided according to EU law.

I haven&#x27;t played a Need For Speed game since I was 13 and this wasn&#x27;t on my radar at all, but yeah, sure, let&#x27;s drive. It looks just like the games I remember but with optional silly animated wings and dust trails.

                              <span>Romance has never been Bethesda&#x27;s strong suit, from Skyrim&#x27;s barebones marriage system to Fallout 4&#x27;s bonus-XP-granting fade-to-black cutscenes. Starfield will be a little more nuanced than that, suggests executive producer Todd Howard, offering more complex romance options than Fallout&#x27;s.
That&#x27;s just one detail from a nearly 3 hour-long interview Howard gave on the Lex Fridman podcast, where he also talks scrapping space strandings, and (gasp) why he prefers to play on consoles to PC.

Sable hasn&#x27;t quite done that, because yesterday&#x27;s update sends you hover-biking off after enough fish to earn the right to don the new, professional mask of a desert angler.
On your bike, then.

                              <span>Half-Life 2 was the first game I ever played in VR. Back in the primordial days of 2013, I was lucky enough to get my ungainly sausage-mitts on an Oculus Developer&#x27;s Kit – the prototype headset that eventually led to the Oculus Rift. Understandably given the name, there were not games for the developers kit outside of a few incredibly basic demos. But there was Half-Life 2, for which Valve had implemented a hacky VR mode that you could activate with some console tomfoolery.

Asassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla&#x27;s free, final content update has arrived a week early, sending Eivor off to North America for one last hurrah.
There are actually two links to Mirage, because this final chapter features *more* of its protagonist, Basim, who Valhalla persevere-ers will have already met. I bailed after 15 hours and so have very little idea what&#x27;s going on, which is a shame because I&#x27;d love a chinwag with Shohreh Aghdashloo.

Wave hello to Makena, Efe, Noor, Kai, Ari, Sunny, and Zuri. Watch the trailer below to see the new default skins teaming up to build a giant alpaca.

Even the time capsule that&#x27;s Classic WoW probably couldn&#x27;t capture the same buzz of the past, mainly because I, as a being of flesh and bone, am not a teenager anymore. But I&#x27;d argue there&#x27;s one place that still captures the essence of WoW more than WoW itself nowadays: YouTube. Or to be more specific, channels which provide hour-long music and ambience from some of the game&#x27;s most memorable zones.

                              <span>Being interested in both sci-fi and strategy games, I’ve always wanted to reshape the galaxy. The free 3.6 Orion update for Paradox’s spacey grand strategy Stellaris is live now, and it&#x27;s done that, but in a way I hadn’t quite imagined. Among the changes with this update are six new galaxy shapes to mix up the pattern of your interstellar empires a bit. Orion also rebalances fleet combat, bringing in elements of the open beta that began back in October. Paradox have chucked in a few reworks of bits and pieces from Stellaris’ numerous expansions too, including changes to the Utopia DLC’s Ascension path. You can see more about that by watching the video below.

                              <span>Last time, you decided that dakka is better than overwatch (not Overwatch). It wasn&#x27;t the most overwhelming victory of this scientific process so far, but it certainly was the loudest. More dakka indeed. This week, I ask you to pick between a cool form of human movement and some cool human speech. What&#x27;s better: mantling or cool swearing?

Sorry, crypto bros. The ban on crypto and NFTs echoes Mojang’s statement from this summer scuppering players who wanted to incorporate the controversial technologies into Minecraft.

                              <span>For the last ten years, the XCOM designers at Firaxis have traded in &#x27;if&#x27;s and &#x27;maybe&#x27;s. If this shot lands, then maybe I can pull off this carefully calculated plan I’m brewing. It&#x27;s exactly the kind of taut, knife-edge tension we&#x27;ve come to love and expect from their turn-based strategy games, but Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns takes a different approach. As the titular demon hunters join forces with some famous Avengers faces to take down the evil sorceress Lilith and Marvel mega villain Chthon, there&#x27;s never any question about whether your moves will or won&#x27;t work here. You&#x27;re playing as the world&#x27;s most powerful superheroes. Of course, they’re going to work. And forget about cowering behind knee-high cover walls, too, because if you&#x27;re not already bulletproof, you&#x27;ve certainly got the reflexes and supercharged muscle mass to soak up anything Lilith’s Hydra minions are going to chuck at you.

Question is, by tipping the power scales in your favour like this, do you risk destroying that delicate balance of risk and reward? At first glance, it&#x27;s easy to think a more reliable set of heroes would end up dulling what made Firaxis&#x27; XCOM games so special, but the result is something equally thrilling. Given how the Marvel machine has drawn in and chewed up so much singular creative talent in the wider MCUniverse, Firaxis emerging with their cred intact is nothing short of extraordinary. Not only have they endured their radioactive spider bite, they&#x27;ve come out bigger and better for it, creating not only the best Marvel game I&#x27;ve played, but one of the best superhero games full stop.

Its TLC NAND and DRAM cache also mean that performance remains high even in sustained write scenarios, unlike cheaper QLC/no-DRAM drives. 
The Crucial P5 Plus normally costs £100+, but today it&#x27;s down to £92.51 on Amazon UK - one of the best prices we&#x27;ve seen for this model although not quite the best ever.

This season, the game’s taking its inspiration from Greek mythology with a new time-limited mode, Battle For Olympus, giving the heroes some godlike powers early next year. You can take a look at some of what’s lined up for Overwatch 2 Season 2 in the trailer below.

It&#x27;s normally £200, but it&#x27;s down to £167 on AWD-IT which is a pretty decent deal if you want to build a powerful gaming PC on a budget.

The new generation of Pokemon is out in the wild, and avid trainers have been battling and collecting their way across Paldea. Like with all of the mainline Pokemon games, it takes around 20 hours to see the end credits roll on this adventure. So if you&#x27;ve been playing since launch, you&#x27;ve likely already reached the ending of Pokemon Scarlet and Violet.
Our reviews for the new Pokemon games went live yesterday. But seeing as it&#x27;s difficult to talk about something so spoiler-laden in a review, we wanted to specifically talk about the ending. Because the final moments of Pokemon Scarlet and Violet really is something unique, it&#x27;s worth dissecting and discussing.
So, after the jump down, we&#x27;ll go into a spoiler-filled chat about the last 90 minutes or so of the new…</span>

                              <span>DMZ&#x27;s success might be marking the end of an era
Anyone who was within a hundred-mile radius of the video game industry from 2018-2020 was no stranger to battle royale modes. Suddenly titles like Fortnite and PUBG were some of the biggest games in the world, and it seemed like every franchise wanted a piece of the pie. We had Call of Duty enter the mix with Warzone, the character-focused Apex Legends, and we even got a battle royale mode for Tetris. Tetris! 
It feels like we&#x27;re finally growing tired of the mode these days (or at the very least, the release of new battle royale-themed modes have slowed down significantly), and it leaves me wondering, which hot new mode will take over as the trendsetting game type?
After seeing the success of Call of Duty&#x27;s new DMZ mode, well, that&#x27;s where I…</span>

                              <span>Rev up those speculations and rumors
The end of the year is rapidly approaching and so, too, are The Game Awards. The multi-hour awards show is likely set to have a fair few reveals in store. And it looks like Naoki Yoshida of Square Enix will be in attendance at The Game Awards 2022.
The official TGAs account announced today that Naoki Yoshida will be at this year&#x27;s event, with a special presentation in store. No further details were given, but that sure does sound like something being unveiled.
https://twitter.com/thegameawards/status/1597998900471701504
Yoshida has garnered acclaim as one of the key figures behind Final Fantasy XIV. He&#x27;s also the producer of upcoming RPG Final Fantasy XVI. Given The Game Awards account is singling that out, XVI seems like the most likely reason to appear.
Finally, fantasy
We did get a trailer drop for Final Fantasy XVI in October, showing off some of the action and adventure in store for this new entry in Square&#x27;s long-running RPG series. It&#x27;s currently aimed for summer 2023, so a date might not be out of question.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;ih0fVVtmiB4
 
Whatever the case, it does seem like the next Final Fantasy is nearing closer and closer. Little tidbits and signs like ratings seem to indicate Square Enix is setting up the runway. This will be the first new Final Fantasy since 2016&#x27;s brotastic road trip Final Fantasy XV, so there are some expectations and hopes in store that have possibly wavered a bit over the last few months.
Either way, chalk that up for another potential world premiere for The Game Awards 2022. The show airs on December 8, with the livestream kicking off at 4:30 p.m. PT / 7:30 p.m. ET.

I consider the N64 to be my main stomping ground, which is no small claim. Although I recognize the considerable drawbacks of both the hardware and the era in which it was spawned, I love it all the same. I suppose the fact that it’s a contrasting mix of good and bad is really the cause of my attraction. The PS1 is too good. The Saturn is too lacking. But the N64 is like fine art played on a vaseline-smeared screen.
It had some great titles, though. While I’ve picked my top 5, and I’m confident in my picks, I’m leaving out a number of titles that I could gush about. That’s sort of why I don’t like lists like this, I’d rather talk in-depth about the merits and problems of each game in their own context, not compare them. However, if someone is going to do it, I’m d…</span>

Microsoft continues in its dogged efforts to seek approval from European antitrust regulators over its purchase of Activision Blizzard. The deal, which was announced almost a full year ago, would see Microsoft take ownership of the video game publisher for the hefty sum of $68.7 billion USD.
Before the deal can be completed, Microsoft must seek the approval of various global commissions, ensuring that there will be no antitrust issues from the meeting of two of the industry&#x27;s biggest companies. The European Commission is yet to offer its approval for the purchase, going as far as to launch a full investigation into the proposed deal. The commission is charged with declaring its decision before April 11, 2023.

At the center of myriad angles on this whole endeavor lies Activision&#x27;s billion-dollar franchise, Call of Duty. Sony has been unashamedly loud in its concerns that making the military shooter franchise an Xbox exclusive will severely harm the PlayStation market. And while Microsoft had offered up an agreement to keep Call of Duty a cross-platform release for &quot;at least three years&quot;, Sony rejected this offer, with CEO Jim Ryan openly calling it &quot;inadequate on many levels&quot;.
According to world news outlet Reuters, Microsoft might be preparing to make Call of Duty the ace in securing global approval for the Activision purchase. Reuters suggests that MS might offer Sony a 10-year licensing — a good-faith gesture intended to sway antitrust concerns. Regardless, there is still some way to go, as while the purchase has been unconditionally cleared in many territories — including Brazil, Serbia, and Saudi Arabia — The EU Commission and U.S. FTC regulators will take more convincing.

                              <span>There&#x27;s more headed to the Frontiers
Sega has outlined the 2023 content road map ahead for Sonic Frontiers. New playable characters, a photo mode, challenges, and more are all in store for Sonic Frontiers in 2023.
The DLC roadmap was laid out today on the Sonic social accounts. Three big updates are planned for 2023, and they&#x27;re set to be free for all Sonic Frontiers owners. The content and names of said content are subject to change, Sega notes.
Update 1 will consist of a juke box for all those excellent tunes, as well as a photo mode. So yes, you&#x27;ll be able to take some Sonic Selfies. Those two pieces are joined by new challenge modes to tackle, which may include the golden Super Sonic.

In Update 2, it&#x27;s Sonic&#x27;s birthday! Plus, an Open Zone Challenge and new Koco. I am definitely curious to see what a Sonic birthday party looks like.
Then, the heavy hitters arrive in Update 3. Playable characters and new story are both due out in Update 3, and it looks like a doozy. We have a teaser of the Frontiers villain, as well as portraits for Tails, Knuckles, and Amy. The implication seems to be that the Sonic crew will be playable in some way, but we&#x27;ll doubtless learn more in the new year.
Now it&#x27;s a party
How those different characters, who often have pretty distinct playstyles from Sonic, will fit into the world of Sonic Frontiers will be interesting to see if that&#x27;s how it pans out. Knuckles and Amy can definitely handle some combat, and flying around as Tails in a big, open space could be fun.
We&#x27;ll find out more of what&#x27;s in store as we get closer to the launch of these new updates. In the meantime, Sonic Frontiers is still a fairly fresh game, so this might be the sign for holdouts to try it out if they want to check out all the extra content later.

Developed by Retrific and released in the summer of 2020, Colt Canyon is a challenging roguelike shooter which charges the player with picking one of a number of gunslingers before heading out into the wicky-wicky-wild-wild-west on a quest to rescue their captive partner. What follows is some fast-paced and extremely twitchy eight-way shooter action, set against some nostalgic 8-bit pixel visuals.

Everyone plays video games for different reasons. For some, it’s stress relief. For others, it’s community. I can’t pin my own tastes down, but I do know that if a game made me cry, I probably liked it a lot.
To me, video games have unique opportunities to tug at the heart strings. It is wonderful to learn about a world and its characters for 20, 50, or even 100 hours. If done right, a game can use this space to tell evocative stories that wouldn’t work in other media. As I was making this list, I realized that so many games have succeeded this way that I had a hard time pinning down just five. I know I’ll miss several worthy moments that deserve a slot, so I went with my gut and picked the games that genuinely changed my life. Whether I learned a valuable lesson or just needed…</span>

                              <span>Not quite extinct
Songs, drama, and fond memories are all flooding back for one indie narrative game. Goodbye Volcano High has resurfaced with a trailer and a launch window.
The dino teen drama got some notice when it took the stage during a PlayStation showcase in 2020. The project&#x27;s been in development since, with the release window shifting in the meantime. Now, Goodbye Volcano High is aiming for a summer 2023 launch.
Alongside the news today is a trailer, showing off some of what&#x27;s in store for the prehistoric school year. While the art direction is an immediate draw for some, today&#x27;s trailer also spotlights gameplay from KO_OP&#x27;s story.

There&#x27;s dialogue options, which will likely have some ramifications down the line for Fang, the lead. Or maybe jamming to music&#x27;s more your style, or taking photos. When the cataclysm is nigh, what should you do with your time?
Meteoric rise
That&#x27;s the crux of Goodbye Volcano High: the world is ending, an era is being put to a close. So what do you do with the time remaining? It&#x27;s a bit heavy, for sure.
But as someone who hadn&#x27;t been sold on the concept just yet, today&#x27;s trailer has honestly won me over a bit. The music is fantastic, and all the style added to dialogue, rhythm, and other segments give Goodbye Volcano High a bit of added flair. I&#x27;ve seen some narrative games do impressive things with how they stylize basic chats and conversations.
If making the most of life&#x27;s little dramas before imminent doom sounds up your alley, Goodbye Volcano High is aiming for a summer 2023 launch.

                              <span>It&#x27;s still officially due out by the end of the year
Valheim, which exploded at launch, is still going strong; and the game is about to host its Mistlands update before 2022 closes out. Thanks to a new blog post we have a better idea of what it&#x27;s going to entail, and it seems like a lot of changes are on the way.
Boasting the typical quality of life features and fixes, we&#x27;re also getting:
Nine new creatures + a boss
20+ crafting materials
15 new food items
More craftable items and furniture
A &quot;new type of dungeon&quot;
New lore stones, dreams, and music
A fishing update is also planned as part of the update, as well as more emotes, hairstyles, and beard styles. There&#x27;s a full spoiler reveal option on the aforementioned blog post at the very bottom: if you want to get into the nitty gritty as an active player. You can also try all this out yourself...now!
Here&#x27;s how to try out the Valheim Mistlands update now
Go to Steam, right-click the game, and hit properties
Under the beta section, enter &quot;yesimadebackups&quot; (without the quotes) and click the option that appears
That&#x27;s it! You can try it out in public test form, and there&#x27;s more official instructions here if you&#x27;re running into issues.
Here&#x27;s another very important note about the upcoming content from a test perspective:
&quot;An important thing to note is that the Mistlands biome will only generate in areas you have not yet discovered. Therefore, if you have explored a lot of your world, you might be better off starting a new one in order to actually be able to travel to the Mistlands. As per usual, mods will also most likely cause the game not to launch, as they are only compatible with the Live version of the game. If you have mods, you will either need to remove them or wait for the mod to be updated before you can play.&quot;

Harvestella wants to be a jack of two trades, but winds up a master of none. Part action-RPG, part farming/life simulation, this combination can sometimes be enjoyable, but the two styles clash more often than not. The result is a sluggish grind more likely to repel fans of each genre than bring them together.
As an amnesiac warrior, you awaken on the outskirts of a quaint village, unaware of your origin and purpose. Four powerful, monolithic crystals called Seaslight govern the environmental stability of the picturesque continent, namely its seasons. However, a …</span>

But an exact release date is still unknown. However, in recent weeks, speculation about a release date reveal has begun to ramp up, with many predicting a FFXVI appearance at The Game Awards next month. 
Today, the official TGA Twitter account added fuel to that fire by revealing that FFXVI producer Naoki Yoshida, who we interviewed about the game earlier this summer, will be a presenter at the show this year. Plus, he&#x27;s being welcomed to give &quot;a very special live presentation.&quot; What that means remains unknown, but all signs point to something to do with FFXVI. Perhaps he&#x27;ll be playing the game live, or maybe The Game Awards orchestra will do an arrangement from…</span>

The Sonic Frontiers 2023 content shows off a series of future content updates to the game. The three updates will roll out to players of Sonic Frontiers over the course of 2023 at no additional cost. While no timeline is given, it&#x27;s probably safe to assume that Update 2 will hit so…</span>

                              <span>Narrative dinosaur adventure Goodbye Volcano High has awakened from dormancy with a new gameplay trailer and a 2023 release window. The title, unveiled in June 2020 as one of the first PlayStation 5 titles, will now arrive sometime next summer.
Goodbye Volcano High is a choice-driven teenage coming-of-age story starring Fang, a high school student, aspiring musician, and if you didn’t notice, a pterosaur. Alongside their bandmate Trish and other friends, the dino teens are faced with making the most of their final days together. Developer KO-OP describes the narrative as a tale of “personal growth, acceptance, and the power of community.” A new teaser trailer provides the first look at gameplay, showing off the dialogue interface and rhythm mechanics. 


KO-OP initially planned to release Goodbye Volcano High in 2021. However, last August, the small team pushed the launch into 2022 due to COVID-related development challenges and the decision to reboot the game’s narrative. The game still didn’t make a peep throughout 2022, and KO-OP says this latest delay stems from continued challenges related to the pandemic and the game’s large scope relative to the team’s size. For example, KO-OP states that over 6,000 voice lines have been recorded on top of completing a significant amount of “bespoke” animations. 
Goodbye Volcano High is slated to launch on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and PC via Steam.</span>

                              <span>The 28-in Gigabyte M28U is one of the most affordable 4K 144Hz HDMI 2.1 monitors, ideal for use with PC, PS5 and Series X alike. Normally it is available for high but understandable-for-its-specs figure of £669, but for Black Friday (and its aftershocks), it&#x27;s been reduced to £399 which is a rather fetching price.

                              <span>Far Cry continues to take a liberal approach to its expansions with Lost Between Worlds. The DLC for Far Cry 6 takes Dani Rojas, the protagonist from the base game&#x27;s daft revolutionary narrative, and traps her within a kaleidoscopic and extraterrestrial version of Yara. There you&#x27;ll need to work with an alien AI to collect crystals and defeat crystal people. It&#x27;s out on December 6th and you&#x27;ll find the first trailer below.

                              <span>Somewhere in the region of 8,000 games have been removed from Steam since its inception, from the mass banning of “fake games”, to publishers removing their own titles due to licensing disputes, pending re-releases, personal disillusionment, server shutdowns and political scandals. Valve even took down one of its own games. Released in 2004 with Steam AppID 92, Codename: Gordon is a Flash-based 2D side-scroller set in the Half-Life universe, developed by Nuclearvision and published by Valve. It was removed due to a hard-coded link to the now-defunct developer’s domain, which Valve regarded as a security risk.
But removed isn’t always the same as gone, and exploring Steam’s deleted items is an adventure through modern gaming history. I spoke to some developers of delisted games to find out more.

Ahead of that though, we’ve been introduced to another member of the game’s expanding cast of the still-living. New undead slayer Amy has been given her own teaser trailer, which you can watch here.

                              <span>A conversation in the RPS Treehouse the other day reminded me that there is only one game I have ever completed for the first time and then finished again, all within the span of a week. That game was The Walking Dead: The Final Season.
Having played all three previous seasons of Telltale&#x27;s choose-your-own-zombie-apocalypse tearjerker (plus the 400 Days DLC and the Michonne spin-off), it&#x27;s no surprise that I was incredibly invested in Clementine&#x27;s story by The Final Season. I&#x27;m not a big kid person, typically, but you&#x27;d have to be beyond heartless not to love little Clem, wouldn&#x27;t you? Even though, by the time TFS rolls around, she&#x27;s grown into medium-sized Clem, and is a bit bloody scary to boot.

                              <span>Card-based strategy games seem to have really found their feet over the last 12 months. Now that we&#x27;re a few years clear of Slay The Spire&#x27;s chokehold over the genre, deckbuilders are starting to come thick and fast in a variety of exciting mash-ups. This year alone, I&#x27;ve sunk a hefty number of hours into the deckbuilding tower defence &#x27;em up ORX, got lost in the tabletop plots of Foretales, and later this week we&#x27;ll see the launch of Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns, the new card-based strategy RPG from XCOM makers Firaxis. It&#x27;s a good time to be a fan of deckbuilders, is what I&#x27;m saying, and early next year the mythological exploits of Mahokenshi will be looking to carry the baton forward into 2023. 
Made by the Paris-based Game Source Studio, this turn-based strategy battler sees you take control of four types of samurai as you seek to bring balance to a mystical realm above the clouds. Oni, goblins and other creatures from Japanese myth are your primary antagonists here, but its hexagonal islands are also stuffed full of text-based narrative events, sidequests, and treasure troves to uncover. It&#x27;s a lot to take in, but the latter in particular are vital to your success. That&#x27;s because every time you start a new mission in Mahokenshi, you&#x27;ll be going in with a completely fresh deck - and based on an early preview build I&#x27;ve been playing recently, it&#x27;s both an ingenious way to keep things feeling fresh, but it can also be a double-edged sword when it comes to trying out new tactics.

                              <span>Having returned to World Of Warcraft after many, many years away from Azeroth in our new Inventory Space video series, I&#x27;m taken aback by how disjointed the new player experience has become. Blizzard have streamlined the early game, sure, but in doing so they&#x27;ve made it almost impossible to pin down my sense of place in the world. As Blizzard carves out new space for new regions and races with each and every expansion, I wonder: has the game become too big? Or put another way: am I unable to grasp just how vast its become?

                              <span>Starship Troopers, Paul Verhoeven’s deliberately scene-chewing take on Robert Heinlein’s dubious classic of military sci-fi, has been adapted for PC a fair bit. Games based on the interstellar action of the movie tend to end up veering towards the strategy genre though, such as the recent Terran Command. Well, Offworld Industries have loaded up a dropship with Starship Troopers: Extermination and plonked the licence right where it belongs on Planet Co-op FPS. It’s targeting a 2023 release, and probably the head carapace of a very confused giant alien insectoid, too. You can watch a short teaser for the game below.

                              <span>Microsoft might consider offering Sony a 10-year licensing deal for Call Of Duty to persuade European Union regulators to approve their Activision Blizzard acquisition. Reuters report that sources familiar with the deal claim an offer could come ahead of the European Commission’s January deadline for their statement of objection, a formal list of the body’s concerns about how the $68.7 billion (£57 billion) buyout deal might affect competition within the games industry. If Microsoft show willingness to offer concessions and ease the EU regulator’s competition concerns, that could potentially speed up the regulator’s decision-making process.

                              <span>Nintendo and animation studio Illumination shared the latest trailer for The Super Mario Bros. Movie today. Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto was on hand to introduce the new trailer; Anya Taylor-Joy (who is playing Princess Peach) and Seth Rogan (who voices Donkey Kong) also shared selfie videos of themselves sharing their contractually obligated excitement about participating in the film.
The trailer showed more of the Mushroom Kingdom and primarily focused on Donkey Kong and Princess Peach. We also heard more from Chris Pratt&#x27;s Mario, Charlie Day&#x27;s Luigi, and Jack Black&#x27;s Bowser (who explicitly refers to Mario as being a human). The trailer shows Mario training, fighting Donkey Kong, driving a kart on a rainbow road, traveling with Peach, and there was also one quick moment where we saw the human world.
The Super Mario Bros. Movie arrives in theaters on April 7, 2023. You can see our live reaction to the trailer below.</span>

This news comes by way of a new Overwatch 2 Season 2 trailer released today, which you can view below, alongside a new blog post from Blizzard. In the trailer, we get a look at the new tank hero joining the roster, Ramattra, as well as the new Shambali escort map going into the game&#x27;s regular rotation alongside returning favorites. Plus, we see Junker Queen&#x27;s new Mythic skin available in the new battle pass as well as a look at some of the holiday skins from upcoming holiday events.

                              <span>Before the release of Gotham Knights, Warner Bros. Games Montreal revealed that following the game&#x27;s launch, four-player co-op, a heavily requested feature by fans, would be added in the form of a new mode called Heroic Assault. That mode, as well as a new two-player mode called Showdown, are both live now in Gotham Knights thanks to a new update. 
The base campaign of Gotham Knights allows for two-player co-op play, but getting all four of the knights together wasn&#x27;t possible. That&#x27;s still the case while playing through the game&#x27;s story, but the new online cooperative Heroic Assault mode, which tasks players with defeating enemies and completing challenges across 30 floors, supports four-player play.

                              <span>Cyberpunk 2077 developer CD Projekt Red has revealed that its upcoming remake of The Witcher will be open-world. 
This news comes by way of a quarterly financial call held yesterday by the company in which CDPR briefly touched on this remake being handled by developer Fool&#x27;s Theory, as reported by VG247.  While not much was revealed, CDPR did reveal in the slide pictured below that Codename: Canis Majoris, which we now know to be The Witcher Remake, will be a &quot;story-driven, single player open-world RPG&quot; and a &quot;modern reimagining of 2007&#x27;s The Witcher.&quot;
This might come as a surprise because that 2007 game wasn&#x27;t open-world and instead took players through small hub-like levels in the city of Vizima. 
Unfortunatley, this slide is essentially all that was revealed in regards to The Witcher Remake. It might be a while before we learn more about this remake, too, considering that CDPR told fans to &quot;please be patient&quot; because &quot;it&#x27;s gonna be a while until we can share more details&quot; when the company announced this game last month. 
The Witcher Remake is just one of multiple projects in the works at CDPR. Last month, the company revealed it was developing a brand new Cyberpunk game, multiple new Witcher games (including this remake), and even a new IP under the codename &quot;Hadar.&quot;

                              <span>When I gave you a sneak peek at 1/1, my cyberpunk novel about teens saving the future with NFTs, I could not possibly have predicted that Elon Musk would become a controversial figure. No one could. But the infobahn baron played a role in my tale&#x27;s thrilling conclusion, and so my publishers are unthrilled by recent developments. They&#x27;re holding the novel&#x27;s launch back so I can address &#x27;the Musk issue&#x27; with a sequel released simultaneously. So as a Cyber Monday treat, allow me to top up your thrill levels with excerpts from book two: Original Content, a Non-Fungible Future drop.

                              <span>Yoshiro Kimura and his studio, Onion Games, are known for being off-beat. They make games that go in hard on their own strange internal worlds, wrapping up a particular sense of passion and energy in earnestly oddball humour. Undertale makes for a handy comparison - which makes sense, because many of the team worked on Moon, one of the games that inspired it. 
I&#x27;m telling you all this because it might pique your interest in their upcoming sandbox RPG, which we now know will be out at some point next year.

                              <span>I&#x27;m extremely excited to announce Inventory Space! A new video series in which Liam and I spend our precious free time with massive live-service games to see how much they demand from our schedules. Are we able to truly experience everything these games have to offer without sacrificing the bits of our daily routines that keep us from withering away at our monitors? How many hours do you really need to invest in order to fully experience a game? And is it even worth it, in the end? 
Inventory Space will – hopefully – give you a better idea of whether mammoth games will slot into your life neatly, or not at all.

You&#x27;ll see colours for days, mate. Buildings popping up in all manners of shapes and sizes, no objectives or nuffin&#x27;. Ahh, you want the new stuff, eh? Well lucky you, I just got some Gourdlets in.
Gourdlets is another city-building sandbox with no purpose beyond placing stuff you think looks nice, only this time little blob dudes will come visit and interact with what you&#x27;ve built. The first taste is free, by which I mean there&#x27;s an Itch demo you can tinker with while we wait for the Steam version.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been a bumpy road, but the new generation of plucky Settlers are at last approaching their destination. Now known as The Settlers: New Allies, Ubisoft&#x27;s Settlers reboot is due to come out on February 23rd.
Katharine quite liked what she played of the town-building RTS last January, but the devs decided feedback from their closed beta meant the game warranted more time in the oven, and thus a third major postponement since the game&#x27;s original 2018 announcement. Come watch the trailer below to see what&#x27;s new.

                              <span>Gaming monitors are great, but if we&#x27;re being realistic, they can very easily become one of the priciest building blocks in your entire PC gaming setup. If you are currently screen shopping, then, your best course of action is probably to take advantage of the current Cyber Monday gaming monitor deals.
My curated picks are all below, and as always, I’m only recommending sufficiently good hardware that’s available on a meaningful discount. A couple of our best gaming monitor members are even in here, though it’s a broad church overall, with 1080p, 1440p, and 4K screens making the cut alongside the occasional ultrawide model. We’re looking for gaming credentials specifically, too, so heightened refresh rates and support for variable sync tech (like FreeSync and G-Sync) are important.

                              <span>After more than six years of making games together, indie development team Sokpop Collective are just about to reach their 100th release in December. Hitting that milestone means the group have decided to change how they operate and adjust their Patreon. They’ll no longer be working to release one game per month. Sokpop are recommitting to releasing another 100 games though, so they’ll still be surprising us with intriguing diversions like village-building card game Stacklands or cutesy RTS King Pins. You can watch a trailer for their recently released 99th game, action RPG Springblades, below.

                              <span>Unlike with most flavours of PC hardware, the list of good Cyber Monday gaming laptop deals is noticeably smaller than the catalogue of quality, discounted notebooks that Black Friday brought. That’s partly stock running out, and partly retailers just being less willing to extend these sales over the weekend. Killjoys. Still, we’re not out of luck yet, nor out of laptops – as you’ll see below, there’s still a variety of deals to choose from, especially in the UK.

                              <span>Classic RPG Heroes of Might and Magic III has been transmuted into a board game, with its Kickstarter campaign currently on over 2.6 million pounds. That&#x27;s 6000% over its £43,000 funding goal. You people want this. Are you sure you want this?
The board game is a hybrid of competitive deckbuilding and exploration, where 1-4 players travel around an overworld collecting cards to play in separate combat encounters. I do dig deckbuilding, but I suspect this might lack a little magic to anyone who isn&#x27;t after a nostalgia kick.

                              <span>Mirrorshades cannot be the iconic eyewear of modern-day cyberpunk, I learned during a Microsoft Teams meeting. For decades, cyberpunks, hackers, and internauts have donned a cool pair of shiny shades to strike a cool pose. But mirrorshades are a serious security hazard in this age of video calls: other people can see your screen and desk reflected in the lenses. If you&#x27;re mirrored up, people can gain access to private data or see if you are, for example, playing Windows Solitaire instead of paying attention to the meeting. So what&#x27;s a 21st-century cyberpunk to wear? It&#x27;s not like you can go without cool glasses (or stop playing Solitaire during meetings). I have ideas.

                              <span>Synced (formerly Synced: Off Planet) is heading into open beta on December 10th, and has quite a few hyphenated terms applied to it. This sci-fi game is both squad-based and match-based, a roguelite hero-shooter, and Tencent&#x27;s publishing division Level Infinite even go as far as describing it as a rogue-looter, of all things. Whatever you want to call it, though, the main thrust of the game is about finding and taming machine creatures known as Nanos in a techno-apocalypse, mostly so you can battle more Nanos inside a special sealed zone called The Meridian. Come and see what to expect when the beta begins in an exclusive gameplay trailer below.

Thought it’s more than a handful, really – multiple big, stretching fistfuls of quality PC storage deals are still running, and should continue to do so until the clock strikes midnight. Or until they run out of stock. Hopefully the former.

                              <span>For what has felt like my entire life (but was probably only the months of October and November) every ad I was served on YouTube was for a sale on Her Interactive&#x27;s Nancy Drew games. I remember it not only because the content is burned into my brain, but because they themed it around getting involved in cosplay, and got a bunch of cosplayers - and no disprespect to them, because they did a great job - to dress as characters from the games. And I kept thinking, like... what? Apart from Ms Drew, what characters are worth cosplaying from a series of licensed Nancy Drew puzzle games?
Anyway it clearly didn&#x27;t matter, because I saw the ads so often that I went and bought the most recent one out of curiosity. You win, Her Interactive! Midnight In Salem is a spooky mystery wherein Nancy Drew must solve an arson case (with the Hardy Boys in tow, no less) that has possible occult tie ins. It came out in 2019, and is Nancy Drew #33. 33 Nancy Drew games! Imagine. Also, I cannot download it and I have spent over two weeks trying.

The deal price is £456.70, versus a normal price of £600, and is for stock from Amazon US - but that includes shipping, import duty and all other potential fees. There&#x27;s even the possibility that fees are less than expected, as several US items I&#x27;ve ordered from Amazons overseas have come with small discounts.

                              <span>Two of the best gaming mice - and indeed, the best ultralight mouse in the RPS guide to gaming mice that are good - are going exceedingly cheap on Amazon UK today. The Pulsefire Haste and Pulsefire Haste Wireless are ideal for competitive and casual gaming alike, with lightweight designs and high-end specs, and now you can pick either for little. 
The wired Pulsefire Haste (£20, normally £50) is the cheaper and lighter option, weighing in at 59 grams, while the wireless Pulsefire Haste Wireless (£40, normally £90) offers more freedom but requires recharging every 100 hours. It also weighs a tiny bit more, at 61 grams.

                              <span>In 2010, the makers of Swiss Army knives introduced a new model for the digital age: the Presentation Master. To help you dominate PowerPoint presentations on the battlefields of corporate warfare, the knife&#x27;s fold-out tools included a laser pointer, a Bluetooth remote control for changing slides, and a USB thumb drive. I need it. This is an amazing cyberpunk PC peripheral, and a rare product targetted at megacorp middle-managers rather the leather-clad rabble of hackers, scavs, and street samurai. I need it so much.

                              <span>A remake of Like A Dragon spin-off Ryū Ga Gotoku Kenzan could potentially happen, but devs RGG Studio say they&#x27;ll only consider it if the series&#x27; other upcoming spin-off Ishin is a “a huge hit.” The comments came up in a recent interview by Ungeek with RGG Studio executive producer Masayoshi Yokoyama and chief director Hiroyuki Sakamoto. Although the remake of Ishin was announced during Sony’s September State Of Play stream, Kenzan seems quite far from being picked up for a revamp.

                              <span>Matthias Linda is feeling tense. Chained Echoes, the retro Japanese-inspired RPG he&#x27;s been working on as a solo dev for the last seven years, is almost ready to release on Steam, but he tells me there&#x27;s &quot;still so many little and not so little things to do&quot; before the big day hits on December 8th. &quot;[I] still need to patch the languages into the console versions. Still need to pass one submission,&quot; he says over email. &quot;I can’t really think about the release itself, just about the things I need to finish till then.&quot;
But he also says he&#x27;s &quot;happy at the same time&quot;. After a successful Kickstarter campaign in 2019, Chained Echoes has been gradually gathering steam ever since - and judging by the 90-minute demo I was able to play recently, it&#x27;s clear Linda&#x27;s got something really quite special here. Not only do its 16-bit-style visuals look absolutely stunning, but its turn-based combat&#x27;s also unlike anything else I&#x27;ve seen. You&#x27;ve still got your classic list of commands to pick from, but as battles progress you&#x27;ll need to maintain a kind of flow state known as Overdrive to deal the optimum amount of damage. Overextend your party&#x27;s abilities and you&#x27;ll leave yourself vulnerable to critical hits from your enemies, but go too slow and you&#x27;ll need to build your Overdrive bar back up to regain those lost stat buffs. It&#x27;s a fascinating system, and was borne out of Linda&#x27;s desire to &quot;build a bridge between the worlds&quot; of considered, turn-based tactical combat and the fast-paced action of real-time.

                              <span>Grim co-op action game Warhammer 40,000: Darktide is out on PC on Wednesday, and devs Fatshark have taken a load off players’ minds by confirming that progression from the pre-order beta will carry over. Although Fatshark had mentioned in previous Steam updates about the game’s beta that player progression might not be fully guaranteed, they tweeted over the weekend to let players know that progression will be maintained once the game’s released. I do like that they address everyone as “rejects” in their announcements, it makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.

GTPlanet report that Yamauchi made the comments when asked about the possibility of a port, given that more and more PlayStation games are heading in PC’s direction. The 25-year-old racing series has always been a die-hard exclusive for Sony’s consoles up until now.

Offworld is making Extermination in collaboration with Sony Pictures Consumer Products and in the game, players will engage in squad-based FPS combat to exterminate the arachnid threat fans of the 1997 film will know really well. Those squads will need to work together in order to complete objectives, acquire resources necessary to continue the fight, build and defend a base of operations, and ultimately, escape to the one extraction point as a team.

                              <span>Sega released Sonic Frontiers earlier this month and while fans have been finding plenty of fun in this new open world-ish take on the blue blur, they&#x27;ve also been running into some bugs. Fortunately, Sega is releasing a new Sonic Frontiers patch on all platforms to address some of these bugs and bring additional optimization to the game. 
This news comes by way of a new tweet from the official Japanese Sonic the Hedgehog Twitter account that reveals update 1.10 &quot;fixes an issue where the boss would sometimes disappear when retrying the boss battle on Chronos Island,&quot; as reported by Video Games Chronicle. This update is already live on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 and is expected to begin rolling out to other platforms very soon. 


Other fixes in the 1.10 patch include fixing the Chaos Island map to display properly after clearing the island, fixing crashing bugs and audio issues, adding UI improvements, optimizing stability and performance, and more, according to Update Crazy, as noted by VGC. 
While waiting for the patch to download, read Game Informer&#x27;s Sonic Frontiers review and then check out our top 10 tips to help you build momentum in the game.

                              <span>Warner Bros. Discovery revealed last month that it had hired Peter Safran and Marvel Studios alum and director James Gunn (Guardians of the Galaxy, The Suicide Squad, Peacemaker) to lead as co-CEOs of DC Studios, as reported by Variety. Since then, Gunn has been fielding questions about DC Studios, the DCU&#x27;s future, and what his plans are as a new lead within DC&#x27;s entertainment output. 
When asked on Twitter yesterday if he and Safran are &quot;planning to give more DC characters TV shows that&#x27;ll add to the story for the DCEU,&quot; Gunn responded, &quot;Yes, most definitely, the DCU will be connected across film and TV (and animation).&quot; In a follow-up tweet, another user asked is there are plans to connect games to this larger DCU canon as well, to which Gunn simply responded, &quot;Yes.&quot; 
Yes.
November 27, 2022
It&#x27;s an interesting response and idea, especially given that it seems clear Warner Bros. Discovery wants its DCU to become something more akin to Marvel Studios&#x27; MCU. However, MCU plans don&#x27;t include video games because Marvel&#x27;s video game efforts through partners such as Insomniac Games (Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man), Crystal Dynamics (Marvel&#x27;s Avengers), and others do not connect in any way.
In fact, Marvel Games vice president and creative director Bill Roseman said back in September that it&#x27;s important that each studios&#x27; Marvel game is not connected to the rest as it allows for narrative freedom said studio might not get otherwise.
This is one area DC could differ greatly from Marvel and who knows, perhaps it&#x27;s the creative edge DC needs to catch up to the MCU. Only time will tell. 
In the meantime, check out our thoughts on the latest DC game in Game Informer&#x27;s Gotham Knights review. Read our list of the top 10 superhero games of all time after that.

                              <span>As part of an anti-piracy campaign against people who allegedly streamed the Jake Paul vs. Ben Askren fight in 2021, Triller sued the operator of the YourEXTRA YouTube channel. Last week a California court found Arvin De La Santos liable for $150,000 in copyright infringement damages, a &quot;landmark&quot; win according to Triller. The details of the case provide a little more nuance.

                              <span>While Valve have now released their own dock for the Steam Deck, the third-party alternatives which beat them to market are still worth considering. Chief among them is Jsaux&#x27;s line of Steam Deck compatible docks. If you decide you want something with a lower price than Valve&#x27;s official hardware, then you can currently find the JSAUX 6-in-1 Steam Deck dock for just $38/£40 as part of this weekend&#x27;s Black Friday deals.

Still, it&#x27;s getting bigger if you want it to with Tales From The Far Territory, a paid expansion pass that will deliver a year of updates beginning on December 5th. A new trailer shows a little of the new region below.

                              <span>Multiple beta releases often indicate lots of bugs to be fixed, but in this case we got carried away adding features and thought more testing was needed. New features since beta1 include: Variable interface scaling at whatever size you want (not just 2x and 4x), with optional chunky bevels for that retro feel. Multi-track level crossings to keep road vehicles from stopping in the middle of the crossing. A new Generate World menu which now includes NewGRF, AI, and Game Script configuration menus. Cargo filters for vehicle lists (such as at stations) to allow better visualization of traffic. Optional cargo names above vehicles in vehicle lists, to show at a glance what they carry. The ability to clone or share orders with vehicles grouped by shared orders. An improved local authority action window which now shows you actions you can’t afford, instead of hiding them. In addition, some new tools are available to AI and Game Script authors: Scriptable league tables which can replace the default scoring system AI and Game Scripts can now be modified in Scenario Editor for existing scenarios (although not savegames) (As ever, see the changelog for further details).

It comes in sizes from 500GB to 4TB, and now that massive biggest size is discounted: just £225, down from a UK RRP of £475 for a cool £250 discount.

Whether the resulting law enforcement actions will be effective in the long run is unknown but BREIN plans to seek a site-blocking order if the shadow library reappears on the surface web.

                              <span>Here&#x27;s an exciting &#x27;AI can do that now&#x27; moment: Meta&#x27;s latest AI, Cicero, can beat human players at classic negotiation and betrayal game Diplomacy. While playing online at webDiplomacy.net, it&#x27;s achieved &quot;more than double the average score of human players&quot;, ranking &quot;in the top 10 percent of participants who played more than one game&quot;. It can figure out who needs persuading to do what, then engage with those players using impressive and effective natural language. 
I won&#x27;t do a &#x27;taking over the world&#x27; joke. I won&#x27;t.

                              <span>What if spiders had lightsabers is an impeccable premise for a game, and Spiderheck delivers on that premise with aplomb. It&#x27;s an arena fighting game geared towards couch co-op and couch competition, but there&#x27;s online play and single-player modes too. Yesterday&#x27;s &quot;THE TRIALS OF JAZEPS&quot; update added new difficulty levels to wave survival, as well as custom trials you can send to your friends. 

It also chucks in some new maps with portals, because the only thing better than a lightsaber-wielding spider is a lightsaber wielding spider suddenly emerging from a portal.

                              <span>With the possible exception of Gwent, mini-games inside open world RPGs tend to suck. They&#x27;re often poor imitations of much deeper and exciting board and card games you can play in the real world, offered as an unwanted break from the monsters I&#x27;ve come to stick a sword through. Will Genshin Impact&#x27;s upcoming Genius Invokation TCG buck that trend? 
Probably not, no, but we&#x27;ll know for sure when the Version 3.3 update lands on December 7th. There&#x27;s also a new quest that takes place after the game&#x27;s main storyline, a couple new playable characters, and a Breakout mini-game. Ah. I do actually quite like Breakout.

                              <span>It’s getting to the time in winter when we reflect on the year, and pick our Bestest Best games that we’ve played over the past twelve months (okay eleven months, but December is always kinda quiet). We recently had this chat in the RPS hive-mind, and going through each month and making note of my favourite releases completely shocked me with how many fantastic mystery games have come out this year. It’s honestly awesome. 
I’m a huge fan of mysteries in games, with some of my all-time favouites being Kentucky Route Zero, The Return Of The Obra Dinn, and Disco Elysium. I just like getting wrapped up in a good story that will kick my brain into gear. Strange murders, devious disappearances, and just general strange happenings - I love all of it.

Out today after two years of development, the ambitious mod promises 3-4 hours of barrel-chucking, window-breaking, train-dodging, combine-blasting fun.  
Perhaps the full package will pale in comparison to Valve&#x27;s polish, but the bit in this trailer where the player scurries down a train while contorting around manhacks looks oh-so appetisingly transportative. I think it&#x27;s time I dug out my lighthouses.

Every time, nada, at least in the UK. Only now, during Black Friday proper, has its price dropped – and damned far too, with Amazon chopping £70 off the RRP to bring our top wireless gaming mouse pick down to just £50.

While I was there, I also had the chance to interview three of the series leads: Tom Heaton, creative director on both The Devil In Me and Man Of Medan; Will Doyle, creative director across the whole Dark Pictures Anthology and director of last year&#x27;s entry House Of Ashes; and Dan McDonald, the studio director for the anthology.

Like all the best couch co-op games, it&#x27;s very easy to get to grips with the controls: you have a sword, and you can raise it or lower it across three different heights to try and get around your opponent&#x27;s guard. There are other things you can do, like ducking, and jumping, and throwing your sword. But so many fights come down to a tense little close-range shuffle where each player stands just out of range of the other&#x27;s blade, moving their sword higher and lower in a seconds-long game of chicken.
Oh look, now I&#x27;m holding rock! Can you switch to paper fast enough? Nope, now I&#x27;m holding scissors! Oh, and now it&#x27;s paper! Now rock again! Now paper! What will you do?... Oh. You can just jump over me and keep running. Fair enough, I suppose.

                              <span>Survival games! Oh, the many disparaging remarks I could make if only I had time in between punching rocks and eating an entire deer. It&#x27;s not often that I recommend one here, and jokes aside, it&#x27;d be unfair and untrue to say it&#x27;s because there aren&#x27;t enough good ones. It&#x27;s more that I don&#x27;t have much room for new ones.

Lilith Odyssey is, if we must, a survival game and a roguelike (oh, the many dispara-[yeah alright, alright. Jesus. - ed.]), but that is reductive. This is a strange and somewhat contradictory game I feel uneasy comparing directly to anything, except possibly the wonderful Taxinaut (which is now on Steam, incidentally). Lilith Odyssey is very much what I&#x27;d call a vibes-based game.

                              <span>Black Friday generally doesn’t involve as many CPU deals as it does, say, SSD deals or gaming keyboard deals – probably because there just aren’t that many CPUs. Nevertheless, a few choice discounts have emerged for an unlikely group of chips: Intel’s 13th Gen Raptor Lake processors. These only released late in October, so it’s a welcome surprise to them on the Black Friday chopping block so soon.

                              <span>During my journey into the depths of TikTok&#x27;s dabloon craze, I’ve joined a cult who worship the high priestess Dabloonis, have sailed across the high seas on a pirate ship called The Dabloonian, and accidentally taken part in a dabloon heist that&#x27;s now made me a wanted fugitive by the dabloon police. It&#x27;s been a strange couple of hours.
Dabloontok is TikTok’s newest trend, and is probably best described as a chaotic player-generated RPG where users collect an imaginary currency called &quot;dabloons&quot; cashed out by awkwardly photoshopped black cats (usually) in fantasy settings. These cats will either gift you dabloons, steal your dabloons, or tell you what you can do with your dabloons. It&#x27;s as simple as that, and so far there more than 520 million views on the dabloons hashtag. It’s kinda wild.

                              <span>A tiny bridge makes so much sense as a late-game Vampire Survivors challenge stage. The game&#x27;s arguably at its most captivating when the hordes start clogging up your death machinery, squeezing you into tighter and tighter corridors as you pray for a power-up or multi-item chest. It&#x27;s pleasantly squirmy, but will the bridge added in yesterday&#x27;s appropriately titled &quot;The Tiny One&quot; update be too squirmy? 
The update also added a couple new achievements, and an item that lets you banish a weapon or power-up of your choosing across all of your runs. Come see.

Case in point: today’s rumblings that Grasshopper Manufacture, the devs behind the No More Heroes series, are working on a AAA game in the Aliens universe. This caught Grasshopper Manufacture&#x27;s founder and CEO Goichi Suda, aka Suda51, so much by surprise that he wordlessly tweeted his utter bemusement at the rumour. I’m taking that as a no for the Alien game, then.

                              <span>I’ve been excited about developer Flying Wild Hog’s Evil West since its reveal at The Game Awards in 2020. So much about it immediately captured my attention. Despite Red Dead Redemption’s best efforts, I’ve always felt there’s a shortage of wild wests in video games, although some games use a western’s formula to tell a story set elsewhere. Evil West’s premise also feels reminiscent of something you’d see in the PlayStation 2 era: cowboys who protect mere mortals from the secret horrors of the world, such as vampires and other creatures. My mind can’t help but see Darkwatch, a game I played repeatedly as a child, when I see Evil West. 
Even more generally, that era was great for third-person action westerns – Gun, Red Dead Revolver, the aforementioned Darkwatch, and Call of Juarez (althou…</span>

                              <span>​God of War Ragnarök is a world full of scowling gods and monsters butting heads as they each work toward their best interests. The nine realms are dark and dangerous, but through all of that shines a beam of unexpected light, and I am not talking about Brok, the dwarf who seems incapable of finishing a sentence without including some kind of vulgarity before meeting the period at the end. I am talking about Ratatoskr, the eyepatch-wearing squirrel who watches over Yggdrasil, the world tree that holds the realms in place.
Ratatoskr technically appeared in God of War (2018), but he was less of a character and more of an ability. Atreus could summon the translucent blue squirrel to bring health items and sometimes hacksilver. In God of War Ragnarök, Ratatoskr is a physical, non-translucent c…</span>

You&#x27;ll need to log in to your GI account and click &quot;okay to print&quot; for your letter or question to go through. We&#x27;d also love it if you included your location (city, state, or country will do). We&#x27;ll look through the questions and pick a few to include in our next issue, which releases on December 20.
For each issue, we ask our community a question for our SoundOff section. This time around, we want to know...
&quot;What&#x27;s the best gaming-related gift you&#x27;ve ever received?&quot;
You can answer this question and/or include any other feedback you want. Thank you again for your support throughout the years, and we hope many of you get the chance to have your letter printed in an upcoming issue!

                              <span>As of writing, the fastest runthrough of Neon White’s “Smackdown” level is 9.56 seconds, earned by player “earlobe” on September 6, 2022.
Standing in contrast is the work that went into it. According to designer and creative director Ben Esposito, the earliest iteration was in March 2019, more than three years before its release in June 2022. In that time, there were more than 50 different iterations. Sometimes changes were small. Other times they fundamentally altered the level. Every designer who worked on the game has touched Smackdown in some form. Nevertheless, load into it now; chances are all that labor is invisible to you. Before sitting down to write, I beat it in just 11 seconds.
Neon White is a game built around speedrunning. Levels are short. If you’re playing as intended, you hardly notice your surroundings before moving on. But the only way that works effectively is if levels are meticulously designed to facilitate that movement; they have to be made so that it feels natural for the player to fly through them. Making a level you barely think twice about takes a lot of effort. Read more...</span>

It&#x27;s a list we will be updating as often as games worthy of inclusion release. We will kick games off and add new ones as the Switch&#x27;s library grows.
Please note that while the list below contains 10 entries, we aren’t actually ranking them – if a game has made it this far (and managed to stay here), it’s a must-play, period. As such, we’ll be listing entries in reverse chronological order. Also, you’ll find a rundown of previous entries at the bottom of the list. While those titles have gotten bumped for bigger and better experiences, they are still all great games in their own right and worth exploring if you’re alread…</span>

                              <span>Despite an avalanche of entries since its original release in 1991, many still consider Sonic the Hedgehog 2 the pinnacle of the series. Sonic the Hedgehog 2 was showered with praise upon release in 1992 and surprisingly, that sterling reputation hasn&#x27;t faded decades later. We asked the people behind the game&#x27;s success to share how Sonic&#x27;s second outing became one of Sega&#x27;s driving forces in its fight against Nintendo.
Coming off of the massive success of the Japan-developed Sonic the Hedgehog, Sega relocated development efforts for the sequel to the newly founded Sega Technical Institute in the U.S. Sega tapped Mark Cerny to lead the STI, who has since gone on to help create other mascots like Crash Bandicoot and Spyro the Dragon.

                              <span>The propellers spin down, and I step off the puddle-jumper plane onto the tarmac of the tiniest airport I’ve ever visited. Instantly, I’m overcome by the scent of greenery – lush and humid, with a hint of maybe mint. Jungle surrounds this strip of paved runway in every direction. And I’m here, of all things, to see a video game.
But first, I must explore a place on the other side of the world I hadn’t even heard of a month earlier – a narrow island called Lifou, part of a French territory known as New Caledonia, which sits some 750 miles east of Australia. I’m meeting a small team of game developers who have chosen to find inspiration for their new game in this remote locale. The team is toying with a big idea: Craft a game that’s rewarding in its own right but simultaneously introduces players of the world to a place most of them have never seen. Read more...</span>

                              <span>In today&#x27;s New Gameplay Today, your hosts Wesley LeBlanc and Kyle Hilliard jump into Outer Terror, an upcoming pulp action-horror game coming to PC sometime soon. 
The two discuss the game&#x27;s visual style, how it plays, its similarities to Vampire Survivors, and everything else going on in this exclusive preview. This demo build features a small snippet of one of the game&#x27;s five volumes and our gameplay showcases how the on-screen action works, the horrors from beyond, and how quests work in Outer Terror. 
Check out Outer Terror for yourself below in this installment of New Gameplay Today: 


As you can see, Outer Terror is shaping up to be a great time, perfect for those moments where you&#x27;ve got 10 or 15 minutes to blitz through hordes of the undead, monsters from beyond, and more. For more about Outer Terror and what to expect from the game, check out our coverage of the game from last month. 
Outer Terror hits PC via Steam and the VoxPop Games Store (with exclusive content on that storefront, too), but a release date has not yet been revealed.

It’ll be a night of celebrities, game announcements, and an infamous afterparty full of alcohol, confetti, and blaring music. It’ll take over Twitter, and leave more than a few people nursing headaches the following day.
But today, instead of focusing on his big night, studio head Masayoshi Yokoyama is sitting in a conference room talking about why he loves Neon Genesis Evangelion. Read more...</span>

                              <span>Pokémon Scarlet and Violet sold more than 10 million combined units over its launch weekend, claiming the top spot for most three-day launch weekend software sales in Nintendo&#x27;s history. The number, which includes physical and downloadable copies as reported by Nintendo, already places Pokémon Scarlet and Violet in the top 15 best-selling Nintendo Switch titles of all time. In this three-day number, Pokémon Scarlet and Violet have already outpaced lifetime sales of games such as Splatoon 3, Kirby and the Forgotten Land, Nintendo Switch Sports, and Super Mario 3D World + Bowser&#x27;s Fury.
The current overall best-selling Nintendo Switch title is Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, which has sold just over 48 million units as of the end of September. As of this writing, the Pokémon franchise occupies 3 of the top 10 slots of lifetime Nintendo Switch software sales, with Let&#x27;s Go, Pikachu and Eevee at number 10, Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl at number 8, and Sword and Shield at number 5. Pokémon Scarlet and Violet need to sell just under 5 million more combined copies to crack into the top 10. To date, the Nintendo Switch has sold over 114 million units.
Pokémon Scarlet and Violet represent the first time players are able to explore a fully open-world environment in a mainline Pokémon RPG. While critics praised various aspects of the newest games in the series, the technical performance has been universally panned. However, despite those concerns, Game Freak, The Pokémon Company, and Nintendo clearly have another massive hit on their hands. You can read our full review of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet here.</span>

                              <span>Fighting aliens in video games have been an important part of the medium since its inception. The very first video game, Space War, was about a war in space. Space Invaders was an early cultural phenomenon that was rumored to have inhaled so many coins that it created supply issues for the currency in Japan. Halo, one of the biggest video game franchises ever created, is about an ongoing war with aliens. We enjoy fighting aliens in video games because it’s easy to make creatures from another planet the enemy and they can look like anything.
The smaller, more personal alien invasion story, however, is a specific sub-genre of extra-terrestrial narrative we don’t often see in video games. When we fight aliens, it’s usually a power trip meant to offer a playground of action possibilities, but …</span>

The arrest arrives in the wake of stronger-than-usual rumors that police were preparing to hit pirate IPTV entities during the World Cup.

                              <span>Putlocker is a familiar name among piracy watchers. The original platform&#x27;s .com domain was retired many years ago after its operators felt Hollywood breathing down their necks. That doesn&#x27;t mean their old domain is worthless though. The Putlocker brand remains popular and just recently the putlocker.com domain sold at auction for more than $100k.

This isn’t a Top 10 Action Games of All Time list or a Top 10 Action Games of a Generation list. Instead, we’re tackling this one from the angle of what’s important, what’s incredible, and what’s fantastic right now. As in today. This week. This month. So when you don’t see a Dark Souls game on this list, that’s why even though I’d recommend a fresh playthrough of Dark Souls 3 every day.

Street Fighter 6 is no different in this regard. Amid the new additions like Kimberly, Jamie, and Luke, longtime players can find comfort in the presence of fighters like Ryu, Chun-Li, Guile, and Ken appearing as well. However, even those returning fighters have some changes to their looks, outfits, and personalities for this sixth mainline entry.
During our trip to Osaka, Japan, where we visited Capcom&#x27;s headquarters, we sat down with Street Fighter 6 art director Kaname Fujioka to learn more about his time at Capcom. &quot;The biggest inspiration for me wanting to join Capcom and work on fighting games was Street Fighter II,&quot; he says. &quot;I w…</span>

                              <span>A new Fire Emblem Engage trailer has detailed how players can summon &quot;Emblems,&quot; characters from past Fire Emblem games. Units will be able to equip Engage Rings to gain the ability to gain the power of a hero, like Marth or Byleth. When units equip the rings, they become synced with the Emblems, boosting their stats and giving them access to new, Emblem-specific skills. Based on the demonstration in the trailer, this will make a massive difference in a unit’s power level.


Units can also “Engage” with the Emblems, fusing into a new form even more powerful than a synced form. In addition to gaining access to special weapons, the player can use Engage Skills: unique abilities that harken back to the Emblems’ original games. For example, since Byleth was a teacher in Fire Emblem: Three Houses, one of his abilities allows him to teach nearby units, boosting their stats. Meanwhile, Corrin can use an ability called Dragon Vein, which alters the terrain in the same way she was able to in Fire Emblem Fates.
In total, the trailer showed off six Emblems: Marth (Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon), Sigurd (Fire Emblem: Genealogy of the Holy War), Celica (Fire Emblem Gaiden/Fire Emblem Echoes: Shadows of Valentia), Lyn (Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade), Corrin (Fire Emblem Fates), and Byleth (Fire Emblem: Three Houses). Additionally, a trailer from last week features glimpses of Ike and Lucina, and then mentions 12 rings, implying that Engage will feature more Emblems at launch.
Fire Emblem Engage was announced at a Nintendo Direct back in September. The initial trailer revealed that Alear, the game’s protagonist, is the Divine Dragon, a descendant of a royal family of Dragons that defeated the Fell Dragon many years ago. We’ll know the full story and more when the game launches on January 20, 2023.</span>

Multiplayer is a must, but something competitive might not be the way to go – there are only so many games of Mario Party and Monopoly a group of people can play together before they want to rip each others&#x27; heads off.
In this case, co-op is the way to go: specifically, something everyone can play in the same room on the same TV. But with so many games out there, how do you separate a perfect holiday gift from a dastardly holiday grift? Fret not! We&#x27;ve compiled a list of some of the best games to turn that seasonal boredom into wintertime wonderment. Here&#x27;s a collection of couch co-op games that&#x27;ll get you crowned as the coolest cousin of the year.

Terayama, member of Capcom&#x27;s in-house band, shows off the individual instruments that comprise Kimberly&#x27;s music, the process of revising a track based on work from the larger development team, and why Kimberly&#x27;s old-school tastes pair well with the game&#x27;s hip-hop inspirations.

The two also discuss how presenting Atari games as a WarioWare-like microgame collection is the perfect way to showcase these classic titles.

                              <span>Legendary Sonic designer and Balan Wonderworld director Yuji Naka has been arrested in Tokyo in connection to an insider trading investigation involving the reveal of a Dragon Quest game. 
According to the Japanese news outlet FNN, the last 24 hours saw ex-Square Enix employee Taisuke Sazaki and his friend Fumiaki Suzuki arrested on suspicion for insider trading. In 2020, developer Aiming had been set to announce its mobile game Dragon Quest Tact, and Sazaki and Suzuki are alleged to have known details about the game before it was publicly revealed. The pair reportedly purchased a combined 162,000 shares of Aiming for roughly 47.2 million yen (or over $335,000) in advance with the intent of profiting on a potentially higher stock price stemming from Tact’s announcement. 
Yuji Naka is now suspected of being involved in this scandal as well. He is accused of purchasing 10,000 shares worth 2.8 million yen (roughly $20,000) in Aiming for the same purpose of profiting from Tact’s reveal. Naka was apprehended by Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office, and the investigation is ongoing. It’s currently unknown if the suspects still own their shares or if they already sold them.  
This is the second major controversy Naka has found himself involved with this year. In April, Naka publicly blasted Square Enix on Twitter over his removal as director from Balan Wonderworld prior to its release, blaming Square for the game’s critical failure. This outburst came after the conclusion of a lawsuit he’d previously filed against the publisher. Naka is best known as the lead programmer behind the original Sonic the Hedgehog games for Sega Genesis and Nights into Dreams.

                              <span>Each time we start up a new mainline Pokémon game, we begin our journey with a choice. Sometimes it&#x27;s an easy one. Sometimes it&#x27;s agonizing. But regardless of where on that spectrum each generation lands for you, the general choice remains the same: grass, water, or fire. Thanks to the rock-paper-scissors nature of the types on offer, no one option is, by definition, superior. For Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, those types are represented through Sprigatito, Quaxly, and Fuecoco.
Now that Pokémon Scarlet and Violet are officially out in the wild, we want to know which starter you&#x27;re rolling with. While you&#x27;re at it, which factors go into making your decision? Do you always choose that type? Did you research what the final evolutions look like? Or do you just go with your gut based on how they look and behave?
Let us know if you&#x27;re kicking off your Paldea region adventure with Sprigatito, Quaxly, or Fuecoco in the comments below!</span>

We’ve seen our computers powering airport departure boards and train timetable screens, and even telling people which way they should walk round IKEA to maximise the likelihood that they file for divorce before getting out of IKEA. And because Raspberry Pi is so […]
