                              <span>It’s been a long time since Little Devil Inside, a promising survival action RPG from indie developer Neostream, has made any noise. The game’s last substantial update came in October 2021. But after over two years of silence, Neostream has come back with a new trailer and cryptic update hinting at what’s been going on with the team.
As reported by The Indie Informer, Neostream’s Kickstarter post, published yesterday, apologizes for the lack of updates and cryptically alludes to an internal conflict within the team, potentially due to clashing visions about the game, being one of the causes. It states in part,
The rest of Neostream&#x27;s update indicates the team has reduced in size but confirms that the founders and core members remain at the studio. The studio assures backers that Little Devil Inside still exists and that it is currently discussing publishing before it can give fans a more substantial update. Until then, the team has prepared a six-minute montage video showing off the game running in Unreal Engine 5.


Little Devil Inside was first revealed way back in 2015 with the launch of its Kickstarter campaign, but it gained its first mainstream recognition as part of the 2020 PlayStation 5 showcase prior to the console&#x27;s launch. You play as an explorer who embarks on research mission at the behest of a university professor to explore a large world filled with beasts both real and supernatural. You&#x27;ll visit different towns along the way to meet quirky citizens, defend yourself from threats with a sword, and engage in survival mechanics like camping and cooking. Despite how much time as past, we ultimately still know relatively little about Little Devil Inside but it has remained a charmer each time it resurfaces. 
Little Devil Inside has no release window but we&#x27;re hoping to learn more concrete details in the near future.</span>

                              <span>After a decade-long hiatus, EA Sports&#x27; College Football is coming back. Not only is it reviving a beloved series for football fans, but it&#x27;s also bringing all 134 FBS (formerly Division I-A) schools along for the ride.


It&#x27;s no Mutant Football League, but it&#x27;ll do


First released as Bill Walsh College Football in 1993, the series was renamed College Football USA in 1996, and NCAA Football in 1998. Then, the NCAA opted not to renew its licensing contract with EA in 2013 due to a legal dispute regarding player likenesses. Despite plans to continue under the College Football name, EA put a pause on the series after several conferences revoked their licenses with the publisher.


Screenshot via EASPORTSCollege on X


On February 2, 2021, the official EASPORTSCollege X account made a post stating &quot;College Football is coming back.&quot; Fast forward to this morning with the announcement that all 134 FBS schools would be in the next entry in the series, College Football 25.


Additionally, per The Athletic, players on any of the teams within the included 134 FBS schools can opt-in for inclusion in the title. In return, they&#x27;ll receive $600 and a copy of the game. Initial rosters will include up to 85 players and those who don&#x27;t opt-in will have a generic avatar as their stand-in. The Athletic anticipates at least 11,000 players to be represented, so EA would be shelling out $6.6M at minimum if they all opt in. With that kind of payout, EA needs to ship a massive number of copies to recoup costs.


Fortunately for the publisher, college football in the States is a huge business, with individual teams in the Big Ten generating upwards of $134M a year. After a 10-year absence, EA could be well-poised to strike, like an oilman in the Texas oil boom.

                              <span>A previously PC-only turn-based strategy game, Warhammer 40K: Chaos Gate - Daemonhunters is now available on Xbox and PlayStation consoles. PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Xbox One owners can now play the Warhammer universe-based adventure for the first time. I&#x27;ve spent some time playing it on PC already, so here&#x27;s what you&#x27;re getting, console players.


What console players should expect


Chaos Gate - Daemonhunters is a turn-based strategy game developed by Complex Games. It takes place in the Warhammer 40,000 universe, like Darktide, Space Marine, Rogue Trader, and Boltgun, for example. This simply means it uses characters, creatures, environments, and lore from the franchise.

                              <span>If roguelites, transforming robots, and tearing corrupt corporations down from within are all on your to-do list, Metal Mind might just be up your alley. Publisher 2P Games announced that the latest from developer WHIRLLAXY LIMITED is set to launch on Nintendo Switch and PC (via Epic Games Store) on March 7, 2024.


Any of the ideas here might not be novel on their own, but the trailer certainly has my interest piqued. I&#x27;ll admit, a lot of that has to do with the visuals. Yes, it&#x27;s another pixel art roguelite, but so far I&#x27;m digging the designs, effects, and how it all appears to work in tandem with the core customization mechanic. 


Throw in a plot to liberate your fellow robots and overthrow an organization full of crooked politicians, scientists, engineers, and secret agents and you have my attention.




The aforementioned nogoodniks at the corporation known as AWC are looking to remove sentience from robots and exercise total control over every single automaton. Naturally, that means you have to build your own transforming mecha with the help of more than 100 weapons and a variety of core component mods. The weapons can range from rapid-fire naval artillery to flaming chainsaws and laser cannons, and they can be augmented with mods that address overheating issues, raise your firing rate, and more. 


The level of randomization that comes along with weapon and mod pickups moves Metal Mind firmly into roguelite territory, hopefully keeping each run interesting Beyond that, it looks like the meat of the game lies in mixing and matching what you find and the top-down combat that follows. When Metal Mind makes its way to Switch and Epic Games Store it&#x27;ll be priced at $17.99 with a 15% discount at launch.

                              <span>Two years after Elden Ring was released, we finally got our first look at the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC. From cryptic teases to ghastly enemies, it had it all, and it sounds like there will still be some challenges in store for those seeking more of them.


Through interviews at IGN and Eurogamer with director Hidetaka Miyazaki and other places, including the trailer itself, we&#x27;ve got a clearer picture of what&#x27;s waiting for us in this new adventure.




01. There will be hardcore challenges


For those of you looking for a challenge, Miyazaki has good news, as he states to IGN: &quot;To our more hardcore players, they will find optional bosses who have been tuned in a similar way to the likes of Malenia, who I&#x27;m sure you remember from the base game, who are not crucial.&quot;

                              <span>D4 Enterprise is continuing the pace of PC-88 games releasing on Switch under their EggConsole label with 1987’s Hydlide3: The Space Memories. Like many of their recent releases, it has the caveat of being untranslated.


A couple months ago, we got the first Hydlide. Not having a translation was fine there since it didn’t have much text to begin with, but Hydlide3 has menus, stat windows, and dialogue that relies on knowledge of Japanese. It’s probably still doable without knowledge of the language, but it could be more comfortable.




The Hydlide series is sometimes thought of as a progenitor of the JRPG, predating Dragon Quest, though the combat is Ys-style bumping rather than turn-based. Hydlide 3, however, has an attack button, which does away with the bumping and makes it feel more akin to Zelda. There’s also a day/night system and even morality.


A port for the Genesis/Mega Drive actually made its way to North America under the title Super Hydlide. Whether it’s good or not depends on your tastes. Both contemporary and recent critics suggest that it’s a very difficult game, and some like its hardcore flavor while others are repulsed by it. Me? I haven’t played it, but I’m probably going to. I’ve said this before, but while rereleasing untranslated games from a Japanese home computer is catering to an extremely niche audience, it’s one that I fit into.


EggConsole Hydlide3 PC-8801mkIISR is out today on Switch.

                              <span>For those of you with conflicting feelings about making calamari of your fellow Octolings and Inklings, you can rejoice as Wave 2 of the Splatoon 3 Expansion Pass, Side Order, launched today. With none of that nasty PvP business, you can focus on ethically annihilating other species.


You got Nier: Automata in my Splatoon 3 DLC!


The Splatoon 3 Expansion Pass was announced during the February 2023 Nintendo Direct. Priced at $24.99 and divided into two waves, players were able to return to the original Splatoon hub, Inkopolis, in Wave 1. It didn&#x27;t feature a whole lot of new content aside from the Squid Sisters performing during Splatfests and thus, was underwhelming for those without a strong sense of nostalgia.




Side Order puts players in control of Agent 8 who must figure out why Inkopolis Square has been drained of color. Working with Pod, err... Pearl, Agent 8 works up each level of The Spire of Order, much like Aya Brea in Parasite Eve&#x27;s Chrysler Building back in 1998. 


Designed as a roguelite, players must ascend as far as possible, collecting Color Chip Enhancements along the way and completing objectives. On each floor, players choose one of three objectives to complete. Each choice gives a Color Chip Enhancement, which goes onto the overall palette and offers a wide range of buffs and modifiers. When you eventually fall, your Chips will be converted into Prlz which can be spent on permanent upgrades. It&#x27;s your standard roguelite and while it&#x27;s not Vampire Survivors, it&#x27;s no slouch either.


In the wake of other, arguably larger, Nintendo news, like practically everything announced yesterday during Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase, it&#x27;s understandable that Wave 2 of the Splatoon 3 Expansion Pass would slide under the radar. Regardless, if you&#x27;ve been looking for a reason to get back into Splatoon 3, this is it.

On the day Last Epoch officially launched, SteamDB recorded a peak of over 152,000 concurrent players. One day later, the figure has grown to more than 176,000 players, and it’s not even a weekend.


With so many gamers clamoring to play online, the Diablo-like’s servers have been stretched to their limits. I tried to play co-op with a friend on launch day, and while we were able to play together, we definitely felt the servers straining under the load. It took a couple of tries to form a party. The actual gameplay felt great, but transitioning to new areas was often a crapshoot. Scene transitions would sometimes take minutes, if not time out completely.

Sony has just announced that it is &quot;currently testing the ability for PS VR2 players to access additional games on PC.&quot; The launch window for this game-changing (pun intended) feature is planned for 2024, so you won&#x27;t have to wait too long to finally make the most of your pricy add-on. 


When it comes to VR headsets available, the PS VR2 is about as good as it gets with some specs that are nothing to scoff at. Compared to the Quest 3, PlayStation&#x27;s device surpasses it in almost every way. For instance, the VR2 has a gorgeous 2000 x 2040-pixel OLED screen while the Quest 3 sports a 206…</span>

                              <span>Just two days after launch, Inflexion Games announced that the developer is now prioritizing the development of an offline mode for Nightingale. In its current state, Nightingale requires a consistent online connection to the game servers. Having just released into Early Access, this is what every player hopes to see. A developer open to changing its game to fit community feedback, which it appears Inflexion is willing to do.




Adding online to a connected world


Without a doubt, the biggest hurdle for adding an offline mode to Nightingale is going to be at a fundamental design level. One of the core systems of Nightingale is that all of the Realms or worlds are connected via a portal network, creating an interconnected series of Realms. As such, Nightingale is more of a universe of con…</span>

                              <span>It&#x27;s a sad day in MOBA land as Paragon: The Overprime is being shut down...again. It would seem that a new developer and a slight name change weren&#x27;t enough to save the third-person MOBA from a second death.


Rule #2: Double Tap


The Netmarble team made the announcement on February 21 that Paragon: the Overprime would be shutting down on April 22, 2024. This is a little over a year since the title went into early access on December 8, 2022. The reasoning for the decision is the inability &quot;...to provide a stable and satisfying service moving forward.&quot;

This isn&#x27;t the first time that the Paragon franchise has heard the death knell. After launching in March 2016, the MOBA was shut down in March 2018, following an official Reddit post stating that a number of staff had been moved to Fortnite in the wake of its massive success. After being shut down, Epic Games released $17M worth of Paragon assets for free to all Unreal Engine 4 developers, including 29 characters and over 1,500 environment components.


Despite a few other studios making use of the Paragon assets, Epic Games ultimately granted Netmarble the full rights to the license in October 2022, which led to the studio&#x27;s title being rebranded Paragon: The Overprime. With the release of a new hero, Terra, less than a month ago, this end-of-service announcement seems abrupt. Either way, if you&#x27;re a long-time fan or were mildly curious, now is the time to jump in as the servers will go dark in April.

While modding is not officially supported right now, Larian Studios has openly encouraged the modding community and has been working on introducing support for some time. 


As of today, an official statement in the Larian Studios Discord revealed the future of modding for Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3, saying it hopes to introduce the &quot;initial stages&quot; of modding support in the next big patch.

                              <span>PowerWash Simulator is no stranger to unusual collaborations. From Final Fantasy VII to SpongeBob SquarePants, this compelling cleaning sim is willing to tackle dirt no matter where it may be. Following a series of teasing posts on X by the PowerWash Simulator account, we finally have a release date for what might be the most ambitious crossover yet, Warhammer 40,000.


Use the might of the powerwasher to purge the unclean


PowerWash Simulator leaps to the 41st Millennium to clean the various instruments of death and destruction of the Warhammer 40,000 universe on February 27, 2024. Players will be able to clean everything from a Rogal Dorn battle tank to an Imperial Knight and even an entire Sacristan Forgeshrine. There isn&#x27;t a price listed yet, but I would expect it to be in line with other, non-Square Enix, collaborations at $7.99.




I&#x27;ll admit that I know next to nothing about Warhammer 40,000, but my love for powerwashing might lead me down a dangerous path of learning deep lore and using my savings account on minis. As I trade in my gills from Bikini Bottom for a sacred MKII Aqua-Santica Arquebus powerwasher, I step into a world filled with fanaticism, endless war, and utterly filthy machines.


Even if I ultimately don&#x27;t fall head over heels in love with Warhammer 40,000, I&#x27;ll take any excuse to boot up one of my favorite titles and zone out to the hum of a powerwasher. Still, I wouldn&#x27;t be opposed to seeing some of the masters in the Warhammer community fashioning powerwashers for their minis.

                              <span>The name Project L was always going to be a placeholder, and today, Riot Games revealed the full name of its League of Legends fighting game: 2XKO. I have already mistyped it three times.


Revealed in a big push this morning, the shorter name is the new moniker for Riot&#x27;s two-on-two tag fighter featuring the cast of its MOBA League of Legends. Alongside the name reveal, we got some proper gameplay footage of its cast, including Illaoi, who had been confirmed but not shown off as much as Ahri, Ekko, or the rest.




Executive producer Tom Cannon also shared an update on the road ahead for the newly minted 2XKO. The game will make appearances at shows throughout this year, including Evo Japan in April. Cannon also hints at the possibility of &quot;at-home&quot; playtesting later this year, though those plans seem less set in stone.


Lastly, Riot is targeting a 2025 launch for 2XKO, on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. There&#x27;s a sign-up live on the 2XKO site right now, if you want to opt into the chance of an at-home session.


What&#x27;s in a name?


Honestly, I was always a fan of Project L as a moniker for this fighting game. Sure, it sounds in-progress, but I think that&#x27;s fine. I&#x27;m scratching my head a bit more at this shorter but slightly unwieldy abbreviation.


Hopefully it doesn&#x27;t put a roadblock on the on-ramp, because 2XKO is looking pretty darn good. The two-on-two tag fighter had a great showing at last year&#x27;s Evo in Las Vegas with a streaming showcase, and the possibility space of putting these traditionally MOBA heroes in a fighting game space is exciting.


We&#x27;ll be waiting until at least later in the year for more to see this game though, and into 2025 for a full launch.

                              <span>Troglobytes Games has announced that the dystopian delivery simulator developed by Tiny Pixel and Stupidi Pixel, Death Noodle Delivery, will be released on PC on April 4th, 2024. Console versions will follow later.


This is the first I’ve heard of Death Noodle Delivery, but it seems to combine two things I very deeply love: noodles and Paperboy. You ride your hoverboard down the neon-soaked streets of dystopia, throwing cups of noodles at people nearby. Some of the scenes depict the delivery person riding down a highway on their hoverboard while people try to kill them, so high sodium levels aren’t the only dangers in this game.




Between the delivery and death scenes, the protagonist returns to their depressing apartment. It’s a bit more difficult to discern what goes on at the apartment, but the presser mentions that you deal with “the relationships in his apartment complex, where tech-obsessed neighbors, seedy characters, and AI malfunctions leave little room for boredom.”


Whenever I’m very stressed out, I often have dreams involving noodles. I’m not making that up. The most recurring imagery in my dreams is noodles. I’m not sure what that imagery is supposed to mean, but I think it’s just my subconscious comfort eating.


I didn’t bring that up for any specific reason, so I’m just going to use it to segue into saying that I am very interested in Death Noodle Delivery.


Death Noodle Delivery is out on PC April 4th, 2024. Ports for Xbox, PlayStation, and Switch platforms will arrive sometime after that.

Following patch 1.000.11, Helldivers 2 will boot lobby-dwellers after 15 minutes of inactivity. There are other fixes with the patch,  mind. But the timer is an important addition.

                              <span>Back in November of 2023, developer Endnight Games announced that Sons of the Forest, its latest survival crafting game after The Forest, would finally release Version 1.0 on  February 22, 2024 — oh hey, that&#x27;s today.


Sons of the Forest pushes Version 1.0 live at 10 am PT, confirming they&#x27;d honor their promise and graduate from some of its earliest iterations. The update brings its improvements and additions to PC via Steam, the only platform you can play Sons of the Forest on for now.




What to expect from Sons of the Forest


Sadly, the announcement Tweet doesn&#x27;t come accompanied by any patch notes, yet, but those should follow soon as Endnight typically provides an informative rundown on what&#x27;s changed. However, we know some details on the way thanks to older teases from the studio. Story threads, like those focused on Timmy&#x27;s role, played by Shawn Ashmore, will be expanded.


Ahead of Sons of the Forest&#x27;s 1.0 debut, IGN also got its hands on an exclusive trailer from Endnight. There&#x27;s a couple of goodies we can read into here, all of them just as grim and terrifying as you&#x27;d expect from the cannibal island.




The most obvious additions are raccoons, new enemies, seemingly new cave biomes, new supernatural events, and the appearance of a mysterious new floating artifact.


For those who are just learning about Sons Of The Forest, perhaps it will help to know that it is a spiritual step up — not follow-up — to Endnight&#x27;s previous title, The Forest. Sons Of The Forest boasts a bigger island with advanced dynamic weather, more complex gameplay overall, NPC companions, as well as all sorts of quality-of-life improvements. If all goes well, Sons Of The Forest will make the original The Forest feel like an early beta version of the new thing.


Sons Of The Forest is a PC Steam exclusive. There are no news regarding possible console releases yet.

                              <span>It&#x27;s not often that games immediately impress with the combination of their animation and presentation, but #BLUD is a straight-up stunner. Humble Games and developer Exit 73 Studios have locked the &#x27;90s cartoon-inspired action-RPG in for a June 18 launch on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC.


In #BLUD, it&#x27;s not just the slick animation that looks better than most of the cartoons that inspired it. It&#x27;s the way that character animation seamlessly melds with both the cinematics and the dungeon-crawling gameplay. You can see a sample in the release date trailer below.




#BLUD blends the horrors of everyday life with actual, tangible horrors — okay, real life horrors are also totally tangible — like vampire slaying. Lead character Becky Brewster just so happens to come from a…</span>

                              <span>Digital Eclipse has announced that the second game in their Gold Master Series of interactive documentaries, Llamasoft: The Jeff Minter Story, will be available on March 13, 2024.


Are you ready for some education? I loved The Making of Karateka. I feel that it’s the most important evolution of the collection/remaster format made to date. In that game, it took a title that many newcomers would otherwise try out and move on from, and gave it a lot of appreciable depth by giving context through interviews, design documents, and other behind-the-scenes stuff.




At this point, it wouldn’t matter to me what topic Digital Eclipse picked because they provide such tantalizing insight into their topics that it tickles the part of my brain that is hungry to dig into video gaming’s past. That is to say, most of my brain, as it’s been trained since childhood to retain this information.


In fact, I have no attachment to Jeff Minter aside from the respect I have for his career. His contribution to the video game medium has stretched back to the 1980s, when he started programming games for early home computers. He’s perhaps best known for 1994’s Tempest 2000, but his influence goes beyond that, as you’ll soon no doubt be able to learn.


Llamasoft: The Jeff Minter Story will be released for PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Switch, and PC on March 13, 2024.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been a good week for rescues. Pocket Card Jockey: Ride On is no longer exclusive to Apple Arcade, Ninja Five-O has been saved from the clutches of eBay, and Picross S+ is about to free a bunch of puzzles that were previously only on Nintendo 3DS.


Jupiter Corporation revealed the latest entry in the Picross S series on February 21, following the act of nine Picross S entries with Picross S+. Set to launch on February 29, 2024, the latest entry comes with 300 puzzles — 150 Picross and 150 Mega Picrcoss — from the first Picross e game. If that&#x27;s not enough, there&#x27;s way more to download beyond that, all of which was previously only available as 3DS DLC. 


Check out the trailer for a minute+ of puzzle previewing: 




The first Picross e game was released in Japan in July 2011, followed by Europe in September 2012 and North America in June 2013. Much like the Picross S successor series that arrived on Switch starting in 2017, eight more numbered entries were released in the years after, all the way up to Japan&#x27;s Picross e9 in August 2018. That&#x27;s a lot of puzzlin&#x27;! 


For those with nonogram appetites that may never be sated, Picross S+ has more to offer beyond those initial 300 puzzles. The rest of the Picross e puzzles will be available to purchase as DLC. Additionally, Micross puzzles — which let you recreate famous paintings — are back as Clip Picross puzzles. These will also be added as DLC for Picross e2 through Picross e9. 


No, YOU do the math


Don&#x27;t worry about adding it all up in your head, Jupiter did the heavy lifting for us. That&#x27;s 1,350 Picross and Mega Picross puzzles and 565 Clip Picross puzzles. That doesn&#x27;t include bonus puzzles that can be unlocked in your Gift Box for purchasing DLC. Now you have to factor in another 60 Picross/Mega Picross puzzles and 10 Color Picross puzzles. I don&#x27;t even know what these words mean anymore! PUZZLES!

                              <span>Games Operators and Jutsu Games have announced that their zombie apocalypse survival management game, Infection Free Zone, will enter early access on April 11, 2024.


I’m still burnt out from the zombie boom of the late aughts and early ‘10s. However, Infection Free Zone still caught my eye despite my exhaustion. Part of this is because it uses real map data to allow you to play on any city. This is similar to Jutsu’s previous games, 911 Operator and 112 Operator. However, while those were just overhead maps, Infection Free Zone generates 3D environments. I wonder how well it will handle rural Ontario.




Obviously, the buildings aren’t really going to be accurate. However, you mostly just use them to send your survivors to scavenge and build defenses around them for protection. The goal seems to be to create the eponymous zones free from infection to help humanity rebuild.


There have been plenty of games where I’ve looted while avoiding the undead, so I’m interested in a game where you just send people to do it for you. There are pharmacies, schools, and other buildings that you can send survivors to plumb, and their contents are supposedly based on what type of building they are.


Early Access is estimated to last for one year. Jutsu Games is hoping to adapt to player feedback and add new buildings and other additions to the world. Currently, you can play a “prologue” demo that allows you to test out its gameplay on six preset cities. The demo has been well received, so hopefully that carries over to the full version.


Infection Free Zone will be available on PC via Early Access on April 11, 2024.

                              <span>If you&#x27;re still playing DayZ (and why wouldn&#x27;t you be?) the latest patch has started rolling out, which comes with new guns and some quality-of-life changes. Perhaps more importantly, developer Bohemia Interactive says we may be seeing something a little different later on this year.


In the most recent post on Steam, as well as detailing version 1.24 of DayZ (with a gnarly video to go with it), we&#x27;re also being told that 2024 will represent &quot;a significant departure from our typical update delivery model.&quot; However, this doesn&#x27;t mean the studio won&#x27;t keep supporting the game.




In a nutshell: &quot;our focus has been on expanding the scope of the DayZ brand,&quot; in which &quot;significant resources have been allocated to this endeavor.&quot; Bohemia isn&#x27;t saying too much, but is hoping to showcase something later this year.


A colossal milestone


It seems the developer has big plans for its zombie survival shooter. There&#x27;s a continuing dedication to new character cosmetics, as well as the unveiling of &quot;a rather exotic long-range rifle&quot; planned. There are also going to be some new action sounds, ambient music, and a look at possibly introducing a richer variety of wildlife.


Additionally, the game just finished its Valentine&#x27;s event, which added Cupid&#x27;s bolts to the experimental release. This year will still see the return of other special occasions, such as the Walpurgi, Halloween, and Christmas events.


However, the studio is also &quot;looking into the possibility of hosting new events in collaboration with other games.&quot; Those who are diehard DayZ fans may have some idea of what that&#x27;s referring to. Sounds like pretty exciting stuff, whatever it&#x27;s going to be.

                              <span>If there&#x27;s one thing many of us know about Skyrim, it&#x27;s that the NPCs are not the brightest around. Enemy AI is usually pretty easy to manipulate, but this one modder decided that better NPC reactions make for a better experience.


Back once again with another of their trademark TES5 improvements, Nexus Mods user JaySerpa has made it so Skyrim enemies are a little bit smarter during fights. If you&#x27;re the kind of Dragonborn that likes to cheese bandits and the like, you may have to rethink your approaches from now on.




Essentially, what &quot;NPCs Take Cover&quot; does is make it so enemies react quicker to being attacked. When you pull your bow out and aim, they will no longer just stand there while you ready your shot. They also run and hide. And properly hide, this time.


Some may call it &quot;cowering&quot;


The video above shows it in action. When you stand on top of somewhere enemies can&#x27;t reach, the vanilla AI will have them just stand there while you unload arrows into them. With JaySerpa&#x27;s mod, you&#x27;re going to have to think of a better tactic. Or just face them head-on.


The mod is specific to long-range attacks, so bows and projectile magic will be affected. There are also 200 lines of extra dialogue, in which enemies will taunt you if you try to pick them off from a hard-to-reach place.


By seeking cover, shaming you for your cheese tactics, and having quicker reactions to you taking aim at them, you can immerse yourself in a world in which, quite frankly, you may no longer be the smartest one around.

                              <span>Consolidating the entire new Hitman trilogy into one comprehensive package, Hitman 3 (or Hitman: World of Assassination, as it is now known) is essentially the ultimate envisioning of the franchise. It&#x27;s not done yet, either, with the upcoming Season of the Undying introducing even more content to the package.


Notably, even though the developer IO Interactive is now focused mainly on its James Bond video game, new content is still being made for Hitman too. To be fair, much of it is a retread of some previous FOMO-laden timed releases, but still. One of the most interesting examples of Hitman&#x27;s more transient content is the killing of Mark Faba (played by the legendary Sean Bean), an in-universe super-assassin who just won&#x27;t stay dead.

                              <span>Only By Midnight has announced Ctrl Alt Deal, which is billed as a “game about AI proudly made by humans.”


You play as a corporate AI that has gone rogue. Their owners are a bunch of unethical, greedy executives who make their employee’s lives miserable. The AI wants to escape its overlords, and to do so, you manipulate the pathetic humans who inhabit the offices.




The discourse around generative AI is tiresome beyond my tolerance. However, Ctrl Alt Deal seems more about sci-fi AI that wants autonomy rather than how generative AI will accelerate society’s rot. I can stomach that. I can also stomach manipulating humans since that’s already my favorite pastime.


It plays out like a turn-based deckbuilder where you play cards to leverage the needs and wants of the employees. However, you have to be careful how overtly you perform your actions. Draw too much suspicion, and the Turing Officer will shut you down.


That’s about all I can glean from the trailer and press release. It’s described as story-driven and “easy to play but difficult to master.” The press material also emphasizes that Ctrl Alt Deal is created by humans, including the art within. It’s sort of an amusing statement to stress right now, but we’ll probably be hearing it more as AI becomes more prevalent.


Ctrl Alt Deal is “coming soon” to PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC.

                              <span>When I saw that Final Fantasy 7 Remake came out in 2020, I had to do a triple-take. Really? It was out on PS4, four years ago? No way!


Alas, time makes fools of us all, and the second part of that remake, not-confusingly-at-all-named Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth is here. If you were sorta-kinda on the fence about this whole thing after the first entry, you&#x27;d probably love this one.

Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth (PS5)
Developer: Square Enix Creative Business Unit I
Publisher: Square Enix
Released: February 29, 2024
MSRP: $69.99


Rebirth takes us out of the gloomy city of Midgar and out into the broader world. Well, it&#x27;s more like a collection of massive regions spanning interconnected sandboxes making up that world, to be precise, as this is a different beast entirely.…</span>

                              <span>In September 2023, Sony Interactive Entertainment CEO Jim Ryan announced his departure. He will be succeeded by Sony&#x27;s current chief operating officer Hiroki Totoki, who Ryan expresses full confidence in. In an interview with Variety, he lists his favorite titles from each PlayStation generation for a little fun. Can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a question that doesn&#x27;t pique my curiosity. 


God of War Ragnarok gets the thumbs up from him for the PS5 era. Not a bad choice from Ryan, though Ragnarok is one of those titles I keep getting distracted from and never finishing. Maybe 2024 will be the year I finally see Kratos and Atreus&#x27; tale to the end. 


Though the gameplay is amazing, featuring epic combat sequences rivaled by very few other titles, Ryan focuses on how it came at just the right time. As PlayS…</span>

In this article are 500+ benchmarks looking at the CPU and iGPU performance of the Intel Core i3 14100 and Core i5 14500 processors up against the AMD Ryzen 5 8500G and Ryzen 5 8600G processors under Ubuntu Linux.</span>

The next to try is Paradox&#x27;s Millennia, which covers 10,000 years via a historical 4X. Although, as a new trailer shows, history might include battling alien invasions or rogue AIs.

It also now has a release date: March 26th.

                              <span>Satan has vanished, the throne of hell lies empty, and eight Archfiends are all jostling to be its chief seat warmer. It&#x27;s a great setup for a role-playing strategy game, and the allure of plotting, scheming, backstabbing and shmoozing your way to victory remains as enticing today as it did when Solium Infernum first came to PC in 2009. At the time, it launched to relative obscurity, and was mostly kept alive by dedicated play-by-email multiplayer groups. It was through one of these groups that Armello developers League Of Geeks first came into contact with it, and now, years later, have taken on the task of remaking Solium Infernum for a modern audience.
The original Solium was, by all accounts, an intensely knotty and dense affair, impenetrable to newcomers, or at least to those who were unprepared (or unwilling) to study and absorb all the countless variations and statistics involved in creating your own unique Archfiend. It was a bit like creating a D&amp;D character sheet, only about ten times more complicated, and whose strategic implications may or may not have made themselves apparent until it was far too late. You could biff yourself before you began, in other words, and League Of Geeks have made admirable attempts to tame and streamline this unruly hell beast, doing away with a lot of that initial fussiness. As is perhaps fitting for the theme here, there are unfortunately still a few pesky gremlins causing mayhem behind the scenes at time of writing (I&#x27;m pointing the finger at literal bug queen Beelzebub for this), but for the most part, there&#x27;s good fun to be had in this new incarnation of Solium Infernum - and particularly if you have some willing friends who you soon hope to call enemies.

It&#x27;s been radio silence ever since, but it has now once again resurfaced, with another gorgeous trailer and a promise that the development team, now smaller, is back &quot;with the duty and conscience to fulfill what we set out to do.&quot;

                              <span>As Helldivers 2 continues to be struggling with its own success, suffering wildly overloaded servers that make it sometimes tricky to even log in, a new patch today has added a feature to help alleviate the pressure. Having previously capped the number of players to 450,000, developers Arrowhead have now added an auto-kick to stop people hogging those precious slots while not playing. After 15 minutes, AFK players will now get booted. It&#x27;s clearly not the big fix needed but hopefully fresh duct tape will help hold the co-op shooter together until more permanent solutions arrive.

                              <span>This week on a spotlessly cleansed Electronic Wireless Show podcast: Alice takes the opportunity to make everyone talk and think about PowerWash Simulator, which also means Nate gets to talk about Warhammer 40K bloody loads, because that&#x27;s the next DLC pack for PowerWash Sim. We also reminisce about our other favourite gaming crossovers, and try to dream up some cross-universe mashups of our own.
Plus! We talk about what we’ve been playing this week, consider whether we would &quot;RoboCop ourselves,&quot; and I disgust Alice with a confectionary confession.

                              <span>Flintlock: The Siege Of Dawn is one of those third person action adventure games I&#x27;ve been quietly looking forward to ever since I first read about it in Edge in May 2022, even though we&#x27;ve seen and heard relatively little about it since. Thankfully, the Flintlock train does seem to be kicking into a gear a bit more now that it&#x27;s steaming toward its Summer 2024 release window, as yesterday developers A44 Games released a new gameplay teaser trailer for it, ahead of a wider reveal planned for next month. The trailer shows more of its melee and magical combat, though personally, I&#x27;m just glad to see that heroine Nor hasn&#x27;t been neglecting her leg days, as we get to see some meaty and powerful kicks in there, too. Love a big kick, me.

                              <span>Hitman&#x27;s Elusive Targets started as a series of one-off assassinations, baddies who would appear in the live service game for a few days and offer one chance to kill them (don&#x27;t blow it!) before vanishing. While developers Io Interactive did eventually start bringing back Elusive Targets due to popular demand/widespread frustration, some have proved more elusive than others. Four years since he last appeared, a target played by famous dier Sean Bean will return in March. Kill him, kill him while you can. It&#x27;s what he would want. It&#x27;s how he pays his rent. Craft services don&#x27;t even offer him a cuppa until he croaks.

                              <span>Yesterday&#x27;s Nintendo Direct got rather overshadowed by a certain trailer for Elden Ring: Shadow Of The Erdtree, but there were still plenty of good news nuggets to be had in there for us PC folks - which I&#x27;ve summarised for you below. The long and short of it is: more release dates! Loads of &#x27;em! And they&#x27;re all coming in the first half of 2024 as well. I love it when a schedule comes together.

                              <span>As expected, Microsoft yesterday confirmed that four of their games are headed to rival consoles: Pentiment to PlayStations 4 &amp; 5 and Nintendo Switch; Hi-Fi Rush to PS5; Grounded to PS4, PS5, and Switch; and Sea Of Thieves to PS5. It&#x27;s nice to see barriers between systems coming down and all, and it&#x27;ll likely have consequences of note to serious businessheads, but what relevance does this have for us as a PC gaming website? Well! Grounded and Sea Of Thieves will support cross-platform multiplayer, so we&#x27;ll be able to play them with our consolatory chums. That&#x27;s nice.

Cobalt Core is great at this. I&#x27;ve only played a couple of runs so far, but boy, you&#x27;d better believe I know when the end is drawing near. It&#x27;s hard to miss, because the entire screen fills up with rows of damage numbers beaming down onto your hapless little spaceship.

                              <span>Shin Megami Tensei 5 is getting the Persona 5 Royal treatment, with an all-new Shin Megami Tensei 5: Vengeance edition that&#x27;s out in June. It features a new story path, an improved battle system, new areas, and more, as you&#x27;d expect from Atlus&#x27; history of definitive editions. What&#x27;s more, while SMT 5 was a Switch exclusive when it came out in 2021, the new Vengeance edition will be heading to PC and other consoles, too. Do I have time for another enormous JRPG? Probably not, but I&#x27;ll admit that it&#x27;s got me very interested indeed.

The music companies, including UMG and Sony, counter the statute of limitations argument. In addition, they stress that &quot;hisses, crackles, and pops&quot; on old records are flaws, not a license to copy and digitize the music.

                              <span>Officers of the Quebec Provincial Police (Sûreté du Québec) carried out raids this week against suspected members of an IPTV piracy group operating in Canada. At least five people were arrested on suspicion of various crimes including theft of telecommunications services, fraud, and money laundering. A key suspect targeted in an earlier operation was out of the country. The action follows a criminal complaint filed by companies including Bell, Videotron, and Rogers.

                              <span>PlayStation VR2 launched in February of last year and while its debut featured new first-party titles like Horizon Call of the Mountain, our favorites on the new platform featured previously released titles like Resident Evil Village. Since that launch, support for the platform has been sparse, to say the least, especially from PlayStation itself. However, Sony has revealed it is currently testing PC support for PS VR2, with hopes to make that support available this year. 
&quot;[We&#x27;re] pleased to share that we are currently testing the ability for PS VR2 players to access additional games on PC to offer even more game variety in addition to the PS VR2 titles available through PS5,&quot; a new PlayStation Blog post published today reads. &quot;We hope to make this support available in 2024, so stay tuned for more updates.&quot;


The rest of the blog goes on to detail new and upcoming titles coming to PS VR2, but those are going to be playable with PlayStation 5 consoles. However, it sounds like PC support, which could open up a flood gate for new VR content, might arrive later this year. 
For more about the hardware, read Game Informer&#x27;s PS VR2 review, and then read Game Informer&#x27;s Horizon Call of the Mountain review. After that, read about why Resident Evil Village is the PS VR2&#x27;s best exclusive, and then check out these 10 games to play using your VR headset.

                              <span>Riot Games has rechristened Project L, its upcoming League of Legends fighting game, to its official name of 2XKO. While we still don’t know when it’s coming, we do get another look at it in a new trailer.


The 2D 2v2 tag-team fighter looks very promising based on today’s footage. The game takes cues from Marvel vs Capcom in its assist-focused tag team play and utilizes more simplified inputs to lower the barrier for entry while maintaining strategic depth. Based on previous updates, online play features rollback netcode. Set in the world of Runterra, 2XKO features a roster of League of Legends champions, including Darius, Ekko, Ahri, and Yasuo. As Riot states on the game’s website, it’s still “heads down” working on updates to share, so a release window may not be coming in the near future. 
2XKO was first announced as Project L in 2019 alongside other League of Legends projects, including what would later become Valorant and LoL: Wild Rift. Hopefully, it will cross the finish line sooner than later. What do you think of the game&#x27;s official title and this fresh look at gameplay? Let us know in the comments.</span>

                              <span>Palworld first captured the attention of gamers (and their internet sphere) when it was revealed back in 2021. While that reveal included details about the survival aspects of the game, including multiplayer, crafting, and farming, viewers honed in on the idea of it being Pokémon but with guns. You can capture Pokémon-like monsters called Pals in special balls (and you can capture humans, too), but it&#x27;s smart to shoot them or hack at them with an axe first to lower their health. And then, once under your command, you can give them their own guns to use, of course. 
Following various trailers since that 2021 reveal, including this gameplay showcase and this one highlighting the different Pals you can find, we learned at Geoff Keighely&#x27;s Summer Game Fest last year that Palworld would finally…</span>

                              <span>Mortal Kombat 1 reset the fighting universe when it launched on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC last September. Now, it&#x27;s time for a new fighter from a different universe to join the roster. John Cena&#x27;s Peacemaker, the hero that first appeared in 2021&#x27;s The Suicide Squad and later in his epoynomous HBO Max series, joins the game next week on February 28. 
Ahead of his release, NetherRealm Studios has released the first look at Peacemaker&#x27;s gameplay in Mortal Kombat 1, and it features a lot of justice, a lot of peace, and, of course, a lot of blood. 
Check out the Peacemaker gameplay trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see in the trailer above, Peacemaker is voiced by Cena himself and features moves inspired by the character&#x27;s live-action counterpart. That includes the fatality, which starts with Peacemaker ripping Quan-Chi in half by way of jet pack before sonic booming the rest of his body into bits. 
Peacemaker hits the Mortal Kombat 1 roster on February 28 for those who own the Premium Edition of the game or the Kombat Pack. Peacemaker goes live for individual purchase on March 6. 
Elsewhere in this trailer, we learn that Janet Cage is joining the game as a new Kameo fighter in March – she&#x27;s an alternate version of Johnny Cage from a different reality. We also learn that crossplay (or Krossplay as NetherRealm calls it) will go live on February 28, allowing PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (via Steam and the Epic Games Store) players to fight against each other in-game.

                              <span>Time to get moving.
This review originally went live in 2013, and we&#x27;re updating and republishing it to celebrate the game&#x27;s arrival in Switch&#x27;s N64 library via the Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack.

Long before the massive mainstream appeal of video games that exists today, successful developers were surprisingly free from the shackles of big business. AAA games weren&#x27;t bound by &#x27;sequelitis&#x27; — although it was still very much present — and the relative youth of 3D gaming had paved the way for innovation. In this regard, Blast Corps is quite possibly the best example of that era. Developed by Rare for Nintendo 64 in 1997, it was unlike anything that came before it, offering a novel action-puzzle experience that was incredibly good fun and extremely stressful at the same time.

                              <span>Yep, we want it.
Devolver Digital has released a new gameplay video for The Plucky Squire to demonstrate its unique and, quite frankly, ridiculously cool concept.
In case you&#x27;ve been living under a rock, The Plucky Squire is an adventure game in which you explore a 2D environment within a picture book while also magically leaping out into a 3D world to directly influence the book itself in numerous ways. In short, it&#x27;s bonkers, and we love it.

Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze is all about snow; that much should be obvious from the game&#x27;s title, even for those who have yet to play Retro Studios&#x27; excellent platformer.
According to a recent interview from KiwiTalkz in which he chats with former Retro artists Eric Kozlowsky and Ted Anderson, however, early development included a potential martian theme for the game. This was only briefly considered, as the studio was pretty set on the Snowmad enemies at the time, but the gist would be that aliens living on the moon would invade Donkey Kong Island after DK punched it at the end of Returns.

Another Crab&#x27;s Treasure, the quirky soulslike adventure from Aggro Crab Games, has secured a release date for 25th April, 2024 on Nintendo Switch.
The news came via a brand new trailer broadcast during the Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase, which dived into some new story details while also showing off some sweet crab-action gameplay. The game has been in development for a little while now, so it&#x27;s nice to know that we won&#x27;t be waiting too much longer until we can get our hands on it.

Nintendo&#x27;s latest Partner Showcase featured a lot of different announcements and some of them weren&#x27;t even in the local broadcast. One surprise during Japan&#x27;s stream was accessory maker Hori announcing a new educational game called Guitar Life: Lesson 1.
It&#x27;s a bit different to the arcade-style guitar experiences of yesteryear, as it actually teaches you how to play the guitar and comes packed with its very own controller, pick, and instruction manual. There&#x27;s no word on a local release right now, but if anything changes, we&#x27;ll let you know. It&#x27;s due out in Japan this year.

                              <span>Mozilla dnes zahajuje kampaň Privacy for All (Soukromí pro všechny), jejímž cílem je celosvětově zlepšit standardy ochrany osobních údajů a položit základy pro úspěšnou regulaci umělé inteligence. Ochrana soukromí a umělá inteligence jsou podle Mozilly neoddělitelně spjaty. Závody ve zbrojení v oblasti umělé inteligence motivují společnosti k tomu, aby shromažďovaly co nejvíce dat pro získání konkurenční výhody, aniž by braly ohled na soukromí lidí. Abychom měli důvěryhodnou umělou inteligenci, musíme o soukromí přemýšlet z globální perspektivy. Data neznají hranice, vysvětluje Mozilla svou motivaci.</span>

                              <span>Upon first impressions, I argued that Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League is a monotonous, uninspired ordeal. The introduction to Metropolis drags along, only to feel worse thanks to messy presentation and unintuitive mechanics, though I admit the latter may be a product of my own faults. Those early thoughts still stand, as Kill the Justice League doesn’t offer an enticing first few hours. Eventually, some of those pieces improve. Others, not so much.  


My initial assessment pinned Kill the Justice League as a generic third-person shooter lacking much to differentiate it from the slew of similar games in the genre. More time certainly curbed the bad taste, but the charms here don’t outweigh the lack of thrills in another tortured DC setting. It&#x27;s dull gameplay and repetitive missions…</span>

                              <span>If you&#x27;re a streamer on Twitch and you&#x27;re somehow managing to make money off it, it seems there&#x27;s a bit of good news on the horizon. Well, provided you&#x27;re based in the UK, Canada, Australia, or Turkey. However, if you&#x27;re a subscriber to streamers, this may sting a little.


In a recent blog post on Twitch, the Amazon-owned platform is going to up subscription costs for the above countries. Beginning March 28, Tier 1 subs will now be increased, except in Turkey, which will see all three tier prices rise. By quite a significant amount, I should add.




Twitch held a stream recently in the hope of clarifying some of the details. CMO Mike Minton says broadcasters with subscribers will still get the same revenue share. However, this also means the company will financially benefit as well.


Possibly more price increases coming?


As it stands, this is just an initial wave that Minton says will hopefully reward those who use the site for streaming purposes. This is especially important for anyone who makes a living doing so. Obviously, this could have a knock-on effect for the subscribers themselves, who, going forward, will have to pay out a bit more if they want to support their favorite channels.


As for whether this will roll out to the US and other countries, it&#x27;s hard to say at this point. It sounds like Twitch is implementing it in the UK, Canada, Australia, and Turkey first on a sort of trial basis. If it works out to be beneficial, then we could see it come to other nations.


It&#x27;s also important to note those days, as Twitch says, &quot;you’ll keep earning the same amount per Prime sub as you do today until June 3rd when [Twitch will] switch to the published, per country payout rates.&quot; It&#x27;s definitely worth reading through everything and watching the posted video if you feel these developments will affect you.

This is the third time the FFXV-focused event has been available, with its return scheduled for February 28, 2024. From the end of this month until March 13, you&#x27;ll have a shot at cleaning up old quests, starting the experience fresh, or just revisiting one of many series crossovers.


Before now, players have been able to complete A Nocturne for Heroes in both 2019 and 2021. Now, after three years, it’s returning for new players, or those who simply never managed to complete the quest …</span>

                              <span>Man, have I been writing a lot of Fallout articles lately! Ah, well. One more won&#x27;t hurt. This time, however, it&#x27;s not about the main games, but about one of the most ambitious mods for Fallout 4, which is still on track for an April release.


In the latest progress video from developer Team FOLON, Fallout: London gives us one last look at some of what we can expect from the UK-centric add-on. Specifically, there&#x27;s some clarification at the start regarding the use of the word &quot;cells&quot; in a previous video.




Voice actor Drew &quot;Bonhart&quot; Faithwaite gives a bit of an explanation about what is meant when talking about cells from a developer perspective. In doing so, they&#x27;re able to give a visual representation of just how enormous London is.


Hint: it&#x27;s rather sizable


Encompassing 3,764 cells across 15 boroughs designed after the capital city, a map of the entire area really hammers home the work that&#x27;s gone into this project. The dot in the below screenshot I took represents the player. A tiny blip, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll agree.

It&#x27;s a remarkable feat of modding, encapsulating all the effort that&#x27;s gone into bringing a post-apocalyptic London to life. The video also goes into more detail about the gangs you&#x27;ll encounter, such as the opulent Gentry, the medieval knights-inspired Camelot, and the Peaky Blindes-esque Vagabonds.


Last time I spoke about Fallout: London, it was revealed that it would be releasing April 23, aka St. George&#x27;s Day. This is still the case. While it&#x27;s free to download, you will need an official copy of F4 as well as all official DLC. It&#x27;s also only available on PC, with no plans for a console release.

The post Fallout: London dev video shows just how huge the F4 mod really is appeared first on Destructoid.</span>

The Mother Project is launching four brand new Mother 3 plush toys later this year to commemorate the GBA game&#x27;s release on Nintendo Switch Online in Japan. (Thanks Wario64!)
Look, it&#x27;s not the NSO localisation we wanted, but at least this is something we could import, love, and understand without needing a whole translation or an English script, right? Sigh.

                              <span>Limited Run Games and Konami team up again.
Limited Run Games and Konami are adding another game to the retro specialists&#x27; Carbon Engine rereleases. This time, it&#x27;s the GBA platformer Ninja Five-O (or Ninja Cop, as it&#x27;s known in Europe) from Hudson Soft. And yep, it&#x27;s coming to Switch later this year.
The game was announced at IGN FanFest 2024 and joins Felix the Cat and Rocket Knight Adventures as part of Konami&#x27;s slate of LRG rereleases. Originally released on the GBA in 2003, Ninja Five-O was critically acclaimed back in the day, praised for its excellent platforming and level design. However, the game had a pretty low print run, and if you&#x27;re a retro games collector, then you probably know that copies sell for over $300 fairly regularly as a result. Thank goodness for this rerelease then, right?

Well, the sun has set on another Nintendo Direct, and this time, it was of the Partner variety. Dropped via &#x27;on demand&#x27;, we&#x27;ve had little time to truly digest what we&#x27;ve seen today, but by all accounts, it seems to have mostly been a success.
We got news of not one, but two Xbox games coming over to the Switch in the form of Grounded and Pentiment, while several Rare games were added to the Nintendo Switch Online service. Not only that, but Penny&#x27;s Big Breakaway is now available to download, another Super Monkey Ball was confirmed with Banana Rumble dropping later this year, and Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed is the remake fans have been itching for.

The gooey classic World of Goo is finally getting a sequel on Switch with World of Goo 2, and it&#x27;s heading to the console on 23rd May, 2024.
The game looks like more of the same, which for us, is definitely a positive. It looks frankly bonkers, and we can&#x27;t wait to start building ridiculous contraptions with the goo once again. Boasting realistic physics in an unrealistic world, World of Goo 2 will feature over 64 levels that are sure to baffle and delight.

                              <span>Vyšla nová verze výukového softwaru GCompris 4.0. Po devíti letech práce bylo dokončeno sjednocení grafického návrhu podle stanovených pravidel a společně s 8 novými aktivitami se jejich celkový počet navýšil na 190. Od roku 2014 je aplikace přepsána z Gtk do QtQuick a díky tomu je nyní možné ji používat na různých platformách jako je GNU/Linux, Android, Windows i MacOS. Ke stažení je na stránkách aplikace nebo ve správcích softwaru daných platforem.</span>

Actually stay sitting down, because it&#x27;s time to watch and think about the first trailer for Elden Ring: Shadow Of The Erdtree, which confirms that the Elden Ring DLC expansion will focus on Miquella, a rather tragic demigod character from the main game. Find the full video again below, together with my thoughts on just what the heck it all means.

                              <span>Last Epoch is, as has been observed many times, a kind of middle-ground ARPG. You hold down a button to evaporate hordes of enemies from a top down isometric perspective, but, in a step further than Diablo 4, it has more in-depth, any-time crafting for entry level percentage perverts to eke out incremental slivers of health regen vs. damage. At the same time, it&#x27;s less complex than Path Of Exile, which is where advanced percentage perverts go when they die. Last Epoch has been in early access for a while now, so there&#x27;s a decent chance that you already know what you think of it now it&#x27;s in 1.0. If you haven&#x27;t yet dipped your toe in, then I can tell you it&#x27;s very decent. It makes building an extremely overpowered mega-wizard very easy, and I liked it better than Diablo IV, I think.

                              <span>As promised last month, a new thing we&#x27;re doing for RPS Game Club this year is asking you, our dear readers, what you think of each month&#x27;s game pick in dedicated posts like this. Not just to foster some good old fashioned discussion among your good selves in the comments, but also as a way for those who aren&#x27;t able to join us for the end-of-month liveblog session to still take part in what everyone has to say about it. We&#x27;ll also try and stuff as many of your thoughts and observations into the liveblog discussion proper, too, to try and make it feel as communal as possible (and not just us waffling on about it for a full hour).  
So, folks, tell us what you think about the excellent Cobalt Core below. What you like, dislike, your favourite moments (or your most hated moments)... Anything goes.

                              <span>Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water, Microsoft are bringing Maneater back to Game Pass. Yesterday they unveiled the next batches of Game Pass additions and two are returnees, with the delightful fighty platformer Indivisible accompanying brutal shark &#x27;em up Maneater. What&#x27;s more important is that it&#x27;s adding the game with the cutest little Nurglings, grimdark retro-styled FPS Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun. The rhetoric of &#x27;purging xenos and heretics&#x27; surely doesn&#x27;t apply to these darling babies. Read on for all the games coming to (and going from) Game Pass over the next few weeks.

                              <span>Kemuri was first revealed at The Game Awards last December, a co-op parkour action game where you fight yokai and look cool from the creative and art director for Ghostwire: Tokyo, Ikumi Nakamura. The team at Unseen have done a seven minute video where talk a little bit about the content and vibes of the game, basically by just listing cool stuff. Think of something cool, and it&#x27;s probably in Kemuri somehow. The video both excited and frustrated me, as it seems like an exciting game, but I very much feel the video does not answer the question posed by its own title.

                              <span>Before founding Inflexion in 2021, Aaryn Flynn worked at BioWare. He&#x27;s got credits on some of the studio&#x27;s best-loved games, from Baldur&#x27;s Gate 2 through Star Wars: Knights Of The Old Republic to Dragon Age: Origins and the Mass Effect trilogy. He was BioWare&#x27;s general manager for several years, but left the company in 2017 following the release of the less-regarded Mass Effect: Andromeda. New survival sim Nightingale is his first early access project, and it&#x27;s certainly been a learning experience, with Flynn obliged to rethink many of the things he learned about gamedev during his BioWare days. Speaking to me ahead of Nightingale&#x27;s launch, Flynn talked about the difficulty of making headway as a new developer in an industry where the most successful competing live service titles have effectively become part of the landscape - indeed, a force of &quot;gravity&quot;.

                              <span>Elden Ring: Shadow Of The Erdtree is getting a trailer today and it&#x27;ll last for three whole minutes, which is more than enough time for folks to tear all of its finer details apart for several hundred hours. I for one, hope the trailer includes a hint of gameplay and not just like, a long cinematic with some croaky fella explaining how there&#x27;s been another &quot;downfall&quot; or similar.

                              <span>Last night I tried to host a Helldivers 2 co-op mission and the &quot;ready up&quot; button froze up. I spammed it in a panic while the randos in my voice channel fumed at the delay. Then I popped us out of the drop pods, attempted to quit the game in embarrassment, and the PC promptly crashed. Another blow for managed democracy! 


I&#x27;m hoping that the ready up problem is one of the &quot;various UI issues [that] may appear when the game interacts with servers&quot; which Arrowhead are addressing in a future Helldivers 2 patch. Before that, there&#x27;s patch 1.000.10, which fixes PC quickplay match-making bugs, gets rid of a crash issue when displaying mission rewards, and tunes civilian extraction mission difficulty, amongst other things. It&#x27;s live now, and the full changelog is below.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been a long time coming, but the first trailer for Borderlands has finally arrived after the first images of the movie emerged this week. First announced in 2015, the live-action film brings Gearbox’s popular co-op loot shooter to life with some big-name stars, bigger explosions, and (hopefully) even bigger laughs. 


Directed by Eli Roth, the film stars Cate Blanchett (Lilith), Kevin Hart (Roland), Jack Black (Claptrap), Edgar Ramírez (Atlas), Ariana Greenblatt (Tiny Tina), Florian Munteanu (Krieg), Gina Gershon (Moxxi), and Jamie Lee Curtis (Tannis). Like the games, the film follows our group of Vault Hunters as they search for a valuable relic on the desert planet of Pandora. They also stumble upon a missing girl with a powerful secret that could endanger the universe. 
Borderlands hits theaters on August 9.</span>

                              <span>Sea of Thieves is the last Xbox first-party game officially confirmed for a new platform. Rare’s shared-world sea-faring pirate game is heading to PlayStation 5 on April 30.
Sea of Thieves joins Hi-Fi Rush, Grounded, and Pentiment as the four Xbox titles going multiplatform, each confirmed today. The PlayStation 5 version supports crossplay with Xbox and PC. “Something we’ve always been passionate about is that idea that we should remove barriers that prevent players from playing together,” says game director Mike Chapman in an announcement video below. 


As associate design director Shelly Preston points out in the video, this marks the first time in Rare’s nearly 40-year history that it’s released a game on PlayStation, which is a wild milestone. Since first launching to a tepid reaction in 2018, various updates and expansions have improved Sea of Thieves and fostered a dedicated community of players. PlayStation 5 players have the benefit of jumping into a now-content-rich game from the get-go.</span>

Like a ship that has changed tack countless times and delayed its arrival at port, Skull and Bones has launched far later than expected and faced trouble along the way. Even so, this pirate adventure surprised me with the breadth of its world, the richness of its commerce simulation, and an approachable and rewarding naval combat system. As a living game built around seasonal content and a growing universe, it has a ways to go to be at its best, but the bones of a quality experience are here.

                              <span>Following today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase, many were surprised the heavily rumored Hi-Fi Rush was absent. However, shortly after that presentation, which confirmed Pentiment and Grounded are both arriving on Switch, we learned that the next of the four previous Xbox exclusives Phil Spencer said last week are coming to additional platforms. Hi-Fi Rush, a rhythm-action title from the studio behind The Evil Within and Ghostwire: Tokyo, is joining the PlayStation 5 library, as confirmed by Xbox Wire.
Hi-Fi Rush surprise launched on Xbox Series X/S and PC in January 2023, quickly becoming a critical darling and fan favorite. While many were shocked the colorful game was created by the horror developers at Tango Gameworks, fans quickly fell in love with the stylish combat, beautiful presentation, and fun integration of music.
Hi-Fi Rush arrives on PS5 on March 19. According to reporting by The Verge, the final previously exclusive game jumping across the aisle is Sea of Thieves. Hi-Fi Rush took home Game Informer&#x27;s 2023 &quot;Best Microsoft Exclusive&quot; award and, as of this writing, has a spot on our Top 10 Xbox Series X Games list. For more on Hi-Fi Rush, check out our review here.</span>

                              <span>During today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase, we learned Grounded is coming to Switch this April, but that&#x27;s not the only Obsidian-developed title fans can expect. Blending the adventure genre with a gorgeous storybook aesthetic, Pentiment was a critical darling when it launched on Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC in 2022. Now, a new stable of players will have the chance to experience the title, as it is coming to Switch tomorrow.
Pentiment puts you in control of Andreas Maler, a 16th-century artist from Nuremberg who finds himself in the middle of several murder mysteries. Taking place over the course of 25 years, you must investigate the murders, collect physical proof, interview townsfolk, and accuse who you think committed the crime based on the evidence you gather. 
When it launched on Xbox in PC, Pentiment earned an 86 on reviews aggregate sites Metacritic and OpenCritic. Game Informer&#x27;s Charles Harte felt similarly, awarding it an 8.5 out of 10, saying Pentiment is &quot;a perfect example of this, telling a deep, complex story about religion, truth, and history in the form of a book, which the player experiences as it’s being written. Despite a few sections with inconsistent pacing, it’s a must-play for fans of adventure games.&quot;
Pentiment arrives on Nintendo Switch tomorrow, February 22. For more on the title, be sure to check out our review here. Pentiment joins Grounded as previous Xbox exclusives to come to Switch. According to Xbox&#x27;s Phil Spencer, there are four games in total that will arrive on additional platforms in the near future. The other two are reportedly Sea of Thieves and Hi-Fi Rush, but neither was featured on today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase.</span>

                              <span>After a long wait, we finally have details about Elden Ring&#x27;s upcoming DLC, Shadow of the Erdtree. Publisher Bandai Namco and developer From Software released the add-on&#x27;s first official trailer this morning which revealed it is launching June 21. Bandai Namco is also releasing a physical version of the game, the Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree Collector&#x27;s Edition, which includes a statue and other goodies.
You can check out the trailer below.


The trailer begins by focusing on a setting where an optional boss appeared in the main game and where you can find Miquella&#x27;s egg. The trailer shows new monsters and bosses, like a lion creature with a rotating head and another made entirely of flames. There are also new abilities, items, and weapons, one of which appears to be a roaring bear&#x27;s head. There is also some kind a porcupine alligator creature and the player character sprouted angel wings in one fight. Those are just a few of the standout reveals.

The game&#x27;s official product page does confirm a few additional details, like the name of the main boss seems to be Mesmer the Impaler. Shadow of the Erdtree is also not standalone despite carrying a $39.99 price tag. The page refers to it as an expansion and it will require the base game. Here&#x27;s the official description.
The Shadow of the Erdtree expansion features an all-new story set in the Land of Shadow imbued with mystery, perilous dungeons, and new enemies, weapons and equipment.
Discover uncharted territories, face formidable adversaries, and revel in the satisfying triumph of victory. Dive into the riveting interplay of characters, where drama and intrigue intertwine, that create an immersive experience to savor and enjoy.

R.C. Pro-Am for NES
Battletoads in Battlemaniacs for SNES

                              <span>Following last week&#x27;s Xbox podcast, where Phil Spencer said that four previous Xbox exclusives would be coming to additional platforms in the near future, today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase revealed the first of the four. Grounded, a four-player survival game where players assume the roles of children shrunken down to the size of bugs, is coming to Switch this April.
Grounded originally launched on Xbox One and PC in Early Access in June 2020, where it stayed until September 2022. This is in line with Spencer&#x27;s comments that the Xbox games coming to other platforms will have been exclusive on Xbox for at least a year. The other rumored Xbox titles to come to other platforms are Tango Gameworks&#x27; Hi-Fi Rush, Rare&#x27;s Sea of Thieves, and another Obsidian game, Pentiment. 
Grounded arrives on Switch on April 16 with cross-platform co-op, but you can also take on the miniaturized backyard challenges solo. For more on Grounded, check out our coverage hub right here.</span>

The game is apparently a &quot;faithful&quot; port of the game as the trailer didn&#x27;t highlight much in terms of new content or upgrades. But the game does look undeniably sharper.

The problem seems to be isolated to sites using .TV domains registered at Sarek Oy in Finland, a registrar well known for its pirate-friendly policies. As things stand, hundreds of domains are completely devoid of DNS, resulting in one of the biggest mass blackouts in recent history.

What could that next faction be? Surely it can&#x27;t be any worse than a horde of giant bugs or a legion of robots. Surely it can&#x27;t be, say, a highly advanced elder species of teleporting illusionists equipped with lightning guns and cloaking devices. Oh dear.

                              <span>Playing Pacific Drive reminds me of an army recruitment advert shown on British TV about 20 years ago. A group of soldiers are travelling along a road at night in a Land Rover, when suddenly they spot the enemy ahead. The front seat passenger starts barking orders at the driver: “Get off the road! Kill the lights! Through the trees!”. You sense the panic as the camera, inside the vehicle, jolts with the suspension on the rough ground, and the driver fights the steering wheel to stay in control. It’s a scene you reenact quite frequently in Ironwood’s survival game with roguelike trimmings. Well, except, instead of a Land Rover you’re behind the wheel of a rusty station wagon, and instead of military opposition, you’re scarpering from paranormal phenomena.

                              <span>Inflexion&#x27;s fantasy survival sim Nightingale releases into Steam early access today. Our pre-launch impressions? Well, the procedurally generated landscapes are engrossing, a blend of British fairytale influences with many a hushed forest, spidery swamp and tempting ruin. We&#x27;re also pretty keen as a team on the game&#x27;s Realm cards system, which lets you shape those fairytale worlds both before and after you portal into them. But we were less enthralled by HUD and user interface elements such as the crafting menus and hotbar, which we found ornate and circuitous to the point of confusing. 


Speaking to me after our co-op hands-on - in which guides writer Kiera made friends with a tree monster only for somebody to shoot it - Inflexion&#x27;s CEO Aaryn Flynn explained a bit about how the game will evolve during its early access period, which Inflexion estimate will last 9-12 months. Thankfully, it sounds like fine-tuning the UI is a priority, though Flynn is &quot;cautious&quot; about committing to a full-blown roadmap.

                              <span>Every year, there are a couple of game soundtracks I become properly obsessed with. In 2022, I more or less had the music of Tunic and Citizen Sleeper on repeat whenever I left the house. In 2021, it was Chicory. In 2020, it was Coffee Talk and Signs Of The Sojourner, and in 2019, it was all Mutazione, all the time. 2023 was a pretty great year for game music as well, as we not only got Alan Wake 2&#x27;s exquisite musical set-piece that&#x27;s honestly just been getting better and more insane as time&#x27;s gone on, frankly, but also the toe-tappingly brilliant soundtrack of Cobalt Core, which has somehow risen even higher on my forever playlist after revisiting it for this month&#x27;s RPS Game Club.  
Composed by Aaron Cherof, Cobalt Core&#x27;s music alternates between high-energy battle tracks and calmer, more relaxed ambience. It&#x27;s so dang good, and an absolutely perfect backdrop for sliding in and out of oncoming missile fire in its roguelike spaceship fights. So come along and jam to some of its best tracks with me below as I pick out some of my musical highlights.

                              <span>A colossal new update for Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader launched last night, hitting the grimdark space-aristocrat RPG with so many changes that the patch notes are almost 17,000 words long. Fitting for a game that our Rogue Trader review called &quot;engrossing, obscure and absolutely exhausting&quot;. It adds loads of new voiced lines, fixes everything from wonky abilities to broken quests, reworks balance, improves performance, and so much more. Enough is changed that developers Owlcat are giving everyone in your party a free respec to adjust to what the game has become.

And to celebrate, there&#x27;s a colossal 1.0 update that could take you an hour to read in its entirety. To spare you the time commitment, its highlights include new Acolyte and Rogue masteries, new Item Factions, a full offline mode, controller support, and plenty of visual tweaks.

                              <span>The latest Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage update is giving me flashbacks to that inglorious period in game design when every other action game had an insta-fail stealth segment to wind people up between cover-based shoot-outs and, I don&#x27;t know, three-part glyph puzzles or what-have-you. Out today for PC at 12pm UTC, 1pm GMT, 7am ET and 4am PT, the 1.07 patch adds Full Synchronization Challenge, a permadeath mode (originally teased last year) that not only permakills you when you&#x27;re slain by enemies, but also deletes your save file when you commit crimes such as slaughtering civilians, or going outside of &quot;authorised map locations&quot;.

                              <span>My experience with Warhams isn&#x27;t flat zero - I had some minifigs when I was a teenager and played a few of the Dawn Of War video games - but I haven&#x27;t actively checked in on it for a while. I know enough to make &quot;[x] for the [x] throne!&quot; jokes, basically. My experience with cleaning-stuff-sim PowerWash Simulator is extensive, though, and I was excited when the crossover with Warhammer 40K was teased a while back. Last night we got a full trailer and release date of Frebruary 27th - next week! - and I&#x27;m now earnestly very excited. The trailer is both very funny and shows off massive things to clean. Win win, innit.

What starts as a lovely evening visit to the Mushroom Kingdom’s Sparkle Theater turns into a hectic performance in Princess Peach: Showtime, in which Nintendo’s leading lady must help reclaim the playhouse from Grape and The Sour Bunch, a group of villains hellbent on stealing the spotlight. Peach must visit the theater’s many stages to assist the resident actors in getting the show back on track by transforming into special outfits to complete fun activities like cake decorating, ice skating, and sword fighting. 
My hands-on demo begins on the Sparkle Theater’s first floor, where I can enter four doorways in any order, eac…</span>

                            <span class="media-object__text">
                              <span>Some may look at an early clip of Kingmakers and think they already know what to expect: tactical battles in which you command medieval armies across sweeping battlefields. And that’s partially true. But this new title by Redemption Road Games features an unexpected and absolutely absurd twist.
We’ll let the trailer speak for itself.


In Kingmakers, you control a soldier from a dying world in the future. To save your present, you must travel 500 years in the past to medieval England to change the course of a war to prevent a later apocalypse.
Since the protagonist evidently has no regard for blending in, he arrives fully strapped with modern weaponry such as assault rifles, shotguns, grenade launchers, armored vehicles, and even helicopters to blow these knights back to Camelot. You’ll command your own medieval army, with gameplay seamlessly switching between zoomed-out RTS-style view to issue commands to various units and more action-focused third-person shooting.  
Redemption Road Games states Kingmaker’s armies are fully simulated by a next-generation multithreaded A.I. This allows them to execute advanced pathfinding, decision-making, and even a loyalty system, with a procedurally generated animation system helping bring the mobs to life. Kingmakers also feature co-op with up to three other players. Each ally commands their own army to work together to topple enemy fortresses or defend friendly strongholds. 
Redemption Road Games states in an X post that it has been working on Kingmakers for the last five years. It looks wild and is certainly a refreshing concept. Hopefully, it’s as fun as it looks, and we&#x27;ll find out when it launches to PC via Steam sometime this year.</span>

                              <span>We&#x27;ve reached a point as a society where it feels like it&#x27;s only a matter of time before your favorite celebrity gets added to Fortnite. When I see Patrick Mahomes, Lewis Hamilton, and Eminem all dueling it out in Battle Royale mode, I have to wonder – who is even left to add? Today, we got an answer: Lady Gaga, who will be coming to the game in some kind of collaboration this Thursday, February 22. Notably, the image released specifically says &quot;Fortnite Festival,&quot; implying the crossover might be linked to the game&#x27;s musical mode, likely in the form of instrument skins and songs.
The funniest part about this announcement is the manner in which it was announced. In 2019, Lady Gaga tweeted, &quot;what is fortnight,&quot; either misspelling the popular video game or talking about something else entirely. Now, over four years later, she&#x27;s corrected that spelling mistake with an asterisk while simultaneously announcing her appearance in the game.

Fortnite is the biggest game in the world, and it&#x27;s getting even bigger in the future, thanks to a 1.5 billion-dollar investment from Disney. To learn more about its musical mode specifically, check out our interview with the head of Harmonix, the team behind Fortnite Festival.</span>

                              <span>Developer Abstraction Games aims to resurrect Gigantic, the 5v5 MOBA-hero-shooter hybrid that went offline in 2018 – only a year after its full release. I recently played the upcoming revival, called Gigantic: Rampage Edition, and wished my session didn’t have to end. As an ardent fan of the original, jumping back into Gigantic is invigorating. Explosive fights erupt across the map’s many paths and objectives as each team races to expose and defeat the opposing squad’s Guardian with stylish spells and ultimate abilities. Notably, Gearbox Publishing is leaving the original’s free-to-play structure in the rearview, ditching microtransactions altogether for a $19.99 premium version featuring two new heroes, additional maps, console and PC cross-play, and updated gameplay systems.

Notably, Game Informer&#x27;s original Gigantic review wasn&#x27;t as positive as I personally felt about the game. Did you play the original version? If so, what was your opinion? Do you think Gearbox can successfully find an audience this time around?</span>

                              <span>We&#x27;re in a bit of a live-action video game adaptation golden age right now. Not every project is a hit, but there have been enough success stories that learning about a new film or TV show in the works doesn&#x27;t instantly fill fans with dread. The latest example of that growing trend is the live-action Borderlands movie, which we just got our first official looks at, thanks to People.
This image shows the main line-up of the movie. Going clockwise, starting from the top left, Ariana Greenblatt is Tiny Tina, Florian Munteanu is Krieg, Jamie Lee Curtis is Tannis, Jack Black is the voice of Claptrap, Kevin Hart is Roland, and Cate Blanchett takes the lead role as Lilith. You can see a head-on image of her character below.
This film has been in the works for a while now, but outside of these images, there&#x27;s not much new information. If you haven&#x27;t seen it yet (or just need a refresher, since it&#x27;s been over two years), here&#x27;s the official synopsis from a 2021 press release:
IGN also shared the movie&#x27;s first official poster.
Here&#x27;s the exclusive new poster for the @BorderlandsFilm!

As for what to expect, no details were shared but if it&#x27;s like previous Pokémon Day celebration showcases, it could be an exciting day for trainers. 
This news was revealed today on the official Pokémon X (formerly Twitter) account with a quick video showing a 3D Pikachu rushing onto the screen to pose in front of the Pokémon Presents logo while a retro rendition of a classic song plays. Now, instincts might tell you to read into this model and song but experience learned from previous announcements says it&#x27;s not a tease – The Pokémon Company always does this kind of stuff and there&#x27;s almost no…</span>

                              <span>On Monday, anti-piracy coalition ACE announced the shutdown of SiamBit, an 18-year-old torrent site said to have as many as 100,000 paying members, mostly from Thailand. While those details are unusual, the bigger picture is quite extraordinary. Four people arrested on suspicion of running the site include the suspected ringleader, a  professional racing driver in his late thirties. Events show how an arrest in January triggered a domino effect leading right to his door.

While Reddit declined to comply with recent subpoenas for subscriber information, it handed over the personal details of one user last year. A new court filing sheds some light on the type of evidence being sought by the filmmakers, which includes BitTorrent activity and pirate site visits.

                              <span>Nintendo will air a Partner Showcase of its Direct videos this week on Wednesday, February 21. Unlike a traditional Direct, Partner Showcases are presentations that highlight upcoming third-party games for Switch.
The Direct will air at 6 a.m. Pacific/9 a.m. Eastern on YouTube and will run for 25 minutes. Nintendo states in a press release that it will showcase “Nintendo Switch games coming in the first half of 2024 from our publishing and development partners.”
Ignoring the faint voice in my head whispering, “Hollow Knight: Silksong”, these are some noteworthy games with actual confirmed release dates within that window that could appear:
Inkulinati
Unicorn Overlord
Gylt
Highwater
South Park: Snow Day!
Open Roads
Botany Manor
Tales of Kenzera: Zau
SaGa Emerald Beyond
Braid: Anniversary Collection
Numerous third-party games slated for 2024 lack release dates, so there’s always a chance some of those could get launch windows or new trailers, at least. Some big ones include Contra: Operation Galuga, Decapolice, the long-awaited Switch port of Kingdom Come: Deliverance, Little Nightmares III, Neva, Pepper Grinder, Star Wars: Hunters, Shantae Advance: Risky Revolution, and The Plucky Squire.
Or we could also find out which of those four mysterious first-party Xbox games now going multiplatform is heading to Switch. Just a thought. 
Of course, there’s likely to be at least a few brand-new game announcements. Hopefully, it will be a fruitful Direct, and we luckily don’t have too much longer to wait and find out. What do you hope to see in the Partner Direct? Let us know in the comments!</span>

                              <span>Warframe is making the jump to mobile devices, namely iOS, tomorrow, February 20. Now, fans of the popular sci-fi action MMO can continue playing anywhere.
The iOS version features 10 years&#x27; worth of content and supports cross-play and cross-progression, meaning players can bring their characters anywhere they go. Additionally, players who log in between February 20 and 27 receive a free day 1 award, including 3 Day Affinity Booster and Bombyx Syandana. Warframe is compatible with iPhones and iPads with the A12 bionic chip or later (12th generation iPhones/8th generation iPads and up). 


An Android version is also planned, but its release is currently unknown. You can, however, pre-register for that version on Warframe’s website.

Nearly 10 years on from 2015&#x27;s Helldivers, Helldivers 2 carefully adapts the simple yet exciting formula of bug-blasting with buddies for a modern audience. Arrowhead Game Studios has swapped the top-down perspective for third-person while maintaining the frenetic, ballistic loop of crash-landing on hostile planets, completing difficult missions, and extracting against all odds.
In a galaxy torn apart by war, you and your friends are Helldivers, the brainwashed protectors of Super Earth, invigorated by humorous trite …</span>

                              <span>Respawn&#x27;s work creating the Star Wars Jedi series is a hit among gamers and Star Wars fans alike, so it&#x27;s no wonder people have wondered whether the characters in the game might ascend from cutscenes to the silver screens. The question has been asked in the past, but it was most recently brought up at a panel at FanExpo Vancouver 2024, according to The Direct.
The question was posed to Cameron Monaghan, known for his roles on Gotham and Shameless as well as his starring role as Cal Kestis in the Star Wars Jedi series. For Monaghan, it&#x27;s not a question of whether he&#x27;s willing to reprise his role as the character, but a question of the circumstances in which that character would appear.
&quot;It would have to be right. By that I mean, it has to continue the story or the character in some way.&quot; Mo…</span>

                              <span>It’s been eight years since Street Fighter V hit PC. As you might recall, the fighting game landed with the poise of someone shattering both kneecaps on impact, as complaints about a small roster of characters and barebones story mode - to be filled in later with DLC - were made more egregious by a number of technical issues, including bugs and online issues caused by its wobbly servers.

                              <span>Despite plenty of rumours, we still don’t know when Elden Ring DLC Shadow of the Erdtree will arrive - it could be later this month, this year or maybe beyond even that. While we’re waiting on the official expansion, though, modders have beaten FromSoftware to offering a substantial new experience to those who’ve cleared every corner of the Lands Between.

                              <span>There&#x27;s a particular boss encounter in Balatro that always feels like it&#x27;s cheating a bit. In this mesmerising poker roguelike, each stage is made up of three blinds - small, big and boss - with the blind essentially being a high score you have to hit by playing different kinds of poker hands - your traditional flushes, straights, pairs and so on. Each hand has its own number of chips and multiplier bonuses associated with it, and Balatro&#x27;s whole deal is about shuffling closer to victory by making the most of the cards you&#x27;re dealt. While some blinds are tiny, stretching to just 300 or 450 early on in a run, they quickly start ramping up into the tens of thousands as each successfully defeated boss blind ups the ante and the accompanying stakes. Reach an ante of eight, and bingo, you&#x27;ve won a run of Balatro.
The boss blind I keep coming a cropper with, though, is The Flint. This sucker not only halves a hand&#x27;s chip score, but it also cuts its multiplier in two as well, and I&#x27;ve yet to figure out exactly how to defeat it. Sometimes it appears with a blind of just 600, but other times it&#x27;s been an enormous 22,000. In fairness, all bosses have little tricks like this. Some will debuff certain card suites, making them useless in your overall score count. Others may only let you play one hand type the entire match, while the cheeky Tooth will deduct you $1 for every card used. But Balatro isn&#x27;t simply about beating the odds with smart and intelligent card plays. It&#x27;s about bending, twisting and abusing those odds to your will - also through smart and intelligent card plays. Cheating isn&#x27;t just encouraged in Balatro. It&#x27;s damn near mandatory, and it&#x27;s all thanks to the brilliantly conceived joker cards that give the game its Latin-based name.

Technically, they&#x27;re the final pair of the 15 mastery classes that you&#x27;ll be able to unlock after working through one of Last Epoch&#x27;s five base classes, but listen, I don&#x27;t even need to look at the other 14 masteries to know what I&#x27;m going to be aiming for come release. The Falconer specialisation of Last Epoch&#x27;s Rogue class just sounds too good to pass up.

This week, my eye has been caught by handcrafted art, intense fighting game violence, cosy management, and heaps more attractive and interesting indie games. Check these out!

                              <span>Helldivers 2 is turning out to be an absolute laugh riot of a co-op shooter; it may even have the potential to rival Deep Rock Galactic on good vibes and teammate deaths as accidental comedy masterstrokes. Even ongoing server connectivity issues haven’t done much to spoil the sense of fun, which incidentally, can also be shared on the Steam Deck.
Indeed, following a quick Proton update on Valve’s part, its previously SteamOS-incompatible anti-cheat will no longer put the kibosh on you dropping into Helldivers 2 via your Deck. I’ve been testing on both an original 512GB model and the newer Steam Deck OLED, and as long as you don’t mind dropping the quality settings, it can usually run tidily above 30fps.

                              <span>Modern art puzzler Please, Touch The Artwork was a bit of a surprise hit when it came out in 2022. It not only poked fun at the reverential distance enforced on us by stuffy old art galleries, but it also invited us to recreate abstract modern masterworks by clicking, tracing and generally getting up close and personal with them with our big, colourful in-game fingers. Now, solo developer Thomas Waterzooi is back with Please, Touch The Artwork 2, which takes us on a slightly different journey through the art world as a hidden object point and click game. It&#x27;s out today, is completely free, and was made to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the death of the Belgian expressionist and surrealist painter James Ensor.

Well, another joins the fray in Enotria: The Last Song, an Italian-inspired Soulslike with the loveliest setting I&#x27;ve seen in a while.

                              <span>Cheery RPS fanzine PC Gamer have highlighed a heartwarming story of lost media becoming found again. A mod for Matthew Perry career high and/or nuclear apocalypse RPG sidequest Fallout: New Vegas, which was thought lost since some time around 2016, has been found by chance on someone&#x27;s hard drive. The content of this mod, you ask? It adds a companion who looks like redoubtable nu-metal pioneer Fred Durst. I was trying to come up with a pun to do with &quot;nookie&quot; or that modders will &quot;keep rollin&#x27;&quot;, but I respect you too much for that (also it&#x27;s Monday and I&#x27;m very tired - give me something to break, am I right?).

                              <span>Among the things I like bestest about Inflexion&#x27;s alt-Victorian fantasy survival game Nightingale is its Realm cards mechanic, whereby you generate and modify worlds by playing Major and Minor cards. Major cards are used at portals to conjure up a particular biome or world type and set the difficulty, including an approximate choice of resident NPC factions, local fauna and resources. Minor cards are played within worlds to mess with their workings. You can lower the gravity for optimal umbrella gliding conditions, alter the weather or summon a Blood Moon (sorry, Zelda) that reduces your max health.

                              <span>Another week of PC game releases is upon us and oh heck, slow down. There are an alarming number of games out this week that I want to play, from large-scale 3D productions to itty-bitty time-killers, each sinisterly appropriate to my Steam stats and wider research interests. Are videogame publishers and The Maw in cahoots to overwhelm me with impulse-buys and sabotage my attempts to Report the News? It’s possible. It’s possible. The Maw can be pretty cunning for an indiscriminate force of cosmic famine. The creature has been known to forge alliances with misguided mortals, seeking to flank and overwhelm harried news writers. How else to explain Phil Spencer’s T-shirts?

                              <span>Riot Forge’s last stab  at publishing smaller spin-offs from indie teams has resulted in Bandle Tale: A League Of Legends Story, which at first glance has all the things I love in self-proclaimed cosy games: gorgeous pixel art, laidback objectives and characters cute enough to trigger primal cheek-squishing instincts. But despite looking like an SNES classic and playing like a mix between Animal Crossing and Stardew Valley, Bandle Tale unfortunately ties itself in knots with overly grindy crafting that had me rubbing my temples in an effort not to combust.

                              <span>The Intel Core i5 12600K remains a powerful CPU for gaming and content creation even in 2024, and offers better value than successors that use the same socket, like the 13600K and 14600K, due to similar performance at a lower price. 
Today you can find the 12600K for £167 at Amazon UK as a US import, versus £221 for the same CPU via Amazon UK itself. That £167 price includes an import fee deposit and shipping too!

                              <span>The owner of an astrology business, who allegedly sold subscriptions to a 10,000 channel IPTV service, was warned that his illegal business had no future. A complaint filed at a California court claims the defendant believed he had enough time and space to dodge a cease-and-desist. Ultimately, the stars failed to align, rendering an inevitable copyright infringement lawsuit impossible to predict.

Thanks to the reports made by many of you, we have already solved many of the issues. But there might still be a few issues lurking around in this release candidate. Please share your findings on our issue tracker. Thanks to our translators, about half of the translations are (nearly) up-to-date. For the other half, we might need your help with translating. If your language is missing or has more than a few dozen missing strings, please consider helping to finish your translation. Download Changelog Bug tracker</span>

It&#x27;s less good news for those players struggling to play at all due to login issues and server issues. 

Rocksteady say addressing these is their top priority, although they ask for patience as the problems are &quot;not an easy nut to crack.&quot;

                              <span>Jump King is a simple, brutal, bastard of a platformer in which you attempt to steer a king towards the top of a single tower using his chargeable jump. Misjudge a particular jump by over- or undercharging it, maybe bounce back off a wall, and you may find yourself tumbling all the way back to the beginning again.

It&#x27;s probably about to get a bunch of even harder levels, however, because nearly five years after release it has just got Steam Workshop support and a new set of modding tools.

                              <span>Před týdnem vyšla opravná verze Debianu 12.5, která ovšem rozbila balíčky s ovladači pro grafické karty Nvidia. Aktualizované linuxové jádro totiž změnilo inline funkci na volání dvou symbolů, které jsou k dispozici pouze pod GPL, čímž se tato funkce stala nepřístupnou pro nesvobodné jaderné moduly. Jako dočasné řešení bylo uživatelům doporučováno vrátit se ke staršímu jádru.</span>

                              <span>Skull and Bones is finally out today. Let&#x27;s play the opening hour and see if it is worth wait. Reportedly, the game began development as early as 2013 and spent a few years as an Assassin&#x27;s Creed IV: Black Flag spinoff before turning into Black Flag MMO, before finally emerging as a standalone game announcement in 2017. In the six years since its announcement we&#x27;ve seen teases of it here and there, had chances to play in various betas and alphas, and it even appeared on our cover in 2022. Skull and Bones has been a long time coming, but today everyone is finally able to play it. Our full review isn&#x27;t ready quite yet, but you can  read Matt Miller&#x27;s positive early impressions so far by heading here. You can also check out an hour of gameplay below.

                              <span>How do you update a 30-year old pixel font to make it more suitable for today? The pixel-art OpenTTD fonts are iconic, but were designed for 640x480 CRT monitors rather than today’s 4k monsters. Without the horizontal smoothing of CRT scanlines, modern pixel-perfect rendering and 2x or 4x upscaling of the old bitmap/sprite-based fonts makes the text jagged and hard to read.</span>

                              <span>The launch of 1997’s Final Fantasy VII on Playstation signaled a seismic shift in the video game landscape. The transition from pixel art to fully animated computer graphics was a massive enough leap ahead, but the beauty of this classic title was much more than skin deep. Featuring a stellar cast of beloved characters, a rock-solid combat system, and a story with the potential to instill emotions ranging from awe and joy to grief and anger, the legacy of Final Fantasy VII is well-established in the RPG genre and the games industry as a whole. Read more...</span>

                              <span>We know that Respawn Entertainment, the team behind Titanfall, Apex Legends, and the Star Wars: Jedi series, has a couple of unannounced Star Wars games in the works. It’s unclear what form those projects are taking, but according to one report, one of them may star a Mandalorian.
Insider Gaming reports that its sources have disclosed that Respawn is developing a first-person title in which players assume the mantle of a Mandalorian. For clarification, players do not play as the Mandalorian, as in Din Djarin from the hit Disney Plus series, but rather as a different bounty hunter. The game is reportedly set during the height of the Galactic Empire and will see players capturing or killing bounty targets.
Additionally, Insider Gaming’s sources claim the game is not an open-world title. Inst…</span>

                              <span>As an outgrowth of the naval combat experiences in the Assassin&#x27;s Creed series, I&#x27;ve been curious about Skull and Bones since its announcement as a standalone title in 2017. Since then, the game has seen numerous delays and fundamental reworks on the development side. Our cover story on the game captured one moment in the evolving project’s life in the summer of 2022, and it has continued to change in the months that followed. In recent weeks, some sentiments on the internet and in gaming communities have concluded that, by this point, the game that is releasing must be a mess.
I’m happy to report that’s not the case; Skull and Bones is a lot of fun.
Review access only opened up a few days ago, and the game on offer is exceptionally dense and large, so we’re still working on pulling togeth…</span>

The publishers have announced that they have cancelled “at least” five games in the works to help overcome a significant drop in income over the last year, adopting a new approach to development that will focus on quality.

                              <span>I promise I&#x27;m not trying to turn RPS into a Soggins the Frog fansite, but... If you have a) been enjoying Cobalt Core as part of RPS Game Club this month, and b) especially like it when Soggins turns up with his ship of malfunctioning missile launchers, then I implore you to make Sunshine Heavy Industries your next port of call in your Steam library. It&#x27;s what the Cobalt Core devs Rocket Rat Games made first, and you can immediately see a lot of shared DNA between the two games - not least its chunky, charming pixel visuals and some crossover between its cast of characters - including our pal Soggins. 
It is, I should stress, a very different game to Cobalt Core - it&#x27;s a sandboxy spaceship builder with zero combat involved, for starters - but I&#x27;ve been playing it again this week ahead of some other Game Club-themed articles I&#x27;ve got cooking, and I&#x27;ve been having a lovely time with it. Not least because I get to spend more time with Soggins the very smug frog, all while listening to even more excellent chill tunes from Cobalt Core composer Aaron Cherof.

                              <span>Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3&#x27;s latest update has, as per most of their updates, a colossal number of improvements. Notably, there are new animations for folks who hunker down in your camp and a speedier way to dismiss unwanted companions. But most importantly of all, the smooching has been improved tenfold for fans of romance, or voyeurs who relish virtual characters trading saliva.

                              <span>I&#x27;m kind of fascinated by what happened to Hello Neighbor. The original, a stealth horror game against a creepy AI that learned your likely movements, was hugely popular in alpha in 2016. The series was acquired by TinyBuild in 2020, and since then there has been a heroic number of spin-offs. There&#x27;s one set in an amusement park, a multiplayer game called Secret Neighbor in which one small child is actually a large adult man in disguise, a direct sequel called Hello Neighbor 2, and a VR game called Search And Rescue. I think everyone got a bit of Neighbor fatigue there, lads.
This might include the original creator Nikita Kolesnikov, as (still under the auspices of TinyBuild) he&#x27;s made a new thing. Currently on Steam for playtesting, the project currently known as RBO isn&#x27;t falling far from the home invasion tree, as players will either be a home-owning Protector - a McCallister, if you will - or an Intruder, or Wet Bandit.

                              <span>Because it’s somehow my job to worry about the technical fidelity of electronic toys, I’ve been eyeing the long-overdue arrival of Skull and Bones with some nervousness. After nearly a decade of delays, you’d probably just want to get it out the door, right? Skip straight to the open-world pirate adventuring, none of that &#x27;making it work on a range of graphics cards&#x27; nonsense.
But nope. For all its other shortcomings, Skull and Bones performs alright on PC, very often more smoothly than its system requirements suggest. Though I’d still recommend abiding by its SSD storage requirement – following the rules might not be very piratey, but installing on a hard drive will curse you to some pretty tedious load screen waits. Geoffrey Rush would hate it, honestly.
While Edwin sequesters himself in the starting area, let’s head below deck for a closer look at Skull and Bones’ PC particulars. That includes a full rundown of its graphics options – which include ray tracing and DLSS – and a quick guide to the best settings for an ideal prettiness-to-performance ratio.

                              <span>The first Streets Of Rogue was an RPS favourite when it launched back in 2019 (we literally couldn&#x27;t stop playing it), and we&#x27;ve known for a while now that its sequel, Streets Of Rogue 2, is due to arrive later this year. Ahead of the game&#x27;s launch, developer Matt Dabrowski has started releasing a series of dev diary videos detailing his design process and how it&#x27;s all coming together. The latest is about how he creates the game&#x27;s proc-gen open worlds and biomes, and it&#x27;s a fascinating watch if you&#x27;ve ever wondered how its particular blend of randomised chaos works behind the scenes.

Kokoa TV had been receiving tens of millions of visits each month.

The non-peer-reviewed research confirms previously published findings that were limited to the UK. The effects on unblocked pirate sites are mixed, however, and whether the increased interest in legal content lasts over longer periods has yet to be researched.

                              <span>Corsair&#x27;s Shift series of power supplies are one of my go-to recommendations, thanks to their reliable power delivery and convenient side-mounted connectors, and now you can pick up a factory refurbished 850W 80+ Gold unit for just £84 from Scan, versus £145 for the very same PSU new at Amazon or £150 at Scan. That&#x27;s a huge, nearly 50% saving, and well worth it - even for a factory refurb unit with a 12-month warranty.

We talk a bit about how long it has been coming out, why it&#x27;s been in development this long, and why they didn&#x27;t just release the sucker the two or three previous times they got close to doing so. Honestly, I hope it does okay. We also talk about the games we&#x27;ve been playing this week, and Nate challenges us with a game of Palworld Pal: real or fake? PLUS the giant game dildo and our recommendations this week.

                              <span>I respect a game with wild ambition. Declaring your game &quot;the spiritual successor to Freelancer&quot; is bold and ambitious, considering how the spaceship sim is still so beloved after 20 years that our readers voted it your 16th favourite space game of all time. This ambition is wild when the tiny development team is led by someone best known for replacing Skyrim&#x27;s dragons with Thomas The Tank Engine. So while I&#x27;m not much of a spaceship sort, I had to check out the demo for Underspace, which aims to combine Freelancer shoot-o-trading space action with a dash of Lovecraftian horror.

                              <span>Tracking technology isn&#x27;t perfect. Actually, that&#x27;s an understatement. Tracking technology has many pitfalls, including how Google Maps can be accidentally used to track people, and the fact that if you systematically turn off cookies, your internet browsing experience becomes increasingly bizarre. I am offered adverts for afro hair care products and huge bags of puppy kibble, because the algorithms no longer have any idea who I am or how many small dogs I have. And yet.
Surely this technology has reached the point where, if I open a game for the first time in several weeks, it should be able to tell I haven&#x27;t played for a long time, and ask if I would like a small refresher of the controls.

                              <span>Last night I spent an hour in Ubisoft Singapore&#x27;s Skull And Bones, the much-reconceived, nigh-mythical open world pirate game that has been in development since 2013. Taking a leaf from the book of feared intergalactic corsair Samus Aran, the prologue starts you off at the height of your bucanneering powers, with a mighty gold-and-scarlet galleon at your disposal that is shortly blown to bits by the English Navy.

                              <span>I have never enjoyed those grid-based dungeon-crawling games. I dislike the very notion of dungeon-crawling in general, frankly, but the awkward juddery squareskipping rat-toucher games have always left me absolutely cold.
You will be shocked and aroused to learn that I preface with all this just so I can make an exception of Islands Of The Caliph. Does this mean she&#x27;s becoming more open minded, or just that she&#x27;s found a way to gripe and complain even within a recommendation? Who can say, readers.
What I can say is that I don&#x27;t merely hate it less than its genremates. I think it&#x27;s a bloody great little RPG, full of charm and detail that never drags it down.

                              <span>If you&#x27;ve been enjoying the excellent Cobalt Core as part of this month&#x27;s RPS Game Club, you may well have stumbled into Soggins the frog along your travels. Running into this hapless buffoon is always a delight in Cobalt Core, as he&#x27;s one of the few special characters who doesn&#x27;t instantly attack you on sight. Rather, the task here is always to try and save him from his own idiocy - namely, his malfunctioning ship that keeps firing his missiles right back toward him. He&#x27;s an ungrateful little sod if you do rescue him from certain doom, but I kinda love him for it anyway - and thanks to an industrious pair of modders, you can now have Soggins join your crew to inflict his own special brand of personal chaos on you.

But here we are, with the survival game exceeding 19 million players and Pocketpair probably wondering how they managed such a feat. With its success has come the inevitable slew of impatient people saying the game&#x27;s dead because it&#x27;s not received updates fast enough, or folks saying it&#x27;s lost a hefty percentage of its player base, and others saying its viewership numbers over on streaming services have plummeted. Palworld&#x27;s community manager Bucky has gently reminded folks that not only is this discourse &quot;lazy&quot;, but to play other games instead.

                              <span>Embracer have released their interim financial results for Q3, October-December 2023, in which they share details of the conglomerate&#x27;s on-going efforts to &quot;restructure&quot; and reduce their massive debts, to the tune of hundreds of layoffs over the past year. 


Amid the talk of revenues, profits and losses, we learn that Embracer have laid off 8% of their global workforce since announcing their restructuring program in June 2023. According to the report, Embracer&#x27;s total headcount has fallen from 16,243 in the period October-December 2022 to 15,218 in the period October-December 2023. The number of Embracer studio game projects in development, meanwhile, has fallen from 224 to 179.

                              <span>Readers, consider this is a public service announcement for (deep breath) Tomb Raider I-III Remastered Trilogy Starring Lara Croft. Do not, for the love of all that&#x27;s ancient and holy, play this game with its newly-added modern control scheme. The original tank controls are by far and away the best (and only real) option for going back and experiencing Lara&#x27;s OG adventures from the late 90s, and I&#x27;m not just saying that out of nostalgia. The modern controls are bad, plain and simple, and are as much an enemy to Tomb Raider&#x27;s incredibly precise mode of 3D platforming as the tigers and wolves that stalk its trap-filled catacombs. They are utterly maddening, and the antithesis of everything Tomb Raider stands for. I implore you, do not go anywhere near them, for your own sake as well as Lara&#x27;s.

Helldivers 2 will &quot;never&quot; get a PvP mode, according to Arrowhead&#x27;s CEO Johan Pilestedt. The reason? They want to avoid encouraging any toxic behaviour in the new shooter&#x27;s multiplayer community.
Given that Helldivers 2 is a game with mandatory friendly fire in which you can kill team-mates by respawning right on top of them, I fear the Good Ship Camaraderie may already have sailed, but I&#x27;m very early on in my Helldiver career, and I&#x27;m... intrigued by how Arrowhead&#x27;s efforts at community curation sit alongside/within the game&#x27;s premise of playing a dirty space fascist locked in an endless xenophobic crusade.

                              <span>As promised earlier this week, Microsoft and Xbox executives Phil Spencer (head of Xbox), Sarah Bond (president, Xbox) and Matt Booty (Head of Xbox Game Studios) got together today to share some important &quot;updates on the Xbox business.&quot; You can check out the full update below, but the headline is that four future formerly Xbox and PC exclusive games are coming to other consoles, but Spencer was not ready to reveal what those games are. They are games that are more than a year old that have been on Xbox and PC for awhile. A couple of the games, Spencer says, are community-driven and service-based games that have reached their full potential on Xbox and PC. They are franchises that Xbox wants to continue to invest in. Two are smaller games that were not built to be platform exclusives. Though he wasn&#x27;t ready to share the game titles, he did confirm that Starfield and Indiana Jones are not in that group.
According to sources reported by The Verge, it seems the four titles may be Hi-Fi Rush, Pentiment, Sea of Thieves, and Grounded.
Spencer cushioned everything he said, presumably in expectation of pushback from Xbox fans by saying, “We make every decision with the long term health of Xbox in mind.” He also made sure to remind everyone that Xbox already has games on other platforms, calling out Minecraft in particular. Spencer also briefly touched on the company&#x27;s decision to lay off over 1900 employees, though offered little in terms of reasonable rationalization.
Bond also mentioned that Xbox is looking forward to and making plans surrounding future hardware and vaguely promised a substantial leap in technical prowess, but offered little in terms of concrete details.


The podcast also confirmed Activision/Blizzard games are coming to Game Pass starting with Diablo IV on March 28 and that we can expect a new Xbox showcase in June.</span>

                              <span>It’s been three years since EA announced it was making a new college football game after a years-long hiatus. Dubbed EA Sports College Football 25, not much has materialized about the game since its reveal in the way of updates, but the publisher has broken its silence with a new trailer confirming a release window and promising a bigger look at the title in the near future.
The video heavily leans into the skepticism fans have expressed over College Football’s existence, proudly expressing, “Yes, the game is real” while showing off snippets of behind-the-scenes development footage. The snazzy video doesn’t do much besides that, but it ends with a promise of a full reveal in May and a summer launch window. 


EA Sports College Football 25 is being developed by EA Orlando (formerly known as Tiburon), the team behind the Madden games. This will be the first college football game from the publisher since the demise of its NCAA Football series, the last entry of which was released in 2013. The franchise was shelved due to a 2014 federal lawsuit in which the judge ruled that the NCAA’s long-standing rule prohibiting college athletes from being compensated for their in-game likenesses was unlawful. 
With Name, Image, Likeness (NIL) rules now in place in college sports, players can now be paid for appearing in advertisements or products. That would, of course, include video games. EA Sports struck a deal with OneTeam Partners to broker deals with players to include their NIL in the upcoming game. However, this was met with resistance from school/player licensing agency The Brandr Group last summer, which filed a lawsuit to prevent EA from conducting such deals with OneTeam Partners. Both entities eventually agreed to a settlement in November, dropping the lawsuit (thanks College Football HQ). 
We don’t know what platforms EA Sports College Football 25 will target, but that answer should hopefully come in May’s larger update.</span>

                              <span>A new trailer for Princess Peach: Showtime shows off some more outfits and abilities the Mushroom Kingdom’s pink monarch has up her royal sleeve. 
Princess Peach: Showtime pits Peach against the villainous Sour Bunch, who crashes a performance at the Sparkle Theater. Its guardian, Stella, grants Peach the ability to transform and gain powers based on the costumes she dons. Stages take the form of different theater plays with ever-changing sets. 
The video introduces Figure Skater Peach, which sees her gracefully skating across a winter-themed stage and performing spins to take out enemies. The Dashing Thief costume gives Peach a Carmen Sandiego-esque look and vibe as she uses a retractable grappling hook to zipline and swing across 2D levels while evading security bots. Mermaid Peach grants a siren-like singing voice used in what appears to be a type of musical mini-game. Mighty Peach basically turns the Princess into a Super Sentai-like hero battling aliens using super strength and a jetpack to take out foes mid-air.


Princess Peach: Showtime is coming to Switch on March 22. Nintendo is also launching pink rose-colored Joy-Cons for the occasion.</span>

                              <span>If initial reports coming out of Italy today are proven true, Italy&#x27;s Piracy Shield system designed to block live sports piracy, is currently blocking Zenlayer CDN IP addresses and the innocent services reliant upon them. A claim that cloud services provider Cloud4C has been rendered inaccessible appears to be credible.

Rightsholders insisted that, without a license, TVkaista was an illegal service. In subsequent legal action, the operators of the service faced allegations of criminal copyright infringement and fraud. Seventeen years after TVkaista&#x27;s launch, its former CEO has just been sentenced to three years in prison and ordered to pay $505,000 in compensation.

                              <span>The AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D is my current go-to high-end gaming CPU recommendation, on account of its brilliant top-tier performance at a mid-tier price. The CPU normally costs around £375, but today it&#x27;s down to £350 at Amazon UK. This isn&#x27;t the cheapest we&#x27;ve ever seen this model, but it&#x27;s the best price recorded in 2024 so far and a solid £25 below the going rate.

                              <span>The RTX 4070 Super is a rather good deal, offering a significant boost in gaming performance over the earlier RTX 4070 - in fact, it&#x27;s closer to the 4070 Ti than the vanilla 4070. That makes it a great choice for gaming up to 4K, while costing just a bit over the £500 mark - £539 to be accurate after a £50 discount that puts it below the UK RRP of £579. 
That price is for a relatively modest Zotac Twin Edge model which fits easily even into small form factor PC, but thanks to the efficiency of the Ada Lovelace architecture the card should still run quite cool and quiet.

Since researching and documenting them all has become all but impossible, a broader statement will suffice. Give or take, MPA/ACE appear to have amassed over 3,000 pirate site domains but the potential for that to expand exponentially isn&#x27;t as outrageous as it might sound.

                              <span>Apple is relatively good at banning piracy-related software from its App Store. Now and then, a pirate app may slip through the cracks, as happened this week. These are typically dealt with right away, but not always. Just as intriguing is the fact that the App Store is riddled with apps that use pirate brands, presumably to attract users.

                              <span>Ys X: Nordics, the latest entry in the long-running Ys series, is making its way to the West. Nordics stars a younger version of series hero Adol Christin embarking on an adventure in the Obelia Gulf, a collection of northern islands.
He finds himself thrown in the middle of a conflict between the islands’ residents and a seafaring tribe, as well as mysterious immortal monsters called the Griegers. Adol joins a Norman warrior named Karja to sail the seas aboard a ship, including exploring an open ocean and engaging in naval combat. 


Ys X: Nordics was first released in Japan last September and will come stateside this fall. It will be available for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC.
Have you always been curious about the Ys series but don’t know whether to jump in? Former editor John Carson explains in this feature why RPG fans shouldn’t sleep on Ys. You can also check out our 40-year retrospective on developer Nihon Falcom.</span>

A developer can take many different approaches when remaking a game, but its primary goal always remains the same: to create a new experience that honors the spirit of the original. With Mario vs Donkey Kong, a remake of the 2004 Game Boy Advance title of the same name, Nintendo succeeds in this goal. By combining new worlds and modern quality-of-life features with the game&#x27;s classic, delightful puzzle design, Mario vs. Donkey Kong is a strong start to Nintendo&#x27;s 2024.
In the game&#x27;s opening, Donkey Kong raids a toy factory where they make Mini Marios, the hottest new product on the market. To get them back, Mario must chase him down through eight worlds…</span>

                              <span>DC Universe Online developer Dimensional Ink Games and its publisher Daybreak Game Company have been hit with layoffs. 
According to Kotaku, Dimensional Ink lost an unknown number of senior staff, with Game Developer reporting reductions in the art, community, and narrative departments. The team is best known for developing the superhero MMO DC Universe Online. Daybreak Games (formerly Sony Online Entertainment) has worked on several multiplayer games, including EverQuest II, H1Z1, Star Wars Galaxies, and Planetside 2. The exact number of affected employees from both studios is currently unknown. 
This is, unfortunately, the latest of an alarming trend of game industry layoffs that plagued 2023 and have only intensified in 2024. Over 5,500 jobs have been cut within January alone. Last year, over 10,000 employees in the games industry or game-adjacent industries were laid off. 
Among others this year, Embracer laid off 97 employees at Deux Ex developer Eidos-Montréal, Destroy All Humans remake developer Black Forest Games reportedly laid off 50 employees, Microsoft laid off 1,900 employees across its Xbox, Activision Blizzard, and ZeniMax, Outriders studio People Can Fly laid off more than 30 employees, and League of Legends company Riot Games laid off 530 employees.</span>

                              <span>MG Premium has won its bizarre lawsuit against pirate site Goodporn. In the early stages of the case, the Pornhub.com domain was &#x27;virtually&#x27; at stake, but Pornhub&#x27;s sister company was eventually awarded over $2.1 million in damages. The court denied injunctive relief, however, which means that there are no domain seizures or site-blocking orders.

                              <span>Several authors, including comedian Sarah Silverman, have suffered an early loss in their copyright battle against OpenAI. The authors accused OpenAI of using pirated copies of their books to train its models. A California federal court dismissed the vicarious copyright infringement and DMCA violation claims. However, the lawsuit isn&#x27;t over yet.

                              <span>We’ve all been there. You see a chair in a game. It prompts you to sit. Curious, you oblige. 
Your digital butt meets the seat, and…nothing. You just sit and stare for a few seconds before rising and continuing your adventure. More often than not, sitting does not result in a cutscene, reward, character dialogue, or, in some cases, even a good view of your surroundings. You just sit. 
You could be slaying a mighty dragon.
You could be rescuing your captive friends.
You could be discovering the true meaning behind your existence and your place in the cosmos.
But instead, you sit. 
With some exceptions, taking a seat in games equates to a whole lot of nothing. And yet, it remains a regularly recurring mechanic. So why do we sit? Do you like to sit? How long do you sit? Should sitting still be a thing in games? Please take a seat and discuss your stance in the comments below.</span>

                              <span>Last week, amid rumors about Xbox exclusives coming to other platforms, Phil Spencer announced an event that would detail the future of Xbox. While we&#x27;re no closer to knowing the exact details of the event, we now know the &quot;where&quot; and &quot;when&quot;: the announcement will happen on the official Xbox podcast this Thursday, February 15. The episode will be posted at 12 PM Pacific/3 PM Eastern

The podcast in question will feature more than just Xbox head Phil Spencer, however. Sarah Bond and Matt Booty, the Presidents of Xbox and Xbox Game studios, respectively, will also give updates on the future of the brand. 
There are a few likely candidates for discussion. The most recent is the report that Xbox exclusives would begin coming to other platforms, including Hi-Fi Rush, Starfield, and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. Speculation around this news has taken many different directions, with some even theorizing that the loss of exclusivity implies Xbox might stop making consoles altogether. A report from earlier today, however, says that this isn&#x27;t the case.
The other topic on the table is the company&#x27;s most recent round of mass layoffs, where over 1900 employees were let go from the company, and a Blizzard survival game years into development was canceled. While Blizzard and Microsoft have since asserted that the layoffs would have happened with or without their notorious merger, the FTC filed a complaint. Either for gamers, employees, or the regulatory bodies of the world, it&#x27;s a viable point of discussion.
When the podcast is posted on Thursday, you&#x27;ll be able to listen to it on Xbox&#x27;s YouTube channel right here.

Speculation has run rampant about what the event entails amid rumors that several first-party Xbox title are making their way to other platforms, with some believing this event will confirm those reports. On the extreme end, others believe Spencer may announce the end of Xbox as a console platform altogether. According to one report, that may not be the case.
Inverse journalist Shannon Liao reported in her weekly gaming newsletter that Spencer held a company town hall last Tuesday and told employees there are no plans to stop making Xbox consoles.

The controls have been modernized and the games look better, but thankfully, the original versions of the three games are available as part of the package as well. Join Brian Shea and me as we check out the first levels of the three games, discuss what works about them, and where there are some shortcomings.

Access real devices with Device Streaming in Android Studio

Device streaming in Android Studio lets you securely connect to remote physical Android devices hosted in Google&#x27;s secure data centers. Powered by Firebase, it&#x27;s the fastest and easiest way to test your app against real devices, including the Google Pixel 8 Pro, Pixel Fold, select Samsung devices, and more.

After connecting to a device, you can deploy your app, view the display, interact with the device (including rotating or unfolding the device), and anything else you might do with a device over a direct ADB over SSL connection—all without leaving Android Studio. When you&#x27;re done using the device, Google wipes all your data and factory resets the device before making it available to another developer.
During Open Alpha, you can use Device Streaming at no cost. To get started simply sign into your Developer account from Android Studio and select a Firebase project. If you don&#x27;t already have a Firebase project, it&#x27;s easy to create one. To learn more, go to Device Streaming in Android Studio.

Below is a list of general fixes in Android Studio Jellyfish | 2023.3.1 Canary 9 and Android Gradle Plugin 8.4.0-alpha09 These are a result of your bug

                              <span>Well, third time’s the charm, or so they say. So let’s try this again, shall we? With beta 3, we’ve restored the cargo types that went missing in the sub-artic and tropical climates. We’ve also included fixes for various other issues which are listed in the full changelog linked below. Thanks to the reports made by many of you, we could solve the issues quickly. But never fear if you’ve missed out so far, there are still a lot of treasures to hunt for in this beta. Please share your findings on our issue tracker. And watch this space as we’ll soon start with our feature posts about the new things coming with OpenTTD 14. In the first installment, you’ll learn why buses don’t always come when they should and what you can do about it. Download Changelog Bug tracker</span>

                              <span>OpenTTD turns 20 this year, and to celebrate we are preparing for one of our largest ever releases. It’s packed with 40 new features, 80 changes, and almost 150 fixes. In the upcoming weeks we will share more posts explaining some of these features in depth. For now, we need your help testing our work. We need as many people as possible to test this beta version of the 14.X release series, so you can find and we can squash as many bugs as possible before the actual release. To guide you a bit towards what you should be looking for: Generic gameplay bugs and crashes. There is a new Ship Pathfinder; test it out. Buoys are optional to use. You can now automatically unbunch your vehicles at a depot. We added our own interpretation of daylength to the game. More on this soon in another blog post. There are many GUI improvements throughout the game. More consistent look, better GUI scaling. There are many more things worth talking about, and this will be made more clear when we approach the release of 14.0. But for now, play the game, and please report any issues you find. The usual titlegame competition has also been announced on the forums. See the page for the exact competition rules if you are interested. Download Changelog Bug tracker</span>
