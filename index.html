                              <span>In May 2022, Italian police claimed that thousands of people had unwittingly subscribed to a pirate IPTV service being monitored by the authorities. When users tried to access illegal streams, a warning message claimed that they had already been tracked. With fines now being received through the mail, police are making some extraordinary claims about how this was made possible.

                              <span>First week sales 25% higher than Sword and Shield.
The latest boxed charts data is in and, as expected, it&#x27;s a big win for the recently released Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, with both entries coming in at number one and two.
In terms of which of the two proved more popular, it seems most opted for Violet and its Legendary Pokémon Miraidon, with this version making up 52% of total sales. Meanwhile, Scarlet made up 42%, and the Dual Pack - containing both games in one handy box - entered the charts at number six, making up the remaining 6% of sales.

Goooooood morning, friends, and welcome to Whatcha Been Playing? I hope that you have had a marvelous week, and that the weekend ahead brings you much joy and/or rest (delete as applicable) as you require... I might bail on my quota of Joy and take Double Rest, to be honest, such is the crazy busy month I&#x27;ve had so far. Unless its Joi from Blade Runner 2049. I&#x27;ll take Double Joi for sure. Please.
Anywhoo, thanks for stopping in for our small weekly winding. I really appreciate that y&#x27;all still making the effort to show out and keep the scene alive, week after week. It&#x27;s important to the site, and it&#x27;s very important to me. But most of all, it&#x27;s important for you, the community. We&#x27;ve been here over 200 times, and I never stop feeling the love and comradeship …</span>

Hi folks, and welcome to another edition of Box Art Brawl!
As usual, let&#x27;s take a look at last week&#x27;s edition before we crack on with another high stakes brawl. We threw the NES classic Punch Out!! into the ring to see which of the very distinct variants would come out on top. Rather surprisingly, it seems that the vast majority of you preferred the version featuring &quot;Iron Mike&quot; himself, Mike Tyson. Winning with 57% of the vote, it beats out the Gold Edition at 29%, and the Mr. Dream variant at 14%. Well done, Mike!

                              <span>Yes, Wii U had games that didn&#x27;t get Switch ports!
In honour of the Wii U&#x27;s 10th birthday, we&#x27;re republishing this list of Wii U eShop games that are well worth downloading before the store disappears in March 2023. Enjoy!

While many are rightly lamenting the upcoming death of the 3DS eShop, we feel like fewer gamers are pouring one out for the Wii U digital store. Maybe it&#x27;s just us, but we can&#x27;t let that stand, as the console actually had some darn good games — some of which are still exclusives to this day. Nintendo&#x27;s GamePad concept may not have paid off with the public, but it did give developers some fun ideas.

Earlier this year in August, THQ Nordic surprised wrestling fans with the news AEW: Fight Forever would be coming to the Nintendo Switch at some point in 2023.
If you&#x27;re eager to see more, you&#x27;re in luck - with the publisher releasing a brand new look at the gameplay footage. This title is promoting itself as a fun &quot;pick up and play&quot; experience, transporting players back to the &quot;golden era&quot; of wrestling games. It will feature wrestling icons like Sting, multiple stages and plenty of weapons to punish your opponent. There&#x27;ll even be mini-games.

The new Pokémon Scarlet and Violet games are perhaps the most ambitious entries in the long-running series ever, but unfortunately, it seems the game&#x27;s performance and technical issues are dragging down the overall experience for many trainers around the world.

                              <span>We&#x27;re having Super Mario 64 flashbacks.
As you might have already seen, Pokémon Scarlet and Violet comes with a certain glitch that could potentially be used to exploit the game in all sorts of ways. It&#x27;s essentially the Pokémon equivalent of Super Mario 64&#x27;s infamous Backwards Long Jump glitch - often abbreviated as BLJ.
This move - closely associated with speedrunning in the 1996 release Super Mario 64, was also spotted in Pokémon Legends: Arceus at launch, and now it&#x27;s been discovered in Scarlet and Violet. It&#x27;s as simple as mounting your legendary Koraidon or Miraidon and from there scaling a mountain. You could even potentially speedrun parts of the game. Here&#x27;s a look:

                              <span>I was once a regular Counter-Strike player, but that was almost twenty years ago. What&#x27;s remarkable about Valve&#x27;s team shooter is how little its fundamentals have changed over those twenty years. The AWP and M4A1? Still pretty much how they were when I was first mishandling them in the Half-Life mod. 

Which makes yesterday&#x27;s Counter-Strike: Global Offensive update pretty remarkable. The AWP&#x27;s magazine size has been cut in half and the M4A1-S now does less damage at long range.

                              <span>At this point, I&#x27;d consider the wacky bugs continually introduced to The Sims 4 as more of a feature than a bug. For example, a recent update turned previously placid Sims into moody, argumentative jerks who were constantly scrapping with one another. That sounds great to me, although if you disagree there&#x27;s bad news. EA Maxis say that their fix, intended to release this past week, has been delayed until early December.

That&#x27;s fine with me - I need an SD card - but you may also enjoy Steam&#x27;s unaffiliated Autumn Sale. Valve have announced it&#x27;ll begin on Tuesday, November 22nd and run for a week until November 29th.

                              <span>I recently bought a new hoover, or I suppose a first hoover, the first hoover which I actually own. After decades of whichever crap hoover my landlords dumped in a flat cupboard rather than throw away, here I am, a hoover owner. Did you know: a hoover, when pushed over a floor, will suck up dust? And keep the dust inside? Amazing. Genuinely a joy to be doing a bit of hoovering this week. Plus I bought a Shark, and Shark owners seem to get very excited when they hear someone has bought a Shark, so I guess I&#x27;m now part of a(nother) gang. Anyway! What are you playing this weekend?

You think Hamster has already hit all of the shmups released in the late &#x27;80s/early &#x27;90s? Well, think again, buster, as the retro lovin&#x27; publisher has added Taito&#x27;s eye-searing shooter Metal Black to its mammoth Arcade Archives range, with the forgotten shmup now available to purchase on PS4 and Nintendo Switch.
Released to the arcade market in 1991, during Taito&#x27;s &quot;Loud &amp; Vulgar&quot; phase, (see also: Under Fire, Special Criminal Investigation), Metal Black is a horizontally scrolling sci-fi shmup set against the backdrop of a damaged Earth, having fallen victim to a devastating meteor shower. In the aftermath of this event, an alien force attacks the weakened planet, leading to the surrender of humanity. However, one rogue pilot, John Ford, refuses to allow mankind to go quietly into the night. Hijacking prototype vessel &quot;CF-345 Black Fly&quot;, Ford embarks on a final bid to send the unwelcome visitors packing.
You can check out the action in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber AL82 Retrogaming.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;bB4mS79R0DI
Metal Black consists of six stages of frenetic sky-fighting action, with mechanics not dissimilar to that of Irem&#x27;s R-Type and Taito&#x27;s own Darius franchise. As previously noted, Metal Black comes from an era of Taito that features somewhat ugly textures, slapdash scaling, and some brutal visual effects, which often renders the in-game action a little tough to follow. Regardless, this forgotten example does feature a pretty rad soundtrack, interesting boss designs, and a novel feature that sees the story come to one of two massively different conclusions, dependent on how the player fares on the final encounter.
Metal Black is available to download on PS4 and Nintendo Switch now.

The Risk of Rain series is under new ownership. As part of the financial update from Embracer Group this week, Gearbox announced they&#x27;d acquired the IP for Risk of Rain and its sequel Risk of Rain 2.
Gearbox Publishing was the publisher of Risk of Rain 2. Now, it seems the company is taking the reins of the franchise.
&quot;After years of passionate publishing work on Risk of Rain 2, we have developed a deep love and respect for the IP,&quot; reads a statement from Gearbox on the Risk of Rain 2 account. &quot;We are eager to prove ourselves as worthy custodians by continuing to bring you world-class content and ensuring a bright future for this genre-leading franchise.&quot;

Harvestella takes place in a land where four massive crystals known as Seaslights that keep the world in balance and bless the people who call this place home. At beginning of this tale, your character awakens with a customary case of amnesia. After a quick once over by the town doctor, they bear witness to a meteor striking just outside the town of Lethe Village. Inside is a mysterious girl known as Aria. A traveler from the future? Perhaps, but her arrival marks the beginning of a journey that’ll see your hero fighting their way through dungeons in a quest to save the world.
In other words, your typical JPRG storyline, but with some farming thrown in for good measure.

                              <span>The fans are split on this one
Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet is finally out, and it&#x27;s been met with, uh, mixed reviews to say the least. While some fans are simply thrilled to have a new game to sink their teeth into, others are disappointed with the game&#x27;s visuals, gameplay, and the plethora of bugs. The result is that Scarlet &amp; Violet has the lowest score on Metacritic of any mainline Pokémon game ever at a 77 -- no new gen Pokémon has scored below an 80 until now.
For years, Metacritic has been the golden standard in the games industry of the success of your game, and a bad score is enough to sink a small studio. Game Freak and Nintendo likely won&#x27;t bat an eye at the score unless it causes any sort of dip in post-launch sales, which isn&#x27;t unlikely considering how vocal fans are being with th…</span>

                              <span>Only for &quot;players ranked S+0 or higher&quot;
In the next seasonal update slated for December 1 (titled &quot;Chill&quot;), we&#x27;re getting a number of content drops in Splatoon 3, including a few new modes, weapons, and levels.
For a subset of people, the &quot;X Battles&quot; addition could be the most impactful, as it promises a higher stakes ranked mode beyond what Anarchy Battles provide.
Here&#x27;s Nintendo&#x27;s full breakdown:
&quot;Also, quick reminder that X Battles are coming in Chill Season! Players ranked S+0 or higher can get in on some action that is decidedly NOT chill. You&#x27;ll have to put your own X Power on the line to take part, but don&#x27;t worry—Anarchy Battles will still be available as well. If you do decide to take the plunge into X Battles, you&#x27;ll need to join one of two divisions sponsored by local gear brands. The Takoroka Division covers Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand, while the Americas and Europe play in the Tentatek Division.&quot;

In short, X Battles are an additional thing (and currently the highest tier possible) for competitive players to jump into. But it&#x27;s very important to note that even if you&#x27;ve raised your rank to the point where you&#x27;ve unlocked X Battles, Anarchy Battles will still be available on a separate tier. So even if you end up not liking it, you can just trade back down.
I also highly suspect that X Battles are going to be getting a number of tweaks going forward, just like nearly every other mode in the game so far.

You&#x27;ve probably heard that Pokémon Scarlet and Violet were released in... a bit of a state. Although that may be a massive disappointment for most people spending nearly $100 on the game, it&#x27;s also been a source of great amusement on social media, where people have been discovering that the new co-op multiplayer feature is very buggy indeed.
We&#x27;re not sure exactly what causes these issues, but it seems like the integration of other players in cutscenes and in traversal makes for some really quite scary body-horror. There are gigantic, stretched-out human bodies, horrible arm-twisting impossibilities, and faces going very wrong.

It&#x27;s Pikachu weekend in Singapore, and The Pokémon Company is going all-out with a number of events — including a Pikachu dance party, a Pokémon GO Safari Zone with Maractus, Shiny Purrloin, and a purple T-shirt Pikachu available to catch, and a massive Pokémon drone show with Pikachu as the star. There will also be &quot;Pokégenic&quot; picture spots around the Gardens by the Bay, featuring Pokémon graffiti.
But the drone show seems to be what&#x27;s capturing people&#x27;s imaginations the most, after it took place at 7:30pm on the 19th November in Singapore&#x27;s Marina Bay.

Soapbox features enable our individual writers and contributors to voice their opinions on hot topics and random stuff they&#x27;ve been chewing over. Today, following up on his piece from a few weeks back, Jim delivers his verdict on the ten-year-old console and how it holds up in 2022 ...

Picture the scene. The year was 2012. I, age 14 at the time, was at my absolute coolest. Did that mean being myself and not worrying what others thought of me? Absolutely not. I was 14. What others thought of me was the be-all and end-all of my existence.

It looks like we are just about there folks, Pokémon Scarlet and Violet is finally here which surely means there are no more trailers, &#x27;mon reveals or surprise announcements for the next few weeks, right?
This week has been a busy one here at Nintendo Life. Aside from the release of Scarlet and Violet (for which we discussed the pros and cons of naming your Pokémon), yesterday marked the ten year anniversary of the Wii U and we compared the console&#x27;s launch trailer to that of the Switch as well as forming a ranking of its best launch titles.

Honestly, we don&#x27;t mind listening to singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran every now and then, but it seems not every Pokémon fan feels the same way.
A new mod for the latest releases Pokémon Scarlet and Violet has gone to the extent of removing - yes, removing - Ed&#x27;s song &#x27;Celestial&#x27; from the games. To add insult to injury, it&#x27;s apparently the first mod that&#x27;s been uploaded on a certain website... ouch!

Pokémon has been around for more than 25 years now, and in this time frame, there have been nine generations of pocket monsters released into the wild.
So, where are we at now that Pokémon Scarlet and Violet have been released? It seems Game Freak has finally reached the milestone of 1,000 Pokémon. Yep, it&#x27;s actually done it after all these years.

Update : A new shoe in the Pokémon X PUMA collection was released on November 12th, with Gen 1 ghost-type Gengar as the theme. The sneaker, which is a TRC Blaze Court in Electric Purple/Fiery Red, does not appear to be available on the PUMA website, although several shoe enthusiast sites have it listed in their second-hand marketplace. The rest of the sneaker designs — including Pikachu, Charmander, Squirtle, and Bulbasaur — are available to buy.

Update : The Pokémon Company has now officially announced the collection with a simple tweet.

Now that Masahiro Sakurai is free from the bonds of Smash Bros., he&#x27;s been running his own YouTube channel, covering a bunch of different topics from game design and UI to animation and sound effects. One of the series he has is called Grab Bag, which touches on more random stories, but all of them are still pretty much game-related in some way... until today, that is.
Sakurai&#x27;s latest video is about his cat, Fukura.

                              <span>Not the Grimmest of outcomes.
About a decade ago, Rooster Teeth launched a new anime web series called RWBY, which went on to spawn a reasonably successful media franchise. Yet—aside from a rather unfortunate hack ‘n’ slash game that bombed—RWBY’s only representation in video games consisted of a handful of mobile games and cameo appearances. In an effort to change this, a new project called RWBY: Arrowfell was announced in 2020, led by WayForward and Arc System Works. Now, nearly two years on, the game has finally seen a release and, well… it’s alright. Those waiting for the RWBY series to finally get a great video game adaptation will just have to keep waiting, but RWBY: Arrowfell is still a decent, if flawed, game.
RWBY: Arrowfell is set sometime in the seventh volume of the anime, just after Ruby, Weiss, Blake, and Yang have become officially licensed huntresses. While fulfilling quests while looking to make a name for themselves, they soon stumble upon a mysterious military technology that seems to attract Grimms and get caught up in a broader conspiracy as they investigate its origins. It’s not a particularly riveting story, but it provides just enough incentive to keep you engaged, buoyed in part by fully voice-acted cutscenes at key story beats that mimic the animation style of the show. Those of you with no background in RWBY may be a little lost sometimes as to how various characters and organizations are related to each other, but the narrative is kept simple enough that things don’t get too confusing.

Though only out for less than a day, Pokémon Scarlet and Violet has proved divisive in how it attempts to move the franchise forward. To some, the games make a great leap from what has come before, with their open worlds and Let&#x27;s Go mechanic making life that little bit easier, but for others the games don&#x27;t go far enough to push the boat out - they remain too close to what precedes them.
One thing that has most certainly changed for Generation IX however, not that many will notice it, is the rare Pokémon disease Pokérus (or rather, the absence of it).

What&#x27;s weirder still is that it will be playable on Game Boy Color via Limited Run Games, with cartridge pre-orders now available.

It&#x27;s the 10th anniversary of the Wii U&#x27;s North American launch and to mark the occasion we invited erstwhile Nintendo Life editor and all-around thoroughly nice chap Thomas Whitehead to reminisce about the machine, the time he first got his hands on it, and the hot takes he had pre-launch...

The Wii U is now 10 years old, which may come as a surprise. It’s been off the market long enough that it feels like the system should be in its teens by now. But, as most reading these pages know, it was a sizeable commercial failure for Nintendo. In fact, if you disregard the Virtual Boy, it is Nintendo’s worst-selling &#x27;mainline&#x27; console. Yes, it’s very sad, let’s all take a moment…

Terayama, member of Capcom&#x27;s in-house band, shows off the individual instruments that comprise Kimberly&#x27;s music, the process of revising a track based on work from the larger development team, and why Kimberly&#x27;s old-school tastes pair well with the game&#x27;s hip-hop inspirations.

The two take you through the game&#x27;s opening, showcasing what exactly you do in this Atari museum as its sole caretaker, from sweeping away dust to killing bugs and more. 
The two also discuss how presenting Atari games as a WarioWare-like microgame collection is the perfect way to showcase these classic titles. It doesn&#x27;t hurt that the museum experience in the game gives players the chance to admire high-quality screens of classic Atari game box art, game manuals, and more.

                              <span>Legendary Sonic designer and Balan Wonderworld director Yuji Naka has been arrested in Tokyo in connection to an insider trading investigation involving the reveal of a Dragon Quest game. 
According to the Japanese news outlet FNN, the last 24 hours saw ex-Square Enix employee Taisuke Sazaki and his friend Fumiaki Suzuki arrested on suspicion for insider trading. In 2020, developer Aiming had been set to announce its mobile game Dragon Quest Tact, and Sazaki and Suzuki are alleged to have known details about the game before it was publicly revealed. The pair reportedly purchased a combined 162,000 shares of Aiming for roughly 47.2 million yen (or over $335,000) in advance with the intent of profiting on a potentially higher stock price stemming from Tact’s announcement. 
Yuji Naka is now suspected of being involved in this scandal as well. He is accused of purchasing 10,000 shares worth 2.8 million yen (roughly $20,000) in Aiming for the same purpose of profiting from Tact’s reveal. Naka was apprehended by Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office, and the investigation is ongoing. It’s currently unknown if the suspects still own their shares or if they already sold them.  
This is the second major controversy Naka has found himself involved with this year. In April, Naka publicly blasted Square Enix on Twitter over his removal as director from Balan Wonderworld prior to its release, blaming Square for the game’s critical failure. This outburst came after the conclusion of a lawsuit he’d previously filed against the publisher. Naka is best known as the lead programmer behind the original Sonic the Hedgehog games for Sega Genesis and Nights into Dreams.

                              <span>Each time we start up a new mainline Pokémon game, we begin our journey with a choice. Sometimes it&#x27;s an easy one. Sometimes it&#x27;s agonizing. But regardless of where on that spectrum each generation lands for you, the general choice remains the same: grass, water, or fire. Thanks to the rock-paper-scissors nature of the types on offer, no one option is, by definition, superior. For Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, those types are represented through Sprigatito, Quaxly, and Fuecoco.
Now that Pokémon Scarlet and Violet are officially out in the wild, we want to know which starter you&#x27;re rolling with. While you&#x27;re at it, which factors go into making your decision? Do you always choose that type? Did you research what the final evolutions look like? Or do you just go with your gut based on how they look and behave?
Let us know if you&#x27;re kicking off your Paldea region adventure with Sprigatito, Quaxly, or Fuecoco in the comments below!</span>

A brazen move, but one where risks and privacy were carefully considered.

                              <span>Perfectly level flying is the supreme challenge of the scale-model pilot
Sky Odyssey was a community recommendation from way, way back. Since then, I’ve had it earmarked, and I’m not sure why it’s taken me so long to get around to it. It was pitched to me as “like Pilotwings,” and I’m an absolute sucker for Pilotwings. As it turns out, it’s an apt comparison. It feels like the logical conclusion to the original SNES title’s fixed-wing biplane challenges.
I’m also something of a fan of flight sims, but have you noticed that there’s a dearth of arcade flight simulators? There are plenty of games about spitting ordinance at other aviators and many about just flying, but why am I not seeking out treasure or being encouraged to fly recklessly? A game that’s like, “there’s a massive storm; why n…</span>

                              <span>This year&#x27;s Call of Duty is sleeker than most
The last few months of 2022 have been absolutely insane when it comes to game releases, so it’s been really telling of which games I’ve enjoyed the most based on what I’ve been drawn to playing these days. Even with newly-dropped titles like Overwatch 2 and God of War Ragnarok, I find myself going back to Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II over and over again. 
I’m relatively new to the Call of Duty series, having picked it up with Cold War for the first time a few years ago with encouragement from a friend. Now CoD has basically become part of my daily routine, even if it’s just for a few rounds of Domination on my lunch break.
I know that some of my opinions about the series tend to clash with long-time fans, but I’ve actually enjoyed jumping in…</span>

Everybody&#x27;s favorite spoilers, The Taiwan Game Rating Committee, has uploaded a new listing pointing to as yet unannounced console ports of Sega&#x27;s Company of Heroes 3 —The strategy sequel is currently in development for PC, and is scheduled for launch in February 2023.
According to the new rating, (as spotted by Gematsu)  Company of Heroes 3 will be getting ported to ninth-gen platforms PS5 and Xbox Series X, though there is no suggestion these console ports will arrive alongside their PC brethren. Still, it&#x27;s a snug suggestion that console players will be joining the war effort sooner rather than later, and most assuredly in 2023.
The newest entry in the acclaimed strategy series, Company of Heroes 3 will task armchair generals with guiding their highly trained platoons through the North African theater of war. The sequel boasts a new &quot;dynamic&quot; campaign mode, that will adjust itself for multiple playthroughs with a sandbox approach to its tactical action. The &quot;Essence&quot; engine will bring levels of environmental destructibility yet to be experienced in the series, while a battalion of new units and vehicles will be sure to keep fans grinding out epic battle into the midnight hour and beyond.
We will be sure to let you know should official word of the console ports be forthcoming.
Company of Heroes 3 launches February 23 on PC via Steam.

                              <span>Y&#x27;all here for Prehistory Rogue?
Netflix has released a fun new trailer for its upcoming animated series Sonic Prime — And this particular preview has more than a hint of Multiverse Madness about it, as The Blue Blur finds himself hopping through time and space to confront wild variants of his friends, enemies, and worlds.
Over the course of the two-minute preview Sonic blasts through past and future universes, each filled with its own unique hazards and dangers. But the real meat of the clip comes from the cool array of alternate pals that appear in the mix, from cybernetic versions of Tails and Amy Rose, to special forces variants of Knuckles and Rogue, and no less than five different Dr. Robotniks. My favorite is Prehistory Rogue, who confronts our hero accompanied by your favorite, Big the Cat.

Produced by Canadian Studio WildBrain (Carmen Sandiego, My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic) and American producer Man of Action (Ultimate Spider-Man, Mega Man: Fully Charged), Sonic Prime promises 24 episodes of Gotta Go Fast action, featuring all of the characters both recognizable, (and, apparently, unrecognizable), from Sega&#x27;s smash-hit video game franchise. Our lad Sonic has frequently proved himself a snug fit for animated antics, and hopefully, this new show will be no different.
Sonic Prime premieres exclusively on Netflix on December 15. Back in the digital world, Sonic Frontiers is available now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.

If you&#x27;ve lived and breathed Pokémon since you were kid, it’s easy to forget just how many Pokémon games have released since 1996. Even if you don’t count any spinoff titles and lump all dual releases together (ie Red and Blue), you still have over 20 games to choose from. If you can’t count the entries in a series on your fingers and toes, there are officially too many for a new person to consider.
Fortunately, the Pokémon formula is so timeless that virtually every mainline game is a good starting point. That said, the series has plenty of peaks and valleys, and some of those peaks are truly spectacular. For those looking for the best Pokémon game to start with, or for longtime fans considering which entry to replay, here are the five best Pokém…</span>

Right on schedule, Epic Games Store has revealed the next title that it will be offering up to all of its users gratis in the coming week — And it looks like we&#x27;re headed to a galaxy far, far away, with the arrival of Electronic Arts space flight dogfighter Star Wars Squadrons, available to download next week.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;nCcfJ9uEwvs
Developed by EA Motive and released on PC and consoles in the fall of 2020, Star Wars Squadrons is a dogfighter that aims to capture the majesty, splendor and visual style of the iconic movie series. Boasting an original storyline set after the events of Return of the Jedi, Star Wars Squadrons puts players in dual roles as members of both The New Republic and The Galactic Empire, both of which are tasked with the creation or destruction of a devastating new vessel known as Project Starhawk.
Star Wars Squadrons features a full story campaign as well as several multiple modes, and allows players to pilot an array of famous ships such as the X-Wing, the B-Wing, the TIE Fighter, and the TIE Bomber. Stars Wars Squadrons received moderate praise for its visuals and authenticity to the Star Wars universe, though some lauded the title&#x27;s unfulfilling &quot;work against yourself&quot; story mode, as well as a general lack of content.
Star Wars Squadrons is available to download from Epic Games Store on November 24. Until then, users can still bag themselves current freebies Evil Dead: The Game and Dark Deity.

Pokemon games have a long line of lengthy tutorials, and given how much stuff is packed into Scarlet and Violet, the new generation isn&#x27;t shying away from that formula.
Alright, so I used a stopwatch to time my copy of Pokemon Scarlet as soon as I was done creating my character, up until the point where most people would consider the tutorial fully done: and came up with one hour and 45 minutes until I had full open world access.

Here&#x27;s what the Pokemon Scarlet and Violet tutorial fully entails:

Japanese studio MOSS has released a new gameplay trailer for its upcoming release Raiden III x MIKADO Maniax — the flashy, remixed edition of the stellar 2005 arcade shmup Raiden III. 
Raiden III x MIKADO Maniax is a revisioning of MOSS&#x27; adrenaline-pumping classic, kitted out with new modes and features and sporting an entirely new score composed by a who&#x27;s who of Japanese electronic artists. Among the musicians featured in the new release are GoSatoBan, Heavy Metal Raiden, Fantom Iris, O.T.K., Soshi Hosoi, Daisuke Matsumoto, Cosio, Keishi Yonao, Ryu☆, Raito, and Yu Shimoda — performing a total of 20 new stage and boss battle themes.

Away from the block-rockin&#x27; beats, the remix includes several new features including monitor orientation options, online rankings, and the ability to upload your latest run to an online server, for viewing by the Raiden community. Alongside a standard and remixed edition of the original arcade mode, MIKADO Maniax also includes Score Attack and Boss Rush modes, as well as a beginner-friendly hitbox, to help newer players learn the geometry of the game&#x27;s challenging patterns.
Raiden III x MIKADO Maniax launches in Japan, February 23, on PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms. There is currently no word on a western release, although the previousRaiden x Mikado title did get a localization, so hold fire for now.

                              <span>Sale news from you-know-know
[Update: The PlayStation Plus sale is now live, with a catalog of discounted games and the 12-month PlayStation Plus offer. The sale will end November 28.]
The dedicated king of PlayStation Plus leaks, Dealabs author billbil-kun, has suggested that the black-and-blue brand is preparing to offer a meaty 25% discount on its range of PS Plus paid subscription services — The discount is expected to arrive as part of the forthcoming Black Friday madness.
According to the veteran PS leaker, PlayStation users will be able to pick up 12-month PlayStation Plus Essential, Extra, and Premium subscriptions at a quarter of their original price, provided that they are bagged between November 18-28. As a quick refresher, Essential offers monthly free titles and online capabilities, Extra throws in access to a catalog of rotating titles, while Premium users also receive access to the PlayStation Classics range, as well as exclusive demos and trials.
With a 25% discount included, PlayStation owners can expect the following prices in the rumored offer:
PlayStation Plus Essential (12 Month) - $44.99 / €44.99 / £37.49
PlayStation Plus Extra (12 Month) – $74.99 / €74.99 / £62.99
PlayStation Plus Premium (12 Month) – $89.99 / €89.99 / £74.99
Admittedly, in financially tough times such as these, 80 buckeroos for a gaming subscription is still a pretty hefty ask. But if you&#x27;re the type of player to burn through games with reckless abandon, then having access to a constantly rotating catalog of releases across 2023 will, ultimately, pay for itself.
Of course, there is no official word the deal is definitely happening. But, given Dealabs consistent accuracy when revealing PlayStation Plus titles, this Black Friday discount rumor can probably be filed under &quot;concrete&quot;.

                              <span>The spring of 2023, specifically
So now that Pokemon Scarlet and Violet are in full swing, people are going to want to transfer all of their old characters in. Well, you&#x27;ll have to hold off on that! That functionality isn&#x27;t coming until roughly mid-2023.
Here&#x27;s the full confirmation of when Scarlet and Violet are getting Home support
So over on the game&#x27;s official site, The Pokemon Company says that support will be coming &quot;in spring 2023.&quot; It&#x27;s important to remember that this will only include &quot;select Pokemon from past games&quot; as well. Here&#x27;s the disclaimer: &quot;Note: The Pokemon you’ll be able transfer to each game via Pokemon HOME are limited to Pokemon that can appear in those games. Please look out for more information about which Pokemon will be available in Pokemon Scarlet and Pokemon Violet.&quot;
Before then, there is something coming sooner. That same post explains that in &quot;early 2023,&quot; the pair of games are getting &quot;Battle Stadium statistics&quot; support: &quot;From the app, you’ll be able to view information about Trainer rankings, frequently used Pokémon, Online Competitions, and more. You’ll also be able to see what moves, Abilities, and held items are being used in battles the most.&quot;
It&#x27;s unfortunate that the rollout is so far away, but it also allows for some time for the current generation to marinate and sink in, without tons of different metas emerging. Its also plenty of leeway to get a full living Pokedex in Scarlet and Violet.

Yuji Naka, the co-creator of Sonic the Hedgehog franchise, has reportedly been arrested in Japan as part of an investigation into an insider trading scheme at Square Enix. According to Japanese news site FNN Prime Online, Naka is one of a handful of individuals singled out by the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors’ Office Investigation Department.
Yesterday, Japanese officials detained two Square Enix employees, named as Taisuke Sazaki and Fumiaki Suzuki, for allegedly purchasing major stock shares in studio Aiming, right before the announcement of mobile title Dragon Quest: Tact. It is reported by FNN Prime that Sazaki and Fumiaki acquired around ¥47 million (roughly $336,300 USD) of shares in lieu of the announcement of the game&#x27;s develo…</span>

                              <span>Let the anime OVA take you away
Armello studio League of Geeks announced another new project today, this time turning to the stars for inspiration. Jumplight Odyssey is a new spaceship management sim, set to hit PC sometime in 2023.
Revealed during today&#x27;s PC Gaming Show 2023 Preview, the trailer has a vibe that will undoubtedly make some viewers nostalgic. As Princess Euphora watches the evil general annihilate the fleet, the crew jets off into space, seeking salvation at the Forever Star with a plucky crew, hanging by a thread.

If you&#x27;re reminded of the days of &#x27;70s anime, that&#x27;s not an accident. League of Geeks specifically cites Star Blazers, the animated adaptation of anime series Space Battleship Yamato, as an inspiration. And according to the Steam page, there may be some smooth &#x27;70s Tokyo disco in the mix, too.
Fly me to the moon
While the trailer gives a good look at the style, inspiration, and setting for this adventure, the Steam page holds some more info on the actual gameplay of this &quot;FTL-meets-Star Blazers&quot; hybrid.
As the captain escaping the warmongering Zutopans, you&#x27;ll have to keep the starship running while making your way to the Forever Star. This means managing needs, repairing damage, and keeping an eye on those aboard the ship.

Crewmates can act out a sort of &quot;floating melodrama&quot; thanks to their moods, allowing relationships and incidents to arise. Keep Hope alive, literally, and it&#x27;ll keep your boat afloat.
Different biomes and hazards, emergent disasters, and hostile ships all act to keep you from your goal. But this seems like a cool mix of spaceship sim and management, with an infectious nostalgia for the classics. Alongside League of Geeks&#x27; other project, a remake of Solium Infernum, the team is putting together some great-looking throwbacks. Here&#x27;s hoping they both stick the landing next year.

It&#x27;s that time of year again -- the Game Awards nominations are finally out. As expected, the year&#x27;s biggest AAA titles like God of War Ragnarok, Elden Ring, and Horizon Forbidden West dominate in a lot of the major categories, and while it&#x27;s not controversial to assume that one of those is going to take home the grand prize of Game of the Year, it&#x27;s the Best Narrative nominations that are stirring up the Discourse this time around.
The full list of Best Narrative nominees includes Ragnarok, Elden Ring, Forbidden West, A Plague Tale: Requiem, and Immortality. It&#x27;s a reasonable-yet-predictable list, but regardless, fans are up in arms about Elden Ring and God of War in particular. There are a lot of different takes going on here, so I&#x27;ll…</span>

Pentiment is out this week for PC and Xbox, and it sounds like that might not have happened if not for Xbox Game Pass. In a new interview with Waypoint, director Josh Sawyer says he wouldn&#x27;t have proposed the project without Game Pass as a factor.
&quot;I never would have proposed making Pentiment without Game Pass,&quot; said Sawyer. &quot;Like, I literally just wouldn&#x27;t have done it. I just don&#x27;t think it would have been possible.&quot;
Host Rob Zacny follows up, asking whether that was because it would have been shot down or akin to sending developers on a sure-to-fail mission. Sawyer elaborates, mentioning the &quot;old mentality&quot; of focusing on larger teams and larger investment for a higher ROI (return on investment).

                              <span>Anyone who&#x27;s had to physically stop me from banging on about Black Sails will confirm that I love a bit of piracy. Games mostly don&#x27;t do it justice at all, either making &quot;piracy&quot; shorthand for &quot;mindless omnicide for no reason&quot; or slapping a parroty theme onto a generic action game.
Buccaneers! isn&#x27;t primarily a piracy game, but they&#x27;re one of its four factions. It doesn’t try to be more than a naval combat and light action RPG either, let alone the “real” pirate game I dearly want, but I can’t hold that against it either.  If I was being reductive, I&#x27;d call it a budget hybrid of Sea Of Thieves and Sid Meier&#x27;s Pirates By Sid Meier Aged 33 And 3/4. It&#x27;s probably unfair to set such high expectations, but the core design is compelling and enjoyable enough to merit it.

I came for the game’s resemblance to the art style from the funny books, but stayed because of its similarity to Kirkman’s excellent characterisation and shocking brutality. We are the Walking Dead, indeed. Telltale demonstrated they understood that from the start of this series.

Until then, you can play with your boomstick in co-op multiplayer schlockfest Evil Dead: The Game, and there&#x27;s tactical role-player Dark Deity too.

                              <span>At some point since I played Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man Remastered, a switch has flipped in me; I have gone from having stepped off the MCU train, content to watch it chug off into the distance with its remaining passengers, to actively wishing for its violent derailment. I&#x27;m saying this to emphasise that I loathe singiing the praises of anything even tangentially related to Marvel, without also revealing that I have stashed a steel chair and bag of thumbtacks under the ring as a surprise attack against Kevin Feige.
Spider-Man is about as Marvel-related as you can get. I said back when the remaster of Insomniac&#x27;s first Spider-Man game came to PC that the reason to not buy it was that Miles Morales was coming to PC in a few months. A few months has become now. And I must own that Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man: Miles Morales is a good game. It&#x27;s a big, bold action adventure full of heroics and quips, and it&#x27;s still the better Spider-Man game. I think a large part of that is because it&#x27;s shorter.

                              <span>I came, I saw, I claimed some free DLC. That’s probably what Julius Caesar would say about being given away for Sid Meier’s Civilization 6, right? Well, whatever his nibs might think about the offer, you’ll be able to pick him up for nowt from November 21st. There’s only one catch, and that’s needing to link your 2K account on Steam or the Epic Games Store. Have a watch of the trailer below to see what ol’ leaf-ears has to offer your Romans.

                              <span>For somehow the second time in my life, I recently found myself in deeply urgent need of a 4K gaming monitor. An RTX 4090 review deadline was rapidly approaching, any suitably UHD-specced loaner monitors I could use for testing had been sent back, and my backup – a nasty little 60Hz screen – wasn’t going to cut it. Unwilling to prostrate myself for another loan model and reluctant to burn such a vast hole in RPS’s expenses budget, I elected for the fastest, easiest option of just buying one myself.

In particular, Zarya’s particle barrier duration has been reduced, so you should have an easier team taking her on in future. Blizzard announced there’d be a delay to the balance adjustment update earlier this week, which had been scheduled for November 15th.

Naka is alleged to have bought around 10,000 shares in Dragon Quest Tact developers Aiming back in 2020 for ¥2.8 million (£16,800). At that point, Naka was still working with Square Enix on Balan Wonderworld.

It’s the first time we’ve got anything close to a glimpse of the remake, still in its early prototyping stage, could look like. The seven slices of concept art were shown as part of Splinter Cell’s 20th anniversary.

That drops it £73, a terrific deal on a PSU that can handle anything up to (and including) an RTX 4090. We actually covered this power supply last month, when I was surprised to learn it had dropped to £90 after weeks of costing more than £100 in the crypto-boom era. Now it&#x27;s even cheaper, and that makes our recommendation stronger than ever.

                              <span>Last week when launching the AMD EPYC 9004 &quot;Genoa&quot; processors, AMD released AOCC 4.0 as the newest version of their optimizing C/C++ compiler that now supports their Zen 4 micro-architecture. Last week I ran some initial AOCC 4.0 benchmarks and this LLVM/Clang downstream was looking rather favorable in relation to upstream LLVM/Clang, while since then I&#x27;ve been able to conduct more thorough benchmarks across a wide variety of C/C++ open-source workloads. Here is that more extensive round of AOCC 4.0 benchmarking against the open-source LLVM/Clang and AOCC compilers.</span>

Druhé vydání aktualizuje původní verzi, odstraňuje zastaralé informace a přidává aktualizované snímky obrazovky a nové informace o tématech, jako jsou kódy pro tvarování písma Harfbuzz, export do formátů EPUB pro čtečky, rozšíření Zotero pro bibliografie a Angry Reviewer, rozšíření podobné Grammarly pro úpravu dikce. V budoucnu autoři plánují vydávat další vydání podle potřeby, aby byla kniha Designing s LibreOffice aktuální.

Gearbox were previously the publisher of Risk Of Rain 2 and say they are &quot;eager to prove ourselves as worthy custodians&quot; of the series. They bought the IP from original developers Hopoo Games, who say they won&#x27;t be doing any more work on the series.

Except, this isn&#x27;t turn-based strategy, but a proper CRPG from the makers of the recent, well-liked Pathfinder games. Its first gameplay trailer awaits below.

Shadows Of Doubt has also fought my skepticism so far with playable demos and, now, a new official trailer. It sure looks like it&#x27;s doing the thing.

                              <span>Hot on the heels of their Solium Infernum announcement at the end of September, the studio behind strategy RPG Armello have announced another new game they&#x27;re working on during tonight&#x27;s PC Gaming Show Preview stream. It&#x27;s called Jumplight Odyssey (or &quot;J-Lo&quot; for short, as League Of Geeks studio director and co-founder Trent Kusters affectionately referred to it during an early preview presentation I attended last week), and it&#x27;s a starship roguelite colony sim that has big 70s anime vibes. Specifically, Star Blazers, the English adaptation of Leiji Matsumoto&#x27;s seminal Space Battleship Yamato, with which Jumplight shares a lot of its core visual DNA. 
In it, you play as Princess Euphora, who&#x27;s on a mission to save her people from the space conquering Zutopans, jumping from planet to planet in search of their Forever Star. It&#x27;s not due to arrive in early access until sometime next year, but I&#x27;ve seen a sneak peek of it running in an early alpha build, and lemme tell ya. FTL, Rimworld and Two Point Hospital likers (bear with me on that last one) are going to want to take note of this.

                              <span>Ever had a real-life experience where you’re something like 90% sure you’re actually in a horror film? Answers in the comments, please. Now, imagine that, but also someone asks you to pop your phone in a lockbox, you know, for safekeeping. Also, they say something like “You won’t need it where we’re going” and then do a murder wink at an imaginary camera. Something quite similar to this happens to our ill-fated documentary crew early in The Devil In Me. &#x27;Aha!&#x27; I thought. Supermassive are being knowingly, playfully tropey again. Great. These games are best when they lean into the cheese like a drunk buffet guest, and I was pumped to watch it stumble around a schlocky murder party and get baked brie all over the elbows of its best tux.
For those yet to stick their snout into Supermassive’s truffle-trove of horror offerings, the basic premise of these narrative adventure games can best be summarised: What if shouting at the screen to try and stop idiot characters performing horror film no-nos actually worked? The formula was both invented and, miraculously, perfected in 2015’s Until Dawn. Since then, the studio have released three ‘episodic’ (although narratively independent) Dark Pictures titles, and The Quarry, all of which can best be summarised: Like Until Dawn, but not as good.

                              <span>Look, we can all agree that Spore is not quite the game it could have been. In terms of the different eras that you coach your little creature species through, the game peaks early on in the cell stage. After that, everything goes a little downhill. But I&#x27;ll tell you what: I&#x27;ve never, ever been so excited for a game to release, and I don&#x27;t think I ever will again. I was losing sleep over it. And there&#x27;s one simple reason: the Creature Creator.

                              <span>I’m always amazed by the Minecraft building community. We’ve seen the likes of Tolkien’s Middle-earth, Breath Of The Wild, Disneyland, Game of Thrones&#x27; Westeros, and the Star Wars universe all built block by block - and that’s only a short list of what you can find online. The creations you can find are honestly kind of amazing, and Minecraft builders are constantly putting out new masterpieces for fellow Minecrafters and non-crafters to oggle at all year round.

Upcoming hunting game Wild Hearts is packing plenty of what devs Omega Force are calling Karakuri, the magical flat-pack wooden kit the game’s warriors use to battle the various beasties in their fantasy take on medieval Japan. You can get a glimpse of some of the Karakuri battles that Wild Hearts contains in the trailer below, including a rather awesome looking monocycle and a furious monkey with a very nasty skin condition.

That&#x27;s the premise of The Banished Vault, an upcoming strategy game announced this week. You&#x27;ll flee from solar system to solar system in a mobile monastery megacity, trying desperately to scavenge what you can before an all-annihilating pursuer catches up. The Banished Vault is the first game on the new indie publishing label of Bithell Games, but more interesting to me is that it&#x27;s coming from the designer of Sun Dogs.

Treyarch Studios have tweeted to announce that the Call Of Duty League Moshpit playlist mode is delayed due to some recently discovered issues. The Black Ops Cold War devs did say it would only be a “slight delay”, though, and that they’d provide an update on when the mode would be active as soon as they could.

But not to worry, because The Electronic Wireless Show podcast has collected some of the best games for having a virtual stare, so you can do it from the comfort of your own home.
This does necessitate us defining wistful first, although honestly I think I nail it out of the gate. Nate also provides this week&#x27;s Cavern Of Lies mini-game, and a) he nearly beats me but b) he&#x27;d never heard of Thomas Was Alone, which is pretty funny.

                              <span>There’ll be no more Overwatch 2 and World Of Warcraft in mainland China from January 23rd, 2023, Blizzard and NetEase have announced. Those are among the games that NetEase have handled publishing for within the country, but the two companies have failed to reach an agreement to extend their deal. To add insult to injury, NetEase’s president Simon Zhu has taken to LinkedIn to blame “a jerk” for the deal’s collapse.

                              <span>A short teaser for the next horror game in Supermassive’s The Dark Pictures Anthology series has emerged on YouTube. Called Directive 8020, it seems like this one is going full sci-fi and heading all the way into outer space, Event Horizon style. The teaser video seems to have been taken from the end of an advance copy of its predecessor The Devil In Me, which is released tomorrow so keep your eyes peeled for our review. Supermassive will likely follow up with an official teaser after The Devil In Me&#x27;s out. You can watch the leaked teaser below, if you’re not spooked by the possibility of spoilers.

Bethesda tweeted their statement last night, calling Gordon’s lengthy post explaining his experience working on Doom Eternal’s soundtrack &quot;a one-sided and unjust account of an irreparable professional relationship”. Gordon had replied to an open letter published on Reddit by id Software executive producer Marty Stratton, more than two years after Stratton’s letter was posted online.

Both are incredibly good value after today&#x27;s discounts, and well worth taking a look at if you&#x27;re in the market for a monitor upgrade!

And hey, if it happens inside Teams, no one can deny it&#x27;s work. If anything, you&#x27;re engaging with the business experience even harder. Be sure to mention that in your annual performance review.

Sometimes, when a new Pokémon game nears, questions loom. Pokémon are mysterious creatures. Where do they come from? What are their natures? Why do professors send children out into the world on unpaid scientific internships and have them participate in illicit, unethical animal fights?
Well, instead of doing that last part, here at Destructoid we usually turn to Occams for answers about Pokémon instead, via the encyclopedic Occamsdex. It&#x27;s better than getting arrested for unpaid child labor and/or creating a new Micheal Vick.
And thus, we asked the Destructoid community to submit Pokémon for his judgment once more!

                              <span>Take a trip down to the bayou
NORCO was one of my favorite games of 2022, with an eerie tone, surreal visuals, and a setting that has some of the most profound political commentary I&#x27;ve seen from a game of late. It&#x27;s a must-play if you like story-driven games or point and click adventures, and it&#x27;s honestly a crime that it wasn&#x27;t nominated for Best Narrative at the Game Awards, because the writing is absolutely gorgeous. NORCO has been out since March, but the game&#x27;s developer Geography of Robots just announced today via Twitter that the southern gothic adventure is now available to play on PlayStation and Xbox consoles.
Naturally, the game&#x27;s controls were entirely reworked for controller instead of mouse and keyboard, and the devs also confirmed in the Twitter thread that the PC version of the game also has controller support now. They even included a helpful graphic that breaks down how the control scheme will work on a PlayStation Dualshock. Basically, you can either use the left stick as a virtual mouse, or simply use the D-pad to select &quot;hotspots or other UI elements.&quot; Big win for controller simps like me.
https://twitter.com/roboticgeo/status/1593265507939098625
For those who may not know what to expect from NORCO&#x27;s gameplay, Geography of Robots describes it pretty well in yet another tweet:
&quot;Gameplay-wise, it resembles classic first-person text-based pixel adventures like Snatcher, Deja Vu, Policenauts, VA-11 HA-11 A, Read Only Memories, Circuit&#x27;s Edge, Rise of the Dragon, etc. There are also combat minigames. You can automate them if you want.&quot;
NORCO is one of those games that I enjoyed so much that I want to buy it on another platform, and I have to admit I&#x27;m enticed by the idea of playing it on a bigger screen. Regardless of any awards, it&#x27;s one of the most stylish, thoughtful indie games of recent memory, and I think in the long run, it&#x27;ll stick around.

                              <span>Speed Demons
Atlus has released a brand new update for its stylish Shin Megami Tensei spin-off, Soul Hackers 2 — Now available to download on all platforms, the new patch adds four new demons to the mix, and includes several new abilities to help slim down that all-consuming time-grind.
The new &quot;Dash&quot; toggle will although players to control Ringo at a much-accelerated rate, helping her to negotiate the monster-infested labyrinths with speed, and even performing her standard &quot;slash&quot; in double-quick time. This new speed increase can also be applied to battles themselves, with a &quot;Speed Up&quot; toggle allowing for quick and easy carvings in face-to-face encounters. Hopefully, these two new additions will make grinding for XP less of a chore.

Four new demons have been added to the Soul Hackers 2 roster via this new update. The demons are the fiery Aitvaras, the stoic priestess Isis, the frankly bizarre Neko Shotgun, and the hyper-iconic Pixie — depicted in her original Devil Summoner form. It should be noted that acquiring these new demons does not count toward the in-game Registration Percentage of the Demon Compendium, nor its associated achievements or trophies.
Finally, a small run of tweaks and bug fixes should improve loading times across the board, while other changes streamline the shop experience, and include new preventative measures to stop button mashers from accidentally selecting the wrong options while plowing through the game&#x27;s many menu screens. Huh, an update that asks you to take your time AND speed up.
Soul Hackers 2 is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

A headwind approaches, as Pokemon Scarlet and Violet arrive on the Nintendo Switch on Friday, November 18. It&#x27;s one of the last major releases of 2022, and in my mind, arguably the biggest last release of 2022.
Just Dance 2023 is going for a sort of counter-programming angle too, as it drops on November 22. Then there&#x27;s Bravery and Greed, as well as Finding Paradise, to round out the week. Oh, and a ton of other stuff too.

Sonic The Hedgehog. One of the most iconic video game characters ever created. He runs at the speed of sound, saves animals from robots, and best of all, he’s colored blue and has been in legitimately fantastic games. Though the blue blur is nowadays pretty synonymous with surreal internet memes, it’s important to remember the classic titles that made him the icon he is today.
For example, consider our list of the top 5 Sonic The Hedgehog games ever released.

Game studio Volition is about to fall under the umbrella of a new publisher, as Embracer Group has announced that the Saints Row developer is to make a side-step from being a subsidiary of Deep Silver to become a subsidiary of Gearbox Entertainment.
Embracer Group, (which owns all of the above), made the announcement in a quarterly financial report.
&quot;Going forward, Volition will transition to become part of Gearbox which has all the tools, including an experienced management team in the United States, to create future success at Volition,&quot; declared Embracer in the report. &quot;This is the first internal group transfer where we transfer a major studio between operative groups, but it is not necessarily the last.&quot;

                              <span>Glory to the button mashers
Capcom has given players their first in-depth look at the recently revealed &quot;Dynamic&quot; control option for upcoming sequel Street Fighter 6 — A new trailer demonstrates the ingenious new mechanic in action, which will open up the floor for both the casual and/or younger player.
As we have previously reported, the SF6 Dynamic controls use A.I. to gauge the situation and apply one-button combos as they best fit the situation. Thus, button mashes can land decent combos from jump-ins and at close range, while applying pressure with projectiles and other moves from range. The system will adjust to the opponent&#x27;s position, offering up attack strings as best fit the present state.

Obviously, such a system would be a bit of an advantage in online play, (although, frankly, a great player could probably still defend against it with ease), ad so Dynamic controls will be locked to offline play only. But for family feuds, drunken slap fights, or just getting together with friends for a quick mash fest, Dynamic controls represents one more way that Street Fighter 6 is going above and beyond to be one of the most accessible and playable series entries for every fighter who wants to step into the ring.
Now, can we please have a few more character trailers?.. Pretty please?

                              <span>We have a &quot;winter&quot; and &quot;spring&quot; update planned so far
Yesterday, Capcom unveiled some details for &quot;Title Update 3,&quot; which will be arriving in Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak later this month. There&#x27;s a lot of interesting stuff in there (that you can read about here!), but the publisher also managed to tease out future content as well.
At the end of their Title Update 3 video, Capcom gave us insight into what the future of Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak will entail. Following Free Title Update 3, we&#x27;re moving on to Free Title Update 4, which is in &quot;winter&quot; of 2023 (so before the end of Q1). It&#x27;s billed as &quot;version .14,&quot; and includes an Elder Dragon appearance, as well as a &quot;powered-up monster.&quot; No doubt there will be more paid DLC, tweaks, and quality of life changes too.
After that, we got a second tease for a &quot;spring&quot; 2023 update, which is predictably called Free Title Update 5 (version .15). No broad details were given about it, but it&#x27;ll likely include content similar to what we&#x27;ve seen in the past.
I&#x27;m glad that this model still exists, as live service games with paid season passes dominate the landscape. While the practice isn&#x27;t necessarily bad if done correctly: publishers can&#x27;t help themselves, and screw up decent games beyond recognition because of the monetiaztion model. Keeping Rise as a premium game with an expansion and free title updates has maintained its general quality.

Following on from this morning&#x27;s extraordinary news that Blizzard Entertainment is to suspend service of its games in China, the president of Chinese publishing partner NetEase has blasted the World of Warcraft developer for its role in the breakdown of contract negotiations.
Speaking very candidly on LinkedIn, Simon Zhu, spoke of his disappointment with the separation, stating that he himself had spent &quot;10,000 hours&quot; playing Blizzard games and claiming that he was &quot;heartbroken&quot; not only for himself, but for &quot;all of the players who lived in those worlds&quot;. Most pointedly, Zhu singles out an unnamed &quot;jerk&quot; at Activision Blizzard for, in Zhu&#x27;s opinion, causing damage to the relationship.
&quot;As a gamer who spent 10,000 hours in the world of Azeroth, Starcraft and Overwatch, I feel so heartbroken as I will no longer have the access to my account and memories next year,&quot; began Zhu. &quot;One day, when what has happened behind the scene could be told, developers and gamers will have a whole new level [of] understanding of how much damage a jerk can make.&quot;
&quot;Feel terrible for players who lived in those worlds.&quot;
As we reported earlier, Blizzard Entertainment will suspend service to its range of IPs in the China region, formerly distributed by NetEase. This includes hugely popular titles such as World of Warcraft, StarCraft, Diablo, Hearthstone, and Overwatch. It has since been confirmed that mobile title Diablo: Immortal falls under a separate contract and will continue to be distributed by NetEase.
Blizzard Entertainment is currently looking for a new partner to carry its products in the very financially lucrative territory in the future.

However, based on details laid out in the criminal complaint against two alleged operators, security wasn&#x27;t high on the list of priorities. With search warrants directed at Google and Amazon, it wasn&#x27;t hard for the FBI to connect the dots.

                              <span>Ubisoft celebrated Spinter Cell’s 20th anniversary by releasing a new video reflecting on the series and discussing its upcoming remake. The video revealed some details on the project’s status as well as some early images. 


The Splinter Cell remake was first announced last December, but we’ve known very little about it other than it’s being rebuilt from scratch in Snowdrop Engine (used to make The Division, Mario + Rabbids games). In the video, the team states the experience will be identical to the 2002 title but it wants to implement improvements and features introduced in later Splinter Cell titles as well as smooth some rough edges. For example, the team wants to give players more opportunities to de-escalate situations when things go awry instead of getting an instant Game Over. 
The dev team also shares that the project is still in the early prototyping phase. As such, the studio will be going dark “for a while” to focus on making the game, so it will likely be a good while before we hear anything substantial about the remake again. In the meantime, you can take a look at the gallery of new concept images shared during the presentation below. 

Splinter Cell doesn’t have a release window or announced platforms. This remake is only one of many on the horizon, and you can keep up with all of them by checking our big list of upcoming video game remakes.</span>

                              <span>Trinity Fusion is an upcoming futuristic sci-fi action-roguelite that looks great, and its first closed beta begins today. 
Developer Angry Mob Games announced today that you can sign up for the beta right now, which will run through November 24. If you don&#x27;t make it into this round of playtesting, don&#x27;t worry – you might get an invite to access the second closed beta beginning December 6. It will run until December 13. Before signing up, though, check out the Trinity Fusion reveal trailer below: 


As you can see, Trinity Fusion looks like a fun and stylish take on the ever-growing roguelite genre, bringing some Strider vibes with a dash of Trine in there too. 
&quot;Set across three shattered versions of the game&#x27;s world, Trinity Fusion casts players in the role of the Hitchhiker, a cross-dim…</span>

                              <span>Update, 11/17/2022:
Earlier this year, Supermassive Games filed multiple trademarks for new games that many predicted were part of its Dark Pictures anthology series. One of those games was Directive 8020 and now, with the latest anthology game, The Devil In Me, out tomorrow, it&#x27;s been confirmed that Directive 8020 is up next. It will be the Season 2 premiere of The Dark Pictures series. 
This news comes by way of GameTrailers, who spotted the teaser trailer for Directive 8020 as part of The Devil In Me&#x27;s release, keeping in tradition with the latest game teasing the next game, as reported by Destructoid.
Check out the teaser trailer for The Dark Pictures: Directive 8020 for yourself below: 


As you can see, Directive 8020 will be the series&#x27; first forray into sci-fi horror, and it seems …</span>

                              <span>Saints Row, a reboot for the series, was released back in August and while some players were happy with the end result, others were not. And now, due to Saints Row failing to meet the full expectations of Embracer Group, developer Volition will become part of Gearbox Entertainment. 
This news comes by way of Video Games Chronicle, which reports that Embracer CEO Lars Wingefors discussed this transition in a statement released alongside the company&#x27;s second-quarter earning results. 


&quot;The reception of Saints Row did not meet the full expectations and left the fanbase partially polarized,&quot; Wingefores said in the statement. &quot;The game development studio, Volition, has been working hard to improve the player experience. Financially, Saints Row has performed in line with management expectations in the quarter. Going forward, Volition will transition to become part of Gearbox which has all the tools, including an experienced management team in the US, to create future success at Volition.&quot;
Wingefors notes that this is the first time the company has performed an &quot;internal group transfer where we transfer a major studio between operative groups,&quot; but says that &quot;it is not necessarily the last.&quot; 
Saints Row currently sits at 61 on Metacritic (for the PlayStation 5 version), with a user score of 2.1. Game Informer gave the game an 8.5 out of 10 in its review and you can read what we liked about Saints Row here.

                              <span>Dead Island 2 has been delayed to April. 
Originally due out on February 3, this upcoming zombie romp will now hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC on April 28. It&#x27;s a delay of roughly 12 weeks, which isn&#x27;t too much longer considering fans have been waiting close to a decade for this sequel. As for why developer Dambuster Studios and publisher Deep Silver have delayed Dead Island 2, the team wants more time to ensure the game is the best it can be at launch. 
Here&#x27;s the full statement on the delay: 
While waiting to learn more about the game next month, watch the Dead Island 2 re-reveal trailer from earlier this summer and then watch our exclusive interview with the devs about the game&#x27;s procedurally generated gore system.

                              <span>Pokémon Scarlet and Violet hit store shelves and the Switch eShop tomorrow. Chances are, you&#x27;re seeing some reviews pop up right about now. While we would love to be one of those reviews, we&#x27;re not quite ready to publish our final verdict for a couple of reasons. First, the online servers are not yet available, and with four-player co-op serving as a big addition to the series, we want to fully test it out before delivering our review. I also just want a tad more time with the game before slapping a score on it; I&#x27;ve finished most of the main story, but I haven&#x27;t fully explored the end and post-game content. 
However, now that the review embargo is up, I can provide my full impressions before publishing my final review. I&#x27;m generally positive about Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. These are goo…</span>

                              <span>Mechanical keyboards are brilliant. If you agree, you probably have one on your desk right now - and we have just the deal for you. SteelSeries&#x27; PrismCaps are an awesome upgrade over your stock keycaps, offering high-quality PBT construction, backlit legends and a beautiful two-tone &#x27;pudding cup&#x27; design that looks great, especially with an RGB keyboard. 
Normally a full keycap set of PrismCaps will cost you $30, but as an early Black Friday deal you can find these keycaps for 50% off - just $15. At that price, these are in impulse buy territory for me, as they&#x27;ll provide an immediate uplift over your existing keycaps and last for decades.

                              <span>Do you ever feel like multiplayer games would be better if other players were less abusive? Ubisoft and Riot Games are looking into training artificial intelligence to tackle bad behaviours within in-game chat, a research collaboration they’re calling Zero Harm In Comms. Ahead of their announcement today, I put some questions to Ubisoft La Forge’s executive director Yves Jacquier and Riot’s head of technology research Wesley Kerr to get some more insight on the joint project, and ask them exactly how their proposal will work.

I understand why you made this decision, but I do not have to agree. This might become part of my own backstory. But we must continue, this week picking between something charmingly ever-changing and something perfectly static and reliable. What&#x27;s better: dynamic music, or hex grids?

Nestling in among all the talk of Mother Crystals and summons is a comment from writer Kazutoyo Maehiro that players will get to control another character than just our boy Clive. It sounds like you’ll only get a short while to step into this other, as yet unnamed character’s shoes, however, as they’re only playable in the early game.

                              <span>Cyberpunk 2077 may not live up to largely impossible expectations and promises, but I genuinely believe it&#x27;s a great time. Now that Night City is playable, it&#x27;s one of the most transportive video game cities out there, where cold calls from unknown numbers play into the fantasy of transforming from an upstart to a big shot who&#x27;s name travels along its neon-lit back alleys.

                              <span>So. Funny thing about our RTX 4080 review: I sort of don’t have time for it. We are amidst the busiest few weeks in PC gaming hardware for at least four years, with major product launches all round (from its rival Radeon RX 7900 XT to Intel’s 13th Gen CPUs) and a neverending stream of other components and peripherals that still need appraising. Also, I get the impression that if I don’t do more Black Friday stuff, senior ReedPop figures will show up at my flat and start taking my fingers with chisels.


Still, there will no doubt be potential graphics card upgrade-makers looking at the RTX 4080 to see if it’s more of a palatable purchase than the RTX 4090. That vanguard of Nvidia’s next-gen Ada Lovelace architecture is by far the most powerful GPU I’ve ever tested, and introduced a very cool new feature in DLSS 3, but with prices starting £1679 / $1599 it’s just not a sensible option. And since I did have an RTX 4080 show up at the last minute – Asus’ customised ROG Strix GeForce RTX 4080 OC Edition – I can at least provide some quick benchmarks and initial thoughts as to whether it’s a better deal.

Twenty years later I’ve returned to its re-release - and beaten the first level! And in the process, I’ve developed a particular appreciation for the old-school boomer shooter and its interesting quirks.

                              <span>In the Tom Waits song The Piano Has Been Drinking, the gravel-voiced pianist imitates a pissed-up lounge singer, slurring his way through nonsense lyrics, pounding on the keyboard, and occasionally hitting all of the wrong notes. Drinking too much wine and playing the piano badly and getting chased out of a hotel lobby is easy — most of us could do it — but it takes a degree of talent to sound entertainingly rubbish.
Likewise, Goat Simulator 3 is an expertly janky game about being a silly little goat and running around causing mischief. It’s a dumb, open-world simulator in which bugs have been promoted to features. Your goat is a horrible little kooky guy who mostly interacts with the environment through the medium of headbutts and licking. They’ll occasionally be catapulted into the sky by a spasmodic police car, or have their head irreversibly enlarged by a special machine, or bleat so hard at a beanstalk that it vanishes into thin air, but even during the most chaotic moments things feel entirely under control. As though the invisible hand of a very, very tired QA tester is always on the tiller.

                              <span>A whole bunch of classic Civilization leaders are coming back for Civilization 6’s upcoming Leader Pass, devs Firaxis have confirmed. You can expect 18 more leaders spread out over six DLC pack releases between November 21st and March 2023, 12 of whom are new leaders. Another six will be “new takes” on existing leaders from previous games in the Civ series. The Leader Pass’ existence was leaked by accident last week when promo art for the DLC appeared on the mobile version of the Civ website, before it was removed.

                              <span>Small form factor cases are very much in vogue, with some great options nowadays from the likes of Cooler Master, NZXT and Ssupd. Normally you&#x27;re looking at around $50 to $150 for the case itself, with a further $70 to $100 for a matching SFX power supply, but today there&#x27;s an excellent deal at Amazon US that offers a small form factor case and a 700W PSU for just $130 - after a sizeable $120 discount. 
The case is the HYTE Revolt 3, and it&#x27;s attracted rave reviews for its easy build qualities, great thermals and beautiful design, making it an easy recommendation at this discounted price.

                              <span>Blizzard have postponed the release of a patch for Overwatch 2 so they can fix an undisclosed “critical issue” with the game. The patch had been scheduled for November 15th, and is meant to include hero balance adjustments for Zarya, Genji, Sombra, Kiriko, and D.va. The mid-season update should also see Mei return to the hero shooter after her two-week stint on the bench, Blizzard’s statement said, following issues with her icewall ability last month. You can now expect the patch to arrive tomorrow, November 17th, at 7pm GMT / 9pm CET / 11am PST. Not too long to wait, then.

For one, it&#x27;s set in a science fiction  world in which post-apocalyptic South Korea, the 10th century Byzantine Empire, and a 23rd century future are all somehow colliding. For two, it was revealed yesterday not with a brief logo or a show-nothing cinematic trailer, but with a nine minute video comprehensively depicting the actual game. Watch it below.

                              <span>The long-awaited Pokémon Trading Card Game Live app is now available in beta worldwide on PC and mobile devices after a staggered rollout last month. The successor to the now-defunct Pokémon Trading Card Game Online game has been in the works since its reveal last September. 
For fans of the previous mobile game, TCG Live aims to offer a more polished, robust digital card game experience. You can collect cards either by scanning code cards or purchasing booster packs with digital currency earned in-game by completing quests and working through battle passes.
Players represent themselves with a customizable avatar and can challenge players to matches across the globe. It also sports a much sleeker presentation. Essentially, TCG Live is positioned as the Pokémon equivalent of modern card game apps such as Magic: The Gathering Arena and Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel. Check out the original teaser trailer below.


Since the game is in beta, expect updates to roll out over the coming weeks/months. Pokémon TCG Live can be played on iOS, Android, and is downloadable on PC.</span>

Following the inclusion of Rick Sanchez and Morty Smith from Rick and Morty near the end of Season 1, it seems classic cartoon character Marvin the Martian will be next to join the roster.

Earlier this month, Football Manager 2023 came to the service, a game so all-consuming it barely leaves time to sleep.

                              <span>Like so many games buried deep within my Steam library, I am unsure when I bought Painkiller: Black Edition or my exact reasons for doing so. I expect it was cheap in some kind of daily sale. Perhaps I was hungover, and hoped a small treat would ease my aching head. I vaguely recall booting it up once, perhaps a decade ago, and getting no further than its main menu. Painkiller was destined to rot in a digital purgatory of my own design forever, an unassuming icon that I would scroll past on my way to reinstall Destiny 2 for the 12th time without giving it a single thought. That is, until Valve finally sent me my Steam Deck.

                              <span>Season 1 of Warner Bros. licensed brawler MultiVersus is over, and Season 2 has begun today with an update that adds more reward tiers to the battle pass. There’s also a new Big Head Mode for the game’s recently added Silly Queue, and an in-game store that brings all MultiVersus’ skins and characters into one place for the first time. Weirdly, but appropriately, the game now keeps score of baskets on the Space Jam map and tracks how far away you shoot from too, so have some fun netting three-pointers with that.

                              <span>Just when I thought I had my top 10 games of 2022 sorted, Obsidian release Pentiment, forcing me to shred my former list and grab my quill and ink for a rewrite. It’s an odd pairing on paper - a detective thriller about a string of grisly murders set in the quaint countryside of 16th-century Bavaria - but, surprisingly, this coupling is a match made in heaven. 
Its captivating story of conspiracy and murder is as rich and dense as its setting, and it&#x27;s clearly made by a passionate team who have a deep love for the period. Playing Pentiment feels like riffling through the painterly pages of a medieval manuscript, but instead of finding the written gospel of saints and sinners, there are tales of angry farmers, greedy landowners, church scandals, religious turmoil, and murder. Fundamentally though, it&#x27;s a historical tale about faith and truth, and the lengths that people are willing to go to preserve them.

                              <span>After finishing the full version of Vampire Survivors, my fingers are limbered up for a livelier arcade walk-o-shooter. I&#x27;ve turned to Brotato, a game whose demo I enjoyed in the Steam Next Fest, and which launched into early access in September. I say with great affection: it feels (and looks) like it could have been a Flash game on Newgrounds. Plus it&#x27;s only £4.

Will Twitter shut down due to financial collapse? Will people simply leave Twitter? All I know is, I&#x27;ll miss the Twitter bots which go down to collateral damage, the automated machines which tirelessly post art, poetry, jokes, stories, and probably dog photos. Here are some of my favourites!

Some Call Of Duty players looking forward to getting their itchy trigger fingers on the free-to-play battle royale have been struggling to sort out their preloads, though. This confusion echoes what happened with Modern Warfare 2019 when Warzone 1.0 launched back in 2020. If you’re bemused by the current preload sitch then watch the Warzone 2.0 launch trailer below, and let Freebird chill you out.

A store page for the Oklahoma expansion has popped up on Steam, although there hasn’t been an official announcement just yet. That’s most likely because today sees the launch of American Truck Simulator’s Texas DLC, so you expect to hear more about Oklahoma after that&#x27;s out of the way.

Spector dropped the hint about Overwatch 2’s next hero in a Q&amp;A session with Korean site Inven. Spector said that the next hero would be a “more solid support”. We can expect them to arrive in Overwatch 2 when Season 3 of the game begins in early February 2023.

While the parents peacefully sleep on, the toddler stirs. Oh no. I instantly expect nothing but the worst for the toddler, seeing whose game I’m playing – developer Jumpship was co-founded by Dino Patti, himself co-founder of Playdead, the studio behind Limbo and Inside. Both aren’t exactly known for treating their child protagonists well.

                              <span>If we&#x27;ve learned anything from Marvel&#x27;s comics and cinematic universe, it&#x27;s that the world is always expanding. New villains are always emerging and new heroes are always swooping in to stop them. Crystal Dynamics is taking this same approach with its game starring Earth&#x27;s Mightiest Heroes. Marvel&#x27;s Avengers launched with six playable characters, but that&#x27;s far from all the heroes we&#x27;ll be able to take control of when it&#x27;s all said and done. Crystal Dynamics has said that all playable characters will be added at no additional cost, but additional upgrades for those characters could cost money.
Check out all the characters you can play as in Marvel&#x27;s Avengers, as well as all the heroes still to come.

The best stories in video games manage to fuse narrative, art, and gameplay in a way that elevates all three. Pentiment, the latest from Obsidian Entertainment, is a perfect example of this, telling a deep, complex story about religion, truth, and history in the form of a book, which the player experiences as it’s being written. Despite a few sections with inconsistent pacing, it’s a must-play for fans of adventure games.
Pentiment tells the story of traveling artist Andreas Maler and his time spent in Tassing, a fictional town …</span>

                              <span>Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet have been officially announced, complete with a reveal trailer that includes a first look at the starters this time around. 
These two games represent the start of Generation 9, which will surely bring its own competitive meta, anime, and even Pokémon card series to the franchise, and we can&#x27;t wait. However, there&#x27;s still some time before we actually get to play these games, so for now, we&#x27;ll be scanning every second of the reveal trailer (and subsequent trailers) for new locales, features, and of course, Pokémon. 


As any Pokémon player knows, with each generation comes two games to choose from. This time around, it&#x27;s Scarlet and Violet (is this a callback to Red and Blue, perhaps?). With two different versions, there are always some differences between…</span>

                              <span>Nintendo and Game Freak have released an overview trailer for Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet, showcasing more than five minutes of new footage. 
Hot on the heels of the official release of Pokémon&#x27;s ninth gen this Friday, this overview trailer will get you prepared for your upcoming journey through Paldea. Veteran trainers will recognize a lot of what the trailer is breaking down, like how your journey begins by picking a starter, but this overview trailer also breaks down a lot of the new things happening in these games. This includes the fact that you can tackle the gyms in any order, freely explore Paldea, and infiltrate the Team Star bases scattered around the region. 
Check out the Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet overview trailer for yourself below:


As you can see, this trailer is packed with lots of new looks at characters we&#x27;ll meet in Paldea, new Pokémon to catch and party up with, and more. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer&#x27;s hands-on preview with Pokémon Scarlet or watch our video about it here. Check out these new details about the first Tera Raid battle, an early-purchase Pikachu, and more after that and then read about Greavard, a new ghost-type dog in the games.

He told The Verge this in a new interview where he also revealed that no part of Microsoft&#x27;s ongoing acquisition of Activision Blizzard is about pulling the rug from underneath PlayStation&#x27;s plans; it&#x27;s just that the two parties can&#x27;t write a contract that says explicitly Call of Duty will be on PlayStation &quot;forever.&quot;

                              <span>MSI&#x27;s RX 6650 XT is a capable graphics card for 1440p gaming, and it&#x27;s down from £380 to £299.99 at Overclockers after a healthy discount. 
It also comes with AMD&#x27;s Raise the Game Bundle, which includes copies of two upcoming games: Dead Island 2 and The Callisto Protocol (confusingly titled &#x27;The Callisto Project&#x27; by a potentially short-sighted Overclockers staffer). This is a pretty solid deal for three hundred of your Great British Pounds, especially as GTX 16-series cards were selling for this much recently and offer far worse performance.

                              <span>It takes a very special game to give you so much to learn, so many ways to do everything, that even after 1000 hours of playtime you still feel like a beginner. Factorio is daunting in the extreme, and I remember bouncing off it the first time I tried. Thank goodness I gave it a second chance. Building up a gigantic world-spanning, atmosphere-destroying factory slowly and methodically over dozens of hours is probably my favourite singleplayer experience in games.

                              <span>Post-apocalyptic survival sim Forever Skies has floated its release date straight out of this year and into the first half of 2023, developers Far From Home have announced. Their reasons for the delay have been detailed in a lengthy Steam post, but it&#x27;s mainly good news: after receiving tons of feedback from their recent demo, the devs are now looking to expand the game&#x27;s scope and spend more time working on its futuristic dirigibles and such. They also released a new teaser trailer showing some customisable airships from the game, too.

                              <span>I shouldn&#x27;t enjoy Sonic Frontiers as much as I do, but I do? The game brings out the worst in me on the regular, as I turn into a spittle slinger who screams into their fist after hitting the tiniest ledge or fighting an awful, awful boss. Frontiers is a janky beast - a mess. Yet, it&#x27;s a lot of fun when you&#x27;re mindlessly collecting stuff and sliding on rails and listening to excellent drum and bass tracks. It&#x27;s a playground of the best and worst kind, so if you&#x27;d like a test of patience with your precious spare time, then you simply can&#x27;t get any better than this.

Gameplay from the Complete Edition of The Witcher 3 is due to be shown off in a REDstreams event on Twitch next week, along with some new stuff for the game based on Netflix’s version of Geralt Of Rivia’s adventures.

So far I am finding it, you know, fine, by which I mean it is good and fun but also almost exactly the same as 2018 one, right down to the tension between Kratos and his son Atreus. Their dynamic seems to have largely pressed the reset button so they can do a character growth again, with the differences so far being that Atreus is now taller and his voice has broken, Kratos doesn&#x27;t call him &quot;Boy!&quot;, and also he won&#x27;t shut up under any circumstances.

                              <span>Canny members of the Skyrim modding community are working on a plugin to enable support for DLSS, FSR2, and XeSS upscaling in the Special and Anniversary Editions of Bethesda&#x27;s sprawling RPG. Modder PureDark is working together with a small team on the unofficial plugin, called Skyrim-Upscaler, and it should help bump up those frame rates somewhat. It&#x27;s available to download now from Github if you want to give it a go yourself, but there’s no plan to release the plugin publicly until the modders sort out VR compatibility.

                              <span>The future has arrived in Monkey Moon&#x27;s new narrative management game, and you can see it all the next time you go and fill up your car. At EyeLife&#x27;s Flat Eye stations, why stop at getting milk and snacks when you can also pick up a whole new stomach, liver and other assorted organs? You&#x27;ll find them on aisle five, right next to the surgery booths. Perhaps you&#x27;d prefer a quick medical checkup instead, though? After all, your tailored biometric predictions for the day looked a bit dodgy earlier, and goodness knows you&#x27;re not going to wait to see an actual doctor about it.
Afterwards, why not escape for a bit and treat yourself to an immersive VR experience? They&#x27;ve got everything from hour-long fantasies to ones that last days, or even weeks. Your choice. And if you&#x27;re short on time, you could always just give yourself those happy memories by sitting in their mind-altering MemoryMachines for a couple of minutes. Just don&#x27;t forget to steer clear of the big recycle chambers. I heard something terrible happened to a dog who wandered into one recently, and the owner went absolutely ballistic. And watch out for the GentleSleep pods, too. I&#x27;ve only ever seen the clerk take long black sacks out of there and stick them in the incinerator, and the smell was awful.

                              <span>Nvidia DLSS 3 is arguably the single most interesting thing to emerge from the RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 GPU launches. Even with, I’ll concede, some limits: whereas previous DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) versions have been available to any GeForce RTX graphics card, DLSS 3 is currently only usable on these RTX 40 series models. Or will be, once the RTX 4080 goes on sale on November 16th. Yet having tested it out on the RTX 4090, I’m convinced it could be as big a deal as the cards themselves, especially if you have a high-refresh-rate gaming monitor.

The change will coincide with the end of Season 4 in an event called Fracture, teased by devs Epic Games at the end of the Fortnite Champion Series held over the weekend. Fracture kicks off on December 3rd at 9pm GMT / 1pm PST.

Managing the last group of people alive on whatever world they inhabit has me questioning my every decision like I’m cutting wires underneath a bomb.
It’s a relief then, that Floodland is a bit more chill than some of its city-building contemporaries. Gone are the humanity-ending threats like Frostpunk’s great Winter storm, forever bearing down on you and periodically tightening its grasp around your neck. Here you have a simple group of stranded civilians looking to pick up the pieces in the aftermath of an apocalyptic flood.

I feel that&#x27;s a decent savings on a drive ideal for upgrading an older machine or as media/game storage in a new one, where money spent per gigabyte is the primary measurement of a drive&#x27;s suitability. (If performance is the objective, then a faster NVMe SSD drive is the way to go.) And by that measure, this drive is almost off the scale, with a cost of just 5.6p per gigabyte.

                              <span>The end of Fortnite Chapter 3 is upon us as Epic Games has revealed that its finale event will take place next month. 
More specifically, the finale event will take place on December 3 at 1 p.m. PT/4 p.m. ET. This news was revealed through a title card teased at the end of the Fortnite Champion Series, which took place over the weekend, as reported by Eurogamer. You can see the title card at the top of this story, if you&#x27;re curious. 
Unfortunately, that&#x27;s all that Epic Games teased in terms of the end of Fortnite&#x27;s Fracture era. As for what&#x27;s in store for Chapter 4 or what this finale event might play like, that remains unknown. Fortunately, we don&#x27;t have to wait too much longer, though, because the event begins in just a few weeks. 
If it&#x27;s anything like previous Fortnite chapter finales, then expect huge PvE battles across the island, plenty of spectacle, an exciting conclusion, and of course, some downtime as the game prepares to launch the next chapter.

                              <span>Brazil says blocking measures to tackle the rise of pirate IPTV services and devices are coming soon. In the meantime, a new system of fines will apply to suppliers and users alike. The government has other plans which appear to render all TV boxes illegal by default, pending official approval. And if anyone modifies an approved device or &quot;uses it incorrectly&quot;, that&#x27;s an offense too.

                              <span>AMD&#x27;s Ryzen 5000 series CPUs are getting increasingly affordable, with this week bringing rather good prices on the lowest-tier Ryzen 5 5500. This is, to the best of my knowledge, the cheapest Ryzen CPU in the lineup, but still quite a capable chip with power that&#x27;s roughly equivalent to the old Ryzen 5 3600. This processor normally retails for £110, but today you can pick one up for £88 when you use code BAG20OFF.

Well, now it looks like someone has leaked images from a recent Sims 5 playtest, which seemingly shows a city environment with several apartments to build inside.

                              <span>Italy&#x27;s Polizia Di Stato reports that a huge operation targeting an IPTV piracy network is still ongoing after being launched nationwide overnight. The currently unnamed network reportedly serves 900,000 users and reportedly generates millions of euros in monthly profits. Video seems to confirm a raid on a location where Sky content was being captured for illegal redistribution.

                              <span>Standing here, I realize that this Super Replay will be a cut above the rest because we’ll be slicing and dicing in Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance! Join us today on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central to enjoy two hours of what will be a full playthrough of the cult favorite action game streaming weekly each Friday. You can also catch up on previous episodes by visiting our new Game Informer Shows YouTube channel or watching the embedded episode below. 
Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance serves as a sequel/spin-off to Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots that puts cyborg ninja Raiden at the helm. Instead of sneaking around in boxes, players eviscerate foes in fast-paced, stylish action courtesy of developer Platinum Games. Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look. Will I acquire a new appreciation for the game nine years later? How many watermelons will I slice? You’ll have to tune in to find out. 


Join me, Marcus Stewart, and Blake Hester as we revisit Raiden’s beloved solo adventure.

                              <span>Remedy Entertainment has announced a new deal with publisher 505 Games to co-develop and market Control 2. The news also provided insight into the sequel&#x27;s development status. 
According to a press release, Control 2 (once known as Codename Heron) is currently in the concept phase, being built in Remedy’s proprietary Northlight engine. The game will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. Remedy will publish the PC version while 505 will handle the game’s console releases. Control 2 has no release window, but Remedy did release a piece of concept art, posted below. 
The press release also states that Control 2’s development budget initially sat at 50 million euros. Remedy and 505 will equally split marketing and development costs, as well as revenue generated by its release. Remedy retains full ownership of the Control IP, however. The press release also reveals that the first Control has sold over 3 million copies since launching in 2019. 
“We are excited to deepen our cooperation with Remedy and continue the success story of Control together,” say Rami and Raffi Galante, co-CEOs of Digital Bros Group/505 Games. “... Control is the biggest investment 505 Games has ever made, so it has a special place in our hearts. We are grateful to the whole player community that has made Control such a long-lasting and loved game, and are even more excited to bring out Control 2.”
This announcement was first teased last June, when Remedy and 505 revealed plans for new triple-A Control experiences. That same update revealed an upcoming multiplayer spin-off title known as Project Condor. Earlier this year, Remedy also struck a deal with Rockstar to develop remakes of Max Payne 1 and 2.</span>

The news broke this morning with BTAS co-star Diane Pershing, who voiced Poison Ivy, posting on Facebook that Conroy had passed yesterday from an illness, later identified as cancer. Warner Bros. has since confirmed the news. 
&quot;Very sad news: our beloved voice of Batman, Kevin Conroy, died yesterday,&quot; Pershing writes. &quot;He&#x27;s been ill for a while but he really put in a lot of time at the cons, to the joy of all of his fans.

                              <span>Where the Water Tastes Like Wine is a pretty bleak game, but it’s also really good! It’s set in Depression-era America, a time when many folks were having their assess kicked by the economy and manifest destiny. The game is about these people, specifically travellers and nomads who wander the country in search of answers. Migrant workers, preachers, poets, folk healers, Dustbowl refugees, and even men with wolf’s heads make up this cast, and it’s your job to meet these strangers and collect their stories.

The broadcast will coincide with the launch of Patch 9 for Baldur’s Gate 3, although Larian are keeping schtum for now about what new things are coming to the game. Start gathering your party, folks.

                              <span>Dave the Diver (character) is a bit out of practice, but he&#x27;s an easygoing sort and it doesn&#x27;t take much to convince him to get back in his flippers to look into the local anomaly at the behest of his arms dealer &quot;friend&quot;, who would be clearly bad news even if his name wasn&#x27;t Cobra.
Said anomaly fills with new sea creatures from all over the world every time it&#x27;s visited, and possibly building-sized terror beasts and ancient merfolk, but Cobra&#x27;s sure it&#x27;ll all be fine, so in you go, mate. It&#x27;s certainly pretty down there if nothing else, and Dave the Diver (game) is, if nothing else, a rare game that makes the usually tedious water level a bit of a treat to wander round in.

                              <span>Obviously, I wouldn’t be here if I didn’t believe in the pleasurable side of PC hardware. Building a PC (or even just swapping out a component) can be a series of lovely little tactile moments: the peeling-off of plastic wrapping, the K’nex-like click of a graphics card slotting into place, the soft whoosh of the fans on a first successful boot. Great stuff, and of course, that’s all before games start coming out of it. What’s not to like?
Oh, reader, so many things. So many, many things not to like. Gaming PCs are still only computers, after all, and computers break, often and for reasons that may be invisible to the most intensively trained eye. Introduce this volatility to a line of work that involves handling a lot of sometimes heavy, usually expensive equipment, and enjoying those little pleasures will eventually come at a cost. Namely, time spent dealing with arcane troubleshooting practices and the occasional spot of minor personal injury.

Until now, thanks to a Special Edition mod that slows down time when arrows are flying towards your mightily voiced fantasy warrior. Enabling the Projectile Sense – Incoming Arrow &amp; Magic Slows Time mod should give you just enough advance warning to hotfoot it out of the path of any pointy ended sticks that have been loosed and are heading your way.

                              <span>EA and Dice are still trying to revive their flagging near-future military shooter Battlefield 2042 a year after launch. They’re targeting the subscription service market, together with the start of Battlefield 2042’s upcoming Season 3: Escalation in December, bringing the game to both EA Play and Microsoft’s Game Pass Ultimate. Of course, EA Play is included in regular PC Game Pass, so there&#x27;s that. You can find out more by watching the development update video below.

                              <span>Harvestella is a JRPG. This may seem like an incredibly obvious thing to say about a role-playing game from Square-Enix, but it’s the most important thing to know going in. Billed as a life sim RPG, and with a title that evokes farming, you could be forgiven for expecting something along the lines of Harvest Moon or Stardew Valley, but with more monster biffing. Instead, Harvestella sits firmly in the epic quest camp, with your adventuring being supported by your rural activities.
Anyone looking to build a pastoral paradise is going to be sorely disappointed, as the farming elements are somewhat rudimentary. Even calling your property a farm is a bit of a stretch. Even after a few upgrades, my plot is more of a large garden, maybe an allotment, if I’m being generous.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been eagerly anticipating Pepper Grinder since I saw a series of tweets with GIFs several years ago. It&#x27;s a pixel platformer in which the protagonist, Pepper, has a drill which she uses to plow through scenery, and a grappling hook for all the moments when she&#x27;s not underground. It&#x27;s now been officially announced with Devolver as publisher and there&#x27;s a reveal trailer below.

                              <span>Dragon Age: Absolution is coming to Netflix on December 9. A new trailer provides a deeper look into the adult animated series&#x27; premise and new heroes. 
The story centers on Miriam, an elven mercenary and former slave tasked with stealing a powerful and dangerous artifact. When the heist goes awry, the situation escalates into a larger fight for survival for Miriam and her friends. Set in Tevinter, the show features an original cast of heroes and, potentially, some old favorites (the characters at 0:45 look a lot like Cassandra and Leliana). Check out the trailer below. 


First announced during Netflix Geeked Week in June, Dragon Age: Absolution’s cast includes Kimberly Brooks (Miriam), Matthew Mercer (Fairbanks), Ashly Burch (Qwydion), Phil Lamarr (Roland), and Josh Keaton (Rezaren). The series consists of six 30-minute episodes. 
Though steeped in Dragon Age lore, it remains to be seen if the show has any connection to the upcoming Dragon Age: Dreadwolf. Absolution is far from the only video game adaptation Netflix has in the works. The CG-animated Sonic Prime also premieres in December. The streaming giant also announced a live-action Gears of War movie and its own animated series.</span>

Beyond our coverage of Street Fighter 6 in the latest issue of Game Informer, issue 351 also includes a deep dive into Tchia, and the unusual trip where we learned more about the game.  
Tchia is created by the development studio known as Awaceb. Awaceb’s founders grew up in a small French territory east of Australia called New Caledonia, and this debut game from the studio is inspired by their childhood there. I visited New Caledonia in September, and joined the team from Awaceb to learn more about the culture, peoples, and geography that make it such a memorable place.  
Check out the new issue to discover more about the trip and the game.
Our video below features a small part of the lovely Tchia soundtrack alongside glimpses of video taken during the trip, as well as gameplay footage of Tchia.  


Tchia is set to release in early 2023 on PS5, PS4, and PC.

                              <span>We recently traveled to Osaka, Japan, for our Street Fighter 6 cover story. While we were in the city, Game Informer video editor Alex Van Aken and I thought it would be a great idea to take advantage of our proximity to Universal Studios Japan to visit Super Nintendo World. Like you, we saw the tour provided by the legendary Shigeru Miyamoto, but we needed to see it for ourselves. And to be quite frank, we are so glad that we did.
It&#x27;s impossible to fully convey how cool most of our time at Super Nintendo World was. From the moment we exited the giant warp pipe at the entrance, we felt transported into an actual Mario game. Check out the photos from our time at Super Nintendo World to get a sense of how incredible the experience is.
First, we had to reserve a time to enter that particular…</span>

                              <span>With Stadia’s impending shutdown in January, Google has begun fulfilling its promise of issuing refunds to its customers. The process started yesterday, and Google has posted an FAQ breaking down how it works. 
As previously announced, Google is refunding all software purchases through the Stadia Store (such as games, DLC, in-game currency, and current pre-orders) and hardware purchases made through the Google Store; physical store purchases cannot be refunded. Eligible hardware includes:
Stadia Controller
Founder&#x27;s Edition
Premiere Edition
Play and Watch with Google TV packages
Stadia Pro subscriptions will not be refunded, but members can play their Pro titles until the shutdown. However, those who purchased a subscription on or after September 29, 2022, and were charged for it will have that money returned. 
Refunds will be issued to the form of payment used to make the purchase. If that account is no longer available, Google will send an email with instructions for setting up an alternative method of receiving the refund.
Users may have already received an email notifying them of their refund status. Although payments are now being issued, that doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll get yours today or this week. This will be a gradual rollout that will continue up until January 18. There&#x27;s no way of knowing when you&#x27;ll receive your refund, so eligible users should keep an eye on their inbox and bank account over the coming days or weeks.</span>

As you saw with our cover reveal yesterday, one of the most iconic characters is a centerpiece of Street Fighter 6&#x27;s story. Ken Masters, one of the two original playable Street Fighter characters, steps back into the spotlight with an all-new backstory. As soon as his new look was unveiled, the Street Fighter community had a field day pondering what happened to put Ken in the rough state he appeared, with memes popping up deeming him &quot;Hobo Ken.&quot; While at Capcom&#x27;s headquarters in Osaka, Japan, we spoke with Street Fighter 6 director Takayuki Nakayama and art director Kaname Fujioka to get more details abou…</span>

                              <span>Eric Williams has been working on God of War since the first game, and his credits extend beyond Kratos&#x27; journey to titles like Darksiders and Insomniac&#x27;s Spider-Man, but he will always consider Sony Santa Monica home. For God of War Ragnarök, Williams put a pause on his video game consulting business to take on the director role for the highly anticipated sequel. We spoke with Williams about why God of War 2018&#x27;s director, Cory Barlog, had to convince him to take on the role, why nearly every God of War game has a new director, how he discovered he is not able to generate visuals in his mind&#x27;s eye, how the surprising casting of Richard Schiff as Odin came about, and plenty more.

As I eat my sandwich, I make conversation with Street Fighter 6 director Takayuki Nakayama, who is seated next to me, enjoying his own sandwich. After touching on topics of our respective histories with Street Fighter and other games we&#x27;ve been playing, he asks if I&#x27;ve enjoyed what I&#x27;ve played of Street Fighter 6 to this point.
I let him know the gameplay and art style are terrific and that I feel the Real-Time Commentary feature is a revolutionary addition to the fighting genre. The director nods along with a smile until I mention how I don&#x27;t feel the Modern Controls (which simplify the overal…</span>

That&#x27;s right: Our next issue proudly features Street Fighter 6 on the cover. The cover art, created by designer Goro Tokuda, features one of the original World Warriors, Ken, sporting his new look. Everyone (Capcom included) has seen your memes about Ken&#x27;s rougher appearance in this game, but we traveled to the studio in Osaka, Japan, to learn more about what&#x27;s happening with one of the franchise&#x27;s most iconic characters.
While there, we went hands-on with the game, had extensive conversations with the developers, chatted about the lessons the team took from Street Fighter V&#x27;s disappointing launch, and even learned about a new way to play Street Fig…</span>

This new look at Pokémon Scarlet and Violet was mostly focused on Ed Sheeran’s new Pokémon single “Celestial,” but it also included a few Big Nuggets of information we learned for the first time. The most significant reveal is a glimpse at two new creatures, called Great Tusk and Iron Treads. At first glance, they look a lot like Donphan (a Pokémon that has been confirmed for the new games), but it’s unclear how they’re related.

                              <span>Sonic Frontiers is available now, marking a new era for the iconic Sonic the Hedgehog franchise. While much of the 3D action remains intact through Sonic Frontiers, the arena in which much of that action takes place is a massive departure. The open-zone setup gives players large areas in which to run, fight, and explore, but the game also presents players with linear Cyber Space stages that veer much closer to the action levels players are used to. With so much to do in Sonic Frontiers (I spent more than 30 hours clearing as much as I could off the map), I wanted to give players some tips to help them squeeze the most fun out of the Blue Blur&#x27;s enjoyment.

                              <span>Scorn is an abstract game that is difficult to decipher. Even after seeing credits, players are left in an uncomfortable but memorable state of mind that defies clear explanation. To try and develop some context, we spoke with the game&#x27;s director, Ebb Software&#x27;s Ljubomir Peklar, via e-mail to try and get some more insight into the bizarre experience. Unsurprisingly, much is meant to be left to the players&#x27; imagination, but Peklar did offer some details, like how it managed to create something so abstract, some of the incidental imagery that occurred, and the best movie from the Aliens franchise.
Game Informer: What happened in Scorn?

                              <span>Escapism increases with yet another ScummVM release!
The ScummVM Team is thrilled to announce the immediate availability of ScummVM 2.6.1.
ScummVM 2.6.1 is a maintenance release mainly focused on improving the new features and engines we introduced in our previous release.
This update includes upgrades for the following engines:
AGS
AGOS
Asylum
Ultima
SCI
SCUMM
Tinsel
Toltecs
Toon
Other improvements include upgrading the icon-based grid view in the ScummVM launcher and fixing OpenGL render graphic corruptions.
Finally, Android users will be able to properly use a mouse on virtual screens, and Windows users will not have any duplicated icons folder issues.
You can find all of this goodness available for a number of platforms on our downloads page. If you are using Windows, macOS, the Ubuntu Snap package or the FlatHub repository, the auto-update robots will assist you in updating to ScummVM 2.6.1.
As always, the detailed list of improvements is available here.
Thank you for your continuous support — happy adventuring!

                              <span>Are you spooked? We are too with this spooky release date, even if nothing in OpenTTD itself is spooky. Luckily, I can offer you the first testing release of the 13.X release series. We collected whatever we could find on the cutting room floor to get you a Halloween release. Some of the higlights of this release include: Build NewGRF objects over an era with click-and-drag. Wider rivers on map generation. Improved handling of HiDPI and mixed-DPI screens. Some more GUI improvements like a cleaned up finance window. Many bug-fixes (over 50 of them), tweaks, changes, and other additions. (As ever, see the changelog for further details). The usual titlegame competition has been announced on the forums. See the page for the exact competition rules if you are interested. Download Changelog Bug tracker</span>
