One mod that just keeps getting better is The Legend of Zelda: Second Wind - A Breath of the Wild Expansion. In case you haven&#x27;t heard, it&#x27;s a &#x27;free large-scale DLC&quot; mod adding in new quests, areas, weapons and bosses, and it overhauls existing content.
We got a look at the brand new Hinox King boss battle last week, and now Breath of the Wild modder Waikuteru is back with a video of the new Octo Boss - a large Octarock found in the revamped &quot;Strock Lake&quot; area within the game&#x27;s overworld.

                    <span>Launching on Switch later this month.
Easily the most anticipated Switch game of January 2022 is Pokémon Legends: Arceus - it&#x27;s an entirely new take on the long-running monster taming series that sends players back to the past. It&#x27;s out on 28th January, and in the lead-up, Nintendo and The Pokémon Company have been sharing more and more footage of the game.
The latest clip to be published is an introduction trailer. Although it&#x27;s in Japanese, it still gives trainers a good look at how the game will play - showcasing six minutes of the landscape, Pokémon, people and customisation on offer. There&#x27;s also plenty of footage of the battle mechanics and modes of transportation.

By now, a bunch of you have seen it for yourselves. You probably have…

                    <span>Horizon Zero Dawn set a solid foundation for Guerrilla Games to build upon in Horizon Forbidden West, and the developer isn’t about to let this opportunity pass it by. For the upcoming sequel, Guerrilla Games looked at fan feedback, revisited ideas that were too ambitious for the first game, and tapped into the studio’s well of creativity to make Aloy’s exploits even more exciting. For our latest cover story, we saw Forbidden West in action and learned firsthand about how the sequel is making some worthwhile changes to improve upon its predecessor. 
Better Cinematics 
We expect improved graphics with each new entry in a series, and so far, the footage shown for Forbidden West has been extremely impressive. But sometimes it takes seeing the game up-close to really notice its finer points. “…</span>

                    <span>It looks like E3 2022 will follow in the footsteps of last year’s show by being a digital-only event. Although the hope after 2021 was a return to an in-person gathering at the Los Angeles Convention Center (with even the city’s mayor crossing his fingers), the ongoing pandemic has nixed those plans. 
In a statement to Venture Beat, posted below, the ESA confirmed that the coronavirus remains a major issue so it’s playing it safe for one more year:
As we all know, the pandemic is still very much a thing, especially with the Omicron variant running rampant. This isn’t the biggest shock in the world but still disappointing for fans, developers, and media hoping to reconnect in person this June. Since the pandemic started, E3 has been canceled outright in 2020 and the 2021 edition saw the event unfold through a series of livestreams and digital meetings held on the ESA’s website. If nothing else, it&#x27;ll be interesting to see how the ESA iterates on last year&#x27;s approach.

                    <span>One of the worst experiences I ever had in virtual reality was rolling credits on Half-Life: Alyx. Not playing the game – mind you – that was fantastic. No, I hated rolling credits on the game because I knew this phenomenal AAA VR experience was over, and I didn’t know when I would ever have another VR adventure of that caliber again.
Anyone who has ever put on a VR headset can tell you that the technology is promising. Anyone who owns a VR headset can tell you how slow the industry has been to fulfill that promise. I love creative offerings like Beat Saber, Superhot VR, and Pistol Whip. Those entertaining diversions make me happy to have a headset, but they only provide one type of experience. I still crave meatier, story-based VR adventures. Stuff like Half-Life: Alyx and … and … and wel…</span>

                    <span>A very creative person has designed Lego versions of the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and while they aren’t available to purchase at the moment, they could be one day. 
Twitter user BrickinNick revealed these two proof-of-concept Lego kits today with a stylish video and it turns out, with enough support, these could become real. That’s thanks to Lego Ideas, which is a unique Lego program where users can submit project concepts such as Lego new-gen consoles and ask for support. With enough backing, Lego could bring these conceptual kits to fruition. That assitance is what BrickinNick is asking for on Twitter and showing it requires simply creating a Lego Ideas account and clicking support. BrickinNick says 10,000 supporters can help this project become a Lego set so if you like what you …</span>

                    <span>Action! We all love it, and some of the best games have it, whether that takes the form of a bombastic shooter, sword-clashing melee fest, or good old-fashioned brawler. Action is one of the most universally beloved genres, so we’ve compiled a list of upcoming games that already have our adrenaline pumping. Rather than rank them, each game is arranged in chronological release order so you’ll know how long you’ll have to wait before you can get your hand on them. And hey, just because an action game didn’t make the cut doesn’t mean it won’t be worth a look! These are just the titles that, at a glance, raised our eyebrows the highest.

You can read the full post here, but one of the biggest takeaways is Bioware’s acknowledgment of previous missteps and its mission to get back in the good graces of its fans. McKay states that “When I took on the GM role, I talked about rebuilding our reputation, and that remains a huge priority. We are laser-focused on building back the trust of our fans and community, and we plan to do that by delivering the types of games that we are best known for and ensuring they are of the highest quality.” McKay touts the positive reception o…</span>

The sky is falling and only the Scions of the Seventh Dawn and the Warrior of Light are prepared to take on whatever or whoever is causing the calamitous end of days. Endwalker signals the conclusion to the Hydaelyn and Zodiark storyline, a central conflict between the forces of light and darkness that&#x27;s been at the core of FFXIV&#x27;s story since its early days. The expansion brings multiple new zones and two exciting new Jobs, the Sage and Reaper.

                    <span>Far Cry 6 was released last October, and while the base game offered dozens of hours of FPS action gameplay, Ubisoft upped the ante by committing to free content drops and three paid DLCs. 
Some of the free DLC includes Los Pollos Hermanos and Heisenberg outfits from Breaking Bad, while the first paid DLC, dubbed Vaas’ Insanity, gave players the chance to play as the infamous villain from Far Cry 3. Vaas’ Insanity was the first part of a villain-focused trilogy included in the Far Cry 6 season pass that costs $40. The second villainous DLC will star Far Cry 4’s Pagan Min, and now, Ubisoft announced that it’s coming next week. 
Dive into the twisted mind of Pagan Min. The new Pagan: Control DLC is coming January 11. pic.twitter.com/2hIr1xoPkc
January 5, 2022
More specifically, it will go live on January 11. Like the Vaas experience before it and the forthcoming Joseph Seed DLC coming after it, this Pagan Min-focused episode called Pagan: Control is a rogue-like experience that sees the Troy Baker-voiced villain “struggling to escape the horrors of their own minds.” You will die a lot and retry a lot, Ubisoft promises. 
You begin with a pistol and must find new weapons and powers to progress through Pagan Min’s mind. You’ll be able to give this experience a go in five days on January 11. 
For more, read about the other DLC offerings you can expect in Far Cry 6, and then check out our thoughts on the game in Game Informer’s Far Cry 6 review. Read about the Vaas’ Insanity DLC after that.

                    <span>It is important to keep in mind what is going on within Activision Blizzard at this time regarding ongoing allegations about the work culture. The ongoing lawsuit from the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) against the company is over reported toxic workplace culture. The bulk of the suit focuses on &quot;violations of the state&#x27;s civil rights and equal pay laws,&quot; specifically regarding the treatment of women and other marginalized groups. To learn more about the proceedings thus far, including details listed in the lawsuit against Activision Blizzard, please check out our previous coverage here.

After weeks of public silence, Activision has responded to an ongoing strike at Raven Software. 
The ongoing Raven employee strike, which began after a dozen contract QA workers were let go in December, entered its third week this week with no formal acknowledgment from Activision. However, a new statement from upper Raven Software management (see: Activision management) given to GamesIndustry.biz reveals that the company is in active discussions with employees. 
For more about story, read Game Informer’s prior coverage of the Raven layoffs, including Activision’s statement following the transition of 500 contract employees to full-time.

                    <span>Konami is celebrating the 35th anniversary of its Castlevania series with a new “memorial NFT” collection. 
More specifically, the company is auctioning 14 NFTs, some of which are just static images, others which appear to be videos. You can, of course, view each right now on their website – no purchase required – but you won’t be able to see how much each is going for as the auctions won’t begin until January 12. 
“Konami Memorial NFT is a new initiative to share content that has been loved by players all over the world, for many years,” a press release reads. “As the company’s first project in this area and with NFTs and blockchains technology in its infancy, Konami will continue to explore new developments and listen to player feedback following this initial collection.”

                    <span>Horizon Forbidden West&#x27;s new west coast setting isn’t just inhabited by fearsome new machines. Aloy will also encounter tribes and cultures, some friends and some foes. Guerrilla Games released a video reintroducing players to familiar tribes such as the Oseram, Utaru, and Tenakth, giving a rundown of their culture and standing in this region of the country. 
We see the Utaru, a culture in tune with nature, singing songs in an effort to cure their land of the blight. On the flip side, the battle-hardened Tenakth, which is divided into three clans, serves as the dominant tribe in the Forbidden West. One of those clans is the Regalla, the rebel faction shown in previous trailers that are at war with their fellow clansfolk. As powerful as the Tenakth is, the trailer hints at rumors of an even stronger group residing on the outer reaches of the Forbidden West.

                    <span>Days Gone has sold at least 9 million copies, according to its director. 
Yesterday, Game Informer reported that Sucker Punch Productions’ 2020 samurai game, Ghost of Tsushima, has sold more than 8 million copies – quite the feat, especially for a new IP from the developer. According to former Days Gone director Jeff Ross, the Pacific Northwest zombie title sold even more copies than Ghost of Tsushima but, instead of the warm reception Ghost of Tsushima received for its sales, PlayStation viewed it as a “big disappointment.”
Ross wrote in a quote tweet of Game Informer’s Ghost of Tsushima story about its latest sale milestone. “It’s gone on to sell more, and then a million+ on Steam. Local studio management always made us feel like it was a big disappointment.”

Chanteuse, mother, and Dirrty singer Christina Aguilera has done another trailer for the Nintendo Switch OLED after her last one — which showcased a bunch of family games — and although her kids still feature prominently in this one, the games are a little more exciting.
First, Ms Aguilera plays the (not-yet-released!) Pokémon Legends: Arceus with her young daughter, who rides around on the new Wyrdeer and catches a Pokémon with one of those new/old Apricorn Balls. We could do a deep-dive analysis on the footage, but... well, it&#x27;s most likely been added in in post, although we do know that they did actually play the game.

                    <span>With Acclaim handling the publishing duties.
Want to kick off 2022 with an amazing revelation? How about this? Virtua Fighter 3 might have made its way to the Nintendo 64, had former Sega of America boss Bernie Stolar gotten his way.
This particular bombshell comes from former games journalist James Mielke, who is now a producer at Limited Run Games. We need to travel all the way back to the year 2000 for this one; a time when Sega was still actively supporting its Dreamcast console but was at something of a crossroads. The company was in dire financial straits, and despite the reasonably positive commercial performance of the Dreamcast in the west, it was about to take the long, painful step into the world of third-party publishing. However, the official announcement of this seismic shift wouldn&#x27;t come until early in 2001, and in 2000 there was certainly no shortage of people who were utterly convinced that Sega would remain a hardware maker forevermore.

It&#x27;s clear that multiplayer with a twist of deceit is all the rage since Among Us took off, and the latest game to bring the concept in is Embr. A colourful and chaotic co-op title, your goal is to douse fires and complete a range of other objectives, and now a free update titled &#x27;Secret Hosr&#x27; adds another spin.
The core of the update are new challenges and larger stages suitable for teams of four, but someone can go &#x27;rogue&#x27; and be a saboteur. You can see a trailer above and some official blurb below:

Our lovely video team chats about the upcoming smash hit (because it&#x27;ll obviously sell a lot of copies) above, sharing their optimism, fears and general thoughts on the game. It&#x27;s probably fair to say that a lot of us don&#x27;t quite know what to expect - the concept is exciting, we just hope that it comes together in the final product.

                    <span>Well, it&#x27;s more like &quot;bums on&quot;.
If a person&#x27;s life story can be told through the state of their office chairs, then mine would be near-unpublishable. I have left a trail of destruction in the wake of my sedentary lifestyle: hard-wearing workhorses passed down from my parents, a fancy Herman Miller at my former job, and the peeling faux-leather wreckage of a cheap IKEA chair that now sits forlorn in some storage area somewhere.
None of them have ever been right for me — but I&#x27;m hoping this one, the one I&#x27;m sitting in right now, can be the happy ending to my tragic seat story.

                    <span>Can you save the human race?
Launching on Switch later this month is Unforeseen Incidents, a point-and-click adventure game from the team behind The Longing.
Available on Steam for some time now, the game will be bringing its hand-painted, mystery-filled world to Nintendo&#x27;s platform on 27th January. You&#x27;ll be joining protagonist Harper Pendrell to experience a challenging investigation that, judging by the new trailer above, comes with a nice chunk of humour on the side. Let us set the scene:

It&#x27;s lovely to see a meme finally reach a conclusion, like when Leonardo DiCaprio finally won an Oscar, or when Sora from Kingdom Hearts was added to Smash Bros last year. Now, we have another entry in ongoing memes that eventually came to fruition: The Pope loves Undertale.
This one began back in 2016, when YouTuber MatPat was invited to represent YouTube in an interview with the Head of the Catholic Church, Pope Francis. It was part of a conference on bringing the world together through the internet, but that&#x27;s not important — what&#x27;s important is that MatPat, when told that it was customary to bring the Pope a gift representing his country (the United States), he decided to bring... a Steam code for Undertale.

Windjammers 2 is just a couple of weeks away, a long awaited sequel that - once upon a time - would have been considered very unlikely. After bringing the SNK classic to modern hardware previously, it&#x27;ll be exciting to see Dotemu&#x27;s all-new sequel finally arrive on the eShop.
The publisher / developer has now released an interesting documentary about the making of Windjammers 2; it goes into plenty of detail from the early days of development, to showcasing different creative stages such as concept art, animation, right through to voiceover recording.

The division of Square Enix responsible for the Bravely Default series, Octopath Traveler, and the upcoming Triangle Strategy has teased multiple game announcements for 2022.
In a statement shared on social media, the team has wished fans a happy new year and noted that it plans to &quot;announce and release&quot; multiple titles this year. No further details on these upcoming projects have been shared, but presumably it won&#x27;t be too long before we hear more.

                    <span>In line with its 2020 results.
While Switch proved to be a major hit in the heavily disrupted 2020, production and distribution challenges nevertheless meant some sales were left behind. It seems that 2021, with some improvements in supply levels, was another strong selling year for Nintendo; now there are Japanese sales figures to reinforce that data.
In data gathered by Famitsu and shared with GamesIndustry.biz, the Switch was comfortably the best-selling console in Japan in 2021 - it&#x27;s the calendar not financial year, so the data is from 28th December 2020 to 19th December 2021. In that period the Switch sold around 5.3 million units at retail in Japan, this compares to 5.1 million in the previous year - the numbers are largely on par due to a difference in dates.

Earlier today, we brought you the sad news that Konami is choosing to mark Castlevania&#x27;s 35th with a collection of NFTs, rather than – you know – something decent, like a new game or collection of existing titles.
It remains to be seen if that is Konami&#x27;s only attempt to celebrate the occasion – it&#x27;s still only January, after all – but at least we have those lovely people over at Limited Run Games to kick things off in style.

Sometimes you can just tell how much effort and care went into making a game, and a good example of this can be seen in Dreamscaper. Developed by a tiny three-person development team, it’s impressive how much has been crammed into this little roguelite from both a story and gameplay perspective.
At its core Dreamscaper is a story about the importance of mental wellness and forming meaningful relationships. You play as a faceless woman named Cassidy, who has recently moved from her hometown of Backhill to a new city called Redhaven. Cassidy is quite lonely however, and she’s clearly dealing with some unaddressed trauma from her past that’s still haunting her daily life. To sort out her issues, Cassidy thus relives her past and faces her inner struggles head on in her dreams every night, which take the shape of randomly generated dungeons fashioned after important places from her history.

It&#x27;s fair to assume that any game with a title like &#x27;Pandemic Shooter&#x27; is bound to be slightly topical in 2022, but we can&#x27;t help but feel that the upcoming Switch title&#x27;s eShop page goes a little too far with the &#x27;humour&#x27;.
Before you accuse us of missing the joke, we&#x27;re fully aware that it has been written with a tongue firmly in cheek, and even pokes fun at &quot;all major conspiracy theories&quot;, but it does make us wonder how stringently Nintendo vets these descriptions, given that they&#x27;re likely to be read by younger players – despite the game&#x27;s age rating (because it&#x27;s rated &#x27;Teen&#x27;, no age gate is required).

Since its launch last October, Mario Party Superstars players have been getting their party on across boards that were first seen in the series&#x27; original three games available on Nintendo 64. It&#x27;s a whole lot of fun, but a few more boards and a larger roster of playable characters à la Super Mario Party would have made the experience even better.
Of course, as is often the case, fans have decided to take these potential improvements into their own hands, with one talented individual going all out to get a new character into the game. As seen in the video below, modder Sgt. Spike has managed to get Bowser Jr. up and running, complete with working animations and voice clips.

Dead by Daylight developer Behaviour Interactive has announced that the next update for the game will remove the ability for Leatherface players to wear the face of their victim&#x27;s character following reports from players of targeted racist harassment.
The game – an asymmetrical horror title that pits &#x27;survivor&#x27; characters against some of Hollywood&#x27;s most infamous serial killers – features Leatherface (AKA: &quot;The Cannibal&quot;) from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Like his movie counterpart, Leatherface is able to &#x27;wear&#x27; the skin of his victims, and it&#x27;s this feature that has caused issues.

Looking for a new and affordable RPG to sink your teeth into? Justice Chronicles launches today on Nintendo Switch.
The latest release from Kemco, this RPG actually appeared on the 3DS back in 2016. We gave that version of the game a 6/10 score in our review, saying, &quot;while there&#x27;s no masterful writing or great innovation at play here, an interesting battle system and tried-and-true gameplay loop means that Justice Chronicles succeeds as a slice of low-priced comfort gaming.&quot;

It turns out there have been some terrific optimizations squeezed out of that latest-generation Xeon Scalable platform on Intel&#x27;s Clear Linux. In this article is a look at the Ubuntu and Clear Linux performance on the flagship Xeon Platinum 8380 2P reference server back around the time Ice Lake launched and then again using the latest software packages that closed out 2021.</span>

So here comes Pupperazzi, nailing the zeitgeist as a game specifically about taking photos of dogs - who, of course, you can also pet. It&#x27;s now just two weeks away from release, with a January 20th release date.

                    <span>I have a strange relationship with Dead Cells. I picked it up in 2019 and played it for a while, by which point I&#x27;d clearly had my fill. No DLCs to my name, nothing. I&#x27;d done a big run and put the game down.
Fast forward to now. Suddenly I own the latest expansion The Queen And The Sea, plus all the DLCs that came before it. I&#x27;m nonchalant, thinking that I dropped the game for a reason. Surely I can&#x27;t be won almost three years later? Well, nope. I was wrong. The DLCs have opened my eyes to the game in ways I hadn’t anticipated. The combat is crunchy, the challenge is thrilling, and Dead Cells more than holds its own next to more modern darlings of the genre like Hades.

Of course they are. Should&#x27;ve guessed. While publishers like Square Enix, EA, and Take-Two are still contemplating NFTs, I am not remotely surprised that Konami are one of the first notable names to actually start selling useless digital junk. Next week, they will hold an auction for NFTs of videos, artwork, and music from early Castlevania games. Konami, man.

                    <span>Studio director and co-founder of Playground Games, Gavin Raeburn, has revealed that he’s leaving the company. 
First reported by Windows Central, he has revealed that after co-founding and working at Playground for 12 years, he’s retiring from the racetrack. This news comes two months after the studio put out its most successful title yet in Forza Horizon 5, which at the time of its release, also had the biggest launch of any Xbox Game Studios game ever.

“After 12 years working on five award-winning Forza Horizon games, Gavin Raeburn is leaving Playground Games as studio director,” Turn 10 Studio Head and Forza franchise lead Alan Hartman told Windows Central. “A founding member of Playground Games, we thank Gav for his leadership and contributions to the Forza franchise and wish him all the best.” 
Hartman said another Playground co-founder, Trevor Williams, will transition from General Manager to Studio Head effective immediately, replacing Raeburn. He also said the studio will continue to focus on updates to Forza Horizon 5 and the ongoing development of its Fable reboot, which was officially announced in 2020. 
As noted by Windows Central, Raeburn has quite the history in the racing genre, having worked on Codemasters’ TOCA series, Dirt, and Grid. He left Codemasters in 2009 to create Playground Games, which was acquired by Microsoft in 2018. 
There’s no word on what’s next for Raeburn or if he’s even staying in games.

                    <span>Riot Games have pulled the curtains back on the newest agent joining Valorant and her name is Neon. 
Revealed by way of a special agent trailer, Neon is a fast-paced electric shooter that seemingly specializes in zooming all over a given map quicker than any other agent in the game. The short story trailer, which runs less than three minutes, reveals that Neon is a Manila, Philippines-based agent with an excellent taste in music.

As you can see in the trailer, Neon is a fan of Entertain Me by Ylona Garcia and 88rising. She’s also seemingly a fan of dreaming about what players are going to accomplish on the battlefield using her powers. We see her sprinting and sliding all over the maps shown in the trailer, using her electricity to make it easier. However, it doesn’t seem like she’ll be able to shoot while sprinting so don’t expect to be the run-n-gunner Neon might appear to be. 
We also get a quick look at one of her abilities where Neon lifts two large and long walls of electricity in a straight line, walls that she’s free to run in and out of. 
The trailer also reveals that Neon will arrive in Valorant with Episode 4: Disruption, although a release date for this new episode (which is what Valorant calls its big updates) has not yet been revealed. However, the current battle pass ends on January 11 so some fans have speculated that Episode 4 will begin the following day on January 12. 
While waiting to learn more, check out our thoughts on the shooter in Game Informer’s Valorant review and then read about how Valorant’s director is no longer working on the game and instead working on a new secret project at Riot. Be sure to read about how a mobile version of Valorant is on the way after that.

                    <span>Virtual reality hasn’t caught on as quickly as some predicted, but VR headsets have managed to amass an impressive collection of software in the last few years regardless. And given Sony&#x27;s recent PSVR2 announcements, this could be a big year for virtual reality. If you just bought a Meta Quest or haven’t fired yours up in a long time, there are several great experiences to be had. We highlight some of the best VR titles out now for the Quest, from high octane music games to spooky shooters. Here are 10 VR games you shouldn’t ignore, in no particular order.

                    <span>Arcade1Up, makers of affordable arcade cabinets built at a manageable size to put in your home, is broadening its product line to offer a larger, full-size machine for collectors who want a more true-to-arcade experience. 
The first in the line of Arcade1Up&#x27;s Pro Series cabinets features a handful of games, centered around Rare&#x27;s classic fighter, Killer Instinct. What makes the Pro Series stand apart from its contemporaries isn&#x27;t its slate of games, though; it&#x27;s the construction of the cabinet itself.
Arcade1Up&#x27;s traditional home arcade machines stand somewhere between 47&quot; and 57&quot; tall, depending on whether you have it sitting on the height-boosting riser. The Killer Instinct Pro Series cabinet measures in at 67.5&quot; tall (or 5ft 6in), almost a foot taller than the typical cab with a riser s…</span>

                    <span>Nobody Saves The World, the upcoming action RPG from Guacamelee developers Drinkbox Studios, has a release date and it’s less than two weeks away. 
More specifically, it will be released on January 18 and as previously announced, it will hit Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC via Windows 10 and Steam for $24.99. However, if you’re an Xbox Game Pass subscriber or a member of Microsoft’s PC Game Pass, the game will hit those services on day one, meaning you can download them for free.

Hopefully, you’ve got a friend lined up to play Nobody Saves The World with, too, because the game features online co-op, although it does not feature cross-play so you’ll need to be on the same platform as your friend to play together. 
In Nobody Saves The World, you control a “featureless nobody” that can transform into a variety of different animals and creatures, including a slug, a ghost, a dragon, a rat, a robot, and much more. You’ll need to swap between over 15 different forms with mixed and matched abilities to unlock and complete quests to progress through the game’s narrative. 
Speaking of abilities, Drinkbox says there are over 80 different Form abilities, meaning each player will likely have their own customized build that works best for them. You might play as an egg that leaves a trail of slime behind you or a rat that shoots fireballs – the choice is up to you. 
If you’re interested in the soundtrack, which was created by composer Jim Guthrie (Below, Sword and Sorcery), it will be available for purchase on Steam and other platforms when the game is released on January 18. 
Nobody Saves The World was announced back in March and it quickly gained traction as yet another exciting title from Drinkbox. For more, watch this New Gameplay Today segment about the game.

                    <span>Bomb Rush Cyberfunk, the upcoming Jet Set Radio-inspired game by the makers of Lethal League, is all about style. With that in mind, what’s cooler than hitting a bunch of sick tricks set to a fresh soundtrack? Not much based on this latest trailer. 
Although the video doesn’t update players on when Bomb Rush Cyberfunk will drop, it does provide a glimpse into some of the cool moves you can pull off. Whether you’re tearing up the city on a pair of skates, a bike, or a skateboard, executing stylish rail grinds and nailing combos is not only fun but vital to progression. The crux of the game is tagging enough spots with your graffiti and out-tricking other crews to earn enough reputation to challenge them for territory control. Mastering traversal also matters for reaching hidden areas of the city that may contain secrets.

If this modern homage has you chomping at the bit to play it, developer Team Reptile promises in the video&#x27;s description that it&#x27;s “going in hard” to get Bomb Rush Cyberfunk out the door this year. The game is slated to arrive on Switch and PC.

                    <span>Marvel’s Spider-Man on PlayStation 4 was a real treat and its remastered version on PlayStation 5 was even better. Despite how great it feels to play as Peter Parker in both versions, one thing neither version could do was really put you behind the Spider-Man mask. 
However, one player has come up with a unique way to give people a way to see what the game looks like through Peter Parker’s eyes: stop-motion.

As you can see in YouTube video above, creator ItIsSpid decided to take on a daunting task to show us what swinging through Insomniac Games’ New York City is like on PlayStation 5, both via Peter Paker and Miles Morales, and it looks amazing. We’re treated to a minute and 40 seconds of hundreds of first-person screenshots (courtesy of the games’ impressive photo modes) and we’ve never wanted a first-person Spider-Man game more. 
Of course, it takes a couple of seconds for your eyes to adjust to the stop-motion effect but when it sings, it looks great. 
“Using Spider-Man PS5/Miles Morales PS5 photo mode, I decided to try and combine 850+ photos and make a first-person gameplay stop-motion,” ItIsSpid’s YouTube description reads. 
For more, check out our reviews of these two games in Game Informer’s Marvel’s Spider-Man review and Game Informer’s Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales review. Be sure to check out this reveal of Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 after that.

                    <span>Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Extraction is launching on January 20 and today, Ubisoft announced that it will hit Xbox Game Pass on day one. The company also announced that its own Xbox Game Pass-like service, Ubisoft+, will be coming to Xbox as well. 
Ubisoft first teased today’s Xbox-related news on Twitter before revealing shortly after that the next entry in the very popular Rainbow Six series, Extraction, will be on Xbox Game Pass and Game Pass for PC on the game’s launch day of January 20.

                    <span>The musou genre is a long-spanning one with dozens of entries in it, but despite that, it has remained relatively niche in the grand scheme of things. 
However, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild has helped buck that trend as Omega Force has revealed (on Twitter) that its Zelda musou, Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity, has shipped a whopping 4 million units since its release back in November of 2020. Of course, “shipped” is very different than “sold,” as this new statistic doesn’t necessarily indicate 4 million people have purchased the game, but manufacturers aren’t going to ship a game to storefronts when said storefronts have plenty in stock.

So while Age of Calamity hasn’t sold 4 million units, it has likely sold millions, which must be exciting for Omega Force. The team had to pull off quite the feat to make it a success, as creating a prequel to Breath of the Wild, one of the most celebrated games of all time, is no easy task. Omega Force even went a step further and created an expansion pass for Age of Calamity that furthered the prequel story by adding in controllable guardians, new weapons, and a rideable motorcycle to use in-game. These expansions also brought a new “Apocalyptic” difficulty to the musou as well as new challenges in the Royal Ancient Lab, new enemies, and more. 
For more about Age of Calamity, read this feature on why Omega Force made this musou a prequel in the first place, and then check out our thoughts on the game in Game Informer’s Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity review.

Game Informer first reported on December 29 that Fortnite was down due to server issues and after several hours of the battle royale being offline, Epic Games pushed it back online. They promised rewards to compensate for the downtime, too. The company didn&#x27;t announce at the time what those rewards would be, but the official Fortnite Twitter account revealed what we can expect today. 
As thanks for everyone’s patience during the December login issues, we’ll be kicking off a Power Leveling Weekend from 1/7 @ 7 PM to 1/10 @ 7 AM ET and granting everyone who logged in during Winterfest the new Crescent Shroom Pickaxe before it arrives in the Shop later…</span>

                    <span>Skull &amp; Bones has lost a co-director. 
First reported by Video Games Chronicle, Antoine Henry recently revealed on LinkedIn that he&#x27;s departing from Ubisoft after working for nearly 15 years at the company. Henry says he&#x27;s onto &quot;new exciting adventures&quot; very soon, which is great. Still, his departure from the company&#x27;s Singapore studio serves as yet another loss for the Skull &amp; Bones team, which has seemingly struggled to make any headway since its 2017 reveal. 
Game Informer chronicled Skull &amp; Bones&#x27; journey through development hell recently in Part 1 of our Video Games Stuck In Development Hell series (here&#x27;s Part 2 and Part 3 if you&#x27;re curious for more).

                    <span>Ghost of Tsushima is an ode to the filmography of acclaimed Japanese director Akira Kurosawa. So, it&#x27;s only natural that Sucker Punch&#x27;s visually stunning action/adventure game would find the same success as the samurai flicks that inspired it. Ghost of Tsushima is as popular as ever, with 8 million copies sold. 
We&#x27;re thrilled and amazed that #GhostOfTsushima has officially sold more than 8 million copies!

A recent tweet (seen above) revealed the game&#x27;s newest milestone: &quot;We&#x27;re thrilled and amazed that Ghost of Tsushima has officially sold more than 8 million copies! Thank you so much to everyone who has played since launch! We are so incredibly appreciative and grateful for the support!&quot; 
It&#x27;s no surprise that Ghost of Tsushima had such a sizable player base. Cutting-edge graphics (somehow made more impressive with the PlayStation 5&#x27;s Director&#x27;s Cut), fluid combat mechanics with flashy animations, and a story/game world inundated in Japanese culture and samurai lore help set Ghost of Tsushima apart from its contemporaries. Game Informer&#x27;s Matt Miller loved the vanilla game, awarding it a 9.5. In his impression piece on the Director&#x27;s Cut, he echoed the same shining sentiments from his original review while speaking to the added content:
&quot;I was happily surprised by the breadth, depth, and challenge of the Iki Island expansion. For new players, it will extend an already lengthy adventure into something more. Meanwhile, returning players should be thrilled at how well this experience dovetails out of an already stellar game. Iki Island is what I want out of single-player game expansions. And it&#x27;s further proof (as if we needed any more at this point) that Sucker Punch has a standout new property to continue building on.&quot;
I&#x27;ve been playing through the Director&#x27;s Cut myself and am completely enamored with Ghost of Tsushima&#x27;s art direction and overall vibe. What are your thoughts on Sucker Punch&#x27;s latest IP? Let us know down below!</span>

If you’ve watched any of Sony Pictures Entertainment’s marketing for its upcoming Uncharted movie, then you’re likely aware that it has its own take on the infamous cargo plane scene from the third installment of the video game series. 
In one of the highlights of Uncharted 3: Drake’s Deception, protagonist Nathan Drake attempts to crawl from one cargo piece to the next, back to the safety of a plane. Things don’t end well for him as the plane comes to a fiery crash, leaving Drake stranded in a desert. Sony’s upcoming Uncharted movie, which stars Tom Holland as Drake and Mark Wahlberg as mentor and right-hand man Victor “Sully” Sullivan, features a very similar cinematic, and after being teased throughout multiple trailers, the full sequence has been r…</span>

Technical specifications of PSVR2 have been posted on the PlayStation Blog which reveals all kinds of cool tidbit about the headset and controllers. PSVR2 will feature OLED 2000x2040 resolution screens per eye which…</span>

                    <span>Following the colourful luchador metroidvania violence of the Guacamelee! series, developers Drinkbox Studios are returning to punch up fantasy in an action-RPG. Today they announced a release date of January 18th for Nobody Saves The World, a top-down ARPG with where players can transform into everything from a rogue to a rat, and customise them to be even weirder. It will be on Game Pass, too.

                    <span>Ubisoft today announced a surprising upcoming addition to Game Pass: Rainbow Six Extraction will be available on Microsoft&#x27;s subscription service right from the start when it launches later this month. The monster-mashing spin-off from R6 Siege isn&#x27;t one of their full-price games, coming at a slightly cheaper £34, but still, damn, that&#x27;s a good get. And exactly the sort of game I likely wouldn&#x27;t buy new but would try on Game Pass.

Supposedly they were using stolen credit card info to buy Bits (Twitch&#x27;s virtuacurrency), which they would then donate to Twitch streamers who had agreed to give money in return in exchange for keeping a portion for themselves. This first came to light following Twitch&#x27;s big data leak last year.

S jeho pomocí může provozovatel stroje provést hardwarové odpálení určitých můstků, které fyzicky změní nastavení CPU tak, že bude fungovat už jen s daným strojem daného výrobce (přesněji řečeno bude svázán s konkrétním, výrobcem digitálně podepsaným firmwarem). Tedy například pokud by uživatel konkrétní desky Asus provedl z BIOSu přepálení můstků, bude procesor svázán s danou deskou (daným firmwarem) a nebude možné jej do budoucna použít například v desce Gigabyte.</span>

                    <span>Fortnite&#x27;s shop updates every day at 4 p.m. CT with new skins, emotes, and gliders to acquire, but the game map often changes without warning. That happened again today in a small way. If you explore slightly to the northeast of Logjam Lumberyard, you&#x27;ll find a new circular patch of dirt just beyond a hill. Investigating the scene reveals a large driller protected by IO guards at a landmark called Mole Team: Omega. That&#x27;s right, the Imagined Order (better known as IO) is back and it appears they drilled through the island.
Odds are we&#x27;ll see more IO troops on the island in the days and weeks ahead, likely culminating in a new story development. There&#x27;s a chance it could tie into The Foundation unlockables countdown, which currently sits at 30 days.
If you want to check out the drilling site, make sure you bring a weapon, as IO will open fire the second they see you. Look for a tent and you&#x27;ll find a large weapon cache. A launcher awaits on the far side of the dirt pile, so you should be able to make a quick getaway after getting the rare loot.
I can&#x27;t wait to see where Epic goes with this next. We&#x27;re still waiting for tornadoes and that strange six-legged purple monster to show up, but the arrival of IO is a nice surprise that should lead to a new antagonist showing up soon.</span>

                    <span>I’ve been pretty open about this recently, but a few years ago, there was a time when I was feeling overwhelmingly lonely. My days at work were mostly spent alone in a dark projection booth above a corporate auditorium. To spice up my evenings and force some human interaction on myself, I started playing Magic: The Gathering at a local game shop. I spent multiple days a week there, learning how to draft, build decks, and catch onto the lingo and language of the game. Slowly, I incorporated myself into the small group of regulars, and day by day, I felt less alone.
While shuffling decks and slinging spells against these new acquaintances, I noticed shared mannerisms and social archetypes people took on within my little corner of the Magic community. Let me tell you how pleasantly surprised …</span>

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been covering sports games for more than a decade now, and I&#x27;ve been playing them for nearly three times that long. Whenever I talk to anyone about the latest middling entry in Madden NFL or NBA 2K, the first question I always receive is, &quot;Should I buy this one if I already own last year&#x27;s?&quot; I used to have to think more about whether I&#x27;d recommend a sports gamer pick up the latest iteration, but over the last several years, the games have felt just that way: iterative. Now, my answer is always, &quot;How important is [this year&#x27;s tentpole feature] to you? How important is having the latest rosters?&quot; If even one of those is wishy-washy, my answer is either &quot;Wait for a sale&quot; or &quot;Just play last year&#x27;s game.&quot; This song and dance has only become more noticeable as the years have continued.

                    <span>Microsoft has revealed a collaboration between Xbox and nail polish brand OPI and, as expected, each color is themed after something to do with Xbox. 
While the nail polishes and the colors they come in look quite nice, there’s another interesting aspect to this collaboration. Purchasing the Xbox-inspired Spring 2022 OPI Collection gets you exclusive in-game Halo Infinite and Forza Horizon 5 content. Ride or shoot in style with the best-looking nails your controller has ever seen. 
As for the in-game content, the Xbox Wire blog post revealing this collaboration doesn’t exactly spell out what it is, but some pictures reveal that the collection gets you a Halo Infinite armor coating and what appears to be a skin for a car in Forza Horizon 5 (although it could be straight up an entire car).

                    <span>Nvidia, AMD, and Intel all had PC graphics-related reveals for today’s Consumer Electronics Show presentations, and as expected, the latter showcased more of its Arc GPU while the two former showcased multiple graphics cards that will soon hit the market (although who’s to say if buying them will be any easier).  
CES is an annual technology-focused conference where all kinds of electronics companies announce new products both for the mass market and for those more interested in experimental ideas. It’s where Samsung announced its new line of 2022 TVs that will feature Stadia, Nvidia GeForce Now, and NFT support and integration, and it’s also where Nvidia, AMD, and Intel pulled back the curtains on some heavily-rumored GPUs.

                    <span>Halo Infinite&#x27;s shop updates every Tuesday at 10 a.m. PT with new items that players can purchase with credits. Since the launch of the free-to-play multiplayer component, 343 Industries has done a nice job of offering up colorful items for players to purchase. The latest rotation doesn&#x27;t have much other than one cool item that ties into the return of the Fracture: Tenrai event.
The expensive item of the week is a 2,000 credit ($17.99) legendary mythic effect set called Enlightened Path, which adds pink rose petals to your Spartan&#x27;s footsteps, slides, and spawns. Also included in this bundle is a white mask called Grand Play that can be applied to your nameplate, armor, vehicles, and weapons. I have to point out that the price for this bundle is ridiculous, especially since the player usually gets an armor set at this rate.
The more interesting offering this week is the Meditative State bundle, with the standout piece being the Imperial Crest helmet attachment for the Yoroi armor core earned in the Fracture: Tenrai event. This set also offers a cool coloring option called Expressive Soul which adds samurai-like highlights to the armor in gold and green. The bundle is rounded out with a triumphant stance called Mirror Tale, and an epic charm called Black Opal. This pack is 1,000 credits.
If you want to focus on your weapons and pick up another high-priced bundle, the Blacksteel Katana set is rather striking, adding a dragon scale effect to the MA40 assault rifle. You also get Black Cat weapon coloring, a Tiger Energy charm, and a Sun and Shadow icon to apply to weapons, vehicles, and more.
The item of the day is the Desert Sun bundle, offering the Ryuu visor for the Yoroi armor, and a dull green armor coating called Forgotten Sands.
All told, this week&#x27;s offerings rank among the game&#x27;s worst to date. The good news, though, is Fracture: Tenrai is back and we can keep working on that battle pass.</span>

                    <span>If you’re an Apex Legends fan that’s been wanting more out of the game’s lore, Respawn has released a new installment in its Stories from the Outlands series centered on fan-favorite Bangalore. 
For those new to Stories from the Outlands, the series expands on the game’s lore by shining a narrative spotlight on its roster of Legends. Think of them as Respawn’s take on Blizzard’s Overwatch shorts. Gridiron sees Bangalore get torn between her responsibilities as a soldier and the relationship with her brother after the Battle of Gridiron. Clocking in at over eight minutes, the well-animated cinematic is a neat way of fleshing out of the game’s original favorites.

                    <span>Death Stranding Director’s Cut for PC has been announced and it’s coming sometime this Spring. 
It’s being published by 505 Games, the same publishing arm that published the original version of Death Stranding on PC last July, and will be released simultaneously on Steam and the Epic Game Store. This news was announced during Intel’s showcase during the ongoing Consumer Electronics Show today and Kojima Production’s latest game will take advantage of Intel’s XeSS supersampling technology. 
Released last September as a PlayStation 5 exclusive, the Director’s Cut features everything contained in the original version of Death Stranding, which first hit PlayStation 4 exclusively in 2019 before it hit PC in 2020, as well as graphical and performance-related improvements, new mechanics, and new …</span>

                    <span>Admittedly, it&#x27;d take very little for me to be on board with a Death Stranding Director&#x27;s Cut. It only needed to be more Death Stranding for me to be sold on revisiting Hideo Kojima&#x27;s latest vanity project. Luckily for me, that&#x27;s exactly what the Director&#x27;s Cut is. I love the original release, and this is a perfect excuse to dive back in. I think you should play it, too. But maybe not for the reasons you think. 
Death Stranding Director&#x27;s Cut is pitched as an expanded version of the base game that came out in 2019, the definitive version of Kojima&#x27;s vision. After 26 hours – and much, much more still to go – my knee-jerk impression is that the Director&#x27;s Cut moniker is marketing spiel more than anything. Still, there are some fun and creative new additions that enhance the overall experienc…</span>

At the end of Persona 5, we parted ways with a terrific cast of characters we grew to love over the course of a 100-hour story. Last year’s Persona 5 Royal gave us an excuse to revisit that same adventure with additional content, but fans yearned for an all-new journey. Persona 5 Strikers reunites the cast from the original game six months later for an all-new trip across Japan. Even though it drastically changes a few key elements of the experience, it still feels like a true, compelling continuation of the game that stole RPG fans’ hearts nearly four years ago.

As Final Fantasy XIV players know, a patch like 6.05 isn’t just any patch – it&#x27;s packed with new things for players to do and obtain. A quick scroll through the expansive list of patch notes reveals that to be true, too, as the new update features all kinds of additions like a new version of a raid, a treasure dungeon, new minions and mounts, and of course, some fixes and improvements as well.

Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4, first released in 2016, has sold more than 8.7 million units worldwide 
Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot, first released in January of 2020, has sold more than 4.5 million units worldwide 
Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – The Hinokami Chronicles, its most recent title released back in October, has sold more than 1.32 million units worldwide. 
Building off of that momentum, CyberConnect2 is ready to reveal its next game next month. According to Gematsu, Matsuyama said during the livestream that the team will announce a new game in February, with a planned release for it in the Summer. The CEO also said that the new title will definitely get people talking, and that it’s a game that “promises to be something that will shake the world,” Gematsu writes. 
Perhaps it’s a new game based on a very popular anime, or maybe the studio is returning to the .hack series it was first made famous for. Speaking of the .hack series, Matsuyama said the company is preparing for the 20th anniversary of it in June.

                    <span>Steam has existed in a grey area in China, technically not following rules which require all games be approved yet never drawing the ire of authorities. Many have long expected it to eventually be banned, though, especially after Valve partnered with Perfect World to launch the limited Steam China. This might now be happening. Maybe. Or it&#x27;s possibly being hindered, at least. This all started with a big stink on Christmas Day that led some to declare Steam had been banned by the Great Firewall which restricts access to many sites outside China, but the reality is not so clear cut.

                    <span>The vanguard of Intel’s 12th Gen Alder Lake CPUs had some seriously good chips in it – including two of the best CPUs for gaming overall – though there weren’t many models for aspiring PC builders on tight budgets. Now, though, Intel has used CES 2022 to launch the rest of the 12th Gen desktop lineup, adding loads of more affordable Core i5 and Core i3 processors on top of new Core i7 and Core i9 options. Intel also unveiled its new H-series, 12th Gen gaming laptop chips, which use the same hybrid architecture (combining powerful P-cores with smaller, less energy-intensive E-cores) as their Alder Lake desktop cousins.

Within a couple of hours of each other. But my stress is your gain, as there are and will be some major announcements on new kit, starting with AMD. Their freshly-announced hardware includes an assortment of new CPUs, desktop and mobile graphics cards and even some laptop APUs – APUs that sound a lot more useful for gaming that what current integrated graphics can offer. There’s even an Nvidia Image Scaling rival in the upcoming, driver-level Radeon Super Resolution feature.

                    <span>Nightingale certainly isn&#x27;t the sort of game I was expecting from a former BioWare developer, but I&#x27;m well excited to give it a go. Announced at The Game Awards 2021, Nightingale is a survival craft &#x27;em up set in a fantastical, alt-history world. It&#x27;s being made by Inflexion Games, a studio lead by Aaryn Flynn, former programmer and general manager at the Dragon Age and Mass Effect developers. 
But don&#x27;t go in expecting the sort of huge, arcing plotlines of BioWare&#x27;s recent games. While Nightingale will have an over-arching narrative, it&#x27;s being designed to offer up adventures that let you make your own stories. I spoke to Flynn at the end of last year to find out a little bit more about what that entails.

                    <span>Square Enix have ushered in the new year with a joyous message for those who play games to &quot;have fun”. Sorry, but those who &quot;play to earn” are key to their business model going forwards. NFTs, blockchain, and the &#x27;metaverse&#x27; are the future of fun. Whatever that means.

                    <span>Riot Games, the makers of Valorant and League Of Legends, have agreed to pay out $100 million (£74m) as part of a proposed settlement to a class-action suit brought against them for &quot;systemic sex discrimination and harassment&quot;. Money will go to current and former female employees and contract workers. The suit started in 2018 following widespread allegations of a festering workplace culture, and was originally due to be settled for $10 million (£7m) until California state authorities raised objections that it wasn&#x27;t enough.

                    <span>There’s always a city. There’s always a lighthouse. There’s always a man. There’s also always an opportunity for a company to create a new game in a franchise to make some money, and while I recognize that’s exactly why a fourth BioShock game is in development, it’s hard to stop myself from growing more and more excited about what it might be. 
BioShock Infinite, the last in the series, was released in 2013, and at the earliest, the next one, now in development at 2K’s new Cloud Chamber studio, hits next year. That’s a massive nine-year gap, which has hopefully given those at Cloud Chamber enough time to stir on what a new BioShock game needs and doesn’t need – it has for me, at least.

                    <span>Update, 12/31/21:
PlayStation announced earlier this week that Deep Rock Galactic, as well as Persona 5 Strikers and Dirt 5, will be the January 2022 PlayStation Plus titles, and now, new details about one of the games have been released. 
As first reported by VG247, Deep Rock Galactic will contain some PlayStation 5-exclusive features thanks to the console&#x27;s DualSense controller. More specifically, the DualSense touchpad can be used to control the Terrain Scanner in-game. Plus, the controller&#x27;s built-in speaker can be used by characters to tell you orders as if said characters are actually using a radio to communicate with you, as one might do when mining deep into an alien planet&#x27;s terrain.

                    <span>Ken Levine, the creator of the famed BioShock series, put out his last game, BioShock Infinite, in 2013. Shortly after, he closed the doors of Irrational Games, a studio he started in 1997. Most of the staff was let go, on short notice no less, but a handful of developers were hand-picked to join his new smaller studio startup, Ghost Story Games. 
That new studio, still under the helm of 2K and parent company Take-Two Interactive, began work on a new game – it’s that narrative Legos one Levine talked about years and years ago – in 2014. Now, eight years later, not a trace of that game has been seen by the public and a new report from Bloomberg reveals why. 
Sadly, what’s revealed in the report is not at all uncommon in video game development: poor leadership, employee burnout and frustrati…</span>

                    <span>It’s no surprise that Spider-Man No Way Home – the third film in Sony’s Tom Holland-led franchise – has reached impressive critical and financial heights. Fans have been waiting for a live-action Multiverse movie since Into the Spiderverse, and No Way Home continues to serve as the perfect answer to that enthusiasm. The movie garnered positive feedback from viewers and handily surpassed the box office numbers of every 2021 film. As of right now, No Way Home is Sony’s most successful movie of all time. And, according to Hollywood Reporter, it’s the first pandemic-era film to amass more than $1 billion at the box office. 
Deadline reported in December 2021 that No Way Home could ultimately come away with a $610 million net profit, which would boast higher numbers than Homecoming and Far From Home. This estimate might not be far-fetched because, on Christmas Eve, the latest web-slinger movie became Sony’s top-grossing domestic title ever. And as long as theaters stay open (who knows what the future may hold now that the omicron strain is spreading like wildfire), No Way Home will undoubtedly continue its staggering financial success this year. 
In his most daring adventure yet, Peter Parker and Doctor Strange accidentally tear open Multiverse doorways, bringing franchise-favorite villains like Doctor Octopus, Green Goblin, and Electro into the fray. This might be the most ambitious Spider-Man movie, but it won’t be the last time we see Tom Holland in the skin-tight suit, as the British star may appear in three more films. 
In Spider-Man games news, No Way Home-inspired skins are available in Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered, while Spider-Man and MJ cosmetics have launched in Fortnite. And if you want more MCU info, check out the new trailer for Doctor Strange’s In The Multiverse of Madness movie.

                    <span>Update 1/3/21 12:00 p.m.: It didn&#x27;t take long after posting our original story about former 343 Industries developer Aaron Linde leaving the company to find out where he&#x27;s headed next. In an incredible Neon Genesis Evangelion preview gag, Linde revealed he will be joining Riot Games R&amp;D. Mystery solved!

January 3, 2022

 
Original Story 1/3/21: Just a little under a month since the full release of Halo Infinite, its lead narrative designer, Aaron Linde, has revealed that he’s leaving 343 Industries. 
Don’t worry, though, as it’s not a breakup – Linde is departing 343 to “pursue a new opportunity in 2022.”
As a narrative designer, Linde’s hands are all over the story within Halo Infinite but it’s not just limited to cutscenes, main story m…</span>

                    <span>Hideo Kojima ended up tweeting his 2022 plans a week after the release of the Famitsu&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s ambitions feature, only this time he&#x27;s clarified some of what he may be working on. Kojima Tweeted this on January 1, saying, &quot;This year, I&#x27;m going to start a new work in earnest, and move to the next level of experimentation with a radical project. I&#x27;m also hoping to get the video team going. And I may start doing something like a radio project?&quot;
So, Hideo looks to be working on four main projects in different levels of development and progress. Two of which appear to be games or at least games-related in the &quot;new work&quot; he&#x27;s beginning, and the &quot;radical project&quot; that&#x27;s evolving more this year. The other two, though, are happening in the video and audio space, both of which I can see the Metal…</span>

                    <span>Next month marks two years since AMD introduced the Ryzen Threadripper 3990X 64-core / 128-thread processor. All of our testing of the 3990X on Linux over the past two years has been with the System76 Thelio Major, which continues holding up well with that US-assembled workstation with hand-crafted enclosure from Colorado. With System76 having recently released Pop!_OS 21.10 as the latest update to their Ubuntu Linux derived operating system and upcoming two year anniversary of the 3990X, it made for an interesting time to see how the performance of the Ryzen Threadripper 3990X and Radeon RX 5700 XT within that workstation has evolved.</span>

                    <span>The first rule of video game club (apart from not talking about video game club) usually involves saving the world somehow. We do our best to rescue others from harm, to avert world-ending disasters, and give everyone around us the happy ending they deserve. But if there&#x27;s one thing I&#x27;ve learned about myself in 2021, it&#x27;s that I&#x27;m a cruel, heartless robot who will happily toss others under the bus if they don&#x27;t provide any material benefit to me. Or at least I am when I&#x27;m playing Unsighted, the gorgeous and criminally underrated action RPG from Studio Pixel Punk that puts a ticking time-bomb inside each of its characters&#x27; metallic chests which, if left unchecked, will remove them from the game entirely, preventing you from gaining some potentially very handy upgrades to help you in your quest to fight back against your human oppressors. 
It&#x27;s an ingenious system, as you&#x27;re not only fighting against the hordes of enemies that appear onscreen, but your own ineptitude.

                    <span>If you&#x27;re anything like me, when you start a game you will almost invariably try to run off into the woods or swamp and aggressively ignore anything even passably resembling a main story. After hours of feeling like a brave rebel by doing this in Vagrus - The Riven Realms, I realised it&#x27;s how you&#x27;re supposed to play it. This is not a game about some Epic Quest or grand campaign. It&#x27;s a game about running a caravan in a world that just happens to have a cool history.

                    <span>Rok 2022 nezačal vůbec dobře pro všechny MS Exchange adminy. Ti musejí řešit chybu v on-premise instalacích serveru Microsoft Exchange, konkrétněji v komponentě Anti-Malware scanneru. Chyba spočívá v chybném datovém typu pro ukládání data, kdy vývojáři zvolili pro ukládání 32bitový signed integer a hodnota 2201010001 způsobí přetečení a následné nedoručení zprávy. Řešením je vypnout skenování zpráv, dokud nebude k dispozici oprava.</span>

                    <span>2021 was hot boy summer for detectives. Well, not summer. Hot boy autumn? Is that a thing? Anyway, I not only played Sherlock Holmes Chapter One, but also an incarnation of Hercule Poirot as a bright young thing in Agatha Christie - Hercule Poirot: The First Cases. And yes, that name is a bit of a nightmare, but the game itself is very sweet. There&#x27;s &#x27;orrible murder, conspiracy, blackmail, union busting, and a cast of Cluedo-esque characters trapped inside a snowy manor. And yes, I am reusing the shoddy Love Island promo photo composite I made for a header picture, because it deserves the mileage.

                    <span>Ghost Time Games’ Tux And Fanny, from co-developers Albert Birney and Gabriel Koenig, is not only the game I think you may have missed this year, but it is also my Game Of The Year for 2021. This game sends two best friends (alongside a courageous flea and a mischievous cat) through adventures great, small, and absurd to stunning effect – and you owe it to yourself to give this little marvel a play before the year is well and truly out.

Pro zjednodušení detekce zranitelností v rozsáhlých projektech vznikl Log4jDetect používající programovací jazyk Go. Stačí programu předložit adresář s projektem, který bude prohledán. Podporovány jsou balíčkovače gradle, maven a bundle.  K tomu budou prohledány soubory .jar a .gem. Log4jDetect funguje na Linuxu, macOS i Windows.</span>

                    <span>It’s pretty difficult to quantify which games actually whip ass, mostly because it’s a little subjective. That being said, if barrelling through the streets of a futuristic, neon-glazed Detroit, hopping over pursuing cop cars and racing through business offices and factories to the tune of an engrossing soundtrack doesn’t whip ass, I don’t know what does.

                    <span>Immersive sims are tricky games to get right. The spaces need to have incredibly tight design so they feel fun to explore, and lots of ways to get around them. And one of the best games of the year just happens to be one that does that expertly. Hang on, Deathloop? What are you talking about? No, no, the real best immersive sim this year is co-open by lowpolis, obviously!

                    <span>Diablo has, for good reasons, become a shorthand for describing the flavour of gothic, grimdark fantasy setting in games, where pus-filled demonic hordes and rotting, undead corpses scour a hellish cathedral looking for unwitting adventurers. For all its wretched decay, however, the series still feels like an indulgence to be savoured. Its clickiness and abhorrent sights make the games endlessly gratifying, and masterful butchery of fiends eases most players into a comfortable rhythm. And part of that appeal lies in the macabre yet captivating fantasy it so deftly peddles — all that blood, gore and guts really make for a grisly setting that’s nearly impossible to look away from.


Tainted Grail: Conquest conveys the same sense of blight and doom in its dark fantasy universe — one that’s a reimagining of Arthurian legends — but also ups the ante with a huge wallop of Slay The Spire’s roguelike, deck-building elements.

                    <span>As a child struggling to sleep at night I&#x27;d dream of three worlds. First and least of these was Desert World, a blithe eternity of golden sand always viewed from kilometres up, where fizzing white rings rose toward me like expanding surf. I&#x27;d try to find my way down to the surface, but always at the risk of glitching straight through and ending up in Snake World, where monstrous serpents emerged from darkened kitchens.


Somewhere between these two poles lay the realm of the Animals, not that they were really animals, but clouds of eyelash-thin mandible, grot and sparkle, like rotten food on the point of becoming a school of tropical fish. I loved Animal World. I used to spend hours trying to mind-hack my way into it. I was pretty shocked to find its likeness in Sluggish Morss: Pattern Circus - an irresistibly strange, gristly, sorrowful, comical and inventive album of creatures, songs, places and phrases from Jack King-Spooner and composer Helena Celle.

                    <span>It’s hard to imagine a collaboration between Zero Escape and Danganronpa creators Kotaro Uchikoshi and Kazutaka Kodaka going under the radar, but an odd release schedule (involving dropping a half-finished experience on Apple Arcade) saw interest in the collaboration buried by the time the game hit PC last month. Which is a shame, since it’s a rather unique title in their respective careers, and it charts new waters for these cult directors.


World’s End Club was the first game the pair released since forming their own studio, Too Kyo Games, and can best be described as a bizarre but intriguing blend of platforming and death games, starring a cast of prepubescent children way too young to be fixing the world or dealing with cults. Think Danganronpa, if Danganronpa was a Saturday morning cartoon rather than a murder game filled with psychopaths.

                    <span>Every year our clone forms degrade, and Katharine spends the winter break copying each consciousness into a new body. Don&#x27;t worry: we can&#x27;t feel a thing! Since our new forms are still coming online from their time spent in the primordial flesh soup vat of the RPS Treehouse, we can&#x27;t post over Christmas, so we&#x27;ve prepared some Christmas Cracker jokes instead! You can help fund the research into longer-lasting clone bodies with the RPS supporter program.
Now to enjoy your nice joke!
Q: What did Santa say to the elf struggling to pick up a heavy present?

                    <span>So this is Christmas, and what have you done? As Katharine said, we&#x27;re officially off until the new year but have lined up some guest authors and god-awful Christmas cracker jokes to tide you over until then. The death of the year does bring some sorrow, with Imogen leaving us, so do say goodbye if you haven&#x27;t already. Then, return to tell me: what are you playing this holiday?

                    <span>All right, folks, we&#x27;re now officially done and dusted for the year. 2021 is being brought to a close, and RPS is entering its annual hibernation period. We wish you a merry Christmas, a happy holiday, and a general Festivus for the rest of yous as we scuttle out of the RPS Treehouse for a couple of weeks and have a nice big sleep in our mountain of sweet wrappers. We&#x27;ll see you back bright and early on Tuesday January 4th 2022.

                    <span>If you like your RPG adventures to contain dungeons and dragons, and be as complex as Dungeons &amp; Dragons, perhaps you might fancy the latest game being given away free in the Epic Games Store&#x27;s festive sale. For 24 hours, Epic are handing out Pathfinder: Kingmaker free for keepsies. It&#x27;s a vast fantasy RPG based on the Pathfinder pen &#x27;n&#x27; paper system, played out in ye olde isometric perspective. The sort of RPG that&#x27;s fascinating to some, offputting to others—so a great candidate for a freebie.

Watching &#x27;til that morning comes creeping
Green Door, what&#x27;s that secret your keeping?
Jim Lowe&#x27;s Green Door might not be a Christmas song, but it sure can feel like one—especially inside the festive action of Dracula Cha Cha. That&#x27;s right, it&#x27;s Christmas Eve, which means one more night without sleeping, and time to play Dracula Cha Cha.

They&#x27;re named Takaya Kuroda &amp; Goodfellas and they have a Christmas song out. Not only is this excellent news, I can&#x27;t get over the fact it straight up sounds like Kiryu delivering some festive cheer. So get comfy, bang this on, and let Kiryu&#x27;s warm tones wash over you like mulled wine.

                    <span>Right now Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker is so popular you can’t buy it anymore. To prevent overcrowding and crashing servers, Square Enix have had to halt free trials and new sales to keep the game stable after an unprecedented surge in popularity this summer. Between that and the global shortage of materials to add more servers, it may be quite some time until new players are able to experience it. If you have an active subscription and manage to brave the long queues however, you’re one of the lucky few who get to experience something truly special. For everyone else: hang in there, it will be worth the wait.

                    <span>MERRY CHRISTMAS YA FILTHY ANIMALS! This time of year can be one that feels particularly apocalyptic, as well as, you know, good will to all I guess. If I have to. The indie games I&#x27;ve been playing recently all have a bit of an end-of-the-world flavour to &#x27;em, whether literal or metaphorical or by your own hand, if you feel like it. I dunno, I actually found them strangely relaxing, as a sort of counterpoint to the chaos of my own life during the holiday season. See what you think.

                    <span>The latest free game giveaway in GOG&#x27;s winter sale is an unexpected one for the festive season, but perhaps a game which captures the feeling of being trapped at a seemingly endless Christmas lunch with awful relatives: I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream. Nothing says &#x27;bad family Christmas&#x27; like being tortured for 109 years by a sentient supercomputer which nuked humanity and keeps only five people alive to torment. The 90s point &#x27;n&#x27; click adventure game is a grim one (so grim!), but one which does have its fans.

                    <span>In a special Christmas message from three of the NieR series&#x27; development stars, creative director Yoko Taro has announced that NieR is over. No more NieR games for us... unless he receives a massive pile of money. Quickly, it becomes clear he&#x27;s just joshing around. Another classic ruse from the man in the Emil mask, and a subtle hint that they may have something new in the works. Plus, it&#x27;s just a really delightful video and you should all watch it.

If you&#x27;re staring baffled at an endless list of innumerable deals, you could use some help. Honestly, most of our Steam Autumn Sale recommendations still stand, but the few of us in the RPS treehouse who haven&#x27;t already clocked off for the Christmas holiday do have some fresh picks for you too.

There&#x27;s some Christmassy-ness flowing in to tide me over, thanks to the mini-Christmas tree in my room. Every year it&#x27;s popped on the wardrobe alongside an honorary Lynx Africa. They share the same festive colours, after all.
Having pondered my tree for a bit, I thought about trees in games and how they make for good side quests. Now join me by the bark, as I examine why this might be the case in a roundabout manner.

                    <span>When I was younger I watched a nature documentary narrated by David Attenborough (I realise that doesn&#x27;t narrow it down) and in this nature documentary David told me about a cave. It is a very big cave, and every night a huge colony of bats come screaming out of the entrance. They spend the day clinging to the ceiling of this big cave, and all their bat poo falls down and has become a towering heap carpeting the floor.
But then David said look, the carpet is moving. And it turns out that the whole bottom of the cave is covered in cockroaches and giant centipedes. And if ever a small baby bat or an old injured bat falls, it is eaten alive by this hoard of chittering insects. This nature documentary haunted me, for it was the worst thing I could imagine happening.
Anyway, Nate has been to that cave and he&#x27;s going to tell us all about it for this episode of our supporters only podcast, The Nate Files. Thanks for being a supporter, pals!

                    <span>It&#x27;s been a busy, kind of mixed year for strategy games. Ever a broad church, 2021&#x27;s seen enough releases to keep ten of me busy, from the easy-going Legion War to the month-consuming Shadow Empire. I don&#x27;t know about you, but my personal &quot;to play&quot; list is out of control.
And yet, while we&#x27;ve had plenty to enjoy this year, it&#x27;s felt like a period of build-up to something bigger. I&#x27;m not one for looking forward. If a game&#x27;s not out yet it tends to disappear from my mind, making room for a hundred other recent releases in this age of plenty. That I&#x27;ve less interest in looking back over this year than I do pondering the next suggests that maybe we&#x27;re in for something special in the coming twelve months. Or perhaps it&#x27;s just been a rough one and I&#x27;m very sleep deprived and don&#x27;t want to think about 2021. Either way, let&#x27;s have a look at what&#x27;s in store for strategy fans in 2022, yeah?

But this one will kick hard enough to start the day again, and really puts the writing on the wall.

                    <span>Embracer Group are continuining to do their part in attempts to merge the entire video games industry into one megacorp, this week announcing another five intended acquisitions. Among these are Perfect World, the publishers of Star Trek Online and Torchlight, and the studio behind Scribblenauts Showdown, Shiver Entertainment. They&#x27;re also going transmedia, buying comics and TV company Dark Horse as well as an animation company and a video-on-demand network. Now they just need to get into food and housing, then our dystopian dreams of one corp owning our entire lives can come true.

                    <span>A recent round of BIOS updates for Dell and Alienware systems has turned out to be something of a bad batch. As first spotted by Bleeding Computer, multiple owners of Dell-made PCs – including the Alienware Aurora R8 and Inspiron 5680 gaming desktops, as well as the Latitude 5320 and 5520 business laptops – started developing big problems after installing the new BIOS versions. Failed boots, mainly, which of course makes it harder to apply potential fixes.

                    <span>Everyone knows there are two conditions that must be met before Christmas can officially begin. The first is playing Skeal. The second is the arrival of Steam&#x27;s Winter Sale. Blissfully, we can now tick both of these objectives off our to-do list, as Valve have finally unleashed their flurry of seasonal deals. Between now and January 5th, thousands of games will be discounted across Steam, and you&#x27;ll also be able to claim a free sticker every day as well, for those of you who enjoy that sort of thing.

As we prepare to put a full stop on the year and see out 2021 from our cocoon of Christmas chocolate wrappers, we must also sadly bid farewell to our news writer Imogen Beckhelling, who is heading off for a new adventure in the games industry in the New Year. Today is Imogen&#x27;s last day at RPS, so come and say goodbye.

                    <span>It struck me recently that I’ve not played as much of Halo Infinite’s multiplayer as I thought I would. I envisaged myself wiling away most evenings with my mates, playing Oddball and Slayer and laughing like someone from those video game adverts, swaying violently with a controller in hand.
I now know the reason why and I hate to admit it. Infinite doesn’t have a battle royale mode, which I&#x27;ve come to realise is the perfect FPS template for gaming with my mates. Something about it just works, you know? Listen, let me explain.

                    <span>I know almost nothing about Alfred Hitchcock. He’s the kind of archetypal director whose work I’ve been exposed to in bits and pieces without ever actually sitting down to watch one of his films in full. All of that is to say that, upon starting Alfred Hitchcock - Vertigo the game, I was in no position to judge whether it was a faithful adaptation of the film or to recognize all but the most obvious illusions to Hitchcock’s body of work (look, birds!). That’s okay, though, because as it turns out, Vertigo is an original story based on a collage of Hitchcockian concepts, not a direct adaption of the 1958 film by the same name.
Vertigo the game follows author Ed Miller as he grapples with a debilitating case of vertigo–a condition that leaves him unable to stand as the world appears to spin around him–and paralyzing guilt over the death of his daughter and her mother, Faye, after their car falls off a bridge into a ravine below. With Ed bed ridden, it’s up to Dr. Julia Lomas, psychologist and psychiatrist, and Sheriff Nick Reyes to unravel the mystery of what really happened, and whether Faye and his daughter even exist. My thoughts on how Vertigo goes about telling this story are... complicated.

                    <span>Final Fantasy XIV players haven’t had it easy these last few weeks. The sheer success of its Endwalker expansion resulted in lengthy login queues and server errors. It’s become so popular that Square Enix have temporarily stopped selling the game, taking its Starter and Complete Editions off sale. All the while, some low-poly grapes stayed static in the breeze. Jagged, delicious, minding their own business. Until their blockiness was papped and thrust into the public eye. Memes ensued and the grapes became the talk of the town, so much so that they’ve been smoothed out in the latest patch, much to everyone’s dismay.

We could do anything together, we four. And then we stumbled upon this door...

It&#x27;s a gorgeous-looking adventure that came out in early access back in October, but unfortunately the launch didn&#x27;t go as well as the devs had hoped it would. Yesterday, they announced that they&#x27;ve had to lay off around 25 employees to keep the studio going. They add that development will continue, albeit at an understandably slower pace.

                    <span>Hello folks. It&#x27;s been a funny old year, 2021. On the games side, it&#x27;s often felt like a year of shifting goalposts. Games that were delayed by the pandemic last year finally got their due in 2021, but in turn many of the releases we were expecting this year have inevitably slipped into 2022. The pandemic has affected games of all sizes this year, and I don&#x27;t think it will go down in the history books as one of our all-time greats. There were still plenty of fantastic games that came out this year, mind, and we&#x27;re still counting down our absolute favourites over in our Advent Calendar. 
That said, I do think 2021 will prove to be a pivotal year for RPS - and not just because I stole Graham&#x27;s key card and changed the locks on the front door of the Treehouse. It&#x27;s been a year of immense change here at the site, so I wanted to take some time to reflect on everything that&#x27;s happened this year, and look forward to what we&#x27;ve got in store for 2022.

                    <span>If you simply can&#x27;t get enough of raccoon detectives sleuthing around dystopian Vancouver, then you&#x27;re in luck, because more is on the way. Developers EggNut have announced that a new Backbone game is coming in 2022, dropping us back into the snowy, animal-filled city. We don&#x27;t know much about it yet, but Backbone is an excellent detective puzzle game, and a gorgeous one at that, so I have high hopes for the next one.

                    <span>After GTA: The Trilogy - Definitive Edition had a pretty naff launch last month, Rockstar ended up giving PC remaster owners copies of the oldies for free as an apology. The devs have another freebie for those folks too now - you can claim a free copy of GTA V: Premium Edition, GTA IV: Complete Edition, LA Noire, Bully: Scholarship Edition, or Max Payne 3 over the holiday period. Ah, free festive violence.

                    <span>We called Final Fantasy VII Remake a luscious spectacle that takes FF7 in a bold new direction. You know what else takes it in a new direction? Dresses. Loads of them. Modders have been hard at work weaving nice dresses with their virtual looms at a rate of knots. Oh, and they’ve morphed characters into Buster Swords and produced some other equally useful things too. Let&#x27;s have a gander at some of their most interesting creations.

                    <span>Update: Loop Hero&#x27;s time is done! The dino-battling FPS Second Extinction is the new freebie. 
Original Story: This year had us stuck in many video game time loops, but one of my absolute favourites was Loop Hero. I never thought an autobattler RPG would hook me the way it did, but I spent hours upon hours helping a little knight circle a seemingly endless void, and had a wonderful time doing it. If you didn&#x27;t have a chance to play it earlier this year, it&#x27;s now free on the Epic Game Store until tomorrow. I heartily encourage you to pick this one up, it&#x27;s one of our favourite games of 2021.

                    <span>The great thing about traditions is: you can just make them up. While some traditions feel more real because they&#x27;re embedded deeper in our culture, you can start your own whenever you want, and jettison any you don&#x27;t care for. Anything can be imbued with special meaning and, over time, grow into a tradition you cherish and come to anticipate. So here I am, approaching Christmas, so ready for my annual play of Skeal. Join me, reader dear.

                    <span>There’s no single, solitary reason why it’s been so hard to buy certain PC components over the past year and a bit – it’s more like a perfect storm of multiple circumstances, unfortunate coincidences and unforseen annoyances. That said, one of the biggest underlying causes of MIA CPU and graphics card stock has been a shortage of the chips needed to make them, and it’s a shortage that Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger has warned could likely continue into 2023.

                    <span>Oslain Brante tried to be a decent guy. Kind to his relatives except the one who murdered him. Resolutely loyal to his friends, even dying for one. Willing to die once again rather than betray his revolutionary allies. But it just kept going wrong for reasons that felt utterly artificial and sometimes deeply dissatisfying.
I&#x27;d have given up on the game if it weren&#x27;t so interesting. For one thing, none of those deaths were final. He died as a child and came back. He died as a teenager and came back. These were not saved games, but ordinary occurrences. It&#x27;s an interesting world made infuriating by awkward design choices.

                    <span>A new Cyberpunk 2077 mod makes the dystopian RPG&#x27;s decorative monorails functional, adding a metro system with cute wee trains you can ride. For all the game&#x27;s flaws, I did greatly enjoy wondering Night City&#x27;s streets, cooing at giant buildings and bright colours, and today I was glad to continue that tourism on rail. How lovely to see the megacity from a new perspective, looking down on rooftops and being buzzed by hovercars. See a wee bit of my journey in a video below.

                    <span>I’m rubbish at the building component of Minecraft; it’s much easier to simply download a map and wander around in the splendour of someone else’s creation. And if you’ve got the ray tracing beta version of Minecraft for Windows installed, I can heartily recommend you too take a wander through the Nvidia RTX Winter World: a vast, Christmassy and very, very pretty custom map that has you helping Santa throw a festive shindig while you trade sweets with his elves.

The awards which celebrate literary works in the science-fiction and fantasy genres, added a special one-off &#x27;Best Video Game&#x27; category this year, which is where old Zagreus picked up his accolade. Our short king&#x27;s battle out of the underworld beat out its closest competition, cosy escapism simulator, Animal Crossing: New Horizons in the polls by almost fourfold.

                    <span>I had some fun with the Wargame series of real-time strategy games, although past a certain point I couldn&#x27;t tell the difference between its umpteen historical tanks. Now developers Eugen Systems are making a spiritual successor called WARNO, which is coming to Steam Early Access next month.

This second series arrives almost exactly two years since the first, but work is already underway on the third. Showrunner Lauren Schmidt Hissrich says that season three&#x27;s scripts are &quot;almost done.&quot;

                    <span>The new trailer for Dead Cells&#x27; next DLC The Queen And The Sea features a shark being both swung like a sword and launched like an arrow. It&#x27;s almost enough to trick me into thinking I should play it, when deep down I know I&#x27;m not good enough to get anywhere with it. For those of you more skilled than me, the trailer comes alongside the news that the DLC will launch January 6th.

Now listen, I know it&#x27;s normal to get nervous before a big trial - it&#x27;s only our sense of taste on the line, after all - but trust me, I&#x27;ve got the best and most experienced defence team lined up for this one and - wait, what&#x27;s that? They&#x27;ve only been in training for three months? And they&#x27;re not even properly qualified? Oh no, what have we done...

Only kidding! I mean, statistically speaking I probably wouldn&#x27;t get on with all of you, but I actually really appreciate that you&#x27;re taking the time to read this and check out what games we&#x27;ll be playing this weekend. In fact, we&#x27;ll probably play loads of games over our breaks, but we&#x27;ll tell you about those later. Until I see you again, have a lovely time celebrating the end of the year, however you do it.

                    <span>Walking through the smoggy jerktown that is London a while back, the thought occurred that for all the building games I&#x27;ve played, I&#x27;d never seen one about remodelling an existing city. The closest I knew was NIMBY Rails, which isn&#x27;t even close.
It turns out I was miles behind the curve, as The Architect Colon Paris already exists.

                    <span>Earlier this year, Black Isle Studios and Interplay Entertainment announced they were porting the old 2001 hack and slash Baldur&#x27;s Gate: Dark Alliance to PC and consoles. It came out on PlayStation back in summer, alas they didn&#x27;t give a date for PC. But, surprise! It&#x27;s today! PC folks can finally try out the Baldur&#x27;s Gate that console users first experienced 20 years ago. I did a full playthrough this summer and had a lovely time, at the expense of my partner, who I made sit through one of the jankiest couch co-op games in existence.

                    <span>This week&#x27;s episode of the Ultimate Audio Bang is both festive, but tinged with sadness. It&#x27;s Imogen&#x27;s final run of the pod and I&#x27;m very sad about it. But we (I) gather ourselves and chat FPS news, like how PUBG is going free to play, Overwatch actually has something new, and lots of Halo Infinite stuff. We also get one final update on Imogen&#x27;s Apex Legends rank. I&#x27;d love to say it&#x27;s positive, but it&#x27;s actually quite crushing. Merry Christmas.

                    <span>Remember when the Devotion developers Red Candle showed off a tiny snippet of a pretty 2D game they&#x27;d been working on earlier this year? They didn&#x27;t have much to say about it at the time, but last night they announced it properly. Named Nine Sols, it&#x27;s an action platformer with combat inspired by Sekiro. Honestly, they still don&#x27;t have much to say about it beyond that, but they have released a gorgeous poster featuring a cat-like character that you can see in full below.
