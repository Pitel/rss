In his latest chat with Axios, he&#x27;s passed on a message to the rest of the games industry about the importance of emulation moving forward - calling for industry-wide support in order to preserve gaming&#x27;s history and allow players to play and access the games they want across all generations.

Pro přístup ke kamerám je nově využívána standardní knihovna libcamera. To přináší spoustu výhod. Na druhou stranu už nejsou podporovány příkazy raspicam a knihovna picamera a to je pro řadu uživatelů problém. Aktuálně jim nezůstává nic jiného, než se vrátit k Raspberry Pi OS Buster.</span>

It&#x27;s a demo Halo fans will never forget. In 2020, developer 343 Industries brought its latest take on the Halo franchise to the masses during one of Microsoft&#x27;s digital events. Halo Infinite&#x27;s gameplay debut was met with some positivity but spawned an online firestorm and popularized conversation around Craig The Brute, among other discussions. It&#x27;s been over a year since fans were shown that demo, and a lot has changed ahead of Halo Infinite&#x27;s campaign release on December 8. Before that long-awaited day, join us for a unique updated look at the campaign in all its new shining glory.
Today&#x27;s video isn&#x27;t a complete one-to-one recreation of the 2020 footage, but rather a potent illustration of how the team has improved upon that earlier foundation, including …</span>

                    <span>Update, 11/17/21:
The physical deluxe edition of Kena: Bridge of Spirits will be out this Friday. 
Detailed today in a new press release from Kena dev Ember Lab and Maximum Games, this deluxe edition of the PlayStation-exclusive game will cost $49.99. It will include a digital soundtrack, a retail exclusive physical sticker sheet, a unique digital in-game silver staff for Kena to use, a golden Rot character skin, and “unique celebration hats for the Rot.” 
Maximum Games says the deluxe edition will be sold in “popular retailers” and can be purchased directly from its website. The game will continue to be sold as a standard digital edition release for $39.99 and a digital deluxe edition for $49.99 on PSN, too.

                    <span>Released on the Nintendo DS in 2006 in Japan and 2007 everywhere else, Pokémon Diamond and Pearl started the fourth generation of games, with the third entry, Platinum, coming three years later. This introduction to the region of Sinnoh ushered in a whopping 107 new monsters for trainers to collect, befriend, and battle. 
With the Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl remakes releasing this week (here&#x27;s our review), we thought it would be fun to do a casual ranking of the top 25 Pokémon introduced in the fourth generation games.
Here are a few things to keep in mind while perusing this list: 
These rankings are based on factors ranging from power to popularity, rarity, memorability, or just because I happen to think they are neat.
Your favorites may differ, and that&#x27;s more than okay.

                    <span>343 community director Brian Jarrard took to Twitter yesterday to address something that&#x27;s getting a lot of chatter as players begin to jump into the free-to-play Halo Infinite multiplayer experience. The topic might surprise you, as it&#x27;s not about any weapon being overpowered or a map being weak but rather something else entirely. So what is all the discourse about? The battle pass, of course!
Thank you to everyone who has jumped into the #HaloInfintie beta so far! FYI the team is looking at Battle Pass progression and gathering data from yesterday&#x27;s sessions and we&#x27;ll share updates as we have them. Please continue to share feedback and raise flags as you see them. 1/3

                    <span>Eidos Montreal dropped an update for Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy today that makes the space-faring comic book adventure look and run even better. 
On PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, the game now features ray-tracing, meaning the lighting is more realistic than ever. You can activate the feature in the Video Settings menu.
On Xbox Series S, players have the option to uncap the framerate to run between 30 and 60 frames-per-second. Eidos recommends this feature to users with a VRR (variable refresh rate) display and warns that some framerates may be unstable in certain areas. 
Meanwhile, base PlayStation 4 players can enjoy an overall performance boost. Eidos even tweaked the sensitivity for the visor to register inputs from older, more worn-down controllers. 
The patch also adds the following improvement across all versions of the game:
Save Rollback: A hidden Save Rollback feature was added to allow users who have encountered blocking issues to rollback to the start of the chapter of their choice
General stability improvement on all platforms
Multiple stability improvements with Ray Tracing enabled
General improvements to objective markers
Additional improvements to world boundaries
PC players can expect the patch as early as Friday, November 19. Furthermore, Eidos has also squashed several bugs, the full list of which you can view on the developer&#x27;s Reddit post. 
For more on Marvel&#x27;s Guardians of the Galaxy, be sure to check out our full review of the game here. The title is nominated in a few categories for The Game Awards 2021.</span>

                    <span>Yesterday, The Wall Street Journal published an extensive report detailing evidence that Activision CEO Bobby Kotick was aware for years of the company’s long history of sexual misconduct. The report also points to Kotick withholding information about these events from the board of directors and surfaces abuse allegations levied at Kotick himself. You can read the full story here, but the revelations sparked an industry-wide outcry that resulted in over 100 Activision Blizzard employees staging an impromptu walkout yesterday demanding Kotick’s resignation. It now appears that a group of shareholders is echoing the same sentiment.

In a tweet this morning on the Street Fighter Twitter account, the streaming event is set for Tuesday, November 23, and promises a gameplay showcase for Luke and a behind-the-scenes look at the character. In previous updates, Capcom has shown footage of mocap sessions, shared design insights, and music/merch collaborations, along with the gameplay breakdowns.

Luke was revealed in August to be the last addition of the Season 5 character pass and Street Fighter V as a whole, following a parade of returning favorites from Street Fighter and adjacent series Rival Schools. In the event where he was revealed, Street Fighter V&#x27;s developers described Luke as a glimpse at the future of the series. He&#x27;s dressed for a fight with MMA gear, including lightweight gloves and sponsor-laden trunks. His move set featured quick strikes and speedy, impactful projectiles, though we&#x27;ll have to see how this has changed in the time since the reveal. Hopefully, we&#x27;ll also get more hints at what to expect in an upcoming Street Fighter game.

                    <span>If you’ve ever wanted your palico or palamute in Monster Hunter Rise to look like Sonic and Tails, now’s your chance. 
That’s because Sonic and Tails are (kinda) coming to Monster Hunter Rise in a new collaboration that goes live on November 26. The official Monster Hunter Twitter account posted a one-minute video today featuring the groovy basslines you’ve come to expect from Sonic music alongside footage of palico Sonic and palamute Tails in-game. 
OH YEAH! @Sonic_Hedgehog collaboration coming in FAST!

Look, I’m not Sonic expert but I have to be honest: palico Sonic works so much better than palamute Tails. The palico actually looks like the blue dude who likes to go fast – you could convince me that’s just actually him. The palamute, however, looks like a dog that someone’s dressed up to be like Tails. I don’t know if any of this matters to players – it probably doesn’t – but if I’m going for the full gold rings experience, I’m rolling with Sonic. 
It’s cool regardless that both are in-game; it&#x27;s even cooler that the palico can seemingly turn into Super (Saiyan) Sonic too. 
As noted in the announcement video, this Monster Hunter Rise x Sonic The Hedgehog collaboration will go live on November 26. That day, an event quest will go live and it yields not just the palico and palamute armor pieces as rewards, but some Hunter armor as well. Complete this quest and your entire squad can roll out at the speed of sound in style. This collaboration will hit the PC version when it launches in January. 
While waiting for this collaboration to go live, check out Game Informer’s Monster Hunter Rise review and then read where Monster Hunter Rise ended up on this year’s Game Awards nomination list. Read about how Monster Hunter Rise won’t have cross-save or crossplay with Switch when it hits PC this coming January.

                    <span>The studio behind the Yakuza series and the Judgment series, Ryu Ga Gotoku, is working on a new franchise, but it won’t be connected to either of their beloved crime-related series. 
This news comes from Video Games Chronicle, which reports that studio director Masayoshi Yokohama told Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu that RGG is planning a new game separate from the Yakuza or Judgment series. 
“We’re also working on unannounced titled outside of [Yakuza and Judgment],” Yokoyama told Famitsu. 
If you’re worried about not getting more Yakuza as a result, though, don’t fret – RGG has already confirmed that a sequel to Yakuza: Like a Dragon is in the works, even though series creator Toshihiro Nagoshi has departed from Sega. The future of the Judgment series, however, is not so guaranteed. As noted by VGC, after an alleged dispute between Sega and lead actor Takuya Kimura’s talent agency, it’s unclear if the series even has its leading actor to rely on for the role of Takayuki Yagami. 
Yokoyama said RGG “will continue to cherish the Judgment series” when talking to Famitsu, so that’s something. Only time will tell what comes of it, but now we know a new franchise is in the works at the studio.
While waiting to learn more about it, check out Game Informer’s Lost Judgment review and then read Game Informer’s Yakuza: Like a Dragon review. Check out this story about Yakuza series creator Toshihiro Nagoshi’s departure from Sega after that.

Originally released in 2006, Pokémon Diamond and Pearl ushered in a new generation of Pokémon games onto the Nintendo DS. With the themes of evolution and creation woven throughout the story, the upgraded designs of the new Pokémon found throughout the Sinnoh region, as well as newly discovered evolutionary lines of fan-favorite monsters, these games felt like a notable step forward for the franchise. In remaking these classics new Pokémon developer ILCA proves it can handle recreating the crucial tenants of the franchise.
For the most part, Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl are “faithful remak…</span>

                    <span>Saints Row graced the cover of Game Informer magazine last month and looks to be a modern reboot of the GTA-inspired and wildly/hilariously inappropriate franchise from over a decade ago. And with Deep Silver Volition developing the title, the nostalgia factor is at an all-time high. Saints Row was originally slated for a February 25 release, but a new statement from Volition chief creative officer Jim Boone weaves a different, more deflating story. Sadly, the Saints Row reboot is being delayed to summer 2022.

                    <span>[insert game here], I choose you!
This week brings the launch of Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, the 4th-gen remasters/re-imaginings that add a Chibi-style and some quality of life tweaks compared to the DS originals. Naturally it&#x27;s got us thinking a little about the long history of the series, especially as we only gave the newest release a modest recommendation — over the course 25 years, at which point has the Pokémon franchise been at its gaming peak?
Our views are a matter of record, but we want your views on the best Pokémon games. We should stress we&#x27;re focused on mainline entries; the Pokémon franchise has had more spin-off games than this writer&#x27;s had hot dinners, so we thought it&#x27;d be best to keep it focused. But which generation and entry is the best in your view? Are you driven by nostalgia and a certain purity to the older games, or do you enjoy more modern entries with all the online functionality and 3D worlds? It&#x27;s time to give your own review scores and celebrate the best Pokémon games ever.

About a year ago Sam &amp; Max Save The World was revived and brought to Switch, and the return of Telltale&#x27;s game was rather good. Now publisher Skunkape has confirmed that it has once again teamed up with Telltale veterans to bring us a remaster of Sam &amp; Max: Beyond Time &amp; Space. It&#x27;s not far away, either, arriving on the Switch eShop on 8th December.
It looks pretty good in the trailer, and some follow-up social media posts suggest that once again it&#x27;s been carefully spruced up for a modern audience.

                    <span>Hands-on with the troubled fighter that&#x27;s coming to Switch soon.
Paprium&#x27;s road to release has been quite a tumultuous one, to put it mildly. The product of WaterMelon Games&#x27; &#x27;Magical Game Factory&#x27; crowdfunding campaign which kicked off way back in 2012, this scrolling fighter was intended to push the Sega Mega Drive / Genesis hardware to its absolute limit via custom chips and ingenious programming techniques. WaterMelon, you might recall, is the indie behind Pier Solar, another Mega Drive release that eventually made its way to the Wii U. Given the surge of interest in retro games of late – and the mini-revival in the belt-scrolling beat &#x27;em up genre – it&#x27;s easy to see why Paprium garnered so much attention when it was officially announced for pre-order back in 2017. However, since then,…</span>

Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl are just two days away from launching on Nintendo Switch and as is the case with any Pokémon release, they&#x27;re sure to be put under the highest scrutiny from fans all around the world.
Reviews for the games have started flooding in today, including our very own, so we&#x27;ve gone ahead and rounded up a selection of quotes and review scores from a number of different outlets. Below, you&#x27;ll see just how well they&#x27;ve gone down with the media ahead of this Friday&#x27;s launch.

It’s always difficult to know just how much of a game to change when you’re remaking it, and that is certainly true when it comes to the insanely-popular Pokémon series. Go too far, and you risk alienating the audience, as was evident with the enjoyable but somewhat simplified Let’s Go! Pikachu and Eevee Switch remakes of the original Pokémon Red and Blue. If you manage to combine the elements that have advanced the formula in the years since, though, you can create some of the very best games in the franchise, as was the case with HeartGold and SoulSilver on DS. Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl fall somewhere in the middle; a pair of titles that offers a great opportunity to pick up some of the Sinnoh Dex that is missing from the current mainline Sword and Shield games, but ultimately an adventure you probably won’t return to once you&#x27;re done.
There’s a strange feeling of obligation to these remakes. Generation 1, 2 and 3 have all received stellar reimaginings, and Generation 4 felt like the odd one out. However, instead of a Game Freak-helmed remake and love letter to the generation, ILCA, the studio handling Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, has changed the art style for the worse and failed to include many elements from the generation’s best game, Pokémon Platinum.

                    <span>Stranger things have happened in the Tokyo suburbs.
Not too long ago we shared the news that The Kids We Were was due to arrive on Switch early next year; it&#x27;s a rather charming game following adventurous kids in the Japanese suburbs, featuring time travel and some lovely visuals. It turns out that it&#x27;s closer than originally thought, now due to arrive on the eShop on 2nd December priced at $15.99USD (and regional equivalents), but with 20% off on pre-orders.
Developed by GAGEX (which is known for feel good and nostalgic games), it&#x27;s a narrative adventure game that adopts blocky voxel-style visuals - think The Touryst but with a calmer colour palette. On mobile it&#x27;s had plenty of positive reviews, while the game has also won various awards on the Japanese scene. It involves a bit of time travel, a &#x27;Back to the Future&#x27;-esque quest and a setting of 1980s Tokyo suburbs.

Last month, The Pokémon Company kicked off a &#x27;Super Pet Contest&#x27;, inviting fans to submit photographs of their pets to win some awesome prizes. The results are now in, so let&#x27;s take a look at the adorable winners.
Inspired by the Super Contest Shows featured in Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, the competition received over 30,000 entries in total. Fans had to enter their pet into Clever, Cute and Cool categories, mimicking the games, and the winners were selected via an initial public vote and a final decision made by a panel of judges which included Michelle Visage.

Remember Sail Forth? The ocean adventure game that, by very definition, gives off strong Zelda: The Wind Waker vibes and is planned to launch on Switch? Well, we have good news and bad news.
The good news is that a brand new trailer has been released (above), showing off some new gameplay and a selection of quirky NPCs and creatures you&#x27;ll be meeting in the game. &quot;The open sea is calling,&quot; the press release reads. &quot;Are you ready for an adventure that will unearth long-buried mysteries and change the world?&quot;

                    <span>Yes, they use the song.
You may have grown tired of us saying that Monster Hunter Rise is darn good, but it is, and Capcom has also been serving up regular free updates to keep it fresh. Pleasingly this has had a few quirky DLC crossovers just like in the old days, with the next in line being the return of Sonic the Hedgehog (and Tails).
Capcom has now confirmed that this will arrive in a free update on 26th November, and treated us to a delightfully over the top trailer. As with other collaborations it&#x27;ll make use of layered armor for you and your buddies to give a feel of having Sonic and Tails on your game, albeit without any particularly wild gameplay changes. We&#x27;re not sure where the rings come into it in the trailer, but either way we&#x27;ll have unlockable outfits via an Event Quest.

Following on from the Metroid Dread demo late last month, Nintendo has now released another one - this time for its upcoming title Big Brain Academy: Brain vs. Brain.
If it looks or sounds familiar, it&#x27;s because it was originally released during the Nintendo DS era way back in 2005/06. The new version arrives on the 3rd of December and will be priced at $29.99 USD or your regional equivalent. It comes with multiplayer and touch screen support, too.

                    <span>Are the tiny computer people who write all the information down on the hard disks inside your PC old and tired? Yeah, mine too. Well, I have good news! The superb Samsung 870 Qvo 2TB SSD is the cheapest it’s ever been here in the UK. RPS Supreme Overlord Katharine checked it out way back in 2020 (wait, that’s only last year) and proclaimed it “a bit good.”*

                    <span>If the new League Of Legends Netflix series Arcane has you in the mood to explore more of Runeterra, then you&#x27;re in luck. Yesterday, Riot Games launched not one, but two new spin-off games. Ruined King is an RPG with turn-based combat in which you&#x27;ll explore the world with a party of League champs. Then, Hextech Mayhem is a cute-looking rhythm runner.

                    <span>If you haven’t heard, we&#x27;re in the middle of an indiepocalypse. It’s probably not the kind you’re thinking of; it doesn’t spell doom for the independent games scene. This one is a monthly compilation of games all in one conveniently packaged digital zine, from a variety of diverse creators. That Indiepocalypse. 


Indiepocalypse is composed of 10 games every month, one of which has been commissioned by Editor in Chief Andrew Baillie personally. Started in February 2020, the zine has already managed to rack up 22 issues, as well as one bonus issue. You never know what you’re going to get from one issue to the next, each one platforming small games that likely wouldn’t succeed elsewhere. There’s no exclusivity clause either, meaning developers are free to do what they want with their games outside of the zine. Most importantly, every developer included is paid. Baillie spoke to me about how and why Indiepocalypse started.

                    <span>Developers 343 Industries surprise-launched Halo Infinite&#x27;s multiplayer this week on Xbox&#x27;s 20th birthday, and so far it seems that folks are finding it fairly fun to play. But a lot of players have one major grievance: the battle pass is a massive grind. Complaints about challenges that award very little XP are all over the game&#x27;s subreddit. Fortunately, the devs have seen this feedback, and are already looking into the slow progression.

                    <span>There’s something about Call Of Duty: Vanguard and its multiplayer modes that feels thin. Much like my time with the game’s campaign, I’m left wanting. This is a World War II veneer glossed over a Modern Warfare canvas, with familiar pacing and shooting, but ultimately lacking the weight of Infinity Ward’s reboot.
As a Call Of Duty multiplayer experience, Vanguard delivers. But what it delivers is a stop-gap. An FPS experience that isn’t concerned with pushing the series forwards, or taking risks. Fans will have fun, sure, but its deathmatches and dominations are stuck in the past. Not to mention Zombies, which is too eager to turn back the clock.

                    <span>Over 150 Activision Blizzard employees held a walkout yesterday demanding the removal of CEO Bobby Kotick, after a new report unearthed more allegations of sexual harassment and misconduct. The Wall Street Journal even claim that Kotick himself had allegedly threatened to have someone killed. This is the second walkout workers have held this year following the first lawsuit that made allegations of widespread discrimination and harassment.

                    <span>Less than three months after announcing the reboot Saints Row, the makers have announced they&#x27;re delaying its launch by six months. Previously due on February 25th, 2022, it&#x27;s now due on August 23rd. It&#x27;s the usual sensible reason: the pandemic has messed with anyone attempting to do anything, and they want more time to make it good. Please do!

                    <span>New World, Amazon Games&#x27; opening move into game dev, was not always an MMORPG. It used to be a survival horror game. According to Katy Kaszynski, senior producer at Amazon Games, the team got really far down that road. &quot;They created it. That was before my time, but that game was almost done,&quot; Kaszynski tells me, just after delivering a presentation on New World&#x27;s development at this year&#x27;s Develop Conference in Brighton. &quot;They really thought it was going to go alpha, launch, and they were going to ship that out.&quot;
A survival horror is pretty different from the jaunty, vaguely piratical, magical fantasy RPG that New World is today: lush forests, sunny grassy plains, and factions engaged in an endless war for territory. So what happened? According to Kaszynski, it&#x27;s all down to Amazon&#x27;s first &#x27;Leadership Principle&#x27;: Customer Obsession.

                    <span>Stranger of Paradise Final Fantasy Origin has already graced us with several demos and a look at what&#x27;s to come ahead of its March 2022 release, and today Square has unveiled some more locations and characters from the world. As we have already seen, this action RPG that&#x27;s packed with elements from the Nioh titles also draws quite heavily from the world of Final Fantasy. Specifically, the world, music, characters, enemies, and more are all quite rooted in the original NES title. Of course, these aspects all look quite different today and have been massively altered to fit an action game, but you can absolutely see it.
Today, we get a look at a town and a character from early on in Final Fantasy, right before players obtain the boat and can begin enjoying ocean travel. In Final Fantasy, you…</span>

After announcing Rambo and Stranger Things would eventually become a part of Far Cry 6, Ubisoft added yet another license to the mix. This one has a great tie to antagonist Antón Castillo, who is brought to life by actor Giancarlo Esposito. Players can now download Breaking Bad-inspired bundles to bring Los Pollos Hermanos restaurants and trucks to the world.
Esposito won&#x27;t be in character as Breaking Bad&#x27;s Gus Fring, but his eateries will certainly remind you of him. You can also wear Heisenberg-themed gear to further blend the game and TV show universes.
No half-measures here! Hide in plain sight at Los Pollos Hermanos or channel your inner Heisenberg with these bundles inspired by the smash hit television series. pic.twitter.com/q8xctfNLce

This new content also ties into today&#x27;s new DLC, Vaas&#x27;s Insanity. Vaas&#x27; look and voice are from actor Michael Mando, who just happens to play Nacho Varga in Breaking Bad&#x27;s prequel series, Better Call Saul. Vaas is the villain from Far Cry 3, and this DLC gives you the chance to play as him and learn more about his backstory.
This DLC is the first part of a villain-focused season pass that retails for $40. The second and third acts give players control of Pagan Min from Far Cry 4 and Joeseph Seed from Far Cry 5.
The trailer above gives you a look at what you can expect from Vaas&#x27; return, which is supposedly designed like a roguelite.
Are you still playing Far Cry 6? Do you have any interest in the villain&#x27;s gameplay? Let us know in the comments section below!</span>

                    <span>Update: 11/16/21 8:44 p.m Central: Bobby Kotick responded to The Wall Street Journal&#x27;s report by recording a video message sent to Activision Blizzard employees. He addresses the article by saying it &quot;paints an inaccurate and misleading view of our company, of me personally, and my leadership.&quot; 
&quot;I want to say is that anyone who doubts my conviction to be the most welcoming, inclusive workplace doesn’t really appreciate how important this is to me,&quot; says Kotick in the message. &quot;Creativity and inspiration thrives best in a safe, welcoming, respectful environment. There is no substitute for that. And staying true to our values, without exceptions, is the best way to retain our talent and to attract the new talent we need to achieve our great potential.

                    <span>Collaborations are everywhere! Naruto in Fortnite. Ed Sheeran in Pokémon Go. Anime in World of Warships. The world is more fun when these things collide, isn&#x27;t it? They&#x27;re everywhere!  Today, the Transformers come to Hi-Rez moba Smite. Smite has had a notable amount of crossover material over the years, everything from The Legend of Korra to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Today, the roster of brands gets bigger as the Autobots roll out into the land of the gods. As with other collaborations, the new skins layer over existing gods, so don&#x27;t expect to actually get a tailored Optimus Prime moveset or anything, though you will look quite stylish.
The skins you can acquire consist of Optimis Prime for Geb, Megatron for Ra (!), and Starscream for Jing Wei. Of the three, you definitely want the Megatron one, right? Ra is a lot of fun anyway, so doing him up as Megatron is sure to be a blast. You can check out a lot more at the trailer right here!

                    <span>Remember Rime? Tequila Works is back, and they&#x27;re working on a game set in the League of Legends universe! The tale of a boy and a yeti is coming in 2022 with Song of Nunu: A League of Legends Story. Lovable moments and snowball fights are sure to happen in this title, which is scheduled to land on Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Playstation 5, Switch, and PC. You can learn a lot more about the game and even see it in action a bit in the trailer below!

In case you&#x27;re wondering who&#x27;s who, Nunu is the child, and he&#x27;s looking for his mom. Willump is the yeti and will help Nunu make his way through the frozen wastes and hopefully find his mom! Nunu also has a magic flute that can alter the environment in a number of ways. Or you can just make Willump dance, which is always nice. A mix of puzzling challenges and journeying through icy environs, the adventure is marked with story beats and relationship building as well, as Nunu and Willump form an unbreakable friendship. According to the developers, it&#x27;s a game about friendship, family, and joy. Hard to argue with that, really. We look forward to seeing just where this warm story in frigid lands takes us in 2022.

                    <span>Today, musical artist Ed Sheeran announced on Twitter that an upcoming collaboration is happening with Pokémon Go. In this day and age when Naruto is in Fortnite and celebrities are tied to all kinds of products via these projects, it&#x27;s actually not that surprising. 
Pokémon has had a deluge of crossovers and collaborative projects over its long lifetime, and seeing Ed Sheeran make the jump from Game of Thrones (and other media!) over to Pokémon is sure to be interesting. With Pokémon being one of the world&#x27;s most powerful entertainment brands, extending well outside of the gaming sphere into movies, merch, and much more, this partnership is hardly unusual. But how will it play out, exactly?

The exact nature of this collaboration is anyone&#x27;s guess, what do you think the artist has in store for the mobile Pokémon game? Are we going to spin magical Ed Sheeran Pokéstops or gyms? Who knows. Maybe we can click to get the new album while we play with our Bulbasaurs. What do you think the collaboration will look like? Perhaps Sheeran will actually become a canonical Pokémon. I mean, it&#x27;s not that far off in a world where we have Pokémon that are ya know, keychains. So, what do you think this is going to be? Let us know in the comments!</span>

Riot calls it a “fast-paced rhythm runner,” and that phrase was personified in Hextech Mayhem’s explosive (literally) launch trailer that premiered during today’s Riot Forge Showcase with Nintendo Switch. You can watch the gameplay footage below.

Piltover, Valoran’s cultural center with a gorgeous steampunk aesthetic, serves as the primary backdrop for Hextech Mayhem. You star as Ziggs, a zany yordle (a spirit that takes the form of a mammal) with a deep love and appreciation for big bombs.

Players explore the lands of Runeterra, specifically Bilgewater and the Shadow Isles, as a handful of League of Legends favorites. Miss Fortune, Illaoi, Braum, Yasuo, Ahri, and Pyke are all playable characters. Of course, the title of the game refers to what’s assumed to be a powerful force in the game as well, the League of Legends character Viego. You can get a look at what to expect in the trailer below!

Several additional price points exist beyond the standard edition of the game. The digital deluxe edition comes with Ruined skins for characters and bonus items, while the physical Collector’s Edition comes with an art book, sketch, soundtrack, cloth map, notebook/pen, and a mug. You’re going to need coffee for all that grinding, right?  
Ruined King: A League of Legends Story release date was delayed last December with no timeframe, but it looks like that time is now!

                    <span>Dragon Ball games tend to fall into one of two genres: fighting and, occasionally, RPGs. Dragon Ball: The Breakers bucks that trend as a new 7v1 asymmetrical online multiplayer game set within the mythos of Dragon Ball Xenoverse. 
Players control a group of seven ordinary civilians caught within a temporal seam. This pocket dimension is overseen by a powerful figure called the Raider, who hails from a different timeline. To escape imprisonment, the seven captives must traverse the sprawling map, locate Bulma’s Super Time Machine, and blast back to their plane of existence.

                    <span>Dying Light 2 has been one of my most anticipated games of the year for, well, three years now. It all started in 2019 when I saw a beyond-impressive gameplay demo at E3. The game, then scheduled for a 2020 release, blew away my already-high expectations. I enjoyed the original Dying Light, but felt that with a little bit of iteration and polish, the series could evolve into something truly special. Those hopes were delivered upon during that E3 2019 demo, and Dying Light 2 skyrocketed up my list of the most anticipated games of 2020.
Sadly, in the early stages of last year, Techland announced a delay to 2021. Then, after announcing a December 2021 release date, the developer delayed the game one (hopefully) final time, with the title now scheduled to release on February 4, 2022. It&#x27;s been…</span>

Few games have captured the imagination quite like Dying Light 2 Stay Human. Developer Techland&#x27;s ambitious open-world title has the potential to wow players with meaningful choices, a beautiful space to cause chaos, and satisfying zombie slaying. While Dying Light 2 has stayed in the shadows for the majority of the last few years, today, we&#x27;re giving you a new look into this undead nightmare.
That&#x27;s right, join Brian Shea and Alex Stadnik as they take you on a tour of Techland&#x27;s next title. The aforementioned Mr. Shea got to go to his first in-person press event in two years to get hands-on with both the PS4 Pro version of the game along with the beefed-up PC version.
During today&#x27;s fresh episode of New Gameplay Today, the gents show off Dying Light 2&#x27;s improved combat system and discuss how the game has improved since the original. They also dive into the famous parkour and detail how players will be able to use new gear like the paraglider to help them get around the expansive and terrifying open world. We also dive into a bit of the story, including what actor Rosario Dawson&#x27;s character will be doing, but nothing that would overtly spoil any major story beats. The duo unpacks a lot more, but you&#x27;re going to have to watch the latest NGT to learn more.
If you enjoyed our latest look at Dying Light 2 Stay Human, be sure to check out Brian Shea&#x27;s written impressions of his time with Techland&#x27;s latest title ahead of its February 4, 2022 release date!

                    <span>Halo Infinite’s free-to-play multiplayer beta hasn’t even been out for 24 hours and is already breaking records. According to Video Games Chronicle, 343’s popular FPS space opera amassed over 270,000 concurrent players on Steam, the first Xbox Studios game to reach such notable player-count heights in such a short period. 
This feat is even more impressive when considering the surprise announcement (sure, rumors might’ve been circulating over the weekend) during yesterday’s 20th Anniversary stream. While progression carrying over to the base game – acquired cosmetics, battle pass unlocks, and general experience points – and the Halo namesake are central selling points, it was hard to gauge where the player-count numbers would wind up. Yet (as seen below), other acclaimed Xbox Studios titles like Forza Horizon 5 and Halo: The Master Chief Collection, while very successful in their own right, have not seen the same immediate success on Steam. 
Halo Infinite is now the first ever Xbox Studios Game to pass 200k+ concurrent players on Steam and set the all-time record

Halo Infinite is in good company, having the fourth largest player peak on Monday under Steam heavyweights like Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Dota 2, and PUBG. Developer 343 Industries has a lot to be happy about. 
Totals on Xbox and the PC app haven’t been confirmed yet. Still, it’s safe to assume that the latest multiplayer installment in the Halo franchise is being enjoyed by a bevy of players on all available platforms. With news of the Season One battle pass extending until next May – an unorthodox amount of time, quite frankly – fans should have a ton of additional content rollouts to supplement the already-strong multiplayer and upcoming singleplayer component. 
Halo Infinite launches for Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC on December 8.

                    <span>Naruto Shippuden cosmetics are arriving in Fortnite right now, and they look awesome. Believe it! 
The new collaboration between Epic&#x27;s Fortnite and the latter half of the Naruto saga, Shippuden is bringing plenty of goodies from the Hidden Leaf Village. Not only is Naruto now playable in the battle royale, but he&#x27;s brought along the rest of Team 7: Sasuke Uchiha, Sakura Haruno, and their badass teacher Kakashi Hatake. Sakura and Naruto each come with alternate costumes based on their adult Boruto selves, while Kakashi fans can use his Anbu Black Ops outfit.
This great ninja takeover doesn&#x27;t stop at just skins. First, the battlebus will see a Naruto-themed makeover. New items are being added like a pickaxe modeled after Sasuke&#x27;s Sword of Kusanagi, and a new Paper Shuriken Bomb weapon. Mayb…</span>

In a dim, empty room, on a small table, lies a cube. Moncage dumps players right into the action with a few quick notes on how to manipulate this multi-faceted object. It tasks you with connecting similar objects found on the box’s different planes by spinning the cube and looking at things from unique perspectives. At first, the challenge seems simple. However, as the game progresses, puzzles grow more sophisticated, and the seemingly unconnected scenes reflected on the cube’s sides begin to weave into a narrative. I only wish that narrative had more substance.
Each side of Moncage’s six-sided cube displays a distinct vignett…</span>

&quot;It&#x27;s time to save Bilgewater, Captain.&quot; Honestly, with a name like Bilgewater, we feel like the town might be pre-destined to suffer — but in Ruined King: A League of Legends Story, a spin-off from the mightily popular MOBA League of Legends, that&#x27;s your task.
Announced as a surprise release on Switch today, Ruined King is a turn-based single-player RPG that was originally slated for early 2021.

                    <span>Other Switch games could be winners, too.
The Game Awards are coming, airing on 9th December to grace us with game trailers, adverts for PC gear and occasionally some game awards. Ok, we&#x27;ve been a tad snarky there, but it is a big annual event in the gaming calendar and the Switch has some notable nominees this time around.
The most exciting is Metroid Dread being up for Game of the Year, which is an awesome achievement. It&#x27;s up against some tough competition, and like every other category it&#x27;s fan-voted - you need to create a sign-in and vote on this official Game Awards page. Below are the nominees.

                    <span>The Game Awards, Geoff Keighley&#x27;s yearly excuse to invite friends round, has announced this year&#x27;s nominees. The contenders for the Game Of The Year award include Deathloop, It Takes Two, Psychonauts 2 and Resident Evil Village. Deathloop leads the nominations with nine.

                    <span>A report by the Wall Street Journal has brought to light several new examples of alleged misconduct by Activision staff, including rape and sexual harassment. The report also highlights several instances where Activision CEO Bobby Kotick was reportedly aware of the allegations but did not inform the company&#x27;s board of directors and, in one instance, intervened to prevent an alleged harasser from being fired.

In response to the report, employee group A Better ABK have called for Kotick to be replaced as CEO and are organising a staff walkout.

                    <span>Though Halo started out on Macs then joined Microsoft, historically the series hasn&#x27;t had much of a presence on personal computers. At first we got ports years after their Xbox debut, then Microsoft just stopped releasing Windows versions for their flagship first-person shooter series. Well, that&#x27;s changing with Halo Infinite, which is coming to PC at the same time as Xbox—including the Halo Infinite multiplayer beta launched last night. So I ask you, an audience with less exposure to the sci-fi shooter: how are you liking it, PC gamers?

                    <span>Today, Bandai Namco announced Dragon Ball: The Breakers, which is perhaps the most baffling game to be revealed this year. It&#x27;s a 7v1 survival horror game where a group of players have to escape a &quot;raider&quot; using all sorts of weird and wonderful abilities. It&#x27;s like Dead By Daylight meets Prop Hunt. Truthfully, when I first watched the trailer I was convinced they&#x27;d just put Cell in Dead By Daylight. Like, why not?

                    <span>I didn&#x27;t really have the luxury of devoting a cool 500 words to a single character in my Sherlock Holmes Chapter One review, firstly because I&#x27;m a believer in word economy, but secondly because what I wanted to talk about is a bit of a spoiler. It&#x27;s integral to the plot of the game and it&#x27;s revealed very quickly once you start playing, but it&#x27;s also not mentioned in any of the promo blurbs or marketing, so I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s meant to be a fun little &quot;Oh!&quot; moment. On the other hand, I do really want to talk about how cool Sherlock&#x27;s best mate Jon is...
So if you want to go into Frogwares&#x27; new detect &#x27;em up cold, then save this and come back to it after you&#x27;ve played about, ooh, 45 minutes? I think that&#x27;s long enough to get clear of spoiler territory.

                    <span>When Microsoft bought Bethesda last year, it raised questions about which consoles their future games would end up on. It&#x27;s not a huge drama for us in PC land, Microsoft already offer most of their new stuff to us and the Xbox lot. But for PlayStation owners, the drama has arrived. Phil Spencer says he sees The Elder Scrolls 6 as a PC and Xbox exclusive, the same as Starfield.

                    <span>Dying Light 2, like its predecessor, knows that its setting is as much of a sell as its gameplay. The development team at Techland has moved on from Dying Light’s setting of Harran in a nuclear-powered ‘salt the earth’ parting blow, and has shifted focus to Villedor. You play as a stranger, Aiden, travelling to this once-majestic capital to locate his missing sister, and the second you step foot into its guarded walls you’re faced with a city kitbashed together from pieces of Paris, Berlin, Hamburg, Ostrow and other European landmarks. In Villedor proper – a city that’s been designed by actual town planners and urban designers – you see the scope of what Techland is going for. This is a big game, with some big ideas. It’s not just more of the same Dying Light.

                    <span>Windows has contributed two iconic images to the public consciousness: the default Windows XP wallpaper; and the blue screen of death. But they cut Bliss decades ago, and Windows 11 put the final nail in the coffin of Windows&#x27; pop culture relevancy by turning the blue screen of death into a black screen of death. A tragedy. Thankfully, Microsoft have now seen the cerulean light, and are planning to restore the azure annihilator in a future patch.

And I don&#x27;t mean the whole removing it from sale fiasco, I mean the game itself is a mess. But fortunately, modders have stepped in, making improvements to the game&#x27;s rain, fixing typos, adding in lots of nice graphics options and more. One modder has even fixed the nut on the Tuff Nut Donuts sign, which, for some baffling reason, had been rounded out.

                    <span>Barry Hattrick has just signed a two-year contract with Stockport County FC. The 36-year-old former full-back, a Stockport native and lifelong fan of the Vanarama National League club, has a tactical style best described as &#x27;my dad after three pints&#x27;. Route-one, 4-4-2, and no &#x27;larking about&#x27;. He thinks a gegenpress is something you use to get the creases out of your trousers.
Hattrick is a quintessentially English anachronism, whose ignorance of the modern game represents my own unfamiliarity with modern Football Manager. It&#x27;s been quite some time since I last sported the greying temples and Fray-Bentos paunch of football&#x27;s favourite scapegoat, and returning to Football Manager is a bit like meeting up with an old girlfriend after they&#x27;ve had their consciousness uploaded into an all-knowing AI. I vaguely recognise the face behind all the ones and zeroes, but that person I once snuggled up with on winter evenings has ascended into something vast, intimidating, and utterly obsessed with data.

                    <span>Moncage is one of those puzzle games of intermittent lightbulb moments. One minute you see solutions with perfect clarity. The next you&#x27;re left scratching your head and wondering how the heck you&#x27;re meant to proceed. It wouldn&#x27;t be much of a puzzle game if there weren&#x27;t a few moments like this, of course, but when you&#x27;re playing out mechanical riddles across five possible surfaces - in this case, the sides and top of a rotatable cube - Moncage can sometimes veer into giving you a complete cerebral blackout, leaving you at an impasse until you consult its series of timed hints (or, if you&#x27;re really desperate, an in-game video solution). 
When the lightbulb pings into bright, brilliant existence, though, Moncage can be truly illuminating. As you rotate, prod and investigate its five little vignettes to line-up matching bits of scenery in one tile to affect the corresponding bit in another, Optillusion&#x27;s debut game harks back to the best bits from Fireproof Studios&#x27; The Room series. It&#x27;s a beautifully crafted little thing, and it builds on its ideas to create some genuinely standout moments of optical wizardry. If only the story it was trying to tell was half so elegant.

During the tech test of Halo Infinite that took place this summer, players took to the various maps to get their first taste of 343 Industries&#x27; upcoming free-to-play multiplayer. While many came away impressed by the ways Halo Infinite&#x27;s multiplayer feels true to the series&#x27; renowned roots, nearly as many players were blown away by how impressive the A.I. bots were in battle. 
When firing up the multiplayer starting today, players can reunite with the bots who likely headshotted them into oblivion through The Academy, a mode that serves as an on-ramp for players looking to enter the competitive fires. &quot;Multiplayer is…</span>

                    <span>With winter just on the horizon, this is the last entry in our Fall For Indies series. So, it seems only fitting to end with a glut of great titles to keep players sustained over for the long, dark months ahead. One of our most anticipated games this year, Solar Ash, was originally slated to arrive earlier in the season but is now hitting just ahead of the frostiest time of the year. And while the nights are getting darker sooner, there are still plenty of bright indie launches we’ve got our eye on for the rest of the year.
A Heaping Serving Of Fall Releases

                    <span>Xbox surprise announced today that the multiplayer portion of Halo Infinite, which we already knew to be free-to-play, is now live. They revealed this exciting news during today’s Xbox 20th Anniversary stream, where they also revealed even more details about the first season of Halo Infinite’s multiplayer called Heroes of Reach. 
If you’re excited to jump in and battle some fellow Spartans, now’s your chance, but first, you have to actually get into the beta. Here, we’ll break down exactly how to get in:

More specifically, Season 1: Heroes of Reach, which is a season based around the Spartans and characters from Halo: Reach, will last until May of 2022. That means Season 1 is half a year long, which should give players plenty of time to unlock all tiers of the battle pass. According to Xbox, doing so will yield you over 100 rewards.
Season 1: Heroes of Reach officially begins today. All of your Battle Pass progression, Spartan customization, and shop purchases will carry over from the beta to the full release of #HaloInfinite.

                    <span>The first teaser trailer for Microsoft and Xbox’s upcoming Halo TV series has been released and it features just a small snippet of what we can expect in the full show. 
Set to launch on Paramount+ next year, the show follows Master Chief, played by Pablo Schreiber, and Cortana, voiced by Jen Taylor. The teaser itself isn’t anything too wild – it features about what you’d expect from a Halo TV series teaser – but it’s still neat to see Master Chief’s iconic helmet in a live-action format such as this.

You can check it out above – as you can see, it’s short and sweet, featuring a brief glimpse at Schreiber’s Master Chief and the voice of Taylor’s Cortana. 
Elsewhere in the cast, we know that Natascha McElhone, of Californication fame, will be playing Dr. Halsey, the person responsible for turning John 117 into the Master Chief we all know and love today. Little else is known about the show, however, but we’ll learn more sometime next year when Halo hits Paramount+. 
While waiting for that, prepare for what’s next in the world of Halo by checking out Game Informer’s Halo Infinite game hub. There, you’ll find a 4K first look at the game’s opening level, an exclusive reveal of a weapon new to the Halo universe, our thoughts on Halo Infinite after going hands-on with it, and more.

                    <span>The immense benefits of the Xbox-Bethesda acquisition continue to trickle down as new IPs (Starfield) and upcoming chapters in revolutionary franchises (Elder Scrolls VI) are being developed for next-gen technology. At E3, we learned that the former will be an Xbox exclusive and Day One Game Pass addition. Information surrounding the next Elder Scrolls title, however, has been much harder to come across. Still, a GQ interview with Xbox’s leading man Phil Spencer unearthed some exciting new details about Bethesda’s flagship video game series. Nothing is confirmed yet, but Phil Spencer envisions Elder Scrolls VI as an Xbox exclusive. 
This exclusivity would be a groundbreaking decision for the games community and the western RPG scene if cleared. “Starfield, arguably the biggest game of 2022, will be Xbox and PC only,” the GQ article reads. “Spencer says he sees the same for The Elder Scrolls VI.” Spencer himself went on to say that having sole rights to both highly-anticipated Bethesda titles isn’t about “punishing any other platform.” Instead, “In order to be on Xbox, I want us to be able to bring the full complete package of what we have. And that would be true when I think about Elder Scrolls VI. That would be true when I think about any of our franchises.”
The Elder Scrolls VI might use the same overhauled engine as Starfield, but its release is still far off. Todd Howard confirmed that the game is still in its “design phase.” This, of course, is a little deflating, considering the first teaser was released three years ago. On the other hand, Starfield drops next year on November 11 for Xbox Series X/S and PC. 
Do you think the Elder Scrolls VI will be an exclusive or is that simply wishful thinking? Drop your theories in the comments section below!

                    <span>The famed bounty hunter Boba Fett is coming to Fortnite in just a little over a month. 
This news comes by way of the official Fortnite Twitter account, which announced the news as part of Disney Plus Day last week. Perhaps an early Christmas present for those that celebrate the holiday, Boba Fett will be added to Fortnite (presumably as a purchasable skin in the Item Shop) on December 24. 
It’s excellent timing, too, because Disney’s upcoming Disney Plus show about the bounty hunter, The Book of Boba Fett, launches five days later on December 29. 
Boba Fett will be making his arrival on the Island December 24, 2021 at 7pm ET! #DisneyPlusDay pic.twitter.com/cj9iC6WRBZ
November 12, 2021
As you can see in the Tweet above, Boba Fett is pictured on a throne with Fennec Shand, who is played by Ming-Na Wen in The Mandalorian, right beside him. It’s unclear if Fennec Shand will be joining the Fortnite roster, and while it would be cool, the actual words that accompany the image in the tweet suggest that just Boba Fett is joining the game. 
Only time will tell for now – you only have to wait about six more weeks to find out. While waiting for that, check out the first trailer from The Book of Boba Fett and then read about how Dark Phoenix from X-Men is being added to Fortnite. Read about how something from Naruto Shippuden is coming to Fortnite soon after that. Then, check out Game Informer’s list of all the Marvel and DC superheroes and supervillains in Fortnite.

                    <span>Update, 11/15/21:
Over 6 million people played Forza Horizon 5 in its launch week, according to Xbox marketing head and general manager Aaaron Greenberg. 
Greenberg revealed this massive launch week number for Playground Studios&#x27; latest open-world driving game on Twitter and he said the numbers are still growing. This news comes after Xbox head Phil Spencer revealed last week that Horizon 5 had the biggest launch of any Xbox Game Studios game ever, hitting over 4.5 million players on launch day. 
You all are amazing, not only did we set the record for biggest Xbox Game Studios’ launch ever, but now over 6 million players and growing, still in our launch week! 🤯💚 #ForzaHorizon5 https://t.co/kiTB3eGknp

                    <span>Update, 11/15/21: 
Rockstar’s new remastered trilogy of Grand Theft Auto III, San Andreas, and Vice City, collectively known as Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition, is playable once more on PC. It’s also available for purchase again. 
This comes after the PC version of the trilogy was unplayable and not available for purchase beginning November 12 as Rockstar’s launcher, which must be used to play the trilogy on PC, went offline. The launcher (and subsequent ability to play the game and purchase it on PC) was brought back online yesterday. 
Rockstar announced this by way of a tweet yesterday and, in the same tweet, the company says it sincerely apologizes for the inconvenience and that it is “working to improve and update overall performance as we move forward.”

                    <span>The simple explanation of Sherlock Holmes Chapter One is a game where you embody the nascent consulting detective, aged 21, returning to Cordona, the Mediterranean island where he spent time as a child. It&#x27;s a third-person puzzle adventure. You gather the evidence, cross reference it all, and then come to a conclusion on the case. Young Holmes returned to Cordona to find out how his mum died a decade ago, and is helped by his best mate Jon, this season&#x27;s Creepy Watson. Boy, do they get in some scrapes along the way! Bingo, bango, there&#x27;s yer preamble.
But the complex explanation is that this game, ironically, defies explanation. As I played, I oscillated wildly between thinking, &quot;This is Frogwares&#x27; world and we&#x27;re all just living in it!&quot; and, &quot;What is even happening, what is this, I need a ten-part documentary series that just follows the developers around because they really have a lot of explaining to do.&quot;

                    <span>Morse, the strategy game that teaches you real morse code to win a war, has come a long way since we first wrote about it in 2015. What started out as a free flash game (and a makeshift telegraph key made out of a clothes peg) now has proper 3D graphics and quite possibly the most impressive custom controller setup I&#x27;ve ever seen. When I played the demo at EGX 2021 last month, not only had creator AlexVSCoding made an entire telegraph machine for the occasion, but he&#x27;d also managed to source a pair of headphones from the 1930s to really hammer home the idea of being a wartime telegraph operator. 
Obviously, you don&#x27;t need a pair of 90-year-old headphones to enjoy playing Morse. A modern headset will do just as well. You also don&#x27;t technically need the telegraph machine either, as there&#x27;s an onscreen button interface you can click with your mouse. But let me tell you, pressing those morse code buttons in-game wasn&#x27;t half as immersive as tapping out the commands on a proper dedicated machine, and I wish there was some way Morse could give everyone that experience when it finally launches in full.

It&#x27;s your typical kinda horror experience - a singleplayer romp making you solve puzzles and linger in horrible places while trying to avoid spooks. You might expect that a second Sker-y game would follow a similar formula. Nope. This weekend, the developers announced Sker Ritual, a co-op shooter in which you&#x27;ll need to survive an onslaught of ghouls.

                    <span>Wartales, the next game from Northgard developers Shiro Games, is coming to early access on December 1st. It&#x27;s an open-world RPG set in a plague-ravaged medieval world, where you&#x27;ll lead a pack of mercenaries as you all try to survive. I played the demo this summer, and it&#x27;s good! It&#x27;s a simple ye olde setting, no magic or wizards, but also has no main quests to bog you down. You&#x27;re free to follow little story threads as you please, or just exist in the harsh world with your merc pals.

                    <span>&quot;Sometimes a bit of difficulty can add a lot of replayability, but as of right now there are issues and bugs we&#x27;ve encountered in development that are making it far more difficult than intended,&quot; Back 4 Blood developers Turtle Rock Studios have said. The Left 4 Dead-style monster-mashing has become notably more difficult following the big November update, with undesireable consequences, and they laid out plans to remedy it.

                    <span>Did you know that Black Friday isn’t, as any reasonable person would assume, a celebration of West Midlands coal mining country? It’s actually a big annual sales event that Americans love so much they spend a whole day giving thanks for it. They have shiny buckle hats and go on pilgrimages to the shops. With so many deals flying about on both sides of the Atlantic, some guidance is called for, so I’m here to be your canary in the coalmine of bargains and help you avoid any turkeys.

                    <span>Server transfers were introduced to New World last month, letting players boot their characters to a new world. It was implemented as a way to ease queue times in the popular MMORPG, but didn&#x27;t work completely to plan - it caused a gold duping glitch, and some players have been blocked from transferring altogether. Amazon Games say they&#x27;re currently working on resolving these blockages, and are planning a second round of server transfers before the year&#x27;s end, so everyone has a chance to jump worlds.

                    <span>After pulling Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition&#x27;s PC edition from sale soon after its Thursday launch, Rockstar returned it to their store overnight. The remastered collection of GTA 3, Vice City, and San Andreas looks a right mess but apparently the reason for its vanishing was they had accidentally left in files they shouldn&#x27;t have, which include songs that weren&#x27;t meant to be in the game. Well, it&#x27;s back on sale now, and it still looks a mess. Hey Rockstar, maybe now consider putting the original versions back on sale too.

                    <span>Linux 5.16-rc1 is coming out later today and already I&#x27;m seeing some fallout in the new kernel&#x27;s performance... In particular, bad news for Alder Lake that is already seeing the Linux performance trailing Windows 11 seemingly due to the lack of Thread Director integration right now in the kernel and any other missing optimizations around Intel&#x27;s hybrid architecture. A new feature of Linux 5.16 is unfortunately having unintended regressions for Alder Lake with at least the flagship Core i9 12900K. Here are the results from the latest kernel bisecting that uncovered this latest upstream slowdown.</span>

                    <span>The first season of Game Informer’s Video Gameography explores the history of the Metroid series. After running down Samus&#x27; 2D outings, we’re ready to venture into the world of 3D with Metroid Prime.
Released on November 17, 2002 for Nintendo&#x27;s Gamecube, Metroid Prime is often considered one of the best games of its era. However, to better understand Metroid Prime&#x27;s influence we first have to go back to the tumultuous founding of Retro Studios. In order to develop Metroid Prime, Retro canceled four other projects, and even then many of its designers almost didn&#x27;t survive development. In the end, Retro created a total masterpiece that feels ahead of its time. Join us as we talk about Retro&#x27;s struggles, why Shigeru Miyamoto felt that the morph ball was essential to the formula, and how we almost saw Kraid in 3D. 
Join hosts Ben Reeves (@BenjaminReeves), Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), and special guest, Game Informer&#x27;s own Blake Hester (@metallicaisrad) for the next hour as we explore Metroid Prime&#x27;s lore, development history, and lasting impact.

Now, the launcher is back, but the Definitive Edition remains unavaiable to buy or play while Rockstar &quot;remove files unintentionally included in these versions.&quot;

                    <span>I think I&#x27;ve figured out a way to improve efficiency of heating and cooling my flat across the year by making my choices of games seasonal. In summer, I should be playing vintage games, games which a modern PC can run without even noticing, my silicon frigid. As autumn sets in, I should be playing progressively more demanding games, games that stress my CPU and GPU, pump out more heat. Then in the depths of winter, I&#x27;ll break out the ugliest ReShade presets and &quot;HD&quot; texture packs I can find, light this tower on fire. But anyway, what are you playing this weekend?

                    <span>The writer behind some of the stories and dialogue featured in Assassin’s Creed games like Revelations, Black Flag, and even last year’s Valhalla, Darby McDevitt, has returned to Ubisoft. 
This news comes by way of Video Games Chronicle, which reports that McDevitt is back at the company just seven months after leaving it. In that time, he began working for developer Illogika Games. When he left Ubisoft back in March, McDevitt said he wanted to take on “a new adventure” and it seems he either finished up that adventure or decided he preferred ones where hidden blades are involved.

“Yes, I have returned to Ubisoft,” McDevitt told VGC. “As I pondered my career over the past year, I focused on my desire to explore new ideas and unknown frontiers. Much to …</span>

                    <span>Disney finally pulled the curtain back a bit on its upcoming Disney Plus series, Obi-Wan Kenobi, with a new behind-the-scenes sneak peek, and it teases another duel between the titular character and his old apprentice, Anakin Skywalker. 
Of course, since this series follows the events of Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith, we know that old apprentice is Anakin Skywalker no more. He’s Darth Vader now. As far as we know, Obi-Wan hasn’t yet seen Anakin as Vader in between the end of Revenge of the Sith and the start of this series so it seems we’ll get to see them meet for the first time on-screen. 
We’ll also get to see Obi-Wan actor, Ewan McGregor, share the screen with Anakin actor, Hayden Christensen, for the first time in years during this series. Neither of these actors has ma…</span>

                    <span>Disney+ Day happens but once a year, not just to celebrate the anniversary of the streaming service, but to show what viewers can look forward to in the coming months and years. Today&#x27;s announcements had plenty for Marvel fans to look forward to including new shows, continuations of recent favorites, and revivals of long-dormant series.
While there wasn&#x27;t any actual footage shown of any of the following shows, there&#x27;s a lot to be excited for. Shows like Moon Knight, Ms. Marvel, and She-Hulk are still on track to hit the service. All three have teasers shown here (at the 11:50 mark) if you&#x27;re a Disney+ subscriber. 
Making a surprise reappearance is X-Men &#x27;97, a continuation of the 90&#x27;s Saturday morning cartoon which is slated for release sometime in 2023. I Am Groot is another animated seri…</span>

                    <span>In honor of the first anniversary of the launch of PlayStation 5, Sony Interactive Entertainment CEO Jim Ryan took to the PlayStation Blog to take a look back at the year that was as well as what&#x27;s to come.
Even for a year where it felt like PS5 consoles were hard to find (and still are!), gamers put in plenty of time on the now-current gen device. &quot;PS5 gamers have collectively played more than 4.6 billion hours of gameplay on PS5 and broadcast more than 26 million hours of content,&quot; Ryan boasted. No doubt there&#x27;s been an impressive amount DualSense controller recharges as well. Along with these impressive stats, Ryan listed off the top ten most played games on PS5 over the past year. Some are less surprising, but a few launch titles managed to stick on the list despite some more popular games. 
Fortnite
Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War
FIFA 21
NBA 2K21
Assassin’s Creed Valhalla
Destiny 2
MLB The Show 21
Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales
Demon’s Souls
NBA 2K22
It&#x27;s great to see Miles Morales and Demon&#x27;s Souls hanging with the heaviest time-sinks like Fortnite and Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, especially since they&#x27;re day one releases with (mostly) single-player campaigns. 
Jim Ryan also takes a moment to highlight other big Sony exclusive games like Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart, Returnal, and Deathloop, as well as recent studio acquisitions of Bluepoint Games, Firesprite, Housemarque, and Nixxes. He lays out a glimpse at the future, with megaton releases coming next year and beyond in God of War Ragnarok, Horizon: Forbidden West, and Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Remake. In total, 25 games from Playstation Studios are currently in development for PlayStation 5.
Despite the availability woes facing PlayStation 5, it&#x27;s had quite the first year with plenty of current and upcoming reasons to make the upgrade. That is if you&#x27;re lucky enough to find one in the coming months. 
What&#x27;s your most played games on PS5 this year? Let us know in the comments below!</span>

                    <span>Now That Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition is out in the wild, fans and newcomers are enjoying improved versions of GTA III, Vice City, and San Andreas. While the games are a blast on their own merits, many fans remember punching in the copious amounts of cheat codes to make each title even more delightfully absurd. Most of these cheats apply to the Definitive Editions and we&#x27;ve gathered all of them here in one place. 
To activate the cheats, simply enter the correct button prompts while in-game. Keep in mind that Rockstar has already warned that an unspecified &quot;couple of cheats&quot; have been removed from The Definitive Editions due to technical reasons. If a code doesn&#x27;t work, that&#x27;s likely the reason. Also, using cheats will lock certain trophies/achievements so be sure…</span>

                    <span>There are movie franchises that will likely never take a break – Halloween, the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and despite what Vin Diesel says, probably Fast &amp; Furious, to name a few – and it seems Predator is one of them. 
That’s because a new Predator movie is due out next year, as reported by IndieWire on Twitter. Titled Prey, it’s being directed by 10 Cloverfield Lane director, Dan Trachtenberg, and it will stream on Hulu sometime in 2022. It’s unclear based on IndieWire’s wording if the movie is streaming exclusively on Hulu or if it will simply stream on the service and hit theaters next year. 
The new #Predator movie from &quot;10 Cloverfield Lane&quot; director Dan Trachtenberg is officially titled #Prey and will stream on Hulu in 2022. The film is set 300 years ago and follows a skilled Comanc…</span>

                    <span>Elden Ring is on my mind. When I go to bed and I close my eyes, I see giant crabs clack about. When I see a horse in a field, I think of Torrent the spectral steed. I consider laughing at the end of all my sentences. So yeah, to say my time with the closed network test was infectious is an understatement. But there’s just one detail rattling around my brain I simply can’t shake.
And it’s to do with where I stood in the game’s world. How strong was I? At what point do I take on the big dragon? Should I be here, or over there now? Souls games haven’t traditionally been good at letting you know these things, but Elden Ring felt more confusing. Time to investigate.

                    <span>Listen, folks, I&#x27;m going to hold up my hands and tell you something shocking. I don&#x27;t get Dark Souls. I&#x27;ve tried to play FromSoftware&#x27;s much lauded masterpieces several times over the years, but I&#x27;m simply not good enough at them to find them enjoyable. No matter how much you try and tell me about the sweet satisfaction you feel after finally beating a boss on the 57th attempt, I&#x27;ve come to realise I simply don&#x27;t have the time or the patience to see it through. I&#x27;m not sure I ever will, either. 
It&#x27;s the same reason I tend to veer away from a lot of other Soulslike games as well. I never really got on with Dead Cells, for instance, and don&#x27;t even get me started on Sekiro. But cor, I do also love it when a game proves me wrong. Hollow Knight was the first Soulslike to rekindle my rather begrudging relationship with these games, and now I&#x27;ve fallen hook, line and sinker for Death&#x27;s Door, the crow reaper sword &#x27;em up from Titan Souls creators Acid Nerve.

Both big FPS releases of the month, Call Of Duty: Vanguard and Battlefield 2042, have been at my fingertips this week and I&#x27;ve got some thoughts. Of course, Imogen hits us with news too.

                    <span>Rockstar yesterday launched the Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition, a collection of GTA 3, Vice City, and San Andreas rebuilt and remastered. Today, you cannot buy it at all on PC. Given that the Internet has been abuzz with screenshots of by how bad parts of the new versions look, it might be tempting to assume Rockstar pulled it from sale for being rubbo. However, they do seem to be having trouble with the launcher software which the game requires. Hmm! Either way, the game is a mess.

Folks who buy the Gold or Ultimate editions, or subscribe to EA Play Pro, can now hop on and start popping faces in Dice&#x27;s new FPS. Everyone else, hey, be glad that other people are paying to test the game for you so it&#x27;s in better shape later. Though reportedly voice chat won&#x27;t even be in by the time it properly launch so sheesh.

                    <span>Jurassic World Evolution 2 is, just like its predecessor, a very capable adaptation of cinema’s most beloved dinosaur franchise. From its music, to the quotations scattered on its loading screens, to the great steaming swamp of Jeff Goldblum voice acting, it’s a solid case study in how a studio can get its money’s worth from an expensive license. And at its heart, of course, is a stable of spectacular dinosaurs.
Using lessons learned from Planet Zoo’s development, which has more or less filled the time since 2016’s Jurassic World Evolution, Frontier have come back with the most beautiful, the most real dinosaurs ever to trudge and honk their way across a monitor. It’s proper John Hammond, spared-no-expense, sunglasses-off-and-gawp stuff. Which makes it all the more painfully frustrating to realise that they’re trapped, once again, in a seriously wonky management game.

That&#x27;s where new iteration Pokémon TCG Live comes in, although you&#x27;ll have to wait a while longer for it than intended, as it was announced today that its open beta has been delayed until 2022.

Unfortunately, they have also cut some of my favourite songs from the radio, boooo.

We know a little about Bethesda&#x27;s upcoming space RPG already, and last night director Todd Howard revealed a few more titbits about what&#x27;s in store. During a Q&amp;A on Reddit, he talked about the game&#x27;s character creator, mod support and potential robot companions, as well as mentioned that the developers plan on showing more Starfield next summer.

                    <span>I&#x27;m once again back, and I&#x27;m badder than ever! To mark my triumphant return to the Electronic Wireless Show podcast, I (Alice) suggested we talk about our favourite non-game celebrity appearances in games. Not because I&#x27;m very famous and important, although I am, but because I wanted to spend some time making fun of Chris Pratt.
In the end, though, we don&#x27;t talk much about Chris Pratt, partly because we are so very excited to be joined on the pod by &#x27;Bath&#x27;s Nic Cage&#x27;, and discuss the time he turned on Bath&#x27;s Christmas lights, and partly because we do talk about a lot of games this week. I hope you&#x27;re all proud of us. We&#x27;re showing personal growth. Digressions this week include Harrods department store, a lot about Garfield, and Nate doing fat rips on his vape.

                    <span>If Bright Memory: Infinite has one thing, it’s bombast. It’s a game where at one point you jump and electro-grapple onto an in-flight plane as it careens into a black hole, but it’s also a game where you can easily miss the poorly telegraphed jump three times in a row and wind up having to slog through the same brief firefight again and again. 
This is a short, linear shooter about riddling high-tech corporate goons and ancient mythical chinese warriors with bullets and blade wounds - a shooter that’s left me both razzled and dazzled, but not without reservation.

                    <span>The team behind much-beloved XCOM mod Long War today announced they&#x27;ve delayed the launch of their own alien invasion strategy game, Terra Invicta. It&#x27;s now due in spring 2022. Pavonis Interactive state the usual reason: they want more time to make it good. Please do! After Long War, I certainly want to see them smash it with an ambitious game spanning the entire solar system. For now, a new trailer shows some of their recent work, including 3D space fleet battles and giant alien beasties destroying cities.

                    <span>Ahead of Skyrim Anniversary Edition&#x27;s launch, a developer behind a vital modding tool warned that the release might also break mods for Skyrim Special Edition, badly. Well, Skyrim Anniversary Edition is out now, and as expected it has broken many mods. But, good news: the person who warned of this is making better progress on fixes than expected.

                    <span>One of my favourite things about the Fallout series is learning what weird and wonderful experiments took place in its vaults. There was the one where everyone lived in a VR simulation, another testing cryosleep, as well as one where a panther was let loose. The developers had more plans for these bomb-proof bunkers that never quite made it into the games though. Bethesda director Todd Howard revealed last night that Fallout 4 almost had an underwater vault with a giant octopus, which sounds slightly terrifying.

                    <span>This Battlefield 2042 review-in-progress is an odd one. Namely because my hands-on time with the game has been dictated by EA, as opposed to actual real-life sit-downs with my own copy of the game. Still, I&#x27;ve largely enjoyed what I’ve played so far and am confident that Battlefield fans will too.

                    <span>The key to a good mystery, in my opinion, is narrative constraint. When the rules of a mystery - what the investigator can and cannot do, who and what was where and when - are laid out clearly for the audience, working within those limitations to puzzle out the case (a la any book by Agatha Christie, the who-dun-it queen) becomes irresistible.


Conway: Disappearance At Dahlia View knows exactly what its story, and its protagonist specifically, can and cannot do. Robert Conway can use his decades of experience as a private investigator to look for missing child Charlotte May Morgan, but what he cannot do is leave Dahlia View or get caught by the police. From his wheelchair, Conway surveys his neighbours from the window of his second-floor flat, occasionally venturing down into the quiet courtyard below to infiltrate his neighbour’s homes. Though due to the declines of age or sheer arrogance, he does neither half so subtly as he’d like to think.


Within these parameters, Conway presents a classic locked room mystery, only the “room” is the neighbourhood of Dahlia View and, unbeknownst to Conway but made known to the audience, this has all happened before.

                    <span>It&#x27;s Skyrim&#x27;s 10th birthday today, so Bethesda have released yet another version of their epic fantasy RPG to celebrate. Skyrim: Anniversary Edition is out now, adding a bunch of Creation Club content, like fishing, aquariums and more. Plus, owners of the game&#x27;s Special Edition will get a handful of freebies too. It&#x27;s no Elder Scrolls 6, but hey, fish are nice. So, how many copies of Skyrim will you own after today?

                    <span>If you tell me your weird take on a free idle game is about 40 minutes long, I&#x27;m going to pay attention. I may not have places to go or people to see, but I do have a lot of stuff to do (like the mandatory watching of videos about correct neutral chair posture at work). Then your browser game turns out to be a strange, sort of post-apocalypse thing about music, dancing and weird rural traditions - and harvesting a lot of corn - and I will be crouched on my chair, slavering like a little cider-swilling urchin, for the entirity of those 40 minutes.
Such a creature am I for Peter Talisman: Lord Of The Harvest, a game that fills your screen with a huge field of gently swaying corn.

Nesmírně nás to mrzí, a i když jsme dělali vše pro to, aby se nás nedotkly problémy světového logistického řetězce, z důvodu nedostatku materiálu nám komponenty do výrobních středisek nepřichází včas, což v důsledku znamená, že nestíháme plánovaný termín vydání, píše společnost Valve v oficiálním oznámení.</span>

This same screwtop fuckboi can now be your wingman in Curved Space, a twin-stick shmup of no particular note. &quot;It is the first time a fragrance has featured in a game as a playable character&quot; is a line from the press release. I love it, I hate it.

                    <span>The Gunk is a third-person action adventure from the makers of SteamWorld, set on a planet covered in a gelatinous goo. You hoover it up. It was announced last year, and we now know it&#x27;ll launch on PC via Xbox Game Pass on December 16th.

                    <span>Delightful, genre-hopping series SteamWorld will return in SteamWorld Headhunter. It&#x27;s another first for the series, in that it&#x27;s 3D, and it&#x27;s a third-person co-op action adventure. There&#x27;s a first teaser trailer below.

                    <span>Valve have delayed the Steam Deck, their handheld PC, until February 2022. Originally due to start shipping at the end of this year, Valve put out the announcement today that pinned the slip on &quot;global supply chain issues&quot;.

                    <span>To hell with raytracing. Nuts to your HDR. And VR, more like Very Rubbish. No, the only future graphics technology which matters is pretty water. One of the few games to understand this is Sea Of Thieves, home to some of the prettiest virtuawater you ever did see, while so many others neglect their duty to show me pretty fake water. So today I&#x27;m delighted to see that the next big World Of Warships update brings a graphics overhaul including pretty new water. It is pretty! Not Sea Of Thieves-grade pretty, but certainly a better use of resources than goggles.

In fact, we first started compiling this list about a year ago, although for reasons that will forever remain a mystery, it&#x27;s taken us until now to actually wrangle it into shape. At long last, here we are.

                    <span>Hello folks. I know it seems like I only wrote one of these Letters From The Editor five minutes ago, but that five minutes ago was also about three weeks later than it should have been last month, hence the slight double whammy of RPS Treehouse business you’re getting now. But it’s a good thing, really, as my accidental tardiness last month means I can now address some of the issues you raised in our recent RPS reader survey much faster. We’re still digging through a lot of the results right now, but I thought I’d take this opportunity to talk about some of the more general concerns and proposals you mentioned as part of your overall feedback, and how we’re going to be incorporating some of them into our editorial plans going forward.

                    <span>Compared to many of the tabletop social deduction games which inspired it, Among Us is fairly straightforward. Goodies, baddies, and that&#x27;s it. Well, last night it took a step towards its roots with the addition of four new roles which can change how you play your character—and how you need to think about other people&#x27;s characters. Say hullo to the Scientist, the Engineer, the Guardian Angel, and the Shapeshifter.

                    <span>There’s this hip-hop track I’m a fan of called Money Dance by Rick Ross. It doesn&#x27;t have much to do with From Software’s upcoming action-RPG Elden Ring, but there&#x27;s one simple lyric in it that perfectly sums up my early hands-on time with the game’s upcoming closed network test: “Caution, I’ll approach you with a business mind / Slight two step as I check the time”.
For three days last week, I practically waltzed over to my friend&#x27;s PS5 (that I, err, &#x27;borrowed&#x27;, as sadly Elden Ring&#x27;s closed network test isn&#x27;t available on PC this time around). If you applied for the CNT and got selected, you&#x27;ll be able to experience everything I&#x27;m about to tell you for yourself starting this Friday, November 12th, until Monday November 15th. But even though my hands-on with Elden Ring was brief, I’m confident that this is Souls taking a step in the right direction. It’s at once new and familiar, but forever exciting. I want to go back.

You have until Friday to claim your copies of the spin-offs, which converted AssCreed&#x27;s sneak-o-murdering into 2.5D side-scrolling platformers. They told stories of three different assassins in China, India, and Russia across several hundred years, with art styles inspired by their setting. And right now they&#x27;re free.

They plan to bring Weta&#x27;s tools to Unity developers, which is quite an arsenal to offer in the rendering arms race against Unreal Engine.

                    <span>Back in 2016 I spoke to game dev and critic Mattie Brice about making DIY video games for the young audience at Rookie Mag. Brice said, “I just wanna demystify to a lot of people that you don’t need this intense process to make video games.” While tools like Unity and Game Maker 2 have become more user-friendly over the years, the game making tool with the lowest barrier to entry might just remain Twine - the HTML-based text-centric dev tool that is often likened to a way to make electronic choose-your-own-adventure stories. The freedom presented with Twine has afforded many creators, especially queer game devs, the opportunity to make stunning, often shocking work - with Benji Bright among them.

                    <span>Give players a grind to unlock goodies and earn money and, rather than play the game the way the developers might intend, they&#x27;ll likely figure out the laziest and most efficient way to accomplish that. In Forza Horizon 5, this involves buying janky Jeeps. So many Jeeps. Players have figured out that an endless stream of Willys Jeeps give them a cheap way to get big spins on the prizewheel, potentially winning big money and unlocking rare cars. The game is awash with Jeeps.

                    <span>Tiny Tina&#x27;s Assault On Dragon Keep was originally a Borderlands 2 DLC, but now it&#x27;s available as a standalone release called Tiny Tina&#x27;s Assault on Dragon Keep: A Wonderlands One-shot Adventure. It functions as a taster of what&#x27;s to come in its successor, Tiny Tina&#x27;s Wonderlands, due next year.

While Dragon Keep will cost monies on Steam, it&#x27;s available for free on the Epic Games Store for a week.

                    <span>Continuing a barrage of putting League Of Legends absolutely everywhere, Riot Games today announced another game set in their MOBA&#x27;s world. Launching next week, HexTech Mayhem: A League Of Legends Story is a rhythm runner made by Choice Provisions, the studio behind the Bit.Trip games. It looks a lot like Bit.Trip, with a wee wizard running and jumping and bombing in time to the beat. As well as a spread of PC stores, it&#x27;ll be available inside the Netflix app. Innnteresting.

                    <span>It has been a long damn year, so I&#x27;d forgotten that people were making a grim Soulslike video game based on Pinocchio. Oh, but they are! And you can see that in the first gameplay trailer for Lies Of P. Some big Bloodborne vibes mixed with a bit of Sekiro, within an edgy murderworld based on the old story. As if anything could be scarier than the bit in the Disney version where the kids get turned into donkeys. But come, watch the trailer.

                    <span>It is a truth universally acknowledged (like the status of single men in possession of large fortunes viz. wanting wives) that moving house is one of the worst things to undertake in adult life. And you have to undertake it several times! The packing, the unpacking, the stuffing of old newspaper in gaps between fragile plates: it&#x27;s all hell. And comes with the creeping realisation that your life has as much meaning as can be physically stuffed into a few cardboard boxes.
An extra special high-five, then, to Unpacking, which not only makes this stressful event a delightful puzzle, but also demonstrates that your life and things actually have incredible meaning.

                    <span>A Fortnite emote featuring music by Travis Scott has seemingly been removed from sale, following a tragedy at the rapper&#x27;s Astroworld festival on Saturday that killed eight people. The emote appeared in the item store&#x27;s daily selection on Sunday, then soon after Epic outright disabled that section. While they haven&#x27;t explained why, the cause seems clear.

The vast bulk of it, though, is basically Good Vibes: The Game. It&#x27;s warm, welcoming, and very silly, and is never intruded upon unexpectedly with the rest. But that tiny part is what makes the rest so important.

But I&#x27;m delighted to learn that a group of Fallout 76 roleplayers have formed a troupe of actors performing plays inside Bethesda&#x27;s post-apocalyptic MMO, and recently staged Macbeth inside their own version of the Globe theatre.

                    <span>If you’ve played a Call Of Duty campaign in the last decade, Call Of Duty: Vanguard doesn’t bring anything new to the ride. This is a familiar World War 2 funfair, where you’re steered through artillery strikes and down swathes of enemies like its whack-a-mole. By the time you get off, it’s all blurred into one forgettable experience. How could you emerge shellshocked, when you’ve seen it all before?

They&#x27;ved also detailed a number of accessibility options the game has from launch today, including screen reading, game speed modification and more.

                    <span>You could argue Playground Games have just made essentially the same game at least three times in a row with Forza Horizon now, but while every previous edition had a few things you could point at to show how it was imperfect, you can’t do that here. Forza Horizon 5 is as close to flawless as any racer has ever come. For this level of quality to successfully cover such a massive and ambitious game world is a monumental achievement and should be celebrated with some kind of festival. A festival of driv… OK, yes, you should celebrate by playing it. That’ll do just fine.

There is a twist, at least: the battle pass is 100% free, and there&#x27;s a new robot-battling mode included in the update, too.

Version 1.1.46, released this Saturday, makes several changes which should reduce multiplayer latency.

Thankfully, Left 4 Dead creators Turtle Rock have detailed more of the post-launch plans for their new zombie-smashing shooter, laying out the content roadmap for the next few months and into next year. Before paid expansions start rolling in 2022, this year we should expect to see new free stuff including a solo offline mode with progression, a new card type, new cards, and more.

Over the last week or so, the developers have been celebrating the arrival of the show in other games too, with Jinx-themed Valorant skins and even a crossover with Fortnite. The festivities are carrying on this week in League Of Legends and Legends Of Runeterra as well, with new &quot;interactive experiences&quot;, game modes and more.

                    <span>Well, here’s a bit of a bum note in the otherwise upbeat tune of Intel’s 12th Gen Alder Lake CPUs: the new chips are apparently tripping up games that use Denuvo DRM. Not all of them, fortunately, but Intel has listed over 50 games that might suffer compatibility issues across Windows 10 and Windows 11 when using an Alder Lake processor. These include big names like Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order and Total War: Three Kingdoms. (Update - Fallen Order has now removed Denuvo completely, so should be fine.)
