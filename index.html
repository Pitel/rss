                              <span>It features the recently-revealed ending theme
The Sonic Frontiers Super Sonic trailer is here, thanks to a new clip Sega is sharing to celebrate the week of TGS (Tokyo Game Show).
It&#x27;s a shortish little clip, giving us a little more background on the Starfall Islands, the locales therein, and some gameplay. At the end, we get a front-and-center look at the emeralds and the iconic Super Sonic power. &quot;Harnessing the power of the emeralds&quot; is a big part of the storyline this time around. As Sega puts it, &quot;The Starfall Islands are home to strange and menacing foes that Sonic has never encountered before. Using an all-new battle system, join Sonic in confronting these titanic threats with upgraded combat skills, evasive maneuvers, and a few familiar tricks up his sleeve. Jump into adventure, harness the power of the Emeralds, and fight to stop these new, mysterious enemies!&quot;
As you might have surmised, the trailer showcases the ending theme for the game once again: &quot;Vandalize&quot; from ONE OK ROCK. So far it seems to be getting more praise than the main theme, &quot;I&#x27;m Here,&quot; from Merry Kirk-Holmes of To Octavia. If I had to compare the two, I would be OK (ha) with cementing Vandalize as the main theme.
So far, Sonic Frontiers is ticking more boxes the more time goes on. Now I don&#x27;t want to sink into the Sonic Cycle and instill too much hope! But the Cyber Space level showing really hit home for me, and there was only one way they could have gone since the shaky initial showing of the game: up.

Some very pleasant news today for fans of the delightful indie hit TOEM: A Photo Adventure as developer Something We Made has announced that it is currently working on a DLC update for the snap-happy adventure, which will launch on all platforms, free of charge, at an unspecified date.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;O7N8mO84A6s
Speaking on the PlayStation Blog, Something We Made CEO Niklas Mikkelsen revealed that the update will include a brand new region, Basto, which will be unlocked once the player completes the main story adventure. Basto is an amalgamation of some of the ideas that did not make the cut for the initial release, and will feature new puzzles, characters, and even a brand new camera attachment: The Water Popper.
With six new music tracks, 20 new quests, and 20 new compendium critters to track down, Something We Made is predicting a good couple of hours of new adventure await all visitors to Basto. If you&#x27;re yet to check out TOEM, then it should be noted that it is currently available as one of September&#x27;s PlayStation Plus Essential releases for PS5. It is also available to purchase on PC and Nintendo Switch. You can check out our own CJ Andriessen&#x27;s very positive review right here.
We&#x27;ll be sure to let you all know when a release date for the TOEM DLC is officially announced.

[Featured Image Source: Thibault Miniou on ArtStation]
If you’ve read any of my features in the past, you’re probably well aware that I didn’t seriously get into games until I was in college. I had some consoles when I was younger, like a PS2, a Game Boy Advance SP, a Nintendo DS, and a Wii, but pretty much all of the games I played were “girly” horse-related, Barbie, or licensed Disney Channel spin-off games.
I had a great time with those games (which have merit in their own right), but I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t disappointed in retrospect that I missed out on some of the all-time greats. The good news is, now I’m an adult with my own time and money, and I’m fortunate enough to have a job centered around games — which means I can …</span>

                              <span>Check to see how long that new game will take to finish
The September update is rolling out for the Xbox app on PC, and it&#x27;s got one particularly neat feature. Microsoft has partnered with HowLongToBeat to show game completion estimates inside the app.
HowLongToBeat has long been a valuable resource in sifting and sorting through my games. It&#x27;s helped me decide which backlog games to start and when. Sometimes you want a long RPG adventure to pick away at, and sometimes you want something short-and-sweet, that you can finish in a weekend.
HLTB aggregates user contributions to share estimated completion times. This includes times for just the Main Story, or the Main Story and additional extras, or even a full completionist run.
With the September update, the Xbox app will display these numbers for &quot;most&quot; PC Game Pass games. So if Death Stranding is something you want to try out, you&#x27;ll know just how long it&#x27;ll take to beeline through it.

Other app improvements
The Xbox app is also getting some other updates. The Game Details pages are making it easier to find some sought-after details, like trailers, screenshots, and the game description.
Performance and reliability of the Xbox app are also getting a tune-up. Microsoft says that with the most recent update, the app now launches 15% faster, and it should be more responsive too. The Xbox post says the team has seen crash-free sessions improve to &quot;99.9%&quot;, and search results should be getting more relevant as well.
All of these are great improvements, but as someone who uses the Xbox app to peruse Game Pass games I might want to take a gander at, I really dig this Xbox and HowLongToBeat integration. Hopefully it doesn&#x27;t turn too many players away from longer games. But it is really nice to know an estimate for how much investment I&#x27;m getting into, for both lengthy and brief experiences.

                              <span>Sims fans rejoice
The Sims is one of the most prolific series in gaming, and has managed to stay at the forefront of the games space for over twenty years. The Sims community is especially known for their mods, with the most recent entry Sims 4 being incredibly robust in that regard. Now, as a thank you to fans for making the game the success that it is, EA has announced that the base game of The Sims 4 will be free to download on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and Xbox One starting on October 18, 2022.
&quot;EA and Maxis have welcomed millions of The Sims players over the years, and have watched in awe as they unleashed their imaginations, discovered and connected with ideas, experiences, and versions of themselves, both in-game and real life,&quot; EA said in a press release. &quot;With The Sims 4 base game going free, the team is more dedicated than ever to developing new and meaningful experiences for players, and will continue to develop and release packs, Kits, and Sims Delivery Express drops into the foreseeable future.&quot;
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;ZFkqTSU9tSo
As if that&#x27;s not good enough, players who have already purchased The Sims 4 by October 17 will get the Desert Luxe Kit as a free gift. EA Play and EA Play Pro members will also get a special treat on October 18 — with The Sims 4 EA Play Edition, players will get The Sims 4 Get To Work Expansion Pack, and the EA Play Pro Edition come with both The Sims 4 Get To Work Expansion Pack and The Sims 4 Toddler Stuff Pack.
In addition, EA will be hosting a special-edition stream on October 18 at 10 am PDT on The Sims&#x27; YouTube and Twitch channels called the &quot;Behind The Sims Summit,&quot; which will give players an inside look into what the team has in the works. EA really pulled out all the stops for this one, because this has to be one of the coolest events I&#x27;ve seen in gaming in a while.

Today, ID@Xbox and Twitch Gaming spotlighted some up-and-coming games to look out for. The showcase ranged from ghosts and magic to turnips robbing a bank. It was wild.
There were plenty of cool games to see and interesting projects either revealed or more greatly detailed. And a bunch of them are coming to Game Pass as well, making for a good weekend binge candidate when they arrive.
In order to keep track of all of them, we&#x27;ve put together this handy recap. It makes it a bit easier to scroll through them, catch back up, or find that one you&#x27;re looking to wishlist.

During this week&#x27;s Nintendo Direct presentation, Bayonetta 3 made a brief appearance, essentially reminding us that it exists, and will finally arrive on October 28, 2022. However, there was a promising line about getting a more in-depth Bayonetta 3 gameplay video later on, which you can now watch here, or below.

A full breakdown of the post-Nintendo Direct Bayonetta 3 gameplay video:
After a quick intro to the character, we get a look at some of Bayonetta&#x27;s traversal skills and enemy types. Homunculi will be some of the cannon fodder, and the &quot;ease&quot; of the combo system is highlighted, with a focus on accommodating new players.

One of the quieter, but no less exciting, headlines from yesterday&#x27;s Nintendo Direct presentation was the announcement that Treasure&#x27;s legendary shmup Radiant Silvergun is now available on Nintendo Switch. The 1998 smash hit can be purchased from the eShop right now, priced at an admittedly hefty $20.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;wGkOxWAhjbM
The Treasure-developed classic has something of a legacy with video game fans of a certain age, as it was mostly the stuff of legend to those who were not acquainted with the import scene, or had access to a decent arcade center. While considered one of the greatest shmups ever released to that point, Radiant Silvergun was tough to locate in North America and Europe, while the subsequent Sega Saturn port never left Japanese shores, and would fetch high prices on the secondary market.
Eventually, the frenetic shmup would find a wider audience through its 2011 Xbox 360 rerelease, and with this new Switch port, a new generation of shmup fans can blast off into the iconic action... It looks like you&#x27;ll still have to pay through the nose for the privilege, but at least we aren&#x27;t dropping $250 on eBay anymore. Rumors persist of a new Radiant Silvergun project, currently in the works to coincide with Treasure&#x27;s 30th anniversary. With Tokyo Game Show kicking off tomorrow, the truth will likely be out soon enough.
Radiant Silvergun is available now on Nintendo Switch. (Shortly after writing this article, the listing mysteriously vanished from the North American version of the eShop, though it was still available for purchase elsewhere.)

                              <span>This applies to both games
Pokemon Stadium transfers are a no-go, according to the tiny text right there in the accompanying sizzle reel for the recent Nintendo 64 Switch additions.
Backing up a bit, during this week&#x27;s Nintendo Direct, Nintendo confirmed a heap of Nintendo 64 games coming to Switch Online&#x27;s Expansion Pack scheme: Pilotwings 64, Mario Party 64, Mario Party 2, Mario Party 3, Pokemon Stadium, Pokemon Stadium 2, 1080 Snowboarding, Excitebike 64, and GoldenEye 64.
Wait, Pokemon Stadium 1 and 2?! Yep! That seemingly includes the minigames, which for a lot of folks, are the real reward. Though naturally, the addition of these two into the mix did spark the discussion of transfers, which are a no-go. According to the text on the bottom of the screen during the introduction of those two re-releases: &quot;Pokemon cannot be transferred to these games.&quot;
Given that rental Pokemon are an underlying part of the core series and the aforementioned minigames are in play, all of the as-is functionality of the two games softens the blow. That said, the inability to bring creatures in will make the core experience that much more arduous for a lot of folks (though there are completion runs with just rentals). At one point, transferring Pokemon into the Stadium series was an amazing gimmick, but for now, it&#x27;ll be relegated to the past.
If you&#x27;re interested in part of the reasoning behind the scenes, Serebii.net webmaster Joe Merrick breaks it down in a Twitter thread. It essentially has to do with reading Transfer Pak data, and how interactivity with the 3DS in any shape or form is not a priority for Nintendo given the imminent shutdown.

It finally happened. I’ve been broken. I do my best to play through each game that comes for me as thoroughly as possible, but I just can’t do it for Food Truck Simulator. Which is a shame because I really liked Gas Station Simulator. I like what Drago Entertainment is doing by trying to build a shared simulator universe. I appreciate their vision. Goofy simulators also have a solid space in my heart.
But Food Truck Simulator is undercooked. I hate to pull out one of those puns that normally go in the closing paragraph of a review, but its biggest problems are all related to not just a lack of polish but a dearth of care. Considering this was, weirdly enough, one of my most anticipated games of this year, the disappointment is all mine.

                              <span>Here are the patch notes
Fallout 76&#x27;s The Pitt update is finally here, after weeks of previews from Bethesda on how it will continue to evolve the game.
As is customary with updates for Fallout 76, both large and small, there&#x27;s a host of bug fixes (including power armor clipping!), as well as more quality-of-life features. A big one includes more fast travel control, including the ability to travel to an interior or exterior segment of select locations.
Interestingly, the new player experience (NPE) has been improved too. According to Bethesda, you&#x27;ll now be &quot;more prepared&quot; to start a brand new game, as you&#x27;ll be granted more items and equipment (including a &quot;variety of consumables&quot;). You&#x27;ll also get a &quot;vault fed&quot; buff that assists in curbing hunger and thirst for two hours, and early enem…</span>

                              <span>Collect resources and avoid other mechs
Synduality is a new sci-fi shooter from Bandai Namco Entertainment with crystals to collect and giant alien enemies to fight. But the most dangerous threat might not be them, but other players.
This new mech game debuted at yesterday&#x27;s Sony State of Play, showing off its combat and style. The thrust of Synduality is that you&#x27;re in a dystopian future where poisonous rain and aggressive, mutated creatures have changed the world.
You and your AI partner need to build a home for humanity, and to do that, you need resources. As a Drifter, you make a living collecting AO crystals. (No, not that AO.) And so you set out in your mech, dubbed a Cradle Coffin, to find some and bring them back.

                              <span>&quot;We will announce the new date once it has been determined&quot;
As you may recall, we reported six months ago that Advance Wars 1+2: Reboot Camp (a remake of Advance Wars 1 and 2 with extra features on Switch) had been delayed due to recent world events. Since then we haven&#x27;t heard an official statement from Nintendo; and even during the Nintendo Direct this week, the publisher remained silent on when it may see the light of day.
That silence has been broken via a statement from a Nintendo rep, who spoke to Stephen Totilo from Axios this week. Here&#x27;s their full reply:
&quot;The release has been delayed. We will announce the new date once it has been determined.&quot;

Totilo had asked if the game had been fully canceled, which it doesn&#x27;t seem to be at this time, given that it&#x27;s &quot;still delayed&quot; as of this week. Beyond current events, Nintendo also has several considerations when it comes to determining the Advance Wars 1+2: Reboot Camp launch date. The game is fully completed, and they can stick it into any schedule lull they so choose. They could also use the opportunity of an event or stream to &quot;re-announce&quot; it to the world.
With that in mind, given the bevy of strategy games we&#x27;re going to see on the Switch based on the Nintendo Direct presentation alone, there&#x27;s plenty of other things to play in the meantime, even if Advance Wars 1+2 continues to be delayed. Strategy game fans are seeing a renaissance of sorts, and the Switch is a great fit for many titles that would have previously been relegated to handhelds.

                              <span>Original release now a Collector&#x27;s Edition exclusive
Publisher 3goo has announced an official release date for the return of the cult fighting sequel The Rumble Fish 2 — Dimps&#x27; dystopian scrapper will launch on PC and console platforms December 8, 2022.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;JeB-HMEpUNk
As we&#x27;ve previously reported, The Rumble Fish 2 is a latter-day 2D fighter in the vein of precision examples such as Garou: Mark of the Wolves and Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike. The Rumble Fish franchise was rarely seen outside of its native Japan and, coming along so late in the advent of 3D fighters, remained in relative obscurity outside of the more dedicated fighting game fans.
This new re-release will represent the first official global release for the little-known slugfest, which depicts the tale of a gathering of off-the-wall characters, duking it out in a world devastated by the aftermath of capitalism and corporate greed. The series is renowned for its charismatic roster, boisterous audio, and trademark “S.M.A.” (Smooth Model Animation) visual style.

In addition to the release date, 3goo has also announced a physical collector&#x27;s edition, which is currently only scheduled for release in Japan. This set contains a hard copy of The Rumble Fish 2, along with an artbook, soundtrack CD, strategy guide, and three additional DLC characters. It also contains a digital download of the original game, which is now exclusive to the colllector&#x27;s edition. 3goo has suggested that the collector&#x27;s edition will be released in the west at a later date.
The Rumble Fish 2 launches December 8 on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.

                              <span>100 Platinum for a quick scavenger hunt
If you&#x27;re hankering for some quick Splatoon 3 My Nintendo platinum, you&#x27;ve come to the right place. You can net 100 points now via the game&#x27;s official site, so long as you&#x27;re in the mood for a quick scavenger hunt.
Like many activities before it, the gist is that you&#x27;ll be sifting through a Nintendo marketing site for hidden objects: and finding all of them will grant you 100 Platinum Points. In this case, it&#x27;s little squids (&quot;squiddos&quot;), which are embedded throughout the various sub-pages for the game. As usual, we have all the solutions below, so you can have it done quickly.
Here&#x27;s a quick cheat sheet for the Splatoon 3 My Nintendo challenge:
One squid is on the &quot;welcome to Splatsville page&quot; near the middle
Two squids are on the how to play page: one near the top below &quot;battle it out online,&quot; and another near the bottom after &quot;work together in Salmon Run&quot;
Two squids are on the weapons and gear page: one is below &quot;make it your own,&quot; and the other is right above &quot;save data bonus&quot;
That&#x27;s all five! Note that there are no squids present on the &quot;home&quot; or &quot;buy now&quot; pages. Once you pick up your points, you could spend them on the new Splatoon rewards.
As a reminder, if you want physical rewards, you can find our full Platinum Point guide here, which has been updated with details on weekly missions: bookmark it for when you need quick points for a reward. A handful of points is incredibly easy to get, as that’s basically just 15 minutes with Super Mario Run, or a quick sign-on to the 3DS or Wii U 3Shop. Also remember that any shipments are bundled together, so you can pay a flat rate for multiple items instead of paying it each time. Just know that items go out of stock on My Nintendo frequently, and some are never restocked.

Valkyrie Elysium is not exactly a new Valkyrie Profile. It’s good to go in with that initial mindset: it’s got shades of the Valkyrie franchise, but it’s a distinctly more real-time action game. In my hands-on time with the demo ahead of its release, it reminded me of modern action-RPGs way more than it did tri-Ace’s turn-based combo-stringing battles.
Developer Soleil is bringing its own mark to the Valkyrie series alongside Square Enix, and to its credit, the action made the biggest impact. It clicks into place quickly, and gives me a ton of interlinking tools to mix around and sprinkle throughout my combos. It’s this slice of the story that gives me pause, and has me wondering how the rest of Valkyrie …</span>

As part of today&#x27;s RGG Studio live stream, the developer revealed a brand new title, Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name. This &quot;side-story&quot; release is described as a new action-adventure, currently in development for PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms with a 2023 release date.
While the developer was incredibly tight-lipped in regards to the details, the new title is an &quot;action-adventure game&quot; that will detail the actions of The Dragon of Dojima, Kiryu Kazuma, following his departure from the series in Yakuza 6. The purpose of Like a Dragon Gaiden is to tell Kiryu&#x27;s story from Yakuza 6, through his brief appearance in Like a Dragon 7, and his return in the just revealed Like a Dragon 8.
Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name will launch in 2023 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox.

                              <span>The streets of Kamurocho are about to get messy
During this morning&#x27;s RGG Studio live stream presentation, the developer released a teaser trailer confirming the arrival of Like a Dragon 8, the newest entry in the legendary Like a Dragon/Yakuza franchise. The new sequel will arrive in 2024 on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC platforms.
The new sequel will feature both Kazuma Kiryu and Ichiban Kasuga in a dual protagonist role. The former is sporting a new &quot;silver fox&quot; hairstyle, which RGG Studio insists will be explained in the new game&#x27;s storyline, as will the snakeskin-shoed hero&#x27;s reason for returning to the mean streets of Kamurocho.
Gameplay style was not discussed, outside of referring to Like a Dragon 8 as an &quot;RPG.&quot; The new title will be the largest scale Yakuza/Like a Dragon title to date. It will be available on previous-gen consoles, including PS4 and Xbox One. Also revealed during the showcase were a release date for Like a Dragon: Ishin and new side-story adventure Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name.

                              <span>Ishin finally comes to the west on PS4 and PS5
[Update: RGG Studio has released a new, near-six-minute story trailer for Like a Dragon: Ishin! You can check it out below. Like a Dragon: Ishin! will launch worldwide on February 22, 2023.]
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;4wVSyxsUQHU
A long-awaited Yakuza title is making its way to new fans. Like a Dragon: Ishin is a historical action-adventure, launching globally in February 2023.
Ishin is a historical thriller set in 1860s Kyo, a fictional version of Kyoto. Hero Sakamoto Ryoma is a true historical figure, and the story follows the overthrow of the shogunate and how the samurai era vanished.
If the faces look familiar, it&#x27;s for good reason. Kazuma Kiryu is essentially &quot;cast&quot; as Sakamoto Ryoma, and others will appear as well. Yes, that includes Goro Majima.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;iWCjnYx7Ytc
While Yakuza Ishin launched in Japan in 2014, western players haven&#x27;t had a localized version to play just yet. And more than a localization, Like a Dragon: Ishin is being built on Unreal Engine 4. I have to say, it&#x27;s looking pretty darn good on it, too.
Of course, the game will still have heat actions for some big finishers. Sakamoto can also wield a blade in Swordsman style, a gun in the Gunman style, or both in the Wild Dancer style. Or maybe just go back to good old fists, in the Brawler stance.
Like a dragon
There&#x27;s more to come for Like a Dragon: Ishin, and we might not have to wait long. Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio is set to host a summit live stream early tomorrow morning. Hopefully we&#x27;ll get some more details and info on RGG&#x27;s plans there.
Today&#x27;s State of Play confirms that Like a Dragon: Ishin is coming to PlayStation 4 and PS5. The Sega upload of the trailer also confirms Ishin is coming to Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC via Windows and Steam.

                              <span>Another action RPG (like that&#x27;s a bad thing)
Depending on how you slice it, the highlight of today&#x27;s State of Play was either Like a Dragon: Ishin from Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio or Rise of the Ronin from Team Ninja. (Why not both?) The developer shared its first look at this PS5 open-world action RPG, which is seven years in the making. It&#x27;s another historical-inspired tale with over-the-top flair, as you&#x27;ll quickly see in the trailer — a mix of &quot;gameplay and in-game cinematics.&quot;
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;0gwsQvDGh4o
&quot;Set in the late 19th century, Japan is facing the darkest of times as it struggles with its oppressive rulers and deadly diseases while western influence permeates as civil war continues to rage between the Tokugawa Shogunate and the Anti-Shogunate factions,&quot; noted director Fumihiko Yasuda. &quot;Here in this time of mayhem, you embody a Ronin character, a warrior bound to no master and free to make choices of its own.&quot;
Going a step further, Yasuda calls Rise of the Ronin the &quot;most ambitious and challenging project for Team Ninja Studio to date,&quot; promising a &quot;multilayered story&quot; and &quot;unrestricted open gameplay.&quot; The action-game fundamentals can always get this team&#x27;s foot in the door for me — so while I&#x27;m already &quot;in,&quot; so to speak, I am curious to hear concrete info.
For now, there&#x27;s that cool glider and rifle-stabbing animation. I love a good finisher. From everything we can glean, this looks like another skillful action romp. Keep &#x27;em coming.

Rise of the Ronin will launch in 2024 and it&#x27;s said to be a &quot;PlayStation 5 console exclusive,&quot; which opens the door for a (well-advised) PC version.
Considering Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty (the Three Kingdoms-inspired Nioh successor) is coming up first in 2023, that far-off timing makes sense. We&#x27;re feasting as action fiends.

                              <span>Really hope we don&#x27;t have to kill that jellyfish
A new story trailer for God of War Ragnarok debuted today. And it sees Kratos and Atreus hurtling towards some big confrontations as fate winds around them.
This is probably the biggest look we&#x27;ve had at the new God of War yet, and it&#x27;s packed with a ton of details. The trailer premiered during today&#x27;s Sony State of Play, and really drives home what Kratos and Atreus are up against.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;hfJ4Km46A-0
In the three-minute trailer, we see Kratos dueling with what looks like valkyries in the cosmos. They head underwater to make some nautical acquaintances, come face-to-face with old &quot;friends&quot; like Freya, and dang, there&#x27;s even a giant jellyfish.
Tons of set pieces and new attacks get shown off, including some combo moves for Kratos and Atreus. And at the very end, Atreus rips apart the sky with the help of a wolf pal. Norse mythology enjoyers probably have a ton of details to pick apart.

And it closes off with a match-up between Kratos and Thor, the big battle that felt like it was teased in the final moments of 2018&#x27;s God of War.
Godhood ain&#x27;t easy
God of War Ragnarok is locked in for a November 9 release. It&#x27;s a date we&#x27;re inching closer and closer to, as we&#x27;re already into September. And today, we also got news that God of War is getting a special Sony DualSense controller.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;uvZZvTRFbTs
It&#x27;s two-toned blue and white, and it&#x27;s got the bear and wolf insignias on the touchpad. A really nice touch!
While I would normally say I don&#x27;t need to see more of God of War Ragnarok at this point, today&#x27;s story trailer definitely has me itching to play the new game. I&#x27;m ready to smash up some bad guys and throw the Leviathan Axe around again.
God of War Ragnarok goes live on PS4 and PS5 on November 9.

We aren&#x27;t yet at a point where Sony is slinging game-themed PS5 consoles like in the PS4 days, but at least God of War fans are getting a special controller variant. Announced during this afternoon&#x27;s State of Play, Sony will release a God of War Ragnarok DualSense controller for PS5 on November 9, 2022 — the same day Ragnarok is out on PS4/PS5.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;uvZZvTRFbTs
The white and blue DualSense controller has a bear and wolf insignia to represent Kratos and Atreus, according to Sony. It&#x27;s a nice contrast to the lighter Starlight Blue model.
Funny enough, for a split second, I thought this was going to be the State of Play&#x27;s closer, which goes to show how low my expectations tend to be for these showings. Instead, the controller tidbit just led into our fullest-yet look at God of War Ragnarok&#x27;s story with a new trailer, and yep, it looks awesome. The weight of the story is finally sinking in.
I&#x27;ve got too many of these gamepads as is (three, somehow!), but I&#x27;m sure this will sell out fast. Pre-orders for the God of War Ragnarok DualSense begin on September 27.
A price hasn&#x27;t been listed yet, but I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised to see a bit of a premium over the $70-$75 tag for the current DualSense colorways.

During today&#x27;s State of Play presentation, developer Shift Up released a new gameplay trailer for its previously teased hack &#x27;n&#x27; slash adventure Project EVE, which has now been officially titled Stellar Blade. It will launch as a PS5 exclusive at some point in 2023.

Previously shown off during a State of Play presentation one year ago, Stellar Blade follows a powerful mercenary, Eve, as she spearheads a mission to bring humanity back to Earth, following a violent expulsion at the claws of a monstrous force known as &quot;NA:tives.&quot; It is up to Eve and her military friends to take back Earth from its occupiers.
Equipped with amazing acrobatic ability and cybernetic weaponry, Eve will slice &#x27;n&#x27; dice her way through an army of enemies, while upgrading her weapons, skills, combat maneuvers, and high fashion with the expenditure of gathered XP, which in the Stellar Blade universe is known as &quot;Beta Gauge.&quot; It looks suitably flashy and action-packed, with an opulent and special-effect-packed presentation style. One worth keeping an eye on for the Devil May Cry and Bayonetta crowd methinks.
Stellar Blade will launch exclusively on PS5 in 2023. Next year is filling up fast.

Welcome back! It is a new Tuesday, which means tonight there will be a new episode of Spot Dodge: A Live Nintendo Podcast exclusively on Destructoid. Topics: Tonight, we’re discussing all the recent announcements from the Nintendo Direct this morning.
Breath of the Wild 2 finally has a real name with The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. To many gamers&#x27; surprise, Pikmin 4 was revealed. Fire Emblem Engage is coming on January 20 and it has a lengthy trailer with tons to speculate on. Then, we saw It Takes Two for Switch, Octopath Traveler II, new N64 games for Nintendo Switch Online, and tons more.
The Direct was jam-packed with a lot of cool-looking titles, but I can&#x27;t help but feel slightly disappointed. I thou…</span>

                              <span>Can you survive the road to hell?
We&#x27;ve seen lots of driving games over the years, but for the most part, their gameplay focuses on racing, demolition derbies, or navigating a large open world map. Pacific Drive is a new run-based, first-person driving survival game, the debut title from Seattle-based Ironwood Studios. The developers behind this new project have worked on classics like Ratchet &amp; Clank, Mortal Kombat, Call of Duty, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, and many more. Pacific Drive was revealed today during the PlayStation State of Play, and featured a heart-pounding drive through dark, desolate woods. It seems there is a mystery afoot, and the only way to figure it out is to drive towards it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;dN1I_znpzrk
&quot;Your car is your only companion as you navigate a surreal and anomaly-filled reimagining of the Pacific Northwest,&quot; says the description on the game&#x27;s official website. &quot;Structured as a &#x27;road-like,&#x27; each excursion into the wilderness brings unique and strange challenges, as you restore and upgrade your car from an abandoned garage that acts as your home base. With the car as your lifeline, you’ll unravel a long-forgotten mystery as you make your way to the heart of the Olympic Exclusion Zone.&quot;

While much of Pacific Drive remains a mystery, I have to admit that this is one of the most unique premises I&#x27;ve seen at these game showcases as of late. Government secrets, spooky monsters, and some kind of supernatural weather phenomenon? Looks like a recipe for a classic, edge-of-your-seat adventure. I&#x27;m usually pretty bad at driving mechanics in games, so I think I&#x27;ll probably need to brush up a bit before Pacific Drive finally releases.
Pacific Drive will be coming to PlayStation 5 and PC sometime in 2023. Until then, I&#x27;ll be on the lookout for any more updates, because this is certainly one I&#x27;ll be looking forward to.

Talk about kicking things off with a bang — PlayStation began its State of Play live stream with the official reveal of Bandai Namco&#x27;s next entry to its legendary 3D fight franchise, Tekken. Tekken 8 is currently in development &quot;exclusively&quot; for PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X/S.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;zI6I63PnW0Q
The very attractive trailer saw long-time rivals and troubled father-son duo Jin Kazama and Kazuya Mishima battle it out amidst a raging storm. In what appeared to be a blend of cinematic visuals and real-time gameplay, the footage sure looked like Tekken, albeit with an absolutely stunning new look.
&quot;We are very excited to show the next generation of Tekken,&quot; said Katsuhiro Harada, chief producer at Bandai Namco Studios, in a press statement. &quot;The team at Bandai Namco Studios has been hard at work to bring groundbreaking new features to Tekken 8, pushing the feeling of power in battles continuously further by harnessing the power of the latest generation of consoles. We can’t wait to show you more in the months to come!&quot;
Tekken 8 is currently in development for PlayStation 5, PC, and Xbox Series X/S using Unreal Engine 5. Check out more info over at PlayStation Blog.

                              <span>At Gamescom 2022, we spoke to James Worrall and Adam Olsson, Creative Director and Art Director on Dead Island 2, to learn more about the long-awaited sequel, how the team is balancing comedy and horror, and how exactly they plan to make zombies monstrous again with their procedural FLESH system. Set within the once-bustling city of Los Angeles, the game pulls inspiration from 80s action movies like Die Hard and George A. Romero&#x27;s Dawn Of The Dead and features iconic locations overrun with hordes of zombies you can eviscerate piece by piece.

                              <span>Tokyo Game Show 2022 will run from Sept. 15 through Sept. 18, and Sega has helped kick off the event with a new Sonic Frontiers trailer. 
It feature more Sonic Frontiers gameplay, which consists of the blue blur climbing colossal machines as if they&#x27;re mountains, but when he reaches the top of one, he stumbles upon something very special: a Chaos Emerald. As any Sonic fan likely knows, collecting all of these will help the hedgehog transform into Super Sonic, a Saiyan-like version of the character that&#x27;s faster and stronger. And sure enough, that&#x27;s exactly what happens in this new TGS Sonic Frontiers trailer. 
Check it out for yourself below: 


As you can see, this is the first appearance of Super Sonic in Sonic Frontiers&#x27; marketing thus far. It&#x27;s also the first confirmation that Super Sonic is in the game. This trailer is another exciting Sonic Frontiers trailer showcasing more of what we can expect when the game hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on November 8.

                              <span>Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio has announced that its Yakuza-adjacent Judgment series will make its way to Steam for the first time. The best news: they&#x27;re out on Steam today.
Judgment and Lost Judgment come to Steam on September 14. This marks the first appearance of each game on PC (though Judgment has been available to stream on PC via Stadia). 
This news is especially significant given that RGG Studio originally planned to release Lost Judgment on PC when it launched last year. However, that version was nixed when the talent agency representing actor Takuya Kimura, who portrays protagonist Takayuki Yagami, enforced strict policies about allowing Kimura’s likeness on PC. Both parties&#x27; inability to agree threatened Judgment’s future as a franchise since RGG Studio has pushed for more of its titles to come to Steam; every mainline Yakuza game is available on the storefront, for example. It would appear those issues have been ironed out, which bodes well for the potential of a third game. 
The Judgment games are noir action thrillers that adhere to the same open-world design template as the Yakuza series. Though the plots largely unfold in Kamurocho, the series stars a new cast of characters and emphasizes investigative gameplay. Players control Yagami, a disgraced lawyer and private detective who works to unravel a pair of conspiracy plots. In Yakuza fashion, he also has his hands full helping his colorful clients and random citizens solve more light-hearted – or comically absurd – problems.

                              <span>Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio, the team behind the popular and long-running Yakuza franchise, revealed yesterday that it&#x27;s remaking Like A Dragon: Ishin and releasing it for the first time in the West next year. That reveal trailer looked great, but it was short and sweet. 
Now, RGG has released a new &quot;Ambush&quot; trailer that showcases more than five minutes of Like A Dragon: Ishin, giving us a better look at this upcoming Yakuza spinoff. Like A Dragon: Ishin was first released on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 3 in 2014, but it never came out in the West. This new release rebuilds Like A Dragon: Ishin from the ground up, and you can check out how great it&#x27;s looking in the trailer below: 


Like A Dragon: Ishin takes place in the Late Edo Period of Japan, in the 1860s. After completing his special sword training, Sakamoto Ryoma returns to his home in Tosa, only to find conflict against a prestigious samurai. You can read more about it in our story here.
Like A Dragon: Ishin hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC in February.</span>

                              <span>Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio announced that Yakuza 8 is called Like A Dragon 8 today, and that game&#x27;s announcement trailer revealed that former series protagonist Kazuma Kiryu is back alongside Yakuza: Like A Dragon protagonist Ichiban Kasuga. Now, RGG has announced Like A Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name, a new Yakuza game that will follow Kiryu&#x27;s life following the events of Yakuza 6: The Song of Life leading up to Like A Dragon 8. 
In the reveal trailer, which aired today during the RGG Summit 2022 showcase, we see Kiryu at a monastery. Having left behind his former Yakuza life, as well as his name, Kiryu, who now goes by Joryu, is trying to live the life of a monk. However, he&#x27;s seemingly pulled into one more job – an escort mission – and if today&#x27;s Like A Dragon 8 trailer is any indication, it seems this final job pulls him back into the life he had put behind him. 
Check it out for yourself in the reveal trailer below:


As you can see, The Man Who Erased His Name is shaping up to be a treat for longtime Yakuza fans and it seems like necessary playing in the leadup to 2024&#x27;s Like A Dragon 8. Like A Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC in 2023.

When I played the original version of Resident Evil Village on PlayStation 5, I didn’t pay too much attention to the environmental details, like this painting. In this playthrough, I am frequently distracted by them. Even though this version is essentially the same game, it takes on new life through PSVR2’s stunning display.
The headset’s OLED display delivers a wide 110-degree field of view capable of presenting games in vivid 4K HDR. Unlike most VR headsets on the market, I’m not seeing any general pixelization, artifacting, or graininess in the text – everything looks sharp. The display resolution is 2000x2040 per eye, and the games can run at smooth framerat…</span>

                              <span>The eighth mainline installment in the popular and long-running Yakuza franchise has been revealed and it&#x27;s called Like A Dragon 8. 
Set up as a direct sequel to 2020&#x27;s Yakuza: Like A Dragon, which starred a new protagonist, Ichiban Kasuga, and turn-based RPG mechanics rather than brawler combat, it was a hit amongst fans. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s no surprise Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio is following it up with another Like A Dragon game. Check out the Like A Dragon 8 reveal trailer for yourself below:


As you can see, the former protagonist of Yakuza, Kazuma Kiryu, is back. He was the protagonist in the first six Yakuza games, and now he&#x27;s back in Like A Dragon 8. Ichiban tells Kiryu it&#x27;s Hero time – remember, he&#x27;s a big fan of the Dragon Quest series which stars plenty of heroes – before the trailer cuts to both of their faces, revealing that some time has passed, with both characters looking at least a little older than when we last saw them. 
Like A Dragon 8 is due out PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC sometime in 2024.

                              <span>Today brought a doubleheader of platform-holder livestreams. Our day kicked off with a Nintendo Direct, which brought us more than 40 minutes of headlines, gameplay trailers, announcements, and even name reveals. We finished off the day with a PlayStation State of Play, giving us trailers and information for the PlayStation family of consoles, including PlayStation VR2.
Now that the dust has settled a little bit, we want to know what caught your eye. Was it something from Nintendo&#x27;s digital event? Perhaps the name and release date reveal of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom? Was the impressive list of Nintendo 64 games coming to Switch Online&#x27;s Expansion Pack? Maybe you&#x27;re super hyped for Fire Emblem Engage?
Or was it something from the PlayStation State of Play event? Tekken 8 was an expected but exciting reveal, while games like Rise of the Ronin and Like a Dragon: Ishin look like an absolute blast. Of course, we can&#x27;t talk about the State of Play stream without mentioning that God of War: Ragnarök footage.
Let us know in the comments below what you&#x27;re most hyped about coming out of today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct and PlayStation State of Play. If you happened to miss any of the announcements, you can check out our news hub for all our coverage from today.</span>

                              <span>Sony revealed a brand new story trailer for God Of War Ragnarök during today’s State Of Play stream. The video showcased otherworldly imagery, including astral jellyfish, giant dinosaur-like creatures, and notably, a pivotal scene wherein Atreus appears to usher in Fimbulwinter, the end of the world, alongside Sköll and Hati – two wolves that are the offspring of Fenrir. According to Norse mythology, Sköll and Hati are two wolves who exist to one day spark the beginning of Ragnarök by chasing and devouring the sun and the moon. It’s pretty clear that’s what is happening in this new trailer, but why is Atreus helping them?
Additionally, it seems Atreus is hiding critical information from his father, Kratos, so why is Kratos following orders from his teenage son? Why is Freya holding a sword up to Atreus’ throat in the trailer? Is she holding Atreus hostage or trying to show Kratos the same pain she suffered after her son Baldur was killed in the first game? The trailer creates more questions than answers, precisely what I want from pre-launch marketing. 


We’ll have to wait to find the answers to these questions when God Of War Ragnarök releases on November 8. In the meantime, let me know your story theories in the comments below!</span>

The game takes place in the Late Edo Period, in the 1860s. After finishing his sword training, Sakamoto Ryoma returns home to Tosa, only to get into a fight with a prestigious and highly ranked samurai. Now, players can change the course of Japan&#x27;s history in this Yakuza spin-off game.
Like a Dragon: Ishin is set to launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC in February 2023.</span>

                              <span>PlayStation and Team Ninja have announced Rise of the Ronin, a new action game coming exclusively to PlayStation 5 sometime in 2024. 
It was revealed during today&#x27;s PlayStation State of Play, and if you&#x27;re at all familiar with Team Ninja&#x27;s other games, you&#x27;re probably going to be into this one. It&#x27;s not quite clear if it&#x27;s taking up the Soulslike mantle that other Team Ninja games have (looking at you, Nioh), but there were a few gameplay sequences that showed some combat similar to From Software&#x27;s hit series. 
Check it out for yourself in the reveal trailer below: 


As you can see, Rise of the Ronin looks quite interesting. The combat looks fast, brutal, and explosive, and the characters look fun. The world looks especially unique, too, with some of the game seemingly taking place in more rural areas of Japan and others taking place in more dense villages and towns.

Unfortunately, it might be a while before we learn more because Rise of the Ronin won&#x27;t hit PlayStation 5 until 2024.

Waking up with each day feeling the same may have been a standard part of Pandemic living, but it is the driving force behind In Stars and Time, a new timeloop RPG coming to Switch in 2023.
You will play as Siffrin, a hero who is attempting to stop a tyrannical ruler with their group of friends, but the pesky clock keeps resetting at the end of each day (isn&#x27;t it annoying when that happens?) In Stars and Time will see you learning from your mistakes as you attempt to make it all the way through the day without dying before you&#x27;re right back where you started.

                              <span>These are the Switch ports you want, right?
It seems that lots of people have been having connection issues with Splatoon 3 since its launch last week, and that&#x27;s caused many to search the internet for any kind of tips or tricks to help them maintain a better internet connection. And this has brought to light a Support Page on Nintendo&#x27;s official website that has been around for a while, yet is coming under increasing scrutiny as players attempt to self-fix their Splatoon 3 connection issues.
In the guide linked above, Nintendo advises on how to forward network ports to a Nintendo Switch. Confused already? Don&#x27;t worry, we&#x27;ll explain (because we absolutely definitely knew all this before writing this article).

We&#x27;ve finally found out the title of Breath of the Wild 2 (which means we can stop calling it Breath of the Wild 2) alongside a brand-new trailer in the latest Nintendo Direct — and it&#x27;s called Tears of the Kingdom, which has already set off a ton of theories.
You know what that means, Zelda fans — it&#x27;s time to put our speculation hats on once more, and get to dissecting this trailer for every wee nugget of Zelda lore we can find.

Storage space has always been one of the Switch&#x27;s downsides, with the system&#x27;s internal memory never really being enough to house the many games, patches and more we find ourselves downloading these days. The issue makes a microSD card an essential purchase for any Switch owner and thankfully, there are plenty of great options available on the market already.
While you might want to opt for microSD cards that offer the best value for money, there are some fancier, officially-licensed designs available, and that range has now grown thanks to these new Fortnite cards. Both 128GB and 256GB sizes are available, with the latter naturally costing a little more, and they can be found at retailers like Amazon and Best Buy – stock is already proving a little sketchy, so we&#x27;ve also included links for you to buy them directly from manufacturer Western Digital below:

Who wants another Square Enix announcement? Back in 2020, the company revealed a brand new Dragon Quest spin-off game based on the manga and anime Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai. Two years later, we now know that the game — developed by Game Studio and Kai Graphics — is coming to Switch in a simultaneous worldwide release.
No specific date has been announced for Infinity Strash: Dragon Quest The Adventure of Dai yet, but we&#x27;ll be getting more information during the Tokyo Game Show, which kicks off later tonight. On 18th September at 12:45pm JST (that&#x27;s a very early 4:45am in the UK, or 11:45pm EST) we&#x27;ll get a glimpse at the “Temple of Recollection” and “Memento Bonds” (thanks Gematsu!).

At the beginning of our Temtem adventure, we had every intention to review the Pokémon-inspired massively multiplayer game based on its own merit, steering clear of comparisons between the two as best we could. Developer Crema never shied away from where Temtem’s blueprints came from during its successful Kickstarter campaign and lengthy Early Access period, yet with its 1.0 release and debut on the Nintendo Switch, we naively hoped we could divorce Temtem from its muse. It only took a few hours in the Airborne Archipelago to realise how futile this would be. Of the massive mansion that Pikachu and pals built, Temtem exists as both praise and criticism, innovating, refining, and referencing a two-and-a-half-decade-old formula without shame.
Temtem’s world is made up of the six floating islands of the colourful Airborne Archipelago. Here, a professor let us choose one of three starting Temtem. Then an annoying rival picked a fight with us. Afterward, we caught more Temtem, foiled a criminal organisation’s plans, and challenged Dojo Masters. Each Temtem we caught or fought against had one or two types and abilities, and most could evolve after a certain amount of levels. If a wild Bulbasaur appeared while we were exploring the islets of Omninesia, it would’ve taken us a moment to remember which game we were playing.

                              <span>More from the frontier.
Sonic Frontiers is due to release on Switch on November 8th. While that is just a few short months from now, we are still being provided with more and more footage at an alarmingly fast rate (could we really resist a speed reference?) Today&#x27;s &#x27;TGS Trailer&#x27; continues this trend with a fresh look at the game&#x27;s Titan Battles, as well as a sneak preview of the yellow hedgehog, Super Sonic, in action.
We know the drill of these trailers by now. Running up walls? Check. Bounce combat? Check. Reluctance to show gameplay footage? Check. The new trailer (found above) once again consists mainly of cinematic visuals, with Sonic doing his thing in the game&#x27;s &#x27;open world&#x27; landscape, taking on huge titans by running through a series of loops to gain speed boosts - who would have thought it?

Toby Fox, the creator of Undertale and Deltarune, will seemingly begin writing columns for Weekly Famitsu Magazine, according to Famitsu itself.
The column will be called &quot;Toby Fox&#x27;s Secret Base&quot; with the first piece featuring in Weekly Famistu Magazine dated September 29th, 2022. Fox will effectively be replacing Masahiro Sakurai, director of games such as Super Smash Bros. Ultimate and Kid Icarus: Uprising, who previously wrote over 600 articles for Famitsu between 2003 and 2021.

As the dust settles on another Nintendo Direct, we think it&#x27;s fair to say that our little gaming minds have been sufficiently blown. We&#x27;ve got news of GoldenEye! Pikmin 4! Fire Emblem Engage! Tunic! But - and let&#x27;s be real for a minute here - the thing that really left us Sheikah not stirred was the brand new trailer, release date and (wait for it) title of the Switch&#x27;s follow-up to Breath of the Wild.
No longer to be referred to as Breath of the Wild 2, we now know, officially, that The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is going to be our game of 2023 (a little early to predict that one? Nah.)

Those of you with a good enough memory to recall anything before yesterday&#x27;s Nintendo Direct announcements (were there even games back then?) might remember the release of the creepy life-sim-come-cult-builder, Cult of the Lamb. Well, we had a great time with it — as seen in our 8/10 review — and now those of you who had a blast summoning demons can bring a little bit of the Satanic joy to your homes.
Tthe Cult of the Lamb soundtrack is getting the ol&#x27; vinyl treatment with pre-orders opening on the Devolver Digital merchandise store today. The soundtrack itself was perhaps one of the elements of the game that many overlooked — oh, how sacrificial rituals can distract the eye — but with its creepy chants and whispers building up to big boss fight tunes, the vinyl should provide a great (if not rather unsettling) listen.

                              <span>It&#x27;s about (witch) time.
Believe it or not, it’s been nearly five whole years since the wickedly stylish witch Bayonetta revealed the fact her action combat series would become a trilogy, and it’s been almost eight years since Bayonetta 2 released on Wii U. That original reveal trailer showed so little and left us with so many questions. Would this be Bayonetta&#x27;s final adventure? Will we play as her exclusively throughout the game? This was all we had to chew on for so long and our minds couldn&#x27;t rest.
Bayo stans were starting to get worried as years passed on with little updates from the developers Platinum Games, who’ve kept themselves busy with the likes of the stellar Astral Chain, divisive Star Fox Zero, and the phenomenal NieR: Automata, which is coming to Switch soon. Then, around this same time last year, Nintendo pulled the trigger and gave us our first look at genuine gameplay of Bayonetta 3 on Switch and that’s when faith was restored.

Did you know that some of the people who worked on the Bravely and Octopath series made a game for Apple Arcade? It almost slipped our minds, too! Until yesterday, in the Nintendo Direct, Various Daylife made a surprise appearance. Launching on the service back in 2019, this simplified RPG is now available to buy on the Switch eShop. Like, right now.
Curiously titled, just like a lot of other Square Enix games, Various Daylife was developed by DokiDoki Groove Works, the same studio behind other Square Enix mobile games such as Octopath Traveler: Champions of the Continent, Valkyrie Anatomia: The Origin, as well as the adorable Switch game Taiko no Tatsujin: Drum ‘n’ Fun. But many of the team behind some of Square Enix&#x27;s popular turn-based RPGs also helped out, including Bravely series and Live A Live producer Tomoya Asano.

Cast your minds back to early this year, you might recall that Front Mission 1st and Front Mission 2 remakes were confirmed during the Nintendo Direct presentation in February. Now, publisher Forever Entertainment has showcased more footage for both titles and confirmed that, yes, a third remake is also on the way.
Front Mission 2 originally launched exclusively in Japan back in 1997 and was well received by fans and critics alike. It&#x27;s launch on Switch will be the first instance it will be officially available for audiences in the west. Both Front Mission 1st and Front Mission 2 will feature new and improved visuals whilst staying faithful to the classic turn-based tactical combat that fans know and love.

Teased by Koei Tecmo just last week, Ryza is back! Atelier Ryza: Alchemist of the End &amp; the Secret Key was announced during yesterday&#x27;s Nintendo Direct, and it sees Reisalin &quot;Ryza&quot; Stout returning as the star in her third Atelier game. And we don&#x27;t have long to wait, as the game will bubble up on Switch on 24th February in the West, and 22nd February in Japan.
Details on the game were light, but we did get a look at some of the game&#x27;s locales, as well as some familiar faces returning from the previous two games. Gust&#x27;s premier franchise is looking and sounding as pretty as ever.

During Nintendo&#x27;s Direct Presentation yesterday, it was announced that the acclaimed PC management sim Factorio will be making its way to the Nintendo Switch on October 28th, 2023.
Originally launched in 2020, Factorio tasks players with building and managing a factory-style system, utilising resource gathering and automated construction to construct the most efficient factory possible. All the while, you&#x27;ll need yo defend your creation&#x27;s against the planet&#x27;s indigenous fauna, which become more hostile as a result or your factory&#x27;s polltant emissions, meaning you&#x27;ll need to find a delicate balance between expansion and defensive capabilities.

                              <span>A group of U.S. lawmakers wants domain name registry Verisign to help tackle online piracy. The company has a key role in the domain names system, overseeing many popular TLDs including .com, .tv and .net. Verisign believes that it should operate in a content-neutral manner but it doesn&#x27;t rule out that, through the right protocols and processes, it can help to address piracy as well.

In Hungary a new anti-piracy option has been placed on the table - cyberattacks against IPTV pirates. What could possibly go wrong?

                              <span>At risk of turning RPS into a Ryu Ga Gotoku fansite today, I must inform you that the rumoured release of the Judgment series on PC has happened. Available now on PC through Steam, The Judgment Collection includes Judgment, its sequel Lost Judgment, and The Kaito Files story expansion all into one handy bundle. That sure is a whole lot of judgment. Watch the trailer below for more than your daily recommended dose of kick-punching action.

                              <span>Last time, you decided that physics freakouts are better than beautiful food. As much as I admire delicious dishes, I am very glad that something that&#x27;s wholly unintentional (and often unwanted by developers) is still in the running. Games are weird and daft magic tracks, and that&#x27;s great. This week, you must choose between oddity and serendipity. What&#x27;s better: impossible geometry, or games playing the music CD left in your drive?

                              <span>Longtime Yakuza series protagonist Kazuma Kiryu is back in force, starring in two freshly announced games. I’ve already reported on Like A Dragon 8, which stars Kiryu and new series main character Ichiban Kasuga, but devs Ryu Go Gotoku Studio also revealed that another game is coming in 2023. It&#x27;ll explain what happened to Kiryu in his temporary absence from the series and is called, and I’m not making this up, Like A Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name. To prove it to you, you can watch the trailer below.

Although, as you can see in the trailer, you can also look for friendship, attraction, romance, or a combination of the latter two. Plus: mystery! Who isn&#x27;t intrigued by a romance game where someone utters the immortal phrase, &quot;There&#x27;s been a murder&quot;?

                              <span>Bandai Namco has revealed Tekken 8, a new sequel in the popular and long-running fighting game franchise. 
Tekken 8 was revealed in a new cinematic trailer that aired during today&#x27;s PlayStation State of Play. It began with a few shots to set up the scenery before cutting to two series mainstays, Kazuya and Kazuya&#x27;s son, Jin. The two duke it out in what appears to be a fair fight, that is until Kazuya calls forth the power of the devil gene inside him to finish the fight. 
Check it out for yourself in the reveal trailer below:


Unfortunately, this trailer doesn&#x27;t reveal much else. Tekken 8 looks very much like Tekken, which is great. The trailer also doesn&#x27;t reveal a release date – it just says to stay tuned for more information.

                              <span>As one of the most influential and beloved shooters of all time, GoldenEye 007 is a special game for many who played it in the late &#x27;90s. However, it&#x27;s been a long time since the game has been playable on modern consoles. That changes soon, as the revolutionary first-person shooter received a duo of announcements today. First, we learned about a Switch version as part of the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack N64 catalog. However, we also learned the title (which was developed by now-Microsoft-owned Rare), is also coming to Xbox as a part of Game Pass and Rare Replay.
When the game arrives on Xbox, it will include the classic campaign, complete with the original difficulty settings and cheat codes (no word on if &quot;DK Mode&quot; will be renamed to something more generic like &quot;Big Head Mode&quot; for the Xbox version). The Xbox version will also include the split-screen local competitive multiplayer mode that made the game such a mainstay for get-togethers in the N64 era.


Unfortunately, it does not appear as though the online multiplayer available in the Nintendo Switch Online version will make the jump to the Xbox version. However, the Xbox version of GoldenEye 007 does include improved control options (including dual analog stick support), native 16:9 resolution up to 4K Ultra HD, a consistent refresh rate, and full achievement support. 
GoldenEye 007 is coming to Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One as part of Game Pass. Everyone who already owns Rare Replay will also be able to download the game at no additional cost. We don&#x27;t know exactly when GoldenEye 007 arrives on Xbox, but according to Rare, the game will land simultaneously on Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch Online.</span>

                              <span>I never thought I would write these words: I&#x27;m leaving Game Informer.
For nearly 30 years, I looked forward to each workday, eager to see what game news would break, what I would be writing about, and on the best days, what I would be playing. In the time it took to create 330 monthly magazines, I was privileged to work alongside some of the most talented and amazing people I&#x27;ve ever met. For a kid who couldn’t get enough of video games growing up, I was living a dream. I knew how lucky I was and never took it for granted. I worked hard. I wanted Game Informer to be the place to go to celebrate games. I think we accomplished that tenfold and have created an outlet unlike any other.
In the weeks ahead, I’ll transition from writing game news to creating it. I’m entering the world of game dev…</span>

                              <span>We&#x27;re rapidly approaching the midway point for Mario Kart 8 Deluxe&#x27;s Booster Course Pass content. With two of the six promised waves of new courses already out, Nintendo has begun teasing what players can expect with the third wave, which is due out this holiday season. During today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct, we learned the first two courses coming in the third eight-course wave of new tracks.
Fittingly, the first course we learned about for Wave 3 of the Booster Course Pass is Merry Mountain. This holiday-themed track first made its debut in Mario Kart Tour in 2020 as part of the Winter Tour. Meanwhile, for those looking for something not holiday-themed, Nintendo is also bringing Peach Gardens, a track that first appeared in Mario Kart DS in 2005.
Wave 1 brought fan favorites like Coconut Mall (Wii), Choco Mountain (N64), and Sky Garden (GBA), while Wave 2 gave us access to tracks like Kalimari Desert (N64), Mario Circuit 3 (SNES), and Mushroom Gorge (Wii). Each wave has also given us two tracks from Mario Kart Tour, with Wave 2 also including an all-new course in Sky-High Sundae. 
Mario Kart 8 Deluxe – Booster Course Pass Wave 3 is scheduled to arrive this holiday season.</span>

                              <span>In the lead-up to Nintendo Switch Sports, Nintendo promised two major free updates following the launch. The first free update, which came out earlier this summer, added the ability to use the leg strap accessory for entire soccer matches instead of just shootouts. The second, more anticipated free update is set to add a new playable sport to the package: golf. Originally set for release this fall, Nintendo today announced a small delay to the update, saying it now arrives this holiday season.
The Nintendo Switch Sports version of golf lets you tee up across 21 holes carried over from the Wii Sports series. You can play locally with other players or hit the links with up to eight players online in the new Survival Golf mode. In Survival Golf, whoever takes the most strokes each round is eliminated.
This free update to Nintendo Switch Sports arrives this holiday season. For more about Nintendo Switch Sports, you can check out our full review here.</span>

In The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, players can explore the surface of the version of Hyrule they traveled across in Breath of the Wild as well as various floating islands in the sky. In the new trailer, we see Link go from the sky to the surface, then from the surface to the sky.
There&#x27;s still so much we don&#x27;t know about Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, but in addition to the official name, we also now have a release date. The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingom arrives exclusively on Nintendo Switch on May 12, 2023.</span>

                              <span>Dauntless developer Phoneix Labs has announced a new title that, needless to say, is dramatically different than its monster-slaying RPG. Fae Farm is a cozy life simulation that whisks players to a world of magic and wonder where you&#x27;ll flex your green thumb as a farming savior. 


As the name suggests, the bulk of the experience involves running a farm as an adventurer and newcomer to a community in the land of Azoria. Though you’ll work to bring peace to this troubled land, you’ll also kick back and leisurely explore various environments, collect resources, and build homesteads. Fae Farm is built with cooperation in mind. The title features drop-in/drop-out co-op, both locally and online, allowing players to farm and quest together. 
“With Fae Farm we wanted to take our favorite elements of the sim genres we love, infuse them with magic and beautiful art, and wrap everything in a light-hearted cooperative experience,” said creative director Katie De Sousa in a press release. “I can’t wait to see what kind of cozy homesteads players build in Azoria.”
Fae Farm is slated to release during Q2 2023 exclusively for Switch.</span>

                              <span>Today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct was loaded with surprises, including an enhanced port of the 2011 Wii game, Kirby&#x27;s Return to Dream Land. On this colorful adventure, Kirby uses a variety of copy abilities to solve puzzles and platforming challenges. These abilities, like a sword and whip, can also be used for combat encounters. This updated version of the game also includes a new Mecha ability, which adds long-range rockets, a close-range dash, and a mighty blast to the arsenal.
Up to four people can play cooperatively using Joy-Cons on the same system. Multiplayer is also available in the expanded minigame collection, giving players a new challenge called Magolor&#x27;s Tome Trackers.
Kirby&#x27;s Return to Dream Land Deluxe launches exclusively on Switch on February 24, 2023. Preorders begin today.</span>

                              <span>Capcom is bringing its best horror games to Nintendo Switch later this year via the handheld&#x27;s cloud gaming capabilities. Resident Evil Village, Resident Evil 7: Biohazard and the recent remakes of Resident Evil 2 and 3 will all be available on the eShop before the end of 2022. While we don&#x27;t know every game&#x27;s exact release date, Capcom announced that Resident Evil Village Cloud is launching on October 28. Additionally, a free demo of Village will be available later today on the Switch eShop if you&#x27;d like to test the quality of the cloud version yourself. 
This release coincides with the global launch of the Resident Evil Village Winter&#x27;s Expansion, which introduces new story content surrounding the protagonist&#x27;s daughter, which is also arriving on October 28. However, the expansion won&#x27;t be available to play on the Nintendo Switch cloud until December 2.</span>

                              <span>I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m writing this: Pikmin 4 is real, and it&#x27;s out next year. 
Let&#x27;s get right to it – check out the official Pikmin 4 announcement trailer below: 


Here&#x27;s what Nintendo had to say about Pikmin 4 in a press release following today&#x27;s reveal: 
 
Pikmin franchise revealed a tranquil park and a napping Bulborb, but it was still missing one important element … Pikmin! Where could they be? More details about this new title for Nintendo Switch will be revealed ahead of its 2023 launch.&quot;

 
Pikmin is a very special franchise to many people, but despite its niche popularity, it&#x27;s never quite reached the heights of other Nintendo franchises. In total, the franchise has sold more than 8 million copies. Pikmin 3 Deluxe on Switch proved the franchise still had some (fruit) juice in it by selling roughly 2 million units in less than a year – a quarter of the series&#x27; entire sales – and fans speculated this had proved to Nintendo that it was time for a proper sequel. 
Pikmin 4 was mentioned by series creator Shigeru Miyamoto back in 2015 when he told Eurogamer that it was in development and &quot;very close to completion.&quot; Time passed and then Hey! Pikmin, a 2D Pikmin spinoff, was announced and then released in July of 2017. Some speculated that this was the Pikmin 4 Miyamoto was referring to back in 2015 but in June of that year, Miyamoto told Eurogamer that &quot;it is progressing,&quot; seemingly confirming that he did not view Hey! Pikmin as the fourth sequel. Unfortunately, that was the last Nintendo or anyone there referred to Pikmin 4...until today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct!

Nintendo showcased a short and sweet teaser trailer that gave us more of the luscious world of Pikmin before flashing to a title screen that revealed Pikmin 4 is coming to Switch next year. As for exactly when, that remains unknown  – Nintendo simply stated 2023. But hey, that&#x27;s better than wondering when, if ever, Pikmin 4 would actually come out!

                              <span>Square Enix has announced Theatrhythm Final Bar Line, the next entry in the Final Fantasy rhythm series. This first console entry in the series includes modernized visuals for the backgrounds and nearly 400 songs included in the base game.
The soundtrack includes favorites like &quot;One Winged Angel,&quot; &quot;Torn from the Heavens,&quot; &quot;Suteki Da Ne,&quot; and plenty more. With 385 songs included in the base game, Square Enix understands it might be difficult to sort through them all, so it included a way to sort by game. The game can be enjoyed by two players locally or four players online.


Theatrhythm Final Bar Line comes to PlayStation 4 and Switch on February 16. Square Enix also announced that players can look forward to paid DLC from the Saga, Nier, Octopath Traveler, and Live A Live series for a total of 90 additional songs. There&#x27;s also a Season Pass which will add 27 extra songs.</span>

More specifically, the first post-launch Splatfest will begin at 5 p.m. PT/8 p.m. ET, on Sept. 23 and end at 5 p.m. PT/8 p.m. ET on Sept. 25. As for what we&#x27;ll be fighting for, you can choose to be on team Gear, Grub, of Fun (in regards to what you&#x27;d bring with you to a deserted island). It should be a great time if the pre-launch Splatfest held recently is any indication.
Check out the Splatfest trailer for yourself below: 


The trailer above also reveals that some additional Splatoon 3 updates are on the way, too, although it stopped short of telling us exactly what to expect.

Fire Emblem Engage: Divine Edition, a physical collector&#x27;s copy of the game, features unique box art, a logo-less steelbook, art cards, a sizable art book, and a copy of the game.</span>

                              <span>On November 4, Hazelight and Electronic Arts&#x27; It Takes Two launches on Switch. This heartwarming adventure originally released in 2021 on PC and PlayStation and Xbox consoles. It received a 9.25 out of 10 review from Game Informer and also won The Game Awards&#x27; 2021&#x27;s Game of the Year honors.
It Takes Two can only be played cooperatively and can either be played on a single Switch via splitscreen or on two Switches via local wireless or online via the free friend&#x27;s pass.
In my review of the Xbox One version, I said &quot;It Takes Two may not be the platforming juggernaut that it aspires to be, but it more than makes up for it with its big heart, wealth in variety, and gorgeous imagery. All of its individual actions are things we’ve done in other games, but when applied to this distinct cooperative approach, they take on a whole new life and are used in wonderful ways over a long adventure. The action will have you laughing and screaming at your TV, and the story stays strong throughout, creating the backbone for an entertaining adventure that roars with excitement and should keep you glued to the controller to see if this couple’s lost love can be rekindled.&quot;

                              <span>Nintendo has revealed Octopath Traveler II, a sequel to 2018&#x27;s Octopath Sequel, and it&#x27;s out next year.
The first game in the series, Octopath Traveler, was released exclusively on Switch in 2018 before making its way to PC the following year, Stadia in 2020, and finally, Xbox One in 2021. It seems Nintendo is ready to take us back to that world and its excellent HD-2D visual style because it announced Octopath Traveler II is coming to Switch February 24, 2023. 
You can check out the reveal trailer below:


As you can see, Octopath Traveler II is looking great, as expected. Rather than picking up with our previous heroes, this sequel presents us with eight new travelers: the warrior Hikari, the dancer Agnea, the merchant Partitio, the scholar Osvald, the thief Throné, the cleric Temenos, t…</span>

                              <span>Cyberpunk 2077 is having a bit of a resurgence at the moment. CD Projekt Red&#x27;s 2077 anime, Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, developed by Studio Trigger and Netflix is out (as of today!) and the Phantom Liberty expansion for the game is due out next year. While Phantom Liberty has been confirmed to be 2077&#x27;s first and only expansion, it seems CDPR is not yet ready to part with this world. 
During the CD Projekt Group H1 2022 earnings call, CDPR&#x27;s vice president of business development Michał Nowakowski said the studio is committed to doing more with this IP, as reported by IGN. 


&quot;We decided to develop one major expansion for Cyberpunk, which is going to take advantage of all the capabilities of the new-gen consoles,&quot; Nowakowski said during the call. &quot;Having said that, we&#x27;re totally, fully committed to developing the Cyberpunk IP further, beyond this particular Cyberpunk expansion. We&#x27;ve put a lot of effort and time into building this franchise and we definitely want to continue to build upon what was built right now – with new stories, new experiences, new content, basically. Not just the video game format...in terms of expansions, there&#x27;s just going to be one major expansion. However, there&#x27;s going to be new stuff in the future.&quot; 
As for what exactly, only time will tell but considering a Cyberpunk 2077 anime is already out, perhaps the studio is looking to dive more into the entertainment medium with this IP. As IGN notes, there&#x27;s also The Molasses Flood, a Boston-based studio that CDPR acquired earlier this year, which is working on an existing CDPR IP. This could be something related to The Witcher, of course, but perhaps it&#x27;s something related to 2077. 
In the meantime, read about why now is the right time to play Cyberpunk 2077 and then read about what to expect in next year&#x27;s Phantom Liberty expansion.

                              <span>Developer Platinum Games and publisher Square Enix have revealed that Babylon&#x27;s Fall will shut down next year, less than a full year after its March 3 launch this year. 
More specifically, Platinum Games will terminate the game&#x27;s service on February 27, 2023. As for why, the team didn&#x27;t really outline the reason but it&#x27;s likely due to the game&#x27;s poorly received launch and its lack of players since then. Square Enix tried to remedy the game&#x27;s issues by sending players a survey asking them how the team can improve the game and shortly after, Platinum Games said it has &quot;no plans to reduce the scale of development on Babylon&#x27;s Fall.&quot; It seems things have changed because Babylon&#x27;s Fall will fall early next year.

                              <span>Hot on the heels of the announcement of a long-awaited Nintendo Direct, PlayStation announced that tomorrow will also feature a special livestreamed presentation of its own. Now, in addition to that aforementioned Nintendo Direct tomorrow morning, we&#x27;re now also receiving a PlayStation State of Play stream in the afternoon.
The news comes as Tokyo Game Show looms, giving publishers a massive convention to piggyback off of.

Tomorrow&#x27;s presentation is set to last approximately 20 minutes and will feature new updates and gameplay footage from 10 games across PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation VR2.
This PlayStation State of Play stream is set for tomorrow, September 13 at 3 p.m. Pacific/6 p.m. Eastern. You can watch it live on PlayStation&#x27;s Twitch and YouTube channels. Of course, if you miss the show, we&#x27;ll have all the biggest announcements covered right here on Game Informer.</span>

                              <span>Adventure platformer Little Orpheus was meant to launch on PC back in March but was delayed at the last minute. At the time, the announcement said the decision to delay was taken &quot;in light of recent events&quot;, referencing without directly naming the Russian invasion of Ukraine. 

Well, as of today, Little Orpheus, which is a scifi adventure about a Soviet cosmonaut in 1962, has been released.

                              <span>One of the best developments in PC gaming over the past five years has been the arrival of the entire, silly, joyous Yakuza series on our platform. Well, now it looks like Yakuza&#x27;s detective agency spin-offs are also heading to PC, as 2018&#x27;s Judgment and 2021&#x27;s Lost Judgment have both received an ESRB rating for &quot;Windows PC&quot;.

                              <span>The XIII remake, when it was released in 2020, was a disaster. Players complained of poor AI, bugs, missing multiplayer and an art style that abandoned the iconic, cel-shaded look of the original. After almost two years of further work by a different developer, the remake of the XIII remake is now live.

                              <span>I only just realised, while mentioning the dev&#x27;s next game, that we never posted about excellent indie horror game Mothered. Not to be confused with the unrelated Remothered games, it&#x27;s the tale of a young girl returning home after surgery to find everything is weird and her mother is some sort of eerie mannequin. It might be my favourite horror game of 2021? Now&#x27;s a good time to raise Mothered because: 1) it finally has a demo for newcomers; 2) for veterans, that demo actually hides a secret expansion continuing the game&#x27;s story.

The announcement was buried amongst a whole bundle of other JRPG information from today’s Nintendo Direct broadcast. You’ll have to make do with the Switch trailer below for now, I’m afraid, because Squeenix haven’t released a PC one yet.

The game had struggled to make an impact since its launch on March 3rd earlier this year, with concurrent player counts dropping to zero at times. It hadn&#x27;t looked good from the early days when, as we pointed out, Platinum Games were tweeting statements that Babylon’s Fall’s wasn’t &quot;in danger&quot; just two weeks following its launch.

Ross said her departure was due to a “family medical issue” in a statement shared on her Twitter account. She’d been at the company since it was established in 2007.

                              <span>The next EA Original has been announced, and it’s coming from Koei Tecmo and Omega Force, developers of the Dynasty Warriors series. Set in Japan during its feudal period but with a fantasy twist, EA and Koei Tecmo describe the as-yet-untitled project as “the next great hunting game”. Dispel those mental images of theHunter: Call Of The Wild and Big Buck Hunter though, because it sounds like this is more in the vein of hack-and-slash monster hunting shenanigans.

Unlike the mere low-res images of abandoned Steam Deck designs we’ve already seen, however, these were mostly functional PC gaming machines. That’s according to Valve engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais, who shared a video of an early, more rounded-looking Deck booting to SteamOS and loading up Half-Life 2.

                              <span>Correctly striking a succession of notes in a rhythm game gives me a huge high, but I&#x27;m more familiar with feeling the corresponding low. A succession of missed notes whizzing past sounds like an ode to my failure, and in mashups that mix demanding rhythms with another genre - like Crypt Of The Necrodancer, say - these reminders of my musical inadequacy often drown out even the simplest pleasures. 

Often but not always. Metal: Hellsinger&#x27;s mix of rhythm game and Doom 2016-style shooter kept me tapping my foot as I battled through hell - even as I failed regularly, and even as someone who doesn&#x27;t care for metal music.

Remember when we just had E3? Essentially a fortnight of reveals, updates, and surprises as they relate to all things gaming? Well, today, E3 is now 12 months long... And it&#x27;s not called E3 anymore. And E3 isn&#x27;t even involved. Is this better, or is this worse? I guess it&#x27;s just a matter of perspective... Where was I?
Ah yes, here on Destructoid, and welcoming you, our beloved community to today&#x27;s surprise PlayStation State of Play presentation, dropped upon us with less than 24 hours&#x27; notice, and ready to rock our worlds with 20 minutes of news and updates pertaining to several titles headed to platforms PS4, PS5, and PSVR2. While Sony is tight-lipped on the content of today&#x27;s stream, we can expect around 10 games in all — and given the relative shortness of the show, it&#x27;s probably gonna be a bit of a trailer fest.
And so, we&#x27;d like you all to join us for the State of Play, which kicks off 30 minutes from now. We will, as always, be bringing you all of the hot news right here on site, but it&#x27;s always fun to sit in the peanut gallery and offer your thoughts on Sony&#x27;s reveals. What&#x27;s coming? FromSoft news? A new Street Fighter 6 character reveal? The Callisto Protocol release date? Blood &amp; Truth 2?
There&#x27;s only one way to find out.

There were an awful lot of games revealed and updated during today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct presentation. And while the heavy hitters of the show–your Zeldas, your Fire Emblems–will be headline acts for weeks to come, it was one of the smaller announcements that has me more excited than anything else: Story of Seasons: A Wonderful Life. Originally released for the Nintendo GameCube as Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life, the game was unique for its use of chapters to tell the story of your farmer&#x27;s life on the land. Characters age and die, and your child can be raised from an infant to an adult where they can take over the reins of the farm. It&#x27;s perhaps the best storytelling the Story of Seasons series has seen, presenting your character&#x27;s life on the farm as more t…</span>

                              <span>An obvious Steam Deck candidate
It&#x27;s been a stellar year for strategy games, and now one is making the leap from Switch to PC. Triangle Strategy is coming to Steam on October 13.
Square Enix announced the port today, amid all the news blasting out during and just after the Nintendo Direct. The Steam port rolls in with two options: a $59.99 base game (currently at a 10% discount) or a $64.99 digital deluxe that comes with a digital artbook. You can also opt to bundle a Triangle Strategy purchase with the newly ported Various Daylife, if you need more than just one RPG in your near future.
Triangle Strategy is a strategy RPG from Square Enix and Artdink, that takes very much after its genre predecessors. It follows Serenoa Wolffort, the heir-to-be of a house caught in the tensions between several nations.

If you&#x27;re in the market for a strategy RPG with some political tension and interesting choices, Triangle Strategy is very much up your alley. It&#x27;s also got a classic approach to tactics that reminded me of both Tactics Ogre and Final Fantasy Tactics when I was playing it.

Choose your own path
Triangle Strategy has a fantastic combat system and set of classes, with every character bringing their own twist to the lineup. There are multiple paths and a &quot;golden route&quot; to unlock as well. It seems like a great strategy RPG to pick up for Steam Deck users (fingers crossed it gets Verified status as soon as possible).
In my review, my only shortcomings centered on the dialogue and story pacing, which can wear on a bit. Otherwise, if you&#x27;re someone seeking tactics on the PC, there&#x27;s no reason not to eye Triangle Strategy. And please, oh please, let&#x27;s see some sick mods for this one too.
Triangle Strategy hits Steam on October 13.

                              <span>Following the launch of PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, multiple video game publishers bumped up the price of new-gen versions of some of their games. While Ubisoft resisted that trend to this point, CEO Yves Guillemot tells Axios in an exclusive interview that it is making $70 the standard price for bigger triple-A experiences published by the company. 
We already knew that the new-gen versions of Ubisoft&#x27;s long-in-development pirate game, Skull and Bones, would retail for $70, but now it appears to be the start of the standard pricing for Ubisoft. In that interview with Axios, Guillemot stated that &quot;Some of the games will come at the same price as the competition. The big AAA games will come at $70.&quot; 
In 2020, Ubisoft CTO Frédérick Duguet said that games released in 2020 would not reach the $70 mark (and they didn&#x27;t, outside of special editions). Then, last year, Duguet said, &quot;In terms of pricing, we&#x27;ve been analyzing the competitive dynamics of the past quarter, and we are still looking at new opportunities, but we have not made any decision yet.&quot; Today&#x27;s Axios interview with Guillemot is the first indication that Ubisoft has come to an official decision regarding its pricing.
Ubisoft is far from the only gaming company increasing prices. Publishers like 2K Games, Activision, and Sony have been selling select games for $70 since the introduction of the new consoles in 2020. Meanwhile, just last month, PlayStation announced it was raising the price of its PlayStation 5 consoles in select, non-U.S. markets. Skull and Bones, the first $70 Ubisoft title, is set to launch on November 8. It&#x27;s worth noting that new-gen versions of Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage are currently listed on retailer websites for $50.
You can read the full interview with Guillemot, which touches on subjects like the Ubisoft&#x27;s troubled workplace culture, the company&#x27;s current approach to NFTs following Ghost Recon Breakpoint&#x27;s integration of them, and plenty more here.</span>

                              <span>When Danny Peña was a child, he would spend hours playing games at his local New York arcade before he received his first console, an Atari 2600, from his grandmother. Peña knew early on that he wanted to do something in the games industry, but he didn&#x27;t know what. All along the way, he was told that video games won&#x27;t pay the bills, but he didn&#x27;t let that deter him. Flash forward a couple of decades, and Peña returned to New York to show his mother a billboard featuring his face in Times Square – a monument to his success in the games industry, but not one that was easy to achieve. Now, with a new children&#x27;s book called Danny Loves Video Games about his life and career set to release this week, I sat down with Peña to chat about his road to this point.

The news comes by way of Ross&#x27; Twitter account, which mentions that she wished to stay with Halo until the upcoming Winter Update, but she is leaving the studio amid a family medical issue. 
Since the studio&#x27;s founding in 2007 under Ross, 343 Industries has worked on several Halo games, including Halo 4, Halo: The Master Chief Collection, Halo 5: Guardians, and Halo Infinite. The studio fully took over the Halo franchise following Bungie&#x27;s departure from the brand after 2010&#x27;s Halo: Reach. Ross oversaw the Halo franchise for Microsoft and Xbox ever since.

Metal: Hellsinger knows precisely what it is from the second it begins: a love letter to fast-paced first-person shooters, especially Doom, and a tribute to metal music and the culture surrounding it. It’s a no-frills shooter that asks, “What if you had to blow bodies to pieces to the beat of a metal album made by genre greats?” It excels at answering that question. It’s not perfect – the bosses are uninspired at times, and it could use an extra dash of variety in combat design – but my criticisms mattered little to my overall enjoyment of my 1…</span>

                              <span>Nintendo has revealed that it will livestream a Nintendo Direct tomorrow.
More specifically, the Direct will begin at 7 a.m. PT/10 a.m. ET tomorrow, Sept. 13, and it will run for roughly 40 minutes. That&#x27;s one of the largest Directs of the year, so it will likely be jam-packed with new looks at previously announced games and new ones, too (perhaps a Zelda port or two, if rumors about this Direct are correct). As for what to expect, Nintendo says the Direct will &quot;mostly&quot; focus on Switch games launching this Winter. 
Tune in at 7 a.m. PT tomorrow, 9/13, for a #NintendoDirect livestream featuring roughly 40 minutes of information mostly focused on #NintendoSwitch games launching this winter.

The key word here is &quot;mostly&quot; because that leaves just enough room for Nintendo to discuss and/or announce games coming next year. Only time will tell, but fortunately, we don&#x27;t have to wait long because the Direct is less than 24 hours away. 
If you&#x27;re in the U.K., please see the tweet below: 
As a mark of respect during this period of national mourning, we will not livestream tomorrow’s Nintendo Direct. It will be published as a video-on-demand on our YouTube channel at 16:00 (UK time) tomorrow.

                              <span>Splatoon 3 is already shaping up to be another hit for the franchise and Nintendo. Selling 3.45 million copies since Friday in just Japan, Splatoon 3 had the best launch ever for a Switch game in Japan, as reported by Eurogamer. 
This includes both digital and physical sales. It&#x27;s safe to say the squid (and Octoling) community are off to a great start with the threequel that&#x27;s exclusive to Switch. According to Eurogamer, however, despite the game also being number one on the U.K. boxed charts, as reported by GamesIndustry.biz, overall launch sales are down 9% compared to Splatoon 2 there. The U.K.&#x27;s boxed chart only included physical games, though, so it&#x27;s possible that decline isn&#x27;t present when digital games are taken into account. There&#x27;s no word on how Splatoon 3 is fairing in the U.S., but it typically follows trends in the U.K. 


&quot;Nintendo Co., LTD...announced that domestic sales of the Splatoon 3 game for the Nintendo Switch system have surpassed 3.45 million units in the first three days since launch on September 9, 2022,&quot; a Nintendo press release reads. &quot;This is the highest domestic sales level for any Nintendo software within the first three days.&quot; 
It&#x27;s no surprise Splatoon 3 is selling well in Japan and elsewhere – it&#x27;s great! And you can read about why in the Game Informer Splatoon 3 review.

                              <span>Now that Ubuntu 22.10 is into its feature freeze and its Linux 5.19 based kernel landed as well as moving to the GCC 12.2 compiler, I&#x27;ve begun testing this forthcoming Ubuntu Linux (non-LTS) release on more systems. For the current-flagship Intel Xeon Platinum 8380 &quot;Ice Lake&quot; processors, Ubuntu 22.10 does deliver some performance advantages over the current Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS release. However, Ubuntu 22.10 still trails in a distance behind Intel&#x27;s own Clear Linux platform for the most aggressive out-of-the-box performance.</span>

                              <span>Fantasy action RPG Forspoken has been delayed more times than most games, although it’s finally pencilled in for a January release date. We’re still quite a way off from then, but Sony have released a smattering more gameplay footage today, detailing the moves you&#x27;ll be pulling as heroine Frey &quot;I&#x27;m seeing freaking dragons&quot; Holland. Alas, said footage has been crushed down to only a handful of GIFs over on the PlayStation Blog, but our friends at Eurogamer have a bigger, chunkier hands on preview that tells us more about why it won&#x27;t be mega cringe. Alas, we weren&#x27;t privy to this Forspoken demo, so have a watch with us below.

                              <span>I did a lot of talking at Gamescom, whether that be to developers or muttering to myself deliriously as I typed stuff up in the evening. Talking to devs especially is a wonderful thing, especially when you&#x27;re playing their game and it resonates with you. But getting hands-on with an early portion of American Arcadia rendered me virtually silent, to the point where I had to apologise to the devs for being so quiet.
And I wasn&#x27;t being rude; far from it! I was just so engrossed in the game&#x27;s mixture of side-scrolling platforming and first-person puzzling. Keep this under surveillance, because I think it&#x27;s going to be a real hit when it lands.

                              <span>Gloomwood is, so far, a very good game, but it is also not much of a game - in the literal sense that it has launched into early access incomplete. There&#x27;s currently just enough of it to play that it makes you feel both bereft and quite annoyed when it suddenly clangs its great iron doors shut in front of you. &quot;Let me in!!&quot; you scream, as you hammer on the silent portal. &quot;I really like Thief! I get you! I want to throw more decapitated heads as lures!&quot;
If you are one of those people who bases their gaming personality on liking the original Thief series, Gloomwood will have been on your radar for a while. It&#x27;s a grimy, steampunk-ish stealth immersive sim with a deliberate low-poly vibe, and it picks up the abandoned Thief football to absolutely run with it. But, though the current EA build is but short, it feels like Gloomwood is aiming to punt that ball into outer space. There&#x27;s so much more room to be playful and experiment than I expected, and it&#x27;s so much fun that if you&#x27;d never played a stealth sim in your life I&#x27;d recommend Gloomwood. Except I wouldn&#x27;t, because it feels like I&#x27;d be doing you a disservice to recommend it now, when the fun will be so quickly snatched away.

                              <span>It&#x27;s a very odd feeling, building a catapult all on your lonesome while watching fiery death rain down on your enemy&#x27;s castle in the valley below. I suspect it&#x27;s probably a similar experience to watching the carnage of Chivalry II play out from the safety of a nearby bench. The newly announced Warlander from Nier Replicant devs Toylogic certainly has the medieval setting in common with Torn Banner Studio&#x27;s first-person hack and slash, but this free-to-play multiplayer warfare game is an altogether different beast. You control your warriors in third-person, for starters, and its more cartoonish visuals allow for, well, daft cataclysmic events like a flaming meteor shower to hone in on a player&#x27;s position without appearing completely over the top. As it prepares to enter its first open beta later today, September 12th, I went hands on with a brief demo build to see what it was all about.

                              <span>&quot;Oh, come on!&quot; is a phrase you hear a lot in Sunday Gold. It&#x27;s often uttered by your knuckle-dusting healer Sally, and is invariably followed up by, &quot;You havin&#x27; a laugh, mate?&quot; and &quot;Facking hell!&quot; - partly because Sally is from Laaaandan and is thus obligated to speak lik&#x27; tha&#x27;, innit (because how else would you know this is a game set in Laaaandan), but also because the thugs, security guards and cybernetic dogs she&#x27;s often fighting in this seedy tale of corporate dystopia are some of the most frustrating enemies known to video games. The type who are seemingly resistant to every single weapon type in your arsenal, or who invariably have big, scripted healing sequences just when you&#x27;re about to nail &#x27;em. 
It&#x27;s a phrase I often found myself echoing while playing Sunday Gold for review, too, both during its tedious, war of attrition-style turn-based battles, and while trying to figure out some of its more obtuse puzzles. BKOM Studios have tried to fuse one too many things together in Sunday Gold, and the result is a messy, somewhat artificial blend of Deathloop&#x27;s style, Invisible Inc&#x27;s tension and a more action-led focus on the cerebral role-playing of Disco Elysium. There&#x27;s still much to admire in its stylish visuals and atmospheric music, but I also haven&#x27;t been this cross playing a video game since Felix The Reaper, and that&#x27;s saying something.

                              <span>Ubisoft’s subscription service doesn’t have the user-base of something like Microsoft’s Game Pass. Now, it seems, the French publishers are hoping that plonking in some indie games among its multitudes of Assassin’s Creeds and Tom Clancy shooters will attract a more varied clientele. They’re also running a free trial period for Ubisoft+ until October 10th, including for lapsed subscribers, so that’s something.

Hey, I’m not knocking it, and I’ll even put together this guide that early Black Friday birds might find useful. I just don’t even think of what I want for dinner later.

Pokud nemůžete nastavit PL1 a PL2 v Biosu, v Linuxu je možné použít powercap-utils a rozhraní Intel RAPL (Running Average Power Limit). PL1 a PL2 jde přečíst pomocí powercap-info a zapsat pomocí  powercap-set.</span>

                              <span>Despite broad public protests, Cloudflare initially declined to cut its ties with Kiwi Farms. When death threats came into play, the company quickly changed its position. The removal of Kiwi Farms will likely increase calls for voluntary curation of the web, and may reach way beyond Cloudflare. Domain registrars, registries, and ISPs may actually be better targets. What could possibly go wrong?

                              <span>Sony have been regularly releasing games on PC for a while now, with an often quick turnaround between &#x27;announcement&#x27; and &#x27;it&#x27;s out now&#x27;. The exception is the Uncharted: Legacy Of Thieves Collection, which was confirmed for PC back in September 2021 but which still hasn&#x27;t arrived.

It seems like that will change soon. A recent, hastily-removed update to the collection&#x27;s Epic Games Store page declared that it would release on October 19th.

These are where you&#x27;ll send your handheld PC if it develops a problem, either so Valve can fix it free-of-charge if it&#x27;s still under warranty, or so they can diagnose the problem and quote you a repair price if it&#x27;s not. &quot;If your dog gnaws on your thumbstick and breaks it, this is not covered by warranty,&quot; say Valve.

It&#x27;s not going to be quite the massive open world adventure &#x27;em up that the last few entries have been (don&#x27;t worry; one of those is on the way as well), but a more classic AssCreed experience to mark the series&#x27; 15th anniversary. This milestone has made me realise that the Creedsperience has taken up almost half of my current lifespan. Or, to put it another way, I fear that playing Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage may induce a pathetic but very real existential crisis in me.

                              <span>A not-insignificant part of the Ubisoft Forward livestream tonight was dedicated to Assassin&#x27;s Creed. To celebrate the doughty action-adventure&#x27;s 15th anniversary, senior community developer Alice Terrett was joined by a, to his credit, very excited Danny &quot;it&#x27;s the Daddy&quot; Wallace, to lay out an almost MCU-like timeline of every Assassin&#x27;s Creed thing happening for the next good while. It includes new DLC for Valhalla, and a mysterious horror-ish tease. But top of the list, after next year&#x27;s more trad and compact Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage, is Assassin&#x27;s Creed: Codename Red, the next big flagship open-world RPG for the series. And it&#x27;s set in feudal Japan.

                              <span>About a year ago we learned about the existence of something called Assassin&#x27;s Creed Infinity (or, more precisely, Project Infinity, but we&#x27;re all just calling it Infinity). The suggestion that Assassin&#x27;s Creed might become a live service online game akin to Fortnite was quite upsetting to me. Thankfully, VP executive producer on Assassin&#x27;s Creed Marc-Alexis Côté (aka MAC) appeared on tonight&#x27;s Ubisoft Forward livestream to explain more about Infinity, and I am slightly less alarmed but no less confused. Rather than a game, MAC says that Infinity is &quot;going to be the single entry point for our fans into the Assassin&#x27;s Creed franchise in the future&quot;.

As you may have guessed from the title of this post, it&#x27;s also on sale at Amazon for a very reasonable price: £59 gets you a 500GB model compared to a UK RRP of £101.

I don&#x27;t miss those 5am sunrises either. So we can surely all agree that the sensible course of action would be to lock sunrise to 7:30am and rotate the whole clock around that. Anyway!

                              <span>Today&#x27;s Ubisoft Forward was mostly about Assassin&#x27;s Creed, and it had a lot to talk about. There were new games announced, further details about Mirage released, and so much more. 
Here&#x27;s Every Assassin&#x27;s Creed Announcement
Let&#x27;s take it from the top, shall we? 
Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage
This game was officially revealed last week following extensive leaks, and as expected, Ubisoft had a lot more to share about it during today&#x27;s Ubisoft Forward showcase. Basim Ibn Ishaq, the master assassin from Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla, is taking the lead role this time, but he&#x27;ll be much younger. This game follows his journey from a thief on the luscious and diverse streets of Golden Age Baghdad in 861 to an apprentice of the Hidden Ones to a master assassin. It also represents a return to the series&#x27; roo…</span>

                              <span>Following numerous leaks over the previous few weeks, Ubisoft officially revealed that Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage is real. As expected, Ubisoft revealed a lot more about Mirage during today&#x27;s Ubisoft Forward showcase, including the game&#x27;s protagonist, setting, and more. 
If you&#x27;ve been paying attention to leaks and rumors, you likely already had a good idea of what Mirage will be, doubly so after today&#x27;s presentation. Basim Ibn Ishaq, the master assassin from Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla, is in the lead role this time around. However, he&#x27;s not the polished warrior you might remember him as because Mirage takes place years before Valhalla. In this game, he&#x27;s a young thief, and his playground is the luscious and diverse streets of Baghdad, Iraq. Set in 861, a period when Baghdad was the epicenter …</span>

                              <span>Ubisoft and Netflix have announced an expansion of their partnership that was first announced in 2020 with a live-action Assassin&#x27;s Creed series that is still on the way and the Rabbids Invasion: Mission to Mars movie that arrived on the service earlier this year. Today, we learned that Netflix subscribers will have exclusive access to three upcoming Ubisoft mobile games as a part of their existing memberships, with no ads or microtransactions. This announcement comes as Netflix prepares to enter the gaming space with its first releases later this year.
First up, is a sequel to Valiant Hearts, a World War I puzzle-adventure. This new title is in development by the team behind the first game and will bring a new story exclusively to Netflix members in January 2023. That same year, a sequel to Mighty Quest, the roguelite hack and slash, will arrive for subscribers. Finally, Ubisoft is currently working on a new, original Assassin&#x27;s Creed mobile title, which, again, will be available exclusively to Netflix subscribers.
In addition to the Assassin&#x27;s Creed live-action series, Ubisoft and Netflix are currently collaborating on three animated series: Captain Laserhawk: Blood Dragon Remix, Far Cry, and Splinter Cell. While Netflix is set to enter the games industry later this year, we&#x27;ll have to wait until at least next year to experience these three new mobile titles for Netflix subscribers.</span>

                              <span>Huge reveals in video games, movies, and TV are currently unfolding at D23 Expo, Disney&#x27;s annual consumer show held in Anaheim, California. Yesterday we received our first looks at an unnamed Marvel game, a new Tron title, and Mickey Mouse and crew teaming up in a platformer. Today, Marvel and Lucasfilm unloaded a flurry of announcements and trailers for projects hitting in 2022 and beyond.
On the Marvel Cinematic Universe front, we learned Fantastic Four will be directed by Matt Shakman, who worked on Wandavision and It&#x27;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia. Dominique Thorne&#x27;s Ironheart will take on the villain The Hood (brought to life by Anthony Ramos) in the Ironheart Disney Plus series. Sam Wilson&#x27;s first mission as Captain America in New World Order will be against The Leader, with Tim Blake reprising this role 14 years after 2008&#x27;s The Incredible Hulk.
We also learned who the Thunderbolts are in the forthcoming film. The team consists of anti-heroes Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh), Taskmaster (Olga Kurylenko), Valentina (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), Red Guardian (David Harbour), U.S. Agent (Wyatt Russell), Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen, and Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan).
Marvel also treated us to our first looks at Secret Invasion, starring Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury and Emilia Clarke in an unknown role. And in just one month, we can watch the classicly designed horror film Werewolf by Night on Disney Plus. You can see both trailers below.
The Star Wars news is a bit lighter, consisting of our first look at The Mandalorian&#x27;s third season, which looks absolutely bonkers in the best way. We also got a glimpse of the animated anthology Tales of the Jedi, hitting on October 26. The Bad Batch&#x27;s second season hits on January 4, yet no new footage was shown. Andor also received a new trailer for the first season hitting in 11 days. The second season&#x27;s filming is already underway! Again, you can see all of the Star Wars trailers below.

                              <span>During today&#x27;s Ubisoft Forward presentation, the publisher showed off new footage of a boss battle in Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope. The crossover game, which combines the iconic Mushroom Kingdom crew with the zany Rabbids, looks to expand in the first 2017 turn-based tactical game in the series, Kingdom Battle, in myriad ways, including the new Sparks that can add various buffs to the heroes and debuffs to the villains.


This time around, we got a look at battles on a train, including Bowser joining the team. The battle takes place on the train as the crew tries to cleanse an angered Wiggler of corrupted darkness eyes as it runs alongside the train. Ubisoft also announced that it has post-launch plans including free DLC with the third content drop introducing a new playable hero: Rayman.
Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope comes exclusively to Switch on October 20.</span>

                              <span>In the world of Marvel Comics, the word &quot;ensemble&quot; invokes thoughts of the Avengers, X-Men, or Fantastic Four. Recently, we learned Skydance New Media and Marvel Entertainment were working on an ensemble Marvel video game. The internet&#x27;s rumor mill believed this game would focus on Reed Richards and his fantastic family. Yesterday, during the Disney &amp; Marvel Games Showcase, we learned this ensemble wasn&#x27;t Fantastic Four, Avengers, or any known Marvel team whatsoever. Skydance is creating its own team of four heroes, set to the backdrop of World War II.
The timeframe has Captain America front and center fighting against Hydra and Nazi troops. Through a narrative twist, Wakanda gets involved, and players gain control of Black Panther, but not the one you know. This Black Panther is Azzuri, T…</span>

                              <span>As previously announced, Amy Hennig&#x27;s game for Marvel was shown during this evening&#x27;s Disney games showcase. As was leaked, it&#x27;s about Captain America and Black Panther working to fight against Hydra during World War 2. What I didn&#x27;t expect at all was that the game still wouldn&#x27;t have a name, although there are a few other details to glean from the most teasery teaser trailer.

                              <span>For my money, if you want a story about a society set inside a computer, look to ReBoot. But I suppose Tron might satisfy, too. A new visual novel set in the neon universe called Tron: Identity was announced during this evening&#x27;s Disney &amp; Marvel games showcase, and it&#x27;s being developed by Bithell Games. There&#x27;s a very brief teaser trailer below.

Also, player-built factories, and several other features which should make players focused on the logistics of warfare very happy. There&#x27;s a new trailer below ahead of its release on September 28th.

Like everything, it&#x27;s also a roguelike, but it&#x27;s transparent and fair enough that I can reluctantly forgive that too, not least because I&#x27;ve found myself enjoying this one the more it went on. It&#x27;s a lighter, cheerier sibling of Into The Breach that&#x27;s half tactical fighter, half puzzler, and its default difficulty setting is close to perfect if you&#x27;re looking for something less intense that will still catch you out now and then.

That&#x27;s Betrayal At Club Low, the latest game from Cosmo D, set in the same strange city as Off-Peak, The Norwood Suite, and Tales From Off-Peak City. This time, it&#x27;s an honest-to-goodness RPG, full of skill checks, strange solutions, multiple endings, and so very many dice. And it&#x27;s great. And it has a demo.

Remember all the furore over Nier: Automata’s supposed secret church? Well, now you too can play the greatest trick the Internet ever pulled on people who enjoy Yoko Taro games a bit too much. SadFutago’s The Nier: Automata Church mod is finally ready to download from NexusMods.

                              <span>Despite lamenting the other week that the rest of 2022&#x27;s gaming calendar was looking a bit weak sauce after endless delay announcements, September is shaping up to be an absolutely monster month for indie releases right now. As Alice Bee noted earlier in the week, there are just too many cool, interesting games coming out for us to review effectively on the site at the moment (although rest assured, we will do our darnedest to cover as many of them as we can).
Part of the challenge is working out what&#x27;s worth reviewing, and what we think is worth highlighting for you, our readers. The other part, though, is often entirely selfish on our part, just playing and writing about cool games we like. In fact, the decision to review many of the games we covered this week - Railbound, Jack Move and Roadwarden - were all down to having played and liked some form of demo, making events like the Steam Next Fest an increasingly invaluable tool in helping us cut through the noise when we inevitably enter mega months like September.

                              <span>Overwatch 2 won’t be locking new heroes behind a paid battle pass, it’s emerged. Blizzard VP Jon Spector confirmed that heroes will be available through a free track for the battle pass. Spector’s comments were an attempt to put an end to speculation over what he described as “incomplete info” circulating online about Overwatch 2’s battle pass.

The game is alleged to star national superheroes Captain America and Wakanda’s Black Panther, and take place during World War 2. Skydance’s project is being headed up by former Uncharted director Amy Hennig, helmer of such unfortunately cancelled projects as Visceral&#x27;s Star Wars action-adventure.

Monsters, Inc. is represented with its own themed course that takes players throughout the corporate office and the department of doors. We also got to see Mike Wazowski, Randall, and Celia behind the wheel as playable racers, joining the previously announced Sulley, Mickey Mouse, Mulan, and Jack Sparrow. 


Disney Speestorm still has no release window, but it’s slated to launch on Switch and PC.</span>

While we didn&#x27;t get a name or release date, we did get a cinematic trailer from which we can try to extract information. The biggest news right out of the gate is that this game stars Black Panther, Captain America, and two additional heroes.
This new triple-A game takes place during World War II. As the camera pans over a table covered with things like a brochure for Paris and a flyer for a jazz performance, the items quickly take a turn for the insidious with things like a dagger, a pistol, documents, a hat featuring the Hydra insignia, and, finally, Captain America&#x27;s iconic shield scratched by what appears to be claws.

                              <span>Gargoyles is back! Well, sort of. The 1995 Sega Genesis side-scroller based on the beloved 90’s animated series is getting the remaster treatment, bringing Goliath and his team (much to their chagrin) back into the spotlight.
Unfortunately, the reveal didn’t come alongside a trailer, a list of platforms, or a release window. However, it sounds like we should expect a similar treatment that the Disney Classics Games Collection received. Those games were enhanced with high-res graphics, a rewind ability, a level skip, and art galleries showcasing concept sketches and other historical goodies. 
You can see the announcement at the 12:33 mark.</span>

The gameplay trailer offers a montage of tactical card-based combat, as well as choice-driven relationship building. Give it a watch below. 


We also got word that a series of animated shorts serve as a prequel to the game’s plot. The first episode arrives on October 31 on Marvel&#x27;s YouTube channel.


Firaxis previously announced Marvel’s Midnight Suns will have a staggered launch, so the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC versions will launch on December 2. Meanwhile, the Switch and last-gen versions hit sometime later.</span>

                              <span>Disney and Bithell Games have revealed Tron Identity, a new PC game coming to Steam sometime next year.

However, in an interview after the showcase, Bithell Games&#x27; Mike Bithell said the game takes place &quot;in a world where Flynn created an Ark, where Flynn created a second grid for them to go to, promising that he&#x27;d come back.&quot;

                              <span>This April, a coalition of entertainment companies convinced a judge to sign a pirate site blocking injunction that affected every ISP in the United States. This document was later found to be unenforceable but it was public access to court records that first pushed it into the public eye. As the case enters a new phase to block more domains, a level of secrecy had been requested by the plaintiffs.

                              <span>Do you ever feel like you&#x27;re sitting down with a game like a worried parent, saying &quot;I just don&#x27;t know what to do with you?&quot; Because that&#x27;s how I feel about Phoenix Point after the last few months of playing it on and off. I’ve definitely enjoyed it more than on its release in 2019, and its DLC adds more to think about and manage during what were once long lull periods. There&#x27;s a lot to like about its final form. There&#x27;s also a lot to... I don&#x27;t quite want to say hate, but I&#x27;m also not quite sure why. It&#x27;s one of the most evenly mixed bags I&#x27;ve ever rummaged around in.

AGDQ 2023 had originally been planned to take place in Florida, but that’s scrapped due to the state’s attitudes towards COVID-19 and LGBTQ+ people.

Not to worry, though, as myself and Nate are ever ready to hold down the fort. This week we&#x27;re talking about our favourite cinematics in video games, a fitting subject because last weekend I saw the greatest piece of cinema yet conceived by man: Michael Flatley&#x27;s Blackbird.
I do spend quite a lot of time explaining Blackbird to Nate, but after that we do talk about some cutscenes and cinematics in games (as well as litigating the difference between the two, and Nate tries to remember the first time he saw a cutscene in a game that was in-engine rather than being pre-rendered). And today the Cavern Of Lies is a Cavern Of Justice, after we received a troubling missive from one [squints] Brond Coatwear?

                              <span>I saw a panel of thriller authors a couple of months back and one of them made reference to &quot;the fat chapter&quot;, and the others all went &quot;Ohhhh, yes, the fat chapter!&quot;. Thriller writers deal in short, snappy chapters, and the fat chapter is the one that ends up getting a load of events or exposition shoved into it, somewhere in the second half, because they wouldn&#x27;t fit anywhere else. Every year in games there&#x27;s a fat month, where loads of games come out and loads of them look really good and there is never enough time godammit.
This year that month is September. There are so many games out this month that look so much my jam that I want to spread &#x27;em on my morning toast, but September is also the month that a lot of RPS staff have holiday booked - including me, for two weeks, which means that if these games do get reviewed it probably won&#x27;t be by me. But know that I have my beady little eyes on &#x27;em.

                              <span>Temtem’s inspiration has always been clear. We didn’t beat around the bush when it entered early access back in 2020 - Cian Maher called it the best Pokemon game in years - and I won’t beat around the bush now. It’s still the best Pokemon game in years. It borrows so much from Nintendo&#x27;s behemoth, but it also takes some much-needed lessons that Game Freak fails to recognise, taking the formula to its highest evolution yet.

                              <span>Monster-taming MMO Temtem just launched out of early access on PC earlier this week, but developers Crema have taken to Discord to defend the game’s paid battle pass. Some players have been getting themselves very worked up over the inclusion of a paid pass in a full-priced game. Yet there’s been a plan to include a battle pass in Temtem for years. Check out the game’s launch trailer below while you wrap your head around it all.

                              <span>It cannot be a coincidence that 1997 is a pivotal year in the world of Jack Move. In the game, it&#x27;s the year everything went dark in this turn-based Japanese-style RPG, with a solar storm biffing the world&#x27;s electronics. It threw the world into chaos, giving rise to the megacorps that now control the dystopian cyberpunk society where our heroine Noa is trying to make a living. In the real world, of course, 1997 was the year Final Fantasy VII came out, the seminal JRPG that Jack Move owes a great deal to (right down to its menu plink plink sound). Developers So Romantic have said outright that it&#x27;s been one of the main inspirations for Jack Move, and its shady corporate powers and grungy urban landscape certainly feel of a piece with ShinRa&#x27;s grip on the city of Midgar. 
But the bigwigs at MonoMind aren&#x27;t out to poison the world and suck the life from it in Jack Move. Instead, they&#x27;re more concerned with using their newfound technological powers to find eternal life – a classic &#x27;upload your mind to the metaverse&#x27; kind of tale you&#x27;ll probably recognise if you&#x27;ve read any of the cyberpunk 101 novels such as William Gibson&#x27;s Neuromancer or Permutation City by Greg Egan. Jack Move&#x27;s story doesn&#x27;t tread any new ground in this respect, but Noa and her hacker pal Ryder are a fiery spirited pair that make this six-hour tale of espionage and rebellion against its cartoonish villain well worth dipping into. Yes, you read that correctly. A JRPG you can polish off in a single day of play. Bliss.

                              <span>I keep thinking about Roadwarden like a tourist city that I visited for not quite long enough. Sure, I saw the main sights and had a great time soaking in the ambiance, but I know that I missed so many hidden gems. I want to go back and explore, maybe this time with a local guide who knows its secrets.
At its most basic, Roadwarden is a text-based RPG. You play as the titular roadwarden, who sets out from the city to investigate an unmapped peninsula with little more than their horse for company. Your goal as set by the people who sent you is to investigate the region and report your findings in preparation for the expansion of trade guilds in the area. But you can also set your own goal, shaping your character’s approach from the start in a way that helps with roleplaying a particular kind of adventurer throughout. And once you get to that adventuring, dozens of sidequests open up covering everything from gathering fruit to curing the plague.

                              <span>Every corner of Skyrim houses a locked chest, but where are all the keys? Only a handful actually have keys to open them. So do the chest&#x27;s owners lockpick them every time they want an apple or knife? Are these chests merely decorative, their contents deemed inaccessible and long forgotten? A new mod for Skyrim Special Edition answers this playfully by adding a load of hidden keys to unlock these chests. Some of the keys look quite well hidden in this object hunt, so you&#x27;ll need to poke around, rummage, and turn things over.

                              <span>When we last saw Amicia and Hugo de Rune at the end of A Plague Tale: Innocence back in 2019, things were looking up for the orphaned rat wranglers. They&#x27;d escaped the clutches of the French Inquisition and the hordes of plague rats following in their wake, and the pair were hopeful about finding a cure for the cursed macula flowing through Hugo&#x27;s veins.
Alas, when I pick up their journey in chapter six of Asobo&#x27;s upcoming sequel, A Plague Tale: Requiem, Amicia is having a particularly terrible time of it. Not only is she suffering from an open head wound, leaving her unsteady on her feet, but rumours are flying in the nearby pilgrim camp about something bad having gone down in the last city they passed through. Exactly what is hard to say with five chapters&#x27; worth of context missing from my preview build, but the pack of guards who are hot on the siblings&#x27; trail quickly make it plain: several men died back in that city, and they&#x27;re pointing the finger squarely at Amicia&#x27;s knife, slingshot and crossbow.

                              <span>Last time, you decided that a really big unreal place is better than going undercover. Good. Very good. Great deciding, reader dear. I&#x27;m wholly impartial, of course, but I am glad you haven&#x27;t forced me to come up with some contrived reason to jam a really big unreal place back into the running. We can continue. This week, it&#x27;s a question of jarring vs. juicy. What&#x27;s better: physics freakouts or beautiful food?

                              <span>The Hitman games are often good and usually fun, it’s fair to say, particularly the recent World Of Assassination trilogy. Ian Hitman’s turn in the two films released about his adventures has been rougher to recommend, though. That’s why it’s simultaneously disappointing and awesome to learn that Guardians Of The Galaxy, The Suicide Squad and – shudder – Slither director James Gunn narrowly missed his target when he pitched a Hitman movie.

                              <span>Third person skater shooter Rollerdrome has some really cool weapons, but what is it that makes them so special? I mean, there’s only four of them, and you’re forced to constantly perform tricks to regain ammo, which doesn&#x27;t make them easy to use. I think it’s because of their more literal significance in the game. Rollerdrome threatens you with multiple enemy types called Houseplayers, all formidable, especially in the heat of battle when they combine their efforts. Luckily, the four distinct weapons you’re equipped with act as an equaliser; each weapon is a solution for a particular enemy. Developers Roll7 could have easily added a bunch of copied and pasted guns from every generic shooter, but instead they were more intentional about the weapons they included, with each weapon complimenting the gunplay and the game as a whole.

This makes Rockstar’s cowboy epic/improvised teleconferencing software the latest game to work with AMD’s upscaler without mods; an unofficial FSR patch for RDR2 has been out for a while, but this update should make it even easier to simply enable or disable FSR in the settings menu. Alongside its rival, Nvidia DLSS, which Rockstar also added last year.

Tencent’s investment in Guillemot Brothers Limited follows speculation last month that they were looking to take out a bigger stake in Ubisoft, even becoming the single largest shareholders.

                              <span>I&#x27;m an enormous fan of the premise of Steelrising (which is good, because enormous fans are also a weapon in it). In it, we&#x27;re whisked to an alternative history where King Louis XVI stopped the French Revolution before it properly got going by, err, killing everyone with steampunk robots. You&#x27;re Aegis, a feminine robot created to entertain and protect Queen Marie Antoinette. Marie, safe outside Paris but somewhat peeved at her husband&#x27;s new penchant for extreme mass murder, sends you on a Soulslike mission to sort it all out.
This takes some doing, but luckily Aegis is a very advanced robot, the bestest of all the robots. Slight but adaptive with it, and even having an advanced AI, Aegis can carve a swift path through the more than usually twisted metal in her way. It&#x27;s a bit too easy, in fact.

                              <span>What sounds like the entire Assassin’s Creed line-up for Saturday’s Ubisoft Forward presentation may have been leaked online. Unnamed sources have supposedly told TryHardGuides that three new AC games will be announced during the event, with an instalment set in feudal Japan being among them. Bloomberg backs up the report, stating that the other games purported to be in development include one set in the 16th century that could be dealing with witches, and a mobile game set in China.

                              <span>The AMD Ryzen 5 5600 is a cheaper, better-value version of the Ryzen 5600X - the CPU took the world by storm when Ryzen 5000 launched back in 2020. With six cores and 12 threads to access, you get good performance in modern game engines, while the higher single-core speeds introduced with this generation of AMD processors allows for better performance in single-core-limited (often older) games. It&#x27;s a potent combination that makes the 5600X - and the 5600 - the best value AMD CPUs for gaming out there. 
Normally the 5600 retails for £173, in comparison to £185 for the 5600X, but today it&#x27;s down to £150 on Amazon, coming within £10 of the best price we&#x27;ve ever seen on this model.

Not until I saw several scrunching up, pretending to be the eyes, nose and mouth of someone’s face in images from upcoming psychological horror card game Out Of Hands. See, Out Of Hands has a slight fixation on the ol’ phalanges. Witness for yourself in the trailer below.

In addition to millions in damages, the plaintiffs demand user disconnections and pirate site blockades.

                              <span>During the first wave of RTX 3080 reviews, when we had no idea of the graphics card supply shortage to come, I remember being really impressed by the Asus Tuf Gaming model. It didn&#x27;t look particularly special on the outside, but it consistently beat even more expensive models in terms of thermals and performance. I resolved to get one for myself, but things went mad and I only eventually managed to get one through my work.

America&#x27;s bad-ass actor dad played semi-imaginary rock anarchist (I know I&#x27;m being reductive, don&#x27;t leave comments) Johnny Silverhand in the main game, and he popped up to confirm he&#x27;s back for 2023&#x27;s expansion - which we now know is officially called Phantom Liberty.
There&#x27;s also the Edgerunner update dropping today, a tie-in for the Netflix anime Edgrunners (more info on that was also revealed tonight), and free-to-play mini game featuring Roach the horse, because we all like Roach the horse.

I don’t think I’ve ever built one on the back of a giant animal after the apocalypse, though. Indie sci-fi citybuilder The Wandering Village will let me do that when it enters early access on Steam on September 14th. See the great lumbering beast for yourself by watching the trailer below.

I got a sneaky early peek at Lucid behind closed doors at PAX East earlier this year, and let me tell you, its gorgeous pixel art and emphasis on air dashing through crystalline barriers with a honking great axe looks rad as hell.

But most of my thought is going on farming, planning my crop rotations to optimise fertility and yields. Finally, I have a use for everything school taught me about the three-field system and the nitrogen cycle.

                              <span>Soldier Boyz is the newest supported game of the Hypno engine, and it’s ready for public testing!
Released in 1997 by Hypnotix and published by DreamCatcher Interactive and MCPA Interactive, this full-motion rail shooter is based on the 1995 film of the same name. The game starts when the daughter of an American billionaire is kidnapped by a group of Vietnamese terrorists. Then, it’s up to Major Howard Toliver, ex-Marine and highly decorated Vietnam veteran, to gather a deadly team for the dangerous mission of rescuing her. He recruits six prison inmates serving life sentences for a chance at a full presidential pardon.
Keep the body count rising to survive five territories by playing as each Soldier Boy (and Girl),
but beware and don’t waste a “friendly” since they provide vital survival information!
ScummVM currently supports the English release of the game (which is the only one we know about) and features more responsive controls than the original. We couldn&#x27;t find a demo but there is a trailer. Please contact us if you have a demo or any other release.
To play the game with ScummVM, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.
