I&#x27;m just going to get this joke out of the way: Fall Guys is the most autumnal video game. There we go. You may chortle and guffaw to your heart&#x27;s content, and then we&#x27;ll start the rest of this extremely niche, very specific article. You done? Good. Okay.
So! It&#x27;s Autumn, or Fall, depending on whether you&#x27;re in Blighty or &#x27;Murica, as of the 22nd September. For some of you, that means crunching your way through crisp orange leaves on the way to school; for others, it means getting the warm duvets out of storage; for me in particular, it means that I get to eat a ton of pie and drink hot chocolate, and no one gets to judge me. (Seriously, people are weird about having hot drinks in warm-ish weather! I ordered a hot toddy at a bar the other day and they laughed at me! IT&#x27;S ON YOUR MENU, MATE.)

It&#x27;s been an absolutely huge week for Super Mario, with Illumination and Nintendo giving the world its very first look at The Super Mario Bros. Movie. Although the longtime video game voice of Mario Charles Martinet isn&#x27;t leading this project, he hasn&#x27;t been forgotten about.
Fellow voice actor Tara Strong (The Powerpuff Girls, My Little Pony, Harley Quinn in MultiVersus, and Miss Minutes in Loki) has called on social media to show the voice of Mario &quot;some love&quot;. Of course, Charles was amazed by the collective response from fans - thanking everyone who had reached out. Here&#x27;s the full exchange:

                              <span>Part 5 of our list of hidden gems is our biggest yet.
Back in September, we asked you lovely readers to tell us what hidden gems slipped through our fingers. You championed them, and our backlog (both personal and professional) is feeling even more daunting.
We&#x27;re not kidding when we say we had tons of nominations, and as a result, whittling down the list was no easy feat. Even so, this is our biggest list of &#x27;Reader Recommendations&#x27; yet, with 24 titles piquing our interest. But don&#x27;t worry, even if your recommendation didn&#x27;t make it onto the list, it&#x27;s still staring at us wistfully. Perhaps part 6 will come to pass very soon — this is the first one we&#x27;ve done this year and the first in over a year. And we love to hear from you all! So if you still think we&#x27;re missing something, or you have another recommendation, follow the instructions at the end of the article to nominate more!

Welcome, everyone, to another edition of &#x27;Box Art Brawl&#x27;!
Last week featured one of our closest polls to date with Resident Evil: The Mercenaries 3D for the NIntendo 3DS. It&#x27;s not everyone&#x27;s favourite game in the series by a long stretch, but It seems Capcom at least nailed down some pretty decent box art for all three major regions.

Nintendo announced the 1996/97 game Pilotwings 64 would be making its debut on the Switch Online + Expansion Pack service a few days ago, and it seems this will be the best version of the game yet.
GameXplain has taken a closer look at the footage shown in the trailers, and it appears the gameplay will be targeting 60fps. In the original version of the game, it&#x27;s highlighted how it was only the menus that ran at 60fps while gameplay was around 30fps. This latest re-release will also feature a higher resolution.

By default though, your options for connecting the controller are Bluetooth (on later models) or a wired USB connection - rather than the low-latency 2.4GHz wireless you get on Xbox consoles, which requires Microsoft&#x27;s $25 Wireless Adapter for Windows. That adapter is down to $18 at Newegg today, and is well worth picking up while it&#x27;s discounted.

Hello, friends of me, and welcome to Whatcha Been Playing? It&#x27;s sure getting chillier as we enter the fall season — at least it is in my neck of the woods — and I hope that all y&#x27;all have warm things to snuggle up to, be that people, plush toys, or PS4 Pros running God of War.

                              <span>One of the things you can do with a Steam Deck is use it for emulation. Someone at Valve is evidently aware of this, given the recent Steam Deck video - which we wrote about two days ago - contained a shot of a Steam library with a Nintendo Switch emulator in it.

Oops. Valve have since deleted and re-uploaded the video with the emulator removed.

                              <span>It&#x27;s easy to take backwards compatibility for granted on PC, so much so that we rarely even use the phrase &quot;backwards compatibility&quot;. Most old games will simply run, and for everything else there&#x27;s usually a compatibility mode built into Windows or DOSBox to get it going.

This didn&#x27;t happen by accident, as an old blog post by a former Microsoft programmer explains. When Microsoft wanted users to switch to Windows 95, for example, they went so far as to add specific code that looked for SimCity and, if it was running, changed how memory allocation worked so that the game wouldn&#x27;t crash.

                              <span>Graphics cards are getting bigger, hotter and more expensive - and that first one is more of a problem than you might think. With the RTX 4090 and a whole family of oversized GPUs on the way, those tiny PCIe slots on your motherboard are taking on an incredible amount of weight, such that even mid-range cards can sag and bend over time. 
The best way to prevent this is with a brace, which pushes up from the bottom of your case to the far end of the graphics card, holding it level and preventing all that force from affecting the card or the PCIe slot. You sometimes get a support brace like this free with your graphics card, but otherwise you can pick one up fairly inexpensively from a range of manufacturers.

This GP66 Leopard is one of the fastest gaming laptops on the market, with a Core i7 processor, 16GB of RAM, 1TB NVMe SSD and a 144Hz screen - not to mention that flagship-grade graphics card. 
It normally retails for a cool £1998, but today Laptops Direct has discounted it to £1399.97, making it the cheapest RTX 3080 laptop we can find right now.

I can pretend, against incontrovertible evidence, that I am able to function in human society. However, a standard child’s imagination is magnitudes more powerful than my own. A child can believe that a dollar store knock-off Transformer is anywhere near as sexy as the real thing. They can also convince themselves that Mega Man on DOS is equatable to the NES version.
DOS gamers often got the shaft. Although we’d get games like Wolfenstein 3D and Doom before everyone else, not every IBM PC-Compatible user was armed with a 386. Developers often made their games to run on older 8-bit processors. A lot of games, even ones that were on 8-bit hardw…</span>

With too many games announced years before they&#x27;ll ever see the light of day on store shelves, I really get a kick out of those titles that go from reveal to release in just a couple of months. I don&#x27;t like to wait for all that much, so it&#x27;s great when there is a fast turnaround. Like with Ultra Kaiju Monster Rancher for Nintendo Switch. Bandai Namco announced its localization just a few months ago. And yesterday, we learned the full release of the game is only days away.
Ultra Kaiju Monster Ranch for Switch will release on October 20. That is one day before my vacation to the Grand Canyon is set to begin, and I think this will be an excellent game to have along for the ride.

If you&#x27;ve been missing out on what this game is, Ultra Kaiju Monster Rancher takes the classic Monster Rancher franchise and smashes it up with the Ultraman tokusatsu series. Players will raise kaiju, train them, feed them cookies, have them do battle, and fuse them to create more powerful monsters. It&#x27;s all pretty ridiculous and I can&#x27;t wait to see it for myself on October 20.
Also, I want to thank the members of our community who, in my last post about the game, gave me recommendations for Ultraman X shows to watch to ready myself for this release. It&#x27;s been a lot of fun catching up with this franchise on my lunch breaks.

January 2023 just got slightly busier. This morning, Atlus dropped word that its ports of Persona 3 Portable and Persona 4 Golden will land on Nintendo Switch, Xbox, PlayStation, and PC on January 19. That&#x27;s just a little over three months away, fitting in nicely between the release of One Piece Odyssey on January 13 and Fire Emblem Engage on January 20. I know a few of my friends who&#x27;ve been waiting for a Persona 4 Switch release date will be very excited by this. Unfortunately, lest there be a surprise Limited Run Games or Strictly Limited announcement on the horizon, both titles will be digital only.
https://twitter.com/Atlus_West/status/1578696035932815360
Persona 3 Portable was originally released for the PSP back in 2009 as the third version of the game, following Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3 and Persona 3 FES, both for the PlayStation 2. Persona 4 Golden is the best-selling PlayStation Vita title that also became a pretty big hit when it was released on Steam in 2020.
As a reminder, Persona 5 Royal releases on October 21 for Switch, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. If you own the game on PS4 as I do, there will be no free update to the PS5 version.

                              <span>The Silver Hawk takes flight
Following a string of relative obscurities, this week&#x27;s Arcade Archives entry is no stranger to any coin-op fan worth their weight in pocket-jingling quarters — Taito&#x27;s legendary shmup, Darius, is now available to download on Nintendo Switch via the eShop.
Released to arcades in 1987, before making its way to a slew of home platforms, Darius is one of the most recognizable and beloved franchises in the shmup genre, rendered iconic thanks to its dazzling visuals, exciting two-player action, typically great Taito soundtrack, and, famously, its enormous arcade cabinet, which sported a huge, three-screen panoramic display. Darius puts players in the cockpit of the mighty Silver Hawk space vessels, tasked with defending the titular planet from the Belsar Empire.

The incredible success of these arcade and home ports would see the franchise stamp its identity as one of the all-time shmup classics. Taito would release a sequel, Darius II, in 1989, and a remixed version of the original game, Darius Plus, in 1990. Since these halcyon days, the franchise has been visited multiple times in the form of various remasters, sequels, and spin-offs. The most recent iteration, Dariusburst: Chronicle Saviours, is available now on PS4 and PC. It is also worth noting that Darius, along with several follow-up releases, is also available via the two Darius Cozmic Collections.
Darius is available to download now on Nintendo Switch, priced at $8. It is already available on PS4.

                              <span>You were expecting somebody else?
Kojima Productions has revealed the identity of the movie star previously teased to appear in the studio&#x27;s newest mysterious project — Elle Fanning, of The Neon Demon and Maleficent fame, will be taking her first steps into Hideo Kojima&#x27;s strange and esoteric universe in the as-yet-unnamed release.
Admittedly, this will not come as much of a shock to anybody, as the initial teaser, which features an extreme close-up of Fanning&#x27;s head with the features in shadow, was quickly identified as the young starlet, thanks to her distinct ear shape and jawline. Kojima Productions as QR codes posted at PAX Australia were found to link to a new, uncensored version of the same headshot, with some variants replacing the phrase &quot;Who Am I?&quot; with a new question: &quot;Where Am I?&quot;

Fanning will join a list of notable Tinseltown actors who have worked with Kojima Productions on its releases. Most notably, 2019&#x27;s Death Stranding, which featured appearances from Norman Reedus, Mads Mikkelson, Lea Seydoux, Margaret Qualley, and Lindsey Wagner, among others. There was also a role for film director Nicholas Winding Refn, who coincidentally directed Fanning in the aforementioned psych-horror film, The Neon Demon.
It is very likely that we will hear more about Kojima Productions&#x27; new project and the involvement of Elle Fanning at The Game Awards, which is scheduled to take place December 8 at the Microsoft Arena in Los Angeles. I wouldn&#x27;t start the hype engines just yet, however. Given that this is yer boy Hideo that we&#x27;re talking about, there is likely to be something of a long haul ahead before the new title is even likely to be viewed in a playable state.

Focus Entertainment and Team Asobo have released the final PC requirements for their incoming stealth sequel A Plague Tale: Requiem. The grim-looking adventure is currently scheduled to launch on PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X on October 18.
A Plague Tale: Requiem will tell of the continuing tale of orphaned children Hugo and Amicia de Rune, violently torn from their aristocratic family and thrust into a miserable world of death and disease — pursued by both The Inquisition and a terrifying army of needle-teethed black rats. The sequel will see the de Rune as they country their epic journey through 16th century France, outnumbered and outgunned.
Despite being a so-called &quot;AA&quot; release, predecessor A Plague Tale: Innocence was an incredibly attractive title with highly detailed worlds and lavish lighting and visual effects. As such, it would figure that the French developer would go all-in on new-gen for the sequel, in order to further realize its ambition of creating and grimly gorgeous world.
You can check out the Minimum and Recommended requirements/specifications below.

                              <span>The highly anticipated sequel is almost here
It&#x27;s hard to believe that God of War: Ragnarok was only announced two years ago, but Sony&#x27;s Santa Monica studio has been hard at work since then. The sequel has been one of the most anticipated games of recent memory, and it&#x27;s looking pretty good based on the most recent story trailer we got during a State of Play.
Now the studio has announced that God of War: Ragnarok has gone gold, meaning they have sent off the final version of the game to get ready for its release on November 9. It&#x27;s a huge step for any game developer, and it&#x27;s even more impressive for a game as ambitious as we know this one to be. Here&#x27;s hoping they have at least a bit of time to celebrate before continuing work on patches and bug fixes.

Ragnarok is set three years after the events of its predecessor, and picks up at the end of Fimbulwinter giving way to the apocalyptic Ragnorak. Kratos and his son Arteus are trying to find a way to prevent the event from happening, all while wrapping them up in the family drama of the Norse gods. The game looks gorgeous, and it promises to deliver on some exciting new gameplay mechanics. Plus, it&#x27;s fun to get a new take on the Norse pantheon after the MCU version has reigned supreme for so long.
Players have lots to look forward to gameplay wise, as Kratos is getting a revamped battle axe and access to his classic chains weapons. There&#x27;re also gonna be some new elemental attacks, specifically fire and ice charged attacks, and shields and parries will also play a role. Basically, get ready for all the hack-and-slash, axe-throwing goodness we know and love, but also with some upgrades.
I know I&#x27;m looking forward to Ragnarok, and with only a few short weeks to wait, I&#x27;ll be here before we know it.

                              <span>But they&#x27;re in space
The Ninja Jajamaru-Kun series took a hard left turn after Jajamaru no Daibouken. Considering it started as something of a rip-off of Ninja-Kun after Jaleco published the Famicom port of that game. It never really had a strong identity, but Jaleco was going to throw it against the wall as many times as it could until it finally stuck.
It never stuck. Reinvention didn’t work. The biggest offshoot was Ninja Jajamaru-Kun&#x27;s attempts at JRPGs, but 1991’s Ninja Jajamaru Ginga Daisakusen for Famicom is perhaps the one that feels most desperate. That’s not to say it’s bad, but if some sort of game vampire sucked out every last ounce of what little personality the series had, this is what you’d get.

                              <span>Plus, Crash 4 is coming to Steam
There might be some Crash Bandicoot news in store for the end of the year. A promotional teaser being set out to influencers has some suspicious details on it, which fans speculate may hint at an upcoming reveal.
A promotional pizza box sent to influencer Canadian Guy Eh had the release date for the upcoming Steam release of Crash Bandicoot 4: It&#x27;s About Time on it. It&#x27;s labelled out with the October 18 release date.
But below that on the box is something teasing a new &quot;Wumpa Pizza&quot;, available for $12.08. That is, as it so happens, the date of this year&#x27;s Game Awards.
https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1578433150895632384
Now, that&#x27;s the one link we&#x27;ve got here. A pizza box, with a conspicuous tease about something, and the month/day combo for this year&#x27;s Game Awards.
What&#x27;s next for Crash
There have been a few teases from Crash Bandicoot 4 developer Toys For Bob about what&#x27;s in store for the studio. The crew teased that it had some more wall space to cover with its Toys For Bob Wall of Games in August.
And earlier this year, a rumor went around about a new Crash game in development. It certainly seems like something could be in the works.
Toys For Bob took the reins on the Crash series after working on Skylanders, and It&#x27;s About Time was well-received. The team had been shifted onto Call of Duty: Warzone development, but hopefully these teases indicate we&#x27;ll be seeing more.
As for what exactly that is? We&#x27;re just going to have to wait until The Game Awards to find out, I guess.

                              <span>Games at their very best on Switch OLED, Part 2.
It&#x27;s been one whole year since brand-new Nintendo Switch hardware launched alongside the first &#x27;2D&#x27; Metroid game for nearly two decades. Metroid Dread, with planet ZDR&#x27;s mysteriously dark environs and Samus&#x27; super-bright firearms, was a perfect showcase for Switch OLED&#x27;s particular enhancements over the base console and Switch Lite, demonstrating succinctly the benefits of the new screen&#x27;s improved contrast and brighter colours versus the original&#x27;s IPS panel.
In the week following launch, we published an article and accompanying video highlighting 25 Switch games (plus a handful more, in fact) that we thought looked particularly lovely on Nintendo&#x27;s premium offering. Obviously, there&#x27;s an argument that every Switch game will look better on the OLED, but we wanted to focus on experiences that we felt are considerably enhanced by the extra screen real estate and richer detail.

                              <span>This reminds me of a puzzle...
From the late 2000s to the mid-2010s, my gaming experience was all about learning to become a gentleman. This was a central topic which ran throughout the Professor Layton series. If Professor Hershel Layton wore a trench coat, I wore a trench coat; if he drank fruity tea, I drank fruity tea; if he was reminded of a puzzle during the most inappropriate of times...well, you get the idea. This is to say that the Professor Layton games were a huge part of my formative gaming and indeed, my self-education. So why is it that, today, my views of the series are so often tainted?
The answer may be found in the last title of the series: Layton’s Mystery Journey: Katrielle and the Millionaires’ Conspiracy. This a game that, regardless of its merits, never sat well with me. There was no Hershel, no Luke, no aggressively brilliant jazz score. It wasn’t a Professor Layton game — to my mind, at least.

Note: The arrival of the substantial Waypoint 4.0 update isn&#x27;t yet available on Switch. We&#x27;ll update this review with our verdict on that and an overall score as soon as possible. In the meantime, you can find our pre-Waypoint impressions of the Switch release below.

It&#x27;s been a long old road for Hello Games&#x27; No Man&#x27;s Sky. First revealed at the VGX Awards all the way back in 2013, the procedurally generated infinite space simulator finally released — riding an enormous wave of hype — in August of 2016. However, the PS4 and PC game we got our sweaty hands on was a far cry from what had been advertised and promised during a build-up to launch that could have made Peter Molyneux blush.

So you should now be able to log in and play without attaching your mobile. This will not apply to new Battle.net sign ups. See the previous updates below for more information.

Update: Blizzard has just shared an update on its website - revealing it will be loosening phone number requirements for a majority of existing Overwatch players. However, new accounts will still have to meet the SMS Protect requirements. Here are the full details in its official forum update:

After the release of both Pokémon Scarlet and Violet&#x27;s new trailer and The Super Mario Bros. Movie teaser, our minds are all deep-dived out - but what a time to be a Nintendo fan, huh!
This week, our fabulous writers have been hard at work providing you lovely readers with breakdowns on the Mario Movie trailer, poster, and - erm - Mario&#x27;s butt. We got a first look at the infuriatingly named Farigiraf from Scarlet and Violet and, obviously, we got introduced to even more new discoveries in Breath of the Wild.

Nintendo Live is taking place this weekend in Tokyo, and it seems a statue based on Link in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is present.
It gives fans perhaps their best look yet at Link&#x27;s new character model and the mysterious new changes to one of his arms. This shot was taken at a promotional section of Nintendo Live, simply featuring a banner and the Link statue (via Game Watch).

                              <span>The price of free-to-play.
In case you missed it, Overwatch has swapped to a free-to-play model with the release of the second title earlier this week, and that means there are some new microtransactions, like the premium battle pass. In other words, if you want to unlock certain cosmetics or get more out of the game, you might need to fork out real money.
It seems the grind has also been pushed to the limits because of this new model. A Reddit user by the name of &#x27;Chibi Tracer&#x27; on the Overwatch subreddit has done some calculations, and apparently, it would take around 5 years or about 15,600 coins to unlock all of the nonseasonal items for the new hero Kiriko.

Nintendo and Illumination gave Mario fans a first look at The Super Mario Bros. Movie this week. As short as it was, there was plenty of highlights and one standout moment was the brief exchange the Penguin King (voiced by Khary Payton) had with Bowser (Jack Black).
A 3D animator, video editor and media personality who goes by the name Coda on Twitter has now recreated this amazing scene in Super Mario 64. It&#x27;s short, but it gets the job done - with the post going viral on the social media platform as well as YouTube:

It&#x27;s now been one year since MercurySteam released Metroid Dread on the Nintendo Switch, and to celebrate this special occasion Nintendo has restocked the fancy-looking holographic poster set on its online store in the US.
If you&#x27;ve not played Metroid Dread yet - it&#x27;s well worth a look, you can even download a demo from the Switch eShop. Earlier this year in May, it also became the best-selling game in the Metroid series - shifting 2.9 million units and surpassing sales of the original Metroid Prime game.

The fighting genre is about to enter the next generation with games like Tekken 8 and Street Fighter 6. One other series, in particular, that&#x27;s played a huge part in evolving the scene over the years is the violent and bloody Mortal Kombat. It also led to the formation of the ESRB in the US, which saw age ratings assigned to video games.
Now, 30 years later, co-creator Ed Boon and NetherRealm Studios are celebrating the series&#x27; 30th anniversary. Since the original Mortal Kombat made its debut in arcades on October 8th, 1992 the series has skyrocketed to become one of the most popular video game franchises of all time. There&#x27;s been more than 20 games, multiple movies, and even some spin-offs along the way.

                              <span>And it&#x27;s insanely gorgeous
Every once in a while, I see something a player has created on Reddit or Twitter, and it makes me have faith in video games again. I&#x27;ve been feeling a bit run down after the tumultuous Overwatch 2 launch this week, but then I saw something so beautiful, it made me remember what a beautiful medium games can be: a Minecraft player recreated the entire universe in the game. Yeah, it&#x27;s just as beautiful as it sounds.
User u/ChrisDaCow uploaded a video of his work to the Minecraft subreddit, among other sites, earlier this week, and the post has amassed more awards than I&#x27;ve ever seen on Reddit before. The build features a black hole, a nebula, the whole solar system, and a super cluster.
ChrisDaCow also made a whole vlog documenting to process of the build, which I find fascinating as someone who hasn&#x27;t played more than a handful of hours in Minecraft. He says one of the most useful tools that made the entire build possible is the fact that you can &quot;paint with light&quot; in the game (something I never knew was a thing), which allowed him to recreate how light actually works in space.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;eAkb2mpybnM
He also had to scale the blocks way down to fit everything into one Minecraft world, and Chris even breaks out some math to make sure to get the scale of Saturn&#x27;s rings just right. I&#x27;m seriously impressed by how much effort he put into this whole thing, and I get the feeling it&#x27;s going to go down as one of the all time greatest Minecraft builds of all time.
Not gonna lie, I usually have a good deal of existential dread rattling around, but seeing our universe depicted so beautifully and with so much care helps me see things in a new light.

                              <span>Still just one for the newer generation
A recent PlayStation trailer for the upcoming remake of Dead Space listed PS4 alongside PS5, sparking some speculation it might arrive on both generations. A new report indicates that was a mistake, however.
According to Eurogamer, the trailer listing both PlayStation platforms is &quot;a mistake,&quot; as the outlet understands. The original listing for PS4 obviously stirred up some rampant speculation that this might turn out to be a PS4 game as well.
While this trailer is still online as of this writing, it no longer lists PS4 in the title as it previously did. Looks like Dead Space is still aiming for just the newer generation.

Back out to space
The Dead Space remake is being handled by Electronic Arts&#x27; Motive studio, which previously worked on games like Star Wars Battlefront II and Star Wars Squadrons.
For Dead Space, the team has been surprisingly candid about the development process. Motive has shown several deep, behind-the-scenes looks at the making of this remake, spotlighting sound, art, and more.
We also got a look at some gameplay just this week, along with the reveal of a really neat (and really expensive) collector&#x27;s edition from Limited Run Games.
It&#x27;s been quite a few years since players first set foot on the USG Ishimura. But honestly, I&#x27;m more than ready for a Dead Space revival. I&#x27;m not even one for horror games most of the time, but I loved the sci-fi terror of the Dead Space series.
We&#x27;ll see how Motive&#x27;s own venture onto the Ishimura goes when Dead Space launches January 27, 2023 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.

                              <span>Shield your savings account
Those of you who were big into the merchandising angle of Blizzard Entertainment&#x27;s Overwatch will likely remember, (or perhaps even own) some of the excellent statues that were released, depicting heroes such as Tracer, Widowmaker, Mercy, and Dva in fine form at a relatively reasonable price — Well, the statues are seemingly returned, although the &quot;relatively reasonable price&quot; part may not be.
Following this week&#x27;s launch of flashy sequel Overwatch 2, Blizzard has opened pre-orders on a brand new statue of perhaps OW&#x27;s noblest and most steel-hearted of heroes, the mighty Reinhardt. This very impressive centerpiece is sculpted of PVC and polyresin and stands a huge 25 inches in height, showcasing the shining knight one step away from launching his devastating ult: Earthshatter.

This hand-painted specimen features exquisite detail, perfectly recreating Reinhardt&#x27;s battle armor and expertly capturing the hero in an extremely dynamic pose. While all of the Overwatch statues have been impressive, Reinhardt&#x27;s intricate design, strong posture, and base detail seem to be setting the tone for a new wave of statues, ones that will see the heroes &quot;mid-match&quot; rather than standing at rest.
Of course, all of this size and detail comes at a price, and Reinhardt is a doozy. Now available to pre-order over at the official Blizzard Gear store, Reinhardt will set you back $1,100 USD (not including shipping or any potential customs costs). There does not appear to be any sort of installment plan ala most statue sellers, so you may have to drop the four figures in one lump sum come launch day. Reinhardt is tentatively expected to release in November... You still have a couple of weeks to save up..?
Overwatch 2 is available now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.

Online retail outlet Epic Games Store has revealed the next title that it will be offering up to its users gratis, following this week&#x27;s current offerings — And it will be none other than the old-school cool release Toe Jam &amp; Earl: Back in the Groove, which will be available to all customers on October 13.
Released to PC and consoles in the spring of 2019, Back in the Groove saw the long-awaited return of early &#x27;90s gaming goofballs Toe Jam &amp; Earl, as the awesome aliens once again returned to their isometric adventure roots. Once again, the funky fresh aliens have crash-landed on Planet Earth, and must recover all of the pieces of their &quot;Rapmaster Rocket&quot; in order to get back out into the great beyond.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;RQlK-jTIiwU
Now sporting a roster of both new and familiar playable characters, as well as four-player co-op action, the series&#x27; dopey sense of humor, and the tongue-in-cheek &quot;radical&quot; vibes of the 1990s, all slickly adapted for the modern age. A suitably fresh soundtrack was composed by funk musician Cody Wright, while the entire project was overseen by Toe Jam &amp; Earl co-creator Greg Johnson and, believe it or not, lifelong fan Macaulay Culkin.
On release, Back in the Groove was welcomed by the TJ&amp;E fanbase, while critical reviews ranged wildly from mediocre to excellent. As divisive as the duo has ever been, Back in the Groove is clearly a title that will mean different things to different players. At least, given its upcoming freebie status, you&#x27;ll be able to check out where you stand on the animated actioner — no strings attached, dude.
Toe Jam &amp; Earl: Back in the Groove will be free to download from Epic Games Store from October 13. Until then, you still have time to bag current freebies Rising Hell and Slain: Back from Hell from the store.

                              <span>PlayStation Steam Network
Video game fans who like to rock both PlayStation and PC platforms now have the option of creating some sort of Marriage Made in Hell, as SIE has announced that players are now able to link their PSN and Steam accounts together — The latest step in PlayStation Studios grand push to the PC platform.
Once said action has been performed, then this will open the door for the possibility of joint actions of PlayStation Studios&#x27; upcoming gamut of PC releases. For example, players with linked accounts will receive additional skill points and two &quot;early unlock bonuses&quot; in Insomniac Games&#x27; Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man, namely the &quot;Resilient Suit&quot; and the &quot;Concussive Blast&quot; weapon. Future titles ported to the PC platform could see similar bonuses, or cross-progression, or any manner of additional features.
Those wishing to link their PSN and Steam accounts should head on over to the sign-up page on the official PlayStation website, and you&#x27;ll be good to go in just a few clicks. While this may eventually prove to be a fairly unrewarding endeavor, It is understandable that Sony would be looking to bring the Steam audience further into its own community, given the studio&#x27;s ongoing desire to release a slew of major PlayStation titles onto the PC platform, including titles from the Horizon Zero Dawn, God of War, and Uncharted franchises.

When Zelda: Breath of the Wild first came out, there was quite a bit of hubbub about the weapon durability system.
Look, I get it! It was incredible to play the game in a pre-launch bubble where it didn&#x27;t really impact me that much: only to see the game actually come out, and witness the subject be debated on high for months on end. But as Reddit user Vados_Link shows us, people ended up discovering unique ways to approach the game&#x27;s many deliberate, or accidental puzzles.
Cleverly, they use Magnesis to pick up an already-used treasure chest, and utilize the enemy&#x27;s lack of line of sight to set up their plan. Then they flick the chest into a giant group of formidable enemies, line up their shot, and shock it multiple times with a Shock Arrow. One of the best parts of the clip is how they all thunk into the ground in a satisfying way.
While we really don&#x27;t have any details on Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom&#x27;s approach to durability, they have to have taken some lessoned learned from Breath of the Wild at least. While there are plenty of ways around it (and it didn&#x27;t really impact me much on any of my playthroughs, including the first, which was completely blind), it&#x27;s a polarizing topic that has a few different solutions.
One of the best uses of Shock Arrows in Breath of the Wild:

                              <span>The Waypoint update overhauls the core of No Man&#x27;s Sky
No Man&#x27;s Sky journeys onto the Nintendo Switch today, and arriving alongside it is update 4.0. The &quot;Waypoint&quot; update overhauls some fundamental pieces of the No Man&#x27;s Sky experience, from inventory and UI to game modes.
One big part of the update is custom game modes. Players can essentially tailor the gameplay of No Man&#x27;s Sky to their liking through different presets and options. Tick survival elements all the way down if you don&#x27;t want to deal with toxic hazards, or combat way up if you want a bit of a challenge. Even elements like fuel usage can be set to &quot;free&quot;, letting you zip around the stars with no gas fees attached.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;KWgZ2kjL4bM
This adds to the roster of already existing modes, like Normal, Creative, and the Community Expeditions. Another new mode setting, Relaxed, is also being added. It&#x27;s described as an accessible, laid-back experience for players who want to check out No Man&#x27;s Sky with less danger and grinding involved. Sounds like a good time, to be honest.
Sky&#x27;s the limit
Of course, there is even more in this No Man&#x27;s Sky update. Seamless Auto-Saves are a big one, letting players not worry too much about making manual save points.
AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 2 is getting integrated too, so all PC players can get a boost in performance regardless of what card they&#x27;re using.
Special rockets can now deliver goods up and into space for sale, and Drop Pods have more in-game data made apparent. The inventory itself is also seeing a major overhaul, with new icons and better clarification for managing all those goods.
Sprinkle in some touches like new planetary effects and making the anomalies a little more eerie. No Man&#x27;s Sky players are getting a lot in this new drop. While I feel like I&#x27;m saying that with every NMS update, it&#x27;s also true.
The Waypoint update for No Man&#x27;s Sky is free for all players.

This weekend, we can expect a helluva lot of fists and feet to be spinning through the air and planting on the domes of some unfortunate skulls, as Capcom has finally opened the doors to its upcoming scrapper, Street Fighter 6 — A closed beta kicks off today on PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X, giving the online audience its first taste of the new sequel.
From today until Monday, October 10, the lucky players chosen to participate in the beta will get the opportunity to duke it out, both online and offline, in the dazzling new fighting title. A total of eight playable characters are available (Ryu, Ken, Luke, Jamie, Juri, Kimberly, Chun-Li, and Guile) and several limited modes can be enjoyed, from classic one-on-one battles to the chaotic new &quot;Extreme&quot; mode, and the in…</span>

PlatinumGames has finally broken its silence on the uncomfortable and shocking collapse of its ambitious fantasy adventure, Babylon&#x27;s Fall. Speaking in an interview with VGC, PlatinumGames CEO Atsushi Inaba noted that he was &quot;extremely sorry&quot; for any frustration or disappointment felt by the gaming community.
Speaking semi-candidly, Inaba said that he was not in a position to discuss the title&#x27;s development or marketing strategies in any detail, due to the studio&#x27;s commitment to its publishers. But, reading between the lines, Inaba expresses a sense of regret that Platinum was confined only to the development of Babylon&#x27;s Fall itself, which would suggest he would&#x27;ve liked the team to take a stronger role in its release.

                              <span>The Invaders from Beyond seasonal even is live through October 18
At this point, Fallout 76 has a formidable host of seasonal events, quality of life updates, and major patches. We just got The Pitt when it comes to the latter approach, and now another seasonal event is coming back in the rotation: Invaders from Beyond.
The gist is that literal aliens have come to West Virginia for research purposes, and it&#x27;s your job to take various quests/partake in public events to take them down, in a wave-based format. It&#x27;s a fun arcadey little diversion that goes along with the cheeky alien references in various prior Fallout games.
Bethesda has hosted this event before, including earlier this year (twice), which features &quot;all-new Public Events and even random encounters (of a third kind) as you fend off the alien threat with your teammates.&quot;
Also remember, Fallout 76 is free to try this week
A lot is currently going on in the Fallout-verse, too.
Due to the 25th anniversary celebration event, Fallout 76 is currently free to try. While the first day kicked off on October 4 you still have some time left, as it runs through October 11. The game is also currently still free on Prime Gaming through November 1.

Chocks away and all that malarky, as Nintendo has announced that its skyfairing compendium, Pilotwings 64, will be the next Nintendo 64 classic to join the Nintendo Switch Online service. The new title will be added to the Switch Online archives on Thursday, October 13.
Released on N64 in 1996, Pilotwings 64 is a revamped edition of the much-loved 1990 SNES classic, best known for its groundbreaking use of Mode 7 technology, which was very much a boasting point for Nintendo during the 16-bit era. Much like the original, Pilotwings 64 features an array of airborne stunts and acrobatic activities, including skydiving, Cannonball, stunt gliding, or even taking to the wild blue yonder equipped with a jet pack or seated in a gyrocopter!
My dad started building a gyrocopter a decade ago. I think he sold it before completion. True story.

Anyway, Pilotwings 64 will be made available to all Nintendo Switch Online subscribers, and joins a roster of beloved hits from yesteryear that already includes Kirby 64, Pokemon Snap, Mario Golf, F-Zero X, Star Fox 64, Banjo-Kazooie, and, of course, Super Mario 64. Most recently, Nintendo finally confirmed that GoldenEye 007, one of the N64&#x27;s most iconic releases and conspicuous by its continued absence, is headed to the archives in the near future, complete with online multiplayer.
Pilotwings 64 will be available to download from Nintendo Switch Online on October 13.

                              <span>A Splatoon 3 Pokemon Splatfest is coming!
A Splatoon 3 Pokemon Splatfest is on the way, thanks to a new announcement from Nintendo just this morning. It&#x27;ll force you to choose between a grass, fire, and water starter: and make the same hard choice you made decades ago (or in whatever generation you started in).
Here&#x27;s what Nintendo has to say about the upcoming event:
&quot;Grass-type. Fire-type. Water-type. Since 1998 (or 1996 depending on where you lived), this debate has perplexed our great philosophers. In the Pokemon series, players typically start their adventure by choosing a Pokemon with one of these three types. Each has its own strengths and weaknesses (literally – it’s part of the game!).&quot;

Ideally, this will take place after all of the Splatfest changes happen. As a reminder, Ninten…</span>

[Update #3: We have another restock! On October 7, 2022, the poster became available once again. It&#x27;s still 1000 Platinum Points.]
[Update #2: Nintendo has once again restocked the Metroid Dread poster as of the evening of November 10, 2021.]
[Update: The My Nintendo Metroid Dread poster just got a restock on October 19, 2021! This thing has been going for $50 or more on eBay as a set (or $25 individually), so maybe consider getting in on it.]
Welcome back to the &#x27;90s, where everything is holographic! Nintendo is celebrating the launch of Metroid Dread with a new My Nintendo reward, which has become the new norm for first-party games. Given how popular they are on the shop, it&#x27;s no surprise that it&#x27;s a Metroid Dread poster set.
As a two-pack for a whopping 1000 Platinum Points (plus shipping), you can get two holographic foil Metroid Dread poster rewards. Both feature art from the game, including Samus squaring off against two of the main enemies from the game: the mysterious Chozo remnants and the E.M.M.I. robots. The posters are sized at 11.75&quot; x 18&quot;, and Nintendo also has a few digital wallpapers on the same reward site.
As a reminder, you can find our full Platinum Point guide here: bookmark it for when you need quick points for a reward, like the Metroid Dread poster two-pack here. A handful of points is incredibly easy to get, as that’s basically just 15 minutes with Super Mario Run, or a quick sign-on to the 3DS or Wii U 3Shop. Also remember that any shipments are bundled together, so you can pay a flat rate for multiple items instead of paying it each time.
Just know that items go out of stock on My Nintendo frequently, and some are never restocked.

Back in the early Overwatch days, something I would look forward to every year was the seasonal events, particularly the ones that had PvE, story mode-type missions. Overwatch’s characters are a big part of what makes the game feel so special. The game was always more than just the multiplayer experience — it was the comics and the animated shorts and the seasonal story events, too. Having opportunities to dive into battle and see not only the history of the characters and the maps from the game, but actually seeing them work together as a team in-universe — that was a pretty magical feeling, if you ask me.
Even with all the new changes Blizzard promised when it came to the PvP, I was most excited to see some kind of story mode in Overwatch 2. I…</span>

The internet&#x27;s response to the trailer for The Super Mario Bros. Movie was pretty darn good... except for the much-awaited debut of Chris Pratt as Mario. The response to his choice of voice (which is, well, Chris Pratt with a bit of a Brooklyn accent) was lukewarm, at best, not helped by Pratt&#x27;s own lukewarm intro to the trailer in which he said he loved stomping Koopas in the arcade game — which, by the way, is impossible; they didn&#x27;t have Koopas in the arcade game, actually.
But it turns out that a lot of people out there think that Mario sort of sounds like... Linda Belcher from Bob&#x27;s Burgers.

There are two ways that life goes for visual novel protagonists. Either they wake up in a world where all their classmates are beautiful anime girls who want to jump their bones, or they find themselves in a twisted supernatural murder mystery. Unfortunately for Takumi Nishijou, the protagonist of Chaos;Head Noah, he’s stuck in the latter. What plays out is a very good, if narratively inconsistent, story that is gripping and disturbing in equal measures.
Despite being the first game in the Science Adventure series which includes the excellent Steins;Gate, this is the first time that Chaos;Head Noah has had an official English release. Spike Chunsoft has done the localisation work to bring this game and its indirect sequel Chaos;Child to the rest of the world. Chaos;Head Noah is a remaster of the original, which includes HD upgraded visuals that look sharp and crisp either in docked or handheld mode. They fare slightly better in handheld, with the Switch proving once again to be the perfect console for visual novels. Both games are available individually on eShop or bundled together in one text-heavy physical Double Pack.

After what feels like a long wait of cautious optimism and nerves, No Man&#x27;s Sky is finally out on Switch and Hello Games is introducing a new update to go alongside it. While the update is set to go live on all previous consoles immediately, the team has pointed out that it may take a little longer in landing on Switch:

The Waypoint update is currently through certification with Nintendo and is awaiting release, which should be very soon and within the launch window.

                              <span>Oof, cheeky!
Valve Corporation has provided Steam Deck fans with some pretty big news, confirming that orders for the handheld beast will now be processed and shipped without reservation, bringing an end to lengthy wait times for prospective owners.
A new trailer for the device has been launched to promote the update, and eagle-eyed viewers have noticed something rather interesting on the dock screen. As highlighted by Nibel on Twitter, an icon for a Switch emulator called Yuzu can be seen on the right-hand side of the screen.

                              <span>To celebrate our Bayonetta 3 cover story, we&#x27;re bringing back good old-fashioned Replay to revisit its direct predecessor, Bayonetta 2. You can tune in on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central to join in on the fun, or catch the archive when it hits on our Game Informer Shows YouTube channel. 
Released in October 2014 as a Wii U exclusive, Bayonetta 2 is a sequel that almost didn&#x27;t happen. Despite a strong critical reception to the first game, sales didn&#x27;t meet expectations, leading to publisher Sega passing on a follow-up. Thankfully, Nintendo swooped in to fund and publish Bayonetta 2, locking it in as a third-party exclusive. Bayonetta 2 features improved combat, new features, an even nuttier plot, and a near-bottomless well of action. Join me, Marcus Stewart, as I dig into my personal GOTY for 2014 and chat all about our Bayonetta 3 cover.

                              <span>Mortal Kombat was released three decades ago, in October of 1992, and its gory style of fighting has persisted through the years, through controversies, movies, and more. 
The NetherRealm-developed series celebrates its 30th anniversary this month, and the studio has released a new trailer to highlight the legacy of the franchise and bathe players in nostalgia and hype. If you&#x27;re looking for a special Mortal Kombat announcement, though, keep your expectations in check. Maybe something like that comes at a later date this month – who knows? – but today&#x27;s trailer is all about Mortal Kombat&#x27;s 30-year history in video games and other entertainment mediums. 
Check out the Mortal Kombat 30th Anniversary trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, the video above doesn&#x27;t announce any new movies or games, or even DLC for Mortal Kombat 11, but that&#x27;s okay because it&#x27;s still a great watch nonetheless, especially for longtime fans. 
Here are some fun Mortal Kombat 30th Anniversary logos as well:

Launch into the action quickly with an existing difficulty preset, or tinker with everything from economy to combat challenge to survival difficulty to perfect your experience.&quot; 
Alongside today&#x27;s Switch release and Waypoint update, Hello Games has released a new trailer giving a tease of what to expect in the 4.0 version of the game: 


As you can see, Waypoint is bringing a lot of changes to No Man&#x27;s Sky. Alongside game mode customization, there are also new seamless auto-saves, the launch of trade rockets, a new inventory overhaul with streamlined item management, unique Switch rewards, and so much more.

                              <span>Nintendo has revealed what the next Splatoon 3 Splatfest will have players battling over and it begins next month. 
More specifically, it begins November 11 at 4 p.m. PT/7 p.m. ET. This is perfect timing because it&#x27;s a three-way battle between Grass-type Pokémon, Fire-type Pokémon, and Water-type Pokémon, the types of the three starters we&#x27;ll be choosing from in Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet on November 18. Check out the announcement tweet for yourself below: 
Grass-type. Fire-type. Water-type. This debate has perplexed our great philosophers for ages. Let’s settle it.
#Splatfest collaboration begins 11/11 at 4pm PT!

October 7, 2022
The event will begin on November 11 and it will run through 4 p.m. PT/7 p.m. ET on November 13. While nothing is confirmed just yet, the image released alongside today&#x27;s news seems to tease some Pokémon-inspired gear. Hopefully, we all get to show off our favorite of the three types in our gear and weapons of choice. It&#x27;s also worth noting that Nintendo calls this Splatfast a &quot;special...collaboration&quot; so there might be even more  Pokémon integration than we expect. Only time will tell. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer&#x27;s Splatoon 3 review and then watch this 14-minute Pokémon Scarlet and Violet trailer released yesterday.

With just two weeks to go until the October 21 release date, marketing for Gotham Knights has begun to ramp up. We recently went hands-on with the game, and you can read our impressions and key takeaways about how it plays now, and recent videos have shared some of the behind-the-scenes inspirations for the game&#x27;s narrative design. But now, as the official release date draws nearer, WB Games Montréal is bringing the hype. 
Check out the Gotham Knights launch trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Gotham Knights&#x27; story of the Court of Owls and how they interact with both the Gotham Knights – Batgirl, Nightwing, Robin, and Red Hood – as well as other Gotham villain mainstays like Penguin, Mr. Freeze, Clayface, and Harley Quinn is shaping up to be something exciting for the Bat-verse of games. Fortunately, we don&#x27;t have to wait too much longer now to experience it for ourselves because Gotham Knights hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on October 21. 
Which of the Gotham Knights will you be maining? Let us know in the comments below!</span>

                              <span>Hideo Kojima and Kojima Productions have revealed that Elle Fanning (Maleficent, The Great, Daddy Day Care) will star in the studio&#x27;s next game, which remains unannounced. 
This news comes after weeks of Kojima teasing a face with the words, &quot;Who Am I?&quot; in bold white letters. The face was obscured due to some neat shadow tricks, but right from the jump, fans tried determining whose face it might be, and it didn&#x27;t take long for Fanning to become the frontrunner. Continual teasing led us to yesterday, when Kojima finally released the images below, confirming Fanning as the face in question.

                              <span>I keep forgetting Valkyrie Elysium&#x27;s PC release date is later than its console one. The action platformer came out on PlayStation late last week, but it&#x27;s not coming to Steam until November 11th. So far, reviews have been quite middling, which isn&#x27;t wholly surprising in some sense, but having played the public demo the other week, I&#x27;m not ashamed to say that I had a pretty all right time with it! Based on two hours of play time, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s very much in the same kind of vein as your Bayonettas and Nier: Automatas, and I&#x27;m 100% down for that.

                              <span>It feels odd saying &quot;Overwatch 1&quot;, but Overwatch 1 occupies an important place in my personal and professional life. And all things considered, I do not miss it in the slightest. I spent so much time straining against the game&#x27;s tug-of-war matches that I simply grew tired of trying really hard at it - or perhaps more accurately, trying not to launch my head through the nearest plaster wall.
Clearly, there was a time where I adored Overwatch, though. A time when I&#x27;d grind solo-queue most evenings until 3am, in a bid to climb the ranks ever higher. To what end? My own personal satisfaction, I suppose. I&#x27;d eventually hit Master (let me brag just once, okay) and then a few months later, I applied for a job at Gamer Network writing guides about Overwatch&#x27;s intricacies. I moved to Brighton for my first proper job. Now, with Overwatch 2&#x27;s release, it all feels like it&#x27;s come full circle.

                              <span>Archtower is a roguelike and therefore bad, but... hnnnnnnngggh I like it. I might even come to love it, considering it&#x27;s already so enjoyable even with a few years of early access left (a fact I forgot until I reached a &quot;work in progress&quot; marker several hours in).
You climb a tower and splat monsters and culty magic nerds. You loot, and avoid traps, chug red liquids, and occasionally die and have to start again. But I enjoyed every moment, and never once hit the usual aggravating points that push me out of the genre. It&#x27;s good stuff all round, frankly.

                              <span>A new experience: Weird RPG is the first video game to make my lips numb. My character in the action-RPG is wearing magic tousers, see, which launch explosive basketball hoops every time I make noise into my microphone. Turns out, the most DPS-efficient noise is continually blowing to trill my lips like a child pretending to be a car. Weird RPG does have some fun ideas but sadly, it&#x27;s too mundane an ARPG to be truly weird—or good. Still, I was delighted when I found a helmet whose stats get better the worse your graphics card is.

                              <span>Scrolling through Twitter, Daniel Griffiths&#x27; interest was piqued when he saw a post describing a mysterious phenomenon being shared in the Nier: Automata community: A2 opening a hidden door in The Copied City and strolling into a secret, never-before-seen area. Curious, he decided to pursue more knowledge, and landed in the Nier modding Discord server. 


Like him, many other Nier: Automata players who caught wind of the phenomenon sat upright - metaphorically and perhaps literally - and flocked to both Reddit and Discord to check out what exactly was up with the secret area. It was dubbed the &quot;church mystery&quot; or &quot;sadfutago&#x27;s posts&quot;, among other monikers.

                              <span>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is an increasingly ancient beast, gnarled and twisted over the past decade-and-a-bit by many, many mods that sometimes conflict with one another. That’s why Tyler Hallada put together Modmapper, a free tool released earlier this year that shows which of the mods hosted at NexusMods affect which areas of Skyrim. Now, Hallada’s written about the experience of creating the tool in a blog post, and the reasons for taking on the project.

                              <span>Sci-fi thriller The Invincible is one of those games that feels like it&#x27;s been knocking around for absolutely yonks, and every time there&#x27;s a new trailer for it, you go, &quot;Oh yeah! That one! The one with the robots and the Soviet Alien dot detector thing!&quot; The most recent trailer for The Invincible arrived during this year&#x27;s E3 madness, and featured astrobiologist Yasna having a suspenseful encounter with a big spider bot and its anti-matter death ray. It was only a five-minute long clip at the time, but I&#x27;ve now played an expanded version of that particular scene, and yep, I still don&#x27;t much like the look of that there laser bot.

                              <span>Sci-fi survival sim No Man’s Sky sees the launch of its next major update today, and it’s about making things easier to do and doing them the way you want them. Key to this are custom game modes, auto-saves, dynamic difficulty, and inventory streamlining. There’s also a new relaxed mode for the particularly chilled among us. Watch the update trailer below for a rundown, and some trippy space visuals.

                              <span>Electronic Arts have formally launched their new store client doodad after a long open beta, replacing the much-maligned Origin with something they refer to as &quot;the EA app&quot; (its actual name is only &quot;EA&quot;). They say it&#x27;s faster and better. I think maybe it is? But it doesn&#x27;t really matter, as long as it&#x27;s not a disaster, because it&#x27;s not like you&#x27;re using it unless you have to anyway. Just like Origin before it, the new EA app is an inconvenience you must accept to play the EA games which require it, and beyond that it is useless. It does an okay job of that.

Ferret, a Zork-like text adventure, began development in 1982 for the Data General Nova 2. The game was put together by a group of software engineers from Data General’s UK-based Systems Division. Ferret only received a final functional release complete with an endgame in August this year, according to a post on the game’s Facebook community.

People who scanned a QR code on the standee image were directed to another picture on the Kojima Productions site, which shows Fanning’s face in red light and the message “Who am I?”.

The Ryzen 5 7600X is currently AMD&#x27;s most affordable Zen 4 processor at $299 USD and provides six cores / 12 threads and a boost clock up to 5.3GHz.</span>

                              <span>Now&#x27;s your chance to snap Deathloop for cheap
If you ask me, Humble Bundle is one of the best ways to get your games. If you need recommendations, they never steer you wrong with their pre-made bundles, they prop up small indie creators who likely wouldn&#x27;t get a platform otherwise, and a lot of times they raise a ton of money for worthy causes with their charity bundles. This October, they&#x27;re shining a light on one of the best games of last year: Deathloop, Arkane&#x27;s time-looping first-person shooter mystery roguelite.
That&#x27;s some serious video game word salad, but trust me when I say it delivers on all of those fronts. Deathloop is a slick, stylish game with a unique premise and some of the best game voice acting performances of late, and personally I feel like it deserved even more hype than it already got.
A lot of people may not know that you can even become a monthly subscriber to Humble Bundle Choice for $12 a month, which gives you a whole slew of free games every month that you get to keep after you&#x27;ve cancelled your subscription. Members also have access to a rotating library of games you can play, as well as discount codes. It&#x27;s another gaming subscription service, but overall it&#x27;s a good deal if you like the kinds of games that they have.

Enter Deathloop, one of the free games on offer this month, along with seven other titles:
The Dark Pictures Anthology: Little Hope
Disciples: Liberation
Epic Chef
Golf Gang
Maid of Sker
Monster Train First Class (Collector&#x27;s Edition)
Railroad Corporation
If you&#x27;ve yet to play Deathloop, this is a great opportunity to give it a try. Even if you&#x27;re only subscribed for a month, you&#x27;ll get all of the games on offer for $12, plus all the other benefits listed above, so it seems pretty worth it to me.

                              <span>Turns out I&#x27;m 100% a gamer
Lizzo has been one of the most prolific pop artists of the last few years, releasing bop after endlessly catchy bop. She made news recently by elegantly playing the former president James Madison&#x27;s crystal flute in the Library of Congress, reminding us that she&#x27;s not just a great performer, but also a highly trained musician. Lizzo has brought fresh, bright sounds to pop that have been missing for a while, and she&#x27;s also done a lot to give back after all of her success. If you can&#x27;t tell, I&#x27;m a big fan of hers, so it&#x27;s cool to see her influence cross over into the games space. Considering Lizzo&#x27;s contributions to modern pop music, it was only a matter of time that she was immortalized by one of the highest honors in the land -- her own Beat Saber DLC pack.
As something of a Beat Saber aficionado myself, I can say with confidence that Lizzo&#x27;s upbeat, bubbly, and groovy pop songs are nothing short of perfect for the VR rhythm game. The pack will also a include special environment that is themed after Lizzo&#x27;s newest album, Special, featuring purple and yellow blocks, a rainbow, and Lizzo&#x27;s name spelled out in lights.

The pack&#x27;s full track list includes:
&quot;Be Loved (Am I Ready)&quot;
&quot;About Damn Time&quot;
&quot;Cuz I Love You&quot;
&quot;Everybody&#x27;s Gay&quot;
&quot;Good as Hell&quot;
&quot;Juice&quot;
&quot;Tempo (ft. Missy Elliot)&quot;
&quot;Truth Hurts&quot;
&quot;Worship&quot;
The new song pack is out today, and goes for $11.99, or $1.99 per individual song. It&#x27;s been a minute since I&#x27;ve played because of how annoying it is to redownload my Beat Saber mods every time the game updates, but considering this is an officially released song pack that won&#x27;t give me that same issue, it might be time for me to dust off the Oculus after a few months away.

                              <span>The Mario movie leaps into action on April 7
Well, it&#x27;s finally here. Today, we got the world premiere trailer for The Super Mario Bros. Movie, from Nintendo and Illumination.
Shown off during a special Nintendo Direct today, we got a little bit of info from Shigeru Miyamoto and Illumination&#x27;s Chris Meledandri on the putting-together of this collaboration.
Then, we got to see the trailer. We see an intro scene of Bowser and Kamek arriving to overthrow a penguin kingdom, eventually grabbing a star in the process. Then, we pan over to see Chris Pratt&#x27;s Mario, hearing his take on the iconic plumber for the first time alongside a big look at the Mushroom Kingdom.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;yPpazvJrHm0
Mario goes to the movies
Reports of Nintendo and Illumination&#x27;s team-up first started in 2017. In the time since, we&#x27;ve had a few crumbs here and there, including a full voice cast reveal last year. Alongside Pratt&#x27;s role as Mario, several celebrities are set to lend their talents, ranging from Charlie Day as Luigi to Keegan-Michael Key as Toad. Both of those got a little spotlight in today&#x27;s trailer too, though the main show was Mario and Bowser.
The video game-movie adaptation pipeline has certainly grown over the last few years. Sonic the Hedgehog has had two major motion pictures and more is on the way, leading the way for many more. PlayStation has been kicking up its own productions, with an Uncharted movie already out and The Last of Us headed to HBO.
This obviously isn&#x27;t Mario&#x27;s first silver screen appearance, but it&#x27;s a pretty big one. I will say, Jack Black&#x27;s Bowser works pretty well for me. As for some of the others, I&#x27;m going to need to hear more (I was a little bummed we didn&#x27;t hear more of Day as Luigi, or see Princess Peach at all).
The Super Mario Bros. Movie hits theaters on April 7, 2023.

Valve has finally opened up orders for its official Steam Deck Dock. The page went live today, with reservations open for anyone who wants to pick up a new resting spot for Steam Deck.
The official Valve Steam Deck Dock goes for $89. As of the time of this writing, it lists an estimated delivery date of one to two weeks, though that could shift.
This USB-C Dock acts as an extension, essentially, for a Steam Deck. It&#x27;s got HDMI 2.0 and DisplayPort 1.4 connections for external displays, alongside three USB-A 3.1 Gen1 ports and a Gigabit Ethernet port.
Linking the Deck to the Deck is a USB-C captive cable with a special low-profile, right-angle connector so it slots in right on top. This also acts as a power delivery source.

Steam power
In an FAQ question on the order page, Valve confirms the Steam Deck Dock comes with both the Docking Station and a power supply cable, the same one as the one that came with the Deck.
While Valve says it&#x27;s tested on a wide range of displays and peripherals, it also asks users to note in the Steam forums if their setup is not compatible.
Importantly, the Docking Station will not increase the performance of the Steam Deck. The Dock just allows for charging and connectivity. The Dock can also be used without a power supply, though Valve notes the USB ports will have reduced throughput to conserve power in this configuration.
For those who haven&#x27;t got a Steam Deck yet, it also seems like orders are continuing to speed up. Users were reporting short delivery times earlier today, though that&#x27;s been shifting and will shift depending on demand. Valve has stated that it&#x27;s moving through reservations faster than expected, so this might be a decent time to try nabbing a Steam Deck for the holidays.

Bandai Namco Entertainment has announced that it has increased its stake in Limbic Entertainment, becoming a majority shareholder in the German studio, best known for the strategy sequel Tropico 6.
&quot;This investment is much more than a strategic move for Bandai Namco,&quot; writes Bandai Namco Entertainment Europe CEO Arnaud Muller in a press release. &quot;For the past three years, we have worked together on the creation of new IPs. The first game Park Beyond will be released in 2023 but there is much more to come. This investment is just the continuity of our existing relationship, and we will help Limbic become the new reference in strategy and simulation games.”
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;2ROFu9dnqxQ
&quot;With Bandai Namco we are very lucky to have a partner who shares our goals, values and commitment to develop amazing titles,&quot; agrees Limbic Entertainment co-founder and CEO Stephan Winter. &quot;Working together up to this point has already shown the trust and mutual respect that characterizes our relationship. Solidifying this bond gives us the opportunity to up our game — to plan even more ambitiously and bring Limbic Entertainment to the next level.&quot;
Bandai Namco previously purchased a minority stake in Limbic back in February 2021, as the studio began its work on the aforementioned new-gen park builder, Park Beyond, to be published by Bandai Namco once development is complete. Clearly, over the ensuing time period, the publisher has seen potential in Limbic, and has thus taken steps to tuck the indie outfit and its 100-strong staff further under its wing.
Park Beyond is currently in development for PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X.

Devolver Digital&#x27;s comically unnerving roguelike, Cult of the Lamb, has ironically become something of a cult hit itself, winning over fans with its creepy-cute visuals, anarchic attitude, and engaging gameplay — In fact, Massive Monster&#x27;s indie hit has already bagged its first Game of the Year award, courtesy of the Australian Game Developer Awards.
The event, which took place on the evening on October 4, recognized the best of interactive entertainment from 2022 to date, focusing mostly on the output of independent studios working within the region. Cult of the Lamb scuttled off with four well-deserved gongs, including Excellence in Art, Excellence in Music, Excellence in Gameplay, and the aforementioned Game of the Year award.

                              <span>When Bayonetta 3&#x27;s first gameplay trailer hit last year, her new braided hairstyle caught the attention of fans for its resemblance to the look of Cereza, the little girl who tagged along with players in the first game. Spoiler for Bayonetta 1: Cereza is the child version of Bayonetta, so perhaps our hero simply wanted to return to her adolescent roots. However, the third game&#x27;s focus on the multiverse has prompted some fans to consider a more tantalizing theory. 
First, to provide some context, here&#x27;s a (relatively) quick refresher of Bayonetta&#x27;s backstory for newcomers or lapsed fans. Five hundred years prior to the events of the first game, Bayonetta, whose real name is Cereza, was born the child of an Umbra Witch and a Lumen Sage.

                              <span>Nintendo has released the first trailer for its upcoming Super Mario Bros. movie and it features plenty of the famed plumber as well as Toad, Luigi, Bowser, the Mushroom Kingdom, and more. It also features our first listen to Chris Pratt&#x27;s Mario.
Pratt teased back in June that his Mario voice is &quot;unlike anything you&#x27;ve heard in the Mario world,&quot; and it turns out he&#x27;s right in that we&#x27;ve never heard Pratt&#x27;s voice in the world of Mario, which is to say his Mario just sounds like him. Elsewhere in the trailer, which aired during a special Nintendo Direct all about the film today, we get a glimpse at the movie&#x27;s villain, Bowser, who is voiced by Jack Black, Toad, voiced by Keegan-Michael Key, and even a quick shot at Luigi at the end. 
Check out the Super Mario Bros. movie trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Super Mario Bros. looks like you&#x27;d expect, in line with Illumination&#x27;s other animated movies like Despicable Me and Minions. It looks like it will be a great time at the theater, making the wait until its silver screen release on April 7 that much harder.

                              <span>EA has officially revealed Need For Speed Unbound, the first new Need For Speed game in three years, and it hits new-gen consoles and PC this December. 
After leaking earlier this week, EA has released the official reveal trailer for Need For Speed and as leaks and rumors suggested, it&#x27;s quite a drastic shift in style for the series. It features the slick realistic visuals fans of the series know quite well but this time, it&#x27;s mixed with an almost anime-like animation style. It looks great, in my opinion, but it likely won&#x27;t be for everybody. 
Check out the Need For Speed Unbound reveal trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Unbound represents a pretty drastic departure for the series in terms of visuals but elsewhere, it looks like Need For Speed. There seems to be plenty of car customization, cops to run from, city streets to speed through, and if the reveal trailer&#x27;s song by A$AP Rocky is any indication, a great soundtrack.
Only time will tell but fortunately, we don&#x27;t have to wait too long because Need For Speed Unbound hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on December 2. As you might have noticed, the reveal trailer doesn&#x27;t mention consoles from the previous generation, like the PlayStation 4 or Xbox One, so you might need a current-gen machine to play the game.

                              <span>Since the launch of Overwatch 2 earlier this week, the game has struggled in a number of ways. Some players are excited about the numbered sequel while others wonder why this wasn&#x27;t just a big update for the original Overwatch, which is no longer accessible. Regardless, actually playing Overwatch 2 has been its own challenge due to at least two DDoS attacks Blizzard has weathered, making it tough to actually queue into the game and access it beyond the eternal loading screen. 
On top of that, some players have found themselves unable to play once logged in due to the game&#x27;s SMS Protect system, which requires you to give Blizzard a &quot;unique&quot; phone number for authentication purposes.

At the tail end of 2021, AMD announced the Accelerator Cloud as a way for trying out the latest EPYC CPUs and Instinct accelerators complete with a pre-configured ROCm compute software stack. The AMD Cloud Platform is a currently parallel effort to the Accelerator Cloud with the former intended more for developers while the latter is more customer-oriented. After trying out the AMD Cloud Platform, it&#x27;s indeed an easy way to evaluate the latest AMD data center wares while having a easy-to-deploy, pre-configured software environment.</span>

No longer. Valve say that they&#x27;ve increased their manufacturing capacity such that you can now buy a Steam Deck without a reservation.

They&#x27;ve also made the Steam Deck&#x27;s dock available to purchase. It costs $80/£80 and has the same 1-2 week delivery estimate as the Deck itself.

                              <span>Prison Architect&#x27;s next expansion will arrive on October 11th, just in time for spooky season. The timing is significant because the DLC is called Undead and its main new feature is zombies.

                              <span>Far Cry 6&#x27;s Game Of The Year edition is out now, which is great news for people who have £100 to spend and who have never felt regret. That&#x27;s how much it will cost you to buy the package from the Epic Games Store. It includes the base game and the three pieces of DLC released thus far. More interestingly, it also includes a new expansion that hasn&#x27;t even been announced yet.

                              <span>When the mysterious sci-fi action shooter Scars Above was first unveiled during Geoffcom&#x27;s Opening Night Live at the end of August, I thought it had big Returnal energy. Based on the reveal trailer, it certainly seemed to be riffing on several of the same themes as Housemarque&#x27;s challenging PlayStation exclusive - what with its lone female scientist stranded on an alien planet schtick, third-person shooting, and big eerie alien monsters after her etc. - so when I saw it was part of this month&#x27;s Steam Next Fest demo bonanza, I knew I had to give it a try. And while it certainly captures the same kind of atmosphere as Returnal, I&#x27;m sorry to say that&#x27;s about as far as the comparison goes, as the rest of Scars Above is a much slower, more traditional kind of space action game.

Pre-orderers can play the campaign a week early, technically, but that’s still a good couple of weeks away as well. By the way, could you help me out? I can’t remember the actor who’s playing the shouty general’s name and it’s really bothering me. He’s in the trailer below, watch it and let me know in the comments please.

                              <span>Let&#x27;s be clear about one thing: whatever else I say today doesn&#x27;t deny that building games are in a great state right now. Within just the last few years, we&#x27;ve not only had many releases, but an impressive proportion of well-designed, enjoyable games made with obvious care and enthusiasm. Things, in a word, are good. And yet I keep coming back to Ostriv, and Workers &amp; Resources. Neither are out of early access yet. But they&#x27;ve had me contemplating the nature of a settlement, and the complex relationships between people, leaders, and the land itself, where so many of their peers feel like a dispassionate excercise in placing tokens.
Building games are doing well. But they could be doing more.

Yep, Need For Speed Unbound is looking pretty cel-shaded, with little cartoon streams of dust flying up from the wheels of your speeding vehicle. Substantially pimped-out vehicle, might I add, courtesy of rapper and general lad A$AP Rocky. Take a look at his motor in the trailer below.

We&#x27;re talking favourites from Infinity Ward, Sledgehammer Games, and Treyarch, all rolled into one mega-bundle.
Of course, it&#x27;s only a rumour, which means it could be debunked at any moment. But it did get Hayden and I – the resident codders of the RPS Treehouse – thinking. If this rumour turns out to be true, which maps would we like to see return for Modern Warfare 2?

Y’see, Biotech introduces pregnancy, child-rearing, and families. It isn’t stopping there, because there’s also genetic engineering now. Your character will be able to psychically command semi-living machines too thanks to a special implant, making them your thralls. That’s one word for it, anyway.

                              <span>We&#x27;re back with a bang, a villainous laugh, and a dose of coronavirus I&#x27;ve brought back from somewhere in Tenerife. The two week drought is broken with a shower of Electronic Wireless Show podcast rain, were we discuss the best villainous breakdowns we&#x27;ve enjoyed in video games. Matthew is sadly away this week because, while my coronavirus dose is mild, like the tingle of delicious Rio Tropical on your tongue, Matthew&#x27;s is wild and aggressive, like a super-charged Electricity Cop.
In his absence, Nate and I talk about some proper good villains, and even discuss some sensible things like evil cartoon monsters vs. villains you can sort of sympathise with. Handsome Jack? GLaDOS? LeChuck? Andrew Ryan? That&#x27;s one hell of an awkward dinner party. Plus stick around for a Cavern Of Lies that proves Warhammer 40k is essentially the same as Tumblr.

You can now go head to head in a sequence of four stages, pitting you against familiar bosses and their enhanced versions. Oh, and there’s a humongous fancy statue to decorate for some reason. Get your dander up by watching the trailer below.

                              <span>Last month, I enjoyed playing Card Cowboy, a wee wild west adventure which uses cards to tell silly stories. As you cross the land in search of revenge, you build a hand of cards representing resources and events, which you use to resolve situations—often with strange and surprising results. What does happen if you try to lasso a villain with a mezcal worm? That free version was fun, and now the devs have expanded it into a £2 paid version with new cards, conundrums, and voice acting. It too is fun!

Ahead of Modern Warfare 2’s eruption on October 28th, rumours are circulating that Sledgehammer Games will return to the near-future world of their 2014 boots-off-the-ground instalment, Call Of Duty: Advanced Warfare. COD help us all.

The company originally insisted on all players providing a phone number as part of the hero shooter’s new anti-cheat system, dubbed Defense Matrix. The planned change should go into effect from October 7th.

The laundry list of issues that the team are investigating this month has a raft of fun werewolf-centric bugs like humans being able to sniff each other, and a wolf getting mad that he&#x27;s the bottom (of the pack) even though he&#x27;s the alpha. The High School Years update from July is also facilitating accidental sibling incest, still, after one method of sibling highschool be-sandwiching was fixed in August. It appears to be an entrenched problem. Those kids must really like House Of The Dragon.

Jsou mimo jiné ukrytá v tisících informačních systémů, za jejichž vznik a údržbu stát ročně zaplatí miliardy korun. Mnoho dat se ale do těchto systémů zadává špatně či neúplně, některá zcela chybí. Jiná jsou duplicitní, další si protiřečí. A o tom, jak jsou na tom tyto systémy s uživatelským komfortem, a do kolika z nich může veřejnost alespoň trošku nahlédnout, o tom snad ani není třeba mluvit. Hackathon už několik ročníků ukazuje, jaké přínosy a výhody může mít pro stát i občany to, když stát otevře a zpřístupní svá data. Jak se tato data dají využít k novým poznatkům, k tvorbě aplikací a systémů, ke zkvalitnění prostředí, ve kterém vy, daňoví poplatníci, žijete&quot;.</span>

                              <span>Over at Eurogamer, I kind of have a thing for LG&#x27;s Fast IPS screens. This tech combines the best feature of TN panels - their incredibly fast pixel response times - with the traditional advantages of an IPS screen, namely gorgeous colours and wide viewing angles. These screens pop up in LG&#x27;s 27GL850 and 27GL83A monitors, but are also used in Dell&#x27;s even better S2721DGFA - and it&#x27;s this monitor that&#x27;s on sale today. With a code available here, you can take an extra £30 off a model that&#x27;s already seen an £80 discount, dropping the price from £380 to £268 - an incredible deal for a monitor of this specification. I used the code $6ZZXZWLF0WV7D, but your code is likely to be different!
So what is this specification? Well, the S2721DGFA exists right at the sweet spot for gaming monitors too, with a 27-inch screen size, 2560x1440 resolution and 165Hz refresh rate. This spec is good because it&#x27;s not too hard to drive, even with a mid-range gaming PC, but you still get a noticeable increase in clarity and fluidity compared to your standard 1080p 60Hz monitors. And with the Fast IPS screen that I was talking about earlier, you have a monitor that&#x27;s equally well-suited to fast-paced, competitive shooters as it is slower-paced and more atmospheric games from a wide range of genres.

I have gone on about the Dell S2721DGFA a few times now, so I&#x27;ll link to those previous posts so you can find out a little bit more about this monitor - and see how much it used to cost too! Suffice it to say, if you have a look at some reviews you&#x27;ll see that I&#x27;m far from the only fan of this model, so I hope this deal is useful to you! Thanks for joining me once again and I&#x27;ll see you tomorrow for more deals.

                              <span>The Crucial X6 is one of the best portable SSDs on the market, and a ginormous 2TB model is currently discounted to £129 at Amazon, from its normal price of £150. This makes it the cheapest 2TB portable SSD by a significant margin, with alternatives like the Samsung T7 and SanDisk Extreme 2TB costing £191 or more - and an excellent value for a drive of this calibre.

It also reveals some co-op hunting action for the first time. Take a look at the footage below, and try not to giggle when the sproingy hammer whacks the giant piggy.

                              <span>Soccer sim FIFA 23 has been given its first patch since the Day One update, but don’t expect to encounter any earth-shattering changes when you next take to the pitch. Described as a “live tuning update”, the patch adjusts the difficulty of penalties and fiddles with dribbling speed for some players. These changes are already live in the game, but you’ll need to restart your FIFA session when the tuning update message pops up to apply it.

                              <span>Moonbreaker is an early access turn-based tabletop game by the Subnautica devs, and before you ask, no there isn&#x27;t a Blue Eyes White Basking Shark piece that inhales everything on the board. There are, however, plenty of sci-fi people who wield spears and guns and do battle by spending a currency called Cinder, if that&#x27;s your jam.
Whether you&#x27;re new to tabletop strategy or already like bashing miniatures together, the game makes for a perfectly enjoyable time. I just don&#x27;t know whether it goes beyond &quot;perfectly enjoyable&quot; into &quot;thrilling&quot;, though, and that may be down to its lack of, well, lots of things. Give it time and it may just evolve into a game of serious depth but right now it&#x27;s a bit too miniature to recommend wholeheartedly.

                              <span>Somewhere at the edges of the galaxy in No Man&#x27;s Sky lies a large, verdant planet with an abandoned, but functioning, starter ship on it. I left it there in 2016 after discovering a larger ship out in the wilds, but it&#x27;s a decision that still haunts me to this very day. You see, I was so taken with my new set of wings that I failed to notice it didn&#x27;t have a functioning hyperdrive attached, which is needed to punch through the atmosphere to visit another solar system. It also turned out that this particular planet didn&#x27;t have any of the necessary resources to craft a new one either, leaving my only form of escape back in my tiny little starter ship – which, of course, was now nowhere to be seen. I spent hours looking for that little ship, but the planet was so vast that I never saw it again. 
Upcoming aerial survival game Forever Skies doesn&#x27;t have lots of large planets to lose your only means of transportation in, thankfully. In its Steam Next Fest demo at least, the only things I was able to land my makeshift aircraft on were tiny, rusty platforms perched atop decaying skyscrapers on an Earth ruined by disease and an ecological apocalypse. But that fear of getting stranded somewhere I shouldn&#x27;t be has never left me, and I&#x27;d be lying if I said I wasn&#x27;t just a teensy bit scared of jumping down from my ship and finding I wasn&#x27;t able to get back up to it again.

This time, the immersive sim shenanigans are going open-world. The Steam page also provides some inkling of what else is coming when the game launches in 2023. Did I mention it’s coming out in 2023?

The delay was announced along with the reveal of a closed technical test for Freelancer starting early next month. And here I was, thinking that Ian Hitman never missed a target.

                              <span>Last month, Rachel and I made the long pilgrammage to Seattle in order to attend PAX West 2022. While we were there we ran around the show floor with a bag full of loose camera equipment, stopping frequently to enthuse about cool video games we&#x27;d discovered or to interview someone interesting. At the time, all of these videos were only accessible to our premium supporters. However, as 30 days have passed since we originally shared them, we&#x27;re now making them free for everyone to enjoy. Surprise!
From an interview with the voice cast of Team Fortress 2 to a comprehensive tour of the show floor, there&#x27;s something for everyone in this bundle of audio-visual delights. Scroll down to see what we got up to, and remember, if you like what you see please do consider funding content like this via our supporters programme. It truly means an awful lot.

According to president of Blizzard Entertainment Mike Ybarra, however, today&#x27;s launch issues are being made worse by a &quot;mass DDoS attack&quot; on their servers.

DISH will now take control of the service&#x27;s domains but whether it will see any of the $26.5m awarded by a New York court remains to be seen.

                              <span>Earthlink has settled a piracy liability lawsuit filed by several movie companies this summer. While there is no mention of damages, the ISP has agreed to ask its wholesale providers to block access to the notorious pirate site YTS. The providers are not named but Earthlink sells or resold AT&amp;T and Time Warner Cable infrastructure.

                              <span>Last week, Google announced it plans to shut down Stadia on January 18. One of the less-discussed casualties of the news was that Tequila Works’ Gylt, a horror adventure game and the first Stadia-exclusive title, would disappear entirely. Thankfully, that won’t be the case.
Tequila Works has confirmed that it plans to make Gylt multiplatform in 2023. It doesn’t specify which platforms the game will become available on, but it’s a relief to know that one of Stadia’s few original gems won’t be lost to history. 
🎃 We bring terrific news: GYLT is going multiplatform in 2023! More info to come in the upcoming months.https://t.co/ON1pbiGsB9 pic.twitter.com/2sWdseym2G
October 4, 2022
Gylt launched in November 2019 alongside Stadia. It stars a young girl named Sally who searches for her missing cousin across a town haunted by evil spirits. The narrative also serves a commentary on bullying and depresssion. The game’s vibe and art direction evoke films like Coraline or Tim Burton’s animated works and channels games like Inside and Silent Hill. Gameplay emphasizes stealth, with players using a flashlight to defeat enemies. Despite its more innocent veneer, the game has its share of genuinely creepy moments, and I personally found it to be an enjoyable horror romp.
Will you be checking out Gylt before Stadia shuts down or wait to play it elsewhere next year? Let us know in the comments!</span>

                              <span>Sony announced its new gaming loyalty program, PlayStation Stars, back in July, and the service is now live in North and South America. PlayStation users can sign up for the free program, but there’s one big caveat.
PlayStation Stars allows players to earn points and digital collectibles by completing “campaigns,” which range from completing small objectives while playing games to larger monthly challenges. Any PlayStation player can join Stars; you don’t need a Plus subscription. 
Completing campaigns also raises your Star Status, a leveling system consisting of four ranks. Everyone begins at Level 1, but doing things like purchasing games from PSN or earning a certain number of trophy rarities raises this level, increasing the quality of rewards you earn. 
Digital rewards, which Sony confirmed are not NFTs and cannot be resold, include models of old PlayStation consoles and characters from first-party titles. You can also redeem points to use as funds for your digital store wallet and to purchase DLC. Points remain available for 24 months after earning them. 
If you’re running to sign up now, there’s already a waitlist to join PS Stars. Sony states that new users will have to wait about two months after the date they register to be accepted into the program. It&#x27;s unclear why this is the case, but one could assume Sony doesn&#x27;t want to be flooded with too many memberships at once as it gradually gets the program off the ground. Registration also doesn&#x27;t seem consistent yet, as some folks were immediately let in while others have been told to wait (and some others still can&#x27;t access Stars in parts of the U.S. as of publishing). 
PlayStation Stars will launch in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand next week on October 13. To learn more about the program, including its handy FAQ, you can visit its official site here.</span>

Gotham Knights launches in just a couple of weeks, and Batman fans have been excited – and trepidatious – about the Bat clan’s big family adventure. To find out how the project is shaping up, I took a trip to Warner Bros. Montreal to play two hours of the game. I spent time-fighting crime as all four characters, explored Gotham’s open world, and took down criminals alongside a co-op partner. I also chatted with the dev team to uncover more nuggets about what the adventure brings to the table. Here are some general hands-on impressions and intr…</span>

                              <span>Bandai Namco has released a new trailer for the new-gen release of Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot alongside news that it hits PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S in January. 
More specifically, Kakarot comes to new-gen consoles on January 13, 2023, meaning we&#x27;re just a few months away from this re-release. To accompany today&#x27;s news, Bandai Namco has released a new trailer showcasing some of DBZ&#x27;s most iconic moments alongside some comparison clips between the PlayStation 4/Xbox One version of Kakarot and the upcoming new-gen update. Unsurprisingly, it looks a lot better. 
Check it out for yourself below: 


Kakarot on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S features updated visuals that look even better than the original release and 60 frames-per-second gameplay. If you already own the game, you can upgrade to the new-gen version of Kakarot for free. 
This new trailer also teases what&#x27;s to come in the game&#x27;s second season pass. The first DLC is called Bardock: Alone Against Fate, and it&#x27;s a new story arc. Two more story arc DLCs are in the season pass as well. Plus, Season Pass 2 owners will get a cooking item that increases HP and Ki defense. 
While waiting for January, read Game Informer&#x27;s Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot review to find out why we think the game is flawed but still highly enthralling.

                              <span>Dynasty Warriors developer Omega Force and EA revealed Wild Hearts last week, giving players a glimpse of what&#x27;s to come in this new beast-hunting game. 
Similar to Capcom&#x27;s Monster Hunter series, the central draw of Wild Hearts is the massive creatures and how you successfully hunt them down. You craft new weapons and armor along the way, growing stronger and stronger with each hunt, as you attempt to rid the land of Azuma of these beasts. The reveal trailer released last week gave some quick glimpses of what that looks like, but a new gameplay trailer showcases seven minutes of Wild Hearts gameplay. 
Check it out for yourself below:

Instead, the Umbra Witch is brought to life by veteran performer Jennifer Hale.
“Various overlapping circumstances made it difficult for Hellena Taylor to reprise her role,” says game director Yusuke Miyata. “We held auditions to cast the new voice of Bayonetta and offered the role to Jennifer Hale, whom…</span>

Newcomer developer Stubby Games and publisher Playstack revealed The Entropy Centre during the Future Games Showcase in June, and it immediately caught my attention. On the one hand, it seemed to wear its Portal-inspiration on its sleeve, an immediate draw for me. On the other hand, its concept as a puzzle game sounded new and unique: use a weapon that turns back time on individual objects aboard a space station to stop the Earth from exploding.
I continued to cover the game and its various trailer drops, excited to finally go hands-on with it, wondering if it’d live up…</span>

                              <span>Put a screenshot of Overwatch 2 next to a screenshot of Overwatch 1, and you&#x27;d be hard-pressed to spot any difference. Both display a vast chaotic ballet, in which two teams composed of some of the most well-realised characters in hero shooters wage war until one team emerges triumphant. Just like its predecessor, Overwatch 2 is one of the most delicately crafted sensory onslaughts I&#x27;ve experienced in a game.
Guiding my old favourite heroes through venerable maps like King&#x27;s Row and Route 66, it&#x27;s like I never left. In many ways, it feels like I&#x27;ve simply been given a reason to play Overwatch 1 again. Is that enough for a sequel? Is it enough to justify the incredibly confusing, lengthy, and oft-botched process of trying to make Overwatch feel relevant again? I&#x27;m not certain it is. But perhaps it should be.

Overwatch took the gaming world by storm when it launched in 2016, thanks to its well-balanced roster of unique heroes and terrific objective-based, first-person-shooting gameplay. The game’s popularity endured through the years thanks to a wealth of new content like characters, maps, cosmetics, and game modes, adding to the terrific foundation. However, once the content dried up for Overwatch, the public interest followed shortly afterward. Overwatch 2 represents the re-emergence of one of…</span>

                              <span>Your host Wesley LeBlanc is joined by Game Informer editor Marcus Stewart to discuss Nier Automata: The End of YoRHa Edition, a new version of the game exclusive to Switch. The two discuss how the game runs and looks on Switch, how the experience holds up five years after its original release, and whether Nier Automata is still worth playing all these years later. 
While Nier Automat has, over the year, hit PlayStation and Xbox consoles, as well as PC, it has yet to reach a Nintendo platform...that is until this Thursday, October 6, when The End of YoRHa Edition is released. As for what to expect, this new edition of Nier Automata includes the following:
Nier Automata base game
All previously released DLC
New costumes exclusive to Switch
If you&#x27;re wondering whether Switch is the platform to play this on for newcomers, or if you&#x27;re wondering whether this new release is worth a replay, we have you covered in the latest New Gameplay Today, which you can watch below. Enjoy!

                              <span>The year 1985 contained so many cultural touchstones: Queen’s legendary Live Aid performance, Coca-Cola’s infamous New Coke release, the first-ever WrestleMania, and much more. Likely the most crucial moment to readers of Game Informer was the debut of the Nintendo Entertainment System.
The NES pulled the burgeoning industry out of the “video game crash” and introduced countless iconic characters and franchises. It seemed like every hit property received a game at the time. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Top Gun, DuckTales, Dungeons &amp; Dragons, American Gladiators: the list goes on and on. However, one iconic brand shockingly never made the transition into a NES game.
Garbage Pail Kids, which also debuted in 1985, was a trading card series that mixed the cuteness of the hit Cabbage Patch Kid…</span>

                              <span>Nearly four years after its reveal, Bayonetta 3 is finally on the horizon and graces Game Informer’s cover this month. Platinum Games’ long-awaited threequel doesn’t rest on the laurels of its beloved predecessors. Gaming’s favorite witch has new tricks up her sleeves in the forms of Demon Masquerade and Demon Slave, letting players utilize their demonic minions in combat in new, kaiju-sized ways. If one Bayonetta wasn’t enough, a multiversal storyline introduces several variants that bring their unique brands of flair. At the center of this crisis stands newcomer Viola, the second playable character and rookie Umbra Witch, who serves as a mysterious key to the game’s events.

                              <span>CD Projekt Red has pulled back the curtains on its game development pipeline, revealing a brand new Cyberpunk game, multiple new Witcher games, and even a new IP. 
This news comes by way of the studio&#x27;s investor call today, in which the studio revealed Orion, the codename for its next Cyberpunk game. Not much else was revealed, but CDPR says Orion &quot;will take the Cyberpunk franchise further and continue harnessing the potential of this dark future universe.&quot; 
Up next was The Witcher. CDPR has revealed that its next Witcher game, which was announced earlier this year, is being developed under the codename Polaris. The studio says &quot;it is the beginning of a new saga&quot; and that it aims to release two more Witcher games after Polaris, creating a new AAA RPG Witcher trilogy.

                              <span>EA and Motive Studios have released the first official gameplay trailer for the upcoming remake of Dead Space. 
The studio has been slowly releasing new information and video clips of this remake in its behind-the-scenes showcases focused on things like the game&#x27;s sound, visuals, or something else. But today&#x27;s trailer marks the first time we&#x27;ve seen this much official gameplay at once and it looks great. Terrifying, of course, but great. 
Check out the official Dead Space remake gameplay trailer for yourself below: 


And here are some high-resolution screenshots from today&#x27;s trailer: 

As you can see, this remake is looking awesome and we can&#x27;t wait to go hands-on with it. Fortunately, we don&#x27;t have to wait too much longer because it hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on January 27, 2023.</span>

                              <span>Nintendo has revealed the first look at its upcoming Super Mario Bros. movie. 
Don&#x27;t get too excited just yet – this first look isn&#x27;t a trailer. But it is a new image showcasing our first look at the famed plumber in the Mushroom Kingdom of this movie, which is being made by Minions studio Illumination Entertainment. This image accompanies the announcement of a Nintendo Direct happening this Thursday, October 6, all about the movie. Nintendo specifically points out that there will be no video game news, however, so don&#x27;t expect anything more than Super Mario Bros. 
Tune in at 1:05 p.m. PT on 10/6 for a #NintendoDirect: The Super Mario Bros. Movie presentation introducing the world premiere trailer for the upcoming film (no game information will be featured).

Here&#x27;s a better look at it, too, courtesy of the film&#x27;s first poster:
As you can see, this image reveals quite a lot. There&#x27;s Toad, an antiques stall selling relics of Mario&#x27;s past video games, plenty of pipes and platforms, and of course, Princess Peach&#x27;s castle high above the rest of the kingdom. There&#x27;s probably plenty more to glean from the image so have at it. 
This image is our first look at the movie, but during the Direct on Thursday, which begins at 1:05 p.m. Pacific/4:05 p.m. Eastern, Nintendo will formally introduce the movie with the first-ever world premiere trailer, so be sure to tune in. 
Super Mario Bros. hits theaters on April 7, 2023.
While waiting for this Thursday direct, read about how Nintendo is reportedly happy with the film and so happy, that additional Nintendo movies are likely on the way. Read about how Chris Pratt says his Mario voice is &quot;unlike anything you&#x27;ve heard in the Mario world&quot;. After that, then check out this story about how a producer from the movie says Mario won&#x27;t have an Italian accent in the film.

                              <span>Sony might be interested in helping produce movies and television shows based on From Software games. 
This news comes by way of a new interview between Reuters and PlayStation Studios head Hermen Hulst, in which Hulst explains PlayStation&#x27;s investments into its PC and mobile efforts as of late, as well as its recent investment into Elden Ring developer From Software. According to Hulst, &quot;further investments in areas that will strengthen the expansion on to PC, on to mobile, and into live services&quot; is definitely a possibility for PlayStation. 


However, more interesting to From Software fans perhaps is Hulst&#x27;s answer when asked about Sony&#x27;s investment in the studio. 
&quot;You should think of collaborations on the game development side first and foremost, but it&#x27;s also not unthinkable with our PlayStation Productions efforts that we explore opportunities,&quot; he said. 
While Sony has a 14.09% stake in From Software, that&#x27;s not quite enough to make decisions independent of the studio&#x27;s other investors, like Tencent, which acquired 16.25% of From Software around the same time Sony invested. So while PlayStation Productions might be interested in a Bloodborne horror movie one day or an Elden Ring TV series about Jar Bairn, for example, From Software and its other investors would likely need to give the green light as well. Here&#x27;s hoping, though, because From Software&#x27;s properties, be it Bloodborne, Elden Ring, Dark Souls, or something else, seem ripe for an on-screen adaptation. 
While waiting to see if anything comes of this, read about how Bloober Team is making a TV series adaptation and then read about how Sony is developing God of War, Gran Turismo, and Horizon screen adaptations after that.

                              <span>Bloober Team has announced that its 2021 psychological horror game, The Medium, is getting a TV adaptation. 
The studio announced this in a new blog post today, as translated by Bloody Disgusting, which reveals Tomasz Bagiński, an executive producer for Netflix&#x27;s Witcher series, and Bloober Team&#x27;s own Piotr Babieno will oversee the show. 
&quot;Both the film industry and the video game industry are close to my heart, and I am very happy that there is finally an opportunity to bring them both together,&quot; Babieno writes in the blog post, according to Bloody Disgusting. &quot;The story we told in the game was appreciated by players, and now more people will be able to hear about it. The latest hits of streaming platforms based on games such as Cyberpunk: Edgerunners or Arcane have shown that this is the perfect time for such productions.&quot; 
As noted in Babieno&#x27;s writing above, The Medium will join a slew of recent video game adaptations that have found great success, like Cyberpunk: Edgerunners (Cyberpunk 2077) and Arcane (League of Legends), and others still in development, like Sony&#x27;s God of War, Horizon, and Gran Turismo productions.

While copyright infringement can&#x27;t be eradicated entirely, Google is slowly but steadily presenting itself as a willing partner in the anti-piracy fight.

Once you get past its bizarre name, Dorfromantik offers simple, relaxing sessions of tile-matching puzzle goodness. Connecting hexagons to build pretty landscapes offers the thoughtful strategy of a city-builder to provide a stimulating yet overwhelmingly Zen atmosphere. 
Fans of the board game Carcassonne should quickly grasp Dorfromantik&#x27;s concept of drawing random tiles and finding high-scoring – and aesthetically pleasing – ways to place them on the field based on their scenery. Tiles only fit next to those with corresponding edges; r…</span>

                              <span>Dead Space fans will finally get a new look at gameplay for the upcoming remake of the first game. The game’s official Twitter account announced that we’ll see this footage tomorrow at 8 a.m. Pacific/11 a.m. Eastern on the game’s YouTube channel. 
Trailer tomorrow. Tune in at 8am PT for the first official look at #DeadSpace gameplay.

This premiere is being dubbed as the &quot;first official” look at gameplay. That distinction likely means that the footage will be of a near-complete build of the game since developer Motive Studios has spent the last year releasing several behind-the-scenes videos showcasing gameplay in more unfinished forms. This transparent approach to Dead Space’s development has given fans raw looks at how the 2008 classic is being updated. Player feedback from these videos has even allowed Motive to make subtle but important changes earlier in the pipeline. With the game only a few months away, we&#x27;re curious to see how all of that work has coalesced. 
Dead Space launches on January 27 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</span>

                              <span>A remake or remaster of 2017&#x27;s Horizon Zero Dawn is reportedly in the works alongside a new Horizon multiplayer game. 
This news comes by way of MP1st, which reports that its sources tell the publication that this remake/remaster will feature an improved lighting system, overhauled textures, better animations, and character models more in line with those of Horizon Forbidden West, Zero Dawn&#x27;s sequel that released back in February. However, MP1ST notes that its sources didn&#x27;t say whether this was a &quot;built from the ground up&quot; remake or a remaster – it might fall somewhere in between for all we know. 


According to MP1st, one of the project&#x27;s big focuses (ha) is bringing Forbidden West&#x27;s accessibility features over to Zero Dawn, something Sony did with The Last of Us Part II and Part I. As f…</span>

                              <span>The WD SN550 is going cheap at Ebuyer&#x27;s Ebay UK page right now, with a 2TB drive costing just £118.98. That&#x27;s an awesome deal for what is already one of the best value PCIe 3.0 SSDs, offering sequential read speeds up to 2600MB/s and sequential write speeds up to 1800MB/s. That&#x27;s about five times faster than even the fastest SATA drive in terms of peak read speeds, making this an excellent choice for handling large files such as 4K videos, disc images and so on. 
To get this reduced price, you&#x27;ll need to use the code SPEND15 at Ebay. This knocks £21 off the price, moving it from £140 to £119.

You can view the whole of October&#x27;s Steam Next Fest right here if you&#x27;d rather just dive in headfirst, but below you&#x27;ll find some hand-picked highlights we&#x27;ve been enjoying ahead of time - including a new Return Of The Obra Dinn-alike, a first-person skeleton shooter, an underwater citybuilders and a platformer where your gun is also an umbrella.

The Richard Gere holding a necklace of video games. One thing that I do not dwell on in my feature, though, is that I was hamstrung not just by the early access limitations of the game. For almost all of the first playthrough I did, I thought that you could neither heal nor store items in Gloomwood. I was like &quot;Wow, this is a really hardcore stealth sim.&quot;
You can, of course, do both of those things in Gloomwood. It&#x27;s just, I am an idiot.

They’re also checking whether anyone would be up for remasters or remakes of earlier games, such as Legacy Of Kain: Soul Reaver. If you don’t enjoy the sound of a satirical co-op beat ‘em up set in the vampiric realm of Nosgoth then you might want to chime in with your thoughts.

                              <span>The RIAA has booked a landmark victory against YouTube-ripper Yout.com. The Connecticut District Court dismissed Yout&#x27;s request to declare the service as non-infringing. In a detailed ruling, Judge Stefan Underhill concludes that the service failed to show that it doesn&#x27;t circumvent YouTube&#x27;s technological protection measures. Yout is disappointed and will appeal the verdict.

                              <span>The World Intellectual Property Organization&#x27;s Advisory Committee on Enforcement recently heard how DNS providers have the ability to fight online piracy but could also face liability as secondary infringers. Veiled warnings like these are nothing new, but with piracy colossus Fmovies cited as a primary example, pressure on DNS entities is building once again.

To je také důvod, proč Goodoffer24 staví Microsoft na vedlejší kolej snížením ceny za Windows 10 a Microsoft Office, čímž činí proces aktualizace mnohem dostupnějším. Dokonce můžete koupit obojí naráz, a tím ušetříte ještě více. A tady je, co můžete dostat.</span>

                              <span>Rowing Blazers, a New York-based clothing brand, has announced a new line of Sonic the Hedgehog apparel. The collection draws inspiration from Sonic&#x27;s aesthetic from the 1990s, with graphics inspired by art from the time. 
Those who are interested in the collection can look forward to clothing items like a cotton sweater with Sonic&#x27;s image, a zip-up polar fleece, heavyweight rugby jerseys, a French terry loopback hoodie, cotton tees, and mesh shorts. The line also includes baseball caps, canvas tote bags, a necktie, and a hand-embroidered Sonic patch for blazers and other clothing items.
You can see a gallery of some of the items in the collection below.

According to Jack Carlson, founder and creative director of Rowing Blazers, which has done collaborations with FILA, Umbro, the NBA, and more, the company&#x27;s creations all hold important links to his personal life.
&quot;A lot of it has to do with the things I loved growing up: the sports, the brands, the culture,&quot; he said in a press release. &quot;I grew up in the &#x27;90s playing Sonic the Hedgehog on the Sega Genesis. Sonic has always been such an interesting character to me. In the original games, he was a little bit brash, a little bit punk. He was different from other cartoon and video game protagonists. He was very &#x27;90s. Of course, there have been a lot of Sonic clothing capsules created over the years. I wanted to do something elevated, really beautifully made, and kind of timeless in its aesthetic. Of course, there&#x27;s a kind of irony to it because Sonic himself isn&#x27;t really very preppy, but that&#x27;s the fun of it.&quot;
The collection retails as low as $38 to $325, though nothing is currently listed at the higher end of that spectrum just yet. The collection is live now, having launched yesterday. If you&#x27;d like to check out the collection for yourself, you can head here.</span>

                              <span>Adult entertainment conglomerate MindGeek owns many tube sites including Pornhub. While the company itself has a piracy history, today it&#x27;s one of the most protective copyright holders in the industry. With a sweeping court injunction, it hoped to take Daftsex.com and several related services offline. However, the court slammed the brakes on the request, at least for now.

                              <span>Petrol stations might not be the most natural setting for pondering life&#x27;s biggest questions, but the ones in Flat Eye, the next game from the makers of detective taxi-me-do Night Call, aren&#x27;t your ordinary rest stops. As well as a convenient place to relieve yourself and top up on snacks, these futuristic service stations also house cosmetic surgery bots, operation tables, teleportation booths and more - and they&#x27;re all overseen by a powerful AI trying to find the best possible future for the human race. As the station&#x27;s head clerk, you&#x27;ll debate the ethics of eternal youth and end of life care, while also making sure your station has enough power, stocked shelves and a happy customer base. It&#x27;s certainly an intriguing combo compared to other management games out there right now, so I sat down with director Laurent Victorino and writer Antony Jauneaud to find out more.

Many of the devs I spoke with have had no communication from Google at all since the announcement, with only one saying the company had been in touch. It&#x27;s not just devs who have been left in the dark, though. Through a leaked internal email sent to Google’s Stadia team, even Google&#x27;s own staff weren’t briefed until around the same time the public were made aware of the forthcoming shutdown.

Imagine Nidhogg, cross it with Webbed, give it solid single player options, and throw in one of the sickest game soundtracks I&#x27;ve ever heard. I&#x27;d hoped Spiderheck would merely be as fun as it looks. It instead consumed me. Neverjam have united my love for Webbed with my love for chaos, and it&#x27;s more glorious than I dared to hope.

                              <span>Out now in early access, Slime Rancher 2 is the highly anticipated sequel to Monomi Park’s charming farming sim. Beatrix LeBeau has packed up her slime-wrangling gear and has crossed the Slime Sear to Rainbow Island, a new land packed with new mysteries and new slimes.
As a seasoned slime wrangler myself, I was excited to dive head-first into this new, colourful world. Review code didn&#x27;t arrive until launch day unfortunately, but all week I&#x27;ve been vibrating with anticipation. After spending a handful of hours frolicking with slimes and skipping around Rainbow Island, though, that early dazzle is starting to wear off. Monomi Park’s sequel feels a little too familiar to its predecessor in its early game, and it&#x27;s put a major downer on my goo-hoovering adventures.

                              <span>December’s a month known for its white-haired, bearded men in weird outfits and hats, so it seems a fitting time of year for Slitherine Games to launch their remake of 4X strategy classic Master Of Magic. Slitherine are referring to their take on Master Of Magic as a re-imagining rather than a remake or reboot, saying they’ve tried to be “faithful to the original in spirit and mood”. You’ll be able to Gandalf it up from December 13th.

                              <span>Out Of Hands is a fairly &quot;does what it says on the tin&quot; title for this, a game where you play a dude who dreams he is made entirely out of hands every night. It also operates as a decent joke, because rather than being out of hands, he, if anything, has too many. So full marks for the name. The game itself is kind of a deckbuilder but not really, and though it also describes itself as a thriller, I can&#x27;t say my heart rate was raised. In fact, behind the (admittedly very cool) visual style there seems to be a pretty run-of-the-mill &quot;a girl I liked is no longer in my life and I&#x27;m pretty cut up about that&quot; story. I guess in the full game it might turn out she was murdered, or she mudered the main character, or the main character murdered her - just, some kind of murder, maybe?
But in the four demo levels I played recently, it seemed like a pretty normal breakup. I was really excited to give it a go, but in the preview I didn&#x27;t find the contrast between a face made of squirming hands and the well trodden women-be-leavin&#x27; plot to be particularly affective or evocative. The squirming hands are cool, though.

                              <span>At this year&#x27;s Gamescom I got hands-on with Bytten Studio&#x27;s Cassette Beasts, an upcoming monster-taming open world RPG in the vein of Pokémon, which is far more interesting to me than the basic concept of Pokémon. That&#x27;s because you&#x27;re able to fuse together any monsters you &#x27;catch&#x27;, but moreso because it&#x27;s a monster collectathon where you become the monster, essentially fusing yourself with bomb dogs and hermit crabs with traffic cone-homes.
I like the way the game does away with the overdone shonen story of wanting to become the very best there ever was, and instead puts the spotlight on its cast of characters and the relationships you form with your buds. It&#x27;s looking mighty promising.

                              <span>If you&#x27;ve ever wondered what the 1987 film Running Man might look like as a turn-based tactics game (see also last year&#x27;s Netflix sensation Squid Game, if the Running Man reference doesn&#x27;t quite do it for you), then Homicidal All-Stars probably comes pretty close. It&#x27;s the debut game from Artificer, a new studio formed by a bunch of ex-CreativeForge devs who worked on the first Hard West and Phantom Doctrine, and it centres on a woman called Scarlett who finds herself competing in the deadly TV show that gives the game its name. Like Running Man, Squid Game and all those other &#x27;deadly games&#x27; you know and love, Homicidal All-Stars is about folks who down on their luck fighting for their lives, where their only consolation prize in these dystopian bloodbaths is not getting pulped at the end of it. 
For Scarlett, this means mowing down scumbags in classic turn-based fashion with a bunch of other friendly competitors she&#x27;s teamed up with, but this is far from a straightforward XCOM-like. Between fights, you&#x27;ll also be navigating its trap-filled arenas in third-person, dodging sniper turrets, disabling tripwires, and dashing over spiky/fiery/horrible pits to get to the end of each &#x27;episode&#x27;. It&#x27;s a refreshing mix based on an early preview build I&#x27;ve been playing recently, especially when its gameshow hook allows for its malicious host, Orion Ford, to start meddling with your success. &quot;He’s the person behind the worst of the twists,&quot; creative director and Artificer CEO Kacper Szymczak tells me. &quot;He’ll start filling the level with poisonous gas, he’ll turn off the lights, drop explosive barrels everywhere, to name just a few.&quot;

Although reaching 1.0 means leaving early access, it&#x27;s also not the end of Vampire Survivors development. Work on porting the game to a new engine continues with the aim to &quot;release it by the end of the year.&quot;

If the answer is &quot;yes&quot;, or even &quot;possibly, why?&quot;, then you might find Retro Gadgets handy when it launches on PC towards the end of the year.

The second I began Shovel Knight Dig, it felt like returning home. As someone who hadn’t played most of Shovel Knight’s post-launch DLC, the last time I touched this series was nearly a decade ago. Gaining control of the titular character immediately felt familiar, and my old Shovel Knight habits returned to greet this new take on the series, led by developer Nitrome this time. The moment-to-moment experience plays excellently, in part because it’s more Shovel Knight with some well-designed gameplay twists. However, the game’s venture into roguelite territory feels i…</span>

                              <span>Google has revealed that its cloud-streaming games service, Stadia, will shut down early next year. 
More specifically, Stadia will close down its platform and end its online servers on January 18, 2023. After that, you won&#x27;t be able to access the Stadia service in any way. As for your games and hardware, Google is offering refunds &quot;for all Stadia hardware purchases (Stadia controllers, Founders Edition, Premiere Edition, and Play and Watch with Google TV packages) through the Stadia store,&quot; according to an FAQ posted by Google today. It seems like the only aspect of Stadia that won&#x27;t be refunded are Stadia Pro subscriptions. However, you &quot;will be able to continue playing your games in Pro without further charges until the final wind down date.&quot; 
If you are hoping to get a refund for your hardware, Google says &quot;most hardware purchases...made directly from Google&quot; will not require you to return your hardware. The company intends to have the majority of refunds processed by Stadia&#x27;s January 18 shutdown date. 
The Stadia Store and all its functions have been turned off so you will not be able to make any more Stadia-related purchases or in-game transactions. 
Stadia shutting down isn&#x27;t the most surprising news. Despite cloud gaming&#x27;s continuing rise in popularity as of late thanks to the likes of Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox Cloud Gaming initiative and others, Stadia never seemed to really take off. The first big sign that Stadia might not be long for this world came back in February of last year, when Google revealed it was ending its first-party game development and closing two studios. Then, this February, word got out that Google Stadia had reportedly been deprioritized by the company. Now, Stadia has just a few months left in it before it becomes a part of history. So long, Stadia.

As for why, the team doesn&#x27;t say. However, a new teaser trailer released today is titled, &quot;You&#x27;ve waited long enough,&quot; so perhaps the studio simply wants to get this game into players&#x27; hands sooner. Check it out for yourself below:

                              <span>Skull and Bones has been delayed again, this time to March of next year. 
It was originally due out in 2018 but then delayed to 2019. It was delayed to at least March 2020 after that, but things went quiet and the game missed that window. Then, in May of last year, Ubisoft announced that Skull and Bones would release sometime between April 1, 2022, and March 31, 2023. And now, it&#x27;s slipping out of its November 8 release date, which was only just announced back in July, into a new March 9, 2023 date. As for why, the team cites a need for more polish and balancing.
Kotaku&#x27;s Ethan Gach says sources say the teams working on Skull and Bones are burnt out. According to Gach in his Kotaku story, the latest technical test for the game ended on September 19. One source involved with the test told Kotaku that gameplay was more refined than in previous tests but that progression needed work as it still felt too shallow. Gach writes that this is a concern shared by multiple sources close to the game&#x27;s development. 
Here&#x27;s what Ubisoft has to say about the delay: 
The last the public saw of Skull and Bones in a big way was during a July showcase, which is where we saw extensive gameplay and received the now-delayed November 8 release date. I learned a lot more about the game around the same time when Skull and Bones was Game Informer&#x27;s cover story. At the time, the team seemed confident in its November release date but given the history of this title, I&#x27;m not surprised it&#x27;s been delayed again.

                              <span>Electronic Arts and Koei Tecmo have revealed Wild Hearts, a new Monster Hunter-like game coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC next year. 
More specifically, this EA Originals title will be released on February 17, 2023. This news comes by way of the game&#x27;s reveal trailer released today. In it, we see a lot of monster hunting action. The game seems to take place in a mythological land filled with large and dangerous beasts. You&#x27;ll need to craft better gear to take on tougher monsters, eventually taming the otherwise wild area. 
Check out the reveal trailer below: 


As you can see, Wild Hearts looks great, especially if you&#x27;re someone who&#x27;s a fan of Capcom&#x27;s long-running Monster Hunter series.

&quot;I&#x27;m Guybrush Threepwood, mighty pirate!&quot;
Between the moment Guybrush uttered this iconic line in Return to Monkey Island and our reintroduction to familiar characters like used ship salesman Stan S. Stanman and Cobb, with his &quot;Ask me about Loom&quot; badge, I was already shrouded in a haze of nostalgia. And you would be eating all these up, too, if you&#x27;re a Monkey Island fan. The thing about Monkey Island enthusiasts is that we can talk your ears off about what makes the series so unique. It&#x27;s the earnest naivety of its pirate hero Guybrush Threepwood and the serie…</span>

This news comes from a new Overwatch 2 blog post, as reported by Destructoid. In it, Blizzard says a consistent piece of feedback it has received is that new players feel overwhelmed by Overwatch&#x27;s hero pool and various modes. As such, the team has implemented a new First Time User Experience, or FTUE, designed for Overwatch 2 players who have never played Overwatch. 
The new FTUE addresses that feedback directly. In phase one, players will need to unlock the game&#x27;s modes and chat functions – this happens &quot;rapidly,&quot; Blizzard writes in the blog post. Then, in phase two, players will unlock the original Overwatch heroes by playing &quot;approximately 100 matches,&quot; a…</span>
