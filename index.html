                              <span>Infinity Nikki is blessing the world with its stunning visuals and fabulous outfits, and it&#x27;s available as a free-to-play experience. Many are wondering, however, if there are any Infinity Nikki gacha elements to worry about. 


Are there Infinity Nikki gacha elements?


Infinity Nikki has you collect costumes for special abilities and gorgeous new outfits to wear in the game. While some can be received by simply progressing in the game, other outfits are exclusively gacha.

How does the gacha system work?


It works very similarly to Genshin Impact. You can get four- and five-star outfits from the Resonance (like Wish) system. With every 10 Revelation or Resonite Crystals, you&#x27;ll get a guaranteed  4-star or higher piece of an outfit. You&#x27;ll need to gain Stellarites or Diamonds to get these Crystals. 


Diamonds act similarly to Primogems if you&#x27;ve played Genshin Impact. You&#x27;ll gain them from completing quests and finishing in-game activities. These diamonds can be used to get the Revelation and Resonite Crystals. You&#x27;ll need 120 of them to gain one, so 1,200 Diamonds are required to gain a 10-pull. 


If you want to skip the Diamond grinding, you can pay for Stellarites, another currency that can be used to gain Crystals. They cost the following in real money:


60
$0.99 USD / $1.29 CAD


300
$4.99 USD / $6.99 CAD


980
$14.99 USD / $19.99 CAD


1980
$29.99 USD / $39.99 CAD


3280
$49.99 USD / $65.99 CAD


6480
$99.99 USD / $129.99 CAD






With the first top-up, you&#x27;ll get a double bonus. For example, if you spend $0.99 on 60 Stellarites, you&#x27;ll get a bonus 60 Stellarites for 120 in total.


Certain costumes can be purchased outright. If you head to the bottom tab of the Store, you can access four different outfits, such as the Scalry Dream dress. They each vary in press and might be on sale.

This is especially true in Chapter 2, when you receive your first Miracle Outfit Sketch, which calls for something called Bedrock Crystals. 


Bedrock Crystals are a resource that cannot be discovered or farmed in the overworld of Miraland. Instead, you’ll need to go into another realm to gather this needed material. Here’s everything you need to know.

The first day of early access hasn&#x27;t been free of issues thus far, with the launch getting delayed by a certain amount of time already. Players have been able to join the party now, but there are several issues. One of those becomes evident in the first area that serves as part of the tutorial. Both my colleague and I encountered lag in the same area, and here are a few tips and tricks you can try if you find this same issue.

                              <span>As you explore the world of Miraland in Infinity Nikki, you’ll come across a large number of quests described as “Random Quests.” Some of these are called Kindled Inspiration quests, and they involve dressing Nikki up in specific clothes to complete the requirements. 


Kindled Inspiration quests will be added to your quest log as soon as you talk to the NPC giving them out. They’re arguably pretty easy to complete as long as you can get a full understanding of what the person giving you the quest actually wants. Unfortunately, nothing is that straightforward, and you’re likely to be left wondering what you’re supposed to be wearing.

                              <span>Once you’ve progressed a little way through the main story of Infinity Nikki and met Tokar at the Stylist’s Guild, you’ll begin to unlock Realms that can be visited via Warp Spires. These are a great way to get your hands on valuable rewards, but you need Vital Energy to take part in the challenges. 


Vital Energy is the currency that you pay to take part in Realm Challenges, and how much you’ll use in each Realm differs. If you’ve depleted your supply and want to go back for more, here’s how you can get more Vital Energy. 


How to get Vital Energy in Infinity Nikki





If you’re patient and want to restore your Vital Energy without spending any precious resources, then you’re in luck because Vital Energy will replenish by one every five minutes, so you’re going to get your supply back eventually if you just wait a little while and do other things. 


However, if you want to speed things along and get straight back to the action, you have a couple of options:


Purchase Vital Energy with Diamonds


Spending 50 Diamonds will restore 80 Vital Energy, which is enough to dip into the Realm of Eureka or the Realm of the Dark twice. However, you can only do this six times per day, costing 800 Diamonds and granting a maximum of 480 Vital Energy. 


Purchase Vital Energy with Energy Crystals


Alternatively, you can spend some Energy Crystals. These are rewarded for a number of things, including progression through the main story, completing side quests, opening up treasure chests, and through the Mira Journey. 


You can use as many Energy Crystals as you like, and they’ll also grant you 80 Vital Energy per Crystal that you spend. While this may seem like the preferable method to get your Energy back, bear in mind that the supply of Energy Crystals is going to diminish eventually, so it might be worth hoarding them and keeping them at hand for when this happens.

                              <span>Marvel Rivals is quickly ramping up in player count on both the PC and console side, but given that it is a shooter game, there will be one big question. Does Marvel Rivals have crossplay, and if so, is there specific crossplay between Xbox and PS5?


Does Marvel Rivals have crossplay?


In short, Marvel Rivals has crossplay between PC and consoles. It should be on by default when you first boot up the game. 


To ensure that crossplay is on, follow these steps:



Click settings (the gear wheel on the top right of the screen).


Select “Settings”


Find the Social tab.


Look for the “Social” section and check “CROSS-PLATFORM”.


Make sure the check mark is on.



Once that’s set, you can now toggle this feature on and off on the Play page in the main menu.

In normal circumstances, this error is intended to indicate that the account you have logged into for Path of Exile 2 does not have access to the game.

                              <span>If you’re wondering what SVP means in Marvel Rivals, I’m going to do what I’m not supposed to do in these sorts of articles and just give you an answer: it means Second Valuable Player.


So, if MVP means Most Valuable Player, then SVP is the runner-up: the Second Valuable Player. Another possible acronym could be SMVP or “Second-Most Valuable Player,” but I guess that doesn’t look as flash.


I don’t have much else to talk about, so let’s explore that. SVP is already a fairly common acronym. I don’t know if you see it much in other countries, but here in Canada (even the English-speaking parts), we see it as S&#x27;il Vous Plaît, which is French for please. In business, it is often seen as an abbreviation for Senior Vice President. In a legal sense, it’s sometimes applied to… Well, you can look that up if you want, but it’s a little dark for this subject matter, so we’ll leave that there.


In Marvel Rivals, the MVP and SVP are picked based on a number of factors, including KDR (Kill-Death Ratio), damage output, and damage healed or blocked. To boil it down in the most obvious way, it’s how much a person contributed to their team’s success based on metrics. I just felt like stressing that, since – and this is absolutely just hypothetical – someone being really encouraging over voice chat and keeping morale up on their team could – and again, this is hypothetical – have had the greatest positive effect on their team, but there’s no way for the scoring system to know that.


And really, some people may let chasing score get in the way of their sportsmanship. If someone is selfish chasing higher numbers at the expense of their team’s strategy or the enjoyment of others, then they could become MVP or SVP. The scoring system would be able to tell either way.


But I digress. If you scrolled down here figuring the answer would be at the end, I’ll give it to you again: SVP means Second Valuable Player.

                              <span>It&#x27;s hard to believe it&#x27;s been over a decade since the original Path of Exile entered Open Beta. The story behind the ARPG was simple enough:  a small group of ARPG fans felt the genre had become stale and lacked new releases, and they aimed to fix that. 


Over the next decade developer Grinding Gear Games would continue to update and add to Path of Exile, turning it into one of the staple ARPGs in the genre. With consistent quarterly updates, PoE ballooned into a massive game with a simply insane amount of content.


Today, Grinding Gear Games releases the sequel to its popular ARPG, Path of Exile 2. While PoE still has a massive fan base—and will continue to receive its frequent updates—PoE2 seeks to serve as an updated version of the game with more streamlined and modern systems, a mor…</span>

                              <span>There are over a million players waiting eagerly for Path of Exile 2&#x27;s early access to begin, but there&#x27;s a roadblock waiting for them as of writing. 


Just like the first title, the new game requires persistent internet connection at all times if you want to enjoy all the content. Based on the original schedule as revealed by the developers, the game should be live now as it&#x27;s part 11 a.m. PST on December 6. Unfortunately, the servers are currently down as the developers are still working on the final details for the early access. 


There&#x27;s no ETA as to when the servers are going to open for the early access. However, there might be server issues later down the road as well. Here are a few steps you can take to know if the servers are working as intended. 


How to check Path of Exile 2 server status


A great way to know if the servers are down or not is by knowing the status. Usually, the best way to do so is by following the official X account. For Path of Exile 2, the X account is the same as the first game. You can follow the handle by clicking on this link. Make sure to turn on your notifications, as there will be plenty of gameplay updates coming soon as well. 


Additionally, it&#x27;s also crucial to ensure that there&#x27;s no update going on in the future. With Path of Exile 2 entering early access, it&#x27;s safe to expect plenty of changes to be made to the gameplay in the near future. GGG will be taking down the servers in case of maintenance, and you won&#x27;t be able to play normally. 


If you&#x27;re like me and waiting eagerly for the action to begin, the wait will have to be longer. Those trying to play the game right now are encountering the Unexpected Disconnection Account error. This should go away automatically once the servers are up.

                              <span>Open-world survival phenomenon, Minecraft, is set for its own D&amp;D style Table Top Role-Playing Game (TTRPG) penned by Marvel Multiverse TTRPG author Matt Forbeck. There are scant details about how the game will play, but it looks as though it will primarily be a solo adventure that will see the hero battle to take on a mob of illagers to save an isolated Minecraft village.


Due for release in July 2025, the game will include four dice. Buyers also get an adventure book that includes an extensive bestiary and adventure locations as well as a removable character sheet and a quick rules reference.  


The Minecraft phenomenon


The full version of the Minecraft video game was launched in 2011, after two years of development based on forum feedback. The voxel crafting game lets players destro…</span>

                              <span>The globally renown manga franchise My Hero Academia released its final chapter last August. While its conclusion received mixed reception, it&#x27;s only proof that the series has many fans. Fortunately for the fans, it seems like My Hero Academia won&#x27;t be the last Kohei Horikoshi manga.


Despite the manga&#x27;s ten-year run, Horikoshi hasn&#x27;t had his fill of creating manga. In fact, he revealed in an interview with Marvel that he is already slowly working on his next project.

Kohei Horikoshi&#x27;s love for western superheroes is very apparent in his work in My Hero Academia. In fact, some of the main characters&#x27; attacks are named after American states. To celebrate the manga&#x27;s final volume release and to give back to comic book fans worldwide, Marvel and Weekly Shonen Jump collaborated in an art exchange featuring beloved characters from both media.


However, Horikoshi doesn&#x27;t simply provide beautiful artwork from All Might and Deku with the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. He also revealed his plans for his next project:


&quot;I feel really lucky over the success of MHA, so I know there&#x27;s a lot of pressure around my next move. I&#x27;m planning to start a new manga as soon as I possibly can.


&quot;I was thinking to committing myself to simply drawing my next project, and letting someone else write the story, but my editor advised me &#x27;It will be better if you do it all yourself.&#x27; With that in mind, I&#x27;ve slowly started writing and drawing the thumbnails of my next manga. However, there are still several events left surrounding MHA, so for a while I&#x27;ll still be committed to supporting and promoting it.&quot;

These two industry legends have worked together in a lot of different projects (even before the release of the first Final Fantasy game back in 1987), and it seems that they still are very close after all this time. In a recent interview with Famitsu (which @Genki_JPN partially translated into English) Sakaguchi sat down to talk about FANTASIAN Neo Dimension and his relationship with Uematsu.

What does &#x27;An unexpected disconnection occured&#x27; mean?


Update 3:41 PM EST - According to GGG a configuration problem due to the last-minute changes has led to them having to take down and restart the servers, so the error will return.


Update 3:34 PM EST -  Servers appear to be coming online as players are reporting getting placed into queue. If you&#x27;re not able to get into queue, try restarting your game client.

                              <span>Eric Barone – also known as ConcernedApe – is most known for being the creator of Stardew Valley, which has gone down as one of the era-defining indie games in recent memory. Seriously, if you haven&#x27;t played it, you are urged to treat yourself. However, years later, people have been wondering where Barone&#x27;s next project is.


Although the developer has already said their next game, Haunted Chocolatier, is currently in the works, there have been very few, if any, updates since. But in a recent post on the upcoming game&#x27;s website, Barone has made it clear that progress is underway. In fact, the message goes on to say they&#x27;ve &quot;already done a ton of work on the game,&quot; adding that &quot;essentially a skeleton of the game with most (not all) of its bones&quot; is now in place.

                              <span>You&#x27;re going to need some serious allies to battle the enemy team in Marvel Rivals. If you&#x27;re looking to formulate your own superhero superteam, you&#x27;ll first need to add a few friends to your Friend&#x27;s list. 


Where to add friends in Marvel Rivals?


With Marvel Rivals heavily incentivizing teamwork during a match, having a few trusty friends with you can be the tide-turner. Thankfully, adding friends is super easy, regardless of which platform you&#x27;re playing on.


First, open the game so that you&#x27;re staring at the Main Menu screen. There&#x27;s plenty you can click on, but for this, look to the top right part of the screen, where you&#x27;ll see an icon that indicates &#x27;Friends list.&#x27; It looks like a silhouette of two people standing one after another.

                              <span>As you navigate the menus in Marvel Rivals, you’ll quickly realize that there are three types of currencies: Units, Lattice, and Chrono Tokens. These will all be important if you’re looking to unlock skins and other cosmetics in the game.


Here, we’ll break down what each currency does and how you can get more of them.


How to get Units in Marvel Rivals


Units are the blue currency that is earned in-game. Think of it as the free currency earned through completing Missions or progressing in the Battle Pass.


Missions are the equivalent of challenges in this game. Read what you need to do. For example, you may need to defeat five enemies using Storm or Captain America with Thorforce’s electrifying enhancement to get 60 Units. This is a Season 0 Mission, but it can be done for now.

The Winter Champions promo is a fresh concept which introduces items that can get upgrades based on real-life football results. Unlike the Showdown series, Winter Champions items rely on their clubs and where they stand in domestic leagues when it comes to the upgrades. Let&#x27;s take a look at how you can complete both challenges.

                              <span>Arguably, one of the best features of Infinity Nikki is the camera, which lets you take adorable selfies of Nikki on her adventures around Miraland and stunning scenery shots. If you’re looking to get the most out of your photo-mode activities, it’s worth upgrading the camera. 


Upgrading the camera comes with many rewards, such as new poses, new lighting styles, and new filters to apply to photos when you take them. This can really improve your photography game, so let’s look at how it’s all done.

If you love to spam crosses into the box, this can be an ideal item. With an overall rating of 86, he can become eligible for a future evolution. The Pace (84) is on the lower side, but that&#x27;s made up for with his Dribbling (86) and Shooting (87). The card also offers 4 different roles, with the highlight being Poacher++.

                              <span>One common problem people have been bringing up with Marvel Rivals is getting told that “DirectX 12 is not supported” when trying to load up the game. This isn’t a bug, DX12 is required to run the game, and there’s no way around it.


The obvious reason for the error is implied by the error: your system configuration can’t handle DirectX 12. DX12 isn’t exactly new, but it’s new enough that some might still be running hardware before it was a thing (it launched in 2015). In fact, a lot of games still support DX10 and DX11, and it’s less common for a game to require DirectX 12 like Marvel Rivals does. So, if this is the first time you’ve seen something like this, then that’s why; DX12 isn’t universal.


You’ll want to note that the minimum system requirements state that DirectX 12 is require…</span>

Look, there&#x27;s no shortage of &quot;best of&quot; lists for Nintendo Switch couch co-op games, and there are a lot of widely agreed-upon highlights out there. But what about folks like us who have exhausted those options and still want something fresh to play with our co-op partner of choice? What&#x27;s left to play? It&#x27;s a topic I routinely return to in my personal life.


I love chilling with games on my own, but I especially love playing games together. Bouncing ideas off each other, getting a little heated when you&#x27;re not on the same page, eventually overcoming the odds — it&#x27;s all part of the cycle, and it&#x27;s (usually) a blast.

ININ Games announced last week that it has officially gained the publishing rights to Shenmue III, the long-awaited third entry in the cult Dreamcast series. Of course, here at Nintendo Life, that got us thinking about the future of the series — particularly given than none of the games have appeared on Switch. And now, ININ Games has shared a survey on social media, asking fans to answer &quot;a couple questions on Shenmue III&quot;.
While the survey, which you can access right here, asks questions like &quot;What&#x27;s your favourite moment in the whole Shenmue series?&quot; and &quot;What graphics and performance improvements would you like to see for Shenmue III?&quot;, there&#x27;s one big one that caught our eye:

Argonaut Games has made the tough decision to delay the upcoming Croc: Legend of the Gobbos remaster to Q1 2025.
In a statement shared on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), Argonaut said the decision to delay the game from its projected December 2024 release date &quot;was not made lightly, but we believe a little more time is needed to add the final touches to ensure the game meets the high standards that we aspire to and which you deserve.&quot;

Wario, the flatulent, garlic-loving counterpart to Mario&#x27;s non-gassy, casual garlic admirer, first appeared in Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins and has since gone on to appear in not one, but two separate series of his own: Land and Ware. Everyone loves a bit of the plumber in yellow, but can any of our good readers claim to love him this much?
A few weeks back, we spied a rather impressive collection of Wario-themed merch from super fan Topher Putnam. Encompassing games, figures, plushies and manga — yes, Wario manga — this is a collection that we were keen to get a closer look at. So, we did just that.

Back in October, it was rumoured that Ubisoft was considering going private after a rough year of releases. Two months on and it appears that the negotiations are still ongoing, with Ubisoft and Tencent apparently engaged in talks about buyout terms.
That is according to the latest report from Reuters, which provides new information from &quot;two people familiar with the matter&quot;. According to the outlet&#x27;s sources, Ubisoft shareholders are currently considering a potential buyout of the company, but one that still leaves the founding Guillemot family in control.

It has been a strange few months in Nintendo land. There hasn&#x27;t been a Direct since August, but a series of strange announcements have been trickling out of the House of Mario nonetheless. There was Alarmo, Nintendo Music, Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition, and more random NSO drops than we can count. So now it&#x27;s time we asked the ultimate question: what&#x27;s going on at Nintendo right now?
Our wonderful video team got together this week to discuss just that. Naturally, none of us have the official answer — even though we&#x27;d all wager that it&#x27;s a result of the Big N being full steam ahead on &#x27;Switch 2&#x27; — but Alex, Felix and Zion sat down for a big old discussion about the company&#x27;s recent releases and why things seem so random at the moment.

Donkey Kong 64 — not the most beloved of Rare&#x27;s titles, but probably the developer&#x27;s most ambitious 3D platformer — turns 25 here in Europe today, 6th December 2024.
DK and friends have a lot to celebrate lately: the Donkey Kong Land trilogy on Game Boy has trickled onto NSO over the past few weeks; the Donkey Kong Country expansion opens up at Universal Studios Japan on 11th December; and Donkey Kong Country Returns HD is the first big Switch release of 2025.

Back in 2018, 11 Bit Studios and Digital Sun dared to ask the question, &#x27;What if, between saving Hyrule, Link ran a little shop?&#x27; The result was Moonlighter, a brilliant little dungeon-crawling, shopkeeping roguelike with a dash of Zelda in its DNA. Well, this eShop beauty is getting a sequel — albeit one that isn&#x27;t confirmed to join its predecessor on Switch.
Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault was revealed in last night&#x27;s PC Gaming Show, showcasing the return of the monster-hunting shopkeeper, Will, and a new 3D twist on the formally top-down pixel art visuals.

                              <span>The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.
Spirit Mancer, the inaugural release from Sunny Syrup Studio, is an ambitious game that flies a little too close to the sun. It’s a hack ‘n’ slash, an action platformer, an RPG, a monster catcher, and a deckbuilder, all rolled into one. If that sounds like too many ideas to cram into one game… well, it totally is, though Spirit Mancer still comes across as a modestly enjoyable and interesting game.
Spirit Mancer follows the story of two military-trained demon hunters, Sebastian and Mary, who are suddenly transported away from the human world to Inferno, where a wicked demon queen has stolen away their friends. Armed with the titular Spirit Mancer, which gives them limited control over demons, the two set out to free their friends, defeat the queen, and save the world.

Atari&#x27;s RollerCoaster Tycoon Classic came speeding onto Switch this week and, honestly, it&#x27;s an all-round good time. In our review, we praised the game&#x27;s endless creative freedom and its ability to bring hours of rollercoaster-building fun, but there was one small omission in the Switch port that left us scratching our heads: where the heck are the touch controls?
The new control scheme has had some good thought put into it, and we had no issues with the button inputs when playing on the big screen. But given that the 2016 original boasted touchscreen functionality on its smart device launch platforms and, you know, the Switch has a touchscreen, it does feel like a strange feature to not make the cut.

Stardew Valley creator Eric &quot;ConcernedApe&quot; Barone revealed his next game, Haunted Chocolatier, back in 2021. We&#x27;ve only had the odd development update in the years since, but this week, we have received another one — albeit one that confirms we&#x27;re still going to have to wait a while.
Shared in a new blog post on the Haunted Chocolatier website, Barone stated that the Stardew Valley 1.6 update has been taking up most of his time of late (naturally), so his follow-up game has had to take a back seat. That said, he is still plugging away at the fantastical chocolate-maker sim in the meantime:

A wave of Splatoon 2 tracks landed on Nintendo Music this week, and we have been jamming along to the Splatfest sounds in the days since. However, it looks like the update contained a few more tracks than Nintendo intended, as a handful of them have since been removed.
Five tracks have been pruned this time — &#x27;A Brighter Future Awaits! (Grizzco recruitment video)&#x27;, &#x27;January 2017 trailer&#x27;, &#x27;Bonus Track (After Octo)&#x27;, &#x27;Splatocalypse (Final Splatfest Trailer)&#x27; and &#x27;Inkopolis Memorial Mixtape&#x27; — all of which, according to OatmealDome on BlueSky, were previously released exclusively on the Japanese soundtrack CD.

While Mai unfortunately missed out on joining Nintendo&#x27;s all-star brawler, one game she will make a cameo in is Capcom&#x27;s Street Fighter 6. A new DLC trailer dropped today and many fans are convinced there&#x27;s dialogue in it that is a reference to Sakurai&#x27;s famous comment about the SNK and Fatal Fury character.

While we&#x27;re used to delays around this time of year, it&#x27;s not often a game gets moved forward, and that&#x27;s exactly what&#x27;s happening with the graphic hack &#x27;n&#x27; slash sequel Tails of Iron 2: Whiskers of Winter.

Digital pre-orders have also gone live for $24.99 USD, with a Deluxe Edition including the base game, and two DLC (Augur of the Draugr Pack and the Hair to the Throne Pack) priced at $29.99.

                              <span>The protagonists of two of my all time favourite RPGs share something in common. Both (the best Final Fantasy game) Final Fantasy 8’s Squall and The Witcher 3’s Geralt simply cannot get enough of leaving their friends and the entire world in mortal peril while they sneak in a quick round of cards, and I love them for it. Way back when the Wild Hunt released, there was a special edition kicking about that gave you a few decks for Gwent - the fleshed-out, playable card distraction that ended up being responsible for some of the game’s best moments. I pined for those decks, but I never acquired them. Now, Hatchette Board Games is putting out a full physical edition of Gwent next year.
The set contains &quot;over 400 cards and a playmat&quot; for £44/$39.99. I’m still recovering from various Fantasy Flight LCGs, so my value sense for this stuff might be a bit skewed, but that strikes me as incredibly reasonable. A good Gwent deck consists of only about 25 cards. They’re not bad cards, either! I’ve got a real pet hate for tabletop versions of videogames that just use in-engine screenshots for the cards, but these ones look to have the proper artwork from the game on them:

                              <span>Where were you during the Summer of Doronko Wanko? Why, I remember it like it was March, and not actually Summer, when the delightful free game about a mucky pomeranian was unleashed into the world. Yep, yep. It was definitely March. Roughly translating to ‘covered in mud doggy’, the game set you the task of racking up tangible financial damage to your owner’s house by getting mud everywhere - first by normal dog means, and then with giant mud cannons. You can grab it for free on Steam here.
It stole our hearts, it did. And talking of stealing things and having a good time doing it, it’s also releasing on the Nintendo Switch soon, which means the Steam version of Doronko Wanko is getting some free DLC to celebrate. It isn’t arriving until next Spring, but it’s bringing three new mystery dog breeds with it when it does.

                              <span>Every fascist in this game has a cold. The Hitlerites and blackshirts of Indiana Jones And The Great Circle sneeze and cough as they patrol the dig sites of Gizeh, or the marble corridors of the Vatican. Although this is the Machine Games&#x27; clever way of letting you know where your enemies are at all times, it is also mildly funny, as if all the Nazis have been secretly kissing each other, spreading the same rhinovirus from Italy to Egypt to Nepal and beyond. More than that, it&#x27;s a stubborn reminder that, despite the many hours of perfectly motion-captured cinematics that accompany all this, you are still playing a video game. A snotty tissue that separates the Indy of taut two-hour cinema and the Indy of a sweeping first-person punch &#x27;em up that will take days to complete. All this is to say, you will notice the difference. But that might not matter; they&#x27;re both still Indiana Jones.

OK, ready to go again. Let&#x27;s open the door.

                              <span>When last we left myself, on a mission to survive S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 by weaponising its monsters instead of shooting its guns, my one-with-nature experiment was yielding mixed results. At best. I’d successfully lured some bandits into the deadly lair of a bucket-tossing Poltergeist, but several attempts at more actively siccing mutated pigs on the Zone’s human baddies had all failed, even when I’d seemed to actually tame one.
Now, my only friend lay dead at my feet, and I’m in dire need of some new beasts to master. And some cash. It turns out that a fighting style that involves letting shopping trolley-sized swine creatures chew on my heels is bad for the ol’ HP, and having recently blown my savings on half a sausage, I’m forced to shift focus from my current debt collection mission towards a means to fill my own coffers.

                              <span>Poslanci dnes ve třetím čtení schválili návrh zákona o digitálních financích. Cílem zákona je implementace předpisů Evropské unie v oblasti digitálních financí, konkrétně nařízení DORA (Digital Operational Resilience Act) o digitální provozní odolnosti finančního sektoru a nařízení MiCA (Markets in Crypto Assets) o trzích kryptoaktiv. Zákon nyní míří k projednání do Senátu ČR. U kryptoměn bude příjem do 100 tisíc Kč za zdaňovací období osvobozen od daně, podobně jako u cenných papírů, a to za podmínky jejich držení po dobu alespoň 3 let.</span>

                              <span>I think It’s safe to say that Trigger Happy Interactive’s upcoming survival horror Total Chaos is a bit of a palette change from their last offering - the frenetic, neon-drenched, chainsaw-legged Turbo Overkill. Still, it’s not often we see psychological horror combined with ultraviolence, and anything that gives off even a whiff of Condemned: Criminal Origins has my attention.
Total Chaos started life as a popular Doom 2 mod, and while I dare the say the limitations of that game sell the atmosphere a little better than this much sleeker update, I certainly trust Trigger Happy enough to make the most of the new engine. The game is set in New Oasis, a “once bustling haven for coal miners” that is now most definitely not bustling, nor haven-like.

                              <span>Nightdive, you done good. The Thing: Remastered is an ultra-sharp and commendably playable update to a game that history will remember as ‘actually a pretty good pick at Choices when you really just popped in to get some Revels but got embarrassed when the till staffer said “is that everything?” in a tone that could have been neutral but equally could have been a damning indictment of your character’.
I’m being slightly facetious here, of course. History actually remembers Computer Artworks’s 2002 shooty horror game for how incredibly ambitious and conceptually inventive its proto-sus social squad system was. In homage to the body-snatching alien paranoia of Carpenter’s 1982 horror classic, The Thing tasks you with not just assembling and directing a squad, but keeping them from breaking down or turning on you - in fear you might be hosting the titular molecular stowaway.

                              <span>Dogubomb’s Blue Prince boasts my favourite shapeshifting house in a video game, which admittedly isn’t setting a very high bar. Perhaps surprisingly, most video game houses do not shapeshift. Despite being made out of pure imagination and carbon emissions, they remain nostalgically shackled to the limitations of brick, mortar and Euclidean geometry. Blue Prince’s abode is different. It is a house made of house. You’ll actually design the layout yourself every time you wander through it, picking from a selection of mismatched room types whenever you open a door.

It’s the new turn-based tactics RPG from the creators of Battle Brothers, and look at that, it has a freshly deployed gameplay trailer.

                              <span>Covering announcement shows mean saving oneself for huge reveals, and since I might be the only person in the world right now this excited for FPS Mekkablood: Quarry Assault, I wondered if it might be better to hold off until a less pressing time. And then I thought, no: the people need to know. Not about the game itself, since it&#x27;s been announced for a while. Simply that I, personally, cannot resist a first person mech game where you have a fast food beverage inside your cockpit. It’s an extremely niche set of parameters and I’m elated it’s finally been fulfilled. Let’s chuffing gooooooooo!

                              <span>Anyone who is not trying to sell your something will tell you that ‘punk’ is a mostly meaningless term, mainly popularised by Malcolm McLaren and Vivian Westwood so they could sell bondage gear to teenagers. It is, of course, very punk of me to recognise this. However, this hasn’t stopped every other videogame released in the last 74 years trying to coin their own punk subgenre. The latest to do so is ‘brinepunk’ FPS Abyssus, which seems to have mostly arrived at the terms by being ‘a bit Steampunk, but underwater’. Abyssus looks cool, and so with the power vested in me by the Greggs vegan sausage roll I had for lunch today, I hereby declare that this is the last game allowed to do this. Let’s see if it’s making the most of it, at least.

                              <span>Ah, it feels just like yesterday when Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector had around a year of development time left. Actually, I’d say it feels like it precisely around February 2nd of this year. Well, would you look at that. It seems making excellent RPGs isn’t Jump Over The Age’s only skill. They’ve also predicted the exact release of their game to within a 3 day margin of error: the actual release date is the 31st of January, 2025.

                              <span>“So, you’ve fallen off a mountain,” strikes me as a brilliant book to write and then stock in every mountainside gift shop across the land, purely for the image of a falling climber rapidly scanning the pages as they tumble comically to their doom, searching for the one piece of sage advice that might alleviate their predicament. If you, personally, are reading RPS while falling off a mountain at this very moment, I’m afraid I can’t help you. Luckily, if you bonk your head on Steam on the way down, you’ll find a demo for stylish open world climbing game Cairn, which should hopefully distract you from your imminent pancaking.
Cairn is from The Game Bakers, of Furi and Haven fame. We first saw it at the Day Of The Devs this year. I was fresh off the lovely Jusant at the time. “Ah, another relaxing and whimsical French game about mountain climbing!” I thought. I was a fool. It’s far more intense, this one, although there are dashes of Breath Of The Wild and Death Stranding to add some whimsy and wonder to your Sisyphean struggle. Plus, it&#x27;s very pretty. Here’s some new footage, or possibly some old footage depending on badly the embargo has messed up my schedule.

                              <span>One of my favourite anime shows is Sakura Quest. It&#x27;s the story of an unemployed lady from Tokyo who accidentally gets herself appointed &quot;Queen&quot; of a struggling backwater village by the regional tourist board. From that case of mistaken identity proceeds 25 whole-ass episodes of Machiavellian haggling with crusty bigwigs over things like organising a concert. It&#x27;s playfully dull, heartily mundane entertainment. No supernatural flourishes here - just the magic of paperwork and the thrill of bureaucracy.


I&#x27;m reminded of Sakura Quest by Danchi Days, a forthcoming cosy adventure with irresponsibly enticing Game Boy Advance-style visuals. It casts you as Hoshino, a teenage girl who&#x27;s just moved to an old &quot;danchi&quot; housing complex and is trying to revive the yearly tradition of a summer festival. How will she do this? By means of haggling - haggling, and a bit of CSI.

                              <span>Developed by Mistwalker, a studio founded by Final Fantasy dad Hironobu Sakaguchi, Fantasian was originally released on Apple Arcade in 2021 and locked within the big fruit&#x27;s exclusivity cage. Now, though, Mistwalker and Square Enix have come together to re-release the RPG for us PC heads, calling it Fantasian Neo Dimension. It&#x27;s actually out today, too, if you&#x27;re interested in an interdimensional journey to reclaim some lost memories.

                              <span>The world is changing. Geopolitics are fractious and unnerving, environmental catastrophe seems more likely each day, and rampant digitally-disseminated disinformation further erodes our trust in one another. But I&#x27;ll let lesser reporters tell you about that stuff. I&#x27;m here to report that Capcom have made the big bonk feel good again. They’ve heard player feedback on the missing weapon oomph caused by the lack of hitstop in the Monster Hunter Wilds beta, and they’re bringing back the bonk.
Here’s a handy breakdown of the issue by X user Blue Stigma, but briefly: hitstop is the brief pause in an attack animation the moment the weapon connects with an enemy, giving you a real sense of bonkitude and making say, a hammer feel different from a dagger. As the video showed, the hitstop was greatly reduced in Wilds compared to previous Monster Hunters, and many players reported the combat just feeling a bit off as a result.

                              <span>I&#x27;ll come out and say it: I had no idea, really, what Infinity Nikki was about before I dove in. I knew from some trailers that it was a free-to-play game about collecting pretty dresses and exploring a relentlessly positive open world. In those respects, I was correct.
I&#x27;d just missed the really big part - the fact it&#x27;s a pacifistic Genshin Impact wearing a pretty dress. And as that realisation sunk in for the first time, my heart also sank with it. I really tried, I mean really tried to get into Nikki&#x27;s gacha offerings; to delight in its menagerie of menus and cash in countless currencies for fun socks or glitzy tiaras. Sadly, I won&#x27;t be logging back in ever again.

                              <span>Update: Roll the dice in 2025.
While it was formally revealed for PC and Xbox around a year ago, developer Jump Over the Age and publisher Fellow Traveller popped up at this weekend&#x27;s PC Gaming Show to announce that Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector will also launch on the Switch. What&#x27;s more, it&#x27;s been given a release window of early 2025.
If the title hasn&#x27;t given it away already, this is a follow-up to 2022&#x27;s excellent tabletop-inspired RPG Citizen Sleeper. Like its predecessor, Starward Vector will see you playing as an android (Sleeper) on the run from the company that made you. You&#x27;ll have to commandeer a ship, build up a crew and carry out as many tasks as possible before your decaying body halts your progress. A nice, stress-free experience, then...

                              <span>Update: European release coming &quot;later this month&quot;.
Nightdive Studios&#x27; The Thing: Remastered has been sitting on a 2024 release date for a while now, and while a post from the developer yesterday confirmed that it will definitely be coming in December (it is the last month of the year, after all), an Xbox Wire line-up might have given us an even more specific date (thanks to our pals at Pure Xbox for the heads up).
Titled &#x27;Next Week on Xbox: New Games for December 2 to 6&#x27;, the Xbox Wire post lists Nightdive&#x27;s remaster with a 5th December release date for Microsoft&#x27;s latest consoles and Game Pass. Now, this is yet to be confirmed by the developer and there&#x27;s obviously no guarantee that the Switch version will arrive on the same day, but this certainly seems like a real possibility.

It&#x27;s been years now since Nintendo opened the eShop floodgates and started letting everything in. In stark contrast to the Wii U days when even established developers had trouble getting their games on Nintendo platforms, the weekly update is now filled with games that would have been unthinkable just one console generation ago.
For all my moaning to come, I&#x27;ll make it clear up front that I&#x27;m not advocating going back to those dark days - the breadth and quantity of experiences you can download from the eShop is one of the great strides forward Nintendo made this gen. The problem that needs addressing is one of content management in an overcrowded storefront; for every promising-looking game and genuine gem, there are five cynical, bottom-of-the-barrel releases obscuring it.

                              <span>&quot;Some coincidence, huh?&quot;.
If you’ve recently played Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership, then chances are you might have noticed something rather familiar with its opening cutscene. That is, of course, if you’ve also seen The Super Mario Bros. Movie from Nintendo and Illumination.
You see, both the game and the movie feature our favourite platforming siblings hurtling through a portal, desperately clinging onto each other before ultimately being torn apart and flung into different locations.

Taiwan&#x27;s Criminal Police Bureau recently busted three individuals promoting unlock instructions for these apps to roughly 400,000 users.

While these conversions don&#x27;t knowingly violate any law, Spanish music industry group Promusicae reportedly labeled the service an audio download tool. In response, Google removed the URL from its search engine and banned the associated AdSense account.  However, after the MP3 site involved its lawyer, Google reversed its decision.

It also ends pretty decisively, save for a few hints about the future of Thedas in a secret post-credits scene. How final is that air of finality? Is Dragon Age going back on the shelf for the forseeable? Fear not, say game director Corinne Busche and series creative director John Epler, for the universe of Dragon Age has many yarns yet to spin. The next game won&#x27;t necessarily be an action game with RPG trappings, either, for much like Final Fantasy, Dragon Age exists in a state of continual &quot;reinvention&quot;.

It&#x27;s right there in the dog Latin of the title. It&#x27;s got Subnautica&#x27;s premise of being a shipwreck survivor starting afresh from an escape capsule, piecing together the backstory signal by signal, database entry by database entry. It&#x27;s got Subnautica&#x27;s core loop of exploring while dealing with the problem of decreasing oxygen, scavenging fist-sized chunks of raw material and scanning wreckage for blueprints, then crafting items and gear back at base.

                              <span>&quot;Bestest best?! We’ll have that!&quot; is how I imagine detective immersive sim Shadows Of Doubt made it on the roster for the Jingle Jam 2024 charity bundle. &quot;RPS have never steered us wrong before!&quot; they said, thus cementing our reputation as the most selflessly heroic gaming website, seven years running. What we can’t take credit for, however, is the 1.2 million quid they’ve raised already. If you want to make that number bigger, you can pick up the bundle here, and get 19 Steam keys for your trouble with a minimum donation of £35.
19 is such an annoying number in terms of the page layout that I’m almost convinced to never give to charity again, but there are some very nice games, including the aforementioned Shadows Of Doubt, Dungeons And Degenerate Gamblers, Citizen Sleeper, Another Crab’s Treasure, Two Point Campus, and Deathsprint 66.

The dwarven heroes of today’s game are much the same, except instead of using the chimney they will deploy pickaxes and power tools to burrow straight through your living room wall, and will make off with any minerals in the house rather than leaving them behind in a sock.

It may be worth holding back that excitement, though, until you&#x27;ve had a glance at the just-released PC requirements. If you want to run it so Indy&#x27;s hands are rendered at the recommended spec, you&#x27;ll need quite the beefy rig. If you want his hands ray traced, you&#x27;ll need something even juicier.

Over half the team who worked on the game will lose their jobs at Ubi studios in San Francisco, Osaka, and Sydney. The remaining workers are &quot;transitioning to other roles within Ubisoft.&quot;

While FACT warns that pirate operators risk criminal penalties, there appears to be no end in sight for the streaming piracy whack-a-mole.

                              <span>When I downloaded Creeper World IXE&#x27;s demo, I had it pegged as a bizarre original. It is, in fact, the latest in a series of real-time strategy games in which you position turrets and terraform maps to repel surging, simulated tides of purple liquid. This is a war between flesh and mineral, solidity and fluidity that dates back to the age of Gillen. Alex Wiltshire (RPS in peace) interviewed creator Virgil Wall back in 2019 - amongst other things, we learn that the original Creeper World was based on a &quot;failure&quot; - and Sin has an  enthusiastic piece from 2021 about Creeper World 4, the first 3D instalment.
What does Creeper World IXE bring to the party? Well, 1) it ain&#x27;t 3D, and 2) it&#x27;s billed as an exercise in &quot;dominating&quot; the titular Creeper, rather than keeping it at bay. For too long has this sloshing, coruscating hooligan been allowed to wash over and corrode our precious starports. We will take the fight to it in the shape of an upgradeable 2D starfleet, equipped with lasers we can use to chisel away the geography and re-rout the flow of villainous Vimto.

                              <span>Well slap my backplate and call me CUDA, because not only are Intel’s Arc Battlemage graphics cards not dead – having once been mired in production trouble rumours – but they’ve got names and are out from next week. The CPU makers’ second batch of dedicated gaming GPUs (following the decent budget-end Alchemist series) will comprise the Arc B580, releasing December 13th at $249, and the Arc B570, which arrives on January 16th from $219.

                              <span>Tic-tac-toe, known to British people as noughts and crosses, is a famously boring game that is nonetheless often played by anybody with a sweet wrapper, a pencil and five minutes to burn while waiting for any form of public transport. It&#x27;s boring because it&#x27;s a &quot;solved game&quot; whose outcomes can be safely predicted regardless of where you place your first nought or cross, allowing the &quot;perfect&quot; player to at least draw their opponent. It gets played regardless because a lot of people don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s a solved game - specifically, young children you may wish to humiliate using your superior grown-up brain, because when you were a child somebody did the same to you. 
How many twisted adults were born from the experience of being bullied via the medium of tic-tac-toe? We&#x27;d be better off without this game. But look! Here comes Tic Tactic to shake things up with a touch of Balatro.

After spending a few hours with a beefier build, I’m inclined to agree. But, much like Campus (which gave you real incentive to actually run a smooth operation that genuinely benefited the lazy ratbags stinking up your dorm halls) it’s that extra 15% that really makes all the difference.
James already covered the new exhibits system, and how acquiring and displaying them changes the way you run things, but such globetrotting adventures do little to rattle the pulse of a world-weary mapmuncher like me. No, what I’m actually most excited for when Two Point Museum releases next February is possibly the most ostensibly uninteresting feature added to any videogame ever - partition walls.

But at least video games can help us speculate. Heart Of The Machine is a cyberpunk 4X strategy game that will let players choose how a newly awakened AI sentience might behave once set loose upon a big future city. Developers Arcen Games call it a &quot;turn-based sci-fi 4X RPG&quot;, which is a lot of genres fighting for supremacy in one small phrase. It was announced last year, but today it gets a release date and an updated demo.

The real time strategy games will no longer be available to buy on the storefront from the 13th of December, but GOG have released a statement committing to maintaining and updating the games for existing owners as part of their preservation program. If you don’t own them already, they’re also currently on discount as a bundle.
&quot;We’re deeply saddened to share the news that Warcraft: Orcs and Humans and Warcraft II will leave our store on December 13th, 2024,” wrote GOG on X. &quot;Seeing these masterpieces leave our store is tough, but it also serves as another reminder of why our mission at GOG is so important. With that in mind, we’ve decided to update one aspect of the GOG Preservation Program’s policy.&quot; Here&#x27;s the critical line in ceremonial blockquote attire:

                              <span>Every now and then, somebody has the marvellous idea of developing technology that makes video games smell. I have never been more grateful for this recurrent Quixotic daydream&#x27;s mass market failure than when watching trailers for Urge, an open world survival shooter that is both fuelled and plagued by piss.


&quot;But hold your horses, young Edwin,&quot; you sternly interject. &quot;I do not wish to hear about, let alone play an open world survival shooter that is both fuelled and plagued by piss, on a website that children might read. It sounds like a cheap, taboo-jabbing gimmick.&quot; Friend, I once thought as you. But then I did a little research, as is my journalistic responsibility, and it turns out Urge&#x27;s notions about piss - bladdergold, as they call it in the West Country, or Crusoe Cola, as it&#x27;s known in the States - are rather in-depth. I&#x27;m still very glad I can&#x27;t smell the game, but I definitely have the urge to play it.

It’s the re-bargainating aspect we must concern ourselves with here, as the Logitech G413 SE – already a premier choice of affordable mechanical gaming keyboard – is now more attainable still, dropping to £65 / $56.

                              <span>Anyone with the need for a new CPU and even the slightest inclination towards tech envy is currently waiting for new stock of the AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D, the unbeatably powerful new chip that our boffin friends at Digital Foundry are calling the fastest gaming CPU ever. If, however, you’re hoping to switch to the 9800X3D from an older system with DDR4 RAM, you’ll need to upgrade that as well as the motherboard, as the entire Ryzen 9000 series only works with newer DDR5 memory.
Cyber Monday won’t help materialise more processors into retailers’ warehouses, but it can help you make this RAM switch on the cheap. Relatively speaking. And I can recommend a nice, fast 32GB kit of Corsair Vengeance DDR5, which is down by £43 in the UK and $22 in the US.

                              <span>While Mechabellum’s disparate roster of roast ’em riddle ‘em robots might initially seem to lack the characterful coherence of a writhing Zerg ecosystem or ancient Greek phalanx, this strategy autobattler’s array of lumbering tanks, hulking automata, and zippy fliers do share a common thread: each one of them has the potential to be either the most terrifying nuisance on the field, or to instantly crumble like a soggy strudel in an angry washing machine. With each mech able to become another mech&#x27;s worse nightmare, it becomes a game about stretching tight budgets to balance reactive counters with devastating offensives; about identifying the butterfly wings that can send tornados through your opponent’s ranks. It’s about the moments that eat up the hours like nothing else.

                              <span>There is some spiteful drama in the Half-Life modding scene this week. The developers of a heavily criticised mod for Half-Life 2 are intentionally blocking a small number of YouTubers from playing that mod, using Steam IDs to effectively blacklist and ban specific people from running it. Instead of launching the game as expected, these players will see the first-person shooter crash, alongside an error message that reads: &quot;STOP talking SH1T about us&quot;. This is an act of revenge for previous criticism of the mod, say the affected videofolks, who are described in the mod&#x27;s code as &quot;anticitizens&quot;.

                              <span>Today’s advent calendar window has an entire cult inside of it. Also, an alcoholic knight speaking in plummy prose between mouthfuls of booze and porridge. What’s more Christmassy than booze and porridge, eh? Not much, we’ll wager. You could pour the booze in the porridge, perhaps? You could call it ‘inebrioats’!

                              <span>‘Confident’ game design is one of those slightly fluffy critic words I sometimes find myself reaching for tenuously, knowing that - sigh - I’m going to have to do all sort of detestable nonsense like ‘back up my vague assertion with concrete examples that are useful to the reader’ if I do. Yuck. If there’s one type of design that deserves the accolade, though, it’s RPGs that are assured enough in the richness of their worlds to not feel the need to signpost every discovery.
It’s a feedback loop of charitable feelings: the game is saying &quot;we think you’re smart enough to find this stuff on your own&quot;. &quot;You’re right!&quot; you respond. &quot;I am smart! And anyone who recognises that must be one smart cookie&quot;. Joy abounds, it rains Tunnock’s Caramel Wafers, hedgehogs jig gracefully in the street, and all is right with the world. So, I must say, I’m quite pleased to hear Avowed’s environment region director Berto Ritger sing the virtues of missable content to GamesRadar.

                              <span>I had a horrible dream last night that I had to spend a whole day, as well as a good chunk of the preceding week, rounding up discounted PC hardware. Chilling visions indeed. Good thing today is only Cyber Monday, meaning I can get away with spending a mere 80-85% of the day rounding up discounted PC hardware. Like this: this more powerful Ryzen Z1 Extreme edition of the Asus ROG Ally, a handheld Windows PC that beats the Steam Deck on 720p games performance. With £100 off in the UK and £150 off in the States, it’s now a much closer match on price as well.

                              <span>Last week, Brendy left a note in our weekly Maw liveblog about a player-made map of Caves Of Qud, the reportedly excellent sci-fi roguelike RPG that lets you &quot;chisel through layers of thousand-year-old civilizations&quot;, represented as 2D Dwarf Fortress-esque layouts. Glancing over that map as a newcomer to the game, my eye was caught by the creator&#x27;s casual mention that Caves Of Qud is technically 2,147,483,646 levels deep.
&quot;Is Caves Of Qud really 2,147,483,646 levels deep?&quot; I asked Brendy, like a wide-eyed child asking whether there is such a thing as dog heaven. Brendy wasn&#x27;t sure. (About Caves Of Qud, I mean, not dog heaven.) So I put the question to one of the developers, Freehold Games co-founder Brian Bucklew. In brief, the answer is yes, but with some significant caveats.

                              <span>One of the many high concept ludonarrative experiments I’d one day like to bring to fruition is an immersive sim in which the player has access to many guns, but their default arsenal selection is an open packet of crisps which they hold out in front of them, in first person, and offer to NPCs. Some NPCs wouldn’t be swayed by this, but some would lower their weapons at the offer of a prawn cocktail treat, and so you’d be constantly playing chicken with various guards: edging closer toward them, your shaking hands rattling the delicious disks inside the oily packet, mentally weighing up whether it&#x27;s worth risking them turning hostile at the last second.
Obviously, I’d scan some real crisp packets and just alter the logos for maximum immersion. One game that’s already taken this scanned bricolage concept and run with it to beautiful effect is Hyperdrive Inn. It’s an avant garde point and click adventure from Finnish studio Horsefly, where the entire world is constructed from scanned fabric samples. Have a looksee.

In just a handful of weeks, Horace the Endless Bear shall strike the brazen gong labelled &quot;Happy holidays&quot; and atomise the world, that it may be born anew in 2025. Before that, we must heap the Maw high with any remaining new video games or video game news from 2024. Find below a few new PC releases for the pile. I thought it was going to be a quiet week, but it&#x27;s actually quite a boisterous haul.

This weekend, AnimeFenix added to the trouble with a &#x27;voluntary&#x27; shutdown citing more copyright pressure. &quot;Piracy will never go away as long as there are companies with more greed than heart,&quot; the AnimeFenix team notes in its farewell message.

Do bits of your HUD keep disappearing? Be of good cheer, for GSC Game World have released the first proper S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart Of Chornbyl update, which patches out over 650 different bugs and issues. These range from more significant problems such as crashing and progression-blockers in certain missions, to relatively negligible stuff like wonky NPC voice volume during storms.

Just an endless cycle of microSD cards, mice, microSD cards, mice. At least it’s a good&#x27;un, though - the best Steam Deck-compatible microSD of them all, in fact. Previously, its one weakness was the lack of a truly cavernous 1TB model, but that was amended earlier this year, and now that capacity is getting its first major saving as part of Black Friday 2024.

                              <span>Cyber Knights Colon Flashpoint does not lead with its best foot. This is easier to shrug off while it&#x27;s still in early access, but I will confess some relief when I read that the Trese Brothers (It&#x27;s pronounced &quot;Trese&quot;) nudged their estimated release date back to 2025. It needs a bit longer. But I&#x27;m about ready to start recommending it.
I&#x27;m a tad biased by my love for their previous Star Traders Colon Frontiers, an interest in mercenary management, and a wish for more turn-based tactics games that aren&#x27;t bloody XCOM again. That I have reservations about what CKF hasn&#x27;t yet nailed down is in part a symptom of high expectations. And because despite carrying over some design ethos from Frontiers, Cyber Knights is a very different kind of game.

                              <span>Back when Digital Extremes were largely known for collaborating with Epic Games on the Unreal Tournament series, they made a little game called Dark Sector. Released in 2008, it&#x27;s part of the fine tradition of post-Gears double-A actioners that basically consist of taking a gruff man, throwing him into a world of grit, gravel and burning oil drums, and handing him a murderous gimmick. Dark Sector&#x27;s gimmick was the glaive, a pointy boomerang you could use to scoop up objects, solve puzzles, and kill stuff in third-person view.

                              <span>To be clear, I still think the best graphics card deal of Black Friday week is that RTX 4070 Super offer and oh no wait that one’s gone now. But even if hadn’t been ecommerced to death, there’d still be a way to get the upgraded ray tracing and DLSS 3 frame gen tools of the RTX 40 series for less cash still: plucky 1080p contender, the RTX 4060, whose deals are still very much available and kicking.
In the UK, the best available prices are for the MSI GeForce RTX Ventus 2X Black edition, which is the partner card I happen to own myself – and has become the effective go-to GPU for RPS game performance tests. Over in the US, meanwhile, the Gigabyte GeForce RTX 4060 Gaming OC is the most affordable of all; it’s a chunkier design than that of the compact Ventus 2X, though that’s mainly just the tradeoff for having an extra fan. These cards were already on the cheaper end of the RTX 4060 spectrum, and now they’re £30 / $35 off in the sales. Bargain.

                              <span>As far as Black Friday deals go, the Logitech G502 Hero isn’t so much low-hanging fruit as it is a root vegetable. Every year, this damned multi-buttoned mouse goes on sale, and every year, I’m powerless to avoid writing about it. Can’t even be bothered to take a different header image photo. It’s partly your fault, you know. You like it too much.
This time it’s down from £80 to £26 in the UK (£27 outside the Bezos Empire), which isn’t quite an all-time low, but is pretty close – and a silly-good price for such a capable mouse in any case. Its US discount price of $35 ain’t half bad either, though I notice Amazon US is shouting louder about knocking the newer G502 X down from $80 for $45. That’s mostly a fine mouse as well, though I find its redesigned scroll wheel a bit too much on scratchy side. Of the two, I’d stick with the classic.

                              <span>You can now knock down enemy dirtbags using a dinner plate as a violent frisbee in Selaco. Wonderful. The first-person shooter, which is replete with satisfying explosions, gunfire, bullet ricochets, smashing glass, sparks, goo, blood spatters, dust, ice particles, smoke, flecks of plaster, and bad guys yelling at one another about how she&#x27;s over there, may be described as noisy, both in the aural and visual sense of the word. Which is how we like it, you understand. This latest update to the early access shooter leans into that by layering on even more juicy shootFX. It also adds a whole new game mode and plenty of other tweaks. The bad news is that some story bits are now delayed.

                              <span>Seeing great games sell too poorly for the pursestring goblins to shell out for a sequel is always a heartache, but it really stung to learn that the incredible Dead Space remake didn’t catch on enough for EA to greenlight a remake of Dead Space 2 (even if EA were a little spotty on the details). Doubly so in the wake of The Callisto Protocol - a game I still think is worth picking up on a deep discount, if you like hitting gross things with a big bit of metal. It’s quite exciting, then, to learn that the next game from Lies Of P developer Round 8 Studios might just replace that severed limb. Alongside a sequel to the puppety soulslike, they’re also working on a sci-fi survival horror game, via Eurogamer.

Created by &quot;a global team of veteran game developers&quot;, it&#x27;s the story of a Palestinian woman grappling with the loss of her baby after fleeing a bloody assault on her town.

Yet they’re also both very good at what they do, and are now sharing Black Friday discount honours.

Rather than do the usual routine of just suggesting the WD Black SN850X again, however, there’s no better SSD-for-yer-money deal right now than the Crucial T500, which is going for an exceptionally low £58 right now for the 1TB capacity – down from £120. The 2TB version is also an excellent buy at £100, and there are decent offers up for grabs in the US too.

                              <span>Okay okay, just one more handheld deal then I’ll look at some desktop stuff. But here’s a properly chunky Black Friday discount on the most endearingly out-there Steam Deck rival to date, the Lenovo Legion Go: the 512GB model has shed hundreds of pounds/dollaridoos to fall all the way to £479 / $500. That’s really not a lot for something that goes full luxe on its display and build quality, not to mention its party trick of letting the two controller sections split off, Nintendo-switch style, with one acting as a portable mouse.
This is also the cheapest that the Legion Go has ever gone, at least in the UK, so could make a good pickup if you’ve been wanting something with more power than the Steam Deck range but have been put off by the Legion Go or Asus ROG Ally X’s high launch pricing.

                              <span>Happy Black Friday, I definitely don’t say with a gun pressed into my spine. These days, of course, Black Friday sort of just starts whenever retailers feel like it, which is why we’ve already seen the kind of Steam Deck microSD deals that I’d have normally spent this morning writing up. Instead, here’s an alternate for the more eager screwdriverists among you: up to 50% off the Crucial P310, currently our top pick of the recent breed of Steam Deck replacement SSDs.

                              <span>I greatly enjoyed tooting with my mouse in Trombone Champ on a flat monitor, but in retrospect it&#x27;s the perfect candidate for conversion to virtual reality. It&#x27;s small in scope, for one, but also VR would let you see through the eyes of the tooter and slide your trombone note up and down by holding the motion controllers up to your face.

So it is in Trombone Champ: Unflattened, a VR spin-off that&#x27;s out now.

                              <span>It&#x27;s almost the end of November, which means it is technically but not spiritually still autumn. It is spiritually winter, the season of wearing gloves and using my phone&#x27;s flashlight to look for my dog&#x27;s poos in the long grass. Yet it&#x27;s not the Steam winter sale that started yesterday, but the Steam autumn sale. 

Discounts are definitely never a bad thing, but Steam sales used to feel like big events on the PC gaming calendar. They don&#x27;t anymore, to me. Friends, are Steam sales still exciting to you?

The research also links higher piracy rates and socioeconomic factors such as youth unemployment and income inequality. Higher average incomes and increased awareness of legal alternatives reduce piracy.

                              <span>In Ndemic Creations&#x27; mobile strategy sim Plague Inc, you nurture a disease and attempt to spread it across the world. Originally launched in 2012, the game saw a morbid upsurge in popularity during the early years of Covid, as millions of people sought to model the pandemic&#x27;s advance or just play out their anxieties. Perhaps seeking to wash away any lingering bad karma, Ndemic have now unveiled After Inc: Revival, a blend of city builder and miniature 4X set in the aftermath of a zombie apocalypse. In Plague Inc, you brought the world to an end; now, you must grow it anew from the wreckage.

But what if you could not only survive it, but tame it?
I am Bohdan Beastmaster, aspiring wrangler of all the radiation-twisted insults to God that occupy the Zone. One of its rogue Artifacts exploded my flat, and rather than find a place on SpareRoom, I’ve gone for the easier and safer option of venturing into the wilds of Chornobyl – armed not with rusty AKs or scavenged grenades but the teeth and claws of my mutant soon-to-be companions. The absence of any actual fauna-influencing tools or techniques only makes my plan even simpler: find beasts, aggro beasts onto human enemies, win.

                              <span>All that writing about gaming earbuds yesterday has reignited my appreciation for the HyperX Cloud Alpha Wireless, the PC headset I’ve been donning every day for... ooh, maybe two and a half years now? It sounds lovely, is comfortable enough to wear for hours, and has such a long battery life that we should probably just consider it witchcraft by now. Also, it’s just had its price cut for Black Friday week, dropping to a very agreeable £110 in the UK and $126.

According to a report, it&#x27;s now a class action suit that could benefit any developers or publishers who have sold a game over the Steam store on or after 28th January 2017.

He sounds annoyed. The field hospital is gone, probably blown to pieces. Troops keep wandering north and disappearing from view, only to come flying back as airborne cadavers moments later. The number of corpses and spilled backpacks on the road imply that someone in battalion headquarters (if such a place even exists) has made a terrible decision. If the Colonial forces want to win the persistent online war of Foxhole, suggests the sergeant with his many irritated noises, then someone needs to piece these dying fools together. As the only medic in a 500 metre radius, that means me.

                              <span>The genre of &#x27;Action RPG&#x27; is supremely annoying to write about, because the term can mean different things to different people, but here’s how I see it: Diablo 4 and similar games, such as Path Of Exile, are &#x27;ARPGs&#x27;. Which stands for &#x27;Action RPG&#x27;. But Zelda games are &#x27;Action RPGs&#x27;, which is a totally different genre that you could, if you felt like it, also shorten to &#x27;ARPG&#x27;. So, to summarise: ARPGs and ARPGs are two different things, and both are Action RPGs. Got it? Great.
It’s because of this kerfuffle that I’m not exactly mad at Diablo boss Rod Fergusson recently suggesting that we just call games that are similar to Diablo &#x27;Diablo-likes&#x27;. I just find it very funny that he’s the one saying it, in a bold faced act of admittedly very inconsequential linguistic colonialism that carries the unspoken connotation that something is &quot;like the game I make, but a bit crap&quot;.

                              <span>Back in January I wrote a (supporters only) post about how tired I am of all survival games starting off the same. Here&#x27;s the gist of it: I&#x27;ve had enough of gathering rocks and sticks to make a crafting bench, from which I&#x27;m forced to build a hut and so on. I&#x27;m sure for some this is riveting, but for me, it&#x27;s something I tire of within seconds.
And so it&#x27;s with a heavy heart I say that Towers Of Aghasba suffers from the same starting gamut of sticks and stones. There&#x27;s a hint of some interesting ecosystem stuff springing up a bit later, and judging by the trailers, an ability to clamber on massive flying creatures made of what looks like elephant skin and hair. Still, I just can&#x27;t do it.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve gone on record as not being a huge fan of the artstyle choices used in the new Warcraft I &amp; II remasters. It&#x27;s crisp and readable, sure, but I&#x27;m never exactly thrilled to see all the roughness of older sprites completely done away with, especially when I always felt some of that ruggedness was the point. The tendency of remasters to treat every characterful oddity as a blemish is a wider topic than the scope of this article, but one day, Bluepoint will remaster Bloodborne, and the world will feel my pain. 
Anyway. Nowadays, I&#x27;d say Blizzard - or, World Of Warcraft, at least - is pretty much synomous with a softer, more colorful approach to fantasy worlds. While I don&#x27;t pine for a return to the more boobily ridiculous elements of Frank Frazetta&#x27;s style, I do often wish that some of the more expressive, pained, and physically grounded elements of classic Sword And Sorcery art was a bit more common. I&#x27;m no art scholar, and there&#x27;s undoubtedly a bit of tunnel vision of my part to this assertion, but as far as as pop culture goes: I see the Blizzard version of fantasy more than I see the Frazetta version, and I don&#x27;t exactly love it. Same goes for the older, punkier, less uniform sci-fi art from things like 2000 AD and Warhammer 40,000. Edwin touched on some of this in his excellent Space Marine piece. 
Anyway, a valued RPS community member on the Discord shared an older bit of art by Blizzard&#x27;s Chris Metzen, from the original Starcraft manual. I figured a few of you might enjoy seeing these older pieces, considering how much the overall look of their games has changed over the years.

                              <span>The Cabin Factory is described as a horror game but it&#x27;s sort of about deciding whether you are, in fact, playing a horror game. There is indeed a factory and it does indeed produce cabins - jolly, Center Parcs-style affairs made of big, merry logs, which roll up fully constructed on a conveyor belt. Your job is to enter and inspect them in first-person. What are you inspecting them for? Ghosts.

                              <span>Picking things up. Putting the things in boxes. Setting prices. Managing employees. Wiping the sweat from your creased brow and knowing, even if your meagre salary doesn’t get you very far, at least you put in an honest day’s graft to acquire it. All things done by pathetic fools that don’t realise the true CEO grindset actually involves no-wifing Diablo 4 all day and subsisting entirely off the the Lucozade-bottled urine of overworked drivers forced to make the agonising decision between self respect and continued employment. I might be conflating billionaires here.
Also, coincidentally, all things you can do in the demo for Beff Jezos Simulator. Now, work simulation games aren’t my absolute favourite. But, hey, I do love a good fantasy game. And what spellbinding vision of a farflung reality could be more fantastical than a game in which a billionaire actually does some work?

                              <span>Way back in June, treacherous, fickle Larian declared that Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 patch 7 would be their final handover to players of the well-good D&amp;D RPG, with the focus then shifting internally to Larian&#x27;s two currently untitled new game projects. CEO Swen Vincke did, however, caveat that while the overall level of post-release support would be &quot;diminished&quot;, there would be a few more updates. We interpreted that to mean bug fixes and the like. Certainly, I wasn&#x27;t expecting brand new subclasses for every class in the game, which is what you&#x27;ll get with the just-announced Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 patch 8, together with new crossplay functionality and a full-figured photo mode.

The operation eventually drew an audience of millions but, in true drama fashion, announced its own demise this week. The site&#x27;s operators cite &#x27;copyright&#x27; as the reason and recent domain name troubles and pressure from Hollywood studios likely played a role.

                              <span>Let&#x27;s face it, nothing important happens in December. I&#x27;m scheduling 24 advent calendar posts this week and then spending the rest of the year eating boxes of Cadbury Mini Yule Logs Triple Chocolate. So it&#x27;s no surprise that Devolver have announced their remaining slate of games aiming for release in 2024 are actually coming out in 2025.

The games that slipped are Baby Steps, Skate Story, and Stick It To The Stickman. Devolver released the news with typical style, via the 15th annual Devolver Delayed awards, which you can watch below.

                              <span>Slipways was the best grand strategy game I&#x27;d played in years, because it tossed out all the genre&#x27;s micromanagement in favour of a strategy puzzle where all your exploiting, expanding, et ceteraing could be squeezed into an hour&#x27;s play. That game began as a PICO-8 prototype by designer Jakub Wasilewski before being polished to a fine shine in its full release.

All of which is just lead-in to talking about Solitomb, a solitaire-based dungeon crawler in which you fight demons by building hands of playing cards. It&#x27;s currently - heywaitaminute - a pay-what-you-want PICO-8 prototype by designer Jakub Wasilewski where &quot;all money earned goes towards making the bigger version possible.&quot; Like Slipways, it already seems like a frightfully clever piece of design.

                              <span>Announced last year, Exo Rally Championship does what the name suggests: takes the rugged, weather-battered terrain of Exo One&#x27;s interplanetary journey and replaces the ponderous plot and gravitational rise-and-fall spaceship movement with a six-wheel, space buggy rally competition. Or put another way, if Exo One was Christopher Nolan&#x27;s Tiny Wings, then this is Colin McRae&#x27;s Interstellar.

Now there&#x27;s a demo, and it&#x27;s substantial with a tutorial, a 10 stage rally, and three &quot;ever-changing Daily Stages with online Steam leaderboards.&quot;

                              <span>I have one urgent request for Starward Industries, creators of the just-announced “anti-combat” survival RPG Dante’s Ring – don’t use the phrase “ring of fire” in your English marketing materials. I get that you’re going for a cocktail of Divina Commedia and FromSoftware associations, but you have to remember that this is the internet and we&#x27;re all desperately crude. I can’t speak for people from other English-language countries, but when I hear somebody talking about their &quot;ring of fire&quot;, I tend to assume they’ve been at the vindaloo.

                              <span>System requirements are on the rise, and a glut of recent PC facepunchers has left some of the RPS treehouse wondering if it’s time for a graphics card upgrade. Being a helpful colleague and a handsome friend, I dutifully informed them that the highly capable Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Super is currently getting the Black Friday price cut treatment, with Zotac’s Twin Edge model dropping especially low in both the UK and US. Still, dear readers, if you feel like punishing us for that comment system switch, you could always head over to Amazon and buy up all the stock yourself.
$590 is a decent deal for a model that’s spent most of the past few months at $610, but us Brits are getting the better bargain here - even if it’s not for the OC version. £500 means a hefty £49 slasheroo, the deepest discount this card has seen yet, and you’ll also get a key for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle to play when it releases on December 9th.

                              <span>It&#x27;s often claimed by liars and fools that our website&#x27;s title is a clever reference to the ancient Chinese game of shoushiling - or &quot;rock paper scissors&quot;, as it&#x27;s known overseas. The orthodox interpretation is that &quot;Rock Paper Shotgun&quot; is a folksy regional variation on this, with a &quot;shotgun&quot; instead of the &quot;scissors&quot;. But friends, this is patently absurd. Think about it: a game that pits a shotgun against a rock or piece of paper would be incredibly one-sided. It goes against reason!
The sad reality is that the origins of our website&#x27;s title have been deliberately obscured, allowing cold hard fact to slither back into legend. Behind that mockingly nonsensical moniker sleeps an eldritch truth of such gravity it would make Gandalf spill his mead. Friends, the Rock Paper Shotgun is real. The Weapon exists. Or at least, it once did - and will, for I mean to fashion it anew by combing the writing of RPS writers gone by for raw materials. And in this endeavour, I will naturally need your aid.

                              <span>A two-year pirate IPTV investigation directed by the Catania District Attorney&#x27;s Office in Italy, involving Europol, Eurojust, and law enforcement agencies across Europe, culminated in the early hours of this morning. Operation Takendown reportedly dismantled an international pirate IPTV network serving 22 million users and generating an estimated €3 billion per year. At least 11 suspects were detained, over 100 are under investigation.

Cisco had discontinued its OpenDNS service in France due to the legal restrictions, so only Google and Cloudflare put up a defense, but without the desired result.

These services do not discriminate, so whether &#x27;customers&#x27; are pirates or just regular people hoping to buy content, everyone is a potential victim. The scam has been running for at least 20 years yet, seemingly out of nowhere, pro site-blocking studies now describe it as a major piracy-related security threat.

                              <span>We&#x27;ve been working for a while on the next ScummVM release, and it is time for a call for public testing.
Support for a number of new engines and games for the existing ones was added, and we need your special attention to the following titles:
Orion Burger.
Total Eclipse and Total Eclipse 2.
Thimbleweed Park.
The Space Bar.
Moonbase Commander. (with multiplayer support)
Backyard Basketball.
Unrest.
Rise of the Dragon.
Castle Master.
Wait for it! Issue 3. Song for a Hare. (Ну, погоди! Выпуск 3. Песня для зайца)
Mask Show. (Маски-шоу)
Marvellous Mice Adventures: Meeting Sea Rat. (Три маленькие белые мышки. Визит Морской крысы)
The Adventures of the Good Soldier Schweik. (Похождения бравого солдата Швейка)
Marvellous Mice Adventures: Sea Rat&#x27;s Birthday. (Три маленькие белые мышки. День рождения морской крысы)
Besides these newly supported games, almost half of the current 108 engines have notable changes. Thus, testing more games is always a good thing.
All testing must be done with stable builds, not development ones. Please report bugs or oddities on our issue tracker.
A detailed list of all exciting new features and fixes is available in our NEWS file.
We are looking forward to your reports about successful and unsuccessful playthroughs and bugs reported!

                              <span>Castle Master, the haunting conclusion to the Freescape engine saga, is now ready for public testing!
Prepare yourself for a perilous adventure as you lower the drawbridge to enter the Castle Master’s domain. Released in 1990 by Incentive Software, Castle Master became popular for its technical innovation and challenging gameplay. The game inspired countless 3D adventure titles, and the Freescape engine itself marked a technological milestone, enabling groundbreaking object interaction and spatial puzzles.
Notably, Castle Master was one of the first games to let you choose to play as either a prince or a princess, offering a different experience depending on your choice.
Your mission: rescue your twin, imprisoned within the eerie depths of Castle Eternity by the evil Magister. This sprawling, foreboding castle is filled with traps, monsters, and puzzles blocking your path. Gather items, unlock doors, and solve complex riddles as you navigate the labyrinthine halls and confront the dark forces within.
This modern reimplementation showcases enhanced graphics using OpenGL, with initial support for the DOS and ZX Spectrum releases. If you’re eager to embark on this dark journey, a playable demo is available to test your tenacity.
To participate in the testing, ensure you have a daily development build. We encourage all players to submit feedback and bug reports through our issue tracker.
Will you brave the creepy corridors of Castle Eternity and free your sibling, or will you fall victim to the Magister’s curse and join his army of enslaved spirits? The adventure awaits!
