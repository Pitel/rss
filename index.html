                              <span>Pokémon Go frequently hosts limited-time events, typically only lasting a day or even one hour. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s crucial to keep track of the game&#x27;s event schedules, or else you may lose out on an exclusive new team member. To stay updated, here&#x27;s the current Pokémon Go Community Day schedule for June 2024.


When is the next Community Day in Pokémon Go?


The next Community Day for Pokémon Go launches on July 21 from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. local time. The Electric-type, Tynamo, will be the star of the show, including a rare Shiny variant. Make sure to tune into the event during its active times to encounter more Tynamos in the wild.

                              <span>Rocket League is a free-to-play game where you play football with cars. Those who may have finally decided to give this game a try by playing a couple of matches or returning players who have not played for a long time may end up wondering about the Blueprint reward they’ve just received after completing an online match.


Blueprints can help players craft completely new items. Blueprints in Rocket League provide players with information about an item, and players can craft it using Credits. 


Players obtain Credits by spending money to get the virtual currency. Blueprints tell you exactly what item you’ll receive upon crafting. This system replaced Crates back in 2019, which were opened using Keys. You may also earn some unrevealed Blueprints, and you can check the exact item a Blueprint…</span>

                              <span>Fortnite, the popular battle royale game, is seemingly set to introduce another Marvel superhero skin soon. A reliable Fortnite leaker, @ShiinaBR on Twitter, has revealed that Epic Games is looking to bring the ‘Weapon X’ skin to Fortnite. 


The skin will have five items as part of the cosmetic bundle and is based on a character from Marvel&#x27;s X-Men series. Shiina claims that the skin will arrive in Fortnite on July 5, but its shop section is “still unfinished” at the moment.




For those unfamiliar, Weapon X was the codename for the Wolverine after he underwent a series of twisted experiments to create the perfect weapon. The leaked Fortnite skin carries the look inspired by the comics and the X-Men &#x27;97 animated series, with Wolverine wearing a metal helmet that is used to control him. Those who have seen the X-Men Apocalypse movie would also be able to recognise the skin, as the movie featured a cameo from Hugh Jackman donning the Weapon X look.


Since we’re on the subject, it is more than plausible that the Wolverine skin is coming in to continue the hype, not just for the revived X-Men &#x27;97 animated series but also for the Deadpool and Wolverine movie, which is slated for a release next month on July 26.


Fortnite has long been the home for crossovers in gaming, with collaborations across pop culture with artists, movie characters, and more. There have been a handful of Marvel characters who have made their way to the game, some even as playable characters. Iron Man, Doctor Strange, Thanos, Loki, Captain America, Spider-Man, and Thor are just some of the many who have been added to Fortnite at some point. Most recently, Hulk and Hela were added in Chapter 5 Season 2 in April 2024, and interestingly, it was their look from Thor: Ragnarok, the MCU movie that came out in 2017.

The choices have never been more bountiful, as EA Sports added three new options last year, and all of them have their respective strengths and weaknesses. All formations and their effectiveness will also depend on your playstyle and skills. But it&#x27;s a well-known fact that certain sets of tactics are outright better, and they operate more efficiently than the rest.


EA FC 24 formations tier list: Best to worst


I have used a five-point system to grade each formation based on how they operate on the meta. While the tier lists can slightly change based on how you want to play, the ones belonging to the S and A tier are always going to be better when used in…</span>

                              <span>Bioware’s upcoming Dragon Age: The Veilguard title will have a Quality and Performance mode on the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S consoles at launch, an EA representative told IGN. Typically the Quality mode setting on the consoles targets 30 FPS and prioritizes fidelity. As for the Performance mode, the game will look to target 60 FPS.


While the existence of Quality and Performance modes is welcoming news, the EA representative did not reveal the resolution that these modes would be running the game at. However, the typical expectation from the Quality mode would be 4K native resolution whereas the performance mode will look to hit 60 FPS at 1440p resolution. Dragon Age: The Veilguard is built on the Frostbite Engine.


The EA rep told IGN, “Dragon Age: The Veilguard will feature performance and quality modes on consoles to ensure players can choose the visual fidelity they prefer. We’ll have more to share on exact performance as we finish development in the coming months.”


Dragon Age: The Veilguard, the title originally announced as Dragon Age: Dreadwolf, was recently showcased at the Xbox Games Showcase. The title will take place 10 years after the events of Dragon Age: Inquisition, 2014’s Game of the Year. Players will get to travel to new locations in Thedas, and Dragon Age: The Veilguard will feature Solas as the antagonist. 


Dragon Age: The Veilguard will be released on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. The game is slated for a release in Fall 2024.

                              <span>Aetheryte Tickets are a really useful item which can be used to teleport anywhere you like in Final Fantasy XIV without the usual cost of Gil. Sadly, these often go overlooked, but at the start of a new expansion, it would be handy to have some in your pocket. 


It’s weird that this item often gets forgotten by players, but I’m here to remind you that they exist and you should probably get some. 


Get Aetheryte Tickets in exchange for Hunt Seals

The easiest way to purchase Aetheryte Tickets is through exchanging Allied Seals with your chosen Grand Company’s Billmaster. Each Aetheryte Ticket costs 5 Allied Seals, which can be gained through taking part in The Hunt or Blue Mage activities. 


Billmasters can be found in the following locations inside of your c…</span>

The biggest highlight of this update remains the nerf for Bloodhound and Bangalore, the popular duo that has been dominating the meta lately. In fact, both Legends were the top picks during the ALGS Split 1 Playoffs, with their pick rate significantly above the rest.


The biggest change takes aim at Bloodhound&#x27;s vision. The Legend will no longer be able to see through Bangalore smoke or Caustic gas, taking away a major tactical advantage. Bloodhound’s add-on abilities have also been tweaked, as their Level 2 Upgrade ability Raven’s Blessing will only reduce Ultimate charge to 20%,…</span>

The odds are more stacked than ever against the main cast, and that’s a great thing.

Boosters are passive buffs you can get and equip in Helldivers 2, and they&#x27;re worth the price.


Boosters can be unlocked in Helldivers 2 via Warbonds (the game&#x27;s version of seasonal content). They&#x27;re not exactly cheap, with some appearing as exclusive Premium Warbond unlocks. But you should consider unlocking them as soon as you can, as they can be a great boon for you and your team. As mentioned, Boosters are passive buffs you can equip. They range from boosting your radar range to improving health or stamina.

I haven’t really touched Cities: Skylines 2 since the debacle of its launch. Most of my major complaints about it were in regard to its visuals and its unavoidable litany of bugs. I would, however, probably have some difficult in differentiating whether any given issue was working as intended or just bugged. Mechanically, however, I thought things were fine.


But while I didn’t see any deep issues with the economic simulation, the Economy 2.0 patch notes make me question if I should have. Many of the facets of a city’s workings have been completely revamped in a way that feel like they shoul…</span>

                              <span>It’s not often that a real-life place I’m familiar with gets turned into a staple from Final Fantasy XIV, but today is apparently an exception to this, with London King’s Cross train station getting its very own Aetheryte. 


The sculpture has appeared ahead of the FFXIV London Fan Meet on June 24, where players can come together and share stories, memories, and potentially even meet some of their Eorzean friends in real life. 




When announced on June 17, the available 150 tickets to the London Fan Meet sold out in under an hour. Those who were lucky enough to get tickets, as well as those who weren’t, have been heading into London King’s Cross to attune to this real-life Aetheryte. 


It must be nice for those traveling down to London to be met with something familiar from Final Fantasy XIV. Honestly, I’m a little bit tempted to head down to London myself, as this sculpture will only be in its spot today. While the sculpture is definitely not life-sized, it’s still nice to see something from a game that I love so openly placed in the real world.


However, the London Fan Meet has begun ripples of a discussion among players about the lack of notice provided. The meet was announced at 11 a.m. on a Monday morning, when the majority of FFXIV players would be at work. Even if they did manage to see the Tweet, it’s unlikely that they could get time off work with only a few days&#x27; notice. 


The Aetheryte in the area outside King’s Cross is another example of this. There are a huge number of British players who I’m sure would have loved the chance to see it, but it will be gone after today. 


Regardless, this is still a pretty cool thing to know is happening, even if I can’t attend myself. And I’m sure there are a lot of confused Londoners wondering why people are trying to touch the strange blue rock, which is certainly an amusing thought.

                              <span>Now that we&#x27;ve spent some in Season 4&#x27;s initial phase, it&#x27;s time to gear up for the mid-season update. Here&#x27;s when MW3 and Warzone Season 4 Reloaded releases, and what to expect.


When does MW3 and Warzone Season 4 Reloaded start?


MW3 and Warzone Season 4 Reloaded will be released on June 26, 2024, at 9 a.m. PT/11 a.m. CST/12 p.m. EST.

Breach Executable has Guardians working with Failsafe to determine the cause for the Vex&#x27;s unusual behavior. Rather than be a static activity, there&#x27;s a little variety to be had, including reward potential. Here&#x27;s a breakdown of each encounter and how to maximize your loot.


There&#x27;s a disappointing lack of black leather in the Vex Matrix


The underlying task in each of Breach Executable&#x27;s activities is to collect Extracted Data and turn it in at the collection point once the Data Collection meter is full. The faster you fill the activity meter, the quicker you can move to the next activity.


Extracted Data looks like Vex data cubes and is both a competitive and shared resource. When a gaggle of cubes appears,…</span>

                              <span>Focus features has released the long-awaited teaser trailer for Robert Eggers&#x27; reimagining of the vampire classic, Nosferatu. It&#x27;s absolutely spine-tingling.




Though the teaser threatens a vampiric threat capable of consuming an entire town, the The VVitch and Lighthouse filmmaker is promising more atmosphere and harrowing character moments than all-out vampire hunting action.


Genre fans will be glad to see that, much like the classic Francis Ford Coppola adaptation of Bram Stoker&#x27;s Dracula, Eggers&#x27; Nosferatu seems to blend elements of new and old filmmaking such as CGI and miniature work to come up with uniquely unsettling imagery.


But, having come out in 1922, it&#x27;s completely understandable that most are entering this ride out of love for Eggers&#x27; past work, not because they know a…</span>

                              <span>Apex Legends is set to host a new event dubbed Double Take, which will be introducing Quads to the battle royale game on June 25, 2024. Players will be now able to form 4-person squads in the Apex Games until the end of Season 21.


Developer Respawn Entertainment has said that the loot pool has been updated too, with more ammo, attachments, and health items spread over the map to bring down the chaos of fighting for resources. While Tridents will only carry three people, Valkyrie’s Ultimate ability will be able to carry four teammates at the same time.




Ranked Rumble


Apex Legends will also be introducing Ranked Rumble, a new game mode, at the end of the Ranked season. Kicking off on August 3, the Ranked Rumble will introduce leaderboards based on Rank Tier, for players to compete in and climb.


There will be 10 Ranked Rumble Matches that players can engage in, and finishing at the top of the leaderboard can earn you unique badges. All players who have earned a Rank this season are automatically eligible for Ranked Rumble, which will end on August 6, and the Ranked season ends with it.


While the season ends with Ranked Rumble, the placement on the leaderboard will not impact a player’s Ranked Points, Ranked Season placement or rewards which will be locked in once Ranked Rumble commences.


Collection event items


As is tradition, a new event brings with it new limited-time cosmetics for players to earn or purchase, as 24 new items will be available during the event. There will be Legendary skins for Octane, Crypto, Fuse, Conduit, Revenant, and Alter. Lifeline gets special treatment for this event, with a Prestige Skin and a new finisher for players to unlock after collecting all 24 items.

The update for Apex Legends goes live on June 25.

                              <span>In a Tweet on June 24, Palworld has shown off another upcoming feature from the Sakurajima update. While this update doesn’t look to be anything game-changing, it will definitely inject a little bit of fun and customization into your game. 


Pal skins are outfits and accessories that you’ll be able to use to dress up your Pals. Only one skin is shown in the Tweet, but it’s a very cute one:




There is no confirmation as of yet how these skins will be applied, or how new ones will be obtained. There’s also no further information about any other potential skins which could be coming in the Sakurajima update. However, Cattiva’s pixelated sunglasses are definitely going to be making their way onto the head of my little pink cat. 


I can’t wait to see what other skins will be included, either in the Sakurajima update or moving forwards. I only hope that skins don’t end up being monetized, but rather become obtainable through in-game means. It would be nice to get skins for certain Pals from the Pals themselves, rather than having to purchase them. 


Palworld has been releasing daily teasers leading up to the release of the Sakurajima update on June 27, with the names of the new faction leader and her pal being divulged in recent days. There have also now been four Paldeck videos showing off Pals that we’ve yet to meet, which probably amps up those Palworld players ready to catch some new Pals.

This time, the developer aims to deliver a three-dimensional ground map.


As discussed on the recent Microsoft Flight Simulator development update (which was aptly spotted by Jonathan Bolding over at PC Gamer), the developer Asobo Studio basically confirmed our suspicions from a while back: that the rendering of the world we fly over is bound to be the major focus of the new title. Given the ridiculous fidelity of the plane models and their flight models, it does make sense that Asobo would now want to up the ante in regard to the rest of the simulation.

                              <span>BitLife weekly challenges often ask you to be born in a specific country or region. While some have countries like Japan, Ireland, or Romania, most take place in the United States, with Arizona being one of many options during challenges like Love is Love. 


How to live in Arizona in BitLife


Being born in Arizona requires choosing the United States as your starting country and either Tucson or Phoenix as your starting place. Your best bet is to choose Phoenix, as this typically works for any challenge asking you to be born in Arizona. However, if it doesn&#x27;t for some reason, you have Tucson as a backup plan.


You can use similar strategies to be born in other US states in BitLife, too. For example, if a challenge asks to be born in Alaska, you&#x27;ll have to choose Anchorage as your starting place. Likewise, if you encounter Tennessee, California, or New Jersey, you&#x27;ll pick places like Nashville, Los Angeles, or Newark. BitLife uses real-world locations for these challenges, so a quick search on what cities are in a specific US state can help you knock out these objectives easily.


When you begin a new BitLife challenge, check your character&#x27;s starting gender or stats. Sometimes, you&#x27;ll have to begin as a male or female or have a certain percentage value in looks or smarts. Many challenges avoid these requirements altogether, but it&#x27;s good to watch for this, just in case. 


Another important part to check is a challenge&#x27;s other tasks. For example, having a criminal special talent will make things easier if it&#x27;s crime-centered. Similarly, if you have to become a famous musician, selecting a musical special talent helps you raise singing or instrument mastery faster. You&#x27;re usually not required to pick a talent for your character, but they&#x27;ll help you complete BitLife challenges quickly.

                              <span>As you make your way through Destiny 2&#x27;s Pale Heart, you&#x27;ll come across plenty of new items that you can use in different areas of the game. You&#x27;ll of course receive some of the Pale Heart weapons, including the very powerful Call sidearm, but other items you receive are a little more confusing. Here&#x27;s what to do with the Luminescent Seeds you acquire in Destiny 2.


Where to use Luminescent Seeds in Destiny 2

Luminescent Seeds are a new resource acquired from Overthrow activities, found in the three sections of the Pale Heart. Upon completing activities and increasing the Overthrow to Level 4, then defeating the boss, you&#x27;ll receive a Luminescent Seed. With this Luminescent Seed, you want to find a Witness hand somewhere within the Pale Heart. It&#x27;ll look like a black hand holding its palm out, similar to the image at the top of this page but without the blue flowers. Plant the Luminescent Seed there, and you&#x27;ll be able to return to the hand to gain the Traveler&#x27;s Blessing buff.

As for what buff you&#x27;ll receive, that will heavily depend on your drops. Completing certain encounters within the Pale Heart will grant you a Pale Blessings Destination Mod. These can be equipped by opening up the Destination Map using your ghost, then navigating to the Pathfinder icon near the top of the map and selecting the Traveler&#x27;s Blessings menu. By selecting one of the mods, you&#x27;ll activate that buff until the next weekly reset every Tuesday. 


Receiving these buffs requires interacting with a Witness hand that has those flowers, and will grant you 5 minutes of the buff. For example, I had the Pale Blessings mod active that increases grenade energy, and upon interacting with one of the hands, I got 5 minutes of increased grenade energy regen in the Pale Heart.

                              <span>Just about everything is going swell in the world of Helldivers 2 following the recent major content update, which resolved some of the game&#x27;s most pressing issues in one fell swoop. Some outstanding issues do yet exist, however, and Helldivers 2&#x27;s questionable performance is at the top of the list.


Notably, the community has long suspected that something is up with Helldivers 2&#x27;s performance not only on PC, but also the PlayStation 5, and this problem has come to a head with the aforementioned update&#x27;s admittedly delightful jungle biome. It would seem that the players&#x27; performance has been on a moderately steady decline from the day Helldivers 2 first came out, and I myself can vouch for this being the case from personal experience.

                              <span>The Chocopokkur mount in Final Fantasy XIV has previously only been available to Japanese or North American players through promotional events. Now, FFXIV is joining forces with Twitch and players worldwide will be able to obtain the little chocolate bulb.


Between July 2 and July 29, all you need to do in order to get this mount is watch any Twitch streamer who is streaming Final Fantasy XIV with the “Viewer Rewards” tag. Actively watching (playing in the background or tabbing out won’t count) for six hours will reward you with a code to get your Chocorpokkur mount. 




Even players on the free trial of FFXIV can take part and get the mount, and six hours is the maximum amount of time you’ll need to watch in order to get it. There are other items up for grabs for less time as well. 


Watching for one hour will reward an EXP Boost Meal Set, which includes 10 Buttery Mogbiscuits and 10 Fat Choco Chocos. These meals are particularly useful, boosting your EXP gain by 4%, rather than the usual 3% boost received from other meals. 


Watching for three hours will reward players with 10 Aetheryte Tickets, which are sure to come in handy while traversing the new world of Tural.

A word of warning, though - watching any Final Fantasy XIV stream during this time is likely to include heavy spoilers if you’re not sufficiently progressed through the story of Dawntrail. If that’s the case, you could always login to a stream before going to bed in an attempt to avoid any spoilers. 


Reward codes will be sent to your inbox on Twitch once you’ve watched enough accumulated hours. These codes can take up to 24 hours to arrive, so don’t worry if you don’t get the codes immediately. If your code fails to show up after 24 hours, you should contact Twitch support.

This is according to TrueTrophies, which sampled data from over 3.1 million active PSN accounts. While there are no exact figures, Sly Cooper saw 39.66% more active players the week of its PS Plus launch than Tomb Raider Legend (both games arrived on June 11). It also had 2.5% more players than what PS1 RPG The Legend of Dragoon, the former best-performing PS Plus Premium game, had duri…</span>

                              <span>After nearly ten years of captivating readers with its unique take on superheroes, Kohei Horikoshi&#x27;s My Hero Academia is officially coming to an end. The beloved manga, which has been a staple in Shonen Jump since its debut in 2014, will conclude its story in just five chapters. 


This announcement comes directly from the manga&#x27;s official X account. The final chapter is scheduled to be released in Weekly Shonen Jump&#x27;s combined 36th and 37th issues, which will come out on August 5.




The announcement also comes with a heartfelt letter from Horikoshi to his fans. As translated by Animehunch, his message is as follows. 



Sorry for the two-week break! My schedule got all piled up like a mille-feuille! There are just 5 chapters left until the end. Some might think, “There’s still 5 chapters left?!” while others might think, “Only 5 chapters left?!” but I’ll do my best to make sure both sides enjoy the last 5 chapters! Together with Deku and the others!


It was a bumpy road, but I was able to draw Deku and his friends for nearly 10 years thanks to everyone who kept reading. It was like a dream. Thank you so much! Well then! Let’s meet again in Jump!




My Hero Academia is currently on a two-week hiatus, with the next chapter set to return on July 1. Despite the hiatus, however, readers aren&#x27;t left with a heavy cliffhanger. The manga concluded its final arc a few weeks back and already started its epilogue. The remaining five chapters will likely continue showcasing the ugly aftermath of war and how the heroes adapt to it. 


Those who want to catch up on the series can read it through VIZ or Manga Plus.

                              <span>From Software games have garnered a reputation – alongside the rest of the Soulslike subgenre – for delivering difficult, punishing experiences that reward persistence with an unparalleled thrill of victory. The latest release, Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree, has attracted attention and, in some sectors of the fan base, controversy for how punishingly difficult it is. The week before the expansion&#x27;s release, we sat down with From Software president Hidetaka Miyazaki to talk about the notion of difficulty and how the passionate fan base has surprised him over the years.
The Soulslike genre, particularly From Software games, puts an emphasis on death as part of the gameplay experience. When you fight a challenging enemy, it may feel insurmountable, but by taking a studious and persistent …</span>

                              <span>Remakes tend to be more exciting than remasters because the improvements often go beyond mere bumps in resolution or framerate. At best, studios reimagine classic experiences in exciting new ways, sand away rough edges, and somehow retain the intangible x-factors that made fans fall in love with these titles in the first place. At the very least, remakes offer a great way to play antiquated or less accessible experiences on modern hardware. 
The remake boom has been in full swing in recent years to the point that it’s starting to get tough to keep track of all the projects in the works. Thankfully, we’ve gathered as many of the announced remakes (not remasters) that we could find and gathered them in one neat list, arranged chronologically by release window.

Faced with a potential takedown, the owners of the site swiftly removed all Warner Bros. content from the site. At the time of writing, it remains online.

The operation led to searches targeting 13 pirate IPTV administrators, and 1.3 million pirate viewers reportedly had their screens &quot;blacked out.&quot; The statement raises several important questions, but the decision to mention the &quot;completely innovative way&quot; the pirates obtained the content is not something usually discussed in public.

They’re all the rage lately, whether it’s a pure run-based game like Hades 2, a devilish combination with something like the settlement-management of Cult of the Lamb or the application of the genre’s live-die-live-again loop to add a new bit of spice to a familiar series like The Rogue Prince of Persia. Into that last category comes a new contender: Diablo 4, which will soon introduce a new wave-based roguelike mode in its next season.

So, naturally, FIFA is looking to help plug that gap in the meantime by hosting a virtual World Cup in car-football game Rocket League.

                              <span>Rewild &#x27;em up strategy sim Terra Nil has just received a free Vita Nova update, which introduces five new levels, nine buildings, a spinnable 3D world map, a new creature, the jaguar, and a more sophisticated wildlife system (that’ll be the “new life” in question, then). It endows the game’s hitherto rather decorative fauna with “deeper needs” and greater agency. Find a trailer peering through the reeds below this sentence like a jaguar slavering over an unsuspecting herd of boar. Yes, you’re the wild boar in this analogy. Run piggy, run!

                              <span>Open-world zombie adventure Days Gone might not technically feature any zombies, but at least the discourse around a potential sequel is constantly reanimating. Via Xitter, the original game’s creative director John Garvin has encouraged fans to &quot;never say never&quot; about a Days Gone 2, while reminding us that a full outline for the game had already been completed prior to his departure from developers Bend Studio in 2020.
Even with the caveat of &quot;I’m not holding my breath&quot;, Garvin’s take is an altogether more hopeful one that that of fellow Bend alumni and Days Gone game director Jeff Ross, who in May tweeXed a collage of popular PlayStation characters – sans his own post-apocalyptic motorcycling hero, Deacon St. John. &quot;A lot of people still ask me if there will ever be a Days Gone sequel, so I submit this poster as evidence it will never happen&quot;, Ross wrote, along with an apparent pop at Sony Interactive execs (including Hermen Hulst, co-CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment) for never being &quot;fans&quot; of the game.

My dreams are ablaze with scenes of sunlight percolating through shifting layers of beech and oak, with visions of dirt paths winding through bramble. Now, here comes Engraving to transform all those dreams into nightmares.

The truth is more appalling still: it&#x27;s just two guys in a lion suit. They aren&#x27;t even sewn together mouth to backside, like in the Human Centipede. Way to bait-and-switch, From!

                              <span>Despite an overwhelmingly strong reception with critics, Shadow Of The Erdtree is currently sitting at a ‘mixed’ review rating on Steam, with nay-sayers citing performance issues and overbearing enemy design. The Elden Ring DLC is currently metacritic’s highest rated expansion of all time at 95, beating out the The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt’s Blood And Wine’s 92. However, roughly a third of the 41,000 user reviews on Steam are negative.

Pro zranitelnost ale ani nemusí být TPM přítomen. Chyba byla objevena v Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon 7th Gen a X1 Yoga 4th Gen. Nicméně Phoenix později oznámil, že se chyba týká patrně všech jejich UEFI firmware s procesory Intel AlderLake, CoffeeLake, CometLake, IceLake, JasperLake, KabyLake, MeteorLake, RaptorLake, RocketLake a TigerLake. Zranitelné tedy jsou tedy stovky modelů od Lenovo, Dell, Acer a HP.</span>

                              <span>Sales are down 17% compared to last year.
GSD, via GamesIndustry.biz, has shared the latest sales data for the video game market across Europe in May 2024, and it looks to have been a quiet month. So quiet, in fact, that the entire top ten failed to sell as many copies as May 2023&#x27;s highly-anticipated The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.
Across physical and digital data from the major European markets (excluding Nintendo which doesn&#x27;t share digital figures), Game sales dropped 17% in May 2024, compared to the same period last year. That&#x27;s still 11.6 million game sales.

The latest UK charts are in, and would you believe it, EA Sports FC 24 is once again back on top as the Euro 2024 group stages get in full swing.
This means that Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree Edition will have to settle for the silver medal this week for its debut, with the likes of Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door, Super Mario Bros. Wonder, and Minecraft all settling into their usual positions in the top 10.

                              <span>Rumble bumbled.
The Super Monkey Ball franchise has experienced its fair share of peaks and troughs over the years. The first two GameCube titles knocked it out of the park, providing a plethora of content from the addictive maze-like main stages to the incredible minigames. Since then, however, the series has seemingly been unable to reach the same heights, either content to take one step forward and two steps back, or otherwise completely fumbling the (monkey) ball altogether.
After Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania instilled a smidgen of confidence with its commendable restoration of Super Monkey Ball 1 and 2, Sega is back with a brand-new entry in the form of Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble. However, in keeping with franchise tradition, it’s yet another game that just can’t quite hit the home run, combining a solid single-player experience with a bunch of multiplayer modes that, frankly, aren’t worth the price of admission or the time investment.

Pre-orders for Donkey Kong Country Returns HD and Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership have gone live via the Japanese eShop, confirming the estimated file sizes for each game.
Donkey Country Country Returns is coming in at 9.0GB, while Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership is slightly larger at 10.0GB. We&#x27;re admittedly slightly surprised at the size of the former since Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze was considerably smaller in size at 6.6GB.

Nintendo Direct information leaker &#x27;Pyoro&#x27;, who has been connected to multiple accurate Nintendo-related leaks over the last year, has apparently locked their Twitter account. This comes following the publication of a story by Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier where the leaker stated that their source works for Nintendo.
Following the story going live on Friday 21st June, Pyoro acted surprised to the information being shared publicly after speaking to Schreier in a direct message. Schreier responded to this in a post on social media saying he made the terms &quot;pretty clear&quot;.

                              <span>Sonic turned 33 this week.
Sega has been hosting a special broadcast titled &#x27;Sonic Central&#x27; around the time of the blue blur&#x27;s birthday since 2021, but this year the anniversary celebrations are a little different.
Sonic brand social media and community manager Katie Chrzanowski explained during a surprise live stream this week how a Sonic Central broadcast wouldn&#x27;t be happening this year in June. There&#x27;s no need to worry though, as Sega hasn&#x27;t forgotten about these events:

Soapbox features enable our individual writers and contributors to voice their opinions on hot topics and random stuff they&#x27;ve been chewing over. Today, Nathan considers the two-forks Zelda conundrum and wonders if another Nintendo series might take on the old-school Zelda mantle...

Perhaps the most surprising announcement in the June Nintendo Direct was for a brand-new, top-down Zelda title starring none other than Zelda herself. We may have predicted it, but we had no idea it would arrive so soon! Not that we’re complaining, mind you.

At Nintendo&#x27;s Indie World showcase in April, publisher and developer Super Evil Megacorp announced it would be releasing the roguelike action title Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Splintered Fate on the Switch in July. As we get closer to next month, it&#x27;s now been confirmed this former Apple Arcade exclusive will be launching on 17th July 2024.
As part of this announcement, a brand-new trailer has been shared on the official Nintendo YouTube channel. Pre-orders are also live on the eShop, with the game priced at $29.99 / £26.99 (or your regional equivalent). In case you missed our first story, Splintered Fate allows you take control of the four turtles, take down bosses, explore iconic locations, unlock temporary upgrades and permanent ones, and enjoy 4-player co-op where &quot;no two runs are the same&quot;.

Nintendo has shared some key details about the new top-down Zelda game (starring the Princess herself), but there&#x27;s still a lot of information that hasn&#x27;t been revealed just yet. Fortunately, one small detail we&#x27;ve now got is the game&#x27;s file size - revealing just how much space you&#x27;ll need on your Switch if you&#x27;re planning on picking up the eShop version.
According to official listings for The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, you&#x27;ll need around 6GB of free space. Grezzo&#x27;s 2019 Switch release The Legend of Zelda: Link&#x27;s Awakening requires close to the same amount of space. While the new top-down entry is reasonably sized by Switch standards, fortunately, it doesn&#x27;t match the latest open-world release Tears of the Kingdom.

Hello everyone, and welcome back to another edition of Box Art Brawl!
Before we get cracking with this week&#x27;s battle, let&#x27;s see how things panned out last time. We looked at Turok 2: Seeds of Evil for the N64 and golly gosh, was it a close one. It seemed many of you weren&#x27;t too keen on either design, but ultimately, it was the western variant that won the day with 51% of the vote.

Nintendo this week announced a brand new Mario &amp; Luigi RPG, officially titled Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership. Like a lot of the company&#x27;s new releases nowadays, it wasn&#x27;t ready to reveal the team behind this Switch project, but we&#x27;ve now got a small update on this.
Game File&#x27;s Stephen Totilo asked a Nintendo rep who the developer of Brothership is now that AlphaDream is out of action, and although they wouldn&#x27;t reveal this information, apparently &quot;some of the original developers who worked on the franchise are involved&quot;.

                              <span>Developer Mojang has revealed that a native version of Minecraft is finally coming to PlayStation 5. It&#x27;s currently in a testing phase, but if you own the PlayStation 4 version of the game for your PS5, you can take part in the preview right now. 
Though Minecraft has been playable on PS5 for years, it&#x27;s always been the PS4 version; this native version, however, is a new build of Minecraft made specifically for PS5, which means it will theoretically perform better on the console. 


&quot;Currently, however, the only way to play Minecraft on a PlayStation 5 is by purchasing the PlayStation 4 version of the game,&quot; the announcement reads. &quot;By developing a native version of Minecraft for PS5, we&#x27;ll be able to make the game run more effectively on the PS5&#x27;s hardware.&quot; 
Though Mojang hasn&#x27;t revealed how long the Minecraft PS5 version preview will last, all are welcome to take part in it, so long as they own the PS4 version of the game. To access it, go to &quot;Settings&quot; on your PS4 version of Minecraft while playing on a PS5 and select &quot;Preview.&quot; This preview includes the new Tricky Trials update, so you can venture into the trial chambers, meet a breeze, craft a mace, and more. 
Mojang asks that players who encounter bugs during this preview report it to the developer, and more generally, provide any feedback they might have. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer&#x27;s Minecraft review, and then check out this story about how actor Jack Black has all but confirmed he&#x27;s playing Steve in the upcoming live-action Minecraft movie. After that, read about Netflix&#x27;s animated Minecraft series.

When they showed you&#x27;d be running a noodle bar and fishing in the slums instead of flying a hovercar around, I went into full wishlisty mode. Nivalis (named for the cyberpunk city in question) was due to come to PC some time this year. But plans have changed. If, like me, you&#x27;re intrigued by the promise of a life under a neon canopy, you might have to wait. The release date has been pushed into next year.

                              <span>PVKK: Planetenverteidigungskanonenkommandant - yeah, let&#x27;s circle back to the title - is described in the first sentence of its Steam bio as a &quot;cozy&quot; game. I entertain suspicions of cozy or cosy games, inasmuch as they are increasingly framed as a kind of antidepressant in the face of a darkening world, but that&#x27;s OK, because the remaining 17 words in the sentence are: &quot;Operate your planetary defense cannon to fend off an interplanetary invasion from the comfort of your [cozy] bunker.&quot;

                              <span>Fear Effect, a horror action PS1 game from the year 2000 that I have incredibly fond memories of, is getting a Steam release next year, by Limited Run Games in collaboration with Square Enix. The news comes as part of the controversial (more on this in a bit) company’s digital LRG3 event. You can watch the full thing here, and the Fear Effect trailer below.

                              <span>Update: Whelp, spoke too soon. Apparently some Steam Deck players are seeing an &quot;Innapropriate activity detected&quot; message upon launching Elden Ring, blocking them from playing online. I haven&#x27;t had this myself, and some have reported the issue fixing itself after they installed the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC, but hopefully there&#x27;s a proper patch in the works.
Elden Ring on the Steam Deck has long enjoyed a smoothness that desktop play has lacked. Not so much in simple framerate terms – the handheld spends far more time around the 30fps mark than it does bumping into Elden Ring’s 60fps cap – but thanks to a Proton compatibility update back in 2022, it’s drastically less prone to the flow-breaking stutter that still plagues the RPG in 2024. That now goes for Shadow Of The Erdtree as well, judging from my portable time in the new expansion.

Soapbox features enable our individual writers and contributors to voice their opinions on hot topics and random stuff they&#x27;ve been chewing over. Today, Jim shines a light on an already dazzling Direct drop...

It took me a few hours to come down after the June Nintendo Direct. The showcase was stacked. In the moment, it felt like Nintendo was wheeling out its biggest guns, hitting us fanboys square in the face with just about every announcement we could have wished for.

The season of summer showcases has been and gone, and while there have been many fantastic new game announcements and updates, Hollow Knight: Silksong has been missing in action with not even a comment from developer Team Cherry in around two years. But there&#x27;s nothing to worry about, at least according to a playtester, as the game is &quot;not in dev hell&quot; (thanks, GamesRadar!).
Graig, who has previously been referred to as &quot;lead playtester&quot; on Silksong, emerged on Discord to share an update with fans on Silksong. In a short message on Discord, he states: &quot;Hi guys I literally know they are not in dev hell&quot;.

We didn&#x27;t expect to see Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics during the latest Nintendo Direct. Seeing the Marvel vs Capcom fighters on modern consoles felt like a pipe dream, and with Marvel vs. Capcom 2 — one of the greatest fighting games of all time — being part of the bundle, it&#x27;s a dream collection.
With the announcement earlier this week, and the launch of a site dedicated to all seven games in the collection, Capcom has uploaded some stunning high-definition character art for five of the seven games. Huge thanks to SeventhForce for highlighting this on Twitter.

Did you need reminding that there was an excellent Nintendo Direct earlier this week? No? Well, Nintendo is going to do it anyway.
As per usual, the Big N has shared a new infographic featuring every single game that featured during the Nintendo Direct June 2024 Showcase. We&#x27;re sure you all remember the big reveals, like Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, and Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership, but what about all those other games?

The arrival of Rareware&#x27;s classic Perfect Dark and Acclaim&#x27;s Turok: Dinosaur Hunter via the Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack was a very welcome announcement in the June 2024 Nintendo Direct. Both titles are the first entries in Nintendo&#x27;s new, separate N64 app with a &#x27;MATURE 17+&#x27; label.
Following on from the Japanese version which launched when GoldenEye came to the service back in 2023, this &#x27;adults-only&#x27; app will be a repository for any M-rated games with blood, language, or other naughtiness that the ESRB deems unsuitable for younger gamers.

Nintendo has filed a DMCA takedown against fan-made software &#x27;Heaven Studio&#x27;, a tool which enabled people to upload their own music and pair it with one of the rhythm-based minigames from the Rhythm Heaven series.
As reported by TorrentFreak (thanks, VGC), the Heaven Studio GitHub repository has been removed following Nintendo&#x27;s request, which cites copyright on the assets included with the software.

Summer Nights, the next seasonal event coming to Splatoon 3, was announced just under a month ago. And now Nintendo has revealed the details about the accompanying Splatfest.
As you&#x27;d expect from a summer-themed party, this Splatfest is asking fans to pick a place you&#x27;d reserve for a whole day. The options are a Palace, a Theme Park, or a Beach. Not the easiest decision, but we think we&#x27;d have to go for the Beach.

This review was originally published in March 2010. We&#x27;re updating and republishing it to mark the game&#x27;s arrival in the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack N64 library.

From its debut in 1997, developer Rare and the terrifying digital avatar of Pierce Brosnan ruled over the console shooter space with the Nintendo 64 tie-in of a then-two-year-old Bond movie, GoldenEye 007. Not only did it justify the genre on consoles while proving that movie games didn’t have to suck, it became one of the defining multiplayer experiences of its generation.

                              <span>Five men accused of operating one of the largest pirate IPTV services in the United States, have been convicted by a Las Vegas federal jury. Kristopher Dallmann, Douglas Courson, Felipe Garcia, Jared Jaurequi, and Peter Huber, generated millions of dollars in revenue through Jetflicks, a subscription service that reportedly offered more content than Netflix, Hulu, Vudu, and Amazon Prime. Four of the men face up to five years in prison; Dallmann&#x27;s maximum is 48 years.

A lower court previously held that the defendant had infringed the rights of major movie and TV companies, but due to limited evidence, only for a week. The court of appeal disagreed after his own use of the service was uncovered during a police raid.

To zjednoduší například vytváření cpumask, který nemusí být dynamický. Celkově pak je jádro s NR_CPUS&#x3D;4  asi jen o 46 kB menší.

                              <span>Dragon Age 4 was revealed years ago under the name Dragon Age: Dreadwolf. However, with seemingly months to go before the game’s fall 2024 launch, BioWare announced it was changing the name to Dragon Age: The Veilguard. Ahead of that announcement, Game Informer visited BioWare&#x27;s Edmonton office for an exclusive look at the game for our Dragon Age: The Veilguard cover story. It&#x27;s here we learned that the name had changed.
I interviewed various Veilguard leads for the cover story, and one of the first questions I asked each of them was, &quot;Why the name change?&quot; Here&#x27;s what each told me:

Avowed was featured as a major part of Xbox&#x27;s Summer presentations. The game appeared in the Xbox Game Showcase, and following the new footage, game director Carrie Patel appeared on the official Xbox podcast to share more gameplay and share more about the game. We caught up with Patel and gameplay director Gabe Paramo to find out even more about Avowed, covering what they think of comparisons to Skyrim, how they feel about Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3, why romance was considered for the game but ultimately not included, and why playing The Outer Worlds may gave you the best idea of what to expect from Avowed.

The trailer also reveals the Madden NFL 25 MVP Bundle, which includes EA Sports College Football 25, Madden NFL 25, and bonus rewards for both.

Earlier today, Ubisoft accidentally posted a trailer for Beyond Good &amp; Evil – 20th Anniversary Edition alongside news the game would be coming to all platforms next week. However, shortly after, it deleted the post. Now, Ubisoft has reposted the news, confirming Beyond Good &amp; Evil – 20th Anniversary Edition is, in fact, real and launching on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC on June 25.

                              <span>YouTuber Videogamedunkey, otherwise known as Dunkey, announced in 2022 that he started a game publishing company called Bigmode, and its first game, Animal Well, launched to critical acclaim last month. In a surprise announcement in a video Dunkey released yesterday, Bigmode revealed the next game it is publishing: Star of Providence. 
At the end of Dunkey&#x27;s E3 2024 video, he cuts to a new trailer for Star of Prodivence showcasing the pixel-art shoot-em-up with a retro soundtrack to match, and it looks awesome. The game was revealed last year, but this publishing announcement footage reveals it&#x27;s coming to Switch and PC (via Steam) in February. 
Check out the Star of Providence reveal in the video below: 


&quot;Descent into the facility and seek out power eternal in this tough as hell, shoot em up masterpiece,&quot; Bigmode&#x27;s website, which also describes the game as a bullet hell roguelike action game, reads. &quot;Engage in pulse-pounding battles with over 120 enemies in an ever-shifting gauntlet loaded with oncoming bullets and game-changing powerups. Only the most hardcore will survive.&quot; 
Star of Providence features more than 120 unique enemies, a vast array of weapons, upgrades, and modifiers, six playable ships (each with a different gameplay style), randomized level layouts, chaotic boss fights, and &quot;fish,&quot; whatever that means, according to the Bigmode website. 
Here are some additional Star of Providence screenshots: 

Star of Providence hits Switch and PC sometime in February of 2025.

It also allows you to summon your Spectral Steed during the game&#x27;s final fight (which, if you&#x27;ve beaten that boss, you know how helpful your mount would have been during it). 
The patch – V1.12 – is now live on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC (via Steam) and also features hundreds of other changes, like adjustments to weapons, skills, armaments, and general balance-related things.

                              <span>Earlier this week, Paradox Interactive announced it was canceling Life By You, a simulation game meant to rival Sims in development at Paradox Tectonic. With Rod Humble, a lead designer on The Sims 2 and The Sims 3, leading Tectonic, fans were hopeful about Life By You, which was set to launch into Early Access earlier this month before an indefinite delay.
That Early Access launch never happened as Life By You was subsequently canceled, and now, in the same week, Paradox Interactive has announced it is closing Tectonic, as reported by Game Developer. 
&quot;This is difficult and drastic news for our colleagues at Tectonic, who&#x27;ve worked hard on Life By You&#x27;s Early Access release,&quot; Paradox Interactive CEO Fredrik Wester writes in a press release. &quot;Sadly, with the cancelation of their sole proje…</span>

                              <span>Earlier this year, Sega announced Fearless: The Year of Shadow, a yearlong celebration of one of Sonic&#x27;s biggest rivals, adversaries, and frenemies, Shadow the Hedgehog. In the past, Sonic Team creative officer Takashi Iizuka told me Shadow is his favorite character in the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise outside of Sonic. It makes sense; after all, as the director of Sonic Adventure 2, where Shadow made his debut, Iizuka was instrumental in creating the dark hedgehog. 
&quot;Even now, if you ask me who my favorite character is, Shadow is going to pop up there,&quot; Iizuka says. &quot;Even when we think about the foundation of the entire franchise, Sonic and Shadow are really holding up so much of the franchise. They&#x27;re very popular and dynamic characters.&quot;

What exactly are the key architectural qualities of dwellings you might wish to go to bed with? Actually, don’t bother stretching your grey matter – you can just play Building Relationships, which is sort of A Short Hike but also, Love Island for anthropomorphic toy houses. There are demos on Itch and Steam. Be warned that you will be asked whether you’re a rooftop or a bottom floor.

                              <span>A phoenix is a mythological firebird that is periodically reborn from its own ashes, a symbol of cyclical renewal. It&#x27;s also, according to several former employees of Chorus developers Fishlabs in Hamburg, an internal title for the massive cost-cutting project begun by Swedish conglomerate Embracer Group in June 2023.
The current incarnation of a bewildering series of mergers, renamings and acquisitions that date back to the founding of Nordic Games in 2004, Embracer have spent much of the past decade buying up video game studios and licenses, from Deus Ex developers Eidos Montreal to the adaptation rights for The Lords Of The Rings. According to a February 2023 earnings report, by the end of December 2022 the conglomerate had 134 internal studios on the books (including table-top developers) and owned or controlled over 850 IPs, with 224 games in development. Our Graham warned of the perils of such consolidation in 2019, and his misgivings have been borne out. Following the reported collapse of a billion dollar Savvy Games investment deal, Embracer set out to recover their debts by cancelling projects, laying off staff and closing whole studios. Fishlabs - acquired by Embracer in 2018 alongside their parent company Koch Media, nowadays Plaion - were among those burned by &quot;Project Phoenix&quot;, first losing a dozen people in September 2023, and then around half their remaining workforce in November. In the process of these reductions, Embracer also binned off two video game projects – a sumptuous sci-fi metroidvania that was in full development, and a &quot;visual prototype&quot; for a brand new Red Faction game.

Ultrawide gaming monitors have clearly avoided non-starter status, given they’ve been around for years, seemingly being exchanged for currency – and yet they’re nowhere near what you might consider the &#x27;default&#x27; option when making a display upgrade. Regular widescreen monitors, with regular 16:9 aspect ratios, remain the go-to. So why switch?

                              <span>Chaos and comedy. Death and rebirth. Luck and, uh, running out of luck. A good roguelike doesn&#x27;t treat the player like other games do. Roguelikes won&#x27;t guide you helpfully along a path, or let you cinematically snatch victory from the jaws of defeat. They&#x27;re more likely to dangle you deep between the jaws of defeat and fumble the rope until you go sliding down defeat&#x27;s hungry gullet. This is their beauty, and it&#x27;s a part of why we keep coming back for another go. Next time everything will go right. Next time you&#x27;ll find the right pair of poison-proof loafers, the perfect co-pilot for your spaceship, a stash of stronger, better ropes. Next time.
Here&#x27;s our list of the 19 best roguelikes on PC you can play in 2024.

                              <span>We’re less than a day now from Shadow Of The Erdtree’s launch, and as promised, FromSoft have just released the latest patch (notes here) for the open world game. It’s only 6GB, and you’ll need it to play the expansion, so do click that button if you haven’t already. The updates headline features - new hairstyles, plus inventory and summoning QOL tweaks - were announced last week. However, it seems they buried the lede deeper than my disgust at the game’s Albinuaric murdering community: Torrent, the game’s spectral steed mount, is finally summonable in the fight against the final boss - just as the community have long speculated it was always intended to be.
Spoilers for the name of that boss below, if you’d rather not know.

                              <span>“The Republic Of Pirates was meant to be different…” laments the narration in the opening of the seafaring resource-chain-em-up strategy, out today with a demo on Steam at time of writing. This made me laugh, in the same way someone saying “the failure of Bastard City was deeply sobering” might. Yes, I know the pirate republic was a real thing, ended not by the infighting and treachery shown here, but by the British. I will avoid easy gags about Plundering Loisences and instead lightly recommend the demo to you. It’s got enough meat on its bones for a less brainwidth-hogging gulp of city building, assuming you like the pirate theme enough. Spy the trailer I’ve shoved in a dangling cage below, as a warning to others who might trespass around this RPS-pelago.

                              <span>The sinking terror that comes of having no fixed identity and being trapped alone thousands of metres beneath the ocean has been compacted into the soft, comforting (?) form of a plushie. Frictional Games, the creators of first-person horror game Soma, launched the soft toy depiction of the game&#x27;s protagonist Simon on Makeship, aka Kickstarter for plushies. Normally, we don&#x27;t report on merch - why would we? - but there is something deeply and darkly funny about making a fleece-coated fuzzy huggy wuggy about the psychologically harrowing experience of being forgotten under the sea. Then again, Frictional Games are not the first to do this sort of thing.

                              <span>Way back in 2004, that terrible year when I swore off video games entirely to focus on my university studies, developers 1C SeaWolf announced Captain Blood, a piratical action game loosely based on Rafael Sabatini&#x27;s adventure novels, in which a crew of 17th century freebooters set forth across the Spanish Main to rescue a magistrate&#x27;s daughter from assorted bilge-drinking scallywags. Early footage painted the portrait of a spirited 3D hack-and-slasher featuring much buckling of swashes, heaving of hos and jollying of rogers.
Jim Rossignol (RPS in peace) was cautiously enthused when he played Captain Blood in 2008. &quot;It was actually pretty fun - especially the arcade boat violence between speedy galleons - but I&#x27;m not exactly holding out for a masterpiece,&quot; he wrote. Alas, Captain Blood&#x27;s ship struck a reef in the shape of unspecified publishing disputes, and sank beneath the waves after one last defiant preview showing in 2010. Now, the game has risen from the depths Flying Dutchman-style thanks to new developers Seawolf Studio and General Arcade and publisher SNEG Ltd. It&#x27;ll finally launch on PC later this year.

You can find this &quot;first and last&quot; Elden Ring DLC expansion on Steam, the Xbox Store and in the suppurating depths of your very worst nightmares. Am I overdoing it yet? No matter.

                              <span>You might have noticed that the second most played game on Steam right now is Banana, which released back in April, but has seen an explosion of popularity over the past couple of weeks. What is Banana? It&#x27;s a free idle clicker in which you click on a picture of a banana to make numbers go up. If the number goes up enough, the game drops additional pictures of bananas into your Steam inventory. Actually, it&#x27;s not even an idle clicker - simply leaving the game open all day is enough to generate a slow but steady supply of these banana pictures.

Despite the setback, the tool&#x27;s developers are not giving up.

                              <span>UK police are reporting yet another pirate IPTV-related arrest. A warrant was executed at a flat in Nottingham where a 42-year-old was detained on suspicion of offenses related to the provision of pirated Sky broadcasts. For deterrent purposes, both the police and Sky want reports like this to reach the public, and that is being achieved. The response, however, is one of almost universal criticism, on grounds that in many cases have little or nothing to do with piracy.

                              <span>The release of Sonic Generations in 2011 gave players a series-wide greatest hits remake package to celebrate 20 years of Sonic the Hedgehog. Though other characters appeared in Sonic Generations, Sonic – in both his Classic and Modern forms – was the sole playable character. Now, 13 years later, the well-liked celebratory release returns as the latest Sonic remaster, but it&#x27;s not simply the same package with performance enhancements. Sure, those are there, but perhaps the biggest selling point is the inclusion of Shadow the Hedgehog as a playable character. 
But Shadow is much more than a reskin of Sonic. Yes, the base of Shadow in his Sonic Adventure 2 debut was that he could match Sonic&#x27;s abilities, but we&#x27;ve seen him appear in a variety of gameplay styles, with varying powers at his di…</span>

                              <span>Metal Slug Attack actually began as a mobile tower defense game for iOS and Android devices many years ago, but today, as part of Nintendo&#x27;s Summer Direct presentation, it was revealed the game is getting &quot;reloaded&quot; for just about every platform. Also, of note, this game is not to be confused with the other tactical Metal Slug game, Metal Slug Tactics. You can learn more about that game here.
Join Kyle Hilliard and Brian Shea for a look at some early gameplay from the game and learn why it is scratching their Plants vs. Zombies itch.

Still, even without a full sequel, Fallout is all around us - in multiple seasons of a television show, in Fortnite, and now in Call of Duty.

The otherwise fantastic cap to the near-decade-long Hydelyn-Zodiark was beset by a barrage of technical problems at launch, as the MMO’s servers buckled under the weight of record numbers of players, leading to hours-long queues to login that would often end in an error that then kicked you back into the queue. As someone that sat there for literal hours watching the numbers tick down, it wasn’t a great time - even if the wait was, ultimately, worth it.

                              <span>When it comes to the ultimate showdown of all-time great fighting games, Marvel vs Capcom 2 might well take my personal bet for being the best of the best. I spent countless hours throwing down with housemates, friends and random passers-by who looked like they were up for a brawl during my teenage years. Yet the arcade classic has - as far as I can tell - never been given a proper PC release before the recent announcement of a new bundle of the comic-book crossover series headed to Steam this year.

An age rating for the 1996 survival-horror classic was recently confirmed by European suitability judges PEGI, hinting at an impending (re-)release for the almost three-decade-old zombie game.

                              <span>What to compare Nine Sols’ flowing Sekiro-like 2D combat and layered metroidvania exploration to? The eternally sequel-less Hollow Knight? The punishing roguelite trappings of Dead Cells? 2D Souls-nuzzling Salt and Sacrifice? I wouldn’t know, because I’ve always had such trouble with slashing, blocking, and jumping in two dimensions that not only have I barely played any of the above, I’ve missed out a swathe of important platformers in the belief I just didn’t have it in me to manage them. But Nine Sols is so generous, so creative, so lucid and upfront in its ruleset, even as it crushes you with sometimes absurd difficulty, that playing it has opened up an entire library of classics I might have otherwise missed out on. I don’t have the experience to tell you what this game does better than others of its ilk, but I can tell how it made me feel. And for a game that murdered me with such relentless frequency, Nine Sols made me feel invincible.

We&#x27;ll never quite learn the truth of that claim, for Darrah has now rejoined BioWare to work as a consultant on the recently revealed Dragon Age: The Veilguard. He reckons it&#x27;s thriving. Specifically, he thinks this is the most enjoyable Dragon Age&#x27;s combat has ever been. Shhh, nobody tell the Inquisition.

There are shadows, technically, but they’re so mellow and fuzzy they might as well be stray pools of sunlight that have forgotten to glow. In this latest chunk of Lord Of The Rings memorabilia from developers Wētā Workshop and publisher Private Division, you are a custom-created hobbit who has just taken up residence in the charming Tellytubby town of Bywater, there to spend your days foraging, fishing, feasting and fraternizing with your fellow halfings, all of whom wear expressions of rosy-cheeked humour so intense in their winsome affability that your own face soon forms a merry rictus in response - like that terrible smile from Disco Elysium, but cosy. Oh god, no. Oh god, get it off me.

I bought my first laptop for uni, barely suitable for much except typing long literature essays in which I’d complete assignments using my favorite university trick of writing “ah, but to answer this question, we must first explore (whatever I actually wanted to write an essay about.)” Faltering, bricky turnip that it was, I still had some of my favourite gaming memories on that thing, mainly around aging RPGs: Baldur’s Gate 2, Planescape: Torment, and the old Fallouts.

                              <span>When I wrote our Still Wakes The Deep review I mentioned the true-to-life Scottish slang used by the oil rig workers of this North Sea horror. It was wonderful, but all these slang terms were being translated in the subtitles for some reason. &quot;Gobshite&quot; became &quot;bastard&quot;. The &quot;polis&quot; were localised as the &quot;police&quot;. And every &quot;yersel&quot; sneering out of the machismo-ridden workers became &quot;yourself&quot;. Well, turns out that&#x27;s the result of the game defaulting to &quot;International English&quot; for its captions. But if you want to immerse yourself in Scottish vernacular as deeply as protagonist Caz McCleary immerses himself in hazardous chemical spills, good news. There&#x27;s another option, says one of the game&#x27;s developers.

                              <span>Revealed at yesterday&#x27;s Nintendo Direct stream - but absolutely coming to PC because there&#x27;s a Steam page for it - The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy seems like a mash-up of visual novel and Fire Emblem-y RPG battles on grids. And it&#x27;s by the folks behind Danganronpa and Zero Escape, which means there will be lots of consequences and decisions that lead to copious amounts of despair, no matter how you finish the game apparently. If there&#x27;s one thing that really gets me going, it&#x27;s a game devoid of happiness and cheer.

                              <span>There is very little in this world that would get between me and playing an RPG made by Final Fantasy dad Hironobu Sakaguchi, double for one with a soundtrack composed by Nobuo Uematsu. Unless, of course, that game was exclusive to Apple Arcade, which Fantasian has been since its 2021 release. I will not speak poorly of Apple, for I already have several other cults out for my blood. Instead, I’ll simply celebrate the fact that, as per Tuesday’s Nintendo DIrect, the game that Sakaguchi developed “thinking it could be [his] final game before retiring” is coming to PC later this year, in ‘Neo Dimension’ form. Have a trailer.

                              <span>Japanese role-playing game enthusiasts are eating good this week, as Square Enix announce a 3D remake for 1993&#x27;s Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge Of The Seven. It&#x27;s a high fantasy RPG in which you must shore up an empire and defend it from generation to generation against a group of legendary adventurers, who were trapped in another dimension many moons ago and are positively livid that people don&#x27;t talk about their sacrifices enough. It&#x27;s out 24th October 2024, and springs from the turbulent brains of the team behind 2020&#x27;s Trials of Mana remake, which was well-received. I&#x27;ve got a trailer&#x27;s worth of rabble-rousing orchestral music and sparkly tag-team finishers below.

Plus, they are remaking 1 and 2 as well, for release sometime in 2025.

                              <span>If nothing else, Workers &amp; Resources Colon Soviet Republic will give anyone an appreciation of the incredible complexity and difficulty of building and maintaining a city. On another day I might call it the first ever city building game.
Even a Settlers or Factorio cannot match its extreme focus on logistical simulation. It isn&#x27;t realism for its own sake (look no further than the automated vehicles and the ludicrous citizen behaviour to refute that), but a fundamentally different interpretation of what city building means. It&#x27;s about co-ordinating all your pieces so they&#x27;ll be in the right place to support each other, and how the whole is all that matters, but that whole will fail if you don&#x27;t organise its parts. It is… a lot. It&#x27;s too much at times. But if you have those times, it will occupy them like nothing else.

                              <span>With Shadow Of The Erdtree about to launch this week, From Software president Hidetaka Miyazaki has been doing a round of interviews discussing next steps for the venerated action-RPG developer, or at least, hinting at them in the manner of a Dark Souls NPC suggesting that you might want to have a poke around New Anor Londo. In one such chat, Miyazaki strays perilously close to airing the &quot;themes or core elements&quot; of whatever game or games FromSoftware are working on post-Elden Ring, commenting that he has been inspired, albeit perhaps in a &quot;short-term way&quot;, by the experience of having a daughter.

                              <span>I&#x27;d been in Paris to see open world action-RPG Shadow Of The Erdtree early and when I got back, Edwin messaged me. He asked whether I thought it was big enough to consider the DLC a pseudo-sequel, and at the time I said something along the lines of, &quot;It&#x27;s hefty, but I think that&#x27;s probably pushing it&quot;.
I was wrong. The Land Of Shadow may not be as expansive as the base game&#x27;s Lands Between, but it&#x27;s knottier, denser, more of a twisting mass that burrows into the earth and soars into the skies. For this reason I think it produces some of Elden Ring&#x27;s finest moments, as exploration leads to a truer sense of discovery reminiscent of old Souls. But I also think its sheer density exposes more chinks in its open world format, where its interconnected sprawl leads to even greater recollection paralysis.

                              <span>Steam Next Fest 2024 has formally ended, we&#x27;ve spent a couple of weeks gorging upon demos of all stripes, from oil spill clean-up to dancefloor kendo, and now comes the all-important process of deciding which of those demos Won. Valve have helpfully shared a list of the most played Steam demos during this latest, gravest round of next festivity, and it covers a reasonable range. I mean, I wasn&#x27;t that surprised to see an open world survival shooter with monsters at the top of the ladder - why else would we dedicate a bunch of Best Of features to such things? - but I am surprised that number three is a leering parody of neglect. Also, there&#x27;s a game about mopping dungeons that appeals strongly to my Dungeon Meshi-watching sensibilities.

I normally wouldn’t let such an opaque stub of a description survive outside of a quick Trello reminder to write something better later, but I’m currently finding it fulfilling enough just to gaze upon that title and consider the fully formed art object that may soon emerge from its tantalising promises. Ok, so the visual component helps too. Orientate yourself by means of the trailer below, and let’s dig into this brazen nose-hooker of a head turner of a game that does exist, about another game that doesn’t.

You are 12 years old again, frightened and intrigued at the idea of graduating to teenhood, bathing in the cool glow of a cream-coloured CRT computer monitor. &quot;Habbo Hotel is back!&quot; is what I might shout if I did not know better, snapping you back to the present day in an act of psychological whiplash. The truth is the pixellated hangout zone of the early 2000s never went away. It has been alive this whole time. You forgot about the Hotel. But the Hotel did not forget about you.
Today, developers Sulake are doing something to jog your memory. They are calling it Habbo Hotel: Origins. I ask you to think carefully before you go there.

                              <span>Edwin backstory fragment #345: the greatest usage to which I have ever put my failing grasp of mathematics is determining how many different RPGs I could buy using the &quot;same&quot; money, by dint of trading them in promptly at Gamestation for carefully calculated diminishing returns. I&#x27;d save up to buy one of the premium headliners, attempt to get my money&#x27;s worth inside a week, then swap it for a respected double-A and perhaps a sub-£8 oddity with the manual missing - nesting one purchase within the other like a series of Matryoshka dolls.
This was my Big Short, my Moneyball. But it had a drawback: often, I was so eager to leapfrog to another game before the trade-in price changed that I skimmed RPGs that are now considered classics. The big one was Suikoden 2, which I spent only an evening with before gambling that I&#x27;d eke more FunValue out of a game with a less traditional battle system. I can&#x27;t remember what I traded that for, which says it all. Another was Baten Kaitos on Gamecube, which - yes, we are finally getting to the point here - has just been rereleased on Steam in the shape of a Baten Kaitos I &amp; II HD Remaster. I can&#x27;t remember what I traded Baten Kaitos for either, which again, says it all. Please, gentle reader - be better.

                              <span>Life By You, the Sims-like management game previously troubled by several delays, has been canceled by Paradox Interactive, and Californian studio Paradox Tectonic have been shut down. The news of the game’s cancellation came last night through a forum post, with Paradox deputy CEO Mattias Lilja painting a picture of a game still too “lacking” for more development time to fix. This morning, it emerged that Paradox Tectonic, the studio working on the game, have been shuttered, via GameWatcher.

                              <span>If you&#x27;re at all familiar with the Dragon Age series, you likely already know BioWare has experimented quite a lot with its gameplay. From Dragon Age: Origins&#x27; real-time strategy RPG approach to Dragon Age II&#x27;s mostly-set-within-one-city action experience to Dragon Age: Inquisition&#x27;s strategy-action mix, BioWare hasn&#x27;t quite defined the franchise&#x27;s combat. However, a through-line is apparent from Origins to Inquisition: BioWare seemingly wants this franchise to be action but has attempted to shift to that without abandoning its longtime fans. 
With Dragon Age: The Veilguard, BioWare has completed its transition from strategy to real-time action, but thanks to an optional tactical pause-and-play combat wheel that harkens back to the series&#x27; origins, I feel it&#x27;s found a great (battle)ground …</span>

                              <span>Bloodborne arrived on PS4 in 2015 and immediately became one of the best games of the year, earning a 9.75 out of 10 from Game Informer and even taking home our award for Best PlayStation Exclusive. But something about that game has stuck with players. In addition to resonating with a wider audience than many of From Software&#x27;s most iconic titles to that point, Bloodborne delivered an engrossing world full of mystery and challenge, causing it to remain top-of-mind for many Soulslike fans even today. In the lead-up to the launch of Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree, I sat down with the creator of Elden Ring, Dark Souls, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, Demon&#x27;s Souls, and Bloodborne to learn why the 2015 PS4 exclusive holds as special a place in his heart as it does the game&#x27;s many fans.

                              <span>Hot off the Boston Celtics&#x27; NBA Finals victory last night, we learned of a new way we can step onto the court this summer. Nintendo Switch Sports, the successor to the overwhelmingly popular Wii Sports series, arrived in 2022. While the initial offerings lacked depth and sometimes left us craving more than the base game was able to deliver, Nintendo has stuck with the title and has improved the offerings through free updates. A few months after launch, the title added golf at no additional charge, and during today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct, we learned that another free update is coming to the game this summer to add basketball to the mix.
Nintendo Switch Sports&#x27; implementation of basketball uses motion controls to dribble, pass, and shoot. You can participate in two-on-two matches locally, or compete in Five-Streak Battle matches and Three-Point Contests. You can also take part in a solo Three-Point Challenge, where you need to make as many baskets as you can before time expires.
Nintendo Switch Sports&#x27; basketball free update arrives this summer. For more on Nintendo Switch Sports, be sure to read our review of the base game here.</span>

                              <span>We recently learned about five Mega Man games arriving on Nintendo Switch Online&#x27;s Game Boy catalog, but Nintendo has recently focused an increasing amount of its catalog efforts on more obscure titles or those that never came to the West. With many of the most classic titles already on Nintendo Switch Online&#x27;s various catalogs, the output has decreased significantly. However, during today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct, four of the most requested games were announced for release today.
Metroid: Zero Mission, the excellent Game Boy Advance remake of the original Metroid, and The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past Four Swords, the Game Boy Advance remake of the classic SNES title but with a separate co-op campaign, come to Nintendo Switch Online&#x27;s Game Boy Advance catalog. On top of that, Nintendo announced the Nintendo 64 catalog is getting two M-rated entries: Perfect Dark, the GoldenEye 007 spiritual successor from developer Rare, and Turok: Dinosaur Hunter.
As a reminder, the NES, SNES, and Game Boy libraries are included in the base Nintendo Switch Online subscription, while Nintendo 64, Game Boy Advance, and Sega Genesis catalogs require you to upgrade to the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription. As such, to access all of the games announced and released today, you&#x27;ll need to subscribe to that premium membership. The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past Four Swords and Metroid: Zero Mission join the Game Boy Advance library today, while Perfect Dark and Turok: Dinosaur Hunter join the Nintendo 64 catalog today.</span>

                              <span>In recent years, Capcom has really shown its dedication to the Ace Attorney series by bringing the games to modern consoles. The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles brought two games to the West for the first time, while the Apollo Justice Ace Attorney Trilogy gave the newest games in the series a facelift. Today, with the announcement of Ace Attorney Investigations Collection, Capcom is not just bringing another Japan-only release to Western gamers, but it&#x27;s also made the entire library of Ace Attorney games available on modern consoles.


The Investigations games follow Miles Edgeworth, an antagonist turned reluctant ally from the original trilogy of Phoenix Wright games. Instead of defending suspects in court, Edgeworth is a prosecutor, so it&#x27;s up to him to build a case against the main suspects. By collecting evidence and completing logic puzzles, he and the lovable Detective Gumshoe solve mysteries and serve justice. While the first game launched in the States as a DS title, the second never officially made it over, so this is many players&#x27; first chance to see its story.
Like other Ace Attorney collections, the Ace Attorney Investigations Collection will have a number of modes and settings for fans to appreciate the art and music of the original game. While it includes new &quot;hand-drawn character visuals&quot; for a more modern look, it also allows players to switch to classic pixel sprites if they prefer the look of the original. Meanwhile, the gallery includes character art, a photo album, and music from the game, including orchestral arrangements.
While the announcement was made during the Nintendo Direct, Ace Attorney Investigations collection is far from a console exclusive – the two-game collection will launch on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on September 6.</span>

                              <span>In The Hundred Line you are Takumi Sumino, a student who is suddenly enrolled at the The Last Defense Academy when an outbreak of monsters threatens his life and the lives of his fellow students. Takumi is part of a group of students at the school who must defend it against monsters in grid-based strategy encounters for 100 days. The academy is apparently very secretive and you will lose classmates over the course of the game, which is not surprising considering this game is from the creators of the Danganronpa series. In the Danganronpa games, the mortality of nearly every character is always on the line.


The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy is coming to Nintendo Switch in 2025.</span>

                              <span>In addition to the critically acclaimed Street Fighter 6, which arrived last year, Capcom has been mining its fighting game history with various collections. While collections focusing on series like Street Fighter and Darkstalkers have proven popular, today&#x27;s announcement might be the most anticipated collection Capcom can put out, as it is bringing back seven of its beloved Marvel-focused games in one package.
Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics is a bundle headlined by the iconic Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes, but six other titles join the collection, dating back to 1994&#x27;s X-Men: Children of the Atom. The full collection includes X-Men: Children of the Atom, Marvel Super Heroes, Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes, Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes, Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter, X-Men vs. Street Fighter, and side-scrolling beat-&#x27;em-up The Punisher. 
Every fighting game in the collection features online play, including ranked, casual, and lobby matches with rollback netcode plus global high-score leaderboards, plus a training mode and spectator mode. The collection also includes a music jukebox, in-game museum, display filters, and more. 
Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics arrives physically and digitally on PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC later this year.</span>

                              <span>Nintendo has announced the latest installment of the Mario Party series. Super Mario Party Jamboree is a brand-new entry in the franchise, but it’s looking as if the general thrust of play remains mostly intact, with a few notable additions.
The reveal trailer shows Mario and friends descending on a small archipelago of islands that make up a massive resort. Across the many boards, players can encounter 110 different minigames.
Jamboree includes five new boards – Mega Wiggler’s Tree Party, King Bowser’s Keep, Roll ‘em Raceway, Goomba Lagoon, and Rainbow Galleria – plus returning boards from earlier games, including Mario’s Rainbow Castle (From Mario Party) and Western Land (from Mario Party 2). We got to see a bit of how the board games play out in a couple of these locales. Roll ‘em Raceway includes a turbo dice item that allows player Karts to zip forward up to 40 spaces with a good roll. In Goomba Lagoon, a changing tide adjusts the path across the board.
The most surprising addition is the new Koopathlon game mode, which allows up to 20 players to jump in together online. The early gameplay on offer here calls to mind other online party titles like Fall Guys.
Nintendo is touting Jamboree as the largest game in the series. We’ll see how true that is when the game launches for Switch on October 17.</span>

                              <span>For years, fans of the Legend of Zelda have clamored for the titular princess to star in her own game, but even as she&#x27;s become a more prominent character in recent entries, the Zelda-led Zelda game has yet to appear on store shelves. In today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct, that wish was finally granted; in The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, it&#x27;s up to Princess Zelda to save Hyrule when Link is captured.


While the game takes its art style from 2019&#x27;s Link&#x27;s Awakening remake, this title is not a remake of any kind, and there&#x27;s no clear indication that it is connected to Link&#x27;s Awakening. In this adventure, Zelda uses a new magic item called the Tri Rod to journey across Hyrule. The Tri Rod can create &quot;echoes&quot; of items, like tables, beds, or boxes, to climb and explore the overworld and its dungeo…</span>

                              <span>We finally have a look at Metroid Prime 4 outside of just a logo. The game is releasing in 2025 and is officially titled Metroid Prime 4: Beyond. The game has had its various tribulations since its announcement in 2017. It was originally being developed by Bandai Namco, but was later restarted and moved over to Retro Studios, the developer behind the the first three Metroid Prime games.


Finally seeing the game is action is exciting, but in a way, not surprising. The action is reminiscent of Retro&#x27;s other Metroid games (which is a good thing). We see Samus land on a planet clearly in the middle of a battle in a new ship, she moves around, scans elements of the environment, attacks monsters, and turns into a Morph Ball. We all see a tease of a new enemy who has a pair of Metroids floating over their shoulder.

The long-awaited Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake appeared during today&#x27;s highly anticipated Nintendo Direct. We learned much more about the upcoming game, including its release date, which falls in November. On top of that, during Summer Game Fest 2024, we spent about 45 minutes checking out the upcoming retro remake of one of the most beloved and important Dragon Quest games of all time.
In Dragon Quest III, which takes place years prior to the first two games in the series, you step into the shoes of the only child of Ortega, a great hero who fail…</span>

The new version looked great in its reveal trailer today, which showed off DK and his little buddy, Diddy Kong, making their way through a slew of jungle-themed environments, collecting bananas, popping barrels, and even riding Rambi the Rhinoceros.
The new remaster is set to include 80 levels, which means it will also have all the extra levels that appeared in the 2013 3DS port. The trailer also reveals plans for two-player local cooperative play.

                              <span>Disney Illusion Island was one of our favorite platformers from last year, thanks to its charming visuals, engaging combat-free design, and toe-tapping soundtrack. If you haven&#x27;t checked it out yet, today is a great day to do so, thanks to the free update that adds a brand-new chapter of gameplay.
Mystery In Monoth sees Mickey and friends lend a helping hand to Monoth&#x27;s greatest detective, the trench coat-clad Dash Dolphin. In addition to what appears to be new levels packed with platforming challenges, players will get to experience some mystery-solving as well by collecting clues and evidence and connecting them using a classic bulletin board with thumbtacks and red string.
You can return to the land of Monoth to snoop and sleuth when the Mystery In Monoth update drops later today.</span>

                              <span>During today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct, developer Mistwalker announced that its popular RPG Fantasian would be making the leap to Switch later this year in an enhanced version called Fantasian Neo Dimension. The title arrived as an Apple Arcade exclusive in 2021 and currently holds an 80 out of 100 on reviews aggregate site Metacritic. It also won the award for Mobile game of the Year at the 25th Annual DICE Awards. 
Mistwalker was founded in 2004 by Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi, who produced Fantasian. The studio frequently collaborates with longtime Final Fantasy composer Nobuo Uematsu, who also worked on Fantasian as the composer. To date, Mistwalker has released multiple critically acclaimed games, including Blue Dragon, Lost Odyssey, and The Last Story.
Fantasian uses similar turn-based design conventions as were found in many of the most classic Final Fantasy games. The title also implements several quality-of-life modernizations, such as the ability to skip random encounters with enemy types you&#x27;ve already defeated until they choose to fight them all at once. Despite being a mobile title, Fantasian&#x27;s ties to Apple Arcade means it does not include any microtransactions or paid DLC.
Fantasian Neo Dimension arrives on Nintendo Switch this holiday season.</span>

                              <span>Nintendo kicked off its June 2024 Nintendo Direct presentation with the surprise reveal of a new Mario &amp; Luigi game. This is the first new entry (there were some remakes a few years ago) in nine years. The game is subtitled Brothership and is apparently a &quot;seafaring adventure&quot; that will include new evolved &quot;Bros moves&quot;.


The game is coming to Nintendo Switch November 7. A big question mark that remains is who is the developer? The series was created by and developed by AlphaDream, but the studio closed down in 2019.</span>

Following up Elden Ring is a gargantuan task. It’s one of my favorite games of all time, and the base adventure isn’t lacking for content, intrigue, or surprises. Shadow of the Erdtree doesn’t outclass the primary campaign but expands it, adding a fun and fascinating new zone in the Realm of Shadow. With entertaining new dungeons, a challenging fresh slate of bosses, and a smart new form of progression, Shadow of the Erdtree gives Elden Ring fans more of everything that worked in the main game and is a fan…</span>

                              <span>Yars Rising is the successor of the 1982 Atari classic Yars&#x27; Revenge. However, on the surface, it has little to do with the original game created by Howard Scott Warshaw. After all, one is a 2D space shooter while another is a modernized sci-fi Metroidvania. However, with homages to Atari and gaming&#x27;s past galore, all developed by a renowned studio like WayForward, this release could be one to look forward to when it arrives on its newly announced September release date.
Taking control of a hacker named Emi (codename Yar), players must blast, hack, and sneak their way through various areas. As she progresses, she unlocks new powers that allow her to take out enemies more easily and, in true Metroidvania fashion, access new areas. Yars Rising is published by Atari and pays homage to the company&#x27;s past, including bosses and minigames that borrow gameplay elements from classic Atari titles.
Though the game is coming to a broader array of platforms, PlayStation 5 and Switch players can pick up physical editions of the game. We recently had a chance to go hands-on with Yars Rising and included our impressions in our list of the coolest things we saw at Summer Game Fest. To read that entry and see the rest of the list, head here. Yars Rising arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on September 10.</span>

                              <span>Developer Playground Games has announced its next wave of Forza Horizon 5 content will be focused on newer innovations in the realm of automobiles. This means that players will have the opportunity to drive around Mexico in a 2024 Ford Mustang Dark Horse, 2023 Hyundai IONIQ 5 N, 2021 Toyta GR Yaris, 2023 Porsche Taycan Cross Turismo Turbo S, and 2023 Kia EV6 GT. However, for many, those are unlikely to be the highlight of this batch of releases. Available tomorrow, Forza Horizon 5 is bringing several iconic vehicles from Universal Studios films and TV shows.
The Universal Icons Car Pack adds KITT from Knight Rider, Jurassic Park&#x27;s 1992 Jeep Wrangler Sahara, and a distinct version of the Delorean Time Machine from each Back to the Future film in the trilogy. Each Time Machine features a unique look and visual effects once you hit 88 miles per hour. The Jurassic Park Wrangler features the park&#x27;s logo as well as the iconic color scheme from the film. Finally, KITT includes a body kit that includes Super Pursuit Mode.
This isn&#x27;t the first time Forza Horizon 5 has introduced licensed vehicles from pop-culture properties. Players can already purchase the Forza Horizon 5: Fast X Car Pack as well as the Forza Horizon 5: Hot Wheels expansion. In addition to those aforementioned vehicles, this season adds 17 EventLab props to help players build modern highways and a robot collectible out in the world.
We absolutely loved Forza Horizon 5 when it came out in 2021, awarding it a 9.5 out of 10, naming it one of the top 10 games of 2021, and awarding it both Best Microsoft Exclusive and Best Racing Game for that year. The Universal Icons Car Pack will be available tomorrow, June 18. The Mustang arrives on June 20, the IONIQ and EV6 land in-game on June 27. The Yaris comes out on July 4 and the Taycan on July 11.</span>

For the whole of 2023, a total of 3,844 subscribers were labeled &#x27;grossly negligent&#x27; after receiving a third warning while 1,526 cases were sent to the public prosecutor. A relatively small number, just 234, received a financial penalty.

                              <span>Elden Ring fans are likely counting down the seconds until the release of its hotly anticipated Shadow of the Erdtree expansion this Friday. For those planning to dive into the experience the millisecond it becomes available, developer From Software has one request: no spoilers.
In an X post, the developer shared a short message kindly requesting players to be cool to each other and not go out of their way spoiling the expansion&#x27;s content online. The message reads:
Despite this reasonable request, if you&#x27;re worried about spoilers and don&#x27;t plan on shutting yourself inside on June 21 and ignoring the outside world until you complete Shadow of the Erdtree, you&#x27;ll probably want to mute any mentions of it on social media; just to be safe. 
But if you don&#x27;t care about getting a small taste of what Shadow of the Erdtree entails, you can check out our recent hands-on preview or watch us tour a slice of the game in this episode of New Gameplay Today.</span>

Monster Hunter is known for its protagonists overcoming seemingly insurmountable odds in their pursuit of taking down the massive monsters that populate the region, but with Monster Hunter Wilds, Capcom may be taking it to a whole new level. While at Summer Game Fest Play Days, I took in an extended gameplay demo involving an Alpha Monster hunt. I left the demo excited to dive into this seemingly improved take on what the very popular Monster Hunter World delivered in 2018.

                              <span>Embracer has shut down Pieces Interactive, the developer of the Alone in the Dark reimagining that arrived earlier this year. The studio is the latest to be closed by the troubled company over the last 10 months. 
Pieces Interactive’s website now only features a graphic listing “2007-2024 Thanks For Playing With Us” and a short blurb detailing its history: 
Alone in the Dark launched on March 20 to mixed reviews, currently sitting at a 63 on Metacritic. The game stars actors Jodie Comer and David Harbour, who lent their voices and likenesses, in a third-person reimagining of the 1992 survival horror classic. 


Following the collapse of a $2 billion deal with the Saudi Arabia-backed Savvy Games Group in 2023, Embracer has undergone a massive restructuring to stay afloat, resulting in a significant reduction of headcount across its many studios. That has included laying off over 1,000 employees (including those at Eidos-Montreal), selling off its studios (Saber Interactive, Gearbox Entertainment), and outright closing others (Free Radical Design, Volition Games). Embracer has most recently split itself into three separate companies, with its studios divided among them.</span>

                              <span>Nintendo has announced its previously confirmed summer Direct will air tomorrow, June 18. The roughly 40-minute presentation will focus on games slated for the second half of 2024.
The Direct begins at 7 a.m. PT/10 a.m. ET. Nintendo also reiterates that this presentation will not mention the Switch successor console.
Join us for a #NintendoDirect livestream focused on #NintendoSwitch games coming in the second half of 2024! There will be no mention of the Nintendo Switch successor during this presentation.

With the next Switch console slated to launch by March 2025, this is likely one of, if not the, last Direct focused entirely on the current Switch. The company&#x27;s fall calendar currently only has Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time as the only Switch-exclusive with a release date (October 10). Beyond third-party multi-platform releases, the back half of the year is pretty barren for Nintendo, so it&#x27;s likely this Direct will fill in those gaps. 
With Summer Game Fest and other big events behind us, this Nintendo Direct is one of the few major showcases remaining. You can keep up with all of the upcoming presentations in our 2024 Summer Gaming Showcase Schedule.</span>

                              <span>Fans of the A Quiet Place films may remember that a video game based on the franchise was announced almost three years ago. After years of worrying yet oddly appropriate silence, publisher Saber Interactive has revealed the title and first trailer for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead.
The first-person adventure is an original story starring a young woman who must trek across a new area of the film’s post-apocalyptic landscape for unknown reasons (though the game’s description mentions she’s dealing with some kind of family drama). Like the movies, keeping quiet to avoid the wrath of the sound-sensitive alien invaders requires using tools such as a customized microphone that measures the sound levels in an area. 


Stealth is key, and players must carefully observe environments to create their own paths while avoiding noise-making hazards such as stepping on broken glass, as seen in the video. The trailer didn’t show any combat, but if it’s anything like the films, guns are likely to be present but perhaps deemphasized (they&#x27;re quite loud, you see). 
Interestingly, A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead seems to have switched developers. When the game was first announced, Illogika was at the helm. Now, the game credits Stormind Games, the team behind the Remothered horror series and, most recently, Batora: Lost Haven. 
A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead was originally slated to launch in 2022, the same year A Quiet Place Part II hit theaters. With this trailer arriving ahead of the June 28 premiere of A Quiet Place: Day One, the game is again riding the momentum of a new film release. A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead is coming sometime this year for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</span>

Black Myth: Wukong is an action role-playing game that closely follows the events of Wu Cheng’en’s seminal novel Journey to the West. The work, based on Chinese mythology and Buddhist folklore, follows a monk who meets a spirit called Sun Wukong, often called Monkey King, during his search for sacred religious texts. While its central narrative is still unknown, Game Science’s upcoming Soulslike depicts Wukong’s encounters with Yaoguai, various creatures and demons in Chinese myth, set within stunning Eastern landscapes…</span>

                              <span>A Quiet Place is a very solid horror movie that seemed primed for a video game adaptation from the off. After all, it already had all the ingredients of a video game right there: the whole film is essentially one overlong stealth mission with a punishing fail state - any crunchy glass or other noise would immediately draw the attention of deadly alien monsters - and at one point there’s a whiteboard with the narrative equivalent of Dead Space’s “CUT OFF THEIR LIMBS” graffiti scrawled on it. Lo and behold, we’re getting a Quiet Place video game.

                              <span>Remember Lords of the Fallen? No, not that one. This one. Last year’s reboot of the 2014 game of exactly the same name - despite the successor originally being a numbered sequel, then at least having a ‘The’ at the start of its title to help tell them apart a little - will now get its own follow-up in a third Lords of the Fallen game. The upcoming sequel doesn’t have a name yet, but I really hope they stick with the bit and just call it “Lords of the Fallen” again.

                              <span>Fumes has starred in a few Screenshot Saturday round-ups but this is the first time, to my knowledge, that somebody from the Treehouse has slipped behind the wheel and taken this crusty old banger for a spin. I am glad to have done so. Created by a team of four, Fumes is the Mad Max X Vigilante 8 adaptation somebody really should have made in the 90s, when the very thought of such a thing would have had me flipping tables and then sheepishly righting them again, before being sent to bed with no dinner.
It&#x27;s an open world combat racer with boisterous arcade handling, pop-out guns that wiggle about like hood ornaments, some kaiju-wannabe boss vehicles, a delightfully crunchy, sooty artstyle and a passably earwormy metal soundtrack. I&#x27;m not entirely convinced it has longevity beyond its impeccably scorched and dented PS1 vibes, but I definitely think you should try the demo, now that the early access version is out.

The Swedish studio&#x27;s website is now a tombstone, bearing the dates 2007-2024. Oopsy-daisy!

                              <span>Scottish petrochemical horror is not exactly a genre, but maybe it ought to be. From the opening moments of Still Wakes The Deep you know life on its 1970s North Sea oil rig is precarious. Leaky ceilings, busted panelling, faulty drill machinery - the omens pile up as you spend your first thirty minutes wandering through the colleague-packed canteen and over the platform into the boss&#x27; office for a severe dressing-down. It&#x27;s a classic pre-disaster setup for a mostly traditional monster story, yet the game sticks expertly to the first-person horror form, and its voice actors&#x27; performances are so spot-on, that it&#x27;d feel churlish to judge this foaming fear simulator for sticking to type. It also has some markedly unsettling use of the shipping forecast, a famously dull feature of British radio I definitely did not expect to freak me out in a video game.

Shovel Knight, the retro platformer that started it all (it all being everything from a roguelike spin-off to a Dead Cells cameo) turns 10 this month, and Yacht Club Games are releasing a ultimate edition to celebrate. Entitled the ‘Shovel Of Hope DX’, this definitive-me-doo bundles in the original game with old and new features like saving and rewinding, over 20 playable characters, local and online co-op, and new modes. Grab your shovel and prepare to dig for the trailer, then look foolish as you realise it’s directly below this paragraph.

Here to put such kitchen wisdom to the test is BioWare&#x27;s Dragon Age: The Veilguard, which &quot;only&quot; allows you to bring two companions into the fray, one fewer than 2014&#x27;s Dragon Age: Inquisition. It&#x27;s another indication that this will be more biffy action game than thinky party-based RPG. The upside, assuming you find that last sentence disappointing, is that exploration and combat will be more &quot;intimate&quot;, and individual characters will have more screentime to bounce off each other and flourish as personalities. All this comes care of a BioWare Discord Q&amp;A from late last week, which you can watch in full below.

Galvanic Games, who released the sandbox survival game last year, said that ongoing sales of the game were not enough to keep the studio going, and they&#x27;d run out of time to find funding for a new project.

                              <span>You may notice there&#x27;s a stowaway this week. He crept in during all the recent kerfuffle, and secreted himself in a cosy little nook of the treehouse. He was quickly discovered, but despite patient attempts to explain that it&#x27;s  been several years since he was last here, and as per tradition he&#x27;s now dead to us, we&#x27;ve so far been unable to dislodge him. Like the smiley face hidden in the above image, he&#x27;s just... there. So I decided, hell, let&#x27;s hear what he&#x27;s playing this weekend as well.
Here&#x27;s what we&#x27;re all clicking on this weekend!

The amendments aim to &quot;liberalize and humanize&quot; Russian legislation in the area of copyright and related rights, by drastically increasing the threshold for infringement to be considered &#x27;large scale&#x27;.

                              <span>In a universe where bagels meet bars, the BAGEL engine has been perfectly toasted, and the ScummVM team is now ready to serve a slice of The Space Bar nostalgia. No, it’s not the key on your keyboard. Rather, it’s a detective story set on a distant planet. Important data has been stolen, and the perpetrator is a shape-shifter laying low in a spaceport dive bar until he can flee off-planet. You play a hard-boiled detective who has the skill to psychically visit bar patrons’ memories to gather clues and narrow down suspects.
This is thanks to the kind people at ZOOM Platform, who provided us with the original game sources to work with. Help us test the game by grabbing a daily build. Read through our testing guidelines. The game features a lot of options to chat around with bar patrons’ and do various actions in the different flashbacks. So we really need people to spend time experimenting and make sure everything works correctly. And please take some screenshots along the way.
If you don’t own The Space Bar, you can try one of the free demos or purchase it digitally from the ZOOM Platform. Testing is also available on Steam via a beta branch, check the Steam announcement for more details.
Now, good luck, and fingers crossed you can find the perp. Otherwise, your bureau chief will have you getting up close and personal with toilet duties for the rest of your career. Oh, and PS: The viewpoints of different aliens differ. For the Bartender, who has segmented eyes, even the original developers felt it was difficult and left in a cheat key of ScrollLock to switch back to a single viewpoint. Feel free to use it if, at any point, the flashback becomes too much for you :)

                              <span>Yacht Club Games hosted its own Direct-style presentation today, primarily to commemorate the 10th anniversary of Shovel Knight. As such, the event featured various Shovel Knight-related announcements, including the reveal of a brand-new game.
This new Shovel Knight game has no title and was not shown, but Yacht Club confirmed it’s in development. It also hinted that various clues about the nature of this title can be found in other Shovel Knight games, such as Shovel Knight Dig, Shovel Knight Pocket Dungeon, and Shovel Knight: Treasure Trove. 
The studio also states, “We&#x27;re committed to crafting an experience that not only honors the Shovel Knight legacy but also pioneers groundbreaking, innovative gameplay mechanics. This isn&#x27;t just another sequel - it&#x27;s a bold new adventure that will la…</span>

                              <span>After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora&#x27;s Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora&#x27;s Mask&#x27;s unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 1:00 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved.

                              <span>Developer Arc System Works has revealed Guilty Gear Strive: Dual Rulers, an anime adaptation based on its hit 2021 fighting game. Though there&#x27;s no release date or window in sight, Arc System Works says Sanzigen Studios is producing the anime. Notably, Sanzigen Studios is the same studio behind protagonist Sol Badguy&#x27;s &quot;Find Your Way&quot; music video in Guilty Gear Strive. 
As for what to expect from a plot perspective, Arc System Works has revealed little, though it says Dual Rulers will be at this year&#x27;s Anime Expo 2024 in July. 
&quot;Shigeru Morikawa (famous for Argonavis the Movie: Axia) will direct,&quot; the Dual Rulers announcement reads. &quot;Others attached to the project include Guilty Gear writer Norimitsu Kaihō for series composition and Seiji Mizushima (famous for Mobile Suit Gundam 00, Fullmetal Alchemist) as associate producer.&quot;

                              <span>Developer-publisher Dragami Games has revealed that Lollipop Chainsaw RePop, its remaster of the 2012 zombie action game, will launch September 25 on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC. Dragami revealed this release date in RePop&#x27;s first trailer, which shows off some of the remastered gameplay and the characters players will meet in the game.  Lollipop Chainsaw represents a collaboration between Goichi &quot;Suda51&quot; Suda (No More Heroes, Killer7), and Guardians of the Galaxy director and now DC film head James Gunn. At the time of Lollipop Chainsaw&#x27;s release, Gunn was known primarily for directing the films Slither and Super, and writing the two live-action Scooby Doo films and Zach Snyder&#x27;s Dawn of the Dead remake. We spoke with Suda51 recently about his career and whether or not he keeps up with James Gunn.
Alongside the trailer, Dragami has also released various details related to the remaster of Chainsaw Lollipop, including word that PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC players can enjoy the game with 4K resolution and 60 FPS (the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Switch versions support 1080p resolution and 30 FPS). Dragami says RePop has shorter load times, improved camera and keystroke response, increased attack speed, and faster movement speed, too. 
Plus, the Chainsaw Blaster now has &quot;auto rock on,&quot; an auto-fire mode, and an increased maximum ammunition count, while combos are now usable from the start of the game. Nick Roulette has received some changes, and so have minigames. Plus, a new auto-QTE feature is on by default now. 
Check all of it out for yourself in the Chainsaw Lollipop RePop gameplay trailer below: 


Lollipop Chainsaw RePop will be available on September 25 for the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC.

After 10 years of storytelling, the overarching saga that was introduced in the original launch of Destiny has finally concluded. With The Final Shape, Bungie ties a bow on the vast majority of its lingering plotlines and questions and sets the stage for a new direction in subsequent releases. Ahead of that, this concluding chapter is extremely satisfying, offering a rousing, heartfelt, and character-driven wrap-up that does right by what has come before. From narrative to gameplay, this is not the installment that welcom…</span>

When I first played Astro&#x27;s Playroom on the PlayStation 5, I was blown away by its gorgeous art style, engaging level design, and overwhelming charm. Each level was so carefully packed with easter eggs and fun platforming challenges that I assumed it was a positive side-effect of the game&#x27;s short playtime; the only way so much delight could be crammed into each stage was because the development team only had so many levels to work with, so a longer game would probably feel less impressive.

                              <span>There’ve been a ton of Jackbox Party Packs over the last near-decade, each following a fairly similar structure: one or two standout games you’ll want to replay, a couple you might dip into every now and then, and at least one you’ll try once and then never bother with again. With 10 different packs to pick from, it becomes an increasing fuss to remember which pack has which game in, and then boot it up just to play its highlight before repeating the process when you choose to play something else.

It’s one of those universally accepted unknowns, like how gravity works or the actual best pizza topping. (It’s glue, if you believe AI.)

It seems mad to think of Kanitsu-Gami: Path Of The Goddess this way, given that on some level, it is a tower defence game. Tower defence! The archetypal browser-based strategy experience and darling of emerging smartphones. The great-uncle once-removed of today&#x27;s idle clickers. Without meaning any disrespect to those currently working in the genre, which I&#x27;ve had a tonne of fun with, when&#x27;s the last time you were seriously excited by tower defence? As of this week, I am seriously excited by tower defence, because Path Of The Goddess has captured my imagination. It&#x27;s a stately, beautiful thing. I had a go at this year&#x27;s Keighleycon, and it&#x27;s one of two games at the show I wanted to carry on playing once my time was up. Thank goodness it&#x27;s out (on Steam and the Xbox store) in just a month or so&#x27;s time.

                              <span>Back in February, Graham wrote about potential redundancies at Disco Elysium studio ZA/UM following the cancellation of a standalone expansion to that game, codenamed X7. Now, PC Gamer’s Ted Litchfield has spoken to 12 current and former employees about the circumstances surrounding the cancellation, notably the details of the layoffs, the expansion, and the “humiliation campaign” suffered by writer Argo Tuulik  as apparent retaliation for his participation in last year’s extensive People Make Games documentary. You can, and should, read PC Gamer’s report here.

                              <span>The impenetrable wall of crossover fiction known as Kingdom Hearts has come to Steam. The games have been on Epic Games Store since 2021, so they&#x27;re not new to PC folk. But this does open them up to players who shy away from Epic&#x27;s storefront. I use the term &quot;open up&quot; loosely, because Kingdom Hearts is popularly regarded as a tangle of criss-crossing JRPG confuse-o-plots that require diagrams and multiple explainer videos to follow. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s true, having never followed Alice down this Buster Sword-shaped rabbit hole, but it is the popular joke.

While downtime is quite common for pirate sites, a mysterious statement by the team is open for interpretation, leading some to believe that it will not return anytime soon. Since the site is a prominent source of new movie and TV show releases, this is a big deal.

                              <span>The company behind notorious anti-tamper technology Denuvo, filed an interesting DMCA takedown notice at GitHub this week. According to Irdeto, unnamed parties cloned the company&#x27;s website, registered a similar domain, and ran their own mail server behind the scenes. A short investigation by TF suggests that the culprits may have known Irdeto would attempt to track them down and may have left Easter eggs along the way.

Instead, players can use a developer- and user-created asset library to build and &quot;remix&quot; game worlds, then publish them for other folks to play. 

Those creative tools will be available to some people next week, when the closed Builders Beta launches on June 18th.

                              <span>The latest Helldivers 2 patch is memorably titled 01.000.400, but for my money, it&#x27;s hovering on the  brink of being one of your gold-varnished &quot;X.0&quot; updates of note. It adds a fair few mechanics and makes various substantial adjustments to Arrowhead and Sony&#x27;s liberty-humping, cheerily xenocidal squad shooter.

                              <span>In the past I&#x27;ve described Phantom Blade Zero, the foetid and frantic new action-RPG from Chinese studio S-Game, as a Soulslike, and more specifically a Sekirolike. I must now hang my head and await the executioner&#x27;s ludicrously oversized hammer, for while Phantom Blade Zero&#x27;s ambience and layouts owe something to From&#x27;s work, the moment-to-moment has just as much in common with older hack-and-slash games such as Ninja Gaiden. I played a bit of it at Summer Game Fest this week, and while I’m not rushing out to preorder (I never am, in fairness), I think it could be a good ‘un.

                              <span>Ten years ago, we were drowning in early access survival games about chopping trees and crafting camp fires. Rust pit monstrous players against one another, DayZ had us dashing around for beans and bleach, while The Forest creeped us the hell out in a dark jungle. There was even a week-long celebration here at RPS called survival week to get the genre out of our systems. A lot of those games have since graduated to a full 1.0 release, but one survivalist shambled on. 7 Days To Die is a solid sandbox craft &#x27;em up with zombie hordes, and it never left the comfort of its early access log cabin surrounded by spikes and land mines. But a (tentative) release date is finally on the horizon, according to the developers. And it&#x27;s quite soon.

The demo in question was for Monster Hunter Wilds, which they probably should rename Monster Hadron Collider in that a major selling point appears to be making the megafauna converge and murder each other. It&#x27;s possible to do this in previous games, especially 2018&#x27;s Monster Hunter: World, but not like this. Not like this. Alas for the Alpha Doshaguma. Getting rocket-speared in the bum was only the start of its worst day ever.

                              <span>Phantom Line, the PVE co-op shooter formerly known as Hornet, has an early demo available until the 18th of June, 2024. It’s from Antistatic Studios, who include former Cyberpunk 2077, Bioshock, and Borderlands devs among their ranks. The FPS lets you and up to three great mates fill the ectoplasm-stained tactical boots worn by members of the ‘paranormal SWAT’, where you’ll explore large maps and try to contain strange goings on. You’ll need to join the game’s Discord if you want to play. Trailer below.

Were this a game from a triple-A publisher, I&#x27;d be heading down to their compound with some powerful magnets and cannisters of highly concentrated acid to wipe out their ungodly creation before it replaces the fundamental particles of our universe with waypoints. But Mental Salvo is actually the work of new indie imaginini (yes, no capital-I), and is a &quot;top down art adventure with light RPG elements&quot; that is perhaps a bit ZANY but also, refreshingly playful in essentially being about poking a big white screen to see what tumbles out of it.

As if the unholy swarm of trailers and game announcements from Summer Game Fest was not enough, this week the fearful megalords at Valve decided to drop their regular cavalcade of coming-soons onto their megastore. The beautiful (and terrifying) thing about Next Fest, of course, is the overwhelming number of demos that come out during the event. A small herd of video games are standing on my toes as we speak. But that&#x27;s okay, we are expert curators. Here&#x27;s a handy list of our nine favourite demos of the lot.

It’s fair to assume that you might’ve forgotten what happened during the last Dragon Age game, or some of the specific choices you made back in the misty ages of 2014.
