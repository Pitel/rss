                              <span>After lighting the Premier League on fire in his first season with Chelsea, EA FC 24 is introducing Cole Palmer&#x27;s signature &#x27;ice cold&#x27; celebration. 


EA posted a video on TikTok confirming that Cole Palmer&#x27;s celebration will be added to EA FC 24 on June 6.  If you thought opponents who did the griddy after scoring were annoying, wait until they rub their arms after scoring a 90th-minute winner. Palmer finished second in the Premier League Golden Boot race with 22 goals and contributed 11 assists in 2024. The breakout season earned the 22-year-old a spot on England&#x27;s provisional Euros squad, and he&#x27;s expected to play a significant role in the tournament. 


The celebration started after Palmer began his goal-scoring streak, earning the nickname Cold Palmer. From there the Chelsea player embraced the name and started rubbing his arms after goals as if he was cold. 




Unfortunately, EA did not share how to perform Cole Palmer&#x27;s signature dance, but once the secret is out, you will see this celebration everywhere. For players who don&#x27;t like Chelsea or Palmer, plenty of other celebrations are worth trying. Diogo Jota, Jude Bellingham, Erling Haaland, Cristiano Ronaldo, and Lionel Messi all have their signature celebrations as well.


Next up, players in the comment section also want EA FC 24 to add Swedish star Viktor Gyökeres&#x27; signature hands-over-the-mouth celebration.

The game will be launched in Steam early access, but you might be wondering whether it will continue to be a free MMO or use a paid subscription model like Final Fantasy XIV and World of Warcraft. 


Pax Dei will be in Steam early access for as long as developer Mainframe Industries needs to reach the goal of getting the game into a state where it feels it&#x27;s ready for a 1.0 launch. This could take a year, or it could take longer. While it&#x27;s in early access, the game can be purchased alongside a Founder&#x27;s Pack, but once it hits 1.0, the game won&#x27;t be in early access any longer, and that brings into question the subject of how the dev…</span>

How to deactivate Conduits in Destiny 2: The Final Shape Temptation mission


Upon reaching the blocked cave entryway, you&#x27;ll notice several waypoints scattered across the map. The key to progressing here is to position the Conduits correctly, aligning them with a light beam. However, the crucial step is to eliminate the Insight Psions. Their defeat grants you Psionic Insight temporarily, a vital resource that allows you to manipulate the Conduits, rotating them either clockwise or counterclockwise.

The Co-Worker is a game built in Roblox by a development team, just like the more popular releases you&#x27;ve heard of, such as Type Soul. In it, you can visit a complete virtual IKEA store, but you&#x27;re not there for shopping. Instead, the game is designed to get players into a virtual workplace where they&#x27;ll shift stock, serve customers, cook food, and do everything else that&#x27;s required in an IKEA store on a daily basis. While most players won&#x27;t be paid for this work, a limited number will be.

                              <span>Hypercharged: Unboxed, the viral Steam game that was released in 2020, has now made its way to Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One. Released on May 31, the game has already sold nearly 50,000 sales copies within 5 days of release on Xbox.


The first-person and third-person shooter with action figures from Digital Cybercherries thus continues its dream run on a new platform, after having already achieved over 3,000 positive reviews on Steam. Digital Cybercherries said they have now received over 600 reviews on Xbox platforms, averaging a rating of 4.6 stars out of 5 stars. It is fair to say that the game is enjoying a great start on Xbox as well.




Hypercharged: Unboxed offers a variety of gameplay modes, ranging from classic team deathmatch to King of the Hill, but also new twists to modes such as Capture the Battery where the battery can be thrown to friends to reach the destination quickly. The Infection mode throws waves of enemies at you and the aim is to survive as long as possible. 


Moreover, the game has a story campaign as well, which supports both online and local split-screen co-op with up to four players. The indie title, developed by a team of six developers, currently has two editions to offer on the Xbox Store.




The Standard Edition offers the base game for $29.99 whereas the Complete Edition is going for $39.99. Hypercharged: Unboxed Complete Edition includes the base game, the Breaker and Mightus playable action figures, and the supporter pack which comes with Classic Hypercharge, and Roadwarrior action figures, over five unique skins, and weapon materials.

Romulus&#x27; trailer doesn&#x27;t pull its punches. It assaults viewers with a marathon of terrifying scenes that prove that the seventh installment of the Alien franchise will return the series to its grungy, claustrophobic roots. After a brutally effective smash cut to the title card, the trailer ends by unveiling the film&#x27;s release date, August 16, 2024.

                              <span>You&#x27;ll solve puzzles in Wuthering Waves for many reasons, from opening a locked chest to completing various quests. One puzzle you&#x27;ll encounter at the lighthouse in Frosting Harbor asks you to look afar at the break of dawn to find something, but it doesn&#x27;t give additional context for what you&#x27;re looking for. Let&#x27;s find out what lies in wait for you at dawn.


How to solve the look afar at the break of dawn puzzle in Wuthering Waves


To solve the lighthouse&#x27;s &quot;look afar at the break of dawn&quot; puzzle, set your in-game clock to 06:00 before traveling down the hill to the nearby harbor. Here, you&#x27;ll spot a golden glow on the ground, which you can investigate to reveal a standard supply chest containing Astrite, medium energy core, and other rewards.

The first part of this puzzle after hacking the lighthouse control panel is to switch your in-game time to 06:00. You can do this by heading into your main menu, selecting the clock icon at the bottom of your screen, and scrolling through the time shards until you see 06:00. Choose this time and confirm your selection to skip through the day, allowing you to see the world at the break of dawn.

Once you set your time to six in the morning, look away from the lighthouse and toward Frosting Harbor. You&#x27;ll spot a glowing light on the ground near the stone barriers, which you can investigate to reveal a treasure chest. Open it to find your rewards, knocking out the lighthouse&#x27;s look afar at the break of dawn puzzle.

                              <span>Elder Scrolls Online has a great deal of customization options among its classes, so it can be overwhelming. It uses a dual bar system where you can quickly swap between weapons and skillsets at the press of a button. But that’s just more complications. Thankfully you can create builds that just use one bar, like this one bar PvE Magicka Sorcerer Build.


There isn’t really one single “one bar” build. Finding out the best one that works for you is often a matter of experimentation. So, try this, but if it doesn’t work for you, change what doesn’t work. However, you will definitely be able to get a capable defense/attack from this build.

                              <span>If you&#x27;re taking on Fortnite&#x27;s Season 3 Weekly Quests, then you&#x27;ll know that the second set tasks you with healing in an Oasis Pool. If you don&#x27;t know where to find one, then never fear, as I&#x27;m here to help you with a map showing their locations.


While it&#x27;s not the toughest challenge in Season 3&#x27;s Week Two Quests—that honor goes to driving the Mythic Nitro Cars—this still isn&#x27;t super straightforward, especially if you don&#x27;t know where the Oasis Pools are. Jumping in any old water you see isn&#x27;t going to cut it, so you need to be certain that you know where you&#x27;re going. 


Every Oasis Pool on the Fortnite map


There are five Oasis Pools in Fortnite, all found in the wasteland biome in the south of the map. 


They&#x27;re all in the bottom half of the island. Image via Epic Games, Remix via Destructoid


You&#x27;ll know that you&#x27;ve found an Oasis Pool as the water is a much brighter blue than normal rivers and lakes, letting you know that it&#x27;s got special healing properties. 


What do Oasis Pools do?


Oasis Pools will heal you when you&#x27;ve taken damage and will fill your health bar all the way up, which is very useful. If you&#x27;re already at full health, they will then start boosting your Shields too, giving you extra protection against enemies. 


As an added bonus, there is usually ground loot and Chests around Oasis Pools too, which makes them an attractive place to land early-game, or a good option to rotate to later in the game. It&#x27;s not the first time that an Oasis Pool has saved me after a gunfight against a sharp opponent, so keep them in mind even when you complete the Week Two challenge.

While signing young players always offers plenty of benefits, scouting world-class talents can elevate your squad to the next level.

Sethos’ best weapons in Genshin Impact


Hunter’s Path: best 5-star weapon for Sethos


Sethos’ best weapon is the 5-star Hunter’s Path. Despite being Tighnari’s signature Bow, Hunter’s Path has a great passive for Sethos, increasing his Charged Attack damage based on his Elemental Mastery. If you happen to have Hunter’s Path in your inventory, Sethos makes for a great user. I wouldn’t recommend pulling Hunter’s Path specifically for Sethos, though.

                              <span>Stringmaster is a five-star Rectifier weapon in Wuthering Waves that pairs well with powerful characters like Yinlin. However, obtaining it requires participating in a limited-time event, so be prepared to rely on some luck. Here&#x27;s how to get Stringmaster in Wuthering Waves.


How to get Stringmaster five-star Rectifier weapon in Wuthering Waves


You can obtain Stringmaster by participating in the Absolute Pulsation Weapon Convene event from June 6, 2024, until June 26. From June 6 onward, the version of Absolute pulsation that features Verdant Summit will end, leading directly into Stringmaster&#x27;s variation. 


The Absolute Pulsation Weapon banner event is the only way to get the weapon. Fortunately, pulling a five-star weapon guarantees you&#x27;ll get Stringmaster, so you won&#x27;t accidentally …</span>

Following a series of prior fixes, the Colossal Order has now outlined the upcoming Economy 2.0 rework, and it&#x27;s a hoot.


Or, at least, it should be a hoot if it all pans out properly. As per Colossal Order&#x27;s latest developer blog, the Economy 2.0 system rework is supposed to be a complete and comprehensive rebalance of how the game handles its monetary progression. 


&quot;Our goal with Economy 2.0 was to make the systems more straightforward and responsive, so you can make more meaningful choices and have more control over the various gameplay aspects,&quot; read the Colossal Order blog. &quot;This means fewer safeguards and automated systems that work invisibly unde…</span>

                              <span>Almost every mission in Helldivers 2 is fun as long as you&#x27;re with a squad that plays the objective and doesn&#x27;t actively try to kill you. However, that fun can dissipate quickly when it comes to extraction, the simplest part of any mission that often causes the most issues. 


Extraction from a mission in Helldivers 2 shouldn&#x27;t be difficult, but it is more often than not. You might end up missing the Pelican by one second because you were halfway across the map when the timer started, another player could accidentally kill you with a Stratagem, or you might run out of ammo while defending the extraction point. Thankfully, one player has put together an instruction video on extraction etiquette that should make all of these pain points a thing of the past.

                              <span>This year&#x27;s major international tournament is right around the corner, and that means a massive new patch is on the way for EA FC 24. Here&#x27;s when you can get your hands on the Euro 2024 update. 


If you&#x27;re a long-time FIFA fan, you&#x27;ll remember the incredible World Cup and Euros modes that EA used to drop. Back in the day, they were essentially an additional Ultimate Team, allowing you to build a squad of the best players at the competition. 


EA Sports has been unusually quiet about what the Euro 2024 patch will include, but we finally know when we&#x27;ll be able to jump into the game and play it.

EA FC 24 Euro 2024 update release date


EA Sports FC 24&#x27;s Euro 2024 update will be released on Thursday, June 6, 2024. This was confirmed by EA Sports themselves on June 4, telling players to &quot;get ready for a festival of football.&quot;




EA FC 24 Euro 2024 update countdown


Unfortunately, EA Sports hasn&#x27;t given us an exact time of when the update will go live in-game. Most content updates, such as Team of the Week, go live at 6 pm UK time, so we&#x27;ve set the countdown timer below to that time. We&#x27;ll be sure to update it if we get any new information. 



What&#x27;s included in EA FC 24&#x27;s Euro 2024 update?


Truthfully, we don&#x27;t know. EA Sports have been pretty secretive and not announced anything to do with the promo. We expect that it will be linked to Ultimate Team, and likely feature new cards based on players competing in the tournament. 


The promo image shows Euro 2024 players including Jude Bellingham and Virgil Van Dijk standing in their new kits for the tournament, so we expect those to be updated too. 


It&#x27;s also possible we&#x27;ll see updates to the tournament mode offline too, perhaps with the official graphics package that will be used in this year&#x27;s edition of the European Championship.

                              <span>New weapons always dominate the Modern Warfare 3 meta at launch, but players have already had enough of Season 4&#x27;s Kar98k sniper rifle, and are begging Sledgehammer to nerf it. 


Season 4 has already seen CoD fans complain about Sledgehammer making old guns useless, but the other side of that coin is that when they drop a new weapon, it&#x27;s often so powerful that it becomes the game&#x27;s most picked gun and is far too powerful. 


That&#x27;s the opinion that many have of the Kar98k right now, with riversub calling the weapon &quot;a menace&quot; and &quot;the definition of overpowered&quot; on Reddit. 


A welcome return. Image via Activision


&quot;Yep, one-tap weapons should be high risk, high reward, but nearly all of them in this game aren&#x27;t,&quot; agreed Grand-Article4214. &quot;There are barely any risks for snipers, especially since they aren&#x27;t balanced to 150 health compared to every other gun in the game.&quot;


Icy-Computer7556 explained that they feel the gun has &quot;ridiculous aim assist,&quot; stating: &quot;Anything with one-shot potential close or far should instantly be aim assist free. They did that in previous CoDs and it worked well. Skilled players kept sniping and sh*tters gave up because they realized they didn&#x27;t have the skill to just bloop everyone every second. I&#x27;m not saying I&#x27;m a good sniper, but the fact that it can slow down or pull on a gun like that? It&#x27;s f**king crazy.&quot;


For some though, the idea of nerfing the Kar98k is pointless because something else will take its place, with conanwongmkii writing: &quot;It&#x27;s either the Kar98k, the Wardens, or the MORS sniper. Pick your poison, you can&#x27;t escape it.&quot;


Personally, I find the Kar98k to be unbelievable in other people&#x27;s hands, but in mine it feels like I get nothing but hitmarkers. I&#x27;ve never been a great sniper though, so it may be my fault. Still, getting one-shot killed over and over again by people running the Kar98k is infuriating, and I&#x27;d love to see some balancing changes too.

                              <span>EA Sports has announced an EA FC 24 maintenance, which will take place on June 5.


This maintenance comes at a time when the Ultimate TOTS promo is still active in the Ultimate Team mode. However, EA Sports has some big plans for the upcoming weeks, and this server update might be in preparation for that. Among other possible content going live in the future, a separate Euro 2024 tournament is also expected by the fans. But before that, the community will have to bear with the upcoming update.


When will the EA FC 24 maintenance (June 5) begin?


EA Sports has officially announced details of the upcoming maintenance on the game&#x27;s official X account. According to that post, the servers will be taken down at 8 a.m. UTC/1 a.m. PDT/4 a.m. ET, and matchmaking across all game modes will be stopped 30 minutes prior to that.


This maintenance will apply to the game across all platforms. However, only EA FC 24 will be impacted by this update, so those of you still playing older releases like FIFA 23 can continue to play without any worry.




When will the EA FC 24 maintenance (June 5) end?


The servers will be restored once the maintenance is concluded. As per the available schedule, June 5&#x27;s maintenance will end at 2 p.m. UTC/7 a.m.PDT/10 a.m. ET. If there are no more delays, the servers will be down for approximately six hours. This is certainly one of the longer server maintenance periods in recent times.


While the maintenance is live, players won&#x27;t be able to access game modes like Ultimate Team, which rely on online matchmaking. Career Mode will remain a playable option, as there&#x27;s no need for the internet to conduct matches.

                              <span>Clorinde is a 5-star Electro DPS character in Genshin Impact, and the second character ever to incorporate Bond of Life mechanics in their kit. Here’s a breakdown of Clorinde’s unique kit and how to play her.


What is Bond of Life?


First, a quick explanation of Bond of Life. Bond of Life is a debuff that restricts the healing that a character can receive by a flat amount. The amount of Bond of Life that you have is represented by a red bar surrounding the affected character’s health bar. If that character receives healing while a Bond of Life is present, the Bond of Life will absorb that healing instead of allowing your character’s HP to be restored. 


Bond of Life can be cleared by receiving enough healing. Once Bond of Life is no longer present, you can heal your character like norma…</span>

                              <span>Clorinde is a 5-star Electro DPS character in Genshin Impact with unique Bond of Life mechanics. Once you’ve learned how to play Clorinde, here are the best weapons and artifacts to maximize her damage.


Clorinde’s best weapons in Genshin Impact


Absolution


Absolution is Clorinde’s best weapon. As her signature 5-star Sword, its passive is tailor-made for her Bond of Life mechanics, and Clorinde should have no trouble keeping uptime on its buff. Still, the difference in damage between Absolution and the other 5-stars below is not wide enough to justify gambling on the weapon banner.

Light of Foliar Incision / Haran Geppaku Futsu


Light of Foliar Incision and Haran Heppaku Futsu are good 5-star options if you don’t have Absolution. Their damage comes fairly clos…</span>

Sony’s shiniest virtual reality offering is now confirmed to be adding official PC support via a nifty wired adapter at the start of August. It’ll cost £50/$60 - but whether it’s worth the price given a number of key features will be missing is another question entirely...

That coldness seems to have seeped into the company itself too, as they racked up their career-killing bodycount with nearly 100 more layoffs this week.

A brighter, stagier variety of action-role-playing, which deepens the connection between Italian folklore and Soulsliking established by last year&#x27;s Lies Of P. Well then: cast aside those ursine mitts, slip on a pair of immaculate white theatre gloves and get your thumbs into Enotria: The Last Song, which has a demo on Steam.

Aside from being a dry reflection of tabloid reporting on women who commit crimes (bad woman! sexy, bad woman!) this is also the kind of incidental character-building you can expect in this perky, retro-styled survival horror. It plays like Silent Hill charged with the hot pink body horror of Porpentine interactive fiction. And judging by my hour of unsettled strolling through the decrepit tube station of the game&#x27;s demo, it&#x27;s a powerful combo.

                              <span>Silkbulb Test is a game in which, going by its demo, you are strapped to a chair and made to answer questions projected onto a screen. You answer the questions by looking ponderously down and pressing the big red and yellow buttons on the desk in front of you. The questions begin with relatively innocuous, CAPTCHA-style inquiries, such as &quot;is this a door?&quot; accompanied by a picture of a face. A few minutes later, there&#x27;s stuff like &quot;Are you alone?&quot; and &quot;Is it safe to be alone?&quot; and &quot;You are alone&quot; and yep, time to smash Pause or better, throw the Steam Deck behind the sofa and go stare out the window for a while.

                              <span>Roguelike FPS Wild Bastards is the space western follow up to 2019’s Void Bastards. It takes some of that game’s ideas, mainly those related to shooty and looty, and reforms them into a largely different can o’ campfire beans. This time, it’s less focused on exploration, more on individual, tense shoot-outs. You collect a cast of weirdos, each with different guns and abilities, and form the deadliest dang posse this side of the last tactical overworld map you descision&#x27;d your way through. I like what I&#x27;ve played so far, although I think a lot is going to hinge on how much evolution the mid-game offers. As always, here’s a Steam demo, if you want to be all contrary and &#x27;form your own opinions&#x27;. Pah.

                              <span>Witchy roguelike Hades 2 got a fresh update yesterday that sees a bunch of weapons getting stompier, thumpier, and, yes, whompier. It&#x27;s like the hammer of Hephaestus himself was put to work on the entire armory. The Moonstone Axe&#x27;s heavier attacks now channel faster, for one thing, which could make the most sluggish of the weapons a little more viable. I haven&#x27;t had a go at the re-jigged bashing yet myself but I trust from these patch notes it will be subtly noticeable.

My pal Liam suggested we play this evening because Bungie&#x27;s servers would inevitably go up in flames the moment it launched. And what do you know? The right decision was made. Are we smug about it? Yes. Anyway, the good news is that Bungie have put out a few of those fires, though there are still a few bugs to fix.

                              <span>Call me a Paranoid Android or a Suspicious Stanley, but when I ask a videogame developer a question and the videogame developer pauses for exactly 31 seconds and then says “no”, I tend to assume the answer is, in fact, “yes”. Or at least “it’s complicated”, to channel a bit of antique Facebook coyness. The Alters is a complicated game. It is a moody sci-fi extravaganza in which your character, beleaguered offworld miner Jan Dolski, has to create new versions of himself by branching off his own past timeline using a &quot;quantum computer&quot;, splitting the chain of events at trigger points by, say, having his younger self stand up to his domineering father rather than leaving home.

We are quickly approaching the release of Luigi&#x27;s Mansion 2 HD on 27th June and, with the marketing campaign in full swing, Nintendo Japan has uploaded a trio of terrifying trailers to show us a little more of the high-definition chills and thrills.
The three short trailers all start with the same spooked Luigi animation — don&#x27;t worry, you&#x27;re not watching the same one three times over — but there are snippets of new footage thrown in there too, showcasing some ghost encounters, spinning toilets and a pesky mammoth that you might remember from the OG 3DS version.

Sega has announced that the upcoming Switch exclusive Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble will receive a special guest appearance from Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, and Amy from the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise via the &#x27;Sega Pass&#x27; DLC.
The DLC is included with the Digital Deluxe Edition of the game at £59.99, or you can purchase it separately at £22.29 (which, if we&#x27;re being completely honest, feels a tad expensive for what you&#x27;re getting).

                              <span>Drop it like it&#x27;s Hoth.
You would be forgiven for having a bad feeling about Star Wars: Hunters. This free-to-play, class-based, hero shooter was announced by FarmVille developer Zynga in 2021, but a duo of delays and its appearance in the already stacked genre of &#x27;Overwatch-likes&#x27; hardly served as a ringing endorsement for the latest event from a galaxy far, far away.
But after all of that waiting, the shooter has finally arrived (as a console exclusive to Switch, no less, at least for now) and it&#x27;s really rather good. Sure, those who have sampled Overwatch&#x27;s class-based stylings might find nothing particularly new here, but at launch Hunters is a fast and fun take on the PvP formula that might even serve as a fitting trial for any Padawans of the genre.

                              <span>Back with a vengeance?
Atlus&#x27; Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance is just around the corner, offering the &#x27;definitive&#x27; experience of the fifth mainline game with two major campaigns and a host of quality-of-life upgrades.
Our own review isn&#x27;t too far off, but if you&#x27;re interested in what the folks over at Famitsu think of it, then you&#x27;re in luck. Thanks to Ryokutya2089 and Gematsu, we can confirm that the first official review for Vengeance has scored the game an impressive 36/40, split 9/9/9/9 across four reviewers as usual.

Fans of the quirky FPS Void Bastards will want to pay attention, because a direct sequel titled Wild Bastards is heading to the Nintendo Switch on 12th September 2024.
Boasting 13 unique playable characters, you&#x27;ll need to manage the relationships between each one, guide their growth, and make sure they don&#x27;t die a horrible death - obviously. Once you&#x27;ve successfully navigated your way through the main campaign, you&#x27;ll unlock a Challenge Mode that introduces modifiers and an ever-increasing difficulty level to really test your skills.

We&#x27;re mere weeks away from the opening showcase at this point, so naturally, information is being pumped out at a rather alarming rate to make sure that everyone and their gran are aware of Keighley&#x27;s plans.

Goichi &#x27;Suda51&#x27; Suda has previously mentioned how Travis Touchdown from the No More Heroes series could potentially return one day, but in his latest interview, he&#x27;s not so sure about it.
Speaking to our friends at Eurogamer during &#x27;MomoCon 2024&#x27; last month, Suda51 noted how the rights of the series are still obviously with Marvelous (rather than his studio Grasshopper Manufacture, who joined NetEase in 2021), so in case you weren&#x27;t already aware of it - it&#x27;s no longer his call to make:

                              <span>Intel odhalil některé další technické detaily o svém připravovaném procesoru Lunar Lake. Půjde o novou generací mobilních procesorů Core Ultra, která navazuje na loňský Meteor Lake. Bude mít dva typy jader: efektivní E-jádra a výkonná P-jádra. Intel také prozradil, že půjde o kombinaci 4E+4P s vypnutým hyper-threadingem. Přidělování jednotlivých úloh závisí na operačním systému, jehož plánovač musí v reálném čase provádět úpravy nastavení vyvažující efektivitu s výpočetním výkonem v závislosti na intenzitě pracovní zátěže.</span>

                              <span>In August 2023, video game giant Bungie filed yet another copyright infringement-based lawsuit targeting up to 50 individuals involved in developing and selling cheat tools for Destiny 2. What set this apart from similar lawsuits was a two-line warning in the complaint&#x27;s introduction. Elsewhere, the statement could&#x27;ve been dismissed as typical anti-piracy posturing, but here, Bungie&#x27;s relentless deanonymization of targets sends a powerful, credible message.

Here is an initial look at the Intel Sierra Forest Linux performance using the Xeon 6766E and Xeon 6780E 144-core server processors in both single and dual socket configurations compared to prior Intel Xeon processors and the AMD EPYC competition.</span>

The announcement post doesn&#x27;t go into much detail about either the reasons for the layoffs or how exactly Avalanche will be supporting the departing staff, adding only that &quot;our focus is now on supporting all Avalanchers through this challenging time&quot; and that &quot;we&#x27;re grateful for the invaluable contributions of those leaving and remain committed to creating incredible gaming experiences for our players.&quot;

                              <span>I was a diehard WipeOut player as a kid. Seriously, me and the boys used to roam the streets of Bradford looking for F-Zero players to bully, at least till the RollCagers rocked up and stole our lunch money. Mind you, I think I was probably less interested in WipeoUt&#x27;s racing than its trackside landscapes, which remain exquisite decades on - all those sweeping album-cover facades with their animate fixtures that thickened and solidified into full-blown peripheral cities as the series progressed. 


I am similarly hooked by the worlds of Ghosts Ehf&#x27;s Phantom Spark, which are a million lightyears from WiPeout in terms of their influences and atmosphere, much as the underlying hover-jockeying is a million lightyears away from WipeouT in terms of its gentleness and lack of combative elements. But these spaces are just as mesmerising to fly through and think about when not focussed on finding the perfect line through the next corner, or avoiding a patch of grass. Small wonder, given that the game&#x27;s art director is Joost Eggermont, whose streaking astral contraptions and &quot;small interactive moments&quot; I&#x27;ve long admired, but never managed to write about until now.

                              <span>From the moment I understood the weakness of my flesh, I thought: no bother, like. Everyone has different skills. Then, I realised that some other people might be less enlightened than me about the whole ‘having limits’ things, and that there was a lot of money to be made hawking implants. Enter space strategy story-spewer Stellaris, specifically, it’s spost specent spee-LC The Machine Age. It adds many options for your space civs, most of which I’m too rusty with the ever-yawpening sandbox’s myriad nuances to appreciate. But what&#x27;s this? A new origin that lets you play as techno-religious corpo-cult obsessed with transcending the limits of their meat prisons through cybernetic augmentations? I recognise that from toys! Let’s do some clicking.

But there&#x27;s one thing I didn&#x27;t flesh out in the preview and that&#x27;s the DLC&#x27;s standalone levelling system, brought to our attention a month or so ago. Well, here I am to flesh it out! Be warned, though, the role of the system is a jarring thing to condense into words.

Life In Jars is this YouTuber I&#x27;ve followed for a while. He makes videos that might involve, say, scooping up some puddle water, leaving it in a sealed jar for a while, then coming back to it a few months later. He&#x27;ll report on the results, which are often tremendous. Look at the LIFE in that jar! The little wriggly lads just wriggling around. The blobs whose job is to float and squidge indiscriminately. A lovely bit of fauna sloshing about there, like a forest dwelling for those who implement the five-second rule. It&#x27;s a reminder that bog water is rather beautiful, actually.
Having spent three hours with Elden Ring expansion Shadow Of The Erdtree&#x27;s opening area, I can&#x27;t help but think of Life In Jars. What resides in the shadowy dome of the Big Tree is horrendous! Miserable! The forgotten creatures and their crumbling homes are grim. But oh my word, the shadows have spawned a beautiful disasterpiece. Just, errr, those other jars? The fun guys with the scoopy arms and little legs? Yeah. I have bad news.

                              <span>I usually avoid writing sentences that could easily be quoted on a Steam page, but the exquisitely satisfying sound that Grunn’s garden shears make is the exception. Please feel free to try any of these on for size: Grunn’s shear sound is the Wilhelm Scream of gardening equipment, sure to be referenced for decades to come. Grunn’s shear sound wormed its way past my eyes and into parts of my brain I’d previously assumed could only be accessed by either masterful ASMR or irresponsibly long Q-tips. I used to have anxiety, but now, my only fear in life is that Grunn’s grass will run out, so I no longer have a reason to click away with its shears. Play Grunn, innit. There are, by the way, lots of other things to like about it, although I cannot hear them over the wonderful sound of these shears.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been one month since the sound of engines began. The hardest track ever created in Trackmania was published by a team of mappers on May 4th, bringing an intimidating 16-floor tower called Deep Dip 2 into the racing game. It became a magnet for competitive drivers after a prize pool of over $30,000 was offered to the first three players to conquer its hellish heights. The prize has yet to be claimed. Even today, determined racers continue to bang their heads against the brutally designed course, featuring icy surfaces, curving rails, and perilous loop-the-loops that hang kilometres about the ground. Some players have parked their hopes and given up. But others persevere. The top three players have reached the final floor and currently stand shoulder to shoulder, eyes focused on the prize.

                              <span>If you heard loud swearing last night in the Watford area it may have been one of two things: 1) me cussing out my (borrowed) Steam Deck while stealthily accessing the wifi from outside a closed public library, as I don&#x27;t currently have broadband at home, or 2) me subsequently trying to make head or tail of Mech Engineer, in which you take charge of a mobile undersea metropolis and send squads of painstakingly assembled robosoldiers to semi-auto-battle squidgy alien fauna. 


Engineering a mech is a Herculean labour whose completion eludes today&#x27;s puny scientists, and Mech Engineer doesn&#x27;t aim to make life easier, whatever its putative status as a &quot;means of fun&quot;. Mech Engineer is a game with an attitude problem, frankly. I realised this on in-game day two, when the interface coughed up a bunch of damage reports presented as pieces of paper, which I then had to crumple up and toss away individually.

                              <span>Dwarven co-op caper Deep Rock Galactic has spent years raising the stakes. Where its offworld mining concern once dealt merely with steep drops and irate bugs, it’s since had to face down the robotic army of a rival mineral corp and an omnicidal alien plague. If the subsequent question is &quot;It used to be about the rocks, y&#x27;know?&quot; then DRG’s imminent Season 5 update, Drilling Deeper, is the answer.

                              <span>Amazon will air a live-action TV series based on Sega&#x27;s Yakuza games in October this year, says the streaming service. Like A Dragon: Yakuza will be a six-part series following characters in the criminal underbelly of Kamurocho, set to straddle between two time periods: 1995 and 2005. The series &quot;showcases modern Japan and the dramatic stories of these intense characters, such as the legendary Kazuma Kiryu, that games in the past have not been able to explore,” said Amazon, who are releasing it through Prime Video, just like their Fallout series.

                              <span>We’ll never know exactly what sort of fiction Tom Clancy would have written if he was less interested in the calibre of specific bullets and their effiency at dismantling burgeoning socialist governments, and more so in the specific sigils required to blast a riot cop through a third story window. While charity shops across the land mourn this devasting loss to their paperback shelves to this very day, we do at least have a glimpse into what such a literary venture may have looked like. Oh, did you like that door? Was it your favourite door? Soz, pal. Strategy game Tactical Breach Wizards just hexed right through it with a new demo as part of Steam Next Fest. I’ve played it, and it’s very exciting stuff, not least for how differently it plays than what I’d expected.

If you&#x27;re into Metroidvanias and cooking (and who isn&#x27;t?), then good news, you&#x27;ll be able to enjoy both at the same time with the upcoming title Magical Delicacy on Switch, launching on 16th July 2024.
We know what you&#x27;re thinking: &quot;Gosh, another Metroidvania?&quot;, and yeah, we get it. But look, this one looks pretty cool and we&#x27;re admittedly enamoured with the idea of a more &#x27;cosy&#x27; Metroidvania that also allows us to unleash our inner chef. Bring on those Michelin Stars, we say.

Soapbox features enable our individual writers and contributors to voice their opinions on hot topics and random stuff they&#x27;ve been chewing over. Today, it&#x27;s time to celebrate Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door&#x27;s Vivian, and Alana does it with Pride.

Nintendo’s track record with LGBTQIA+ characters has been… mixed, to say the least. The Big N hasn’t exactly been the most forward company in making statements, even going as far as to say “we were absolutely not trying to provide social commentary&quot; by not giving the option for same-sex relationships in the 3DS life-simulation game Tomodachi Life back in 2014.

If you&#x27;ve been longing for an official remake of the original Legend of Zelda on the NES, then chances are you&#x27;ll have a pretty hefty wait on your hands. Thankfully, then, you can at least assuage your pain by checking out the latest gameplay video of an unofficial remake from fan Lloyd Empty (thanks, Wccftech). It&#x27;s been up for a little while at this point, but hey, it&#x27;s never too late to highlight excellent projects like this.
Clocking in at just over 20 minutes, the video showcases the game from the beginning, albeit with some interesting alterations to the structure and dialogue. Link will no longer receive a sword from the Old Man; instead, you need to venture into the basement and solve some simple puzzles before you can get yourself equipped.

Considering how much the Fallout franchise has evolved over the years, the original game is still a darn good time and well worth checking out. You can play it on Steam now for under a tenner, if you like, but one fan has gone a step further and ported the game over to the 3DS.
As spotted by TheGamer, the mod was created by MrHuu with details posted on GBATemp. You&#x27;ll need to own a legal copy of the original game to migrate the relevant files over to the 3DS (which, of course, needs to be modded), but overall, it sounds like a relatively painless way to play the game on something that isn&#x27;t the Steam Deck.

Nintendo&#x27;s latest remake drops into second this time as Hogwarts Legacy once again claims the crown. F1 24 has also zoomed onto the podium, reaching third place in its debut week.

                              <span>Devolver Digital has released an intriguing teaser for what appears to be a new project by Solar Ash and Hyper Light Drifter developer Heart Machine. The reveal is advertised for June 7, the day of the Devolver Direct showcase.
Heart Machine is currently working on Hyper Light Breaker, a 3D third-person co-op action game that is the spiritual successor to Hyper Light Drifter. Gearbox is publishing that game, confirming Devolver&#x27;s teaser is for something different. Based on this brief clip, it’s hard to gauge the nature of this game. It shows a sunset cityscape with a silhouette of a figure, the scene emblazoned with Heart Machine&#x27;s logo. But given the studio’s impressive pedigree, we’re excited and surprised to see a new title so soon.


The Devolver Direct airs on June 7 at 5 p.m. PT/8 p.m. ET. You can keep up with the other summer showcases with our evolving schedule of events. For more on Heart Machine, check out our extended preview for Hyper Light Breaker and our reviews of Solar Ash and Hyper Light Drifter.</span>

                              <span>Elden Ring was Game Informer&#x27;s 2022 Game of the Year, so we&#x27;re chomping at the bit to play its upcoming expansion, Shadow of the Erdtree. Editor Marcus Stewart got to do just that at a recent preview event, and he sits down with Wesley LeBlanc to unpack his time with the expansion and share new details about the experience. For a more in-depth breakdown of his hands-on excursion, be sure to read his Shadow of the Erdtree preview as well.

WayForward Technologies has worked on several well-known franchises over the years, including the likes of Contra, Silent Hill, The Mummy, Transformers, and even Aliens. Despite this, the reveal that the developer would collaborate with Atari on a brand new Yars entry came as a genuine shock to many, this writer included.
Not only is Yars&#x27; Revenge one of the most beloved Atari 2600 games of the early &#x27;80s, but the game, along with its sequels, is fundamentally an arcade shooter. So when WayForward introduced Yars Rising as a Metroidvania starring charismatic hacker Emi Kimura, you&#x27;d be forgiven for raising an eyebrow. How could such a drastic departure from the original possibly work? Would snippets of classic Yars gameplay sprinkled throughout the experience be enough to satisfy old-school fans?

Now, Meridia has imploded and become a radiant, wailing, purple-fringed disc of pure nothingness, with triumphant players rudely ejected from orbit via emergency hyperspace jump, but subsequently allowed to return and gaze into the dark heart of their victory.

                              <span>Update: Card Bard appears to be a copy of a game by another developer, Dire Decks by kindanice. Dire Decks was released in 2023 on itch.io and was well received there. Kindanice has pointed out the direct likeness between their game and the one released on Steam under another name. Yikes. Thanks to our diligent commenters for catching this. We&#x27;ll try to find out more. 
Original article: The onslaught of fun Steam Next Fest demos you can play right now continues and will not relent. Card Bard is a deckbuilding roguelike shooter in which your wee gunman is seemingly frozen in abject terror as little pill-shaped baddies creep towards him like bacteria on a petri dish. Good thing you have a hand of cards, each one showing how many bullets will bop forth from your body when you select it. It&#x27;s surprisingly tough for something so pastel-paletted. I&#x27;m 10th on the leaderboard. You can probably beat that, right?

                              <span>In EA&#x27;s Desert Strike - released way back in the dim salvages of 1992 - you are a helicopter pilot scooting around a Sylvester Stallone reinvention of Iraq, shooting down tanks and fighters with guns and missiles while rescuing VIPs and fretting constantly about your wafer-thin armour and espresso-sized fuel reserves. It was a no-frills piece of Gulf War fanfic, complete with George Bush ending cameo, and a well-made shooter that used to drive me nuts on Sega Mega Drive.
Megacopter: Blades Of The Goddess is Desert Strike, but heavily Blood-Dragonified and with a big dollop of Airwolf to boot. Here, the enemy troops are naughty Reptoid aliens, the writing is scattershot-satirical (upgrades are bought with pizza tokens) and your helicopter houses the soul of a blood-drinking &quot;AZ-TECH&quot; goddess. Is it a nuanced parody of the Strike series? It doesn&#x27;t feel like it. Did I enjoy the demo? Yes. Does it have a crawling tentacle boss called Queen Oildusa? Also yes, and will you please stop asking questions so I can write the rest of this article.

                              <span>Since the death of E3, June has descended into a chaotic clusterfunk of trailers, broadcasts, announcements, and a generalised frenzy of publicity-seeking barking noises. Summer Game Fest has emerged as a hub for a lot of developers seeking eyes. The 2-hour show hosted by marketing man Geoff Keighley will be broadcasting on Friday, blasting you in the ocular nerves with, probably, a lot of games. However, most of these games will not be brand new, exciting reveals, said Keighley himself in a fresh Twitch Q &amp; A. &quot;There will be, definitely, new announcements,&quot; he said, &quot;but the show is largely focused on, I think, existing games that have new updates for fans.&quot; He&#x27;s mentioning this ahead of time, he said, to set expectations.

                              <span>I&#x27;m sure you could fill a bottomless pit with the things Larian decided not to add to Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3. One of those things was, in fact, a bottomless pit. Not just a bottomless pit, but a conveniently portable, Looney Tunes-esque hole into which you could seemingly chuck everything from items and equipment to characters. Speaking to me during the same interview in which they discussed long-abandoned plans for bringing back Baldur’s Gate 1’s Candlekeep, Larian CEO Swen Vincke and Baldur’s Gate 3 lead writer Adam Smith (RPS in peace) touched on the subject with tantalising brevity. Argh, if only I hadn’t had to run off and catch a taxi, I’d still be there now, discussing the many applications of a portable hole. Bypassing carrying capacity limits would just be the start of it.

                              <span>If you love cosy games where the biggest challenge is choosing between which farm utensil to place next to your barn doors, then Tiny Glade may be just the game for you. It&#x27;s a creative building game like The Sims 4 but with none of the fuss of actually controlling lives - and no quests, combat or arbitrary challenges of any kind.

Instead, Tiny Glade simply offers a meadow and tools with which to build. The vibe of the game is cottage-core at its finest, with enough whimsigoth finery that you&#x27;ll soon lament that you can&#x27;t actually live inside your glorious creations. I&#x27;ve played the charming demo as part of Steam Next Fest, and you&#x27;ll find some thoughts from my time with it below.

                              <span>A DIY engineer has created a realistic tank simulator that puts the average haptic controller to shame. The mechanical monster is jury-rigged to the top of an office desk and must be reloaded with a new shell after every shot. The recoil is terrifying. It&#x27;s operated by three people: one person drives the tank with a steering wheel and levers, another uses cranks to aim the gun barrel, and a third reloads the shells that eject automatically from the chamber after every desk-lifting blast. The &quot;shells&quot; in question are 2-litre bottles of fizzy drink, and the crew has set up a whole rack of these bottles for panicked reloading. If you are the kind of person who yearns for the immersion of the legendary Steel Battalion controller then you will get a definite buzz from watching the death machine in action below.

SGF is sort of already in motion - last week, Sony kicked off the proceedings with their latest State of Play showcase, but you can expect the majority of new videogame announcements from Friday 7th June with the Summer Game Fest 2024 Opening Showcase, a two-hour livestreamed event which starts at 10pm UK, 5pm ET and 2pm PT. I&#x27;ll be out there covering the whole sorry affair in LA from Thursday to Monday while the remainder of Rock Paper Shotgun hold the fort on London time.

Riven has been reimagined by its original creators at Cyan Worlds. The game now boasts full freedom of movement, updated gameplay, improved graphics, and reworked puzzles. It also introduces new content through characters, challenges, and storytelling.

                              <span>After teasing PC support tests earlier this year, the PC adapter for PlayStation VR2 arrives this August, the company has revealed. More specifically, the device will cost $59.99 and hit select retailers and PlayStation&#x27;s online store starting August 7. With this device, you can use the PlayStation VR2 hardware to play SteamVR games, including the critically acclaimed Half-Life: Alyx. 
Ironically, PlayStation gamers have been asking for a Half-Life: Alyx port for PlayStation VR (and now PlayStation VR2) for years. Though that still isn&#x27;t happening, this PC adapter at least allows players to use their PlayStation VR2 device to play the game through Steam. They can do the same with hundreds of other SteamVR games, like Fallout 4 VR and War Thunder.

                              <span>It’s been a while since we last got an update on Metal Slug Tactics, the turn-based strategy spin-off of the popular side-scrolling shoot &#x27;em up. The game was first announced during the online-only E3 2021 and has suffered a few delays since then with minimal updates. After a long wait, the game has finally reemerged with a new trailer and a fall 2024 launch window.
The new video shows off the game&#x27;s spin on tactics, with long-time stars Marco, Eri, Fio, and Tarma taking literal turns obliterating the opposition. The game sees players building squads of classic Metal Slug characters, each with unique loadouts of recognizable series weapons, to take on signature villains and bosses, like the warship in the video.


Metal Slug Tactics is developed by Leikir Studio and is published by Dotemu, the team behind TMNT: Shredder&#x27;s Revenge. Famed composer Tee Lopes (Shredder&#x27;s Revenge, Sonic Mania) is developing the game&#x27;s soundtrack. 
When first revealed, Metal Slug Tactics was only slated to launch for Switch and PC. Today&#x27;s trailer confirms that it&#x27;s also coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.</span>

                              <span>Kena: Bridge of Spirits is making the leap to Xbox in August. The 2021 action-adventure game has been available only on PlayStation and PC, and its move to Microsoft’s platform comes with some new in-game goodies.
As the debut title by Ember Lab, this story-driven action game stars Kena, a young spirit guide who must unravel the mystery of a destroyed village by helping lost souls move on to the afterlife. She’s assisted by the Rot, tiny, adorable spirits Kena can command to aid in puzzle-solving and combat. The game’s design draws inspiration from series such as The Legend of Zelda, while combat has shades of From Software’s Dark Souls. 
Kena hits Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One on August 15 for $39.99 and will include exclusive pirate-themed Rot hats, a Golden Rot skin, and a unique staff for Kena. A new physical premium edition will also be available and will consist of these items, a digital soundtrack, and an exclusive sticker sheet. The Xbox version also includes the Anniversary DLC update, which includes the Spirit Guide Trials, additional Kena outfits, and New Game+


We awarded Kena: Bridge of Spirits a 9 out of 10, with former editor-in-chief Andrew Reiner writing in his review, &quot;Bridge of Spirits stumbles a little in spots, yet confidently sprints into the heart of the adventure, rewarding the player with secrets galore and visuals that are almost always worth admiring. If you love Zelda-like games or are just looking for an experience that will make you smile every step of the way, you can’t go wrong with Kena: Bridge of Spirits.&quot; The game was also a sales success, recouping its development costs a month after its initial release in September 2021.

                              <span>This year&#x27;s Summer Game Fest showcase is happening this week, on Friday, June 7, at 2 p.m. PT/5 p.m. ET, and with more than 55 studios and publishers set to be featured at the event (including Play Days this weekend) this year, fans have been speculating on what they might see. That includes Kingdom Hearts fans, who have been hoping to see something related to Kingdom Hearts IV at SGF this year, given it&#x27;s been more than two years since its reveal. 
However, SGF host and creator Geoff Keighley thinks Kingdom Hearts fans should lower their expectations for the show. 
&quot;People keep asking about Kingdom Hearts, I don&#x27;t know why,&quot; Keighley says during a recent stream where he answered questions about SGF. &quot;I think it&#x27;s because we did [Final Fantasy VII Rebirth] last year or something like that. But yeah, people are setting themselves up for failure but you guys can keep hoping.&quot; 
Here&#x27;s a clip of it, too:

Now, Keighley could be playing coy, especially with the &quot;but you guys can keep hoping&quot; part at the end, but it&#x27;s more likely that he&#x27;s trying to nicely let Kingdom Hearts fans know that if they expect to see Kingdom Hearts IV during SGF, they might be disappointed. 
In the meantime, watch the Kingdom Hearts IV reveal trailer, and then read Game Informer&#x27;s exclusive interview with Tetsuya Nomura about Kingdom Hearts IV, the series&#x27; future with Final Fantasy, and more.

&quot;I promise you, we will not be The Last of Us studio forever,&quot; Druckmann said, revealing the team is working on &quot;multiple single-player projects.&quot; He continued, adding, &quot;We create experiences that are steeped in story and characters, especially relationships. The stories have some sort of philosophical core that everything is going to revolve around and feed into.&quot;

Did you know that the word &#x27;book&#x27; was originally spelled with several extra &#x27;o&#x27;s in it? This was changed when it was collectively decided that telling someone to &quot;please, just read a book&quot; was resulting in several more murders a year than anyone could be bothered to keep track of. This week, it’s Obsidian vet and Pentiment creator Josh Sawyer! Cheers Josh! Mind if we have a nose at your bookshelf?

In which case, wow, bold of Hugo Martin to cast himself as the Doom Slayer, but I like the moxy. Before I barge into the comments uninvited and argue with no-one in particular that Doom Eternal’s lateral expansion of its gameplay loop was ultimately a fantastic choice for the long-term health of the series, you swine, let’s read this week’s best writing about games (and game related things!)

                              <span>Spain&#x27;s Ministry of the Interior says eight people have been arrested after police dismantled a €5.3m pirate IPTV network serving local expats. Authorities aren&#x27;t naming the service but if the name TVMucho rings any bells, people are on the right track. That police identified the owner of the service is no surprise. The Dutchman has never hidden away and has continuously claimed his service operates legally. If only in part, it&#x27;s still streaming channels right now.

                              <span>I haven&#x27;t played Bloodborne and so references to its world or characters mean little to me. Kart racers, meanwhile? There I&#x27;m in my element due to a lifetime of Mario Kart, Diddy Kong Racing and Sonic &amp; All-Stars Racing Transformed. It&#x27;s those games that make me interested in Nightmare Kart, a PSX-aesthetic racing game which was formerly known as Bloodborne Kart, and which is out now.

Omenroad turns out to be the end of the road, however, both for Wildermyth and - for now - for the team that made it, Worldwalker Games.

                              <span>It feels as if every action-RPG can be described in terms of its relationship to genre daddy Diablo. Wolcen:Lords Of Mayhem, for example, launched a few months after Diablo 4 was announced and helped to satiate some early click cravings. Briefly.

Early positive sentiment was quickly scuppered by bugs, slow updates and more. Now its developers say that they&#x27;re ending support for the game, and multiplayer functionality will be switched off this September.

                              <span>Merry weekends, everyone! It&#x27;s time for a chill couple of days, I think. A bunch of us have recently returned from trips down to the Brighton office to meet some new faces. Weird to think I&#x27;m now the most far-flung of the lot, living way up here in Glasgow. Maybe that&#x27;s why I elected to take over these Playing This Weekend posts, to help fill the friendless void growing inside my heart.
So just know that if you don&#x27;t sound off in the comments below with news of what you&#x27;re playing this weekend, the void in my heart will grow, until one day it consumes me. And then who will write these posts? Here&#x27;s what we&#x27;re clicking on this weekend!

He created Killer7, the No More Heroes series, worked with James Gunn (before he directed Guardians of the Galaxy or was put in charge of DC films) on Lollipop Chainsaw, and lots more. In preparation for his role as the keynote speaker at MomoCon this year, we caught up with him over e-mail to discuss his next game, Hotel Barcelona (a collaboration with Deadly Premonition creator Hidetaka &quot;Swery65&quot; Suehiro), remastering his 2011 game Shadows of the Damned, Batman, and more.
Game Informer: Hotel Barcelona is inspired by horror films. Are there specific films you cite as references?
Goichi &quot;Suda51&quot; Suda: There are a lot of them. Swery of White Owls is the main creator, so you should probably ask him …</span>

Overall, sites are still being blocked in large numbers, but the real growth isn&#x27;t found on main domains. Easily and quickly deployed at almost no cost, subdomains can circumvent blocking and Spain blocks them in their thousands.

                              <span>After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora&#x27;s Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora&#x27;s Mask&#x27;s unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 1:00 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved.

                              <span>Toys for Bob, the developer of Crash Bandicoot 4 and the Skylanders series, has announced a publishing deal with Xbox for its next game. The studio recently went independent after splitting off from its former parent company, Activision Blizzard.
The studio states its new title is &quot;very early in development&quot; and that we won&#x27;t see it for some time. Whatever this game is, Xbox will be its home, which isn&#x27;t surprising since the studio teased it was exploring a relationship with the publisher a couple of months ago.
We&#x27;re excited to announce that we&#x27;ll be partnering with @Xbox to publish our next new game. We&#x27;re still very early in development, so you might not hear from us for a bit - but know that we&#x27;re working hard on an experience we&#x27;re so sooo inspired about! Can&#x27;t wait to share more 💜 pic.twitter.com/6EqrQbabpv

Toys For Bob went independent in February, a few months after Microsoft acquired Activision Blizzard. The studio is seemingly getting to have its cake and eat it too, since it still gets to work with Xbox while being an autonomous entity. Prior to leaving Activision, Toys For Bob worked on the recent Crash Bandicoot games such as Crash Bandicoot 4: It&#x27;s About Time and Crash Team Rumble. It also developed the Spyro Reignited Trilogy and created the once-wildly popular Skylanders series.

                              <span>During Sony&#x27;s PlayStation State of Play, new gameplay and details were shared for Marvel Rivals. For the uninitiated. Marvel Rivals is a superhero (specifically Marvel superhero) team-based PVP shooter inspired by games like Overwatch. The footage, seen below, reveals Venom and Adam Warlock are coming to the game. The footage also shows a new location – the Tokyo 2099: Spider-Islands map.
Alongside the new gameplay details, the game is now also confirmed to be coming to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S alongside the previously confirmed PC platform. Developer NetEase is also planning a closed beta for the game in July. PlayStation beta testers will have exclusive access to Spider-Man&#x27;s Scarlet Spider cosmetic skin.

                              <span>Little Nightmares III, the horror action platformer from Supermassive Games, has moved into 2025. The game never had a specific release date, but we were admittedly expecting it this year. In a post on the official Little Nightmares III X account, the team shared the message below, writing, &quot;As much as we can&#x27;t wait for you to return to the Nowhere, we also want to make sure we give the game the care and love it deserves. Quality is a top priority for us, and we know you feel the same way. For this reason, we&#x27;ve made the decision to shift the release of the game to 2025.&quot;
Please do bear with us, little ones, for we need a little extra time to prepare your visit.

Notably, Supermassive, the developer behind games like Until Dawn (which is coming to PC and PlayStation 5 soon) did not develop the first two games. Those games were developed by Tarsier Studios, whose next project has not been announced.

                              <span>If you haven’t followed Infinity Nikki, it’s equal parts charming, beautiful, and ambitious. The open-world game is the latest entry in the Nikki series of fashion games, which is very popular in Asia, and Westerners are getting their biggest exposure to it yet with this charming adventure. 


The game unfolds on the magical continent of Miraland, and Nikki must save it. Her main power is &quot;styling,&quot; which involves changing clothes from different nations, allowing her to adopt unique abilities. For example, one outfit allows her to float while another cleanses corrupted creatures of demonic energy. The trailer shows one outfit that lets players summon a giant flower to glide through the air. Another ability shrinks her to the size of her small companion, Momo, to access tight areas and other locations. 
The more outfits you collect, the more abilities Nikki has to solve puzzles and overcome platforming obstacles. But despite the &quot;save the world&quot; premise, Infinity Nikki is billed as a relaxing adventure. You can also catch bugs, go fishing, and gather resources to craft new outfits, among other activities. 
Infinity Nikki looks wild, and fans can get their first taste of it in a beta test happening during Q3 of this year. The game is coming to PlayStation 5, PC, iOS, and Android but has no release window.</span>

                              <span>Developer Survios has released the first look at gameplay in its upcoming VR game, Alien: Rogue Incursion, and it turns out, exploring a seemingly abandoned  facility in VR looks as terrifying as you&#x27;d expect.
The trailer aired during today&#x27;s PlayStation State of Play as the game is coming to PS VR2, but it&#x27;s also coming to Meta Quest 3 and Steam (for other PC VR devices) this holiday season. In the trailer, we get a few glimpses of some Xenomorphs, the tracking device we&#x27;ll be using to avoid said Xenomorphs, and a look at some pods that indicate we might be fighting more than one. 
Check it out for yourself in the Alien: Rogue Incursion gameplay trailer below: 


In a new PlayStation Blog post, Survios chief product officer TQ Jefferson explains that Alien: Rogue Incursion was developed from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5. Jefferson also shares that the &quot;high tension shooter&quot; tasks players with exploring an &quot;overrun facility on the inhospitable planet Purdan.&quot; 
&quot;Dynamically spawning and pathing with countless unique possibilities, even we couldn&#x27;t tell you exactly where and when each Xenomorph will strike, let alone what strategies it might use or if it&#x27;ll bring some friends,&quot; the blog post reads. &quot;While heart-pounding combat is the core of Alien: Rogue Incursion, grabbing your pulse rifle and blasting your way out of every situation is not always the best strategy. 
&quot;Constantly hunted by unpredictable and resourceful Xenomorphs, players will often find creativity and a level head to be their greatest weapons, especially when it comes to leveraging the environment to their advantage.&quot; 
Alien: Rogue Incursion hits VR this holiday season.

                              <span>Until Dawn, the 2015 horror adventure game from Supermassive Games, is coming to PlayStation 5 and PC in remake form this fall. We received a new trailer for the beloved game alongside the announcement during today&#x27;s State of Play presentation. 
Until Dawn puts you in control of eight teenagers/young adults who venture up a mountain for a fun night in a secluded cabin. In typical slasher-movie fashion, there is much more than meets the eye regarding this cabin and its surrounding area. Relying heavily on player choice, Until Dawn&#x27;s narrative uses a system called the Butterfly Effect, where pivotal choices you make have consequences that go far beyond that which you can immediately recognize. The game stars actors like Rami Malek, Hayden Panettiere, Meaghan Martin, and more.


Originally announced as a full remake of the game, the trailer footage does not appear to be a significant step up in terms of visuals, appearing to be more in line with the industry&#x27;s definition of a remaster. PlayStation&#x27;s official description says it&#x27;s been &quot;rebuilt and enhanced for PS5 consoles and PC.&quot; Developed by Ballistic Moon, this improved version also boasts new environments, collectibles, and re-cut narrative sequences. 
We loved Until Dawn when it arrived on PlayStation 4 in 2015, awarding it a score of 9 out of 10. In the time since Until Dawn&#x27;s original release, Supermassive has released other games in the genre, including The Dark Pictures Anthology and The Quarry. The studio is currently working on The Casting of Frank Stone, a game set in the Dead by Daylight universe. Until Dawn arrives on PlayStation 5 and PC this fall.</span>

                              <span>It’s been a long time since we wrote about a new Dynasty Warriors game, but that changes today with the announcement of Dynasty Warriors: Origins, the new release from Koei Tecmo’s Omega Force studio, a team long known for work on the venerable franchise.
The games have an unusual identity and are, in some ways, a genre unto themselves. They almost always feature large-scale battles in which the lead character can sweep through dozens of enemy combatants with a single swing.
That playstyle appears to remain intact if this new trailer is to be believed.
A lot has changed in action gameplay in the years since Dynasty Warriors was at its most popular, but there’s no doubt that the series once had an enthusiastic fanbase.
We’ll see if the series is able to update its gameplay and draw in new fans when it hits PlayStation 5 next year.</span>

                              <span>Today&#x27;s State of Play concluded with the reveal of a new Astro Bot game. Unlike the last entry, Astro&#x27;s Playroom, which was a PS5 launch title and a glorified (but very fun) tech demo for the console, this new game is a full-fledged platforming adventure. It&#x27;s also got an easy-to-remember name: Astro Bot. 
The trailer sees Astro Bot soaring through the galaxy on a Dual Sense-shaped spaceship to explore a variety of vibrant platforming stages set to a smile-inducing soundtrack. He also shows off new abilities like donning gloves that fire springs to grab and swing enemies, soaking water like a sponge to grow gigantic, and, best of all, just a random Parappa the Rappa reference (among other PlayStation franchises). It looks delightful, and we want to play it. 


A PlayStation Blog post also states the game features over 80 levels across 6 galaxies, 20 new abilities, and 70 new enemy types. Astro Bot will be available on PlayStation 5 on September 6. Our review of Astro&#x27;s Playroom can be found here.</span>

                              <span>The remake of Silent Hill 2 has a new trailer and a release date of October 8. Surprisingly, this news comes during Sony’s State of Play instead of the Silent Hill Transmission airing later tonight. 
Regardless, we aren’t complaining about seeing more of Bloober Team’s remake of the PS2 classic. The trailer provides new looks at gameplay and the psychological scares that made the first game so beloved. 


Silent Hill 2 is coming to PlayStation 5 as a console exclusive as well as PC.</span>

                              <span>Capcom has pulled back the curtains on Monster Hunter Wilds, revealing gameplay in a brand new trailer that aired during today&#x27;s PlayStation State of Play. In this trailer, we watch a monster hunter ride through a treacherous sandstorm on the back of a mount before starting a fight with a lion-like bear creature, and as you might expect, it looks great. 
We then watch our hunter fight a rocky toad monster in a cavernous canyon area before three buffalo-esque monsters join the fight. If you&#x27;ve played a Monster Hunter before, you have a good idea of what Wilds looks like – big, flashy, and exciting. 
Check it out for yourself in the Monster Hunter Wilds trailer below: 


This is our first look at Monster Hunter Wilds since its reveal at The Game Awards 2023 last December. Those with Monster Hunter World and Monster Hunter World: Iceborne save date will get exclusive in-game rewards. The trailer also reiterates that Monster Hunter Wild hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC in 2025.

                              <span>Today’s PlayStation State of Play brought a lengthy new trailer for Where Winds Meet, an upcoming action game from Everstone Studio. The Chinese studio describes its project as “Groundbreaking Oriental Wuxia Open World” on its official website. Today’s trailer seems to bear that out, with a number of bombastic and over-the-top scenes featuring high-flying martial arts against the backdrop of rainswept forests, burning castles, and warriors wielding sword and spear.
Today’s video makes it clear that the game is in development for PlayStation 5, but no word yet on a release date.</span>

                              <span>PlayStation has announced it is bringing its 2022 hit PlayStation-exclusive game, God of War Ragnarök, to PC. It revealed this during today&#x27;s State of Play with a new trailer alongside a September 19 release date. 
This follows PlayStation&#x27;s recent trend of bringing its single-player, narrative-driven games over to PC years after they first launch on PlayStation. Just this month, it brought Ghost of Tsushima Director&#x27;s Cut to PC, and today, PlayStation CEO Hermen Hulst revealed all live-service games will launch day-and-date on PS5 and PC while &quot;tentpole&quot; single-player games will launch at later dates on PC. 
As you might expect, the PC version of God of War Ragnarök will feature unlocked frame rates, Nvidia DLSS 3.7. (and AMD FSR 3.1 and Intel XESS 1.3), super ultrawide support, and other PC features. This version of Ragnarök will feature the free Valhalla DLC from last year, too, and pre-purchasing the game gets you in-game rewards like the Kratos Risen Snow Armor and Atreus Risen Snow Tunic. 
Check it out for yourself below in the God of War Ragnarök PC reveal trailer: 


According to the game&#x27;s Steam listing, it will require a PlayStation Network account. 
God of War Ragnarök hits PC on September 19, 2024.

                              <span>Today’s State of Play revealed a new fantasy action game called Ballad of Antara. The trailer shows all manner of over-the-top stylish combat against supernatural foes. However, the hero does all of this while carrying a small child on his back.


Ballad of Antara is billed as an Unreal Engine 5 single-player, free-to-play action RPG starring multiple characters called Emissaries. Each of these characters sports their own class and abilities, as well as a unique story. Players will travel between two worlds seeking out these Emissaries to strengthen your force, but the young girl being carried around is the apparently the key to salvation. A PlayStation Blog post on the game describes your duty to her as such: &quot;You will help her undo the devastation done to this desolate world through trials, twists, and confrontation, and witness her growth along the way.&quot;
In addition to a single-player story, the game lets up to three players explore together in multiplayer, whether they be close buddies or total strangers wandering the game alongside you. Developer Tipworks also states plans to continually update Ballad of Antara post-launch with new zones, story content, and Emissaries. 
Ballad of Antara is coming to PS5, PC, and mobile platforms in 2025.</span>

                              <span>PlayStation has formally revealed Concord, the first game from Firewalk Studios, which it acquired in 2023, and it brings a healthy (and comedic dose) of sci-fi to the console&#x27;s 2024 lineup. Concord is both the start of a new sci-fi IP for PlayStation and a five-versus-five-player multiplayer shooter coming to PlayStation 5 and PC this year. 
Before showcasing some third-person shooter gameplay, a vignette setting up the game&#x27;s world and tone played, and it&#x27;s here we get a look at its Guardians of the Galaxy-esque action. We see several characters who appear to make up the rag-tag group of heroes we&#x27;ll be controlling, each with seemingly unique abilities, attempting to capture a special device from someone attempting to escape a rundown locale called Crater City. 
Check it out for yourself in the Concord cinematic reveal below: 


After this vignette, PlayStation showcased our first look at Concord&#x27;s gameplay. We get a look at Vale, a sniper, Lennox, a cowboy-esque revolver shooter, Haymar, who uses a magical bow and arrow, Star Child, a brutish shotgun user, and 1-Off, a support character who appears to use support-type elemental moves. The gameplay looks reminiscent of Destiny 2&#x27;s PvP modes, although brighter in color and more fantastical in visual design. 
Check out the Concord gameplay reveal for yourself below:


After the gameplay, some of the Firewalk developers spoke about what players can expect, including deployable gear that can exist throughout a full game (across multiple rounds) and asymmetrical match-ups between players. While the gameplay only showcased five characters, a quick look at the game&#x27;s roster revealed several more. 
Firewalk says every week when you log on to Concord, you&#x27;ll be treated to a short cutscene vignette teaching you more about the characters. 
Firewalk and PlayStation will hold a beta on PS5 and PC this July before the game&#x27;s simultaneous launch on those platforms on August 23, 2024.

                              <span>Arkane Austin&#x27;s ailing vampire shooter Redfall has received its final update, as the developers themselves are purged by parent company Microsoft. Announced a few weeks back, Redfall game update 4 introduces a much-requested offline mode and single-player pausing, together with some new progression features and activities: a Community Standing bar whereby Support currency can be spent on rewards from the Safehouse Skill tree, and Elder Nests, aka vampire nests with specially modified vampire bosses. That&#x27;s in addition to new enemy encounters in Redfall Commons, improved AI and a new Unrivaled Weapon.

                              <span>I regret not covering Skald Colon Against The Black Priory when its developer told us about it 2019. I&#x27;d get to be so smug now.
Skald is terrific. I&#x27;ve tried to come up with a clever angle on its journey, but they all wind up saying the same thing: For all its retro stylings (right down to party portraits taking up an unnecessary quarter of the screen at all times), it&#x27;s an accessible, charming treat, and the best modernisation of 80s RPGs that I&#x27;ve ever played.

                              <span>I fear we may have swum the Rubicon of diminishing returns where multiplayer horror games inspired by Lethal Company are concerned. The recent Content Warning has sucked up all the remaining oxygen in the room, and oxygen is pretty important in Murky Divers, for reasons that are hopefully self-evident. Still, Murky Divers has some fairly eye-catching USPs. It&#x27;s got underwater physics, of course, and it puts you and - unhelpfully - your friends in charge of a submarine.

                              <span>There is a time for perfect clarity in a shooter, for clean walls and clear-cut character silhouettes. But this is not it. Retro first-person gunwaltzer Selaco is a messy machine gun dash through an office exploding with glass, concrete, splinters, and sparks. The glock-toting wreckage &#x27;em up first hit our radar when it was announced as a modern combination of F.E.A.R. and Doom, promising both the fiendish AI enemies of the former and the satisfying blasting of the latter. Well, it&#x27;s out today. Bursting forth into the corporate lobby of early access with uzis akimbo, peppering the walls with angry bullets. Good, I say.

                              <span>In Mike Judge’s 1999 cult comedy Office Space, there’s a scene where Ron Livingston’s Peter - a programmer working a tedious corporate job - visits a hypnotist. “Is there any way that you could, sorta, just zonk me out so I don’t know that I’m at work, in here,” Peter asks of the hypnotist, pointing to his head. “Could I come home and think that I’ve been fishing all day, or something?”. That’s basically the high-level concept for brilliant sci-fi comedy show Severance, right there. Not wanting to spoil any more than I absolutely have to, I’ll present you with two facts up top. 1. It features a touching queer relationship between John Turturro and Christopher Walken and 2. It’s some of the best television I’ve seen in the last few years. Throw in some Stanley Parable, Control, Gilliam’s Brazil, and some more meta undertones of general musing on gamified reward loops, and you’ve got Severance.

                              <span>Between this, my supporter post later, and the fact I decided to watch Office Space again this week, I’d like to make it clear to any colleagues or management reading that I value and love them all dearly, and am 110% committed to the eternal grind machine of covering videogames online. Workday malaise is universal, however, whether or not you’re lucky enough to enjoy your job as much as I do. Enter Office Fight, a stylish physics action game where you, a ghost, posess office equipment to cause as much physics-based chaos as possible. The PR did some Office Space jokes in the email, so I pretty much had to cover it. At least once I realised what they were doing, after initially just thinking they were being a massive donkey.

The topic, comedy rock RPG/door-kicking sim Deathbulge: Battle of the Bands, was picked by a sadly absent Alice B, but you know what they say when beloved colleagues become ensnared in the kind of Kafkaesque employment limbo that only a corporate acquisition can engineer: the show must go on. We’re therefore sticking to the schedule, and will launch the liveblog at 4pm BST today, Friday May 31st.

                              <span>Riot games have committed to a series of new measures to curtail harassment and hate-speech in the Valorant community. In a video entitled ‘Keeping Our Community Healthy // Dev Updates,” studio head Anna Donlon took to Xitter to outline the new measures for the competitive FPS. Below is a graphic detailing the changes, which include new penalties such as hardware bans for offenders, and an expanded role for the game&#x27;s Voice Evaluation tech, which monitors chat for bad behaviour. “If you want to make evil statements under the guise of &#x27;[naughty word SEO doesn&#x27;t like being in the first paragraph] talk&#x27;, you aren&#x27;t welcome here,” writes the official Valorant account.

                              <span>Capcom&#x27;s upcoming entry in the lizard pants-making sim, Monster Hunter Wilds, got a new trailer at last night&#x27;s State Of Play. It showed off more of how its lovely desert environments morph to fit the weather and how its inhabitants largely don&#x27;t get on. We also got a look at some cursed lions, an armoured frog with an unsettling tongue and a rideable Chocobo-esque mount that lets you ping arrows on the fly. Let me break it down for you readers, as someone who is increasingly excited at the prospect of more colourful pants.

                              <span>This piece is being written on a train as I trundle towards our very first staff meeting with Rock Paper Shotgun&#x27;s new overlords. The morning is cloudy but bright and calm, the north London suburbs are a blissful checkerboard of red roofs and flourishing lawns, hope glistens faintly in the gutters and ditches beside the tube. How unlike the innards of Centum, a point-and-click horror game (Steam page here) that begins with a dreary retro desktop interface on which there are curious text files, curioser decryption tools and most curious of all, an .exe of some kind that drops you into a simulation consisting of a stone prison chamber. Hang on, I&#x27;m changing trains...

                              <span>My PC has a big white case, and sometimes, I sit and think: “big white box good!” But other times, I glance over to my PS5 and think: “other big white box also good!” Then I start getting fanciful and imagine a lovely future where they can both combine into one. Keeping track of two big white boxes is hard! Luckily, I only have to write about one of those big white boxes for RPS the vast majority of the time. Today is one of the rare occasions I do have to cover both, so here’s everything announced at yesterday’s Playstation State Of Play that you, the discerning big white box owner, might find relevant:

                              <span>Sony have dropped a trailer and release date for Concord at their latest State Of Play, Concord being a new 5V5 multiplayer FPS in which you play a bunch of freegans carrying out heists on various loudly coloured alien planets. Sorry, not freegans - freegunners. Freeganism is a portmanteau of &quot;free&quot; and &quot;vegan&quot; referring to people who fish jars of near-spoiled hummus out of supermarket dumpsters according to an ideology of minimal resource consumption. Freegunners, meanwhile, are lairy Guardians Of The Galaxy-alike mercenaries with phat guns and playstyle-defining secondary abilities. They do not consume hummus as far as I know. The game is out 23rd August 2024, with a beta happening in July, and I&#x27;ve got an overview trailer for you below.

                              <span>Per last night’s Sony State of Play, PS5 darling and supposedly rather good action-dad adventure God of War Ragnarök is coming to PC on September 19th 2024. The good news is that the port, co-developed by Jetpack Interactive and original makers Santa Monica Studio, will pack in all the DLSS 3, FSR 3, and ultrawide what-have-yous that one might expect from a big, monied PC release. The bad, silly, clearly pointless news is that it will need a PlayStation Network (PSN) account, despite the complete lack of multiplayer.

Tato melodie byla vyhodnocena jako porušení autorských práv, protože se shoduje s nahrávkou od uživatele Audego starou devět let. Což je vlastně přesně nahraná melodie pračky Samsung.

Začne s tím už 3. června, přičemž se to nejprve dotkne vývojářského kanálu Dev a Canary. Uživatelům se budou rozšíření vypínat postupně a vše by mělo být hotovo na začátku příštího roku.</span>

                              <span>Revealed during The Game Awards 2023 last December, The First Descendant is an upcoming looter-shooter RPG from Nexon and one of the South Korean company&#x27;s first forays into the console market space. Due out this year, this free-to-play third-person multiplayer shooter is hoping to attract players within the Destiny 2 and Warframe community and newcomers alike. And after playing the game for a couple of hours, we&#x27;re inclined to believe Nexon is on to something here. 
Ahead of the game&#x27;s release, Game Informer editor Wesley LeBlanc traveled to Seoul, South Korea, to visit Nexon and speak to some of The First Descendant&#x27;s leads about what players can expect, its plans for the game after launch, and more. 
Check it out in Game Informer&#x27;s exclusive interview feature below:</span>

                              <span>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero’s latest trailer has unveiled fusion warriors for its roster. It also seems to tease another announcement on the horizon.
The trailer reveals the additions of Gotenks (the fusion of Goten and Trunks), Kefla (the fusion of Caulifla and Kale), Fused Zamasu, and Goku and Vegeta’s fusions, Vegito and Gogeta. Watch them trade blows in the trailer below: 


Since each fusion includes the fighters that make them up and their various transformations, the full list of characters joining the roster amounts to 21. Check them out below.

The trailer ends with a message serving as a classic callback to the anime that states, “Next time on Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero: Summer Game Fest 2024.” Could we be getting a release date at Geoff Keighley’s showcase? Given that the game was revealed during another Keighley show, The Game Awards 2023, it wouldn’t be surprising.
Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero is the next entry in what’s known in the West as the Budokai Tenkaichi series (Sparking is the franchise&#x27;s original Japanese name). The roster is only halfway revealed, but we’ve already seen a number of confirmed fighters from Dragon Ball Z and Dragon Ball Super, including multiple versions of the same characters. The game has no release window but is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. You can learn more about the game&#x27;s new mechanics and features here.</span>

Games inspired by The Legend of Zelda are common; after all, the long-running Nintendo franchise is among the most influential series in gaming history. Because of this, various games take the Zelda format and try to replicate it, but these homages often miss out on the magic that makes that series greater than the sum of its parts. This is particularly true in the indie space, with Zelda-inspired titles a dime a dozen, making it difficult to stand out from the crowd. Minishoot&#x27; Adventures clearly draws inspiration from Zelda – specifically A Link to the Past – but by applying…</span>

                              <span>PlayStation has reiterated its approach to releasing its games on PC, stating live-service games will launch day-and-date on PC. However, its tentpole single player games will not. 
This comes from one of PlayStation&#x27;s dual CEOs, Hermen Hulst, during a public business presentation held earlier this morning. During it, Hulst explained the strategy for releasing PlayStation&#x27;s single-player games on PC at a later date, rather than day-and-date, citing it&#x27;s part of a strategy to bring more people into the PlayStation platform. 


&quot;Indeed, we are bringing our titles to the PC platform, and we have a dual approach here,&quot; Hulst said. &quot;On the live service side, we are releasing our titles simultaneously, so day and date on PlayStation 5 and PC. But with our tentpole titles, our single player narra…</span>

                              <span>The PlayStation 5 generation is already Sony&#x27;s most profitable yet, the company has announced. In terms of numbers, the PS5 generation has already earned Sony $106 billion, according to a slide from its &quot;Game &amp; Network Services Segment&quot; presentation from PlayStation&#x27;s two new CEOs, Hideaki Nishino and Hermen Hulst. 
However, on that same slide, Sony shows that the PlayStation 4 generation earned $107 billion, which is obviously more than $106 billion. But, the reason Sony is calling the PS5 generation the most profitable one yet is because the PS4 generation is largely complete whereas the PS5 presumably still has years to go. Given it&#x27;s made $106 billion in roughly four years, it seems Sony is confident it will surpass $107 billion in the coming months or years. 
As for what Sony is including in its profits, it&#x27;s the entire gamut of the PS5 generation. This includes the PS5 console itself, associated hardware and accessories, and software, too. It also includes services, like PlayStation Plus, according to the presentation. 
One of the reasons the PS5 generation might be Sony&#x27;s most profitable yet is because even though the playerbase is as big as the PS4 – both are sitting at 49 million active consoles as of last month – PS5 players are playing significantly more on their console. The PS5 generation sits at 2.4 billion total gameplay hours while the PS4 sits at 1.4 billon. More playtime likely equates to more spending, which might be one of the reasons the PS5 generation is doing financially as well as it is. 
Life-to-date spending on the PS5 is also higher amongst players than the PS4, too. Across peripherals, services, content/add-ons, and content/full games, the PS4 life-to-date spend is $580 while PS5 players average $731.

                              <span>Netflix has announced a partnership with Mojang Studios to create a new animated series based on Minecraft. The news comes as part of a celebration of Minecraft’s 15th anniversary.
WildBrain, the studio behind other Netflix shows such as Sonic Prime, Ninjago: Dragons Rising, and Carmen Sandiego, is developing this CG-animated Minecraft show. Plot details are nonexistent, but a press release states the series will be &quot;showing the world of Minecraft in a new light&quot; and feature an original story with new characters.


This won&#x27;t be the only on-screen adaptation of the best-selling video game of all time. A live-action Minecraft movie is currently in production, with Jack Black confirmed to star as Steve.  
The Minecraft show, whatever it winds up being titled, has no premiere date. In the meantime, be sure to catch up on the other video game adaptations Netflix has on the way, including the first teaser for Season 4 of The Witcher (now starring Liam Hemsworth), the first trailer for Arcane Season 2, and the first look at the animated Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft starring Hayley Atwell.</span>

While this is bad news for the movie companies, a viable alternative appeared recently.

My personal reputation is great only among people who love mushrooms and hate deer. It&#x27;s been long enough that I should probably be a fierce warlord running a large chunk of the kingdom in opposition by now, but instead, I have the skillset of fifty peasants, and the outstanding work of fifty three. And I know why. Bellwright has taught me what I already knew in theory, but had not truly appreciated:
Good managers are rare and precious. And I&#x27;m not one of them.

Apple had just released their new electric barnacle scrubber, and sailors everywhere were trading sacks of freshly minted coins just for a solitary sweet sniff at one of the delightfully compact and sleekly designed charger cables. Of course, too-many-toes Jackson and myself had seen tell of this upcoming gold rush, written in crab trails on the sand, which is what we had instead of the stock market in them days.

                              <span>Kill Knight, the silly-named twin stick action game you may have caught at similarly silly-named event The Triple-I Initiative in April, is joining this year&#x27;s Steam next fest with a demo ahead of its expected release date later this year. I’ve played it, and I feel must apologise, Mr. Knight. I still think it&#x27;s a silly name, but with frantic flowing action this immediately gratifying, you can call yourself whatever your killy little heart so desires. For this knight is not like other knights: this is a knight who kills. Wait, they all do that? Oh. Well, this one has four guns. Suck it, literally every other knight.

                              <span>Destructive third-person action game Just Cause is getting made into a movie, produced by the men behind The Fall Guy and Nobody, according to the Hollywood Reporter. This isn&#x27;t the first time the over-the-top explode &#x27;em up has been in line to get the big screen treatment. Another version spent years in development hell until the rights lapsed. But it&#x27;s been picked up again by Universal, who are no strangers to turning video games into box office burger bucks (they did The Super Mario Bros. Movie). So, it might result in an actual movie this time.

                              <span>The demo for puzzle game Schim, in which you play as a boy and his frog that only exists in the shadows, is out now on Steam. I’ve given it a whirl, and its pretty froggin’ delightful. The game has you progress through different scenes set in a chill, colorful townscape. You can switch at any time between boy and frog. The boy can go anywhere, but is frequently blocked by environmental puzzles. The frog has the means to solve such puzzles, by hopping between shadows naturally cast by the environment. They act like little inky puddles, and simply jumping from one to the other is a rare joy.

                              <span>Understanding any given sentence in Wuthering Waves is like trying to discern sensible meaning from the back of a rain-bleached Doritos packet you found while cleaning your gutters. Last week, players of the character action gacha asked for more freedom to skip story scenes and dialogue. Having sunk a bunch of hours into the game, I can see why. The combat may be swish and the traversal across its rolling landscape flowing and carefree, but the lore-obsessed babble of its characters is mind-numbing.

                              <span>Readers, I appear to have locked myself in self-referential language matrix trying to describe the feeling of playing top-down action shooter Kickback. You can only move through the recoil from shooting, you see, which means facing the opposite way to where you want to go. It’s both  very counterintuitive and very fun. To call something both counterintuitive and fun seems, well, counterintuitive. But also: fun. Which, as a concept is very fun to think about. But, also, quite counterintuitive. Writing such a incredibly redundant paragraph is quite fun, even though I’m just repeating myself. Counterintuitive, right? I’m going to try to escape this paragraph now. If I manage it, I’ll see you in the one below.

                              <span>An Activision lawsuit targeting a group of Call of Duty cheat makers has ended with a $14.5m judgment in favor of the plaintiffs. The defendants, all linked to Germany-based EngineOwning UG, initially put up a spirited defense against alleged violations of the DMCA, Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and civil RICO, among others. By last summer, all defendants had disengaged from the legal process. At the time of writing, EngineOwning is selling its latest MWIII and Warzone cheat.

Last December, CCTV footage revealed a figure in black spray-painting the words &quot;free movie&quot; time and again. The damage to the culturally significant building was meant to advertise a pirate video site.

                              <span>Tavern Keeper has been kicking around for a good number of years now, as Game Dev Tycoon developers Greenheart Games polished up their charming mixture of Dungeons &amp; Dragons fantasy bartending with Theme Hospital-style sim management.

We still don’t know what the team’s new game is called or when it might hit the road, but we have been given a few more snippets of what to expect and news on who’ll be helping pump up its tires and fill it with fuel as publisher.

Each harvest, one villager must don the ceremonial, mildly magical mask, and enter the fields alone, to gather the precious life-giving ambrosia before the beast can befoul it. For five nights you must do battle, or evade its ravenous clutches.
Those of you who have known your own Devourer are surely thinking: Only five nights per year? Luxury. Harvest Hunt is good, though.

                              <span>Many moons ago, premiere wordsman Nate Crowley reviewed shark ‘em up Maneater, decrying its incurious perpetuation of anti-shark propaganda, and calling it “an ecstatically violent simulation of being a fool&#x27;s idea of a shark.” My own frothing penchant for the plan-schemes of Warhammer’s Skaven ratboys has been documented in these pages to the point of rabidity, but I do feel broadly similarly about media that sullies rats - clean, smart and good folk that they are. Lively tactics Trash Of The Titans does not aim to emancipate its villainous vermin. But, like Warhammer, it gets a pass for its evident affection towards its antagonistic dumpster diving scuttlers. Also, it&#x27;s just plain fun.

                              <span>A producer on Kerbal Space Program 2 has confirmed that those working on the space flight sim are being laid off en masse. We already knew that the developers at Intercept Games would be losing their jobs thanks to a closure announcement from Washington State. Until remarks from Strauss Zelnick, the CEO of Take-Two Interactive, muddied the waters. Zelnick refused to acknowledge that the studio was being closed when asked by a reporter, even going so far as to claim the opposite. &quot;We didn&#x27;t shutter those studios,&quot; he told IGN. But it seems clear from one producer&#x27;s testimony that Zelnick&#x27;s remarks are inaccurate.

                              <span>Mortal Kombat 1’s next superpowered guest fighter, The Boys’ Homelander, shows off his dominance in a new gameplay trailer. The less-than-heroic superhero becomes available for Kombat Pack owners on June 4 and for everyone else on June 11.
The patriotic and maniacal leader of The Seven shows no quarter to his new MK adversaries, obliterating them with an offensive style that is very reminiscent of Superman’s playstyle in the Injustice series. The trailer also shows off the new DLC Kameo fighter Ferra, the smaller, more feral half of the Ferra &amp; Torr team from Mortal Kombat X, who also joins the game sometime in June. 


Homelander joins Peacemaker, Invincible’s Omni-Man, Ermac, Quan-Chi, and the upcoming Takeda in the Year 1 DLC roster. Mortal Kombat 1 also has a story expansion on the way, but there’s still no word on what that will entail or when it will arrive.

XDefiant’s core modes offer temporarily fun stabs at the competitive multiplayer arena shooter, but Ubisoft’s latest attempt at carving out a slice of the lucrative esports pie feels half-baked. Core modes like its practice mode and ranked queue are gated off by construction tape at the time of writing. This leaves a bland battle pass with head-scratching progression decisions and standard weapon-based leveling systems as the only tangible means of rewarding you for playing the game or doing well beyond an individual match. And …</span>

                              <span>Hive Jump 2: Survivors arrives in Steam Early Access today. To celebrate, publisher Midwest Games and developer Graphite Lab have shared an exclusive trailer for the Survivors-like sequel. The first Hive Jump caught our eye way back in 2015 when we named it one of the most promising indie titles on display at PAX West that year before its launch in 2017. The original Hive Jump served as a four-player co-op homage to Super Metroid, but Hive Jump 2: Survivors takes inspiration from a different title: Vampire Survivors.
The genre, called &quot;bullet heaven,&quot; puts players in the shoes of a single character who eventually builds up to become extremely powerful as the waves of enemies grow more intense. Hive Jump 2: Survivors carries forward the look of its Metroidvania predecessor but from the genre-standard top-down perspective. You take control of a lone survivor of an alien attack who must now face seemingly insurmountable odds to survive. You can customize your loadout and upgrade your jetpack to destroy enemies and escape tough situations.
The jetpack also allows you to traverse the levels in ways not available in Vampire Survivors. The Jumpers have specific builds that allow you to cater to your play style, which combines with the upgrades you select before each run. You can play with auto-assist aiming or switch to manual controls. If you can survive 14 rounds, you can challenge big boss battles. As you collect goo from fallen enemies, you can earn better weapons, upgrades, and relics to improve your odds. Meanwhile, amber you find in the field can be traded for permanent upgrades to stats, magnets for auto-scavenging, or even screen-wiping nukes.
You can see an exclusive look at the Early Access launch trailer below.


Hive Jump 2: Survivors launches into Steam Early Access today. For more on the work produced by Graphite Lab, check out our review of their 2023 2D platformer, Mr. Run and Jump, here.</span>

Sony has no additional details, but Some PlayStation Studios developers we have not heard from in awhile include Asobi (Astro&#x27;s Playroom), Bend Studio (Days Gone), Bluepoint (Demon&#x27;s Souls remake) , Guerrilla (Horizon Zero Dawn), Housemarque (Returnal), Insomniac Games (Spider-Man), Naughty Dog (The Last of Us), Santa Monica Studio (God of War), and Sucker Punch (Ghost of Tsushima). There are more, but those are arguably the developers gamers would be most excited to receive updates from.
At the very, very least, I am hoping for an Astro Bot: Rescue Mission PlayStation VR2 port.</span>

With an art direction and gameplay heavily inspired by A Link to the Past, this fun homage is now available in Steam Early Access and gives players the tools to craft dungeons as clever or devious as they desire. Best of all, you can upload creations for other players to enjoy and experience the works of the community. Editors Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard do just that, exploring Marcus&#x27; custom dungeon to show off some of the game&#x27;s toolset before playing a (far superior) community creation.

                              <span>Cox Communications has filed its opening brief in a new appeal of the $1 billion piracy case. A jury previously held the Internet provider liable for the music piracy activities of its subscribers. After the trial, Cox learned that the music companies &#x27;concealed&#x27; key information about &#x27;destroyed&#x27; piracy evidence; this allegedly damaged the foundation of the landmark lawsuit.

                              <span>Billed as the most advanced anti-piracy system ever, Italy&#x27;s Piracy Shield had no chance of living up to the hype. It transpires that just eight weeks after its launch early February, top tier football league Serie A filed a complaint at an Italian court accusing Cloudflare of providing &quot;services to pirates&quot; that undermine Piracy Shield. In parallel, the system is already exceeding blocking limits agreed with ISPs. Now the law needs to be changed, so domains and IPs can be unblocked to free up capacity.

                              <span>I have played many a creepy throwback game that takes inspiration from the ever inadequately named &quot;Golden&quot; (Grimy and Diseased? Cadaverous, perhaps) Age of survival horror on PS1, but it&#x27;s rare you play one that invokes the N64, and even less often that you stumble on something horror-adjacent that riffs on Star Fox 64. Ah, Star Fox! The natural companion piece for, say, Eternal Darkness or The Suffering. In fairness, I did always find those Pez dispenser dialogue animations pretty eerie.

                              <span>To kick off with some extremely half-arsed mytho-geometry, the original Frostpunk was a testament to both the design utility and the inexhaustible political symbolism of circles. When people wish to found a community of equals they commonly form a circle, with each participant visible and audible to the rest. A circle is also the best shape for defending against an engulfing ambient threat such as a global ice age, because it has no weak points, and it makes a great centrepiece for a videogame interface, a symmetrical motif that can be tuned and adorned to either suck your attention into the screen or distribute it evenly in all directions.
Created by Polish developers 11 bit, Frostpunk takes place in the middle of a circle, an Arctic crater with a huge coal generator at its heart. Your city rises in rings around that generator, each additional layer of dwellings corresponding intuitively to decreasing temperature, and the result is one of the most focused and thematically consistent specimens of its genre - a building game that feels as intimate and urgent as tending a campfire. Frostpunk 2&#x27;s new campaign mode breaks the circle open. It starts where you (hopefully) ended, with the crater now fully colonised and evolved into a glaring, blue-orange geode of high-density housing and clustered chimneys. But the view has been pulled back, and construction now unfolds along the plains and canyons beyond the crater, which consist not of circles but of hexagons - another UI designer&#x27;s favourite - on which you&#x27;ll plot out upgradeable districts rather than assembling individual buildings.

                              <span>The first scene in RPS Game Club pick Deathbulge: Battle Of The Bands - a genuinely funny and innovative riff on turn-based RPGs -  sees candyfloss n’ superglue-haired guitarist Faye frantically search for her missing guitar as the crowd for the titular battle grow impatient. You’ll quickly realise this a school-with-no-trousers-esque dream sequence, but the matted mess of thick black cables that carpet this dingy side-stage is painfully accurate. Pissing around with gear is roughly 70% of the band experience, in my limited experience of being in bands. This probably changes when you’ve got roadies or dedicated tech people, but we did not, because we were skint. And also terrible. Several hours of Deathbulge has brought me more joy than several years of being in actual bands. I had some isolated good times in some of those bands, but I’m having a very good time with Deathbulge.

                              <span>A whopping 1000 corpses have been found in our ongoing investigation into Anthology of the Killer, Rock Paper Shotgun can reveal. The bodies were discovered in the aforementioned murder mystery &quot;video game&quot;, which is out now on itch.io. Following our previous reports we can confirm that exposure to the game&#x27;s crime-infested city can cause severe disorientation, confusion, uncontrolled fits of laughter, and moderate enlightenment. The streets here are so dense with crime that entire apartment blocks must shutter at night. When Rock Paper Shotgun reported the 1000 corpses to detectives, we were told this was &quot;normal&quot; and &quot;appropriate&quot;.

Sounds like a solid confirmation from me, though Microsoft and Activision have yet to start bellowing the news from any of Call of Duty’s official pulpits.

For anyone who hasn&#x27;t yet heard of the bright cyberpunk character action game, I guess now&#x27;s your chance to look at the slick anime visuals in the new trailer below and go &quot;hmmm&quot;, with either a songful note of eye-widening interest or the suspicious rumble of a free-to-play skeptic.

The claim was casually corroborated by trustworthy sort Andy Robinson of VGC. Note the wording here, which suggests a bundle package of sorts, similar to the rumoured original plan for the remakes of Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil 3.

Sometimes, it&#x27;s because those people have succeeded in levelling up out of games journalism, or found their way into another echelon of the craft. Other times, the losses are more abrupt and arbitrary. In each case, one short term response is intensification. Those of us who remain must be rockier, paperier and more shotgun than ever before.

It’s only a matter of time before IllFonic perfects the asymmetrical multiplayer experience. Say what you will about its previous games; each one offered entertaining tweaks to the formula, small yet clever innovations, and a seemingly better understanding of what makes this genre so compelling. Killer Klowns From Outer Space: The Game embodies all these aspects, making it one of IllFonic’s best asymmetric games yet.
Killer Klowns From Outer Space: The Game offers a familiar gameplay loop for the genre. Seven human players must quick…</span>

                              <span>Tekken 8’s second DLC fighter, Lidia Sobieska, returns to action in her first gameplay trailer. The Polish politician and karate master will bolster the roster this summer.
First introduced as a DLC fighter in Tekken 7: Fated Retribution, Lidia is the prime minister of Poland and a practitioner of traditional karate. The formal and proud fighter clashes with fellow karate practisioner Jin Kazama in the trailer and humbles the arrogant Reina by dishing out her new Rage Art. 


Lidia follows on the heels of Eddy Gordo as the two revealed Year 1 season pass fighters. Owners of Tekken 8’s Deluxe, Ultimate, or Collector&#x27;s Editions automatically receive these fighters. Each can also be purchased individually for $7.99. Two more fighters remain in the Year 1 pass, who will be added during the fall and winter

These versions sometimes feature alternate art, have a gold embossed logo on the front, are individually numbered, and feature higher-quality paper.

                              <span>One of the biggest reasons Xbox acquired Activision Blizzard was for the Call of Duty series, a first-person shooter that has dominated the best-selling games list for decades. This would make it the perfect candidate to launch on Xbox Game Pass, Microsoft&#x27;s gaming subscription service, in order to bring new subscribers in. Black Ops 6 was officially revealed last week, and while it was reported to be in consideration for a Game Pass launch, today, the news was confirmed from Xbox itself. Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will launch on Game Pass day one.
We don&#x27;t know much about the game yet, but two live-action teasers have been released so far. The first features a group of people covering the faces of Mount Rushmore with blindfolds that say, &quot;The truth lies.&quot; The second, released today, can be seen below.


It features world leaders&#x27; black and white camera footage speaking in hushed tones about a grand conspiracy about manufactured wars and the elusive nature of the truth. The trailer ends with the game&#x27;s full title, along with a reminder that the full reveal will come on June 9, after Xbox&#x27;s summer showcase.

                              <span>Lego has pulled the curtain back on its new playset based on The Legend of Zelda. The 2-in-1 aims to satisfy both old-school and new-school fans and is set to go on sale in January.
The 2,500-piece set lets owners build two scenes modeled after the Great Deku Tree from Ocarina of Time and Breath of the Wild. In terms of characters, it includes both games&#x27; versions of Link, BOTW Zelda, and the maraca-shaking Hestu. Smaller details include the cooking pot, a Skulltula, treasure chests, and a Korok tucked away on the treetop.

The Great Deku Tree 2-in-1 costs $299.99 and can be pre-ordered now on Lego&#x27;s website. It will arrive in stores on January 9, 2025. It joins other sets based on Nintendo properties such as Animal Crossing, Donkey Kong, and Mario.</span>

                              <span>Konami revealed it is holding another Silent Hill Transmission event on May 30 at 4 P.M. PDT. The last Silent Hill Transmission happened in 2022 and revealed a surprising amount of Silent Hill news including the reveal of the remake of Silent Hill 2, Silent Hill f, a new Silent Hill movie, and more.
The post announcing the event reads, &quot;Consider this your invitation letter to Silent Hill. ✉️ Tune in May 30 at 4 p.m. PDT to our SILENT HILL YouTube channel for the second installment of the #SILENTHILL Transmission where we&#x27;ll share game updates, a deeper look at the film, and new merch.&quot;
The safe bet is a teaser trailer for the movie and hopefully new details about the Silent Hill 2 remake and Silent Hill f, the latter of which seems like the franchise&#x27;s next big original entry. Silent Hill Ascension, the online mobile narrative game where players dictated the story choices, also finished up its first season (though the developer may have a different term for it), so it&#x27;s possible we may learn what&#x27;s next for that game.</span>

It would be another nine years before Expend4bles shook things up with a new title format but little else had changed. Expendables movies come with a three-point guarantee: lots of explosions, a solid 6/10 aggregate score on the Internet Movie Database, and thousands of people being monitored on BitTorrent so they can be sued at a later date. Almost 3,000 now face action in Canada&#x27;s Federal Court.

                              <span>It’s been three years to the day since we learned that Square Enix planned to remake Dragon Quest 3, unveiling a revamping of the seminal 1988 JRPG in Octopath Traveler’s HD-2D engine. Three years have passed since then, but we’ve finally had an update on the remake - and it’s raised a few questions, to say the least.

                              <span>The next Doom game - the first new instalment in over four years, after Doom Eternal - is reportedly taking a leaf out of Evil Dead: Army of Darkness’ necronomicon by transporting the Doom Slayer back to a medieval world to presumably battle hellspawn. According to a new report, it’s subtitled The Dark Ages and we’ll get an official reveal next week.

                              <span>The director of Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 and CEO of developers Larian has revealed that the studio experienced crunch in order to get the sprawling Dungeons &amp; Dragons CRPG finished. While Swen Vincke admitted that “it would be a lie to say that we didn&#x27;t [crunch]”, he insisted that it was less than on past Larian games such as Divinity, staff were paid for the overtime and it seemingly didn’t go as far as working late nights or weekends (for the most part, anyway).

If you were hoping to task your descendants with continuing your quest to get all 1,700-plus achievements in Tales of Maj&#x27;Eyal or maintain your ranked leaderboard position in Dota 2, bad news: it turns out that you can’t pass on your Steam library after you die.

                              <span>A Seattle jury has issued a landmark verdict following the legal battle between &#x27;Destiny 2&#x27; creator Bungie and cheat seller AimJunkies. The &#x27;cheat&#x27; company and its three owners are liable for copyright infringement and must pay damages to Bungie. The same applies to an independent cheat developer whose counterclaim, alleging that Bungie &#x27;hacked&#x27; his computer, was denied.

The captivating, combat-free Metroidvania is rich with a delectable buffet of challenges, puzzles and secrets to find even once you’ve seen the credits roll. Still, players have chewed their way through its more-ish platforming and puzzle-solving much faster than its solo developer intended, it turns out.

                              <span>We&#x27;ve known for some time that Fallout was coming to Fortnite, we just weren&#x27;t entirely sure in what capacity. Well, now we know that this season&#x27;s wasteland offerings take the form of a sort of Mad Max meets Fallout meets Borderlands- battle royale affair. There&#x27;s a big emphasis on deserts and vehicles, basically, with highlights including: mechanical fists, turrets on cars, and the possibility of manning one of two War Buses that patrol the reworked map.

                              <span>Calling it now: this is the least intriguing article you will read about 11 bit&#x27;s The Alters, a blend of Danny Boyle&#x27;s Sunshine and Duncan Jones&#x27;s Moon in which (deep breath) you are a marooned space engineer who must spawn different versions of himself by means of backstory-branching gadgetry in order to operate an enormous, rolling base and escape the apocalyptic rays of the local sun. 


We&#x27;re not going to talk about any of that hoity-toity quantum wheeling-and-dealing in this piece, however. We&#x27;re going to talk about the fact that the opening stretch reminded me of Gears Of War and the many over-the-shoulder adventures it has influenced. I&#x27;m sorry. It&#x27;s been a complicated week involving minimal sleep, and I no longer have the grey cells for branching timelines, though they are certainly the more fascinating aspect of this game.

                              <span>In one of the better gaming trends of the last few years, we appear to have entered a golden age for booting the crud out of doors. There’s Deathbulge of course, but also the upcoming Anger Foot, Abiotic Factor, and a load more I’m sure. There was also literally Door Kickers, but that was ages ago. Anyway, the latest game to put a hinge-disrespecting protagonist front and center is also my current obsession: the excellent Post Void/Hotline Miami-type beat, Mullet Mad Jack. It’s a very fast, very silly FPS about shooting robot billionaires that takes its aesthetic from 80’s anime and PC-98 games. I’m not sure what else you need, honestly.

                              <span>I cannot compare my experience of writing a review for The Splintered Sea, the first paid expansion for dastardly clever physics puzzle builder Besiege, to that of a journaling sailor facing lethal storms on the horizon. Still, if we take for granted the idea that a review is only really valuable as an insight into the experience of the player: I haven’t been feeling especially great this week. That in mind: Splintered Sea is more Besiege, thoughtfully applied to its already expansive toolkit. More importantly, it&#x27;s currently bringing me deep and deeply needed moments of untainted, childlike, vaguely-Orkish joy.

I’m usually a lot more suspicious of hardware leaks, which are often just out-of-date or otherwise inaccurate info, but I’ve also sat through enough mic-muted prebriefings to know an official slideshow when I see one, and that appears to be exactly what Videocardz got its hands on. Besides, these specs include a gigantic 80Whr battery upgrade (doubling the ROG Ally’s 40Whr capacity), so we can at least file this under &quot;News James wants to be true.&quot;

There’s usually at least a few game announcements in there, and this year was a bumper. The headline announcement being an upcoming sequel to well-loved space-pope turn-based strategy Warhammer 40,000: Mechanicus. Yes, yes. I’m getting to the dog.

                              <span>Videogames and especially role-playing games are chock-full of sheltered upbringings that go tits up. Innocent times and places like the prologue for Baldur&#x27;s Gate, which unfolds in the vast, fortified monastery of Candlekeep (beware spoilers from this point on).
BioWare&#x27;s first ever RPG opens with your unsuspecting Chosen One learning the ropes from the old sage Gorion. There are fetchquests that take you around the enormous citadel, bits of combat training to do, cosy formative chinwags to have with characters like your childhood friend Imoen. But it&#x27;s not to last, of course: Gorion is murdered, and you must rove the Sword Coast in pursuit of his killer. When you return to Candlekeep later in the game, this once-proud bastion of learning has been filled with doppelgangers of Gorion and other acquaintances, a parade of chatbots waiting to stab you in the back.

                              <span>While I’ve always thought the race towards graphical hyperrealism isn’t as pervasive as it&#x27;s often perceived, Senua&#x27;s Saga: Hellblade 2 is definitely one of those games. The kind that probably has twelve artists dedicated to the recreation of visible pores, that sort of thing. It’s so focused on looking pretty that it hasn’t even noticed the title and subtitle got mixed up.
Sure enough, Hellblade 2 is a harsh test for older hardware, with a heavy reliance on DLSS or FSR upscaling to keep performance sweet. That said, it’s no Dragons Dogma 2-style technical horrorshow either. A happy balance of visuals and smoothness is attainable on plush PCs and low-end laptops alike, while DLSS 3 frame generation can deliver an effective kick in the framerate pants on RTX 40 series GPUs.

                              <span>In Anthology of the Killer you do not exit the game using a pause menu. You exit it by walking down a back alley into the quavering arms of two hungry bears. This is just one of many laughs your diaphragm will endure as you navigate &quot;the escalating adventures of a girl trying to make zines in a town of giallo-style masked serial murderers&quot;. The horror comedy already won its creators the Nuovo Award at the Independent Games Festival this year, recognition that has been a long time coming for prolific game maker Stephen &quot;thecatamites&quot; Gillmurphy. If you&#x27;re unfamiliar with his work, you can get acquainted next week, when Anthology of the Killer gets its full release on Itch.io on May 28th.  At which point you can explore its unsettling urban hell of shady corporations and cops who think they&#x27;re cool. There&#x27;s a trailer below.

While its Epic Games Store release can be worked around, and Proton GE will get the game’s own launcher running, no combination of software, compatibility tools, or installation folder deep-diving seems capable of actually booting the game proper.
As such, I’m accepting defeat. Obviously with apologies to any studious Steam Deck Academy readers.

With the decision to pull the game from sale and turn off its servers for months on end after allowing people to sink their real-life money into unlocking costumes and such (with no refunds), its developers are now looking to seemingly give something back in return.

                              <span>The classic anime series Gundam examines the traumatic experience of war, particularly the unalterable effect it has on those young soldiers forced to participate in the horrors of fighting for their life while taking the lives of others using weapons of inhuman strength and devastation. Which clearly makes it the perfect fit for a bit of upcoming DLC for military-fetishising interactive gun range Call of Duty.

                              <span>In a twist of fate I&#x27;ve mentioned in some recent Destiny 2 news posts, I am fully back into Destiny. Former vidbud Liam and I used it, initially, as something we could do while catching up on life. But now? Now we&#x27;re all in. Liam has created a spreadsheet of things we&#x27;re ticking off to prepare for the upcoming expansion, and I think it&#x27;s the perfect summation of what the game is to us: something that makes no sense at all and yet something that makes our brains hum with happiness.
And what we&#x27;ve found with Destiny, in all of its bloat, is that we haven&#x27;t explored for a single second since our return. Everything is accomplished through menus, making it quite Starfield-esque, which is terrible… but also good. We can&#x27;t make sense of it and we don&#x27;t think we ever will.
