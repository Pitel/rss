                              <span>There&#x27;s no question that Sephiroth is an icon, striking fear into players even remotely familiar with the villain. Just the opening notes of his theme song, One Winged Angel, are enough to get the heart racing. But Sephiroth didn&#x27;t make a name for himself with Final Fantasy alone. A particular Disney and Square Enix collaboration, Kingdom Hearts, introduced the villain to a new era of fans, and his appearances in that series are just as menacing, if not more so, than his Final Fantasy 7 presence.


If players missed out on Sephiroth&#x27;s 1997 Final Fantasy 7 debut, it might be hard to discern why fans go gaga over the character. Heralding a planet-ending event and haunting protagonist Cloud Strife throughout FF7, Sephiroth presented himself as a fearsome villain from the get-go. However, for …</span>

                              <span>Helldivers 2 received patch 1.000.103 today to the delight of mech fans. But hours later, the team snuck out a fix for something that has been a thorn in the side of the community. For those wanting to invite cross-platform friends, a new fix for Helldivers 2 has arrived.


The cross-platform friend invite fix was announced on the official Helldivers 2 Discord sometime after the big patch went live. According to Arrowhead Games&#x27; community lead, Katherine Baskin, the patch was applied directly to the game&#x27;s backend. You probably didn&#x27;t even notice. The fix addresses three major issues (emphasis Baskin):

However, the game makes it quite challenging to understand what some of them do. This is truest with the Localization Confusion Booster, an item that barely explains what benefits it offers, so you&#x27;ve got to work out what to do with it yourself.

How to whisper in Minecraft

You are able to chat anytime and on any platform in Minecraft by pressing the T key on your keyboard on PC to bring up the text chat box or by pressing right on the D-Pad for controller users. This will bring up the chat box, where you are able to type out whatever message you want to send. However, these messages will be public to everyone on the server unless you whisper.

                              <span>Concrete is one of the most valuable materials in Minecraft due to its sturdy nature and customizability. Unlike other objects like cobblestone and dirt, though, this isn’t something players can just gather and immediately start using. Players have to make concrete in Minecraft if they want to use it, but this is certainly worth the effort.

How to make concrete


The recipe to make concrete in Minecraft is one of the simplest in the game. You just need the following two ingredients to make it: 



4 sand


4 gravel


1 dye item



Both of these items are quite easy to find in the world. Sand is one you can often find near the surface level next to water locations, such as rivers, lakes, and oceans. On the other hand, gravel is also easily found in the first f…</span>

In my review for 2016’s Hyper Light Drifter I wrote about how it was a game I created excuses for myself to keep playing after seeing credits writing, “I didn’t do it out of necessity; I did it because I wanted to stay in Hyper Light Drifter’s world for as long as possible.” I love the color, style, music, and overall vibe of that game, which is why I was so excited to finally go hands-on with its not-quite-a-sequel, Breaker, and finally have an excuse to exist in that world again.


“It’s not a sequel – it is just in the world of Hyper Light. It will have common threads, themes, and shared components,” director Alx Preston says. “If you played Drifter you will see reappearin…</span>

                              <span>Hyper Light Breaker is not a sequel to Hyper Light Drifter in the traditional sense, but it does take place in the same world, which is all we needed to hear to be excited. While this isn&#x27;t gameplay footage of me playing the game, I did get a chance to play the game recently, so Marcus Stewart and I decided to get together and chat about his time playing the game.
Hyper Light Breaker is entering early access on PC some time this year. For more on my time playing the game, you can read my full Hyper Light Breaker preview here.

                              <span>Skydance New Media’s mysterious World War 2 Marvel game has a title: Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra. It also has its first trailer and a release window.
First announced in 2022, the game stars Captain America and Black Panther Azzuri, who is the grandfather of T’Challa. The trailer shows them pursuing the mutual goal of taking down the Nazis/Hydra, though for their own personal reasons. Hailing from different worlds, neither is particularly fond of the other&#x27;s methods, which draws them into conflict. The game also stars Gabriel Jones of the Howling Commandos and Wakanda spy leader Nanali. First revealed at GDC, check out its first cinematic trailer below. 


Marvel 1943 is a linear single-player experience where you’ll occupy the roles of all four characters at various points, providing different perspectives on the narrative and the war. The project is led by Skydance president Amy Hennig, best known as the principle writer of the Uncharted franchise. 
Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra is coming in 2025, though platforms are currently unknown. You can learn more about how Skydance is approaching the game’s storytelling by reading our 2022 interview feature with Amy Hennig and Skydance&#x27;s story consultant, Marc Bernardin.</span>

Creating a sequel to a 12-year-old game is never an easy task. Recapturing the magic of the original while implementing modern technology and design strategies can mangle the core values that made the original special. Dragon’s Dogma 2 never loses sight of its roots, and constantly finds big and small ways to surprise me even 50 hours in. At its core, Dragon’s Dogma 2 captures a sense of adventure. While you’re the center point of the conflict and strife in the world, Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 isn’t afraid to make you feel small. Around every bend, it…</span>

                              <span>Dragon Ball Sparking Zero had a big coming out party in the form of a 13-minute gameplay presentation that gave fans a nice look at its moment-to-moment combat. Bandai Namco showed off what&#x27;s new, what&#x27;s staying the same, and even revealed more characters joining the roster. 
Naturally, Goku and Vegeta square off to show off Sparking Zero’s combat. The 3D fighter retains the familiar behind-the-back style of its predecessors, but graphically speaking, the flashy ki blasts and transformations look better than ever. 


The presentation introduces four new mechanics. First up is Skill Count, a number that rises as you execute moves during the battle and is then spent to trigger special abilities. Revenge Counter lets players retaliate with a big attack in the midst of absorbing damage. Super Perception is a parry-type move that lets players deflect an attack at the last moment (such as Goku smacking away Vegeta’s Galick Gun), but doing this spends Skill Count points. Lastly, Vanishing Assaults are teleport-based attacks designed to close the gap at mid-range to keep the pressure on your opponent.
Dragon Ball Sparking Zero looks to have a massive roster of fighters (many of them variations of Goku and Vegeta), and the following characters are joining the line-up:
Broly (Super Saiyan Full Power)
Burter
Dyspo
Hit
Jeice
Kakunsa
Kale (Super Saiyan Berserk)
Master Roshi (Max Power)
Nappa
Super Trunks
Toppo

Dragon Ball Sparking Zero still doesn’t have a release window, but it’s coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</span>

                              <span>The second season of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 and Warzone is underway. As we make our way through the weekly updates and new content drops, the end of the season is quickly approaching. Many look forward to the new content that&#x27;ll come with season 3. Additionally, you&#x27;ll need to finish the Season 2 battle pass before it&#x27;s over.


Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 and Warzone Season 2 end date


According to the in-game timer shown while playing Modern Warfare 3, Season 2 will officially end on April 2, 2024. As a result, there are a few weeks remaining for you to complete the battle pass. Depending on the amount of time you have to play the game, it&#x27;s definitely possible to move through the many seasonal rewards by then. Additionally, there are a number of weekly challenges available from the start of the Season, and a few more to unlock as we enter new weeks.


It&#x27;s worth completing the weekly challenges if you&#x27;re interested in the end-of-season rewards. For example, finishing five weekly challenges for every week of Season 2 gets you the Rotten Inferno weapon camo. As you likely already know, progressing through the battle pass (if you purchased it) gets you all the rewards you see contained in it. A number of which are decent character skins and cool weapon blueprints, if you&#x27;re into that sort of thing.


Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 and Warzone developers have not made any official announcements about season 3 content yet. More information about the seasonal patch and new content will be revealed in the upcoming weeks.

The Slammer is a new Stasis Vortex Frame sword that released alongside the weekly reset on March 19.

Nightfall Strikes are a variant of the regular Strikes in Destiny 2, offering increasing challenges and rewards. There are four difficulties for Nightfalls, going from Heroic to Legendary to Master and then to Grandmaster.

                              <span>Nearly two years after the project was teased, Skydance New Media and Marvel have fully unveiled its upcoming game starring Black Panther and Captain America. Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra was revealed in a story trailer, along with its release year. 


Coming from Amy Hennig&#x27;s studio, Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra follows the Captain and Black Panther in an adventure set during World War II. 


The game is powered by Unreal Engine 5. And if the trailer itself is any indication, it&#x27;ll look quite fabulous indeed. We witness an occupied Paris in the winter as snow gently falls on the rooftops that Azzuri, the WWII-era Black Panther, scampers over. The game art suggests we may visit Wakanda as well. There are hints of action and stealth in the video, but let&#x27;s not gloss over the storytelling.

Cement comes into play both for creating Pal Spheres and when you start wanting to make Stone structures and defenses around your base. There is no way to gather Cement from nodes around the map, but it can be made relatively easily on your base and you don’t need particularly heavy duty equipment, either.

While this sounds simple, creating the smoker requires three jellies that are surprisingly challenging to find. Here&#x27;s how to get River, Sea, and Cave Jelly in Stardew Valley.


How to get River Jelly in Stardew Valley


You can find River Jelly by fishing in the Mountain Lake in front of the cave mine entrance. While you&#x27;ll frequently find fish like largemouth bass and rainbow trout here, you have low odds of obtaining the River Jelly. The jelly appears as a green blob, differentiating it from fish and trash.

                              <span>One of the new things added into Stardew Valley with the 1.6 update is the Mastery System, which sees you using your EXP to unlock special items. Each category has its own items, but through the Foraging Mastery you can get the recipe for a Mystic Tree Seed.


The Mystic Tree Seed can be planted to grow a ‘special tree’ that can be tapped, using the Tapper, to get Mystic Syrup. The Syrup sells for 1000 Gold, so it’s worth getting if you want to make some money. 


How to get the Mystic Tree Seed recipe

You’ll need to fill up your exp bar in order to purchase a Mastery and each Mastery costs 5,000 more exp than the one before it, so if you’re aiming to unlock the Mystic Tree Seed recipe then I’d recommend choosing Foraging as your first Mastery. As well as the Seed recipe, you also get a Treasure Totem recipe and the ability to find Golden treasure boxes, so it’s well worth it.


To increase your exp, simply play the game; everything provides exp, from planting to battling within the Miines, so you’ll soon get enough exp to purchase a Mastery.

To craft a Mystic Tree Seed, you’ll need some other tree seeds:



5 Acorn Seeds


5 Maple Seeds


5 Pine Cones


5 Mahogany Seeds



Once you’ve combined these Seeds, you can plant your tree and wait for it to mature, then use the Tapper to get that liquid gold.

You get new weapons in Helldivers 2 by unlocking them in the Warbonds — the game&#x27;s take on the Battle Pass. To find said Warbonds, you must open up the &#x27;Acquisition Center&#x27; while in your Super Destroyer ship and enter the &#x27;Warbonds&#x27; tab. You typically start there anyway, so it&#x27;s quick to locate. Open up the Warbond to check out all the unlockable items, which range from capes to guns. There is, however, one crucial step you need to complete before you can start expanding your arsenal.

                              <span>Stardew Valley 1.6 added four new seed types and vegetables for you to farm, with Summer Squash being the Summer season&#x27;s variant. However, while you can easily purchase crops like parsnips and potatoes for Pierre&#x27;s shop, the same can&#x27;t be said for these four new ones. Here&#x27;s how to find Summer Squash in Stardew Valley.


Where to find Summer Squash seeds in Stardew Valley


You can find Summer Squash seeds by digging grass and artifact spots during Summer. While regular dig spots have higher odds of dropping artifacts and books, grass tufts frequently drop seeds. You can harvest artifact and grass spots using a hoe to obtain one or two seeds.

While artifact spots appear as worms coming out of the ground, grass spots look like blades of green grass flowing in the wind. They can appear anywhere on the map, including all terrain types, but I&#x27;ve had the best luck spotting them in the Secret Forest. Nonetheless, you can encounter them anywhere, particularly along the paths leading to the mountains and through the bus stop route.


After obtaining your Summer Squash seeds, you can grow them after tending to the crop for six in-game days. Since it&#x27;s a Summer crop, you&#x27;ll have to plant it during this season, or else the plant will die. Unlike crops like Powdermelon, Summer Squash continues to produce after its first harvest, so your best bet is farming for seeds within the first few days of the season to get the most out of your plants. 


After growing your first Summer Squash, you can use the seed maker to gain more seeds. That way, you don&#x27;t have to return to the forest or mountains to search for more grass spots. Alternatively, you can sell them to make money, stick the squash in a preserves jar, or eat them raw to regain energy.

However, it&#x27;s a little tricky figuring out how to get there. Here&#x27;s how to get to Varlamore in Old School Runescape including the prerequisites to access the area.




How to get to Varlamore


In order to get to Varlamore in Old School Runescape, you need to head outside the East Varrock gate and speak to an NPC named Regulus Cento. Speaking to Regulus Cento will give you the option to venture to Varlamore via his Quetzal named Primio. However, before you can access Primio, you first need to unlock Varlamore by completing the Children of the Sun quest.

If you watch the Weather Report on TV the day before, you’ll see that something strange is coming - this means green rain, and it’s a very useful, albeit slightly disconcerting, weather condition. 


If you go to the Tavern on a green rain day, you’ll also encounter a lot of Villagers who have sheltered here in panic. It’s an excellent opportunity to get your daily interactions in, increasing your friendships. On another, slightly ominous note, if you talk to the Wizard on a green rain day, he will tell you he has ‘special matters to attend to’.

Carrots aren’t worth much, selling for between 35 and 70 Gold depending on their quality level, but they are good for keeping your energy up, especially early into a new playthrough. Carrots provide 75 energy at a base level, increasing at higher quality levels. Carrots are a Spring crop, take three days to grow, and provide one Carrot per seed.


The best and easiest way to get Carrot Seeds is from the Raccoon’s wife, once she arrives. She sells all four of the new crops in exchange for the kind of thing you’d expect Racoons to love. Unfortuna…</span>

                              <span>While exploring the Mines in Stardew Valley, you might come across something called a Trinket. There are a number of new Trinkets that have been added with the 1.6 update, including some very useful ones to aid you during combat. One of them is the Fairy Box. 


Trinkets are akin to having Summoning powers, calling useful beings to your side who will aid you during battle within the Mines. This particular Trinket, the Fairy Box, will heal you if your health begins to drop and that can be incredibly useful, particularly at deeper levels of the Mines. 


How to get the Fairy Box

The Fairy Box, along with other Trinkets, is obtained by defeating enemies within the Mines. It doesn’t seem to matter which mobs you are taking down, I’ve received Trinkets by defeating everything from Slimes to Shadow Brutes. Each Trinket has a unique ability, but the Fairy Box’s healing ability makes it the best for diving deep into the Mines. 


How to equip the Fairy Box

As with all Trinkets, you equip a Fairy Box simply by placing it into the star slot within your inventory (the top one on the Right side of your character portrait). Once you’ve equipped it, you’ll find a Fairy following you, boosting your health if it starts to dip. 


I would recommend not relying on the Fairy Box to sustain you alone — you should still take food and medicines with you if you want to survive against large mobs.

                              <span>Minecraft is a massive survival crafting game that is one of the best-selling video games of all time. Given the title’s widespread availability on essentially every modern platform, some players might want to know about Minecraft cross-platform functionality. But with Microsoft’s ownership of the title, does it have cross-play?

Is Minecraft cross-platform?


Yes, Minecraft is fully cross-platform if you are playing the Bedrock Edition of the game. If you are playing Java Edition or any other version of the title, it is not cross-platform. But as long as you have the most recent updated version of Bedrock Edition, you are able to play the game fully cross-platform no matter which system you are on and what your friends are on.

Here is how to update Stardew Valley mods easily so you do not disrupt your game in any way.


Easiest way to update Stardew Valley Mods


The absolute easiest way to update mods in Stardew Valley is by using SMAPI, a Stardew Valley mod loader.SMAPI can be downloaded here, and is compatible with all PC versions of the game including Steam and GOG. It&#x27;s also useable on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

Notably, even though Helldivers 2&#x27;s exosuit mechs were a hotly anticipated addition ahead of their bombastic release, they proved to be fairly fragile in the grand scheme of things. Things have been so bad that despite the mechs&#x27; extremely destructive capabilities, players have been mocking their cardboard-tier defenses. This problem was exacerbated further by an issue with the mechs&#x27; rocket pods, wherein turning too quickly and firing a missile off would insta-gib the mech and the poor Helldiver c…</span>

How to get Mastery Points in Stardew Valley


Unlocking Mastery points requires maxing all five of your skills to level ten. Once you reach level ten in all five skills and claim your last few perk points, you&#x27;ll find the Mastery level bar with a hefty experience requirement in your skills menu. You&#x27;ll gain Mastery progress by gaining experience through your skills and reading skill books for experience points.

According to a report from IGN, Bungie&#x27;s shakeup goes further into more than just Destiny. In a leadership change, Marathon&#x27;s creative leadership, specifically game director Christopher Barret, is being replaced by former Valorant director Joe Ziegler.

                              <span>After over a decade, the sequel to one of the more unique open-world RPGs is finally here. With just over 40 hours in the world of Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 so far, I feel like I&#x27;ve barely scratched the surface. 


If you&#x27;ve played the original Dragon&#x27;s Dogma, surely you can understand the sentiment here. Every day I&#x27;ve played DD2 I&#x27;ve fully intended to focus on the main storyline. But life is not that simple, and every single time I&#x27;ve found myself ending the day halfway across the map, deep in a cave wondering how I got there


Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 doesn&#x27;t reinvent the wheel that the original already reinvented. Sure, there&#x27;s some new features and content in this sequel.

This system helps you get useful tools and perks to double farm animal production, smelt faster, and more, making it worthwhile to invest in. Here&#x27;s how to get the Iridium Scythe in Stardew Valley.


How to get the Iridium Scythe in Stardew Valley


The Iridium Scythe is a reward for redeeming Farming Mastery in Grandpa&#x27;s Secret Room. You&#x27;ll find the secret room in Cindersap Forest and gain access to it after obtaining your first mastery point.

                              <span>When news of Dragon Ball creator Akira Toriyama’s sudden passing hit social media, I found myself staring at a black-and-white photograph of the legendary artist.

                              <span>We’ve known that a Marvel game from former Uncharted writer-director Amy Hennig has been in the works for years, learning in 2022 that it will focus on Captain America and Black Panther during World War 2. Thanks to a proper reveal during today’s State of Unreal event, we now know that it’ll be called Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra and we’ll be able to play it sometime in 2025.

                              <span>This article&#x27;s headline is the characterisation of Everdeep Aurora given to me by publisher Ysbryd Games, but bizarrely enough, it reminded me initially of Bloodborne. A 2D platformer from Nautilus Games, Everdeep Aurora begins on the surface, where a ruptured crimson moon fills the sky with blazing meteors. That menacing moon is the first hint of Bloodborne, obviously. The second is the lamp-lit, locked-up house to one side, whose unseen occupant tells you to get lost, adding that they don’t believe all this crazy talk about the apocalypse. 


I thought at once of the wealthier residents of Yharnam, feasting and laughing hysterically behind the shutters of their fancy townhouses on the night of the Hunt. There are no pitchfork-wielding mobs or werewolves stalking the vicinity, however. But there is a frog by a campfire, who tells you that everybody else has sought shelter underground, and hands you a drill so you can follow them.

Only its high price remains an ongoing concern, though the Amazon Spring Deal Days sale (that’s the Amazon Big Spring Sale to US folk) can at least take some of the sting out of upgrading. There are, while they last, cut-price RTX 4060 Ti models up for grabs on both sides of the pond.

It’s far from the only criticism people have of this new technology, which might make us wonder exactly why anyone wants it in the first place. Today, I’d like to talk about some of the brighter futures that might come out of generative AI for us, as well as why the path toward them might be a tricky one to walk cleanly.

                              <span>My time with Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 for review was neat, mainly because it&#x27;s a good video game and an anecdote generator. But it reinforced one thing for me that I&#x27;ve increasingly come to realise about myself: I actually can&#x27;t cope with character creators that let you like, tweak the finest details. I do not want to define the curls of each individual nose hair or adjust the angle of the mole on one&#x27;s forehead. I&#x27;m far too indecisive for any of this! Let me roll the dice, please.

So it is with the Intel Core i5-12400F: this was a great-value midranger when it was new, and now you get it at a true budget-tier price of £108.

                              <span>Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 is an RPG of many admirable qualities. I’m especially attached to my Arisen’s current pair of Pawns, one of whom speaks with the wonderfully stretched intonations of a pitch-shifted Matt Berry. Sadly, none of its achievements pertain to technical fidelity. While decent-looking, Dragon’s Dogma 2 takes some serious hardware to maintain consistently smooth performance, with lowered quality settings lending only the most limp-wristed of helping hands.
DLSS and FSR 3 upscaling are more effective, but this is one game where powering through the worst of its stuttering and framerate drops will take more than a musclebound graphics card. Not for the first time with an RE Engine game, Dragon’s Dogma 2 appears severely CPU-limited, so it really does demand a fully-upgraded rig to ward off sluggishness – especially at higher resolutions.
Improving performance isn’t a completely hopeless endeavour, but besides the FPS wobbles, there are some settings oddities that need navigating as well. I’ll cover all that and more in this guide; even if we can’t fix Dragon’s Dogma 2 ourselves, at least we can better understand its strangeness.

                              <span>You know when you remember a game really fondly and instead of ageing alongside you, it becomes more modern in memory? The Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 experience is, essentially, how I remember its predecessor Dragon&#x27;s Dogma: Dark Arisen. To me, DD2 feels like a remaster of the first, except it looks nicer, is more expansive, and features some rejigs to things like your AI pals.
Not that any of this is a bad thing! In fact, DD2&#x27;s closeness to the original makes it just as much of a joy as the first, where your grand adventure isn&#x27;t only grander, it&#x27;s still at the whims of a world governed by chaotic physics and the passage of time. Quirks remain, for good and bad, but ultimately this is an RPG where you make travel plans and the game does it best to dash them. It never gets old.

                              <span>It&#x27;s deeply frustrating and disappointing when games get pulled from store shelves due to licenses expiring, and too few ever return. So it&#x27;s great news that almost four years after Sega stopped selling Obsidian&#x27;s fascinating spy thriller RPG Alpha Protocol on Steam due to music rights expiring, it has returned to sale on GOG. I&#x27;m always surprised that Alpha Protocol hasn&#x27;t reached serious cult classic status because, as much as parts are distinctly wonky, the globetrotting sneak-o-shooter fizzes with ideas for intense dialogue, branching plot, and reputation systems with consequences. You do feel like a spy going up against the world, backed up only by shifty allies and a ridiculous pair of giant sunglasses.

It’s the 2TB model, sliced down to £86, which is the cheapest this particular drive has been since last year’s Black Friday. Not to mention about the same price as a 1TB WD Black SN850X, while providing twice as much room.

                              <span>Amazon’s big sale events, as overfrequent as they are, do at least reliably provide the discerning Steam Deck owner with good opportunities to grab a new microSD card. Case in point, Amazon Spring Deal Days – which launched today – has some alluringly low prices on the me-approved Samsung Evo Select. That’s on both the 256GB and the (also me-approved) 512GB models.

                              <span>It&#x27;s GDC week, and conversations are being had about AI. Ubisoft have blundered into this, in classic Ubi style, by revealing that they&#x27;ve had an R&amp;D team beavering away on a project called NEO NPC. It&#x27;s the usual pitch. &quot;Have you ever dreamed of having a real conversation with an NPC in a video game?&quot;, asks Ubi&#x27;s official post about it. And what all people who make this fail to understand that the answer most normal people give if they think about it is &quot;Erm, probably no, actually?&quot;
Still, the internet made good hay from the prototype image Ubisoft shared on Xitter, as many people took the opportunity to make fun of the dialogue from Bloom, a prototype man in a prototype beanie who wants to be your friend.

Update 1.6 arrived yesterday, with enough changes that the patch notes are 7308 words long. It bumps the farm-o-life sim&#x27;s co-op player limit to eight, adds hundreds of new items, opens up a new progression system for &quot;powerful perks and items&quot;, adds new events, lets you drink mayonnaise, and so much more that. Best of all, it lets you have more pets. New pets. Pets wearing hats.

If you&#x27;re a fan of Hotline Miami and have been itching for something similar on Switch, then the upcoming top-down shooter Otxo (pronounced &#x27;oh-cho&#x27;, by the way) could be one to keep an eye on.
Launching on 28th March, 2024, Otxo features a pixel art visual approach with a black and white colour palette; apart from the incredibly bright, gruesome blood, of course. Utilising a roguelike structure in which you can gain upgrades by purchasing various beverages, you&#x27;ll be gunning down foes left and right with gameplay that isn&#x27;t too dissimilar from Hotline Miami itself.

People play games for a variety of reasons. It could be that you want to experience a few thrills, get lost in a world beyond your imagination, or simply relax and wind down after the stresses of day-to-day life. Some games, however, are designed to test the very limits of your patience, inducing a level of anxiety that many would rather avoid at all costs. If you’re someone who thrives on tension and welcomes relentless challenges like a warm hug, then Krimson might just be the game for you.
Everything about developer CryingPsycho&#x27;s platformer, from its visual design to its audio, has been designed to be a total assault on the senses, and for good reason. It takes place in a rather abstract depiction of hell, and your job is to simply make it through each level in one piece. We say “simply”, but nothing about Krimson is particularly simple. It’s an exceptionally tough game that, like Super Meat Boy and Celeste, utilises death as a means to educate the player on how to overcome its myriad challenges.

With Switch now into its eighth year and Nintendo&#x27;s head chefs deep into software prep for the next console, remakes and remasters are the order of the day, with a platter of old favourites being served up in this twilight period for the current system.
We got the excellent Super Mario RPG late last year and the Mario vs. Donkey Kong remake in February, which was preceded by the Nintendo-published Another Code: Recollection. In May GameCube classic Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door is incoming, with Luigi&#x27;s Mansion 2 HD arriving the following month. And that&#x27;s only first-party stuff.

Konami titled last year&#x27;s Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 1 - suggesting a future compilation was on the way.
Now, during an official Konami Q&amp;A this week, Metal Gear Solid producer Noriaki Okamura has responded to a fan asking about a second collection.

Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door is arguably the most anticipated release on Nintendo&#x27;s calendar in 2024, and just months out from the title&#x27;s launch, it seems all this enthusiasm has led to the updated version completely selling out on Amazon in the US.

We&#x27;re back with the latest look at the UK charts and after seeing things get mixed up a little last time, normality has returned this week.
There are no newbies in the top 40 this time around. Last week&#x27;s surprise Switch hit Unicorn Overlord has seen a pretty substantial fall from 7th to 25th, while the previous gold medallist, WWE 2K24, has dropped to third. Of course, this means that EA Sports FC 24 and Hogwarts Legacy take the top two spots again — that didn&#x27;t last long, eh?

Soapbox features enable our individual writers and contributors to voice their opinions on hot topics and random stuff they&#x27;ve been chewing over. Today, to celebrate Super Metroid&#x27;s 30th anniversary, Ollie sings the praises of the game&#x27;s enduring foreboding atmosphere...

The Metroid series is perhaps best known for its wonderful atmosphere and keen sense of isolation. In addition to its consistently strong structure, interconnected locations, and formidable antagonists, its oppressive yet irresistibly intriguing atmosphere is one of the reasons why the games gained such a loyal following, and why it continues to become more successful as time goes on (albeit more slowly compared to other Nintendo franchises).

The classic Dreamcast shooter Rainbow Cotton is getting a full remake on the Nintendo Switch, and it&#x27;s launching soon on 9th May, 2024.
Boasting revamped visuals, improved game mechanics, and a new 2-player local multiplayer mode, the remake is said to be a faithful recreation of the original while bringing it in line with modern standards. To demonstrate this, ININ has released a debut trailer to make sure you&#x27;re clued up on the definitions of emulation, remaster, and remake. It&#x27;s always nice to get a reminder, eh?

Nintendo&#x27;s Princess Peach: Showtime! is just around the corner, launching on the Switch on 22nd March, 2024.
While our own review isn&#x27;t too far off, the folks over at Famitsu have posted their thoughts on the upcoming action-adventure (thanks, Gematsu and Ryokutya2089). The good news is that it seems to have proven a hit with critics, though it doesn&#x27;t reach the heights of some of Nintendo&#x27;s most prestigious Switch games, gaining a total score of 33/40. The split for this one is relatively even at 8 / 8 / 9 / 8.

                              <span>There&#x27;s always room for one more good one.
About five years ago, solo developer Evan Tor set out to make a new game in the crowded Metroidvania genre called Rebel Transmute. Tor launched a Kickstarter in 2022 to secure the funding to get the game over the line, and after a successful campaign and development period, the title has finally made it to consoles and PC. Rebel Transmute may not be a particularly innovative new entry in the genre, but what it lacks in novel ideas it more than makes up for in polish and quality. Rebel Transmute is great comfort food for the dedicated Metroidvania fan, and we’d suggest you pay attention to it.
Rebel Transmute places you in the role of Moon Mikono, a “space scrapper” in search of her mother who’s gone missing in action. Her search brings her to the isolated planet of Terra 6, which was once home to an extensive research facility helmed by the mysterious Foray corporation that her mother worked for. An EMP causes Moon’s ship to crash on Terra 6, and she wakes up twelve years later in a hostile and decrepit environment where something has since clearly gone wrong. Moon’s mother appears to be alive and somewhere on the planet, so our unlikely heroine sets out on a journey to find her and figure out what happened to the facility.

If you cast your mind back to the April 2023 Indie World showcase, you might remember the reveal of Animal Well — a pretty but punishing pixel art platformer being published by YouTubers videogamedunkey and Leahbee&#x27;s Bigmode. Well, that very game has now got a release date, and it&#x27;s coming to Switch on 9th May.
Animal Well is one of those games that brings vibes by the bucketload. You play as a little blob, making your way through a gorgeous pixel art labyrinth and collecting items to help you along your way. The only catch is that this labyrinth is filled with animals. And a lot of them are going to want to eat you.

We love a good retro-style puzzler here at Nintendo Life, and the upcoming Isles of Sea and Sky looks like it could be a doozy. The only downside right now is that it&#x27;s not confirmed for the Switch.. yet.
With a release on Steam coming at some point in 2024, developer Cicada Games has a console release in its sights, stating &quot;We are interested in launching on other platforms including the Nintendo Switch&quot; in the official press kit. We certainly hope it does make its way to the Switch, because it looks like a lovely litle puzzler in which you explore an open world and complete a variety of puzzles in whichever order you see fit.

One common response to the arrival of Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown on the Switch was to wait until a sale. And now, just months after its release, this slick and stylish &quot;must-play&quot; has received a 40% price cut on the eShop in the US and Canada.
As highlighted by Nintendo of America, this reduces the digital price of the 2.5D platformer from $49.99 to just $29.99. You can also save some money on the digital deluxe edition (featuring some in-game content and more), which is now $35.99 instead of $59.99. This sale runs until 1st April. If we hear anything about a sale in other regions, we&#x27;ll let you know.

Before last week&#x27;s troubled launch, Star Wars: Battlefront Classic Collection was already making headlines for &quot;mistakenly&quot; featuring footage of a community-made mod in an official trailer.
At the time, developer Aspyr said the game did not include &quot;any code or content&quot; from &quot;uncredited sources&quot;, but now traces of the same Asajj Ventress mod by &#x27;iamshaymin&#x27; have been discovered in the release build of the game.

When Nintendo confirmed the release dates of some upcoming Switch games recently, certain eagle-eyed fans noted how as of the next financial year, the company would seemingly be shifting release dates from Friday to Thursday in the US.
So far, this includes the launch dates for Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door (23 May 2024) and Luigi&#x27;s Mansion 2 HD (27 June 2024), and also Endless Ocean: Luminous (2 May 2024). Before now, games like Another Code: Recollection, Mario vs. Donkey Kong, and this week&#x27;s upcoming release Princess Peach: Showtime! have all been scheduled for Friday.

                              <span>Generative AI is all over the entertainment industries right now, and lots of people in games are making excited noises about finding new ways to integrate it into their products, from game developers and publishers such as Ubisoft and Square Enix to platform holders and hardware firms such as Epic and Nvidia. This new industry obsession is still taking shape, and there are lots of questions still to be answered about how much it might cost in the future, who will have access to it, and what it will actually help with, not to mention fears about job losses and other harms. But there’s a bigger question bubbling underneath all of this that threatens to burst the wobbly generative AI bubble: is the entire boom built on stolen labour?

                              <span>Just when I thought I was past being surprised by games adding battle royale modes, Blizzard today announced one for World Of Warcraft. Plunderstorm will drop 60 pirates onto the Arathi Highlands to fight monsters, loot chests, level up, acquire abilities, and beat the hell out of each other as a storm closes in. It&#x27;s initially due to run only for several weeks and will use wholly separate characters, though you can unlock cosmetics for your main wizards.

                              <span>Later this week, Payload Studios&#x27; open world vehicular survival builder TerraTech Worlds launches into early access. As the name implies, it&#x27;s a bigger, bolder and more ambitious take on their still very popular sandbox game TerraTech, but according to Payload&#x27;s founder and CEO Russ Clarke, they&#x27;re viewing this new version as more of a successor to TerraTech than a full-bodied sequel. &quot;The overall quality of experience is really a huge leap forward,&quot; Clarke told me during a press presentation last week. &quot;We&#x27;re not calling it a sequel because we felt that making it a sequel would be a bit too constraining.&quot; Rather, it&#x27;s &quot;more of a reimagining&quot; of the original game, says Clarke, with a change in engine and fresh investment from Tencent allowing them to reach the full potential of their original vision.

                              <span>I didn&#x27;t have any particular expectations for Heart Machine&#x27;s open world roguelike Hyper Light Breaker, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to feel so... broken-up, I guess. In this sequel to 2016&#x27;s alternately wistful and frenzied action-RPG, you are a debonair-looking sod with a hoverboard, paraglider, blades and guns, sent out into the procedurally generated realms of the Overgrowth to kill Abyss Kings, eat stat boosts and extract with loot.
The aforesaid hoverboard and glider, together with the streaking neon visual direction, suggest a game of fluid acrobatics, akin to the studio&#x27;s last release Solar Ash, which, to quote Ed&#x27;s review, &quot;has you rollerblade around shattered worlds like a post apocalyptic gazelle on wheels&quot;. Perhaps that game exists deeper within Hyper Light Breaker, but during my 20 minutes with the game at GDC, I found myself stopping and starting and struggling to build momentum using a combat system that felt both deliberately challenging and stilted.

This is the first Activision Blizzard game coming to Game Pass since Microsoft&#x27;s ridiculous $69 billion acquisition, with more due to follow. Beyond that, look forward to games including mech-riding farming game Lightyear Frontier and the colossal alien invasion strategy game from the XCOM Long War team, Terra Invicta.

                              <span>Cyan Worlds today announced plans to launch their fancy real-time 3D remake of Riven later this year, coming with support for both VR cybergoggles and standard meatspace screens. Riven: The Sequel To Myst was the 1997 sequel to Myst, the 1993 pre-rendered adventure game which sold a million CD-ROM drives and launched a thousand specks of spittle from John Walker&#x27;s mouth. The remake previously had a longwinded name of its own, Riven: New Discoveries Of The Lost D&#x27;ni Empire, but now is simply named Riven. They should rebrand again and call it Riven: The Sequel To The Myst Remake.

                              <span>Detective Edward Carnby looks very different these days, and not only because he’s made of a lot more polygons. Gone are the professorial waistcoat and bow tie of his angular 1992 incarnation, replaced instead by the grubby suit of a life-bruised 1930s noir PI, complete with hipflask of brandy for when the stress of being unaccompanied with the lights out gets too much.
Carnby isn’t the only one who’s transformed in this reboot of Alone in the Dark, the classic survival horror avant la lettre, either. Veterans will find plenty of callbacks and familiar names as they poke around its Louisiana manor house – talk of the Pregzt Shipping Company might raise an eyebrow, for instance, as may the gnarled tree filling much of the conservatory. But like these, everything here is remixed, rewritten, relocated. Indeed, Decerto house is no longer empty but a ‘home for the mentally fatigued’, while player characters Carnby and Emily Hartwood now arrive together, since she’s hired him to help check on her uncle, a long-term resident who may be in danger.

There&#x27;s a demo out right now that lets you explore a portion of the sandy map, try out a handful of the characters, and ride some rusty vehicles ahead of its release next month on April 25th.

                              <span>In the run-up to Total War: Pharaoh at the end of last year, a slightly strange question popped into my head: &quot;What if someone made a Total War game that also had the handsome anime looks of Fire Emblem: Three Houses?&quot; Clearly, it was also a question on the minds on Japanese indie developers ThinkGames Inc, who have just announced their debut game Valiant Tactics EX. The 38-second long reveal trailer paints quite an enticing picture ahead of its Steam launch on March 29th, and that&#x27;s not even the half of it either. For Valiant Tactics EX isn&#x27;t just an anime Total War-like. It&#x27;s also a whopping great deckbuilding game.

                              <span>Microsoft&#x27;s highly publicized acquisition of Blizzard has had wide-reaching effects, and while some of them have been quite awful, this month showcases one of the upsides. Diablo IV, one of Blizzard&#x27;s big 2023 releases, comes to Xbox Game Pass late next week, on March 28. We enjoyed the game quite a bit at launch, calling it a &quot;massive and deeply engrossing action RPG,&quot; so if you&#x27;ve been waiting to check it out, now is a good time to do so.
This month also includes a trio of games built around cars, though the three are each very different. F1 23 simulates the realism and intensity of Formula 1 racing, Hot Wheels Unleashed 2 is an arcade racer full of child-like wonder, and Open Roads (which will launch on Game Pass) is a quieter, narrative-driven game about a mother and her daughter going on a road trip. Maybe they&#x27;ll help me on my journey of learning how to drive.
Here&#x27;s the rest of the line-up:

                              <span>Today, after months of rumors and speculation, LEGO (in partnership with Wizards of the Coast) revealed the first full look at the new Dungeons &amp; Dragons-themed building set entitled Red Dragon’s Tale. The large 3,745-piece set is set to release on April 1 in LEGO stores and to those in the LEGO Insiders program. Everyone else can roll for initiative on snagging a set on April 4, for the price of $359.99.
Produced through the popular LEGO Ideas platform, where fans are able to submit their own build concepts that are then refined and produced as official sets, the final set includes a full dungeon and tower, a tavern, and six minifigures (including an Orc Rogue, Gnome Fighter, Elf Wizard, and Dwarf Cleric). Builders also get several iconic D&amp;D monsters, including an owlbear, beholder, displacer beast, and, of course, the red dragon Cinderhowl, who acts as the centerpiece of the set.

Interestingly, LEGO is offering an actual D&amp;D adventure book to LEGO Insiders as a free digital download or as a paperback book that can be purchased with 2,7000 Insider points. That same book will show up on D&amp;D Beyond (Wizards of the Coast’s digital hub for D&amp;D) complete with characters sheets and digital dice. Presumably, the idea is that you could play out the adventure with the included LEGO minifigs and monsters as the miniatures used on the table, which is a pretty slick way for dedicated players to capitalize on the completed build.
In addition to the larger set, LEGO also revealed plans for a full line of D&amp;D-themed minifigures, launching in September 2024.

                              <span>The remake of the 1997 classic Riven is officially launching later this year. This modern facelift of the acclaimed sequel to Myst is also coming to VR.
Developed by Cyan Worlds, a team led by the masterminds of the original game, Riven is being remade from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5. First announced in 2022, the game is promised to be a faithful homage that leverages modern tech to allow for immersive visuals, free movement, expanded storytelling, and new puzzles. Check out its latest teaser trailer below. 


Riven: The Sequel to Myst was first released in 1997 and has been hailed as a PC classic of the era. It&#x27;s so beloved that an existing fan-driven remake, The Starry Expanse Project, was already in the works when Cyan Worlds announced this remake. Recognizing their efforts, Cyan Worlds worked with The Starry Expanse to incorporate their efforts into this official remake. 
Outside of PC, it&#x27;s unclear which platforms, VR or otherwise, Riven will target. To keep up with similar projects, check out our Big List of Upcoming Video Game Remakes.</span>

The 1.6 Patch is now live, and it&#x27;s a doozy. If you want to read the patch notes in their entirety, which includes new content, balance updates, visual improvements, and more, you can do that right here.
The original story continues below...
Eight years after its official launch, Stardew Valley remains one of the most popular games on the market right now, which is no surprise; whether you&#x27;re marrying a neighbor, farming crops, or toiling away in the mines, it&#x27;s a game with something for everyone. Its creator, solo developer ConcernedApe, has updated it with plenty of free patches over the years, adding multiplayer, new farm types, and more, but when he moved on to work on his next game, Haunted Chocolatier, the Stardew updates came to an end. That is, until today.

                              <span>Balatro, the hit poker-inspired roguelike deckbuilder, has hit 1 million sales within its first month of release. Publisher Playstack also revealed a mobile version is in development.
Created by solo developer LocalThunk, Balatro is a roguelike tasking players to play poker hands to fulfill score criteria and advance a series of rounds. Along the way, they’ll spend money to augment their deck with new cards with special effects while collecting powerful Jokers that bestow a wide range of passive and trigger abilities.  
The game has earned widespread acclaim and popularity since launching on February 20. I awarded it a 9.5 out of 10, writing in my review, “Balatro is an ingenious and entertaining roguelike and one of my favorite games of the year. Playing it has become a near-obsession; everything feels perfectly designed to encourage you to keep trying because that next run could be the run of your life. Even after hours of play, I still can’t overcome Balatro’s biggest challenge: putting it down.”


In a press release announcing the 1 million milestone, LocalThunk writes, 
“I&#x27;m so grateful to all the players and people that have made this happen. I still can&#x27;t grasp the response to this game, and I am overjoyed that so many people have been able to have fun with my silly creation. I&#x27;m so fortunate that I can continue working on my passion as a career. Thank you!”
Balatro is currently available for PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC. There’s no release window for the impending mobile versions.</span>

                              <span>Valve has announced Steam Families, a revamped program that allows players to create a group to share and play games with close family members. The program launches today in the Steam Beta Client and it replaces the Steam Family Sharing and Steam Family View features. 
Steam Families can have up to six members, and joining gives you access to any sharable games in each member&#x27;s library. “Sharable games” is an important distinction, as Family Sharing is a feature that any developer can choose to opt out of for any reason at any time. Some games are also ineligible for sharing due to technical reasons. 
Noteworthy games currently eligible for Family Sharing include Helldivers 2, Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3, Balatro, Cyberpunk 2077, Elden Ring, and Hogwarts Legacy. You can read the full list here.

An entire generation of fighting game fans have been born, hit puberty, graduated college, found a career, and possibly started a family in the time between the last Fatal Fury game and the upcoming City of the Wolves. The most recent entry, Garou: Mark of the Wolves, was released in 1999 for arcades (and 2001 for Dreamcast in the West), meaning the series has been dormant for over 25 years. Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves sees the series make its long-awaited return, and it already feels ready to stand alongside the big boys of the genre.
I had a chance to play over an hour of City of the Wolves at the SNK World Championship Finals last weekend, where I also spoke with director Hayato Konya . Fatal Fury has been an arcade mai…</span>

                              <span>No matter the industry – sports, television, movies, or games – the debate of &quot;the greatest of all time&quot; inevitably comes up. These debates are often full of superfluous apples-to-oranges comparisons and, as a result, are unlikely to come up with a definitive answer everyone will be happy with. But that&#x27;s what makes them so fun. In that spirit, we&#x27;re taking the month of March to hold our own bracket-style tournament, voted on by readers, to determine the greatest video game of all time.
Though we here at Game Informer assembled the bracket, even that was heavily influenced by our Reader Vote we held in 2018 to coincide with our 300th issue. Using the results of our 2018 Reader Vote combined with some input from staff, general sentiment in various online communities, and critical reception for more recent games, we assembled a starting bracket of 64 games. From here, we&#x27;ll hold two rounds of voting per week until we whittle this field down to one ultimate winner.
Will this result in a definitive selection of the best game ever released? Or will it reveal a coordinated effort from a particular gaming community committed to seeing their favorite game rise through the ranks? Only time will tell. 
While this is meant to be a fun experiment to see how the results shake out within the Game Informer readership and community, we hope you&#x27;ll come back to root for your favorites every Monday and Thursday until we are able to crown our champion in the 2024 Game Gauntlet. Be sure to bookmark this page or follow us on social media to be alerted when a new round starts!

                              <span>Animal Well, the gorgeous indie metroidvania that will also be the first game published by Videogamedunkey&#x27;s Bigmode, will hit PlayStation 5, Switch, and PC this May. More specifically, developer Shared Memory, which is just solo dev Billy Basso, revealed in a new gameplay trailer the game will launch on May 9. 
Dunkey revealed Big Mode, his own publishing arm, back in 2022, later announcing that Shared Memory&#x27;s Animal Well would be the first game it publishes. Now, just shy of two years later, Animal Well will finally be in the hands of players in just a couple of months. 
Check out the Animal Well release date trailer for yourself below: 


&quot;After nearly 7 years of development, Animal Well is finally almost ready to be released out into the world,&quot; Basso writes on X (formerly Twitter). &quot;I have made this trailer to commemorate the occasion. I hope you like it. I don&#x27;t really know what else to say.&quot; 
As you can see in the trailer above, Animal Well continues to look hauntingly gorgeous, and even kind of cute if you&#x27;re a fan of spooky animals. We also get new glimpses of the game&#x27;s metroidvania exploration, too, by way of a special yo-yo with a light that lures animals forward and more. Plus, there&#x27;s a dog, which rules. 
Animal Well hits PlayStation, Switch, and PC on May 9.

                              <span>SNK has released a new gameplay trailer for its upcoming fighter, Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves, revealing it&#x27;s due out in &quot;early 2025&quot; as well. This trailer arrives roughly half a year after SNK formally revealed Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves in a trailer similar to today&#x27;s, featuring Terry Bogard facing off against Rock Howard. 
That duo returns for another fight in the latest trailer, spotlighting the game&#x27;s new &quot;REV&quot; system that features Rev Guard, Rev Blow, Rev Accel, and presumably more we&#x27;ll learn about when the game is released next year. 
Check it out for yourself in the new Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves gameplay trailer below: 


Unfortunately, the trailer doesn&#x27;t reveal anything else about the game, including platforms. Presumably, it will come to PlayStation and Xbox (possibly Switch), and PC. 
SNK will release Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves in early 2025.
In the meantime, check out SNK&#x27;s original tease for the game from 2022, and then watch the Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves reveal trailer from last year.

Updated with Llamasoft: The Jeff Minter Story. Enjoy!

Switch is many a gamer&#x27;s go-to console for revisiting retro classics, at home on the TV, or wherever you happen to take the handheld hybrid. Squeezing in nostalgia trips between the big new releases has never been easier, and there have been a host of exceptional collections and compilation packages on Nintendo&#x27;s system that bring together bundles of retro games, often with new features, bells and whistles.

Update: Oops! Nintendo has since removed the previous music video and instead replaced it with a new one, Color Pulse &#x27;24, an updated version of Off the Hook&#x27;s original song.
It seems like We&#x27;re So Back is another tune that we&#x27;ll be hearing later on down the line, but Nintendo uploaded it early by mistake. A number of prominent Splatoon leakers and players noticed the error on Twitter earlier.

Remember when Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns was coming to Switch? Us neither. The game was announced as &quot;no longer planned&quot; for the Nintendo hybrid in May of last year, but now a new hero has risen to fill the void in the superhero turn-based realm.
Capes will be soaring onto Switch this May, and while it might not pack in quite as many recognisable faces as the aforementioned 2K project (there&#x27;s no Spidey or Wolverine to be seen here) it&#x27;s nice to see that the Switch is at least included in this superhero team-up.

It helps that I&#x27;m hunting Bigfoot. Hefting my magical bow, I peer around a tree trunk at the creature as he wanders down a slope of vivid orange grass sprinkled with pale blue rock.

Why are people angry that this character has seven fingers? Why does Nvidia want me to talk to a robot about ramen? Why is everyone saying AI is smart when it still can’t manage its Classical Era luxury resource economy in Civilization properly? In this new series, we’re going to explore what &#x27;generative AI&#x27; is, why it’s arrived now in the games industry, and what it might mean for people who make, write about and play games in the future.

                              <span>HoYoverse have announced that sign-ups for Zenless Zone Zero&#x27;s next closed beta test are now available. While the start and end dates of the next closed beta haven&#x27;t been unveiled just yet, we do know that there&#x27;s going to be a new character to play, a new faction, new missions, and overhauls to the game&#x27;s combat and exploration. I&#x27;d imagine it&#x27;s worth a look if you&#x27;re into Genshin Impact, or are into your anime fights. Either one will suffice.

                              <span>While cloud gaming is very much not at a point where I want it to be the main way I play games, if I ever will, I do appreciate having the convenience as an option. Being able to play a game away from my PC can be handy. So it&#x27;s neat that GOG have announced they&#x27;re teaming up with Amazon to make select GOG games playable through the Amazon Luna cloud gaming platform &quot;soon&quot;. Sure, I might be tempted to take a nice stroll through Night City while slouching about with my laptop that absolutely cannot run Cyberpunk 2077.

This week, my eye has been caught by a meaty walking truck, opportunities for hubris, slime cleanup troubles, submarine dilemmas, and more. Check out these attractive and interesting indie games!

                              <span>Solo developer Billy Basso&#x27;s enigmatic Metroidvania Animal Well has been dated for May 9th, publishers Bigmode announced yesterday. In it, you&#x27;ll explore a vast labyrinth of tunnels, solve puzzles and escape its many mammalian-based horrors, all of whom  are out to gobble you up in one fell swoop - though as a strange, tiny little blob creature the size of a chicken nugget, it&#x27;s unclear both what you are, and why exactly you&#x27;re so appetising to them. Well, it probably has something to do with looking like a sentient chicken nugget, I suppose. Come and watch the release date trailer below.

                              <span>The Amazon Spring Sale is back, refreshed and renamed as Amazon Spring Deal Days. Maybe because there’s so many of them: this flowery festival of buying stuff begins on Wednesday March 20th and runs all the way through Monday March 25th. And I thought Prime Day was getting too long, sheesh.
On the upside, this should mean more chances topick up some quality PC gaming hardware on the cheap. Been putting off that new SSD or graphics card upgrade? Spring Deal Days is likely your best opportunity to exploit mass discounts until Summer.

Edwin is one the ground there for us, so we wish him well in his news gathering and interview appointments.

Today we&#x27;ll shine new light on the case and show why it has implications for every internet user in the country. That leads to the role of ISPs and whether internet users can rely on them to defend whatever privacy they have left.

My years of GDC left me devestated by the full realisation of how bad Mexican food is in the UK and I&#x27;m still not over it. Even the &#x27;fancy&#x27; tacos and burritos you find nowadays cannot stand up to whichever burrito joint was closest to the BART station, especially as those were $7 and you&#x27;ll pay £15 for a bad burrito here.

                              <span>BitTorrent is no longer the &#x27;King&#x27; of upstream traffic. New data published by Canadian broadband management company Sandvine reveals that cloud storage, YouTube, and other apps have taken over. This marks the end of a period of declining dominance that started two decades ago when BitTorrent reportedly accounted for a third of all web traffic.

A remarkable investigation followed as Bungie tracked down the perpetrator.

While the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the $1 billion damages award, it kept the contributory copyright infringement ruling intact. This precedent results in a &quot;draconian regime&quot; that threatens the Internet connectivity of millions of people, Cox warns.

Ahead of the game&#x27;s launch, Capcom has released a new gameplay overview trailer with more than seven minutes of new footage; and perhaps strangely, it&#x27;s narrated by actor Ian McShane (Deadwood, John Wick, Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides). 
Broken up into three sections in the video, McShane discusses &quot;The Hero&quot; of Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2, the &quot;Two Nations,&quot; and, of course, &quot;The Monsters&quot; that players will be killing plenty of during their journey.

                              <span>Senua&#x27;s Saga: Hellblade II is right around the corner, hitting Xbox Series X/S exclusively on May 21, and ahead of the game&#x27;s release, Ninja Theory has revealed it will have a dedicated photo mode. Plus, the studio released four new images of Hellblade II taken using the game&#x27;s photo mode. 
While in-game photo modes are becoming the norm more and more with each new release, there are still some games that launch without one. With how good Hellblade II continues to look in trailers and screenshots, it&#x27;s great to hear the game will feature this mode. 
Check out the four new Hellblade II images taken using the game&#x27;s photo mode for yourself below: 

Based on the tweet revealing the photo mode, it sounds like players can expect it to launch with the game. 
&quot;Photo mode returns in Senua&#x27;s Saga: Hellblade II,&quot; a Ninja Theory tweet reads. &quot;Here are some shot we took purely using photo mode in-game this week.&quot; 
Senua&#x27;s Saga: Hellblade II hits Xbox Series X/S on May 21, 2024.

Last month, we learned that Embracer Group, the company behind the closure of Saints Row studio Volition Games and layoffs at companies like Black Forest Games and Eidos-Montréal, was reportedly set to sell Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic remake developer Saber Interactive. The deal apparently carried with it a $500 million price tag, according to a Bloomberg report. 
Now, it&#x27;s official: Embracer has sold off Saber Interactive to a group of private investors under Beacon Interactive, as reported by VideoGamesChronicle. Beacon Interactive is controlled by Saber Interactive co-founder Matthew Karch, the publication reports. 


Embracer sold Saber Interactive to Beacon Interactive for $247 million, but there was an option for the former to bring Metro series developer…</span>

Following the rough launch of Star Wars: Battlefront Classic Collection, which is an HD port combo of the original Star Wars: Battlefront and Star Wars: Battlefront II on modern consoles and PC, developer Aspyr Media says it&#x27;s working to address issues and increase network stability. 
Shortly after the game&#x27;s launch on March 14, players across all platforms (but especially PC), experienced server issues preventing them from getting into matches as well as other connectivity issues like disconnects, rubberbanding, and more once actually in a match. The result was a wave of disappointment from players excited to play these classic multiplayer games. Now, a day later, Aspyr has acknowledged the issues and is working to fix them.

                              <span>Having spent close to 40 hours hanging out with Cloud and co. on my (entirely accidental) Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth holiday last week, I&#x27;ve been absolutely bowled over by the sheer size and scale of its big, open world map regions. I&#x27;ve only seen three of them so far, out of its total of eight, but it&#x27;s immediately obvious just how much of a step-up these places are compared to the dusty plains and rolling hills of the most recent Final Fantasy game to hit PC, FF15. An obvious take, perhaps, given that FF15 first came out eight years ago in 2016, but I&#x27;m sure anyone (all right, mainly me) who&#x27;s ever despaired at Noctis&#x27; seeming inability to climb even the smallest hillock in front of him, or how everyone always rides right into your backside while gunning about on a chocobo, will feel some m…</span>

                              <span>If you’ve ever suspected that harvesting crops in Stardew Valley is faster in one direction than another, validation is at hand. The beloved farming sim’s creator has confirmed that the long-rumoured quirk is real, as its incoming 1.6 update prepares to fix a bug dating back almost a decade.

                              <span>Combat is such a routine activity in video games that it often doesn&#x27;t feel much like conflict at all. It&#x27;s just something done to move the simulation along - a propulsive chore stripped of drama or significance or lasting emotion beyond a vague desire to see what lies beyond whatever it is you&#x27;re trying to kill. In Death Of A Wish, combat has substance: it&#x27;s a form of redemptive self-expression. The game&#x27;s fights are a means of asserting and cherishing yourself in the face of a world that regards you as a deviant, a world whose poison you carry on the inside.

                              <span>Port-o-remaster publishers Aspyr yesterday launched the Star Wars: Battlefront Classic Collection, bundling together the two &#x27;What if Battlefield but Star Wars?&#x27; shooters originally released by Pandemic Studios and LucasArts in 2004 and 2005 (not to be confused with Dice and EA&#x27;s uncolonic Star Wars Battlefront games from the mid-tensies). It&#x27;s one of those rereleases that exists mostly for modern consoles, made a bit useless on PC by the fact that you can still buy and fully play the originals for half the price. It&#x27;s made even less useful by launching in a right wonky technical state, with bad lag, crashes, and reportedly only three 64-player servers online at first.

                              <span>What do you reach for when you&#x27;re waiting in line at the supermarket, or waiting in a shop doorway for the rain to stop, or even while you&#x27;re waiting for a game to finish downloading? I don&#x27;t mean to assume, but let&#x27;s face it, it&#x27;s probably your phone, where some idle doomscrolling likely awaits you, or some other, time-wasting distraction that will help fill the dead air between one task and the next. Well, While Waiting is a game that delves into precisely this fundamental human question: what is the best thing to do while waiting for something else to happen? It&#x27;s from the makers of the very good puzzle game Moncage, and its newly released Steam demo is a pure, fidgety brilliance.

                              <span>My day in Lightyear Frontier starts out with a bit of farming. On a good day, it’s raining, so I don’t need to water the crops. On a bad day, there are weeds spontaneously spawning from the sky and I need to catch them before they land right on top of my precious plants. Either way, when I’m done, I’ll put the day’s harvest into the processing machines to work while I’m away, and then go exploring for minerals.
My goals are clear. I need to build a new machine, or upgrade my mech so that I can clean up a new area of the map and get new resources in return. Those will – you guessed it – let me build new machines or upgrade my mech again. There might be a few steps to juggle on the way, but nothing that needs me to hold long recipe flowcharts in my head. When I get back I’ll have everything I need to take the next step. It always feels like I’m making forward progress.

                              <span>I know that &quot;Made one guy admit he was wrong about a subgenre&quot; isn’t the kind of achievement they put in accolade trailers, but I must credit Warhammer 40,000: Darktide with tearing apart my blanket dislike of first-person melee fighters. Having spent months of stubbornly maining Veteran and sticking as closely as possible to FPS convention, I’ve since found peace in the simple act of swinging knives/swords/giant electrified hammers into and through people. Mainly because it’s not so simple: for all its chaotic spectacle, the meleeing in Darktide (this month’s RPS Game Club star) works because it’s secretly been a rhythm game.

                              <span>The Epic Games Store&#x27;s spring sale is underway, from today until March 28th. That makes it twice as long as Steam&#x27;s spring sale, which also started today. I&#x27;m not sure if that makes it twice as exciting, but here&#x27;s what does: Deus Ex Mankind Divided is free to keep for the next week.

                              <span>Helldivers 2&#x27;s Cutting Edge Premium warbond, aka DLC battle pass, is now available to buy in-game, and it is chock-full of oddball gadgetry such as lightning shotguns, burst-fire laser rifles and experimental armour. As with the Arc Thrower stratagem, the lightning shotgun fires arcs of electricity that conduct between players and enemies alike, but there&#x27;s a fresh armour perk, Electrical Conduit, which reduces arc damage by 95%, allowing close-knit teams of Helldivers to roll around the battlefield frazzling themselves without much penalty. 
Still, I think the real star pick here is surely the Localization Confusion booster, which extends the time between enemy spawns, allowing weirdo solo players such as myself to disentangle from a dragged-out gunfight a little more gracefully.

                              <span>You wouldn’t know because she hardly ever mentions it, but Alice Bee is not a Ready Player One fan. In fairness, the newly revealed Open (or Opthreen), an RPO-themed metaverse battle royale thing, does look, sound, feel, and smell horrible, so a solid chunk of this week’s Electronic Wireless Show podcast is just us despairing over it. But there’s also some honest-to-goodness games chat, as we field a question from EWS listener Pete (thanks Pete!) on the games our younger selves were parentally forbidden from playing – and how we feel about them as ostensible grownups.

                              <span>The studio behind unexpectedly decent Mickey Mouse life sim Disney Dreamlight Valley are venturing into another fantasy land where anthropomorphic animals adventure with human chums, the Forgotten Realms setting of Dungeons &amp; Dungeons. Today Gameloft announced they&#x27;re making a D&amp;D game offering a &quot;hybrid of survival, life simulation and action RPG&quot;. They don&#x27;t have much more to share about the game, not even a name, so presumably it won&#x27;t be out for some time. Whatever it might be, it&#x27;s headed to PC and consoles.

                              <span>This week&#x27;s announcement that Embracer are selling off Saber Interactive to new company Beacon Interactive has cast further doubt over the future of one of Embracer&#x27;s bigger projects, the much-delayed Star Wars: Knights Of The Old Republic remake. While Embracer have yet to actually state this out loud, it sounds like the KOTOR remake will be a &quot;joint project&quot; between Saber and Embracer. It also probably won&#x27;t be out in the next 12 months. Given the project&#x27;s repeated disruptions and delays, I suspect many of us will settle for the game coming out at all.

I am Dragonkin Skywalker - telekinetic Mystic Spearhand, oxcart patron and an extremely bad thief. Joining me on the adventure are three AI-controlled pawns - the diabolical fury that is Donald Duck, the levitating liability that is Galadriel, Queen of the Woods, and the class act that is celebrity stage magician David Blaine, all of whom I have given new and stupid names plucked from my vast knowledge of wizardry across different entertainment fields.

                              <span>Crow Country and its spooky, mutant-stuffed theme park will be opening its gates on Steam on May 9th, developers SFB Games have announced. It&#x27;s the first of two games from the Tangle Tower micro-studio coming to PC this year, the other one being The Mermaid&#x27;s Tongue, which will be picking up the adventures of their Tangle Tower detective duo on a marginally less spooky-looking submarine later this year. Crow Country, however, is a very different kettle of fish, combining chunky, PS1-style Final Fantasy 7 character models with early Resident Evil tank controls and panicked monster shooting.

                              <span>I promise that I mean this as an actual compliment, but having played an early build of Ascendant Infinity – Cambridge-based PlayFusion’s debut FPS – the impression I keep coming back to is that it’s a lot smarter than it looks.

                              <span>Cast your eye over the original Outcast from 1999 today, and you&#x27;ll find a world that&#x27;s more abstract than alien. Hazy, almost block colour textures are stretched to breaking point over terrain that looks like it&#x27;s been pulled and poked by a child sculpting in putty slime, while its cast of beige, three-fingered Talans are so rigid that they&#x27;d all be reigning champions at the local robot dance-off. Understandable, given the era in which is was made, but even so - what a difference 25 years make. Even after 2017&#x27;s remake glow-up with Outcast: Second Contact, A New Beginning&#x27;s version of Adelpha is a lush and verdant paradise, with treetops soaring over your head, and mountains requiring several triple or quadruple jetpack jumps to traverse. It&#x27;s no Avatar: Frontiers Of Pandora, admittedly, but it leans in very much the same direction, punching your eyeballs with such bright, primary colours that you&#x27;ll feel enticed to explore every inch of it.
A shame, then, that all its visual splendour amounts to is little more than an empty husk filled with open world busy work that already felt tired and done ten years ago. Its non-linear approach to storytelling remains intact, letting you tackle the quests and problems of its numerous village settlements in any order you wish, but even this has been boiled down to tedious checklists of fetch quests, escort missions and shooting up the same identikit facility one after another. Topping off this fatal combo is returning protagonist Cutter Slade, whose macho army dude dial is still set firmly to cringey wise-cracking and patronising stereotypes. A new beginning this ain&#x27;t.

                              <span>While we felt it wasn&#x27;t an amazing game, we quite liked The Lord Of The Rings: Return To Moria&#x27;s dwarven survival antics. It was a bit of cosy fun for a group of pals, and thankfully, open-ended co-op play looks to be the focus of the next big update, which adds a new sandbox mode that lets you pick rocks and sink pints free of storyline constraints. Not to mention new armour, weapons, and quality of life improvements like the ability to pause your single player sessions.

                              <span>Gameloft, the studio behind Disney Dreamlight Valley, has revealed it is partnering with Wizards of the Coast to create a new Dungeons &amp; Dragons game. It&#x27;s being developed for both consoles and PC and Gameloft describes it as an &quot;innovative hybrid of survival, life simulation, and action RPG.&quot;
Disney Dreamlight Valley is popular in the life sim genre, mixing fun gameplay, unique customization, and Disney together into a package that players seem to really enjoy. It launched into Early Access back in 2022 before the full release debuted in December. All of this is to say: if you&#x27;re a fan of Disney Dreamlight Valley and Dungeons &amp; Dragons, there&#x27;s a new game to keep an eye on. 
Currently untitled, Gameloft says in its announcement on Instagram that the game is set in the mythical Forgotten Realms, which is also the D&amp;D setting Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 takes place in. The game, which will mix survival, life simulation, and action RPG elements into one, will feature &quot;unique cooperative gameplay,&quot; the studio says. 
&quot;Players can expect an adventure where the rich lore of this legendary franchise meets real-time strategy in a unique campaign of resilience, camaraderie, and danger at nearly every turn,&quot; the announcement reads.&quot; 
There&#x27;s no name for the project and no release window either. Gameloft is currently hiring for the project. 
News of this D&amp;D game arrives roughly a year after Wizards of the Coast, which owns the D&amp;D IP and is a division within Hasbro, reportedly canceled five unannounced games. The last D&amp;D game released was Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Dark Alliance back in 2021 – read Game Informer&#x27;s review of it here.

                              <span>In 2023, Sega Sammy Holdings acquired Rovio, subsequently making the famed Angry Birds developer a subsidiary of Sega Europe. While Sega&#x27;s Japanese social media account shared a photo of a Red statue standing alongside Sega&#x27;s other mascots (see below), we haven&#x27;t seen the acquisition impact the games to this point. That changed today, as Sega and Rovio announced a multi-game crossover event between Sonic and Angry Birds on mobile devices.
The crossover event even comes with its own storyline, which includes a plot to steal the Angry Birds&#x27; eggs that accidentally creates a portal between the world of Angry Birds and Sonic&#x27;s world. Sonic, Red, and their friend groups must work together across five mobile titles to stop Dr. Eggman. The event will include new playable characters, cross-brand c…</span>

                              <span>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection is getting delisted on Steam in Japan later this month. That&#x27;s according to a new &quot;Notice of End of Sales&quot; post on the game&#x27;s Steam page. From Friday, March 29, 2024, onward, the game will no longer be available for purchase in Japan on the storefront. 
However, online play will remain available after the game&#x27;s delisting, and purchased copies of the collection will remain available for re-download from the Steam store. 
Released less than two years ago on August 30, 2022, on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC, The Cowabunga Collection getting delisted so soon comes as a shock. However, it&#x27;s seemingly only affecting TMNT players in Japan. Game Informer reached out to publisher Konami to ask if there are plans to delist the game outside …</span>

                              <span>The creators of RuneScape, Andrew and Paul Gower, have revealed Brighter Shores, a new point-and-click fantasy adventure MMORPG. And if you&#x27;re a fan of RuneScape, Brightet Shores looks like a game you&#x27;ll want to keep an eye on. 
After starting Jagex in 1999, the Gower brothers focused their efforts on the studio&#x27;s first big release: RuneScape. The rest is history. RuneScape is still a very popular game today, both in its modern form and as Old School RuneScape. The Gowers left Jagex in 2010 and little was known about what they were up to until now. It turns out Andrew Gower was working as the lead designer on their new game, while Paul Gower was working as the narrative designer for it.

The company has just shut down around 30 GitHub repos offering circumvention tools with attempts to evade liability given short shrift. One Nintendo takedown notice makes it clear that, even when people link to a third-party site that hosts tools available via different links, it still amounts to trafficking in circumvention devices under the DMCA.

                              <span>Oppenheimer was one of the most-watched movies in theaters last year, grossing nearly a billion dollars in box office revenues. For several months, the movie has been widely available on pirate sites too. While one might think that all demand would be satisfied, winning the Oscar for &#x27;Best Picture&#x27; more than doubled the interest on pirate sites this week. The same Oscar boost affects other titles as well.

                              <span>The head of Italy&#x27;s telecoms regulator says fines of up to 5,000 euros for watching pirate IPTV streams are coming soon. Massimiliano Capitanio says users of apps downloaded from Google, Apple, and Amazon, will receive the same treatment, while confirming that investigators won&#x27;t have to obtain per-person permission from a court anymore. Italians are assured, however, that warning them of the risk of 5,000 euro fines is definitely not &quot;psychological terrorism.&quot;

I dearly hope that when you clicked on your vote, your Windows cursor was a little gauntlet or skeletal hand or such. Onwards! This week, I ask you about grabbing (and poking, pulling, burning, pressing, activating, and otherwise using) stuff. What&#x27;s better, highlighted interactive objects or retrievable reusable ammo?

                              <span>I’m not personally familiar with Nexon’s 2010 MMO Vindictus, but its upcoming action-RPG spin-off Vindictus: Defying Fate is looking like a fairly flashy mix of Celtic mythology, dodge-and-slash swordplay and some sharp visuals. Luckily for me and you, we’ll be able to give it a go for free for the next week, as the game’s pre-alpha playtest is now live over on Steam.

                              <span>In some respects, Helldivers 2 did come as a bit of surprise. Not a huge amount of marketing, no betas, and review codes didn&#x27;t go out until it basically launched. Before it landed on my PC, there was a small part of me that thought it was going to be a rocky ride with severe performance issues or the like. Nope! It&#x27;s easily slid into one of my favourite games of the year without question, and presumably, for the hundreds of thousands of others who&#x27;ve also opted into preserving democracy.
But there seems to be this sentiment that Helldivers 2&#x27;s roaring success has come as a shock, so much of a shock that top execs and investors are doing YouTube thumbnail faces in boardrooms with mini-nuke explosions erupting from their heads. Should its success come as that much of a surprise, though? No, probably not.

                              <span>After writing about the upcoming visual novel-ish game Vampire Therapist (in which you are a vampire, acting as a therapist to other vampires) back in the middle of January, developer Cyrus Nemati reached out asking if I&#x27;d like to ask him more questions about it. This was surprising, because while I&#x27;d been broadly positive about the vibes of Vampire Therapist, I was reasonably concerned about the specifics of how it would all shake down. But it turned out that the critical perspective was something Nemati appreciated, and so we had a chat that dug down into the meat of it all. Although I was initially interested in how he&#x27;d come up with the idea of a vampire therapist, it turns out all roads lead back to Twilight&#x27;s Edward Cullen.

                              <span>CCP Games have shared a few more details about Project Awakening, a new game or at least, &quot;survival experience&quot; set in the Eve Online universe, which is getting a closed playtest from 21st May 2024. Project Awakening is a single-shard affair - that is, one in which all players inhabit the same world, rather than being split up across servers or instances. It&#x27;s &quot;built upon the principles of freedom, consequence, and mastery within a living universe&quot;, and &quot;represents the next step in CCP Games&#x27; journey to create virtual worlds more meaningful than real life&quot;, which, you know, wind your neck in.

                              <span>I’ve spent many gleeful hours in The Finals (as has Graham), but I’ve always felt it could do more with the concept of its FPS gameshow deathmatches essentially taking place in hyper-realistic VR. Exploding into coins upon death notwithstanding, and to be clear, rad as hell. Happily, its Season 2 update is all about rewriting the rules of its glistening digital battlefields. I’ve played a few rounds and the new, hacking-themed gadgetry it introduces looks like just the thing to freshen The Finals up.

                              <span>Discord is making a play to not simply be the software you use to talk while playing games with your pals, but the software you use to play them too. The ubiquitous chat client already lets you play a handful of approved games inside itself without dowloading or launching anything seperate, along with other &#x27;Activities&#x27; like watching YouTube together, and next week it will open up to a whole lot more. Discord will let all developers make their own Activities, wanting to jam in more games and social hangout experiences and stuff. I&#x27;m broadly up for things removing faff from getting casual hangout games running with pals.

                              <span>One of my favourite &#x27;jokes&#x27;to do is parody Raymond Chandler, i.e. I shout &quot;She had legs all the way up to her thighs!&quot; and then laugh at myself. Chandlers&#x27;s trademark &quot;blonde to make a bishop kick a hole in a stained-glass window&quot; kind of zingers are very hard to do well, so it&#x27;s better to say you&#x27;re doing Philip Marlow badly on purpose. The trailer for Nobody Wants To Die seems like it&#x27;s self-seriousness is actually self-awareness. I mean, I kind of refuse to believe that hard-boiled future crime detective James Karra saying &quot;I&#x27;m in the business of secrets... But it&#x27;s more of an addiction... And I like &#x27;em straight... No chaser...&quot; while sipping from a glass of amber liquor isn&#x27;t indulging in some amount of winking and nudging.

If you were unaware of said mod, it&#x27;s a Patron-funded expansion that puts Dark Souls 3 on an alternate storyline in a way akin to Demon Souls, with a hub area home to five gateways that&#x27;ll transport you to five worlds. If there was ever a reason to return to Dark Souls 3, this is probably it.

                              <span>Stealth games in which you can become &quot;one with the shadows&quot; cover a wide range, though I guess spectrum is the more appropriate word here. You&#x27;ve got sober infiltration games like Thief, which metes out gradations of light and dark with the care of somebody calculating their tax expenses, and stylised affairs such as Mark Of The Ninja, in which stepping into shadow desaturates you and sort of makes your character far too fancy for enemies to notice.
There are games such as Splinter Cell, in which hiding in shadows rests on a gentleman&#x27;s agreement with NPCs not to perceive the big green torches attached to Sam Fisher&#x27;s head. And then you have games like Ereban: Shadow Legacy, which has just been given a release date - 10th April. In this mystical third-person stealth-platformer, your character can literally disintegrate and travel through shadows as a ripple of dark energy - a transformation that puts me in mind less of Thief than of squid-mode in Nintendo&#x27;s Splatoon.

                              <span>There are 137 Pals in Pocketpair&#x27;s monster-catching simulator Palworld, which might sound like plenty, but the serial Palworld player is an insatiable creature, always clamouring for new beasties to capture, pet and exploit, even as the developers encourage fans to play other games while they wait for the next Palworld update. If you&#x27;ve already bagged all the available Pals and are hungry for more, you might be interested in Palworld mod Breed Unreleased Pals, created by ShameIHaveNoFriends, which grants access to three animals who exist in the game&#x27;s files but are not, strictly speaking, available to players.

                              <span>Who is Jeff Minter? Unless you’re a long-term fan of his work, you might have asked that upon hearing about Llamasoft: The Jeff Minter Story, the latest interactive documentary from Digital Eclipse (following on from The Making Of Karateka and Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration). You might have heard Minter’s name in connection with the remake of the unreleased Atari arcade game Akka Arrh in 2023. Maybe you played his mind-warping shooter Polybius in VR. You might remember as far back as the Atari Jaguar and Minter’s phenomenal Tempest 2000, the unexpected highlight of the console’s library. Or perhaps you recall his work from the 8-bit glory days. You could just know him from the daily videos of him feeding his sheep on YouTube.


The point is that Jeff Minter has been making games for a phenomenally long time – more than 40 years, in fact. And in all that time, he has stayed true to what he believes in. “One of the things we say in the game itself is the idea of him being the last indie developer,” says Chris Kohler, editorial director at Digital Eclipse in California. “The last of the people from the early 80s who very consciously never sold out, never took the money, never looked to expand or do anything other than [be] just Jeff at his computer, making the sorts of video games that he wants to make.”

The video itself is sixty seconds of pure, colourful joy, and it ends on a release date: April 9th.

After checking the game out for a few hours alongside some of the leads at Moon Studios in Vienna, Austria, last month, cover story writer and Game Informer editor Marcus Stewart and I have a pretty good idea about what to expect from No Rest for the Wicked&#x27;s early access release – you can read my preview thoughts here and his cover story here.
We&#x27;re both excited for the release, too. It&#x27;s a fun game so far, and it&#x27;s a unique approach for Moon Studios. No Rest for the Wicked tech and production director and Moon Studios co-founder Gennadiy Korol and studio CEO and c…</span>

                              <span>Developer Ubisoft Montpellier&#x27;s excellent metroidvania, Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, hit consoles and PC in January, and it&#x27;s still one of Game Informer&#x27;s top scoring reviews of the year. You can read Game Informer&#x27;s Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown review here to find out why we love it so much. Now, Ubisoft is giving players another reason to jump back in with a new post-launch content roadmap. 
What&#x27;s more, all of the new content coming to the game is set to release throughout the year, starting with new Speedrun and Permadeath modes this month as well as new outfits for Sargon. In spring, a Boss Rush will be released alongside even more outfits for Sargon, and in summer, the Divine Trials update brings new combat, platform, and puzzle challenges as well as new amulets, outfits, and more. All of this will be free, too. 
However, later in 2024, new paid story DLC will hit Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, although Ubisoft offers no teases about what to expect. 
It&#x27;s an exciting roadmap, doubly so considering the majority of the new content is free. 
For more, read Game Informer&#x27;s Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown review, and then check out our breakdown of the four ways Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown gets the metroidvania genre right.

                              <span>Helldivers 2 developer Arrowhead Game Studios quietly snuck flying Terminid bugs into the game in the latest update, it seems. Windows Central noticed flying Shrieker bugs are enemies that appear on planets plagued with Terminids and while official accounts for the game play coy, more and more players are running into them. 
It seems the Shriekers were added with Patch 1.000.102, which went live yesterday. Coincidentally, that patch was centered on Terminids and nerfing spawn rates for Bile Titans and Chargers on the harder difficulties of Helldivers 2. Windows Central reports Shriekers only appear when a &quot;Shrieker Lair&quot; is one of the side objectives on a planet, noting they look like &quot;smaller versions of the mushroom-like Spore Towers that perpetually keep a large area around them covered in a thick haze.&quot; 


Shrieker Lairs, like the Spore Towers and Terminid egg nests can be destroyed up close and from afar with a well-placed rocket, grenade, or strategem. 
Keep your eyes on the skies, Helldivers and remember...DEMOCRACY.
For more about the game, read Game Informer&#x27;s Helldivers 2 review, and then read about a recent patch that introduced meteor showers and fire tornadoes to the game. After that, check out the Cutting Edge Warbond coming to the game tomorrow.

                              <span>V Rising hit Early Access on PC in 2022, selling more than 1.5 million copies in just two weeks. Since then, the game has continued to garner attention from players for its great mix of survival mechanics and action-RPG combat. Now, just shy of two years in Early Access, V Rising will launch into 1.0 in May. 
More specifically, V Rising transitions into 1.0 on May 8. We learned during a State of Play in January that developer Stunlock Studios&#x27; vampire game would be coming to PlayStation 5 this year, and today&#x27;s announcement further affirms the team is confident it will hit the platform in 2024. 
Check it out in the official V Rising release date trailer for yourself below, courtesy of IGN: 


V Rising is currently available to purchase via Early Access on PC before it launches into 1.0 on May 8. It hits PS5 later this year.

                              <span>Sabotage Studio has teased a new three-player co-op mode for its 2023 RPG Sea of Stars alongside news the game has surpassed 5 million players in less than a year. This new mode, dubbed Single Player+, lets three players journey together through the story of Sea of Stars, and it will feature new traversal and combat mechanics to accommodate playing with friends. 
Sabotage announced this news today with a special teaser trailer you can watch below. In it, you&#x27;ll get a glimpse of what Sea of Stars&#x27; Single Player+ mode looks like, how it works, and what to expect. Check it out: 


&quot;Staying true to the game&#x27;s core turn-based roots, each player will engage in traversal and combat with a new &#x27;co-op timed hits&#x27; mechanic as they embark with friends on Sea of Stars&#x27; grand adventure,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;The new mode is currently in development and more details are set to be released soon.&quot; 
As you can see, Sabotage isn&#x27;t quite ready to reveal when this new mode will hit the game. After all, the team is still working on Throes of the Watchmaker, a new DLC coming to the game sometime in the future.

                              <span>PlayStation is rolling out a new update for the PlayStation 5 that enhances audio on the DualSense controller, adds new Share Screen features, and more. This update was in beta last month but rolls out for everyone starting today. 
The biggest features are coming to the PS5&#x27;s DualSense controller. The built-in speakers can now produce higher volume sound, which PlayStation says will allow players to hear in-game sounds and voice chat audio more clearly. Plus, the noise cancellation on the controller&#x27;s built-in mic has been improved. 


&quot;The mic input quality on these controllers has been improved, courtesy of a new A.I. machine learning model,&quot; a PlayStation Blog post reads. &quot;Background noise from button presses and game audio are suppressed, resulting in a better voice chat experience.&quot;
Share Screen is also getting some new features with today&#x27;s update. Namely, viewers can move a pointer around and send a ping or draw a line on a shared screen, allowing them to highlight objects in-game or guide a player. Plus, viewers can now send emoji-based reactions to the host&#x27;s screen – these features are turned off by default and the host and viewer must turn them on. PlayStation says these Share Screen features will hit the PS App, which also allows Share Screen, later this month. 
Finally, today&#x27;s update allows users to adjust the brightness of the PS5 power indicator. Simply go to Settings, then Beep and Light, and then Brightness. 


For more, read about the last big PS5 update that added Dolby Atmos, larger SSD capacity, and more to the console, and then check out this story about a retailer listing of a &quot;V2 DualSense&quot; with a 12-hour battery life. After that, read about how the PS5 surpassed 50 million units in December, and then check out Game Informer&#x27;s top 10 PS5 games to play right now.

Jako obvykle se majorita aktivit točí kolem podpory nových Radeonů, což aktuálně znamená refresh generace RDNA3 a přípravy na RDNA4, stejně tak nechybí práce na ovladači Intel Xe, který je od Linuxu 6.8 již mimo experimentální fázi vývoje.</span>

Draw from enough unique inspirations, and eventually, a game begins to feel entirely novel. That’s the sensation that emerges as you play Unicorn Overlord, Vanillaware’s vast fantasy adventure of tactics, strategy, and storytelling. I was consistently reminded of other systems and mechanics from prior genre releases, but the resulting combination felt consistently original and entertaining, even after many hours of battle and exploration.

                              <span>Developer Night Dive Studios&#x27; System Shock remake is finally coming to PlayStation and Xbox consoles. Originally released on PC on May 30, 2023, Night Dive and publisher Prime Matter revealed today that System Shock hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on May 21, just shy of the game&#x27;s one-year anniversary. 
This reveal comes by way of a new trailer over at IGN, which teases some of the sci-fi horror and first-person shooting players can expect in the game. Check it out for yourself below in the System Shock consoles release date trailer: 


The remake today is in great shape on PC, and players should expect a well-made retread of the classic game. This remake had been in the works for years before its PC release last year – check out the game in a pre-alpha state in 2016 here.

                              <span>If you ask any Final Fantasy fan what their top five favorite songs in the franchise are, there&#x27;s a 99 percent chance one of them is &quot;To Zanarkand&quot; from Final Fantasy X. However, it turns out, it wasn&#x27;t originally intended for the game. 
This news comes from Audrey (aitaikimochi on X, formerly Twitter), a mega Final Fantasy fan, Twitch streamer, and CEO of Aitai Japan Inc., who translated a recent interview between Weekly Ochiai and Final Fantasy X composer Nobuo Uematsu, whose credits also include One-Winged Angel and Aerith&#x27;s Theme from Final Fantasy VII and so much more. In that interview, Uematsu revealed &quot;To Zanarkand&quot; originally began as a piece for a French flute player, meant to be played during a recital. 


&quot;&#x27;To Zanarkand&#x27; was actually not meant to be the theme for Final Fantasy X,&quot; Uematsu tells Weekly Ochiai, as translated by Audrey on X. &quot;There was a flute player from France who originally asked me to write a song for them to play during a recital. When I wrote the piece, I thought perhaps this sounded a bit too sad for a recital. So I set it aside for the time being. 
&quot;Sometime after, when I was making the score of Final Fantasy X, I was falling behind all the while the producers were hounding me. So since that flute piece was unused, I just kind of meekly handed it to them. They listened to it and said, &#x27;Yes! This is brilliant!&#x27;&quot; 
In retrospect, it&#x27;s wild &quot;To Zanarkand&quot; wasn&#x27;t originally composed by Uematsu for Final Fantasy X because it fits the game&#x27;s themes so well, nailing the somber and sad tone present throughout Tidus and Yuna&#x27;s journey in Spira.

                              <span>Yesterday’s Capcom Highlights Day 2 presentation gave us our first look at Akuma before he joins Street Fighter 6 sometime this spring. The master of the Satsui no Hado serves as the game’s final Year 1 DLC fighter.
A cinematic trailer shows off the now white-haired Akuma’s new look and his apparent mastery of the art of punching giant statues to rubble. We’ll have to wait to see gameplay, but this teaser certainly sets the mood for the brooding warrior. 


Akuma joins previous Year 1 characters Rashid, A.K.I., and Ed, and Capcom plans to detail Year 2 content later this year. In the meantime, be sure to check out our Street Fighter 6 review.</span>

                              <span>Starbreeze Studios CEO Tobias Sjögren is no longer with the studio and the Payday 3 developer is now recruiting for a new leader. This news comes from a recent notice to investors that explains board member Juergen Goeldner is taking over as interim CEO in the meantime, as reported by GameDeveloper. 
While Starbreeze&#x27;s messaging around Sjögren&#x27;s leave isn&#x27;t super clear – the team simply says it is bidding farewell to the former CEO – today&#x27;s news arrives after Payday 3 failed to meet expectations, according to GameDeveloper. 


&quot;On behalf of the board of directors, I would like to thank Tobias Sjögren for his achievements during the past three years,&quot; board chairman Torgny Hellström writes in the notice to investors. &quot;Tobias took over the helm of Starbreeze in a challenging phase of its journey and we wish him well in his future endeavors.&quot;
Goeldner, the new interim CEO, adds, &quot;Starbreeze has a strong history of developing and publishing games globally. After launching Payday 3, the company is well-positioned to leverage the strengths of the organization to monetize and develop the IP portfolio. I am looking forward to assuming an operative position and, together with the management, ensure the execution of this strategy.&quot;
Goeldner has 40 years of experience in the games industry, including several executive positions, according to the notice. His last executive position was as CEO of Focus Home Interactive. He has been a member of Starbreeze&#x27;s board of directors since last year. Starbreeze has initiated a recruitment process for a permanent CEO. 


Payday 3 hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on September 21. We enjoyed the game around launch, giving it an 8 out of 10 in the Game Informer Payday 3 review. More than 3 million people played Payday 3 in its first month, but the game still failed to meet the expectations of the studio.

Prior to directing Survivor and its predecessor, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, Asmussen worked as the director of God of War III and art director of God of War II at Sony Santa Monica.
He left Star Wars Jedi developer Respawn Entertainment in September. Giant Skull is headquartered in Los Angeles but will feature remote developers from around the world. 
&quot;The Giant Skull studio culture is focused on creativity and curiosity,&quot; Asmussen, who is CEO of the new studio, writes in a press release. &quot;We have assembled a talented team renowned for immersive storytelling, heroic combat, and exhilarating traversal, and our goal is to craft a rich universe that play…</span>

                              <span>Moon Studios co-founder and tech and production director Gennadiy Korol has revealed the team&#x27;s upcoming action-RPG, No Rest for the Wicked, which is also the game on Game Informer&#x27;s cover this month, will not require an online connection to play single-player. Although, if you&#x27;ve read our cover story about the game, you already know this, and you also know you can play the game with up to three friends on a shared living server.
What&#x27;s more, Korol says the game will feature &quot;a rich Offline Mode&quot; for those not interested in the game&#x27;s multiplayer elements.


Korol announced this today on X (formerly Twitter), expanding on Moon&#x27;s thoughts about No Rest for the Wicked as both a single-player and multiplayer game. 
&quot;Even though Wicked was built from the ground up with multiplayer in mind, we did not want offline-play to feel like a second thought and we want people to be able to play on the go when connection quality is not always ideal,&quot; Korol writes. &quot;Our April 18th [Early Access launch on PC] will focus on the single player experience and we will be sharing more details about the Multiplayer aspect of the game later in our Early Access campaign.&quot; 


Game Informer has played hours of No Rest for the Wicked, so far only in single-player, and it&#x27;s been a blast. You can read our preview thoughts on the game&#x27;s opening hours here, and you can watch it for yourself in our No Rest for the Wicked New Gameplay Today.

In the early 2000s, tennis video games were everywhere. Whether you were talking mass-appeal titles like Virtua Tennis and Mario Tennis or more niche, lower-budget games like Smash Court Tennis Pro Tournament and Hard Hitter Tennis, the market was absolutely flooded with choices. One of the most beloved of this era was 2003&#x27;s Top Spin, which started as an Xbox exclusive before making the leap to PS2 and PC in subsequent years. Since that inaugural game, Top Spin has seen three more numbered entries, all receiving high review scores.

It&#x27;s coming real soon, with its single-shot murder bullet puzzles hitting Steam on April 9th - and to celebrate, there&#x27;s a flashy new release trailer to go with it. Come and be dazzled by its exploding headshots below.

I am not going to embed the footage because I’m not sure if doing so would cause screaming Spider-Lawyers to crash through my window – best of luck finding tall objects to swing from in darkest West Yorkshire, webheads! - but I will do you the great honour of describing the footage below.

                              <span>This weekend I said one of the games I was planning to be playing was Chasing The Unseen, and I did in fact do that. It is indeed a strange, dream-like experience where you leap floaty leaps onto thin, spindly crags of rock in a sage-grey void. Rather than finding it soothing, I found it it extremely stress-making. This was the opposite experience to what I had expected.

I also wasn&#x27;t too keen on its slew of bugs and tricksy interface. Still, the devs are hard at work fixing things, as the latest patch squashes major crashes, material losses when building, and further improves the UI.

The developers have also lowered the health of the Charger’s head, allowing for instant takedowns with a Recoilless Rifle or EAT-17, without (in theory) entirely doing away with the community’s treasured &quot;leg meta&quot;, which sees players blasting the juggernaut’s limbs to sabotage it.

They&#x27;ve remastered it with a wee visual refresh, fully voice acting, a concept art gallery, and more. We&#x27;ve actually already had the sequel on PC, 2021&#x27;s Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings Of Ruin, so it&#x27;s nice to catch up.

                              <span>I remember revealing at some point that my most-played game is actually a free-to-play picross game (picross, also called nonograms sometimes, being the logic puzzle game where you colour in squares on a grid to reveal a larger picture). You can imagine my intrigue when I saw that Tents And Trees, a picross-ish puzzle game previously on Switch and phones, is coming to PC on April 24th. That&#x27;s a couple of months away, but you can play the short demo on Steam now to get a taste. It&#x27;s slick and clean, and I like it!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve written a bit about playing Helldivers 2 as a solo diver, noting that Arrowhead&#x27;s frenetic shooter holds up surprisingly well when you rudely insist on treating it like an open world stealth sim, a la Metal Gear Solid V. The developers have weighed in on this front, commenting that strictly speaking, Helldivers 2 doesn&#x27;t support stealth at all. It&#x27;s just designed in an &quot;agnostic&quot;, systems-first way and this in itself makes stealth a possibility. It&#x27;s also a quiet attempt to capture something of the intricacy of a full-blown military simulator, while still being a very &quot;arcadey&quot; game at heart, which owes a little to Arrowhead&#x27;s own collective time in the military.

                              <span>Reports that top-tier Spanish football league LaLiga will soon file lawsuits against users of pirate IPTV services are incorrect. A court in Barcelona has indeed authorized LaLiga to obtain the identities of subscribers at five major ISPs, but if our reading of court documents is accurate, LaLiga hasn&#x27;t identified any, even by their IP addresses. As unlikely as it may sound, LaLiga may have no evidence that any subscriber did anything wrong, so ISPs have been instructed to find some.

WWE 2K24 leverages WrestleMania’s impending 40-year milestone to celebrate the event, and it proves to be a party worth attending. Enjoyable additions and smart improvements bolster its steadily improving formula, making it the strongest in-ring outing since the series’ return. 
2K24’s control scheme remains largely unchanged from 2K23 but boasts neat new mechanics, such as the trading blows mini-game. This gamification of the back-and-forth “boo/yay” punch trope adds a fun wrinkle to combat. Other well-worn i…</span>

Bhimani lucked out; it was the first time she ever acted in a game.
&quot;All I knew is I&#x27;m doing the new game for Blizzard,&quot; Bhimani says. &quot;And I knew that Blizzard was, you know, no slouch. They&#x27;ve done a lot of really cool things before, so chances were this was gonna be really cool. But I had no idea. I don&#x27;t think anyone really did.&quot;

You can read my exclusive preview of The Rising Tide DLC here, and I&#x27;ve got a story about how you shouldn&#x27;t expect more DLC here and another about the lastest update to the PC version&#x27;s development here, too.

                              <span>MultiVersus, the Warner Bros. free-to-play crossover platform fighter, makes its big comeback on May 28. The game has been rebuilt and returns almost a year after its open beta was taken offline.
Player First Games game director Tony Huynh explains in a developer diary that MultiVersus has been remade from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5, meaning it sports improved visuals and lighting. It also has a totally revamped netcode to provide what Huynh promises will be consistent online performance regardless of platform.
Every existing fighter sports new attacks and combat mechanics, and Huynh promises that new fighters are on the way. Additionally, new stages were teased with concept art depicting arenas based on The Powerpuff Girls’ Townsville and Dexter’s Laboratory.
Lastly, Huynh reveals a brand-new PvE mode is coming to the game. He doesn’t go into detail, only teasing it will offer “additional ways of playing with unique rewards.” 


MultiVersus was first launched in open beta last May and pits characters across Warner Bros. stable of IPs, such as DC, Looney Tunes, and even Game of Thrones, in a tag-team-focused twist of Super Smash Bros. inspired combat. The game was initially quite popular and generally well-liked. Writer Bryan Vore gave the game’s beta incarnation an 8 out of 10 in our review, writing that “Living games have the potential to go in frustrating directions, but MultiVersus has a strong foundation. If it can meaningfully roll out content and smooth out its rough edges, this could become a new crossover obsession for years to come.” 
Unfortunately, months of infrequent updates and lack of communication following the game’s second season saw engagement decline. Player First Games pulled MultiVersus from stores to address these criticisms. When the game returns, it will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

                              <span>It seems only fitting that Ghostbusters has become the movie franchise that refuses to die, returning for a smattering of so-so (at best) reboots and sequels on screen and elsewhere being relegated to another rich vein of nostalgia to be mined for cash. Speaking of, Destiny 2 is getting Ghostbusters cosmetics next week!

                              <span>Despite being the game that pioneered and popularised the battle royale shooter, it seems that PUBG: Battlegrounds has increasingly ended up left in the shadow cast by Fortnite’s ridiculous popularity, Lego and Eminem collabs, and big, flashy season changes. It seems that the earlier battle royale game is planning to borrow at least one leaf from its rival’s playbook this year, though.

That’s going by recent comments by producer Naoki Yoshida, who also suggested we can expect a demo before it’s out - which should also be a good chance to test your rig against its apparently hefty hardware requirements.

                              <span>I didn&#x27;t really know anything about Moomins going into adventure game Snufkin: Melody Of Moominvalley, besides that their heads always looked palatable to me - like bleached kidney beans. Plus the Moomin merch I&#x27;d seen over the years in official Moomin shops or the odd gift store was delightful, so if someone had rocked up with a pencil case adorned with Moomin heads back in school, you bet I would&#x27;ve been jealous.
And having finished the game, I&#x27;m unsure whether I&#x27;ve truly learned any more about the Moomins and their friends. But then again, I&#x27;ve come away thinking that it&#x27;s a pleasant universe to spend a few hours in, where the wild is celebrated with rebellious song. If you&#x27;re after the video game equivalent of a walk through the woods on a warm afternoon, Moominvalley is the place to wander.

                              <span>The USTR recently asked the International Intellectual Property Alliance to elaborate on why &quot;recent positions&quot; vocalized by Brazil&#x27;s Ministry of Culture and cinema regulator ANCINE, were a cause for concern. IIPA said there was an implied bias towards the protection of domestic content, leaving U.S. content unprotected. In Brazil, a deal between MPA and ANCINE was effectively torn up for allegedly prioritizing U.S. content over that produced locally in Brazil.

                              <span>For the 17th time, ScummVM has again been accepted for the Google Summer of Code program this summer.
The program intends to bring new contributors into open source projects. In the most recent two years this has included both students and non-students as eligible candidates for participation.
Like last year, participants can apply for working on either short tasks (about 175 hours of work), or large tasks (about 350 hours of work). The coding period typically runs from start of June through August, but there is some flexibility which allows participants to have longer time frames if they are unable to work full time through the summer.
ScummVM is looking for people interested in participating in GSoC with us. A list of suggested projects can be found on this page, but we are also open to your own ideas as well. Please provide the required information in your application before submitting.
We also strongly encourage you to join our Discord server, in the #scummvm-gsoc channel. This allows you to engage with our mentors and the rest of the team, to get advice about how to get involved with the project, as well as writing your application.
Based on our previous 16 years of experience with GSoC, we have put together a Google Summer of Code miniportal to help you get started.
Looking forward to hearing from you!

                              <span>If you don’t know me, I’m Owen Rudge, and have been involved in the online Transport Tycoon community for almost 25 years. Exactly 21 years ago, I received an ICQ message (look it up, kids) out of the blue from a guy named Ludvig Strigeus (nicknamed Ludde). “Hello, you probably don’t know me, but I’ve been working on a project to clone TTD for a while.” he said, more or less. He didn’t want to release this to the public yet, and wasn’t entirely sure what he was going to do with it. (He’d been working on it since 30th June 2002, so I guess that is technically the birthday of what would become OpenTTD…) Ludde sent me a copy of what he’d been working on, and it was very exciting indeed. It was a fully functional version of Transport Tycoon Deluxe, written in C. Admittedly incomplete at that time, it was still quite remarkable.</span>

                              <span>OpenTTD 14.0 comes with a new ship pathfinder which allows ships to travel great distances without the use of buoys. Gone are the days of long strings of buoys and convoluted ship orders. Using ships is now as hassle-free as the other modes of transport. Just add the destination and send the ship on its way! In this post, I’m going to explain how the new pathfinder works and some of the challenges we had to overcome.</span>
