PRIX, the artsy clothing company owned by influential NZ designer Esther NG, has produced a line of clothing replicating the super-iconic &quot;Player 2&quot; look sported by King in Tekken 3 — Quite understandably, the line sold out almost immediately, because why wouldn&#x27;t it?
The famous fit — first sported by the mysterious grappler King II in Tekken&#x27;s highly acclaimed second sequel — consists of a pair of blue/grey and leopard print track pants, and a matching blue/grey shirt, emblazoned with the declaration &quot;Mishima Zaibatsu EVIL&quot;. King rounds off the look with a similarly colored variant of his Jaguar mask and a massive pair of white running shoes. Over the following years, the look has become something of a meme icon among the Tekken community.

Yesterday, PRIX launched replica designs of both the track pants and the shirt, both priced at $70. A form-fitting, long sleeve variant of the shirt was also available at $60. Of course, there was a wild rush on these fashion-forward items, resulting in a total sell-out of the pants, as well as most of the shirt inventory clearing out double-time. There is currently a waiting list available on site for those hoping to jump on any possible re-order.
In addition to the King gear, PRIX also released a line of T-shirts featuring renders of characters from Tekken 3. Again, these items are mostly long gone, with only Extra Small-to-Small sizes still available at the time of writing. You can check out the entire range over on the PRIX website.
Congratulations to the lucky buyers. I hope that you&#x27;re practicing your standing moonsault as we speak.
Tekken 8 launches on PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X later in 2023.

Some good news for fans of Netflix&#x27; Sonic Prime series, as the team behind the colorful animated show has announced that further adventures featuring Sonic the Hedgehog and his dopey friends are currently in production — tentatively expected to air later in 2023.
Premiering just last month, Sonic Prime is a multi-part series that sees The Blue Blur thrust into a strange multiverse environment, where he encounters multiple versions of popular characters such as Tails, Knuckles, Rogue, Amy Rose, and a plethora — a council, even — of extra evil Dr. Robotniks. The first episode premiered on the Roblox platform on December 10, with the 10-episode saga debuting on Netflix proper on December 15.

No further details were announced regarding the new episodes. The tweet did not confirm whether this was classed as a &quot;second season&quot;, nor whether the show will be returning to the Netflix streaming service. But we&#x27;ll be sure to give you a heads-up when the talented animation squad behind the series has more information to offer.
The debut of Sonic Prime rounded off a pretty eventful year for the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise, with the past 12 months also seeing the release of remaster Sonic Origins, open-world adventure Sonic Frontiers, and the hugely successful cinematic sequel Sonic the Hedgehog 2. In a statement made last month, Team Sonic president Takashi Iizuka opined that 2022 was &quot;The biggest year in Sonic history.&quot;
Sonic Prime is available to watch now on Netflix.

                              <span>Multiplayer battler identified as one of three canned titles
Ubisoft has confirmed that its online hero battler, tentatively known as &quot;Project Q&quot; is one of the three games that has had production halted in the wake of a financially unsuccessful year for the publisher.
In a statement made to Eurogamer this morning, an Ubisoft spokesperson confirmed that the Project Q development team was being reassigned to other endeavors/projects within the studio, effectively canceling any further progress on the PvP shooter, which was first announced in April 2022. The only public assets for Project Q to date consists of a single piece of splash art, alongside Ubisoft&#x27;s insistence that the game was not a battle royale title, nor was it an NFT project.
https://twitter.com/Ubisoft/status/1517896643345108995?s&#x3D;20&amp;t&#x3D;0HlH-rOUpJIzl2GDQbcOuw
Ubisoft announced last week that it was canceling three in-development titles, along with yet another delay for its pirate-based adventure Skull &amp; Bones. These announcements were reportedly accompanied by an email to staff from Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot, whose comments have seemingly formed the basis for a staff walkout, to be held at the Ubisoft Paris studio on January 27.
&quot;On several occasions, Mr. Guillemot is trying to shift the blame (once again) onto the employees; he expects us to be mobilized, to ‘give it our all,’ to be ‘as efficient and lean as possible‘,&quot; wrote union Solidaires Informatique of the email. &quot;These words mean something: overtime, managerial pressure, burnout, etc. Mr. Guillemot asks a lot from his employees, but without any compensation.&quot;
&quot;And because Mr. Guillemot and his clique only understand the relationship of power, Solidaires Informatique is calling on the employees of Ubisoft Paris to go on strike.&quot;

Google&#x27;s beleaguered cloud gaming service, Stadia, is officially no more — The big red button was hit on the servers last night at 23:59 PT / 02:59 ET / 07:59 BT, bringing to an end a costly experiment that on paper had some interesting and engaging concepts, that simply didn&#x27;t translate into real, financially successful benefits for the internet giant.

Launching on November 19, 2020, Google Stadia was an endeavor to make a massive library of online games available to players all over the world, accessible via cloud streaming and playable on practically any screen that could be connected to the internet. All a Stadia user would need was a controller and a Stadia subscription.

If you can&#x27;t get enough of some creepy clowns, you&#x27;re in for a treat — a new trailer for the Killer Klowns from Outer Space: The Game just dropped, and it&#x27;s got all the spooky, grotesque weirdness we&#x27;ve come to love and expect from such an IP. The 50-second teaser doesn&#x27;t give much of anything in terms of gameplay footage, but it does introduce us to the cast of Killer Klowns in the game&#x27;s lineup (hence why it&#x27;s titled &quot;Meet the Klowns&quot;). This trailer gets us up close and personal so we can get a better look at the Klowns&#x27; character models, as well as their weapons — one of which is the iconic popcorn gun from the 1988 film.
This is our first in-depth look at the gameplay classes of Klowns players will face up against in the game, whose names are Trapster, …</span>

The fan-made battle simulator, Pokémon Showdown, isn&#x27;t a new site despite some recent popularity. According to the creator&#x27;s resume, the project got its start in 2011. Created by Guangcong Luo and sponsored by Smogon University, the site allows around 10,000 concurrent users to create a team and battle strangers for free. With over a million visitors per month, Pokémon Showdown seems to be doing well. If you&#x27;re jonesing for anything Pokémon, then here&#x27;s how you can get started with the unofficial, browser-based game.
When you head over to pokemonshowdown.com, there is an embedded YouTube video that sells you the founding premise of the site. Instead of following all of the steps to get to a battle while playing the official Pokémon games, you can skip straig…</span>

                              <span>More information is coming out about how these layoffs will hit Xbox studios
Microsoft confirmed earlier today that it will be laying off 10,000 employees. Reports have since circulated about how those layoffs affect studios within Microsoft, including those behind some big Xbox games.
Bloomberg reports that the Microsoft layoffs have affected workers at both 343 Industries and Bethesda, according to their sources. The scale of the cuts is not clear, but Bloomberg&#x27;s report notes that some of those affected include longtime Xbox veterans, who have been at the company for over a decade. In a follow-up tweet, Bloomberg&#x27;s Jason Schreier says it sounds like the Halo Infinite team got &quot;hit hard,&quot; citing an email to staff from 343 head Pierre Hintze.
Kotaku also reports that 343 and Bethesda were affected, as well as Gears developer The Coalition.
In addition to layoffs, it seems like movement is also being made around 343 Industries. Schreier reports that Joseph Staten, who was brought on to help bring Halo Infinite development to a close, is leaving 343 to return to Xbox Publishing.
More details have been emerging throughout the day about how these cuts have affected Microsoft.
A shift for Xbox
In a public letter addressing the cuts today, CEO Satya Nadella confirms the 10,000 layoffs will take place from now through Q3 of fiscal year 2023. The news arrives one year after Microsoft announced its plan to purchase Activision Blizzard, a deal which is currently caught up with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.
The post Bethesda, 343 among studios reportedly affected by Microsoft layoffs appeared first on Destructoid.</span>

A first-person shooter where instead of killing your enemies you are giving them a stylish makeover is a brilliant idea on its own, but when you throw in the ability to swing around your environment — à la Spider-Man — from a designer belt, this becomes a concept like no other. Developed by the small team at Mopeful Games, Fashion Police Squad is bringing all of this to the Switch when it sashays its way onto the console on 2nd February.
This is a game that will see you take to the streets of Trendopolis and set out on a mission to solve the city&#x27;s fashion crimes. There&#x27;s excessively baggy trousers, poorly-fitting suits, vests and jeans — welcome to the early 2000s folks! Fashion Police Squad (or &#x27;FPS&#x27;, see what they did there?) is a non-violent take on the first-person shooter, because what if all that bad guys really needed was a new wardrobe?

Ahead of the game&#x27;s official release tomorrow, Nintendo has released the customary day one patch for Fire Emblem Engage. The Big N has also shared the brief patch notes over on its website (thanks, Nintendo Everything!).
Like most day one updates, this one preps the game for full online functionality including the Expansion Pass, a link to the eShop, and a free bonus that players can get in Somniel after chapter 5.

The sequel to the 2017 action-adventure Figment is coming to Switch later this year, bringing with it a new co-op mode that will encourage players to discuss mental health with their loved ones.
Figment 2: Creed Valley is a surreal action-adventure that takes you deep into the human psyche, in a world shattered by Nightmares. Protagonist Dusty and his sidekick Piper must journey into The Mind to heal it and allow it to function properly once more, by solving puzzles and defeating the Nightmares in musical showdowns.

Fire Emblem Engage (Nintendo, 20th Jan, $59.99) - Team up with iconic heroes from past Fire Emblem games and add their power to yours in this new Fire Emblem story! Legendary heroes called Emblems grant incredible power to the one who holds the 12 Emblem Rings. However, the Fell Dragon and ancient nemesis of the Divine Dragon has risen and seeks the rings for his own evil gain. Command the army of the Divine Dragon through turn-based battles across the continent and bring peace back to Elyos. Each battle is different, requiring its own strategy and approach. Plan attacks carefully when commanding each hero with their own moves and weapons while using the terrain, positioning and unique talents of the heroes to defeat the enemy across the grid-based battlefield. Tailor your experience with a range of difficulty and game modes suited for all skill levels. Casual Mode sees fallen allies revived after a battle, while they’ll be lost forever when using Classic Mode. If you make a major error in combat, use the Draconic Time Crystal to rewind and try again, in any mode! The Fire Emblem Engage game will be available on Jan. 20. - Read our Fire Emblem Engage review

The latest Japanese charts are in from Famitsu and this time we are seeing a return to the kind of numbers that we would expect after last week&#x27;s figures accounted for a longer period of time.
As usual, this is a big one for Nintendo. The software sales are still all about Pokémon Scarlet and Violet despite a strong first week from the PS4/5 title One Piece Odyssey. This means that the latest Pokémon entry has secured its top spot for an impressive nine weeks, racking up a huge 4,695,052 total sales!

We love playing video games. It can be a mode of escape, a time to relax, a story to get deep into, or something to stimulate the mind. But the fact of the matter is, we also hate playing video games. They can be really hard, we lose unfairly, a mechanic doesn&#x27;t sit right, or we forget to save.
Of course, these frustrations are never permanent (isn&#x27;t that what keeps us coming back, after all?), but this doesn&#x27;t make them any less annoying. Sometimes we really need to complete a certain task to move on with the game and other times it is all about our own sanity: &quot;I have to overcome this obstacle/defeat this boss/find this item before I can put it down.&quot;

We always want more games to feature watercolour-esque or hand-drawn visuals, and Helvetii — an upcoming action game from Team KwaKwa (developers of Soup Raiders) — looks like it&#x27;s going to give us our fix. And we won&#x27;t have to wait long, as the game hits the Switch eShop on 3rd February!
Inspired by Vanillaware&#x27;s stunning art style (we&#x27;re definitely getting some Muramasa vibes from this), Helvetii is a 2D action roguelite that&#x27;s based on the Gaulish Helvetii tribes. In Celtic history, the Helvetii were people who were driven from southern Germany to the north — an area that we now know as Switzerland (via Britannica).

Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot has reportedly apologised to staff for a recent comment in which he stated that &quot;the ball is in your court&quot; regarding getting the major publisher back on track.
As reported by Kotaku, Guillemot took part in a company-wide Q&amp;A session with Ubisoft staff and opened the meeting by apologising for his previous comment, stating “I heard your feedback and I’m sorry this was perceived that way&quot;. The apology was alleged in response to an up-voted question which read “the ball is now in our court—for years it has been in your court so why did you mishandle the ball so badly so we, the workers, have to fix it for you?”.

Digital Eclipse has dropped the first patch for Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration on all platforms, which includes lots of bug fixes, gameplay tweaks, and menu additions.
The developer shared the update on the game&#x27;s Steam page (via Nintendo Everything), and while many of the tweaks are PC-specific, there are lots of little things for us retro enthusiasts on Switch to get excited about. The biggest one that caught our eye is that we can now access DIP switches from the Game Options menu for most arcade games. Also, Atari Jaguar&#x27;s Tempest 2000 will now be playable at 60 fps!

                              <span>Are we barking up the wrong tree?
It has been 12 long years since we last heard the infamous instructions of &quot;Lucky, Daisy, Baxter&quot; while we sat in a completely sound-proofed room attempting to teach our dog its name in the 3DS&#x27; Nintendogs + Cats. Of course, this followed the six-year wait after the release of the original Nintendogs on the DS — a watershed moment where a huge number of us spent each day walking, cleaning and playing with the virtual pups. And now, it looks like there might be more dog content from Nintendo to come.
A recent patent, dated 17th January 2023 and originally filed for in November 2021, seems to suggest that Nintendo is working on a new way to bring the world of virtual dogs back into our homes (thanks, My Nintendo News). This time around, the technology all seems to be about augmented reality and the ability to place a virtual object (a dog, in the example given) into a real-world environment as captured through a camera.

Sting, the developer behind the Dept. Heaven games such as Riviera: The Promised Land, Yggdra Union, and Knights in the Nightmare, is bringing back Dokapon Kingdom for the Switch. This news came from an early Famitsu scoop yesterday from @gamenohanshi (via @gosokkyu), with Famitsu confirming the news later.
Released on the PS2 in 2007 before coming to the Wii in 2008, this board game RPG will be launching on Switch in Japan as Dokapon Kingdom: Connect on 13th April 2023. Sadly, a Western release date has yet to be announced — but we&#x27;re hoping! (Even though we&#x27;ve also been praying for that Knights in the Nightmare rerelease to make its way here...)

The first season of Sonic Prime launched on Netflix at the end of last year with an eight-episode run. If you&#x27;re ready for another serving of the blue blur, the good news is there&#x27;s more on the way.
In a brief message on social media, Sega has teased &quot;more Sonic Prime&quot; will be coming at some point in 2023. The first season saw Sonic and the rest of his crew going on a &quot;high-octane adventure&quot; in a strange new multiverse.

EA Sports has been producing officially licensed PGA Tour video games since 1990, with stars like Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy lending their names to the product over the years. However, the company has not released a PGA Tour video game since 2015, meaning other franchises have had time to slide into the space once occupied by EA Sports’ mainstay series.
However, EA Sports is ready to make up for lost time with its newest title. The emphasis this time around is on realism, not only with how the players and courses look but also in how players must approach every hole. For starters, each of the 30 launch courses was created with the help of the course superintendents, state-of-the-art technology (including helicopte…</span>

                              <span>A Ubisoft game known as Project Q leaked early last year before the Assassin&#x27;s Creed maker revealed its existence, calling it a team-based battle arena combat game. 
Insider Gaming reported yesterday that Ubisoft had canceled Project Q and now, Ubisoft has confirmed that this is, in fact, true to Video Games Chronicle. 
&quot;We can confirm we will no longer support the development of Project Q in order to focus on priority projects, to which our teams are being reallocated,&quot; Ubisoft told VGC. 
This cancelation comes after Ubisoft delayed Skull and Bones last week alongside news that it had canceled three unannounced games. It&#x27;s currently unclear if Project Q was one of those three games canceled (while Project Q was technically announced, it was revealed as an in-the-works project rather than a game with a final title so perhaps Ubisoft considered it unannounced).

                              <span>Pokémon Scarlet and Violet arrived on Switch last November, and the Pokémon Trading Card Game is ready to leave Galar for the open world of Paldea. That first Scarlet and Violet expansion arrives this March (alongside various changes, including a price increase), but first, we have one more Sword and Shield expansion to get to.
Pokémon Trading Card Game: Sword &amp; Shield – Crown Zenith, out this week, adds more than 160 new cards, including 3 new Radiant Pokémon, five Pokémon VMax cards, eight Pokémon VStar cards, and 70 cards with special Galarian Gallery artwork. The Pokémon Company sent over some of the products in this special expansion, and we cracked them to see what we could pull.
Though I&#x27;m frustrated you can&#x27;t buy these as individual booster packs (they&#x27;re only available in larger packs like the Elite Trainer Box and special collections), I absolutely love several of the cards I pulled. In particular, the full-art cards are absolutely striking. I&#x27;m very happy with the Radiant Charizard, and the Pikachu and Lucario cards might be among my favorites of those respective Pokémon. You can see the full gallery below.

Pokémon Trading Card Game: Sword &amp; Shield – Crown Zenith arrives starting on January 20 with the Elite Trainer Box and Collections starring Regieleki V or Regidrago V. New Tins and Collections will arrive through May. For all things Pokémon Trading Card Game, head to our special hub by clicking the banner below!</span>

The company hasn&#x27;t revealed exact numbers and specific departments regarding the layoffs yet, but some employees at Bethesda Game Studios, which is hard at work getting Starfield ready for its release this year, were laid off. According to a Bloomberg report, though, Halo Infinite developer 343 Industries was hit hardest by the layoffs. Again, neither Microsoft nor 343 Industries has revealed an exact number but based on industry discussion online, it seems like the studio lost quite a lot of people.

                              <span>Microsoft has laid off 10,000 employees. 
This news comes from a Bloomberg report detailing that Microsoft&#x27;s layoff come as the company attempts to reduce costs amid a larger economic slowdown. These layoffs come amidst Microsoft&#x27;s ongoing fight against the FTC to acquire Call of Duty makers Activision Blizzard for a staggering $69 billion. Bloomberg reports that some people at Bethesda Game Studios, which is hard at work on getting Starfield ready for its release sometime in the first half of this year, were laid off, but that Halo Infinite developer 343 Industries was hit hardest in the company&#x27;s portfolio of game studios. 
According to Bloomberg, Microsoft has plans to hire in &quot;strategic, competitive areas&quot; like AI but that other tech-focused departments like HoloLens and some engineering divisions were hit by these layoffs. 
Microsoft has not yet revealed exact numbers and specific departments surrounding this massive wave of layoffs. Another tech giant, Amazon, is in the middle of its own string of layoffs as the company aims to reduce its workforce by 18,000. 
The hearts of Game Informer&#x27;s staff are with all those who were affected by these layoffs.

                              <span>There’s a lot I’m excited for in Tchia. Revealed at the Game Awards back in 2020, the trailer boasted a whole load of activities: sailing, climbing, ukelele playing, swimming, tree-hopping, slingshot sharpshooting, totem carving, gliding - the list is never ending - and all set on a beautiful island with characters to talk to, quests to complete, and enemies to fight. And on top of all that, you also have the ability to &quot;soul-jump&quot; letting you control any animal or object.
It sounds too good to be true, right? But two years after Awaceb&#x27;s trailer debut, I’ve gotten my hands on a preview build to see whether a nine-person dev team’s tropical island exploration game is pie in the sky. Turns out, it’s the opposite; my hands on time suggests Tchia will deliver on everything it promised and more.

                              <span>The CEO of Ubisoft has apologised to staff for comments he made in an email last week, which appeared to blame employees for cuts and delays at the publisher. Kotaku report that Yves Guillemot began a Q&amp;A meeting with an apology for his suggestion that sorting out issues at Ubisoft was the responsibility of lower-level staff, summarised by the phrase “the ball is in your court”. Guillemot had come under fire from Ubisoft staff following his comments, which prompted calls from one French union for Ubisoft Paris staff to strike later this month.

And that&#x27;s thanks to a new trailer where Kiryu/Ryoma drop (kicks) his bruising samurai lifestyle to the side for a simpler, purer existence: chopping spring onions to a rhythm in what looks to be an in-depth farming side activity. Game Of The Year.

                              <span>Microsoft has announced mass layoffs that will affect the developers behind Starfield, Halo Infinite, and Gears Of War. Bloomberg report that it’s not yet known what the scale of the job losses at Bethesda and 343 Industries will be, and Kotaku has also confirmed that The Coalition will also lose staff. Sources claim that some of the staff who’d lost their jobs at the affected studios were veterans who’d been with Microsoft for more than a decade. This layoff announcement from Microsoft has been made exactly a year after the company revealed they were buying Activision Blizzard.

That&#x27;s the case today with this deal on a 32GB dual-channel kit of DDR5-6000 from TeamGroup, specifically their T-Force Delta RGB RAM. It&#x27;s been reduced from its ridiculous launch MSRP of $339.99 down to $149.99, a great price for this spec and especially for a kit that comes equipped with RGB lighting. 
(If you&#x27;d prefer the same kit without RGB, then it can be yours for $133.)

                              <span>A few days ago, GitHub disabled the domain of a Pirate Bay Proxy information portal following a DMCA notice sent by City of London Police. The operator of the site is unhappy with the removal. In a DMCA counternotice, GitHub is asked to reinstate the domain since it doesn&#x27;t link to any infringing material. According to the counternotice, the police don&#x27;t seem to understand how the site works.

                              <span>Ubisoft hasn’t had the best couple of years. A string of flops and disappointments means the company isn’t in the best shape as it heads into 2023, so in an attempt to get everyone firing last week CEO Yves Guillemot sent an email to staff telling them “The ball is in your court”. It did not go down well.

                              <span>What other iconic Square Enix landmarks should PowerWash Simulator clean up next?
PowerWash Simulator has been a sleeper hit for the better part of a year, and it&#x27;s only gaining steam. I myself am something of a power washing enthusiast, of which there are whole communities out there, so this sim is right up my alley. The game already has hours of satisfying cleaning content, but along with the announcement that PowerWash Simulator is coming to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Nintendo Switch, Square Enix also announced that they&#x27;re dropping a Tomb Raider expansion to boot. The free update will be available to players at 9 am EST / 12 pm PST / 5 pm GMT on January 31, 2023.

&quot;You’ve cleaned a bungalow, a cottage, even a tree-house,&quot; says a blog from developer FuturLab, &quot;but how about a manor?&quot; That&#x27;s right, the new location in need of a powerful wash will be none other than Croft Manor from the famed Tomb Raider series. Not only will the update include a new map to take on, but it will also come with &quot;an all-new mini campaign, with a short story and five new levels.&quot;
PowerWash Simulator, is also coming to PlayStation 4/5 consoles and the Nintendo Switch for the first time, in addition to its launch platforms on PC, Xbox One, and Xbox series X/S. Unfortunately there won&#x27;t be any crossplay for PlayStation consoles or the Switch, but crossplay will still work between Xbox consoles and PC.

                              <span>The alchemy will take a bit longer
The next installment in the Atelier Ryza series is taking just a little bit more time to get it right. Koei Tecmo and the Atelier team are pushing the launch date of Atelier Ryza 3: Alchemist of the End &amp; the Secret Key back one month.
This moves the Atelier Ryza 3 launch to March 24, 2023, just one month removed from its previous February 24 date. In a statement on the shift, producer Junzo Hosoi says that in order to make this a &quot;fitting finale&quot; for Ryza and friends, the team has taken on challenges like a vast open field and more expressive graphics.
&quot;Our team will take this additional time to fine-tune the final touches so that we can deliver to all of you who have been following the series for the best possible experience in this culmination of Ryza and her friend&#x27;s adventures,&quot; said Hosoi. &quot;We are making the game even better to make it worth your wait, so we appreciate your patience for just a little bit more until the game&#x27;s release.&quot;
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;qDG_g2tcsNY
Atelier Ryza 3 will cap off the Ryza series, with a note on the site saying this is Ryza&#x27;s &quot;final summer adventure&quot; with one final secret. It seems like the Atelier team wants to make sure the ending comes together well.
After the summer is gone
One month is not much in the grand scheme of things, and certainly not much compared to other game delays. And if the extra time means the Atelier studio can get everything right, that&#x27;s a good thing.
The one troublesome note is that Atelier Ryza 3 now launches on the same day as the remake of Resident Evil 4. But its previous date was also in contention with another game, and inside its own genre at that, with Octopath Traveler II. Really, there&#x27;s little chance of having a big week to yourself in 2023, as a bunch of games are already slated to launch in the first quarter of the year.

One Piece Odyssey is a very easy game. There&#x27;s a good reason for that - despite its frequently thoughtful writing and near-constant horniness, One Piece is ultimately a series aimed at children. It makes sense that a One Piece video game would try its best to remain accessible to its younger audience.
It also makes sense for older fans to hear &quot;comically easy turn-based game&quot; and immediately reach for the auto-battle button. Luckily, One Piece Odyssey has a great auto-battle system. As long as you&#x27;re not actively avoiding combat, the computer will probably be able to get you through most fights (bosses included) without issue.

                              <span>Man, that&#x27;s a lot of 2&#x27;s
[Update: This morning, the official Call of Duty Twitter released an update stating that Season 2 for both Warzone 2.0 and MWII will be dropping on February 15. Warzone 2.0 will see the return of Resurgence and will also get a &quot;brand new small map,&quot; while MWII will get some &quot;new multiplayer maps, new modes, weapons and much more.&quot;]
Call of Duty fans have been anxiously awaiting Warzone 2.0 and Modern Warfare II&#x27;s second season, but based on some new info, it looks like they&#x27;re going to have to wait a couple more weeks. Neither Activision nor Infinity Ward have officially announced any dates yet regarding the new season, but fans have surmised that the release date was supposed to be February 1 by looking at the days left on the Season 1 battle pass.
Based on a tweet from known data miner CODSploitz, Season 2 will allegedly drop on or around February 15. By mining for the dates of the last Season 1 bundle, CODSploitz claims to have found that the final Scavenger bundle will be available in the store from February 2-15 -- hence the supposed Season 2 delay to that date, or sometime after it. CODSploitz&#x27;s predictions have been right in the past, so we&#x27;ll have to see if this one helps or hurts his track record when Season 2 finally drops.

The last major update we saw for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II came in the form of Season 1 Reloaded from back in December. That update came with bug fixes, which added the Chimera assault rifle, the brand new Raid mode, and my personal favorite, the Shipment 6v6 multiplayer map. There&#x27;s been some speculation that Season 2 will bring another new Raid episode, but other than that, the second season will likely be full of surprises.

The era of Monster Hunter madness continues, as publisher Capcom has announced that the Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak expansion has now surpassed five million total sales on PC and Nintendo Switch.
Released in June 2022 for both Nintendo Switch and the then-debuting PC port of Monster Hunter Rise, the Sunbreak DLC brought with it the epic &quot;Journey to the West&quot; story expansion, along with a huge litany of new locations and both new and classic monsters pulled from the long, long legacy of the Monster Hunter franchise, such as the terrifying flying wyvern, Astalos. The Sunbreak expansion enhanced Monster Hunter Rise&#x27;s combat mechanics for smoother, more exciting beast battles.

Accompanying a lovely piece of artwork — posted to Twitter to commemorate the Sunbreak sales announcement — Capcom noted that it would be producing a special in-game pack for all players to celebrate hitting the five million milestone. We can likely expect more details on this DLC in the coming weeks. The success of Sunbreak only cements the incredible global growth of the Monster Hunter brand in the past five years, initially driven by the staggering worldwide success of 2018&#x27;s Monster Hunter World which remains as of this writing, the best-selling Capcom release of all-time.
Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak is available now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch.

                              <span>The Telegraph will spotlight what&#x27;s next for SteamWorld
The team behind the genre-spanning SteamWorld line of games is planning a special broadcast. The SteamWorld Telegraph: Special Broadcast will show what&#x27;s next for the crew on January 23.
The special broadcast will take place at 9:30 a.m. PT / 12:30 p.m. ET on January 23, 2023. There&#x27;s no note yet of where this will stream, but a link will be shared on the SteamWorld social account when that&#x27;s ready to be announced.

As for the content, it doesn&#x27;t seem like anything specific has been teased just yet. The team has apparently been looking around at a bevvy of projects, and we&#x27;ll just have to wait until Monday to see what exactly the studio is doing next.
A whole new (steam) world
Thunderful has been working on the SteamWorld series for years, stretching back to early games like SteamWorld Tower Defense and what many might consider its breakout, SteamWorld Dig. Several more SteamWorld games followed, ranging from the tactical Heist and deckbuilding Quest to another Dig. And, also, The Gunk. Not sure if that one ties into the SteamWorld universe or not, to be honest.
Either way, the Thunderful crew has made some wonderful games that have jumped across genres in the past. The past report from Thunderful included several different possibilities, ranging from SteamWorld Headhunter to a city-builder, turn-based game, and puzzle game. We&#x27;ll see what new horizons the SteamWorld team is pursuing on Monday.

                              <span>The first event kicks off on January 27
Did you get your Charizard or Cinderace yet? While those events are in the rear view mirror (hopefully we get info soon on how others can get them in the future), there&#x27;s another one coming up, as per The Pokemon Company. Yep, Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet players will be able to catch a special Greninja in January via the Tera Raid mechanic.
Just like the previous Charizard and Cinderace events, the following parameters will apply:
You can only catch one Greninja per save file (but you can repeat the encounter as many times as you want for rewards)
It&#x27;ll be a Poison Tera Type, in a 7-star raid
The event will take place over the course of two weekends, so if you miss one or aren&#x27;t ready for 7-Star Tera Raids, you have a second chance
Like the prior two events, you will likely be able to create eggs for the entire Greninja evolutionary line, starting with Froakie (so while you can only &quot;catch&quot; one, you can keep breeding them, if history repeats itself)
Here are when the Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet Greninja events start:
January 27-January 28, 2023
February 10-February 12, 2023
As a reminder, make sure you prep for 6-star Tera Raids before this date, as you&#x27;ll need to complete that quest path to unlock 7-star raids. We have a comprehensive guide on how to get that done in a reasonable amount of time here! While the Charizard and Cinderace events were cutting things a little close for casual players, at this point a lot of you are probably at the finish line for high-end raids: you just need to cross it.

                              <span>Let&#x27;s do the time warp again... and again... and...
Sony Interactive Entertainment and developer Housemarque have finally announced a release date for the PC edition of the dazzling PS5 sci-fi adventure, Returnal — The chrono-chaotic shooter will arrive on the Steam platform on February 15.
In addition, Housemarque released the PC requirements necessary in order to get Selene&#x27;s incredibly visual, effects-laden odyssey up and running on your rig. The specifications range from &quot;Minimum&quot; (720p at 60FPS) to a top-tier &quot;Ray-Tracing&quot; bracket (4K at 60FPS with enhanced reflections and shadows).
For those yet to experience Returnal, it showcases Housemarque&#x27;s trademark flashy, firework-like visual aesthetic, as well as fast-paced and incredibly &quot;busy&quot; on-screen action. As such, the true wonder of its (literal) death-defying tale of identity and destiny, all set against the backdrop of a massive alien world, understandably requires a decent amount of juice in its myriad gas tanks.
Returnal launches February 15 on PC (Steam). It is also available right now on PS5.

If you’re like me, the question on your mind is, “What are we doing here?” Not in an existentialist sense, but rather, why is this not Persona 3 FES? Why the PSP version? Unlike the philosophical question of our purpose, there probably is a good answer for why we’re getting Persona 3 Portable instead of one of its console kin, but we don’t really know it. There have been theories about the Persona 3 FES code being a mess or having been lost, but that’s exactly what I hear every time there’s a poor or missing port. Then there’s the rumor that Persona 3 is being remade, which I also doubt, but maybe.
In any case, here we are: Persona 3 Portable on console and PC.
The worst part about the whole experience is that I’m constantly wondering what I’m doing on this version and whether or…</span>

Microsoft is laying off 10,000 employees between now and the end of Q3 in fiscal year 2023. The cuts were announced today as part of a broader shift looking towards its future.
In a public letter from Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, the reduction is confirmed to be &quot;less than 5%&quot; of Microsoft&#x27;s total employee workforce. The layoffs will happen between and now the end of Q3 2023, with some notifications going out to employees today.
No specific departments were highlighted in Nadella&#x27;s letter. The CEO does write that Microsoft will continue hiring in &quot;key strategic areas&quot; even as other roles are eliminated.
Additionally, the company will take on a $1.2 billion charge in Q2 related to its severance costs, lease consolidation, and change…</span>

                              <span>The Industrial Revolution hits the ninth generation
Ubisoft has announced that its celebrated grand strategy title Anno 1800 is finally ready to set sail onto console platforms, following on from its PC release back in the spring of 2019. It will launch on PS5 and Xbox Series X on March 16, priced at around $40. Pre-orders are now live on PSN and Microsoft Store.
Anno 1800 is a real-time-strategy city-builder, set against the backdrop of the industrial revolution of the 19th century. Players are tasked with the micro-management of citizens, factories, economies, tourism, and the overall maintenance of industry, residential life, and local politics, guiding the people and politics of the 1800s into what would come to be known as &quot;The New World&quot;.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;9p1TDbV0gBA&amp;ab_channel&#x3D;Ubisoft
Anno 1800 offers up several ways to play, from single-player stories and multiplayer PvP, to an hour-eating sandbox mode, which allows you to build your own empire unencumbered by interference or regulation. Online co-op is also available, allowing you and a friend to build an economically viable new world together. Additionally, players can send voyages across the seven seas to discover new produce, technologies, and people, further enriching the environment and industry back home, and expanding your burgeoning empire into bold new horizons.
Anno 1800: Console Edition launches on PS5 and Xbox Series X on March 16. Pre-order customers will receive an in-game bonus in the form of a digital artbook, digital soundtrack, and access to the &quot;Imperial&quot; and &quot;Founders&quot; DLC packages, which will include &quot;Cosmetic Bonuses&quot;. Additionally, a Deluxe Edition, retailing for around $50, includes further cosmetic expansions &quot;The Pedestrian Zone&quot;, &quot;The Amusements Pack&quot; and &quot;Vibrant Cities.&quot;

Fire Emblem Engage is out on January 20, and I can&#x27;t wait until everyone rushes in and the impressions start flying out. Fire Emblem games have waltzed with relationship aspects for some time now, and although some folks have gotten used to them, others have rebuked the mechanic. Since Engage is heavily going to cater to the latter category, it&#x27;s bound to get a wide variety of reactions.
For now, there&#x27;s this gigantic eight minute trailer from Nintendo that might help you decide whether or not this entry is for you. Given that this trailer is all gameplay pretty much, it&#x27;s a great thing to watch before you decide to drop $60 on it.

                              <span>Look for the light — a recap of The Last of Us&#x27; premiere episode
HBO&#x27;s adaptation of the beloved narrative game The Last of Us has been highly anticipated for months and even years — either by fans of the series or otherwise. Now that it&#x27;s finally out, the takes have started rolling in, and the first episode has been a bit more divisive among fans than the early, glowing critic reviews suggested. This first installment covered the opening few hours of the game, from its emotional opening to the crew&#x27;s first steps out of the quarantine zone. Of course, there are quite a few ways in which the show deviates from its source material, which we will cover in the recap below.

[Update: As reported by PCGamesN, NetEase has responded to the news that it rejected partnership extension from Activision Blizzard, stating that it found the proposal &quot;rude and unreasonable, inappropriate and commercially illogical”.
“As far as we know, Blizzard’s negotiations with other companies during the same period were all based on a three-year contract period,&quot; responds NetEase. &quot;Considering the non-reciprocity, unfairness, and other strict conditions attached to the cooperation, the parties could not reach an agreement in the end.” In addition, NetEase accuses Activision Blizzard of &quot;endless, exorbitant demands, taking free rides, and taking all advantages without responsibilities.&quot;

Yesterday saw the New York Videogame Critics Circle host its 12th annual New York Game Awards, celebrating the best releases to hit the PC, console, and mobile gaming market in 2022.
In a ceremony packed full of, frankly, oddly monikered categories Elden Ring was the big winner of the evening, taking home the &quot;Big Apple Award for Best Game of the Year&quot;. In addition, FromSoftware&#x27;s highly celebrated fantasy RPG also captured the &quot;Statue of Liberty Award for Best World&quot;. Elden Ring, as you will no doubt be aware, topped many outlets&#x27; &quot;Best of&quot; lists at the end of 2022, (including our own), which is a testament to the title&#x27;s appeal in aesthetic design, gameplay, and atmosphere.

                              <span>Industrial action to take place January 27
France&#x27;s Solidaires Informatique union has called for strike action at developer/publisher Ubisoft&#x27;s Paris office. The industrial action, scheduled to take place next week on Friday, January 27, is being held in response to comments made by Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot over the company&#x27;s recent financial losses.
The news comes one week after Ubisoft announced that it was further delaying pirate adventure Skull &amp; Bones, alongside comments that implied the company was financially struggling after a particularly tough year for its game sales. Guillemot noted that he was hoping to cut costs at the studio, reducing expenditure by some €200 million through &quot;targeted restructuring, divesting some non-core assets, and usual natural attrition.&quot;

                              <span>Michael B. Jordan will star
Video game adaptations are everywhere these days -- why not throw another one on the pile? We now know there&#x27;s a Rainbow Six movie coming from Paramount, and it&#x27;s just been announced that John Wick director Chad Stahelski is attached to the project, as covered by The Hollywood Reporter in an exclusive. Actor Michael B. Jordan is also involved, and he&#x27;ll star as John Clark -- the protagonist of Tom Clancy&#x27;s famous book series that inspired the games. Jordan&#x27;s already taken on the role of Clark after starring in the 2021 film Without Remorse which was also based on Clancy&#x27;s work.
This new movie will likely serve as a sequel to Without Remorse, as at the end of the film, Clark is planning to establish the famed multinational anti-terrorist &quot;Rainbow&quot; team. While the first film only took inspiration from Clancy&#x27;s writing, this potential sequel will instead focus on the team that was made so popular by Ubisoft&#x27;s game series: Rainbow Six. Details are sparse as of now, as the movie does not yet have a release date or plot summary, so keep in mind that it&#x27;s all pretty much speculation. Even so, it&#x27;s hard to imagine they&#x27;d pass on drawing inspiration from the games at least a little bit, especially for an action movie.

Chad Stahelski is best known for his directorial debut with the John Wick movies, but he&#x27;s actually been around the industry for a long time as a stuntman, having worked on films like The Matrix, Van Helsing, and Escape from L.A. Here&#x27;s hoping that such a prolific figure in the action space will make unique, compelling work of the IP he&#x27;s drawing on because a lot of fans are hoping to see their favorite series done justice on the silver screen.

                              <span>The co-op horror shooter is making its way to the Switch
Gunfire Games&#x27; Remnant: From the Ashes is making its way to a new platform on the Nintendo Switch. The co-op horror action game is coming to Nintendo&#x27;s handheld sometime soon.
The survival horror-inspired co-op shooter first arrived in 2019, pitting solo players or teams against a horde of monstrosities in a decrepit urban landscape. Now, Gunfire Games is bringing the action to a handheld format, alongside THQ Nordic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;3fuLxV3g6YU
No release date has been set yet. A sequel to Remnant, currently dubbed Remnant 2, was revealed at The Game Awards 2022. The new Remnant title is targeting a 2023 launch, and will be headed to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC, but no Switch.
Rise from the ashes
It&#x27;s a bit of a surprise, but certainly not an unwelcome one. Remnant: From the Ashes has always been talked up by those I know who have played it, and another platform for the co-op action game certainly seems like a good thing.
In our review from the game&#x27;s launch, it does assert that while Remnant does take a while to get it going, it does eventually let it rip. The randomization offers a bit of variety to each run, and the urban-apocalyptic world is something special altogether, like a mix between Metro and Eldritch horror.
Maybe the game will find another audience to build up on the Switch, just in time to tee them up for the sequel. We&#x27;ll keep an eye out for more to come on Remnant: From the Ashes&#x27; Switch port, and how soon it will be arriving.

It looks like Warner Bros. and Rocksteady&#x27;s Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League may have some live service features tied into it. A new leak, with details corroborated by VGC, shows mentions of live service features that include a battle pass.
The leaked image circulated out from 4chan and Reddit and was soon picked up by news outlet VGC. According to a source VGC spoke to, the image comes from a recent test build and shows menus planned for Rocksteady&#x27;s next game. Among these elements are a battle pass, store, and currencies, which would imply some live service features could be in the game.
VGC reports that a development source has said a battle pass is planned, but it would be focused on cosmetic content. The currencies shown also reportedly pertain to XP and skill trees for characters. These characters won&#x27;t start off weak, according to VGC&#x27;s source, but will &quot;start off great and can get ridiculous, like Arkham Knight&#x27;s Batman.&quot;

A suicide mission
We haven&#x27;t seen much Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League gameplay yet that could further back this up or not. Most recently, we saw a cinematic tease of the upcoming anti-hero brawler at The Game Awards 2022. Alongside a release date confirmation for May 26, 2023, Rocksteady also confirmed that Kevin Conroy would be the voice of Batman as well. The voice actor, who played Batman in both the Arkham games series and many animated adaptations, including Batman: The Animated Series, died last year.
This is Rocksteady&#x27;s first game since 2015&#x27;s Arkham Knight, so fans are likely curious about how these systems pan out. If these shots are from an internal test version, things could potentially shift. Hopefully we&#x27;ll learn more about what&#x27;s in store for Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League sometime between now and its May release date.

                              <span>You may be able to hack your way across the Lands Between, but do you really know them? Can you tell your Nokrons from your Nokstellas? How about your Sanctums from your Catacombs? Can you distinguish between the Ainsel River and the Ainsel River Main? Look me in the eye and tell me you can pinpoint the Cathedral of Manus Celes, I dare you.
Alternatively, you can try out this fan-made Elden Ring Geoguessr-inspired game that plonks you into a random bit of the map and scores you based on how close you can drop a pin to your true location. If Rings aren&#x27;t your thing LostGamer.io has maps from other games, too, including Skyrim and Fortnite. It&#x27;s a lovely idea.

                              <span>I still say the Hylics games are some of the prettiest around, with their striking mix of claymation and video capture. So I&#x27;m delighted to realise that, unbeknowst to me, creator Mason Lindroth occasionally give behind-the-scenes peeks at props and animations on Twitter. It is very interesting to see those original handcrafted figures. And it is very funny to discover that the process of animating one character&#x27;s hands involved wearing a little cardboard green screen like a shroud while waggling a sexy gloved arm through the hole.

I played Returnal last year and can confirm that it is splendid, and also that you will grow to hate the kamikaze squid in the final area with every fibre of your being. Presuming you get that far.

They&#x27;ve announced Titan will be out for realsies on January 31st, when it will unshackle itself from its early access chains while forcing thousands more workers into indentured labour. 
It&#x27;s more than just a slick sci-fi city builder, boasting battleship combat and the ability to tinker with what goes on inside your buildings.

                              <span>Far Cry 2 is a lot of things, based on the memories I have from playing it a decade ago. First and foremost, I recall Far Cry 2: Parasitic Pain, which tasks you with running around begging for pills to stave off a growing infection. Next comes Far Cry 2: Buddy Bonanza, which lets you make lots of lovely AI friends, charge into battles together, and then hide while they die. Then, there’s Far Cry 2: Firewatch, which is all about watching fire. It&#x27;s the best.

                              <span>The EU have voted to push for reform in the videogame industry, backing a report that takes aim at everything from loot boxes to human rights violations tied up with gold-farming. The report includes calls for better parental control options, &quot;harmonised rules&quot; compelling sellers to show more information about game content, and a clamp down on third-party skin gambling.
Those are all laudable goals, but time will tell how much change this actually amounts to.

For those among us with one of the brawnier graphics cards on the market, it’s just become even prettier too, via the slightly delayed implementation of ray tracing.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been holding something in for 5 years. It first started as a deep joy, like a ray of sunshine in the palm of my hand. Then it became a deep sense of longing for something I&#x27;d lost, like a cascade of sand that fell from my palm as I wept gently on an empty beach. The &quot;it&quot; is a mobile and Nintendo Switch game called Pokémon Quest (don&#x27;t laugh), which was the first - and only -  mobile game I&#x27;ve actively obsessed over.
The game&#x27;s an auto-battler where you gather a small trio from the original 150 Pokéfolks, level them up, and then tackle trickier and trickier stages. After a frankly disgusting number of hours, I&#x27;d finished all the stages. So, I thought, &quot;Yes, of course they will add the 2nd generation of Pokéfolks with a bunch of new stages. This is its natural evolution, if you will&quot;. It still hasn&#x27;t happened and probably never will. And I hate that I can&#x27;t find anything else that&#x27;ll replace it.

                              <span>Thunderful Games have announced they&#x27;re going to be holding a special SteamWorld stream next Monday January 23rd, where they&#x27;ll be unveiling what&#x27;s next for the series. Taking place at 9.30am PST / 5.30pm GMT, it&#x27;s not clear what the SteamWorld Telegraph: Special Broadcast will entail just yet, but given we already know several SteamWorld games are in development at the moment, here&#x27;s a rough guess-timate of what to expect.

                              <span>Indonesian studio Mojiken have been making games for years. Most of them are less than an hour long. They&#x27;re short, punchy adventures and cover everything from digital fortune tellers, violin-playing owl-men, and poetic folktales about potato-shaped forest creatures. 
A Space For The Unbound is Mojiken’s first &#x27;big&#x27; release in that sense, clocking in at around nine-ish hours. What begins as a YA coming-of-age tale about a small-town romance quickly gains remarkable momentum, and suddenly you’re dealing with supernatural teens trying to desperately stop a world-ending calamity. Part sci-fi drama, part high school romance, A Space For The Unbound manages to have incredible weight and grandeur while also being poignant, sweet, and honest at the same time. It&#x27;s a triumph.

                              <span>Last time, you decided that programmable party members are better than optional grinding. I can respect that. Yeah, it&#x27;s sometimes fun to turn your brain off and grind out a bit, but there&#x27;s a lot to say for doing the work up front to get your party and builds running correctly then just watch them go. This week, I ask you to choose between one thing which speaks to my inner teenager, and one thing which speaks to my inner child. What&#x27;s better: big engines rising from the bonnet, or knocking folks over edges?

                              <span>In games it&#x27;s often a delight to be proven wrong. Such as, for example, my longstanding belief that Dwarf Fortress would never make the biggest and most important change it possibly could, and fit itself with an interface fit for purpose.

Bay 12 Games have, of course, gone further than that, and released it for general sale on the biggest shop in the business after sixteen years as freeware. There&#x27;s even a charming new graphics overhaul to replace the famous ASCII symbols which, depending on who you ask, might not have technically counted as &quot;graphics&quot; at all.
I&#x27;m not here to discuss the relative merits of this shiny new version and the &quot;classic&quot; version. Both will be updated in future, the latter still free, and neither expected to reach a full 1.0 release inside 20 years. All this chips around the edges of what I&#x27;ve been pondering, which is this: What exactly is Dwarf Fortress&#x27;s place within our culture now, after a decade replete with games that looked to it for ideas?

                              <span>In 2021 I reviewed Backbone, a masterpiece of 2D pixelart that was partly a point &#x27;n&#x27; click detective noir game, and mostly a grim story-focused fever dream about collectivism. At the time I described it as &quot;like The Good Place with more depression, or Disco Elysium with raccoons.&quot; Backbone has an ending so bizarre on a literal level that it defies description even if I wanted to spoil it. A while back developers Eggnut teased that they were working on a new game, and it turns out that game is Tails: The Backbone Preludes, a prequel that probably won&#x27;t answer any questions you might&#x27;ve had about the ending of Backbone. It&#x27;s also out very soon, on February 2nd.

In additional to our written work about the wonderful world of indie games, starting from now we&#x27;ll also be doing that across the audio waves in the form of our brand new podcast, Indiescovery!
Indiescovery is the new sibling in the RPS podcast family and will sit snuggly next to Ultimate Audio Bang, and The Electronic Wireless Show, but our focus is strictly on the wonderful world of indie games. It’s best to think of the podcast as an extension of our Indiescovery tag on the site - although we&#x27;ve got the Indiescovery Podcast tag just for the pod, if you ever want to check all the episodes. Every episode video bud Liam, guides lass Rebecca and myself (reviews ranger Rachel) will highlight a bunch of cool indies and talk about why we love them. We&#x27;ll be gabbing about the latest indie darlings, exciting upcoming releases, hidden gems lost to space and time, and more.

                              <span>The WD SN850x is one of the very fastest NVMe SSDs in the world, with its PCIe 4.0 connection, super-fast TLC NAND flash memory and high-speed controller offering some frankly astonishing speeds - up to 7300MB/s reads and 6300MB/s writes, not to mention random read and write speeds of 800K IOPS and 1.1M IOPS respectively. This puts it within the top echelon of SSDs - perhaps why we named it the best PCIe 4.0 SSD for gaming!

You have the choice of the Crucial P3 at £104 (vs £120 on Amazon) or the faster Kingston KC3000 at £155 (vs £202 at Amazon). Both are great drives for the money, so if you&#x27;re in the market for a storage upgrade you&#x27;ve just got to decide whether you can benefit from the faster speeds and better components of the KC3000, or whether you prefer the lower price of the P3.

And now it&#x27;s 85% off this week on Steam, meaning you can pick it up for £2.69/$3.

                              <span>And it&#x27;s all free!
One of the most remarkable things about Stardew Valley is how different it is now to when it first came out, and that&#x27;s down to developer ConcernedApe continuing to add features and content in free updates. We&#x27;re currently up to 1.5, which added a whole new area and several new characters amongst a ton of other new stuff, but for folks that haven&#x27;t played in a while, it can be a bit overwhelming.
We&#x27;ve put together 19 of the coolest features that ConcernedApe added to the game post-launch that you may not have noticed — things that perhaps went under the radar, drowned out by all the bigger stuff, or things you haven&#x27;t experienced since putting down the game a while ago. Maybe this will get you back into the game!

Bandai Namco is getting right behind the upcoming Tales of Symphonia Remastered release next month, and in a surprising move, the company has decided to upload Tales of Symphonia: The Animation to YouTube to help promote the game.
The anime is technically three separate OVA series that retell the story of Tales of Symphonia. The three arcs are the Sylvarant Arc, the Tethe&#x27;alla Arc, and The United World Arc. Episode one of the Sylvarant Arc, which debuted in 2007 in Japan, was uploaded earlier today, and you can watch it with English, French, Spanish, or Italian subtitles on the European channel!

Have you ever wanted to know what Radiohead&#x27;s incredible 2007 album &#x27;In Rainbows&#x27; sounded like if it was the soundtrack to an N64 game? Then look no further. The hugely talented on4word has recreated the entire album using music and sound effects from Super Mario 64. The premise is ridiculous, but the results are actually incredible.
Shared on ResetEra, the aptly-titled &#x27;In Rainbow Roads&#x27; recreates every single track from the Oxfordshire band&#x27;s seventh studio album. It shouldn&#x27;t work, but it does, and it&#x27;s pitch-perfect. If you&#x27;ve even heard one song from Mario 64, you&#x27;ll be able to identify some of the sounds throughout this recreation. &#x27;15 Step&#x27; uses sound fonts from Shifting Sand Land, Bowser levels, and Bob-omb speech noises, and &#x27;Bodysnatchers&#x27; has the iconic menu toot, for lack of a better word.

We are nearing the grand opening of Super Nintendo World Hollywood on 17th February, when the US take on the much-discussed Japanese attraction will open its doors (pipes?) for the first time.
In the build up to the big day, we have seen a lot of snaps from those who have been lucky enough to visit in press tours and promotion. While the park is looking just as amazing as we would have expected — it is a near exact copy of the one found in Osaka — there are some changes that were never going to sit right with us.

Everyone has something they loved spending time with in the past – a restaurant, a daily-play video game, a group of friends – only to one day unknowingly enjoy doing so for the final time. It&#x27;s a poignant and often heartbreaking truth of how places evolve, tastes change, and priorities divert as we all grow older. For the eponymous hero in Lil Gator Game, that activity is live-action role-playing with his big sis. With his sister home from college, Gator assembles a master plan to pry her away from her coursework for one more game. The resulting adventure is a short, cute, Zelda-in…</span>

                              <span>Netflix&#x27;s Sonic Prime series hit the streaming service back in December, and it seems more episodes are on the way. 
While it sits at a 60 percent critic score on Rotten Tomatoes, Sonic Prime received an 88 percent audience score, which is pretty great as far as video game TV shows go. Of course, Rotten Tomatoes doesn&#x27;t account for every person that watched the series, but it&#x27;s a quick look at what audiences thought. It seems Netflix is ready to answer the desire for more because the official Sonic the Hedgehog Twitter account announced today that more Sonic Prime episodes are coming later this year.

As you can see, there&#x27;s not much to go on here, so it&#x27;s currently unclear if these are just additional episodes or the reveal that a Season 2 is happening. Regardless, more Sonic Prime is coming to Netflix in 2023.

                              <span>Developer Avalanche and publisher Warner Bros. Interactive have released a new cinematic trailer for Hogwarts Legacy, giving viewers a bird&#x27;s eye view, literally, of the titular school and the surrounding castle grounds. 
With Hogwarts Legacy due out on current-get consoles and PC in just a few weeks, on February 10, it&#x27;s no surprise we&#x27;re getting a trailer like this today. It&#x27;s a great look at what to expect in the game, including beasts and creatures, characters like Professor Weasley and Nearly Headless Nick, and more. There&#x27;s even some Avada Kadavra-casting foes to be seen, as well as dragons and spiders to fights. And all of it is shown through the view of an owl delivering a Hogwarts acceptance letter to a soon-to-be wizard. 
Check out the 4K version of this Hogwarts Legacy cinematic trailer below: 


For more about Hogwarts Legacy, check out everything we learned in the second gameplay showcase, which aired last month, and then read about the latest details revealed during a Sony State of Play last year. Check out Hogwarts Legacy&#x27;s PlayStation 5 DualSense features after that. Read about how controversial Harry Potter creator JK Rowling is not involved with the making of Hogwarts Legacy (although she will almost certainly be getting money as a direct result of this game) and then check out this trailer showcasing common rooms, easter eggs, and more. 
Hogwarts Legacy hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on February 10. It launches on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on April 4, and finally, the Switch version will be released on July 25.

                              <span>With last week&#x27;s launch of Intel&#x27;s 4th Gen Xeon Scalable Sapphire Rapids server processors, Intel heavily talked up the shiny new accelerators and the big performance potential of AMX, but not really showcased and only heard through the grapevine was the improved AVX-512 implementation found with these new processors. With Sapphire Rapids there is reduced penalties from engaging AVX-512 -- and for some AVX-512 instructions, no longer any measurable impact -- compared to prior generation Xeon processors. In this article is a look at the performance for a wide variety of workloads with AVX-512 on/off not just for Sapphire Rapids but also for prior generation Ice Lake as well as AMD&#x27;s new EPYC 4th Gen &quot;Genoa&quot; processors where they have introduced AVX-512 for the first time.</span>

Ty fungují dobře, ale při vyplňování formulářů mají velké problémy s českými znaky. Je to způsobené tím, že samotný standard PDF zná jen základní sady znaků, v kterých znaky české abecedy chybí, vysvětluje Jiří Eischmann na stránkách MojeFedora.cz. Standard sice zná ještě znakovou sadu RTF, ale ta zase není podporovaná všemi klienty. Najít tedy řešení nad rámec standardu, které bude kompatibilní napříč různými implementacemi, není jednoduchá záležitost.</span>

                              <span>I tend to play citybuilders in order to design my own little world of bucolic hills or crisp modern architecture. Surviving The Abyss, meanwhile, is about building a habitat in a terrifying, inhospitable place: the deep sea. It&#x27;s out in early access today.

                              <span>Steam&#x27;s most recent hardware survey says that 65% of PC players use 1080p, but you wouldn&#x27;t know it to look at Forspoken&#x27;s system requirements which benchmark the game against 720p 30fps (minimum), 1440p 30fps (recommended) and 2160p 60fps (ultra). 

Regardless of what kind of performance you&#x27;re aiming for, you&#x27;ll need a pretty beefy machine, with 24GB of RAM and an RTX 3070 required to hit those recommended specs.

                              <span>Last week, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot sent a letter to all staff in which he asked employees to &quot;give it [their] all&quot; and to be &quot;as efficient and lean as possible.&quot; French union Solidaires Informatique have written their own letter today, arguing that Guillemot&#x27;s &quot;words mean something: overtime, managerial pressure, burnout, etc.&quot; 

In response, they&#x27;re calling for Ubisoft Paris employees to strike from 2 to 6pm on Friday, January 27th, with demands that include an &quot;immediate 10% increase for all salaries&quot; and the &quot;implementation of a 4-day week.&quot;

                              <span>As someone whose only experience with the Persona series lay with Persona 5, I dove into Persona 3 Portable&#x27;s PC re-release with one expectation: it will be old and therefore quite bad. Looking back, was I naïve? Yes. And was I wrong? I&#x27;m delighted to report that I was catastrophically wrong.
From what I&#x27;ve played so far of Persona 3, I reckon it&#x27;s well worth a whirl if you&#x27;re a newcomer, or a Persona 5 fan who&#x27;s concerned that a game from 2009 won&#x27;t be all that good. Not only does it stand on its own as a fun high school mystery with an alarmingly dark undertone, it almost acts as a fun history lesson too.

                              <span>According to the definitely legit authority of Dangerousroads(dot)Org (and maybe also the Guinness Book Of Records), the actual longest road on Earth is the Pan-American Highway, measuring 30,000km long, and spanning several different countries as it wends its way from the bottom of South America to top of Alaska. I can&#x27;t even imagine how long it would take you to do a full journey across it all, but it will definitely take you longer than the two hours you&#x27;ll spend in the company of Brainwash Gang&#x27;s loosely connected anthology story game The Longest Road On Earth. But cor, what a lovely, wistful two hours those are all the same.

Paradox announced the DLC today after details, screenshots and a trailer leaked ahead of the reveal through SteamDB. YouTuber Aspec also uploaded a video detailing the leak and revealing the DLC’s trailer, which has since been made private. You can watch the official trailer below.

                              <span>What’s the purpose of creative tools such as Halo Infinite’s Forge beta if you can’t use them to stuff things from other, completely unrelated games into your timesink of choice? Well, Hinfinite map makers LudoHT and Its L0L0 have done exactly that, crafting a surprisingly authentic version of Mario Kart’s DK Mountain track. It sounds like there’ll be more tracks to slide your Mongoose around too, as they’ve also gone and made a Mario Kart race gametype for Halo Infinite.

                              <span>We had a discussion in our Monday meeting that got louder than things normally do, because The Last Of Us TV show came up, and we found ourselves divided into two camps. Well, three. Camp one was excited for the TV show and camp two posited that there&#x27;s no point making an adaptation of something if your adaptation is just the same thing. (The third camp was &quot;eh, I might check it out&quot; and watched the other two camps duking it out). I was in camp two. If you&#x27;re adapting something, adapt! Make changes! Otherwise I might as well just consume the original thing again! The Last Of Us has already been released, what, three times?
This was made funnier by the fact that nobody on staff had seen the TV show, so we were just arguing about tweets we&#x27;d seen that describe the show, the worst way to conduct a discussion outside of e.g. scrawling insults on the side of Teslas and self-driving them into each other&#x27;s front doors. But it got me to thinking about adaptations, because there have been loads of adaptations of things that aren&#x27;t games into video games. What goes wrong in the other direction?

                              <span>While Dan Douglas captures English culture in a Duke Nukem 3D level, another mapper has been diligently recreating corners of Scotland in Far Cry 5. Since 2019, YouTuber &quot;Mojo Swoptops&quot; has rebuilt a wide and weird range of Edinburgh sights inside Far Cry 5&#x27;s level editor, from the big tourist landmarks like the castle and Forth Bridge to perfectly mundane places such as blocks of flats and nightclubs at chucking-out time. As an Edinburgh resident, it&#x27;s great fun to see, and a very pleasing contrast to the gleaming miniature reimagination seen in Forza Horizon 4.

                              <span>HBO’s TV adaptation of fungal post-apocalyptic funfest The Last Of Us debuted on streaming services on both sides of the Atlantic over the past few days, and now a follow-up trailer shows what’s coming for the rest of the show’s first season. It has plenty of cordyceps-infected baddies, gritty human drama, and Pedro Pascal being Pedro Pascal. You can watch the Weeks Ahead trailer below, and wonder where The Mandalorian’s left his helmet again.

The image was originally posted to 4Chan, but made its way onto Reddit and Twitter. An unnamed development source has since confirmed to VGC that the Suicide Squad image is legit, and shows the menus in a recent test build of the third-person shooter.

Up to now, devs Fntastic haven’t shared unedited footage of the game in the lead up to its planned release on March 1st, but they say that’s about to change with a showcase of features at some point in January. You can watch the most recent, very short clip of edited ray-traced footage from The Day Before from this month’s CES show below.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve played around four hours of soviet-punk FPS Atomic Heart, which took me from the story&#x27;s opening moments to plenty of the game&#x27;s earliest bits. The final hour or so was split into two parts, thanks to a lovely dev who time-skipped me forwards and into the game&#x27;s open world, before warping me through a gate and into an early boss&#x27;s lair. There was a lot to take in, from robo-gloves, to sex-dom vending machines, to grannies with bazookas.
I went in with expectations that it might be a little like BioShock, all steely and serious in its delivery of some vaguely philosophical truth. But I emerged with a totally different impression. Far from polished seriousness, Atomic Heart seems a little disjointed in its ambition, with a main character who almost immediately kills any atmosphere when he opens his mouth.

£306! That&#x27;s a tiny price for a CPU that launched last year at an official RRP of £429 and a real-life asking price of £530. To get this reduced price, use code JAN10 at the checkout.

                              <span>The money makers
Video games are a pretty darn profitable industry. As it turns out, a lot of people are willing to pay a lot of money to press little buttons. But only a select few button-pressing facilitators can claim to have made the most money. And only an even more select few can claim to actually be good.
High sales don&#x27;t always translate into high quality. That&#x27;s not a secret — there&#x27;s a reason the fine folks at the British Film Institute don&#x27;t factor box office take into the Sight &amp; Sound poll (I like Avengers: Endgame, but it&#x27;s not standing side-by-side with 2001: A Space Odyssey). Still, the Top 10 best-selling games in history have turned a lot of copies, and there&#x27;s got to be some reason they connect with so many players.
So let&#x27;s look at that Top 10 list and see which of thes…</span>

                              <span>It&#x27;s the little details that make the difference
The Sims 4&#x27;s ongoing support from both its fans and developers speaks to the behemoth of the simulation genre that it is. Just when we thought the game offered anything players could possibly dream of, they turn around and offer even more possibilities -- which is exactly what Maxis is doing with the release of two mini-DLCs, also known as kits. The Simtimates Collection Kit and the Bathroom Clutter Kit are releasing on January 19 for PC and Mac, as well as Xbox and PlayStation consoles.
The former includes upgrades to the usual set of pajamas that Sims wear, and the collection &quot;will help any Sim look bold, flirty, &amp; charming in the bedroom with lacey bodysuits, a variety of underwear styles &amp; playful boxer prints.&quot; Now your Sim can lounge around in style, and of course, the new looks can invite some more spice into your game if you&#x27;re into that kind of thing.

The Bathroom Clutter Kit takes a turn into the messy -- this kit allows players to customize their clutter, and scatter various knick-knacks around their bathrooms. The items range from Grandma&#x27;s dentures to makeup palettes, so you&#x27;ll be able to create a lived-in space for anybody in your Sims household.
Both of these kits were teased in the &quot;It&#x27;s All Relative&quot; Roadmap for The Sims 4 posted on January 12, 2023, which also announced that the game will receive &quot;one big update&quot; and an expansion pack on top of the two new kits. In addition, there will also be more support for extended family systems in the game, which will also tie back into the big expansion that&#x27;s coming this year, according to the Roadmap post. Looks like this is only the beginning of the exciting things the Maxis team has in store, and considering The Sims 4 is now free-to-play, it&#x27;s an excellent time to jump in and join the fun.

A fresh new brew is on the way from Toge Productions and Chorus Worldwide. Coffee Talk Episode 2: Hibiscus &amp; Butterfly is now slated for an April 20, 2023 launch on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, Xbox, and PC via Steam.
The sequel to 2020&#x27;s Coffee Talk still takes place in a mythologized Seattle, where humans and fantasy beings live in harmony. You play as a barista to these denizens, serving up their drink of choice while listening to them chat about their day.
Today&#x27;s new trailer shows off some features, including handling special items, chatting with coffee drinkers, and of course, making beautiful art in the cups.

The RIAA asked for $250,000 after winning its case against the YouTube ripper. However, according to Yout, a payment now would seriously harm its legal defense as funds are running low.

The only caveat is that proposals must be actionable under existing law, which rightsholders say isn&#x27;t up to the job.

                              <span>Persona 3 released in North America in 2007 on PlayStation 2 and was a mild hit. The dark, teen drama RPG had a niche audience, but those who found the game adored it. The game received a special edition release with added in content in 2008 with FES, and was then re-released a third time for PSP in 2010 with the most added content, but some modifications made to run on Sony&#x27;s handheld platform.
Persona 4 followed – again a mild hit – but then Persona 5 came along and cemented the franchise&#x27;s reputation as one of the best RPGs ever made. Fans who discovered the series with 5 have wanted to figure out what they&#x27;ve been missing out on, and longtime players have been demanding the re-release of 3 so that a larger audience could play what many call their favorite. After arguably too long, Atlus is finally ready to make that happen with the re-re-re-release of Persona 3 on modern consoles January 19.
Join Kyle Hilliard and Wesley LeBlanc as they look at the game&#x27;s first true dungeon and chat about perhaps the most controversial Persona game in the series.

                              <span>Heads up, Stadia owners: Google’s cloud gaming program is shutting down today, January 18. The service began issuing refunds for all hardware last November, but if you haven’t received one yet, information on how to obtain one should have been emailed to the Google account used to make the purchase. However, past Stadia Pro subscriptions will not receive refunds.
There&#x27;s a silver lining for those of you with Stadia controllers and nothing to use them for. You can download an update that will allow your controller to use Bluetooth. However, be warned: this permanently disables wi-fi capabilities, so if you download the update now, you won&#x27;t be able to play Stadia games before the shutdown. For more details, you can visit the Stadia Help Center.
Stadians, you can now update your Stadia Controller’s firmware to enable Bluetooth Low Energy connections.

If you missed the news about the shutdown, last September, Stadia’s VP and General Manager said in a blog post that “while Stadia&#x27;s approach to streaming games for consumers was built on a strong technology foundation, it hasn&#x27;t gained the traction with users that we expected so we’ve made the difficult decision to begin winding down our Stadia streaming service.” 
Stadia’s struggles were no secret. Its first-party studios were shut down just over a year in, with the service being “deprioritized” a year later. While it was an interesting experiment, some experiments are just destined to fail. Rest in peace, Stadia.</span>

Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty’s public demo gave players a chance to experience a more general idea of what this fast-paced action game offers, but Koei Tecmo recently gave us the chance to go deeper and play through the first two chapters in Wo Long in full. I’m starting to understand that developer Team Ninja is aiming for a wider swath of players with Wo Long as opposed to its Nioh titles, which are some of the most demanding in games. While Wo Long still features that trademark From Software-inspired challenge, it also features a unique system that allows you to change an enemy’s…</span>

                              <span>The Last of Us, the highly anticipated TV adaptation of Naughty Dog&#x27;s hit game of the same name, finally premiered Sunday and it&#x27;s looking like a massive hit for HBO. 
That&#x27;s because The Last of Us&#x27; premiere was the second largest debut for an HBO series since 2010, beaten only by last year&#x27;s House of the Dragon, the first TV spinoff from HBO&#x27;s Game of Thrones series. The Last of Us drew in 4.7 million views, according to a Deadline report, coming in second to House of the Dragon&#x27;s 2022 premiere which pulled in 9.986 million watchers. The Last of Us is matched by HBO&#x27;s Boardwalk Empire, which premiered in 2010 to 4.81 million viewers. 
Deadline writes that HBO says Sunday night viewing usually represents 20 to 40% of a given show&#x27;s gross audience per episode (HBO shows typically release episodes on Sunday nights). 
&quot;We are thrilled to see fans of the series and game alike experience this iconic story in a new way, and we extend our gratitude to them for helping to make it a success,&quot; CEO and chairman of HBO and HBO Max Content Casey Bloys said, according to Deadline. &quot;Congratulations to [showrunners Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann, who is also a co-creator of The Last of Us], and the brilliant cast and crew who worked tirelessly to bring this show to life. We look forward to fans around the world enjoying the rest of the season.&quot; 
&quot;Our focus was simply to make the best possible adaption of this beloved story for as big an audience as we could,&quot; Druckmann and Mazin said, according to Deadline. &quot;We are overjoyed to see how many fans, both old and new, have welcomed The Last of Us into their homes and their hearts.&quot; 
While waiting for this week&#x27;s episode, read our interview with Druckmann and Joel actor Pedro Pascal about how The Last of Us was changed for TV, and then read about how there are no plans for The Last of Us show to go beyond the games.

This image, which you can view in the tweet below, comes from the 4chan forum, as reported by Video Games Chronicle, which has also verified with sources that the image is real. The image appears to be Suicide Squad&#x27;s start menu and features standard things like game mode selection, chapter select, difficulty, and matchmaking. It also features some menus to page through at the top, including a &quot;Battle Pass&quot; one. Under those top-bar menus are what appear to be various currencies, too. 
First look at the Suicide Squad game menu. Mentions Battle Pass, Loadout, Missions based structure. #Batman #SuicideSquad pic.twitter…</span>

&quot;You know how fuzzy memories can be.&quot; It&#x27;s a convenient and hand-wavy line delivered by the new character Lim, warning the Straw Hat Pirates of the impending adventures into some of One Piece&#x27;s most popular story arcs. Likewise, One Piece Odyssey can be a fuzzy experience. It oscillates between being thrilling and tedious. The promise of discovering &quot;what if…?&quot; scenarios is enticing for longtime fans, but it rarely follows through in a meaningful way. And as a potential introductory point for new fans, One Piece O…</span>

Golf Story was one of the biggest surprises in the Switch’s extremely strong first year on the market. Thanks to Golf Story’s charming, nostalgic presentation and novel sports/RPG fusion, Sports Story has long been one of my most anticipated sequels. Unfortunately, its unfocused nature and frustrating gameplay are only overshadowed by a pervasive lack of polish that prevents Sports Story from being worth your time. 
As the name suggests, Sports Story expands the world to include other games while creating a more sweeping and ambitious story. As sports go…</span>

                              <span>Awesome Games Done Quick (AGDQ) started the New Year with a bang, raising over $2.6 million for the Prevent Cancer Foundation. For the unfamiliar, GDQ is a 24-hour charity live-stream where dedicated gamers show off speedruns of their favorite games. Before 2020, most events were held in person, but since then they&#x27;ve mostly been broadcasted from streamers&#x27; homes. This year&#x27;s event ran from January 8-15 and included over 140 runs.

While most runners don&#x27;t expect to set new records during the marathon, a whopping four were set this year for the following games: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder&#x27;s Revenge, PowerWash Simulator, Super Mario Galaxy 2, and Steven Seagal Is: The Final Option (Prototype). Most years have one or two records set, but four is a big deal.
2023 marks the 14th year that the biannual charity marathon has taken place. They have two main events in the winter and summer, but they also hold smaller events throughout the year. One of these is Frost Fatales, an all-women speedrunning event, which will take place from February 26 - March 4, 2023 on Twitch. Since it was founded in 2010, the organization has raised over $43 million for charity.
AGDQ was initially set to be in person but was moved online due to COVID concerns. Their summer event, Summer Games Done Quick, will be held from May 28 - June 4, though it&#x27;s unclear whether the event will also take place in person.

MissMikaa is the streamer who last week simultaneously beat Elden Ring with a controller and a dance mat, which should give you some clue as to how he rendered canine assistance.

                              <span>Bloodborne was great, but it didn&#x27;t have any lightning gorilla robocops. This is a problem the upcoming Lies of P hopes to fix, as revealed in a new gameplay trailer designed to show off how nice it looks on a Radeon RX 7900 XTX. I will likely never own a Radeon RX 7900 XTX, but it&#x27;s looking increasingly likely that I will buy Lies of P. 
It&#x27;s a Soulslike that plonks you into an alternate Victorian London where people got real good at inventing creepy automata. You play as the big P himself, Pinocchio.

                              <span>Shang-Chi is a card in Marvel Snap that destroys any and all opposing cards in his lane with a power of 9 or above. He feels great to play, and miserable to play against. He is also, apparently, quite bad - at least according to project lead Ben Brode, who&#x27;s consulted his big statistics bank to discover that he appears in more losing decks than anyone else. 
Huh. I suppose I can stop agonising over whether he has a place in my latest Patriot deck.

They&#x27;re now chiselling away at the Ashlands, a volcanic &quot;land of the dead&quot; packed with skeletal horrors. 
It&#x27;ll be a while before all the horrors are ready, but a smaller update with clothes and haircuts is on the way soon.

                              <span>I did not expect the next game from The Lion&#x27;s Song devs Mi&#x27;pu&#x27;mi Games to be a turn-based tactical folktale, but cor, Howl sure does tick a heck of a lot of boxes for me. Due out later this year, you play a deaf hero in search of a cure to a sinister &#x27;howling plague&#x27; that&#x27;s devastated the land around you and turned all its inhabitants into blood-thirsty beasts - and having played its first chapter last week, its combination of tight planning, grid-based shoving and limited ammo a la Into The Breach is very, very moreish indeed. Definitely one to watch for strategy game fans.

                              <span>At a time when LucasArts was cheerfully mocking rival developer Sierra&#x27;s fondness for punishing players with game overs you could trigger at the drop of a hat, Sierra themselves seemed intent to double down. In Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers, not only can the titular protagonist suffer a variety of gruesome fates if you so much as put a foot wrong, but there&#x27;s a point where you can soft-lock the entire game by failing to pick up an easily missable single snake scale from a busy crime scene — and you won&#x27;t even know you did anything wrong for several in-game days. I&#x27;m not 100% sure this wasn&#x27;t an oversight on the part of the developers, but at the same time, that&#x27;s exactly the sort of shit that Sierra liked to pull.

Stacinator has shared their efforts on YouTube and the Minecraft subreddit for all to see. I&#x27;d encourage you to have a watch of the full Minecraft Africa video, and wonder why Toto’s only other famous tune is Rosanna.

                              <span>The US Federal Trade Commision has already committed to blocking Microsoft&#x27;s $69 billion Activision-Blizzard buyout, so now it&#x27;s the EU&#x27;s turn to kick up a fuss. The EU&#x27;s antitrust watchdog is nearing the end of a 90-day probe into whether Microsoft&#x27;s buyout violates antitrust laws, and they&#x27;re reportedly about to serve up a charge sheet that lays out all their beef. As with those of the FTC and other regulators, their objections are likely to centre on the likelihood of Microsoft saddling Call Of Duty with Xbox or Gamepass exclusivity.

                              <span>Have you ever been in a relationship with somebody who surprised you in all the right ways at the beginning, but eventually frustrated and disappointed you so deeply that it all ended in a messy breakup? Farlanders is my messy breakup.
It&#x27;s a space colony city builder with a puzzle game mentality - and set on Mars to make things even more enticing. The best part of Farlanders is its story, and while it’s not quite a full-blown commentary on colonialism, it examines what you’re doing and why you’re doing it with a self-awareness that I did not expect at all. That being said, annoying difficulty curves, awkward terraforming, and frustrating progression systems stop this space colony sim from really taking off. A graph charting my enjoyment over time would look like a child’s drawing of a mountain.

Players, or at least former players, of Lost Ark left more than 1300 negative reviews of the game on Saturday, and more than 1000 on Sunday. They claimed they’d received bans that appeared on their Steam profile without actually logging into the game recently.

                              <span>HBO&#x27;s The Last Of Us TV adaptation is finally out on UK tellyboxes via Sky/Now TV today, and judging by early critic reviews, it&#x27;s meant to be pretty all right! You know, as video game TV shows go. I&#x27;ve yet to sit down and watch it myself, but I&#x27;ll probably be doing so this evening to see what&#x27;s what. 
A question I&#x27;ve been pondering in the run-up to The Last Of Us&#x27; TV debut, however, is this: if I watch the TV show now, will I really be bothered to actually sit down and play Part 1 when it finally comes to Steam at the beginning of March? &#x27;Cause I sure don&#x27;t have time (or the inclination) to do both. I think that might be too much The Last Of Us... But what about you, readers? Will you be tuning in, or waiting to play it on PC? Or both! Tell us in the comments below.

                              <span>Every weekend, indie devs show off current work on Twitter&#x27;s #screenshotsaturday tag. And every Monday, I bring you a selection of these snaps and clips. This week, my eye has been caught by a pleasing assortment of zippy and dramatic movements—hoverboards, airdashes, grappling hooks—but also some cute, weird, interesting, and uh I guess hypothetically erotic indies games. Come have a look!

                              <span>The team of modders working to bring The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion into Skyrim has updated us with a new trailer, announcing that they’re targeting 2025 to launch the Skyblivion project. By that point, volunteers will have been hammering away on Skyblivion for 13 years. If you remember what you were doing 13 years ago then you’ve got a better memory than I do. Watch the latest and rather snazzy trailer for Skyblivion below, and wonder whether Emperor Uriel Septim VII sounds more like Patrick Stewart or Sean Connery.

GDQ announced the $2.6 million figure on Twitter after the event concluded, and thanked all the runners and those who’d donated.

A number of speedruns throughout the week-long event smashed world records for their respective games and categories too, including PC runs of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge and my own personal GOTY from 2022, PowerWash Simulator. You can watch the AGDQ 2023’s record-setting No Soap PowerWash Simulator run below, and weep into your coffee at the sheer cleaning ability on display.

                              <span>Pirate sites are increasingly hard to find in search engines. Google has taken a series of steps to demote or remove problematic domains and it doesn&#x27;t appear to be alone. Several of the most visited pirate sites have virtually no results in Bing either. According to the search engine, this isn&#x27;t the result of an &#x27;editorial decision&#x27;.

                              <span>When it was released on January 14th 2003, SimCity 4 had its problems. Its huge cities would chug on even decent PCs, for one, and its traffic simulation seemed outright broken. 

Twenty years later - thanks to faster PCs, the Rush Hour expansion, and a huge modding community - SimCity 4 is the best of all SimCity games. If what you care about is simulation, scale, variety, and the beauty of urban sprawl, it&#x27;s also the best citybuilder.

                              <span>Against The Storm provided some of the most fun I had playing a citybuilder last year. That was in part because, despite being set in a dark fantasy world in which you must satisfy an unyielding Queen, and despite being in early access, it&#x27;s remarkably graspable. It&#x27;s the kind of citybuilder where, if you place a building in the wrong place, it simply lets you pick it up and move it at no cost.

As of its latest update, there&#x27;s now a new customisable game mode that lets you make your expeditions even more relaxed - or much harder.

To recap, this headset launched in late 2021, comes with 2.4GHz &quot;Lightspeed&quot; wireless and Bluetooth, with a lightweight design and in a range of colours - so $30 is an incredible price.

That&#x27;s despite the most recent swing of Ubisoft&#x27;s game-cancelling scythe, which was brought down on three unannounced games last week due to the company&#x27;s underperforming sales.

                              <span>Desktop Dungeons is a morish puzzle game from 2010 that channels conventional dungeoning into fiendish headscratching. Every enemy sits still, waiting for you to come and whack it. Whack willy-nilly, though, and they&#x27;ll kill you in no time - so you have to tactically explore parts of each level to heal, while targeting foes in an order that lets you survive long enough to level up and take on the big bads. 
Desktop Dungeons: Rewind is an upcoming &quot;modern remastering&quot; of the original, with 3D graphics and the ability to rewind time rather than start each level from the very beginning. It&#x27;s got a demo you can play right now, and it&#x27;s adding free daily challenges with a sharable leaderboard later this month. I am hyped.

                              <span>Make no bones about it: Ubisoft&#x27;s perennially delayed Skull &amp; Bones is still coming. A new developer video proves that, offering a fresh look at some sumptuous seas during a hunt for an Ungwanan renegade. The most interesting part of Skull &amp; Bones is still its tortured history, with a recent sixth delay pushing it even further back from the original 2018 release date - but oh, maybe I do want to be a boat after all. At least for a bit.

                              <span>When The Anacrusis launched into early access in January 2022, its retrofuturist take on the co-op FPS instantly delivered on funky sci-fi fun. Yet it was also tempered fun: a brutal AI Director could easily tip manageable chaos into a fatiguing onslaught of fishy alien minibosses, and I still remember my will to persevere being sapped by connectivity issues and a general lack of weight to the otherwise enticing pew-pew gunplay.


Happily, following a year of tweaks and additions, The Anacrusis is in a much better place. Even if that place is still turtleneck-deep in extraterrestrial viscera. Ahead of the game’s first anniversary, I poked developers Stray Bombay for a chat on how their early access approach is working out, the impact of long-awaited mod tools, and what’s next for this most stylish of space shooters.

                              <span>I&#x27;m playing Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla right now, and it&#x27;s too bloody big. This is my second stint, jumping back in after playing for 14 hours when it came out in 2020 then abandoning it - and I&#x27;m beginning to remember why. It&#x27;s a pretty but largely empty-feeling time, with woefully repetitive mission design and characters I only have a passive interest in. It&#x27;s good, therefore, to see Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage creative director Stéphane Boudon make more noises about how the next Creed game will be smaller and &quot;more intimate&quot;.

                              <span>When you think of object-gathering game Katamari Damacy the first things that spring to mind are usually balls, and the rolling thereof. Computer scientist and custom controller kitbashing experimenter Dr Tom Tilley had the same thought and, erm, rolled with it. In a case of life imitating art, Tilley repurposed a trackball he’d made from roll-on deodorant and a soccer ball to play the game with (thanks, Time Extension). You can watch Tilley mucking about with the trackball to control an emulated version of the PS2-era Katamari Damacy in the video below.

                              <span>What makes a good platformer? Christ, I don&#x27;t know. Why would you open an article with that. Calling Kandria a platformer feels a little reductive, so there&#x27;s a need to clarify why it works. You play as an android revived several decades after an apocalypse, by a tiny camp of survivors who inevitably need your help. A lot of this help involves, well, platforming. To the point of having nonsensical areas of pure platforming in between you and a destination or secret area. You&#x27;ll climb, jump, do the little dash thing that recharges when you touch the ground or pick up a hovering lamp thingy. You&#x27;ll land on a lot of thorny instakill spikes.


So yeh, lots of the old platforming, but it feels more like an exploration and scavenging game, with a side order of light-light-heavy-dodge combat too. And a plot with varied dialogue options and mysteries about the world and its history. It&#x27;s immediately and consistently fun, but I&#x27;m not sure exactly how to recommend it. Hmm.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve learned to love Apex Legends, having bounced off it hard multiple times. The pace is high, the movement tricky, the guns have like, 18 bullets in a clip and it&#x27;s really easy to buzz them all into thin-air. But once a few friends held my hand and taught me to be patient and position myself properly, rather than charge into battle at any given opportunity, the game began to click. And what a battle royale it is.

                              <span>Horror movie maestro John Carpenter has ‘fessed up that he’s not directing a movie version of Dead Space, but suggests there’s another director attached to a possible big-screen adaptation. Talking to Variety about his career ahead of his 75th birthday, Carpenter was asked about rumours he could be helming a non-interactive take on Dead Space. Considering Carpenter hasn’t made a film in 13 years it does seem a bit of a wild idea, but then the director is both a horror auteur and video game fan.

Fans are currently sorting through 60 gbs of unused Team Fortress 2 assets, including 20 maps, 40 man vs machine maps, and assorted intriguing models.

                              <span>Writing up our big guide on all the upcoming PC games of 2023, I was introduced to a number of smaller games in development I hadn&#x27;t heard about before. One of them was Broken Roads, an isometric RPG set in a post-apocalypse Australia. The gorgeous artwork was enough for me to click on the Steam page and read more, and while scrolling through the screenshots something strange caught my eye.
It was a screenshot of a fairly traditional RPG dialogue scene, with a panel at the bottom displaying all the possible dialogue options for the player. But what caught my eye was an unusual radial graphic on the right-hand side of the options. Reading on, I discovered that Broken Roads uses a rather unique Moral Compass, one which plots your overall moral stance towards the world and its people with a golden arc. Different decisions may rotate the arc, expand it, contract it, lengthen it, or shorten it. And in so doing, you&#x27;ll unlock various traits dotted about the Compass, which only remain in effect for as long as that golden arc covers those traits within the wheel.
I can see a dozen different ways in which this Moral Compass may end up being a bad idea in practice. But I don&#x27;t care. I adore it. And I&#x27;m going to play Broken Roads solely so I can see the consequences of my actions in satisfying radial form.

                              <span>As I scale the sides of apartment blocks with climbing axes and pole-vault through windows, I often feel like I&#x27;m breaking Babbdi. I feel I&#x27;ve done something particularly clever or busted outside the boundaries of its little brutalist city. I haven&#x27;t, but I&#x27;m delighted to explore with this feeling. Oh sure, my objective in this splendid free indie game is to find a way out of the terrible city, but I&#x27;ll enjoy my final hour here. You might too.

Tsunamods’ Echo-S 7 mod has actors from around the world voicing every character in Final Fantasy 7, including the battle barks. You can see a trailer of the mod in action below, but if you’re watching in the office on your lunch break then be aware that there’s a fair few cuss words in it.

                              <span>GOG has decided to scrap their GOG Connect service, which allowed users to claim a limited selection of games they already owned on Steam for free. The service was quietly killed off at the beginning of this year and removed from GOG’s site, which didn’t go unnoticed by frequenters of the GOG subreddit. GOG confirmed the closure of Connect to RPS fan site PC Gamer, saying “for a long time nothing really happened there, so we&#x27;ve decided to shut it down”. Fair enough.

Well, Grand Theft Auto Online’s latest addition is the Gun Van, and it’s going for a similar vibe. You can flag down the entrepreneurial van driver to buy pieces from a weekly rotating selection of what Rockstar calls “top-of-the-line weapons, ammunition, and armor”. It’s pretty much just the GTA equivalent of an ice cream truck, but for guns. Witness a short snippet of the Gun Van in action below.

                              <span>Several games have attempted to successfully marry first-person shooting with real-time strateging, and to my mind none have quite succeeded. Outpost: Infinity Siege, at the very least, understands why the ambition its worthwhile. First revealed during last year&#x27;s E3, its newest trailer shows more massive scale combat - as well as confirming its name and a release window.

                              <span>Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot once said that Tom Clancy&#x27;s The Division 2 being absent from Steam was &quot;a long-term positive&quot;. Perhaps he meant that only in the sense that, long-term, the game would come to Steam anyway. That&#x27;s what has happened now. As announced late last year, the open world cover shooter is now available on Steam after a period of Epic and Ubisoft store exclusivity.

                              <span>Back in my day, we had to pay hundreds of dollars for a high-end gaming display - but nowadays, you youngsters get them for almost nothing! Look at this $280 Acer Nitro gaming monitor on Newegg. It came out at $600 - and not even that long ago! And now it&#x27;s $320 off, for a 27-in 1440p 240Hz monitor. It&#x27;s got a cool curved screen, a VA panel for great contrast, absolutely incredible. When I were a lad, we&#x27;d have killed for a display with more than sixteen colours!

However, delivery times are 1-2 weeks, and you can now get a functionally identical alternative for half the price. 
It&#x27;s the iVoler Steam Deck Dock, which normally costs £49.99/$55.99 but is now down to £37.59 in the UK or $44.99 in the US. I&#x27;ve been testing this model for the past few days; here&#x27;s why I rate it.

The three games are a canny mix of genres, so there could well be something of interest there even if you’re not bothered about jacking into things or whacking chibi deities with a comically large mallet.

                              <span>I can’t even remember how my family came upon The Incredible Machine now, only that I spent many hours as a child happily fiddling about with mice, pipes, and a surprising variety of sporting balls. I’m pretty sure it was my first real encounter with a game that concentrated on a combination of physics and engineering to complete a puzzle, rather than ignorantly bouncing on an enemy, or trying to combine random items from an inventory with characters’ faces. Looking at you, rubber chicken with a pulley in the middle.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve completed my first play through of Chop Goblins, a &quot;microshooter&quot; from Dusk and Gloomwood developer David Szymanski. All in all, it took me just under an hour to choppa&#x27; da goblins and I&#x27;m all up for more of the same, to be honest. I liked time-travelling between Dracula&#x27;s abode and ancient greece, chopping a variety of killer goblins that squawked, &quot;NICE TO MEET YOU!&quot;, in varying octaves.
While another FPS of the &quot;micro&quot; variety would be grand, I&#x27;d love a &quot;microracer&quot;. Much in the same vein as my beloved Screamer, I&#x27;m desperate for a – linear or otherwise – arcade racer whose only concern is to burn rubber through all manner of world stages.

                              <span>Linda Tiger&#x27;s career in gaming started two decades ago, in a test house in Glasgow. “I started in QA back in 2002. I worked on functionality and localisation testing. Eventually, I became a lead and then a QA manager at a studio,” she tells me, as we talk at India Game Developers Conference in Hyderabad, India. Now, Tiger is at Paradox Development Studio as the studio manager of Studio Black, and the former lead producer for Crusader Kings 3. She even stood in front of a suit of armor to drop the game&#x27;s first tease.


 An RPG-esque lifestyle system and neat backstab choices that deal with information round out Crusader Kings 3&#x27;s host of improvements over its excellent predecessor. A court-themed expansion and a revamp of the game’s culture system after launch are a testament to Paradox’s resolve to deliver a refined plotting experience. Holy wars and illicit affairs go hand in hand in the world of Crusader Kings and the third iteration is no different. Weaving together systems to consistently deliver emergent gameplay is no simple feat, and it turns out that production also covers all manner of small but essential, and practical things. As the lead producer on a game as complex as Crusader Kings 3, Tiger had her work cut out for her.

                              <span>Achievements are now part and parcel of the video gaming landscape, but that doesn&#x27;t mean we have to like them. Indeed, the debate over whether the little reward messages add anything to games or not has been reignited today on Twitter by developers, with Ubisoft Massive&#x27;s lead gameplay designer Fredrik Thylander saying they&#x27;ve been actively &quot;bad for gaming&quot;. So we thought we&#x27;d put the question to you, readers. Do you agree and think achievements have been a blight on the industry, or do you think they&#x27;re actually good way of getting more out of a game? Come and tell us in the comments.

                              <span>Microsoft were hoping to complete their takeover of Activision Blizzard by the end of their financial year in June. That’s looking less likely now that the US Federal Trade Commission have published a schedule that sets dates for final hearings to decide on the merger, and they&#x27;re going to begin on August 2nd. As this is just the kick off for hearings about the case, it’s likely that any FTC decision on whether the $68.7 billion (£56 billion) deal can go ahead will take some time to emerge.

                              <span>The AMD Radeon RX 6950 XT is the flagship graphics card in the Radeon RX 6000 series, and one of the most powerful graphics cards on the market even after the release of the first Radeon RX 7000 series cards. It is designed for gaming enthusiasts, content creators, and professionals who demand the highest levels of performance from their graphics card - and now that the next gen is out, this bleeding-edge card has been heavily reduced. In fact, you can now pick this up on Amazon for $730, a $370 reduction from the $1100 price this XFX Speedster Merc319 card launched at in August last year.

The discussion is timely, though, as the big release of the week is One Piece Odyssey, Bandai Namco&#x27;s impressive RPG based on the popular anime. John Carson, who is reviewing the game for Game Informer, returns to talk about his experience and share his favorite games of 2022. We are also joined by former Game Informer editor and former host of this very podcast, Benjamin Reeves! Reeves makes his triumphant return to The Game Informer Show to also share his favorite games of 2022 and, alongside Wesley LeBlanc, reveal just how little they know about One Piece with our Devil Fruit quiz.

                              <span>Developer Scavengers Studio revealed last month that it was releasing Season: A Letter To The Future on January 31, and now, just a few weeks ahead of that, the studio has released a gorgeous new story trailer. 
This new trailer provides yet another beautiful glimpse into the painterly world of Season while providing new details about what our protagonist is doing: archiving the end of the Earth and the final people still living on it. She strives to capture their final moments in her journal and with her camera, aiming to learn why they&#x27;re still around and ultimately, what kept them going. It sounds like quite the emotional journey.

                              <span>Developer Motive Studio and publisher EA have released a new story trailer for its upcoming remake of Dead Space, and the game continues to look terrifying and beautiful. 
Due out on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC later this month on January 27, this might be one of our last looks at the remake before it&#x27;s in the hands of players. Fortunately, this new trailer is nearly two minutes of cinematics and gameplay from the remake focused on the story of Dead Space. As expected, this remake isn&#x27;t changing much at all, utilizing the same story from the original 2008 release with updated visuals and audio (plus some new voice lines for protagonist Isaac Clarke). 
Check out the new Dead Space Remake &quot;Humanity Ends Here&quot; trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Dead Space Remake continues to look great and we can&#x27;t wait to play it in just a few weeks.

Marvel Snap has been a resounding success since its release, allowing players to compete against other real-world players with a variety of cards, random locations, and more. Despite the positive reception, one thing players have been asking for has been missing: the ability to play against your friends. Developer Second Dinner announced in November that it was working on an update to allow friends to battle each other and now, it has announced that this update is expected at the end of the month. 
More specifically, the update is expected in a January 31 update, but Second Dinner says if it runs &quot;into any last minutes issues, we may choose to delay for a little longer t…</span>

                              <span>Former pirate IPTV operator Bill Omar Carrasquillo has remained in the public eye since his arrest in 2019. Better known as YouTuber &#x27;Omi in a Hellcat&#x27;, Carrasquillo continues to appear in videos documenting his life. Meanwhile, his co-defendants are rarely mentioned in public. Michael Barone, for example, who will now forfeit all gains attributable to the pirate service.

                              <span>Academic publishers have tried various options to shut down Sci-Hub, without the desired result. Thus far, it appears that the site&#x27;s reach is only growing. A new study among thousands of researchers finds that the majority use pirate libraries to bypass paywalls. Lack of access is cited as the prime reason but, worryingly, many researchers also find shadow libraries easier to use than legal alternatives.

                              <span>The sea is harsh, but game development can be harsher. Ubisoft&#x27;s pirate &#x27;em up Skull and Bones has been delayed yet again, despite already having being delayed for the fifth time last September. It was due for March, but this latest delay pushes it back to &quot;early&quot; in the financial year 2023-24, which begins in July.  
At least it&#x27;s (sea)faring better than three other unannounced Ubisoft games, which have been cancelled thanks to Ubisoft&#x27;s general underperforming sails. Sorry, sales.

                              <span>In Vengeful Guardian: Moonrider you might just be the bad guy. You have Metroid-inspired traversal abilities, a Mega Man X sword, and a platter of six levels and bosses to pursue in any order you choose. But are you doing the right thing? The important thing is it feels good to play and is incredibly reminiscent of the 16-bit era of video games in the best way.

                              <span>Now that 2022 is in the rearview, it&#x27;s time to look forward to all that the new year has to offer. While last year brought some of the best gaming experiences of recent memory, 2023 has seemingly unlimited potential. From mainstay franchises by our favorite developers to new IPs and fresh faces, this year promises a lot in the realm of video games – and we probably don&#x27;t even know many of the games coming in 2023.

                              <span>Microsoft has announced an Xbox and Bethesda Developer Direct, a new games showcase &quot;providing fans an inside look at some of the games coming to Xbox, PC, and Game Pass over the next few months.&quot; 
It will air on January 25 and feature Xbox studios like Arkane Austin, Mojang Studios, Turn 10 Studios, and ZeniMax Online Studios. This Developer Direct will &quot;focus on big features, extended gameplay showcases, and the latest info for Xbox games launching in the next few months,&quot; including The Elder Scrolls Online, Forza Motorsport, Minecraft Legends, and Redfall. 
You might notice a big galaxy-sized absence in this lineup: Starfield. Fret not, Xbox says a standalone Starfield show is in the works &quot;to dedicate the proper amount of time for a deep dive&quot; into the game. 
As for what to expect for each game, Xbox has detailed that too. For The Elder Scrolls Online, ZeniMax Online Studios will unveil 2023&#x27;s major chapter update, &quot;including the latest regions of Tamriel to become playable in ESO, as well as a major new feature coming in the game&#x27;s biggest update this year.&quot; A full &quot;ESO Chapter Reveal Event&quot; will follow this Developer Direct. On the Forza Motorsport side of things, Turn 10 Studios will be sharing more gameplay and new details about the game. 
Mojang Studios will showcase a new look into Minecraft Legends&#x27; upcoming PvP multiplayer experience and Arkane Austin will &quot;showcase several minutes of gameplay&quot; from Redfall, including both single player and multiplayer gameplay. Fans can expect to learn more about combat, customization, bosses, the open world, and more, according to Xbox. 
The Xbox and Bethesda Developer Direct airs on Wednesday, January 25, at 12 p.m. PT/ 3 p.m. ET.

The company cites &quot;major challenges as the industry continues to shift towards mega-brands and long-lasting titles that can reach players across the globe, across platforms and business models.&quot; It says that over the last four years, its strategy has been about building &quot;long-lasting live games and adapting our strongest franchises&quot; like Assassin&#x27;s Creed, Far Cry, and Tom Clancy games like Ghost Recon, Rainbow Six, and The Division &quot;to converging trends to make them truly global brands.&quot;

                              <span>Final Fantasy XVI is due out June 22 exclusively on PlayStation 5, but some fans believe a PC version of the game could release as soon as six months after its console debut. However, FF16 producer Naoki Yoshida isn&#x27;t sure why. 
During a recent Final Fantasy XIV stream, Yoshida, who is a director on that game, was asked about rumors surrounding a PC version of FF16, and he responded, &quot;I don&#x27;t know where the notion of a PC version releasing six months after the game is out came from as none of us have ever said that,&quot; according to a translator, as reported by Eurogamer. He followed it up with two instances urging fans to buy the PS5 version. 
According to a translation by Siliconera, Yoshida also said, &quot;There&#x27;s been talk that the PC version will come out, but no one on the team has said anything about the PC version. I wonder why people assume the PC version will arrive six months after [the PS5 version], so just go ahead and buy a PS5.&quot; 
The talk of a PC version of the game stems from a promotional PlayStation 5 video released last year that says in small print that FF16 will be a &quot;PS5 exclusive for six months.&quot; Some extrapolated from this small print that a PC release of the game will come after that six months of exclusivity is up, but if Yoshida&#x27;s recent comments are any indication, the team has nothing to say in regards to a PC version. 
Final Fantasy XVI hits PlayStation 5 on June 22. While waiting for more information, watch this &quot;Ambition&quot; trailer that reveals more about Valisthea&#x27;s kingdoms, dominants, and eikons, and then check out our interview with Yoshida about the game&#x27;s boss fights.

Instead of simply sending letters in the mail, some cease-and-desist notices will be delivered in person. A recent IPTV crackdown resulted in the identification of over 1,000 subscribers, who will be asked to immediately stop any illegal activity, or else.

First revealed back in 2014, Dead Island 2 was in development at Spec Ops: The Line developer Yager, with Dead Island developer Techland having parted ways with the property to work on Dying Light. Publisher Deep Silver handed over development of the game to LittleBigPlanet 3 developer Sumo Digital in 2016, and then, in 2019, the company announced that Homefront: The Revolution developer Dambuster Studios would be developing Dead Island 2. It&#x27;s now 2023 and Dambuster&#x27;s Dead Island 2 is due out in April, finally.

The leak purportedly reveals unused artwork and an alternative storyline for the iconic arcade game, first released by Midway in 1993. Three decades later, the current rightsholder seems keen to plug the leaks.

                              <span>These days, box offices are dominated by comic-book and superhero movies from Marvel and DC. Unfortunately, while superhero movies have improved dramatically over the last decade, superheroes haven’t been as powerful in the realm of video games. In fact, nearly 40 years after the first superhero video game, many developers still struggle to create worthwhile experiences using some of the biggest names in entertainment today.
While not all superhero games are monumental duds like Superman on Nintendo 64, many tend to deliver middling, forgettable experiences. However, a select few that defy the stereotype to become superb titles we still look back on fondly as not only great superhero games, but terrific video games in their own rights.

                              <span>Weapon durability and its application in games have long been hot topics amongst players. Some love it, some are fine with it, and others hate it. And those feelings vary depending on who you are talking to about this topic. I think of games like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild when someone brings up weapon durability, as it was a hotly debated aspect of its release (I didn&#x27;t mind it at all, personally). 
Love it or hate it, weapon durability is a feature that will likely never go away in games, and that&#x27;s okay because when it&#x27;s done right, it can be a helpful way to push players toward something new. In 2011&#x27;s Dead Island, weapon durability was a big part of the experience, and that feature will return in Dead Island 2 when it hits PlayStation and Xbox consoles, and PC, on April 2…</span>

                              <span>Don&#x27;t expect The Last of Us HBO show to extend beyond the story of the two games in the series. That&#x27;s because The Last of Us game director Neil Druckmann says there are no plans for stories beyond the games in this show.
This news comes by way of a new interview with Druckmann from The Hollywood Reporter, as reported by GameSpot. Here&#x27;s what Druckmann told THR specifically: &quot;We have no plans to tell any stories beyond adapting the games. We won&#x27;t run into the same issue as Game of Thrones since The Last of Us Part: II doesn&#x27;t end on a cliffhanger.&quot; 


Druckmann and TV series writer Craig Mazin have mentioned that a second season of this show might cover the events of The Last of Us Part II (personally, I think The Last of Us Part II could cover two seasons of television). Despite the duo not wanting the show to go beyond the games, there might be a way for the show to cover more ground after the events of The Last of Us Part II. If Naughty Dog were to develop a theoretical The Last of Us Part III, it wouldn&#x27;t be surprising if the HBO show covered that down the road. Chances seem pretty good considering Druckmann told THR that there is &quot;more story to tell&quot; in the world of The Last of Us games. 
Mazin also touched on his desire not to extend the show beyond the games in the THR interview, as noted by GameSpot, stating that he doesn&#x27;t &quot;have any interest in a spinning-plates-go-on-forever show.&quot; 
&quot;When it becomes a perpetual motion machine, it just can&#x27;t help but get kind of...stupid,&quot; he continued. &quot;Endings mean everything to me.&quot; 
For more about The Last of Us on HBO, read our interview with Joel actor Pedro Pascal and Druckmann about the changes made for this TV show. Check out this new piece of concept art from The Last of Us multiplayer game that Naughty Dog is currently developing after that.

                              <span>The Last of Us is not the first adaptation from video game to film and it certainly won’t be the last. But perhaps more than any property that has moved from interactive medium to passive television, The Last of Us seems most suited to make the transition. Joel and Ellie’s story is an emotional and cinematic one that does not rely on player choice.
Ahead of the show’s premiere we spoke with some of the actors about the adaptation, as well as Neil Druckmann, co-creator of The Last of Us, who was heavily involved in writing the show and directed a few episodes.
Druckmann is no stranger to directing actors, even if the recording process of a TV show is different from how it works in a video game. “There is a certain luxury we have in video games that when we capture a performance, we have eve…</span>

                              <span>What do you get when you blend Mega Man X, Ninja Gaiden, and Bionic Commando? You get Gravity Circuit, a promising indie action title launching later this year. 
Players control Kai, a lone warrior battling an evil robotic army in a post-apocalyptic world. This side-scrolling action title boasts plenty of satisfying action thanks to Kai’s fun melee combat, nimble platforming abilities, and his signature grappling hook, which he uses to traverse levels as well as yank and toss enemies. Sporting great 16-bit art and a strong soundtrack, Gravity Circuit is worth keeping an eye on for fans of classic throwbacks. 
Join editors Wesley LeBlanc and Marcus Stewart as they explore Gravity Circuit’s free Steam demo and discuss why it may be one of the year’s most exciting indie gems.

Many JRPGs have slow openings, taking their time to establish the story and familiarize the player with the mechanics before letting them loose into the world. I figured that was the case after playing an hour of Dragon Quest Treasures, so I said to myself, “It’ll get good soon!” I said it again two hours in, three hours in, and five hours in, until eventually, I was forced to accept that this was as good as the game would get. Dragon Quest Treasures is never short on charm or style, but simple, sub-par combat and loot-hunting mechanics had me scraping the bo…</span>

In 1999, Konami put the fear of fog in a generation of players with the release of Silent Hill. The eerie title eschewed the more bombastic horror of its main rival at the time, Resident Evil, in favor of more psychological frights. Protagonist Harry Mason must embark on a terrifying search for his missing daughter, Cheryl, within the eerie town of Silent Hill. What unfolds is a descent into madness that kickstarted a franchise that&#x27;s (finally) returning to the limelight after years of dormancy. Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Kyle Hilliard, as we survive Silent Hill’s debut adventure and see how its scares stack up 23 years later.

                              <span>Sony released a sneak peek of its upcoming Gran Turismo movie yesterday evening during its CES 2023 press conference, and as expected, it features a lot of fast vehicles. 
Starring David Harbour (Stranger Things), Orlando Bloom (Pirates of the Caribbean, The Lord of the Rings), and David Barnet (Never Have I Ever), and directed by Neil Blomkamp (District 9, Elysium, Chappie), Gran Turismo is based on a true story. That story is about the GT Academy contest, which was a real contest held between 2008 and 2016 by Sony and Nissan. Winners were given entrance into Nissan&#x27;s Driver Development Program, as noted by Video Games Chronicle. The film appears to be telling the tale of someone who won entrance into this program and then went on to become a real success in the racing world. 
Check out the Gran Turismo sneak peek for yourself below: 


As you can see, this sneak peek is a mix of what appears to be movie footage and behind-the-scenes footage, with stars like Harbour, Barnet, and Bloom talking about their excitement for the film. 
Gran Turismo hits theaters later this year on August 11. 
Alongside this sneak peek, Sony also revealed that Gran Turismo 7, the latest in the long-running series released last year, will be getting an update that makes the game playable on its upcoming PSVR2 platform. 
While waiting to learn more about this Gran Turismo movie, read about Project Leonardo, a new customizable accessibility controller kit PlayStation unveiled yesterday and then read about how the PlayStation 5 has surpassed 30 million units sold.

I had always observed the Fire Emblem series from a distance, worried its strategy gameplay wouldn’t be for me or stressed determining where best to start and how to play through the franchise’s various entries. Fire Emblem Three Houses was the first I gave a good try and 80-plus hours later, it’s one of my favorite games on Switch and turned me into a Fire Emblem fan. Since its reveal, I’ve looked at Fire Emblem Engage as a test bed: am I actually a Fire Emblem fan, or did I just really like Three Houses and its engaging Hogwarts-like school mechanics? If the 10 hours I’ve put into Engage so far are any indication, I’m happy to say it’s the former. 
Engage isn’t…</span>

                              <span>Sony Interactive Entertainment has revealed that it has sold more than 30 million PlayStation 5 units since the console&#x27;s launch in 2020. 
This news comes by way of the company&#x27;s recent CES 2023 appearance, where PlayStation CEO Jim Ryan revealed these numbers alongside words that seem to indicate the PS5 shortage might be over, or at least coming to an end soon. PlayStation also touched on its upcoming PSVR2 release and accompanying 30-plus game lineup, and pulled back the curtains on its new customizable accessibility controller kit, Project Leonardo. 
As you can see, it seems Ryan and PlayStation are confident in the supply of PS5 consoles around the world. If you&#x27;re still on the lookout for one, it seems now is the time to start searching retail stores again.

                              <span>PlayStation has unveiled Project Leonardo, a &quot;highly customizable accessibility controller kit.&quot; 
The company revealed this during its CES 2023 presentation yesterday, stating that the kit is &quot;designed to remove barriers to gaming and help players with disabilities play more easily, more comfortably, and for longer periods on PS5.&quot; It seems to be PlayStation&#x27;s answer to Xbox&#x27;s Adaptive Controller also aimed at accessibility for gamers. The company says it has worked with accessibility experts at organizations like AbleGamers, Special Effect, and Stack Up, as well as community members and game developers to design a controller kit like this that works &quot;out of the box.&quot;

Arcade1Up&#x27;s new Deluxe Edition cabinets serve as the new flagship line for the company, offering up a taller, single-cabinet design that removes the long-standing need to buy a riser. Arcade1Up kicks off its Deluxe Edition lineup with four distinct cabinets: Pac-Man Deluxe, Ms. Pac-Man Deluxe, Class of &#x27;81 Deluxe, and Mortal Kombat Deluxe.

                              <span>The Last of Us turns 10 years old in June, and Naughty Dog plans to celebrate the milestone with an array of special announcements along the way. One of those updates involves a closer look at the upcoming standalone multiplayer title.
In a blog post, Naughty Dog co-president Neil Druckmann reflects on The Last of Us’ legacy as well as the franchise’s future. In addition to the HBO adaptation premiering on January 15 and the PC port of The Last of Us Part 1 hitting in March, Druckmann states fans will learn more about the long-awaited multiplayer experience that serves as a follow-up to the original game’s Factions mode. Druckmann writes,
“We’ll have some fun surprises for you along the way, but later this year we will begin to offer you some details on our ambitious The Last of Us multiplayer game. With a team led by Vinit Agarwal, Joe Pettinati, and Anthony Newman, the project is shaping up to be a fresh, new experience from our studio, but one rooted in Naughty Dog’s passion for delivering incredible stories, characters, and gameplay.”
Naughty Dog also shares a new piece of concept art, posted in full below, which is the first new material of the game since it released the first concept asset last June. It depicts two survivors heading toward a dilapidated cruise ship. 
Though we’ll be learning more about the game this year, it’s still unknown if Naughty Dog plans to launch it in 2023. That would be fitting given the anniversary, but we&#x27;ll have to wait and see over the coming months. Until then, be sure to check out this feature on how The Last of Us Part 1 proves there&#x27;s no such thing as a faithful remake.</span>

                              <span>Wizards of the Coast, the company behind Dungeons &amp; Dragons and Magic: The Gathering, has reportedly canceled five unannounced games alongside layoffs affecting &quot;fewer than 15 people,&quot; according to a new Bloomberg report. 
The people that will lose their jobs will be given a chance to apply for new roles within WotC, but this apparent business restructuring will affect others outside of the company as well. Bloomberg reports that this reorganization will hit Otherside Entertainment and Hidden Path Entertainment, both working on games for WotC, hard. News of this change follows the release of Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Dark Alliance&#x27;s release last year, which didn&#x27;t fare too well with critics and players, amidst Larian Studios&#x27; continued development on Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 (which does not seem to be affected by this reorganization despite WotC serving as the game&#x27;s publisher). 
These two games, in part, represented WotC&#x27;s bigger forray into the video game space as Bloomberg reports that the company had signed contracts with several studios to make games. WotC also &quot;built at least six of its own game studios,&quot; according to the publication. 
One project in the works that is now canceled went under the codename &quot;Jabberwocky,&quot; according to Bloomberg, and two more externally developed games early in development are no longer moving forward as well. These cancelations and layoffs comes as parent company Hasbro&#x27;s shares fell 40% last year. 
Wotc told IGN that it remains &quot;committed to using digital games as a cornerstone of our strategy for bringing our games to players around the world,&quot; adding that it has &quot;made some changes to our long-term portfolio to focus on games which are strategically aligned with developing our existing brands and those which show promise in expanding or engaging our audience in new ways.&quot;

Roughly 300 QA workers at ZeniMax voted to indicate they wish to join this union, equating to a supermajority vote, and Microsoft has opted to recognize it. This lines up with what Microsoft said last month, where it announced that if these workers vote to unionize, it would voluntarily recognize the union. ZeniMax is the first studio in Microsoft&#x27;s umbrella of teams to unionize and it&#x27;s also now the largest group of unionized QA testers at any US-based studio.

                              <span>Fall Guys is becoming Invincible with the arrival of skins from the acclaimed animated series this week.
With season 2 of Invincible set to premiere on Amazon Prime sometime this year, Fall Guys is whetting fans’ appetite with skins for Mark, Omni-Man, and Atom Eve. The outfits hit the in-game store on January 5, and that hopefully means a release date announcement for the series won&#x27;t be too far behind.

Fall Guys enjoyed a bit of a renaissance in 2022. In addition to its usual deluge of seasonal content updates, it went free-to-play in May and launched on Xbox and Switch, gaining a larger player base of contestants and renewed interest in general. We look forward to seeing what 2023 brings for the title, but this is a pretty good start.

                              <span>Polish developer The Astronauts have revealed a new trailer for their upcoming rogue-lite shooter Witchfire. In addition to showing off some new gameplay clips, it announces that the game will use NVIDIA DLSS3 technology, which a press release says will &quot;massively boost performance.&quot; You can watch the trailer below.


Announced by NVIDIA last September, DLSS 3 can boost a game&#x27;s performance by a significant margin. One demo on NVIDIA&#x27;s site shows two instances of Cyberpunk 2077 running at 96 FPS with ray tracing still enabled. &quot;DLSS 3 allows the seemingly impossible, high framerate without compromising the visuals,&quot; Adrian Chmielarz, creative director and co-founder of The Astronauts says in a press release. &quot;A no brainer for a game like Witchfire, which is both action and beauty.&quot;
Witchfire is a dark fantasy first-person shooter from the creators of Painkiller, Bulletstorm, and The Vanishing of Ethan Carter. Set in an alternate reality, players are caught in the middle of a war between witches and the Church, and must use weapons and powers from Vatican sorcerers to defeat their enemies. 
The game is set to enter Early Access in the Epic Games Store sometime later this year, though that wasn&#x27;t always the case. It was delayed last October because the team decided to overhaul the world&#x27;s design and make it more open. This trailer is a good indication that the studio is still hard at work, though; here&#x27;s hoping that &quot;early 2023&quot; ends up being as soon as possible.</span>

Especially notable are the new vehicle variants feature for NewGRFs and automatic flipping support for shorten-than-default NewGRF-defined vehicles. On the fixing side, focus was on polishing the new fractional GUI zoom and some other minor bits and pieces.
