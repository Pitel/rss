                              <span>Get your skates on.
The debut title for South Australian-based indie studio Melonhead Games, Rooftop Renegade, looks to be a mix between OlliOlli World&#x27;s slick skating platforming and the art of rollerblading (or &#x27;hoverblading&#x27;, if we&#x27;re being picky). What&#x27;s more, publisher The IndiEXP has announced that the title will be rolling its way onto Switch on 17th February.
It is true, this is certainly a departure from the chilled out vibes of last year&#x27;s skater-platformer — there&#x27;s far more guns and explosions this time around — but it is nice to see the 2D skating (even if it is of the roller-kind) coming through.

Publisher Atari has announced Caverns of Mars Recharged, the latest in its line of revamped classic titles for the Nintendo Switch.
Launching on March 9th, 2023, the game will feature single-player and local co-op for two players as you navigate through 30 unique missions set in three core &quot;depths&quot; of Mars. Enemies will be plentiful and ammo limited, so you&#x27;ll need to be adept at dodging obstacles and blasting your way through debris to ensure your survival.

It was back in August that we last heard of Saga of Sins — the demon hunting action platformer that looks like a moving stained glass window — but publisher Just For Games has now announced that this sin-slaying cleric will be bringing his religious rebellion to Switch on 30th March, 2023.
For those of you who missed the initial announcement, Saga of Sins sees you play as a mind-hopping cleric on a mission to purge the seven deadly sins from the thoughts of a local village. Sounds weird enough? Well, developers Bonus Level Entertainment ensure that it only gets stranger from here! The cleric can take on four different forms to combat these beasties (a werewolf, gargoyle, griffin and one more mystery transformation) and the whole thing takes place with a particularly church-y visual style.

Fire Emblem Engage has been widely praised at launch, but it seems the day one update may have introduced one minor issue tied to the title&#x27;s cooperative multiplayer Relay Trials mode. As highlighted by Nintendo&#x27;s official customer support social media account, the gaming giant is aware of player reports and is &quot;currently investigating&quot; the problem.
As explained by Siliconera, the issue occurs when selecting &quot;take over&quot; after &quot;random&quot; in the Relay Trials. When selecting &quot;take over&quot; - it will come up with the current message &quot;no data to take over&quot;. Here&#x27;s a rough translation of Nintendo&#x27;s customer support tweet:

‘Ey up, adventure fans! Are you hankering for a grave-robbing escapade reminiscent of Indiana Jones? But do you wish it were set in Yorkshire, trading jaw-dropping Incan ziggurats for drizzly moors? Well, have we got t’ game for you!
The Excavation of Hob&#x27;s Barrow puts your clicking finger in the shoes of one Thomasina Bateman, roving archaeologist and author. The book she’s compiling is a survey of the barrows of England – barrows being burial mounds. The latest lump of dirt to be profiled in this riveting tome is the game’s titular Hob’s Barrow, on the outskirts of the simple Yorkshire village of Bewlay.

Fire Emblem Engage arrived on the scene last week, and as usual, dataminers have been sifting through the game&#x27;s files to uncover hidden secrets. One, in particular, that seems to have gained some traction focuses on the latest entry&#x27;s codename.
Based on previous datamines, it&#x27;s known how Fire Emblem games follow a certain pattern when it comes to their development codenames. As explained by modder and dataminer &#x27;DeathChaos25&#x27; on Twitter, Fire Emblem Engage is internally coded as &quot;Iron19&quot;. Where it gets interesting is the fact the previous mainline game Fire Emblem: Three Houses is codenamed &quot;Iron17&quot;.

When Sega&#x27;s new open-zone game Sonic Frontiers made its debut on the Nintendo Switch and multiple other platforms last November, players were able to pick up an iconic pair of Sonic Adventure 2 shoes by signing up to the company&#x27;s newsletter.

If you still want these shoes but haven&#x27;t got around to signing up - you better hurry up. Sega has issued a reminder that there&#x27;s only &quot;one week&quot; left to get the Sonic Adventure 2 shoes, so make sure you sign up by 31st January 2023.

                              <span>Expected to be squared away in time for the Linux 6.3 kernel cycle, which is kicking off in February, is Automatic IBRS as a new feature of Zen 4 processors. The patches already have been queued up into TIP&#x27;s x86/cpu branch so barring any issues will be all wired up for this next kernel version. Automatic IBRS can provide better performance than the Retpolines implementation used currently on Zen 4 and prior CPUs as part of the Spectre V2 mitigations. With the switch over to Automatic IBRS for Zen 4, it means better performance in some areas as shown by these benchmarks today with AMD 4th Gen EPYC &quot;Genoa&quot; processors.</span>

                              <span>Source code for fantasy MOBA League Of Legends and its autobattler spin-off Teamfight Tactics has been stolen and ransomed, Riot Games have confirmed. In a series of tweets, the developer revealed that the code was taken in an attack on their systems last week. Demands have been made by the hackers, which Riot say they won’t stump up for. The hack is being investigated both by Riot and law enforcement agencies, but Riot insist that League Of Legends players’ personal data and information weren’t compromised by the hackers.

                              <span>I was absolutely elated when Square Enix announced a new Final Fantasy Theatrhythm game during the Tokyo Game Show last year, as there&#x27;s been a Final Fantasy music game shaped hole in my life for the best part of a decade. I played the pair of Theatrhythm 3DS games to absolute death back in the day, and was hoping that Squeenix&#x27;s newfound PC love-in would mean I&#x27;d be able to write about it non-stop when Theatrhythm Final Bar Line comes out on February 16th. Alas, that joy was immediately curtailed when I saw FBL wasn&#x27;t, in fact, coming to PC at all, and would remain a Switch and PS4-only game for the foreseeable future. But that&#x27;s okay, because YouTuber Gloomhonk has created the perfect antidote to my Theatrhythm woes in the form of their brilliant Trombone Champ rendition of FF VII&#x27;s Those Who Fight Further. Come and have a listen.

In the latest unusual twist in The Day Before&#x27;s development, Fntastic shared a statement explaining the delay that credits it to a US trademark filing that the company overlooked. Oddly, The Day Before’s store page also seems to have disappeared from Steam within the past day.

In a Twitter thread from Microsoft&#x27;s 365 Status account, they said the problems have been caused by “networking configuration issues”, and that a recent network change had been rolled back. It&#x27;s hoped this will solve the access problems people have faced trying to use these services this morning, but lingering issues may still be kicking about.

                              <span>Justin Roiland has resigned from Squanch Games following domestic abuse charges. 
The High On Life Twitter account released a statement yesterday, revealing that the studio received Roiland&#x27;s resignation on January 16. Squanch says it will &quot;keep developing games we know our fans will love while continuing to support and improve High On Life.&quot;

This statement came just a couple of hours after the official Rick and Morty Twitter account posted a statement revealing that Adult Swim has ended its association with Roiland. However, Rick and Morty will continue and the current talent and crew is currently working on Season 7. 
The titular charcters of the show will be recast as Roiland provided the voice for both of them.

All of this comes after news broke on January 12 that Roiland had been charged with domestic violence charges in Orange County, California, in relation to an alleged 2020 incident. As reported by The Hollywood Reporter, a May 2020 felony complaint reveals Roiland has been charged with one count of domestic battery with corporal injury and one count of false imprisonment by menace, violence, fraud or deceit. The complaint says these charges come from a Jane Doe &quot;who was in a dating relationship with the defendant.&quot; 
Roiland pleaded not guilty and was released on a $50,000 bond in August 2020. During a pre-trial hearing that happened earlier this month, Roiland&#x27;s attorney said Roiland heard a plea offer, but not other details regarding it or whether Roiland was taking it have been revealed. 
Squanch Games was co-founded by Roiland in 2016 and in its tenure thus far has developed Accounting+, PlayStation VR game Trover Saves The Universe, and last year&#x27;s High On Life.</span>

Pokémon is owned by a number of companies, leading to a complicated relationship for the valuable brand and its parents. When asked if he could explain the relationship between Game Freak, Nintendo, and The Pokémon Company, while visiting Game Freak in 2017, co-founder Junichi Masuda turned to a white board behind him to draw out his explanation.
After drawing circles for Game Freak, Nintendo, and former producer Creatures, Masuda explained. “Game Freak? We develop all the main Pokémon games. Originally, Creatures, they were the producers of the game. Nintendo was the seller of the games – the distributor. So that was the original structure of Pokémon games. In terms of who owns the rights to the games, it’s these three companies.”

                              <span>Rick and Morty creator also dropped by Adult Swim
Justin Roiland, the creator of popular Adult Swim series Rick and Morty, has resigned as CEO of developer Squanch Games — The studio behind the recently released sci-fi shooter High on Life.
The announcement of the resignation comes less than 24 hours after TV network Adult Swim also announced that it had terminated its relationship with the Roiland, after the producer was officially charged with felony domestic battery with corporal injury and false imprisonment by menace, violence, fraud, and/or deceit, as reported by NBC News.
https://twitter.com/SquanchGames/status/1618049809256185856?s&#x3D;20&amp;t&#x3D;xRyA96fenpaQ8QeeqbwnWg
The charges, which stem from an incident that reportedly took place in January 2020 were first leveled against Justin Roiland in May 2020, with the producer having already faced several court hearings on the case. This week, however, has been the first time the events have been brought to light by the mainstream media. Roiland has pleaded Not Guilty to all charges. A date for the trial is yet to be set.
In the wake of the charges coming to light, Kotaku unearthed a previously unreported lawsuit wherein a former Squanch Games employee claims that she was sexually harassed by a male co-worker while at the studio, and later fired for &quot;poor performance&quot; after she filed an official complaint about the incident with management. This case, which took place in 2018, was eventually settled in September of 2019. It should be noted that the co-worker in question is not Roiland.
Adult Swim has noted that it will continue the production of Season 7 of Rick &amp; Morty with the lead characters expected to be recast.

With the success of HBO&#x27;s adaptation of The Last of Us, the future for game-to-TV adaptations is looking brighter than ever. We don&#x27;t have a ton of info on Amazon&#x27;s Fallout series as of yet, but based on my optimism and some unofficial photos of the set that have leaked on Twitter, it looks like this series will at least have the set design to contend with some of the greats that have come before it. A fan who goes by J Carson on Twitter found the show&#x27;s set still under construction in New York and was able to snap a whole series of photos, which feature the real-life replica of Fallout&#x27;s famed Red Rocket filling station.

Overwatch 2 is a constant balancing act of buffing and nerfing heroes as the meta changes, and the character on the chopping block this time around is none other than everyone&#x27;s favorite hook-wielding heavyweight, Roadhog. He was known for his hook-shoot-melee combo that could kill players in one shot, which I knew all too well as a Mercy main.
The Overwatch 2 devs said that &quot;these changes aim to reduce the frustration of dying in one shot immediately after being hooked and pulled by Roadhog,&quot; while also reassuring players that his hook is still a &quot;powerful utility to forcibly reposition enemy players.&quot; The full details of Roadhog&#x27;s nerf are as follows per the official patch notes:

It’s another Tuesday, which means tonight there will be a new episode of the Spot Dodge Podcast exclusively on Destructoid. Topics: The Spot Dodge crew discusses the latest entry in the Fire Emblem series, Fire Emblem Engage.

The nominees for the 2023 Independent Games Festival Awards are locked in. And after a stellar year for independent games, the categories look pretty packed with viable candidates.
Both action-adventure game Tunic and dreamlike RPG Betrayal at Club Low leads the nominations at three apiece. Some other familiar faces from awards season also appear, including Immortality, Neon White, and NORCO.
Of course, the IGFs are also great for finding hidden gems you missed in the year prior, and the 2023 nominees are no different. While you might be aware of some notable breakouts, there may be some lesser-known games hanging around in the nominees or honorable mentions worth checking out.

Proletariat, a studio under Activision Blizzard, has withdrawn its bid for unionization. In a statement today, the Communication Workers of America pins the fault on Proletariat CEO Seth Sivak.
In a statement (via GamesIndustry.biz) on the matter, the CWA—which has worked with other organizing studios under Activision Blizzard—confirms it has withdrawn its request for a representative election at Proletariat.
&quot;Unfortunately, Proletariat CEO Seth Sivak chose to follow Activision Blizzard&#x27;s lead and responded to the workers&#x27; desire to form a union with confrontational tactics,&quot; reads the CWA&#x27;s statement. &quot;Like many founders, he took the workers&#x27; concerns as a personal attack and held a series of meetings that demoralized and disempowered the group…</span>

                              <span>Bungie is already on the case
The way games are made these days, any small change can send the whole house of cards toppling down — live service games are in an even more precarious situation due to constant updates. Destiny 2 is currently taking a hit in this regard, and a pretty big one at that. The issue has caused the progress of some of the Triumphs to reset, which has removed already-earned Seals from some players. Of course, those affected aren&#x27;t exactly thrilled, as the Triumph objectives take a great deal of time and effort to complete, but thankfully Bungie is already working on a hotfix, as they announced on Twitter this morning.

Bungie also stated that they&#x27;re extending the ongoing maintenance time for the hotfix by four hours, meaning the new end time will be 2 PM PT / 5 PM ET. The game will go offline shortly to get everything sorted, so here&#x27;s hoping it doesn&#x27;t take long to get things back on track.
This bug entered the game after the release of Hotfix 6.3.0.5, which got rid of blue engrams and therefore removed the soft gear cap — now players who were otherwise maxed out will receive Glimmer drops instead. It&#x27;s a welcome change that players have been asking for, but unfortunately, this bug has soured the mood in the community a bit.

                              <span>Riot say it&#x27;s not paying the ransom
League of Legends studio Riot Games has now confirmed that, following a recent cyberattack, hackers took source code for both League of Legends and Teamfight Tactics, as well as a legacy anti-cheat platform. But after being sent a ransom demand, Riot says it won&#x27;t be paying.
Last week, Riot announced its systems were compromised in a social engineering attack, a method that also resulted in the massive Grand Theft Auto leak last  year. No player or personal data was obtained, but today Riot confirms that source code for the aforementioned programs was taken. The attackers submitted a ransom demand, but Riot Games says it will not be paying.
&quot;While this attack disrupted our build environment and could cause issues in the future, most importantly we remain confident that no player data or player personal information was compromised,&quot; said Riot in a statement. &quot;Truthfully, any exposure of source code can increase the likelihood of new cheats emerging. Since the attack, we’ve been working to assess its impact on anticheat and to be prepared to deploy fixes as quickly as possible if needed.&quot;
Prototypes and sources
While the source code contained a number of experimental features, Riot says most of it is in prototype and may or may not be released in the future. The company is working with external consultants to audit the attack, and plans to release a report on it in the future. Also, Riot confirms it is working with law enforcement as they investigate the group behind the attack.
&quot;We’ve made a lot of progress since last week and we believe we’ll have things repaired later in the week, which will allow us to remain on our regular patch cadence going forward,&quot; reads Riot&#x27;s statement. &quot;The League and TFT teams will update you soon on what this means for each game.&quot;

                              <span>Portable power!
The most popular current-generation console is a handheld. Computer companies with limited experience in the console market are jumping in with handhelds of their own. There&#x27;s no denying it: portable gaming is in the midst of a renaissance. But as companies continue to release handheld consoles, and as consumers continue to buy them, I&#x27;m struck by an interesting question: what was the last mainstream handheld game?
I&#x27;m not talking about a game that you can play on a handheld. At this point, you can play basically any game ever made on a handheld. I&#x27;m talking about a game built for handhelds, one that benefits from a smaller form factor, lower processing power, and increased portability. Handheld consoles are about as big as they&#x27;ve ever been... so where are all the handheld…</span>

As a lifelong fan of Final Fantasy, the series has gotten a bad rap this past decade.
Between Final Fantasy XV&#x27;s tumultuous development cycle, Final Fantasy XIV’s abysmal state at launch, and Final Fantasy XIII’s… well, existence, fan opinion of the brand has soured. This makes it hard to remember that, once upon a time, Final Fantasy was one of the most beloved names in gaming. It set the standard for JRPGs across multiple consoles with cutting edge aesthetics and gameplay systems that became industry standards. That&#x27;s not to say every recent Final Fantasy is bad, but it&#x27;s important that the heights of the franchise are not forgotten. This is a series whose legacy will endure forever, no matter how many stupid NFTs Square Enix tries to sell.

Supermassive Games has announced that its upcoming VR ghost train The Dark Pictures: Switchback VR will no longer meet its previously announced February 22 release date — The spooky-ooky title will now be jump scaring onto the PSVR2 platform on March 16.
&quot;It has always been our aim to release in the launch window of the new PlayStation VR2 headset but it is also massively important to us that you, the players, receive the most polished, terrifying experience possible when you strap in for your first ride in The Dark Pictures: Switchback VR,&quot; writes Supermassive Games in a press statement.
&quot;With this in mind, we have made the difficult decision to set a new launch date of March 16, 2023.&quot;

Described as Supermassive&#x27;s &quot;most ambitious virtual reality project to date&quot;, Switchback VR will plunge players into an immersive, atmospheric, and super-scary 3D world, as they ride a literal rollercoaster through five distinct regions, inspired by the stories of the studio&#x27;s horror anthology series, The Dark Pictures. So be prepared to visit the ghouls, witches, and demons of Man of Medan, Little Hope, House of Ashes, and the most recent entry, The Devil in Me.
The Dark Pictures: Switchback VR will launch on March 16. The PSVR2 hardware launches worldwide on February 22, priced at a somewhat princely $550 USD. Who says you can&#x27;t put a price on terror?

                              <span>It&#x27;s a small world after all...
Publisher Microids, in association with Parisian indie studio Tower Five, has released the first screenshots for the intriguing-looking insect adventure Empire of the Ants, which is currently in development for PC and console platforms, with a tentative 2024 release window.
Based on Bernard Werber&#x27;s 1991 sci-fi novel Les Fourmis, (&quot;The Ants&quot;), Empire of the Ants will see layers don the form of a soldier ant, charged with leading its lost colony to safer, finer pastures. Utilizing the power of Unreal 5, Tower Five is attempting to construct a photo-realistic macro world — one that will hopefully encompass the dangers and struggles that face our hard-working friends on a day-to-day basis.

As the self-appointed colony head, the player must guide the ants over and across a variety of different environments, battling various predators and threats, as well as surviving the powerful, all-consuming seasons. Keep your &quot;people&quot; alive, fend off aggressors, and find a new home in which to thrive.
These first screenshots depict the protagonist as they confront ladybirds, scour for sustenance, and face down rival colonies. Even at this early stage, it looks pretty fascinating, and brings to mind the unique, small-world joys of 2009 Wii release Deadly Creatures. 

And even without a windswept Joan Collins screaming and swinging around a boat oar, or a small, midwestern town populated by pheromone-controlled rednecks on patrol, Tower Five&#x27;s creepy-crawly title has definitely made its way onto my radar.
Empire of the Ants is currently in development for PC and consoles. It is scheduled to launch in 2024.

Handheld strategy classic Yggdra Union is heading to a new platform. Sting confirms today that it&#x27;s bringing the strategy RPG to PC via Steam on February 6, 2023.
Originally released for the Game Boy Advance in 2006, Yggdra Union is a top-down, turn-based strategy game that has you mixing and combining formations called unions to take down your enemy. While it received a PlayStation Portable port a couple years after the  GBA version, North America still hasn&#x27;t received its mobile or Switch port from more recent years.
With the Steam version, Sting will have full English support for the interface, audio, and subtitles. Sting notes the title is heading into Early Access, where it will be for about three to five months, as the team fixes bugs and adjusts…</span>

The second episode of The Last of Us television series is here, and regardless of what any given viewer thinks of the show, no one can deny that the creators are taking risks. While the premiere episode laid out a solid introduction to the series, it still left a lot of fans wondering what direction the story might take in the coming weeks. But this week&#x27;s episode, &quot;Infected,&quot; set a whole new tone, for better or for worse. Whether or not you liked it, there&#x27;s no denying that this second chapter laid it all out there and made some bold choices. It&#x27;s up to us to discuss and decide if the changes were worth it. Let&#x27;s break down the episode, and get into it.

                              <span>Gentlemen, start your graphics cards...
Today sees the launch of Square Enix&#x27; spellbound epic Forspoken, which is available to purchase now on PS5 and PC platforms — In addition, a new blog post by developer Luminous Productions has announced that a PC demo will launch later today on Steam, Epic Games Store, and Microsoft Store.
The Forspoken demo will give PC users the opportunity to check out Forspoken&#x27;s effect-laden magic adventure for themselves, allowing those on the fence from a technical standpoint to see whether their rig matches up to the game&#x27;s meaty visuals. Having played the title on PS5, I initially struggled to see why the PC specifications seemed so lofty. Upon reaching several of the game&#x27;s boss encounters, (particularly the impressive &quot;Tanta&quot; battles), it became quite clear that Forspoken would be pretty greedy on the ol&#x27; GFX. I don&#x27;t think my Radeon x700 is going to get the job done.

Forspoken follows the story of Frey Holland, a troubled street kid who finds herself plucked from the streets of Hell&#x27;s Kitchen and deposited in Athia, a fantasy world under siege from a smothering corruption known as &quot;The Break&quot;. Bound with a sentient vanbrace dubbed &quot;Cuff&quot;. This original odd cuffle ventures through Athia&#x27;s huge open world, hoping to challenge its founders, restore the land, and get our girl back home to her beloved moggie, Homer.
Forspoken launches today on PS5 and PC. You can check out our review for the new title right here.

A veteran software engineer at developer Activision Blizzard has quit his role at the studio after reportedly being unable to reconcile with what he calls a &quot;toxic&quot; stack-ranking staff appraisal system.
According to a report by Bloomberg, Brian Birmingham, who has worked with Blizzard Entertainment on titles such as World of Warcraft, Hearthstone, and Warcraft III: Reforged, departed the company after 17 years of service when faced with the appraisal system, which he says grades teams on a curve, and thus forces the manager to &quot;downgrade&quot; certain employees for little reason other than to maintain said curve.
Birmingham claims that he was asked to change a team member&#x27;s status from &quot;Successful&quot; to &quot;Developing&quot;, an act which Birmingham says what done to …</span>

                              <span>The fan-favorite mode makes a return
Infinity Ward tried some new things with the release of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II — some of them stuck like semtex, and some of them didn&#x27;t. One change that many players are excited to see reverted is the game&#x27;s Hardcore mode, or more specifically, its return to the game with MWII&#x27;s Season 2. The news came via the official Infinity Ward Twitter account, where they announced the return of the mode that makes an already-difficult game even harder. In addition, the studio stated that more updates on what to expect from Season 2 will be coming later this week on their blog.
Hardcore mode isn&#x27;t for the faint of heart, as it gives players significantly less health, reduces the HUD down to a minimum, and turns friendly fire on. As usual, players will be able to access Hardcore mode through a specific playlist, so don&#x27;t worry about getting roped into these games by accident — although I wouldn&#x27;t put it past anyone considering how unnecessarily confusing Modern Warfare II&#x27;s UI is. The mode dates all the way back to the original Modern Warfare in 2007, so I don&#x27;t really understand why they didn&#x27;t include it from launch to begin with. Oh well, something to look forward to I guess.
https://twitter.com/InfinityWard/status/1617220677517381632
Season 2 has already been delayed two weeks to February 15, as was correctly predicted by known Call of Duty data miner CODSploitz. In addition to Hardcore mode, the update will include the return of Resurgence mode, as well as &quot;a brand new small map&quot; and &quot;new multiplayer maps, new modes, weapons and much more.&quot;

                              <span>The next Fortnite collab drops just in time for the Dead Space Remake
As one of the most popular games in the world, Fortnite is known for a whole host of different things, but its most famous feature is probably its huge variety of crossover events. They&#x27;ve teamed up with everyone from Star Wars to Ariana Grande, and now Fortnite is back with their Gaming Legends Series to collaborate with yet another iconic video game protagonist: Isaac Clarke of Dead Space fame. Clarke serves as the player character of all three Dead Space games, and is described as a &quot;ship system specialist and necromorph slayer&quot; by Fortnite&#x27;s blog post. Yeah, that sounds about right to me.
Clarke is coming to Fortnite in the new Strange Transmissions Quest Pack, which will be available in the Item Shop for $11.99. The pack will include the Isaac Clarke Outfit, the RIG Back Blind, the Plasma Cutter Pickaxe (which comes with a built-in Bench Upgrade Emote), and the Strange Transmissions Quests that can earn you up to 1,500 V-Bucks.
https://twitter.com/FortniteGame/status/1617673934349942785
This Fortnite x Dead Space collaboration lands only four days before the long-awaited Dead Space Remake, which is officially out on Friday January 27, 2023. Now fans will be able to get extra hyped-up by taking on the new Strange Transmissions quests, and I expect we&#x27;ll be seeing a ton of Isaac Clarke&#x27;s flying around Battle Royale Island soon enough.

I love Bob Ross. I mean, everybody loves Bob Ross, but I like to consider myself something of a superfan — I&#x27;ve seen every episode of The Joy of Painting, many of them multiple times, I have a collection of Bob Ross memorabilia (including a figurine that is currently on my desk), and I even dressed up as him to attend one of my sorority events when I was in college, including a curly-haired wig and fake beard. Bob Ross is a national treasure who embodies the kind of gentle, loving demeanor toward others and ourselves that I&#x27;m constantly striving to display on a deeper level, and now, I can do so in Morrowind of all places, thanks to this new mod inspired by The Joy of Painting.

                              <span>The whole Strange series will be on the Switch
The tale of two brothers is making its way to Nintendo&#x27;s hybrid console. Life is Strange 2 is coming to Nintendo Switch on February 2, 2023.
Confirmed today, the second numbered game in the Life is Strange series is currently up for pre-order on the Nintendo eShop.
The story of Life is Strange 2 jumps away from Arcadia Bay and into the lives of Sean Diaz and his brother Daniel. After Daniel discovers some secret telekinetic abilities in a dramatic incident, the brothers leave home and go on the road. It&#x27;s an emotional story about family, as the brothers try to make their way to the border and into Mexico.

Two wolves
The arrival of Life is Strange 2 also ensures that the entire series is now on the Nintendo Switch. The Life is Strange: Remastered Collection, which has both the first game and its prequel Before the Storm, arrived last year. And its third entry, Life is Strange: True Colors, hit the Switch in late 2021.
With the entire Life is Strange suite playable on Nintendo Switch, that means the supernatural adventures of all these wayward souls are portable and playable on the Switch platform. It&#x27;s nice to see too, as Life is Strange 2 can feel a little overlooked compared to the other entries in the series.
While it&#x27;s from the era of episodic narrative games, it looks like Life is Strange 2 includes all the episodes of the second game as well, in one package. So if this is one that you missed, or maybe you hopped on with True Colors and want to see what else the series has in store, there&#x27;s another option for experiencing the Diaz brothers&#x27; story.
Life is Strange 2 hits Nintendo Switch on February 2, 2023.

This model is well-equipped too, with a 12th-gen Core i7 12650H processor, 16GB of DDR5 RAM, a 1TB NVMe SSD and a 15-in 144Hz display.

I&#x27;m justifying this spurious comparison because the games we picked as our favourites of 2022 have proven a strong indicator of what you&#x27;ll find on this year&#x27;s list of IGF finalists. Among the selectees are Tunic, Betrayal At Club Low, Norco, Neon White and The Case Of The Golden Idol.

                              <span>While we spend a lot of our time over here in the deals corner of RPS covering high-speed NVMe SSDs, I also try to keep an eye out for good deals on classic 2.5-inch SATA SSDs as well. These drives are physically larger, slower and not much better value than NVMe M.2 alternatives, but occasionally prices become so low that you have to take notice. 
Today&#x27;s example is this 480GB Kingston A400 SSD, which has been reduced to under £25 versus an original RRP of £63. That&#x27;s an astonishing amount of space for the money, and well worth picking up if you have an old machine still running on a HDD.

As a kid, we would refer to it simply as “The Banana Game”. I had to rely on my Dad to play it, as only he was able to access an unfathomable portal called “DOS”, summoning it out of the inky void using long strings of seemingly random letters; an incantation that gave it a sort of mystical allure.

Players began efforts to alert Rockstar to the issues en masse over the weekend, after some nefarious types took advantage of the issues to disrupt the game for other people. Rockstar Support have tweeted that a security-related update is coming, but didn&#x27;t give a specific timeframe for it yet.

                              <span>Back in the days of 1987, fantasy point-and-click adventure Shadowgate was notoriously deadly. The type of thing that fell very much into the &#x27;touch anything and you&#x27;re dead&#x27; bracket of early adventure games. Getting eaten by sharks, burned to death by a dragon, and the awkward fate of being dragged into space through a shattered mirror were just some of the ways you could cop it on the black and white Apple Macintosh original. Heck, if you lost your torch while exploring, you&#x27;d also fall and break your neck within minutes. Happy days! No doubt, then, that you&#x27;ll be pleased to hear that the original creators are now making a Shadowgate sequel for PC, more than 35 years after its initial release. Beyond Shadowgate is launching a Kickstarter campaign on February 18th, and promises lots more ridiculous ways to pop your clogs.

                              <span>Over the past couple of days, Book Twitter (and actually regular Twitter, because it&#x27;s such a catastrophically mockable opinion to have in public) have been making much fun of this dude, who essentially pitched that AI could disrupt books. Another guy enthusiastically replied that you could add Metaverse features so you could &quot;live the book&quot;. Don&#x27;t bother adding to the pile on, because there are no more jokes to make. They have been deluged by people pointing out that TV, films and video games all aready exist.
This made me think about, firstly, that we&#x27;d be much better off as a society if techbro web3 enthusiasts were all siloed into one giant Truman Show-esque hamster ball where they can all scurry about together thinking they&#x27;re achieving things. But secondly, that some people really put a lot of store on interactivity. Including me! Graham was the one who sent me those tweets, and he said he wouldn&#x27;t want to live in any of the books he&#x27;s been reading, because everyone in them is sad or angry for the whole book, until almost the end. I said I wouldn&#x27;t want to be in them because you&#x27;d only end up being a side character, and that&#x27;s boring.

                              <span>There’s a new Nvidia GeForce Game Ready Driver out, and for once it sounds pretty interesting – especially if you’re lucky/rich/unhinged enough to have dropped megabucks on one of Nvidia’s megabucks RTX 40 series GPUs.


The 528.24 WHQL driver is mainly aimed at tuning up GeForce graphics cards for imminent PC releases Forspoken, the Dead Space remake, and Deliver Us Mars. All three will include DLSS support, which might come in handy for Forspoken in particular, given its slightly bananas system requirements. But 528.24 will also get Hitman 3 and Marvel’s Midnight Suns ready for DLSS 3 upgrades, with both games set to gain support for the overhauled upscaler in forthcoming patches.

                              <span>Most deckbuilding strategy games see you create a single deck of cards over the course of the game. With every completed stage, you&#x27;re given the chance to add in new cards and take out old duffers, carefully honing those rough edges until it&#x27;s your very own death by paper cut machine. Mahokenshi isn&#x27;t most other deckbuilders, though. Here, you&#x27;re tasked with creating a fresh deck of cards each time you start a new mission, bolstering your initial crop of starter attacks and movement cards with new, more powerful attacks on the fly as you move around its hex-based landscapes. Some can be found out in the wild, but most of them you&#x27;ll be buying from village merchants, before upgrading them at dojos dotted around the map. And at the end the mission, they&#x27;re all swept away. 
It&#x27;s certainly a refreshing take on deckbuilding, and it lends itself to even more spontaneous wins and comebacks than the usual frisson of tension you get from simply drawing a good or bad hand. But with main story missions quickly ramping up in difficulty, that scramble for bigger and better cards up front is often Mahokenshi&#x27;s undoing. The whims of chance are felt more keenly than ever in Game Source Studio&#x27;s debut deckbuilder, and they never quite felt like they&#x27;re tipped in your favour.

                              <span>Mimimi Games have been teasing their next stealth strategy game for over two years now, and finally, we know what it is. Today, the makers of Desperados 3 and Shadow Tactics: Blades Of The Shogun revealed that the game formerly known as Codename: Sweet Potato (or Süßkartoffel, in their native German) is now called Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew, and it&#x27;s all about undead magical pirates. Sign me the heck up.
I got to see Shadow Gambit in action late last week, and boy howdy it looks super cool. Even better, it&#x27;s coming to Steam and the Epic Games Store later this year. Read on below to watch its pair of exciting reveal trailers, and find out all about it.

                              <span>After almost 14 years, I am still delighted by Windosill. It&#x27;s still a joy to poke and prod at the wee indie puzzle game, tugging on orbs, spinning carousels, and jabbing at the many beaks and eyeballs and mouths and noises emerging from an ever-shifting box. It&#x27;s such a reward for curiosity. And it still looks great too, with that unaging smooth vector art from developer Vectorpark. Now it&#x27;s out on Android phones and tablets too. I bought it, and really enjoy how much a touchscreen adds to the tactile experience.

Microsoft will be pumping the money into futuristic tech firm OpenAI, which operates Turing-botherer chatbot ChatGPT and its artistic relative DALL-E. OpenAI’s already received two investments from Microsoft, one in 2019 and another in 2021. This third investment is intended to be “multi-year” and “multibillion dollar”, allowing both companies to “independently commercialize” whatever budding Skynets emerge.

                              <span>Even before the monsters arrived, the USG Ishimura was a nightmare. 


I mean, yes, the hulking spaceship where Dead Space takes place isn’t exactly a floating Hilton once its crew have been turned inside out by a bunch of drooling flesh moths, but there is ample evidence that the Ishimura was a miserable place to live and work long before that happened. This is why the planet cracker class vessel is still remembered as fondly as other iconic spaces such as City 17, Rapture and the Spencer Mansion. Despite its fantastical contexts, the Ishimura is a believable location, one where the work itself is deemed more important than the workers who do it.

                              <span>You may have already heard that several outlets haven&#x27;t had review code for Forspoken, Squeenix&#x27;s magical parkour isekai game that&#x27;s out today and that some people have already decided they hate because of the dialogue. I was actually pretty excited to review the game, and was hopeful that the dialogue would make sense and work in context. But unfortunately we, too, are one of the outlets who don&#x27;t have code, so no PC review from us for a while.
Like many others - and you too, if you&#x27;ve got a PS5 - I&#x27;ve been able to play the free Forspoken demo, which plops you into the game after the opening bumf, and presumably the cutscene where Frey establishes her modern girl &quot;lemme get this straight?!&quot; credentials. And you know what? I don&#x27;t hate it!

Ten years ago today, mythological MOBA SMITE came out in open beta on PC. To celebrate its tenth year on the MOBA circuit, the freemium game is teaming up with card battler Magic: The Gathering to create an event unlike any other.
The crossover will last for three months, and includes a new Conquest mode with a fresh new map, five new skins inspired by M:TG which cost 1,200 gems each, and a further five skins in the next update.

Initially announced for Switch in 2020 and aiming at a release in 2021, The Lord of the Rings: Gollum is a Daedelic Entertainment-developed stealth-parkour game starring the titular weird gremlin on a quest to chase the One Ring. Unfortunately, it was delayed until 2022, then the Switch version alone was pushed back further as the other versions were slated for September 1st 2022, then all versions were delayed &quot;by a few months&quot; back in July 2022, but without a definitive release date.

When it comes to sprucing up your retro consoles with a mod-con or two, there is no shortage of options. From new shells to upscalers and converters, RGB mods to devices that emulate OG disc drives, old video game systems are being upgraded and refurbished like vintage cars these days, giving them a new lease on life and keeping our treasured childhood systems alive and well some 20, 30, even 40 years after they were first designed and released. Integrating old consoles into modern living room ecosystems can be a challenge, though, and that&#x27;s where little devices like BlueRetro&#x27;s N64 Adapter come in handy.

If you&#x27;ve finished Return to Monkey Island and are simply itching to dive into another point-and-click adventure, then good news, because Tall Story Games&#x27; Lucy Dreaming will be launching on Switch on February 28th, 2023.
Described as a mix of Monkey Island, Monty Python, and Blackadder, the game - which originally launched in October 2022 on Steam and mobile - stars Lucy, who finds herself in the &quot;very British&quot; town of Figgington amidst a decade-long mystery. With visuals that resemble the rather excellent Thimbleweed Park and voice talent including Dominic Armato (Guybrush Threepwood) himself, it definitely looks like one to keep a close eye on.

After last week&#x27;s leaks, we now finally have an official look at the Jakks Pacific line of toys for The Super Mario Bros. Movie. While we previously got a close-up peek at a fire-breathing Bowser (leaked, of course) today&#x27;s reveal is all about the good guys and we have to admit, they are all a little creepy.
The official reveal from IGN shows new figures of Mario, Luigi, Peach and Toad, each of which comes with an additional accessory for some character-specific poses. We can&#x27;t say if it&#x27;s just the lighting or our own paranoia, but those plastic eyes seem to be staring into our very soul. Check out the following new photo from @IGN and you might just see what we mean...

The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is probably one of the most popular games for speedrunning. One of the many well-known tricks in the game is that Ruto, the Zora princess you need to rescue from inside Lord Jabu-Jabu&#x27;s belly, has a hitbox if you throw her. As you can imagine, this can be used for many different things all the time you have her. But you don&#x27;t have her for very long — unless, of course, you hack her in.
That&#x27;s exactly what Vidya James, a member of Zeldathon, Randomizer runner, and occasional speedrunner, has done. James wanted to know if you could use the Zora princess to defeat Ganon at the end of the game just by throwing her at him. So he hacked her into the practice ROM of the game. The results, as you might expect, are pretty hilarious. You can watch the results above. Who needs the Master Sword when you can just, y&#x27;know, chuck a Zora at someone?

It&#x27;s an easy business to sit and discuss the failures of the Wii U — lacking purpose, chunky design, confusing name — but what about its successes? It&#x27;s a much shorter list, we&#x27;ll admit, but one of the things that many of us will agree on is its stellar games library (we mean, just look at how many have made the jump over to Switch).
With the console turning ten at the end of last year, we are now in the period of decade-old Wii U announcements popping back into our heads at a moment&#x27;s notice. Once such anniversary took place yesterday as we noticed on Twitter (thanks to @NintenDaan) that a whopping ten years have passed since the console&#x27;s &#x27;Nintendo Games&#x27; Direct presentation aired.

                              <span>A game with layers?
If you’ve played Bertil Hörberg’s Gunman Clive and its direct sequel on 3DS, Wii U, or Switch, then the developer’s latest effort, Onion Assault, will look immediately familiar to you. But while the former two titles were undoubtedly inspired by the Mega Man franchise, Onion Assault instead feels like an homage to Nintendo’s own Super Mario Bros. 2 (originally Yume Kōjō: Doki Doki Panic, of course). It’s a well-made game that shines in all the right places, but it also proves to be an occasionally frustrating experience and, sadly, one that probably won’t be quite as memorable as the developer’s previous efforts.
Onion Assault stars two playable main characters: Pelle Lok, a topless brute of a man, and his mother, Mama Lok, who wears an apron and a pair of oven mitts that double for boxing gloves. Both characters sport a similar stocky stature as those in Gunman Clive, along with the same bushy eyebrows that Mechstermination Force&#x27;s main character boasted. There’s no difference in how the Loks control, so your choice here is purely based on which one appeals to you aesthetically.

QUbyte&#x27;s Breakers Collection, a rerelease of two of Visco&#x27;s Breaker games, is getting an update on 26th January on all platforms, Switch included.
The first update for the game brings with it the usual quality-of-life tweaks and updates, including an armful of little bug fixes. But Qubyte Interactive also took the time to announce an upcoming in-game event.

As we all know by now (we hope), the 3DS and Wii U eShops will unfortunately be shutting down on March 27th, 2023.
This of course means that in just a couple of months time, you&#x27;ll no longer be able to purchase or download new games onto your 3DS or Wii U. Until that time, if your Nintendo Account is shared across your Switch, 3DS, and Wii U, you can still add funds up until the closure date, so be sure to mop up any remaining purchases while you still have time.

The newest character skin to be introduced into Fortnite has been revealed to be Isaac Clarke, the protagonist of the classic horror/sci-fi series Dead Space. Now we can live out our dream Dead Space/Alien crossover by playing as Isaac and Ellen Ripley!
This is probably one of the more normal crossovers we&#x27;ve seen in a while — think Goku, Naruto, etc. and Isaac seems perfectly expected for Fortnite. Plus, the highly anticipated Dead Space remake launches on PS5 and Xbox on 27th January, so the timing is pretty darn perfect.

You&#x27;ll cut out chunks of other characters to get through each task which can include balancing a pencil on your head, dunking a basketball into the goal, and making arrows or other shapes.

                              <span>Last week, The Last of Us&#x27; premiere scored HBO&#x27;s second largest debut for an original series since 2010. And now, Episode 2 of The Last of Us, &quot;Infected,&quot; has broken another HBO record.
&quot;Infected&quot; brought in 5.7 million viewers across HBO and HBO Max streams, marking a 22% increase over last week&#x27;s 4.7-million premiere. That increase is the largest audience increase from a first episode to a second episode for an original drama series on HBO in the network&#x27;s history, as first reported by Variety. HBO calls it the &quot;largest week 2 audience growth for an HBO Original drama series in the history of the network,&quot; which speaks further to the wide success of The Last of Us. 
Weirdly enough, even though HBO is usually quick to capitalize on series success with an announcement of a second or sequel season, it has not yet done that for The Last of Us, although every sign points to a greenlight for a Season 2. 
Episode 1 of The Last of Us crossed 10 million viewers after just two days last week and now, Variety reports that it is tracking 18 million, which is nearly four times its premiere night audience. 
While waiting for this week&#x27;s episode, read our interview with game co-creator Neil Druckmann and Joel actor Pedro Pascal about how The Last of Us was changed for TV, and then read about how there are no plans for The Last of Us show to go beyond the games.

                              <span>EA Motive&#x27;s remake of Dead Space is out later this week, but if you need your fix of Isaac Clarke now, you can purchase the Strange Transmissions Quest Pack in Fortnite today. 
Isaac Clarke joins Fortnite&#x27;s Gaming Legends Series and he can join your locker roster via the new quest pack for $11.99. Strange Transmissions is available now in the Fortnite Item Shop and it allows you to collect the Issac Clarke Outfit and earn up to 1500 V-Bucks, which is essentially how much the pack costs (if you convert V-Bucks into real-world dollars). The pack also includes the RIG Back Bling, the USG Ishimura Back Bling, the Plasma Cutter Pickaxe, and the Bench Upgrade Emote, which is built-in to the Plasma Cutter Pickaxe. 
For more Isaac Clarke, watch this extended Dead Space gameplay walkthrough that runs down the remake&#x27;s new features and then watch this new story trailer for Dead Space ahead of the game&#x27;s release this Friday. Check out Game Informer&#x27;s big list of upcoming video game remakes after that.

Revealed yesterday during a Thunderful stream, SteamWorld Build is a new city-builder set in the SteamWorld universe due out sometime this year on consoles and PC. In it, your goal is to escape a dying planet and the only way to do this is by building a mining town to dig up &quot;vital long-lost technology.&quot; You&#x27;ll need to manage your city as the needs of it, and the citizens living there, grow, and you&#x27;ll have to defend your creation from the deadly creatures that lurk below. 
Check out the SteamWorld Build announcement trailer below:

No. So here&#x27;s a chance to fix that: Below Zero is currently 58% off in Steam&#x27;s Base Builder Fest.

Well, now it&#x27;s Quordle&#x27;s turn to be bought, as it&#x27;s been picked up by Merriam-Webster.

                              <span>Since about 2015, there&#x27;s been an Acer monitor of one kind or another on my desk. The Taiwanese company is probably better known for its desktop PCs - or its former StarCraft II team! - but they&#x27;re also a solid choice when it comes to high performance, relatively good value monitors - without the RGB and heavy branding of competitors like Asus or MSI. 
In any case, one of Acer&#x27;s most popular models, the Nitro XF243Y Pbmiiprx, is down to £120 at Amazon. That&#x27;s a great price for a 24-in 1080p 165Hz monitor that has attracted strongly positive reviews.

                              <span>After four years away, SteamWorld is back. If you haven&#x27;t seen the news yet, Thunderful unveiled SteamWorld Build earlier this evening, the next entry in their genre-hopping series of games about colourful robot pals trying to make their way in the world. As the name implies, this one&#x27;s a citybuilder, and I&#x27;ve been hands on with an early build of, err, Build, to tell you all about it. No, I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s going on with the previously announced Headhunter right now either, but in some ways, I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s Build that&#x27;s coming out first. 
After all, it&#x27;s been a hot minute since the last SteamWorld game came out, and Build is shaping up to be the perfect reintroduction to what made this series so special. It goes right back to its roots, reframing that classic SteamWorld Dig story of mining for gold and treasure with a new, management-style eye for town-planning, while also paying homage to where it all began for these jolly old rustbuckets way, way back on the Nintendo DSi. That&#x27;s right. SteamWorld Build may be a citybuilder on the surface, but down below it&#x27;s a mining and tower defence &#x27;em up - and having lost several hours to my demo build already, it&#x27;s really something special.

                              <span>Thunderful have just unveiled the next game in their excellent SteamWorld series, and it&#x27;s not the one we thought it was going to be. Third person action co-op adventure SteamWorld Headhunter was initially teased in November 2021, but Thunderful used their SteamWorld Telegraph: Special Broadcast this evening to talk about a very different kind of new SteamWorld game - and it looks rad as heck. It&#x27;s a citybuilder, and (appropriately) it&#x27;s called SteamWorld Build. I&#x27;ve played a bit of it already, and you can read more of my thoughts about it right here. Spoiler alert: it&#x27;s a little bit good. If you just want the facts of what was announced, though, read on below.

                              <span>More than 20 years after The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind arrived on PC, one mod has finally given us the option to ignore all the questing and just enjoy capturing the game’s fantastical scenery on canvas. With the Joy Of Painting mod, you can set up your field easel anywhere in Morrowind, daub some brush strokes on a canvas, and even flog the painting to earn a bit of cash.

So rather than go into detail here about the original game itself (although if you want to hear more about it, I&#x27;ve got something pretty cool in the pipeline for you, so watch this space!), I&#x27;ve decided to use this HYP to talk about the brilliant TV adverts that first brought it to my attention.

This lovely little free indie game has you zooming through minigames to prepare a dinner for a Vietnamese Lunar New Year party before all your guests arrive. Chop this, fry those, and don&#x27;t forget to wash your hands! Designed and hand-drawn by Swiss-Vietnamese illustrator Charlotte Broccard, it&#x27;s a lovely five minutes of fun.

Over the weekend, devs Infinity Ward tweeted about Hardcore mode’s imminent comeback in the forthcoming update. Hardcore mode chucks out the game’s HUD, turns on friendly fire, and reduces health to make matches quicker and a little more unpredictable. There&#x27;ll also be some changes to Warzone 2’s DMZ, such as new missions and difficulty tuning.

                              <span>It’s not even out yet, but we already know that the Dead Space remake launching on January 27th will have an alternate ending. A list of the game’s achievements published on True Trophies includes one that hints at another way to see out the revised adventures of Isaac Clarke, instead of just landing the bog-standard ending. Thankfully, there’s not much more info beyond its existence, so at least the extra ending isn’t ruined and you’ll be able to find out what it means for yourself.

                              <span>Grand Theft Auto Online players on PC are reporting corrupted accounts and being locked out of their games due to remote code exploits that are being abused by modders. Rockstar-focused Twitter account Tez2 highlighted the issue at the end of last week, before news of the situation spread onto the GTA Online subreddit. Rockstar Support hasn’t officially acknowledged any potential the exploits have to affect GTA Online players and their accounts, although Tez2 claimed that the company were already aware of what was going on.

                              <span>It starts...
My husband was determined that I take on The Lion King. It had to be the Sega Genesis version. I feel like this is almost a shared experience. I played it in my youth, and it didn’t really leave any sort of bad impression. The sprites and backgrounds were done by Disney’s animation studio, and the whole thing looks like a big-budget endeavor. It’s hard to believe how relentlessly awful it actually is.
During my last experience with it, I finally accomplished a childhood dream of making it to the part of the game where you play as adult Simba. I remember concluding that it wasn’t worth it and walking away. Surely, this is the time I’ll finally beat it.
No. It broke me. It broke my spirit.

                              <span>A demo is also out right now
The SteamWorld team is setting its sights on the big city. SteamWorld Build is the newest game set in the SteamWorld setting, arriving in 2023 for PC and consoles.
Announced during today&#x27;s SteamWorld Telegraph, SteamWorld Build is a city builder set in the same universe that&#x27;s tied together all of Thunderful&#x27;s steam-powered games.
The new city builder will see you become the architect of your own mining town, excavating the ground beneath and building a town up top. The overall goal is to dig deeper, unearth the goodies, and ultimately escape the planet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;Fd_ZTJtAW88
It looks similar to games like Dungeon Keeper or Dwarf Fortress, where you&#x27;re balancing building a world and digging deeper with the impending dangers surrounding you. There are caves to explore, five different SteamWorld-inspired maps with secrets, and it will be controllable with either controller or mouse and keyboard.
If you want to try it out for yourself, you can do so right now too. A demo for SteamWorld Build is live right now as part of the Steam Base Builder Fest, running Jan. 23 through Jan. 30, so you can give this game a shot.
The wide, wide world of Steam
Even if city builders aren&#x27;t your style, there&#x27;s more SteamWorld games on the way too. While the team wouldn&#x27;t go into specifics, Thunderful&#x27;s Brjann Sigurgeirsson confirms there are four SteamWorld games currently in development. The team didn&#x27;t discuss what those games were, but hey, that&#x27;s a lot of SteamWorld.
As for SteamWorld Build, no firm date has been set yet but it is planned for both PC and console sometime this year. With a demo already available, I&#x27;m personally hoping that&#x27;s sooner rather than later, as I could go for a good city builder with the wonderful theming that SteamWorld frequently gets right.

                              <span>Three episodes in, the team is postponing further releases
The NieR: Automata anime is three episodes in, but the rollout is coming to a halt. More episodes of NieR: Automata Ver1.1a have been postponed until further notice.
In a statement on social media from the adaptation&#x27;s official account, the delay is attributed to COVID-related issues.
&quot;Due to the impact of COVID-19 on production, we have decided to postpone the broadcast and distribution of episode 4 and all subsequent episodes,&quot; reads the statement. &quot;Information regarding the broadcast and distribution schedule for episode 4 and beyond will be announced on the official anime website and official Twitter soon.&quot;
https://twitter.com/NieRA_anime_EN/status/1616843160000385024
No further details were given on how COVID has impacted production. As noted, there also isn&#x27;t an expected date for the series&#x27; return just yet. Three episodes of NieR: Automata Ver1.1a are already available on streaming sites.
For the glory of mankind
The NieR: Automata anime adaptation looks to follow the events of 2017&#x27;s fantastic game, though with a few twists of its own in store. Yoko Taro has said that the Ver1.1a is affixed specifically because things are being changed around.
While NieR is certainly a series with many mysteries and lore, it looks like fans will have to wait a while longer to see the rest of what&#x27;s in store. Though no return date is locked in, hopefully the COVID-related issues resolve quickly and without any impact on those making this series happen.
In the meantime, you can always take a walk down memory lane and revisit NieR: Automata. The mod that made the infamous church mystery happen might be something fun to mess around with, to keep that inner lore detective happy until more NieR anime is ready to air. Or maybe catch up on our chat with the leads behind NieR: Automata that we conducted last year, to coincide with the release of NieR: Automata on Switch.

Naughty Dog&#x27;s PS5 remake The Last of Us Part I has skyrocketed back up the UK Charts following the premiere of its HBO live-action counterpart. The remake, which launched in September 2022, found itself sitting at the number 20 spot in the physical retail charts after sales spiked a wild 238% in just one week.
The HBO adaptation of The Last of Us premiered on the channel to record audiences, pulling in an estimated 4.7 million viewers for its first episode. The series, which stars Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey, recounts the original game&#x27;s story of a world-weary man and a young girl thrust together in a journey across a dilapidated United States, its places and people torn apart by a terrifying mass fungal infection.
Elsewhere in the UK Charts, Nintendo&#x27;s shiny new RPG Fire Emblem Engage debuted at No.1, making it the first new number one of 2023. Fire Emblem Engage displaced Electronic Arts&#x27; football sim FIFA 23, which has sat comfortably in the top spot for almost a month now. The remainder of the Top 10 is dominated by Nintendo Switch releases, including Animal Crossing: New Horizons, Nintendo Switch Sports, Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet, and, of course, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe.

I Was a Teenage Exocolonist is one of those games that I kept hearing about, but it took me a minute to get around to playing it with all the amazing titles that came out last year. I know I’m a bit late to the party on this one, as the game originally came out back in August of 2022, but I’m so glad that I went back to give this one a shot. 
I went into this playthrough without knowing anything about the game and without any real expectations, and exactly one completed playthrough later, I’m absolutely in love with this title. I can’t think of any other game like it, and I can’t think of a game I’ve ever played that’s made me want to dive immediately into another playthrough right away as much as this one did.

2K Games has officially announced that the latest iteration of its WWE 2K series, WWE 2K23, will step into the squared circle once again this spring. The rocky-roaded wrestling series will be making its grand return on March 17, when it launches on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.
The publisher will release three separate editions of the title, each of which will be sporting the square-jawed visage of crossover star John Cena. This year, as grapple fans will no doubt be aware, celebrates 20 years since Cena&#x27;s initial arrival in the WWE. As such, this latest series entry will be focused on the Doctor of Thugonomics, (or is he a marine? or is he a Peacemaker?), with this year&#x27;s 2K Showcase mode dedicated to Cena&#x27;s astronomical, and incredibl…</span>

                              <span>I hope you like pins
Whenever a new first party Nintendo game creeps up, you know it&#x27;s time for a physical My Nintendo reward. Whether it&#x27;s a towel or a keychain (which it is in most cases!), something typically is dumped on the My Nintendo system for people to spend their points on. For Fire Emblem Engage, that physical reward is a pin set.
This is in addition to the current sweepstakes they&#x27;re still running.
Here&#x27;s the full description from Nintendo:
&quot;This reward contains 16 button pins with these iconic heroes from past Fire Emblem series: Emblem Marth, Emblem Celica, Emblem Sigurd, Emblem Leif, Emblem Roy, Emblem Lyn, Emblem Eirika, Emblem Ike, Emblem Micaiah, Emblem Lucina, Emblem Corrin, and Emblem Byleth. The pin set also includes new characters from Fire Emblem Engage: Veyle, Alear, and the adorable Sommie! The reward size: 8&quot;x 8&quot; and each pin size is 1.5 inches.&quot;

Pin set price points typically vary, with the WarioWare set going for 500 Platinum Points (for four larger pins), and the heavy-duty Gold and Platinum point pins going for 800. If you really want these as soon as they&#x27;re available (which is roughly a wait time of 1-2 weeks, sometimes more), aim for having around 1000 points as a buffer.
As a reminder, if you want physical rewards, you can find our full Platinum Point guide here, which has been updated with details on weekly missions: bookmark it for when you need quick points for a reward. A handful of points is incredibly easy to get, as that’s basically just 15 minutes with Super Mario Run, or a quick sign-on to the 3DS or Wii U 3Shop. Also remember that any shipments are bundled together, so you can pay a flat rate for multiple items instead of paying it each time. Just know that items go out of stock on My Nintendo frequently, and some are never restocked.

                              <span>The writer is heading for new ventures after almost two decades at BioWare
Mac Walter, a veteran of the Mass Effect series, is leaving BioWare. The longtime writer and lead on several major projects at BioWare is moving on after nearly two decades at the company.
As Walters announced on his LinkedIn page, Walters decided at the end of last year to leave BioWare. In his post, he wishes everyone at the studio well.
&quot;These past 19 years have been a life-changing experience to say the least, and it made the choice to go very difficult,&quot; wrote Walters. &quot;I’ve worked with so many wonderful people and had the privilege to be a part of the most amazing teams and projects. It’s hard to fathom it all, and I know I’ll be reflecting on it for years to come.&quot;
Walters doesn&#x27;t confirm what his next step is just yet, but did write that &quot;with a new year comes new adventures.&quot;
The massive effect
Walters joined BioWare in 2003, as a writer for the martial arts RPG Jade Empire. He&#x27;d then serve as a writer on Mass Effect before moving up to lead writer for Mass Effect 2 and 3, and then head to Anthem to be its narrative director.
He&#x27;d return to Mass Effect with Andromeda as its creative director, was project director of the Legendary Edition. His last role at BioWare was as Production Director for the upcoming Dragon Age: Dreadwolf.
The Dreadwolf has been fairly quiet since we got a subtitle reveal last year, with just a few teases to go on. And the next Mass Effect has had even less to go on. No release window has been set yet for either.
Meanwhile, this marks another departure for a longtime BioWare veteran, alongside others that have left over the last few years like Casey Hudson, Mark Darrah, and Matt Goldman.

                              <span>Iiiiiiiiiiiit&#x27;s been...
Mario Party 1 and 2 came and went late last year on the Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack service, and since then, things have been a bit...slow going. As a reader pointed out to me this past weekend, that prior dual release was on November 2, 2022: 82 days ago as of the time of publication.
There are a few games that are currently announced and will be coming out this year, but we don&#x27;t have release dates for any of them. Here&#x27;s a refresher.
Here is what&#x27;s coming to the Nintendo 64 Switch lineup in 2023:
1080 Snowboarding
Excitebike 64
Mario Party 3
Pokemon Stadium
Pokemon Stadium 2
Harvest Moon 64 (Japan-only)
So far, that&#x27;s all we know about. Naturally, more games could be announced, and in a hypothetical situation, all of these could come out before E3: with a bigger dump arriving in the middle of the year toward the end of 2023. We could even see some sort of upgrade for the Expansion Pack service as a whole, but I wouldn&#x27;t count on it.
In the meantime, this slow drip that&#x27;s very typical of Nintendo retro re-releases has now become a broken faucet. Since the original launch on October 25, 2021 (has it really been over a year since the Expansion Pack came out?), Nintendo has released 21 games in the west (and 21 games in Japan, since they don&#x27;t get Dr. Mario 64 and Pokemon Puzzle League).
Are you cool with it? Or would you like to see more? Or maybe you don&#x27;t care because you don&#x27;t even subscribe to the Switch Online Expansion Pack for this very reason!

                              <span>The Dark Pictures: Switchback VR has been delayed. 
PlayStation revealed 11 new PlayStation VR2 games back in November, including a new entry in Supermassive Games&#x27; The Dark Pictures anthology series called Switchback VR. Supermassive released Until Dawn: Rush of Blood, a PlayStation VR rail shooter, in 2016, and Switchback VR is its spiritual successor. When Switchback VR was revealed late last year, there wasn&#x27;t an official release date attached to it – PlayStation just referred to it as a PSVR2 launch window title. 
Nonetheless, Supermassive Games will release Switchback VR later than expected, as it has been delayed to March 16. It&#x27;s a short delay, given that PSVR2 launches on February 22, and any game in its launch window was likely due around then. As for why, Supermassive Games says…</span>

                              <span>Life Is Strange 2 is coming to Switch in just a couple of weeks. 
The 2019 episodic adventure game will arrive in its entirety on February 2. The five-part saga sees brothers Sean and Daniel Diaz on the run from the law after the latter’s awakened supernatural power results in the loss of a loved one. 


This news also means the entire Life Is Strange franchise will be available on Switch. 2021’s True Colors arrived a few months after its launch, and Life Is Strange: Remastered Collection, which bundles the first title and the Before the Storm prequel, hit the hybrid console last September.
In our review, former editor Joe Juba scored Life Is Strange 2 an 8.5 out of 10, writing that &quot;Life is Strange 2 has been quietly weaving a powerful and sincere narrative experience that admirably carries on the series’ legacy.&quot; What&#x27;s your favorite Life Is Strange game?

                              <span>World War Z is no stranger to having lots and lots of zombies, but a new mode launching tomorrow somehow stuffs even more undead into the experience with Horde Mode XL. Horde Mode has existed in World War Z for some time, and tasks players with holding down a single location as waves of zombies invade. Horde Mode XL is functionally the same, but now boosts the number of on-screen enemies to 1,000, which is the most the game has ever managed to showcase at one time. You can check out a short gameplay clip of the new mode above, which skips the first few waves to jump right to the final XL horde.
Horde Mode XL is coming for free to World War Z tomorrow, January 24, only on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. You can read our review of World War Z right here.</span>

Forspoken is a game about movement and running. Protagonist Frey begins the game running from the law and debt collectors. She&#x27;s also in the middle of a plan to flee New York City with a gym bag full of cash. Amidst that chaos, she falls into the land of Athia and is eager to leave the new, mysterious world where she inexplicably has superhuman combat and running abilities. Getting from one place to another is Forspoken’s high point, and while no other element quite reaches the heights of how fun running and climbing are, Frey’s adventure isn’t without its highlights.

                              <span>Despite rumors claiming otherwise, 343 Industries will continue to develop Halo games following Halo Infinite. 
Microsoft laid off 10,000 people last week amidst the company&#x27;s ongoing $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard. The same day, Halo Infinite creative director Joseph Staten, who joined the studio in 2020 to help bring the game across the finish line, revealed that he was departing 343 Industries to rejoin Xbox Publishing. Some saw this as a final blow of sorts to Halo Infinite and 343 Industries, but there&#x27;s no official indication that Halo Infinite&#x27;s course is changing following these layoffs. 
Still, rumors on the back of a report claimed that 343 Industries would no longer be developing Halo games, as other developers would do that in the future, while the studio served more as an overseer to the franchise. However, 343 Industries studio head Pierre Hintze was quick to get ahead of this rumor and posted the following on Twitter over the weekend:

It&#x27;s a short and sweet way for Hintze to say that the reporting is false, as are the rumors, and that future mainline Halo games will continue to be developed by 343 Industries, which has developed Halo 4, Halo 5: Guardians, and Halo Infinite.

                              <span>WWE 2K23 has been unveiled, and for some strange reason, 2K decided the cover art will feature a blank picture instead of a wrestler. I kid, of course. This year’s cover superstar is the 16-time World Champion and master of implied invisibility, John Cena.


As for features, so far, the biggest new addition is WarGames match type (WWE&#x27;s version). The dual-ring, double cage match can be played 3v3 or 4v4 single-player or online. 2K also teases a “unique new take” on the documentary style 2K Showcase mode, which of course, highlights Cena&#x27;s career. MyGM returns in an expanded form, MyFaction is getting online multiplayer, and the story-driven MyRise, Universe, and Creation modes are back. For the Creation Suite, custom arenas are now playable online, and entrances have more customization opt…</span>

                              <span>Since the release of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II, players have asked for a Hardcore Mode, which was notably absent from the game at launch and still today. Developer Infinity Ward has revealed that Hardcore will hit the game during its upcoming Season 2, which begins next month. 
This news comes just a few days after Infinity Ward revealed some details about this forthcoming season, including the return of Resurgence in Warzone 2.0, Ranked Play, new multiplayer modes, maps, and weapons, and more. Other changes include making the gulag in Warzone 2.0 a 1v1 fight now, instead of 2v2 like it&#x27;s been since launch, and loot from fallen enemies in Warzone 2.0 will now float on the floor, rather than remain inside a backpack. Many of these changes are welcome, but it&#x27;s clear the return of Hardcore is the most exciting update coming to Season 2. 
No HUD? No problem. Hardcore is back!
January 22, 2023
Infinity Ward&#x27;s tweet announcing the news already has more likes – nearly double – than the rest of the tweets that reveal Season 2 information. As for what Hardcore will look like in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, that remains a mystery, but if &quot;no HUD&quot; is any indication, it&#x27;ll be the classic Hardcore mode fans have come to love over multiple Call of Duty titles. For the unitiated, Hardcore mode typically includes no HUD, significantly quicker deaths, and more, making for an all-around more difficult deathmatch-type game mode. 
While waiting for Season 2 to begin next month, read Game Informer&#x27;s Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II review.

                              <span>343 Industries &quot;will continue to develop Halo now and in the future,&quot; says studio head Pierre Hintze. The statement was released in response to rumours that 343 would instead take a backseat on future Halo games by serving to manage external studios, rather than developing the games themselves as they had on Halo Infinite.

                              <span>The original Granblue Fantasy was a JRPG mobile game only released in Japan, but that didn&#x27;t stop enterprising westerners going to the effort to play it. That&#x27;s mainly because it counted Final Fantasy composer Nobuo Uematsu and art director Hideo Minaba among its developers.

Granblue Fantasy: Relink is set in the same universe and has the same Final Fantasy vets involved, but it&#x27;s a big, splashly 1-4 player action RPG blockbuster, with combat reminiscent of some Platinum Games. You&#x27;ll find the latest trailer below.

That means it won&#x27;t receive any further new content, its final balance patch will be released on March 31st, and all other support and the sale of the game will cease on September 30th. Players who already own the game at that point will be able to continue playing in single- and multiplayer, for at least a while.

The boiler is gone in my house, so I&#x27;m wearing one of those giant hoodie things that comes down to my knees, and scuttle about the place secreting foodstuffs in the pouch. Wait, that&#x27;s more like a kangaroo, isn&#x27;t it. Curses! Regardless, I will only be able to warm my hands this weekend by cupping them over the light of my PC screen. What will I, and others, be playing on them this weekend?

                              <span>With all the Sad Dad™ games that have cropped up in recent years, many have rightfully been asking: &quot;Where are all the video game mums at?&quot;. Well, what if I told you that Swedish indie studio Might and Delight have been putting mums at the centre of their games since 2013? Yup, elephant mums in Shelter 3, Lynx mums in Shelter 2, and the OG badass badger mum in Shelter 1. Sure it’s kinda terrible that the only major rep mums are getting in video games is in the form of Might and Delight’s animal tales, but I’ll honestly take any story about motherhood I can get my paws on.
As much as I love Shelter 2 (less so Shelter 3, unfortunately), Shelter 1 holds a special place in my heart, mostly because no other animal-focused survival game has come even remotely close to claiming the coveted title of &quot;most brutal animal sim that made me ugly cry.&quot;

Both are free, although there’s not a suitably intimidating cult-related name for the latter yet. Relics Of The Old Faith was shown off a bit at the end of 2022, but this is the first we’re hearing of another arriving later in this sparkly new year.

                              <span>Despite the name, Sailing Era isn&#x27;t one of the sailing sims that have popped up recently. It&#x27;s a little hard to describe, but let&#x27;s see how we get on.
You steer your wee boat around a grounded anime age-of-sail Earth, looking for shipwrecks and treasures, fighting pirates (and possibly being one, although fairly peripherally),exploring, trading, and doing the usual Elite-style open world thing. I&#x27;ll be honest: I don&#x27;t exactly love this one, and it&#x27;s spread a little thin. But I&#x27;ve played it for hours longer than I expected and enjoyed it more as it went on. It&#x27;s doing a lot, in its own slightly roundabout way.

I’ve spent this afternoon ambling around the redone GTA III, GTA: Vice City and GTA: San Andreas, in handheld form, to confirm what you probably already know: they’re all still a bit crap.

                              <span>I’m a big fan of frogs in games. If I see a cute little green lad in a game, then I’m absolutely going to play it. This is how I started playing the free prologue demo for Die In The Dungeon, a turn-based roguelike where you place dice on a grid to slice and , er, dice your foes. It’s smart, concise, and I can’t stop playing.
Playing as your little green knight, you are given five dice each round to place on a game board. Each one represents a certain action, the basic ones being attacking and defending, but ramping up to mass healing and boosting the stats of other dice. Energy points dictate how many dice you can place on the board, with each one costing the number on its face. Placement is key, as different combinations can lead to better outcomes like, for example, how you can place an attack die in a space affected by a booster die to up its damage.

                              <span>Grand Theft Auto Online’s been around for the best part of a decade, but you can now become a taxi driver at long last. You’ll probably need to do some light robbery to afford to buy a taxi from Warstock Cache &amp; Carry for the most authentic cab driver experience. Still, it’s relatively straightforward to start your latest, and uncharacteristically honest, money making venture. If you don’t have a taxi then you can still start taxi work jobs, and completing 10 in a row unlocks the cheaper trade price to nab a legit taxi. You can even call a cab from your iFruit phone to fast travel, if you don’t fancy driving your own.

I managed to drag the experience out for all it was worth, but in the end, there was nothing to do but let go, and complete the fifth and final game in the Ace Attorney Turnabout Collection. And, oh, my heart, the post-game blues are real!
I was extremely late to the party when it comes to Capcom&#x27;s long-running series of legal dramedy visual novels, which debuted all the way back in 2001. But I found my way here in the end, largely thanks to the aforementioned collection, which packages prettied-up versions of the original Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy and its prequel duology The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles onto modern systems.

                              <span>An adorable family of furry mammals traversing a dystopian urban environment; snapshots of joy and intimacy (playful hunts, mutual grooming, snuggling together for a nap) already infused with the melancholy of impending catastrophe; the terrible, life-altering moment when a young cub loses its footing and plunges into unknown depths, separated from the pack. Our fledgling protagonist, alone for the first time, has to fend for itself and find its way among the perilous mega-city ruins.  


If you engaged at all with the indie-game sphere in 2022, chances are this introduction rings a bell. Only it’s not a description of last year’s breakaway hit and multi-award winner, BlueTwelve Studio’s Stray, but an older and much more brutal feline saga, Videocult’s grim survival action game Rain World. The thematic overlap of these games, coupled with their contrasting design philosophies, provides an excellent springboard to reassess the latter – one of the most opaque, challenging, and underappreciated titles in recent memory, just in time for the arrival of its first official DLC, Rain World: Downpour.

                              <span>Deadpool will break the fourth wall and probably your face on January 26th, when the wise-cracking, chimichanga-loving mercenary arrives as DLC for Marvel’s Midnight Suns. Judging from the new trailer showing him in action that Firaxis have released, they seem to have struck a fine balance between comic book Deadpool and his movie counterpart. You can see Midnight Suns’ take on Wade Wilson in the trailer below.

                              <span>Rockstar have brought Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - Definitive Edition to Steam more than a year after its disastrous launch. GTA Trilogy was originally released as a Rockstar Store exclusive, and packages together GTA III (the first 3D one), GTA: Vice City (the best one), and GTA: San Andreas (the one with CJ in it). The collection’s arrival on Steam replaces the original versions of each game on the storefront, and coincides with a publisher sale that ends February 2nd.

                              <span>Endless Dungeon is set within Amplitude&#x27;s Endless universe, but it&#x27;s neither a 4X strategy game like Endless Space nor a turn-based tactics game like sorta-predecessor Dungeon Of The Endless. It&#x27;s instead a co-op action roguelike, which takes the spaceship exploration and wave defense of Of The and makes it real-time, frantic, explosive.

It now has a release date, too: May 18th.

Now here comes DIG - Deep In Galaxies, a roguelike platformer that looks like a cross between Noita, Caveblazers and Broforce, with cosmic scale, destructible levels, double jump, a grappling hook and co-op. I&#x27;m powerless to resist.

                              <span>You may remember that one of the funniest stories of 2022 was the way that players of War Thunder—an arcadey online shooter featuring real military vehicles—just kept on posting military documents in the game’s forums.

The pair chat with Kyle Hilliard about the first two episodes of HBO&#x27;s The Last Of Us series and share their initial reactions to the show. Unfortunately, the video game industry was subject to massive layoffs this week, with reports of large companies like Microsoft, 343 Industries, and Bethesda reducing their workforce by over 10,000 employees. At the same time, on the media side, our talented peers at Giant Bomb, GameSpot, and Fandom were also affected. 
During The Playlist, the crew chats about recent games they&#x27;ve been playing, including Tchia, PlateUp!, Pentiment, and The Case Of The Golden Idol.

                              <span>We concluded 2022 by returning to our Super Replay roots by tackling an old-school survival horror game. That means replaying one of the greatest games of the PS1 era, Silent Hill! 
In 1999, Konami put the fear of fog in a generation of players with the release of Silent Hill. The eerie title eschewed the more bombastic horror of its main rival at the time, Resident Evil, in favor of more psychological frights. Protagonist Harry Mason must embark on a terrifying search for his missing daughter, Cheryl, within the eerie town of Silent Hill. What unfolds is a descent into madness that kickstarted a franchise that&#x27;s (finally) returning to the limelight after years of dormancy. Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Kyle Hilliard, as we survive Silent Hill’s debut adventure and see how its scares stack up 23 years later. Check out the full series in the header above or by clicking the links below.

Episode 2 - When Doves Cry
Episode 3 - Bible.
Episode 4 - Age Seven, Short, Black Hair

                              <span>Agent Max Payne hit the zeitgeist square in the forehead at the turn of the Millennium. I was only sixteen when Remedy&#x27;s monologuing undercover DEA operative dropped into my life like a... well, a man diving sideways in slow motion with twin pistols blazing. It was that kind of time. The Wachowskis had, not too long before, left an indelible mark on cinema, and pop culture at large, with their stylish countercultural smash hit The Matrix. Dressing in a leather jacket while falling over and openly wielding automatic weaponry was legitimately cool, and not at all creepy. Why are you frowning like that, it&#x27;s almost like you don&#x27;t believe me.

                              <span>Sea Of Thieves is getting a mid-season update today, bringing the chance to catch up on all the pirate gossip with a trusty pet rock pal. The pocket pebble is only an emote that you can buy from the Sea Of Thieves store, but the company might help you keep it together on the long, lonely journeys across the game’s seas. The update also introduces a new time-limited event, The Secret Wilds, and some matchmaking improvements for PvP. Watch the video below for more on what’s coming in the latest Sea Of Thieves update.

The Tomb Raider Special Pack will go live at 5pm GMT/6pm CET/9am ET, and you’ll be able to take on the Croft Manor job from the new Specials area in the main menu. You can watch Lara’s gaff being cleaned down in the trailer below.

                              <span>There’s a lot I’m excited for in Tchia. Revealed at the Game Awards back in 2020, the trailer boasted a whole load of activities: sailing, climbing, ukelele playing, swimming, tree-hopping, slingshot sharpshooting, totem carving, gliding - the list is never ending - and all set on a beautiful island with characters to talk to, quests to complete, and enemies to fight. And on top of all that, you also have the ability to &quot;soul-jump&quot; letting you control any animal or object.
It sounds too good to be true, right? But two years after Awaceb&#x27;s trailer debut, I’ve gotten my hands on a preview build to see whether a nine-person dev team’s tropical island exploration game is pie in the sky. Turns out, it’s the opposite; my hands on time suggests Tchia will deliver on everything it promised and more.

                              <span>The CEO of Ubisoft has apologised to staff for comments he made in an email last week, which appeared to blame employees for cuts and delays at the publisher. Kotaku report that Yves Guillemot began a Q&amp;A meeting with an apology for his suggestion that sorting out issues at Ubisoft was the responsibility of lower-level staff, summarised by the phrase “the ball is in your court”. Guillemot had come under fire from Ubisoft staff following his comments, which prompted calls from one French union for Ubisoft Paris staff to strike later this month.

And that&#x27;s thanks to a new trailer where Kiryu/Ryoma drop (kicks) his bruising samurai lifestyle to the side for a simpler, purer existence: chopping spring onions to a rhythm in what looks to be an in-depth farming side activity.

Bloomberg report that it’s not yet known what the scale of the job losses at Bethesda and 343 Industries will be, and Kotaku has also confirmed that The Coalition will also lose staff. Sources claim that some of the staff who’d lost their jobs at the affected studios were veterans who’d been with Microsoft for more than a decade. This layoff announcement from Microsoft has been made exactly a year after the company revealed they were buying Activision Blizzard.

That&#x27;s the case today with this deal on a 32GB dual-channel kit of DDR5-6000 from TeamGroup, specifically their T-Force Delta RGB RAM. It&#x27;s been reduced from its ridiculous launch MSRP of $339.99 down to $149.99, a great price for this spec and especially for a kit that comes equipped with RGB lighting.

                              <span>French national anti-piracy agency Arcom has announced that sports organizations and Internet providers have signed a new anti-piracy agreement. Blocking measures are already cemented in law, but the new agreement establishes &#x27;good practices&#x27; while also addressing costs. The ISPs, meanwhile, call on search engines and hosting companies to follow suit.

                              <span>As announced in a recent blog post, 13 new games are coming to PlayStation VR2, and they’re all expected to release “within one month of the February 22 launch.” They are as follows:
Before Your Eyes
Kayak VR: Mirage
Pavlov VR
Puzzling Places
Song in the Smoke: Rekindled
Synth Riders: Remastered Edition
Thumper
NFL Pro Era
What the Bat?
Rez Infinite
Tetris Effect
Creed Rise to Glory: Championship Edition
The Last Clockwinder
The blog post also mentions that Gran Turismo 7 will receive a free VR2 update on launch day. A statement from the president of Polyphony Games details that “While 2-player splitscreen races are not supported in VR, all other races, including online races, will be available.” In case you missed it, Resident Evil Village will also get a VR update on launch day.
This list of 13 joins the existing lineup of 11 VR games PlayStation announced last November and the six games announced in December. Combined with other previously announced titles, like Horizon: Call of the Mountain, PlayStation VR2 will have over 30 games available to play within a month of launch.
PlayStation VR2 is set to come out on February 22, just over a month from today. A few months ago, we learned that the base model will cost $549.99, with the option to bundle it with Horizon Call the Mountain for an additional $50.

EA Sports has been producing officially licensed PGA Tour video games since 1990, with stars like Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy lending their names to the product over the years. However, the company has not released a PGA Tour video game since 2015, meaning other franchises have had time to slide into the space once occupied by EA Sports’ mainstay series.
However, EA Sports is ready to make up for lost time with its newest title. The emphasis this time around is on realism, not only with how the players and courses look but also in how players must approach every hol…</span>

                              <span>A Ubisoft game known as Project Q leaked early last year before the Assassin&#x27;s Creed maker revealed its existence, calling it a team-based battle arena combat game. 
Insider Gaming reported yesterday that Ubisoft had canceled Project Q and now, Ubisoft has confirmed that this is, in fact, true to Video Games Chronicle. 
&quot;We can confirm we will no longer support the development of Project Q in order to focus on priority projects, to which our teams are being reallocated,&quot; Ubisoft told VGC. 
This cancelation comes after Ubisoft delayed Skull and Bones last week alongside news that it had canceled three unannounced games. It&#x27;s currently unclear if Project Q was one of those three games canceled (while Project Q was technically announced, it was revealed as an in-the-works project rather than a game with a final title so perhaps Ubisoft considered it unannounced). 
For more, read about what Project Q was going to be here.

                              <span>Pokémon Scarlet and Violet arrived on Switch last November, and the Pokémon Trading Card Game is ready to leave Galar for the open world of Paldea. That first Scarlet and Violet expansion arrives this March (alongside various changes, including a price increase), but first, we have one more Sword and Shield expansion to get to.
Pokémon Trading Card Game: Sword &amp; Shield – Crown Zenith, out this week, adds more than 160 new cards, including 3 new Radiant Pokémon, five Pokémon VMax cards, eight Pokémon VStar cards, and 70 cards with special Galarian Gallery artwork. The Pokémon Company sent over some of the products in this special expansion, and we cracked them to see what we could pull.
Though I&#x27;m frustrated you can&#x27;t buy these as individual booster packs (they&#x27;re only available in larger packs like the Elite Trainer Box and special collections), I absolutely love several of the cards I pulled. In particular, the full-art cards are absolutely striking. I&#x27;m very happy with the Radiant Charizard, and the Pikachu and Lucario cards might be among my favorites of those respective Pokémon. You can see the full gallery below.

Pokémon Trading Card Game: Sword &amp; Shield – Crown Zenith arrives starting on January 20 with the Elite Trainer Box and Collections starring Regieleki V or Regidrago V. New Tins and Collections will arrive through May. For all things Pokémon Trading Card Game, head to our special hub by clicking the banner below!</span>

                              <span>Microsoft laid off 10,000 employees across various departments yesterday, including its HoloLens and engineering sectors as well as at gaming companies in its portfolio like Bethesda Game Studios and 343 Industries. 
The company hasn&#x27;t revealed exact numbers and specific departments regarding the layoffs yet, but some employees at Bethesda Game Studios, which is hard at work getting Starfield ready for its release this year, were laid off. According to a Bloomberg report, though, Halo Infinite developer 343 Industries was hit hardest by the layoffs. Again, neither Microsoft nor 343 Industries has revealed an exact number but based on industry discussion online, it seems like the studio lost quite a lot of people.

                              <span>Microsoft has laid off 10,000 employees. 
This news comes from a Bloomberg report detailing that Microsoft&#x27;s layoff come as the company attempts to reduce costs amid a larger economic slowdown. These layoffs come amidst Microsoft&#x27;s ongoing fight against the FTC to acquire Call of Duty makers Activision Blizzard for a staggering $69 billion. Bloomberg reports that some people at Bethesda Game Studios, which is hard at work on getting Starfield ready for its release sometime in the first half of this year, were laid off, but that Halo Infinite developer 343 Industries was hit hardest in the company&#x27;s portfolio of game studios. 
According to Bloomberg, Microsoft has plans to hire in &quot;strategic, competitive areas&quot; like AI but that other tech-focused departments like HoloLens and some engineering divisions were hit by these layoffs. 
Microsoft has not yet revealed exact numbers and specific departments surrounding this massive wave of layoffs. Another tech giant, Amazon, is in the middle of its own string of layoffs as the company aims to reduce its workforce by 18,000. 
The hearts of Game Informer&#x27;s staff are with all those who were affected by these layoffs.

                              <span>You may be able to hack your way across the Lands Between, but do you really know them? Can you tell your Nokrons from your Nokstellas? How about your Sanctums from your Catacombs? Can you distinguish between the Ainsel River and the Ainsel River Main? Look me in the eye and tell me you can pinpoint the Cathedral of Manus Celes, I dare you.
Alternatively, you can try out this fan-made Elden Ring Geoguessr-inspired game that plonks you into a random bit of the map and scores you based on how close you can drop a pin to your true location. If Rings aren&#x27;t your thing LostGamer.io has maps from other games, too, including Skyrim and Fortnite. It&#x27;s a lovely idea.

                              <span>I still say the Hylics games are some of the prettiest around, with their striking mix of claymation and video capture. So I&#x27;m delighted to realise that, unbeknowst to me, creator Mason Lindroth occasionally give behind-the-scenes peeks at props and animations on Twitter. It is very interesting to see those original handcrafted figures. And it is very funny to discover that the process of animating one character&#x27;s hands involved wearing a little cardboard green screen like a shroud while waggling a sexy gloved arm through the hole.

I played Returnal last year and can confirm that it is splendid, and also that you will grow to hate the kamikaze squid in the final area with every fibre of your being. Presuming you get that far.

It&#x27;s more than just a slick sci-fi city builder, boasting battleship combat and the ability to tinker with what goes on inside your buildings.

                              <span>Far Cry 2 is a lot of things, based on the memories I have from playing it a decade ago. First and foremost, I recall Far Cry 2: Parasitic Pain, which tasks you with running around begging for pills to stave off a growing infection. Next comes Far Cry 2: Buddy Bonanza, which lets you make lots of lovely AI friends, charge into battles together, and then hide while they die. Then, there’s Far Cry 2: Firewatch, which is all about watching fire. It&#x27;s the best.

Publisher Fellow Traveller have announced this Arctic naval expedition gone wrong will be setting sail on February 24th, so ready your blankets and hot cuppas, folks. This icy, story-driven survival &#x27;em up will chill you the bone.

                              <span>The EU have voted to push for reform in the videogame industry, backing a report that takes aim at everything from loot boxes to human rights violations tied up with gold-farming. The report includes calls for better parental control options, &quot;harmonised rules&quot; compelling sellers to show more information about game content, and a clamp down on third-party skin gambling.
Those are all laudable goals, but time will tell how much change this actually amounts to.

                              <span>Something you could never accuse A Plague Tale: Requiem of is a lack of eye candy. As grim, gory, and engulfed in rats as this medieval stealth adventure is, mon dieu is it a looker on PC. For those among us with one of the brawnier graphics cards on the market, it’s just become even prettier too, via the slightly delayed implementation of ray tracing.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been holding something in for 5 years. It first started as a deep joy, like a ray of sunshine in the palm of my hand. Then it became a deep sense of longing for something I&#x27;d lost, like a cascade of sand that fell from my palm as I wept gently on an empty beach. The &quot;it&quot; is a mobile and Nintendo Switch game called Pokémon Quest (don&#x27;t laugh), which was the first - and only -  mobile game I&#x27;ve actively obsessed over.
The game&#x27;s an auto-battler where you gather a small trio from the original 150 Pokéfolks, level them up, and then tackle trickier and trickier stages. After a frankly disgusting number of hours, I&#x27;d finished all the stages. So, I thought, &quot;Yes, of course they will add the 2nd generation of Pokéfolks with a bunch of new stages. This is its natural evolution, if you will&quot;. It still hasn&#x27;t happened and probably never will. And I hate that I can&#x27;t find anything else that&#x27;ll replace it.

                              <span>Thunderful Games have announced they&#x27;re going to be holding a special SteamWorld stream next Monday January 23rd, where they&#x27;ll be unveiling what&#x27;s next for the series. Taking place at 9.30am PST / 5.30pm GMT, it&#x27;s not clear what the SteamWorld Telegraph: Special Broadcast will entail just yet, but given we already know several SteamWorld games are in development at the moment, here&#x27;s a rough guess-timate of what to expect.

                              <span>Indonesian studio Mojiken have been making games for years. Most of them are less than an hour long. They&#x27;re short, punchy adventures and cover everything from digital fortune tellers, violin-playing owl-men, and poetic folktales about potato-shaped forest creatures. 
A Space For The Unbound is Mojiken’s first &#x27;big&#x27; release in that sense, clocking in at around nine-ish hours. What begins as a YA coming-of-age tale about a small-town romance quickly gains remarkable momentum, and suddenly you’re dealing with supernatural teens trying to desperately stop a world-ending calamity. Part sci-fi drama, part high school romance, A Space For The Unbound manages to have incredible weight and grandeur while also being poignant, sweet, and honest at the same time. It&#x27;s a triumph.

                              <span>Last time, you decided that programmable party members are better than optional grinding. I can respect that. Yeah, it&#x27;s sometimes fun to turn your brain off and grind out a bit, but there&#x27;s a lot to say for doing the work up front to get your party and builds running correctly then just watch them go. This week, I ask you to choose between one thing which speaks to my inner teenager, and one thing which speaks to my inner child. What&#x27;s better: big engines rising from the bonnet, or knocking folks over edges?

                              <span>In games it&#x27;s often a delight to be proven wrong. Such as, for example, my longstanding belief that Dwarf Fortress would never make the biggest and most important change it possibly could, and fit itself with an interface fit for purpose.

Bay 12 Games have, of course, gone further than that, and released it for general sale on the biggest shop in the business after sixteen years as freeware. There&#x27;s even a charming new graphics overhaul to replace the famous ASCII symbols which, depending on who you ask, might not have technically counted as &quot;graphics&quot; at all.
I&#x27;m not here to discuss the relative merits of this shiny new version and the &quot;classic&quot; version. Both will be updated in future, the latter still free, and neither expected to reach a full 1.0 release inside 20 years. All this chips around the edges of what I&#x27;ve been pondering, which is this: What exactly is Dwarf Fortress&#x27;s place within our culture now, after a decade replete with games that looked to it for ideas?

                              <span>In 2021 I reviewed Backbone, a masterpiece of 2D pixelart that was partly a point &#x27;n&#x27; click detective noir game, and mostly a grim story-focused fever dream about collectivism. At the time I described it as &quot;like The Good Place with more depression, or Disco Elysium with raccoons.&quot; Backbone has an ending so bizarre on a literal level that it defies description even if I wanted to spoil it. A while back developers Eggnut teased that they were working on a new game, and it turns out that game is Tails: The Backbone Preludes, a prequel that probably won&#x27;t answer any questions you might&#x27;ve had about the ending of Backbone. It&#x27;s also out very soon, on February 2nd.

                              <span>Part of RPS’s goal is to shine a spotlight on every corner of the gaming peninsula, and a BIG part of that includes the incredible realm of indie games. In additional to our written work about the wonderful world of indie games, starting from now we&#x27;ll also be doing that across the audio waves in the form of our brand new podcast, Indiescovery!
Indiescovery is the new sibling in the RPS podcast family and will sit snuggly next to Ultimate Audio Bang, and The Electronic Wireless Show, but our focus is strictly on the wonderful world of indie games. It’s best to think of the podcast as an extension of our Indiescovery tag on the site - although we&#x27;ve got the Indiescovery Podcast tag just for the pod, if you ever want to check all the episodes. Every episode video bud Liam, guides lass Rebecca and myself (reviews ranger Rachel) will highlight a bunch of cool indies and talk about why we love them. We&#x27;ll be gabbing about the latest indie darlings, exciting upcoming releases, hidden gems lost to space and time, and more.

Both are great drives for the money, so if you&#x27;re in the market for a storage upgrade you&#x27;ve just got to decide whether you can benefit from the faster speeds and better components of the KC3000, or whether you prefer the lower price of the P3.

And now it&#x27;s 85% off this week on Steam, meaning you can pick it up for £2.69/$3.

In a motion to dismiss, EngineOwning reveals that Activision sued them in Germany over two years ago and the lawsuit is still ongoing.

Everyone has something they loved spending time with in the past – a restaurant, a daily-play video game, a group of friends – only to one day unknowingly enjoy doing so for the final time. It&#x27;s a poignant and often heartbreaking truth of how places evolve, tastes change, and priorities divert as we all grow older. For the eponymous hero in Lil Gator Game, that activity is live-action role-playing with his big sis. With his sister home from college, Gator assembles a master plan to pry her away from her coursework for one more game. The resulting adventure is a short, cute, Zelda-in…</span>

                              <span>Netflix&#x27;s Sonic Prime series hit the streaming service back in December, and it seems more episodes are on the way. 
While it sits at a 60 percent critic score on Rotten Tomatoes, Sonic Prime received an 88 percent audience score, which is pretty great as far as video game TV shows go. Of course, Rotten Tomatoes doesn&#x27;t account for every person that watched the series, but it&#x27;s a quick look at what audiences thought. It seems Netflix is ready to answer the desire for more because the official Sonic the Hedgehog Twitter account announced today that more Sonic Prime episodes are coming later this year.

As you can see, there&#x27;s not much to go on here, so it&#x27;s currently unclear if these are just additional episodes or the reveal that a Season 2 is happening. Regardless, more Sonic Prime is coming to Netflix in 2023.

                              <span>Developer Avalanche and publisher Warner Bros. Interactive have released a new cinematic trailer for Hogwarts Legacy, giving viewers a bird&#x27;s eye view, literally, of the titular school and the surrounding castle grounds. 
With Hogwarts Legacy due out on current-get consoles and PC in just a few weeks, on February 10, it&#x27;s no surprise we&#x27;re getting a trailer like this today. It&#x27;s a great look at what to expect in the game, including beasts and creatures, characters like Professor Weasley and Nearly Headless Nick, and more. There&#x27;s even some Avada Kadavra-casting foes to be seen, as well as dragons and spiders to fights. And all of it is shown through the view of an owl delivering a Hogwarts acceptance letter to a soon-to-be wizard. 
Check out the 4K version of this Hogwarts Legacy cinematic trailer below: 


For more about Hogwarts Legacy, check out everything we learned in the second gameplay showcase, which aired last month, and then read about the latest details revealed during a Sony State of Play last year. Check out Hogwarts Legacy&#x27;s PlayStation 5 DualSense features after that. Read about how controversial Harry Potter creator JK Rowling is not involved with the making of Hogwarts Legacy (although she will almost certainly be getting money as a direct result of this game) and then check out this trailer showcasing common rooms, easter eggs, and more. 
Hogwarts Legacy hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on February 10. It launches on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on April 4, and finally, the Switch version will be released on July 25.

Regardless of what kind of performance you&#x27;re aiming for, you&#x27;ll need a pretty beefy machine, with 24GB of RAM and an RTX 3070 required to hit those recommended specs.

                              <span>Last week, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot sent a letter to all staff in which he asked employees to &quot;give it [their] all&quot; and to be &quot;as efficient and lean as possible.&quot; French union Solidaires Informatique have written their own letter today, arguing that Guillemot&#x27;s &quot;words mean something: overtime, managerial pressure, burnout, etc.&quot; 

In response, they&#x27;re calling for Ubisoft Paris employees to strike from 2 to 6pm on Friday, January 27th, with demands that include an &quot;immediate 10% increase for all salaries&quot; and the &quot;implementation of a 4-day week.&quot;

                              <span>As someone whose only experience with the Persona series lay with Persona 5, I dove into Persona 3 Portable&#x27;s PC re-release with one expectation: it will be old and therefore quite bad. Looking back, was I naïve? Yes. And was I wrong? I&#x27;m delighted to report that I was catastrophically wrong.
From what I&#x27;ve played so far of Persona 3, I reckon it&#x27;s well worth a whirl if you&#x27;re a newcomer, or a Persona 5 fan who&#x27;s concerned that a game from 2009 won&#x27;t be all that good. Not only does it stand on its own as a fun high school mystery with an alarmingly dark undertone, it almost acts as a fun history lesson too.

The RIAA asked for $250,000 after winning its case against the YouTube ripper. However, according to Yout, a payment now would seriously harm its legal defense as funds are running low.

For the next month, stakeholders are invited to share experiences and potential solutions to tackle pirate IPTV services. The only caveat is that proposals must be actionable under existing law, which rightsholders say isn&#x27;t up to the job.

                              <span>Persona 3 released in North America in 2007 on PlayStation 2 and was a mild hit. The dark, teen drama RPG had a niche audience, but those who found the game adored it. The game received a special edition release with added in content in 2008 with FES, and was then re-released a third time for PSP in 2010 with the most added content, but some modifications made to run on Sony&#x27;s handheld platform.
Persona 4 followed – again a mild hit – but then Persona 5 came along and cemented the franchise&#x27;s reputation as one of the best RPGs ever made. Fans who discovered the series with 5 have wanted to figure out what they&#x27;ve been missing out on, and longtime players have been demanding the re-release of 3 so that a larger audience could play what many call their favorite. After arguably too long, Atlus is finally ready to make that happen with the re-re-re-release of Persona 3 on modern consoles January 19.
Join Kyle Hilliard and Wesley LeBlanc as they look at the game&#x27;s first true dungeon and chat about perhaps the most controversial Persona game in the series.

                              <span>Heads up, Stadia owners: Google’s cloud gaming program is shutting down today, January 18. The service began issuing refunds for all hardware last November, but if you haven’t received one yet, information on how to obtain one should have been emailed to the Google account used to make the purchase. However, past Stadia Pro subscriptions will not receive refunds.
There&#x27;s a silver lining for those of you with Stadia controllers and nothing to use them for. You can download an update that will allow your controller to use Bluetooth. However, be warned: this permanently disables wi-fi capabilities, so if you download the update now, you won&#x27;t be able to play Stadia games before the shutdown. For more details, you can visit the Stadia Help Center.
Stadians, you can now update your Stadia Controller’s firmware to enable Bluetooth Low Energy connections.

If you missed the news about the shutdown, last September, Stadia’s VP and General Manager said in a blog post that “while Stadia&#x27;s approach to streaming games for consumers was built on a strong technology foundation, it hasn&#x27;t gained the traction with users that we expected so we’ve made the difficult decision to begin winding down our Stadia streaming service.” 
Stadia’s struggles were no secret. Its first-party studios were shut down just over a year in, with the service being “deprioritized” a year later. While it was an interesting experiment, some experiments are just destined to fail. Rest in peace, Stadia.</span>

Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty’s public demo gave players a chance to experience a more general idea of what this fast-paced action game offers, but Koei Tecmo recently gave us the chance to go deeper and play through the first two chapters in Wo Long in full. I’m starting to understand that developer Team Ninja is aiming for a wider swath of players with Wo Long as opposed to its Nioh titles, which are some of the most demanding in games. While Wo Long still features that trademark From Software-inspired challenge, it also features a unique system that allows you to change an enemy’s…</span>

                              <span>The Last of Us, the highly anticipated TV adaptation of Naughty Dog&#x27;s hit game of the same name, finally premiered Sunday and it&#x27;s looking like a massive hit for HBO. 
That&#x27;s because The Last of Us&#x27; premiere was the second largest debut for an HBO series since 2010, beaten only by last year&#x27;s House of the Dragon, the first TV spinoff from HBO&#x27;s Game of Thrones series. The Last of Us drew in 4.7 million views, according to a Deadline report, coming in second to House of the Dragon&#x27;s 2022 premiere which pulled in 9.986 million watchers. The Last of Us is matched by HBO&#x27;s Boardwalk Empire, which premiered in 2010 to 4.81 million viewers. 
Deadline writes that HBO says Sunday night viewing usually represents 20 to 40% of a given show&#x27;s gross audience per episode (HBO shows typically release episodes on Sunday nights). 
&quot;We are thrilled to see fans of the series and game alike experience this iconic story in a new way, and we extend our gratitude to them for helping to make it a success,&quot; CEO and chairman of HBO and HBO Max Content Casey Bloys said, according to Deadline. &quot;Congratulations to [showrunners Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann, who is also a co-creator of The Last of Us], and the brilliant cast and crew who worked tirelessly to bring this show to life. We look forward to fans around the world enjoying the rest of the season.&quot; 
&quot;Our focus was simply to make the best possible adaption of this beloved story for as big an audience as we could,&quot; Druckmann and Mazin said, according to Deadline. &quot;We are overjoyed to see how many fans, both old and new, have welcomed The Last of Us into their homes and their hearts.&quot; 
While waiting for this week&#x27;s episode, read our interview with Druckmann and Joel actor Pedro Pascal about how The Last of Us was changed for TV, and then read about how there are no plans for The Last of Us show to go beyond the games.

                              <span>A new image from Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League has leaked and it seems to confirm that it will be a live service game, or at least feature games-as-a-service elements.
This image, which you can view in the tweet below, comes from the 4chan forum, as reported by Video Games Chronicle, which has also verified with sources that the image is real. The image appears to be Suicide Squad&#x27;s start menu and features standard things like game mode selection, chapter select, difficulty, and matchmaking. It also features some menus to page through at the top, including a &quot;Battle Pass&quot; one. Under those top-bar menus are what appear to be various currencies, too. 
First look at the Suicide Squad game menu. Mentions Battle Pass, Loadout, Missions based structure. #Batman #SuicideSquad pic.twitter…</span>

&quot;You know how fuzzy memories can be.&quot; It&#x27;s a convenient and hand-wavy line delivered by the new character Lim, warning the Straw Hat Pirates of the impending adventures into some of One Piece&#x27;s most popular story arcs. Likewise, One Piece Odyssey can be a fuzzy experience. It oscillates between being thrilling and tedious. The promise of discovering &quot;what if…?&quot; scenarios is enticing for longtime fans, but it rarely follows through in a meaningful way. And as a potential introductory point for new fans, One Piece O…</span>

Golf Story was one of the biggest surprises in the Switch’s extremely strong first year on the market. Thanks to Golf Story’s charming, nostalgic presentation and novel sports/RPG fusion, Sports Story has long been one of my most anticipated sequels. Unfortunately, its unfocused nature and frustrating gameplay are only overshadowed by a pervasive lack of polish that prevents Sports Story from being worth your time. 
As the name suggests, Sports Story expands the world to include other games while creating a more sweeping and ambitious story. As sports go…</span>

                              <span>Awesome Games Done Quick (AGDQ) started the New Year with a bang, raising over $2.6 million for the Prevent Cancer Foundation. For the unfamiliar, GDQ is a 24-hour charity live-stream where dedicated gamers show off speedruns of their favorite games. Before 2020, most events were held in person, but since then they&#x27;ve mostly been broadcasted from streamers&#x27; homes. This year&#x27;s event ran from January 8-15 and included over 140 runs.

While most runners don&#x27;t expect to set new records during the marathon, a whopping four were set this year for the following games: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder&#x27;s Revenge, PowerWash Simulator, Super Mario Galaxy 2, and Steven Seagal Is: The Final Option (Prototype). Most years have one or two records set, but four is a big deal.
2023 marks the 14th year that the biannual charity marathon has taken place. They have two main events in the winter and summer, but they also hold smaller events throughout the year. One of these is Frost Fatales, an all-women speedrunning event, which will take place from February 26 - March 4, 2023 on Twitch. Since it was founded in 2010, the organization has raised over $43 million for charity.
AGDQ was initially set to be in person but was moved online due to COVID concerns. Their summer event, Summer Games Done Quick, will be held from May 28 - June 4, though it&#x27;s unclear whether the event will also take place in person.

The developer platform took action in response to a takedown request sent by City of London Police&#x27;s Intellectual Property Crime Unit. The takedown notice concludes that the site, which did not link to any infringing content directly, is illegal.

PikaShow&#x27;s response was to sponsor the Afghan national cricket team and advertise itself on broadcast TV. According to police in India, a college student was arrested last week on suspicion of monetizing pirated TV streams via the PikaShow app.

The discussion is timely, though, as the big release of the week is One Piece Odyssey, Bandai Namco&#x27;s impressive RPG based on the popular anime. John Carson, who is reviewing the game for Game Informer, returns to talk about his experience and share his favorite games of 2022. We are also joined by former Game Informer editor and former host of this very podcast, Benjamin Reeves! Reeves makes his triumphant return to The Game Informer Show to also share his favorite games of 2022 and, alongside Wesley LeBlanc, reveal just how little they know about One Piece with our Devil Fruit quiz.

                              <span>Developer Scavengers Studio revealed last month that it was releasing Season: A Letter To The Future on January 31, and now, just a few weeks ahead of that, the studio has released a gorgeous new story trailer. 
This new trailer provides yet another beautiful glimpse into the painterly world of Season while providing new details about what our protagonist is doing: archiving the end of the Earth and the final people still living on it. She strives to capture their final moments in her journal and with her camera, aiming to learn why they&#x27;re still around and ultimately, what kept them going. It sounds like quite the emotional journey.

                              <span>Developer Motive Studio and publisher EA have released a new story trailer for its upcoming remake of Dead Space, and the game continues to look terrifying and beautiful. 
Due out on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC later this month on January 27, this might be one of our last looks at the remake before it&#x27;s in the hands of players. Fortunately, this new trailer is nearly two minutes of cinematics and gameplay from the remake focused on the story of Dead Space. As expected, this remake isn&#x27;t changing much at all, utilizing the same story from the original 2008 release with updated visuals and audio (plus some new voice lines for protagonist Isaac Clarke). 
Check out the new Dead Space Remake &quot;Humanity Ends Here&quot; trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Dead Space Remake continues to look great and we can&#x27;t wait to play it in just a few weeks.

Marvel Snap has been a resounding success since its release, allowing players to compete against other real-world players with a variety of cards, random locations, and more. Despite the positive reception, one thing players have been asking for has been missing: the ability to play against your friends. Developer Second Dinner announced in November that it was working on an update to allow friends to battle each other and now, it has announced that this update is expected at the end of the month. 
More specifically, the update is expected in a January 31 update, but Second Dinner says if it runs &quot;into any last minutes issues, we may choose to delay for a little longer t…</span>

                              <span>In Vengeful Guardian: Moonrider you might just be the bad guy. You have Metroid-inspired traversal abilities, a Mega Man X sword, and a platter of six levels and bosses to pursue in any order you choose. But are you doing the right thing? The important thing is it feels good to play and is incredibly reminiscent of the 16-bit era of video games in the best way.

                              <span>Microsoft has announced an Xbox and Bethesda Developer Direct, a new games showcase &quot;providing fans an inside look at some of the games coming to Xbox, PC, and Game Pass over the next few months.&quot; 
It will air on January 25 and feature Xbox studios like Arkane Austin, Mojang Studios, Turn 10 Studios, and ZeniMax Online Studios. This Developer Direct will &quot;focus on big features, extended gameplay showcases, and the latest info for Xbox games launching in the next few months,&quot; including The Elder Scrolls Online, Forza Motorsport, Minecraft Legends, and Redfall. 
You might notice a big galaxy-sized absence in this lineup: Starfield. Fret not, Xbox says a standalone Starfield show is in the works &quot;to dedicate the proper amount of time for a deep dive&quot; into the game. 
As for what to expect for each game, Xbox has detailed that too. For The Elder Scrolls Online, ZeniMax Online Studios will unveil 2023&#x27;s major chapter update, &quot;including the latest regions of Tamriel to become playable in ESO, as well as a major new feature coming in the game&#x27;s biggest update this year.&quot; A full &quot;ESO Chapter Reveal Event&quot; will follow this Developer Direct. On the Forza Motorsport side of things, Turn 10 Studios will be sharing more gameplay and new details about the game. 
Mojang Studios will showcase a new look into Minecraft Legends&#x27; upcoming PvP multiplayer experience and Arkane Austin will &quot;showcase several minutes of gameplay&quot; from Redfall, including both single player and multiplayer gameplay. Fans can expect to learn more about combat, customization, bosses, the open world, and more, according to Xbox. 
The Xbox and Bethesda Developer Direct airs on Wednesday, January 25, at 12 p.m. PT/ 3 p.m. ET.

The company cites &quot;major challenges as the industry continues to shift towards mega-brands and long-lasting titles that can reach players across the globe, across platforms and business models.&quot; It says that over the last four years, its strategy has been about building &quot;long-lasting live games and adapting our strongest franchises&quot; like Assassin&#x27;s Creed, Far Cry, and Tom Clancy games like Ghost Recon, Rainbow Six, and The Division &quot;to converging trends to make them truly global brands.&quot;

                              <span>Final Fantasy XVI is due out June 22 exclusively on PlayStation 5, but some fans believe a PC version of the game could release as soon as six months after its console debut. However, FF16 producer Naoki Yoshida isn&#x27;t sure why. 
During a recent Final Fantasy XIV stream, Yoshida, who is a director on that game, was asked about rumors surrounding a PC version of FF16, and he responded, &quot;I don&#x27;t know where the notion of a PC version releasing six months after the game is out came from as none of us have ever said that,&quot; according to a translator, as reported by Eurogamer. He followed it up with two instances urging fans to buy the PS5 version. 
According to a translation by Siliconera, Yoshida also said, &quot;There&#x27;s been talk that the PC version will come out, but no one on the team has said anything about the PC version. I wonder why people assume the PC version will arrive six months after [the PS5 version], so just go ahead and buy a PS5.&quot; 
The talk of a PC version of the game stems from a promotional PlayStation 5 video released last year that says in small print that FF16 will be a &quot;PS5 exclusive for six months.&quot; Some extrapolated from this small print that a PC release of the game will come after that six months of exclusivity is up, but if Yoshida&#x27;s recent comments are any indication, the team has nothing to say in regards to a PC version. 
Final Fantasy XVI hits PlayStation 5 on June 22. While waiting for more information, watch this &quot;Ambition&quot; trailer that reveals more about Valisthea&#x27;s kingdoms, dominants, and eikons, and then check out our interview with Yoshida about the game&#x27;s boss fights.

                              <span>The original Dead Island 2 reveal trailer is now an iconic (perhaps infamous) moment in games. It was a great trailer, people were excited, and then fast forward nearly a decade later, and the game is still in development.  
First revealed back in 2014, Dead Island 2 was in development at Spec Ops: The Line developer Yager, with Dead Island developer Techland having parted ways with the property to work on Dying Light. Publisher Deep Silver handed over development of the game to LittleBigPlanet 3 developer Sumo Digital in 2016, and then, in 2019, the company announced that Homefront: The Revolution developer Dambuster Studios would be developing Dead Island 2. It&#x27;s now 2023 and Dambuster&#x27;s Dead Island 2 is due out in April, finally.

This new studio is called Maverick Games and the team there is already working on a new &quot;premium open-world game for consoles and PC,&quot; according to a Eurogamer report. This studio is not connected to Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox umbrella of studios. 
Forza Horizon 5&#x27;s creative director, Mike Brown, is leading Maverick and is joined by Playground&#x27;s former lead producer Tom Butcher, who is the new studio&#x27;s executive producer, former technical director Matt Craven, who is Maverick&#x27;s chief technical officer, and former technical art director Gareth Harwood, who is now content director.

Unfortunately, while superhero movies have improved dramatically over the last decade, superheroes haven’t been as powerful in the realm of video games. In fact, nearly 40 years after the first superhero video game, many developers still struggle to create worthwhile experiences using some of the biggest names in entertainment today.
While not all superhero games are monumental duds like Superman on Nintendo 64, many tend to deliver middling, forgettable experiences. However, a select few that defy the stereotype to become superb titles we still look back on fondly as not only great superhero games, but terrific video games in their own rights.

                              <span>Weapon durability and its application in games have long been hot topics amongst players. Some love it, some are fine with it, and others hate it. And those feelings vary depending on who you are talking to about this topic. I think of games like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild when someone brings up weapon durability, as it was a hotly debated aspect of its release (I didn&#x27;t mind it at all, personally). 
Love it or hate it, weapon durability is a feature that will likely never go away in games, and that&#x27;s okay because when it&#x27;s done right, it can be a helpful way to push players toward something new. In 2011&#x27;s Dead Island, weapon durability was a big part of the experience, and that feature will return in Dead Island 2 when it hits PlayStation and Xbox consoles, and PC, on April 2…</span>

                              <span>Most new visitors don’t know about Mrs. Riddenbutter’s, but you should do yourself a favor and enjoy some of her hospitality and a tankard or two of her ale. Double-click on her door to open it, and step inside. Riddenbutter works the bar, and the smart traveler should speak with her. Drop an idea on her to get her chatting. Like most people, she likes to talk about this and that and the other thing, and she’ll also frequently respond with information that’s more local in nature.
Yes, the ScummVM team announces support for Halls of the Dead: Faery Tale Adventure II, a marvellous work by our GSoC’21 student Yuri Guimaraes aka a-yyg, who ported the original SAGA2 engine from 1997 by The Dreamers Guild.
Please assist us with testing this game. Take your old dusty CD and feed it to the ScummVM. As usual, you will need the latest daily build of ScummVM. If you encounter any bugs or problems during your gameplay, please file them on our issue tracker.

Especially notable are the new vehicle variants feature for NewGRFs and automatic flipping support for shorten-than-default NewGRF-defined vehicles. On the fixing side, focus was on polishing the new fractional GUI zoom and some other minor bits and pieces. Testing is more important than ever, so please keep it up, and report any issues as normal! Download Changelog Bug tracker</span>
