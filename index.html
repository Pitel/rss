                    <span>The first season of Game Informer&#x27;s Video Gameography explores the history of the Metroid series. This week we&#x27;re tackling Samus&#x27; acclaimed Game Boy Advance outing, Metroid Fusion.
Metroid Fusion launched on November 17, 2002 – the same day as Metroid Prime. Developed by Nintendo R&amp;D1, it stars Samus as she explores a space station overrun by shapeshifting parasites called X. Worst of all, Samus is hunted by an X parasite that has mimicked her appearance and abilities: the SA-X. Metroid Fusion served as a return to the 2D gameplay of Super Metroid with modern improvements such as faster movement and traversal and a ledge grab. Fusion was critically acclaimed as one of the best GBA games ever made; some fans even consider it a rival to Super Metroid as the best entry in the series. Chronologically, Fusion served as the final chapter in the Metroid saga for decades until 2021&#x27;s Metroid Dread. 
Join hosts Ben Reeves (@BenjaminReeves), Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), and special guest Digital Eclipse editorial director Chris Kohler (@kobunheat) as we explore Metroid Fusion&#x27;s lore, development history, and lasting impact.

                    <span>&quot;Nothing is more fun than creating products and services that people love&quot;.
Chances are, you might not have heard of the German company United Games Entertainment, but you&#x27;ll almost certainly have heard of one of its sub-brands.
Strictly Limited Games, for example, is one of the many firms currently pushing special editions of modern titles, while ININ Games has forged publishing relationships with a host of esteemed Japanese firms. United Games Entertainment also partakes in digital publishing via its Games Rocket brand, while its McGame.com portal highlights deals and promotions.

                    <span>And are you in the DLC club?
This week&#x27;s big release on Switch, or update to be more accurate, was version 2.0 of Animal Crossing: New Horizons. A lot of the additions in the free update have been in demand for some time, with the likes of Brewster&#x27;s cafe, gyroids, Kapp&#x27;n boat trips, tons of items and a whole lot more.

There&#x27;s also the Happy Home Paradise DLC, which is a charming paid add-on in which you get to flex your designing skills. You can either buy it outright or opt to sign up to Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack and gain access that way, both good options if you want a meaty expansion to the game.

Nintendo has not had a good run with Switch game leaks in recent months, and now to top it off, the upcoming Pokémon Diamond and Pearl remakes appear to already be in the hands of some individuals, who are now seemingly uploading photos and video footage of the anticipated release.

For centuries, the circle has left indelible marks on our culture: Wagner’s Ring cycle; Dante’s Inferno; Pythagoras’ Theorem; Domino’s Pizza. And now Kenny Sun’s Circa Infinity arrives on Switch to distract us from all of them – except maybe the pizza.
Fresh on console, this puzzle/action indie platformer hit PC in 2015, causing a stir with its unique concept and striking visuals. You control a little pixel person who runs around the outside of a screen-filling circle. There is a pie-slice segment of the circle that can be entered by standing on its arc and pressing jump. On entering the circle, your person flips to run around the inside of the circumference. Another small circle is floating around the middle of the one you entered, and can be reached by jumping when it’s in range. The screen then zooms so that this new circle fills your view and the process repeats. As you move through the game, new enemy types, behaviours and patterns are introduced; contact with any baddies results in failure.

Back in September, The Pokémon Company revealed the Pokémon Trading Card Game Live - a new app, that was expected to launch sooner rather than later.
Unfortunately, it seems plans have slightly changed, like a lot of other game launches over the past week, TPC has made the tough decision to delay the game until 2022, in order to offer a more polished experience. This will apply to the soft launch for mobile devices as well as the open beta for PC.

                    <span>Tell us your weekend gaming plans.
Another week down in the inexorable march towards 2021&#x27;s holiday season, and it&#x27;s been a busy one Nintendo-wise. The platform holder released its quarterly financial results — profits are down but on track, with industry-wide production issues being a particular thorn in Nintendo&#x27;s side at present — and the release dates of its upcoming slate of games was reconfirmed. The Animal Crossing 2.0 update dropped a day earlier than expected and has been keeping islanders busier than they have been in ages. Gotta love Brewster!
Now, though, it&#x27;s time to chill out and discuss our weekend gaming plans. A few members of the Nintendo Life team have done just that below, so feel free to give our entries a read and then join in with your own via our comment section. Enjoy!

If you have ever wanted to see Nintendo&#x27;s Metroid series get adapted to the big screen, you&#x27;re not alone.
During a recent interview with CNET, Metroid Dread producer Yoshio Sakamoto - who originally worked on the series as a designer - voiced his own interests in seeing Samus in cinema. He finds the idea of it &quot;very interesting&quot; and hopes it could one day become a &quot;reality&quot;.

Nintendo has released the final major free content update for Animal Crossing: New Horizons and there&#x27;s a lot to unpack.
One particular item that&#x27;s been added is a gaming computer, and it&#x27;s got quite a lot of people talking. It&#x27;s not so much the item, but what&#x27;s on the screens that have become the talking point. If you squint hard enough, you might be able to see there&#x27;s a chat program and a colourful first-person style shooter.

                    <span>A new listing has surfaced online.
Square Enix has been remastering a lot of its older RPGs in recent years, and if a new online listing is anything to go by, it seems the Final Fantasy Tactics series could also be making a return.
This is according to an archived page over on the online store Instant Gaming. The remaster will apparently be released on the Epic Games platform and has a placeholder of 2023. The date has been narrowed down to 1st February 2022 - a date retrieved from a GitHub page of Nvidia GeForce leaks, shared by SteamDB creator Pavel Djundik.

                    <span>What makes a good shooter? Immediate answers might include punchy phrases/words like “gun feel” or “kit customization.” Even so, it’s hard to define the gratification that comes with securing that coveted victory in ranked multiplayer or surviving a seemingly never-ending onslaught in single-player horde mode. A good shooter tends to contain a smorgasbord of enticing components – gripping atmosphere, weapon/ability balancing, enjoyable arenas, etc. Regardless of style (e.g., FPS, third-person, top-down), the aforementioned features tend to mesh well with polished gameplay, sweeping narratives, and new or improved mechanics. If you feel at home sprinting through multilayered environments, mowing down adversaries with precision and cunning, then the ten games on this list are definitely wort…</span>

                    <span>Animated adaptations of video games generally receive more faith from players than their live-action counterparts. That’s understandable; most games are animated in one form or another, so it’s easier to replicate an aesthetic than to find actors and build sets that match the source material exactly. On top of the myriad of live-action shows based on games, there’s an equally sizable, if not larger, slate of animated series on the horizon. If you’re a fan of animated takes on the medium, here’s a snapshot of every upcoming TV series to keep an eye on with trailer links where applicable.

                    <span>Skyrim’s 10th anniversary is upon us and Bethesda is re-releasing it, yet again – this time packaged as the Anniversary Edition. 
This new edition includes every piece of Creation Club content ever released, including additional quests, armor, and gameplay modes. It also comes with a new-gen patch for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S players. When the Anniversary Edition was announced back in August, Bethesda revealed that the new-gen update would be free to all who own the Special Edition of Skyrim, which was released during the previous generation of consoles. 
However, those Special Edition players would need to pay in order to get the Creation Club content. A price for both this upgrade to get the new content and the actual Anniversary Edition was not announced at that time, though. Thanks to a new Anniversary Edition FAQ released today, we know the price to both, as reported by IGN. 
“The MSRP for the Skyrim Anniversary Edition on digital storefronts will be USD $49.00… at launch,” the FAQ reads. “If you already own Skyrim Special Edition, the MSRP for the Anniversary Upgarde on digital storefronts will be USD $19.99… at launch.” 
Physical editions of it will be available for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One systems, according to Bethesda, and prices and availability may vary from retailer to retailer. In terms of what to expect with the new-gen upgrade, Bethesda says “the upgrade will be free and optimize the game with enhanced graphics, faster loading times, and more.” 
All trophies and achievements will transfer over from the Special Edition to the Anniversary Edition, as well, except when upgrading from the PS4 version to the PS5 version. The Anniversary Edition will be released on November 11.

While this week&#x27;s big topic is Shin Megami Tensei V (out next week), the theme in our quick-hit news segment is pretty obvious: game delays. Host Brian Shea is joined by Game Informer features editor Kimberley Wallace to talk about all the delays and to chat about what this newest entry to the SMT series brings to the table.

                    <span>343 Industries has released new information about the Halo Infinite Battle Pass system, including how players will be able to switch between passes. 
In a new interview with IGN, Infinite Head of Design Jerry Hook and Lead Progression Designer Chris Blohm discussed how the game’s approach to battle passes will work in the free-to-play multiplayer. They said it&#x27;s aimed at keeping all kinds of players returning to it.

“We wanted to be able to say, ‘Hey, look, when you put 10 bucks in, you keep that 10 bucks’,” Hooks told IGN. 
That’s alluding to the fact that battle passes in Infinite never expire, meaning if you don’t finish a given battle pass before its associated season is up, you can still work on it in the next season. According to Hook and Blohm, …</span>

                    <span>Microsoft has proven itself to be a leader in video game accessibility, and the features available in Forza Horizon 5 support reaffirm that status. In a blog post yesterday, Playground Games’ Mike Brown detailed a large swath of toggles and settings that make Horizon 5 playable for those who may be hearing or visually impaired or have other accessibility needs.
Highlighting the importance of these features in his post, Brown wrote, “We want everyone in the world to be able to experience our game, and with more than an estimated 400 million gamers with disabilities across the globe, it is vital that all players be able to tailor their gameplay in a way that works best for them.” Many of the features present come from conversations with the Gaming &amp; Disability community, which detailed vario…</span>

                    <span>EA CEO Andrew Wilson recently said non-fungible tokens and blockchain games are the future of the video game industry during a recent company earnings call. He also said he’s unsure of how. 
This news comes by way of PC Gamer, which reported on Wilson’s NFT-related statement during the earnings call. In a bit of a cart before the horse situation, Wilson made the bold claim that NFTs and “play-to-earn” games, aka blockchain games, are the “future of our industry” before adding that “it’s still too early to figure out how that’s going to work.” With that being said, it’s unclear what makes him so sure. 
“I think that in the context of games we create and the live services that we offer, collectible digital content is going to play a meaningful part in our future,” Wilson said, according to P…</span>

Dr. Wu is Jurassic World&#x27;s Dr. Frankenstein – a mad scientist who creates new life by sewing together the DNA of different dinosaurs. His hybrids are more capable hunters, better suited to handle harsh climates, and are far more terrifying than the Tyrannosaurs rex. In Jurassic World Evolution 2, we see Frontier Developments taking a cue from Dr. Wu. The dinosaurs players interact with are more aware of their surroundings, can find their own food, and even learn to hunt in packs.

                    <span>Nintendo is reportedly happy with the upcoming CG Mario movie being made by Despicable Me and Minions studio Illumination, and according to Shigeru Miyamoto, more movies based on Nintendo properties could be on the way. 
This news comes by way of Video Games Chronicle, which reported on the latest Q&amp;A session section of Nintendo’s recent financial results briefing. In it, Miyamoto told investors that the upcoming Mario movie is basically done and that Nintendo is feeling very positive about it. 
Don’t get too excited just yet, though – Nintendo doesn’t plan on releasing the movie early despite it being essentially done. It’s still planned for Holiday 2022. Miyamoto reportedly said that Nintendo really wants to meet fans’ expectations with this Mario movie and that as a result, it will use the extra time to continue polishing the film ahead of its release next year. 
Elsewhere in Miyamoto’s discussions about the movie, he said that Nintendo is planning ot make more movies based on its other properties, citing a desire for people to experience said properties in a variety of ways (rather than just video games). He said Nintendo will make each movie one by one, though, so as not to have multiple in production, which could affect each’s quality. 
These comments come just days after rumors of a Donkey Kong movie headed by Seth Rogen, who is voicing Donkey Kong in the Mario movie, began to swirl around, as noted by VGC. Only time will tell what the next Nintendo movie is, but considering Donkey Kong and Cranky Kong, who will be voiced by Fred Armisen, have already been cast, a Donkey Kong movie sounds like a safe bet. 
While waiting to learn more about Nintendo’s movie plans, check out the full cast list for the upcoming Mario movie.

                    <span>Final Fantasy VII: The First Soldier, a mobile battle royale set in Midgar, will be released this month. 
Square Enix had previously stated The First Soldier would be released in November, as reported by IGN, but thanks to the new opening cinematic that debuted on YouTube today, we know the exact release date: November 17. That’s less than two weeks away and what better way to get excited about the dubs you’ll hopefully be getting in the battle royale than by watching the new opening movie for The First Soldier.

Set 30 years before the events of Final Fantasy VII, The First Soldier is about, well, the first soldiers that the Shinra electric Company began using on the outskirt battlefields of Midgar. As expected, the opening movie is completely CG and it doesn’t really feature anything to do with the actual battle royale aspect of The First Soldier, save for the last few seconds that show some characters jumping out of a helicopter in a very battle royale fashion. 
You can pre-register for the battle royale now and doing so could get you some pre-registration rewards, determined by how many people actually pre-register: 
300,000: Chocobo Egg
500,000: Shinra Mask Skin
770,000: Shinra Bike Skin
1,000,000: Shinra Utility Vehicle Skin
2,000,000: Shinra Helicopter Skin
The 75-player Final Fantasy VII battle royale will be released in 12 days on iOS and Android devices on November 17. 
While waiting for that, check out the latest details we learned about Final Fantasy VII: The First Soldier and then read about Final Fantasy VII Ever Crisis, the other Final Fantasy VII-centric mobile game Square Enix announced earlier this year.

                    <span>Elden Ring will have a Performance Mode and a Graphics Mode on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, according to the Collector’s Edition listing on GameStop. 
First discovered by PushSquare, if you go to the Collector’s Edition listing for Elden Ring on either PS5 or Xbox Series X, you can find all kinds of details about FromSoftware’s upcoming open-world RPG. Under the “Enhanced Experience” section, GameStop’s listing says Elden Ring will have two gameplay modes. 
“Using the power of [the] new generation of consoles, [Xbox Series X/S and PS5] will allow players to personalize their experience by choosing between Graphic Mode to enhance the game’s visuals (up to 4K) or Performance Mode for a higher frame rate (up to 60 FPS),” the GameStop listing reads. 
If this is true, it would line up with what we’ve seen in other cross-generation titles. Many games releasing on both previous-gen consoles and new-gen consoles feature some kind of quality or graphics mode that focuses more on the resolution and a performance mode that hones in on higher frame rates on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. Elden Ring featuring these two gameplay modes would make sense. 
However, FromSoftware has not officially announced such a thing and right now, the GameStop listing is the only indication that Elden Ring will have two gameplay modes. Hopefully, we’ll learn more about what’s in store for Elden Ring’s gameplay on new-gen consoles soon. Elden Ring hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on February 25. 
While waiting to learn more, check out the 15 minutes of Elden Ring gameplay FromSoftware released yesterday, and then check out the different editions of it you can pre-order now. Read Game Informer’s breakdown of everything we know about Elden Ring after that.

                    <span>Konami’s eFootball 1.0 launch has been delayed to next year, and the mobile versions of it have seemingly been delayed indefinitely. 
This news comes from a new blog post from Konami that details what’s going on with this iteration of eFootball. The team needs more time to develop the 1.0 update and squash bugs currently present in the current “demo” version of the game, which is what Konami refers to it at this point in time, as noted by IGN. 
“We would like to inform you that the v1.0.0 update for eFootball 2022, scheduled to be released on November 11, 2021, has been postponed until Spring 2022,” the blog post reads. “Also, we would like to announce the cancellation and automatic refunds of eFootball 2022 Premium Player Pack, which includes items that can only be used in-game after the v1.0.0 update.”
Konami says it has been working diligently towards distributing an update that will bring new content to the game, including a mode new to the series where players can “strengthen and play with an original team” and the mobile versions to the market. However, those mobile versions have seemingly been delayed indefinitely. 
“Unfortunately, we have concluded that more time is needed to deliver the product in the quality that will meet the expectations of our users and have decided to postpone the delivery,” the blog post reads. 
In the meantime, Konami ways it will release v0.9.1 to “fix numerous bugs sequentially on each platform” starting today, and that over time it will continue to improve and update eFootball 2022. Further updates and details about the mobile versions will come at a later date.

Call of Duty: Vanguard is a tale of three games. As is sometimes the case, several of the pillars lift up the package – and one brings it down. Vanguard’s campaign is weak, but multiplayer and zombies carry the title to victory. Let’s break down each experience.

                    <span>Love Story?
Ubisoft&#x27;s Just Dance returns once again to give us our annual dose of disco boogie action, and there&#x27;s absolutely zero surprises in Just Dance 2022 if you&#x27;ve ever played an entry in this series before. There&#x27;s a fairly solid bit of dance fun to be had with this one, but it&#x27;s also overwhelmingly familiar stuff that takes every opportunity it can to shove further purchases into your face. What&#x27;s here is good, there&#x27;s no doubt about it, but it&#x27;s all rendered somewhat frustrating as it constantly bombards you with tracks that you&#x27;ll need a Just Dance Unlimited subscription in order to access.
Let&#x27;s not get off to a hugely negative start here, though. Just Dance 2022 is a colourful and slick experience that arrives with 40 excellent tracks, some solid online action, a pretty neat kid-friendly mode, calorie-burning sweat mode and lots of unlockable bits and bobs to work towards acquiring as you thrash around your sitting room and attempt to match the movements displayed onscreen. All you need is a single Joy-Con (or a smartphone with the official app) and a reasonable sense of timing and you&#x27;re all set for some good times.

                    <span>Camel you believe it.
Listen — it probably seems a lot like everyone is making the same mistakes all over again with Animal Crossing: New Horizons&#x27; new content, by guzzling it all up within the first few days. Trust us, we know the feeling, especially when you have a job or responsibilities, and can&#x27;t keep up. (Admittedly, our job is literally to keep up with it, but we&#x27;re probably pretty unique in that.)
BUT. Having said that... We can all agree that buying from Saharah is a right pain in the hump, can&#x27;t we?

                    <span>puppuppu!
Christmas—or rather, Friday, November 5—came early yesterday when the long-awaited version 2.0 update to Animal Crossing: New Horizons was surprisingly released more than a full day ahead of schedule.
While much of the early hype surrounding the purportedly last major free content update focused on the return of Brewster and his café, much of the post-Direct hype focused on the return of Kapp’n and his boat.… Well, at least in this writer’s household.

                    <span>Did yours arrive this week?
While Metroid Dread is now a few weeks old, the amiibo that were intended to accompany its launch were unfortunately delayed in the UK and Europe, which means we&#x27;ve had to wait a little longer to get our grubby hands on them.
The good news, as you can see from the images on this very page, is that they&#x27;re rather fetching. We particularly like the design of the Samus amiiibo, and the way in which the base is furnished with the iconic &#x27;Screw Attack&#x27; emblem which has since become the series&#x27; logo. The sinister E.M.M.I. amiibo is impressive, too, and looms over Samus just as it so often does in the game itself. Oo-er.

                    <span>The eShop&#x27;s biggest games.
Nintendo has shared an updated list of Europe&#x27;s most-downloaded Switch eShop games, revealing which titles were the most popular during October 2021.
Likely coming as very little surprise indeed, Nintendo&#x27;s own Metroid Dread and Mario Party Superstars have taken the top two spots this time around. They lead a list made up of popular Nintendo-published games and well-known third-party hits.

                    <span>They&#x27;ll thank you for it.
Among the many new features included in yesterday&#x27;s Version 2.0.0 update in Animal Crossing: New Horizons is the addition of Villager visits, where Villagers either invite you round to their house for a nice chat and a game of cards, or come to visit you in your own home.
Seeing your Villagers walking around your home for the first time, judging every decoration decision you&#x27;ve made before casually flopping down in the middle of your living room to read a book, can feel a little surreal, but it sure is nice to have some company. Well, unless your house is full of cockroaches, at least.

Animal Crossing may well be taking up all the headlines thanks to its shiny new update and DLC pack out today, but don&#x27;t forget that a brand new variant of the Nintendo Switch Lite has also arrived on the market.
Yes, the special Pokémon Dialga &amp; Palkia Edition Switch Lite is now available to buy at select retailers worldwide. You don&#x27;t need us to tell you that the console would be the perfect system to couple with Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, which are launching for Switch in two weeks&#x27; time on the 19th.

                    <span>Choose your character.
There are a lot of big releases next year, but the biggest release of all might be YOUR FIST in SOMEONE&#x27;S FACE. Not in real life, please — Nintendo Life does not condone violence unless it&#x27;s in fighting games — but in Phantom Breaker: Omnia, which we&#x27;ve got some lovely exclusive footage of right here. Or, well, up there. It&#x27;s above this paragraph.
Phantom Breaker: Omnia is a remake of the original Japan-only 2D anime fighting game, Phantom Breaker, which came out on Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 in 2011. It was announced for Switch last year, with an all-new English dub, new characters and balance adjustments. The English voice cast includes SungWon Cho, Matthew Mercer, and plenty of the voices from anime dubs of well-known anime like JoJo&#x27;s Bizarre Adventure, Aggretsuko, and My Hero Academia.

                    <span>Initiatives beyond standard R&amp;D costs.
Throughout the Switch generation Nintendo has benefitted from a lucrative period of sustained profits, putting it in a distinctly &#x27;cash-rich&#x27; position. In its most recent financial reports presentation it&#x27;s now outlined bold plans to invest significant amounts of money in three key areas.
It&#x27;s important to note that this money is in addition to standard investment in areas such as research &amp; development, so it&#x27;s a real sign of intent on the company&#x27;s part. We&#x27;ve broken it down below.

                    <span>Yawn of the Dead?
Saber Interactive&#x27;s World War Z is the very definition of a bland, middle-of-the-road game that takes very obvious inspiration from much better titles – in this case the Left 4 Dead series – and serves up a rather lazy rehash, excelling at nothing in particular while still providing a reasonably breezy good time, so long as you&#x27;ve got a couple of friends at hand to plough through its campaign with.
There&#x27;s really nothing that surprises or delights here, as you (and up to three other players) bound around the globe in a five hour campaign that takes in locations such as New York City, Jerusalem, Moscow and Tokyo. It&#x27;s all perfectly serviceable stuff; hold off waves of zombies here, escort a bus there, mow through millions of cannon fodder, braindead enemies and level-up as you go. It&#x27;s on a par with the uber-bland Brad Pitt movie of the same name and, rather foolishly, abandons the lore of the original Max Brooks book – lore which could have really helped to infuse this sterile world with just a little more in the way of character.

Gyroids are BACK, baby — and for people who&#x27;ve played Animal Crossing games before, we&#x27;ve already experienced all the emotions that gyroids make us feel. First, confusion: What do they do? Then, horror: Why are they buried? Then, curiosity: Let&#x27;s put one in my house, followed swiftly by amusement (or horror again) when they start making noises.
But for anyone who&#x27;s new to Animal Crossing: New Horizons, you might have a few questions about how to get these weird little guys into your life!

The first trailer for E4&#x27;s GamesMaster reboot has just gone live, and it gives a good taste of what to expect from the series.
Hosted by Rob Florence and starring the legendary Sir Trevor McDonald as the titular GamesMaster, the series has been filmed at the iconic Crossness Pumping Station in London, and seems to follow the format of the original seasons pretty closely.

                    <span>Dnes Intel vydal již 12. generaci svých procesorů Core a názvem Alder Lake. Server Phoronix otestoval výkon procesorů Core i5 12600K a Core i9 12900K v Linuxu. Procesory mají hybridní architekturu s malými a velkými jádry. Velká jádra Golden Cove mají HT, kdežto malá jádra Gracemont ne. Procesor 12600K má 6 velkých a 4 malá jádra, dohromady 16 vláken a procesor 12900K má 8 velkých a 8 malých jader, dohromady 24 vláken. Nejzajímavější je porovnání s vlajkovou lodí AMD Ryzen 9 5950X, která má 16 HT jader a 32 vláken.</span>

                    <span>A good puzzle is one of the best things in life. Some are relaxing time-killers, while others test our skills in critical problem solving or quick mental gymnastics; both can be incredibly satisfying. Video games can elevate these head-scratching problems to new heights and complexities by immersing you in a setting, messing with concepts like the tenants of time and space, or by simply giving you endless access to your favorite brainteasers. Here are some of our favorite modern puzzle games listed in no particular order, that you can play right now that will pleasantly twist your brain into knots.

Gold-foil covers. Uniquely numbered issues. High-gloss pages. This is Game Informer Gold: The same video game magazine you know and love printed on ridiculously high-quality paper. We&#x27;ve been working on making this high-end variant for over a year and are finally ready to reveal it.
Each edition of Game Informer Gold is limited with a small print run. Much like prized comic books, each copy is bagged and boarded. You may even get a hand-written note from me in the box it&#x27;s shipped in.
We are auctioning off the first copy of Game Informer Gold during our 25-hour Extra Life Livestream on November 6. The auction begins at 4 p.m. CT and all money goes to Children&#x27;s Miracle Network Hospitals.
Want to get your hands on a copy? We plan to reveal more details about Game Informer Gold&#x27;s availability in the weeks and months ahead. Stay tuned to Game Informer&#x27;s social channels for that information.
I know you hear this often, but you need to get your hands on Game Informer Gold to truly understand how big of an upgrade it is. From its increased thickness to the gold shine on the cover, this is as high-end as magazines get.

In the months ahead, we plan on creating limited Gold editions for each issue. We may also reprint back issues with the Gold treatment. Here&#x27;s a cool twist: Some of these issues (new and old) could feature never-before-seen alternate artwork on the covers, perhaps from some of the world&#x27;s most celebrated artists.
We&#x27;re going to have some fun with Game Informer Gold, and we can&#x27;t wait for you to get your hands on an issue!</span>

                    <span>Spider-Man is finally arriving in Marvel’s Avengers later this month. Specifically, he&#x27;s coming to the PlayStation versions of the game – he’s an exclusive character, after all. But even non-PlayStation owners will be treated to a substantial update that adds a new Raid, power cap increase, and a perhaps friendlier method of unlocking cosmetics. 
November 30 is the big day that patch 2.2 hits the game. Spider-Man arrives in the Great Power Hero Event. The story centers on Peter Parker uncovering a mysterious threat and joining up with the Avengers to prevent AIM from procuring powerful technology. Although Spidey struggles with working as part of a team, he manages to form bonds with Ms. Marvel and Black Widow (despite insisting on maintaining his secret identity). The crux of the campaign…</span>

                    <span>Adorable 2009 platformer A Boy And His Blob hops over to Switch today. 
First released for the Wii, the game is a remake of the NES cult classic A Boy and His Blob: Trouble on Blobolonia. Players control the titular boy, with the help of his shape-shifting blob companion, to solve 2D platforming puzzles. Feeding the Blob jellybeans turns it into 15 different objects ranging from a parachute, anvil, or cannon. The game’s best feature: you can hug the Blob anytime.

A Boy and His Blob has since become a cult favorite in its own right. We scored the original Wii release an 8 out of 10. In her review, former GI editor Meagan Marie wrote that “...there is something undeniably magnetic about the game. The lush environments, charming characters, and the infinite power of the hug button make it impossible to stay upset for too long.” Over the last decade, it’s been ported to PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC, and mobile devices. 
You can purchase A Boy and His Blob for $14.99 on the Switch eShop. The port is being handled by Ziggurat Interactive, which is also gearing up to release enhanced versions of the BloodRayne games on consoles.</span>

                    <span>League of Legends Champion Jinx is the latest skin soon to be added to Fortnite. 
Riot Games and Epic Games announced the team-up that brings Jinx to the battle royale today, and it marks the first time a League of Legends champion has ever been featured in a non-Riot game. Jinx will also be the main character in Netflix and Riot’s upcoming Arcane: League of Legends animated series, which premieres on November 6 at 10 p.m. EST on Netlflix and Twitch. 
The Jinx skin won’t be the only Jinx-themed item available for purchase in the Fortnite Item Shop. Here’s everything you can buy starting today at 8 p.m. EST: 
Arcane Jinx Outfit
Pow Pow Crusher Pickaxe
Jinxed Spray
Jinx’s Dream Monkey Back Bling

Alongside news of the addition of Jinx in Fortnite, Riot Games has revealed that League of Legends, Teamfight Tactics, League of Legends Runeterra, and Valorant are being added to the Epic Games Store. 
“Riot Games is one of the world’s best developers and creators of groundbreaking entertainment franchises,” Epic Games Store vice president Steve Allison writes in the press release. “We’re excited they’ve chosen to partner with us to bring their titles to millions of new players through the Epic Games Store.”
While waiting for Jinx to hit the Fortnite Item Shop tonight, read about how Riot is celebrating its upcoming Arcane series through the month of November.

                    <span>Take-Two Interactive has reportedly canceled a $53 million game that was being developed by Hangar 13. 
This news comes by way of Bloomberg, which reports that “people familiar with the decision” have learned that “further development of an unannounced title in its pipeline” has ended. Codenamed Volt, this game had reportedly gone through multiple iterations since first being conceived but ultimately, what led to its cancellation was the repeated “reboots, technological hiccups, and challenges caused by COVID-19,” Bloomberg reports. 
Volt’s development began in 2017, and it was set to be centered around various superheroes competing against each other. It would have featured an emphasis on online gameplay. 
“It was set to be a new intellectual property for Hangar 13, but 2K executives didn’t see it as a worthwhile investment because of the amount of time needed in development before it became a finished product,” Bloomberg’s report reads. 
There have been no layoffs as a result of this at the time of this writing, and Bloomberg reports that Hangar 13 employees will meet Thursday in Novata, California, where the studio is based, to discuss what happens next. 
Bloomberg writer Jason Schreier, who wrote this report, tweeted out additional details about the canceled project and those affected. He said Hangar 13 staff in California learned today via email that Volt was canceled, and he also noted that some non-US staff members learned of this news from his report. 
Schreier also said this canceled game was not Mafia 4, which some thought Hangar 13 was developing according to rumors. He said Mafia 4 rumors “were always false, aside from their early attempts in 2016-2017.”

                    <span>Halo has always had some great collector’s editions with each new release – looking at you, Master Chief helmet that came with Halo 3 – and Walmart sort of surprise announced a new one for Halo Infinite overnight. As expected, it sold out immediately. 
As far as special editions of Halo Infinite goes, there’s the Halo Infinite Xbox Series X bundle, the special steelbook that comes with preorders in select locations, and that’s about it. Before today, we hadn’t yet seen a special Halo Infinite edition that comes with what’s usually expected i.e. a statue of some kind, maybe some patches or stickers, and an art book. 
It seems Walmart had the lock on that because overnight, it released the Halo Infinite Collector’s Edition for $169.99. It sold out near immediately. It features the game, of course, a steelbook case (the same one being sold by other retailers), a set of five patches, a Plasma Pistol replica bottle opener, an Energy Sword desk lamp, two lanyards, a mini art book, a desktop portfolio, and a special developer note. 
According to Walmart, this edition was limited to just 10,000 units and now, it’s sold out. It’s unclear if more Collector’s Editions will be released. It’s also important to note that oddly enough, neither Microsoft nor Xbox have mentioned this edition yet. 
Perhaps it’s an unofficial one made by Walmart, although that would be odd considering it comes with some very official-looking merchandise. Maybe Walmart jumped the gun and released it early. All we know is that we’re very sad we were sleeping while this went live. 
For more about Halo Infinite, check out this story about Craig the Brute’s glow-up of the year and then read about how 343 Industries used Halo 3 and Halo Reach as inspiration for Infinite’s character and enemy design. Check out Game Informer’s breakdown of everything we know about Halo Infinite after that.

                    <span>FromSoftware showed off 15 minutes of Elden Ring gameplay this morning, and also revealed a pair of snazzy special editions at the presentation&#x27;s conclusion. Those who want more swag for their buck can pre-order these bad boys now. 
First up is the Collector’s Edition, which includes the following goodies:
Elden Ring game
Malenia – Blade of Miquella statue (23 cm)
Exclusive steelbook
40-page hardback artbook
Digital soundtrack
The Premium Collector’s Edition includes everything in the Collector’s Edition but tosses in a 1:1 replica of Malenia’s helmet, which may or may not be big enough to wear. Check it out below. 
The Collector’s Edition will set you back $189.99. The Premium Edition briefly appeared for $229.99 on Bandai Namco&#x27;s website but is a bit tough to track down right now. You&#x27;ll have to pre-order from retailers fast to grab one before they&#x27;re just a memory. You can try your luck at Best Buy, Target, and GameStop (disclaimer: GameStop is the parent company of Game Informer). 
Elden Ring releases February 25 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

                    <span>FromSoftware has released 15 minutes of Elden Ring gameplay and it features some of its open-world traversal in The Land Between, Souls-like combat, a healthy amount of death, and a look at some of the dungeons that await players within. 
The entire showcase heavily emphasizes player choice when navigating the world of Elden Ring. Unlike previous FromSoftware games which are more akin to wide-open, interconnected areas rather than a full-on open-world, Elden Ring’s world is completely open, allowing players to tackle objectives how they see fit.

                    <span>More Than 5 million copies of Grand Theft Auto V – you know, the game released nearly a decade ago – were sold just last quarter, bringing its total units sold up to a whopping 155 million units. 
This news comes by way of VentureBeat, which reports that the Rockstar-developed open-world game has generated more than $6 billion in revenue since its 2013 release. GTAV became the most profitable entertainment product of all time three years ago in 2018, as reported by GamesIndustry.biz, and it seems like the game has no plans to give up that title anytime soon. 
These new GTAV numbers come from Take-Two Interactive’s latest financial report, which details the second fiscal quarter’s earnings. That quarter ended on September 30. According to VentureBeat, the company beat not only Wall Street’s…</span>

                    <span>The classic and punishing Shin Megami Tensei franchise is back with a new mainline entry, and it’s full of everything we’ve come to expect from the series: challenging battles, intense demon negotiations, and philosophical conundrums about the state of the world. I’ve been playing Shin Megami Tensei V, already clocking close to 40 hours, but I haven’t reached the end to deliver my final verdict. Until then, I’ll say: Shin Megami Tensei sticks close to its roots – for better or worse. This means common series complaints, such as poor navigation and obtuse instructions, remain, but Atlus has also enhanced certain aspects, with more expansive areas, more skill customization, and stellar demon designs. If you’re an SMT fan, you should feel at home with the long, hard-fought journey that awaits…</span>

                    <span>The new wireless Nintendo 64 controller sold out almost immediately and it’s now not expected to be available for sale again until 2022, but if you’re one of the lucky people that nabbed one, you can now play Super Mario 64 on Switch with it. 
This news comes by way of Nintendo, which announced that Version 1.1.1 is out for Super Mario 3D All-Stars, which is the collection released last year that features Super Mario 64, Super Mario Sunshine, and Super Mario Galaxy. Before this new update, you could only play these three games using Joy-Con or the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller.

That’s still the case for Super Mario Sunshine and Super Mario Galaxy, but thanks to Version 1.1.1., you can now play Super Mario 64 with Nintendo’s recently-released 64 controller. Joy-Con and the Pro controller work fine in Super Mario 64, but for those looking for a more classic and nostalgic feel, using the 64 controller while playing is sure to fit their fancy. 
While waiting for the 64 controllers to be in stock again, check out why one of Game Informer’s editors thinks Super Mario 3D All-Stars is a great collection of remasters that doesn’t quite go far enough and then read about how Nintendo stopped selling this collection after March 31, 2021. Check out our thoughts on the latest 3D Mario game released in Game Informer’s Super Mario 3D World + Bowser’s Fury review after that.

It&#x27;s that time of year again. A new entry in the Call of Duty series is nearly here, and with its release comes the familiar questions of whether or not fans should pick up the latest entry in the annualized series. We set out to answer that question on these fresh episodes of New Gameplay Today, focused on Call of Duty: Vanguard&#x27;s zombie and campaign modes!
It is important to keep in mind what is going on within Activision Blizzard at this time regarding ongoing allegations about the work culture. The ongoing lawsuit from the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) against the company is over reported toxic workplace culture.

                    <span>Yacht Club Games has announced that Shovel Knight Dig will be released in 2022. 
Dig was announced way back in August of 2019 as a new take on the massively popular Shovel Knight character. It still features the Shovel Knight millions have come to love over the years, but Dig drops the classic 2D platformer feel for a more unique style of gameplay that draws on titles like Mr. Driller and Dig Dug.

While a release date for Dig was never announced, it seems Yacht Club had 2021 in mind considering they announced today that Dig needs more time and will be released next year.

                    <span>Nintendo has dropped some new sales numbers for its latest console, the Nintendo Switch, as well as the top 10 best-selling Switch games. 
It’s no surprise the Switch is doing well – its sales haven’t really let up since the hybrid console hit the market in March of 2017. Still, it’s already one of Nintendo’s best-selling consoles and currently in fourth place in the company’s entire platform lineup. The latest numbers released by Nintendo today take all sales through September 30, 2021, into account and the Switch sits at 92.87 million units sold.

That number places the Switch far ahead of the NES, SNES, Nintendo 64, GameCube, Game Boy Advance, the 3DS, and the Wii U. In fact, the only four consoles ahead of it are the Wii at 101.63 million units sold…</span>

Since the spin-off series’ inception, Forza Horizon’s approachable and exciting racing action has appealed to a broad audience. Forza Horizon 5 continues this tradition of delivering stellar driving mechanics within a gorgeous destination, this time taking players to Mexico for one of the best, most expansive racing games I’ve ever played.
Driving through Mexico in Forza Horizon 5 is an utter delight thanks to superb, dynamic driving mechanics that consider the terrain, weather, and handling of the more than 500 vehicles you drive. Forza Horizon 5 aptly demonst…</span>

                    <span>Previous generations worried that humanity would be hurried towards its demise by nuclear war. My fear is that our destruction will be brought about by FIFA players opening Ultimate Team packs to &quot;earn&quot; NFTs. 

Yes, EA CEO Andrew Wilson followed in Ubisoft&#x27;s footsteps by saying that he thought NFTs and play-to-earn would be &quot;an important part of the future of our industry.&quot;

                    <span>Like many people, I became a plant guy during the pandemic. I don&#x27;t know the names of the plants, I don&#x27;t know what they need except sporadic watering and moderate light, but they&#x27;re green and I like them.

The Sims 4&#x27;s Blooming Rooms kit feels designed for me. It&#x27;s one of Maxis&#x27;s new micro-DLCs, and it lets you pack rooms with flora without the need to keep the alive through knowledge or effort.

That&#x27;s all of Riot&#x27;s games, in case you were wondering, which have previously been solely available on PC via their own launcher. At the same time, League Of Legends hero Jinx is hopping into Fortnite.

                    <span>Hey podcast fans. Mum’s away this week, which means the inmates have taken over the asylum once again. The temptation was to play another round of Sweeten The Deal, but instead Nate and I were good little podcast boys and delivered a surprisingly on point discussion of our favourite videogame adaptations of literary works. Well, I say ‘on point’; there’s a fair amount of discussion of new Dune, too, which is what got us thinking about successful book to screen journeys. Sadly, the House Atreides bagpipe band were not available for a rousing rendition of the podcast theme.
There’s also a micro Cavern of Lies in which things get biblical.

                    <span>A new update hit New World today, aimed partially at cracking down on gold sellers and exploits used to duplicate items and cash. Amazon say they&#x27;ve banned many players who were spamming chat advertising their illicit services. They also blasted a blog post talking about many of the issues concerning players, explaining things, detailing plans for fixes, and other welcome news.

                    <span>Want to know which are the best guns in Call Of Duty: Vanguard? Recent Call Of Duty games have among the most complex weapon meta of any FPS games, thanks both to the sheer number of weapons and the absurd number of attachments you can use to customise each gun. Call Of Duty: Vanguard continues this trend in a big way, with 27 primary and 9 secondary weapons that you can unlock, customise, and experiment with.
We fully expect Call Of Duty: Vanguard&#x27;s weapon meta to evolve quickly with future updates and balance patches, but at the moment there is definitely a top tier of guns which have risen above the rest in effectiveness. Below we&#x27;ll walk you through the very best guns in the game and how to get the most power out of each one.

                    <span>I’ll admit I misjudged Forza Horizon 5 – not just the extent to which I’d enjoy it, but how much its searingly shiny visuals could justify the significantly heightened PC requirements. Well, lock me in one of this game’s hundreds of boots and take me away, because it’s both tonnes of fun and genuinely, magnificently gorgeous. Here’s how Forza Horizon 5 runs on PC, and which settings to tweak if you want a performance boost without cutting too deep into that top-notch fidelity.

                    <span>From Software and Bandai Namco have treated us to a new Elden Ring gameplay trailer, which showed off 15 glorious minutes of exploration. All I wanted was one laugh and I got it, from a rotund POT-BOY at that. Plus, it was narrated by a guy who sounded suspiciously like SoulsTuber VaatiVidya as the Tarnished trotted and fought and summoned and stealthed. Undoubtedly a showstopper of a trailer, but the higlight for me was how good the action sounded. And boy, it sounded good didn&#x27;t it?

Bloodborne PSX turns FromSoft&#x27;s gothic action-RPG into a low-poly spookfest, complete with crackly old sound effects and 16-bit music.

                    <span>Darkest Dungeon 2, the sequel to Red Hook Studio&#x27;s gothic roguelike, is a somewhat familiar affair. It&#x27;s dark, it&#x27;s tough, and a narrator likes to remind you of those things frequently. But this time around, we&#x27;re leaving the Ancestor&#x27;s squalid hamlet behind, and swapping it out for a stress-fueled stagecoach. Heroes are no longer cannon-fodder to send out on doomed expeditions, but vital team members who have stories to share and relationships to forge. 


I recently talked with creative director Chris Bourassa and design director Tyler Sigman about why they decided to take the game in this new direction, the difficulties of switching to a relationship-based affliction system, and why they&#x27;re excited to be working in early access again.

Trade Skills are non-combat skills in New World — just about any activity your character takes part in that isn&#x27;t tied to their weapons is linked to a Trade Skill. There are 17 of these skills in all, separated into three sub-categories: Gathering, Refining, and Crafting.

                    <span>Lost Ark is a free-to-play action RPG-inspired MMO that came out to great acclaim in Korea back in 2018. Now, Amazon Games are bringing its flashy, Diablo-like combat to the west in the form of a closed beta later today, and we&#x27;ve had an early sneak peek at it. Of course, what with Amazon&#x27;s own MMO New World now settling into its third month, not to mention Final Fantasy 14&#x27;s Endwalker expansion looming on the horizon, Lost Ark arrives at a busy time for fervent EXP grinders. The big question, then, is whether Lost Ark’s Diablo-y formula can do enough to compete with the already well-established MMO juggernauts. Judging by my few hours of hands-on time, I’m thinking it might, but only if you’re able to embrace its slow burn.

For main course, folks who buy it within a week of launch will get the Ogre Kingdoms DLC for free. And for dessert, it will be in Xbox Game Pass For PC. A fair meal, there.

It will present you with some of your fave maps from the likes of Bad Company 2 and the Battlefields of old, then let you tweak them as much as you please by adding various vehicles, rules and more. I&#x27;m personally hoping to see plenty of oldies with 2042&#x27;s sweet new grappling hook thrown in. Every map could be improved by a grappling hook.

                    <span>By now you’ve probably heard about how Intel’s 12th Gen Alder Lake CPUs shake up the previously stagnant Core line. Led by this, the Intel Core i9-12900K, Alder Lake sees the adoption of a hybrid architecture that combines high-power Performance cores (P-cores) with Efficiency cores (E-cores) that can free up headroom by taking on background tasks. The Core i9-12900K takes this opportunity to bulk up, combining eight P-cores and E-cores apiece for a total of 16 cores and 24 threads.

                    <span>The Intel Core i5-12600K is, in some ways, the CPU that Intel should have made three or four years ago. Ever since AMD’s Ryzen chips appeared with an alluring balance of gaming speed, desktop multitasking performance, efficiency, and affordability, Intel seemed to sink into a comfort zone of simply raising clock speeds and maybe adding a few cores. 


This was often enough to earn some half-throated recommendations for gaming builds specifically, but this past year proved that something needed to change, with the AMD Ryzen 5 5600X claiming the best gaming CPU title and 11th Gen Rocket Lake Intel chips – like the 5600X’s rival Core i5-11600K – looking thoroughly skippable. For those who did decide to wait until the 12th Gen Alder Lake launch, consider yourselves vindicated, as the Core i5-12600K is a great all-rounder: both a Ryzen-beater in games and, thanks to a long-overdue architecture revamp, a drastically better general purpose processor.

                    <span>Last night, Take-Two Interactive&#x27;s quarterly earnings report mentioned a $53 million (£39 million) &quot;impairment charge&quot;, related to their decision to cease development on an unannounced project. According to a number of reports, that project was a third-person action game from Mafia 3 developers Hangar 13 that would&#x27;ve featured superheroes and online play.

After talking to the Worldmind in chapter 9, you will have the option to pay the Nova Corps fine that you incurred after escaping the Quarantine Zone and running into the Hala’s Hope in Chapter 2. Some decisions can have large and unexpected consequences in Guardians Of The Galaxy, so a bit of foresight is worth having if you want the best outcome when deciding whether to pay the Nova Corps fine or not.

                    <span>XCOM studio Firaxis have announced a delay for Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns, their turn-based tactics game in the BAM! BIF! POW! world of Marvel superheroes. Previously due in March 2022, it&#x27;s now pushed back into the second half of 2022. I say &quot;previously&quot;; the game was only announced two months ago. Sounds like someone had a serious rethink about the state of the project. But if it needs the time, it&#x27;s good that it&#x27;s getting the time.

After a rather disappointing attempt to capture a monster from the Quarantine Zone, the Guardians Of The Galaxy will incur a large fine from the Nova Corps. In a dire attempt to scrape together some units, you must travel to Seknarf Nine to meet Lady Hellbender, the Monster Queen. When you arrive, you must choose whether to sell Rocket or Groot. The choice you make majorly impacts the next mission of your adventure, so we’ll walk you through the differences between the two.

                    <span>EA Sports PGA Tour won’t be hitting the green next Spring as promised. EA has announced its upcoming return to golf will arrive at a later date. 
When exactly? That’s not entirely clear. EA Sports PGA Tour never had a concrete release date, but EA’s statement simply states its shifting the launch to a later time and that it will tell us more about it later. The full statement reads as follows:
Hey golf fans, we wanted to let you know that we are shifting the launch date of EA Sports PGA Tour. We’re excited to bring championship golf to you and will be providing more information on our launch plans in the coming months.

EA Sports PGA Tour represents the publisher’s comeback to golf after a years-long hiatus. The game already boasts exclusive rights to the Master’s Tournament and features the PGA Championship, U.S. Open Championship, and The Open Championship. The game will also highlight the Ladies Professional Golf Association (LPGA) and feature one of their respective tournaments, the Amundi Evian Championship.
In other recent delay news, Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns was pushed to the back half of 2022, Platinum Games&#x27; arcade shooter Sol Cresta will now launch next year, and both Overwatch 2 and Diablo IV may not arrive until 2023 at the earliest.

                    <span>One of the most exciting things that can happen in gaming is the announcement of that sequel or spiritual successor you’ve been begging for. There’s no shortage of those kinds of announcements these days, but sometimes those announcements can feel like mistakes, particularly when a game is nowhere near ready. 
Sure, the hype is exciting, but there’s no real purpose to announcing a game years and years ahead of time other than marketing, of course. If a game enters what’s informally known as development hell, that announcement can sting a lot, both for the studio behind it and the fans excited about it.

                    <span>Square Enix has released its annual report for its 2021 fiscal year, which reflected on the games released during the initial months of the COVID pandemic. Marvel&#x27;s Avengers is revealed in the report to be considered &quot;not proven successful,&quot; though lessons were learned from the project.
Taking on a Games as a Service (or GaaS) model, Marvel&#x27;s Avengers was described as an &quot;ambitious title&quot; for Square Enix. The complications that come with planning for the long tail of a service-focused title with the shift to developers working from home compounded the challenges. &quot;We were able to surmount these challenges and release the game, but it has unfortunately not proven as successful as we would have liked,&quot; says Square Enix President Yosuke Matsuda in the report.

                    <span>Firaxis has announced that its superhero strategy game, Marvel’s Midnight Suns, won’t make its March release window. The game requires some more polish, so it will instead launch during the back half of 2022. A more exact date was not provided.
The studio tweeted a statement by creative director Jake Solomon explaining the delay. Simply put, the game needs more time in the oven to come together, and four months from now won’t be enough. “These extra months will be used to add more story, cinematics, and overall polish and will be essential in helping us make our vision a reality,” reads Solomon’s statement. You can read the full announcement in the tweet below.
We have an important development update to share with our fans pic.twitter.com/ycNDCVtbwD
November 3, 2021
Marvel’s Midnight Suns blends turn-based and deck-building gameplay with a story based on the ‘90s Midnight Sons story and team. Players control The Hunter, an original hero created by Marvel and Firaxis, who leads a team consisting of Doctor Strange, Blade, Captain America, Wolverine, Magik, and others against the evil Lilith. We recently featured it on the cover of Game Informer, and you can read deep-dive articles breaking down every facet of the game’s features and development in our coverage hub.
When it does launch, Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.</span>

                    <span>If you thought buying a Nintendo Switch was tough over this past year, that challenge is not going to let up anytime soon. 
That’s because Nintendo will be making 20% fewer Switch consoles than expected through March, according to a new report from Nikkei Asia. The 20% reduction translates to roughly 6 million fewer Switch consoles, as Nintendo originally planned to manufacture and ship 30 million Switch units by March. Nikkei Asia reports that the planned number has been reduced to 24 million.

As you might expect, the reason for this reduction in production is chips, or rather, the ongoing shortage of chips. The same chip shortage that has made buying video cards, new vehicles, PlayStation 5s, and Xbox Series X/S consoles is the same shortage affectin…</span>

                    <span>Honor of Kings, the extremely popular mobile MOBA, is getting a live-service, open-world spinoff game called Honor of Kings: World. 
This news comes by way of Kotaku, which reports that World will be following in the vein of Genshin Impact. It will have live-service components, a global launch, and locales and a narrative based on or at least inspired by Chinese mythology.

The new trailer, which launched over the weekend, features a gorgeous and flashy open world significantly more open than that seen in Honor of Kings...which makes sense considering Honor of Kings: World is meant to be an open world title. As noted by Kotaku, World will likely end up being massive – its MOBA predecessor, Honor of Kings, is one of the biggest games in the world, surpassing over 100 million daily players in 2020. 
It doesn’t hurt that it has Chinese entertainment conglomerate Tencent’s backing, too. Tencent originally wanted to make a mobile version of League of Legends, but Riot Games passed on it and so Honor of Kings was made by TiMi Studio instead. 
Similar to Genshin Impact, World appears to be a third-person action-RPG set in a fantastical world filled with different towns and cities, NPCs, enemies, and more. A release date for World has not been announced, but a worldwide launch is planned for multiple platforms, presumably PlayStation, Xbox, mobile, and PC platforms. 
While waiting to learn more about Honor of Kings: World, check out our thoughts on Genshin Impact in Game Informer’s Genshin Impact review and then read about how it&#x27;s celebrating its first anniversary.

                    <span>After spending years in Early Access, the beautiful survival game Among Trees is ready for prime time. Developer FJRD Interactive announced today that the game will officially launch on November 10 for PC.
Among Trees was first revealed during The Game Awards in 2018 and launched in Early Access in June 2020. Set in a scenic, living forest, your task is to gather materials and food to survive. You’ll chop down trees to build a cabin, which you can upgrade by adding new rooms to unlock cooking, crafting, sewing, and gardening. Speaking of that last mechanic, you can construct an entire greenhouse to grow food to consume raw or use as ingredients for recipes. You can also build a hydration system and even a brewery.

The gorgeous world includes forests and caves. As peaceful as it looks, it’s not without its dangers. Predators such as bears roam its landscape, which you’ll need to avoid to prevent a The Revenant situation. If that’s too much excitement for your blood, a peaceful Zen mode allows you to enjoy Among Trees’ laid-back vibe without killer animals breathing down your neck. On the friendlier side, you can adopt and train a fox companion to help you locate valuable resources. 
FJRD says it plans to continue bug fixing throughout the year. Other than that, don’t expect any new significant features or content. After spending five years working on Among Trees, the team is excited for it to go 1.0 and begin transitioning to other projects. 
Among Trees will be available on Steam and the Epic Games Store for $14.99.</span>

                    <span>In early October, Xbox and Adidas partnered up to create a cool sneaker commemorating the 20th anniversary of the console. The downside: the shoe wasn’t for sale and could only be won in a contest. Fortunately for gamers and sneakerheads, the two companies are at it again, creating another console-inspired sneaker that you can purchase the old-fashioned way. 
Dubbed the Xbox 360 Forum Mid, the shoe draws aesthetic inspiration from, you guessed it, the Xbox 360. Like the original version of the console, the sneaker sports a predominantly white look with silver and lime-green accents. Eagle-eyed fans will notice the strap resembles the 360’s disc tray. The heel has elements referencing the removable hard drive and memory unit slots. These easter eggs are largely subtle; the Xbox button on the sides of the shoe is the only dead giveaway you’re wearing a console on your feet. The sneaker also comes with four extra laces in red, yellow, green, and blue. I’m sure you can guess the significance of those colors.

The Xbox 360 Forum Mid is a limited edition release. To snag a pair, you’ll need to visit adidas.com at 7 a.m. Pacific/10 a.m. Eastern on November 4 (tomorrow) and have $160.00 ready to spend. The shoe will only be sold in the U.S. and Canada.

                    <span>Elden Ring’s February release date is coming fast, and tomorrow, FromSoftware will showcase 15 minutes of gameplay. 
Any FromSoftware fan knows the struggle that has been anticipating Elden Ring – it was announced over two years ago during E3 2019, and after that, things went quiet. Then, information began to leak, such as concept art and a mysterious trailer. Finally, earlier this Summer, we got an extended look at Elden Ring and a January 2022 release date. The last morsel of news after that came last month when FromSoftware announced that Elden Ring had been delayed to February 25 and that closed network tests would happen this month. 
Now, it seems FromSoftware is ready to show some more of Elden Ring’s mysterious world. Tomorrow, the studio will release a “15-minute glimpse” of gameplay at 7 a.m. PDT/10 a.m. EST. 
Join us for a 15-minute glimpse of #ELDENRING gameplay on November 4th at 3 PM CET/7 AM PDT

November 3, 2021
As for what to expect, it’s anybody’s guess at this point, but 15 minutes is a meaty chunk of gameplay. We’ll likely see some of the horseback traversal featured in the game, some of its unique combat, and if one thing is certain, a horrific boss fight that will have everyone shaking in their armored boots. 
Only time will tell. Elden Ring will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on February 25. 
For more about it, read about how Elden Ring features a map and fast travel, and then check out this story about how the Moonlight Greatsword might be in the game. Read Game Informer’s breakdown of everything we know about Elden Ring after that.

                    <span>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate director Masahiro Sakurai isn’t thinking about a sequel Smash Bros. game, but he’s also not ruling one out...for now. 
Sakurai only just revealed Ultimate’s final fighter, Sora from Kingdom Hearts, last month and after over three years of DLC development, it was presumed that Sakurai would take a well-earned rest. It seems he’s doing that, but it hasn’t stopped him from speculating on the future of the Smash Bros. series.
In an issue of Japanese magazine Famitsu, Sakurai said he’s not currently thinking about a sequel to Ultimate, as reported by Video Games Chronicle. 
“I’m not thinking about a sequel,” Sakurai said to Famitsu. “But I can’t say that this is definitely the last Smash Bros.” 
Sakurai famously speculates on the future of Smash Bros. following the re…</span>

                    <span>Platinum Games’ vertical shoot ‘em up, Sol Cresta, which is a resurrection of a series over 30 years old, has been delayed.
This news comes by way of Platinum Games’ “Sol Cresta: Hideki Kamiya’s Very Sorry Stream,” which aired today, as reported by Eurogamer. The stream featured new gameplay of Sol Cresta, but Platinum&#x27;s chief game designer, Kamiya, also revealed that it would miss its December release date.

Kamiya said he does not have a new release date to reveal just yet, but he hopes to announce it early next year. 
Back when Sol Cresta was announced, it was revealed as a successor to Moon Cresta and Terra Cresta, vertical-scrolling arcade games originally developed by Nichibutsu. Sol Cresta will follow in the footsteps of previous Cresta games in that it will feature spaceships flying through galaxies, taking out enemies, and more in classic vertical-shooter arcade fashion. It will also allow players to dock with allies, just like the original games did nearly 40 years ago. 
At the time of Sol Cresta’s announcement back in August, Kamiya said “we want to make all kinds of games...not just action games.” Platinum Games is perhaps best known for what it does on the action side of gaming – Nier Automata, Astral Chain, Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance, to name a few – but it seems the studio is using Sol Cresta to prove it can do vertical shooters, too. 
As noted by Eurogamer, Kamiya’s stream featured gameplay of Sol Cresta’s new Caravan Mode, which is a five-minute score attack mode. Kamiya also debuted its opening cutscene, too. 
Sol Cresta was originally set to hit PlayStation, Nintendo Switch, and PC on December 9, but is now delayed to an unannounced date sometime in the future.

                    <span>Want to know whether you should buy the Disabler in Guardians Of The Galaxy? Whilst on Knowhere during Chapter 6, you can look around and partake in a bit of shopping. Whilst looking between the various stalls, you will find a merchant who offers to sell you a disabler that will supposedly remove the Nova Corps tracker from your ship. This would mean you don’t need to pay the Nova Corps fine that you incurred earlier in Chapter 2. However, Knowhere is a seedy place, and it’s hard to be certain whether you might get conned.
This guide will explain whether you should buy the disabler on Knowhere in Guardians Of The Galaxy, so that you can avoid any scams.

Play the game and you&#x27;ll quickly realise it does things games aren&#x27;t supposed to do. Most notably, for me at least, Inscryption makes me feel like I&#x27;m actually playing a proper card game; that feeling of being present at a table, slapping cards down on its hard surface. I hadn&#x27;t realised how crucial this was to my enjoyment of CCGs, until now.

                    <span>Want to learn how to create the best Thoma build in Genshin Impact? As the chief retainer of Inazuma’s Kamisato Clan, Mondstadt native Thoma is always down to lend a helping hand, even aiding the player in their arrival to Inazuma.

                    <span>Want to learn how to create the best Sucrose build in Genshin Impact? Anemo Catalyst user Sucrose is a bio-alchemist and the shy assistant of Albedo. Despite her timid personality, Anemo Catalyst user Sucrose is definitely not afraid to use her alchemical abilities in battle and serves as a 4-star substitute for 5-star Anemo characters like Venti and Kazuha — essentially, she’s a sub-DPS great at crowd control and applying the Swirl reaction.

                    <span>You&#x27;d think being 1000 years old would earn you some respect, but in Demon Turf, that means you&#x27;re still a child. Admittedly, it makes for an intriguing premise in this tale of conquest and demonic shakedowns, but don&#x27;t be fooled. While its core systems take inspiration from 3D platformers of the N64 era, Demon Turf isn’t another Banjo Kazooie successor like publisher Playtonic&#x27;s Yooka-Laylee. You’ll find those familiar cliches, sure, but there’s something great about Fabraz’s latest effort that goes beyond its unique visuals.

                    <span>Blizzard&#x27;s monster-clicker Diablo IV and face-shooter Overwatch 2 have both been delayed, pushing their uncertain launches even further into the future. Blizzard had never stated a release date for either game anyway, we only had a vague hint that they didn&#x27;t expect to launch them in 2021. Now, maybe 2023 at earliest?

                    <span>Jen Oneal is stepping down as co-lead of Blizzard Entertainment, just three months after she took the position. Since J. Allen Brack left the company in August, Oneal had been in charge of the studio with Mike Ybarra, who&#x27;ll now take the lead on his own. Oneal claims she&#x27;s not leaving because she&#x27;s &quot;without hope for Blizzard&quot;, but wants to &quot;do more to have games and diversity intersect, and hopefully make a broader industry impact that will benefit Blizzard (and other studios) as well.&quot;

                    <span>Card games are all the rage these days, so much so that even Yoko Taro of Nier: Automata fame is getting in on the action. Alas, if you’re expecting a similarly galaxy brain take on tabletop RPGs here, you’re going to be disappointed. Despite the creative minds behind it (Automata’s producer Yosuke Saito and composer Keiichi Okabe are also on board), Voice Of Cards: The Isle Dragon Roars is a decidedly simple role playing affair where its titular cards are nothing more than a fancy visual layer papering over a by-the-book tale of dungeons and, yes, a dragon. Inscryption this ain’t.

                    <span>We finally know when The Binding of Isaac’s gigantic Repentance expansion makes its way to consoles. Creator Edmund McMillen took to Twitter to announce the PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch versions launch this coming Thursday.
That’s November 4 if you don’t have a calendar nearby. In terms of specific platforms, Repentance is coming to PlayStation 5 and 4, Xbox Series X/S, and Switch. If you’re feeling left out on Xbox One, McMillen assured players the game will hit that console “not long after.” He also says to expect the physical retail versions down the line too.

November 2, 2021
The Binding of Isaac: Repentance launched on PC this past March. Though not a sequel, it’s a massive expansion to the original game (as well as its final update) that adds dozens of features and quality-of-life improvements. These include over 130 new items, over 5,000 new room designs, 100 additional enemies, and over 25 new bosses. You can also control two new playable characters and earn over 100 added achievements. Repentance even boasts a full alternate path with new chapters, final boss, and ending.

                    <span>While playing a game may sometimes be a short experience for players, hundreds, if not thousands, of work hours created it, even more so for longer titles. Game development is complicated, and crossing the finish line to hit release is a feat unto itself. 
However, sadly, not every game makes it across that line. A few end up somewhere informally known as “development hell.” It’s here that games might reside for months, years, or in some rare cases, over a decade. In Part 1 of this development hell series, we detailed the development history and path to development hell for five games – Pikmin 4, Skull &amp; Bones, Beyond Good and Evil 2, In the Valley of Gods, and Dead Island 2 – and below, in Part 2, we’ll examine five more.

                    <span>There&#x27;s a mystery afoot, and we need the assistance of our best detectives: The Game Informer community! 
Snorlax is known to slumber wherever it wants, usually blocking the paths up-and-coming trainers need to cross to continue their journey. Coaxing a Snorlax to wake up and get out of the way isn&#x27;t easy and usually requires the melody of a special flute to do the heavy lifting. This situation looks quite a bit different than your usual sleepover, though. It may be dangerous, innocuous, or even nefarious, but that&#x27;s up to you, dear reader! 
We&#x27;d love to hear what you think is happening in the image above involving the passed-out Snorlax on the train tracks with Yamper and Machamp surrounding the behemoth. Give us your best story in the comments!
You can work with the above picture to build your description of what in tarnation is happening. Below you can see three more angles at the scene, giving more context but begs even more questions like: 
Does Machamp think he can stop a speeding train with just a sign?

If you&#x27;re interested in owning this figure, it&#x27;s called the Delibird Holiday Express Snorlax Pass figure, one of many new holiday-themed items on the Pokémon Center online store. Two other figures complement the Snorlax Pass piece, but please don&#x27;t use those as part of your narrative in the comments. It&#x27;s far more fun to hear what creative ideas you come up with!

                    <span>There&#x27;s a segment in a 2003 episode of radio series This American Life from 2003, in which a man named Dan Fitzsimons talks about a cable television channel he tried to launch in the &#x27;90s. It was the &quot;Puppy Channel&quot;. A 24/7 broadcast of nothing but puppies. 

At the time, no cable provider liked the idea enough to make it happen, but I think about the story a lot. I think about it on days like today, on which Twitch has just introduced a new &quot;Animals, Aquariums, and Zoos&quot; category to the livestreaming platform.

                    <span>&quot;Storm Point. It&#x27;s a place where dreams come true,&quot; says a character at the end of Apex Legends&#x27; Escape mode trailer. Given the two preceding minutes, presumably the dreams have to involve being fired into the sky and then stabbing a bunch of dudes.

Apex Legends&#x27; new season, including Storm Point map and new character Ash, are all live now.

                    <span>Marvel&#x27;s Avengers came to Xbox Game Pass at the end of September. A week later, Square Enix added paid, consumable XP boosters to its in-game store, to much predictable uproar from its players.

Today, Square Enix announced that they were removing the boosters, while apologising &quot;for not responding sooner&quot; to players&#x27; concerns.

Finally, the big&#x27;un has arrived: Minecraft. Both the original Java and cross-platform Bedrock versions of Minecraft arrived on Microsoft&#x27;s subscription service today, packaged into a unified launcher. This comes ahead of plans to give all PC Minecrafters access to both versions next year.

                    <span>In true Shadow Tactics fashion, here’s an expansion no one saw coming. Aiko’s Choice is a miniature campaign extension to 2016’s real-time tactics wonder. A standalone title, but one that slots into the original game’s main story. It feels like a DLC package that should have been released closer to the original, but I’m not going to drag developers Mimimi for tardiness - after all, this is a game where it takes me upwards of three hours to creep around a single map. Nothing about Shadow Tactics is rushed.

                    <span>Riders Republic is a multiplayer open world sports game developed by Ubisoft Annecy, in which every single character talks like they’re your mum’s new boyfriend after they find a bong in your sock drawer. And, hey, like, we get it, y’know, we all like to “hang loose” on Tik Tok sometimes, but – at this point Gareth the 43-year-old divorcé grabs a chair, spins it 180 degrees and sits on it in one smooth motion – dope just isn’t on fleek, fam.
Insufferable cutscenes aside, this is a thrilling downhill racing simulator in which you, a new arrival to a vast landscape of snowy peaks, scorched desert badlands, towering forests and rain-lashed mud flats, must repeatedly hurl yourself down the side of a mountain faster or more stylishly than your opponents. The world is a compressed version of California with all of the San Franciscos taken out, leaving just a bizarre population of baggy jeans wearing Urban Dictionary acolytes, and a vast interconnected series of freely roamable tracks and wilderness littered with activities to complete and landmarks to discover.

Released today, it&#x27;s a chill game about unpacking moving boxes, unloading all the items from someone&#x27;s life into their new home. I&#x27;ve never liked unpacking in real life, it feels stressful and annoying trying to find space for all my stuff. But I&#x27;m starting to think that Unpacking (the game) might make me feel better about it. Perhaps next time I move house, I should go into it with the energy of this relaxed puzzler.

It&#x27;s about opening a chocolate shop staffed by ghosts, and you&#x27;ll be able to venture out into fantastical places to collect ingredients. Honestly, it&#x27;s exactly what I&#x27;d want from a Stardew follow-up. Barone says Haunted Chocolatier will have &quot;a greater focus on combat&quot; than Stardew, and has provided some detail on how the chocolate game&#x27;s battles will work.

                    <span>Like anyone, I went into Echo Generation knowing it would be riding on Stranger Things’ coattails. With its young cast and retro, small town setting, this is a game that definitely falls into that familiar “gang of boys plus maybe someone’s girlfriend going on an occult adventure” vein of 80s nostalgia fests like The Goonies and It. But the question was, would it be an inspired homage to the Upside Down, or a cash grab with a voxel paint job designed to lure in &#x27;the youth&#x27;? The answer, sadly, is neither.

You won&#x27;t find outfits in every chapter, so don&#x27;t panic when you notice some are missing. Below, we&#x27;ve listed every chapter in which you can find outfits.

                    <span>With Halloween behind us, it&#x27;s time to ask: is the 1st of November too early to put up Christmas lights? Is it a grim sign of ravenous consumerism, or a welcome respite from the watching the year die slowly and painfully in its final months? As I untangled my strings of LED lights this morning, I realised that PC gaming is the most Christmassy of gamings. The colourful LEDs people cram into their PC&#x27;s every orifice and pore aren&#x27;t just any decoration, they&#x27;re Christmas lights. That&#x27;s their purpose. It always has been. Christmas is year-round for PC gamers. So here it is: merry Christmas.

                    <span>I almost don&#x27;t want to tell you what The End Of Dyeus is. Surprise and discovery are among the things I enjoy most in games, and they&#x27;re too often undermined in the modern age. Damned kids, with your wikis and your hashed tags. It&#x27;s a first person fighting and exploration game that drops you in a pastoral fantasy world with no instruction beyond &quot;find Dyeus&quot; and some straightforward control explainers. The only thing I dislike is that I have no idea how to pronounce it, dramatically limiting my pun options.

                    <span>Spooky season might be behind us now, but man, it’s still pretty scary out there. My inbox sits at 576 unread emails, and in another tab I’m browsing heated clothes airers; things that I now realise are frighteningly expensive. But it’s not just mundane things in real life that give me goosebumps, it now extends to virtual white goods as well.
Right, so, there’s this fridge in Marvel’s Guardians Of The Galaxy and no matter how many times I close it, it won’t stay shut. At first it was funny, but it’s since morphed from a sly chuckle to a howl of agony. My relationship with the game is like that thing Yoda from Star Wars says, “Fear leads to the Dark Side”. Well, I’m almost there, let me tell you.

                    <span>Even though I’ve been dead excited about Weird West since its announcement last summer, when the time finally came for me to play a preview build last week, I found myself unusually hesitant. Primarily, this was because I loved the game’s concept so much (“What if Dishonored and Desperadoes III had a rooting tooting baby, then let it watch way too many horror movies?”), that I didn’t really want to face the possibility that developers WolfEye Studios might have fallen short on it. But more than that, I was worried I’d have to… well, make an effort.


For whatever reason, my enthusiasm to start new games has been taking one of its periodic dips over the last month or so, leaving me in the comforting arms of old favourites I can play on autopilot. Time and time again, I’ll get right to the point of hitting play on something, before convincing myself - completely unreasonably - that it’ll probably be a load of hassle for moderate reward. And however promising a sprawling, top-down immersive sim set in a world of haunted stetsons sounded, I was certain it would involve a lot of fiddling about with inventories, reading long screeds of text, and going on sidequests.


I’m delighted to say, however, that I was completely wrong. Because while Weird West does involve all those things (and features even more emergent complexity than the hefty dose I’d anticipated, to boot) I have not had a smoother time getting into a game in a long while. The build I played only featured one of the game’s five character campaigns, admittedly. But unless the other four are all set in a Tesco car park or something, I can heartily recommend it to you.

                    <span>Battlefield 2042 has a new trailer ahead of its November 19th release, and this one is aimed directly at us PC folk. While the action itself is more of the near-future mega-bangs you’ve probably seen in previous teasers (or, indeed, the open beta), it’s all in service of demonstrating the PC-exclusive features: chiefly ray tracing, Nvidia DLSS and Nvidia Reflex support.

                    <span>If you&#x27;ve already finished House Of Ashes, you&#x27;ll have seen a wee trailer revealing that the next part of The Dark Pictures Anthology will be the &quot;season one finale&quot;, named The Devil In Me. Bandai Namco have since publicly announced the next game in Supermassive&#x27;s interactive horror story series, explaining a bit more of what&#x27;s going on with the animatronic corpse. Bad news for would-be survivors: it&#x27;s set in a replica of the infamous &#x27;Murder Castle&#x27;, a hotel built with traps and torture chambers by American serial killer H. H. Holmes.

                    <span>The reason I enjoy Riot&#x27;s FPS Valorant so much is because it has an excellent mixture of fun abilities and tactical gunplay, which is why I&#x27;m not sure what to make of its new character. Chamber is a French weapons designer who&#x27;s set to arrive in the game&#x27;s next Act on November 16th, and his abilities mostly involve spawning weapons. Not weapons you can buy normally in-game, but special weapons that he&#x27;s made himself. Somehow, this feels like cheating.

                    <span>I hope you like animosity. Darkest Dungeon 2 will eat your eyes and call you selfish for wanting them back. The ferocity with which it treats its players shouldn’t be a surprise to anyone who clawed their way through the crypts of the first Darkest Dungeon, a turn-based homage to Lovecraft and slow-acting poison. It especially won’t surprise anyone who bled their way through the early access version of that game, either. A lot of the difficulty and madness in the sequel comes not from the dangerous creatures along its roguelike turnpike, but from the roughly shorn design of a road trip yet to be completed. This is a faithfully despondent, sometimes frustrating journey of attrition, decay and distrust. A journey you should maybe put off until the wobblesome wagon has all its wheels tightened.

                    <span>The clocks have gone back and the cold is creeping in, so now it&#x27;s time for me to get too excited too early for the winter speedrunning event Awesome Games Done Quick. While it&#x27;s too early for the full schedule right now, organisers have revealed the current list of accepted games, and there are already some absolute belters. A race to beat every Dark Souls boss and Deathloop&#x27;s first GDQ outing are amongst the highlights. But the one I&#x27;m most looking forward to is a blindfolded Sekiro run. I couldn&#x27;t finish that game even using my eyes.

Next week a free update for The Sims 4 will add these kinds of challenges to the game itself, beginning with two new scenarios.

The action-adventure game has been rattling around for at least six years, but it&#x27;s beginning to look more and more like an actual game. Watch the new trailer below.

                    <span>A group of developers have written an open letter to Valve asking them to reverse their decision to forbid games containing NFTs and other blockchain technologies on Steam. NFTs are great, they say, arguing that they &quot;make games more decentralized, democratic, interactive, player focused systems.&quot;

                    <span>One of the first things that may strike you about Mundaun, a very unsettling horror game that released earlier this year, is just how comfortable with weirdness it is. There are hay people hunting you in the night, monstrous masks inspired by traditional Swiss carnival costumes, and the decapitated head of the goat Allegria, bleating and chattering from your backpack. 


Many horror games either try to establish a sense of mundane familiarity in a recognisable, contemporary world before shattering that familiarity, or else rely on the dusty, done-to-death setting of haunted manors. In most cases, neither approach does much to surprise. Horror often relies on the grotesque, but Mundaun’s weirdness is different. It is an earthy kind of weirdness, a strangeness with roots so deep that it might be confused with familiarity. It’s a horror that smells not of blood, but of hay and dung, snow and soot.

Or perhaps I’ll be creeping around a haunted house in Phasmophobia, my smudge stick in-hand and a cavalcade of petrified friends whimpering down their mics. Maybe I’ll be running from Pyramid Head in Dead By Daylight with my pals in tow. A thought has been brewing in the cold recesses of my mind for a while now, and it is simply this: when did horror become a team game?

But the greatest horror this weekend isn&#x27;t any ghost or ghoulie, it&#x27;s UK clocks switching back to GMT this weekend. Sure, your phone and computer will automatically update, but your heating will be irksome until you again dig out the manual to remember how to change it. And a secondary blast of horror comes from the fact that not every country changes their clocks just yet, so if you deal with business across timezones... good luck, pal. But, what are you playing this weekend?

                    <span>Ever since I witnessed a little red-and-blue plumber-man tumble into the gnashing jaws of a Piranha Plant, I knew vegetables weren’t to be trusted. I see my suspicion of all things green and floral as a natural, even instinctual thing. We ourselves aren’t vegetable, and differences so often motivate our deepest fears. The vegetal realm is entirely inaccessible to us, its behaviour strange and habitats dark. From the carnivorous Venus flytrap to the bleeding tooth fungus, from plants that smell like rotting corpses to one&#x27;s that trap prey and dissolve them with digestive fluids, it’s an unknown, often dangerous world, and one that overlaps closely with our own. And it makes for a compelling game.

                    <span>Want to know how to convince the Worldmind in Guardians Of The Galaxy? The adventure to save the galaxy doesn’t just involve shooting Chitauri and cracking jokes. Throughout Guardians Of The Galaxy, you engage in conversations with various characters, in which you can make decisions that will alter the course of the game. Most of these have small, fairly insignificant consequences. However, the conversation with the Worldmind in Chapter 9 could help you get some crucial help in a difficult fight later in the game.
This guide will show you the correct choices to make to convince the Worldmind that Raker can be defeated in Guardians Of The Galaxy.

                    <span>Steam user genre tags can be awful. Cyberpunk 2077 was, for example, tagged ‘masterpiece’ for months before the first gameplay trailer, while the much more reasonable and catchy ‘looks cool sure but too early to say anything definitive if we’re being adults about it’ tag was strangely absent. Happily, they are sometimes wonderful, like the tag alongside ‘comedy’ and ‘indie’ that categorises avian arsehole adventure Untitled Goose Game as having a ‘villain protagonist’.

                    <span>Krafton, the South Korean company behind Plunkbat and Tera, today announced that they&#x27;re buying Unknown Worlds, the studio splendid subaquatic survival sim series Subnautica and the fantastic FPS-RTS hybrid Natural Selection.
