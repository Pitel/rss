                              <span>As 2023 comes to a close, the games industry once again prepares for another ceremony recognizing the year&#x27;s line-up of adventures that made us laugh, cry, and everything in between. While we all have our personal lists, The Game Awards (TGA) packages that into something a little more formal.


We&#x27;ve crafted our way through Hyrule, rolled in the Forgotten Realms, explored the Settled Systems, and swung through New York. As a massive celebration of video games, TGA acts as a sign-off and spotlight for things to come. With its formal list of nominees planned for a November 13 reveal, I figured I&#x27;d highlight a few of 2023&#x27;s dark horse candidates. Commit the box art to memory &#x27;cause I&#x27;m hoping for some snubs, surprises, and success stories out of these.

                              <span>Level-5 has quite the lineup of games in store, but it&#x27;s taking some extra time for at least one of them. The studio has confirmed that Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time is being pushed into 2024.


The team says it&#x27;s pushing the Switch game back to ensure Fantasy Life i is released &quot;in better quality to everyone.&quot; No firm release date for next year&#x27;s been set, but we&#x27;ll be hearing about it soon. Level-5 is holding another Vision 2023 event later this month on November 29, where it plans to announce the new release date for Fantasy Life i.




What&#x27;s ahead for Level-5


Considering a number of Level-5&#x27;s other projects are all still labeled 2023—and we&#x27;re running out of 2023 with each day that passes—I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised to see some other windows shift. If anything&#x27;s left to launch this year, there&#x27;s not a lot of time left.


That said, this reinvigorated Level-5 is exciting to see come together. While the studio&#x27;s been largely working on properties like Ni no Kuni and Yo-Kai Watch for the last few years, they&#x27;ve now got a hefty lineup of both familiar and fresh games. One in particular, Decapolice, has really caught my eye, and reportedly looked good at Tokyo Game Show 2023.


My hope is that Level-5 gets the time to comfortably make what they want to. This studio produces some wild, wonderful worlds that are a blast to explore, and both Fantasy Life i and its other games look really intriguing. We&#x27;ll hopefully learn more about Level-5&#x27;s docket moving forward at the end of the month.

                              <span>I’ve heard it being said many times and many ways, but this year has been an excellent one for games and an abysmal one for the folks who create them. On that note, Samurai Punk—the studio behind several indie games including Killbug and Screencheat—has announced its closure in a post via Twitter.




In the post, the team celebrates an impressive decade-long run as a studio, and notes that “it’s been an amazing run and we’d like to thank our team past and present; the 9 incredible games we’ve made wouldn’t have been possible without them.” 


In speaking of the team, Samurai Punk has created a Google doc with the information for those affected by this closure. “These incredible folks will now be looking for new roles, so if you have roles available or know of any openings, please contact us or the individuals directly.”


Samurai Punk was established in 2014, and is responsible for Screencheat, as well as The American Dream, Feather, Roombo: First Blood, and Killbug, among others. It is by no means the only studio that has suffered a closure in 2023 — some examples include Dillon’s Rolling Western developer Vanpool, Boomerang X developer Dang!, and the Embracer Group-owned Volition Games, who made Saints Row.


It genuinely hurts me to hear news like this, especially when games like Screencheat somehow manage to fly under my radar all this time. I am hoping with all my heart that these talented creators are able to land on their feet and continue creating for years to come.

                              <span>Recently, a group of modders released their own Community Patch for Starfield, representing a collaboration working to improve the studio&#x27;s new IP. Creative fans have crafted mods left, right, and center since the game&#x27;s release, and that&#x27;s without official modding support from Bethesda. 


In a recent interview with Eurogamer, Timothy &quot;Halgari&quot; Baldridge, one of the founders of the Starfield Community Patch, spoke about the efforts being put in to fix issues with the space-faring RPG. Halgari broke down how Starfield&#x27;s hindered modding potential is a bit of a sore spot and how digging around reveals game code that prepared for those features, but they aren&#x27;t there yet. 


It looks like a plan, according to Halgari, that Bethesda &quot;would add modding some day&quot; to its new IP but hasn&#x27;t yet. H…</span>

                              <span>Get your bribe money ready. Weappy Studios, the developer behind This is the Police, has unveiled their latest game, Hollywood Animal. It’s set to release on PC sometime in 2024.


Hollywood Animal is a narrative management sim where you try to run a movie studio with as few scruples as possible. Manage staff through gifts or blackmail, create movies to gain favors, but just keep things as profitable as possible. Craft art, build stars, or simply find their dark spots so you can stick a hook in and make them dance. All this is covered in the absolutely fantastic announcement trailer.




I don’t remember the last time I saw a game trailer that superb.


Hollywood Animal is being billed as a narrative-first game, but includes all the standard management hooks. By the looks of all the systems show off, it’s really quite complex. It takes you through the ages as you try to keep your studio afloat while not bringing too much attention to your shady dealings. Select the director, the writers, and the actors, and then try to keep them all happy (or at least complacent). Navigate the changing political landscape of the ages.


I am so on board with this. I’ve wanted a good movie studio simulator for a while, or at least a re-release of 2005’s The Movies. Crime is also a passion of mine, so it&#x27;s a really good mix.


Hollywood Animals is currently announced for PC and is expected to land sometime in 2024.

                              <span>This year has seen a slew of studios and gaming companies face significant layoffs, and it doesn&#x27;t seem like things are set to slow down soon. It appears Unity may be the next to suffer layoffs as it attempts to become a &quot;leaner, more agile, and faster growing company.&quot;


In a shareholder letter, Unity CEO James Whitehurst claims that the company has a big opportunity to grow in the future, though that may be difficult at present because the team is trying to do too much at once. As Whitehurst explains, &quot;we are not achieving the synergies that exist across our portfolio, and we are not executing to our full potential.&quot; 


Third-quarter financial results are described as &quot;mixed.&quot; The strategy to make the company leaner will include increasing focus on its main projects such as the Unity Editor. Though nothing is set in stone yet, the plan will likely involve discontinuing certain products, reducing the business&#x27;s office footprint, and reducing the size of the workforce. 


The letter also addressed the controversy surrounding the announcement of runtime fees. Whitehurst acknowledges that &quot;the execution created friction with our customers and near-term headwinds.&quot; Despite this, there&#x27;s no indication of any intentions to back down. The event is described as &quot;now mostly behind us,&quot; though it is expected that because of the controversy, the new business model will be minimally beneficial in 2024 until customers adopt Unity&#x27;s new releases.


No date is given regarding when these interventions will be implemented but further guidance will come with the fourth quarter and full year 2023 results.

                              <span>Despite its legacy, Xbox 360 puzzle-platformer Braid hasn&#x27;t been around much. However, that&#x27;s all about to change as the game&#x27;s creator Jonathan Blow has recently announced an Anniversary Edition coming in 2024.


Releasing April 30, this new version of Braid comes with improved visuals and animations, areas that have been &quot;re-envisioned to make them more unique,&quot; and more than 15 hours of commentary. If you&#x27;re interested in the world game development, that last one may be of interest to you.




This special Anniversary Edition – which is launching to celebrate 15 years of Braid – is coming to PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, iOS, Android, and even Netflix. It&#x27;ll also be available on PS4 and Xbox One, with Linux and Mac ports coming later on.


Considered a &quot;masterpiece&quot;


Originally released on Xbox 360 in 2008, Braid has been described as one of the greatest independent games of its generation. It won several awards and was the second-largest-selling game on Xbox Live Arcade. It has a Metacritic score of 93.


Its developer Blow is no stranger to the video game world. Some of his earlier work includes being a programmer on Oddworld: Munchy&#x27;s Oddysee and Deus Ex: Invisible War. He released the puzzle title The Witness in 2016.


He&#x27;s also gained something of a reputation over the years, often being held aloft as an outspoken critic of the gaming industry. He was described in a 2016 New Yorker article as a &quot;prickly genius,&quot; while an interview with Kotaku in 2011 said Blow&#x27;s opinions are not aimed at individuals, but at &quot;trends.&quot; He&#x27;s also no stranger to making public controversial statements over the years, further complicating his legacy.


In any case, Braid is often signposted as an indie release that helped shape an industry of indie releases. This was before Minecraft did it. If you still haven&#x27;t played the game (guilty), April&#x27;s Anniversary Edition is definitely one to look out for.

The Grammy award-winning The 8-Bit Big Band and Lawrence are releasing a new cover of the Marvel vs Capcom 2 song &quot;I Wanna Take You for a Ride.&quot; It&#x27;s been covered many times by the VGM community, but in this instance, new verses and a bridge accompany the admittedly repetitive tune. 




Marvel vs Capcom 2 jam gets taken for a ride


Despite the original release from Marvel vs Capcom 2 repeating the same line over and over again, it&#x27;s one with a special place in fan memories with a funky beat too delicious to ignore. Thankfully, The 8-Bit Big Band and Lawrence bring their own vision to the bop with a full song based on the loop. This version adds new lyrics, verses, and a bridge next month on November 10.


The 45 seconds released on social media from The 8-Bit Big Band has an outstanding suite of brass instruments and thrilling vocals. Almost time for MAHVEL, baby. 


Last year, the 8-Bit Big Band (and Button Basher) won a &quot;Best Arrangement - Instrumental or A Capella&quot; Grammy for its cover of &quot;Meta Knight&#x27;s Revenge&quot; from Kirby Super Star. Since its release in 2021, the theme received over 1 million views on YouTube.


Perhaps with this upcoming Marvel vs Capcom 2 cover, they&#x27;ll get another Grammy. Nevertheless, The 8-Bit Big Band has an upcoming show in New York on December 15. Its fourth album, &quot;Game Changer,&quot; accompanies the Marvel jam on November 10.

                              <span>Fallout 76 was released on November 14, 2018 in a wretched state, and I absolutely cannot believe it&#x27;s been five years since then. While most publishers would have buried it and moved on, the creative team got to work and the funding arrived to salvage the game. To celebrate, in-game events are on the way.


Fallout 76 5-year anniversary event details


We&#x27;re not getting a massive quality of life overhaul or DLC per se, but there will be a streaming event on Twitch on Tuesday November 14 at 3PM ET, as well as a birthday event from now through November 21 at 12PM ET.


Here is the full rundown of the stream from Bethesda:



&quot;Organized by our friends at Fallout for Hope, we have over 40 floats, live music, Atom giveaways and more! Did we also mention that Adrienne Barbeau, who you know as the voice of the Overseer, will be doing a S.P.E.C.I.A.L. introduction speech? And who better to narrate the parade than Wes Johnson himself? Wes Johnson who you know as the voice of… well… all our favorite robots! Protectrons, Fasnacht Paraders, Nuka-World&#x27;s Dr. Del Walsh, and many more! (No, seriously, look him up we love his voice!)&quot;




Fallout 76 is in good company, alongside No Man&#x27;s Sky and Final Fantasy XIV (1.0)


While there was no excuse for the state it was launched in, Fallout 76 gets high marks on its report card in the BUG (bring-up-grades) section. The team actually committed to making the game better, and while it took nearly two years to add NPCs (the turning point for 76), they came all the same. It sounds rediculous, adding in content that seems standard for open world games, but such was the early state of Fallout 76.

I think I know why. Let me find the tweet. Here it is. Lead engine designer at Nightdive, Samuel Villarreal tweeted, “Nothing&#x27;s better than failing PS4 certification one week before a game is shipped because it crashes when loading a specific level, only on a PS4 Pro, only on 4k resolution, and only when a debugger is not attached.” He then sarcastically added, “Yup, I sure do enjoy that.”




He later added that the issue has now been fixed, but the turnaround time on certification is slow.


There&#x27;s no official confirmation that certification problems were the cause of the delay i…</span>

                              <span>Destiny 2 is currently in a rough spot. Player morale is at an all-time low, tanking after a round of Bungie layoffs and news of a reported delay for the upcoming The Final Shape expansion. And while Bungie is using the delay to double down on ensuring the new expansion is a smash hit, serious concerns about Destiny&#x27;s longevity are cropping up. Even if The Final Shape proves to be everything Bungie promises, inescapable factors persist against the game.


But the situation didn&#x27;t get like this overnight. Bungie&#x27;s decisions reportedly came after noting the title&#x27;s yearly revenue would fall 45% below expectations. That sharp decline is symptomatic of issues that have been building for years. And with player sentiment where it is, alongside a projected content drought and a perceived &quot;endpoin…</span>

                              <span>With the Grand Theft Auto 6 trailer announcement being made recently, all eyes are once again on Rockstar&#x27;s behemoth franchise. Not that eyes were ever truly off it. GTA 5 is still doing phenomenally well, as outlined in Take-Two Interactive&#x27;s recent figures.


According to conference call notes uploaded a couple of days ago, Grand Theft Auto 5 has now sold approximately 190 million units since it launched in 2013. Compare this to November 2022&#x27;s prepared remarks – when it had sold 170 million – and it&#x27;s obvious the game is still selling in droves.


At this rate, it could well fly past the 200 million mark, maintaining its stance as the second highest-selling game after Minecraft (which recently hit 300 million).


Better be worth the wait


GTA 6 is still pretty elusive. Aside from the leak in 2022, we really don&#x27;t know much about the hugely anticipated follow-up. Rockstar has promised the first official trailer in December, so at least we have that to look forward to.


It&#x27;s a tall order to be the next big thing after Grand Theft Auto 5, but after years of speculations, leaks, and the collective will of gamers everywhere, the world is finally ready for the next installment.


It&#x27;s tempting to say that once the sixth game comes out, sales of GTA 5 may slow down significantly. However, Rockstar&#x27;s not above rehashing some of its older (and more lucrative) titles, so who knows what the studio has planned for the game. There&#x27;s still some milking to be done for that proverbial cash cow.

                              <span>It&#x27;s pretty well known that Bethesda nearly had a voiced protagonist in Starfield. The developer decided against it in the end. However, did you know that one of those actors could well have been the voice behind Adam Jensen?


In a recent post on Twitter/X, Elias Toufexis, who takes on the role of the main character in the two most recent Deus Ex games, said he was originally going to voice the Starfield hero.




He also said that Cissy Jones – another prolific video game voice artist – was originally planned to play the protagonist, presumably the female version. However, while Bethesda did scrap the idea in the end, we did still get to hear both actors, with Toufexis playing Sam Coe and Jones playing Andreja.


Would it have been better?


With the exception of Fallout 4, Bethesda games typically have a silent main character. Many argue this helps with immersion. It could also be a time, money, and labor-saving decision at the hands of the studio.


In any case, Starfield having a mute protagonist is par for the course for Todd Howard and his team. We could be looking at a different experience if we had Toufexis&#x27; gravelly dialogue guiding us through the cosmos.


Despite major hype for the game, Starfield doesn&#x27;t feel like it has the staying power of something like Skyrim. It&#x27;s still a good sci-fi game – and the continuous updates will only improve things – but it might be a stretch to think of it as a potential Bethesda classic in years to come.

                              <span>Level-5 will be hosting the second Vision 2023 event this year on November 29 at 21:00 JST. You&#x27;ll be able to watch the show live on YouTube. 


As Gematsu reports, the event will run for half an hour, and English subtitles will be available. You can expect to receive plenty of information and release dates for upcoming Level-5 games including Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road, DECAPOLICE, FANTASY LIFE i: The Girl Who Steals Time, Megaton Musashi Wired, and Professor Layton and The New World of Steam. 


The last Vision 2023 event was held in March and it featured trailers for several titles, including Megaton Musashi Wired. During this month&#x27;s event, I&#x27;ll be looking out for the latest entry in the Professor Layton series which will hopefully receive a release date. It appeared at the previous event, giving us a look into what we can expect from the story. 




The latest Inazuma Eleven game will also be worth taking a peek at. It was originally slated for a 2018 release, but several delays have pushed it back for years. Hopefully, the long wait is almost over.

                              <span>According to Bloomberg&#x27;s Jason Schreier, Modern Warfare 3 was developed in about half the time Call of Duty titles usually take. With only a year and a half to work on the game, development was fraught with issues, Schreier&#x27;s sources reveal. 


As Schreier explains, MW3 was originally pitched as a DLC, but the game was suddenly turned into a standalone title to fill in a gap in the company&#x27;s release schedule after another 2023 CoD game planned for this year was delayed. This has been denied by an Activision spokesperson, but Schreier insists that &quot;more than a dozen current and former Call of Duty developers said that conflicts with what they were told at the time.&quot;

Solid Snake is two different people — just like the real Big Boss


In the Metal Gear Solid series, Solid Snake would feature an original look for the first game, but then become heavily inspired by Snake Plissken from John Carpenter&#x27;s Escape From New York. You might know that one considering how Snake actually goes undercover as &quot;Pliskin&quot; in Metal Gear Solid 2, but did you know that the character began life because of a…</span>

Luckily, a new update for Alan Wake 2 fixes a T-posing Alex Casey while addressing progression-halting bugs.


To be fair, the latter is arguably far more terrifying. Most should agree that a bug stopping your story progress in a game is both scary and frustrating. In fact, it actually happened to me yesterday in Alan Wake 2. The rides at the Espresso Express were clipped into the wooden platform, and the capsule that was supposed to move out of the way wasn&#x27;t. And I didn&#x27;t feel like pushing a wheelbarrow around. Luckily, things should be sorted out after today.

                              <span>Today Sony revealed that it’s shifting its strategy with live service games. The company is scaling back the number of live service games it plans by fiscal year 2025 to launch by half.


In case you didn’t remember, just last May Sony announced ambitious plans to release a total of 12 live service games by the end of its fiscal 2025. In theory, having a deep catalog of live service titles would give Sony a steady stream of income from players who fully bought into their favorite games. Now, Sony seems to be acknowledging that creating that deep catalog is easier said than done. 


In a November 9 earnings call, Hiroki Totoki, COO, CFO, and President of Sony, elaborated on what led to this change in plans. Totoki said that after Sony acquired Bungie last July, the company had the developer help refine its plan for live service games. Ultimately, Totoki said that Sony realized it’s previous plan wouldn’t be able to produce satisfactory games. 


“We have not been able to meet the gamers’ expectations,” Totoki said, “But we are trying as much as possible [to ensure these games will] be played by gamers and liked by gamers for a long time.” To make that happen, Totoki said, “six titles will be released by FY25. That’s our current plan.” 


The other six live service games aren’t going anywhere just yet. Totoki said that the company is still deciding when those games will be released, but for now it will focus on making sure the first six games are as good as possible. He didn’t mention which games made the cut for the initial six, so the fate of specific titles like The Last of Us multiplayer, which was delayed earlier this year, is still up in the air.

                              <span>Before Insomniac created its stellar Spider-Man trilogy and before Treyarch redefined web-swinging with the 2004 Spider-Man 2 movie tie-in game, the folks at Neversoft gave Spidey fans the best example of wall-crawling video game excellence with its 2000 take on the character. Spider-Man sees the friendly neighborhood hero battle a star-studded gallery of villains in an original adventure chock full of comic book goodness. As Spider-Man&#x27;s first fully 3D action-adventure game, it laid the groundwork for mechanics such as web-swinging, a variety of web shooter attacks, and wall-crawling stealth gameplay. Let&#x27;s see how it holds up 23 years later.

                              <span>This past weekend was a big one for Blizzard, as its yearly BlizzCon event brought news across several properties, including World of Warcraft, Overwatch, and Diablo. In the wake of the expansion announcement and seasonal reveals that rolled out about Diablo IV, we had the chance to speak with Diablo franchise manager Rod Fergusson and game director Joe Shely. We asked about the studio’s development processes post-launch, the specifics of gathering and responding to fan feedback and criticism, and the most critical priorities for Diablo IV in the months following launch.

Game Informer: With the acknowledgment that it’s very different individuals and teams involved, on a studio level I’m curious if there are things about the post-launch support for Diablo III that are now being put into us…</span>

                              <span>If you&#x27;ve seen Netflix&#x27;s Arcane League of Legends animated series, there&#x27;s a high probability you really like it – the show&#x27;s great, even for non-League of Legends fans. It tells the heartwrenching story of sisters Vi and Jinx and their struggle to come to terms with each other in the high-tech (and magical) utopian city of Piltover and its seedy underbelly known as Zaun. The first season hit the subscription streaming service in November of 2021and now we know that Arcane Season 2 hits Netflix this time next year. 
More specifically, Arcane Season 2 drops on Netflix in November of 2024. To coincide with the news, Netflix has released a short teaser featuring Jinx. Check it out below:

With roughly a year to go before Season 2, if you haven&#x27;t yet watched Arcane, which features voice actors like Hailee Steinfeld, Yuri Lowenthal, Ella Purnell, and more, you&#x27;ve got plenty of time to do so – and it&#x27;s well worth your time!
In the meantime, check out the League of Legends Jinx champion skin that was added to Fortnite to celebrate Arcane, and then read Game Informer&#x27;s review of Ruined King: A League of Legends story. Read about Convergence: A League of Legends Story after that.

Following a Bloomberg report yesterday claiming Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III, which launched today, originally began as an expansion to last year&#x27;s Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II before becoming a full game (with a 16-month turnaround to boot), developer Sledgehammer Games released a statement its X account seemingly indirectly refuting the report.

                              <span>Destined to gather dust?
As we approach 2024, we&#x27;re naturally getting increasingly keen to learn more about Nintendo&#x27;s next major piece of hardware, affectionately dubbed the &#x27;Switch 2&#x27;, for now. After all, although the current line-up of upcoming Switch games is certainly nothing to sneer at, there&#x27;s no denying that Nintendo is leaning heavily on remakes and remasters, presumably while its core teams work on &#x27;next-gen&#x27; titles. If that doesn&#x27;t indicate a new console is on the horizon, we&#x27;re not sure what does.
At the moment, the majority of us are under the assumption that the &#x27;Switch 2&#x27; will be a reasonably &#x27;safe&#x27; upgrade to the current console in general form and function; a hybrid device that retains the core concept of the Switch but beefs up the performance considerably while possibly adding a few new innovations here and there. It makes sense, right? Although many of us are eager to move on to the next big thing, Nintendo isn&#x27;t ready to ditch the Switch brand, and none of us want it to. It still works wonderfully after all these years, so why do anything drastically different?

                              <span>It&#x27;s not a long wait, don&#x27;t worry.
Nightdive Studios has announced that Turok 3: Shadow of Oblivion has been delayed slightly on Switch and is now scheduled to arrive on November 30th, 2023.
The team hasn&#x27;t provided a specific reason behind the delay, but given that it&#x27;s only a couple of weeks after the initial release date, we&#x27;re honestly not too concerned.

Launching just one day after the original game&#x27;s 10th anniversary (8th November 2013), Risk of Rain Returns isn&#x27;t just a fancy upgrade with spruced-up visuals and tighter gameplay. The remake adds tons to the table to reinvigorate what many consider a classic in the genre.

                              <span>They put a Shrek in it.
Given that he’s an internet icon these days and the star of countless memes, it’s a bit of a surprise that it’s taken this long – 12 full years, in fact – to find a way to get Shrek into another video game. The last title to feature the onion-layered ogre was DreamWorks Super Star Kartz, released by Activision in 2011 for the Wii, Xbox 360, PS3, and 3DS. It’s somewhat fitting, then, that he would return in another DreamWorks karting game, and equally fitting that it too feels two generations old.
DreamWorks All-Star Kart Racing is the latest offering from Bamtang Games, which was previously responsible for the Nickelodeon Kart Racers trilogy (which started weak on Switch, got better with the second game then lost its way again with the final entry). Sadly, while this DreamWorks-themed racer has a number of decent ideas, the execution is as sloppy as a Bergin eating a Troll.

                              <span>It&#x27;s time for another edition of Ask RPS, where we answer reader questions put forward by RPS supporters. Today&#x27;s question is a nice, warm, fuzzy one, as it&#x27;s all about the good times we&#x27;ve had playing games in co-op with friends and family.
It comes courtesy of Aerothorn, who asks: What is your favorite co-op gaming memory? (along with the additional clarification that these memories don&#x27;t need to be confined to designed-for-co-op games, but could also stem from playing a single-player game with a friend. &quot;I used to play Descent with me piloting and my friend gunning!&quot; they said).
So which games make us think of happy times with pals and good company? Come and find out below.

                              <span>Speaking to investors in an earnings call this week, GTA 6 publisher Take-Two&#x27;s CEO Strauss Zelnick had a bit to say about the eternally uncontroversial topic of videogame prices. In news worth holding the press for, he thinks they&#x27;re pretty cheap for what you get in return.
Zelnick cautioned one investor against &quot;generalising&quot; about the state of game pricing based on the recent fortunes of TV and movie subscription services like Netflix, which have had to increase subscription fees to match their expenses after underpricing themselves initially to grow their audiences. Videogames might be all about subscription services these days, Zelnick said, but that doesn&#x27;t mean they are subject to the same commercial logics as ye olde non-interactive media. In particular, it doesn&#x27;t mean publishers are currently able to raise videogame prices, even if they feel like they&#x27;re overdelivering.

                              <span>The fake video games in movies and TV shows can be difficult to understand, for an obvious reason: they&#x27;re not real games. Their function is providing a few seconds of motion, colours, and noises, and possibly a premise for a plot to riff on. They don&#x27;t need to be coherent or good. Still, sometimes these glimpses and ideas are interesting enough that I quite enjoy trying to figure them out. Take Gods Of Combat, a fake first-person shooter featured in police procedural show Criminal Minds. Apparently it&#x27;s such a great game that the only way to achieve a similar high after being banned is hijacking a schoolbus and forcing teenagers to kill each other.
Here&#x27;s a fun (nonlethal) game we can play together, reader dear: I&#x27;m going to describe Gods Of Combat as best I can, then you tell me how you think it works.

                              <span>As a staunch Nintendo head in the early console days, I would say my affection for PS1-era games is... present, but not particularly palpable. For me, the PlayStation One was mostly a machine to play Final Fantasies VII through IX on, and not much else (it was a very belated and cheap second-hand purchase, I should note, and games were still sufficiently expensive back then that maintaining two healthy game libraries for both the family N64 and my new Squall box was nigh on impossible). Nevertheless, I&#x27;ve been increasingly fascinated by the revival of PS1-era games in recent years, and it&#x27;s been interesting to see which modern games have been &quot;demade&quot; in this style - see Bloodborne PSX - and which ones have made it their own from the off - see Signalis, Heartworm, and many others. 
Crow Country is the latest game I&#x27;ve seen to take up the PSX mantle, and it combines the chunkiness of Final Fantasy VII-style character models with the grimy survival horror of something like Resident Evil to brilliant effect. Made by SFB Games, the same devs wot made the also excellent Tangle Tower, it&#x27;s currently got a very good demo up on Steam at the moment, and it&#x27;s got me thinking: what do you like most about PS1-era games on PC, and which ones are your all-time favs?

                              <span>World of Warcraft&#x27;s expansion pack The War Within, out next year, comes in several flavours. There&#x27;s the standard version of the pack, which includes access to previous expansions, currency for cosmetics and a level 70 character boost. The Heroic edition gives you all that plus a mount, a pet and extra in-game cash. And then there&#x27;s the most expensive Epic edition, which includes a pet, two toys, 30 days of game time... and three days of early beta access to the game, yours for $89.99 in the states. 


Naturally, World of Warcrafters are rather concerned about the last bit. It&#x27;s the first time Blizzard&#x27;s long-running MMO has taken the paid early access approach, recently adopted by Starfield and Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 - there have been early access betas in the past, but they&#x27;ve been doled out by lottery. Blizzard&#x27;s game director Ion Hazzikostas has now moved to reassure the grousers and gripers, promising that The War Within&#x27;s Epic edition won&#x27;t give minted early worms the edge over those poor peasants who scoop up the less pricey versions.

An expert on yearning for them, anyway.

Enter Risk Of Rain Returns, a full remaster of the 2D original with higher resolution artwork, new survivors, and slicker multiplayer. It&#x27;s out now.

                              <span>Put your sleuthing caps on, detectives—it’s time to solve some mysteries! We are proud to announce that a whole batch of HeR Interactive’s Nancy Drew games are now ready for public testing:
In Nancy Drew: Stay Tuned for Danger, a soap opera star needs your help in uncovering who is behind a series of death threats that sound a little too real for comfort. 
Nancy Drew: Message in a Haunted Mansion has you helping out with repairs in a Victorian mansion. However, a series of strange accidents, plus some murmurings of a ghost haunting, quickly threaten to turn this renovation into an investigation.
In Nancy Drew: Treasure in the Royal Tower a failed ski vacation at an eccentric castle with even more eccentric inhabitants soon turns into a quest to uncover a lost piece of the history of the French Revolution.
And if you’re looking for something more thrilling, in Nancy Drew: The Final Scene, you will find yourself racing against the clock to find your kidnapped friend, while also saving a historical theater with more than a fair share of secrets from demolition.
The games are available for purchase through HeR Interactive’s website or Steam (Stay Tuned for Danger is not available on Steam, however). Or if you already own a CD copy of the games, their English and Russian variants will also work. To play them with ScummVM, you will need a daily development build. As always, if you encounter any issues, please submit a bug report to our issue tracker.

                              <span>Vývojáři linuxového jádra se rozhodli odstranit podporu architektury Itanium. Dochází k tomu v rámci aktuálního vývoje jádra verze 6.7. Hlavním důvodem je, že architektura sama už je dlouho na ústupu, její rozvoj v jádře se prakticky zastavil. V posledních letech tedy vývojáři jádra považují kód pro Itanium za brzdu dalšího vývoje.</span>

                              <span>As part of its overall strategy to reduce piracy in the Netherlands, local anti-piracy group BREIN announced a program to identify major or frequent uploaders by their IP addresses so that warnings could be sent via their ISPs. Under this system, user identities would not have been obtained by BREIN, but after a local ISP refused to cooperate and BREIN&#x27;s request to proceed was denied twice in court, BREIN had a decision to make. (SPOILER: It&#x27;s bad news for pirates)

                              <span>Google offered developer Epic Games $147 million to put Fortnite on the Google Play Store, according to The Verge’s reporting of the ongoing legal battle between Epic and Google. 


Epic’s initial decision to release Fortnite via its own third-party launcher in 2018 seemed to have sent a chill down Google’s spine, and resulted in the $147 million deal being made and rejected by Epic. The deal would’ve seen the massive total being delivered over three years via &quot;incremental funding.&quot;


By putting Fortnite on the Play Store directly, it’s being argued that Google aimed to prevent a loss of in-app fees that would stem from other developers following in Epic’s footsteps. The confirmation of this $147 million deal arrived amid the third day of the tech giants&#x27; court bout.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been around a year since I first played Signalis, and a year since it wormed into my brain. No matter how much I think about it, watch video essays about it, or replay it, something lingers.


Unraveling its secrets, getting to the heart of what Signalis is trying to do or say haunts me almost a year later. There are few games like it — Signalis hammers in its sense of hopelessness and rips my heart out with every playthrough. Everything about it feels oppressive and dire, but in a way that’s hard to move on from. I&#x27;ve embarked on Elster&#x27;s journey again and again, hoping for a better end, running this treadmill of maddening sadness. But it&#x27;s easier to go back here than move on.


So why is it that, in a year of titans like Baldur’s Gate 3, Zelda, and Armored Core, I’m still going back…</span>

                              <span>As part of today’s Netflix Geeked event, the streamer confirmed that Arcane Season 2 will be out in November 2024. In the 15-second long teaser, we can see Jinx solemnly walking towards what appears to be the Bridge of Progress in Piltover, but it’s surrounded in an ominous shade of crimson.




In the teaser, we can hear Jinx humming the melody line from “The Bridge,” which is featured in the score for the first season. Behind that, her footsteps echo and what could be the environment catching aflame and chaos ensuing can be heard. It’s bound to be an exciting continuation, based on this alone. 


It’s not exactly news that Arcane is getting a second season. Shortly after the first season concluded on November 20, 2021, the powers that be at Riot Games made the announcement that a second season was “in production.” It’s not even news that the series would be returning at the end of 2024, thanks to an investor presentation given by Tencent in September 2023, which revealed it’d be coming during Q4.


But, we now know for certain that Arcane will be returning in November 2024. I am not at all sure why we’re being told now, with a year left to wait for more of the League of Legends story, but some of the recent strikes in Hollywood that may have put a pause on production. 


I suppose we’ve already waited two years, what’s one more? In the meantime, I’ll just be over here, with “Enemy” by Imagine Dragons and JID playing on perpetual repeat.

                              <span>An unknown number of employees have been laid off at Warframe developer and Wayfinder publisher Digital Extremes today. According to Polgyon, at least 20 employees in total were let go. It appears Digital Extremes is closing their external projects division which publishes games like the recently Early Access release title Wayfinder. Instead, the company will shift its focus towards internal projects like Warframe and Soulframe. 


We reached out to Digital Extremes who confirmed the information and provided the following statement



“We can confirm we have made the difficult decision to cease operations of our external projects division. We have had to say goodbye to a number of hardworking and highly valuable team members as a result.”




The representative also confirmed that Digital Extremes is looking to transfer Wayfinder in its entirety into the hands of the developer, Airship Syndicate.



&quot;“We&#x27;re working with Airship to transition full control of Wayfinder to them in coming months.&quot;




Just a few weeks ago there was a leadership change at Digital Extremes as well, with Chief Creative Officer Steven Sinclair replacing Founder James Schmalz as CEO of the company.


Rough times in the video games industry


These kinds of articles are never easy to write, especially when the video game industry seems to be suffering layoffs several times a week. Just yesterday Embracer Group laid off staff at developer Free Radical, after doing the same just last month at Cryptic Studios and Zen Studios. Ubisoft Montreal also suffered layoffs earlier this week.


This list has grown so big it almost feels easier to name the companies that have not conducted layoffs compared to those that have. According to the website VideoGameLayoffs.com, over 6,500 employees from over 100 companies in the games industry have been laid off this year alone.

                              <span>With Kratos&#x27; vicious past, you wouldn&#x27;t expect a God of War Ragnarok Lo-Fi video to surface. However, PlayStation and a few musicians, including Alex Moukala, have released such a thing, and it&#x27;s relaxing AF.




Chilling out with Atreus


Atreus, in this video published Thursday, takes the place of the kid studying. As the chill music is playing, he&#x27;s writing in his journal. The Lo-Fi beats in the background are from popular musician and composer Alex Moukala and Pokari.


&quot;Earlier this year, Sony asked me to create some God of War: Ragnarok Lo-Fi remixes for them,&quot; Moukala on social media. &quot;As a massive Bear McCreary fan I was overjoyed and simply couldn&#x27;t say no!&quot; The composer later said &quot;the whole process made [him] appreciate God of War&#x27;s soundtrack even more than [he] already did.&quot;


The three McCreary songs both Moukala and Polari remixed are: &quot;Huldra Brothers,&quot; &quot;Memories of Mother,&quot; and the God of War Ragnarök theme. They sound fantastic and are currently powering me through this news story. The animation is also expressive and slightly changes over the span of the 32-minute video. It was drawn and animated by Spud Gun Studios.


Moukala has been busy over the past few years. He&#x27;s behind the soundtrack for the fan-based Final Fantasy IX: Memoria Project and interviewed the Yakuza game composers on his YouTube channel. In the past, he&#x27;s also turned the macabre Bloodborne music into a dazzling Mario Kart track.




God of War: Ragnarok celebrates its one-year anniversary this week. When it was first released, it received critical praise across the board. 


&quot;God of War Ragnarok is a fantastic showcase of what this series has to offer, and a sterling example of how it still has life left in it,&quot; said our review. &quot;While not everything lands with the sequel from a story perspective, the core of the original is preserved, with some new twists and turns still to go.&quot;

                              <span>Hogwarts Legacy kind of came and went earlier this year (twice, if you count the PS4/Xbox One ports), and now it&#x27;s about to release a third time: on Switch. It&#x27;s due out on November 14, and depending on who you ask, the below debut game trailer is either miraculous or messy. It really depends on your taste in Switch ports. The real test is going to be how it plays and if it can maintain a consistent framerate.


Super Crazy Rhythm Castle will offer some counterprogramming. Described as a &quot;chaotic rhythm adventure,&quot; this single-system multiplayer game looks promising. It&#x27;s out on November 14. Plus, a bunch of other games are out between now and the next week, so check them all out below!

Call of Duty is no stranger to having a cheater problem, but MW3 is looking to hopefully remedy some of those issues. In a post on the COD blog, Activision has revealed how they plan to use machine learning to combat cheaters.

The team dedicated to combatting cheating in Call of Duty, Team Ricochet, has developed the Ricochet: Anti-Cheat over the past two years with the existing Call of Duty titles.

                              <span>Taking inspiration from games like Slay the Spire, Alina of the Arena unleashed its gladiatorial combat on PC in 2022. Now it&#x27;s set to launch on consoles later this month.


DANGEN Entertainment and PINIX Games announced plans to bring Alina of the Arena to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and Xbox digital stores on November 23, 2023. In addition to the deckbuilding of Slay the Spire, the devs cite Into the Breach as inspiration. Alina of the Arena blends roguelite elements with hex-based tactics, resource management, and more that unfolds in strategic position-based gladiator battles. You can see a sample of its style in the release date trailer and screens. 




Alina of the Arena follows a gladiator named Alina who aims to entertain a particularly bloodthirsty crowd while rising up the ranks. You can pick up weapons the crowd tosses into the arena, upgrade equipment, and acquire new cards to improve your strategy. Some cards may help Alina deal more damage, while others assist in avoiding attacks or even pitting enemies against one another for a tactical advantage. 


The flow of each level spans standard battles, elite battles, shops, events, and ultimately a showdown with the arena&#x27;s champion. Permanent upgrades can be unlocked along with new builds to give you a fighting chance in successive runs.

Are you not entertained?


Alina of the Arena picked up some accolades following its initial launch on PC. In addition to nominations at events like BitSummit and IndiePlay, it won the Best Design Indie Game Award at Taipei Game Show 2023. Outside of UI updates, it sounds like we can expect the same features that made it a success when it lands on consoles on November 23.

                              <span>Valve has just announced the Steam Deck OLED, due to release in very short order on November 16. Effectively an upgrade to the baseline Steam Deck model, the OLED variant will even have a substantially upgraded battery, making the device that much more appealing.


What&#x27;s particularly interesting here is that as the OLED model of the Steam Deck rolls in, Valve is phasing out the 64 GB and the 512 GB variants of the original device. As of right now, these version of the Deck are only going to stay in stock while supplies last (with an appropriate price drop), and new buyers will be able to purchase the following versions of the device in the future:



256 GB LCD version of the Steam Deck at $399


512 GB OLED version of the Steam Deck at $549


1 TB OLED version of the Steam Deck at $649

                              <span>Do you hate traffic? Do you yearn to punish drivers? Sebil Engineering is a jank-pop game about directing a steady stream of traffic using only terraforming tools. It’s available today on Steam and Itch.


As a pedestrian, cars are my mortal enemy. Unfortunately, so far, my only way of fighting back against them is with my fists. I guess that’s because I chose to write about video games rather than become a civil engineer. According to Sebil Engineering, they are given pipe-wrenches that can increase or decrease the height of nodes on the edges of roads to give traffic a shunt in the correct direction.




Each level begins with a stream of cars pouring in from the margins. Your job is to change the heights of the road to direct that stream to the correct spot. I imagine that’s what getting up to pee at night is like for men.


Sebil Engineering includes more than 40 levels of Lemmings-like carnage. It boasts “high detail traffic simulation” and “realistic civil engineering.” The trailers available support both of those bullet points.


Real talk: I’ve got a lot of steam built up, and Sebil Engineering looks like a good way to let it out. I’m also in love with jank-pop, which is to say, games that look like they match the very worst examples from a bygone era. See also Suburban Basketball and Slayers X: Terminal Aftermath: Vengeance of the Slayer.


Sebil Engineering is available right now for PC on Steam and Itch.io.

                              <span>After a week of nearly nonstop play, I hit a wall with Warcraft Rumble and the grind is in sight. Here&#x27;s how it all went!


Warcraft Rumble (Android, iOS [reviewed on an iPhone 13])
Developer: Blizzard
Publisher: Blizzard
Released: November 3, 2023
MSRP: Free-to-play (with microtransactions)





The core game is fun, but it needs some economy tweaks


Warcraft Rumble is a 1v1 tap-to-deploy lane-based battler that asks you to send units off to micro-wars to take down an opposing headquarters. Your job? To march and destroy the opposite base before your opponent takes out your own, through clever countering and smart resource management. Each unit is associated with a cost (typically dependent on power level), and while your unit coffers recharge automatically, Kobolds can be deployed to mi…</span>

                              <span>A mod now available for One Step From Eden lets players take control of Super Sonic in the popular deck-building roguelike. The mod, developed and released on the Steam Workshop by user SoulCakeLive, comes packaged with 6 spells, a weapon, and an artifact meant to eviscerate your foes left and right. 




“As my way of celebrating the first anniversary of #SonicFrontiers, SUPER SONIC IS NOW PLAYABLE IN @OneStepFromEden!! This includes an outfit swap for Super Sonic 2!” SoulCakeLive said on Twitter.


Super Sonic’s spells available in this mod include:



Super Sonic Wind, a targeted wind ability that moves in a direct line to your opponent.


Super Homing Shot, which sends a barrage of attacks in varying directions.


Super Earth Crash, which halts enemies for 5 seconds.


Maximum Avatar, which sends clones of Super Sonic to attack all enemies on the field.


Mach Burst, which allows you to teleport to an enemy, unleashing a damaging attack.


Time Break, which stops time for 7 seconds and allows you to unleash heck on enemies.



In addition to these spells, this mod also includes a weapon, Super Sonic Boom, which bombards enemies with a non-stop volley of attacks; and an artifact, Chaos Emeralds, which allows players to recover 20HP every 10 seconds during battles.




Also, the mod comes with an outfit swap featuring the Super Sonic 2 design from Sonic Frontiers: The Final Horizon. So, it’s hardly your average asset swap mod, and is more akin to an additional, albeit unofficial, DLC pack for One Step From Eden. 




It would appear this pack has even been noticed by the developer, Thomas Moon Kang. In a response to the original tweet by SoulCakeLive, the account for One Step From Eden replied with “That’s super cool.”

The actor revealed that he and fellow voice actress Cissy Jones, who voices romanceable party member Andreja, were originally hired to voice Starfield&#x27;s protagonist.

The 2TB model is currently discounted over at Amazon US, where you can find it for just $103 rather than its usual $128 - one of the best prices we&#x27;ve recorded for a 2TB drive of this speed and quality.

This particular model used to go for £1200, making it a nice £350 reduction.

                              <span>To quickly recap my Steam Deck OLED review, Valve’s refreshed handheld is brilliant, serving up major improvements to screen quality and battery life while making loads of little quality-of-life tweaks. Its reveal was a surprise, mind – haven’t Valve repeatedly said that there wouldn’t be another new Steam Deck for ages?


Not quite. That warning was always qualified in that a more powerful Deck was still a ways off, and the Steam Deck OLED’s performance improvements are both tiny and a likely incidental result of its efficiency savings. This very point was repeated to me in an interview with Valve designer Jay Shaw and software engineer Jeremy Selan, which also covered the Steam Deck family’s future, its current struggles with intensive big-budget games, and why they want &quot;more, more, more&quot; rivals like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go.

                              <span>While the Steam Deck OLED is awash with upgrades over the original handheld PC, it’s not a full replacement, and Valve still reckon that anyone wanting a proper Steam Deck 2 will be waiting a while. 
I was told as much on the Steam Deck’s first anniversary earlier this year, and according to Valve designer Jay Shaw and software engineer Jeremy Selan, that stance won&#x27;t change once the Steam Deck OLED releases on November 16th. In an RPS interview, the full version of which is coming soon, the two developers explained why the real next generation of Steam Deck will take a few years – and why they decided against making the Steam Deck OLED’s new processor more powerful as well.

                              <span>I didn’t know the Steam Deck OLED existed until last week, and yet it’s essentially something I’ve wanted for nearly two years. As great a handheld gaming PC as the original Steam Deck is, its slightly bland IPS display and short battery life are some definite weak points – points to which newer, shinier rivals, such as the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go, have been happy to apply pressure.
Valve are keen to stress that this OLED-equipped model represents an update, not a whole generational switcheroo. Yet there’s much, much more behind that screen that just some different diodes. This is a lighter, brighter, longer-lasting, sometimes even faster-running take on the SteamOS handheld, and one that sneaks in some surprise upgrades as often as it addresses issues with the original Steam Deck. I love it.

                              <span>Valve love their surprise hardware announcements, and there’s just been a doozy in the Steam Deck OLED. It’s a &quot;definitive&quot; refresh of the existing Steam Deck handheld PC that swaps the underwhelming IPS display for a brighter, more vibrant OLED panel, while making numerous battery life improvements – up to and including a new, more efficient AMD APU – that promise significantly more time away from the mains. It’s not far off either: the Steam Deck OLED’s release date is November 16th, just one week away.

                              <span>For Vladimir Makarov, the babyfaced villain of Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, trust and morale are irrelevant concepts. As he makes clear to his army of Russian ultranationalists, he is interested only in their quiet, unwavering loyalty. Evidently, Activision expects much the same from its army of COD fans. This latest Modern Warfare campaign follows disconcertedly close on the heels of 2022’s entry because, as per Bloomberg, it began life as a mere expansion. Rather than allow a fallow year, Activision has upgraded that expansion’s status to a premium release, and charged $69.99 for pre-orders - granting early access to the single-player campaign as an enticement.


Instead of Modern Warfare’s usual lead studio, Infinity Ward, development duties have fallen to Sledgehammer, the outfit most recently responsible for 2021’s unloved Vanguard. And in an industry where AAA FPS games now regularly take half a decade to make, this campaign has reportedly come together in less than two years. Reader: it shows.

Erm.


Let&#x27;s start again. As you may know, Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 - not to be confused with Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 - is out from today, 9th November. Pre-ordering players and a few lucky journos (whom we absolutely don&#x27;t fear and resent for receiving copies early) have been able to play the campaign since 1st November, and the reactions and reviews thus far haven&#x27;t been great.

                              <span>When Kiryu&#x27;s tale &quot;ended&quot; in Yakuza 6, it left me in absolute tatters. A faked death finally saw him freed from the shackles of the yakuza with one big catch: he couldn&#x27;t ever see his family again. Since then, we&#x27;ve had the plucky Ichiban take on the mantle of Tojo Clan nastiness in Yakuza: Like A Dragon (7), with its sequel Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth (8) set to wash up on Hawaii&#x27;s shores next year. What do we know about Infinite Wealth? Kiryu is set to return as a protagonist alongside Ichiban, with an all-new haircut. And more importantly, what has Like A Dragon Gaiden got to do with any of this? Well, it&#x27;s a shorter stop-gap between the events of Yakuza 6 and Yakuza 8 that fills us in on what Kiryu&#x27;s been up to this whole time.
But aside from moreish minigames and a fantastic Agent persona with web-slinging abilities, Kiryu&#x27;s epilogue is a far cry from Yakuza&#x27;s best stories. By no means is it bad, it just isn&#x27;t the best introduction to the series for newcomers, and even longtime fans will struggle balancing his resurrection with its heavy feelings of repetition.

Still, we can rest assured that it is finally &quot;content complete&quot;.

                              <span>“To be a good designer, you have to have very, very strong opinions,” says Slay The Spire design lead Anthony Giovannetti. “Show me a game designer who gives a thumbs-up to most things, and I suspect that’s probably someone who doesn’t have a very good game design sense. I want someone who really, really loves and hates things, and gives you reasons why.”
It’s a trait which Giovannetti has in common with his Megacrit co-founder, Casey Yano, and has possessed ever since he was a kid growing up in Woodinville, 30 minutes outside Seattle. It’s matched by a competitiveness that first emerged in Warhammer 40,000 tournaments as a teen. Before he was old enough to drive, Giovannetti would ride his bike to the local game store and play until the early hours of the morning.

                              <span>GTA 6 publisher Take-Two Interactive’s CEO Strauss Zelnick has been on the blower to the company’s investors about the idea of making games using the latest artificial intelligence content generation tools. Echoing his relatively guarded enthusiasm for NFTs a couple of years ago, he’s sort of mixed on them, regarding AI tools less as transformative technologies than simply the latest step towards the eternal industry objective of More, Faster And Better For Less.
Zelnick thinks automated learning and generation tools will make development more “efficient” and games, overall “better”, but in terms of Take-Two’s own bottom line, any gains will likely be offset by the fact that other big companies have access to the same tools, and by the fact that Take-Two will take advantage of said efficiencies by setting more ambitious goals. As such, he doesn’t think using generative AI will lead to lower prices for big commercial games. If you’re a developer that can’t afford to buy or license generative “AI” tools, Zelnick added, you can expect competition to become “more intense” in the coming years. Good stuff.

Well, there it is. Nintendo has announced that not only is a Legend of Zelda movie a possibility, but it&#x27;s happening. Shigeru Miyamoto himself took to Twitter to share this news, stating that producer Avi Arad and director Wes Ball are already attached and it will be co-financed by Sony (a fact that we are still wrapping our heads around). Oh, and it is also going to be live-action. Let&#x27;s not forget that bit.
If this were to be announced as an animated film, we would be on board in a heartbeat (heck, we have dreamt about a Studio Ghibli or even Sony Pictures Animation, Spider-Verse take on the series for years now) but live-action cinema comes with its own set of challenges. What does a &#x27;real-life&#x27; Hyrule look like? Who really wants to see a realistically rendered Zora? And perhaps the most pressing issue of all: Who the heck do you cast in these beloved roles?

Publisher Neowiz has launched Sanabi for the Nintendo Switch, and it honestly looks pretty awesome.
It&#x27;s a pixel-art action platformer set in a Cyberpunk-inspired world with stunning neon lights and huge, imposing structures. You play as a legendary retired veteran called upon for one last job (no, not Solid Snake), and you&#x27;ll be wielding your chain-hook prostetic arm to swing across the environment and cut down your enemies.

The latest Japanese Charts are in, courtesy of Famitsu and Gematsu, and it&#x27;s another resounding victory for Super Mario Bros. Wonder. The platformer has shifted a further 108,449 copies to make up a cumulative 910,259. It&#x27;s not unreasonable to assume that the game will cross the 1,000,000 threshold by this time next week.
Elsewhere, We&#x27;ve got three newcomers in the form of Fashion Dreamer, WarioWare: Move It!, and Star Ocean: The Second Story R. Fashion Dreamer just managed to clinch the second spot this week, beating WarioWare by just 1,300 copies. Star Ocean, meanwhile, secured the fourth spot, missing out on number three by just 734 copies. It&#x27;s been an extremely close race, that&#x27;s for sure.

                              <span>Fine finale.
It feels like a lifetime ago since Nintendo announced that it would be expanding Mario Kart 8 Deluxe with the Booster Course Pass, adding a total of 48 courses made up of revamped classics and brand-new additions. But does the expansion end with a bang or a whimper? Well, much like prior waves, we’d say this one lands somewhere in the middle, offering up a bunch of solid circuits mixed in with a few mildly disappointing ones.
Pretty much par for the course, then, but let’s just remind ourselves of what’s included with this one. You’ve got two new cups — the Acorn Cup and the Spiny Cup — made up of three Tour tracks and five ‘legacy’ courses from previous series entries. Oh, and you&#x27;ve four new characters to try out, too. More on those later.

After a long time without a Western release date, The Pokémon Company has today announced that the new animated series, Pokémon Horizons, will be landing in the UK next month on BBC iPlayer and the corresponding children&#x27;s TV channel CBBC.
While we don&#x27;t have a specific release date at the time of writing, though TPC has confirmed that it will be launching on the UK platform in December — so that&#x27;s something, right?

Back in August, there was a report from Nikkei claiming Nintendo&#x27;s new development building had been delayed due to an &quot;expansion plan&quot;.
Nintendo didn&#x27;t officially comment about this at the time, but now within the slides of its latest financial results briefing, it&#x27;s confirmed construction has been up-scaled and is now scheduled to be completed by 2028 instead of 2027.

Atlus&#x27; new tactical RPG Persona 5 Tactica might not be out until next week, but there are apparently some lucky fans out there who have already been able to access and play the game.
As highlighted on social media and elsewhere, it seems the Steam version of the game has gone live a week ahead of its 17th November 2023 launch, enabling fans to check out the game much earlier than expected.

As the name implies, the device boasts an HDR OLED screen to produce more vibrant colors. It also boasts a larger battery for an increased charge – 30-50% more battery life depending on the game, with Valve pointing out that the OLED screen consumes less power.
The device also includes an updated and more efficient AMD APU and Wi-Fi 6E, resulting in downloads up to three times faster for increased bandwidth and lower latency. Steam Deck OLED also runs cooler thanks to its bigger fan and improved thermals. Overall, the device is 5% lighter than the original model.

Originally slated to release in 2021, the project has quietly remained in limbo for years, but developer Thekla Inc. has revealed that it’s finally arriving on April 30. 
Braid was first released for Xbox 360&#x27;s Live Arcade on August 6, 2008, and stars Tim, a boy searching for a princess captured by a monster. The 2D platformer centers on time manipulation mechanics that players utilize to solve puzzles and locate/assemble jigsaw pieces.

A week later, in a quarterly financial results briefing, Sony CFO Hiroki Totoki revealed that PlayStation planned to launch more than 10 live service games by March 2026, with Bungie helping the company in the space. In an earnings call held today, Totoki stated that of its 12 live service games, it will only release six by Fiscal Year 2025, which ends March 2026, as reported by VideoGamesChronicle. 
Earlier this year, Bloomberg reported that Bungie was evaluating some of PlayStation&#x27;s in-development offerings, including Naughty Dog&#x27;s Last of Us multiplayer project, which is reportedly on ice.

                              <span>Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2 hit PlayStation 5 exclusively on October 20 – read Game Informer&#x27;s review here to find out why we loved it so much. It turns out plenty of others enjoyed developer Insomniac Games&#x27; latest superhero effort, too, because Sony has revealed that in just 11 days, it sold through more than 5 million copies, making it one of the year&#x27;s best-selling games.
For context, Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2 outsold Super Mario Bros. Wonder, which is the fastest-selling Super Mario game after selling through 4.3 million copies in two weeks. Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2 was named the fastest-selling PlayStation Studios game just three days after its release, too. 
Woo! We&#x27;re incredibly honored to announce Marvel&#x27;s #SpiderMan2PS5 has sold over 5 MILLION COPIES!

                              <span>Earlier this summer, amid an incoming typhoon, Game Informer visited the Bandai Hobby Center Shinkan, the 132,000-square-foot factory where the entertainment company manufactures its iconic Gundam model kits. If you purchase a new Gundam model kit at your local store today, it originated in this facility in Shizuoka, Japan. The factory contains 35 plastic color-molding machines – 25 electric and 10 hydraulic – all helping produce millions of models yearly.
Bandai Spirits employee Miyuki Nakagiri, the subject matter expert on how exactly the factory operates, escorts us through the building. Our translator during this tour is Atsuo Yoshimura, a video game production manager who’s worked at Bandai Namco for the last 17 years. Notably, Yoshimura worked on last year’s Elden Ring – Game Informer’s 2022 Game of the Year, and most recently, Armored Core VI Fires of Rubicon. Additionally, Yoshimura was instrumental in helping to coordinate Game Informer’s recent Armored Core VI cover story trip.

Police say they seized luxury cars, silver bars, cryptocurrency and cash. Other crimes that make the prosecution much more intriguing are mentioned in much less detail.

                              <span>Intel&#x27;s Core i5 12600KF is one of the company&#x27;s best value gaming CPUs, and today it&#x27;s down to $155 at Walmart (fulfilled via Newegg) versus its standard price of $220. 
This chip offers solid gaming performance in modern AAA games plus PCIe 5.0 and DDR5 support (with the correct motherboard) all while costing significantly less than competing CPUs like the later 13600KF ($285) or AMD&#x27;s Ryzen 5 7600 ($229) which offer only marginally better performance at 1080p and are basically the same speed at 1440p or 4K. 
For reference, I saw the 12600K deliver a minimum of 85% of the performance of the later 13600K (and by extension the nearly identical 14600K), while costing 54% of the price with this deal - surely that makes the 12600K the obvious choice?

                              <span>As regular readers of this column will know, I&#x27;m a big fan of OLED TVs and monitors. One of my favourites is Dell&#x27;s Alienware AW3423DWF, a 34-inch ultrawide that offers a fairly standard 3440x1440 165Hz spec - but its QD-OLED panel makes for a night-and-day difference against your standard VA and IPS panel alternatives, with perfect contrast, near-instant pixel response times, gorgeous colour reproduction and stunning HDR. 
It normally retails for around £929, but today it&#x27;s down to £739 when you use the code GROUPON8 at Dell UK. That&#x27;s about as cheap as we&#x27;ve ever seen it, and well worth it for anyone that wants a monitor primarily for gaming rather than content creation or mixed purposes.

                              <span>Almost five years since it launched - and two years after Epic revealed they hoped to gobble up half of all PC gaming revenue - the Epic Games Store is still yet to turn a profit.

                              <span>When first I played GTA Online back in the Xbox 360 days it felt like an afterthought, a chance to play some random good-for-nothing in GTA 5&#x27;s sizzling alt-Los Angeles, securely cloistered away from the events of the all-important singleplayer story. Having built yourself a no-name crim, you galloped around cranking out cash and XP by means of glorified sidequests handed down by headliners such as Lamar. Skip forward to 2023, and as Alice0 observed when we discussed Rockstar&#x27;s GTA 6 announcements this morning, GTA Online is effectively an MMO with ten years of updates, expansions and community projects under its belt. The no-name crim has become the star attraction.

                              <span>Hallowe’en may be over (just), but for this month’s Reality Frights, I’ve got a wonderfully seasonal game for you. It’s the brand-new remake of the grand old mystery puzzler The 7th Guest, a game which Bill Gates notably referred to as “The new standard of interactive entertainment.” In fairness to ol’ William, he said this seven months before Doom blew out the new standard’s insides with a 12-gauge shotgun, shunting PC gamers’ tastes away from kitsch adventure games and toward grisly murder-fests. But The 7th Guest is nonetheless fondly remembered for its spooky atmosphere, alongside its blend of pre-rendered backgrounds and live action cutscenes you could call ‘pioneering’ had it not proved such an evolutionary dead end.
Today, the original 7th Guest looks more dated than Henry VIII, which is probably why this remake replaces everything but the very skeleton of the 1993 original. The game still takes place in a creepy mansion belonging to a murderous toymaker, and still involves six eccentric guests to the house searching for a missing boy named Tad. But it’s otherwise been completely rebuilt, with whole new puzzles and whole new mechanics, all designed to be experienced in first-person VR.

                              <span>If there&#x27;s one genre I&#x27;ve never quite had the reflexes or spatial awareness for, it&#x27;s the bullet hell shooter. I&#x27;ve long admired their intricate dances of orbs and criss-crossing laser fire, but I have long resigned myself to merely being a spectator of such games, rather than an active ship pilot. Cobalt Core, however, is exactly my kind of speed. It&#x27;s not a bullet hell shooter, but it is about two spaceships facing off against each other in an eyes-locked duel of incoming cannon fire, and sliding side to side to avoid getting exploded as you attempt to unravel the mysterious timeloop your crew of weird space animals appear to be stuck in. Just, you know, in a neat, turn-based fashion, where your opponent&#x27;s attacks are flagged up in advance, and you must use your randomised deck of cards to weave and dodge your way to victory. It&#x27;s very moreish, and very Into The Breach. I love it.

                              <span>Last time, you narrowly decided that soulslike bloodstains are better than ghosts walking through walls. That sounds to me like the decisions of cowards who not only don&#x27;t want to be got by ghosts, they want to be warned about the presence of any danger. Maybe I&#x27;m being ungenerous; maybe what you truly enjoy is watching other people get extremely ghostgot. I cannot deny it is great to watch someone absolutely stack it. Onwards! This week, I ask you to choose between two automatic assists. What&#x27;s better: auto-level up, or auto-detect graphics settings?

The next game from developer Arbitrary Metric, Roman Sands RE:Build, is... very different, at least on the surface.


The first Act of the new Steam demo sees you staggering onto the beach below some kind of tropical resort. You wander up past the pools to the cavernous lobby and are immediately set upon by haggard guests, who appear to think you&#x27;re a member of staff. So you become a member of staff, fetching margaritas, tracking down the check-in ledger and running downstairs to adjust the boiler settings. You earn XP from quests towards employee ranks that unlock useful items at vending machines. And you try to work out what you&#x27;re doing here, and why everybody&#x27;s so terrified of the sun. I haven&#x27;t deciphered the mystery yet.

Updated with the world&#x27;s greatest detective&#x27;s newest adventure on Switch, Murder On The Orient Express, along with our favourite coffee-loving yellow mouse, Detective Pikachu Returns!

Everyone loves a good mystery, and even more so if they&#x27;re the one who gets to solve it. The detective genre has evolved a great deal since its point-and-click adventure game roots, and this list proves how much things have changed. In fact, the games that we&#x27;re including in this list range from typical noir detective fare to the kinds of games that you&#x27;ll probably tell us &quot;don&#x27;t count as detective games&quot; in the comments!

Developer Insomniac Games released a patch last week that addressed a handful of issues and now, it has released a new update that fixes even more bugs and issues.

Each tribe calls one of the Western Frontier’s three biomes – Kinglor Forest, Upper Plains, and Clouded Forest, respectively – home. Ingratiating yourself with each one by learning their ways is an important step in your journey to reclaim your Na’vi culture, as well as garnering enough support to push back against the exploitative mining of the villainous RDA.
For a heads-up on what to expect as you try to warm up to each clan, here’s a breakdown of the culture and personality.

The first clan you encounter resides in the Kinglor Forest. Like the Omatikaya clan from the first film, the Aranahe live in a Hometree and have a symbiotic relationship with Kinglor, …</span>

It&#x27;s been a big week for Nintendo, with the company revealing that Super Mario Bros. Wonder is the fastest-selling Super Mario game in the series and that a live-action Legend of Zelda movie is on the way. We also learned yesterday the Switch has surpassed 132 million units sold on the heels of great results for The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Pikmin 4.

                              <span>Rockstar Games will release the first trailer for its highly anticipated sequel to 2013&#x27;s Grand Theft Auto V, which became the most profitable entertainment product of all time in 2018, next month. As of August, Grand Theft Auto V has sold more than 185 million copies since its release 10 years ago. 
Official news of this trailer from the Rockstar Twitter account comes less than a day after a Bloomberg report that states Rockstar will reveal the sequel, presumably titled Grand Theft Auto VI or Grand Theft Auto 6, this week with a trailer for it arriving sometime next month; Since the release of this report yesterday, Rockstar has confirmed a trailer for the next Grand Theft Auto will, in fact, be released in December. 
We are very excited to let you know that in early December, we will release the first trailer for the next Grand Theft Auto. We look forward to many more years of sharing these experiences with all of you.
November 8, 2023
Game Informer has reached out to Rockstar&#x27;s parent company Take-Two Interactive to ask about this report and reveal and will update the story if more information is learned. 
The journey to the reveal of the next Grand Theft Auto has not happened quietly. In September of last year, unprecedented leaks gave fans a potential look at the sequel in over 90 videos showcasing secret in-development footage of the open-world crime sequel.  We also learned last year that the game reportedly stars a female protagonist. Bloomberg says this Grand Theft Auto V sequel is set in a fictional version of Miami and features the aforementioned female protagonist as well as a male protagonist. 


While waiting to learn more about Rockstar&#x27;s next game, read Game Informer&#x27;s Grand Theft Auto V review and then read our thoughts on Red Dead Redemption II. After that, read Game Informer&#x27;s ranking of every single Rockstar game.

Domain records were modified to use nameservers controlled by United States law enforcement agencies. Just minutes ago, signs of a second wave affecting at least dozens of domains may suggest an unpleasant anniversary surprise for Z-Library.

                              <span>Revenant Hill, the next game by the makers of Night in the Woods, has been canceled. The reason is that the game&#x27;s narrative designer and artist Scott Benson is battling a severe illness that has forced him to step away from the project.
Benson reveals on his personal X account that he’s been suffering severe heart failure over the past 12 months, which has greatly limited his ability to work. You can read his post below. 
So. Over the past 12 months or so I got very sick and it didn&#x27;t go away. Eventually I was diagnosed with severe heart failure, most likely from a virus. It will continue to greatly limit me for the foreseeable future and as such I&#x27;ve had to stop working in the manner I once did.

                              <span>Today, Ubisoft is the latest developer to join 2023&#x27;s wave of layoffs. According to IGN, the company laid off a total of 124 employees. 98 of them were based in Canada, which IGN calculates as roughly 2% of the company&#x27;s Canadian workforce. The cuts included administrative and IT workers, some of whom were employed at the Hybride VFX studio, a company that has worked on shows like Ahsoka and The Mandalorian.


&quot;These are not decisions taken lightly and we are providing comprehensive support for our colleagues who will be leaving Ubisoft during this transition,&quot; the company told both IGN and Kotaku. &quot;We also want to share our utmost gratitude and respect for their many contributions to the company. This restructuring does not affect our production teams.&quot; Another quote obtained by Kotaku claims that the layoffs are to allow Ubisoft to &quot;to optimize its resources to be more sustainable in the long term.&quot;
This news comes after a year of several big Ubisoft releases, including Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage, The Crew: Motorfest, and Just Dance 2024, but that&#x27;s in spite of the fact that they canceled several games this year and delayed Skull and Bones... again. Unrest at the company has been ongoing as well: back in September, IGN reported widespread frustration after employees were suddenly called to return to in-person working conditions.
Ubisoft now joins Bungie, Media Molecule, Telltale Games, Team17, Epic Games, Naughty Dog, Microsoft, and more on the unfortunately long list of companies that have laid people off in the past year.

                              <span>Massive Entertainment is best known as the team behind Tom Clancy’s The Division, but it’s tackling a different beast in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora. This open-world action game unfolds in a new section of James Cameron’s wildly successful Avatar universe, and this new chapter in the mythos graces Game Informer’s cover this month.

We visited Massive’s studio in Malmö, Sweden, to play a couple of hours of the game set in the Kinglor Forest, one of Frontier’s three regions. Our 12-page story also includes an exclusive breakdown of the game’s other two regions, the Upper Plains and the Clouded Forest, which we got to tour during our visit. We interviewed the game’s key design leads to learn how Frontiers of Pandora came to be, what…</span>

He&#x27;s now founded a new studio called Inevitable Studios and the team&#x27;s first game is a narrative-based action platformer called Always in Mind. In it, players must escape their own mind using special powers gained from living out their family&#x27;s stories of the past.
It&#x27;s currently available to wishlist on Steam, indicating a PC release, but there&#x27;s no word about consoles. However, the announcement comes with news that a Kickstarter for Always in Mind is coming soon.

                              <span>At Apple&#x27;s keynote event last September, everyone expected them to announce the new iPhone, but nobody expected them to announce that multiple Resident Evil games would be headed to the device. Resident Evil Village hit the App Store just last week, and today, Capcom has let us know when Resident Evil 4 Remake is coming to the platform: December 20. You can see some screenshots from the Apple port below. 

The game won&#x27;t be available to all iPhone owners, however. Resident Evil 4 Remake will only be available on the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, meaning you&#x27;ll have to grab the newest product in order to play this game on the go. That said, it will also be available on iPads and Macs with the M1 chip or later. If you&#x27;re a diehard Apple fan and have multiple RE4 Remake compatible products, you&#x27;ll be happy to know that the game also supports cross-progression between Apple devices, so you can start a save file on your Mac at home and pick it up on your phone when you&#x27;re on the go.
The game is available for pre-order on the App Store now, but players will be able to start the game for free before committing to a full purchase. Its recently released DLC, Separate Ways, will launch alongside it as well. While we haven&#x27;t been able to go hands-on with this version of the game quite yet, we like Resident Evil 4 Remake quite a lot: you can read our review for it right here.</span>

When the original Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl came out in 2021, it was a relatively bare-bones experience, but those bones were solid. Despite lacking many single-player modes, items, and even character voices, the core gameplay was good enough to keep the game afloat until it received refinements via online updates over the next two years. Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2, however, comes packaged with all those improvements and more. Developer Fair Play Labs has learned its lessons, and while the game isn&#x27;t without its faults, it&#x27;s a more-than-worthy follow-up.
Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2 starts you off with 25 characters, which is the same amount currently a…</span>

                              <span>Lords of the Fallen, the spiritual successor to 2014&#x27;s Soulslike with the same name, hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC last month – you can read Game Informer&#x27;s Lords of the Fallen review here. After a recent patch a few weeks ago that made the game easier and added in some Halloween festivity, developer Hexworks and publisher CI Games have released its schedule of content for the game and it includes new questlines, two new events, more armor and weapons, and more. 
The roadmap also includes a &quot;regular weekly cadence of updates focusing on bringing further stability, performance optimization, and balancing improvements to the game, including its online crossplay experience.&quot; 


Stopping short of specifics, Hexworks says before the year&#x27;s end, it will add multiple new quest lines to Lords of the Fallen, with the opportunity to unlock some unique armor sets and weapons. The studio says some of this armor and weaponry has been co-created with the community during recent collaborative livestreams. Plus, the studio says &quot;players can look forward to 12 new spells, new finisher attacks, and a whole host of community-requested features, including the recently revealed New Game Plus (NG+) modifier system – a first for the genre, and highly anticipated by the Lords of the Fallen community.&quot; 
&quot;At Hexworks, we&#x27;re incredibly proud of the open relationship we&#x27;re fostering with our community,&quot; studio head Saül Gascon writes in a press release. &quot;We are actively listening to their constructive feedback and working diligently to deliver what we believe, collectively, will elevate Lords of the Fallen further. Every addition to the game is a labor of love, as we strive to push both it and the genre&#x27;s boundaries.&quot;

Since its October 27 release, Remedy has released three updates, including its biggest yet last week, for the game so far. And now, a fourth update is live and while it&#x27;s one of the smallest yet, it fixes a few key issues.


Alan Wake 2 Update 1.0.9 
PlayStation 5: Update 1.00.09
Xbox Series X/S: Update 1.0.0.9
PC: Update 1.0.9
Xbox Series – A workaround fix for the issue where the audio cut out intermittently in the Prologue. We are expecting a full fix for this issue in an upcoming update.
Room 665 – Fixed an issue (again) with the Echo scene not aligning and unlocking correctly (this was fixed in the previous update, but Echo hell still persisted)  
Local Girl – Fixed an issue with a mouse (with a big presence) blocking progress.
And that&#x27;s everything in the latest Alan Wake 2 update. Catch up on everything the Alan Wake 2 update from last week fixed with the game here.

                              <span>The Switch continues to inch closer to becoming Nintendo&#x27;s best-selling hardware ever, as it has now surpassed 132 million units sold. It did so thanks to great software sales for new first-party games released this year like The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Pikmin 4. 
This news comes from Nintendo&#x27;s Fiscal Year 2024 second quarter financial results, which ended September 30. In it, we learn the Switch has officially reached 132.46 million units sold, getting it closer to the company&#x27;s best-selling hardware, the Nintendo DS at 154.02 million units sold. The only other console above the DS overall is the PlayStation 2 at roughly 158 million units sold. 


It&#x27;s possible the Switch reaches the DS&#x27; numbers, assuming a new-gen console doesn&#x27;t end sales of the hardware. And consider…</span>

                              <span>Mechanical gaming keyboards used to be premium options available to very few, but now they often go on sale for extremely low prices - even from big names. Today HyperX joins that list of big-name bargains with their Alloy Origins full-size mechanical keyboard dropping to just $32 when bought from GameStop in the US, versus its original price of $109.99. That&#x27;s a great bargain for a keyboard with red (soft linear) mechanical switches, optional RGB lighting and a high-quality metal chassis.

They&#x27;re currently offering both a range of keyboard-and-mouse bundles and sales on individual products, so I thought I&#x27;d take a look at the sale and recommend a few items that I&#x27;ve personally tested and have recommended for Digital Foundry. Let&#x27;s go!

I therefore look at co-op survival game Enshrouded, with its voxel building, grapple hooks, wingsuits, and think: pah, what tomfoolery. This looks fun. Not at all my sort of thing. It might be yours, though. It&#x27;s now got a January 24th release date and a new trailer, below.

The word &quot;anacrusis&quot; refers to a set of syllables that precede the first metrical foot in a line of poetry - an intriguing moniker for a game that is essentially Valve&#x27;s Left 4 Dead, but set in a 1970s-styled high tech facility reminiscent of No One Lives Forever. I&#x27;ll be honest, I haven&#x27;t been keeping up with The Anacrusis, and assumed that it was one of those top-drawer philosophical puzzlers. Come on, there isn&#x27;t even a pun in the title!

                              <span>Hello folks. I know we&#x27;ve barely broken out of spooky season, but over in the RPS Treehouse we&#x27;re rapidly preparing to warm up our vocal chords and bellow &quot;It&#x27;s CHRIIIIIIIISTMASSSSSS&quot; from the rooftops in the spirit of Slade&#x27;s seasonal epic. That&#x27;s right. Advent Calendar season is upon us, and we&#x27;ll be voting for our favourite games of the year very shortly. So I thought I&#x27;d use this month&#x27;s Letter From The Editor to give you a little behind the scenes glimpse of how we&#x27;ll be doing this in the coming weeks, and how we generally go about putting it all together every year.

                              <span>Medieval multiplayer clangfest Chivalry 2 gets a free Reclamation update today, the cherry on the cake of which - knob on the coronet? Prong on the portculis? Ah wait, jewel in the crown! - is new 64-player map The Reclamation of Montcrux, in which the rampaging Agathians attempt to overrun a fort held by the Tenosians, pitting petard against bombard, battering ram against ballista. 


Gosh, that&#x27;s a lot of medieval words. The translation is that one side has to run up the hill screaming while the other side lobs big balls of fire at them. Bash your way into the castle and you&#x27;ll be able to stop the aforesaid rain of fireballs, though you&#x27;ll still have to worry about getting dinged upside the headbone by dudes in plate. Onward, friends to the next paragraph! We have nothing to lose but our limbs!

                              <span>Early on in The Talos Principle 2, one of your soon-to-be robot pals says to you with a completely straight face, &quot;We&#x27;re here to solve this puzzle, not to discuss philosophy.&quot; I can almost see Croteam&#x27;s writing team now, chuckling inwardly to themselves as they do a big silent wink to camera from behind the robot&#x27;s eyes. You&#x27;re not fooling me, Croteam. I&#x27;m here to solve puzzles and discuss philosophy, and I know you are too. You can&#x27;t stop talking about philosophy in this game, and frankly, I wouldn&#x27;t have it any other way. 
Millenia may have passed since the events of The Talos Principle, but the problems faced by this new society of advanced robo-humans (of which you are number 1000 to be &#x27;born&#x27; into this world) still feel all too relevant to the issues posed by the lives we&#x27;re living today: what is the price of progress? Will we ignore the mistakes of the past and push the world toward irreparable destruction? And why have cats remained loyal to this new race of robo-people, cementing their status as the superior future pet, when dogs have devolved back into vicious wolves? There are some puzzles too, I guess. Those are pretty great as well.

The developers in question are a mixture of former full-time staff and former Keywords Studios QA testers who have worked on Dreadwolf under contract. They&#x27;ve organised pickets outside BioWare Edmonton&#x27;s offices in Canada, and are calling on BioWare fans to get involved on social media, while trying to engage current BioWare staff in conversation about unionisation.

                              <span>PlayStation integration with X (formerly known as Twitter) is ending for PS5 and PS4 next week via a new update. That means users will no longer be able to directly upload screenshots and video clips from the console to the social media site.
An announcement update posted to the PlayStation Support page states that on Monday, November 13, X integration will end, which includes the ability to “view any content published on X on PS5/PS4, and the ability to post and view content, trophies, and other gameplay-related activities on X directly from PS5/PS4 (or link an X account to do so).”
While a bummer for those who make frequent use of this feature, which offers a simple method of posting gameplay content to the platform, there are a couple of more involved alternatives depending on your platform. If you’re a PS5 user, you can still use the PlayStation mobile app to upload gameplay captures to then post on X. You can read how to do that here. PS4 users have to rely on ShareFactory and do a bit more work, and you can read those steps here.
Microsoft made the same move in April by disabling sharing to X directly from the console and instructing players to instead use the Xbox app on mobile (with some speculating the decision was made to avoid paying the platform&#x27;s then-new monthly application programming interface (API) fee). This now means that the Switch will become the sole console that supports direct media sharing to X. 
What do you think about the decision to end X integration? Did you use this feature regularly? Let us know in the comments!</span>

                              <span>Blizzard Entertainment has revealed that the first expansion for Diablo IV is called Vessel of Hatred, and it hits the game late next year. The Diablo team revealed this news over the weekend during BlizzCon 2023, which is also where we learned about three new World of Warcraft expansions and three new Overwatch 2 heroes coming to the game. 
During BlizzCon 2023, Blizzard kept Vessel of Hatred details light, stating it will share more details next summer. As for what to expect, it features a campaign that continues the dark tale that began in Diablo IV. &quot;Vessel of Hatred brings players back to learn the fate of the prime evil Mephisto and his demonic plans for Sanctuary,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;Travel to the lush jungles known by the locals as Nahantu.&quot; 
Check out the Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred expansion announcement trailer for yourself below: 


Blizzard says Vessel of Hatred will allow players to traverse an exotic new region, vanquish new evils, and perhaps most excitingly, explore fresh ways to kill demons and loot chests with a completely new Class &quot;never seen before in the Diablo universe.&quot; 
And that&#x27;s all Blizzard shared about Vessel of Hatred. Diablo IV&#x27;s first expansion is due out in late 2024. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer&#x27;s Diablo IV review and then check out this story about how Diablo IV (and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III) won&#x27;t be coming to Xbox Game Pass this year, even though Xbox now owns Activision Blizzard. Read about the ongoing Diablo IV Season of Blood after that.

Lightning McQueen is also an extra special release.

Like in the Cars Pixar franchise, Lightning McQueen will look around the pitch while you cruise the Arena, narrow his eyes as you focus his speed, and react with each score. &quot;With the Lightning McQueen Mega Bundle, you&#x27;ll be able to play as three different versions of the Route 66 icon,&quot; a blog post reads. &quot;First up is the Rust-eze Decal.

                              <span>Blizzard Entertainment has revealed the next three heroes of Overwatch 2, including Mauga, a new duel-wielding tank hero that hits the game next month. Plus, the Overwatch 2 team teased a new DPS hero and Support hero hitting the roster sometime down the line. 
Mauga was actually playable for free as a part of a limited-time trial run for the tank hero this past weekend, but he&#x27;s already out of the game; his real debut happens alongside Overwatch 2&#x27;s Season 8 launch on December 5. &quot;Equipped with two chain guns (Gunny and Cha-Cha), Mauga is ready to bash through the front lines of his opponents and tear through anyone that stands in his way with tons of fire-power,&quot; Blizzard says about the hero. 
Watch the official Mauga gameplay trailer below: 


Here are some additional Mauga screens from Overwatch 2: 

Elsewhere during the Overwatch 2 BlizzCon 2023 presentation, which is where Mauga was revealed, Blizzard pulled back the curtains on two more heroes coming to the game sometime in the future. The first is a DPS hero named Venture, with a unique Splatoon-ish weapon: 
The second is a new support hero codenamed Space Ranger, and given this hero does not yet have an official title, it&#x27;s the hero we&#x27;re expecting to debut in Overwatch 2 last out of these new ones. 
The final piece of Overwatch 2 from BlizzCon 2023 is Clash, a new PvP mode where two teams are tasked with capturing five distinct points on a map. Perhaps most excitingly, Blizzard is bringing back Overwatch map Hanamura as playable in Clash, except under the new name Hanaoka. Here&#x27;s a look at Hanaoka below: 
For more about BlizzCon 2023, read about the three World of Warcraft expansions announced during the event. After that, read Game Informer&#x27;s Overwatch 2 review, and then check out our Diablo IV review.

                              <span>Blizzard Entertainment revealed three new World of Warcraft expansions this weekend during BlizzCon 2023, starting with The War Within, which launches next year. Midnight will follow it in the new Worldsoul Saga, which the studio is calling an &quot;ambitious creative endeavor for the Warcraft universe,&quot; and The Last Titan will release after that. Together, The War Within, Midnight, and The Last Titan make up the Worldsoul Saga. 

&quot;Deep beneath the surface, an ancient Nerubian civilization is rising to power, aided by Xal&#x27;atath, the harbinger of the Void first introduced in the Legion expansion,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;Players will need to enlist the aid of the Earthen, a new allied race available to both Horde and Alliance players, as they make their way deeper and discover an entirely new wo…</span>

As far as pitches go, Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name, the next game in what used to be called the Yakuza series, is hard to beat: Find out what happened to series protagonist Kiryu Kazuma between Yakuza 6: The Song of Life and Yakuza: Like a Dragon. The former ended with Kiryu faking his death to keep his adopted family of orphans safe. The idea was his story was over – he was moving on to the next chapter of his life. Developer Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio pitched it as such. Until the latter, when he …</span>

                              <span>Earlier this year, we spent time with tha ltd. and Enhance Experience, the creative teams behind Humanity, for a documentary on the game&#x27;s development.
While, on its surface, Humanity is a puzzle game about leading groups of people to a goal, as its name implies, its story wrestles with ideas of what it means to be human, the nature of groups, and why we always seem to resort to violence. Humanity&#x27;s story reflects real-world events, showing us the paths we&#x27;re currently on.
Watch The Documentary:


&quot;Soon after we began making Humanity, a number of big events and movements broke out around the world,&quot; Enhance founder and CEO Tetsuya Mizuguchi tells us. &quot;There were human rights movements, the Hong Kong protests, [and] then there was the pandemic. And war soon followed in Ukraine. We had no idea how quickly and deeply AI would infiltrate our society either. I think all these things found their way into the core of Humanity. That question, for example, &#x27;What is humanity? What is human nature?&#x27; We would often talk about how people, looked at individually, are good. There are so many wonderful people out there. But when they become a group, or a nation, or even just big groups, at that level, something happens. It&#x27;s like a different switch gets flipped. And what you see there, that is what we&#x27;re trying to depict in Humanity.&quot;
Watch above or over on Game Informer&#x27;s YouTube channel to see the full documentary about the making of Humanity. &quot;Violence Is Inevitable&quot; speaks to the core creative team, including Mizuguchi and tha creative director Yugo Nakamura, about the project&#x27;s origins, its complications and lengthy development cycle, and how it came to show us the nature of humanity.</span>

                              <span>Epic Games launched Fortnite Battle Royale in 2017 and if you followed the game back then, you likely know that every other week, there was news that Fortnite had its biggest day ever in terms of player count and other impressive metrics. Now, more than six years later, Fortnite has had its biggest day ever again, bringing in 44.7 million players and 102 million hours of play on Saturday, November 4. 
Epic Games tweeted this record over the weekend, calling it the biggest day in Fortnite&#x27;s history before thanking Fortnite and OG players.
Way to start things off with a big bang 💥
#FortniteOG. Yesterday was the biggest day in Fortnite’s history with over 44.7 MILLION players jumping in and 102 MILLION hours of play.
November 5, 2023
As for why, Epic doesn&#x27;t list a specific reason but it&#x27;s pretty clear it&#x27;s because of the new season itself. Dubbed Season OG, a short one-month-long season of Fortnite brings players back to the Chapter 1 map for some throwback battle royale nostalgia. Plus, near-weekly updates will take players on a journey from Chapter 1: Season 5 all the way to Chapter 1: Season X. 
Check out Game Informer&#x27;s breakdown of everything you need to know about Fortnite&#x27;s Season OG. After that, check out the first official throwback teaser Epic released and then watch this nostalgic Tilted Towers video.

In a game where play time counts can end up in the hundreds of hours, that’s a fairly terrifying prospect.

                              <span>Fortnite returned to its map circa 2018 (or Chapter 1 Season 5 if you prefer to measure time that way) last Friday, reviving locations like Tilted Towers, Loot Lake and Greasy Grove and unlocking the battle royale game’s vaulted weapons, vehicles and items in a four-week nostalgic event dubbed Season OG. As it turns out, with the old map and items came a whole lot of players, setting a new all-time concurrent player record for the multiplayer shooter that surpasses even its previous heights in the pop-culture zeitgeist.

                              <span>Cryptic Studios, the makers of MMOs including Star Trek Online and Dungeons &amp; Dragons MMORPG Neverwinter, have confirmed a number of layoffs due to the ongoing “comprehensive restructuring” of megacorp owner Embracer Group. The “personnel changes” at Cryptic make them the latest Embracer-owned developer to suffer job losses in what continues to be an unrelenting year for thousands of those working in video games.

                              <span>Much like Weyland-Yutani linking arms with Skynet, Microsoft have teamed up with Inworld to bring the latter&#x27;s &quot;generative AI&quot; tools to Xbox studios. This &quot;multi-year co-development partnership&quot; will &quot;build a powerful toolkit that harnesses artificial intelligence to enrich the narrative and character creation elements of game development&quot;, according to Inworld CEO Ilya Gelfenbeyn. You might recognise Inworld as the tech used by that GTA 5 mod about AI cultists in which characters speak AI-generated dialogue, which Rockstar blocked from distribution over the summer. Suffice to say that Microsoft have grander plans for it.

                              <span>When I reviewed Hunt: Showdown for a different parish back in 2019, it was a swampy, stealthy, slow-paced extraction FPS that consisted of weaving through mouldy undead and pockets of inconveniently noisy wildlife, ears pricked for the rustle of a rival player in the bushes. It was a game in which every footfall felt like a gamble and every second lasted an eternity, even before you entered the lair of a giant spider. Fast  forward to 2023, and streamers are playing Hunt: Showdown like it&#x27;s Titanfall 2, scurrying along walls with scant regard for the NPC cannon fodder below, duelling each other on rooftops with pistol shotguns, and tearing through those poor, befuddled boss monsters like sandcastles.


Thus the fate of any competitive shooter lucky enough to acquire a seasoned pro following, I guess. But still, returning to Crytek&#x27;s PvPvE shooter has been a shock, and speaking to the development team, it sounds like the devs themselves have been struggling to keep up with the more ambitious players, too. Showdown was never expected to endure quite this long and evolve in quite this way, according to general manager David Fifield, and managing the community&#x27;s ambitions for the game is as much of a challenge as compensating for the limitations of its ageing engine.

                              <span>While reviewing Cities Colon Skylines 2, I didn&#x27;t actually go in that hard on public transport (beyond providing it and making it free), despite the urge. Since then though, it&#x27;s become a game where I don&#x27;t so much build a single mega-city as a series of experiments.
Naturally, those experiments devolved from a noble effort to remove the stain of cars into a sadistic urge to drive thousands of my own people on a never-ending hell march.

                              <span>Hello folks. A small bit of RPS Game Club news today. Since it&#x27;s starting to get toward end of the year season, Game Club will be taking a short break for the next two months. That means we won&#x27;t be running it this month (November), or next month (December). We will, however, be returning with a fresh set of monthly game selections in 2024, so you can look forward to more group play-a-longs and liveblog chats early next year.
In the meantime, though, we hope you&#x27;ve enjoyed this first year&#x27;s outing of the RPS Game Club, and we&#x27;d love to get some feedback on it for how we can improve next year. Regardless of whether you&#x27;re a regular Game Clubber or have only ever watched it from afar, please come and join in the discussion below to help us make it even better.

                              <span>In 2021, Twitter user Thomas Violence, an Australian podcaster who was working in a bar at the time, recounted that a 19-year-old had asked for a refund on their drink because they realised they were too drunk already. One of the early replies was an &quot;ummm actually,&quot; pointing out that you had to be 21 to buy booze in most states, and Thomas Violence responded &quot;I&#x27;m one of the dozens of people worldwide that live in a country that&#x27;s not America&quot;. I am reminded of this tweet a lot, and I am reminded of it whenever I log on to Puzzmo, a new daily browser-based puzzle service from Orta Therox and Zach &quot;Zach Gage&quot; Gage.
Puzzmo is great, and currently in a sort of gradually expanding beta where you can sign up to get a chance to be sent a log-in, or existing users can give two friends a log-in (I have used mine already, sorry). Every day you get a few different puzzles, with a subscription model offering bonus puzzles. I&#x27;ve not subbed because I&#x27;m just not built for anagram puzzles and I do not understand chess, which form about half of the daily offering, but I enjoy doing the daily fliparts and crosswords a lot. Except. The crosswords always have clues that are very specific to the USA.

                              <span>Mad dashes, daring escapes, last minute reversals: these are some of my favourite moments in multiplayer shooters. It’s exhilarating to scream towards the chopper in Left 4 Dead or a dropship in Titanfall. 

The Finals is a multiplayer shooter that seems to take place entirely at this elevated pitch. In the dozens of open beta matches I&#x27;ve played, the result is as thrilling as those other games, but also exhausting. I wish it would chill for just a moment so I could fully enjoy its delights - of which there are many.

                              <span>Every weekend, indie devs show off current work on Twitter&#x27;s #screenshotsaturday tag. And every Monday, I bring you a selection of these snaps and clips. This week, my eye has been kicking doors, clicking on shoes to walk, running along walls, and fiddling with buttons on a television in space. Come check out these attractive and interesting indie games, and more!

                              <span>Devolver have released a Let&#x27;s Play for robo-philosophical puzzler The Talos Principle 2 in which the Let&#x27;s Player is GLaDOS, nemesis of Valve&#x27;s Portal games, with which The Talos Principle has a few things in common. They&#x27;ve brought on original Portal voice actress Ellen McClain to narrate the footage, and the result is genuinely quite funny. As you&#x27;d expect, GlaDOS isn&#x27;t that impressed by Croteam&#x27;s work. I score this a 7/10 on the Hoot And/Or Holler scale.

Specifically it says &quot;fan favourite character, Pyramid Head, makes a return along with a special origin story for fans to play through.&quot; That&#x27;s pretty much all she wrote, where the much vaunted &quot;news-reporting&quot; aspect of this news article is concerned.

                              <span>In October we revealed details of a DMCA subpoena application filed by Naver Webtoon in the United States which listed over 350 &#x27;pirate&#x27; domains offering the company&#x27;s comics illegally. Late last week, Naver suggested that after obtaining site operators&#x27; personal details from Cloudflare, around 150 sites with 2.5 billion annual visits subsequently shut down. While that&#x27;s a huge claim, just one of those sites accounted for three quarters of a billion visits.

                              <span>Opinions vary on whether 2005&#x27;s Boiling Point: Road To Hell was ever, could ever have been, a good game. What&#x27;s clear is that it was interesting, both as an early example of an open-world RPG and as an infamously broken example of Eurojank. Now it&#x27;s getting a re-release in just ten days and I&#x27;m fascinated to know whether a Boiling Point with fewer bugs has anything to offer the world in 2023.

That&#x27;s because Vessel Of Hatred is all about one of the Prime Evils, Mephisto, who auld players would have slain in that most-beloved of hack-and-slashers. It&#x27;s also going to add a new character class &quot;never before seen in the Diablo universe.&quot;

Copyright holders, their agents, &quot;and/or any other person&quot; may file a complaint by filling in what appears to be a paper form. The Ministry adds that if the complainant isn&#x27;t a copyright holder or hasn&#x27;t been authorized by one, individual hearings may be considered on a case-by-case basis.

The truncated Fortnite Chapter 4 Season OG - which will last just four weeks, rather than the usual three months - has also restored the game’s original map as seen in Chapter 1, meaning the return of places like Tilted Towers, Loot Lake and Greasy Grove.

That&#x27;s according to developer Poncle, who are clearly in a whimsical mood this week. After all, if there&#x27;s one thing this game about auto-massacring ever larger crowds of kamikaze night creatures has been lacking, it&#x27;s some proper narrative context.

                              <span>Readers, I must tell you something. If you&#x27;re currently playing Alan Wake 2 and haven&#x27;t continued with Alan&#x27;s part of the story after reaching the point where you can switch between him and Saga, STOP WHAT YOU&#x27;RE DOING IMMEDIATELY. 
I know Saga&#x27;s an infinitely better hang than Alan, but trust me on this. You are ignoring what is arguably the best 15 minutes of video game you&#x27;ll play all year. Don&#x27;t make the same mistake I did and play as Saga for 20 hours, only to realise that this utter masterpiece of a level was sitting here the entire time. Do the right thing. Continue Alan&#x27;s story. You won&#x27;t regret it (and spoilers to follow below, obvs).

You&#x27;ve surely seen a hundred post-Minecraft games about building a base to smelt iron to build a base, and probably even thought to yourself that they look entirely fine but kind of... redundant? There&#x27;s only so many times you can walk back and forth from a cave to a forge.
But what if instead of trudging around a grey cave, you were driving a big drilling machine instead? It&#x27;s so simple, and yet it makes all the difference in GeoDepths.

                              <span>Final Fantasy XIV’s world of Eorzea is a utopia. Sure, there’s the looming threat of Garlean invasion and/or the possibility of world destruction throughout A Realm Reborn and its expansions - but on the plus side, almost everyone you meet is up for a round of cards.


Over the last quarter-century, Triple Triad has managed to escape its origins as a fun side minigame in Final Fantasy VIII to become a fully-fledged phenomenon in XIV. The Gold Saucer runs regular tournaments, random strangers are happy to be challenged to a match - often throwing in one or more of the game’s many variant rules (though Chaos can do one) - and might even give up one of their prized cards when defeated, with almost 400 to collect as of the game’s latest patches. Emphasis on the “might”: I dread to think of the hours spent replaying NPCs in the hope of a random drop as I filled out my collection.

I headed along to Final Fantasy’s London Fan Fest last month with a fetching deck of Triple Triad cards in hand. (Square Enix provided entrance and accommodation for the event.) Where better to try and live the dream of challenging random strangers to a card game, and learn more about the community that has fallen in love with the MMO in the 10 years since A Realm Reborn released?

                              <span>Pull switches, press buttons, unscrew panels, mix chemicals, switch broken parts, and pray that following procedure is enough to save you from impossible horrors. That&#x27;s the fun of Unsorted Horror, a cracking free collection of short first-person horror games with dramatic, doomful scenarios and big, weird machines. No, absolutely you do not get a gun. If you enjoy figuring out how doodads work while feeling like the world has possibly already ended and everyone just kept on going, do play!

Released today, it gives you a massive, gloomy map full of towering, greeny-black Gothic structures that are packed with backstory documents, but contain absolutely no enemies. The only thing separating you from all that winding, lore-drenched architecture is distance. Check out the trailer below.

                              <span>I have a confession to make, readers. I&#x27;m mildly obsessed with Starfield&#x27;s cuboid food brand Chunks. In all honesty, I&#x27;m kinda obsessed with Starfield&#x27;s food in a more general sense, and I have almost as many screenshots of its tube-like meal boxes, stale toast slices, vacuum-packed sachets of rice balls, steak slabs and spiced worms - and, of course, Chunks - as I do its planets and NPCs. I&#x27;m weirdly fascinated by what Bethesda think our future meals will look like when we eventually start travelling across the stars, and not just because I like ragging on their somewhat plastic-looking textures and marvelling at how everything from orange juice to beer and wine comes in kid&#x27;s size cartons with a little straw on the side. 
Chunks are my favourite food of the lot, though. These cubes of faintly glistening organic matter are bite-sized monstrosities that are quite possibly some of the most unholy things I&#x27;ve ever seen. How this became the dominating foodstuff across the known galaxy is a mystery worthy of its own sidequest, because let&#x27;s be honest, I&#x27;m all for eating wonky fruit and vegetables, but would you truly go to shop, sit down at a table and order an apple that&#x27;s been squeezed into a perfect cube? Or a cube with yellow skin that professes to call itself grilled chicken? I would probably try them once for curiosity&#x27;s sake (it&#x27;s the food of the future, of course I want to know what that tastes like!), but it&#x27;s also exactly the kind of thing I&#x27;d swear off immediately because nope, nuh uh, I just can&#x27;t even contemplate it anymore. And then it dawned on me: this is exactly how I feel about Starfield as a whole.

Activision have now posted an explanation for the heavier footprint of this year&#x27;s Call of Duty, while pointing out that you can customise your install to lighten the load.

                              <span>Earlier this year, HBO&#x27;s The Last of Us successfully brought developer Naughty Dog&#x27;s critically acclaimed and fan-favorite PlayStation exclusive to life on the TV screen. Its Season 1 premiere was HBO&#x27;s second-largest debut since 2010, and its second episode broke records, too. Roughly three weeks after the premiere of the series, HBO revealed The Last of Us would be getting a second season. And now, thanks to a new Deadline report, we know it will start shooting next year and premiere sometime in 2025. 
Deadline learned this at a New York news event, where HBO boss Casey Bloys reportedly told press that Season 2 will head into production early next year, aiming for a 2025 premiere. Unfortunately, that&#x27;s all Bloys said about the season. But, as noted by Deadline, series co-creator and executive producer Craig Mazin revealed earlier this summer pre-strike that the team was already able to get some work done, adding that the first episode was already written. 


&quot;We got pretty far actually, we were doing great,&quot; Mazin told Deadline. &quot;[The Last of Us game co-creator Neil Druckmann] and I had been sitting and talking with [The Last of Us Part II co-writer Halley Gross] and Bo Shim, the new writer that was in our little tiny room with us – obviously not a mini room because we&#x27;re greenlit proper, we&#x27;re a real show, and because I hate that mini room stuff.&quot;
Considering the first season of The Last of Us covered the events of the first Last of Us game, including its Left Behind DLC, it&#x27;s clear Season 2 of the show will dive into The Last of Us Part II. We&#x27;re all still awaiting some casting announcements, like who will play Abby and Lev, but that likely won&#x27;t happen until the actor and writer strikes are over. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer&#x27;s The Last of Us Part 1 review and then read our review of The Last of Us Part II.

                              <span>Fortnite Chapter 4: Season OG goes live in a few hours once its downtime is complete, and it brings players back to 2018&#x27;s Chapter 1 map, with throwback weapons, loot, vehicles, and more, too. While it&#x27;s technically Season 5 of Fortnite Chapter 4, which follows the previous Last Resort season, developer Epic Games is calling it Season OG, and it makes sense considering how much of Fortnite 2018 is making an appearance.
The throwback nostalgia continues throughout the season because each new update brings with it a different phase of Fortnite Chapter 1&#x27;s past, starting with Season 5. That means weapons like the Assault Rifle and Pump Shotgun, and vehicles like Shopping Carts, will be featured in both Zero Build and regular Battle Royale Fortnite.

WarioWare: Move It is full of truly surprising games that take advantage of the Switch&#x27;s unique control options, but it&#x27;s arguably always the most fun to see what retro Nintendo games make it into any WarioWare collection.
Join Brian Shea and me as we go through all of them and even see what some of the game&#x27;s look like when played at their second and third tier.

RoboCop: Rogue City is likely the best game the action hero has ever starred in. That bar isn’t tough to hurdle, but the adventure delivers plenty of thrills for fans to be excited about. This narrative-driven first-person shooter has a loving reverence for the films and a good understanding of its protagonist, swinging for the fences with a lengthy original story, fun references, and plenty of enjoyably cheesy humor. Unfortunately, like the franchise’s vision of Detroit, Rogue City is very rough around the edges, resulting in a flawe…</span>

                              <span>&quot;Star Ocean&quot; is a fantastic name, evoking a sense of adventure, 16-bit blue skies, the majesty of space. &quot;The Second Story R&quot; is a terrible subtitle, evoking WhatsApp messages where I accidentally press &#x27;send&#x27; too soon. Combined they produce Star Ocean: The Second Story R, a beautiful-seeming 2.5D remake of a Square Enix PlayStation JRPG. It&#x27;s out on Steam now and there&#x27;s a demo.

That&#x27;s when the For Rent expansion will launch, adding multi-family lots so you can construct apartment buildings, rent out your spare basement, or have an authentically terrible time as a tenant.

                              <span>Like when Sir Alex Ferguson oversaw his final game at Old Trafford, there’s a complicated atmosphere surrounding this year’s Football Manager. Football Manager 2024 is the last iterative game in the series before Project Dragonfly arrives next year, through which Sports Interactive plan the most radical overhaul of the game since the introduction of the 3D match engine in FM 09. This includes a complete rebuild of Football Manager in Unity, implementing brand new animation technology, and the inclusion of women’s football. But there is a reason why the studio has stuck with this tried and tested formula for so long. Big changes come with big risks, and as any Man Utd fan will know, those changes don’t always pay off.


But such concerns are for the future. FM24 is with us right now, and while it may be swapping the dugout for the stands ninety minutes from now, this isn’t some ceremonial exhibition match. It’s business as usual, and in mostly good ways. Sports Interactive have made meaningful changes to the management game both on and off the pitch, all built on top of fundamentals that remain as complex and compulsive as they have for years. That said, FM24 also demonstrates why a change is welcome, as in its current form it can struggle to strike the balance between authenticity and fun.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve many a Halloweeny game to recommend to you (Saturnalia, Hob&#x27;s Barrow, Wytchwood, World Of Horror and even, I suppose, Alan Wake 2, although I&#x27;m sort of enjoying it in the wrong way to think of it as a Halloween apropos game) but I&#x27;m short on recommendations for myself. I rarely replay games, let alone horror games, which are often one-and-done sorts of things - though I do, of course, enter the Pumpkin Carving Festival every year.
I want something that has a general air of spookiness without being a jumpscare frightfest. If I hadn&#x27;t played The Tartarus Key already I&#x27;d be playing that, is what I&#x27;m saying. But the other day I played the demo for An English Haunting and it&#x27;s exactly what I want. It&#x27;s just not going to be out for a while. Rats!

                              <span>Mobile-based interactive drama Silent Hill: Ascension is quite the thing, and is getting quite the reception. The cleanest summary I can manage is that developer Genvid and publisher Konami have launched a very bad streaming service dedicated to dunking on Silent Hill, with microtransaction-fuelled voting mechanics and a chatbox awash with 10 years of pent-up fan resentment and confusing references to James Sunderland&#x27;s genitals.

                              <span>While Rishi Sunak bundles nerds into Bletchley Park, we at the Electronic Wireless Show podcast are investigating the real danger of AI: somewhat rubbish text-to-speech voicelines making The Finals less fun. We discuss the arrival of AI voices in big-name games, the disappointingly businessy thinking behind it, and whether we can think up some uses for AI-generated material that we can actually get behind. All sparked by voice actor Gianni Matragrano’s video compilation of the lines in question, which you should probably watch before listening to this episode, or there’ll be a bit where Nate appears to bellow &quot;THE KING FISH&quot; for no reason. Well, maybe not no reason. It’s still Nate.


Plus! We talk about what we’ve been playing this week, which coincidentally for me was The Finals, while Nate’s been digging deeper into the Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor demo. I also recount the teeth-based controversy surrounding Cities: Skyline 2, in turn begging the question: what are they going to do with all those teeth?

                              <span>I played a demo of Scene Investigators over the most recent Steam Next Fest, and was interested enough that I wanted to have a go with the full release. It&#x27;s billed as a detective game for true crime fans, but it reminds me of those puzzle books you used to get, where you are shown an illustration of a crime scene and, if you stare at it long enough, can figure out the assigned solution. Scene Investigators is like that but the scene is a big 3D one you can walk around. A crime has happened and you need to figure out what, mostly by peering at the dates in a diary to cross reference them with the time and day a phone message was left. This is why I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to everyone. It&#x27;s quite hard. But! Some people will really like it.

                              <span>The android is unresponsive, standing frozen mid-step with one foot off the ground. I hold its metal head in my hands, tilting it this way and that as I stare into its cold red eye. It offers no resistance to my pushes and pulls, as though I was a hairdresser directing a patron’s head. Based on Stanisław Lem’s 1964 novel of the same name, The Invincible’s Firewatch-like first-person adventure is intent on exploring how machines will come to shape humanity’s future. Over the course of its ten-hour story, where you step into the Soviet-styled space boots of biologist Yasna, you will take on her desperate search for the missing crew of her research ship, The Dragonfly, lost somewhere on the rocky, sandstorm-whipped world of Regis III.
Using a logbook filled with hand-drawn maps and scrawled notes, I’ve tracked Yasna’s crew to a makeshift game to the east of where they originally landed. Instead of humans, I find the lifeless robot. I want the android to give me answers, to tell me where my crew mates are, to explain what happened on Regis III, and why I can’t remember anything before I woke up in the desert with my possessions scattered around me.

                              <span>Stand RoboCop: Rogue City next to other FPS games in a police line-up, and you&#x27;ll quickly notice the difference. This big guy is clunky, boxy, and has insane system requirements devoted to creating dazzling reflections. However, stand it next to other RoboCop games (maybe even the movies?) and it suddenly looks like a masterpiece in chrome. This is a filmic and faithful adaptation that&#x27;s likely to get instant fan approval, but didn&#x27;t leave my shooty thumbs that impressed.

                              <span>There comes a point when adding yet another behemothic RPG to your collection of unfinished, behemothic RPGs ceases to be a mark of eccentricity and becomes an act of manifest self-hatred. I, for instance, have just activated a beta code for 100-hour levelling fest Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader even as I make a mental note that really, I&#x27;ve got to make some proper headway in Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 this evening.
For The King 2, at least, seems pretty trim and digestible at a reported 30 hours in length. Released out of early access today, it&#x27;s a blend of fantasy table-top gaming and roguelite, in which you lead a party of adventurers across a hexagonal map to quash an evil Queen in grid, dice and turn-based combat.

                              <span>What kind of game does the label “survival horror” denote? Since its inconspicuous first appearance in the original Resident Evil’s loading screen (functioning first and foremost, lest we forget, as a handy marketing catchphrase), the term has been so enthusiastically embraced and haphazardly applied as to be rendered almost meaningless in 2023. Horror gaming has witnessed multiple seismic shifts since 1996, most notably the turn to action-oriented design with the likes of The Suffering and Resident Evil 4 in the mid-2000s, as well as the rise of spooky almost-walking-simulators like SOMA in the mid-2010s. 

Yet the term survival horror has expanded to such a degree that it now seems to stand in, albeit rather awkwardly, for the entirety of video game horror. Even with the caveat that borders for these kinds of labels are notoriously hard to define, survival horror remains an unusually amorphous realm, one that (as a quick search of the relevant tag on Steam will reveal) lays claim as much to first-person bloodbaths like Zombie Army Trilogy as it does moody, combat-free adventures like Visage. Still, old distinctions linger, and a clutch of recent indie survival horrors qualify their work with the word “classic”. I interviewed some of the developers to find out why - and, more importantly, what classic survival horror means.

That&#x27;s because all digital version preorders unlock early access to the Modern Warfare III campaign. That&#x27;s eight days before the full release on November 10, which is when its multiplayer suite goes live. Earlier this week, publisher Activision Blizzard and developer Sledgehammer Games released the PC specs and system requirements for the game. Now, we have our hands on Modern Warfare III and can tell you what the best graphics mode is on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S and what visual settings to use.

                              <span>Fortnite Chapter 4: Season 4 has been one of the best seasons for Epic Games&#x27; battle royale in a while, bringing vampires, heists, and more to the game. But it ends this week, with Epic bringing players back to the Chapter 1 map for the next season of Chapter 4. Thanks to a new trailer released today, we know this throwback season is called Season OG, is a part of Chapter 4, and will be bringing with it a heavy dose of nostalgia. 
That&#x27;s showcased best in today&#x27;s trailer, which highlights the throwback drop spot of Tilted Towers while Juice WRLD&#x27;s &quot;Lucid Dreams&quot; plays. Tilted Towers looks as good as we remember it, and you can check it out in the Fortnite Chapter 4: Season OG – Return to Tilted Towers gameplay trailer for yourself below: 


Fortnite Chapter 4: Season OG, this chapter&#x27;s fifth chapter, goes live tomorrow on November 3.

Back in the &#x27;90s, Nintendo played faster and looser with its library of characters. Sometimes Yoshi showed up in The Legend of Zelda, and Kirby was whatever color he felt like at the moment, be it gray or pink. In 1996, that laissez-faire attitude was in full effect for the release of Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars for the Super Nintendo. Link, Samus, and even Donkey Kong (sort of) all had inexplicable cameos in the game, and one of my big questions about the remake was whether or not those would move forward. If you&#x27;re ready to learn the answer for at least some of them, read on!
Impressively, the answer is yes! At least for Link and Donkey Kong. I have not been able to play to the point in the game where Samus appears, so I can&#x27;t answer that question yet. When you get close to Link after seeing him in the sleeping bed, a &quot;talk&quot; option appears, and when you click it, a Zelda musical sting plays.
Donkey Kong&#x27;s cameo has always been questionable as to whether or not it is him, as he is just labeled &quot;Guerilla&quot;, but he sure looks a lot like Donkey Kong, just with a crown.

The Super Mario RPG remake releases November 17 for Nintendo Switch.

                              <span>Omni-Man, the J.K. Simmons-voiced character from the Invincible animated series, is coming to Mortal Kombat 1 next week on November 9. Ahead of his debut, NetherRealm Studios has released the official Omni-Man gameplay trailer and alongside hard-hitting (and gory) super moves, it features a brutal and show-accurate fatality for the character. 
The trailer teases Liu Kang for allowing a Viltrumite into the Realms of Mortal Kombat before more than two minutes of Omni-Man action plays out. And closing out the trailer is the fatality for the upcoming Kombat Pack character. We won&#x27;t spoil it here, so check it out in the Mortal Kombat 1 Omni-Man gameplay trailer below: 


Omni-Man hits Mortal Kombat 1 as part of the first Kombat Pack on November 9.

                              <span>Back in August, a Pokémon Presents revealed that the first part of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet&#x27;s DLC, collectively known as The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero, would hit the game in September. That has since come and gone, with players eagerly awaiting the second part of this expansion. And now, the official Pokémon Twitter account has revealed The Indigo Disk DLC goes live next month. 


More specifically, The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero Part 2: The Indigo Disk hits Pokémon Scarlet and Violet on December 14. As those keeping up with Game Freak&#x27;s ninth generation of Pokémon know, The Indigo Disk brings players to Blueberry Academy, which is actually in the Unova region, rather than the Paldea region where Pokémon Scarlet and Violet take place. The Unova region is the setting for Pokémon Black and White, and their sequels, Pokémon Black 2 and White 2.

Many players are speculating that The Indigo Disk will, in some way, tease remakes of the fifth generation of Pokémon, as those are next in line for Game Freak&#x27;s cadence of remaking previously released Pokémon games. With players leaving Paldea to check out an academy in Unova, many predict some hint at potential Pokémon Black and White remakes await trainers. But only time will tell. 
Pokémon Scarlet and Violet: The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero Part 2 – The Indigo Disk hits the games on December 14. The DLC can be purchased as a pack for $34.99. 
For more, read about how after The Indigo Disk is out, every starter Pokémon will be available in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, and then read Game Informer&#x27;s Pokémon Scarlet and Violet review.

                              <span>Game Informer can exclusively reveal Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla: The Hidden Codex, a new graphic novel from Dark Horse Books that brings players back into the world of assassin Eivor, a medieval Nordic land, a new hidden order, and more. It will be released as a hardcover graphic novel on April 30, 2024, in retail stores and online, for $19.99 (and it hits comic book stores on May 1, 2024). Mathieu Gabella is the author, with art from Paolo Traisci. 
The Hidden Codex follows Edward, a scribe and reluctant monk after he escapes from a kidnapping performed by a clan of Vikings. After securing his freedom, Edward finds his brother missing and strange documents &quot;blackened by a language he innately understands.&quot; 
&quot;No one knows where these occult-looking symbols came from, but Edward has seen such writings before: in the workshop of an enigmatic wise man among the Vikings who is part of a secret order: Those Unseen,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;An order that could offer answers to Edward, and guarantee his aspirations of freedom and knowledge. But with that knowledge, can he find and rescue his own brother before it&#x27;s too late?&quot;
Ubisoft senior transmedia content manager Etienne Bouvier says the company is lucky to work with Gabella and Traisci as they are two long-standing fans of the Assassin&#x27;s Creed franchise who infused their love of it, and knowledge of its lore, into this book. 
Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla: The Hidden Codex hits bookshelves and online retailers on April 30, 2024, before it hits comic book stores on May 1. It is available for preorder now and costs $19.99.

                              <span>We are very pleased to announce today the start of the testing period of two single-game engines: Kingdom: The Far Reaches and Escape From Hell!
Kingdom, was developed and released by Interplay in 1995. Only the DOS version of the game (available on gog.com) is supported. It&#x27;s a cartoon FMV game, with an inventory, in which you have to guide Lathan Kandor through a medieval world, discovering the magic spells and the items required to defeat an evil wizard. 
Escape From Hell, was developed for Electronic Arts by the game veterans Richard Seaborne and Alan Murphy and was released in 1990. You play Alan in this keyboard-only Role Playing Game and visit Hell, looking for your girlfriend who was accidentally teleported there.
Both games use heavily hardcoded logic which is error prone and requires a lot of testing, so we need your feedback more than ever as they are both incompletely tested. There is sadly only one known demo for Kingdom. Support for the Windows and Mac versions of Kingdom may come later! Please contact us if you have some other demos of both games.
To play any of these games, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker and please take some screenshots along the way!

                              <span>Press releases published today by Spain&#x27;s National Police and the Ministry of the Interior celebrated the dismantling of a pirate IPTV operation, the arrest of eight suspects, and alleged losses to rightsholders of €366.25 million. In dozens of local and international news reports, this &#x27;official&#x27; figure is cited verbatim. We have zero faith in it, and we aren&#x27;t alone. After a silent unreferenced edit, the police press release now reads €366,250, but the government&#x27;s copy remains intact.

                              <span>It&#x27;s clear that the Eastern European country of Georgia must dramatically reduce its 90%+ piracy rates to have any chance of joining the EU.  The Alliance for Creativity and Entertainment has just announced that in partnership with local government, two of the largest pirate sites in Georgia were recently &quot;shut down.&quot; Interestingly, those same sites were also said to have &quot;shut down&quot; in 2022 when ACE member Cavea+ launched a streaming service in Georgia.

The operation, claimed to be the most significant ever carried out, arrives just weeks after Google &amp; Cisco were criticized for &quot;turning a blind eye&quot; to the IPTV piracy problem.
