                              <span>Existential Sci-Fi-sis
11-Bit Studios (of This War is Mine fame) has revealed its brand new title, The Alters, during the PC Gaming Show.
The intriguing-looking adventure sees a space builder, stranded far off on a distant planet, who is forced to, essentially, clone himself again and again in order to find a way back home. The protagonist must create versions of himself sporting new and unique skills, but might find himself losing a little of himself each and every time.
The developer promises drama, mystery, horror, and quirky ingenuity as our hero finds himself surrounded by alternative versions of himself. Frankly, I know a few folk who would be super happy with that scenario. The Alters is currently available to wishlist on Steam, GOG, and Epic Games Store.

                              <span>It&#x27;ll be made with player feedback in mind
We&#x27;ve seen a few games so far at the PC Gaming Show, and while a few were old, Endless Dungeon looks intriguing, as the name literally just tells us what we need to know about it: dungeons are the focus. Duh!
It&#x27;s from the development team Amplitude, published by Sega. Here&#x27;s a quick roundup of what to expect from PC Gamer:
&quot;Despite being known as a 4X developer, Humankind and Endless Space&#x27;s Amplitude Studios also knows its way around a tactical roguelite. 2014&#x27;s Dungeon of the Endless zoomed in on the Endless sci-fi universe, creating random adventures through monster-infested dungeons instead of tales of galactic-scale conquest and intrigue. And while Amplitude isn&#x27;t calling it a direct sequel [it] has that same spirit.&quot;

Yep! It seems to be a loose follow-up of sorts to Dungeon of the Endless, which some of you folks may have heard about. Note that this one is hero-based, and there&#x27;s a preview of Zed and Bunker now on the company&#x27;s YouTube channel. While &quot;open development&quot; is typically something I don&#x27;t really pay too much attention to until the thing is actually out: I can add this one to my endless list of &quot;things I will probably try eventually.&quot;

If there&#x27;s one thing I love, it&#x27;s a narrative adventure game, and I&#x27;m in luck with Starward Industries&#x27; upcoming title The Invincible. Based on the 1964 Polish novel of the same name, Stanisław Lem&#x27;s work of hard sci-fi was at the forefront of commentary on microrobots and swarm intelligence. It&#x27;s giving Firewatch meets Annihilation vibes, and that makes for a pretty cool video game premise if you ask me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;13nRHDoUz6s
The game was announced last year, but this is the first time we&#x27;ve gotten a good look at some gameplay -- what we saw today at the PC Gaming Showcase was an early beta build of the game. We saw scientist Yasna as she navigates an unknown planet in an attempt to recover the equipment from a previous expedition, and of course, things don&#x27;t quite go according to plan. This looks like a really chilling, grounded narrative experience, and this short gameplay clip alone is enough to send The Invincible to the top of my list of most anticipated games.
The Invincible will be coming to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X sometime in 2022.

During today&#x27;s PC Gaming Show, Klei Entertainment dropped a trailer for its animated wildlife brawler RottWood.
Anthropomorphic critters will battle their way through killer vegetables, monsters, and other baddies in dungeon-crawling, brawling action with a Saturday Morning Show vibe. A fun-but-not-really joke saw the game get a release date of 2024, and that became 2023, and that became 202? So I guess we don&#x27;t know when it&#x27;s coming.
You&#x27;ll have to tide yourself over with this trailer.

Soulstice is due out later this year, and it has serious Good Action vibes if the development team can really deliver on it. It&#x27;s got style, that&#x27;s for sure! Here&#x27;s the new trailer from the PC Gaming Show today, which provides a more cinematic flair (though plenty of gameplay is available at this point, see below).
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;ncf202F8jfg
I&#x27;m a sucker for any stylish looking action project, though how that action actually ends up paying out drastically differs from game to game. A lot of similar titles attempt to marry an intriguing world and a technical action system, but fall short of either, or both. Hopefully Soulstice manages to sidestep those sins.
The folks over at Modus confirmed a PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X release for Soulstice, with a Deluxe Edition to boot. It&#x27;s out on September 20, 2022. The Deluxe version comes with a digital artbook, digital soundtrack, and the &quot;Ashen Blade item pack.&quot; The cover art is good enough to warrant a look in a local gaming store, too! I&#x27;ll be keeping an eye on Soulstice come September.

In case you missed it, the team provided a 10-minute look at the Soulstice combat system last month:

So that wasn&#x27;t bad! No weird ads from The Rock peddling energy drinks and comic book movies. No awkward or cringeworthy skits. Just an hour and a half-ish of pure games: here&#x27;s a Microsoft and Bethesda recap for the 2022 &quot;E3&quot; showcase stream.
We began with a new look at Redfall, which gave us an endearing showing of gameplay: noting its stark differences to other similar squad-based shooters. From there it shot into Hollow Knight: Silksong, and although we didn&#x27;t get any concrete info on the release date, we know that it exists! I&#x27;m glad someone finally showed that thing at some stream in any form (how many Nintendo Directs was it rumored to be at? All of them?).
Those two kind of defined the Microsoft and Bethesda 2022 Games Showcase as a whole. …</span>

The closer to today&#x27;s Xbox and Bethesda showcase was, of course, Starfield. The upcoming spacefaring RPG is hotly anticipated, and today Bethesda showed off a lengthy look at some Starfield gameplay.

The Starfield gameplay starts with the player and their robot companion venturing out onto a planet. After gawking at some local wildlife and mining some ore, they infilrate a base and take on some space pirates.
The gunplay looks surprisingly action-heavy, with futuristic but chunky versions of weapons ringing out as they blast their way through.

Then, once the action subsides, we get a look at New Atlantis and some of the social areas the player can explore. The narrative seems to cen…</span>

During today&#x27;s Xbox and Bethesda Game Studios showcase, Hideo Kojima of Kojima Productions mailed in a short video to announce that he was making a new title in collaboration with Xbox... And that&#x27;s it.
I guess for many that will be more than enough news, but I can&#x27;t help but admit it was pretty funny to just see Kojima basically say he was making a game, and then simply bail. No &quot;Overdose&quot; trailer? Nothing at all? I guess not. But, for fans of Kojima Productions, you can at least take heart that yer boy is once again back at the drawing board, preparing another undoubtedly odd tale in collaboration with the black and green brand.
We&#x27;ll no doubt be hearing more about the game in the coming months.

A long overdue fan-favorite RPG series will finally be accessible to Xbox players, and Phil Spencer showed up on stage at the Xbox &amp; Bethesda Games Showcase to share the good news. That&#x27;s right, the Persona series is on the way to Xbox, including Game Pass support, and Persona 3 Portable and Persona 5 Royal will be arriving on PC at long last. What a get!
Here&#x27;s the full rundown: Persona 3 Portable, Persona 4 Golden, and Persona 5 Royal will be playable on Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, with P5R confirmed for October 21, 2022, and P3P and P4G coming sometime in 2023, according to an Xbox release calendar.

This hype trailer should conjure a lot of fond memories with old friends, and Atlus also has a dedicated hub site for these Persona games showing up on &quot;modern platforms.&quot;
How many hours of JRPGing are we going to need to set aside?

There&#x27;s a new adventure on the horizon, and it looks absolutely gorgeous. Cococucumber, the creator of Echo Generation, have revealed its new game Ravenlok.
Ravenlok is a fairytale story about a young girl and her quest to fulfill a dangerous prophecy. It&#x27;s an action-oriented RPG, with an absolutely brilliant look. That&#x27;s not really a surprise, given how pretty Cococucumber&#x27;s particular style has looked in the past.
The adventure sets out in 2023, coming to Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. It&#x27;ll also be a day-one Xbox Game Pass title.

If you&#x27;re a fan of games like Inside and Limbo, you&#x27;re in luck, because the gameplay designer who worked on those titles is also heading up a new project called Cocoon. It&#x27;s a colorful puzzle game that&#x27;s also being published by Annapurna, which is a great seal of approval in my eyes The game&#x27;s puzzles have to deal with different colored orbs, which the player uses in different ways, like opening pathways, building bridges, and even controlling little robots.

Cocoon is still shrouded in a lot of mystery, but it&#x27;s easy to tell how much polish it has even from this premiere trailer alone. We don&#x27;t have a release window yet, but we do know that Cocoon will be coming to Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and Xbox Game Pass.

                              <span>&quot;A dark fantasy version of the Later Han Dynasty&quot;
Today during the Microsoft 2022 showcase, we got to see a reveal for Team Ninja&#x27;s latest action romp: Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty.
It&#x27;s described as a &quot;dramatic, action-packed story of a nameless militia soldier fighting for survival in a dark fantasy version of the Later Han Dynasty where demons plague the Three Kingdoms.&quot; Quite a mouthful! Even if this ends up being &quot;Three Kingdoms Nioh,&quot; I&#x27;m so here for it.
Xbox boss Phil Spencer says it was &quot;exciting to work with Team Ninja&quot; for this collaboration. It&#x27;s been exciting to see Team Ninja rise to the occasion in recent years, myself!  Following quite a few fumbles, most notably Yaiba: Ninja Gaiden Z, one of their lowest points, they knocked it out of the park with Nioh just three years later. After that they continued to assist in various Warriors games, and gave us Nioh 2, as well as Ultimate Alliance 3. The Ninja Gaiden: Master Collection reminded us of their storied history, and Stranger of Paradise, while polarizing, was interesting from an action perspective.
Now we have Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty next year. It&#x27;s out in early 2023 on PC, Xbox consoles, and cloud devices.

We got a glimpse of Ereban: Shadow Legacy at the Xbox &amp; Bethesda Games Showcase, and if you&#x27;re into faster-paced stealth games, it&#x27;s worth a look. Raw Fury and developer Baby Robot Games showed a new trailer with cool wall-climbing shadow abilities, and confirmed the PC and Xbox Series X/S title will be playable day one on Game Pass.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;sC9u7sM2RVk
As super dramatic as the trailer was, the footage looks pretty fluid and fun.
Story-wise, you&#x27;re playing as the &quot;last Ereban,&quot; so all of the sneaking around and shadow-morphing will be in service of figuring out &quot;who you are and what happened to your people.&quot; (And, presumably, getting lots of well-justified revenge along the way.)
&quot;Traverse the ruins of lifeless cities, infiltrate sci-fi facilities carved into ancient temples, and discover the remnants of your forgotten race,&quot; according to the team. &quot;Absorb echoes to learn more lethal and non-lethal shadow powers, craft high-tech gadgets, and combine all this with your agility to infiltrate Helios lines and investigate what they are hiding.&quot;
Ereban: Shadow Legacy will be out on Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and PC in 2023.

As a part of today&#x27;s Xbox and Bethesda Games showcase, Activision Blizzard released the trailer for its fifth and final class for Diablo IV — Speak with the dead and command the armies of the grave, as you step into the terrifying visage of The Necromancer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;PwxIR4Qx6Fo
In typical Blizzard fashion, the reveal was accompanied by a grim &#x27;n&#x27; gory cinematic sequence, wherein our titular deathtalker comes upon a party of corpses, using their unholy abilities to learn of their fate. Our anti-hero then embarks in a showdown with a frightening pack of lycanthropes, evening the score with a host of Ray Harryhausen lovin&#x27; skeletal army.
The reveal of the Necromancer was followed by brand new gameplay footage from Diablo IV, along with a release window of 2023, when the title will arrive on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.
For full clarity, you can find an abridged timeline of the ongoing Activision Blizzard controversy, investigation, and response right here.

Battle royale Naraka: Bladepoint is bringing the action to consoles this month. Netease&#x27;s martial arts melee hits Xbox Series X|S on June 23, and it&#x27;s coming to Game Pass.
PC and console players will be able to battle against each other, so finding a match won&#x27;t be too hard. Alongside the console release, Naraka: Bladepoint also teased its new campaign mode.

All of this is included with Game Pass, when Naraka: Bladepoint hits Xbox series consoles on June 23, 2022.

                              <span>Like something out of a really dark storybook
Obsidian is best known for RPGs like Pillars of Eternity or Outer Worlds, but this time they&#x27;re taking on a new genre: narrative adventures. Today they announced their new project Pentiment, which takes place in medieval times and features a gorgeous 2D art style. We didn&#x27;t get a huge insight into what the story is about just yet, but it looks to be the usual kinds of things one would encounter back in the day, including being burned at the stake.

Pentiment looks dark and compelling, and I have to admit it&#x27;s refreshing to see a studio with such an impressive track record as Obsidian take on a project like this. As a huge fan of narrative games, this will definitely be one I&#x27;ll be watching with a close eye. Pentiment will be releasing on Xbox consoles, PC, Cloud, and Xbox Game Pass in November 2022.

                              <span>September 2022 is the full release
Microsoft provided new Grounded footage today at the Xbox and Bethesda showcase, providing a ton of gameplay: oh and a dang release window!
After what feels like 68,000 years of early access, Grounded is coming to PC and consoles (and Game Pass) in September 2022. Here&#x27;s what Jordan had to say about it two years ago when it first hit early access:
&quot;Thinking further ahead, a better sense of character progression, more refined base construction, deeper combat, and more biomes and traversal gear will go a long way. If Obsidian can make the most of its ingenious setting (and take a few storytelling cues from Subnautica), we’ll be in luck.&quot;

A lack of firm storytelling is easily one of my big pet peeves for survival games; and the trailer below does give us some hope on an expansion at launch as well as potentially beyond on that front. The game has shored up a bit in every respect in the past few years, so it&#x27;ll be a blast to see it all take shape all at once in 1.0.
I&#x27;ve been largely holding off on this one until the actual full game comes out, so this is one of the most fun announcements out of this E3 week.

Interior/Night has released a new trailer for As Dusk Falls, a dramatic graphic adventure of narrative choice, moral turbulence, and harsh consequence.
The new title follows the story of a family whose split-second decisions in an hour of need lead them down an incredibly dangerous path, pursued by police, villains, and mysterious strangers. As Dusk Falls utilizes a blend of animated sequences with comic book-style panels to tell an emotionally-charged tale of truth and consequence, all set against the backdrop of dusty rural America.
As Dusk Falls launches July 19 on Xbox, PC, and Xbox Game Pass.

The Xbox &amp; Bethesda Games Showcase had a lot of known quantities — games we already knew about with new content or release dates in tow — but of the new-to-me showings, The Last Case of Benedict Fox stood out. It&#x27;s a Lovecraft-inspired metroidvania game with a protagonist who&#x27;s got a &quot;demon companion&quot; inside him. Cool, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;io5-UsjUGvU
As a detective in the 1920s, you&#x27;ll tango with the occult in combat that Rogue Games and developer Plot Twist describe as &quot;challenging&quot; and suitable for fans of Souls-likes. So far, just going off the trailer, I&#x27;m most interested in the art direction and themes; if the more conventional action and platforming hold up decently well, that&#x27;ll be a bonus for me.
As a fan of The Darkness who still thinks about that game (and to a lesser extent, its sequel) from time to time, the whole internal demonic struggle angle appeals to me.
The Last Case of Benedict Fox is coming to PC and Xbox Series X/S in spring 2023.

A new Minecraft experience is on the way, with some heroic deeds to undertake. Minecraft Legends is an action-strategy take on the blocky world of Minecraft, coming in 2023.
Mojang Studios revealed the new project today as part of the Xbox and Bethesda showcase with both cinematics and gameplay. It will put players in the world of Minecraft, tasked with forming alliances and fighting back against invading forces from the Nether.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;rsrtI0fpkV4
While there is a full campaign to undertake, Xbox and Mojang confirm there will also be online co-op for those who want to team up against the Nether. The team is partnering with Blackbird Interactive of Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak and other projects, to bring the strategy together.
Minecraft Legends is coming to PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S in 2023. It will also be coming to both PC and Xbox Game Pass.

                              <span>What&#x27;s better than farming? Farming in space!
I&#x27;m always a sucker for a good farming sim, and it looks like we&#x27;ll be getting another good one based on what we&#x27;re seeing from Xbox&#x27;s Gaming Showcase. A new title has been announced called Lightyear Frontier – A Fresh Start, which puts a fun spin on the classic farming game formula. It&#x27;s set in space, where players crash land onto a mysterious in a mech suit that is perfectly suited for any kind of your farming needs. It looks colorful, creative, and relaxing, and the trailer even promised some kind of mystery for players to uncover.

Lightyear Frontier will be coming to Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One sometime in spring 2023, just in time for planting season. I for one will be looking forward to it!

                              <span>Already out on PC
Gunfire Reborn is already out on PC, having released near the end of 2021: but now we&#x27;re getting a Gunfire Reborn Xbox port: confirmed via the Xbox and Bethesda showcase stream today.
It&#x27;s a four player co-op game with &quot;roguelike action,&quot; in case you were interested. You can &quot;mix and match 40+ weapons, 100+ scrolls, powerful inscriptions and Ascensions to craft builds from devastating Sharpshooters to magic-based Alchemists.&quot; It sounds like a lot of games in recent memory, but one more couldn&#x27;t hurt. I mean, it looks like a perfect Xbox Game Pass game.
Four player co-op and Xbox Game Pass were practically made for each other. In an era where a lot of platforms are still segmented, even with cross-platform play, it&#x27;s going to be super simple to just download the game on Game Pass and jump into a session.
Microsoft has had several of these lower key or already-available-on-PC-for-a-bit reveals today like Gunfire Reborn Xbox during their &quot;E3&quot; showcase, but everything goes down so much easier when it&#x27;s piled onto a giant subscription. On the flipside, a lot of these port jobs or &quot;wait and see&quot; games aren&#x27;t always that heavy-hitting on other platforms.

A44 Games and Kepler Interactive released a new trailer for their upcoming open-world RPG adventure Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn.
The new preview, which premiered during the Xbox and Bethesda Games showcase, sees hero Nor Vanek, (accompanied by their cute pal Enki), step through a mysterious portal into the dangerous and fantastical afterlife, where they will explore the environment, battles armies of monsters, and even challenge the very Gods themselves, powered by old-school weaponry fused with incredible magic powers.
Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn launches on Xbox, PC, and Games Pass in early 2023.

                              <span>I need another shower after watching this gnarly Xbox showcase trailer
After a delay, Scorn showed back up at the Xbox &amp; Bethesda Games Showcase with a wonderfully awful trailer and a final release date: Ebb Software&#x27;s fleshy nightmare will be released on October 21, just in time for Halloween. It&#x27;s another Game Pass inclusion, too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;o-oDqL-UP_0
It&#x27;s been a long time coming, and this game is just as gross as the first time we saw it, which is impressive considering how long it&#x27;s been slipping in and out of my radar.
Apart from the Xbox Series X/S versions, body-horror fans will also be able to check out Scorn on PC — it&#x27;s coming to Steam and the Epic Games Store.
According to the team, &quot;players must harness their intuition — and possibly the darkest parts of their minds — to reach new areas and earn new abilities in their fight to make it out of the bio labyrinth.&quot; I feel like when the credits finally roll, we&#x27;ll all need to step outside and just chill for a bit. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if Scorn is the equivalent of a movie you only need to watch once in your life — or maybe it&#x27;ll be a freaky Halloween tradition.
As they say, long live the new flesh.

Forza is one of the most beloved racing games of all time, and the release of Forza 5 last year cemented its place in the gaming canon even further. Just when you think a good thing can&#x27;t get better, it was announced during the Xbox Games Showcase today that Forza 5 is officially getting a Hot Wheel collab expansion, which was leaked earlier this week. The series has crossed over with Hot Wheels for every game in the series now since Forza 3, making it one of the most fun racing game traditions out there.

The gameplay looks awesome, with huge looping orange tracks suspended over the beautiful landscapes that have become synonymous with Forza. The Hot Wheels expansion will be available on July 19 on Xbox, PC, Cloud, and Xbox Game Pass.

An Ark 2 is in the mix now thanks to new news from a Microsoft showcase during &quot;E3&quot; week: so uh, look forward to it!
Since we have so little to go on, here&#x27;s the spiel straight from Microsoft:
&quot;Survive the past. Tame the future. Suddenly awakened on a primal world filled with dinosaurs and humans struggling for dominance, you must team-up with legendary heroes to confront powerful dark forces. Saddle up, and join the definitive next-gen survival experience with ARK 2.&quot;

&quot;Suddenly,&quot; eh? Well here&#x27;s hoping there will be some sort of interesting twist in terms of lore to build upon the prior strategy foundation of the original. Sometimes survival games can be tough to get into if the hook isn&#x27;t strong enough, from multiple angles. I&#x27;ve fizzled out on various survival genre games for a ton of reasons, those included!
Although we don&#x27;t have much to go on at the moment, Ark seems to have done really well for itself, especially before the survival genre started to get a little more saturated. Now it arguably has more to prove, and we just have a cinematic right now.
Microsoft says it&#x27;ll be out on PC, Xbox consoles, and cloud devices next year.

Alongside the above info, we also got our first look at the next character headed to the huge Overwatch roster. The Junker Queen — described accurately by our own Chris Carter as &quot;a Moyse design&quot; — is a long-time lore OW character, who fought their way up through the Australian outback to become ruler of the Junker haven known as &quot;The Pitt&quot; — home to Overwatch heroes Junkrat and Roadhog.
Overwatch 2 enters Early Access on PC and consoles October 4. You can find an abridged timeline of the ongoing Activision Blizzard controversy, investigation, and response right here.

Microsoft Flight Simulator is crossing over with Halo Infinite in a new add-on that lets players pilot a Pelican, and it&#x27;s out today, for free. While the Xbox &amp; Bethesda Games Showcase was mostly focused on the game&#x27;s 40th Anniversary Edition due out in November (with helicopters and gliders), the iconic USNC aircraft got all of the attention.

Circling back to the new edition, Microsoft Flight Simulator 40th Anniversary Edition is tapping into nostalgia as a &quot;comprehensive celebration of the franchise&quot; and a &quot;tribute to past editions,&quot; according to Xbox. Apart from newly added helicopters and gliders, the developers also confirmed the Spirit of St. Louis and a &quot;true-to-life&quot; Airbus A310.
Microsoft Flight Simulator 40th Anniversary Edition will be playable for free if you already have the base game or you&#x27;re a Game Pass subscriber on Xbox Series X/S or PC.

                              <span>Get ready for another harrowing adventure
A Plague Tale is a series that has made a name for itself in the action adventure genre with its gorgeous visuals, compelling story and characters, and creative gameplay. The second game in the series, A Plague Tale: Requiem, was announced last summer, and we got a first look at its gameplay during the Game Awards in 2021 as well. Today, during the Xbox and Bethesda Games Showcase, developer Asobo Studio showed off a new trailer, aptly titled &quot;End of Innocence.&quot;
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;K6trXEz1YvM
We got a closer look at some story, some gameplay, and some stunning set pieces, so it looks like we&#x27;ve got a lot to look forward to from A Plague Tale: Requiem. We don&#x27;t have an exact release date as of yet, but the trailer did confirm that the game will be coming to Xbox Consoles, PC, and Cloud sometime in 2022, and of course, it will be available on Xbox Game Pass.

Ravenlok is clearly channelling Alice In Wonderland a fair bit, and Cococucumber do refer to it as a “fairytale reimagining”. It’s due out sometime in 2023.

The blend of action-adventure, stealth and seething hordes of rats is getting a sequel later this year, taking our miserable medieval tots Amicia and Hugo to the south of France for A Plague Tale: Requiem. In a gameplay trailer shown at the Xthesda showcase tonight we saw that Amicia is struggling with whether or not she should kill the heck out of soldiers, or try to stealth on by.

                              <span>It must be a relief to ActiBlizz to have some good Diablo 4 news, given how everyone on Earth is ragging on Diablo Immortal 24/8 (when we are not open-mouthed at the stream of terrible news about the company, from numerous allegations of harrassment, misconduct and discrimination, to the company advising shareholders to not approve a proposal to report on harassment and discrimination).

Why, that&#x27;s the Diablo game people keep saying they want!

                              <span>It was on the cards, and tonight at the XBox &amp; Bethesda Showcase we indeed got a look at some vampire slaying in Redfall. Arkane&#x27;s spooky co-op FPS has been on my most anticipated list for a while, especially because I was hoping the studio would put their signature weird twist on things. Judging by the big guns and big abilities you have at your disposal, they have - and the vampires should be watching their be-caped backs. Never thought I&#x27;d see the day when someone made being a vampire hunter look cooler than being a vamp, but we might be getting there.

                              <span>Here&#x27;s a thing: Riot&#x27;s games are coming to Game Pass, including League Of Legends, Valorant and Legends Of Runeterra. Those are free-to-play games, which means what you&#x27;ll really getting for your subscription is access to some of the bits that would normally be locked behind real money or the grind. In League Of Legends, for example, a Game Pass subscription will unlock all 160+ of the MOBA&#x27;s champions.

Will we see more of Starfield that isn’t CGI target footage and concept art? Could we get a closer look at Playground Games’ mysterious new Fable? Will Redfall get its first major public appearance since, uh, the last the Xbox and Bethesda Games Showcase? Dunno, but you can watch the whole show via the stream embedded below, and follow along with commentary from myself and vid bud Liam. The curtain raises at 6pm BST / 7pm CEST / 1pm ET.

                              <span>The trailer for Morbid Metal from tonight&#x27;s Future Games Show had a lot of metal (the music genre) and metal (the stuff you make blades out of). Morbid Metal is a hack &#x27;n&#x27; slash, but the difference here is that you have four different mech lads at your disposal, and you can morph between them whenever you like. This real-time switching means Morbid Metal moves very quickly. You might think hyphenated phrases like &quot;high-octane&quot;, &quot;action-packed&quot;, and &quot;fast-paced&quot; are moving in the direction of this game, but buddy this is going at such speed that they&#x27;re already here.

We now know a heck of a lot more about the upcoming 9th generation of Pokémon games. Pokémon Scarlet and Violet look to shake up the series&#x27; formula in a few different ways such as four-player co-op and a fully open world, but there&#x27;s one key thing that hasn&#x27;t changed with the upcoming mainline games.
Scarlet and Violet continue the tradition of releasing two different versions of the same game. Some people might think red is just a cool, bold colour, but there&#x27;s a certain mystical charm about that shade of purple.

First announced back in 2018 before dropping onto Steam Early Access in 2020 and later PS5, Temtem garnered a lot of well-deserved attention as a worthy challenger to Pokémon’s tried-and-true formula, with a focus on developing the online social and competitive elements of Game Freak&#x27;s series. Lucky for us Nintendo fans, Madrid-based developer Crema confirmed that the monster-battling MMO will also land on the Switch on 6th September with its 1.0 launch across all platforms.
“There were a lot of sacrifices and there were a lot of difficulties in bringing Temtem to Switch,” said Game Director Guillermo Andrades via email. The humble, ageing little Switch celebrated its fifth birthday back in March and hardcore Nintendo fans await some word — any word -- of a more powerful successor, we thought it prudent to ask how the game is stacking up on Switch compared to the more powerful hardware it was developed for.

Pokémon has always had two different versions, but before the original games were released on Game Boy in 1996, Game Freak had plans for something else.
In new translations of old Japanese interviews (via the YouTube channel Did You Know Gaming), it&#x27;s revealed how Game Freak wanted 65,535 different versions of the first generation Pokémon games.

Rare&#x27;s Banjo-Kazooie - starring the bear and bird who made a name for themselves during the Nintendo 64 generation - is rumoured to be making a return.
In the latest episode of the Nate the Hate Nate the Hate podcast, game developer Modern Vintage Gamer suggested a revival could be on the way, based on some things he had been hearing around the industry.

As part of the Summer Game Fest and IGN&#x27;s Summer of Gaming, the Wholesome Direct took place on June 11th, 2022, with around around 100 game trailers and announcements, all themed around the &quot;wholesome games&quot; trend. We saw games about frogs, cats, bears, witches, and mail delivery — but which of them are coming to Switch, you ask?
(Also, if you missed the Wholesome Direct, you can watch it again here!)

                              <span>Obsidian Entertainment, the studio behind 2019’s The Outer Worlds, has revealed Pentiment, a beautiful narrative journey through 16th Century Bavaria. It is coming to Xbox consoles and PC this November. 
Revealed during today’s Xbox &amp; Bethesda Games Showcase, Pentiment looks like quite the departure from what Obsidian has released over the past few years. Nonetheless, the project looks fascinating. The game features quite a unique visual style that looks reminiscent of an old medieval painting or book. This makes sense, too, because Pentiment is not an RPG like The Outer Worlds or a survival game like the studio’s Grounded, but rather, a narrative adventure game. 
Check out the trailer for yourself below: 


Here’s how Xbox describes Pentiment in the YouTube trailer description: 
“Set in 16th century Bavaria, Pentiment will take players on a narrative journey through the eyes of Journeyman Artist Andreas Maler during a time of great social unrest. Led by game director Josh Sawyer, this game is brought to life by a talented team inspired by illuminated manuscripts, woodcut prints, and history itself.” 
Pentiment hits Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC this November. 
While waiting for its release, read Game Informer’s review of The Outer Worlds and then read about Obsidian’s next RPG, Avowed.

                              <span>As Dusk Falls, an interactive drama where you make choices that impact the characters&#x27; lives, made an appearance at the Xbox Games Showcase. The trailer, which was captured in-game, not only looked intriguing but also revealed the game&#x27;s launch date. And it&#x27;s next month!
On July 19, you can gear up with friends or solo to experience a story of &quot;betrayal, sacrifice, and resilience.&quot; The trailer, which you can watch above, sheds light on some of the dilemmas and challenges you&#x27;ll have to navigate in a small town. It makes statements like, &quot;Sometimes doing the right thing is doing the wrong thing.&quot; The narrative-driven game will explore the entangled lives of two families across thirty years, and it looks like three characters, in particular, are at the forefront of the experience.
The multiplayer lets you have up to eight players, but it&#x27;s unclear how each person will actually be involved in the process. 
Guess we&#x27;ll know soon enough when As Dusk Falls launches on July 19 for Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC. The game is also a day-one title on Xbox Game Pass.</span>

                              <span>Game creator Hideo Kojima of Kojima Productions joined the Xbox Games Showcase presentation today for a quick but impactful announcement; he and his team are working on a new project in partnership with Xbox.
Unfortunately, he chose to share next to nothing about what the project will be, beyond sharing that it is a “game I have always wanted to make.”
Kojima also implied that it’s a new game, and thus likely not part of any existing franchise. He also spoke briefly about Microsoft’s cloud technology, suggesting that the project might leverage that capability as well.
It’s not much to go on, but it’s an interesting new direction for the studio and auteur, as Kojima has more recently been connected to Sony and its PlayStation brand.
It will be especially interesting to see what shape this new project will take as we learn more, but that may be quite a long way off from now.</span>

When Grounded releases in a few months, it&#x27;ll have every update that&#x27;s been included in its early access period thus far and something that hasn&#x27;t been available yet. The entire story campaign will be playable alone or with friends for the first time, completing the Grounded experience. Along with the whole story mode, new armor and weapon recipes and a fight against a giant Mantis await players when the update hits.
Grounded is available on Game Preview right now on Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC.</span>

In a variety of gameplay clips, creator Todd Howard walked us through various gameplay aspects, revealing that this science-fiction RPG features over 1,000 planets to explore. From barren moons to heavily populated worlds, you can go where you want to see what you discover.
The first locale we see is a moon called Kreet, which is stark in detail with rocky grain terrains and brief flares of color with red plants. In this regard, the color scheme is similar to Star Wars&#x27; Crait from The Last Jedi. Here, we are given our first taste of gameplay, which we see from bo…</span>

                              <span>Today&#x27;s Xbox Games Showcase featured many games – big and small – by a glut of different development teams. Baby Robot Games is a Barcelona-based studio that focuses on supernatural stealth and adventure games. Today, it revealed Ereban: Shadow Legacy, a game where you must harness mystical shadow powers and use high-tech gadgets to uncover the truth about your past to save the universe.
In the trailer, the main character, Ayana, who channels some serious Tron energy with her attire, confronts big mechs. Apparently, Ayana is the last descent of a forgotten race and is key to saving this dying, morally grey universe. The gameplay footage showed her stealthily outsmarting big machines and using an array of powers. She can also stab them through the head, so that&#x27;s pretty cool. She even takes some big falls from huge heights, reminiscent of Assassin&#x27;s Creed. Watch the trailer above to get the full scoop.
Ereban: Shadow Legacy will launch day one on Xbox Game Pass. No release date was revealed.</span>

                              <span>Xbox has a history of showing off some of our favorite indies during its big showcases, and it looks like it&#x27;s keeping that tradition alive and well. During the platform&#x27;s Summer Game Fest event today, we got our first glimpse at a new project from Limbo and Inside lead designer Jeppe Carlsen.
Cocoon, published by Annapurna Interactive, which has a showcase of its own next month, promises to be a mind-bending experience with an undeniably compelling art style. The creators promise to take players &quot;on an adventure across worlds within worlds,&quot; which are represented by a series of unusual glowing orbs in the trailer. The clip begins with a sweeping and stylized view of a desert landscape which is soon disturbed by a blinding beam of white light. Our hero pops out of a mechanical-looking cocoon energized by the laser and appears to be a kind of beetle. We mostly see it grabbing and distributing globes of various colors, which may allow it to jump to different locations.


 There&#x27;s not a lot to glean from this reveal trailer, but the game&#x27;s Steam page goes into a little more detail. 
Cocoon is set to release on Xbox consoles (via Game Pass), Switch, and PC sometime in 2023. The trailer&#x27;s description indicates fans should get ready to &quot;master world-leaping mechanics to unravel a cosmic mystery.&quot;</span>

                              <span>We still don&#x27;t have a firm Diablo IV release date yet (other than 2023), but we now know every class we can play when it eventually releases. The necromancer joins the previously announced barbarian, sorceress, rogue, and druid, all allowing for high levels of customization.
As you dive into dangerous open areas, you&#x27;ll be hunting the disciples of Lilith, the daughter of hatred. In new gameplay footage, developer Blizzard Entertainment says Diablo IV offers over 150 dungeons, along with territories to reclaim, and story sequences that occur as you explore. Some of these story moments could lead to massive boss battles that require numerous players.


Diablo IV offers cross-play between console and PC, and also two-player couch play for people in the same household. If you play a bunch and become incredibly powerful, the game will highlight you as a champion, which other players can see. Along with the high number of dungeons, Blizzard claims the endgame is deep and will continue to expand years after release.
Blizzard says they are close to completing development, but has only given an open 2023 timeframe for release.</span>

                              <span>Koei Tecmo Games and Team Ninja have revealed Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty and it’s coming to Xbox consoles and PC next year. 
Revealed during today’s Xbox &amp; Bethesda Games Showcase, Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty looks quite similar to Team Ninja’s Nioh series in that it features a ninja-like character fighting against not just humans, but monstrous and demonic monsters, too. The reveal trailer, which you can watch below, doesn’t feature any gameplay but it gave us quite the taste of Fallen Dynasty’s world.


As you can see in the trailer above, the character that appears to be the protagonist of Fallen Dynasty is fighting off barbarian enemies before consuming something that turns them into a massive demon dragon monster that looks terrifying. Here’s what the trailer description for Fallen Dynasty says about the game: 
It looks great, albeit a little scary, and fortunately, we don’t have to wait too long to check it out because Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty hits Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC in early 2023.

                            <span class="media-object__text">
                              <span>Ebb Software showed a new trailer for Scorn at today’s Xbox Games Showcase, and the first-person horror adventure continues to look just as disturbing as ever.
Drawing clear lines of inspiration from the famous artist, H.R. Giger, Scorn features some of the same disconcerting imagery that is a part of the art from movies like Alien, in which biological and mechanical elements seem to merge.
The new trailer continues to embrace those elements, with more than a little bit of body horror mixed in for good measure. The video shows numerous instances of disconnected human appendages attached to strange, non-human machines and creatures. And the protagonist appears to be horribly mutilated in the brief glimpses we get of their arms and other body parts.
Ebb has stated in the past that Scorn is aiming for a cohesive “lived-in” world, in which players are thrown in the deep-end by arriving and having to try and grasp what is even happening in the spaces they explore. Environments are said to be maze-like and individual regions are open and exploreable, but interconnected with other distinct spaces.
The developers are also touting the game’s focus on full-body awareness. Rather than have items simply floating in the world and having them picked up by magic, every object is a real thing that your character must lift or move with their own hands, hopefully leading to a greater sense of immersion. And, given the subject matter, a likely greater sense of disquiet.
While the environment and creature design is certainly impressive, I continue to have a number of questions about the nature of gameplay in the project. I’m eager to understand more about the nature of the puzzles and characters that are part of the surreal game world, but this latest trailer does little to illuminate either.
Scorn is headed to Xbox Game Pass, but more generally will be available on Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC, and on the Cloud when it releases on October 21, 2022.</span>

In the trailer, we see the pilotable mech farming around its new, strange world – growing crops, building structures, and generally exploring the surroundings. The trailer ends on a mysterious discovery, though as you might expect, does little to show what that may be. 
Check it out in the trailer below:


According to Lightyear Frontier&#x27;s Steam page:
&quot;Lightyear Frontier is a peaceful open-world farming adventure on a planet at the far edge of the galaxy. Start your new home on a distant planet with up to three friends as you farm alien crops, build your own homestead, and explore the untamed wilderness of the world.&quot;

Lightyear Frontier will be released into Early Access next spring on Xbox consoles and PC. According to the trailer, it&#x27;s a console launch exclusive.</span>

                              <span>6/12 UPDATE: 
As we previously reported below, a leak heavily hinted that Forza Horizon 5&#x27;s first expansion would be a Hot Wheels crossover. Today, at the Xbox Games Showcase, it was not only confirmed, but a high-speed trailer featuring the toy cars from our childhoods whizzed across the screen on the tracks and red loops we&#x27;ve come to know. You can watch the trailer above. The expansion hits on July 19. 
PREVIOUS STORY
According to Eurogamer, Forza Horizon 5’s first expansion – a Hot Wheels crossover – leaked on the Steam store listing and was immediately taken down. The listing was posted to Reddit, where it gained traction. You can see the image of the crossover below. 
This wouldn’t be the first time the two car-racing giants joined forces. Hot Wheels DLC packages sped onto the scenic tracks of Forza Motorsport 5 and Forza Horizon 3 and 4. What Playground Games has in store with its latest arcade racing simulator is anyone’s guess. 
Forza Horizon 5 cracked Game Informer’s Top 10 Games of 2021 list: 
“To merely say Forza Horizon 5 is among the most mechanically sound racing games ever created would be a disservice and overlook what makes the game worthy of praise. Yes, the foundational act of driving feels fantastic, but it’s the rest of the package that truly elevates this fifth entry in the series to the rarified air that demands a place on our list of the top 10 games of the year.”
Are you excited about the alleged crossover?

Ara: History Untold comes from Oxide Games, which previously shipped Ashes of the Singularity. The game is slated to come to Xbox Game Pass PC and Steam at an unspecified date.</span>

                              <span>Blizzard Entertainment showed up strong to the Xbox and Bethesda showcase with a new look at Overwatch 2. The publisher had plenty to show from the hero shooter, including a new character and the announcement of the day it&#x27;ll enter Early Access, October 4.


When it hits Early Access, Overwatch 2&#x27;s PvP content will be free-to-play, giving players who want to play matches with or against friends the chance to do so at no cost. It&#x27;ll also have a new character called The Junker Queen who got her own cinematic trailer, introducing her Mad-Max-meets-punk-rock persona in a handicap match against some nasty-looking fellas. The Junker Queen uses an ax and shotgun to tear through other heroes on the OW battlefield. We&#x27;ll learn more about her on June 16, when Blizzard holds an Overwatch 2 reveal event.
Blizzard promises regular content updates for Overwatch 2, including new maps, modes, heroes, and even more. Also, because this showed up on the Xbox showcase doesn&#x27;t mean the information above isn&#x27;t any less true for the other platforms OW2 is planned to launch on. Overwatch 2 will hit Early Access on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC at the same time.</span>

                              <span>In Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn, you take control of Nor Vanek and wage war against the gods. She isn&#x27;t alone in her pursuit and is joined by a blue, mystical fox named Enki. Today&#x27;s Xbox Games Showcase gave us an advanced look at this 2023 action/RPG, showing off traversal, combat, boss fights, and more. 
In many sequences, we see Nor and Enki in the middle of vast battlefields, using a variety of weapons and magics to dispose of any soldier or beast that stands in their way. The footage is impressive, both in scale and the level of detail in the worlds. Nor and Enki appear to have swift aerial traversal means to get across terrain quickly. Like most games in Xbox&#x27;s showcase, developer A44 Games and publisher Kepler Interactive are releasing Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn on Game Pass on day one.</span>

                              <span>Pete Hines took the stage at today&#x27;s Xbox Showcase to introduce a bevy of Bethesda projects. Among looks at Elder Scrolls Online and a recap on Redfall, which kicked the event off in style, the Bethesda exec revealed a new expansion for Fallout 76. The company&#x27;s online multiplayer game had a rough start, but Bethesda has continued to work on its title, with several story expansions and updates to the game&#x27;s world. However, this is the first update we&#x27;ve had for the title in a while, as the last major expansion came last year.
The Pitt&#x27;s story will take place in post-war Pittsburgh, a location we haven&#x27;t seen since Fallout 3. Described as &quot;a grim industrial wasteland crippled by conflict,&quot; players will be teaming up with the Union, a band of mechanically skilled fighters seeking to rid their home of raiders that have taken over called the Fanatics. This task will be made even harder by the fact that The Pitt&#x27;s toxic wasteland is warping the mind of its inhabitants. 


Fallout 76&#x27;s Expeditions: The Pitt is coming this September.</span>

                              <span>Microsoft and Mojang have revealed Minecraft Legends, an action strategy game coming to Xbox consoles and PC. 
This news comes from today’s Xbox &amp; Bethesda Games Showcase, where Mojang revealed the Legends trailer. The story shows the destruction of a village and the rebirth of a new land thanks to some heroic deeds of friendship, bravery, and more. According to the trailer, the game tells the story of a united overworld, and that overworld is to be united by none other than you, the player. 
Check out the reveal trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Legends is quite the departure from the typical Minecraft formula. Breaking away from the survival crafting mold the series has held for over a decade, similar to what Minecraft Dungeons did in 2020, Legends will be the first action strategy game in Mojang’s blocky world. It also features a unique spin on the traditional Minecraft visuals.
It retains the blockiness fans of Minecraft have come to know and love, but with a more distinct, almost comic book-ey style. It looks great, and fortunately, we don’t have to wait too long to play it because it hits Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC sometime next year. 
While waiting for Minecraft Legends, read Game Informer’s Minecraft Dungeons review.

                              <span>Amicia and Hugo want to start a new life, but they need to find somewhere safe where this dream can be realized. In a new trailer for Asobo Studio&#x27;s A Plague Tale: Requiem, we see them traveling south, across treacherous terrain and into thriving villages. These places look like they could be safe havens, but we quickly see guards expanding their search and are everywhere.
The new footage shows stealth maneuvers captured in striking detail. We see Amicia hiding under a table to evade a patrol and being surprisingly aggressive, using weapons to silently take out guards. We also see her use fire to create a blaze that will surely draw out every guard in the area.
Of course, Hugo&#x27;s curse doesn&#x27;t remain dormant for long and a flood of rats appears to keep him safe. A Plague Tale: Requiem still doesn&#x27;t have an official release date, but is still slated to release in 2022 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC. You&#x27;ll be able to play it on Xbox Game Pass on day one.</span>

                              <span>Early in today’s Xbox Game Showcase, Riot Games’ president, Marc Merrill, took a few minutes to announce a big new partnership with Xbox and its Game Pass program. A number of Riot’s biggest experiences are coming to Xbox Game Pass on mobile and PC, with relatively robust options unlocked for players to enjoy.
First, Riot’s flagship property, League of Legends, will see all champions unlocked on PC.
In League of Legends: Wild Rift, it’s a similar picture, with all champions unlocked on mobile gaming platforms.
In Legends of Runeterra, Game Pass players can expect to have the full Foundations set of cards unlocked. For those not in the know, as the name implies, that’s the foundational cards for the game, establishing the base mechanics. The card set will be available on both PC and mobile.
In Teamfight Tactics, players can expect select Little Legends to be unlocked, whether you play on PC or mobile.
And in Valorant, all agents will be unlocked on PC.
It’s a notable team-up that should give a boost to both Xbox and Riot. On the Riot side, the availability of so many characters and sets across the spectrum of their games means that a potentially huge audience of Xbox players could have a chance to experience a broad spectrum of what each of those games have to offer. To Xbox’s benefit, it offers a meaningful boost to the already potent draw of Xbox Games Pass as a service and experience, since players can gain access to a number of aspects of each of those Riot games without needing to pay additional costs.
While Riot’s expansion into Game Pass is big news, it’s worth noting that it won’t have much effect for players on Xbox consoles, as all the available options are coming to specific combinations of PC and mobile, depending on titles.
The availability of all of these options is said to be coming this winter for Game Pass subscribers.</span>

                              <span>The highly anticipated Hollow Knight sequel, Silksong, appeared at the Xbox Games Showcase with a snazzy new trailer, but the biggest news is it will be playable day one on Xbox Game Pass.
Announced back in 2019, Hollow Knight: Silksong takes place in a haunted kingdom swarming with bugs. As insectoid creature Hornet, your weapon of choice is a needle. The gameplay is said to be largely similar to its predecessor, but with an increased focus on speed. The latest trailer showed off more of what to expect, with an impressive showing of the striking art style, swift platforming, and unique baddies. You can watch the trailer above to see what I mean. 
No release date was revealed for the Xbox and PC versions.</span>

                              <span>Microsoft and Turn 10 Studios have revealed Forza Motorsport (that’s right – there’s no number attached to this entry in the franchise) with a beautiful trailer. 
Revealed during today’s Xbox &amp; Bethesda Games Showcase, Turn 10’s latest motorsport game will hit Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC in spring of next year. The studio calls it the “most technologically advanced racing game ever made.” To highlight these technological advances, the team showcased Maple Valley, a fan-favorite track alongside news that the game will have a dynamic day-and-night cycle, a first for the Motorsport series.
Check out the reveal trailer for yourself below: 


Not to be confused with Playground Games’ Forza Horizon series, Motorsport is closer to a racing sim than it is an arcade racer, making it an especially great time for people who really like to get under the hood of the vehicles they race. To go with that, there’s plenty of environment tech happening in Forza Motorsport to simulate not just how the cars would drive, but how the time of day, the temperature associated with it, and more can affect the race. 
Check out this demo trailer for more information about that: 


All of it looks great thanks to ray-tracing, photorealism techniques, and more. That includes the car damage your vehicle will endure when you hit other drivers or barriers on the track, too. 
 
While waiting for it to hit Xbox consoles and PC next year, read Game Informer’s Forza Horizon 5 review.

                              <span>Squanch Games has announced High On Life, a new first-person shooter from the mind of Rick and Morty creator Justin Roiland. 
Squanch Games revealed High On Life during today’s Xbox gaming showcase, and the first trailer for it highlights talking guns, alien cartels, and plenty of Roiland-style humor. It’s appropriately poppy and colorful, too, and it looks like a great time. Plus, we don’t have to wait too long to play it because it hits Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC (via Steam and the Epic Games Store) later this year. 
“After a cartel of aliens invades Earth, a freshly minted high-school graduate grabs the nearest talking gun and becomes the deadliest intergalactic bounty hunter across the cosmos,” a press release reads. “The alien invaders in High On Life are on a mission to dominate Earth, but with a particularly sinister twist: Garmantuous and his cartel goons are intent on enslaving humanity and using them as a new drug.
“[Defeating] powerful aliens isn’t going to be easy; bounty hunters will work with (or against) NPCs, collect upgrades, and acquire an arsenal of talking guns on their journey. Each of these guns has its own unique personality and special gameplay, and they provide their own narrative take on what’s going on.” 

Squanch Games’ studio director Mike Fridley says to expect Roiland’s comedic voice to tie this game together with all of the studio’s other outputs. He says the studio wants players to look at any of its games and immediately know it’s a Squanch game. 
“I wanted to make games that I wanted to play, and that was the spark that sort of lit the fire of Squanch Games,” Roiland writes in a press release. “Then we shipped Trover, we shipped Accounting+, and now we’re on this absolute dream game that we were kind of building towards this whole time.”

The reveal came at the tail-end of a trailer for the Microsoft Flight Simulator 40th Anniversary edition, which among other aircraft, adds the Wright Brothers&#x27; Wright Flyer airplane.
Our look at the Pelican was brief, though it did end with the aircraft hovering high above the Earth&#x27;s stratosphere.

                              <span>Arkane Studio’s Redfall kicked off the Xbox &amp; Bethesda Games Showcase with the first extended gameplay trailer.
The trailer sets the table for the adventure, which unfolds on the island of Redfall, Massachusetts. The idyllic town falls apart when residents disappear and, worse, become vampires. If that’s not enough, some survivors have taken to worshipping these night creatures as deranged cultists. Up to four players team up as a band of survivors who must fight back and escape Redfall with their lives intact. 


The crew consists of protagonist Layla, who wields telekinesis, the sniper Jacob, the engineer Remy (with a cute robot companion in tow), and cryptid hunter Devinder. The gameplay trailer shows how these four combine their abilities to combat hordes of undead, such as Layla creating a telekinetic elevator to launch an ally skyborne. 
Redfall releases in early 2023 for Xbox Series X/S and PC and will launch day one on Game Pass.</span>

I had a chance to sit in on a demo to learn the ins and outs of the new hub and play Halo Infinite and Flight Simulator to get a sense of how the new gaming hub works. 
Beginning with this update, 2022 Samsung TV owners can access distinct media and gaming hubs. The Media Hub has been re-optimized from its previous iterations to focus on video apps such as Hulu, Netflix, and Amazon. However, the big addition to the upcoming TV update is the Gaming Hub.

                              <span>Last month I wrote about a new set of Linux patches that provide for better power management on AMX-enabled &quot;Sapphire Rapids&quot; servers. The patches help ensure AMX-enabled CPUs can reach their lower power states for maximum power-savings and that also helps ensure other CPU cores have a larger thermal/power budget for hitting their rated turbo frequencies.

                              <span>Passed almost a quarter of a century ago, the DMCA prevents citizens from repairing many of their own electronic devices. The proposed Freedom to Repair Act 2022 seeks to fix this problem by allowing circumvention in strictly limited circumstances. This week the proposal was labeled &quot;pro-piracy legislation&quot; but is that a fair assessment or an expected overreaction?

                              <span>Last year a couple of brothers posted a concept trailer for an FPS horror game that didn&#x27;t exist (named Project Ill). Well, those brothers are now Team Clout and that game now exists, albeit called simply Ill. I&#x27;ve not got much to point you towards - there&#x27;s no Steam Store page, no high-res press screens, no release window. Even calling the video from the Future Games Show a gameplay trailer is taking the biscuit, if not most of the factory floor at McVities. But the vibes, as they say, are immaculate: bare feet on a grubby floor, shambling horrors with many half-glimpsed appendages, and a gun that is surely too small to protect you from any of it. Resident Evil but injected with your most virulent 2022 strain.

                              <span>Palworld has a new trailer. If you&#x27;ve seen Palworld&#x27;s previous two trailers, those words alone should send you rushing below to see what new absurdity is on show. For the uninitiated: Palworld is a game in which you can catch off-brand Pokémon, put them to work in a sweatshop producing guns, and then do battle with these Nopémon by your side and and an assault rifle in your hands.

Watch the trailer, you&#x27;ll see.

                              <span>Back in January of this year RPS regular contributor Edwin Evans-Thirlwell interviewed Ami Y. Cai, developer of The Cartomancy Anthology, as part of his efforts to dig into the mystery of why tarot is such a popular inspiration for indie games at the moment. Happily, after today&#x27;s Future Of Play Direct, we can provide you with a little update on that story: Cai&#x27;s expansive collaborative project is due to release on Steam very soon: on August 9th, 2022.

The Entropy Centre’s due out this year. Although it could probably be out whenever it likes if it fires at a calendar of games releases. Have your ideas about physics turned upside down when you watch the trailer below. Or is it above?

                              <span>Tinykin is about an astronaut named Milo returning to earth after a long space voyage. Milo might reasonably fall to his knees and scream &quot;You blew it up, damn you!&quot; when he gets there, because the earth he lands upon has been blown up several times larger than normal - either that or he&#x27;s been made much smaller and is now the size of a penny. Milo must then have to navigate the abandoned world with a Pikmin-like army of aliens by his side, ready to solve puzzles. 

It looks great, and after being announced last year, Tinykin now has a release date of August 25th.

                              <span>If there&#x27;s anything I&#x27;ve learned from today&#x27;s Future Of Play event, it&#x27;s that stylish futuristic dystopian mysteries are where it&#x27;s at right now in the indie scene, and I for one am all in favour. One of the coolest announcements at the event was Hill Agency: PURITYdecay, described as an &quot;Indigenous cybernoir detective game&quot; and in the works at Achimostawinan Games. Although maybe &quot;in the works&quot; isn&#x27;t quite an accurate description, because the game is in fact out very soon: on August 31st this year, to be exact.
The trailer is a pitch-perfect hearkening back to the golden age hardboiled detective stories of the 1940s — complete with a black-and-white palette with just the occasional hint of colour to highlight the high-tech parts. High-tech because, despite its 20th century influences, this game is set quite far in the future, in 2262. It&#x27;s not exactly a nice vision of the world in 240 years&#x27; time, though, as the narrator is quick to point out that it&#x27;s riddled with &quot;crime, conflict, and propaganda&quot;. Truly holding up a mirror to our times, then.

Key takeaway is that everyone in this has a faced like a slapped Bulldog&#x27;s bum. Nobody is having a fun time.

                              <span>Bramble: The Mountain King is an action-adventure game inspired by grim Nordic folktales, where the bosses you&#x27;ll encounter may have some horrible backstory which explains why they now drown people for funsies. It&#x27;s also seemingly a game where you&#x27;re a wee smout and can ride on the back of a friendly hedgehog. There&#x27;s a new trailer which covers both of these elements below.

                              <span>I adore Deadly Premonition, a game which shines despite substantial elements being janky or bad. The 2010 horror game about an oddball FBI agent investigating ritual murders in small-town America is not &quot;so bad it&#x27;s good&quot;, it&#x27;s so good it doesn&#x27;t matter that it&#x27;s bad (and maybe the badness even amplifies the good). Well, I&#x27;ve been playing Deadly Premonition 2 ahead of its PC release today, and I&#x27;m sorry to say the sequel does not shake out the same way. Despite some bright spots, enough of Deadly Premonition 2 is bad that I&#x27;ve given up.

In the former we got a bit of a primer on Tove Jansson&#x27;s work as the source material for this game, but in the latter we got a better look at the game in motion - plus news that ethereal Icelandic rockers Sigur Rós are collaborating on the sound track.

                              <span>One of the most intriguing new announcements at today&#x27;s Future Of Play event had to be Psychroma, a cyberpunk horror adventure game in the works by indie developer/publisher Rocket Adrift Games. The devs describe their game as a narrative-driven side-scroller where you play as a digital medium. Imagine something halfway between Observer and Detention, then, and you&#x27;ll be on the right lines.
The trailer harks back to the point-and-click mysteries beloved of my misspent youth, which really fits in with Psychroma&#x27;s whole retro futuristic vibe. It&#x27;s got that clever pixel art style that looks exactly how you remember golden age adventure games looking in the &#x27;90s, which of course means that it&#x27;s much, much more polished and modern than those games ever were.

                              <span>Revealed at the Future Games Show tonight, Tray Racers is a game clearly derived from a dev accidentally doing a spoonerism in a meeting one time. This SEO nightmare is being developed by Bit Loom, the team behind colourful yet somehow unsettling puzzle game Phogs, and it&#x27;s about racing down sand dunes on trays. As the trailer says, &quot;the world ended... But the fun didn’t!&quot;, and I guess winning a dune race would take your mind off the unending horror for a bit.

Hot on the heels of the news that Boyfriend Dungeon will be receiving a substantial free update, they unveiled Mossfield Origins, the next game coming courtesy of their publishing arm.
Developed by Studio Any Percent, Mossfield Origins promises an extremely relaxing take on the sci-fi city builder genre. The announcement trailer, which you can check out below, opens with a serene disembodied voice setting the tone for what&#x27;s to come. &quot;We were sent here with a purpose,&quot; the voice murmurs soothingly, then adds: &quot;But we&#x27;re not doing that any more.&quot;

                              <span>Dungeon crawler-slash-dating sim Boyfriend Dungeon will receive a substantial free update this summer and will feature three new dateable characters — not two, as was previously announced. The surprise new addition, revealed at tonight&#x27;s Future Of Play stream, will be the sinister Dr Holmes the Whip, the final boss of the brand new dungeon which is also being added in the Secret Weapons DLC.

You think I can slow time to infinity when I need it? So I&#x27;ve done you a little roundup of the games that caught my eye this time. There&#x27;s some action, some horror and some puzzles. Fun for all the family!

                              <span>When I was a student I used to spend way too much time scrolling through the endlessly refreshing collection of horror flashfiction on r/nosleep. Consequently I&#x27;m a fan of horror anthologies in the vein of No Code&#x27;s Stories Untold. Upcoming freak &#x27;em up The Fridge Is Red (developed by 5Word Team) looks like r/nosleep having a story jam about the fridge you have to stare at off of Control, so I&#x27;m into it. Look out for it in 2022, but the trailer says there&#x27;s a free demo on Steam now.

                              <span>2017&#x27;s Serial Cleaner was all about stealthfully infiltrating a murder scene and cleaning up the mess before the cops got their hands on any evidence. Developer Draw Distance is taking that concept and expanding on it further with Serial Cleaners, offering more ways to play and even more gruesome crimes to cover up.


Unlike its 70s-inspired predecessor, Serial Cleaners pulls from pop culture of the 1990s, including Quinten Tarantino&#x27;s body of work and other classic action and crime thrillers of the era. Once again, stealth is core to the experience; you can&#x27;t let the authorities know what happened at each crime scene. Serial Cleaners brings four characters to mop up blood, bodies, and clues, each handling business in their own way. Players will utilize these new cleaners&#x27; street smarts, tech, brute force, or classic know-how to get the job done.
If you&#x27;re ready to aid and abet in some gnarly virtual killings, Serial Cleaners is set to release on September 22 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.</span>

                              <span>We got a new look today at Arctic Awakening, the upcoming first-person narrative game from GoldFire Studios. Players control Kai, a cargo pilot who was on a relatively routine supply delivery to a small Alaskan town with his partner, when their plane goes down in the middle of nowhere. Donovan, the co-pilot, is lost out in the cold and snowy wastes, and Kai sets out to find him.
As Kai, you must explore the freezing cold wilds, and the environment is a constant threat. The game is set in April of 2062, so there are a few things that are a bit different than one might expect to find in a modern-day setting, including a court-mandated therapy bot that is along with you on your journey. The AI drone has no shortage of pithy commentary to share with you as you navigate the wilderness, but has little in the way of helpful tools or weapons that might aid in your survival efforts.
Beyond the exploration elements, Arctic Awakening focuses on narrative choice, and the way those choices shift the relationships and situations of the characters around you. The decisions you make also affect the way the game ends.
Beyond narrative elements, GoldFire Studios is promising dynamic weather that shifts over time, meaning even areas you’ve visited already may be different when you return to them a second time.
As Kai explores, it becomes increasingly apparent that something more sinister is going on out there in the wilderness. High-tech facilities and mysterious technology is everywhere, providing a sense of mystery tinged with terror.
Arctic Awakening is targeting launch on consoles, PC, and Mac something in 2023. It will be released as a collection of five 60-90 minute chapters for players to take on at their own pace.</span>

The newest trailer debuted at GamesRadar&#x27;s Future Game Show, giving us a better look at these little creatures and how they&#x27;ll help Milo in his journey. Milo can stack tinykin to reach higher places, toss them at enemies, and enlist them to carry objects. A blue tinykin allows Milo to produce a powerful electric current. A red tinykin can be thrown like a bomb to blow up enemies. 
Tinykin launches on August 30 for PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC.

                              <span>Today’s Future Games Show gave us a new look at Bramble: The Mountain King, a visually arresting upcoming game from Dimfrost Studio. Players control a young protagonist named Olle as he as he explores a world of misty Nordic fairy tales in a forbidding wilderness, and the strange and deadly creatures that crop up along the way. His journey is motivated by a hope to rescues his lost sister.
The studio is aiming to offer a compelling juxtaposition of beautiful natural environments and sudden, horrifying moments of danger – all reflected in high-quality visuals. That goal is clearly presented in the game’s footage, which has an attractive and lush art style that immediately captures the mood.
The studio describes a focus on “David vs. Goliath” bosses as you explore nature. As an illustration of the concept, the new trailer discusses the strange creature called the Näcken, perhaps inspired by the myth of the Nykr. In the game, the Näcken plays its magical violin from its watery home, and lures people to their deaths by drowning in the lake. He was once a normal man who was terribly bullied by those around him, who eventually snapped and killed everyone close to him – including the girl that he loved.
Based on the description explored in the trailer, it’s clear that Dimfrost is interested in exploring the backstories and foundational elements of each monster’s narratives as part of the unfolding game. The Näcken is just one of many strange creatures that players encounter in the game.
The footage reveals the young explorer navigating creepy 3D environments, often as imposing giant creatures lurk in the background. Gameplay is said to focus on puzzle-solving and platforming.
Dimfrost Studio is previously known for its work creating the 2017 release, A Writer And His Daughter, a VR exploration game.
Bramble: The Mountain King is on the way to PC and consoles later in 2022.</span>

                              <span>Kumi Souls Games has been rather quiet on social media about its upcoming gothic-horror action game The Last Faith, but as part of the Future Games Show presentation, we were able to see how it&#x27;s shaping up. The fresh footage shows Belmont-esque protagonist Eric as he brutalizes everything in his path, destroying plenty of beautifully drawn monsters, and faces off against a towering and salivating hydra beast.
The Last Faith borrows heavily from Castlevania and games like Dark souls, offering what looks to be a tough, violent affair. Eric has plenty of weapons and attacks in his arsenal including a fiery haymaker punch, a shocking electrified blade, and a shotgun to keep the enemies in check at mid-range. He also utilizes gruesome execution moves to take foes down for good; it&#x27;s strangely impressive how gross some details of these attacks come off in the pixel low-rez art.
Following a successful Kickstarter campaign in 2020, Kumi Souls Games have been hard at work on the 2D action game. Since then, publisher Playstack has picked up The Last Faith for distribution, and the final game is starting to come together.
We don&#x27;t have an exact release date for The Last Faith quite yet, but the trailer does solidify a 2022 launch target on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.</span>

                              <span>The summer showcases are going strong, and we&#x27;ve seen plenty of games that catch our eye. After the Future Games Show today, we&#x27;ll be adding one more to the list: Sunday Gold. 
Sunday Gold is a &quot;classic adventure&quot; game from developer BKOM Studios and publisher Team17. The point-and-click, turn-based title has serious Disco Elysium vibes, though its dystopian future London looks to be a little more over-the-top. The game&#x27;s leading characters, a group of scrappy criminals, are on a mission to reveal the truth behind the unethical business practices of corrupt billionaire, Keny Hogan. And today&#x27;s trailer showed the bombastic length&#x27;s they&#x27;re ready to go to achieve that goal. Check out the world premiere trailer below.


Fully voiced and filled with puzzles alongside the combat, Sunday Gold is set to launch on PC later this year.</span>

                              <span>Lost in Play, a cartoon narrative adventure in the vein of shows like Over The Garden Wall, got a new launch date today. It will now be released on August 10, as announced during GamesRadar&#x27;s Future Games Show livestream. 
The new trailer shows our protagonists – a brother and sister – on their whimsical journey through childhood animation. You can see it below:


Interestingly, per Lost in Play&#x27;s Steam page, the game has no dialogue; storytelling is told visually. That story will take the brother and sister to a &quot;goblin castle&quot; and &quot;ancient ruins,&quot; as well as letting them &quot;soar atop a giant stork.&quot;
Lost in Play will be released on Switch and PC.</span>

                              <span>Turbo Golf Racing turned heads when it was revealed in March thanks to its blend of golf with Rocket League-style racing. During today’s Future Game Show, we found out that the wacky sports game is coming this August. Can’t wait? Don’t despair; you can play the game in its second beta right now. 
For the unfamiliar, the game pits up to eight players against each other as they race giant golf balls down obstacle-filled courses to knock them into the finish cup. Vehicles can jump and glide, and collecting power-ups lets players hit the ball further, and perform ground stomps, among other abilities. 


Developer Secret Mode announced that Turbo Golf Racing launches on Xbox consoles and PC on August 4. Beginning today, Beta 2 kicks off on Steam Early Access and Xbox Game Preview. This larger test features 12 courses, eight-player online multiplayer (with crossplay), single-player time trials, and improvements based on feedback from Beta 1. Leveling up during Beta 2 unlocks exclusive cosmetic wheels, an avatar, and a spoiler for the final game. Beta 2 concludes on June 20. 
Turbo Golf Racing arrives to Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC on August 4 and will be available on Game Pass.</span>

                              <span>The Entropy Centre, a sci-fi first-person puzzle adventure game, was just showcased during today’s Future Games Show conference, and it’s coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC later this year. 
The gameplay trailer did not reveal a release date, but with only half a year left, you at least know you’ll be waiting no more than roughly six months for it. That’s great because The Entropy Centre looks like an intriguing and fun puzzle game. A new British indie studio called Stubby Games is developing it, and Playstack is publishing the title. It is built around a puzzle mechanic that “allows players to think in reverse and overcome seemingly impossible obstacles,” such as the game’s main obstacle: reversing time far enough back to stop Earth from imploding.

                              <span>Announced last year with a short trailer, Luto made an appearance as part of the Future Games Show presentation. This first-person horror experience is bound to scare the pants off of somebody, especially with its impressive cloth rendering, making a particular terror in the new footage a sight to behold.


Developer Broken Bird Games is looking to create an immersive and emotional experience with Luto. Players take control of a character attempting to escape from their house, but trying to do just that will take you to some wild and spooky places. The new footage is full of atmospheric locales, such as dilapidated rooms filled with mysterious chains, dark hallways populated by sheet-covered individuals, and a hollowed-out cave system. Much of the lighting and materials presented in the footage look great, especially the sheet physics and rendering of an entity that breaks into a hallway and rises to its feet in an unsettling way.
Luto is set to launch on PlayStation and PC in 2022.</span>

                              <span>Glitch&#x27;s Future of Play Direct is back for its third year, providing plenty of first looks,  premieres, and launch announcements for a bevy of games. The direct, hosted by V-tuber A.I. broadcaster Melios, showcased new trailers featuring a glut of different genres and unique premises. Here&#x27;s what stood out for us. 


Boyfriend Dungeon: Secret Weapons 
This dungeon crawler and dating sim hybrid officially launched last year and came with the promise of a free update complete with a new dungeon and love interests. Well, we&#x27;re finally getting a look at it. The new trailer introduced us to Hammer Laleh, who has a special ability called &quot;the death spiral.&quot; Axe Johan, who we briefly met in the main game, is also returning to capture our hearts. Unsurprisingly, his special dungeon ability is &quot;the…</span>

From contemplative to whimsical, ambitious to comforting, around 100 games were nestled into the show. And while it was tough, we narrowed down the field to bring you a list of our most anticipated games from the show. Grab a cup of tea and get comfy because here are the cozy highlights.
Lil Gator Game
Being developed by the wonderfully named development team MegaWobble, Little Gator Game is a brazenly Zelda-inspired title with a lively sense of humor and more than a dash of eye-catching art.

As you might expect, gameplay consists of walking around a small open area, taking pictures of items in the environment, and then learning the Japanese word for said item. You can study learned words by looking at your in-game photo album. Shashingo also has reading and listening lessons and a &quot;Find Mode,&quot; which tests your knowledge of the words you&#x27;ve learned. 
Check it out in the trailer below: 


While we weren&#x27;t given a release date, Shashingo&#x27;s trailer said it&#x27;s &quot;coming soon.&quot; It will be available on Switch and PC.</span>

Star Trek: Resurgence lets players boldly guide an original crew where no man has gone before. By that, they get to determine the fate of a new team of space explorers and the stakes of an interspecies conflict in a choice-driven adventure. During Summer Game Fest Play Days, I got to navigate a particularly tense situation to get a taste of the sorts of decisions players will face and their potential consequences. 
Resurgence’s original story unfolds in the year 2380, shortly after the events of Star Trek: The Next Generation, specifically its feature films. Players control two central members of the Resolute. First up…</span>

                              <span>Guerilla Collective&#x27;s Summer Game Fest-adjacent live stream revealed a slew of new and upcoming indie games. But among the Braid-like puzzle platformers and narrative adventures were several horror games worth keeping an eye on. Here&#x27;s what stood out to us. 


The Fridge is Red
Easily the highlight of today&#x27;s stream, The Fridge is Red looks like what you might find if you went video game shopping in Hell. Heavily inspired by PlayStation 1 horror games – specifically Silent Hill – it tells the story of Frank, stuck in his basement staring for days at the titular red fridge. &quot;Not only the fear of a terrible death keeps him in place, but also the hope of getting his daughter back,&quot; the game&#x27;s Steam page reads. 
The Fridge is Red is a collection of different horror stories – or &quot;episodes.&quot; In …</span>

                              <span>Summer Game Fest is in full swing, and we&#x27;re covering the best games the showcase has to offer, including Cuphead: The Delicious Last Course. Join Game Informer as we chat with Maja Moldenhauer, studio director at Studio MDHR, about the exciting DLC, the new bosses players will be facing, and what the developers are planning on for the future.


Alex Stadnik is here to ask the burning questions fans might have. The two start things off by discussing what the team brought to Summer Game Fest and chat about the ins and outs of the Mortimer Freeze boss fight. They then discuss what players can expect from the five major fights found in The Delicious Last Course and how the stages change the experience from the main game.
They then move to Ms. Chalice, the new character that isn&#x27;t a carbon copy of the title&#x27;s namesake or Mugman. One of the main additions of the DLC streamlines the experience with a new moveset and abilities but is far from an easy mode. Players will have to sacrifice some of the buffs they were used to in the main game in order to use her as she&#x27;s activated as a charm.
The two also discuss how Studio MDHR developed the game through COVID, how the soundtrack is yet again a highlight, and whether or not players can expect new secrets when they boot up the DLC on June 30. Finally, Stadnik and Maja round out the interview and briefly discuss what&#x27;s next for the studio.
If you enjoyed this look at Cuphead: The Delicious Last Course, be sure to check out our recent preview impressions, our talk about the DLC on this week&#x27;s GI Show, and our fresh episode of New Gameplay Today showing off the Mortimer Freeze boss fight! Thanks, as always, for watching!</span>

Capcom&#x27;s reveal of Street Fighter 6 at the conclusion of this year&#x27;s Pro Tour set the table for the next entry in perhaps the most beloved fighting franchise of all time. Following meager offerings at launch, Street Fighter V, which launched in 2016, rebounded to give fans a ton of features, fighters, and content by the end of its lifecycle. Street Fighter 6 hopes to avoid those initial stumbles by including various modes of play from the get go, but my hands-on time during Summer Game Fest 2022&#x27;s Play Days in Los Angeles, California was all about seeing how matches play out.

                              <span>You likely already saw all the news and trailers out of the Summer Game Fest streams this year (and if you haven&#x27;t, you can get caught up right here), but Summer Game Fest 2022&#x27;s Play Days are happening right now in downtown Los Angeles. There, members of the media and content creators from around the globe have congregated for two days of interviews, live demos, and hands-on play sessions. 
While the Play Days aren&#x27;t nearly on the scale of something like E3, which would typically happen during this time of year annually, the Game Informer crew has seen plenty of amazing games over the course of our time there. Check out our favorite titles we&#x27;ve seen, played, and talked about below, and be sure to click the links to read our full preview or watch a New Gameplay Today if we have one.

News such as the reveal of The Last of Us Part I, TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge’s release date, new Marvel’s Midnight Suns info, and Guile coming to Street Fighter 6, to name a few.

He earned millions of dollars and traveled the world, but also spent time in prison. Despite being wanted by the FBI for his alleged involvement with Nintendo hacking group Team Xecuter, Louarn doesn&#x27;t view himself as a criminal, but as a rebel instead.

Are you a fan of Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow? Are you a fan of Blasphemous? If you answered &quot;yes&quot; to both of those questions (heck, even just one), then you&#x27;ll definitely want to keep an eye out for The Last Faith, a Souls-like Metroidvania (or &#x27;soulsvania&#x27;, according to the publisher) making its way to Switch later in 2022.
From developer Kumi Souls Games, The Last Faith showcases gorgeous pixelated visuals along with challenging gameplay in a clear homage to Konami&#x27;s seminal Castlevania series. You&#x27;ll be navigating winding paths filled with deadly beasts before finding yourself toe-to-toe against huge boss creatures that will demand you make the most of your varied weaponry.

This is the halfway point, the Part One of two, where we stop for a minute to check in with the game, and how much we&#x27;re enjoying it.
For June 2022, the vote decided on Return of the Obra Dinn, and god, it&#x27;s good, isn&#x27;t it?

Another day, another Metroidvania! You love to see it, right? The latest title, 9 Years of Shadows, comes from developer Halberd Studios and is due for launch on Switch later this year.
Visually, the game looks spectacular, with some lovely use of colour and lighting throughout.

Hurrah for Sonic Origins! The upcoming compilation looks to be a fairly definitive take on the classic Mega Drive and Mega CD Sonic games, with widescreen presentation and various quality of life features.
It’s hardly the first time that Sonic has been collected, though, is it? In fact, he’s no stranger to the world of the compilation whatsoever. We’re taking a look back through the history of Sonic compilation packages, in order to see which ones got it right, which went wrong, and what Sonic Origins could possibly learn from them.

Sega has shared quite a bit of footage of Sonic Frontiers now, but one thing blue blur fans haven&#x27;t seen yet is the title screen.
If you have been wondering what it might look like, you&#x27;re potentially in luck. Screenshots are surfacing on social media of the demo&#x27;s title screen. It comes via the in-person Summer Game Fest &#x27;Play Days&#x27; event.

Well folks, it&#x27;s been another jam-packed week at Nintendo Life, with plenty of highlights to mention! First up, the excellent Mario Strikers: Battle League launched on Friday and we thought it was a great sports game for the Switch in our review. Similarly, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords launched digitally on the eShop, but Limited Run Games confirmed a physical release of the game later this year, along with a boat load of other announcements.
Elsewhere, we got our first glimpse at the long-awaited Flashback 2 at the Summer Game Fest live stream, bringing an end to an agonising 30-year wait. We also got a release date for TMNT: Shredder&#x27;s Revenge, and it&#x27;s a lot closer than you might expect! Finally, in a bittersweet story, the folks over on Twitter rallied together to help a young cancer patient connect with The Pokémon Company.

A bit like DOOM, id Software&#x27;s first-person shooter Quake has been ported officially (and unofficially) to just about every platform under the sun that&#x27;s capable of running 3D natively. Did you know though there was also a version in development for Nintendo&#x27;s 32-bit handheld the Game Boy Advance?
In 2002, Randy Linden - a veteran programmer known for the &quot;impossible&quot; SNES port of DOOM and the creator of the BLEEM emulator - was working on a Quake prototype for GBA. The video game archivists at Forest of Illusion have now been supplied with a working ROM of Linden&#x27;s prototype:

It&#x27;s almost time for beat-em-up sequel River City Saga: Three Kingdoms on the Nintendo Switch! Unless you&#x27;re in Japan, that is, because the game is already out over there. But for us in the West, the Nintendo Switch release date is July 21st, 2022 — and it&#x27;s looking rather lovely.
The game is based on the Three Kingdoms of 3rd century China, and appears to be split between three playable factions. You might recognise the Three Kingdoms from games like Dynasty Warriors, or even the recently-announced Reigns: Three Kingdoms.

                              <span>Square Enix and People Can Fly have unveiled more details of the endgame for Worldslayer, the upcoming first paid expansion to their online co-op action RPG Outriders. Outriders’ creative director Bartek Kmita says there’s “hundreds of hours of meaningful progression” in Worldslayer’s endgame, which sounds like a lot, but the focus is mostly on the replayable big new Trial of Tarya Gratar dungeon. Check out the full broadcast below for some shooty footage.

The Lord Of The Rings: Return To Moria is a multiplayer action survival game about the Dwarves trying to reclaim the most cursed mine in all of fantasy canon. It&#x27;s due out in Spring 2023 and will, of course, be an Epic Games Store exclusive.

                              <span>Guns and swords are a useful combination, so imagine having a gat-toting frog riding on top of a blade-wielding robot. That’s essentially the cut and thrust of Moving Pictures Interactive’s roguelite co-op action adventure Shoulders Of Giants, coming to the Epic Games Store later this year. They’re not quite a 21st century Banjo-Kazooie, but they’ll do in a pinch.

Equally, what is building a jigsaw but piecing together an analogue cardboard PC you can&#x27;t do anything with after it&#x27;s finished? These similarities are why building a PC isn&#x27;t as strange a subject for a videogame as it first appears.

If you like your electric jigsaws, then good news: there&#x27;s now an open beta available for PC Building Simulator 2.

                              <span>Ever since Diablo Immortal launched amid a storm of controversy last week, people have been trying to work out how much it really costs to play this theoretically free game. I&#x27;ll be honest that maths has never been my strongest suit, but figuring out how games work under-the-hood is one of my favourite things to do. So I&#x27;ve spent most of this week chasing answers, and I&#x27;ve come up with a ballpark estimate of what it would cost to max out your character. The answer is: £46,000, or $51,000, to fully equip your character with the best gear as quickly as possible using premium currencies.

                              <span>One time in the office (so, a hundred years ago) a hypothetical was posed: if you were given the chance to go to the moon, with a guarantee that nothing would go wrong, would you take it? &quot;No,&quot; I said. &quot;No way. Not a chance. I wouldn&#x27;t like it.&quot; People were shocked at my refusal. &quot;But nothing will go wrong!&quot; they exclaimed. This misses the universal truth that even - and indeed, especially - when it is guaranteed nothing will go wrong, something will always go wrong in space.
Honestly, who can say that they&#x27;ve played a video game set on a space station and not encountered at least one deserted corridor plunged into darkness, but with one spotlight tipped over onto its side to cast ominous shadows? Raise your hands. Terror in space has never gone out of fashion, really, but the source of the terror does seem to go in cycles. In the 2010s a lot of the danger came from an AI gone a bit sinister and funny. As we saw at last night&#x27;s Summer Game Fest, though, the monsters are back, baby.

                              <span>No, not SHODAN or GLaDOS. I mean the other sort. The magic formulae of raw computer nonsense that runs under the cover of your favourite game and makes enemies flank you, or friendly NPCs toss a health kit just in time. Good AI is not an unbeatable genius. It is smartly stupid. It is both surprisingly clever and capable of wonderful carelessness. It can remind us of ourselves. Quick-witted on a good day, an absolute dunderhead on a bad one. Here&#x27;s a list of the 7 best AI in PC games.

                              <span>Staff who worked for Bethesda on post-apocalyptic multiplayer RPG Fallout 76 have come forward to share their stories from its development, and they don’t make for pleasant reading. Developers who spoke anonymously to Kotaku said they’d crunched in ten-hour shifts over six days a week prior to Fallout 76’s launch, with some saying they fantasised about being injured to avoid having to come into work the following day.

The last we saw of it was back in 2020. It resurfaced tonight during Devolver&#x27;s not-E3 showcase, and dang: it&#x27;s transformed into one of the most beautiful games I&#x27;ve ever seen.

                              <span>Anger Foot. It’s angry and there are certainly plenty of feet. From Free Lives, the creators of Broforce and Genital Jousting, it’s so aggressively kicky that I don’t feel like going near doors anytime soon. They describe it as a “lightning fast hard bass blast of kicking down doors and kicking ass”. Good grief. Keep an eye on the threatening tootsies in the trailer below.

Ve středu však byl zveřejněn nový rekord výpočtu π, které bylo spočítáno na 100 biliónů cifer. Za výpočtem stojí  Emma Haruka Iwao z Google a k výpočtu byl použit Google Cloud se 128 virtuálními CPU a 864 GB RAM. Při výpočtu není až tak důležitá hrubá síla, jako spíše úložiště. K dispozici bylo 663 TB, z toho bylo použito 515 TB. Celkově bylo zapsáno 38,5 PB a přečteno 43,5 PB.</span>

                              <span>I rarely feel as conflicted about a game as I do about Honkai: Star Rail. It&#x27;s a turn-based RPG and I like those; but it&#x27;s a JRPG and I dislike those. It&#x27;s got a spacefaring train in it, which I always think is cute; but also it&#x27;s got anime waifus in it and those make me cringe. Its new trailer, which you&#x27;ll find below, is dynamic and exciting and well-edited; but... it&#x27;s got cringy anime waifus in it.

Watch it and make up your own mind.

This wasn&#x27;t part of anything, and was instead a random and unexpected announcement. Only kidding! It was one of many things shown at Summer Game Fest tonight.

Look past that comparison and I think there&#x27;s more to like about it on its own terms, however. Check out the new trailer below, which also delivers news of its release date and a playable demo.

                              <span>Day Of The Devs is probably my favourite part of the summer games jamboree every year because it does wonders for the visibility of indie games and their developers. Slotting in snugly right after Geoff regaled us with the Summer Game Fest stream, this year’s Day Of The Devs showcase marked the tenth anniversary. Tim Schafer and friends revealed more about some stonking looking indies from places as far apart as the Netherlands, Japan and Argentina. It was lovely to see some solo devs featured too, such as Madison Karrh with Birth, a point-and-click puzzler about loneliness, and Billy Basso’s beautiful pixel-art Metroidvania Animal Well.

Described as &quot;the ultimate body shop&quot;, Boss Factory is a free standalone demo you can access in The Epic Game Store (or by following a series of links through SaintsRow.com). In it you can have a ride on the character creator before the game comes out in August, and save your favourite and most bizarre looks. This was revealed with a trailer with all explosions and montages and that.

The good news is that our favoured platform will receive the same fancified version as is being developed for PlayStation 5; the bad news is that while the PlayStation 5 version has a September 2nd release date, there&#x27;s no confirmed date for the PC version yet.

                              <span>A new trailer for Warhammer 40,000: Darktide fresh out of the Summer Game Fest gives another look at the heretic-smashing cooperative shooter from the makers of Warhammer: Vermintide and yup, it looks like Vermintide in 40K. And that&#x27;s fine. I&#x27;m good with that. That&#x27;s great, really. Vermintide is fun but I&#x27;ve no affinity for Warhammer Fantasy so yes, give me bolters and Inquisitors and Ogryns and sci-fi Gothic cathedrals. See for yourself below.

I&#x27;m afraid I am now of the opinion that &quot;dark fantasy first-person shooter&quot; is one of the most underwhelming word combinations in the English language. But hey, it&#x27;s a video, the game could be bananas good when it comes out, and I&#x27;m duty bound to tell you all about it in case you get really excited for it - and if you do, then good news, &#x27;cos the video confirms it&#x27;s coming to early access on the Epic Games Store soon (aiming for Q4 2022).

                              <span>First came Golf Club Wasteland, a post-apocalyptic sports game from Demagog Studios where the world&#x27;s remaining elite jetted around golf courses on the ruined surface of Earth. Then, earlier this year, they announced The Cub, a side-scrolling platformer telling a parallel story of one of the poor souls left behind on our home planet while the rest of humanity buggered off to Mars. Now, Demagog seem to be expanding their Wasteland-verse with a third entry: Highwater. It&#x27;s not clear how this one relates to the others just yet, but it does feature a rather lovely yellow lifeboat in a flooded cityscape. Check out the reveal trailer below.

Now, the capacious 2TB SN570 is 10% off for Father&#x27;s Day in the US, where you can pick up the drive for $162 at the WD Store when you use code DADSDAY10.

The Seventies aesthetic and Milton Keynes-esque, city-of-the-future feel shown in previous looks at the game are still very much in evidence – those massive swan statues are boss, and nobody hates monorails, right? Take a Logan’s Run at it yourself by watching the new trailer.

The announcement trailer doesn&#x27;t show anything in-game, but suggests it&#x27;ll still be about causing havoc as a goat, only now with co-op and Epic Games Store exclusivity.

Bloober say it&#x27;s the &quot;psychedelic experience fans know and love&quot; and has &quot;an expanded plotline&quot;, so this doesn&#x27;t sound like an entirely new game. The freshly revealed Layers Of Fears is being built in Unreal Engine 5. As such, the trailer makes for pleasantly unpleasant viewing.

                              <span>In a very short and technically not at all sweet teaser trailer at the Summer Game Fest this year, we saw that terrible things are afoot in isolated space station Fort Solis. Honestly, why does anyone bother building isolated space stations? It&#x27;s like getting married at Christmas in Albert Square at this point. Geoff was joined on stage by Roger Clark (who you will know from being Arthur Morgan in Red Dead Redemption) and Troy Baker (who you will know from, I dunno, throw a dart, you&#x27;ll hit one) to briefly talk more about their characters and what the hap is heckening in this horror adventure game.

                              <span>Humankind is adding six new cultures to its historical strategy roster with the arrival of its second paid DLC pack, Amplitude Studios have announced at tonight&#x27;s Summer Game Fest. It&#x27;s also getting another major patch in the form of the &quot;Bolivar Patch&quot;, that&#x27;s focused on community features. But first, the DLC. This will explore the heritage of Latin America, letting players progress from the ancient era Caralans through to the Nazca, Taíno, Inca and contemporary Argentinians and Cubans. You needn&#x27;t wait to dig in, either, as the Latin America pack is out right now on Steam and the Epic Games Store.

                              <span>Crikey, one thing I never expected to see at tonight’s Summer Game Fest was a sequel to Delphine Software and U.S. Gold’s cinematic sci-fi platformer Flashback, but there it was. Flashback 2 is coming from long-established French studio Microids, developers of the Syberia series. It’s been 30 years now since the original game released on PC, and Geoff Keighley was very excited to re-announce the sequel. Check out the trailer below.

                              <span>Chance has always been an integral part of Firaxis’ turn-based tactics games. Just ask the many thousands of players who missed a shot with a 90% success chance in one of their XCOM reboots. Marvel’s Midnight Suns, however, could be the Civilization studio’s biggest gamble yet. Not only is it their first game to mix substantial RPG elements into its tactical combat, but there’s nary a hit percentage in sight. In the four hours I spent playing the opening of Midnight Suns last week, I saw precisely one scenario that had any kind of per cent number attached to it – and that was booting a goon (100%) or Venom, one of the newly confirmed villains of the game (0%), off a rooftop. All your other attacks, represented here as a deck of cards, are guaranteed hits.
It’s a strategic evolution I’ll talk about in a second, but this switch-up in approach isn’t the only part of Midnight Suns story that’s been subject to the whims of (mis)fortune. No sooner had Firaxis announced the game it was delayed in the snap of Thanos&#x27; fingers (from March to the second half of 2022, now confirmed as October 7th at tonight’s Summer Game Fest). But speaking to creative director Jake Solomon, the extra polishing time they set aside gave them an unexpected benefit. And it’s all down to a fish witch called Wanda.

Spider-Man and Scarlet Witch will be joining previously announced goodies such as Iron Man, Blade and Captain Marvel, while err... Scarlet Witch, Hulk and Venom will repping the game&#x27;s big bad demon mother Lilith. Man, if there&#x27;s one Avenger I wouldn&#x27;t want going all evil on me, it&#x27;s Hulk. And Scarlet Witch, to be fair. Why have these heroes joined the dark side in Firaxis&#x27; new tactics RPG? Well, we&#x27;ll be able to find out when the game launches on October 7th. Here&#x27;s a new trailer to celebrate.

Taken from a very watery mission during the campaign, the trailer showed Task Force 141&#x27;s Captain Price, Gaz, Soap et al skulking through an oil rig before raiding a fleeing boat during a storm. I guess there was a reason why Activision Blizzard unveiled the game on a boat deck after all... Get a load of all its fancy new water tech below.

                              <span>Summer Game Fest has just kicked off and so has a new combatant for Capcom’s upcoming Street Fighter 6. Yep, the U.S. Air Force’s finest, Guile, is back. Like some other famous Street Fighters from back in the day, he’s only gone and grown some facial fluff too. Does it deflect blows or something? Judge for yourself after watching the trailer.

                              <span>The Summer Game Fest has brought the announcement of a new game based on Aliens, this time taking HR Giger&#x27;s glistening penetrators and James Cameron&#x27;s gung-ho space marines into real-time squad action. Due to launch next year, Aliens: Dark Descent will see marines battling xenomorphs as well as those Weyland-Yutani scamps. Sounds like it might be interesting, with persistent upgrades and deaths across a campaign. Check out the announcement trailer below.

                              <span>Seven years ago, I had high praise for Space Beast Terror Fright, a tense and often intense roguelikelike FPS about exploring alien-infested spaceships. It was murderously punishing, with limited ammo and endless aliens making it important to seal up routes and activate sentry turrets. It was great! Well, SBTF finally left early access and launched in full over the weekend, so I returned today and oh no. I have grown so very old since 2015, and this game is now too much for me. Oh no.

Except, it&#x27;s not unrelated at all. It&#x27;s the game that Ostriv developer Yevheniy made while suffering through the invasion of Ukraine, &quot;to switch my mind from death and destruction towards peace and creativity&quot;. I&#x27;d be recommending it for sure even if I hadn&#x27;t found that out, because it&#x27;s a terrific little game that&#x27;s far more engaging than it looks.

What game d&#x27;you think would be the best Lego set? Action figures? Obscure 80s and 90s toy? Oh, we have fun on this show.
Diversions this week are predictably about toys we had as kid, including a very long sidebar about Mighty Max, and Matthew&#x27;s reverse-engineered Boglin hatred derived from his sad childhood. We also have some obligatory Platty Joobs round-up chat, and there&#x27;s an unintentionally difficult Cavern Of Lies this week, themed around Funko Pop, because any made up Funko Pop is indistinguishable from a real Funko Pop.

It’s a procedurally-generated romp through various mission types such as asteroid mining, battling space pirates and rescuing ships in distress, all spread throughout the galaxy. Introversion have quite a bit more to say on what they call their “broken, unfinished and bug filled prototype“ in their announcement video, which you can watch below.

I already enjoyed the demo, and now it&#x27;s bigger, fancier, and full of even more ridiculous combos. Today I had a run so overpowered I was afraid to even shoot, and fled explosions I hadn&#x27;t even intended to cause until I finally exploded myself. That&#x27;s the good stuff. And it&#x27;s only £2.

                              <span>Inside ActivisionBlizzard there are two wolves. Possibly dire wolves, or some other species of fantastical monster with surplus vowels in the name. Dreade Froste Beaste Wolfe. Anyway, one of them is made of decent people, developers who are fighting for better working conditions and making the best games they can under the circumstances. The other is Blizzard the organisation, a management structure seemingly incapable of making anything other than the worst decision possible in any given situation. So really, it&#x27;s actually more like one wolf, and one flapping headless chicken (the chicken having also received a lot of allegations of harrassment and discrimination, and a lawsuit from the state of California). 
Diablo Immortal, which is currently on open beta for PC and out properly for mobile (both for free), was largely made by the wolf, and it&#x27;s all right to play! However, I don&#x27;t know why the chicken wanted to put it on PC in its current monetised form, apart from the fact it&#x27;s a bad decision and we&#x27;ve already established those are the only kind of decisions the chicken can make.

It&#x27;s being developed by Stunlock Studios, the folks behind arena-brawler Battlerite that lifts the fights from MOBAs like Dota 2 or League Of Legends and cuts away all the tedious build-up. So quite the departure then? Yes and no. V Rising strikes out as its own thing, but Stunlock&#x27;s back catalogue definitely bleeds into its combat and exploration and easygoing attitude.

The lack of affordable content is most often cited as motivation. Interestingly, piracy rates among university-educated respondents are almost double that of those who enjoyed little to no schooling.

While Python 3.11 performance is looking great and huge advantages compared to prior versions, there are also alternative Python implementations like PyPy and Pyston. Stemming from Phoronix reader requests, here are benchmarks showing how Python 3.11 beta performance compares to those alternative Python implementations.</span>

                              <span>Diablo Immortal is being pilloried by players for the price of its microtransactions, and for how closely tied your progress is to spending real money. One player on the game&#x27;s Reddit page has suggested that it would cost between $50k-$80k (around £39k-£64k) to fully max out a character in the free-to-play action RPG. Meanwhile, the game&#x27;s director has been responding to feedback on Twitter in an attempt to address those &quot;not liking a game based on misinformation surrounding it.&quot;

                              <span>One of my favourite gaming keyboards is discounted at Amazon UK today. The Logitech G915 Lightspeed TKL is an ultra-slim, low profile mechanical keyboard that feels like the best laptop keyboard you&#x27;ve ever used. Lightspeed means Logitech&#x27;s reliable 2.4GHz wireless, while &#x27;TKL&#x27; stands for tenkeyless, a compact design that ditches the numpad for superior ergonomics and longer battery life. 
Altogether, it&#x27;s a beautifully-designed mechanical keyboard, with a high price point being the only strike against it - and despite that, the full-size G915 has been our &#x27;best wireless keyboard&#x27; recommendation for three years running. Today though, the G915 Lightspeed TKL is down to £109 after a £90 discount, making it an excellent time to upgrade your setup with a swanky new keyboard.

It debuted at £110 but now costs £57, nearly half-off its UK RRP. This headset distinguishes itself with a comfortable design, good neutral sound and a choice of leatherette or velour ear pads - with the latter being a godsend for spectacle-wearers like myself.

                              <span>Owning Halo Infinite is like having a subscription to a magazine where each issue has part of a model stuck to the front. The first issue brought the game&#x27;s multiplayer modes, the second issue brought its singleplayer campaign, the third issue finally fixed its Big Team Battle mode, and the fourth issue - by which time you&#x27;ve possibly lost interest - will bring online co-op for its campaign.

If you&#x27;re one of those still reading this metaphorical magazine, you can get beta access to the co-op mode this July if you sign up to Halo Insider.

                              <span>The US Copyright Office&#x27;s inquiry on the option to add mandatory copyright protection measures in the DMCA has led to some interesting responses. They include a suggestion to add &quot;VPN detection&quot; tools to prevent people from engaging in &quot;geo-piracy&quot;. This request, unsurprisingly, comes from a company that offers a VPN detection service.

The first of its kind in Canada, the flexible injunction was obtained by companies including Rogers, Bell, The Sports Network, and Groupe TVA. Unusually, it will be independently audited to assess over-blocking and any user circumvention via VPNs.

                              <span>A few months have passed since we released ScummVM 2.5.1.
No matter if you expect the scorching heat of the upcoming summer or freezing blizzards in winter (depending on your favorite hemisphere): it’s release time again!
Our lovely developers added support, yet again, for a bunch of new ancient games that require testing:
Sanitarium
Hades Challenge
Marvel Comics Spider-Man: The Sinister Six
The 11th Hour
Clandestiny
Tender Loving Care (CD-ROM Editions)
Uncle Henry&#x27;s Playhouse
Wetlands
Chewy: Esc from F5
Besides these games, we’d appreciate it if you could check our release testing list - maybe you’ll even find your favorite game on there that has been sitting on that shelf for way too long.
And since ScummVM is about playing games in general, we’ve seen quite a bunch of changes across many, many engines - so this is the perfect time for giving your favorites another go.
The AGOS, SCI and SCUMM engine received some really extensive modifications which make all games using those engines very good testing targets as well.
All testing must be done with stable builds, not development ones. Please report any bugs or oddities on our issue tracker.
A detailed list of all exciting new features and fixes is available in our NEWS file.
Thank you very much for your support!

                              <span>After an extended period of time, we&#x27;re finally ready to announce that the game Chewy: ESC From F5 is ready for testing. This quirky game features the protagonist Chewy as he tries to outwit the evil Borks. Escaping from their high security zone, F5, will just be the start of his adventure.
If any of you have the game and are willing to test it out, we&#x27;ll welcome any feedback. You will need a daily development build. As always, please submit the bug reports to our issue tracker. 
Please note that the ScummVM version does have one major outstanding issue: the music used by the game is in a custom format we&#x27;ve been unable to properly support yet. So only sound effects and speech currently work at this time.

                              <span>A few days ago, Google announced the list of students accepted for this year&#x27;s Google Summer of Code.
We are very proud to welcome 4 students this year who will be working on various parts of the project during the upcoming months.
Pragyansh Chaturvedi (aka Raikou) will work on improving our DIRECTOR engine. His effort will help us to allow support for many 90s-era adventure games made with the Macromedia Director authoring tools. By implementing more internal functions used by DIRECTOR, Pragyansh&#x27;s main objective is to extend support for Meet Mediaband and The Journeyman Project (Win and Mac), making them fully playable without any glitches.
Michael Hayman (aka Quote58) is about to implement support for The Immortal. The game (released in 1990) can be described as a mix of genres involving RPG elements with action and puzzles. Many changes across different game variants (written in pure assembly code!) will make this an interesting challenge. This project is a continuation of a GSoC task initially started by a former student back in 2018.
Emanuele Grisenti (aka grisenti) will be working on a new engine, HPL1. The original sources for this engine got recently released by the original developer Frictional Games under GPLv3. The purpose of this project is to achieve a full port of this engine to ScummVM, with the goal of supporting the 2007 survival game Penumbra: Overture.
Avijeet Maurya (aka StableSteady) will pick up several incomplete engines: MacVenture, Avalanche, Glk-Scott, Pink and WAGE. Some of these engines are very close to completion, but not quite there yet. The main objective of Avijeet&#x27;s task is to identify all missing features and fix existing bugs. The goal for his project is to bring the above engines to a stable state.
The team is very excited about the upcoming weeks – and we hope you are as well.
Please give a warm welcome to our new students! Let&#x27;s make GSoC 2022 a huge success – together!
