                    <span>Server ServeTheHome píše, že funkce AMD PSB, která dosud byla známa u serverových procesorů EPYC, je přítomná také v desktopových procesorech Ryzen (minimálně ve verzi „PRO“, např. 5650G). AMD PSB umožňuje uzamknout procesor pro desky specifického výrobce tím, že při prvním bootu v desce s podporou PBS je v OTP paměti procesoru vypálen klíč daného výrobce. Procesor poté nelze použít v deskách jiného výrobce.</span>

                    <span>Vánoční svátky jsou za námi a mnoho z Vás jistě dostalo elektrotechnické dárky, kterými se chcete před ostatními pochlubit. A nebo jste za Vánoce stihli něco sami vytvořit - nám se povedlo ubastlit třeba váhu na RC modely. Ať už tak nebo tak, o všem si můžete popovídat na Virtuální Bastlírně - online setkání elektroniků a bastlířů! Příští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat ve středu 5. ledna od 20:00 minimálně do 22:00. Ať už něco chcete ukázat nebo máte jenom téma k diskuzi, vyplňte prosím dotazník. Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.</span>

                    <span>Admittedly, it&#x27;d take very little for me to be on board with a Death Stranding Director&#x27;s Cut. It only needed to be more Death Stranding for me to be sold on revisiting Hideo Kojima&#x27;s latest vanity project. Luckily for me, that&#x27;s exactly what the Director&#x27;s Cut is. I love the original release, and this is a perfect excuse to dive back in. I think you should play it, too. But maybe not for the reasons you think. 
Death Stranding Director&#x27;s Cut is pitched as an expanded version of the base game that came out in 2019, the definitive version of Kojima&#x27;s vision. After 26 hours – and much, much more still to go – my knee-jerk impression is that the Director&#x27;s Cut moniker is marketing spiel more than anything. Still, there are some fun and creative new additions that enhance the overall experienc…</span>

At the end of Persona 5, we parted ways with a terrific cast of characters we grew to love over the course of a 100-hour story. Last year’s Persona 5 Royal gave us an excuse to revisit that same adventure with additional content, but fans yearned for an all-new journey. Persona 5 Strikers reunites the cast from the original game six months later for an all-new trip across Japan. Even though it drastically changes a few key elements of the experience, it still feels like a true, compelling continuation of the game that stole RPG fans’ hearts nearly four years ago.

Thanks to EA Play’s inclusion, the biggest name in the batch is not one but three titles in Mass Effect Legendary Edition. It’s joined by the acclaimed Outer Wilds, a hidden gem in Olija, the early access debut of co-op shooter The Anacrusis, and more.

                    <span>Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker was released just last month and while players are still working their way through the MMO’s latest expansion, which was unfortunately hampered by numerous server congestion issues at launch, the big new 6.05 patch is now live. 
As Final Fantasy XIV players know, a patch like 6.05 isn’t just any patch – it&#x27;s packed with new things for players to do and obtain. A quick scroll through the expansive list of patch notes reveals that to be true, too, as the new update features all kinds of additions like a new version of a raid, a treasure dungeon, new minions and mounts, and of course, some fixes and improvements as well.

                    <span>If you really enjoy anime and games based on popular anime titles, then there’s a good chance you’re already a fan of CyberConnect 2. That’s because that’s the developer behind games like Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba, Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4, and Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot. 
During a recent “Piro-Live! New Year’s Eve Special 2022” livestream, as reported by Gematsu, CyberConnect2 president and CEO Hiroshi Matsuyama said that all three of those games have sold really well, revealing the worldwide sales numbers for each (which frankly, speak for themselves):

Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4, first released in 2016, has sold more than 8.7 million units worldwide 
Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot, first released in January of 2020, has sold more than 4.5 million units worldwide 
Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – The Hinokami Chronicles, its most recent title released back in October, has sold more than 1.32 million units worldwide. 
Building off of that momentum, CyberConnect2 is ready to reveal its next game next month. According to Gematsu, Matsuyama said during the livestream that the team will announce a new game in February, with a planned release for it in the Summer. The CEO also said that the new title will definitely get people talking, and that it’s a game that “promises to be something that will shake the world,” Gematsu writes. 
Perhaps it’s a new game based on a very popular anime, or maybe the studio is returning to the .hack series it was first made famous for. Speaking of the .hack series, Matsuyama said the company is preparing for the 20th anniversary of it in June.

                    <span>Setting its stall early.
Even in more &#x27;normal&#x27; times Nintendo would often head into a new year with a lot of its big hits still under wraps. A 3-6 month turnaround from announcement to release isn&#x27;t uncommon from the company even for its most important games, and it still follows this template for some titles - Metroid Dread being a good example in 2021. This year, however, the list of expected releases is already eye-opening, and that&#x27;s before the inevitable Nintendo Directs and expo appearances (whether virtual or in-person reveals). It could be quite a special year.
We headed into last year, in particular, with little idea of what Nintendo would produce. There&#x27;s an extremely obvious reason for this, with a lot of development projects slowing down and requiring drastic shifts to work-from-home structures since 2020. 2021 was a bit of an improvisational year, in some respects, too, with major releases joined by quirky but fun smaller games and a handful of ports / remasters. Nintendo was just about able to fill its typical annual quota of first-party titles, while no doubt internally revising, rescheduling and pushing back some games that - in an alternative reality - would have already arrived.

While some of us were busy binging Muppets Christmas Carol and eating an ungodly amount of mince pies and cheese, some celebrities were out there doing random acts of kindness — or &quot;random acts of Shaqness&quot;, as this one is apparently called.
Basketball star Shaquille O&#x27;Neal, also known as simply &quot;Shaq&quot;, or more festively, &quot;Shaq-A-Claus&quot;, recently acquired 1,000 Nintendo Switches from his &quot;friend from Nintendo&quot;, as well as 1,000 PS5s (presumably not from the same friend). He spoke to Gary Vaynerchuck on The Gary Vee Audio Experience podcast about his Santa-like activities, which he does every year:

                    <span>The man behind the music for Castlevania, Contra, Parodius and more.
They say that you create some of your best work when you&#x27;re put in a difficult situation, and for the many composers who had to make the Game Boy&#x27;s crude audio hardware sing, that does seem to have been the case. Despite its humble nature, the console is home to some truly memorable soundtracks – and one person who arguably mastered it better than most was Konami&#x27;s Hidehiro Funauchi (also credited as &#x27;FK‑King&#x27;).
There&#x27;s very little information online about Funauchi, and much of what you&#x27;re about to read here is informed by an excellent piece on the composer by Micro-Chop&#x27;s Gino Sorcinelli. It seems that he joined Konami in the late &#x27;80s, earning his first composter credit came in 1989 on the Family Computer title TwinBee 3: Poko Poko Daimaō alongside Atsushi Fujio (&#x27;Sukenomiya&#x27;) and Katsuhiko Suzuki (&#x27;Flamingo&#x27;). This would turn out to be his only non-Game Boy composer credit, and for the next few years, he plied his trade fastidiously on Nintendo&#x27;s monochrome handheld, turning out some of the best soundtracks to ever grace the console.

                    <span>&quot;We finally found a concept that made sense on Switch&quot;.
It may have taken more than 20 years, but Pokémon fans were finally treated to a new Pokémon Snap game last year, aptly called, well... New Pokémon Snap. Those who checked it out for themselves will already know that the game follows in the footsteps of the N64 original, expanding upon the ideas found in the series&#x27; first title with bigger areas to explore, new tricks to try, and more.
Following the N64 original&#x27;s release, we&#x27;ve often felt that new Nintendo hardware could have been perfect for a new title – the 3DS and its actual cameras? The Wii U with its GamePad and TV setup? – but it was the Switch that ended up getting the nod. In an interview with Famitsu, The Pokémon Company president Tsunekazu Ishihara reveals that discussions did indeed take place with the release of &quot;every new generation of consoles&quot;. Thanks to Nintendo Everything for the translations:

                    <span>Game over, man, game over!
Sequels are supposed to be better than their predecessors. Although such a statement doesn’t always ring true (plenty will have a lot to say about which of the Metroid Prime games is their favourite) the intention behind a sequel is to learn from and improve upon previous works - that’s the theory, at least. When Hollow released on the Nintendo Switch in 2018 we didn’t like it all that much, calling it an “ugly game” that was “difficult to play”. Surely, then, its sequel will turn out to be a better experience..? Well, it’s different.
Although visually similar to the first game, Hollow 2 takes the same general setup and gameplay but dials the action right up to 11. It feels like a completely different game as a result; gone are the slow, explorative sections of the first title, replaced instead with almost constant horde-like showdowns with the various enemies, all of which come thick and fast right from the start. Like we said, it’s a different experience, but one that’s still plagued with the same agonising issues, making Hollow 2 an absolute chore to play.

                    <span>Recreating BotW&#x27;s grass was no easy task.
When you think of Hyrule Warriors and the challenges its development team likely comes up against, you&#x27;ll probably find yourself thinking about the hundreds of enemies on-screen or keeping on top of the faithful Zelda lore present throughout. What we dare say you wouldn&#x27;t think of, is its... grass?
Yes, as it happens, the game&#x27;s grass turned out to be one of the trickier puzzles faced by the team behind Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity. In an interview featured within Japanese magazine Nintendo Dream, development producer Masaki Furusawa, director Ryouta Matsushita, producer Yousuke Hayashi, and art director Yuu Oohashi spoke about the troubles it caused when trying to recreate Zelda: Breath of the Wild&#x27;s Hyrule Field.

                    <span>Get into the swing of it.
Mario Golf: Super Rush has expanded and improved a fair amount since its launch, now representing a rather decent final product. Part of this renewed appeal is the online ranked play, which is still undeniably simplistic but does offer snappy fun and some rewards. Last month the big prize was Mario&#x27;s normal clothing, which was both cool and underwhelming at once, but this month&#x27;s reward is certainly worth a little time on the course.
The January prize is Mario&#x27;s outfit from NES Open Tournament Golf, a rather iconic piece of attire that is often brought back to light in modern titles - in this generation it&#x27;s been a costume in Super Mario Odyssey and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. Its origins make it the perfect unlock, and some eager players have got it wrapped up already.

If you like first-person horror games then the Switch sure has a lot of them; some are even pretty darn good. Another has been announced that&#x27;ll hope to make its mark on the eShop - Syndrome, developed by Camel 101 and being brought to Switch by RedDeerGames, will be making its console debut on Switch later this year.
It&#x27;s a game that came out on Steam way back in 2016, albeit to mixed user reviews. Based on footage and indeed reviews of the PC version it certainly brings to mind something like Alien: Isolation, though of course this is an effort from a much smaller development team. You wake up from cryosleep on a space station and have to sneak around hiding from various things trying to kill you - a classic setup, no doubt.

                    <span>&quot;These voices are just alive in me...&quot;.
With hundreds of games under his belt, more awards than we could ever hope to count, and the impressive job of being Nintendo&#x27;s main mascot, Super Mario has been a household name for decades. Undoubtedly one of entertainment&#x27;s biggest stars, Mario has been delighting fans young and old ever since the original Super Mario Bros. hit the scene, so it&#x27;s only fitting that the voice actor who brings him to life is full to the brim with love and passion for the role.
As it so often does in any of his interviews, that passion has once again shone through in Charles Martinet&#x27;s latest discussion with Retro Gamer. In the chat, originally published in Retro Gamer magazine&#x27;s 222nd issue, the actor talks about how he landed the legendary role, his work on Netflix documentary High Score, and plenty more besides. His response to a question about his preparation for a day in the studio struck us the most, however:

UK physical chart data is now in for the week ending 1st January, revealing that Mario Kart 8 Deluxe has managed to take the first pole position of 2022.
The game is joined by four other Nintendo Switch exclusives in the top ten, with Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Mario Party Superstars managing to climb back into the pecking order after some time away. Animal Crossing: New Horizons is Switch&#x27;s next best performing exclusive, landing in third spot just behind FIFA 22.

                    <span>The fastest selling system in the country.
The Switch has been a notable global success since March 2017, and since December 2019 its hardware sales have also included official results from China. The size of the Chinese market makes it a valuable target for the &#x27;big three&#x27; console manufacturers, but the country&#x27;s stringent production regulations and approval processes for games have made the &#x27;grey market&#x27; of imports the point of access for most.
Officially launching the original Switch model in late 2019 - in partnership with Tencent - was a notable move for Nintendo, its first official hardware release in the country for well over a decade at that time. While Sony and Microsoft got there first, Nintendo&#x27;s family friendly library and Tencent partnership have ensured positive results. While the systems are region free and as a result import purchases continue, officially localised games and access to online services are selling points for the licensed iteration. It&#x27;s worth noting that these sales in China are contributing notably to the system&#x27;s ongoing success - a little under 10 million standard Switch models have been sold in &#x27;other&#x27; territories, which will include countries like Australia, South Korea and of course China.

                    <span>The vanguard of Intel’s 12th Gen Alder Lake CPUs had some seriously good chips in it – including two of the best CPUs for gaming overall – though there weren’t many models for aspiring PC builders on tight budgets. Now, though, Intel has used CES 2022 to launch the rest of the 12th Gen desktop lineup, adding loads of more affordable Core i5 and Core i3 processors on top of new Core i7 and Core i9 options. Intel also unveiled its new H-series, 12th Gen gaming laptop chips, which use the same hybrid architecture (combining powerful P-cores with smaller, less energy-intensive E-cores) as their Alder Lake desktop cousins.

The high: the GeForce RTX 3090 Ti, as new top-of-the-line CPU with 24GB of upgraded, 21Gbit/s GDDR6X VRAM. The low: the GeForce RTX 3050, Nvidia’s first XX50 GPU in a donkey’s age.

                    <span>It’s the first week of 2022 and that means – yes! – all the big PC hardware movers and shakers are hosting their CES 2022 events. On the same day. Within a couple of hours of each other. But my stress is your gain, as there are and will be some major announcements on new kit, starting with AMD. Their freshly-announced hardware includes an assortment of new CPUs, desktop and mobile graphics cards and even some laptop APUs – APUs that sound a lot more useful for gaming that what current integrated graphics can offer. There’s even an Nvidia Image Scaling rival in the upcoming, driver-level Radeon Super Resolution feature.

                    <span>Nightingale certainly isn&#x27;t the sort of game I was expecting from a former BioWare developer, but I&#x27;m well excited to give it a go. Announced at The Game Awards 2021, Nightingale is a survival craft &#x27;em up set in a fantastical, alt-history world. It&#x27;s being made by Inflexion Games, a studio lead by Aaryn Flynn, former programmer and general manager at the Dragon Age and Mass Effect developers. 
But don&#x27;t go in expecting the sort of huge, arcing plotlines of BioWare&#x27;s recent games. While Nightingale will have an over-arching narrative, it&#x27;s being designed to offer up adventures that let you make your own stories. I spoke to Flynn at the end of last year to find out a little bit more about what that entails.

Money will go to current and former female employees and contract workers. The suit started in 2018 following widespread allegations of a festering workplace culture, and was originally due to be settled for $10 million (£7m) until California state authorities raised objections that it wasn&#x27;t enough.

                    <span>There’s always a city. There’s always a lighthouse. There’s always a man. There’s also always an opportunity for a company to create a new game in a franchise to make some money, and while I recognize that’s exactly why a fourth BioShock game is in development, it’s hard to stop myself from growing more and more excited about what it might be. 
BioShock Infinite, the last in the series, was released in 2013, and at the earliest, the next one, now in development at 2K’s new Cloud Chamber studio, hits next year. That’s a massive nine-year gap, which has hopefully given those at Cloud Chamber enough time to stir on what a new BioShock game needs and doesn’t need – it has for me, at least.

                    <span>Update, 12/31/21:
PlayStation announced earlier this week that Deep Rock Galactic, as well as Persona 5 Strikers and Dirt 5, will be the January 2022 PlayStation Plus titles, and now, new details about one of the games have been released. 
As first reported by VG247, Deep Rock Galactic will contain some PlayStation 5-exclusive features thanks to the console&#x27;s DualSense controller. More specifically, the DualSense touchpad can be used to control the Terrain Scanner in-game. Plus, the controller&#x27;s built-in speaker can be used by characters to tell you orders as if said characters are actually using a radio to communicate with you, as one might do when mining deep into an alien planet&#x27;s terrain. 
For more about the game, check out Game Informer&#x27;s Deep Rock Galactic review.

                    <span>Ken Levine, the creator of the famed BioShock series, put out his last game, BioShock Infinite, in 2013. Shortly after, he closed the doors of Irrational Games, a studio he started in 1997. Most of the staff was let go, on short notice no less, but a handful of developers were hand-picked to join his new smaller studio startup, Ghost Story Games. 
That new studio, still under the helm of 2K and parent company Take-Two Interactive, began work on a new game – it’s that narrative Legos one Levine talked about years and years ago – in 2014. Now, eight years later, not a trace of that game has been seen by the public and a new report from Bloomberg reveals why. 
Sadly, what’s revealed in the report is not at all uncommon in video game development: poor leadership, employee burnout and frustrati…</span>

                    <span>It’s no surprise that Spider-Man No Way Home – the third film in Sony’s Tom Holland-led franchise – has reached impressive critical and financial heights. Fans have been waiting for a live-action Multiverse movie since Into the Spiderverse, and No Way Home continues to serve as the perfect answer to that enthusiasm. The movie garnered positive feedback from viewers and handily surpassed the box office numbers of every 2021 film. As of right now, No Way Home is Sony’s most successful movie of all time. And, according to Hollywood Reporter, it’s the first pandemic-era film to amass more than $1 billion at the box office. 
Deadline reported in December 2021 that No Way Home could ultimately come away with a $610 million net profit, which would boast higher numbers than Homecoming and Far From Home. This estimate might not be far-fetched because, on Christmas Eve, the latest web-slinger movie became Sony’s top-grossing domestic title ever. And as long as theaters stay open (who knows what the future may hold now that the omicron strain is spreading like wildfire), No Way Home will undoubtedly continue its staggering financial success this year. 
In his most daring adventure yet, Peter Parker and Doctor Strange accidentally tear open Multiverse doorways, bringing franchise-favorite villains like Doctor Octopus, Green Goblin, and Electro into the fray. This might be the most ambitious Spider-Man movie, but it won’t be the last time we see Tom Holland in the skin-tight suit, as the British star may appear in three more films. 
In Spider-Man games news, No Way Home-inspired skins are available in Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered, while Spider-Man and MJ cosmetics have launched in Fortnite. And if you want more MCU info, check out the new trailer for Doctor Strange’s In The Multiverse of Madness movie.

In an incredible Neon Genesis Evangelion preview gag, Linde revealed he will be joining Riot Games R&amp;D. Mystery solved!
NEXT TIME ON AARON LINDE pic.twitter.com/wuxKRX2ZZ7

Original Story 1/3/21: Just a little under a month since the full release of Halo Infinite, its lead narrative designer, Aaron Linde, has revealed that he’s leaving 343 Industries. 
Don’t worry, though, as it’s not a breakup – Linde is departing 343 to “pursue a new opportunity in 2022.”
As a narrative designer, Linde’s hands are all over the story within Halo Infinite but it’s not just limited to cutscenes, main story m…</span>

                    <span>Hideo Kojima ended up tweeting his 2022 plans a week after the release of the Famitsu&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s ambitions feature, only this time he&#x27;s clarified some of what he may be working on. Kojima Tweeted this on January 1, saying, &quot;This year, I&#x27;m going to start a new work in earnest, and move to the next level of experimentation with a radical project. I&#x27;m also hoping to get the video team going. And I may start doing something like a radio project?&quot;
So, Hideo looks to be working on four main projects in different levels of development and progress. Two of which appear to be games or at least games-related in the &quot;new work&quot; he&#x27;s beginning, and the &quot;radical project&quot; that&#x27;s evolving more this year.

                    <span>Japanese publication Famitsu released its annual list of New Year’s cards from a range of the nation&#x27;s developers/publishers. It allows companies the chance to thank fans for their support over the last year, tease upcoming projects, and share success stories of recently released titles. In Atlus’ case, its message reveals that the recently released Shin Megami Tensei V has performed very well during its short lifespan while planting seeds for its next title.
So far, over 800,000 copies of Shin Megami Tensei V have been sold. Atlus states this is a cumulative sales number, implying digital sales are accounted for. This makes SMT V the best-selling entry in the long-running series despite only launching less than two months ago, shattering Shin Megami Tensei IV’s lifetime sales of 600,000+. 
The publisher has an eventful 2022 ahead, namely, celebrating Persona’s 25th anniversary. We already know that Persona 4 Arena Ultimax comes to modern platforms in March, but Atlus teases other surprises are in store. Lastly, Atlus states it has an unannounced project is in the works. 
Couple this news with the upcoming Switch port of the well-received 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim, and Atlus is sitting pretty heading into the new year. Shin Megami Tensei V&#x27;s success is great to hear, though not entirely surprising. After all, it was one of our runner-ups for The Best RPG of 2021, which you can read all about here.

                    <span>Elden Ring is right around the corner, due out on February 25, and if Game Informer editor Dan Tack’s latest preview with the From Software title is any indication, we’re in for a treat. 
Last month, famed author George R.R. Martin, who collaborated with From Software to create the foundation and lore of Elden Ring, wrote that the game looks “incredible” in a blog post. Thanks to a new Edge Magazine interview with Elden Ring director Hidetaka Miyazaki, it seems the recent Bluepoint Games remake of Demon’s Souls on PlayStation 5 helped make From’s latest look great.

                    <span>Capcom has returned the Resident Evil franchise to its horrifying roots in recent years (namely, Resident Evil 7 and Village), pitting players against grotesque creatures with the added heart-bursting benefits of a first-person perspective. The RE 2 and 3 Remakes are third-person experiences, but the high-quality graphics, tight action controls, and unkillable Mr. X and Nemesis create that same sense of dread that the latest entries are known for. The Remakes beg to be played in VR, and one great modder did just that. 
According to Kotaku, praydog has been developing VR ports for both Remakes for quite some time. Modder praydog’s attention to detail is particularly striking as the full-motion controls make the games’ conventional weapons feel physical. Swinging the knife as rotting zombies…</span>

Game Informer even spoke to Takashi Iizuka, the head of Sonic Team and longtime series designer, director, and producer, about the anniversary. Now, thanks to a new Q&amp;A segment during an investor call, we know the team initially had even more planned for the 30th anniversary. 
First reported by Sonic Stadium, Sonic Frontiers was planned as a 2021 release to coincide with the blue blur’s birthday celebration, but in the end, the team needed more time on the upcoming open-zone game.

The North American 20th anniversary of Nintendo&#x27;s cube-y console is upon us and we’ve come to realise that two entire decades is long enough for people to either forget the GameCube’s charming boxy shape or even grow to adulthood without ever handling Nintendo’s handled hardware. &quot;0 years is also plenty of time for anything less than the very best and brightest examples of the system’s library to quietly fade from memory.

                    <span>A look back over the career of the NES and SNES&#x27; lead architect.
Over the holidays we&#x27;re republishing some of our best features, interviews, opinion pieces and talking points from the previous 12 months from staff and contributors alike — articles that we feel represent our best of 2021. In them you&#x27;ll find our usual mix of thoughtfulness, frivolity, retro expertise, gaming nostalgia, and — of course — enthusiasm for all things Nintendo. Enjoy!

The sad news broke today that Masayuki Uemura, the lead architect on the NES and Super NES consoles, died on 6th December at the age of 78. Uemura was an instrumental figure in the formation of Nintendo as the video game company we know and love today — his hardware design credits date back to the 1970s, and he also has a fair list of software producer credits to his name. It&#x27;s no exaggeration to say that millions of players across the world have his engineering skill and expertise to thank for the systems we played in our youth and the great memories we formed with them.

SPOILER WARNING! In the following article Stuart discusses some rather whopping spoilers as he takes us on an emotional and tearful Kingdom Hearts journey. If you haven&#x27;t played the games and you&#x27;re sensitive to spoilers, we recommend coming back in a year or so once you&#x27;ve played the lot. Otherwise, be warned that certain unfortunate events are discussed in detail.

                    <span>Get in shape with these Switch games.
Cooped up at home and need something to keep you active? Looking to get in shape this year but find the lure of gaming too hard to resist? Worry not, because with Switch it&#x27;s easy to mix your favourite pastime with a little cardiovascular exercise to get your blood pumping. Below we&#x27;ve collected our picks of the best Switch games for fitness and exercise.
Of course, you&#x27;ll need to combine these games with a balanced diet and the sessions of more taxing exercise if you really want to feel great and benefit from a dynamite bod with a washboard stomach, rock-hard pecs, etc., but Switch has a whole host of games and software aimed at getting you off the couch. The console&#x27;s portability also means there&#x27;s no need to skip a session when you&#x27;re away from home, either. So, no excuses!

                    <span>&quot;The majority of players have voiced their reservations toward these new trends&quot;.
NFTs have been a hot topic during 2021, and the New Year&#x27;s letter from Square Enix president Yosuke Matsuda is only going to add to that noise.
Matsuda&#x27;s letter – which you can read here – touches upon a wide range of topics, including cloud gaming, AI and &quot;the metaverse&quot;, but he devotes a particularly large portion to NFTs and cryptocurrency, and how they can impact gaming.

                    <span>Next month marks two years since AMD introduced the Ryzen Threadripper 3990X 64-core / 128-thread processor. All of our testing of the 3990X on Linux over the past two years has been with the System76 Thelio Major, which continues holding up well with that US-assembled workstation with hand-crafted enclosure from Colorado. With System76 having recently released Pop!_OS 21.10 as the latest update to their Ubuntu Linux derived operating system and upcoming two year anniversary of the 3990X, it made for an interesting time to see how the performance of the Ryzen Threadripper 3990X and Radeon RX 5700 XT within that workstation has evolved.</span>

                    <span>The first rule of video game club (apart from not talking about video game club) usually involves saving the world somehow. We do our best to rescue others from harm, to avert world-ending disasters, and give everyone around us the happy ending they deserve. But if there&#x27;s one thing I&#x27;ve learned about myself in 2021, it&#x27;s that I&#x27;m a cruel, heartless robot who will happily toss others under the bus if they don&#x27;t provide any material benefit to me. Or at least I am when I&#x27;m playing Unsighted, the gorgeous and criminally underrated action RPG from Studio Pixel Punk that puts a ticking time-bomb inside each of its characters&#x27; metallic chests which, if left unchecked, will remove them from the game entirely, preventing you from gaining some potentially very handy upgrades to help you in your quest to fight back against your human oppressors. 
It&#x27;s an ingenious system, as you&#x27;re not only fighting against the hordes of enemies that appear onscreen, but your own ineptitude.

                    <span>Swiitch ports.
It&#x27;s now 15 years since Wii launched and the world was introduced to the inclusive delights of Wii Sports, waggle gaming, and Wii elbow. That little three-DVD-case-sized box of tricks delivered some real gems over its long life — many of which were tailor-made for the system&#x27;s innovative remote-style motion controller and nunchuk and wouldn&#x27;t work the same on any other platform.
Well, that&#x27;s not quite true, is it? The Joy-Con controllers that slide onto the side of your Nintendo Switch feature all the gyroscopic motion-sensing gubbins needed to control any Wii game in a most authentic manner. In fact, we&#x27;ve seen a whole bunch of previously Wii-exclusive games on Switch already, including all-time classics like Super Mario Galaxy, Xenoblade Chronicles, and World of Goo, the first two games in the No More Heroes series, the HD port of The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword, and the sublime Okami HD (okay, we&#x27;re cheating with that one as it debuted on PS2, but the Wii port was a fine one).

Since our new forms are still coming online from their time spent in the primordial flesh soup vat of the RPS Treehouse, we can&#x27;t post over Christmas, so we&#x27;ve prepared some Christmas Cracker jokes instead! You can help fund the research into longer-lasting clone bodies with the RPS supporter program.

Ti musejí řešit chybu v on-premise instalacích serveru Microsoft Exchange, konkrétněji v komponentě Anti-Malware scanneru. Chyba spočívá v chybném datovém typu pro ukládání data, kdy vývojáři zvolili pro ukládání 32bitový signed integer a hodnota 2201010001 způsobí přetečení a následné nedoručení zprávy. Řešením je vypnout skenování zpráv, dokud nebude k dispozici oprava.</span>

                    <span>Happy new year! Season 2 of Game Informer&#x27;s Video Gameography podcast examines one of the biggest shooter franchises in existence: Halo. This week, we unpack Bungie&#x27;s epic conclusion to Master Chief&#x27;s original trilogy of adventures: Halo 3.
Released with all the hype in the world on September 25, 2007, Halo 3 served as both the pinnacle of the series as well as its supposed swan song for Master Chief. Using the now iconic tagline &quot;finish the fight,&quot; Bungie created Halo 3 under the agreement that it would part ways with Microsoft after a new set of Halo games. The third game was the first of this batch, and its creation suffered from internal studio conflicts, including creative heads walking out mid-development. How did Bungie cope with matching Halo 2&#x27;s quality, migrating to a new platform in the Xbox 360, and delivering a conclusion that lived up to expectations? Tune in to find out. 
Join hosts Ben Reeves (@BenjaminReeves), Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), and Game Informer video editor Alex Stadnik (@Studnik76) as we unpack the history and impact of Master Chief&#x27;s grand sequel. And for more Halo, be sure to check out our definitive ranking of every Halo game.

                    <span>2021 was hot boy summer for detectives. Well, not summer. Hot boy autumn? Is that a thing? Anyway, I not only played Sherlock Holmes Chapter One, but also an incarnation of Hercule Poirot as a bright young thing in Agatha Christie - Hercule Poirot: The First Cases. And yes, that name is a bit of a nightmare, but the game itself is very sweet. There&#x27;s &#x27;orrible murder, conspiracy, blackmail, union busting, and a cast of Cluedo-esque characters trapped inside a snowy manor. And yes, I am reusing the shoddy Love Island promo photo composite I made for a header picture, because it deserves the mileage.

                    <span>From baking sourdough bread and working out, people have kept themselves busy in a variety of ways during the pandemic. Manga piracy, it seems, is also one of them. 
An organization called ABJ (Authorized Books of Japan) was created to raise awareness regarding manga piracy. According to Jiji Press, the group put…

                    <span>It’s time to put 2021 in the rearview mirror and look forward to the new year. For most of us, that means thinking about how to make 2022 an even better year than the last with some New Year’s resolutions. Every year when this time rolls around, I make big plans. And while I resolve to better myself and start up good habits with the best of intentions, I notice they start to break down as the months go on. So this year, I’m bringing in a little backup: video games.
It’s Time To Get Healthy
Like many people, my first resolution every year is to be a little healthier after the indulgent past few weeks. Despite video games being a mostly sedentary hobby, there are a handful of titles that can help keep this goal from fizzling out. First, I’m turning to Ring Fit Adventure. Sure, there are a to…</span>

                    <span>There are decent Halo Infinite players, really great players, ranked Onyx players, and then there’s Remy “Mint Blitz,” an Australian streamer who won more than 100 free-for-all matches in a row. 
First reported by Kotaku, Mint Blitz originally set out to win 50 consecutive free-for-all matches in the recently-released (and free-to-play) multiplayer portion of Halo Infinite. After winning 50 in a row, though, he upped the ante and sought to win 100 consecutive matches…and he did it. In fact, he continued on to win even more, finally breaking the streak around “105, 106 straight” wins.

                    <span>Xbox’s flagship title makes its triumphant return, touting a resounding, deeply personal narrative arc for the Master Chief alongside popular PvP modes that appeal to Spartan veterans and novices alike. Simply put, Infinite is the total package; a love letter to the original trilogy that helped define the shooter genre. Gone are the overly complicated plot points, invasive loot box rewards, and ability kit-focused metas. 343 Industries’ latest installment is a lesson on finding balance in simple storytelling and leveling the competitive playing field. It’s also a revolutionary step that’ll undoubtedly inform the next generation of Halo projects. Read more...</span>

                    <span>This year was a great one for Koei Tecmo, which was behind several releases by way of either development or publishing, but the studio is teeing up 2022 to be even better. 
First reported and translated by Twinfinite, Japanese website 4Gamer published an article about 2022 plans for local game developers, including Koei Tecmo. In it, Koei Tecmo’s entertainment division general manager, Yosuki Hayashi, says the studio will reveal several games that have been in the works for years in 2022, stating that these titles “will pave the way for the future of the company,” Twinfinite writes.

Hayashi says the “full power of the current Koei Tecmo” will be shown in 2022 and that the year will mark the release of several games developed by the studio. As for what, Team Ninja director Fumihiko Yasuda said fans can look forward to future titles such as an action game set in the Three Kingdom era and another game that he’s actually directing. 
Finally, Fatal Frame producer Yosuke Kikuchi said that in 2022, “his team will challenge the development of something that they have never done before,” according to Twinfinite’s translation and that while it will be a long time before it’s formally announced, the studio is excited to get started. 
Perhaps 2022 will bring a new Nioh game to consoles and PC, or maybe even a new Fatal Frame, especially since the last one was released in 2015. Check out our thoughts on it in Game Informer’s Fatal Frame: Maiden of Black Water review and then read Game Informer’s Nioh 2 review after that.

                    <span>As a fan of the film Battle Royale and The Hunger Games books (the movies are fine too), I’m surprised the battle royale genre hasn’t permanently sunk its teeth into me. Don’t get me wrong; I’ve enjoyed my time with Fortnite and Apex Legends, the two titles I’ve dabbled with the most. They’re well-crafted games. But each of them also occupies the same niche being shooters. I’m itching for more creative spins on the formula. 
The recently announced Rumbleverse, a pro wrestling flavored take on the genre, tickles my fancy as a long-time fan of sports entertainment. But I’m selfish, so give me more battle royales based on my specific interests. If you’ve listened to me on podcasts or watched me on streams, you probably know I’m a big Yu-Gi-Oh fan as well.

                    <span>Remakes and remasters continue to become more common with each passing year and as Mortal Kombat has reached 11 mainline entries, some fans are looking back at the series’ history, especially as its 30th anniversary nears. 
If it was up to Eyeballistic, a game development studio with multiple titles in the works, that 30th anniversary would include a remake of the original Mortal Kombat trilogy. In fact, the studio has created a “Mortal Kombat Trilogy Remake Petition” on change.org to get this theoretical ball rolling, as first reported by Nintendo Life.

                    <span>Riot Games’ Joe Ziegler is saying goodbye to his role as Valorant’s game director to work on something new at the studio.
This news comes by way of a new post made by Ziegler on the official Riot website, in which he discusses his last eight years there. He reveals that Valorant, which was officially released last year, is something he’s been working on for eight years as the game director and that now, it’s time for him to move on. 
“It is with a heart full of gratitude and deep excitement that I come to you today with news,” Ziegler writes. “After eight years working on Valorant, building it from the ground up with a team of dedicated and passionate developers who’ve worked tirelessly to serve you all with the respect and admiration that you deserve, I am giving up the mantle of game dir…</span>

                    <span>Cobra Kai returns to Netflix for a fourth season tomorrow. The runaway hit show is based on The Karate Kid films of yesteryear, and even rekindles the feud between Daniel LaRusso (played by Ralph Macchio) and Johnny Lawrence (William Zabka). We recently had the chance to play a mildly amusing Cobra Kai video game from developer Flux, and now we can show our love for the show with new skins in Fortnite.
Sadly none of the characters from the Netflix show are represented in likeness, but their schools are. This means you can suit up as generic characters in the styles of Cobra Kai, Eagle Fang, and Miyagi-Do. Each character you purchase for 800 V-Bucks can change to any of the three schools. You have a variety to pick from, such as Shuto Striker, Mat Master, Keri Commander, Kata Captain, Dojo Defender, and more. You can get five styles in the Karate Ko Bundle, and another five in the Dojo Showdown Bundle. Both sell for 2,000 V-Bucks.
Strike first. Strike hard. No mercy.

The only recognizable character is Agent Jones, who, like the other characters, can switch between dojos. He retails for 800 V-Bucks.
The best item offered is The Crane Kick emote that plays a clip from Joe Esposito&#x27;s song &quot;You&#x27;re The Best Around.&quot; This item will set you back 300 V-Bucks, or you can get it in a bundle with The Teachings of Miyagi back bling, Cobra Coin back bling, Dojo Logo harvesting tool, and Cobra&#x27;s Curse harvesting tool. That bundle is 1,500 V-Bucks.
The Fortnite store has also been updated today with a variety of 2022-themed items, with many festive characters returning for New Year&#x27;s celebration.</span>

                    <span>Ghost Time Games’ Tux And Fanny, from co-developers Albert Birney and Gabriel Koenig, is not only the game I think you may have missed this year, but it is also my Game Of The Year for 2021. This game sends two best friends (alongside a courageous flea and a mischievous cat) through adventures great, small, and absurd to stunning effect – and you owe it to yourself to give this little marvel a play before the year is well and truly out.

Since our new forms are still coming online from their time spent in the primordial flesh soup vat of the RPS Treehouse, we can&#x27;t post over Christmas, so we&#x27;ve prepared some Christmas Cracker jokes instead! You can help fund the research into longer-lasting clone bodies with the RPS supporter program.

Jádro zde doposud používá funkci SHA1, která již několik let není považována za bezpečnou. Navíc ji používá nestandardním způsobem, takže dopředná bezpečnost (forward secrecy) je jen 280.

                    <span>Demon’s Souls started it all. Sure, folks will argue that the concepts that would go on to become the modern-day Soulslike started even earlier in From Software’s history with games like Shadow Tower or the King’s Field games. But the modern incarnations feature challenging action/RPGs that offer battles with larger-than-life bosses, risk/reward offerings, mysteries to explore, and tight combat mechanics that force the player to commit to their choices. 
For the purposes of this list, I’m acknowledging that Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice has plenty of Soulslike framework, but due to some significant differences in player development and build options, it’s being left out of consideration here as a Soulslike. That said, it’s a great game and you should give it a try if you haven’t already. Alrig…</span>

                    <span>It&#x27;s the end of the year, and Steam is running down the games the most people played in 2021. To check out the entire expansive list, click the link here. Read below for some of the most surprising games Steam players invested their time into. 
Starting out, news games like Valheim, New World, and the first season of Halo Infinite&#x27;s multiplayer top the list with more than 200,000 peak players. However, some old stand-bys also make appearances, such as Grand Theft Auto V, Dota 2, and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Perhaps most surprising is Cyberpunk 2077 appearing in the top spot – somewhat shattering the illusion that CD Projekt Red&#x27;s most recent game was an overall disaster. At the very least, a ton of people are still playing Cyberpunk more than a year later. 
With over 100,000 peak players, Capcom&#x27;s excellent Resident Evil Village makes an appearance, as does Farming Simulator 22 and Battlefield 2042. Games you might expect to see here are also accounted for, such as Among Us, Rocket League, Destiny 2, and Dead by Daylight. 
Back 4 Blood, Phasmophobia, Sea of Thieves, and Final Fantasy XIV all stand out in the over 60,000 peak players listing. And not to be forgotten, Left 4 Dead 2, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, Fallout 4, Dying Light, and Loop Hero all had big years, being played by more than 30,000 people in 2021. 
 While we&#x27;re here recognizing video game achievements in 2021, why not check out Game Informer&#x27;s picks for the 10 best games of the year? Thinking about next year, here are the games we&#x27;re most excited to play in 2022.</span>

                    <span>For a while in the late 2000s, developers at Rockstar New England thought they were working on the next big Rockstar game.
They were excited to push the company’s tech and to bring a cult hit into Rockstar’s vision for the future. They were excited for the chance to prove themselves as a Rockstar studio, having recently been purchased by the company. They were excited to lead development on Bully 2, the sequel to Rockstar’s critically acclaimed open-world adventure about life in a private school.
But things don’t always go as planned, and other obligations on a release schedule get in the way of passion projects. Rockstar New England’s Bully 2 was shelved in favor of other, more troubled projects in development, like Max Payne 3 and Red Dead Redemption.

                    <span>The Tomb Raider reboot trilogy is available for free on the Epic Games Store right now. Between now and January 6, 2022, you&#x27;ll be able to grab the Game of the Year Edition of 2013&#x27;s Tomb Raider, 2015&#x27;s Rise of the Tomb Raider: 20 Year Celebration, and the 2018 definitive edition of Shadow of the Tomb Raider.  
While the Tomb Raider trilogy is the biggest name in Epic&#x27;s free library right now, there are several games currently being sold for up to half-off during the storefront&#x27;s holiday sale. This includes Kena: Bridge of Spirits, Red Dead Redemption 2, Far Cry 6, and Cyberpunk 2077. 
If you&#x27;re on the fence about whether or not you should pick up the new Tomb Raider games, check out our reviews. Here are handy links for Tomb Raider, Rise of the Tomb Raider, and Shadow of the Tomb Raider.</span>

                    <span>It’s easy to take a look at existing MMORPGs and applaud how they’re continuing to push forward with amazing expansions and new content like Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker, but breaking into the MMORPG sphere is ridiculously tough. In the olden days, we’d have new MMOs hitting all the time. Today, the lines are blurred where many games now take features and aspects that were once relegated to the genre proper, and few new offerings in the classic space ever appear. New World was awesome in a few ways here. Not only did it seek to break into a space that’s ruled by titans that have been around for eons, but it did so with a good deal of gusto, willing to explore features and mechanics that are anything but safe.

                    <span>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is the greatest game ever made, according to more than 50,000 people who voted in TV Asahi&#x27;s recent poll to find out the 100 best games of all time. Thanks to Kotaku for the story. 
On December 27, the Japanese TV channel ran a three-hour special revealing the ranking. The list was also posted on Twitter by user @MLZ0902.
Of the 100 games on the list, there are a few surprising stand-outs. Sucker Punch&#x27;s Ghost of Tsushima snagged a spot, coming in at number 66, as did Minecraft, ranked number 20. Both versions of Persona 5 – the original base game and the expanded edition, Persona 5 Royal – were on the list in spots 42 and 93, respectively. What made Persona 5 better than Royal in the minds of those voting, it&#x27;s unclear. Lastly, despite only being re…</span>

                    <span>Update: 7:40 p.m. Eastern: Fortnite is back online after being taken offline for several hours due to server issues. The official Fortnite Status Twitter account confirmed the fix and also promised a make-good of sorts to compensate players for the time spent offline. More details on what that reward is should arrive next week.

Original Story: If you’ve been having trouble logging into Fortnite today, you’re not alone. Epic Games has confirmed that the battle royale is currently suffering from login and matchmaking problems.
As of right now (2:07 p.m. Eastern), attempting to launch a Fortnite match slaps you with the following message:
Epic doesn’t share an explanation for the outage but promises to provide info when a solution becomes available. In the meantime, if you were hoping to rack up Victory Royale’s in the game’s ongoing Winterfest event, you’re out of luck for the time being. The same is true if you’re looking to blast foes as Boba Fett to celebrate today’s premiere of the character’s new Disney+ series.
Fortnite is currently unavailable and players are unable to log-in while we investigate an issue.

                    <span>It’s pretty difficult to quantify which games actually whip ass, mostly because it’s a little subjective. That being said, if barrelling through the streets of a futuristic, neon-glazed Detroit, hopping over pursuing cop cars and racing through business offices and factories to the tune of an engrossing soundtrack doesn’t whip ass, I don’t know what does.

                    <span>Every year a glut of video game releases hit the market, making it hard to keep track of everything. RPG fans had a pretty good 2021, from fantastic indies to new games in popular franchises. Bandai Namco gave us two stellar RPGs in Tales of Arise and Scarlet Nexus. Remakes and remasters, like Nier: Replicant, Mass Effect Legendary Edition, and Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, provided plenty of nostalgia, while also bringing new fans into the fold. Longawaited entries finally debuted with Shin Megami Tensei V and Neo: The World Ends With You. And that’s only scratching the surface. Here are five RPGs worth your time that may have slipped past your radar.

                    <span>If you’re a long-time Switch owner, you’ve probably figured out that the console is an indie powerhouse. Sure, the Marios and the Zeldas are great too, but there’s something special about loading up on some great indie games to play in bed or on the go. 2021 was a strong year for indies across the board, but if you’re curious which games attracted the most eyeballs on Switch, Nintendo’s got you covered.
The company released a brief video showing off the best-selling indie games on Switch. Sadly, the montage doesn’t reveal actual sales numbers nor does it rank these titles in any kind of order based on performance. Apparently, all we need to know is that they outsold the gazillion other indie games to hit the eShop in 2021, which is still an impressive feat.

If you don’t feel like watching the video, the best-selling indie games on Switch in 2021 are (in alphabetical order):
Axiom Verge 2
Curse of the Dead Gods
Cyber Shadow
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus
Eastward
Ender Lilies: Quietus of the Knights
Islanders: Console Edition
Littlewood
Road 96
Slime Rancher: Plortable Edition
Spelunky 2
Stick Fight: The Game
Subnautica + Subnautica Below Zero
Tetris Effect: Connected
Unpacking
That’s a strong list of quality games, so it’s reassuring to see that they’ve earned a buck on top of garnering critical praise. I&#x27;d personally recommend giving just about all of them a look.

                    <span>Next year&#x27;s slate of games looks spectacular! But unlike most years, a ton of the games we&#x27;re excited about already have a release date, coming just a couple of months after the prime holiday season. February 2022 is currently looking like one of the most stacked months in gaming ever, reminding us of the biggest and best weeks of the fall. We thought it&#x27;d be fun to compare the upcoming 28-day gauntlet, which is gaining more killers every day, to massive release calendars of gaming&#x27;s past. First, let&#x27;s take a look at what we have to look forward to this February.
The month starts out strong with the Life is Strange Remasted Collection on February 1, followed shortly behind by Dying Light 2 Stay Human, Techland&#x27;s open-world zombie RPG, on February 4. OlliOlli World from Roll7 lands February…</span>

                    <span>New Batman comic books release each week, and we are also frequently treated to new movies and animated shows that put the Caped Crusader in the spotlight. With so much new Batman material to pull from, it&#x27;s amazing that toy manufacturers are still turning to 2009&#x27;s Batman: Arkham Asylum video game for new action figures.
McFarlane Toys is the latest company to create an awesome (and terrifying) figure from this dark game. Falling into McFarlane&#x27;s DC Multiverse line, fans will soon be able to get their hands on the monstrous and hulking Titan Joker action figure. If you played the game, you know The Joker ingested a chemical compound called Titan to try take down Batman. That plan didn&#x27;t go so well, which becomes a plot point for the sequels.
McFarlane shared a first look at this mega-scale figure on Instagram:
Other than this tease, McFarlane hasn&#x27;t shared any details regarding release time frame or pricing. The Batman figure that Titan Joker is holding retailed for roughly $25 when it released a couple of years ago. The Titan figure should be considerably more than that.
McFarlane Toys has a long history of making awesome video game collectibles. You can check out some of the company&#x27;s other offerings here.</span>

                    <span>Yoko Taro is known as the mastermind behind the Nier series (and its predecessor, Drakenguard) though he may be putting the former behind him for good. The eccentric game director with the bizarro mask has teased that he’s putting Nier behind him for good.
In a holiday message recorded on December 22, Taro, along with Nier producer Yosuke Saito and series composer Keiichi Okabe, discussed the last year as well as the sales success of Nier Replicant ver. 1.22474487139 (which has pushed past a million copies, according to the team). The update comes off as a friendly chat between old friends, as they bounce between discussing traveling abroad to meet fans, want they want for Christmas, and complaining about shoulder problems. 
But when Saito asks Taro if he has anything new to share regarding the Nier series, Taro bluntly replies “Nah, nothing!” When Saito asks if he’s fine with not doing anything more with YoRHa, Taro half-jokingly declares “We announced it here today folks! The Nier series is now finished!”  You can watch the video by clicking the embedded tweet below. 
YOKO TARO said it here, NieR is finished 😱

Of course, Taro could easily be kidding and Saito immediately calls him out on it. Taro admits abandoning Nier could be a lie, saying “But … you never know …I might do more if I get a big ‘ol pile of money...”
So is Nier done for good? My money is on “probably not, but don’t expect anything new for a long time.” Especially if Taro does indeed receive bags of cash. In October, Taro released Voice of Cards, a turn-based RPG revolving around cards (but isn’t actually a deck-builder). He’s got some “free time” on his hands now that it and Nier Replicant are out the door, and we’re intrigued to see what he’s got up his sleeve next.</span>

&quot;What games should I get for my PlayStation 5?&quot; This is the question we&#x27;ve been asked the most since Sony&#x27;s new generation of gaming arrived last November. People want to see what games are the best showpieces of PlayStation 5&#x27;s power, and also which ones take their beloved medium to new heights. Although the PlayStation 5 is still young, it has already amassed a nice library of games, including a few titles that you can&#x27;t play anywhere else.
The Game Informer staff has selected 10 games that we consider to be the PlayStation 5&#x27;s absolute best. Over time, this article will be updated with the latest releases that we think crack the top 10.
Please note that while the list below contains 10 entries, we aren’t ranking them. If a game has made it this far (and …</span>

                    <span>When Knockout City was first announced earlier this year, I confused it with Rocket Arena, the other stylized 3-versus-3 third-person multiplayer game published by Electronic Arts in 2020. However, unlike the latter, Knockout City was highly praised by fans and critics alike when released earlier this year. And while it’s a rather unconventional pick for Game Informer’s Best Sports award, Velan Studios’ eccentric dodgeball game is an easy standout in a year when most sports franchises are coasting by.

                    <span>Horizon Forbidden West’s new setting is teeming with exotic, dangerous, and never-before-seen machines. We already broke down the fearsome Slitherfang, and Guerrilla divulged some additional details on previously revealed robotic creatures. But, for those who haven’t kept track of the game’s fearsome new faces, here’s a handy round-up of the new machines that have been revealed thus far. 
  



      
												
Rollerback
Rollerbacks resemble giant armadillos that, you guessed it, like to roll. They fold their massive bodies into spinning balls of death and hurl themselves at targets, seemingly using the flames firing from their scale-like armor as propulsion. We&#x27;ve also seen them eject their scales as projectiles, then magnetically recall them. Additionally, Rollerbacks are even capabl…</span>

                    <span>If you’re excited to kill Chaos in Stranger of Paradise Final Fantasy Origin, experiencing everything the adventure has to offer will require jumping through an extra hoop. Square Enix has announced that the game will feature additional, downloadable missions that won’t be available at launch. The catch? You can only get them by pre-ordering the game digitally. 
The missions in question are called Trials of the Dragon King, Wanderer of the Rift, and Different Future. There are no details on what they entail content-wise, only that they won’t be available to purchase separately. The only way to access them is via the Digital Deluxe Edition of the game, which runs for $89.99.

                    <span>Legendary commentator, broadcaster, and NFL Hall of Fame coach John Madden has passed away today at the age of 85.
Madden was best known for his role in the NFL as head coach for the Oakland Raiders from 1969–1978, where he led the team to a Super Bowl XI victory in the 1976 season. He later became an unforgettable, bombastic broadcaster for CBS, Fox, ABC, and NBC, covering and commentating on NFL games every week. Along with his memorable advertisements for companies like &quot;Tough Actin&#x27;&quot; Tinactin to his various cameos in film and television, he was a nearly inescapable part of American culture for well over 30 years following his successful coaching career.

We also know John Madden from his years of being involved in video games, having a franchise emblazoned with his name since John Madden Football in 1988. For 23 years, he had given his name, likeness, and often times his voice and infectious persona to the games developed by Electronic Arts now known as Madden NFL. He has an indelible legacy in the world of sports, video games, and culture at large. The least we can say is thank you, John, for the years of sharing your knowledge with your players and audience, being endlessly entertaining, and playing such a big part in making video games what they are today.
Our condolences go out to John&#x27;s wife Virginia, their sons Michael and Joseph, and their families, friends, and loved ones who knew John.</span>

                    <span>Projekt operačního systému Trident (dříve TrueOS, ještě dříve PC-BSD) už sice před dvěma měsíci skončil, ale s ním spjaté desktopové prostředí Lumina žije dál. Po dílčí aktualizaci 1.6.1 přichází nyní nová verze 1.6.2. Už z číslování je jasné, že nejde o revoluci, ostatně Lumina trpí podobným vývojářským podstavem jako jiné okrajové projekty. Ale je to hezký signál, že žije dál.</span>

                    <span>The Oculus Quest 2 is now available, offering a wireless virtual reality experience for those craving new adventures. Whether you&#x27;re looking for a shooter or a way to get some cardio in, here are a few of the best VR games for you to play with your new Oculus Quest 2. 
While the Oculus Quest has its own library, the variety of games is enhanced due to the ability to use the Link as an option to play even more adventures. Some of our recommendations below don&#x27;t need the Link, but we&#x27;ve noted which ones do require the additional component for transparency.

                    <span>Diablo has, for good reasons, become a shorthand for describing the flavour of gothic, grimdark fantasy setting in games, where pus-filled demonic hordes and rotting, undead corpses scour a hellish cathedral looking for unwitting adventurers. For all its wretched decay, however, the series still feels like an indulgence to be savoured. Its clickiness and abhorrent sights make the games endlessly gratifying, and masterful butchery of fiends eases most players into a comfortable rhythm. And part of that appeal lies in the macabre yet captivating fantasy it so deftly peddles — all that blood, gore and guts really make for a grisly setting that’s nearly impossible to look away from.


Tainted Grail: Conquest conveys the same sense of blight and doom in its dark fantasy universe — one that’s a reimagining of Arthurian legends — but also ups the ante with a huge wallop of Slay The Spire’s roguelike, deck-building elements.

                    <span>As a child struggling to sleep at night I&#x27;d dream of three worlds. First and least of these was Desert World, a blithe eternity of golden sand always viewed from kilometres up, where fizzing white rings rose toward me like expanding surf. I&#x27;d try to find my way down to the surface, but always at the risk of glitching straight through and ending up in Snake World, where monstrous serpents emerged from darkened kitchens.


Somewhere between these two poles lay the realm of the Animals, not that they were really animals, but clouds of eyelash-thin mandible, grot and sparkle, like rotten food on the point of becoming a school of tropical fish. I loved Animal World. I used to spend hours trying to mind-hack my way into it. I was pretty shocked to find its likeness in Sluggish Morss: Pattern Circus - an irresistibly strange, gristly, sorrowful, comical and inventive album of creatures, songs, places and phrases from Jack King-Spooner and composer Helena Celle.

                    <span>It’s hard to imagine a collaboration between Zero Escape and Danganronpa creators Kotaro Uchikoshi and Kazutaka Kodaka going under the radar, but an odd release schedule (involving dropping a half-finished experience on Apple Arcade) saw interest in the collaboration buried by the time the game hit PC last month. Which is a shame, since it’s a rather unique title in their respective careers, and it charts new waters for these cult directors.


World’s End Club was the first game the pair released since forming their own studio, Too Kyo Games, and can best be described as a bizarre but intriguing blend of platforming and death games, starring a cast of prepubescent children way too young to be fixing the world or dealing with cults. Think Danganronpa, if Danganronpa was a Saturday morning cartoon rather than a murder game filled with psychopaths.

We wish you a merry Christmas, a happy holiday, and a general Festivus for the rest of yous as we scuttle out of the RPS Treehouse for a couple of weeks and have a nice big sleep in our mountain of sweet wrappers. We&#x27;ll see you back bright and early on Tuesday January 4th 2022.

                    <span>If you like your RPG adventures to contain dungeons and dragons, and be as complex as Dungeons &amp; Dragons, perhaps you might fancy the latest game being given away free in the Epic Games Store&#x27;s festive sale. For 24 hours, Epic are handing out Pathfinder: Kingmaker free for keepsies. It&#x27;s a vast fantasy RPG based on the Pathfinder pen &#x27;n&#x27; paper system, played out in ye olde isometric perspective. The sort of RPG that&#x27;s fascinating to some, offputting to others—so a great candidate for a freebie.

Jim Lowe&#x27;s Green Door might not be a Christmas song, but it sure can feel like one—especially inside the festive action of Dracula Cha Cha. That&#x27;s right, it&#x27;s Christmas Eve, which means one more night without sleeping, and time to play Dracula Cha Cha.

They&#x27;re named Takaya Kuroda &amp; Goodfellas and they have a Christmas song out. Not only is this excellent news, I can&#x27;t get over the fact it straight up sounds like Kiryu delivering some festive cheer. So get comfy, bang this on, and let Kiryu&#x27;s warm tones wash over you like mulled wine.

                    <span>Right now Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker is so popular you can’t buy it anymore. To prevent overcrowding and crashing servers, Square Enix have had to halt free trials and new sales to keep the game stable after an unprecedented surge in popularity this summer. Between that and the global shortage of materials to add more servers, it may be quite some time until new players are able to experience it. If you have an active subscription and manage to brave the long queues however, you’re one of the lucky few who get to experience something truly special. For everyone else: hang in there, it will be worth the wait.

                    <span>MERRY CHRISTMAS YA FILTHY ANIMALS! This time of year can be one that feels particularly apocalyptic, as well as, you know, good will to all I guess. If I have to. The indie games I&#x27;ve been playing recently all have a bit of an end-of-the-world flavour to &#x27;em, whether literal or metaphorical or by your own hand, if you feel like it. I dunno, I actually found them strangely relaxing, as a sort of counterpoint to the chaos of my own life during the holiday season. See what you think.

                    <span>The latest free game giveaway in GOG&#x27;s winter sale is an unexpected one for the festive season, but perhaps a game which captures the feeling of being trapped at a seemingly endless Christmas lunch with awful relatives: I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream. Nothing says &#x27;bad family Christmas&#x27; like being tortured for 109 years by a sentient supercomputer which nuked humanity and keeps only five people alive to torment. The 90s point &#x27;n&#x27; click adventure game is a grim one (so grim!), but one which does have its fans.

                    <span>In a special Christmas message from three of the NieR series&#x27; development stars, creative director Yoko Taro has announced that NieR is over. No more NieR games for us... unless he receives a massive pile of money. Quickly, it becomes clear he&#x27;s just joshing around. Another classic ruse from the man in the Emil mask, and a subtle hint that they may have something new in the works. Plus, it&#x27;s just a really delightful video and you should all watch it.

                    <span>Though I hardly remember the Steam Autumn Sale ending, the Steam Winter Sale started yesterday, bringing squillions more cheap video games. If you&#x27;re staring baffled at an endless list of innumerable deals, you could use some help. Honestly, most of our Steam Autumn Sale recommendations still stand, but the few of us in the RPS treehouse who haven&#x27;t already clocked off for the Christmas holiday do have some fresh picks for you too.

                    <span>We&#x27;re nearing the end of the year and my brain&#x27;s battery is flashing red. There&#x27;s some Christmassy-ness flowing in to tide me over, thanks to the mini-Christmas tree in my room. Every year it&#x27;s popped on the wardrobe alongside an honorary Lynx Africa. They share the same festive colours, after all.
Having pondered my tree for a bit, I thought about trees in games and how they make for good side quests. Now join me by the bark, as I examine why this might be the case in a roundabout manner.

                    <span>When I was younger I watched a nature documentary narrated by David Attenborough (I realise that doesn&#x27;t narrow it down) and in this nature documentary David told me about a cave. It is a very big cave, and every night a huge colony of bats come screaming out of the entrance. They spend the day clinging to the ceiling of this big cave, and all their bat poo falls down and has become a towering heap carpeting the floor.
But then David said look, the carpet is moving. And it turns out that the whole bottom of the cave is covered in cockroaches and giant centipedes. And if ever a small baby bat or an old injured bat falls, it is eaten alive by this hoard of chittering insects. This nature documentary haunted me, for it was the worst thing I could imagine happening.
Anyway, Nate has been to that cave and he&#x27;s going to tell us all about it for this episode of our supporters only podcast, The Nate Files. Thanks for being a supporter, pals!

                    <span>It&#x27;s been a busy, kind of mixed year for strategy games. Ever a broad church, 2021&#x27;s seen enough releases to keep ten of me busy, from the easy-going Legion War to the month-consuming Shadow Empire. I don&#x27;t know about you, but my personal &quot;to play&quot; list is out of control.
And yet, while we&#x27;ve had plenty to enjoy this year, it&#x27;s felt like a period of build-up to something bigger. I&#x27;m not one for looking forward. If a game&#x27;s not out yet it tends to disappear from my mind, making room for a hundred other recent releases in this age of plenty. That I&#x27;ve less interest in looking back over this year than I do pondering the next suggests that maybe we&#x27;re in for something special in the coming twelve months. Or perhaps it&#x27;s just been a rough one and I&#x27;m very sleep deprived and don&#x27;t want to think about 2021. Either way, let&#x27;s have a look at what&#x27;s in store for strategy fans in 2022, yeah?

                    <span>Embracer Group are continuining to do their part in attempts to merge the entire video games industry into one megacorp, this week announcing another five intended acquisitions. Among these are Perfect World, the publishers of Star Trek Online and Torchlight, and the studio behind Scribblenauts Showdown, Shiver Entertainment. They&#x27;re also going transmedia, buying comics and TV company Dark Horse as well as an animation company and a video-on-demand network. Now they just need to get into food and housing, then our dystopian dreams of one corp owning our entire lives can come true.

                    <span>A recent round of BIOS updates for Dell and Alienware systems has turned out to be something of a bad batch. As first spotted by Bleeding Computer, multiple owners of Dell-made PCs – including the Alienware Aurora R8 and Inspiron 5680 gaming desktops, as well as the Latitude 5320 and 5520 business laptops – started developing big problems after installing the new BIOS versions. Failed boots, mainly, which of course makes it harder to apply potential fixes.

                    <span>Everyone knows there are two conditions that must be met before Christmas can officially begin. The first is playing Skeal. The second is the arrival of Steam&#x27;s Winter Sale. Blissfully, we can now tick both of these objectives off our to-do list, as Valve have finally unleashed their flurry of seasonal deals. Between now and January 5th, thousands of games will be discounted across Steam, and you&#x27;ll also be able to claim a free sticker every day as well, for those of you who enjoy that sort of thing.

As we prepare to put a full stop on the year and see out 2021 from our cocoon of Christmas chocolate wrappers, we must also sadly bid farewell to our news writer Imogen Beckhelling, who is heading off for a new adventure in the games industry in the New Year. Today is Imogen&#x27;s last day at RPS, so come and say goodbye.

                    <span>It struck me recently that I’ve not played as much of Halo Infinite’s multiplayer as I thought I would. I envisaged myself wiling away most evenings with my mates, playing Oddball and Slayer and laughing like someone from those video game adverts, swaying violently with a controller in hand.
I now know the reason why and I hate to admit it. Infinite doesn’t have a battle royale mode, which I&#x27;ve come to realise is the perfect FPS template for gaming with my mates. Something about it just works, you know? Listen, let me explain.

                    <span>I know almost nothing about Alfred Hitchcock. He’s the kind of archetypal director whose work I’ve been exposed to in bits and pieces without ever actually sitting down to watch one of his films in full. All of that is to say that, upon starting Alfred Hitchcock - Vertigo the game, I was in no position to judge whether it was a faithful adaptation of the film or to recognize all but the most obvious illusions to Hitchcock’s body of work (look, birds!). That’s okay, though, because as it turns out, Vertigo is an original story based on a collage of Hitchcockian concepts, not a direct adaption of the 1958 film by the same name.
Vertigo the game follows author Ed Miller as he grapples with a debilitating case of vertigo–a condition that leaves him unable to stand as the world appears to spin around him–and paralyzing guilt over the death of his daughter and her mother, Faye, after their car falls off a bridge into a ravine below. With Ed bed ridden, it’s up to Dr. Julia Lomas, psychologist and psychiatrist, and Sheriff Nick Reyes to unravel the mystery of what really happened, and whether Faye and his daughter even exist. My thoughts on how Vertigo goes about telling this story are... complicated.

                    <span>Final Fantasy XIV players haven’t had it easy these last few weeks. The sheer success of its Endwalker expansion resulted in lengthy login queues and server errors. It’s become so popular that Square Enix have temporarily stopped selling the game, taking its Starter and Complete Editions off sale. All the while, some low-poly grapes stayed static in the breeze. Jagged, delicious, minding their own business. Until their blockiness was papped and thrust into the public eye. Memes ensued and the grapes became the talk of the town, so much so that they’ve been smoothed out in the latest patch, much to everyone’s dismay.

We could do anything together, we four. And then we stumbled upon this door...

It&#x27;s a gorgeous-looking adventure that came out in early access back in October, but unfortunately the launch didn&#x27;t go as well as the devs had hoped it would. Yesterday, they announced that they&#x27;ve had to lay off around 25 employees to keep the studio going. They add that development will continue, albeit at an understandably slower pace.

                    <span>Hello folks. It&#x27;s been a funny old year, 2021. On the games side, it&#x27;s often felt like a year of shifting goalposts. Games that were delayed by the pandemic last year finally got their due in 2021, but in turn many of the releases we were expecting this year have inevitably slipped into 2022. The pandemic has affected games of all sizes this year, and I don&#x27;t think it will go down in the history books as one of our all-time greats. There were still plenty of fantastic games that came out this year, mind, and we&#x27;re still counting down our absolute favourites over in our Advent Calendar. 
That said, I do think 2021 will prove to be a pivotal year for RPS - and not just because I stole Graham&#x27;s key card and changed the locks on the front door of the Treehouse. It&#x27;s been a year of immense change here at the site, so I wanted to take some time to reflect on everything that&#x27;s happened this year, and look forward to what we&#x27;ve got in store for 2022.

                    <span>If you simply can&#x27;t get enough of raccoon detectives sleuthing around dystopian Vancouver, then you&#x27;re in luck, because more is on the way. Developers EggNut have announced that a new Backbone game is coming in 2022, dropping us back into the snowy, animal-filled city. We don&#x27;t know much about it yet, but Backbone is an excellent detective puzzle game, and a gorgeous one at that, so I have high hopes for the next one.

                    <span>This door on the Advent Calendar is probably locked with a needlessly complicated key split into several pieces. Also, it is very, very tall, as if for someone who is already taller than average and then wears heels.

                    <span>After GTA: The Trilogy - Definitive Edition had a pretty naff launch last month, Rockstar ended up giving PC remaster owners copies of the oldies for free as an apology. The devs have another freebie for those folks too now - you can claim a free copy of GTA V: Premium Edition, GTA IV: Complete Edition, LA Noire, Bully: Scholarship Edition, or Max Payne 3 over the holiday period. Ah, free festive violence.

                    <span>We called Final Fantasy VII Remake a luscious spectacle that takes FF7 in a bold new direction. You know what else takes it in a new direction? Dresses. Loads of them. Modders have been hard at work weaving nice dresses with their virtual looms at a rate of knots. Oh, and they’ve morphed characters into Buster Swords and produced some other equally useful things too. Let&#x27;s have a gander at some of their most interesting creations.

                    <span>Update: Loop Hero&#x27;s time is done! The dino-battling FPS Second Extinction is the new freebie. 
Original Story: This year had us stuck in many video game time loops, but one of my absolute favourites was Loop Hero. I never thought an autobattler RPG would hook me the way it did, but I spent hours upon hours helping a little knight circle a seemingly endless void, and had a wonderful time doing it. If you didn&#x27;t have a chance to play it earlier this year, it&#x27;s now free on the Epic Game Store until tomorrow. I heartily encourage you to pick this one up, it&#x27;s one of our favourite games of 2021.

                    <span>The great thing about traditions is: you can just make them up. While some traditions feel more real because they&#x27;re embedded deeper in our culture, you can start your own whenever you want, and jettison any you don&#x27;t care for. Anything can be imbued with special meaning and, over time, grow into a tradition you cherish and come to anticipate. So here I am, approaching Christmas, so ready for my annual play of Skeal. Join me, reader dear.

                    <span>There’s no single, solitary reason why it’s been so hard to buy certain PC components over the past year and a bit – it’s more like a perfect storm of multiple circumstances, unfortunate coincidences and unforseen annoyances. That said, one of the biggest underlying causes of MIA CPU and graphics card stock has been a shortage of the chips needed to make them, and it’s a shortage that Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger has warned could likely continue into 2023.

                    <span>Oslain Brante tried to be a decent guy. Kind to his relatives except the one who murdered him. Resolutely loyal to his friends, even dying for one. Willing to die once again rather than betray his revolutionary allies. But it just kept going wrong for reasons that felt utterly artificial and sometimes deeply dissatisfying.
I&#x27;d have given up on the game if it weren&#x27;t so interesting. For one thing, none of those deaths were final. He died as a child and came back. He died as a teenager and came back. These were not saved games, but ordinary occurrences. It&#x27;s an interesting world made infuriating by awkward design choices.

                    <span>A new Cyberpunk 2077 mod makes the dystopian RPG&#x27;s decorative monorails functional, adding a metro system with cute wee trains you can ride. For all the game&#x27;s flaws, I did greatly enjoy wondering Night City&#x27;s streets, cooing at giant buildings and bright colours, and today I was glad to continue that tourism on rail. How lovely to see the megacity from a new perspective, looking down on rooftops and being buzzed by hovercars. See a wee bit of my journey in a video below.

                    <span>I’m rubbish at the building component of Minecraft; it’s much easier to simply download a map and wander around in the splendour of someone else’s creation. And if you’ve got the ray tracing beta version of Minecraft for Windows installed, I can heartily recommend you too take a wander through the Nvidia RTX Winter World: a vast, Christmassy and very, very pretty custom map that has you helping Santa throw a festive shindig while you trade sweets with his elves.

Our short king&#x27;s battle out of the underworld beat out its closest competition, cosy escapism simulator, Animal Crossing: New Horizons in the polls by almost fourfold.

                    <span>As you go to open today&#x27;s door on the RPS Advent Calendar, you realise it&#x27;s locked, and you&#x27;ll need to get the keycard from somewhere. Plus you won&#x27;t be allowed through unless you&#x27;re dressed like a waiter, and even then you&#x27;ll get frisked by a security guard, who would be none too pleased to find the poison in your pocket.

Now developers Eugen Systems are making a spiritual successor called WARNO, which is coming to Steam Early Access next month.

This second series arrives almost exactly two years since the first, but work is already underway on the third.

For those of you more skilled than me, the trailer comes alongside the news that the DLC will launch January 6th.

They&#x27;ve only been in training for three months? And they&#x27;re not even properly qualified? Oh no, what have we done...

Only kidding! I mean, statistically speaking I probably wouldn&#x27;t get on with all of you, but I actually really appreciate that you&#x27;re taking the time to read this and check out what games we&#x27;ll be playing this weekend. In fact, we&#x27;ll probably play loads of games over our breaks, but we&#x27;ll tell you about those later. Until I see you again, have a lovely time celebrating the end of the year, however you do it.

                    <span>Walking through the smoggy jerktown that is London a while back, the thought occurred that for all the building games I&#x27;ve played, I&#x27;d never seen one about remodelling an existing city. The closest I knew was NIMBY Rails, which isn&#x27;t even close.
It turns out I was miles behind the curve, as The Architect Colon Paris already exists.

                    <span>Earlier this year, Black Isle Studios and Interplay Entertainment announced they were porting the old 2001 hack and slash Baldur&#x27;s Gate: Dark Alliance to PC and consoles. It came out on PlayStation back in summer, alas they didn&#x27;t give a date for PC. But, surprise! It&#x27;s today! PC folks can finally try out the Baldur&#x27;s Gate that console users first experienced 20 years ago. I did a full playthrough this summer and had a lovely time, at the expense of my partner, who I made sit through one of the jankiest couch co-op games in existence.

But we (I) gather ourselves and chat FPS news, like how PUBG is going free to play, Overwatch actually has something new, and lots of Halo Infinite stuff. We also get one final update on Imogen&#x27;s Apex Legends rank. I&#x27;d love to say it&#x27;s positive, but it&#x27;s actually quite crushing. Merry Christmas.

They didn&#x27;t have much to say about it at the time, but last night they announced it properly. Named Nine Sols, it&#x27;s an action platformer with combat inspired by Sekiro. Honestly, they still don&#x27;t have much to say about it beyond that, but they have released a gorgeous poster featuring a cat-like character that you can see in full below.

                    <span>You know what Christmas was missing? The unmatched fear of being chased by terrifying killer robots through a shopping mall. Five Nights At Freddy&#x27;s: Security Breach launched last night, inviting players to fend off a whole new crew of animatronics. This is the eighth mainline game in the long-running pizzeria-based horror series (I know, there are loads of spin-offs too), and for the first time it will let players properly roam free, rather than be tied to a desk monitoring cameras.

                    <span>Look outside. Is it snowing? Well, it&#x27;s snowing in video games, where it matters. The winter months are here to lay frosty waste to the Northern hemisphere, which is where list goblins like me originate. 
To celebrate the first flakes of glimmering ice wafting out of the sky like God&#x27;s own sub-zero dandruff, here&#x27;s a list of the best snow in PC games. Put on a hat, for heaven&#x27;s sake.

                    <span>They say the best things come in small packages, which is clearly nonsense in a world where giant novelty cheques exist but giant novelty bills don&#x27;t. When it comes to price tags, however, the smaller the better rings true, especially when it&#x27;s a full 50% off a quality gaming keyboard like the Corsair K65 RGB Mini.

                    <span>Dota 2 has a new event mode and battle pass. Aghanim from last year&#x27;s Aghanim&#x27;s Labyrinth event has returned, and this time a &quot;multiverse-melding mishap&quot; has split him into several doppelgängers players must rescue. The event mode is free, but it arrives alongside a new battle pass that&#x27;ll cost money to enter.

More strangely, today&#x27;s update also introduces experimental gamepad support.

                    <span>The makers of Arma and DayZ have revealed Enfusion, the new cross-platform game engine they plan to build future games on. No, Bohemia Interactive haven&#x27;t announced Arma 4, but they do say they would use Enfusion for &quot;any potential new Arma game&quot;, so maybe that&#x27;s something to bear in mind while looking at its screenshots of vast landscapes. While they don&#x27;t have much more than screenshots and a wee video to show right now (sorry, engine enthusiasts), they do hint that they&#x27;ll release some sort of &quot;playable demonstration of its features&quot; at some point &quot;soon&quot;.

                    <span>The Epic Games Store Holiday Sale started today, with lots of discounts and that but more importantly: 15 days of free video games. They&#x27;re starting with one that I&#x27;m certainly curious enough to play for free but not buy: Shenmue 3. Yeah gwan, I&#x27;ll grab that. Epic are also going wild with coupons again, giving a £10 (or $10) coupon on every game you buy which costs at least £13.99 (or $14.99). Given Epic&#x27;s habit of paying for timed exclusives, they do have discounts on some games you&#x27;ll not get elsewhere, or at least not with those vouchers.

                    <span>Let me slap you with the caveat up front. Halo Infinite&#x27;s best place is its open world, through which you can swing like a honking metal Tarzan and do sweet Warthog jumps from cliffs. But its best level, the most satisfying A-to-B gun boulevard, comes late in the campaign (spoilers ahead). The House Of Reckoning is a series of rooms where contrived artificial battlefields have been constructed inside an alien fortress. They are abstractly human structures surrounded by sand, as if your extraterrestrial enemies have been playing house but believe a homo sapiens&#x27; house looked exactly like a chunk of Normandy beach circa 1944. The narrative reasoning behind this level is absurd. But the fights that occur within are excellent.

                    <span>God rest ye merry listener, let nothing you dismay - for today, for one night only, EWS stands for Electronic Wrestling Show. Yes, our podcast&#x27;s wrestling promotion has rolled into your town for a showstopping tag team match. Each of your pod hosts fields a three-game tag team of our favourite games of the year, and fields them in a spectacular(ly described) ladder match. The victor will claim the GOTY In The Bank briefcase and win the chance to compete next year as well.
Before we get to that, though, we must first discuss (at length) whether 200 t-shirts is a lot of t-shirts, what Nate is having for his Christmas dinner, what kind of cop duo would be named Halloumi &amp; Date, and also what our favourite Christmas songs are. Nate also does a really good Mankind pun. Plus: which wrestler would be the best hugger?

In fact, I bet it attracts bad sleeps. Anyway, I’m considering the installation of a feathery net because DokeV’s music video from the latest Geoff Awards has infiltrated the darkest recesses of my brain again. I thought I’d shaken off the trailer song, but it’s back with full force and haunts me more than ever.

                    <span>Final Fantasy VII Remake certainly knows how to make a good first impression. The original&#x27;s bombing mission sequence, which sees Cloud and co. blow up a planet-killing mako reactor in the industrialised hellhole of Midgar&#x27;s city centre, was already one of the Final Fantasy series&#x27; best openers, but here we get to really luxuriate in every last detail of its twenty-four-year glow-up. Director Tetsuya Nomura may have a reputation for excess in JRPG circles (both in his tangled storylines and his passion for buckles and belts), but in FF7R that tendency toward indulgence has been applied with deadly, laser-like precision.

                    <span>CD Projekt have announced plans to pay out $1,850,000 (£1.4 million) to settle a class action lawsuit brought by investors over Cyberpunk 2077&#x27;s troubles. The suit started in December 2020 with investors primarily upset with the fact that the console version was in such a state, claiming that CDP hadn&#x27;t been honest about the game and its prospects. CDP say that the proposed settlement terms make clear that though they are paying out, this &quot;does not imply admission of any responsibility&quot;.
