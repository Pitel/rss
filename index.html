For years now, GameStop has been on the ropes. We&#x27;ve had to watch idly by while the stores started peddling kitschy video game merch, all the while pulling back the focus on the games themselves. It&#x27;s the circle of life — as technology changes, certain services or even entire industries will become obsolete while others spring up in their place. After another round of layoffs from the company hit the news, it feels like the retail institution could fold even as soon as the next few months. The meme stock saga kept it afloat for a while, but it doesn&#x27;t look like that momentum has been able to translate to long term sustainability.
For Millennials and older Gen Z, going to GameStop for a hype-filled midnight release of your favorite game, or even a lazy afternoo…</span>

                              <span>The Ryzen 7 5800X3D is one of AMD&#x27;s fastest gaming CPUs - and the only one on that list that runs on cheap, widely available AM4 motherboards with better value DDR4 RAM. That&#x27;s probably why the 5800X3D is reportedly AMD&#x27;s most popular CPU by sales - and it&#x27;s also why this deal is coming to the fore. Right now, you can pick up this fast AF CPU for $300 thanks to an Ebay code (JOLLY15), a hefty reduction from its launch price of $450.

Also chickens! You can raise chickens now! They&#x27;ll give you eggs, which give you more chickens. There&#x27;s the real magic.

                              <span>The Crucial P5 Plus is one of those drives that turn up in these deals articles a lot. That&#x27;s because it&#x27;s designed to undercut the likes of the WD SN850, Seagate Firecuda 530 and Samsung 980 Pro, offering slightly slower sequential speeds at a lower price point. That tradeoff is one that I&#x27;d make in almost every situation, as you&#x27;ll definitely notice the extra money in your wallet more than you&#x27;ll notice a fractional difference in game load times!
The P5 Plus&#x27;s 1TB model is the one discounted today, with a drop to £90.86 - that&#x27;s the lowest price we&#x27;ve ever recorded for this model and a good value for a high-end SSD suitable for PC and PS5.

Chumps who want to fight alongside their summonable Spirit Ashes have to go to their own special colosseum, for nerds.

You can now once again scurry around underground death mazes in Rundown 2.0 Infection, the first Rundown shakeup added by developers 10 Chambers after the game&#x27;s March 2020 release. They plan to re-release all the others, too.
New Rundowns used to entirely replace GTFO&#x27;s levels every few months, but nowadays each new set is here to stay. How nice of the awful mutant zombie horrors to stick around.

                              <span>If you haven&#x27;t heard, Microsoft are currently trying to buy Activision Blizzard. Competition regulators from the UK, the EU and the US have been questioning the deal, so in an attempt to reassure them last month Microsoft apparently offered Sony a ten-year commitment to keep selling Call Of Duty on Playstation. Today, Xbox Head Phill Spencer announced that they&#x27;ve made a similar 10-year CoD commitment to Steam and, uh, Nintendo, on which no CoD games currently exist. 
Nintendo have signed, while Valve CEO Gabe Newell says his company won&#x27;t bother with a legal agreement, in part because they don&#x27;t believe in &quot;requiring any partner to have an agreement that locks them to shipping games on Steam into the distant future&quot;.

I can&#x27;t say I disagree but ooh, hark at you, aren&#x27;t you practical. You&#x27;d be lost in cool conversations behind the school bike sheds. We must move on.

                              <span>2023 is shaping up to be a great time for wartime RTS games. If Men Of War 2 and Company Of Heroes 3 weren&#x27;t enough to keep you busy on the WW2 side of global historical conflicts, Petroglyph Games&#x27; The Great War: The Western Front will also be stepping into the trenches of WW1 at some point next year as well – literally, in this case, as planning, digging and capturing these muddy lines of defence will play a vital role in both its pre-combat Theatre Commander mode and busy real-time strategy battles. Recently, I got to play through one of its RTS battles, but what I found was a strategy game quite unlike its WW2 rivals. 
In some ways, this shouldn’t be surprising. As Petroglyph Games’ lead designer Chris Becker tells me over email, “WW1 is known for being a war of attrition and a battle of inches,” leading to fewer sweeping power plays when it comes to securing a victory. Indeed, your main concern here isn’t so much the winning of each individual battle, but maintaining your side’s National Will, which Becker says will be &quot;in constant fluctuation&quot; throughout the campaign – and with both the Allies and Central Powers to pick from here, that could mean very different things depending on who you choose. &quot;It’s essential that players continue to monitor this, as the relentless toll that the war will take on National Will can result in overall victory or defeat,&quot; says Becker. &quot;Authenticity is at the heart of this, we wanted to truly represent what &#x27;victory&#x27; meant in the war - even with success, there is cost.&quot;

                              <span>How the heck do you review Dwarf Fortress? Much like the procedurally generated world spat out at the start of every game, there’s already a huge pile of established lore and history out there from the 16 years it’s been around. It’s like being asked to review Lord of the Rings. It&#x27;s a vast undertaking, and there aren&#x27;t any friendly eagles on hand to cut through its dense mythos. Prior to releasing on Steam, I had put a few dozen hours into what is now known as Dwarf Fortress Classic (which is still available for free from Bay 12&#x27;s website), split over several different periods of time. Thing is, I never really got very far. I’d find a good tutorial, lose a few fortresses to horrible mistakes and then really get established. But then I’d be distracted by the realities of everyday life and by the time I got back to it, I’d forgotten everything and all my resources were hopelessly out of date because of all the wonderful, lovingly detailed updates. Then the cycle would start again. 

The good news is that this new version of Dwarf Fortress released on Steam does an admirable job of making the game considerably more approachable. I was apprehensive at first, but then something clicked and I lost the first of what would be many afternoons over the past fortnight, safe in the knowledge that when I eventually stepped away from this goliath, I’d be able to come back without feeling overwhelmed and have to start all over again. It’s still good ol’ Dwarf Fortress, but this is the most accessible the game has ever been while still being deep, demanding and a legend worthy of being inscribed on a mudstone goblet.

                              <span>Ixion starts by asking the question &quot;What if Homeworld was a management sim?&quot;. It then proceeds to answer that question in a comprehensive and convincing manner. Bulwark Studios&#x27; star hopping epic takes the operatic, elegiac grandeur of Relic&#x27;s RTS classic, but replaces the space battles with a chewy mixture of stellar logistics.
Also like Homeworld, it&#x27;s a darned stylish thing. The game commences with a spectacular intro cutscene wherein a futuristic space-shuttle launches from Earth, breaking through the atmosphere to dock with a gigantic, revolving space-station like a chromed hubcap off some petrolhead&#x27;s pride &amp; joy. The cutscene neatly transitions into the play-perspective, where you see that same shuttle slide into the docking bay from the cold void outside. Welcome to the Tiqqun, Administrator. Your long journey starts here.

                              <span>Early in tonight&#x27;s Dead Island 2&#x27;s showcase, a character in a live action segment makes a self-referential joke that live action trailers set unreasonable expectations for video games. Let me tell you now: that is not true. I&#x27;d wager the writing and acting will be more believable in the game than in this live action short. 
At the showcase&#x27;s centre of those wasted 15 minutes was, at least, a new viscera-slick trailer of the actual Dead Island 2. So you can watch that below.

In 2017, the Nintendo Switch was a revelation. Up to that point, the division between handheld consoles and home consoles was very clear. Handhelds were for smaller, less prestigious titles, while home consoles were for the big, knock-your-socks-off blockbusters. Enter Nintendo, with the friendly reminder that it didn&#x27;t have to be that way. It&#x27;s not that difficult to get a handheld to run a home console-quality game, and it&#x27;s not that difficult to add an HDMI output to a handheld for those who still value the TV screen experience.
Nintendo was the first major company to properly execute on this idea (Sony&#x27;s PlayStation TV doesn&#x27;t count), and the Switch saw massive success as a result. Here, at last, was a Nintendo home console with no clumsy gimmicks - and, perhaps mo…</span>

                              <span>Add copyright law to the list of things Travis has almost sh*t on
Travis Touchdown and the No More Heroes series both turned 15 this week and, to celebrate, franchise creator SUDA51 shared some unique information about his murderous mascot. Even longtime fans of the franchise such as myself were shocked.
My Japanese is lousy, but I can read the language well enough to recognize the characters &quot;Ru-Ku&quot; in the image above. That translates to English as &quot;Luke&quot;, which alone would have been enough to make Lucasfilm&#x27;s lawyers foam at the mouth. Reading through the blurb is a little tougher for me, but per a confirmed A.I, translation from NMH super fan Travis Dies Every Day, the full text reads:
&quot;Modern Jedi Master &#x27;Luke&#x27;. Danshiya &#x27;Luke&#x27;. His real name is Travis Touchdown. A geek and a thug of the hitman business, I will take on any boring killing. There is no creed at all. I go to the mall four times a week. In other words, if you don&#x27;t have work, you don&#x27;t have time, and you don&#x27;t have friends.&quot;
&quot;He runs danshi [boy?] with homemade sabers. All [of] his weapons, Naomi is making. He is currently ranked 11th in the UAA rankings. Fanatical fan of Japanese anime, especially the witch system is a favorite. Now I love it. I love T-shirts.&quot;

Anyone who&#x27;s played the series knows that this isn&#x27;t too far from how the actual in-game dialogue might sound. Other than the gun in his left hand, and the overt announcement that Travis is, in-fact, a Jedi named after Luke Skywalker, all of this could, plausibly, have been official!
And wait a minute, wasn&#x27;t SUDA51&#x27;s company rumored to be working on an Aliens game? That franchise is just one degree of legal separation from Star Wars! Maybe gun-toting Travis with this Skywalking nickname still has a chance of making it.

FIFA, Call of Duty, yet another rerelease of Skyrim — there are plenty of games out there that get new versions like clockwork, making them some of the staples of the gaming industry. One series with less sex appeal, but certainly a dedicated cult following, is Microsoft&#x27;s Flight Simulator. While these games&#x27; releases are somewhat quiet in the grand scheme of the gaming industry, the first entry in the series was released all the way back in 1982, and there have been a total of fifteen Flight Simulator titles since. That has to make it one of the longest-running game series ever.
The most recent Flight Simulator came out in 2020, and was met with nearly unanimously glowing reviews. It even claimed the spot as the third best game of…</span>

                              <span>Another Nasu story is now widely available
One of Type-Moon&#x27;s visual novels gets its wider release today. Witch on the Holy Night is now digitally available on Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4.
This is an update of the original 2012 PC release, which was only released in Japan. This new version is available worldwide today, with remastered visuals and animated graphic elements too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;KVmyDtQ9Pr0
The story of Witch on the Holy Night follows Soujyuro Sizuki, a young student who finds himself wrapped up in the lives of two witches. Set in the late 1980s, it still looks to have a lot of the magic and deep lore you&#x27;d be looking for in a Type-Moon story.
You can find the new version of Witch on the Holy Night on the Nintendo eShop here, or on the PlayStation Store …</span>

If the Blue Shell is the bane of your existence, then your world is about to get a little more chaotic, as Nintendo has released a brand new update for its long-life racer Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, which allows players to customize the exact items received when driving over item boxes!
The &quot;Custom Item&quot; feature allows players to pick and choose from the list of buffs, debuffs, and weapons available from Mario Kart 8 Deluxe&#x27;s iconic arsenal. So you can receive a Red Shell every time, or you could ban Red Shells entirely. Not enough Banana Skins? Give them to EVERYBODY! Or, if you want to put your karting skills to the ultimate test, turn off items entirely, and may the best Power Slider win.

Of course, this new feature is not available in all modes, so don&#x27;t expect to jump into Online Vs. with a fistful of Lightning Bolts. But, for offline multiplayer races, battle modes, and the like, you and your fellow racers can now choose exactly which items will or will not appear on your next run around Rainbow Road. The Custom Item feature sounds pretty neat and I kinda wish it had been utilized in every single Mario Kart release.
In addition to the new feature, today&#x27;s update sees the arrival of Booster Course Pass Wave 3. As previously noted, this particular round of DLC includes eight classic tracks rolling out across two cups. For a full list of the newly featured raceways, check out our previous report or the trailer above. 2023 will see the arrival of three further Booster Course packs, ultimately building to a grand total of almost 50 additional courses.
Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is available now on Nintendo Switch.

When the news dropped that Chris Pratt was gonna voice Mario in the upcoming animation The Super Mario Bros. Movie, the reaction was mixed at best. The wave of skepticism only grew with the new trailer and players heard more of Pratt&#x27;s work as everyone&#x27;s favorite plumber.
Now many fans are pondering who else could have taken on the role of Mario, and I&#x27;ve taken it upon myself to put together a shortlist of actors who would likely have done a better job in terms of capturing the character&#x27;s essence. I know that sounds kinda snobbish, especially for a character in a children&#x27;s movie, but I&#x27;ve never let my own pretention stop me in the past.

The Halo Infinite December update is out now, and 343 Industries has added quite a bit. Alongside some shifts to cosmetics and the return of a map, Halo Infinite now also has a custom game browser.
The latest update allows players to flip through available custom games, looking for one they might want to hop into and play. The Halo Infinite browser has filters for different options, including the base map and mode being used.
And as the trailer advertises, there are already some solid custom game creations out there. They range from recreations to some pretty neat ideas like Paintball, and the browser should hopefully make them easier to find.

Falling back into The Pit
Some other additions arrive in the December Update, too. All armor cores and cadet coatings are now free. And Halo 3&#x27;s The Pit returns as Empyrean, which is less fun as a name in my opinion, but still looks like the same ol&#x27; Pit I&#x27;ve played plenty of matches on.
The custom game browser is really the major addition here though, as it really builds out the Forge component of Halo Infinite. Forge hit beta in November, and now discoverability for those modes is that much easier.

I frequently get very nostalgic about the days of custom game browsing. Whether it was Halo or something like Warcraft, the server browser was a place where I discovered a lot of cool, fun, inventive ways to reimagine a game I enjoy.
Hopefully, this custom game browser gives Halo Infinite a good boost headed into the new year. With the Forge filling out and network campaign co-op finally in, Halo Infinite may start to look more like some fans hoped it would.

Sonic Prime is a seven-part animated series that sees The Blue Blur and his nemesis, Dr. Robotnik Eggman, thrust into a multiverse scenario following the activation of the mythical artifact — The Paradox Prism. As the series progresses, Sonic will visit a variety of different time zones and locales, meeting alternate versions of his friends and enemies including Rogue, Knuckles, Amy Rose, Tails, and no less than five versions of his mad nemesis. Sonic will be forced to adapt quickly to each scenario, striving to put right what once went wrong, and hoping each time that the next leap... Will be the leap home.
Sonic Prime premieres on Roblox December 10. It will officially launch on Netflix December 15.

Diablo is such a weird series: and I vibed with that feeling since the very first game. I had zero idea of what to expect, and didn&#x27;t understand the strange history of the Hellfire &quot;expansion&quot; until many years after its release. By the time Diablo 2 rolled around my little crew of Diablo-playing-friends was around 20 strong, and it was a bonafide hit that people still play today.
But Diablo 3 changed things considerably. Blizzard was already changing in terms of its perception as a bulletproof company, and the Auction House debacle was a sign of trouble to come for the publisher. In the end, D3 sold very well, but the team had a lot to prove when they first announced Diablo 4 to the world. So far, based on some hands-on time with the game, I think the…</span>

Head of Xbox Phil Spencer has said that Microsoft is looking to bring the Call of Duty franchise back to Nintendo platforms, should the industry giant&#x27;s pending purchase of publisher Activision Blizzard find approval.
Speaking in a very brief statement on Twitter, Spencer said that Microsoft had already provisionally entered into a &quot;10-year commitment&quot; to see that the billion-dollar military franchise makes its grand return on Switch and future platforms. The last Call of Duty to see release on a Nintendo platform was Call of Duty: Ghost, which launched on Nintendo WiiU way back in 2013.

As we have previously reported, Call of Duty remains both the Golden Goose and the ultimate lynchpin in Microsoft&#x27;s efforts to close out its $68.7 billion purchase of Activision Blizzard — an industry-shaking maneuver that was announced one year ago, but is yet to find global approval from a variety of trading standards bodies. Both The European Trade Commission and U.S. FTC regulators are still to confirm the findings of their respective antitrust regulations, though some territories — such as Brazil and Saudi Arabia — have already offered their unconditional approval.
Meanwhile, Sony continues in its efforts to put a halt to the deal, which appears almost entirely based on the concern of losing the Call of Duty franchise on PlayStation platforms. Global news outlet Reuters has suggested that Microsoft might be forced to make a commitment concession to Sony in order to secure global approval and move forward with the purchase.
The regulatory bodies must come to a final decision on the sale in the first quarter of 2023.

Yuji Naka, Sega veteran and co-creator of the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise, has reportedly been arrested for the second time as the result of an investigation into insider trading at publisher Square Enix. According to Japanese news outlet Asahi, (reported by VGC), the new arrest is in connection with additional instances of stock manipulation performed during Naka&#x27;s time with the publisher.
In this case, Naka, alongside fellow former Square Enix employee Taisuke Sazaki, is suspected of investing in Japanese developer ATeam Entertainment, ahead of the announcement that said studio would be working on 2021 mobile release Final Fantasy VII: The First Soldier. Naka is accused of purchasing 120,000 shares in ATeam at a cost of around ¥144.7…</span>

As far as beautiful, artistic indies games go, Gris has to be up there as one of the greats. It&#x27;s got an elegant, watercolor-esque art style, and what the gameplay lacks in hardcore, traditional mechanics it makes up for in emotionally resonant, albeit vague, storytelling vignettes -- just how I like it. To boot, the game actually has some nice platforming sections, which absolutely gave me trouble as someone who is horrible at platformers. Gris certainly isn&#x27;t a game everyone will enjoy, but I do think it&#x27;s a game everyone should at least try. If you haven&#x27;t played it yet, now you won&#x27;t have any excuse, because Gris is finally getting ported to the PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Xbox One on December 13.
https://twitter.com/devolverdigital/status/1600173231360466945
The game follows the titular character Gris, a &quot;hopeful young girl lost in her own world, dealing with a painful experience in her life. Her journey through sorrow is manifested in her dress, which grants new abilities to better navigate her faded reality.&quot; The Steam description also bills Gris as a game &quot;free of danger, frustration or death,&quot; which is true in terms of it not having a fail state, but I have to admit that the aforementioned platforming sections did frustrate me a bit. That&#x27;s more of a me problem, though.
Gris ended up winning a ton of well-deserved awards back in 2019 after its release, including Best Visual Art at the Game Developers Choice Awards and Games for Impact at the Game Awards. It&#x27;s a short game, too, so you could finish it in an afternoon if you wanted to. Personally, I played on the Switch, and it made for a great lazing-on-the-couch-during-a-rainy-day game. I&#x27;ll have no problems at all running on the most recent gen consoles, and I&#x27;ll be interested to see if they use the DualSense to add some extra haptics to enhance the experience.

Welcome back! It’s another Tuesday, which means tonight there will be a new episode of the Spot Dodge Podcast exclusively on Destructoid. Topics: Geoff Keighley&#x27;s Game Awards event is right around the corner. So I thought it&#x27;d be fun for everyone to bring their predictions for the show to the table. Along with that, we dive into what we&#x27;re playing!

Geoff Keighley confirmed that The Game Awards will be significantly shorter this year due to feedback from previous years. While I&#x27;ve always enjoyed watching The Game Awards, it&#x27;s no secret that the show was excruciatingly padded in length to filter in dozens of advertisements. It&#x27;s great to see the TGAs may be pivoting away from that and offering a more str…</span>

                              <span>Earlier this year, I flew to Los Angeles to learn about the making of Mina The Hollower, Yacht Club Games’ new Game Boy Color-inspired follow-up to its wildly popular series, Shovel Knight. But Mina The Hollower was never meant to be the studio’s next game. It was a side project of Yacht Club Games designer Alec Faulkner - one that no one but him knew existed.
After raising over $1.2M on Kickstarter in February, I wanted to learn more about Alec’s journey from intern to game director, how he pitched his “Gothic Prototype” to the Yacht Club, and ultimately, how the team rallied behind him in hopes of delivering another series as prolific as Shovel Knight. The result is a 36-minute documentary covering the making of Mina The Hollower, which you can watch below.

Final Fantasy VII is experiencing a strange identity shift. The ongoing remake is changing the original canon in bold ways while spin-offs like the 2006 PlayStation 2 game Dirge of Cerberus are being folded in for larger roles in the main story. And then there are new spin-offs, like First Soldier, the online mobile battle royale shutting down early next year, and also plans for another remake called Ever Crisis, a mobile game that will reexamine Final Fantasy VII’s timeline. With all that swirling …</span>

                              <span>Update, 12/7/2022: Balan Wonderworld director Yuji Naka has been re-arrested on a second charge of insider trading, this time involving the mobile battle royale title Final Fantasy VII: The First Soldier. 
Last month, Naka and former Square Enix employee Taisuke Sazaki were arrested on suspicion of buying shares in developer Aiming after learning in advance about the team’s announcement of its mobile game Dragon Quest Tact (see the full original story below). Japanese outlet Asashi (thanks Video Games Chronicle) now reports that Naka and Sazaki are believed to have tried a similar scheme for the reveal of Final Fantasy VII: The First Soldier.
Ashai notes that in February 2021, developer Ateam and Square Enix announced a partnership to develop the mobile battle royale title. Naka and Sazaki…</span>

Xbox head Phil Spencer has repeatedly promised that the juggernaut franchise will still appear on its main rival’s platforms, but that hasn’t stopped Sony from touting the loss of the series as anti-competitive to stop the deal from going through. After saying he had no problem keeping Call of Duty on Sony hardware for the long term, Spencer has now extended and formalized that promise to Nintendo and Valve. 
Last night, Spencer announced on Twitter that Microsoft has entered a 10-year commitment to bring Call of Duty back to Nintendo. In a follow-up tweet, Spencer states the series will remain on Steam …</span>

The action has the ultimate goal of blocking access to a quartet of file-hosting platforms - Fembed, Uqload, Upvid, &amp; Uvideo. This is the first attempt to have so-called cyberlockers blocked in France but if successful, could undermine operations at dozens of other sites.

There is only one piece of written narrative in Minecraft. It happens right at the end, after you&#x27;ve beaten the Ender Dragon. It is about 8 minutes long — almost as long as the entirety of the world record speedrun of the game — and it consists of a scrolling text poem written by an artist named Julian Gough.
Gough got the gig by replying to a tweet put out in 2011 by Minecraft creator Markus Persson: &quot;Are YOU a talented writer (famous is a plus ;D) who wants to write a silly over-the-top out-of-nowhere text for when you win Minecraft?&quot; Gough&#x27;s friends and fans put him forward, and the rest is history.

                              <span>This is more like it!
Nintendo is back with another wave of eight courses for the Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Booster Course Pass, bringing us to the halfway point of its overall road map. Now we&#x27;re up to a total of 24 new tracks over six unique cups, but so far, the output has been a bit mixed: we’ve had some bonafide classics like Coconut Mall and Mushroom Gorge, but also some absolute stinkers like New York Minute and Tokyo Blur. So how does the latest wave compare? Well thankfully, there’s a lot here to like and fewer bad eggs in the mix, making this comfortably the strongest batch of new courses yet.
Starting off with Rock Cup, we’ve got London Loop, Boo Lake, Alpine Pass, and Maple Treeway. Things get off to a bit of a rough start, as London Loop is easily the weakest track of the whole bunch; this might come as little surprise given that it’s based on Mario Kart Tour and lacks the verticality and creativity seen in other games, but there’s no doubting that London Loop is an exceptionally dull start to Rock Cup. Conversely, the latter three courses are all remarkably fun in their own way, from Boo Lake’s deceptive simplicity to Maple Treeway’s meandering track and stomping Wigglers. It’s great fun and incredibly nostalgic if you’ve played the original games on which the tracks come from.

                              <span>Sparks of inspiration.
Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope came out a little over a month ago now and was instantly met by high praise indeed (scoring 8/10 in our review). If the first game in the series is anything to go by, then we can see this sequel being something of a sleeper hit thanks to some nice eShop discounts in the coming years. If, however, the urge to get involved hasn&#x27;t gone away in the past month (despite a pretty intimidating looking battle system) then Nintendo&#x27;s newest video guide has your back.
Similar to what the company set out to do with its Splatoon 3 tutorial video back in August, here Nintendo breaks down everything that you will need to know about Sparks of Hope before purchasing. This includes a whistle-stop tour of the movement mechanics, weapon types, Spark abilities and enemy attacks. Revision starts now, we guess.

                              <span>Hyrule Historia reckons so!
The Zelda franchise has seen its central hero take on many different forms. There&#x27;s the sideburns and long-johns of The Adventure of Link, the long body and pointed features of Ocarina of Time, the eyeliner and fringe of Twilight Princess (&#x27;it&#x27;s not just a phase Muuuum&#x27;) and then shaggy wild explorer of Breath of the Wild.
And yet, no style is as easily recognisable as the Link that we see in Wind Waker, The Minish Cap, Phantom Hourglass and Spirit Tracks. The weirdly off head-to-body ratio, the bright colours, the bulbous eyes, this style has created a character all of its own (at least, Smash Bros. and amiibo would say so). We know this little guy simply as &#x27;Toon Link&#x27; and we imagine that most of you would think the same. After all, you want to play in this style on Smash Bros. Ultimate? You choose Toon Link. You buy the amiibo? It quite literally says Toon Link on the box. But what if that&#x27;s not his official name?

News on the Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake has been sparse since its announcement in May 2021, but series creator Yuji Horii has hinted in an interview with Famitsu (with excerpts translated by SatsumaFS for Nintendo Everything) that we might not have to wait much longer for some info.
The video game veteran was talking to Famitsu about his collaboration with a famous toy designer in Japan, which involved Horii talking about many aspects of the Dragon Quest series and his childhood with the publication. And eventually, Horii was asked about the future of the series — and both Dragon Quest III HD-2D and Dragon Quest XII came up.

After Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration, Atari Flashback Classics and Atari Mania, you might think that the iconic studio would want a break from looking into its back catalogue for a brief moment. You would, however, be wrong.
Perhaps the most obscure of these titles yet has today been announced, as the studio shared the news that it will be bringing the ultra rare arcade wave shooter Akka Arrh to the Switch with help from legendary games developer Jeff Minter.

We were excited to hear that the long-awaited retro platformer Clive &#x27;N&#x27; Wrench would be finally hopping its way to Switch in Europe in February 2023, and we are now pleased to hear that our friends across the pond will be able to experience all of it&#x27;s 90s-inspired goodness in physical form on the same day.
The game has been in development for a while now. Beginning back in the days of the Wii U, it is fair to say that the 12 years of waiting has been a long one. Fortunately, Numskull is here to confirm that all is still well in the world, and it has even shared a new festive-themed peek at the game in the above trailer - because every platformer needs an ice level!

There was a time when we thought that Temtem would have the chance to grow in Pokémon&#x27;s shadow and become another strong creature catcher/battler on the video game market. But then, well, it didn&#x27;t. While we gave the game 8/10 in our review, many appear to have been put off by bugs and other launch issues, leaving the game to somewhat fall off the radar.
Now, the team at Crema have been working hard to solve these problems, releasing a huge update of fixes and freebies to bring people back around (thanks, Nintendo Everything). The following update is the amalgamation of ver.1.1 and 1.2 after the studio announced in a blog post that the fixes were taking longer than expected.

Lioncode Games has announced that its tactical turn-based roguelite Mech Armada will be dropping onto Switch tomorrow (8th December).
Billed as &quot;Into the Breach meets X-Com&quot;, by way of a little Transformers we might add, this tactics game will see you building extravagently bulky mechs and then sending them into battle against an even bulkier humanity-threatening race called Swarm. The parts for these mechs look to be coming thick and fast, so whether you want to build a lean mean alien-fighting machine or the most hilariously impractical battlefield abomination, the choice is yours. Hey, you do you!

Still waiting on River City Girls 2? Aren&#x27;t we all? Still, if you&#x27;re a Nintendo Switch owner and need a little bit of schoolgal sluggin&#x27; to tide you over, then you&#x27;re in luck, as WayForward&#x27;s cartoonish brawler is now available to play for &quot;free&quot; as part of the Nintendo Switch Online Game Trial service.
From today until December 12, all Nintendo Switch Online subscribers can download and play the 2019 scrapper in its entirety, guiding Kyoko and Misako through the avenues and alleyways of River City on a mission to discover the truth behind the disappearance of boyfriends Kunio and Riki. Should you decide to bag the full game for yourself, then RCG is currently available on the eShop for a discounted price for the duration of the trial.
As for River City Girls 2, well, Japan already has the long-awaited sequel, though seemingly not in its complete and fully featured form. WayForward announced earlier today that the western release will be blessing us on December 15. That&#x27;s next week! So while the fist-throwing sequel might be hitting these shores a little later than expected, at least we can expect to receive the title as nature intended — complete with its roster of cool characters and its wild &#x27;n&#x27; chaotic four-player mode.
River City Girls 2 launches December 15 on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch. Be sure to check out our previous write-ups on both River City Girls and River City Girls Zero, as well as our interviews with director Adam Tierney, and awesome composer Megan McDuffee.

                              <span>Layoffs will happen at the studio as well
Mobile augmented reality (AR) game The Witcher: Monster Slayer is closing its doors next year. Developer Spokko is shutting down, with services fully ending next June.
The studio plans to gradually shutter its services over the coming months, as detailed in a new FAQ. The Witcher: Monster Slayer will first be taken down from the Google Play and Apple App Store on January 31, 2023, and all in-game purchases will be turned off at this time too.
Spokko also plans no more new content after the 31st as well. Players will still be able to play and exchange in-game currencies for items up until Monster Slayer&#x27;s closure. Then, on June 30, 2023, the servers will be shut down.
The team also made a statement, thanking fans for sharing in the Monster Slayer journey.
&quot;We are proud that we were able to create a location-based AR experience that captured what it was like to be a witcher in real life and gave the community a chance to battle Witcher-world monsters up close and in person,&quot; the statement reads. &quot;This is what made The Witcher: Monster Slayer such a unique experience in The Witcher franchise.&quot;
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;lhtWqIFydfo
Something ends, something begins
According to Spokko&#x27;s statement, Monster Slayer did not reach its business expectations. Spokko will be rolled into CD Projekt Red, with part of its staff given the chance to join core CD Projket Red projects. However, there will be some staff let go.
While Monster Slayer was a bit strange, as a Pokemon GO approach to the world of The Witcher, it&#x27;s still a shame to see the project&#x27;s closure result in departures. CD Projekt seems to be broadly shifting its focus towards other areas, resulting in the winding down of several of its spinoff titles.

                              <span>Big changes are ahead
Like any live service game, Overwatch needs constant maintenance — not only to add new content, but to just fix all the stuff they have in there already. When the whole point of the game is to have a bunch of overpowered heroes fighting it out, it&#x27;s easy for certain characters to get a little too overpowered in the process.
Players are looking forward to seeing some new maps and the rebalancing of heroes like Sojourn and Bastion, and of course, the real star of the show this time around is the new Tank hero, Ramattra. There&#x27;s a whole lot of new info in this huge start-of-season patch, so let&#x27;s see if we can&#x27;t simplify and find the most important bits.

A new hero

                              <span>The girls are back in town
River City&#x27;s brawlers are back in action next week. River City Girls 2 has locked in a North American and European launch date of December 15.
The latest beat &#x27;em up from WayForward is set to arrive digitally on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC via Steam.
The sequel to 2019&#x27;s River City Girls still follows Misako and Kyoko, as well as their boyfriends Kunio and Riki. Newcomers Marian (of Double Dragon fame) and Provie (from River City Ransom: Underground) also join the cast, rounding it out to six playable characters. And they&#x27;ll need all that extra help to take on the Sanwakai syndicate that&#x27;s turning River City upside down.
River City Girls 2 has already launched in Japan and Asia, but the western version saw a bit of a delay. Thankfully, it hasn&#x27;t taken too long for the brawler to get a launch date here.

Heading on down to River City
In River City Girls 2, players can take on up to four-player co-op with more characters, moves, enemies, and a larger world to explore. A big appeal of River City Girls 2 is online play. While the original River City Girls only had co-op in local play, the sequel will let players brawl through the levels together over the internet. That will doubtless make those hang-outs a little easier to organize.
WayForward is also teasing a nonlinear world and more RPG-like character growth for the brawlers. All that, alongside some serious vocal talent and a new OST from Megan McDuffee, seems like a major draw for River City Girls 2.
Me? I&#x27;m just ready to crack knuckles and bust heads in the streets of River City again. River City Girls 2 seems well-set to deliver just that.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve got a bad feeling about this
Why don&#x27;t Jedi use guns? Obi-Wan Kenobi would tell you it&#x27;s because they&#x27;re too uncivilized. Some very smart media critics would tell you it has something to do with the symbolic importance of the saber in the Campbellian Hero&#x27;s Journey. A business analyst might tell you that $200 lightsabers sell too well at Disneyland. I have a different theory, though. I think the Jedi leave their blasters at home because sword fighting is just a lot cooler.
Now, evidence is mounting that in the sequel to Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, Cal Kestis will brandish a blaster. I want to be clear that this hasn&#x27;t been confirmed by EA or Respawn Entertainment - Cal has a blaster in an action figure, and a leaked preorder bonus for the game includes blaster cosmetics.

                              <span>It’s dangerous to have Zelda opinions. Here, take mine!
You can learn a lot about someone by asking what their favorite The Legend of Zelda game is.
It’s a series so vast and so popular that anyone who plays video games has some opinion of it. You have the people who got into video games because they played Ocarina of Time as a kid. You also have the people who say Zelda has never been good since it went 3D. Even the games someone didn’t play can be revealing. For example, I considered whether or not I was qualified to write this list because I never touched The Minish Cap or A Link Between Worlds. Hey, don’t look at me, I skipped the 3DS game because someone gave it a 6.5.
In other words, an objective ranking of Zelda games is impossible. Yet by the same token, every time someone ranks th…</span>

                              <span>Fly me to the Moonspell
Indie hit Vampire Survivors is getting its first big piece of DLC. Legacy of the Moonspell is a new Vampire Survivors DLC arriving next week on December 15.
The new content will be coming to both PC via Steam and Xbox on the 15th, and will run $1.99 USD. The Steam page is live now, with a host of info on what&#x27;s to come in the Legacy of the Moonspell next week.

What&#x27;s in store for the Survivors? Well, the Legacy takes the action to a new map in the eastern lands, known as Mt. Moonspell. This locale is developer poncle&#x27;s biggest stage yet, featuring several different environments include snowy mountains, a yokai-infested village, and yes, an abandoned castle.
Eight new characters join the fray, with four getting shown off today. 13 new weapons are also i nstore, including a set of season-shifting orbs and an ancestral force unleashed by a staff. Seems like a good way to blast a bunch of enemies away for experience.
Additionally, there are some hidden mysteries and more in store. Between the characters and weapons that poncle isn&#x27;t revealing yet, it seems like there is a fair bit to discover in this new drop.
I will survive
It seems like just yesterday that Vampire Survivors was a surprise hit trending up Steam&#x27;s charts. Now, poncle&#x27;s horde survival game is dominating Steam charts and commandeering Steam Decks. Heck, it has a Game Awards nomination.
While its star is on the rise, it&#x27;s nice to see the Vampire Survivors crew keeping it going. Even the DLC itself is quite reasonably priced. It&#x27;ll be nice to have some more crowds to blast through for crystals during the holidays.
Vampire Survivors&#x27; Legacy of the Moonspell DLC arrives for PC and Xbox on December 15, 2022.

                              <span>&#x27;Gwenfinity&#x27; to see players take control of meta
CD Projekt RED has announced that it plans to start sunsetting Gwent — the spin-off card game from mega-popular RPG franchise The Witcher — in 2023. As of 2024, no further cards will be produced for the digital tabletop title, with a total of three expansions planned before the deck closes for good.
&quot;We are not planning to release new cards starting from 2024, so the cards which will release in 2023 basically will be the last brand-new ones that we will be adding to the game,&quot; revealed Gwent director Vladimir Tortsov in a developer video. &quot;It&#x27;s a pretty significant change, there&#x27;s no way around it.

&quot;With the cards that we are planning to add to the game next year, we are basically planning to close the card pool with every idea that we wanted to add, every mechanic that we wanted to see, pretty much everything that we would like to see in Gwent, we will try to fit it within the year.&quot;

This does not, however, mean that Gwent will become a dead, non-playable entity. In a motion known to the studio as &quot;Gwenfinity&quot;, a skeleton crew will be assigned to routinely keep one eye on the game&#x27;s infrastructure, while the players themselves will be offered the opportunity to decide upon rule changes and balance tweaks as the Gwent meta continues, post-support.
With this new system, CDPR hopes that the Gwent community will be able to continue enjoying, and even evolving, the fantasy tabletop title. And so, while support will officially end in 2024, there will hopefully still be many, many years of coin-tossing over tavern tables still to come.

Today sees the launch of the second season of Activision Blizzard&#x27;s arena shooter, Overwatch 2 — And in something of a minor reshuffle, the development team has announced that it will be moving its newest hero, Ramattra, to Tier 45 on the season 2 battle pass, from his initial sitting of Tier 55.
&quot;Hey all! Quick update on some changes coming to Season 2,&quot; wrote OW2 director Aaron Miller on Twitter. &quot;After reviewing data for Season 1, we&#x27;re moving Ramattra [to] Tier 45 of the Battle Pass and making a few more weekly challenges easier to complete. Excited for you all to see everything new in Season 2 starting tomorrow!&quot;

Originally, Overwatch heroes were simply added to all players&#x27; rosters as they were released. But with the arrival of Overwatch 2 and its free-to-play structure, the new heroes now reside within the debuting, (and hugely divisive), battle pass system. By moving the new heroes to Tier 45, it is hoped that players will unlock the characters faster, though it is, admittedly, still a pretty meaty grind to get there.
The addition of the battle pass mechanic has been met with much grumbling from the Overwatch faithful. A common complaint, (echoed by this writer), is that it is simply a dull and excitement-free way to unlock goodies, and pales in comparison to the box of goodies players would receive for popping a new level. Of course, loot boxes come with their own highly negative ramifications, but, personally, I&#x27;ll take the loot box animation and fistful of varied treats over grinding through endless drab avatar images... while paying for the privilege.
Overwatch 2 season 2 kicks off today on all platforms. You can check out our hands-on look at its newest hero, Ramattra, in our previous report.

There has been a lot of good Godzilla news as of late, no matter which version of the big green monster you prefer. Apple TV+ is developing a Godzilla and the Titans streaming series, the Godzilla vs. Kong sequel wrapped up production last month, and Toho confirmed it&#x27;s working on a new film set to release in 2023. Unfortunately, we&#x27;re going to have to wait months, even years, to see what comes of those projects. Arriving far sooner than any of those is the big collaboration between the monster brawler GigaBash and the Godzilla universe. After weeks of speculation, we finally know what&#x27;s coming as part of this DLC update, and it&#x27;s a good bunch of kaiju.
Starting tomorrow, GigaBash owners will be able to download the Godzilla 4 Kaiju DLC pack and get immediate access to Giga…</span>

A nice surprise this morning for Elden Ring fans, as developer FromSoftware has announced that the acclaimed fantasy RPG will be receiving a free update on all platforms tomorrow, December 7, bringing with it the long-rumored opening of The Lands Between&#x27;s many mysterious colosseums.
Having stood foreboding over the battlefields since the title&#x27;s launch back in February of this year, the colosseums of Limgrave, Leyndell, and Caelid will finally raise the portcullis and allow the mightiest of Elden Ring warriors the opportunity to test their mettle within the ancient, battle-worn walls of the granite ring.
According to the blurb accompanying the new trailer, (which you can check out below), the colosseums will see Elden Ring players waging war in &quot;duels, free-for-alls, and team fights&quot;, putting all of their sword &amp; sorcery abilities to the ultimate test. You might have proven your worth against Malenia,Blade of Miquella, but verily, how do you fare against xBarryBlazes420x?
Elden Ring is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

                              <span>From Funkotron to Hollywood
In a pretty surprising announcement that I don&#x27;t think anybody saw coming, Amazon Studios has announced that it has begun pre-production on a new feature film adaptation of the classic Sega Mega Drive adventure ToeJam &amp; Earl — The new movie was announced yesterday in The Hollywood Reporter.
The new film is being produced by Unanimous Media — the studio founded by Stephen Curry — with a screenplay penned by Amos Vernon and Nunzio Randazzo, who have worked on the Hotel Transylvania franchise, as well as the upcoming Disney+ series, Superfudge. The movie will be co-produced by Story Kitchen, headed up by John Wick scribe Derek Kolstad and Sonic the Hedgehog producer Dmitri Johnson.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;RQlK-jTIiwU
ToeJam &amp; Earl, created by Mark Voorsanger and Greg Johnson, hit the 16-bit market in 1991 and concerns the esoteric adventures of two hep-cat space aliens, who become marooned on Earth after their spaceship crashlands on our horrible little planet. From there, the two tripped-out protagonists must gather together the remnants of their ship, while avoiding delightfully satirical characters that symbolize the bizarre nature of human life.
Something of a cult classic, ToeJam &amp; Earl would be followed by two sequels: 1993&#x27;s Panic of Funkotron and 2002&#x27;s Mission to Earth. More recently, 2019 saw the release of crowdfunded title Back in the Groove, which returned the franchise to its split-screen, 3/4 perspective mechanics. While TJ &amp; E have been a part of gaming for many decades, the franchise is tightly held, with most of the games merely &quot;good&quot; at best. As such it seems an odd choice for a modern movie adaptation. However, the colorful universe and way-out characters and situations should make for some pretty twisted entertainment.
The untitled ToeJam &amp; Earl movie is currently in pre-production at Amazon Studios.

                              <span>And I say give it to him
David Harbour is one of my favorite actors right now. He was one of my favorite characters in Stranger Things, and after seeing him in his new Christmas-y comedy action flick Violent Night this past weekend, he cemented his place as one of my favorite actors working today, period. He can do it all -- drama, comedy, and most importantly, the surrogate father trope that been so hot in games the past console generation. Based on his serious nerd cred alone, I&#x27;m surprised Harbour&#x27;s only games credit will be an upcoming horror game along with Jodie Comer, star of the spy thriller series Killing Eve.
There&#x27;s a chance that all might change, however, because in an interview with Video Games FN, David Harbour shared another game series he dreams of working on: God of War. “I really like what those guys in the God of War universe are doing with my buddy Richard Schiff as Odin,&quot; he said. &quot;They sort of mess around with that genre too, and they&#x27;re always surprising in terms of these gods and they wind up becoming--Thor is a big old jerk and Odin being this kind of older intellectual. I&#x27;d be interested in possibly doing some of that.”

Well Mr. Harbour, we would also be interested in you doing some of that. After a series of action-packed roles, he&#x27;s proved he&#x27;d be a perfect fit in both stature and demeanor. Now I&#x27;m not advocating for any form on nepotism, but if Richard Schiff is already a friend on the inside, he might be able to get Harbour an audition, at the very least, for any new roles that might arise in the next God of War game.
Seeing as God of War Ragnarok just came out a few weeks ago, we don&#x27;t have so much as an announcement that another GoW game is in the works, but I&#x27;d bet my money plans have already been lined up for some time now. Now if they can only get David Harbour involved, I might finally be persuaded to give the series a second try...

                              <span>Nobody cares that much about the Game Awards
The Game Awards are nearly here again, and gamers everywhere have taken up the annual tradition of pretending the Game Awards are important. All across my Twitter timeline, I&#x27;ve come across the same old takes, from people lamenting the biggest snubs of the year to people furiously debating the Game of the Year while conveniently ignoring 2/3 of the nominees. At the heart of it all, though, I see the truth: nobody really cares about this stuff.
The Game Awards are not prestigious. Nobody actually cares about the winner of any category for more than an hour after the ceremony airs. Even Game of the Year, ostensibly the biggest award in all of video games, as far as I can tell, just doesn&#x27;t matter all that much. Last year&#x27;s GotY winner, It Takes Tw…</span>

                              <span>Normally when we see discounted SSDs, it&#x27;s often on the cheapest models with loads of storage but the cheapest type of NAND flash, QLC, and with no DRAM caches. 
The Kioxia Exceria is one of those discounted SSDs, dropping to £55, but it&#x27;s actually a fairly high-end SSD with TLC NAND and a DRAM cache. This ensures that performance remains high even in scenarios where you&#x27;re writing data fairly continuously.

Bay 12 Games&#x27;s hugely ambitious colony sim, which is notionally a game about building a fortress for small, bearded humanoids, but is really an engine for generating elaborate fantasy histories and player-driven stories within them, has been in active development since 2003, with an initial launch in 2006. Since then, it has been continually developed by brothers Tarn and Zach Adams, who have added a truly wild amount of stuff over the last two decades. It&#x27;s also famously as impenetrable as its title suggests, mainly due to its ASCII visuals and unwieldy, keyboard-exclusive control scheme.

The effort by ZeniMax workers comes in collaboration with CODE-CWA, the same organisation which assisted in the creation of the recently formed Activision Blizzard unions.

                              <span>UK publisher Rebellion is currently celebrating its 30th anniversary. As part of that, the company is giving away one of its most notable games – Aliens versus Predator Classic 2000. This is the updated version of Rebellion&#x27;s best stab at AvP, which originally released in 1999, and was published by Fox Interactive.
You can grab the game by heading over to Rebellion&#x27;s storefront, where the offer is displayed proudly on the front page. There is a minor catch. You have to sign up to Rebellion&#x27;s newsletter, after which a Steam key for the game will be sent to you.

                              <span>The Razer Viper Ultimate is a legendary ultralight mouse, offering bulletproof wireless, optical switched buttons, a convenient charging dock and a lightweight 74 gram design. That&#x27;s probably why this ultra-premium option launched at an eye-watering $149.99 when it debuted three years ago. Now though, Amazon are offering the Viper Ultimate for its lowest ever price, just $59.99, fancy charging dock included. This is an awesome deal - and I&#x27;m not just saying that because I use this mouse every day (and have done for years).

                              <span>Virtuální Bastlírna opět na scéně! Viděli jste už 20W laserovou gravírku schopnou vyvolat velice jemný plošný spoj pod minutu? Nebo novou bastldesku s ESP32, kterou jde použít pro protokoly ZigBee, Thread, BLE a další? Nebo levnou čínskou termokameru s dobrým rozlišením?

O nových fyzikálních prefixech jednotek jste už slyšeli? A co třeba kónické slicování pro tisk převisů na 3D tiskárnách bez podpor? AI, která vám umí lidsky říct, co máte špatně ve zdrojovém kódu a jak to opravit?

A co třeba simulátor nepájivého pole, RP2040 s obousměrným ethernetem včetně IPv6 nebo spektrální analyzátor do 6 GHz za 3500 Kč?

Ať už vás zaujalo cokoliv z nabízených témat, chcete ukázat nějaký svůj bastl a nebo si jen potřebujete postěžovat na nedostatek volného času, doražte! Příští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat ve středu 7. prosince od 20:00 minimálně do 22:00 (ale obvykle končí o dost později). Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.</span>

Update : After comforting fans about the upcoming River City Girls 2 release date last week, WayForward has today announced an official release date for this much-anticipated sequel — 15th December!
Confirming the news on Twitter, this follows the company&#x27;s announcement that the game would be delayed slightly. It&#x27;s only a few weeks, at least! So we won&#x27;t have to wait long to get a brand new slice of the action with the River City Girls.

Final Fantasy V is celebrating its 30th anniversary in Japan today! Geez.
Released on the Super Famicom on 6th December 1992, Final Fantasy V was a return to the Job System set-up of Final Fantasy and Final Fantasy III on the NES. It&#x27;s also sandwiched between what many consider two of the best Final Fantasy games ever — Final Fantasy IV and Final Fantasy VI — and because of its lack of an official English localisation on the SNES (fans had to wait until 1999&#x27;s PS1 rerelease), it doesn&#x27;t always get the love it deserves.

Warner Bros. Games and developer Avalanche Studios have shared a new Hogwarts Legacy video detailing the work undergone to create the upcoming game&#x27;s soundtrack.
There&#x27;s very little in the way of gameplay here (which is probably a good thing, because you can bet it won&#x27;t be representative of the Switch version), but we get a good look at how the team at Avalanche Studios has approached the music for the Wizarding World adventure title.

We&#x27;re fast approaching the launch of The Super Mario Bros. Movie on April 7th, 2023 (yes, it&#x27;ll be here before you know it!) and we&#x27;ve already seen a boatload of characters from the first two trailers, including the likes of Peach, Bowser, Donkey Kong, Funky Kong, and more.
It seems Nintendo is still keeping a few things under wraps, however, as an unannounced character has been spotted via a recent McDonald&#x27;s promotion. The news comes via Twitter user @Kikaim, who recently posted an image showing eight toys that will reportedly come with Happy Meal toys in Japan starting this month. Seven of the eight are pretty self explanatory and include Luigi, Peach, Toad, Donkey Kong, Bowser, and two versions of Mario.

                              <span>Dragon Quest Treasures is a prequel to Dragon Quest 11. It follows the exploits of Erik and his sister, Mia, well before they met up with The Luminary and follows them on their adventure to find treasure, escape vikings, and jump on top of the heads of monsters in order to reach higher platforms. Unlike Dragon Quest 11, Treasures is an action game with open environments and a focus on collecting valuables. It releases December 9 on Nintendo Switch and we will have a review for the game on gameinformer.com soon.

On June 27, 1972, Atari, as we know it today, was born. Well, technically, it was born a few months earlier under the name Syzygy Engineering, but the name Atari started life in 1972. I know this and many more interesting facts about the company because of Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration, Digital Eclipse&#x27;s love letter to the gaming giant.
Atari 50 is essentially a playable documentary, walking you through 50 years of Atari&#x27;s games, home consoles, handhelds, and PCs split into five different timelines. …</span>

                              <span>Hey Elden Ring fans, remember those colosseums you haven’t been able to enter since launch? Those doors finally open today, thanks to the arrival of a free PvP update.
Aptly dubbed Colosseum Update 1.08, the previously locked arenas in Limgrave, Caelid, and Leyndell become accessible, hosting competitive one-on-one duels, team battles, and free-for-all fights between players. It’s unclear what you’ll earn for winning other than personal glory, but it’s nice to see the fog finally lift on these mysterious locations. Check out the trailer below. 


This might be the start of a big week for Elden Ring, as it could walk away with the Game of the Year trophy during this week&#x27;s Game Awards. You can read our review of Elden Ring here.</span>

IGN first confirmed the news, with a Microsoft spokesperson telling the outlet that &quot;This price reflects the content, scale, and technical complexity of these titles.&quot; First-party Xbox Series X/S games such as Starfield, Redfall, and Forza Motorsport will be among the first titles to have the $70 price tag when they arrive next year. The price of Xbox Game Pass appears unaffected, and the Microsoft spokesperson continued by saying, “As with all games developed by our teams at Xbox, they will also be available with Game Pass the same day they launch.” 
Given the increasingly exorbitant cost of triple-A game development, the price rise was only a matter of time. In an October live interview with The Wall Street Journal, Xbox head Phil Spencer said as much when he stated that the company couldn’t keep its products at the same price forever. &quot;I do think at some point we&#x27;ll have to raise the prices on certain things, but going into this holiday we thought it was important to maintain the prices.&quot; 
Sony was the first console maker to charge $70 for its PlayStation 5 first-party offerings at the start of this generation. In August, Sony raised the price of the PS5 itself in multiple international territories, citing inflation as the primary reason; Microsoft immediately responded by saying it had “no plans to raise the price of the Xbox Series X/S consoles.” Of course, that statement was made before Spencer’s comments to the WSJ, and Microsoft declined to comment when IGN asked about the potential of a hardware price raise.
As a reminder, the $70 tag only applies to current-gen titles. PS4 and Xbox One games have and will remain $60, the former standard established during the PS3/Xbox 360 generation.

The game was originally announced in 2020 (before Pentiment) and we took a look at it earlier this year. Now, however, we had a chance to go hands-on. Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard for a look at this unique game that is surprisingly reliant on the tactical power of farts.

                              <span>The SK Hynix Gold P31 is widely considered one of the finest laptop SSDs available - because it&#x27;s not only fast, but it&#x27;s extremely power-efficient. That means it produces little waste heat, and allows your laptop to stretch its legs in terms of battery life too. It&#x27;s normally over $200 for 2TB, but for Prime members it&#x27;s now available for $146 - an almighty deal for this drive.

                              <span>It&#x27;s not everyday you see something on Twitter that makes you wonder how many beloved classics from your childhood were made using golf games. Today is one of those days, as it turns out The Lord Of The Rings: The Return of The King was built using the modified engine of an undisclosed Tiger Woods title. 
&quot;Lord Of The Rings is about large areas, then a castle at the end or a fortress - what&#x27;s like that?&quot;, asks Callisto Protocol director Glen Schofield in the video below. &quot;Tiger Woods&quot;, he answers. 

Huh.

The Pokemon-like MMO&#x27;s 1.2 update introduces Showdown, a ranked competitive ladder where players are free to twiddle with their line-up using simulated Temtems. 
The update also tweaks how PvP ranking works, adds new PvP battle zones, and a beauty centre where you can tweak your character&#x27;s appearance. There&#x27;s a new season of cosmetic doodads, too.

                              <span>Season 2 of Overwatch 2 arrives tomorrow, and it&#x27;s a bigger deal than it may sound. Overwatch 2 may have marked the beginning of a slightly jarring shift towards the free-to-play model for Blizzard&#x27;s venerable hero shooter, but it&#x27;s the release of Season 2 where players will get their first taste of the pace and quality at which future content will be released under the new regime.
I got to spend a few days exploring the new changes that Overwatch 2&#x27;s second season will bring around this time tomorrow, and I&#x27;ve come away feeling a little torn. On the one hand, the brand new additions - the new Tank, Ramattra, and the new Shambali Monastery map - are gorgeous, intriguing, and enjoyable. On the other, the balance changes to existing heroes really don&#x27;t seem to have done much to rebalance the most overpowered heroes in the game, which has left me feeling a bit frustrated.

                              <span>Sad news, card pals: CD Project Red are pulling back from Gwent, with no new cards to be added after 2023. Beyond that the servers will stay online but the devs don&#x27;t intend to release updates themselves, instead handing responsibility for balance changes over to the community via in-game tools. 
Six years of active development seems like a pretty good run, to be fair.

BioWare have now revealed a sneak peek at an early cutscene, in which chirpy dwarf Varric muses about his old companion/possible ancient Elven god Solas. He&#x27;s the big bad, you see. The Dreadwolf himself.
BioWare have also released a few bits and bobs in celebration of Dragon Age day, including posters for upcoming Netflix show Dragon Age: Absolution, which is out on Friday. I hope it doesn&#x27;t do a Dota.

A bit like Proteus meets Bernband and Alien Caseno with the added ability to make annoying noises by slamming on your lute.

                              <span>Microsoft&#x27;s proposed buyout of Activision-Blizzard is currently being scrutinized by competition regulators in various countries, but despite previous (and existing) objections the American Federal Trade Commision now looks likely to approve the deal. The news comes from the New York Post, who quote former FTC chairman William Kovacic as saying the deal is 70% likely to proceed. 
There&#x27;s a web of politics involved, but the short version is that insider sources say Microsoft have won over another member of the four person FTC panel, meaning any vote on whether to launch a lawsuit would result in an even split that would effectively OK the deal. That would reduce current FTC Chair Lina Khan&#x27;s authority over the body, so to avoid that she might just let Microsoft have at it.

The Callisto Protocol wants you to learn and experiment with its systems, but it strongly disincentivises this at the same time.

                              <span>Playing Kynseed is kind of like being allowed too much freedom at the pick-n-mix. It’s not that all the separate parts go badly together, having chocolate jazzies and cola bottles all jumbled in together is exactly what I want. The problem is that it can’t possibly live up to what you hoped for when you’re scooping treats into that weighty paper bag. There’s a surprise chalkiness in the chocolates, some of the gummies are glued together, and in your haste, you’ve nabbed two lookalike sweets and mismanaged your expectations. At a glance, it’s precisely the rainbow-coloured jumble you wanted, but often it just leaves a bad taste in your mouth.
Kynseed is an RPG, and a life sim, and a sandbox. It is also Cooking Mama, and Moonlighter, and a dungeon crawler. It is gentle vibes ASMR relax-and-watch-the-seasons-change, and also crass and knowingly subversive. It does some of these things excellently, while other parts just don’t hold up.

                              <span>Palworld, AKA “That bizarre Pokémon-ish game with guns”, has a new trailer that puts names to the many cuddly faces that star in this over-the-top adventure.
Meet the Pal, the monsters that roam Palworld’s colorful yet kind of messed up world. These cuddly though often dangerous critters include the seemingly love-obsessed Lovander, grass panda Mossanda, and Tanzee, which is basically Grookey if it possessed a love for the AK-47. Sure, some of them boldly walk the line of being outright copies of existing Pokémon, but these can carry guns, which we imagine is enough of a separation to repel any lawyers. Check out the latest trailer below. 


Palworld first gained attention in June 2021. Developer Pocketpair bills the experience as a multiplayer open-world survival game as opposed to a turn-based RPG like Pokémon. As a human character, you can capture, befriend, train, battle, and breed Pal. If you consider yourself a bigger monster than what you&#x27;re catching, you even sell, eat, and outright exploit Pal for labor. On top of that, you can build houses, battle poachers, and construct factories to put your critters to work. Palworld looks nuts, and we&#x27;re still not entirely convinced it&#x27;s a real video game, but we certainly want it to be. 
Thankfully, Pocketpair plans to release Palworld in Steam Early Access sometime next year, so we&#x27;ll hopefully get a chance to try it out sooner than later. The game is currently slated for PC.</span>

                              <span>Since its reveal in 2016, Lost Soul Aside has been one of the most promising and mysterious projects on the horizon. Today, the upcoming action game made its first peep since its last showing in 2021, showing off its frenetic combat and stylish flair. 
Lost Soul Aside began life as a solo project by developer Yang Bing. Its 2016 proof-of-concept trailer impressed many with its triple-A caliber presentation and Devil May Cry-inspired action, including Sony, who scooped up the project as a third-party PS4 exclusive. Bing is now working with a full team, Ultizero Games. Sony announced last year that Lost Soul Aside will come to PS5 as well. The adventure stars protagonist Kazar and his shapeshifting dragon companion, who transforms into various weapons for Kazar to wield. 


Despite being officially announced for years, today’s video is billed as an “announcement trailer” presumably reintroducing the game to newcomers while reminding everyone else that it still, in fact, exists. The gameplay looks as polished as it ever has, though sadly, we still have no idea when we’ll get to play it. 
Lost Soul Aside will be available on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4. Be sure also to check out our related series on video games in development hell.</span>

Following the Fracture live event on December 3rd, the Herald and her chrome army obliterated The Island, sending chunks flying in all directions across space. Then, the island began repairing itself, forming an entirely new world filled with new locations, weapons, and mechanics. Blindly jumping into an all-new map can be a bit overwhelming, so here’s a list of every change introduced in Fortnite Chapter 4.
  



      
												
A New Island
Chapter 4’s most obvious change is the new map. Mainly split between an icy mountain, an autumnal forest, and a series of farmlands, this area has loads of secrets yet to be discovered.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a sucker for strategy games which boil their mechanics down until they almost become puzzle games, particularly if they also involve building rather than war. I&#x27;m thinking of games like Concrete Jungle, Slipways, Terra Nil and now, maybe, Farlanders.

That last game may be less familiar. Farlanders is a turn-based strategy game about terraforming Mars via building placement and adjacency bonuses, and it&#x27;s due for release next month.

                              <span>There are so many games released each year that I sometimes only notice a couple of years after the fact. Unfortunately that&#x27;s sometimes long enough for a game to be unreleased again. So it is with Fuser, Harmonix&#x27;s 2020 music game in which players create new works by mashing up other people&#x27;s songs. It&#x27;s being delisted from sale later this month and its &quot;live services&quot; are being switched off.

                              <span>With Cyber Monday behind us, it is now time for Christmastime. I mean, I did watch 25 Christmas movies in November. But now it&#x27;s super Christmastime. Top movie tips so far, by the way: The Noel Diary and Christmas Under Wraps. I just wish the Hallmark Channel&#x27;s rubbish UK service had all the new American movies—it doesn&#x27;t even have 2021&#x27;s yet! Anyway, what you playing this weekend? Here&#x27;s what we&#x27;re clicking on.

                              <span>Fortnite Chapter 3 has officially come to a close. 
Chapter 3 began last December and now, we officially know Chapter 4 begins tomorrow, December 4. Like with previous chapter launches, Chapter 4 brings with it an all-new map to play on that will be filled with new locations and returning favorites. There&#x27;s a glimpse of this new map at the end of the Chapter 4 &quot;A New Beginning&quot; trailer, which you can watch below: 


Here&#x27;s another look at the Chapter 4 map: 
Elsewhere in the trailer, you can catch a glimpse of new skins that will likely be in the Season 1 battle pass such as Geralt of Rivia from The Witcher series, the Incredible Hulk, the Doom Slayer from Doom, and even YouTuber Mr. Beast. 
Before all of that, though, players got the chance to experience the Chapter 3 &quot;Fracture&quot; finale event today at 4 p.m. ET (if you missed it, unfortunately you cannot go back to play it as of now). In it, we saw the battle island essentially implode with bits and pieces of it scattered across the stars. 
Players were tasked with collecting zero point fragments scattered about a small section of this map floating in space. The more players collected, the more pieces were added to the playable area. Players could complete quests such as throwing snowballs at enemies or bouncing players off into space as beach balls. You could also complete races, match island props, and more. Everything you did rewarded you with a zero point fragment. After about 30 to 40 minutes of this, the Chapter 4 trailer began. In it, we saw what appeared to be the creation of the Chapter 4 map, with the zero point dragging in pieces from space to create it. 

Fortnite Chapter 4 officially begins tomorrow, December 4, but a start time has not yet been revealed.

                              <span>HBO has released a new trailer for The Last of Us, its upcoming TV series based on the hit Naughty Dog game of the same name. And it looks awesome (and sad...very, very sad). 
The show&#x27;s first bit of footage was released back in August and slowly, HBO has been revealing more and more about The Last of Us. We&#x27;ve seen Pedro Pascal&#x27;s Joel and Bella Ramsey&#x27;s Ellie in previous footage, but today&#x27;s trailer gives us our longest look yet at the duo. Both continue to embody the spirit of Joel and Ellie in the games well and you can watch new footage of their scenes in the newest trailer below: 


As you can see, the trailer features a lot more of Joel and Ellie, but it also gives us new looks at clickers, a bloater, and possibly even David (although it could be someone else, like one of David&#x27;s henchmen). We also see Bill and Frank, and this trailer seems to tease that we&#x27;ll be getting a lot more of their relationship in the show than we did in the game. In a blink-and-you&#x27;ll-miss-it couple of moments, we even see Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson, who voiced Joel and Ellie in the games (shout-out to SlashFilm for catching that):

                              <span>If you’ve been wanting Valve’s portable PC console, the Steam Deck, but lack the spare cash, Valve will be giving away a ton of them for free during next week’s annual broadcast of The Game Awards. All you have to do is watch The Game Awards through Valve’s streaming site. Oh, yeah: Remember when Valve launched a…

                              <span>Google have started issuing refunds for their recently canned game streaming service, Stadia. Those who&#x27;d bought any games, hardware or add-ons have already been told they&#x27;ll get their money back by January 18th, which is when the lights go out and all access to Stadia games shuts off.
The situation sucks for the Stadia team, and the numerous developers who were caught short by Google&#x27;s failure to communicate Stadia&#x27;s imminent demise. If you&#x27;ve spent the past three years mostly buying games through Stadia though then crikey, that&#x27;s a nice windfall.

                              <span>Within the joyful depths of tabletop board gaming lies a genre known as &#x27;take-that&#x27; style card games. They revolve around people pulling out cards that suddenly give them extra power or abilities, with counterplays almost entirely dependent on whether you happen to draw the right card in response. Munchkin is the king of these, at least in terms of popularity, having sent millions of players all over the world into dungeons where they competitively slay goofy horrors. 

I cannot stand it, but it is now on Steam in early access, and statistically speaking a lot of people will be very happy about that.

Hordes of people on Steam are reporting the same issues that Alice Bee did in her review, plonking Callisto&#x27;s rating into Mostly Negative. Developers Striking Distance Studios have acknowledged the issue and say they&#x27;ll drop a patch later today to fix it, but we&#x27;ll see.
They&#x27;ve also revealed their post-launch roadmap, so hopefully it&#x27;ll run well enough by February for you to enjoy the New Game+ and Hardcore modes.

                              <span>Unlike buses, Valve games do not come in threes. That isn&#x27;t about to change anytime soon, but one of the main writers behind both Portal games has revealed that they&#x27;ve got a &quot;pretty awesome&quot; idea for Portal 3. Erik Wolpaw say he and fellow Portal 2 penner Jay Pinkerton have even floated that idea around Valve, to a positive response. It&#x27;s totes on the cards, is what it sounds like.  
The news comes from Wolpaw&#x27;s recent interview with YouTuber DidYouKnowGaming, which is also worth a watch to learn about all the ideas Valve didn&#x27;t wind up using in Portal 2. At one point it had bullet time.

Fortunately, a few of the little turn based tactics games I&#x27;d had on the backburner for a while was Immortal Tactics Colon War of the Eternals, an excellent little fantasy combat game set on miniature hex grids. On paper, it&#x27;s a stock fantasy game with a himbo, edgelord, and nerd fighting to kill monsters and unlock new characters. But what does paper know?

In particular, Darktide players are miffed that the co-op action game offers bundles of its Aquila premium currency that fall just short of the cost of some items in the store, meaning you’d have to stump up for several bundles to afford those. Taking to Darktide’s Discord to ask why you can’t just buy a specific amount of Aquilas for the items you want, one player was told by a spokesperson for Fatshark that adding such a feature would be “immeasurably complex”.

                              <span>I was dismissive of my first few games of Marvel Snap, intrigued by the next few, then hooked within ten. Second Dinner&#x27;s lightning-fast CCG manages to pack a surprising amount of nuance and strategy within six turns, while cleverly leaning on that brevity to play around with ideas that wouldn&#x27;t work elsewhere. It&#x27;s neat! And free! You should try it. 
All the more so, now that the latest update has added Collector Tokens that let you buy specific cards rather than leaving you solely at the mercy of booster packs. There are also 16 new cards, nerfs to some old ones, and a smattering of other improvements.

                              <span>At the beginning of November, we announced we were going to write a bumper crop of supporter articles for the month to celebrate the launch of our new introductory offer on our monthly Standard subscriptions. Normally, these exclusive supporter articles are reserved for our Premium subscription tier, but because we wanted to give those Standard introductory folks a taste of what Premium has to offer as well, we decided to make a bunch of them visible to all subscribers.  
About a week into November, we realised that we didn&#x27;t have a very good way of flagging which of those articles Standard subscribers could actually read (our bad), and due to a combination of holidays, illness and general busy-ness, we completely failed to come up with a solution. Apologies! To remedy that, I&#x27;ve now listed all of them below. Enjoy!

It’s set in a slick-looking metropolis positioned by the sea called Rockay City, check. The Epic Games Store is involved somehow, got it. Oh, and let’s get Reservoir Dogs, Kill Bill and Free Willy 2: The Adventure Home actor Michael Madsen in to drop Geoff Keighley’s lost wallet off at The Game Awards HQ, yeah. He’s Geoff’s biggest fan after all. Excuse me? I don’t understand.

Capcom have announced that Monster Hunter Rise will hit Game Pass in January 2023, a great entry in their brill beast-bashing series. Microsoft have also detailed some more of the games coming to Game Pass before then, including Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga next week. That one might be a fun way to distract the kiddywinkles over Christmas. Read on for more future Game Pass additions.

                              <span>Sometimes when we get sent review code for a game, the PR will say that they&#x27;ll be getting PC code later, but if we want we can have a console code so we can get a head start playing the game. There are a lot of reasons that might happen, but I&#x27;ll be honest: it&#x27;s never a great sign. I&#x27;m usually pretty chillaxed about the occasional wonky animation or frame stuttering when a game runs, but in this case The Callisto Protocol runs so badly on PC that if it were my child and the coach wasn&#x27;t putting it in to play football - even as a sub in the last five minutes, you know, just to give it a go, like - I&#x27;d be saying, &quot;Yeah, bench the sucker, I get it.&quot;
The stuttering and slowing down whenever anything moves is especially problematic in a horror game where your survival depends on quickly dodge-reacting to sudden threats. So I can&#x27;t, right now, recommend you get The Callisto Protocol on PC. If Striking Distance get it running properly? Eh. Maybe.

                              <span>Earlier this year, I flew to Los Angeles to learn about the making of Mina The Hollower, Yacht Club Games’ new Game Boy Color-inspired follow-up to Shovel Knight. Following the studio’s successful Kickstarter earlier this year, Game Informer sheds light on Mina The Hollower’s origins as developer Alec Faulkner’s side project, how he pitched the game to the Yacht Club, and ultimately, how the team hopes to deliver a game as prolific as Shovel Knight.

                              <span>We’re approaching the end of 2022, and we’re concluding the year by going back to our Super Replay roots by tackling an old-school survival horror game. In this case, we’re replaying one of the greatest games of the PS1 era, Silent Hill! Join us live on Twitch each Friday at 2 p.m. Central as we endure two hours of nostalgic, hair-raising scares. If you can’t catch us live, each episode will be available to watch on Saturdays on the Game Informer Shows YouTube channel. 
In 1999, Konami put the fear of fog in a generation of players with the release of Silent Hill. The eerie title eschewed the more bombastic horror of its main rival at the time, Resident Evil, in favor of more psychological frights. Protagonist Harry Mason must embark on a terrifying search for his missing daughter, Cheryl, within the eerie town of Silent Hill. What unfolds is a descent into madness that kickstarted a franchise that&#x27;s (finally) returning to the limelight after years of dormancy. Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Kyle Hilliard, as we survive Silent Hill’s debut adventure and see how its scares stack up 23 years later.

Play enough games, and you start to develop an eye for the ones that are going to demand a lot of your time and focus. Within minutes, I knew Firaxis’ comic book-powered adventure with the Marvel superheroes would be one of those games, filled as it is with numerous currencies, cosmetics, and gameplay systems. Midnight Suns is a strategy/RPG of tremendous depth, character development in both storytelling and upgrade…</span>

                              <span>The Callisto Protocol, Glen Schofield&#x27;s spiritual successor to his Dead Space series, is finally out and to celebrate the day, Striking Distance Studios has released a content plan detailing six months of DLC for the game. 
As previously announced, The Callisto Protocol&#x27;s season pass DLC will feature brand-new death animations, presumably to be featured in the game&#x27;s new story content. According to this new content timeline, that additional story is expected to release sometime next summer. Before that, though, all players will receive New Game+ and a Hardcore Mode while season pass owners will also get the outer way skin collection, the contagion bundle, the riot bundle, and the aforementioned story content. 
Six months of content coming to The Callisto Protocol beginning Feb 7, 2023, with a free update of Hardcore Mode and New Game+. More details for this and the Season Pass coming soon. pic.twitter.com/43mLjK93IP

As you can see, the content stream begins in February and seemingly ends during the summer of next year. In the meantime, read our thoughts on the game in Game Informer&#x27;s review of The Callisto Protocol and then watch this 83-question rapid-fire interview with The Callisto Protocol&#x27;s director.

Nearly a decade and a half ago, Visceral Games released Dead Space, a now cult-classic survival-horror game inspired by the likes of Alien and The Thing. If you&#x27;ve ever yearned for a return to its mix of sci-fi and horror, or if you want a near-identical experience to Schofield’s first survival horror hit, you’re in luck. Schofield&#x27;s latest, The Callisto Protocol, veers incredibly close to Dead Space, for both better and worse. Unfortunately, though, it’s far too familiar. There are glimmers of g…</span>

                              <span>Monster Hunter Rise is embarking on a new hunt on PlayStation and Xbox consoles in January. Its recent expansion, Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak, will follow suit sometime next Spring. 
The latest entry in the uber-popular series comes to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on January 20. It will also be available on Xbox Game Pass for console, PC, and cloud at launch. The current-gen versions specifically boast 4K resolution, 60 FPS gameplay, and 3D audio, among other customizable options. However, a disclaimer on a new trailer states that 3D Audio will come to the Xbox One version in a Spring update. The PS5 port also supports DualSense haptic feedback for ranged and shielded weapons. The game is priced at $39.99 across all platforms. 


Monster Hunter Rise first launched in March 2021 for Switch before migrating to PC in January of this year. Sunbreak made its way to both platforms this past June. In addition to this news, Capcom reveals that Rise has sold over 11 million units since its launch.

                              <span>Neon White is finally making its way to PlayStation consoles, roughly six months after the game&#x27;s initial release on Switch and PC. 
Publisher Annapurna Interactive and developer Angel Matrix announced this news today, revealing that Neon White hits PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 on December 13. This fast-paced, speedrunning FPS is well worth your time if you haven&#x27;t played it yet and you can find out why in Game Informer&#x27;s Neon White review. 


&quot;Neon White is a lightning fast single-player speedrunning FPS where players sacrifice their guns for godlike parkour moves,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;Assume the role of White, an assassin handpicked from Hell, and compete with other demon slayers for a shot at redemption and a chance to live permanently in Heaven. The game utilizes a unique card-based weapon system, bite sized hand-designed levels, and a breakneck soundtrack by Machine Girl to turn players into speedrunning freaks. 
&quot;As players unravel Heaven&#x27;s mysteries, they will discover the other demon slayers are more familiar than they first appear, and through the visual novel inspired story, they learn it&#x27;s never too late to seek forgiveness.&quot; 
Check out this new trailer released today for the game&#x27;s upcoming PlayStation debut:

                              <span>Ubisoft and Bungie have revealed that crossover cosmetics are coming to both Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla and Destiny 2. 
The items will drop into both respective games next week on December 6 and it&#x27;s then that you&#x27;ll be able to purchase these themed cosmetics from the Assassin&#x27;s Creed in-game store and the Eververse store in Destiny 2. As for what to expect, the image below includes some looks: 
However, that doesn&#x27;t seem to feature all of the cosmetics we can expect to see. If you don&#x27;t feel like waiting until next week to see what makes its way to Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla, you can check out MAK Moderator&#x27;s video (as spotted by Forbes) on YouTube below: 


What&#x27;s interesting is that MAK Moderator&#x27;s video also features some Monster Hunter-themed cosmetics, meaning there&#x27;s likely a collaboration with that series set to be announced soon as well. 
&quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla players can purchase a Destiny 2-themed character pack, which includes armor sets, swords, a scout skin, and a mount skin,&quot; Ubisoft&#x27;s announcement reads. &quot;Players can also grab a weapons pack which includes four unique spins on Destiny&#x27;s iconic subclasses, each with their own gameplay perks and custom effects. As Destiny 2 begins its next season on December 6, players will be able to visit the Eververse store to get their hands on an Assassin&#x27;s Creed-themed ship, Sparrow, Ghost, and finisher cosmetics, as well as three armor ornament sets.&quot;

The Bunker will come to PlayStation and Xbox consoles, as well as PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store, sometime in 2023. Frictional says that The Bunker equips players &quot;with high levels of freedom to impact gameplay, choosing their playstyle as they explore at will this semi-open world.&quot; The game has hardly any scripted events, Frictional says, resulting in constant tension by way of an ever-present threat.

                              <span>Pokemon Scarlet and Pokemon Violet hit Switch just a few weeks ago on November 18 and while the game excels at a lot, it struggles on the technical side. Various glitches, bugs, and frame rate drops are present throughout a lot of the game, something we noted in our review, and fans have been vocal about their dissatisfaction with this aspect of their Paldean journeys. It seems Nintendo is taking these frustrations to heart in a rare admission in the latest update for the game. 
The company tweeted last night that a new software update of Scarlet and Violet was going live today alongside the following: &quot;We take the feedback from players seriously, and will continue to work on improvements to the games.&quot;

                              <span>Ryu Ga Gotoku Studios has released a new trailer for Like A Dragon: Ishin and it features a look at the various combat styles and weaponry we&#x27;ll be using in the game. 
For the uninitiated, Ishin is a from-the-ground-up remake of a Yakuza spinoff released on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 3 back in 2014. However, this spinoff never made its way to the West so when Ishin hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC in February, it will be the first time a lot of players will be able to play this game. To get prepared, RGG Studios has released a brand new trailer detailing some of the combat and associated mechanics present in the game. 
Check out the Like A Dragon: Ishin combat trailer for yourself below: 


&quot;In 1860s Kyo, a solemn samurai&#x27;s fight for justice stands to change the course of Japan&#x27;s history forever,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;Draw your blade and join the revolution in this heated historical adventure.&quot; 
Players who preorder the Digital Deluxe Edition of Like A Dragon: Ishin will receive early access to the game starting February 17 (the standard release date is February 21) and the following in-game items: 
Shinsengumi Captain&#x27;s Set
Room Growth Support Kit
Sword Upgrade Materials Kit
Gun Upgrade Materials Kit
Third Division Armament Expansion Kit
The Dragon of Dogma Skin
An additional three weapons: 
	
Kijinmaru Kunishige, a dark sword with a white hilt
Bloody Sheen, a sword soaked in blood
Black Ship Cannon, a cannon taken from Western Ships

                              <span>Capcom has announced that the second closed beta test for Street Fighter 6 will begin later this month and you can register for a chance to check the game out during it right now. 
This second beta will officially begin on December 16 and run through December 19 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC via Steam, and it will feature cross-play across all three platforms. As for what&#x27;s available, Capcom lists ranked matches, casual matches, battle hub matches, open tournaments, extreme battle, the game center, and Street Fighter 6&#x27;s training mode. 


If you&#x27;d like to sign up to potentially participate in this second closed beta, you can do so here. It&#x27;s important to note, though, that completing Capcom&#x27;s application process does not guarantee you selection for the beta. Selection is handled via a lottery system, according to Capcom, and not a first-come, first-served basis. You&#x27;ll need to have a registered Capcom ID to even apply and it must be linked to your platform account so be sure to do that first thing. Other than that, good luck getting in! The response to the first closed beta for Street Fighter 6 a few weeks ago was quite positive so it sounds like this second beta is going to be a great time as well. 
In the meantime, be sure to check out Game Informer&#x27;s Street Fighter 6 cover hub for all kinds of exclusive information and videos about the game. Here&#x27;s a taste of what you can find there:

                              <span>Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox Series Wireless Controller is a great fit for PC too, and at the Microsoft Store today you can grab one for $39.99 instead of the usual $59.99 - and in a choice of black, white, blue or red colourways. 
This is a great pickup for PC gaming, especially if you like platformers, racing games, action titles and the like, of which there are plenty on PC.

                              <span>Sonic Frontiers split opinion like most Sonic games do when it released earlier this year. Even Ed in our Sonic Frontiers review was split between finding it fun and frustrating. 

Well, maybe this will help: Sega have announced three updates to come in 2023, all of which will be free, and the last of which will add new playable characters and story.

                              <span>Today&#x27;s Google Doodle - the daily, sometimes-interactive twist on the search engine&#x27;s logo - offers up a handful of arcade mini-games to play with in your browser. They&#x27;re simple novelties, but there&#x27;s also an edit button on each one that allows you to tinker with them so you can plop down your own walls, enemies, switches and keys. The Doodle has been built to celebrate Jerry Lawson, a Black video game pioneer and the engineer who led the team that designed the first home video game console to use cartridges.

With Amnesia: The Bunker, devs Frictional Games are also dialling down the scripted sequences in favour of a semi-open world survival sandbox. Steady your grip on your revolver and step into the dark to watch the trailer below.

                              <span>For the last six months, I&#x27;ve been slowly picking my way through Company Of Heroes 2 for the first time. I&#x27;m about halfway through its campaign at the moment, but the rhythm of calling up replacements and reinforcing my squads hasn&#x27;t quite been engrained into my hotkey fingers yet. I keep making the mistake of thinking I can just push through with my remaining forces, but as any COH stalwart will know, that kind of road only ever leads to total disaster. 
Imagine my surprise, then, when I came to preview the latest build of Company Of Heroes 3&#x27;s dynamic, Total War-style Italian campaign and seemed to be, you know, actually making some pretty steady progress as I pushed up its mission maps. I was, admittedly, only playing the opening levels of this particular campaign, and I also had the aid of a handy M4A1 Sherman tank providing some welcome backup muscle. But during my four hours with it, I felt more in control of the battlefield than I&#x27;ve ever done while playing COH2. I was making excellent use of its reinforcement options, and heck, I was even remembering to tell units to retreat back to the nearest aid post so I didn’t lose the buffs they&#x27;d earned through their new EXP-driven promotions and veterancy bonuses. Then I played a mission from its more linear North African campaign, and had a very rude awakening indeed. Why, hello, frantic pressure and torrents of death bullets from Company Of Heroes 2 again, it&#x27;s been a while.

                              <span>We&#x27;ve all worn the rose-coloured glasses when it comes to old games. It&#x27;s a real hazard of the job when you started out covering stuff from the 90s. It&#x27;s less common though, to fall afoul of whatever its opposite is. The uh, yellow-tinted glasses, maybe? My point is that I did you all a disservice when I described Emperor Of The Fading Suns as &quot;an intriguing, ambitious, crap mega 4X&quot; last year. It was a remarkable game, and more remarkably still, its developers Holistic Design Inc. recently updated it with a major patch, 25 years after its original release.

It&#x27;s a lot better than I remember. And only some of that is down to the patch.

Our boy dishes out the heat in the gnarliest of ways, but it all culminates with the &quot;Wild Dancer&quot; fighting style which turns Kiryu into a spinning top of death. Sign me up.

None of them are exactly what you would call a Christmas-y game. In fact, they&#x27;re all pretty bleak and threatening in tone. But they&#x27;re also amazingly comforting.
Just imagine: sitting down in your favourite chair, electric heat pad on your back, cat on your lap, mug of hot chocolate or coffee by your side. Legions of undead roiling at the gates, trying to break through your cosy little town&#x27;s defences. Ahhhhh. It&#x27;s Christmas.

After playing a chunky new preview build last week, it&#x27;s clear there&#x27;ll be lots to dive into come release day on February 23rd. But when I sat down with vice president of production David Littman to talk more about their WW2 RTS, I was curious where their focus would lie after launch. While many love Company Of Heroes for its top notch campaigns, Littman told me they &quot;still have over 400,000 players still playing COH 1 and 2 monthly&quot; via multiplayer, which is impressive considering the last game in the series came out nine years ago. And when it comes to COH 3, Littman says they&#x27;ll go &quot;where the players are&quot;.

                              <span>I knew the hulking Ogryn would be my class in Warhammer 40,000: Darktide as soon as I shot his starting gun: a shotgun which holds a single shell the size of a can of beans. Sounds excessive, but that&#x27;s the kind of firepower you need when four outcasts face thousands of cultists, mutants, and demons. The follow-up to Vermintide is once again a Left 4 Dead-style cooperative first-person shooter with a fair whack of melee and, having played a lot of the beta and a little after launch, it&#x27;s a joyously grubby brawl with a great cast of weirdos.

                              <span>Ray tracing has been temporarily disabled in newly released co-op accent simulator Warhammer 40,000: Darktide due to issues with AMD and Intel graphics cards. Devs Fatshark say they’re looking into what’s causing the problems. Anecdotal reports from the Darktide subreddit seem to suggest that ray tracing was staying on for people who’d set the fancy lighting technique to off. For now, Fatshark say they&#x27;ve turned off ray tracing by default for all players until they can figure out what’s going on and implement a fix.

A lawsuit targeting people behind the &#x27;Wallhax&#x27; operation has already produced a $13.5m settlement  and in an amended complaint filed this week, Bungie identifies several people who previously enjoyed relative anonymity. It&#x27;s a chase that now spans three continents.

According to Uloz, these measures will likely result in overblocking, something that should be avoided according to EU law.

                              <span>WireGuard je populární síťový protokol, který nám umožňuje tunelovat provoz na třetí síťové vrstvě (IP) a stavět tak běžné VPN. Někdy nám to ale nestačí a potřebujeme víc. Musíme pak postavit most v tunelu.</span>

I haven&#x27;t played a Need For Speed game since I was 13 and this wasn&#x27;t on my radar at all, but yeah, sure, let&#x27;s drive. It looks just like the games I remember but with optional silly animated wings and dust trails.

                              <span>Romance has never been Bethesda&#x27;s strong suit, from Skyrim&#x27;s barebones marriage system to Fallout 4&#x27;s bonus-XP-granting fade-to-black cutscenes. Starfield will be a little more nuanced than that, suggests executive producer Todd Howard, offering more complex romance options than Fallout&#x27;s.
That&#x27;s just one detail from a nearly 3 hour-long interview Howard gave on the Lex Fridman podcast, where he also talks scrapping space strandings, and (gasp) why he prefers to play on consoles to PC.

                              <span>In a game about someone navigating the competing pressures and existential angst inherent to choosing a career, it seems appropriate that an update would let them sack it all off and go fishing. Sable hasn&#x27;t quite done that, because yesterday&#x27;s update sends you hover-biking off after enough fish to earn the right to don the new, professional mask of a desert angler.
On your bike, then.

                              <span>Half-Life 2 was the first game I ever played in VR. Back in the primordial days of 2013, I was lucky enough to get my ungainly sausage-mitts on an Oculus Developer&#x27;s Kit – the prototype headset that eventually led to the Oculus Rift. Understandably given the name, there were not games for the developers kit outside of a few incredibly basic demos. But there was Half-Life 2, for which Valve had implemented a hacky VR mode that you could activate with some console tomfoolery.

Asassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla&#x27;s free, final content update has arrived a week early, sending Eivor off to North America for one last hurrah.
There are actually two links to Mirage, because this final chapter features *more* of its protagonist, Basim, who Valhalla persevere-ers will have already met. I bailed after 15 hours and so have very little idea what&#x27;s going on, which is a shame because I&#x27;d love a chinwag with Shohreh Aghdashloo.

Wave hello to Makena, Efe, Noor, Kai, Ari, Sunny, and Zuri. Watch the trailer below to see the new default skins teaming up to build a giant alpaca.

                              <span>I&#x27;d argue that Azeroth&#x27;s unending expansion has taken the shine off a world that used to positively sparkle. Still, no matter what I think about World Of Warcraft today, it still holds a special place in my heart as an important formative experience.
Even the time capsule that&#x27;s Classic WoW probably couldn&#x27;t capture the same buzz of the past, mainly because I, as a being of flesh and bone, am not a teenager anymore. But I&#x27;d argue there&#x27;s one place that still captures the essence of WoW more than WoW itself nowadays: YouTube. Or to be more specific, channels which provide hour-long music and ambience from some of the game&#x27;s most memorable zones.

                              <span>Being interested in both sci-fi and strategy games, I’ve always wanted to reshape the galaxy. The free 3.6 Orion update for Paradox’s spacey grand strategy Stellaris is live now, and it&#x27;s done that, but in a way I hadn’t quite imagined. Among the changes with this update are six new galaxy shapes to mix up the pattern of your interstellar empires a bit. Orion also rebalances fleet combat, bringing in elements of the open beta that began back in October. Paradox have chucked in a few reworks of bits and pieces from Stellaris’ numerous expansions too, including changes to the Utopia DLC’s Ascension path. You can see more about that by watching the video below.

                              <span>For the last ten years, the XCOM designers at Firaxis have traded in &#x27;if&#x27;s and &#x27;maybe&#x27;s. If this shot lands, then maybe I can pull off this carefully calculated plan I’m brewing. It&#x27;s exactly the kind of taut, knife-edge tension we&#x27;ve come to love and expect from their turn-based strategy games, but Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns takes a different approach. As the titular demon hunters join forces with some famous Avengers faces to take down the evil sorceress Lilith and Marvel mega villain Chthon, there&#x27;s never any question about whether your moves will or won&#x27;t work here. You&#x27;re playing as the world&#x27;s most powerful superheroes. Of course, they’re going to work. And forget about cowering behind knee-high cover walls, too, because if you&#x27;re not already bulletproof, you&#x27;ve certainly got the reflexes and supercharged muscle mass to soak up anything Lilith’s Hydra minions are going to chuck at you.

Question is, by tipping the power scales in your favour like this, do you risk destroying that delicate balance of risk and reward? At first glance, it&#x27;s easy to think a more reliable set of heroes would end up dulling what made Firaxis&#x27; XCOM games so special, but the result is something equally thrilling. Given how the Marvel machine has drawn in and chewed up so much singular creative talent in the wider MCUniverse, Firaxis emerging with their cred intact is nothing short of extraordinary. Not only have they endured their radioactive spider bite, they&#x27;ve come out bigger and better for it, creating not only the best Marvel game I&#x27;ve played, but one of the best superhero games full stop.

The Crucial P5 Plus normally costs £100+, but today it&#x27;s down to £92.51 on Amazon UK - one of the best prices we&#x27;ve seen for this model although not quite the best ever.

You can take a look at some of what’s lined up for Overwatch 2 Season 2 in the trailer below.

It&#x27;s normally £200, but it&#x27;s down to £167 on AWD-IT which is a pretty decent deal if you want to build a powerful gaming PC on a budget.

                              <span>Warhammer 40,000: Darktide&#x27;s pre-order beta has drawn to a close, because tomorrow the full game will release proper. That&#x27;s also when our opinions on Darktide will start to flow across these pages like so many heretics across the streets of Tertium. Perhaps you&#x27;d like to enjoy one last dose of concentrated marketing before that happens, in which case you can hop below to watch the Darktide launch trailer.

Harvestella wants to be a jack of two trades, but winds up a master of none. Part action-RPG, part farming/life simulation, this combination can sometimes be enjoyable, but the two styles clash more often than not. The result is a sluggish grind more likely to repel fans of each genre than bring them together.
As an amnesiac warrior, you awaken on the outskirts of a quaint village, unaware of your origin and purpose. Four powerful, monolithic crystals called Seaslight govern the environmental stability of the picturesque continent, namely its seasons. However, a …</span>

                              <span>Final Fantasy XVI has received a few trailers throughout the year, and it&#x27;s set to hit PlayStation 5 and PC sometime next summer. But an exact release date is still unknown. However, in recent weeks, speculation about a release date reveal has begun to ramp up, with many predicting a FFXVI appearance at The Game Awards next month. 
Today, the official TGA Twitter account added fuel to that fire by revealing that FFXVI producer Naoki Yoshida, who we interviewed about the game earlier this summer, will be a presenter at the show this year. Plus, he&#x27;s being welcomed to give &quot;a very special live presentation.&quot; What that means remains unknown, but all signs point to something to do with FFXVI. Perhaps he&#x27;ll be playing the game live, or maybe The Game Awards orchestra will do an arrangement from…</span>

                              <span>When Sonic Frontiers came out at the start of November, it received one of the better receptions from fans and critics of any 3D Sonic the Hedgehog title. In my review, I praised many elements of Sonic Team&#x27;s first &quot;open-zone&quot; attempt, but my main takeaway was, &quot;I can’t wait to see how Sonic Team iterates on this formula in future entries.&quot; While those future entries are likely years away, the developer today gave us a glimpse into how it plans to expand Sonic Frontiers throughout 2023 through a content roadmap.
The Sonic Frontiers 2023 content shows off a series of future content updates to the game. The three updates will roll out to players of Sonic Frontiers over the course of 2023 at no additional cost. While no timeline is given, it&#x27;s probably safe to assume that Update 2 will hit so…</span>

                              <span>Narrative dinosaur adventure Goodbye Volcano High has awakened from dormancy with a new gameplay trailer and a 2023 release window. The title, unveiled in June 2020 as one of the first PlayStation 5 titles, will now arrive sometime next summer.
Goodbye Volcano High is a choice-driven teenage coming-of-age story starring Fang, a high school student, aspiring musician, and if you didn’t notice, a pterosaur. Alongside their bandmate Trish and other friends, the dino teens are faced with making the most of their final days together. Developer KO-OP describes the narrative as a tale of “personal growth, acceptance, and the power of community.” A new teaser trailer provides the first look at gameplay, showing off the dialogue interface and rhythm mechanics. 


KO-OP initially planned to release Goodbye Volcano High in 2021. However, last August, the small team pushed the launch into 2022 due to COVID-related development challenges and the decision to reboot the game’s narrative. The game still didn’t make a peep throughout 2022, and KO-OP says this latest delay stems from continued challenges related to the pandemic and the game’s large scope relative to the team’s size. For example, KO-OP states that over 6,000 voice lines have been recorded on top of completing a significant amount of “bespoke” animations. 
Goodbye Volcano High is slated to launch on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and PC via Steam.</span>

The DLC for Far Cry 6 takes Dani Rojas, the protagonist from the base game&#x27;s daft revolutionary narrative, and traps her within a kaleidoscopic and extraterrestrial version of Yara. There you&#x27;ll need to work with an alien AI to collect crystals and defeat crystal people. It&#x27;s out on December 6th and you&#x27;ll find the first trailer below.

                              <span>Somewhere in the region of 8,000 games have been removed from Steam since its inception, from the mass banning of “fake games”, to publishers removing their own titles due to licensing disputes, pending re-releases, personal disillusionment, server shutdowns and political scandals. Valve even took down one of its own games. Released in 2004 with Steam AppID 92, Codename: Gordon is a Flash-based 2D side-scroller set in the Half-Life universe, developed by Nuclearvision and published by Valve. It was removed due to a hard-coded link to the now-defunct developer’s domain, which Valve regarded as a security risk.
But removed isn’t always the same as gone, and exploring Steam’s deleted items is an adventure through modern gaming history. I spoke to some developers of delisted games to find out more.

Ahead of that though, we’ve been introduced to another member of the game’s expanding cast of the still-living. New undead slayer Amy has been given her own teaser trailer, which you can watch here.

                              <span>Nintendo and animation studio Illumination shared the latest trailer for The Super Mario Bros. Movie today. Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto was on hand to introduce the new trailer; Anya Taylor-Joy (who is playing Princess Peach) and Seth Rogan (who voices Donkey Kong) also shared selfie videos of themselves sharing their contractually obligated excitement about participating in the film.
The trailer showed more of the Mushroom Kingdom and primarily focused on Donkey Kong and Princess Peach. We also heard more from Chris Pratt&#x27;s Mario, Charlie Day&#x27;s Luigi, and Jack Black&#x27;s Bowser (who explicitly refers to Mario as being a human). The trailer shows Mario training, fighting Donkey Kong, driving a kart on a rainbow road, traveling with Peach, and there was also one quick moment where we saw the human world.
The Super Mario Bros. Movie arrives in theaters on April 7, 2023. You can see our live reaction to the trailer below.</span>

                              <span>Before the release of Gotham Knights, Warner Bros. Games Montreal revealed that following the game&#x27;s launch, four-player co-op, a heavily requested feature by fans, would be added in the form of a new mode called Heroic Assault. That mode, as well as a new two-player mode called Showdown, are both live now in Gotham Knights thanks to a new update. 
The base campaign of Gotham Knights allows for two-player co-op play, but getting all four of the knights together wasn&#x27;t possible. That&#x27;s still the case while playing through the game&#x27;s story, but the new online cooperative Heroic Assault mode, which tasks players with defeating enemies and completing challenges across 30 floors, supports four-player play.

                              <span>Cyberpunk 2077 developer CD Projekt Red has revealed that its upcoming remake of The Witcher will be open-world. 
This news comes by way of a quarterly financial call held yesterday by the company in which CDPR briefly touched on this remake being handled by developer Fool&#x27;s Theory, as reported by VG247.  While not much was revealed, CDPR did reveal in the slide pictured below that Codename: Canis Majoris, which we now know to be The Witcher Remake, will be a &quot;story-driven, single player open-world RPG&quot; and a &quot;modern reimagining of 2007&#x27;s The Witcher.&quot;
This might come as a surprise because that 2007 game wasn&#x27;t open-world and instead took players through small hub-like levels in the city of Vizima. 
Unfortunatley, this slide is essentially all that was revealed in regards to The Witcher Remake. It might be a while before we learn more about this remake, too, considering that CDPR told fans to &quot;please be patient&quot; because &quot;it&#x27;s gonna be a while until we can share more details&quot; when the company announced this game last month. 
The Witcher Remake is just one of multiple projects in the works at CDPR. Last month, the company revealed it was developing a brand new Cyberpunk game, multiple new Witcher games (including this remake), and even a new IP under the codename &quot;Hadar.&quot;

The group is well-known for its steady and prolific release schedule, but last Friday things went quiet. EVO&#x27;s mysterious absence fuels rumors of a potential bust, but nothing is confirmed thus far.

Offworld is making Extermination in collaboration with Sony Pictures Consumer Products and in the game, players will engage in squad-based FPS combat to exterminate the arachnid threat fans of the 1997 film will know really well. Those squads will need to work together in order to complete objectives, acquire resources necessary to continue the fight, build and defend a base of operations, and ultimately, escape to the one extraction point as a team.

                              <span>Sega released Sonic Frontiers earlier this month and while fans have been finding plenty of fun in this new open world-ish take on the blue blur, they&#x27;ve also been running into some bugs. Fortunately, Sega is releasing a new Sonic Frontiers patch on all platforms to address some of these bugs and bring additional optimization to the game. 
This news comes by way of a new tweet from the official Japanese Sonic the Hedgehog Twitter account that reveals update 1.10 &quot;fixes an issue where the boss would sometimes disappear when retrying the boss battle on Chronos Island,&quot; as reported by Video Games Chronicle. This update is already live on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 and is expected to begin rolling out to other platforms very soon. 


Other fixes in the 1.10 patch include fixing the Chaos Island map to display properly after clearing the island, fixing crashing bugs and audio issues, adding UI improvements, optimizing stability and performance, and more, according to Update Crazy, as noted by VGC. 
While waiting for the patch to download, read Game Informer&#x27;s Sonic Frontiers review and then check out our top 10 tips to help you build momentum in the game.

                              <span>Warner Bros. Discovery revealed last month that it had hired Peter Safran and Marvel Studios alum and director James Gunn (Guardians of the Galaxy, The Suicide Squad, Peacemaker) to lead as co-CEOs of DC Studios, as reported by Variety. Since then, Gunn has been fielding questions about DC Studios, the DCU&#x27;s future, and what his plans are as a new lead within DC&#x27;s entertainment output. 
When asked on Twitter yesterday if he and Safran are &quot;planning to give more DC characters TV shows that&#x27;ll add to the story for the DCEU,&quot; Gunn responded, &quot;Yes, most definitely, the DCU will be connected across film and TV (and animation).&quot; In a follow-up tweet, another user asked is there are plans to connect games to this larger DCU canon as well, to which Gunn simply responded, &quot;Yes.&quot; 
Yes.
November 27, 2022
It&#x27;s an interesting response and idea, especially given that it seems clear Warner Bros. Discovery wants its DCU to become something more akin to Marvel Studios&#x27; MCU. However, MCU plans don&#x27;t include video games because Marvel&#x27;s video game efforts through partners such as Insomniac Games (Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man), Crystal Dynamics (Marvel&#x27;s Avengers), and others do not connect in any way.
In fact, Marvel Games vice president and creative director Bill Roseman said back in September that it&#x27;s important that each studios&#x27; Marvel game is not connected to the rest as it allows for narrative freedom said studio might not get otherwise.
This is one area DC could differ greatly from Marvel and who knows, perhaps it&#x27;s the creative edge DC needs to catch up to the MCU. Only time will tell. 
In the meantime, check out our thoughts on the latest DC game in Game Informer&#x27;s Gotham Knights review. Read our list of the top 10 superhero games of all time after that.

                              <span>Multiple beta releases often indicate lots of bugs to be fixed, but in this case we got carried away adding features and thought more testing was needed. New features since beta1 include: Variable interface scaling at whatever size you want (not just 2x and 4x), with optional chunky bevels for that retro feel. Multi-track level crossings to keep road vehicles from stopping in the middle of the crossing. A new Generate World menu which now includes NewGRF, AI, and Game Script configuration menus. Cargo filters for vehicle lists (such as at stations) to allow better visualization of traffic. Optional cargo names above vehicles in vehicle lists, to show at a glance what they carry. The ability to clone or share orders with vehicles grouped by shared orders. An improved local authority action window which now shows you actions you can’t afford, instead of hiding them. In addition, some new tools are available to AI and Game Script authors: Scriptable league tables which can replace the default scoring system AI and Game Scripts can now be modified in Scenario Editor for existing scenarios (although not savegames) (As ever, see the changelog for further details).

                              <span>I’ve been excited about developer Flying Wild Hog’s Evil West since its reveal at The Game Awards in 2020. So much about it immediately captured my attention. Despite Red Dead Redemption’s best efforts, I’ve always felt there’s a shortage of wild wests in video games, although some games use a western’s formula to tell a story set elsewhere. Evil West’s premise also feels reminiscent of something you’d see in the PlayStation 2 era: cowboys who protect mere mortals from the secret horrors of the world, such as vampires and other creatures. My mind can’t help but see Darkwatch, a game I played repeatedly as a child, when I see Evil West. 
Even more generally, that era was great for third-person action westerns – Gun, Red Dead Revolver, the aforementioned Darkwatch, and Call of Juarez (althou…</span>

                              <span>​God of War Ragnarök is a world full of scowling gods and monsters butting heads as they each work toward their best interests. The nine realms are dark and dangerous, but through all of that shines a beam of unexpected light, and I am not talking about Brok, the dwarf who seems incapable of finishing a sentence without including some kind of vulgarity before meeting the period at the end. I am talking about Ratatoskr, the eyepatch-wearing squirrel who watches over Yggdrasil, the world tree that holds the realms in place.
Ratatoskr technically appeared in God of War (2018), but he was less of a character and more of an ability. Atreus could summon the translucent blue squirrel to bring health items and sometimes hacksilver. In God of War Ragnarök, Ratatoskr is a physical, non-translucent c…</span>

You&#x27;ll need to log in to your GI account and click &quot;okay to print&quot; for your letter or question to go through. We&#x27;d also love it if you included your location (city, state, or country will do). We&#x27;ll look through the questions and pick a few to include in our next issue, which releases on December 20.
For each issue, we ask our community a question for our SoundOff section. This time around, we want to know...
&quot;What&#x27;s the best gaming-related gift you&#x27;ve ever received?&quot;
You can answer this question and/or include any other feedback you want. Thank you again for your support throughout the years, and we hope many of you get the chance to have your letter printed in an upcoming issue!

                              <span>As of writing, the fastest runthrough of Neon White’s “Smackdown” level is 9.56 seconds, earned by player “earlobe” on September 6, 2022.
Standing in contrast is the work that went into it. According to designer and creative director Ben Esposito, the earliest iteration was in March 2019, more than three years before its release in June 2022. In that time, there were more than 50 different iterations. Sometimes changes were small. Other times they fundamentally altered the level. Every designer who worked on the game has touched Smackdown in some form. Nevertheless, load into it now; chances are all that labor is invisible to you. Before sitting down to write, I beat it in just 11 seconds.
Neon White is a game built around speedrunning. Levels are short. If you’re playing as intended, you hardly notice your surroundings before moving on. But the only way that works effectively is if levels are meticulously designed to facilitate that movement; they have to be made so that it feels natural for the player to fly through them. Making a level you barely think twice about takes a lot of effort. Read more...</span>

It&#x27;s a list we will be updating as often as games worthy of inclusion release. We will kick games off and add new ones as the Switch&#x27;s library grows.
Please note that while the list below contains 10 entries, we aren’t actually ranking them – if a game has made it this far (and managed to stay here), it’s a must-play, period. As such, we’ll be listing entries in reverse chronological order. Also, you’ll find a rundown of previous entries at the bottom of the list. While those titles have gotten bumped for bigger and better experiences, they are still all great games in their own right and worth exploring if you’re alread…</span>

                              <span>Despite an avalanche of entries since its original release in 1991, many still consider Sonic the Hedgehog 2 the pinnacle of the series. Sonic the Hedgehog 2 was showered with praise upon release in 1992 and surprisingly, that sterling reputation hasn&#x27;t faded decades later. We asked the people behind the game&#x27;s success to share how Sonic&#x27;s second outing became one of Sega&#x27;s driving forces in its fight against Nintendo.
Coming off of the massive success of the Japan-developed Sonic the Hedgehog, Sega relocated development efforts for the sequel to the newly founded Sega Technical Institute in the U.S. Sega tapped Mark Cerny to lead the STI, who has since gone on to help create other mascots like Crash Bandicoot and Spyro the Dragon.
