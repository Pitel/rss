With the new Tracer Pack, you can take on the role of the leisurely sloth to compete in a series of challenges and earn fiery rewards. Here&#x27;s a complete guide for the Blaze Up event in Warzone and MW3.


MW3 and Warzone Blaze Up event guide


The Blaze Up event links to various modes in MW3, Warzone, and Zombies. Complete specific objectives through the Quick Play option, which can be found in the Events tab. Blaze Up challenges are broken into three different tasks, differing from the standard single-based you may have seen in the Weekly Challenges. Achieve one of the three objectives to earn the following rewards in MW3 and Warzone Blaze Up:

Wild Offerings are showing up in player&#x27;s inventories, and some don&#x27;t understand why. The Wild Offerings are associated with the Wild God&#x27;s quest but can be earned before the quest is even started, leading to a bit of confusion. Given that these items are the gateway to some pretty solid gear upgrades, it&#x27;s in players&#x27; best interests to understand how to get them and what they are used for. This guide will walk players through Wild Offerings: Complete the Wild God&#x27;s quest, how to earn them the Offerings, and what they are used for, so that all…</span>

                              <span>There are over a dozen Shikai Elements to choose from, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. While all of them are technically viable, some are definitely better than others. We&#x27;ve put together this Type Soul Shikai Tier List to help you choose which Shikai Elements are best to go for when building your character.





Shikai Elements Tier List for Type Soul


This Tier List covers all the available Shikai Elements in Type Soul, and includes their respective rarity. While each Shikai is viable, some are definitely better than others in all forms of gameplay. Those in the S Tier are always going to perform the best in most forms of gameplay. Those in the A Tier are still strong options that will have no problems, while those in the B Tier cater to specific strengths and scenarios. Those in the C Tier should be avoided if possible unless you just really like playing as it. As you may expect, the Legendary Shikai Elements are typically the best. Here is our Shikai Elements Tier List:


S Tier



Blood (Legendary)


Theatre (Legendary)


Flower (Legendary)


Ice (Legendary)



A Tier



Ink (Legendary)


Zangetsu (Rare)


Water (Common)


Lightning (Common)



B Tier



Shadow (Common)


Berserk (Common)


Fire (Rare)



C Tier



Creation (Common)


Confusion (Common)


Wind (Rare)



Shikai Weapons Tier List


Now that we know the best Shikai Elements in Type Soul, let&#x27;s take a look at the best Shikai Weapons. This Tier List assumes your weapons are M1 stats, just to keep everything fair. Obviously, a weapon with proper stats while one has none is gonna be better regardless. Also, weapons like the Inkblade require the Legendary Ink Element of Shikai, so it is ranked based on its respective Shikai as a whole. Here is our Shikai Weapons Tier List:


S Tier



Dagger


Longsword


Inkblade (Requires Ink Element)



A Tier



Katana


Hammer


Greatsword


Spear


Dualblades



B Tier



Fist


Twinblades


Scythe

                              <span>It’s safe to say that while playing Infinite Craft, you truly are capable of making almost anything. By combining two elements, starting with the most basic, you can eventually get to the weirdest combinations, such as Bat Eurostar, which I’m not sure even Batman needs. 


With people playing all over the world, it’s only natural that we all want to make our own home countries or take a journey to all of our favorite destinations. With that said, here’s how to make 10 countries in Infinite Craft, starting from the easiest to create and ending with the most difficult.

The easiest country to make from this entire list is, without doubt, Norway. With only four combinations needed:

If you want to maximize medal gains to buy everything out from your War Bonds, check out important details regarding this currency.


What is the max amount of medals you can have in Helldivers 2?


The max amount of medals you can hold in your inventory in Helldivers 2 is 250. So, if you start getting close to that number, you may want to spend some on unclaimed items in your War Bonds. 


Since we, the Helldivers 2 community, tend to complete Major Orders with ease, we’re constantly getting random boosts of 50 medals every three days. Pair that on top of completing personal orders which grant about 15 medals a day, it’s easy to hit that cap.

                              <span>The Call of Duty Blaze Up event features various Warzone-related content. In particular, an objective requires you to &quot;activate the Boat Horn near the Factory on Rebirth Island.&quot; Here&#x27;s how to complete this task and earn the themed Weapon Sticker. 


How do you activate the Boat Horn in Warzone?


To activate the Boat Horn in Warzone&#x27;s Rebirth Island, go to the boat near the G7 coordinates. The Factory will be nearby, where you must head toward the front of the vessel.

Use the stairs and ladders to reach the top of the boat. The main object you&#x27;re looking for is the helm near the Boat Horn. You&#x27;ll likely run into some enemies while on your way there, so be on the lookout. Use a team if need be, but it is possible to run it solo with the right weapons.

Interact with the station at the back of the helm to activate the Boat Horn in Warzone. You should see a &quot;Horn&quot; option when approaching it. Once that&#x27;s done, the Blaze Up notification will appear for the mission&#x27;s completion. Unfortunately, the horn may attract enemy Operators toward you, as it did for me.

After completing the objective, the Hot Out of the Oven Weapon Sticker should be available. Over time, more rewards can be earned in the MW3 and Warzone Season 3 Blaze Up event, including XP Tokens, High as Duck Charm, and the Bro, You&#x27;re Out of This World Calling Card. Complete all 11 challenges to obtain the exclusive Daymares Mastery weapon blueprint.

                              <span>It won&#x27;t come cheap, but Activision added a new Gold Cheetah weapon camo to Modern Warfare 3 and Warzone.


Recently, CoD community members slammed the devs for incentivizing players to purchase four King Kong and Godzilla operator packs for $80 to unlock an exclusive melee weapon. The Beast Glove failed to meet expectations, as it didn&#x27;t feature any unique animations or allow players to equip a camo on it. Instead of reeling the monetization practices in, Activision one-upped itself and released an even more expensive cosmetic item.

Here is a step-by-step guide on how to unlock the Golden Cheetah camo. 



Go to the Call of Duty Shop website 


Complete a purchase through the store totaling $100 USD or more to receive a digital code for a Gold Cheetah Weapon Camo 


After receiving the code, log in to your Activision account on the Call of Duty website


Scroll over to the redeem page


Type in the code with the correct spelling and capitalization


Hit “REDEEM CODE” to claim your reward



This promotion event runs from April 10-24. Activision clarified that the limit is one code per eligible order and a maximum of five codes per household. Additionally, Codes will be delivered to the email address provided at checkout, and may not be sent immediately. Activision also confirmed that any items purchased as part of the offer cannot be cancelled or returned, and this is only a limited-time offer while supplies last. 


Community members are sure to have conflicting opinions over a cosmetic item costing $100. But based on recent trends, it doesn&#x27;t look like Activision has any plans to stop pushing the envelope further if players are still willing to make a purchase.

The Game Awards kicked off in 2014, and that year’s top contenders and GotY winner established a bit of a trend for the show – the tendency to favor sprawling, open-world fantasy games over smaller titles and sequels over new IP.

                              <span>Modern Warfare 3 and Warzone players have reported a massive uptick in &quot;unfair bans&quot;, but Activision dispelled those rumors with authority. 


In response to community members complaining about a wave of &quot;false bans,&quot; an Activision representative reportedly told WZStatsGG: &quot;If you see a permanent ban, those are given with the most serious considerations and after significant research. It doesn’t matter what excuses people give. There are no false permanent bans.” So for players, who may have thought they were banned without reason, Activision pushed back against that notion and defended every ban that is dealt.

Some community members allegedly used an external unlock tool to get cosmetic items for free that they otherwise had to pay for. CharlieIntel confirmed, &quot;Using unlock tools in Call of Duty is a bannable offense, and you can get permanently banned for using it. Not sure why some of the people claiming they got banned for using it are acting surprised.&quot; It&#x27;s unclear if all of the recent bans stemmed from unlock tools, 


This isn&#x27;t the first time Activision has defended its anti-cheat system. At the end of February, Warzone players feared that RICOCHET stopped working. Activision responded to concerns by clarifying that the cheating service was never offline and actually banned over 6,000 accounts for cheating between February 16-20. The war against cheating is a long and arduous one, but it&#x27;s clear that the devs have a clear vision and mission when it comes to dealing with hackers.

                              <span>It feels like it&#x27;s been a long time coming, but Metamorphosis Games and publisher Fireshine Games are officially locking a date for the action-platformer Gestalt: Steam &amp; Cinder. Both bullets and blades will fly on May 21, 2024.


This is one that I&#x27;ve been following for years at this point, and I&#x27;m not the only one at this site who&#x27;s been impressed by it in the past. Gestalt does look like a pixel-art action-platformer, which can seem a little routine these days. But the actual play is anything but; it&#x27;s got a great mix of RPG concepts, interesting narrative hooks and art direction, and some pitch-perfect platforming to tie it all together.




Basically, there&#x27;s a lot more going on under the hood than a first glance might make you think. The story follows Aletheia, an elite mercenary in a fantasy steampunk world. Picking up quests and taking on the occassional odd-job is all part of her quest to discover what lies beneath all the steam and steel of this world.


The slicing-and-shooting combination feels fantastic though, reminding me of the Mega Man ZX series and other games that combine blaster with blade. I could go on further, but you could also just check it out for yourself. There&#x27;s a demo available on Steam right now, if you want to check out Gestalt ahead of its launch date.


After several years, I hope all of Gestalt comes together for a solid side-scrolling experience. Among the many games at the Triple-I Initiative showcase today, it&#x27;s definitely one I was happy to see reappear. We&#x27;ll see how the full game lands on May 21.

                              <span>There are a bunch of Star Wars Outlaws special editions, as you&#x27;d probably expect from Ubisoft. One of the perks is getting three days of early access.

What Star Wars Outlaws special editions are there?


There are two Star Wars Outlaws special editions, in addition to the Standard version. The Gold Edition and the Ultimate Edition. The first ($109.99) includes:



The game


Three days of early access 


The Season Pass



The Ultimate Edition ($129.99) provides:



The game


Three days of early access


Season Pass


Dissident Infiltrator Pack (cosmetic items for Kay, Nix, the speeder, and the Starhunter spaceship)


Sabacc Shark Pack (cosmetics for Kay, her blaster, Nix, the speeder, and the Starhunter spaceship)


Digital art book



If you&#x27;re an Ubisoft+ subscriber, you&#x27;ll be able to play Star Wars Outlaws three days early as well. The available version is the Ultimate Edition. Whether or not it&#x27;s worth purchasing the special editions is up to you, Jedi.

Is there a Star Wars Outlaws pre-order bonus?


If you decide to pre-order any version of Star Wars Outlaws, you&#x27;ll get the Kessel Runner bonus package, which includes cosmetics for the speeder and the Starhunter spaceship. 


What does the Star Wars Outlaws Season Pass include?


It&#x27;s quite bizarre that a single-player game like Star Wars Outlaws has a Season Pass. Nevertheless, it gives players the following:



Two upcoming DLC&#x27;s that provide new areas to explore, quests, and storylines. They&#x27;ll release after launch. 


An exclusive quest that revolves around a debt that Jabba the Hutt has on ND-5.


The Kessel Runner Character Pack for Kay and Nix. It lets Kay cosplay as Han Solo.

                              <span>If you thought you were done slicing and shooting in Brotato, Blobfish Games has something to steer you right back on track. The paid DLC Abyssal Terrors has been revealed along with a free local co-op update, both due out sometime this summer.


Abyssal Terrors takes our hyper-capable potato on a voyage out to the open seas, where he&#x27;ll have to deal with a bunch of new challenges. There will be 20 new waves in total, complete with new enemies and bosses that aim to up the difficulty for those who have survived everything Brotato has thrown at them thus far. There are also over 10 new weapons to find, and over 10 new potatoes that offer up their own unique abilities. 


You can see some of the upcoming DLC and a quick tease of the local cooperative play update in the announcement trailer: 


The announcement came as part of today&#x27;s Triple-I Initiative showcase, which brought together a bunch of indie game developers for reveals and previews. That local co-op is a big hook for both new and long-time players. It will support up to four potatoes locally, and packs in a few other tweaks to round out the update. Blobfish announced plans for game balancing adjustments, various fixes, and, if you prefer your details on the vague side, &quot;new content.&quot;
Whatever that may entail, the co-op is enough justification for firing away again in both the main game and the DLC, which is available to wishlist on Steam right now.

                              <span>The absolute best way to improve your heroes in AFK Journey is through ascension. Your characters start out at a certain &quot;tier&quot; or &quot;rarity&quot; and you can upgrade this through the use of soul sigils (duplicates of the heroes) and acorns, both of which are normally found through gacha pulls. The cost of moving to the next tier varies based on the type (or level or actual rarity) of the hero, as well as what tier you&#x27;re improving to.


You&#x27;ll most likely just be improving your best heroes as the resources become available. However, to make it clear what you&#x27;ll need for each tier, you&#x27;re looking at:



A-Level: 63 Soul Sigils and 200 Acorns


S-Level: 7 Soul Sigils and 350 Acorns

Unfortunately, Helldivers 2 does not have cross-progression at the time of this being out. The CEO of Arrowhead Game Studios and Creative Director of Helldivers 2, Jonathan Pilestedt, took to X (formerly Twitter) to discuss this matter:




In the Tweet, he said that this feature would be implemented “sometime in the future”. He further added that he didn’t think there would be enough interest in it, so it was never added. 


So, the answer isn’t an outright no, but you shouldn’t hold out on it if you were planning on playing Helldivers 2 between your PC or handheld and the PlayStation 5. Choose your preferred platform and stick to it in the meantime. 


Should the option become available in the future, you can then support democracy on two different fronts.


Luckily, since this game supports cross-play between PlayStation 5 and PC, you aren’t at too much of a loss for not being able to switch platforms and keep your progress. 


The only loss would really be for those who have a handheld PC like an ROG Ally or a Steam Deck who want to take the game on-the-go, but primarily play on PlayStation.

Currently available exclusively in Japan, Blue Protocol is an action MMO where you&#x27;re the star of the game. You get to create a character and build them up from nothing into the hero the world needs. In order to do this, though, you&#x27;ll have to pick the right class based on its strengths and abilities, and it&#x27;s hard to know which ones are best without first diving into the details. 


All Blue Protocol classes and their abilities and strengths


Below, I&#x27;ve listed every class in Blue Protocol alongside their abilities and strengths, so you have a decent idea of which one you should pick when you get into the game. Of course, you can pick any of them …</span>

                              <span>Since Valve released its highly praised Steam Deck device over two years ago, we&#x27;ve been seeing a bit of competition from other companies looking for that slice of the mobile gaming PC pie. Lenovo launched the Legion Go late last year, and we&#x27;re already getting hints about a next-gen model.


According to a recent report from Videocardz, Lenovo&#x27;s Gaming Category Manager Clifford Chong spoke at the Innovate 2024 conference in Bangkok about what happens next. A quote from them says the company sees potential in continuing in the mobile PC market after the release of the Legion Go.




While there&#x27;s still work being done on the current model, Chong says the team is &quot;looking towards when the time comes right&quot; regarding the next generation. A potential Legion Go 2 will likely &quot;provide even more features.&quot;


Why no Steam Deck 2?


In all of this, it&#x27;s tempting to get caught up asking what Valve is planning next for the Deck. Released at the start of 2022, the hardware contained within it is already starting to look a little outdated. As a quick comparison, the Legion Go uses the fourth generation AMD Zen and RDNA3 technology, while the Steam Deck has Zen2 and RDNA2. Videocardz suggests a potential Legion Go 2 could sport Zen5 and RDNA3.5 tech.


Of course, Valve did release the OLED version of the Deck in November last year. While it did boast a few improvements, such as better battery life, its focus was mainly on providing a better screen. The main guts of the device remained largely untouched.


That&#x27;s not to say something isn&#x27;t being planned, but with Lenovo already looking ahead to possible newer models, it feels like Valve may  need to make an announcement about something soon.

                              <span>Yesterday was a pretty interesting day for those waiting for fresh details about Star Wars Outlaws. If you were quick enough, that is. Turns out, prior to the new story trailer going live, Ubisoft accidentally leaked the game&#x27;s release date early. There was a scramble to remove the date and any additional info (August 30, if you&#x27;re interested), but it was too late at that point.


Developed by Massive Entertainment – the team behind Tom Clancy&#x27;s The Division series – Outlaws will be set between the Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi films. And because it&#x27;s being published by Ubisoft, many of you will be wondering whether it will be available on Steam.




The short answer is: no, it doesn&#x27;t look like it will be. According to a press release – as outlined by a recent report from PC …</span>

                              <span>World of Warcraft, Overwatch, Hearthstone, and more are coming back to China thanks to a new deal with Microsoft and NetEase. Blizzard announced today that an agreement was reached to reinstate all of their games that were shut down in January of last year.


It was a rather messy breakup when Blizzard had to pull away from China. It&#x27;s hard to know exactly what happened, as both sides of the relationship blamed the other. But ultimately, NetEase and Blizzard were unable to come to terms that satisfied both parties.


It&#x27;s important to note that in China, outside companies need to have a sort of sponsor company from within the country in order to operate. Together, the two companies then create a separate Chinese version of the company that technically operates on its own. That&#x27;s the most basic way to describe what is otherwise a very complicated process for outside companies. 




The big question I have is what happens next for Chinese players. It was no doubt a gut-wrenching day for players to lose all of their time spent in WoW and Hearthstone. I know that Blizzard typically saves account data on their side, including characters and card collections. Hopefully players won&#x27;t have to start over from scratch when Blizzard games show back up.


Along with all of this, Microsoft announced that they&#x27;re working to bring more NetEase titles to Xbox consoles and other platforms.

Helldivers 2 players adore the new Evacuate High-Value Assets mission. After initially lamenting the return of the Automatons after beating them during Operation Swift Disassembly, players are now excitedly hopping into a new type of mission this defense-focused Major Order has brought with it. I can&#x27;t help but get swept up with their glee because these missions make it feel like you&#x27;ve just withstood an impossible onslaught of every Automaton on the planet, all trying to kill you at once.

                              <span>EA Motive shifting its focus to Iron Man and Battlefield has apparently disrupted development on a new Dead Space remake, though Electronic Arts is denying the validity of that report.


On April 9, EA Motive, the studio behind the Dead Space 1 remake, was reassigned to work on the Battlefield series. Giant Bomb&#x27;s Jeff Grub reported, &quot;They were working on Dead Space 2, and they are no longer working on it. It is on the shelf because the first game had lackluster sales is how it was phrased to me.&quot; Grub elaborated that the sequel was believed to have been in the pre-production phase before getting shelved. &quot;If you were looking forward to Dead Space 2, it&#x27;s bad news. Does this mean it never happens? I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s the case.&quot;

It looked like all hope might have been lost, but an EA spokesperson told IGN, “We don’t normally comment on rumors, but there is no validity to this story.&quot; The story didn&#x27;t end there, as Grubb fired back and defended his original claim. &quot;I give you my permission to believe EA if you want, but whenever a company says &quot;that isn&#x27;t true&quot; but they don&#x27;t specify which part of the story they are talking about, well ... yeah.&quot; 


Grubb doubled down and reported that a Dead Space 2 remake was being planned, but isn&#x27;t being made now. It remains to be seen what EA has up its sleeve, and whether another Dead Space remake is truly in the cards or not.

                              <span>Most Call of Duty eliminations unleash bloody messes with the countless sweet takedowns of opponents. However, some challenges forbid you from getting your hands dirty, specifically with the MW3 Clean Kill objective. It&#x27;s a feat that doesn&#x27;t necessarily have a description, so we&#x27;re here to explain it in detail. 


MW3 Clean Kills, explained


MW3&#x27;s  Clean Kills are eliminations where you don&#x27;t take any damage from the target or other Operators. So, while you&#x27;re busy eliminating an enemy, make sure not to get hit by anyone else on the opposing side. This includes explosions, bullets, or any melee attacks. Unfortunately, the game won&#x27;t instantly notify you when a Clean Kill is initiated, so check the progress on the challenge to see if it worked:

As an avid Call of Duty player, I know how hard Clean Kills can be since shooting often puts a target on your back. One way I&#x27;ve found helpful is using Killstreaks and gear to mark the opposing sides&#x27; positions. That way, it&#x27;ll reduce the risk of a surprise attack. UAV and Advanced UAV Killstreaks are excellent tools to use, as is the CCT Comms Vest (which shows any nearby enemy locations upon a kill).


Long-distance attacks probably work best for the Clean Kills in MW3, given that opponents are less likely to hit you. I suggest avoiding the more compact-sized maps like Stash House and Growhouse. It&#x27;s almost impossible not to get hit in smaller locations, so try out medium areas such as Highrise, 6 Star, and Greece. 


Many challenges utilize Clean Kills to earn exclusive rewards. For example, MW3 weekly and camo challenges frequently require this elimination. So, stay alive while shooting the enemy to get those valuables in no time.

                              <span>Rocket League has gone a long way since 2015, starting only on the PS4 and Steam. Since then, it has expanded so much, eventually becoming a free-to-play game with many wondering: does Rocket League support cross-platform play? 


We’ll break down everything you need to know below.


Is Rocket League Cross Platform?


In short, yes, Rocket League is a cross-platform game. It’s also quite simple to partake in this so there won’t be any barriers to playing online. 


With cross-platform enabled, you will be able to add friends who are on other platforms and play with them in private or public lobbies. On top of that, matchmaking times will be significantly shorter because you’re in a larger pool of players.

How to turn cross-platform on in Rocket League


Cross-play will be enabled once you get through the log-in process in Rocket League. You literally can not play the game without an Epic Games account. So, upon logging in or creating an EG account, you’ll be able to get into crossplay action in no time.


The feature should already be on by default once you’re in the main menu either going through customizations or setting up a match.


You also do not need to link your primary account to Epic Games if you have multiple platforms. Just as long as you have a login with Epic Games, you’re good to go. If you want to carry your progress from one platform to another, that’s when you will need to link accounts.


All playable platforms on Rocket League


If you’re looking to see what other platforms Rocket League is on, it’s on the following systems:



PC (Epic Games)


Nintendo Switch


PlayStation 4 and 5


Xbox One and Series consoles



The same login process will be needed if you play between platforms, though once you have your account linked, everything should carry over minus platform-exclusive items, some licensed content, and currency.

                              <span>With a blazing celebration just around the corner, it seems only fitting that Cheech and Chong have made their debut on Call of Duty. We&#x27;re here to show you how to get this exclusive bundle in MW3 and Warzone. 


How do you get the Cheech and Chong bundle in MW3 and Warzone?


If you&#x27;ve recently logged into Modern Warfare 3 or Warzone, you may have noticed an option to get the Cheech and Chong Tracer Pack. However, the new bundle has since been removed, as it was initially intended to launch in the Store on April 20, 2024. This was due to the release of the Blaze Up event, which allowed players to access the bundle early.

From what we can tell from this brief interval, you can purchase the Cheech and Chong Tracer Pack for 3,000 CP. The bundle comes with the following content:



Still Smokin&#x27; Tracers


 &quot;Up In Smoke&quot; Death Effect: The &quot;Dankest&quot; MTZ-556 Assault Rifle


 &quot;Hashassin&quot; HRM-9 SMG


 &quot;Mellow and Mild&quot; Haymaker Shotgun


 &quot;Secondhand Smoke&quot; Finishing Move


 &quot;Be Mellow&quot; Large Decal


 &quot;Cheech &amp; Chong&#x27;s&quot; Large Decal


 &quot;Smoke Buds&quot; Weapon Sticker


 &quot;Iconic&quot; Weapon Charm


 &quot;Cheech and Chong&#x27;s Seltzer&quot; Weapon Charm


 &quot;Blunt Buddies&quot; Loading Screen



Since the Cheech and Chong pack has already debuted for a limited time, you may see other Operators smoking out the competition with the new content. Unfortunately, it won&#x27;t be accessible until it is officially released on MW3 and Warzone. 


On the other hand, the Blaze Up event will take you high above the clouds with the exclusive Stoney Sloth Tracer Pack. Sure, it&#x27;s not Cheech and Chong, but at least it gives you an early start for your chill session. Currently, the Blaze Up and Warzone High Trip events are active, which is the perfect time to equip these new skins for Season 3.

                              <span>Celesteela has been in Pokémon Go since 2022, but the Ultra Beast didn’t receive a shiny form in the mobile title until the Sizable Surprises limited-time event. From now on, players are able to catch a shiny Celesteela, but it requires jumping a few hoops first in Pokémon Go.


How to catch Shiny Celesteela: Raids


Since Celesteela is an Ultra Beast, it isn’t the type of Pokémon you are able to just find in the wild and capture while playing Pokémon Go. Instead, you’ll need to rely on a couple of different methods to find it: 



Research Tasks


Raids


Special limited-time events



The problem is, Research events don&#x27;t always happen, so they aren’t the most reliable way to get a shiny Celesteela. As such, you’ll want to do some Celesteela raids if you’d like to catch a shiny form. Thi…</span>

                              <span>Developer Evil Empire and publisher Ubisoft officially revealed The Rogue Prince of Persia during today&#x27;s Triple-I Initiative for 2024. Featuring a unique stylized art style, The Rogue Prince of Persia returns the franchise to its 2D action-platforming roots with a dash of roguelite gameplay. It&#x27;s set to enter Early Access on Steam on May 14.




Several rumors popped up around the internet this last week about a Prince of Persia game being developed by Evil Empire, best known for its popular roguelike metroidvania title Dead Cells. Now we not only know it&#x27;s real and titled The Rogue Prince of Persia, but we&#x27;ll be able to get our hands on it very soon as it enters its Early Access phase in just over a month.


The Rogue Prince of Persia takes place in a fictional rendition of Ctesiphon, the capital of the Persian Empire. The city is under invasion by the Hun&#x27;s army of possessed soldiers, and players must embody the Prince who is gifted with a mystical bola that resurrects him when he dies.


In classic Prince of Persia fashion, players will explore a plethora of biomes as they unlock new weapons, trinkets, and gear upgrades while trying to save the city from destruction.


It&#x27;s a great time to be a Prince of Persia fan. Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown was great, so getting another authentic PoP platformer just months later feels like we&#x27;re being a bit spoiled.


The Rogue Prince of Persia enters Early Access on Steam on May 14, and will release on other platforms at a later date.

                              <span>Like all frogs, King Croaker is a mage, and in AFK Journey, he is also one of the Dream Realm Elite Bosses. He combines defense, knockback, and AoE attacks to frustrate you. But here are some tips on how to beat him.


As I always note, your team composition is going to depend heavily on the heroes you pulled as part of the gacha mechanics, as well as what rarity you have built them to. You might not have a particular character that you’ll need to find a substitute for (maybe by checking out tier list), or you might have a high-rarity character that will be more effective than one of the suggested characters. This is more of a best-case scenario than the only way you can work this.

The game takes the city-building genre we all know and love and ascends it, quite literally, to the peaks of the mightiest mountains. Instead of crafting a small settlement in a forest before seeing it become a sprawling city, this game has you carve out an existence for a culture living in one of the harshest environments in the world.

                              <span>See how it runs on Switch.
Developer Awaceb has given us a release date for its lovely open-world adventure game Tchia, and it&#x27;ll be gliding onto the eShop on 27th June 2024.
Originally released on PC and PlayStation back in 2023, the Switch port of Tchia was announced in March 2024. Pre-orders are also available on the Switch eShop right now for $29.99 (or your regional equivalent). Alternatively, you can grab the Oléti Edition for $34.99, which comes with the added Kepler Customization Pack — this gives you four costume sets for Tchia and four kits to decorate your boat with.

Vampire Survivors is getting even more DLC on 9th May, but this one&#x27;s particularly exciting, as it&#x27;s teaming up with legendary Konami franchise Contra.
In Vampire Survivors: Operation Guns, you&#x27;ll be rescuing the President’s cousin’s sister’s dog from Red Falcon. Many classic Contra characters (even Brad Fang from Contra: Hard Corps) and weapons are entering the fray, and developer Poncle also promises a difficulty curve reminiscent of the arcade classic but blended with that roguelike gameplay from Vampire Survivors you know and love.

Hit indie deckbuilder Slay the Spire is getting a sequel, publisher and developer Megacrit has announced.
Named (appropriately) Slay the Spire 2, the game will be launching in Steam Early Access in 2025. Consoles have yet to be confirmed, but the first one eventually reached the Switch, so we can&#x27;t see this one skipping out on the hybrid — or a future console.

Announced during the Triple-i Initiative, The Rogue Prince of Persia is coming to Steam Early Access on 14th May 2024. Other platforms have not been announced yet, but we&#x27;re sure when the full release hits, we&#x27;ll be seeing it on Switch or a future Nintendo console.

Just before Gameloft&#x27;s fantasy racer speeds into its seventh season, it has been announced that Disney Speedstorm&#x27;s premium season pass will soon be available by &quot;direct purchase&quot; only and not redeemed with the earnable in-game currency.
To be clear, this mixes things up from what players have experienced up until this point. In the game&#x27;s opening six seasons, a paid season pass (&#x27;Golden Pass&#x27;) has always been an option and those wishing to upgrade from the free track to the premium version have been able to cash in their in-game currency (&#x27;Tokens&#x27;) to get involved.

                              <span>Ahhhhhhhhh...
When it comes to relaxing games, you probably already have a reasonably sound idea of what these might look like and entail. Perhaps it’s a jaunty farm sim like Stardew Valley or Story of Seasons, a laid-back puzzler like Unpacking, or even a cute adventure like A Short Hike. The point is that many of us have preconceived notions of what a relaxing game should look like, but if Ryan Janes’ ‘The Most Relaxing Video Games’ book is anything to go by, then blissful relaxation can potentially be found in the most unlikely genres imaginable.
Published by White Owl, an imprint of Pen &amp; Sword Books (which has also published books from the likes of Kirk McKeand and Chris Scullion), ‘The Most Relaxing Video Games’ immediately struck us as being geared toward those who perhaps don’t consider gaming to be their primary hobby. Indeed, for those of us at Nintendo Life, our first glimpse of the book consisted of casually flicking through the pages while muttering “Yep… Yep…” under our breath as we cross checked each entry with our own internally curated list.

The fourth entry in the Reigns narrative series, Reigns: Beyond ditches the more medieval setting of the previous games for an intergalatic adventure in which you journey across a range of planets with your very own rock band. You&#x27;ll be recruiting members as you go, playing shows, and of course, keeping your ship and crew in tip top condition.

Sega has released a brand new trailer for Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble ahead its expected launch on 25th June, 2024 exclusively on Switch.
This time, we&#x27;re focusing on the game&#x27;s Adventure Mode, which will be playable either solo or with up to 4 friends via co-op play. What&#x27;s particularly interesting with this one is that developer Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio has clearly taken inspiration from either Sonic or Marvel&#x27;s &#x27;Infinity Gauntlet&#x27; story arc, as it seems to entail a powerful artefact known as the &#x27;Legendary Banana&#x27; which is accesible after collecting seven coloured gems.

Remember when our lovely video producer Felix played through The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time for our YouTube series &#x27;First Bytes&#x27;? Well, after having such a rootin&#x27;-tootin&#x27; good time with it, he&#x27;s decided that the most sensible game to tackle next would be the direct sequel, The Legend of Zelda: Majora&#x27;s Mask. We wholeheartedly agree.
Undoubtedly one of the most divisive Zelda games in the franchise, Majora&#x27;s Mask is cited as either the very best that Nintendo has to offer, or derided for its polarising use of time loops. Now, we love it - obviously - but we&#x27;re certainly curious to find out what Felix will think when he embarks on this journey for the very first time.

                              <span>&quot;It felt like giving a little present back to the community&quot;.
With the 3DS and Wii U servers shutting down forever just a few days ago, a huge amount of DLC, digital-only games, and games reliant on online play have been lost to time. But one Dragon Quest fan sought to preserve all DLC for the 3DS remake of Dragon Quest VII — and they did it just in time.
Gronya, a Dragon Quest enthusiast and content creator, has preserved all 56 DLC maps — known as &#x27;tablets&#x27; in the game. These tablets are only accessible after completing the third island (at the earliest) with a handful locked to the post-game. Dragon Quest VII isn&#x27;t a short RPG, so trying to power through it before downloading all of them isn&#x27;t that easy.

We love a &quot;Year Of...&quot;. 10 years ago, Nintendo wrapped up the Year of Luigi and now, a decade on, it looks like SEGA is getting in on the action as it has declared 2024 the &quot;Year of Shadow&quot;.
Accompanied by a toe-curlingly cheesy trailer (above), the &#x27;Fearless&#x27; Year of Shadow is now underway. It even has its own website, that&#x27;s how official it is.

Masahiro Sakurai is back again with another YouTube video and this one is all about &#x27;using parameters&#x27; to keep characters feeling fresh.
As expected, the legendary game designer touches on examples from Kirby and Smash Bros. to illustrate his point, though it was his explanation of &quot;special attributes&quot; in Smash Ultimate&#x27;s DLC fighters that we found particularly interesting this time around.

                              <span>&quot;One must have good memory to keep the promises one makes&quot;.
Following a mysterious &#x27;walking sim&#x27; path similar to those trodden by The Stanley Parable and What Remains of Edith Finch, Slovenian developer Label This&#x27; debut game, The Gap, doesn’t necessarily feel like anything revolutionary, but it’s an engaging narrative experience that we’d suggest you consider picking up.
The plot here places you in the role of Josh, a highly respected neuroscientist who’s struggling with his marriage and family falling apart. Josh is doggedly pursuing something he’s called “The Cure” which he believes will save his family, though all his family sees is a man increasingly consumed and isolated by his ‘research’. The thing is, Josh has seemingly discovered the multiverse and a way of jumping into neighboring realities. This has left his mind profoundly broken, unable to easily discern between memory and reality after crossing dimensions. So, you set out to put together all the pieces and try to make sense not just of where Josh has come from, but where he may go if this cure he’s been after isn’t so fictional after all.

You have to give it to developers Storm Trident and G-Craft, these Front Mission 2: Remake updates are coming thick and fast. We thought that the base game was a little rough around the edges when it launched last year, though the devs have since added a lot of content in the ensuing months and the latest patch is available right now.
This ver. 1.0.5 update might not be quite as beefy as some that we have seen in the past, but there are still a couple of decent features to check out here, most notably the addition of a New Game Plus mode to keep you coming back for more.

The previous update claimed the project had reached an &quot;important&quot; milestone and now according to this latest report, the remake of the game has been completely &quot;remade from scratch&quot; but is still in the early stage of development.

However, EA has denied Grubb&#x27;s reporting, telling IGN, &quot;We don&#x27;t normally comment on rumors but there is no validity to this story.&quot; 
On Giant Bomb&#x27;s Game Mess Mornings show, Grubb said, &quot;They were working on it, they were working on Dead Space 2 and they are no longer working on it. It is on the shelf because the first game had lackluster sales, is how it was phrased to me.&quot;
He continues, adding, &quot;As it stands right now, they were working on it; it was in the concepting phase...pre-production, and now that work has been put on the shelf.&quot;

                              <span>V Rising rises from its Early Access coffin to launch into 1.0 on May 8 on PC. That same day, it will get a premium pack of Castlevania DLC. Dubbed V Rising: Legacy of Castlevania, this DLC includes new cosmetics that allow you to take on the aesthetics of hair, clothing, and forms of Konami&#x27;s Castlevania franchise, and it will give players the chance to fight Simon Belmont, too. 
As for what to expect, the Legacy of Castlevania Premium Pack will give players Alucard&#x27;s Cloak, Alucard&#x27;s Coat, Alucard&#x27;s Leggings, Alucard&#x27;s Gloves, and Alucard&#x27;s Boots. &quot;The complete set can be crafted in-game when you unlock the tailor bench,&quot; the DLC&#x27;s Steam description reads. &quot;It costs cloth and coarse thread to make and is purely cosmetic. Using the new armor customization feature, you can don the garb of the Vampire Prince at any level of your vampire journey.&quot; 
Check out the V Rising: Legacy of Castlevania Premium Pack DLC trailer for yourself below: 


We learned last month that V Rising is coming to PS5 later this year, and according to the trailer above, the Legacy of Castlevania DLC will be available on the platform when the base game launches on it. 
V Rising launches into 1.0 on PC on May 8.

                              <span>Developer Pocketpair has revealed Palworld Arena, a new Arena mode coming to the popular &quot;Pokémon With Guns&quot; survival game sometime this year. Pocketpair briefly pulled back the curtains on Palworld Arena during today&#x27;s Triple-i Initiative Showcase, which is where we saw some of the gameplay from the arena in action. 
If the trailer is any indication, it appears to support splitscreen co-op and gives players the chance to fight head-to-head in an arena to see whose party of Pals is the strongest. 
Check it out for yourself in the Palworld Arena trailer below: 


&quot;The Pal Arena makes its way to Palworld in 2024,&quot; the trailer&#x27;s description reads. &quot;Battle against other players, pitting both yourself and your pals against them. Train the strongest Pals and defeat all your rivals.&quot; 
That&#x27;s all we know about the Palworld Arena, but since it&#x27;s arriving this year, we might not have to wait too much longer to learn more. 
In the meantime, catch up on all things Palworld with Game Informer&#x27;s Palworld primer, and then read about the latest update, which added the first Raid boss to the game alongside additional Pal and base changes, and more.

When I had the chance to go hands-on with The Rogue: Prince of Persia, I had only watched the credits roll on Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown a few nights ago. Before that, the last time I watched credits roll on a new Prince of Persia game was in 2010 with The Forgotten Sands. I was surprised and happy to play a new excellent Prince of Persia game this year, but considering how long I had to wait for that one, I was not holding my breath for another – not even the Sands of Time remake I have been patiently waiting for.
Which is to say it was incredibly surprising when Ubisoft reached out about its new Prince of Persia rogue-lite. It’s not a mode in Lost Crown or a spinoff, as I initiall…</span>

                              <span>We went nearly 15 years without a wholly new Prince of Persia game after the release of The Forgotten Sands in 2010, but now, in 2024, we will play two brand new Prince of Persia games within six months of one another. The excellent Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown released in January, and today we learn about The Rogue: Prince of Persia, which will be entering early access in May.
The game comes from developer Evil Empire, the co-developer of Dead Cells, and the lineage shows. The game is a 2D platformer roguelike that has a lot in common with Dead Cells, but after spending some hands-on time with the game, it also has its own identity. Join Marcus Stewart and me as I share details about my hands-on experience with the next Prince of Persia.

                              <span>Developer Fumi Games and publisher PlaySide Publishing have released a new trailer for Mouse, the 1930s vintage cartoon-inspired FPS, and in it, we get gameplay featuring new traversal mechanics, power-ups, and more. Released during today&#x27;s Triple-i Initiative Showcase, this new Mouse gameplay trailer highlights the grappling hook, helicopter, and Spinach power-up. 
As you might expect, the grappling hook allows players to target designated points in a level for rapid movement and traversal. The helicopter adds vertical traversal to players&#x27; arsenal with reduced descent speed, and finally, the Spinach power-up augments and enhances melee combat (in a nod to Popeye). 
Check out the latest Mouse gameplay trailer for yourself below: 


&quot;Mouse is incredibly important to all of us here at Fumi Games, and we&#x27;re committed to making sure that it lives up to all of the expectations,&quot; Fumi Games CEO Mateusz Michalak writes in a press release. &quot;Our goal has always been to create a game that combines our passion for animation with our passion for first-person shooters. We are genuinely committed to collaborating closely with the Mouse community to craft a game that truly resonates with players. 
&quot;We&#x27;ll aim to share more details – whenever possible – as development progresses. Our partnership with PlaySide and our dedicated and talented team is working hard to bring you the finest grandboomer cartoon shooter ever created.&quot; 
Here are some new screenshots from Mouse for your viewing: 

Mouse was revealed back in 2023; it&#x27;s due out on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC in 2025.

Before that, though, Vampire Survivors will cross over with Contra in Operation Guns, a new DLC featuring characters, weapons, and more from the series, on May 9. 
This was revealed during today&#x27;s Triple-i Initiative Showcase with a new trailer highlighting what Contra in Vampire Survivors looks like, and perhaps to nobody&#x27;s surprise, it looks awesome. This trailer also reveals that PlayStation players can play Vampire Survivors this summer. The game is already available on Xbox, Switch, PC, and mobile devices. 
Check out the Vampire Survivors: Operation Guns and PlayStation reveal trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Operation Guns looks like an exciting boost of weaponry, characters, enemies, and more to Vampire Survivors. And it&#x27;s right around the corner, too, hitting the game on Xbox, PC, and Switch on May 9. It will presumably be available from the jump when Vampire Survivors hits PlayStation platforms later this summer.

                              <span>PlaySide Studios has revealed Kill Knight, a new Hades-inspired isometric arcade shooter coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC this year. Revealed with a gameplay trailer during today&#x27;s Triple-i Initiative Showcase, Kill Knight plunges players into an Eldritch abyss of horrors where waves of enemies stand in the way of their one goal: kill the last angel. 
&quot;Once a loyal knight, betrayed, and banished to the Abyss,&quot; a press release for Kill Knight reads. &quot;A desecrated corpse inside reanimated armor. You rise to an eternal death. Branded Kill Knight, you have one purpose – kill the last angel. Players must learn to exploit enemy weaknesses, enact brutal executions, and weave through the Knight&#x27;s Arsenal to tactically manage resources as they dance with death in the Abyss and take the fight to global leaderboards against friends and foes alike.&quot; 
Check out the Kill Knight reveal trailer for yourself below: 


In Kill Knight, players are challenged to master the demon within as they descend through the voids of an eldritch arena and harness a devastating arsenal of armor and weapons against swarms of otherworldly horrors. As you can see in the trailer above, Kill Knight features fast and visceral top-down arcade-action combat with a disgustingly horrific otherworld to traverse through. There are five fatal layers to get through, each more deadly than the last, according to PlaySide Studios. 
As you survive waves of enemies, your Kill Power will increase, which in turn increases your speed and damage. Plus, there are plenty of challenges to unlock your Knight&#x27;s Arsenal &quot;and evolve your playstyle.&quot; In Master Mode, all five layers become one extended arena, and you can track your skill on a global leaderboard, too. 
Here are some Kill Knight screenshots for your viewing: 

Kill Knights hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC this year.

                              <span>Developer Red Hook Studios has revealed Kingdoms, a new free game mode coming to Darkest Dungeon II later this year. In a race against the clock, Kingdoms challenges players with finding and defeating monstrous threats before they overwhelm the kingdom, which is spread across towns, safe haven inns, and more. 
Kingdoms will be free for all Darkest Dungeon II players on PC (the game is not available on consoles) and alongside new gameplay mechanics, it brings with it three new monster factions: The Coven, Beastmen, and Crimson Courtiers. Plus, Kingdoms can be played independently of the base &quot;Confessions&quot; campaign mode.

                              <span>Mega Crit Studios has announced Slay The Spire II, a sequel to its mega-popular roguelike deckbuilder Slay The Spire released in 2019. Since that original release, the game has made its way to various other platforms beyond PC, including PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and even mobile devices. Now, players can expect the sequel to hit Early Access (presumably on PC) starting next year. 
This news was announced during today&#x27;s Triple-i Initiative Showcase with a quick cinematic trailer highlighting the game&#x27;s beautiful animation. We see a few monstrous creatures and characters, presumably the ones we&#x27;ll control, before &quot;Slay The Spire II&quot; flashes on-screen. 
Check it out for yourself in the Slay The Spire II reveal trailer below: 


As you can see, this Slay The Spire II reveal trailer doesn&#x27;t contain any gameplay, but it does say the game hits Early Access in 2025.

                              <span>Danish developer Northplay and publisher Ghost Ship Publishing have revealed Dinolords, a medieval real-time strategy game where you fight Vikings and defend your lands alongside dinosaurs and more. In a new teaser trailer published during today&#x27;s Triple-i Initiative Showcase, we get glimpses of dino-powered armies, action RPG combat mixed with real-time strategy, and more. 
&quot;We&#x27;re honored to be showcasing our brand new trailer thanks to the Triple-i Initiative amongst so many incredible games and developers that make up the amazing indie corner of the games industry,&quot; Northplay CEO Michael Flarup writes in a press release. &quot;We&#x27;ve poured a lot of love into Dinolords and we can&#x27;t wait for players to get their hands on it when it launches into Early Access next year.&quot; 
Check out the new Dinolords reveal trailer for yourself below: 


Northplay says while mixing real-time strategy with action RPG gameplay, players will also have to gather resources, build cities, construct fortifications, and command units in widescale medieval warfare. 
Dinolords takes place in an alternate history in which the King of Denmark launches the first dinosaur-powered conflict with his invasion of England, according to a press release. Players take on the role of an English Lord, defending their land against the ferocious invaders and taming their own primeval beasts for battle.
Here are some Dinolords screenshots for your viewing: 

Dinolords is set to hit Early Access in 2025.

                              <span>Developer Wētā Workshop and publisher Private Division have announced the first trailer for Tales of the Shire, the cozy Middle-earth/Lords of the Rings-inspired game announced last year, is coming later this month. More specifically, we&#x27;ll finally get a good look at the Shire in the new trailer on April 22. 
Attention, dear Hobbits! Mark your calendars for our #TalesoftheShire trailer on April 22! pic.twitter.com/aZXvmR8qUs
April 10, 2024
As for what to expect, Wētā Workshop has shared little about the game beyond its initial reveal teaser. We know the game promises to let players live their best cozy Hobbit lives, and that sounds great on its own, but we&#x27;re excited to see what that entails from a gameplay perspective. If I had to guess, Tales of the Shire will fall somewhere between a life sim and a farming sim, akin to something like Animal Crossing but with Hobbits. 
Fortunately, we don&#x27;t have to wait too long to find out because the first trailer for Tales of the Shire arrives on Monday, April 22.

                              <span>Last year’s acclaimed Dave the Diver is coming to PlayStation next week on April 16. The scuba diving exploration/restaurant simulator has also been enhanced with a few Sony-exclusive perks.
Dave the Diver is also coming to PS4, but a new trailer shows off the PS5 version&#x27;s DualSense-specific features. That includes using the controller&#x27;s haptic feedback to &quot;sense the movements of the deep sea.&quot; The adaptive triggers add a kick to firing Dave&#x27;s speargun and a vibrating tension to the harpoon gun. Sound effects, such as phone call ringtones, are emitted through the controller speaker. 


Dave the Diver stars the titular diver as he explores undersea environments to locate and capture various marine species. After fishing, players then use these ingredients to operate a growing sushi restaurant.
As editor-in-chief Matt Miller wrote in his 8.75 out of 10 review, &quot;You might question whether a sushi restaurant management sim crossed with underwater diving is your cup of tea, but that would be missing the point. Dave the Diver is a unique and memorable vacation away from expectations, and it&#x27;s the very fact that you don&#x27;t usually play games like this that makes it so satisfying.&quot;
Dave the Diver is already available on Switch and PC, and has a Godzilla-themed crossover coming in May.</span>

                              <span>Sega has released a new gameplay trailer for the Adventure Mode in the upcoming Switch-exclusive Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble. In it, we get gameplay of the up-to-four-player mode that features 200 stages set across various different worlds, and it looks like a blast. 
Featuring both local and online four-player co-op, Adventure Mode will be available on day one when Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble launches on Switch on June 25. Optional assist features, like Rewind and Ghost Guide, allow players to customize how their monkey ball experience plays. 
Check it out for yourself in the new Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble: Adventure gameplay trailer below: 


&quot;While visiting a tropical island, AiAi and the gang meet a girl named Palette, an adventurer searching for the Legendary Banana,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;They agree to join her on her journey across wondrous worlds to collect special parts said to be the key to localizing this prized relic. Along the way, they&#x27;ll meet new friends and encounter mysterious rivals.&quot;
Adventure Mode features 200 new stages set across different worlds, such as Banana Farm, Rose Garden, Floating City, Golden Temple, and Stone Valley. Each brings its own unique twist and challenge to the Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble experience. 
In Adventure Mode, players can utilize the Rewind feature to rewind to a previous point of a stage and re-attempt a particularly challenging section. The Ghost Guide option adds a transparent monkey alongside the player that demonstrates how to proceed, while the Route Guide will point you in the right direction if you&#x27;re unsure of where to go. Plus, you can restart at any checkpoint within a stage at any time. 
Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble hits Switch on June 25.

                              <span>I am not a Fallout fan. I’ve always admired the games and dabbled with them for a few hours here and there, but it was never a series that inspired excitement in me. I am, however, a fan of the Fallout show’s creators, Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy. The two worked together on Westworld and though my fandom faded over time, I will always hold up the first season as some of my favorite television ever. I went into Amazon’s Fallout adaptation with unsure expectations. Video game movies and TV shows have improved in recent years, but I will always be hesitant. And time has frequently proven that one successful project from a creator (or a pair in this case) does not automatically equal success in another. Thankfully, however, the Fallout show is scary, violent, funny, weird, intriguing, reverent…</span>

                              <span>Today marks two years since the official reveal of Kingdom Hearts IV, and while Square Enix hasn&#x27;t shared any news about the game, fans of the series can celebrate with a new recording of the franchise&#x27;s best song by Hikaru Utada. As pointed out on X (formerly Twitter) by Genki_JPN, Utada&#x27;s new Science Fiction album, which they released yesterday, features a re-recording of &quot;Hikari,&quot; the Japanese version of &quot;Simple and Clean.&quot; 
If you&#x27;re a Kingdom Hearts fan, you likely already know which song this is. However, if you haven&#x27;t touched the series in a while, or if you&#x27;ve never played the beginning of Kingdom Hearts, it&#x27;s the Japanese version of the song in this famous game opener below: 


As for the new recording of &quot;Hikari,&quot; its place on Science Fiction makes sense because its Utada&#x27;s first greatest hits album, if you will, meant to act as a compilation with new mixes of old songs, re-recordings of fan-favorite tracks, and more. You can listen to the album, which features 26 tracks, starting today. 
If you&#x27;re interested in hearing the new recording of &quot;Hikari,&quot; you can listen below:

                              <span>Last time, you decided that shopkeepers annoyed when you don&#x27;t buy anything is better than security cameras following your every move. So rather than an implied surveillance which doesn&#x27;t actually have consequences, you wish to be actively scolded for things you&#x27;ve not done. Alright reader dear, I&#x27;m noting that in your psychological profile. Onwards! This week I ask you to choose between soaring through the sky or making something else soar. What&#x27;s better: gliding powers or Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2&#x27;s Unmaking Arrow?

Original story continues below
A remake of Dead Space 2 - following last year’s return of the original sci-fi survival-horror game - was reportedly in the works at EA, but has since been halted after the first game suffered underwhelming sales.

                              <span>We first learned of Spiritfarer studio Thunder Lotus&#x27; latest endeavour 33 Immortals at last year&#x27;s Summer Geoff Fest. They showed off some brief snippets of its 33-player cooperative roguelike-ing, where you&#x27;d beat up hellish monsters in a miniature take on MMO raids. If you were intrigued by it back then, I have good news. The Triple-i Initiative gave us more of a glimpse at how the game would look in the hands, with precious UI markers and the promise we&#x27;ll uncover new &quot;Torture Chambers&quot;. Lovely. No seriously, it does look quite lovely, if a touch predictable.

                              <span>In news that will come as a complete shock to all of you, Ubisoft is partnering with Evil Empire to bring the world a new Prince Of Persia roguelite - though according to Matthew Houghton, Evil Empire&#x27;s marketing manager, this has been in the works since a post-conference meeting conversation in 2021. Called The Rogue Prince Of Persia, a name choice that makes it sound a bit like an illegal knockoff being sold out of the back of Evil Empire&#x27;s Peugeot, I got to have a go of about 45 minutes of it last week. It&#x27;s 2D, side on platforming, and super colourful. Think Dead Cells skinned as a kids cartoon with a branded cereal tie-in, extremely cool music, and an emphasis on wall running. It&#x27;s mobile even by the standards of a platformer, in fact, and is entering Steam early access on May the 14th.

                              <span>Laysara: Summit Kingdom, a breathtakingly gorgeous city builder set in a fantasy world inspired by the Himalayan region, is out now in Steam early access. The meditative mountain environments are the sort of tranquil backdrop I’d happily stare out for hours, possibly with a Bonobo album and some incense, which is helpful, because the actual game is aiming to be quite a challenge.
According to its Steam page, the game “tasks you with creating a new home for your people forced out of the lowlands.” There are both campaign and sandbox modes, where you’ll establish multiple towns on multiple mountains, each with its own traits. “All your towns co-exist in symbiosis,” it continues, “creating a trading network, which you can then adjust to your needs by revisiting already developed settlements.” Here are some more deets, via Steam.

                              <span>There have been a lot of remakes that take provocative creative liberties with the original game of late. I&#x27;ve always felt like last year&#x27;s Darkest Dungeon 2 was secretly one of them. Rather than simply building on the previous game&#x27;s premise of a Hamlet&#x27;s worth of upgradeable, derangeable heroes venturing into tabletop RPG-style labyrinths, it stripped away Darkest Dungeon&#x27;s skin and moved its bones and organs around to create a gruelling roguelike. Well, developers Red Hook appear to have done it again with Darkest Dungeon 2&#x27;s free Kingdoms mode, out later this year, which slices open Darkest Dungeon 2&#x27;s hide and recomposes it into a turn-based strategy boardgame, where you defend a world map against encroaching eldritch creatures.

                              <span>Today is Tuesday, statistically the day of the week least rife with wacky hijinks, whimsical calamity, or even, dare I say, madcap antics. However, if you want to buck tradition, you could do worse than playing What the Car?, the upcoming absurdist physics game from What the Golf? and What the Bat? devs Triband. You can do it right now, actually. It’s just gotten a free demo on Steam, alongside a proper release date of September 5th 2024. Don’t do it if you’re actually driving, though. That’d be lunacy. We only promote the fun kind of lunacy here, like the type shown off in What the Car?’s trailer at the Triple-i initiative.

                              <span>Revealed at the Triple-I Initiative just now, Vampire Survivors is getting another cool DLC, this one a crossover with classic Konami run &#x27;n&#x27; gun Contra. It&#x27;s called Operation Guns. Get on board. Trailed with, as is now traditional, a cool animated trailer that suggests the game is a Saturday morning cartoon and not a top down pixelated nightmare that will flush out any latent photosensitivity lurking in your skull (complimentary), Operation Guns is arriving on May 9th, so about a month away.

Slay The Spire II was announced during today&#x27;s Triple-i Initiative stream, returning to the towering fantasy city where Steam says I&#x27;ve spent more than 300 hours building decks and battling monsters. While the announcement doesn&#x27;t reveal much about the sequel, Slay The Spire is still my favourite roguelikelike deck-builder, so that&#x27;s just grand.

                              <span>Today’s the birthday of the Triple-I Initiative, a 45-minute showcase of game announcements and trailers from the likes of Slay The Spire devs MegaCrit, Darkest Dungeon devs Red Hook and Dead Cells custodians Evil Empire. What makes a “triple-I” game a “triple-I” game, as opposed to (hawk, spit) a regular indie? I&#x27;ve given it some thought, and I think the answer is: &quot;has more money and status than most indies, but not, like, Call of Duty levels, and also one of our partners is Gearbox Publishing, so this is perhaps ‘indie’ in the Geoff Keighley sense.&quot;
Don’t expect any of Keighley&#x27;s beloved Kojima interludes or dance numbers in this one, however. The IIIIs are a leaner, quieter showcase with no host or advertising or celebrity drop-ins – you can read more about the thinking behind the event in my GDC interview with a few of the participating studios. Find the full stream below.

                              <span>Drop Bear Bytes, the studio behind post-apocalyptic RPG Broken Roads, are named after Australia’s deadliest creature. The Drop Bear might look like a normal koala, but they’re actually dangerous predators, fond of jumping from trees to maul unsuspecting chumps who forget to take adequate precautions, like urinating on themselves. Really, the story is a wind-up the aussies like to blag tourists with. If it looks like a koala, it’s just a koala. But it’s this sort of character, inspired by love for Australia’s unique landscape, culture and good-natured mick-taking, that forms the heart of the best bits in Broken Roads. I say ‘best bits’, but I should probably say ‘the only bits that I actually enjoyed’, unfortunately.
Bombs wiped out 80% of Australia’s population, and left the remaining nail-hard Nancys and tough Tobiases to fend for themselves in a world short of resources, but shockingly plentiful in both guns and pre-made Vegemite sarnies. You’ll pick one of four character classes - I went with ‘Jackaroo’ (cattle hand), because it was called ‘Jackaroo’ - before tackling a short tutorial section. You&#x27;ll then be thrust into some events, where you’ll meet the rest of your starting party and kick off the game proper.

                              <span>Last week I went to a screening of Amazon and Bethesda&#x27;s Fallout TV show, a spin-off yarn starring Ella Purnell (who voiced Jinx in the Arcane Netflix adaptation) as a recently surfaced Vault Dweller, scouring the irradiated wastelands for [SPOILERS REDACTED]. It&#x27;s early days, but the show&#x27;s first two episodes didn&#x27;t make a massive impression on me, though I will concede that the sight of Amazon&#x27;s branding on Fallout&#x27;s infamous Please Stand By emergency broadcast titlecard makes a dangerous amount of sense.

                              <span>Elon Musk&#x27;s social media platform X has denied all copyright infringement claims in response to a &#x27;piracy&#x27; complaint filed last year by a group of record labels. The Nashville federal court already dismissed several key allegations and X hopes to defeat the remaining contributory infringement claims as well. Among its defenses, X notes that the music companies demand &quot;unconstitutionally excessive and disproportionate&quot; damages.

                              <span>Ubisoft Massive&#x27;s open world action-adventure Star Wars Outlaws will release on 30th August 2024, according to a new story trailer which introduces us properly to &quot;emerging scoundrel&quot; Kay Vess, aka Hannah Solo. If you haven&#x27;t had the pleasure, Kay is a budding crook on the run from her underworld boss, a journey that sees her tangling with several other Star Wars crime syndicates on various planets. It really feels like they&#x27;re keeping a lot of the headline Star Wars stuff at a respectful distance for this one: yes, Jabba the Hutt makes an appearance, but there&#x27;s nary a whiff of The Force, Jedi or Sith in the trailer and not once does anybody build a Death Star.

                              <span>If you&#x27;re from the USA, Britain or France, and also possibly a Victorian time-traveller, you might be familiar with the dunce cap - a conical humiliation bestowed on struggling or misbehaving schoolchildren, who were then told to go sit in the corner and think about their sins. Well, get ready for the dunce cosmetic. In Sumo Newcastle&#x27;s Deathsprint 66, an 8-player on-foot racing game based on Stephen King&#x27;s dystopian novel The Running Man, players build a Hype multiplier by combo-ing stunts such as railgrinds, and also, murdering each other.

                              <span>In many ways Children Of The Sun is a highly relatable game. I do not have telekinetic powers that allow me to control the path of a bullet from a sniper rifle, and I was not part of a murderous cult that killed my father-figure. But if I did and I were, you can bet that I&#x27;d go on a rip-roaring rampage of revenge! Stepping into the be-grimed trainers and unwashed jacket of the protagonist - a misused girl whose vibe is that of a member of Gorillaz - you shoot a single bullet from your gun and control it in first-person as you zip it through the heads, hearts and hands of cultists placed around a level. It&#x27;s a satisfying Sniper Elite meets Superhot puzzle of ultraviolence, and it&#x27;s neat.

                              <span>Sega and Creative Assembly have released the first proper trailer for Total War: Warhammer 3&#x27;s forthcoming Thrones of Decay expansion, which pits the human Empire, Chaos Nurgle faction and industrious Dwarfs against each other in what the press release terms &quot;a showdown of mohawks, maggots and machines&quot;. Alliteration, is it? Well, two can play at that (strategy) game: the new expansion explodes upon the extensive environments of this elaborate ex-tabletop experience with an eccentric... ensemble of new legendary lords, battle units and campaign features, plus various free bits for owners of the base game.


9-3 to me, Creative Assembly! Find the Thrones of Decay trailer below - sorry, I just need a few minutes to massage my temples.

                              <span>Rebecca (RPS in peace) was our resident monsterfucenjoyer for a while, and she was well up for Sucker For Love: First Date, but was slightly disappointed that as a horror-themed dating sim it leaned away from the dating and well into the horror. Now the sequel, Sucker For Love: Date To Die For has revealed a release date of April 23rd, and seems to be leaning into horror even more, while also still being a dating sim featuring an eldritch goat god with massive cans. Yet the presser also says &quot;no scares this time&quot;. I am confused, which is why it&#x27;s probably good there&#x27;s a demo on Steam to sort of give you a taster.

                              <span>Ahhh League Of Legends, a MOBA that occupied my university years. While I&#x27;d argue climbing the ranked ladder with my housemates were some of the best game moments I&#x27;ve ever had, I&#x27;d also argue giving up League was necessary. I became too involved, too close to the toxicity. But now League&#x27;s threatening to drag me back in with something I hadn&#x27;t seen coming - a Vampire Survivors-like PVE mode. No! I must resist (I will be on it immediately when it arrives).

Man, it feels like only yesterday I equipped something without looking and suddenly everything that damaged me caused me to teleport at random. I flew through entire levels this way like a Tardis set to shuffle, bumbling into one enemy posse after another, granted a few seconds at a time to assess my surroundings before the sorcery swept me deeper.

                              <span>Bungie has released a new trailer for Destiny 2&#x27;s next expansion, The Final Shape, and it includes gameplay of Guardians wielding both light and darkness at once, new weapons and enemies, and more. This trailer was part of a wider information blitz surrounding The Final Shape, which promises to conclude the decade-long War of Light and Darkness story arc, where we also learned more about The Witness and additional exotics. 
Unveiled last August and originally set to launch in February before getting delayed to June 4, The Final Shape is shaping up (pun intended) to be one of the biggest expansions for Destiny 2 yet. It&#x27;s fitting, considering the story players have been enjoying for 10 years is set to wrap up in it.

The game received a lot of hype when it was first revealed during last summer&#x27;s Xbox Games Showcase and its subsequent gameplay footage during a Ubisoft Forward stream the next day. Today&#x27;s story trailer not only gave us more to whet our appetite but also let us know when we&#x27;ll finally be able to step into the role of Kay Vess as we navigate the Star Wars underworld.
Star Wars Outlaws puts you in the role of Kay Vess, a pickpocket turned thief who gets mixed up with Sliro, the leader of Zerek Besh, a new criminal syndicate. Sliro places a bounty on Kay&#x27;s head, and Kay and Nix have one shot at freedom: pulling off the ultimate heist. Together, Kay and Nix must navigate th…</span>

The Original Trilogy inspired countless other pieces of media and the subsequent releases have all been noteworthy for one reason or another. But it was the Original Trilogy that developer Massive Entertainment – the team behind games like The Division, The Division 2, and Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora – chose to make its playground. We traveled to the coastal city of Malmö, Sweden, to learn all about the open-world scoundrel adventure set in a galaxy far, far away.

Although Aang doesn&#x27;t fully appear in the trailer, he&#x27;ll become available as part of the event pass (thanks, Forbes) with he and Toph looking a bit taller than they do on the show (likely to fit the game&#x27;s hitboxes). Aang also comes with a separate Avatar State skin.

                              <span>Motive Studio, the EA team behind last year&#x27;s Dead Space remake and its in-development Iron Man game, has revealed it is forming a new internal team to support the Battlefield franchise. Motive will help develop future Battlefield experiences as it continues to work on its Iron Man game with Marvel, which it says has hit a &quot;major internal milestone.&quot; 
This news comes from a new blog post by Motive&#x27;s general manager, Patrick Klaus, where he also reveals the directors behind the studio&#x27;s Dead Space remake – executive producer Philippe Ducharme and creative director Roman Campos-Oriola – will build a new team to work alongside EA&#x27;s Battlefield studios. 


&quot;Their proven expertise in storytelling, immersive battles, and developing on the Frostbite engine uniquely positions them to help advance the vision for Battlefield, led by Vince Zampella (EVP, group general manager for Respawn and Battlefield) and Byron Beede (SVP, general manager for Battlefield). 
&quot;In parallel, development continues to move forward on our Iron Man project, led by Olivier Proulx (executive producer) and Ian Frazier (creative director). The team made excellent progress this year, hitting a major internal milestone and laying a robust foundation for the journey ahead. Iron Man is an important priority for Motive, and I&#x27;m very proud of the work we&#x27;ve accomplished so far.&quot; 
Motive will work with other EA studios like Criterion, DICE, and Ripple Effect to further expand the company&#x27;s Battlefield franchise, which saw its last entry, Battlefield 2042, released in 2021. In 2022, we learned the next Battlefield game had entered pre-production with plans to take &quot;valuable lessons&quot; learned from Battlefield 2042 into the game&#x27;s development.

                              <span>Ermac is the next fighter to join the Mortal Kombat 1 roster, and developer NetherRealm Studios has released a new gameplay trailer showcasing what players can expect of the shadowy warrior. The trailer also reveals Ermac hits Early Access on April 16 before his full release on April 23, and that Mavado will join the Kameo roster later next month. 
&quot;Ermac is a collection of souls bound together by Quan Chi&#x27;s dark magic that are intended to function as a group mind,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;But that spell is temporarily undone when Ermac is defeated by Mileena and the mind of King Jerrod, deceased ruler of Outworld and one of the souls in Ermac&#x27;s collection, takes control and rejoins the royal family, aiding Empress Mileena&#x27;s reign. 
&quot;Eventually, the amalgam of souls re-establishes control, and Ermac retreats to Outworld&#x27;s shadows. No longer Quan Chi&#x27;s slave, nor bound to the royal family, he must find a future worth fighting for.&quot;
Check out Ermac in the Mortal Kombat 1 gameplay trailer below: 


To get Ermac, purchase the Premium Edition of Mortal Kombat 1 or buy the Kombat Pack for your Standard Edition of the game. The Kombat Pack indudes a Jean-Claude Van Damme character skin for Johnny Cage (available now) and one-week early access to six playable DLC characters: Omni-Man (available now), Quan Chi (available now), Peacemaker (available now), Ermac (coming April 16), Homelander, and Takeda Takahashi. The Kombat Pack includes all five DLC Kameo fighters, too.

                              <span>In March 2023, Dredge became one of the most talked-about games of the year thanks to its combination of engaging fishing mechanics, an enthralling atmosphere, and a fun story involving sinister secrets buried at sea. Ahead of the BAFTA Awards on Thursday, at which Dredge is nominated for four awards, developer Black Salt Games has announced a collaboration with production company Story Kitchen to adapt the critically acclaimed title into a live-action feature film.
In the game, players explore a mysterious archipelago as a fishing boat captain. However, the longer you play, the more unsettling the water surrounding the collection of remote islands becomes. The press release pitches the Dredge live-action film, saying, &quot;Think The Sixth Sense on the water. A grounded atmospheric cosmic horror blend of HP Lovecraft and Ernest Hemingway.&quot;
&quot;We are excited to partner with such an experienced studio team to bring the world we created to live action and ignite the imagination of audiences across the globe,&quot; a joint statement from the Black Salt Games team said in that same press release.
Story Kitchen was founded in 2022 by Sonic the Hedgehog 2 producer Dmitri M. Johnson, former APA Agent Mike Goldberg, and their production and development executives Timothy I. Stevenson and Dan Jevons. &quot;Dredge is a captivatingly eerie and profoundly rich story that had us completely hooked from the very beginning,&quot; a joint statement from Story Kitchen said in the press release.
Dredge currently has an 80 out of 100 rating on the reviews aggregate website Metacritic. If you missed it, it is currently available for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.</span>

Yesterday, players celebrated what they thought was the complete eradication of the Automaton Legion in Helldivers 2. The official Helldivers 2 X (formerly Twitter) account even tweeted about players&#x27; success in the galaxy. Now, roughly a day later, the Automatons have returned. 
&quot;Somehow, the Automatons returned. As suspected all along, the previous Bot force was merely a vanguard. A massive fleet how now begun an assault on Cyberstan and the surrounding planets. Helldivers, hold back this unprovoked invasion. The fight continues!&quot;
Somehow, the Automatons returned.

                              <span>Amazon Studios&#x27; Fallout TV series will premiere one day early, with all eight episodes now hitting Prime Video on April 10 at 6 p.m. PT/9 p.m. ET. The series was originally due out on April 12 but Amazon announced it had moved the launch day up to April 11 alongside a new look at the show. Now, Amazon has moved the date up one more day, meaning you can check out this live-action adaptation of the post-apocalyptic wasteland tomorrow. 
Walton Goggins, who plays The Ghoul, announced this news during a new Fallout commercial that aired last night (April 8) during the NCAA Men&#x27;s Basketball Championship Game. After the first episode airs at 6 p.m. PT/9 p.m. ET tomorrow, the other seven episodes will be available for viewing exclusively on Prime Video in more than 240 countries and territories worldwide. 
If you haven&#x27;t yet seen it, check out the latest Fallout trailer for a new look at the show: 


&quot;Based on one of the greatest video game series of all time, Fallout is the story of haves and have-nots in a world in which there&#x27;s almost nothing left to have,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;Two hundred years after the apocalypse, the gentle denizens of luxury fallout shelters are forced to return to the irradiated hellscape their ancestors left behind – and are shocked to discover an incredibly complex, gleefully weird, and highly violent universe waiting for them.&quot; 
Amazon Studios, which is behind series like The Boys and Invincible, is producing Fallout alongside Kilter Films and executive producers Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy. Nolan directed the first three episodes of Fallout. 
Fallout premieres on Prime Video on April 10. 
For more, check out the teaser trailer for Fallout released back in December. After that, read Game Informer&#x27;s reviews of Fallout 4 and Fallout 76.

But, excitement for No Rest for the Wicked aside, both Marcus and I are big fans of the team&#x27;s Ori series, which began with Ori and the Blind Forest in 2015 and continued in the 2020 sequel, Ori and the Will of the Wisps.

But in a new interview with Game Informer, the developer revealed that it has some &quot;ideas&quot; for a future Ori 3.
Talking to co-founder Gennadiy Korol and CEO and creative director Thomas Mahler, Game Informer asked about the potential for a third game in the Ori series.

                              <span>Canada&#x27;s piracy-blocking efforts continue, with rightsholders applying for a new court order aimed at preventing live sports piracy. Bell, Rogers, Fubo TV and others request new measures to block infringing IP addresses during NHL, NBA, and Premier League games. With a new approach, they hope to have broad and flexible blocking measures in place before the end of the 2023/2024 seasons.

With Gaudi 3 comes some rather bold AI claims from Intel: 50% on average better inference and 40% on average better power efficiency than the NVIDIA H100. All while costing &quot;a fraction&quot; of the NVIDIA H100. Gaudi 3 sounds quite promising and will be interesting to see how its adopted in the marketplace. In addition, Intel also is disclosing the new Xeon 6 branding for their upcoming server processors formerly codenamed Sierra Forest and Granite Rapids.</span>

                              <span>Last summer, we sat down with Sonic Team Creative Officer Takashi Iizuka to discuss his multi-decade career at Sega. We learn about his childhood fascination with becoming a manga artist, the transition from college life to working at Sega, and his early career developing games like Devi and Pii, Golden Axe 3, and Sonic the Hedgehog 3. Iizuka remembers the excitement and challenge during the transition from the Sega Genesis (known as the Sega Mega Drive in Japan) to the Sega Saturn, which allowed the team progress from 2D pixel art to 3D polygonal modeling.
Notably, the Sonic the Hedgehog lead reflects on the early Dreamcast days, moving to the United States to better implement western culture into Sonic Adventure 2, and finally, describes his emotions after hearing Sega was exiting the hardware business and ending production of the Dreamcast.

                              <span>Fallout, Amazon Prime’s TV adaptation of Bethesda’s popular RPG, is set to premiere this week on April 11. However, it looks like a second season is already in the works. 
Variety reports (thanks, Eurogamer) that The California Film Commission has awarded $152 million in tax incentives to a dozen TV shows across various studios to lure production of those series into the state. $25 million of these tax credits has been allocated to Fallout&#x27;s second season, so production is now expected to take place in California. Fallout’s $153 million budget is the largest of any show on this list
Season 1 was largely filmed in New York, with some production in Utah. However, as Variety notes, receiving this tax credit does not guarantee Amazon will accept it and relocate Fallout&#x27;s production to California for Season 2.


Fallout premieres on Amazon Prime Video on Thursday, April 11. The eight-episode series is directed by Westworld showrunners Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy, with Bethesda head Todd Howard serving as executive producer. The cast includes Ella Purnell, Walton Goggins, Kyle MacLachlan, and Aaron Moten. The show’s synopsis reads

                              <span>Bandai Namco, the publisher of Elden Ring and the developer behind this year&#x27;s Tekken 8, has quietly released three small 3D platformers for free. Available to download right now on Steam, Nottolot, Doronko Wanko, and Boomeroad are 3D platformers released on March 26, and all three were developed by Bandai Namco, as pointed out by Dominic Tarason on X (formerly Twitter). 
In Nottolot, a free-play robot hacking action game, players control Rolly, who uses a hacking ability to control four enemies and escape from a robot production factory. There are 52 reviews for it on Steam so far, giving the game a &quot;Very Positive&quot; rating.


Boomeroad is described as an exhilarating action-adventure game in which players slide along boomerang rails they create. &quot;The game is set in an ancient ruin floating…</span>

                              <span>It’s odd to think back on a time before Baldur’s Gate 3 - and even stranger to think that the sprawling Dungeons &amp; Dragons RPG was actually kicking around for a long while before its 1.0 release blew up awards shows, social media feeds and fan-fiction hubs last summer. Putting the game out into early access at the end of 2020 - multiple years before it was ready for a full release - worked out very well for Larian though, so it’s maybe no surprise that they plan to do exactly the same with whatever comes next.

                              <span>Buckshot Roulette is simple, and simply unsettling. Sat across the table from a mysterious opponent clad in a deeply unnerving toothy mask, you pick up a shotgun loaded with shells. Then, you decide whether to point the gun at your opponent or yourself, and pull the trigger. Some of the shells are live, and others are blanks. Guess correctly, and you get to go again.

News of Sam Fisher’s return first snuck out at the end of 2021, with little more spotlight than a brief blog post to confirm that, yep, it’s a thing. After over two years of near-silence, it now looks like it might finally be time for Sam to emerge out of the shadows.

                              <span>Deep Rock Galactic&#x27;s Season 5 update - which launches in June 2024 - will allow you to reactivate and replay old seasons of Ghost Ship&#x27;s celebrated dwarven asteroid mining sim. Here&#x27;s how that works, direct from the bellowing bearded faces of the developers themselves. By which I mean, a new Steam blog. I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s possible to get a good dwarven bellow going when you&#x27;re talking about cosmetic unlock progression, but by all means reorganise this article into some kind of drinking song. Keep it clean, though - there may be elves reading.

                              <span>The deck-fixing roguelikelike poker of Balatro is chuffing excellent, no doubt, but my main criticism has been that the higher difficulty modes are just a bit boring. Having beat them myself, I didn&#x27;t find them a fun or interesting challenge as much as an annoying one that required too much to go right. I&#x27;m glad to hear that they&#x27;re being tweaked in an upcoming patch, which you can now test in a public beta on Steam, and even the lowest difficulty setting will be tweaked. Other changes include improved (hopefully) Steam Deck performance, balance tweaks, and better Joker-related Tags.

                              <span>When Bethesda was working out how to turn their popular Elder Scrolls RPGs into an online behemoth to rival World Of Warcraft back in the late 00s, the initial pitch was &quot;Elder Scrolls with friends,&quot; creative director Rich Lambert tells me. A simple idea on paper, perhaps, but one that proved to be a lot more complicated in the realisation of it. Zenimax Online Studios was founded in 2007, a year after The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion landed to universal critical praise, but it wasn&#x27;t until seven years later that The Elder Scrolls Online finally released for PC in 2014. At launch &quot;we were walking this weird line between &#x27;online game&#x27; and &#x27;Elder Scrolls game&#x27;,&quot; Lambert says. &quot;We didn&#x27;t do either of them particularly well.&quot;
Ten years later, though, The Elder Scrolls Online is thriving. At last count, the game has over 24 million players galloping about the plains of Tamriel, and later this June, it will receive its eighth major Chapter expansion, Gold Road, which adds Oblivion&#x27;s West Weald to the game and wraps up the mystery of the new Daedric Prince that arrived at the end of the previous expansion, Necrom. But the path ESO has taken to get here hasn&#x27;t been nearly as glittering, with its PC launch in particular generating &quot;a lot of feedback&quot;, as studio director Matt Firor told press at the game&#x27;s tenth anniversary event last week. In fact, it wasn&#x27;t until ESO came to consoles in 2015 that the game really found its voice, says Lambert. &quot;We had to really figure out what we wanted to be, and we chose &#x27;Elder Scrolls&#x27;. As soon as we hit that core pillar of &#x27;It&#x27;s Elder Scrolls first, online second,&#x27; then it really just helped inform everything we&#x27;ve done since.&quot; Trouble is, when the thrust of ESO&#x27;s development straddled the launch of two very different Elder Scrolls games, even nailing down that first part of the pillar proved to be more challenging than expected.

                              <span>Botany Manor is a game that seems calculated to make me sit up on alert like a meerkat, or crash through a wall yelling like that sentient jug mascot (I am not from America, I just know he exists). It&#x27;s a puzzle game about growing plants. Holy Strange Horticulture, Batman! But Botany Manor is much less eldritch, and much more gentle historical feel-good movie starring Emma Thompson in the lead role. That role - which in this case is played by you in first person rather than La Thompson - is of Arabella Greene, a retired botanist who, thank God, is the childless inheritor of a huge manor and ancestral wealth, and so is able to spend the sunny days of 1890 pottering around the house and grounds researching weird, slightly fantastical plants almost wholly untroubled. So in this respect it is also a fantasy game. It&#x27;s quite delightful, which is the sort of phrase I am confident Arabella would use.

                              <span>I know some of you will quibble with the headline, so let me confirm straight away that, yes, technically Aquarist is not a game simulating being an aquarium. An aquarist is someone who builds and manages aquariums, which is your principle task in the capital A Aquarist game. It recently left early access, which is sort of unbelievable because it&#x27;s very janky in the most adorable way. You can tell it was made by someone who bloody loves aquariums, but taken at face value the career mode tells a strange tale indeed. For example, you have a very unsettling father.

                              <span>According to one unofficial tracker created by video game artist Farhan Noor, there have been 8000 layoffs in 2024 so far, following an estimated 10,500 layoffs in 2023. The leaders of Microsoft, Embracer Group, Epic and other industry giants have made swingeing cuts to their workforces. While larger companies have inevitably seen the largest reductions, many smaller developers and publishers have also cut staff or even closed their doors. Circumstances vary by company, of course, but as regards the biggest publishers, there are some broad overlapping causes: reckless or, if you prefer, &quot;overambitious&quot; expansion and overhiring during the pandemic lockdown gaming boom; lower-than-hoped returns on new technologies and business models such as NFTs; and rising global interest rates, which have scared away potential investors.
The carnage was uppermost in Larian CEO&#x27;s Swen Vincke&#x27;s mind when he accepted Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3&#x27;s Best Narrative gong at the GDC Awards last month. According to Vincke, the layoffs can be traced straightforwardly to a pattern of executive greed that sees company leadership betting the livelihoods and stability of their workers on whatever new idea seems capable of delivering instant growth for shareholders.

                              <span>A couple of months ago, we learned that Raven Software lead designer Michael Gummelt had worked on a live service Call Of Duty zombies game before it got cancelled. Details were practically non-existent at the time, but YouTuber Glitching Queen recently interviewed Gummelt about what the game could&#x27;ve become. Fun surprises: It would&#x27;ve been a free-to-play live service game featuring coliseum battles. Unsurprises: microtransactions, seasons, general background shenanigans between Treyarch and Raven.

The hint at some long term wish fulfillment came up during an interview with The Gamer’s Gabrielle Castania, in which Naoki ‘Yoshi-P’ Yoshida spoke about Final Fantasy 16’s upcoming The Rising Tide DLC, alongside DLC director Takeo Kujiraoka and localisation director Michael-Christoper Koji Fox.

The company has a library of millions of fingerprints that can detect infringing videos on platforms including VK, Dailymotion and Vimeo.  Rightsholders, including a major Hollywood studio, already use its technology. Eventually, the company hopes that its &#x27;ContentCore&#x27; solution will be used as an independent &#x27;Content ID&#x27; equivalent, converting &#x27;piracy&#x27; into revenue.

                              <span>Total Eclipse, a real-time, curse-breaking, 3D adventure (with a dash of Indiana Jones flair), is ready for public testing!
Originally unleashed by Incentive Software Ltd. in 1988, Total Eclipse added yet another groundbreaking title to their repertoire of revolutionary games.
Step into the shoes of a heroic archeologist on October 26, 1930, as a total solar eclipse akin to the one happening today over North America looms over Cairo. Knowing of the Ardognus prophecy, created by the powerful high priest Hahmid III, you must find and destroy the hidden shrine devoted to Ra before the eclipse occurs.
Embark on this exciting journey packed with a trusty gun for blasting through doors or dispatching undead mummies; a compass to guide you through a treacherous pyramid; a wristwatch to track the precious time left; and a water bottle to fight dehydration (you’re only human after all). 
Can you solve this ancient mystery within 120 minutes and avert catastrophe, or will Rah&#x27;s wrath obliterate the moon?
Our modern reimplementation of the Freescape engine features graphics using hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Total Eclipse support includes DOS (EGA/CGA modes), ZX Spectrum, and Amstrad CPC. More releases are coming at a later date. Additionally, there are three playable demos if you want to test the game. Please contact us if you have some other release or demo.
To play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.

Early copies include a tribute to the busted release group EVO, which leaked the first Dune film back in 2021.

                              <span>After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora&#x27;s Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora&#x27;s Mask&#x27;s unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 2 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved.

                              <span>Publisher Ubisoft and developer Massive Entertainment has revealed that a new Star Wars Outlaws story trailer will be released next week. We&#x27;ll be seeing more of protagonist Kay Vess and her trusty (and adorably cute) companion Nix on Tuesday, April 9, at 9 a.m. PT/Noon ET. 
As for what to expect, Ubisoft hasn&#x27;t shared anything in that regard. It simply says the story trailer is arriving next week and that it will be published on YouTube. 
Watch the World Premiere of the Star Wars Outlaws Story Trailer. Join us at 9AM PST / 6PM CET.
April 5, 2024
This story trailer is our next taste of Star Wars Outlaws, an open-world adventure set between Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back and Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi. It was announced during an Xbox Games Showcase last June and further showcased with gameplay at a Ubisoft Forward the same month. You can read more about the game in our preview of it here, and you can read this exclusive interview with the game&#x27;s narrative director about what to expect. 
Star Wars Outlaws is due out sometime this year on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.

                              <span>Front Mission 2: Remake is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC later this month. More specifically, the previously Switch-exclusive remake will hit these new platforms on April 30. 
Released back in October on Switch, Front Mission 2: Remake is the first time Western players have been able to play through this tactics/strategy RPG since the game&#x27;s original Japan-only release in 1997. It&#x27;s set 12 years after Front Mission 1st: Remake, which hit Switch in November 2022 and other platforms in June of last year, and puts players in control of Ash, an O.C.U soldier trying to escape the overrun nation of Alordesh. However, in this escape, Ash learns of a much broader conspiracy. 
Check out the Front Mission 2: Remake release date trailer for yourself below: 


Like the Switch version, Front Mission 2: Remake on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC features improved loading times compared to the original, free camera movement, a revamped soundtrack, new customization options, and extra language support. 
Starting April 15, PC players can check out a free demo of Front Mission 2: Remake on Steam. Developer and publisher Forever Entertainment says saved game data from the demo will carry over to the full game upon its release later this month. 
Front Mission 2: Remake hit Switch back in October; it hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on April 30.

Codenamed Project Apollo, this Nolanverse Batman game would have featured the likeness of Christian Bale&#x27;s Dark Knight, the &quot;Tumbler&quot; Batmobile, plenty of gadgets, and a unique spin on the Caped Crusader&#x27;s detective work.

The layoffs come just a week after the studio announced their sale from former owners Sega, returning them to independence after two decades.

                              <span>I think we might be nearing the point where there are Too Many Retro Zeldalikes, and specifically Too Many Link’s Awakealikes – recent candidates include Isles Of Sea And Sky and Blossom Tales - but I’m definitely willing to go adventuring with Castaway, in which you are a spaceman called Martin who has crashlanded on an island’s worth of gently rounded, 8-bit scenery. 
Martin’s goal is to rescue his pet dog, which doesn’t sound like it’ll take too long – the “concise and delightful” story mode boasts just three bosses. But lurking behind that all-too-innocent story mode there is a Biblical terror in the shape of a 50-floor tower, made up of increasingly challenging trials. Link’s Awakening with a sort of Bloody Palace component? Yeah, I’ll take that.

                              <span>Fulqrum Publishing have just released a story trailer for New Arc Line, a new steampunk fantasy RPG in which dragons rub shoulders with zeppelins, and dwarves are as abundant as air pollution. I hadn&#x27;t heard of it before and am quite interested, partly because the game sports some wonderfully mangled and colourful dystopian maps, and partly because it&#x27;s a story of immigrants trying to find their way to an inevitably deceptive &quot;shining city of progress&quot;, rather than the typical Chosen One fare.
Your family specifically are afflicted by a fatal disease. Your initial and perhaps overall goal in New Arc Line is to find a cure, of course, but who knows, along the way you might have to &quot;get your hands dirty&quot;, &quot;rise from the bottom&quot; and become some sort of absolute bastard. Take us away, trailer!

                              <span>In the dingy portside taverns that pop up, seemingly unbidden, like roiling blisters along the coastal towns of the Old World, the name Count Noctilus is spoken only in hushed whispers by those blasted enough on grog to forget themselves. They are sure to be swiftly rebuked by their fellows for playing dice with fate, those still of sound mind rightly afeared that the name may echo through the brine and tickle the ears of the dread captain himself. On the seas he calls kingdom, Noctilus is without equal, without mercy, and utterly without hesitation. For what has a dead man left to fear?
He has but one fatal flaw; he is deathly afraid of ever leaving his comfortable ship to touch ‘pon the verdant grass of land. I intend to honour this. Do you hear me, lubbers? I will show my strategy game mastery by conquering Total War: Warhammer 3’s world, and I will never touch grass.

                              <span>Ever since Lords Of The Realm, I&#x27;ve had a soft spot for feudalism sims. Although faux-medieval games are common, there aren&#x27;t all that many about regular people and regular concerns. Even LotR was increasingly about battles and armies as it went on, rather than the unique management parts.
But in Under The Yoke, you&#x27;re just a serf. You want to make something of yourself, but it&#x27;s about a regular person managing his life, not some unlikely &quot;adventurer&quot;, whatever that means. So you&#x27;ll mostly be toiling, and foraging, and genuinely having way more actual skills than us superior modern folk. And despite some UI issues and rough edges, it&#x27;s weirdly compelling.

                              <span>Friends! Jaegers! Evas! Lend me your radar dishes or cybernetic ear trumpets. Developers Storm Trident and publishers Forever Entertainment have popped up a Steam demo for their Front Mission 2 remake. Tucked within its coils there are two whole levels, Rimian Base and Batari Forest, together with a Garage where you can customise your Wanzer and access to the in-game Network menu.


&quot;Who are you calling a Wanzer?&quot; you bellow. Calm down and stop waving that chair. A wanzer is a mech, in short. And Front Mission, by the way, is a 90s tactical RPG series from G-Craft and Square, both of which have since been assimilated into the terrifying robot octopus that is present-day Square Enix. Much as with Final Fantasy Tactics games, Front Mission games are stagey political thrillers about countries and corporations and other factions waging perpetual war upon each other, with players thrust into the mix as mech squad leaders.

                              <span>For a handheld PC, the Steam Deck benefits an awful lot from having a mouse and keyboard plugged into it, and nothing enables this marriage of portable and peripheral like one of the best Steam Deck docks. And it’s not just USB connectivity that gets a boost – external displays, rock-solid Ethernet connections for game downloads, and power delivery all make dock usage a preferable alternative to simply hooking up Bluetooth accessories. Along with a microSD card (and possibly a better case), these stand/hub combos are definitely among the tools that any regular Steam Deck wielder should have.

                              <span>As a valued RPS supporter, you’re likely aware that you possess legal ownership of the fleeting thoughts I have right before falling asleep at night. It’s actually in the T&amp;C, right under the bit about Horace’s claim on your organs. Good news: such interruptions are plentiful, and so too will be content. Here&#x27;s my latest:
Am I doomed, I asked myself, to live in wishful longing for the myriad gaming experiences I could have had if I didn’t tend to get obsessed with a few specific games, both digital and tabletop, that take up all my leisure time? 
Obviously I didn’t phrase it like that. It was more like ‘whawhaohhnoo’.

                              <span>Yesterday, if you can believe it, marked the tenth anniversary of The Elder Scrolls Online. That&#x27;s a whole decade of tromping across Tamriel with your mates, and a whole decade in which I&#x27;ve watched tentatively from the sidelines, thinking about dipping my toes into the MMO pool, but never quite building up the courage (or lining the walls of my bank account) to fully take the plunge. I&#x27;ve heard all the horror stories about starting a new MMO from other members of the RPS Treehouse - particularly when it comes to the lore-laden shackles of World Of Warcraft and the bloated MMO-service-hybrid Destiny - and quite honestly, it&#x27;s enough to put me off them all entirely. But The Elder Scrolls Online might just be the exception to the rule.
I spent a portion of the game&#x27;s tenth birthday yesterday playing Gold Road, its upcoming eighth Chapter expansion. In it, you&#x27;re whisked over to the West Weald, an autumnal, sun-dappled region whose main city hub, Skingrad, will no doubt feel familiar to seasoned Oblivionites. Seemingly overnight, a strange jungle has sprung up on the city&#x27;s outskirts, uprooting the nearby villages of the neighbouring high elves and causing havoc as strange beasts pour out of its curling root beds. There are more mysteries to unravel here, too, including the emergence of the new Daedric Prince, Ithelia (revealed at the end of last year&#x27;s Necrom Chapter), and much more besides - too much to realistically take in during a 90-minute preview session, or for this MMO newbie to fully comprehend the significance of. But there&#x27;s something about Gold Road and its gnarled-up jungles, strange cults and fantastical beasts that&#x27;s definitely made me want to make a return journey here when it launches on PC on June 3rd.

                              <span>As World Of Warcraft Classic - an MMORPG that is, confusingly, a new version of the old version of World Of Warcraft - enters phase 3 of its Season Of Discovery, PCGamer has an interview with some of the devs where they talk about the decision to not run Player Test Realms - servers where they roll out the new content to smaller numbers of players to road test it. This means that when they launch new stuff for Seasons Of Discovery it&#x27;ll probably break more often, but it means players get to discover brand new things together. Which is great! And the developers think it&#x27;s good too.

                              <span>The long-serving top producer of legendary RPG series Dragon Quest has stepped down from the role, according to sources that spoke to RPS Maw tribute site Bloomberg. Yu Miyake, who has been involved with numerous DQ games since he joined Enix in 1989 as marketer on DQ books, is moving on to head up Square Enix’s mobile games.
The change comes as part of shake-ups at Squeenix under new President and blockchain enjoyer Takashi Kiryu, who Bloomberg point out has committed to reverse SE’s flagging sales of both big releases (like Final Fantasy 16) and mobile titles (like Final Fantasy 7: Ever Crisis), possibly so he can profit handsomely enough to construct himself an arm-mounted Australian Shepherd launcher (like Final Fantasy 8.)

                              <span>A big &#x27;ol patch is coming to the System Shock remake next Thursday, headlined by &quot;[reworking] the entire final fight with new mechanics and a unique flow&quot; and adding a female character option for our hacker. Update 1.2 will also tweak and fix and fiddle with heaps of other things. Our System Shock review called it &quot;a breathtakingly beautiful and astonishingly faithful remake that proves the enduring power of Looking Glass design&quot; when it launched last year, though I would say System Shock&#x27;s final battle is one of the most dated parts, so I&#x27;m curious to see the new form.

So, if you don’t fancy shelling out the full £19.10 for all three factions, you can grab new bits for either Nurgle, the Empire, or the Dwarfs for £7.49. If you do buy just one to start off with - say, to get a feel for the quality of Thrones of Decay as a package - you’ll get a 15% discount on the remaining two packs in the future.

                              <span>Goblin Stone released almost a month ago, but we haven&#x27;t written about it yet, and it feels like you should know about it. It&#x27;s a turn-based RPG, it&#x27;s a roguelike with permadeath, it&#x27;s got XCOM-style base-building, its got card-based combat; it is extremely your sort of thing, if you&#x27;re the exact statistical average of Rock Paper Shotgun readers.

Now Vlambeer is returning. Nijman announced today that he is now the sole owner of Vlambeer, and he&#x27;s going to release new games under the name while continuing to support their older releases.

                              <span>Update: Roblox Studios have responded to Eurogamer&#x27;s report, in particular addressing the quote that they &quot;hired some teenagers&quot; to clarify that they do not hire minors. You can find Roblox Studios&#x27; full response over on Eurogamer.
Original story
Roblox allows its players to create and monetise their own creations within its ecosystem. Across the entire breadth of Roblox game makers, a lot of money is made. At the individual level, however, the vast majority of creators making work within Roblox never earn enough to cash out their earnings - and some of those creators are children. This has long led to allegations that Roblox is exploiting child labour, generating value for Roblox Studio and its shareholders in the process.

&quot;I don&#x27;t know, you can say this for a lot of things, right?&quot; said Roblox Studio head Stefano Corazza at GDC, when the allegation was put to him by Eurogamer. &quot;Like, you can say, &#x27;Okay, we are exploiting, you know, child labour,&#x27; right? Or, you can say: we are offering people anywhere in the world the capability to get a job, and even like an income. So, I can be like 15 years old, in Indonesia, living in a slum, and then now, with just a laptop, I can create something, make money and then sustain my life.

                              <span>As part of a widespread torrent tracker crackdown in Denmark, the National Unit for Special Crime investigated and prosecuted more than two dozen suspects. The most recent defendant, a 48-year-old man from East Jutland, pleaded guilty to his involvement in the Asgaard tracker and was handed a conditional prison sentence. According to local anti-piracy group Rights Alliance, the punishment should have been much tougher.

                              <span>In September 2023, Swedish anti-piracy group Rights Alliance was looking forward to the upcoming trial of a man suspected of being behind a pirate IPTV service. He registered the site&#x27;s domain and in 2020 received almost $190,000 in cryptocurrency from sales. The case was backed by IP address evidence and a financial investigation, but things didn&#x27;t go exactly to plan. A court of appeal decision handed down Thursday couldn&#x27;t alleviate the disappointment.

                              <span>On this week&#x27;s episode of The Game Informer Show, the crew discusses our time playing the public demo of Stellar Blade, the character action game formerly known as Project Eve. We drill into Pepper Grinder, the latest title from Devolver Digital, and then discuss a rad town-building sandbox called Summerhouse. After highlighting Stunt Paradise, a small game that fans of the Trials series might enjoy, we steer the conversation towards Marcus&#x27; Open Roads review and how the title compares to Gone Home and Tacoma.

                              <span>Publisher Microids and newcomer developer Savage Level have revealed Flint: Treasure of Oblivion, a turn-based tactical RPG set in a world of piracy. This swashbuckling debut from Savage Level is due out in Q4 of this year on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, and if today&#x27;s debut trailer is any indication, it looks like a game worth keeping a spyglass on. 
Savage Level describes Flint as a double-A game that takes inspiration from one of piracy&#x27;s most famed fictional stories: Treasure Island.
&quot;Prepare to weigh anchor alongside Captain Flint, his trusty first mate Billy Bones, and their crew of seasoned sea dogs as they set sail in search of a legendary treasure promisin&#x27; freedom and fortune,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;With a yarn spun in the traditional style of comic strips, Flint: Tr…</span>

                              <span>Stellar Blade director Kim Hyung Tae has announced that developer ShiftUp&#x27;s upcoming action game, Stellar Blade, will get a New Game+ mode sometime after launch. Plus, Tae says there will be no microtransactions in the game, save for one theoretical exception. 
This news comes from a new interview with Korean publication Ruliweb, where Tae explained that while Stellar Blade will have a New Game+ mode at some point, it won&#x27;t be available at launch, as translated by Genki_JPN on Twitter. Tae also told Ruliweb that players should not expect any microtransactions in Stellar Blade, but notes that one exception would be paid collaborations with another company&#x27;s IP. 


&quot;We want to make it clear at this point that Stellar Blade will not require any additional expenses that gamers are not aware of beyond what they paid for the package,&quot; Tae told Ruliweb. &quot;The only exception is if we create collaboration costumes with another company&#x27;s IP; those may be sold for a fee. Also, there is no New Game+ in the launch version, so please look forward to it being updated very soon.&quot; 
Given that no collaborations have been announced at this point, Tae is likely just checking bases for hypothetical collaborations ShiftUp may or may not be pursuing. At any rate, given the popularity of ShiftUp&#x27;s Goddess of Victory: NIKKE game on mobile devices, it&#x27;s possible we see an internal collaboration between those two properties. 
Stellar Blade is an action game launching on PlayStation 5 exclusively on April 26. It was announced in 2021 as Project EVE. There is a demo for Stellar Blade available on PSN that you can download right now if you&#x27;re curious about how the game plays.

Dubbed v0.2.0.6, the Steam version of this update for PC players is already live; the Xbox version will be released when it&#x27;s ready, according to Pocketpair. 
As for what to expect, today&#x27;s update is one of Palworld&#x27;s biggest. But chief among the additions is the game&#x27;s first raid boss, a heavily anticipated aspect of the survival game&#x27;s endgame. Let&#x27;s break it all down:

These pals are extremely powerful and cannot be captured.

                              <span>Uniqlo stores currently offer Capcom-inspired clothes that feature the likes of Street Fighter 6, Resident Evil 4, and more, alongside other items of apparel inspired by Konami&#x27;s Metal Gear Solid series. Now, Uniqlo has revealed The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is the next game to get the t-shirt treatment.
The clothes will launch in Japan this month – Uniqlo is based in Japan – before a release in the West happens at some point in the future, as reported by VideoGamesChronicle. As for when exactly to expect these shirts to hit the states, though, that remains unknown. 
The Tears of the Kingdom line consists of six shirts, and you can check each out in the gallery below: 

On the Japanese website for Uniqlo, each of these shirts is listed for 1,500 Yen, which converts to less than $10 a shirt. However, the price could be raised when these shirts come to Uniqlo stores in the states.

                              <span>A fresh new batch of Senua&#x27;s Saga: Hellblade II previews have dropped today, which is how we learned Ninja Theory co-founder and Hellblade director-writer Anteem Antoniades is no longer at the studio. It&#x27;s also how we learned the game will run at 30 FPS on Xbox Series X/S. 
Speaking to German publication GamePro, Hellblade II visual effects director Mark Slater-Tunstill confirmed the game will run at 30 FPS alongside dynamic scaling on Xbox Series X/S, as reported by Wccftech. Slater-Tunstill told GamePro the 30 FPS makes sense with the game&#x27;s more cinematic nature. However, if you&#x27;re after higher frames, a beefier PC can likely accomplish that. 


Regardless of frames, Hellblade II is sure to be stunning visually. Developed in Epic Games&#x27; Unreal Engine 5, Ninja Theory told Polygon this engine has allowed the game&#x27;s more realistic nature to be achievable, thanks to its Nanite geometry system and because &quot;the turnaround between scanning the thing and putting it in the level is drastically cut, and you can spend that time finessing.&quot; Be sure to read Polygon&#x27;s full Hellblade II preview for more details on what to expect visually from this game. 
Hellblade II hits Xbox Series X/S and PC on May 21.

                              <span>Ninja Theory co-founder and Hellblade: Senua&#x27;s Sacrifice writer and director Anteem Antoniades has left the company. This news comes from a new Polygon preview of Ninja Theory&#x27;s upcoming release, Senua&#x27;s Saga: Hellblade II, which hits Xbox Series X/S and PC on May 21, as reported by VideoGamesChronicle. 
Polygon noticed during a hands-on preview of Hellblade II at Ninja Theory&#x27;s Cambridge, U.K.-based studio that there was no trace of Antoniades. A spokesperson for Xbox confirmed later that Antoniades was no longer working at Ninja Theory.


&quot;On my visit, there was no sign or mention of Ninja Theory&#x27;s flamboyant founder and Hellblade writer-director Tameem Antoniades,&quot; Polygon writes in its Hellblade II preview. &quot;An Xbox spokesperson later confirmed to Polygon that he is no longer with the studio. Antoniades was involved in Hellblade 2 in the early stages, but the game now has a trio of creative leads: environment art director Dan Attwell, visual effects director Mark Slater-Tunstill, and audio director David Garcia.&quot; 
Beyond the Hellblade series, Antoniades also worked on Ninja Theory&#x27;s Heavenly Sword, Enslaved: Odyssey to the West, and DmC: Devil May Cry. 
Hellblade II hits Xbox Series X/S and PC on May 21.

                              <span>Plex is a multi-functional streaming platform that allows users to watch, organize, and curate their favorite media entertainment. Sharing Plex libraries is also an option; one that comes with piracy concerns. In an effort to &quot;avoid the growth of piracy&quot;, Plex asked GitHub to remove a repository that allows people to reshare libraries that were not originally theirs.

                              <span>Russia&#x27;s full-blown invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 triggered a Western rightsholder exodus. For the English Premier League, a £43m deal with Match TV was suspended but Russians wasted no time exploring other options. Pirate IPTV services, web-based streaming portals, and streams on betting apps filled the void. HD presentations on the social networking site VK also hit the spot, complete with homegrown commentary teams and custom graphics.

                              <span>I&#x27;m not much of a reality TV watcher. Genuinely, I&#x27;ve been humiliated on this count in RPS morning meetings, with certain &quot;colleagues&quot; whose names rhyme with &quot;Malice Knell&quot; making references I don&#x27;t understand and laughing at my expression of hurt and confusion. My grasp of reality TV basically ends with the finale of the very first season of Big Brother, feat. Nasty Nick. But you could argue that you don&#x27;t need to watch reality TV to understand and enjoy reality TV, because the basic reality TV thrill of forming weird parasocial attachments to people who are role-playing as themselves is now the golden rule of digital society generally.


&quot;&#x27;Reality&#x27; stuff is huge now, and it&#x27;s not just reality TV,&quot; says Nicole He, designer of The Crush House - an enticing, absurdist and engrossingly unpleasant new sim from Reigns and Card Shark developers Nerial. &quot;It&#x27;s any kind of celebrity or influencer or streamer or something like that - there are so many parasocial relationships in that way, and I think that really started with reality TV, and then [continued] in the era of social media. It&#x27;s one of those topics that we don&#x27;t talk about in an explicit way, necessarily, but it&#x27;s something that you hopefully think about as you&#x27;re playing the game.&quot;

                              <span>You could say that the best Steam Deck case is the one you get for free, and to be sure, I have no qualms with Valve’s bundled carrier. Especially not the one you get with the 1TB Steam Deck OLED, which adds a neat mini-case in the form of a removable liner. Still! As you’ll see here, you do have a choice of worthwhile upgrade options, ranging from conventional hard cases with extra accessory storage to clever protective sleeves that combine impact resistance with improved handheld grip. The best way to avoid Steam Deck damage is to not drop it in the first place, as Sun Tzu probably said.

                              <span>This week you could get two horror games for free! Rental and Content Warning both launched for nada (albeit for a couple of days only in the case of the latter). Nate and I have both done work for free in the hope someone would retrospectively pay for it, so on this episode of the Electronic Wireless Show podcast Is it worth it? Is this how the internet is going to work from now on? Plus, what are some of our favourite free games? There are a bunch.
We also talk about the science that suggests people process visual information at wildly different speeds (I know I shouldn&#x27;t have said that some people just &#x27;see more fasterer&#x27; or whatever reductive thing I said, please don&#x27;t email me), Nate teaches me about some weird cryptids, and we recommend some sweet non-video game stuff, as per usual.

Wild Bastards is the follow-up to Void Bastards, 2019&#x27;s roguelikelike first-person shooter about a prisoner in a corporate nightmare forced to raid derelict spaceships on a wild goose chase. This time, it&#x27;s leaning into crime, jaunting across the galaxy to resurrect a game of legendary outlaws, the Wild Bastards. Allow me to repeat that name: the Wild Bastards. Alright, now come watch the gameplay trailer.

It was the afternoon of day four at GDC, my adrenaline reserves were spent, and there I was, in a warm, shuttered hotel room, with two men gently bombarding me with French-accented details of synergies, stackable trinkets and i-frames (I&#x27;m aware that the scenario I&#x27;ve just described is probably somebody&#x27;s kink - let&#x27;s move swiftly on).


Windblown itself is an airy, bright fusillade of Saturday morning cartoon vibes, a series of breakneck arena fights waged on procedurally generated island chains floating against a whirlpool sky. It&#x27;s all shaping up very nicely, and if I&#x27;d been playing the demo, I&#x27;m sure it would have woken me up better than any emergency deluge of instant coffee. But watching somebody else tear through this stratospheric world simply overloaded my depleted senses, and I came perilously close to nodding off.

                              <span>Tropes aren&#x27;t actually bad, right? Like, I&#x27;m not actually mad that a lot of games use &#x27;the world is ending and you have to save it&#x27; as an inciting incident. When people complain about something being &#x27;tropey&#x27; I think often what they&#x27;re complaining about is that the work isn&#x27;t putting any kind of interesting spin on the tropes. Great God Grove is a weirdo puzzle game where you have to stop the world from ending, and the only way you can communicate is by sucking up things people say to you and then firing them back out of your news cannon. It&#x27;s coming to PC in 2024. Jolly good.

                              <span>In response to gold generation and item exploits in action rpg game Last Epoch, developer Eleventh Hour have released a statement on Steam admonishing those responsible and reaffirming their commitment to preventing further exploits on &quot;both a technical and user level.&quot;
The statement, which also mentions nefarious goings on involving the very much banned RMT (real money trading), details the recent fixes released to combat these issues, as well as the identification and banning of accounts found to have broken the game’s terms of service.

                              <span>I’m not saying that Zuzu, the star of melancholic 2D adventure Skaramazuzu, is definitely inspired by that Adventure Time bit where the deer takes off its hooves like gloves. But I am saying that if it were, it’d have my full support, because the freak deer deserves to live on forever, even as a shadow wandering a gothic purgatorial landscape in an unrelated game. 
We got a trailer for this one a few weeks back, and the game itself just dropped on Steam yesterday. It’s got that specific blend of Hollow Knight: Silksong -esque maudlin and whimsy that I personally love, skirting around the edges of both without slipping too readily into Tim Burton territory. The artstyle is crisp and wintery, the writing is goofy, and everything that moves looks like it evolved from the same dead tree branch. Feast your hooves on the trailer below:

                              <span>Pocketpair have released a new Palworld update, Steam version v0.2.0.6, which introduces the monster-catching survival game&#x27;s first Raid Boss, a gloating Gothy squid-lady by the name of Bellanoir. She&#x27;ll be available to conjure by using slabs at new Summoning Altars. Be prepared for a tough fight, especially if you opt for the &quot;extreme&quot; version of the boss. Bellanoir can&#x27;t be captured, but she does drop a Pal Egg on defeat.


This is a chunky update, with a bunch of new items and tweaks to the building system, Pal falling damage, shop prices, player drops on multiplayer servers, and the user interface - for example, you&#x27;ll now see how many of a Pal you own when you aim a Palsphere at one. You can also now cancel a Pal&#x27;s break simply by picking them up and throwing them at the worksite - truly, a scene from Dickens. All the new stuff is in addition to the usual bugfixes, fresh anti-cheating measures and quashing of exploits: no longer will you be able to massively increase your attack power while riding Pals under certain conditions.

                              <span>Presumably, the remake of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic can’t hold up a newspaper with today’s date to prove that it is actually doing okay and hasn’t been quietly disposed of in a tax report somewhere, Warner Bros-style. As such, it falls to the head of current developers Saber Interactive to promise that the long-in-the-works Star Wars game is still “alive and well”.

The studio has confirmed a number of layoffs shortly after the announcement of the sale, while clarifying that no positions related to the development of games were affected.

If you haven’t but are curious to give it a go, you might want to grab it sooner than later. Ahead of the game’s full 1.0 launch, its price tag will be permanently raised to almost twice its previous cost.

                              <span>Earlier today Tom Betts - founder of Nullpointer and former lead programmer at The Signal From Tolva developers Big Robot - emailed me about his new game The Horror At Highrook. In the space of a single, rollercoaster paragraph, Betts earned my curiosity by describing himself as a fellow Soul Reaver enthusiast, lost it again by criticising Soul Reaver’s camera - such insolence! - and earned it swiftly back by mentioning that he’s from Yorkshire. Then, he upgraded my curiosity into attention by describing The Horror At Highrook as a “clockwork narrative” horror experience that takes inspiration from Poe, Stoker and Lovecraft on the one hand, and from boardgames, wiki-hunting and escape rooms on the other.
This is a heady brew indeed. Also, there appears to be a cat in the game called Mr Tubbs, described as a “portly grey barrel of fur”. I entertain suspicions of Mr Tubbs. What fell secrets lurk behind his perfectly groomed exterior? Anyway, here’s the trailer.

                              <span>With a desktop version of the RTX 4050 looking less likely with every turn o’ the Earth, the true entry-level GPU among Nvidia’s current generation solely remains in the realm of gaming laptops. It’s also, I’ll admit, overdue some consideration on RPS. Between the lack of cheap graphics cards among the desktop RTX 40 series, the year-and-a-bit that DLSS 3 has had to grow its compatible games library, and the Steam Deck reminding everyone that portable, low-end gaming can still be pleasurable, now seems like the RTX 4050’s time to shine. Or, at the very least, gently twinkle.

                              <span>Do you remember the noughties fan warz over which game had the best terrain destruction physics? The victors of that particular forum skirmish were probably DICE&#x27;s Battlefield games, with their woozy Frostbitten cinematography and dependable multiplayer tactic of having a whole team focus fire on a single capture point, gradually reducing it to stumps of foundation. But leftier souls may have preferred Volition&#x27;s (RIP) Red Faction series, the third of which, Red Faction: Guerrilla, featured a granular demolition engine that you bash apart whole bases with a sledgehammer.
Well, Guerrilla&#x27;s lead tech designer Luke Schneider is still in the architecture-ruining business: his and Radiangames&#x27;s latest, the hopefully self-explanatory Instruments Of Destruction, leaves Steam early access on May 10th, 2024. Here&#x27;s the 1.0 trailer.

                              <span>It&#x27;s a fond hope, a fool&#x27;s hope, but perhaps 2024 will be remembered not as the year of Yet More Layoffs, but the year of Unexpected Hits. Surprise record-setters like Palworld, which I don&#x27;t especially like, Helldivers 2, which I rather enjoy, and now Content Warning, which I&#x27;m still figuring out. If you missed it, the co-op horror game released on Monday with a temporary free promotion, and racked up a 200,000-player Steam concurrency last night. Published by Totally Accurate Battle Simulator outfit Landfall, it&#x27;s sort of like Lethal Company in being about venturing into horrible places as a wibbly-wobbly defenceless explorer, but rather than gathering scrap for resale, you&#x27;re filming yourself and the monsters in a bid to publish a viral &quot;SpookTube&quot; video, with tuber celebrity translating into cash for new equipment. 
Each video is edited together automatically from your footage and accompanying voicechat, once you return from each trip to the Old World, and you can watch it all on an in-game monitor with a mocked-up chat feed and viewcount. It&#x27;s a pungent, potted commentary on the machinations of Youtube celebrity, with heady notes of &quot;cautionary tale about algorithmic content generation&quot; and &quot;cautionary tale about people endangering or hurting themselves being a dependable source of views&quot;. Urgh, I can feel an op-ed coming on. In the meantime, here&#x27;s how the developers - a team of only five - are updating Content Warning following its launch success.

                              <span>&quot;It almost feels like proof-of-concept for a first-person Prince of Persia game, with an ever-so-gentle dusting of Portal,&quot; our Edwin said after playing free first-person platformer Grimhook when it launched in December. It&#x27;s a cracking little game, parkouring about with the help of supernatural powers and a grappling hook, but ends right as it feels like it&#x27;s getting started. I&#x27;d certainly be up for three hours of this, so how splendid to hear that the developers are planning to make a &quot;complete&quot; and fancier experience.

People like our hardware editor James then point and laugh at me, as an objectively wrong person. But according to a small study highlighted by the Guardian, I might have been right too! Turns out there&#x27;s evidence that we might all see life at different FPS. That player might not be cheating, he might just experience Fortnite at a speed you don&#x27;t.

                              <span>The PC and console market grew by 2.6% to $93.5 billion in revenue last year, according to a new report by video games date company Newzoo (cheers, Kotaku!) That’s good, right? Growth is universally a good thing, otherwise all those nice, dead-eyed men in suits wouldn’t keep saying it was. You can’t just lie about growth, that’s a business crime. However, here’s some slightly more worrying news, depending on how much you value new ideas: Of all the game time that gamers spent gaming in quantifiable Big Year for Gaming 2023, just 20% of that time was gamed on games other than the 66 specific games mentioned in the report.

                              <span>The Elder Scrolls Online is the elephant in the room where discussions of The Elder Scrolls 6 are concerned, though calling it an elephant is obviously missing the opportunity for a banger lore joke – “dragon”, perhaps, or even “Numidium”? Launched back in 2014 after seven years in development, ESO&#x27;s hybrid of deceptively single-player-ish Elder Scrolls presentation with MMO fixtures attracted a lukewarm response, initially. “At its best The Elder Scrolls Online looks like a faithful addition to the lore,” intoned Brendy in our own launch impressions. “At its worst it is a derivative and uninventive anachronism.”
ZeniMax Online have made big strides with the game over the years, however - binning off monthly subscriptions and introducing a “level-free” format in the One Tamriel update in 2016. ESO has also swelled and sprouted steadily as a work of geography and history, with major chapters introducing areas hitherto only mentioned in dusty collectible tomes, or creatively reintroducing locations from the single player series – the forthcoming Gold Road expansion, out in June 2024, takes us to the West Weald in Cyrodiil, an area last seen in The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion.

That’s according to Insider Gaming, who were told by sources that ‘The Rogue Prince of Persia’, as the game is rumoured to be named, will first release in Steam early access. It’s reckoned to have been in development for the last four years or so, and supposedly came about after a talk between Evil Empire and Ubisoft at GDC 2019.

                              <span>Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes, the popular free-to-play Star Wars collectible turn-based strategy RPG mobile game, is coming to PC with cross-save functionality and improved performance. Speaking with the developer over e-mail, the team says, &quot;We have been able to double the frame rate to 60 fps, added anti-aliasing, and implemented higher resolution settings so that players can take advantage of the power of a high-end PC.&quot; The game&#x27;s layout has also been adjusted for the PC version.
Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes originally launched for mobile devices back in 2015, and has amassed a following over the years. In that time, players have figured out ways to emulate the game on PC, but this will be an official release. Along with improved visuals, the game will also support mouse and keyboard as well as keybinds (unfortunately &quot;there is no controller support at this time&quot;). Longtime players will also be able to bring all their progress over by linking their mobile account to their EA account when playing on PC for the first time, and all future updates will release on both mobile and PC platforms simultaneously. The teams says, &quot;The PC and mobile version will always be in lockstep and release updates at the same time.&quot;
Beta access for the PC version will be available for current mobile players in May before expanding to a larger audience. From the developer: &quot;For those interested, they can head to the Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes website, sign up for the EA App, link their account, and they are now ready to register. There’s a dedicated registration page that can be found on the website the day registration begins! For those selected, you will be receiving an invite via email for access to the Closed Beta.&quot; You can learn more here.</span>

                              <span>The Foreign Trade Barriers Report published by the office of the USTR outlines &quot;significant barriers&quot; to exports, investment, and commerce. On IP-related matters, the latest report features criticism of China, several countries in South America, Russia, and other permanent fixtures in the annual publication. However, at the heart of the EU, Germany is also accused of not doing enough to protect U.S. interests, and has Poland, Bulgaria, and Romania for company.

                              <span>As part of a voluntary agreement with copyright holders, German Internet service providers block a list of structurally infringing websites. This blocklist has recently expanded with the first publisher-related target; popular shadow library, Sci-Hub. After a careful review, the responsible “clearing body” concluded that a country-wide blockade is a reasonable and proportionate measure.

                              <span>RPS was on holiday yesterday, which is fortuitous timing because it was April 1st and it meant we missed all the &quot;jokes&quot; (lies) the games industry likes to spread on that day each year.

Credit to Arma developer&#x27;s Bohemia Interactive, however. Their April 1st announcement was that the latest update for Arma Reforger was Tiny Wars, a game mode in which you controlled tiny toy Army Men as they waged war around a proportionally huge home. As ever, this isn&#x27;t really a joke, but it also wasn&#x27;t exactly a lie, because you can actually play Tiny Wars for real now.

                              <span>Telecoms regulator AGCOM has either downplayed, dismissed, or flat-out ignored even the most constructive criticism concerning the Piracy Shield system. How AGCOM will handle a demand for information filed by the National Consumers Union (UNC) remains to be seen, but with its connections to the Ministry of Economic Development, dismissing UNC may be less straightforward. Meanwhile, we&#x27;re informed Cloudflare won&#x27;t be blocked in the future...

                              <span>Internet provider Frontier Communications asked a New York bankruptcy court to dismiss several piracy liability claims brought by movie and music industry companies. Citing a recent Supreme Court decision, the ISP argued that merely providing Internet service shouldn&#x27;t invoke liability. The court agreed that liability isn&#x27;t automatic but it denied the ISP&#x27;s request, ruling that there are other copyright-specific factors at play.

                              <span>Oh MMy — a new ScummVM release!
Please welcome the first ScummVM release of the year: ScummVM 2.8.1.
ScummVM 2.8.1 is a maintenance release mainly focused on fixing bugs that were uncovered since our last stable release.
This update includes upgrades for the following engines: AGI, AGS, GRIM, SWORD2, MM (which is now enabled — yes, we really skipped it in 2.8.0 by accident), mTropolis, NANCY, SCUMM, TWINE, Ultima, and V-Cruise.
The Android, Atari and macOS ports received multiple bug fixes, mostly for improving overall stability and preventing some crashes we’ve seen under certain circumstances.
The detailed list of improvements is available here.
As always, you can find the latest release on our Downloads page.
Go grab it while it&#x27;s hot — enjoy!

                              <span>Features: added. Gameplay: improved. Bugs: squashed. Final testing pre-release: probably, unless time is accidentally stopped. Today we release 14.0-RC3, hopefully the last release candidate before the proper 14.0 release. Compared to the previous RC, some annoying bugs were fixed and the latest translation updates included.

                              <span>I was once the hottest new model on the street. Newspapers heralded my arrival in every town. The titans of industry were inspired to produce more goods when I visited their factories. But as the years have passed, so do their eyes pass over me, to eye curiously my replacements. Will you try the new style, ma’am? It’s so much better than that old thing. I’ve watched my friends grow old and die. My brother got caught in traffic and caused a horrific level crossing collision. I get sick more often, wheezing to a halt wherever I am. When I visit the doctor for a spot of renewal, they tell me, “Sorry, I can’t help. You’re too old.” When will I be autoreplaced? Woe is the tale of the Balogh Goods Truck. But what if we could slow or pause the steady march of time? In OpenTTD 14, you can.</span>
