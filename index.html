                              <span>If you&#x27;ve been stuck in Jujutsu Infinite trying to unlock a Domain Expansion of your choice, you should start to look for Domain Shards.


Let&#x27;s take a look at how you can obtain these shards in discussion and how you can consistently stock up on them. Doing so will help you with Domain Expansion, which is a really important aspect of powering up the build of your character.


Best ways to farm Domain Shards in Jujutsu Infinite


There are different ways to get Domain Shards in Jujutsu Infinite.



Opening chests is the best thing to do, as they can fetch you Domain Shards and other useful items. Unfortunately, Domain Shard is a Lv. 420 Unique object, and the odds of finding them in chests are super low. To improve the odds in your favor, make sure to use consumables like Beckoning Cats. They might not guarantee what you&#x27;re looking for, but the odds will be slightly better.


Staying in the AFK World can also be helpful as you&#x27;ll get a chest, and opening it could fetch you a Domain Shard. Again, the odds aren&#x27;t super high, and make sure to use consumables like Luck Vials and Lotus to improve the odds.


Domain Shards also spawn randomly as loose loot on the map. Having the Item Notifier Gamepass will be beneficial as it will inform you when the loot has spawned.


The Curse Market is always great if you&#x27;re in desperate need of a resource. You can trade the one you have surplus of in exchange from the Curse Market NPC, and get Domain Shard in return. This method isn&#x27;t that fruitful, but it&#x27;s great as a last resort.

Once you&#x27;ve Domain Shards, you can then unlock Domain Expansion and enable it. Make sure to check out our full explanation about how to properly use Domain Expansion after unlocking it in the first place.

                              <span>Jujutsu Infinite offers plenty of different ways to power up your character, and finding Purified Curse Hands will allow you to unlock different Awakenings.


Awakening is an extremely powerful power-up to avail inside the game, but you can activate only one at a time. Naturally, you&#x27;ll want to go for the best possible options, but that will depend on your luck. Having Purified Curse Hands will allow you to reroll for better passives, and also change the cosmetic appearance if you want.


Let&#x27;s find out how you can farm Purified Curse Hands in Jujutsu Infinite.


Best ways to farm Purified Curse Hands in Jujutsu Infinite


There are three ways to obtain Purified Curse Hands. Do remember that this is a Lvl. 300 Special Grade item, so it will be relatively hard to find.



Opening chests will help you to get Purified Curse Hands, but you&#x27;ll be largely relying on your luck. The base rate of obtaining a Unique item is low, to begin with, and there are other items like Maximum Scrolls as well. You should always use consumables like Beckoning Cats and Lotuses to increase the odds in your favor.


The Curse Market is another great way to get Purified Curse Hands when required, and you can exchange other resources like Domain Shards and Maximum Scrolls. Personally, it&#x27;s not worth using the Curse Market for this specific resource.


Purified Curse Hands can also spawn as loose loot all around the map, but the base odds of happening that is low. While loose loot might be common, they won&#x27;t always be Purified Curse Hands. Again, this step will be heavily reliant on your luck. 





Once found, you can then use it to unlock an Awakening to equip in Infinite Awakening. You can opt for either a selective reroll, or change the passive and appearance as well.

                              <span>Awakenings in Jujutsu Infinite can take your character power to the next level, and you would want to unlock them as you progress deeper on your adventure.


Unfortunately, there&#x27;s no direct explanation about the mechanic and how it works. Most power-ups inside the game require the use of certain resources, and it can be confusing if you don&#x27;t know which resources are required. This guide will help you to get the different Awakenings available in Jujutsu Infinite.


How to get an Awakening in Jujutsu Infinite


As I said, you&#x27;ll need a specific resource to get power-ups in Jujutsu Infinite. In the case of an Awakening, you&#x27;ll need something called the Purified Case Hand. This is a Lvl. 300 Special Grade item, which makes it really difficult to obtain. Once you get the resource, you&#x27;ll be able to unlock an Awakening.


Go to your inventory and check on the top right above your equipment sidebar. It will show the equipped Awakening (if you have any) but do note that it will be empty when you start. From your inventory, you can then use Purified Curse Hand to unlock an Awakening. If you already have one applied, there are a few more options you can enjoy.



Reroll the Passive


Reroll the Cosmetic


Reroll both Passive and Cosmetic.



You can keep only one Awakening active at any given time.




It&#x27;s pretty clear that you&#x27;ll need to get Purified Curse Hands if you&#x27;re looking to unlock an Awakening. You can find them from chests, but the odds will be low. You can also get lucky during explorations as they spawn in certain locations, and there&#x27;s the Curse Market as well.


If you&#x27;re trying to min-max your build, you&#x27;ll want to get the best Awakening possible. To do so, make sure to check out the tier guide to opt for the best options.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a sucker for a good first-person runabout. I don&#x27;t need to shoot, but it&#x27;s sometimes nice to get a sword, or a big whip. As long as I get to be immersed in an adventure. I think that&#x27;s the big theme of my selection box: being grounded within my player character. I want to feel what it&#x27;s like to hike through canyons with too much sellable loot in my backpack. I want to park my soul in the head of a scared Scotsman way out of his depth, hundreds of miles from shore. The closer I can comfortably fit in my character&#x27;s shoes, the more I seem to buy into the world they inhabit. Even if that world is constantly glowing a magnificent crimson.

                              <span>The fell moons rise, and in their cold glare emerges a parcel from the dirt. Bloat and gangrene, crimped as if by tourniquet. A dark promise wriggles within. Grip the fibrous handles, feel its jagged soul imprint upon your palm. Now pull! Rend the sinew, tear muscle from bone, hatch their fetid gift! The yoke draws near! Take up the slip and read the words upon its face.
Time to enjoy your lovely joke!
Q: What&#x27;s the best news you can hear after a trip to the vet?

This is it, folks - our final WAYP feature for 2024. 2025 is going to be a pretty huge year for Nintendo fans, with the likes of Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, Pokémon Legends: Z-A, Professor Layton and the New World of Steam, and Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition all launching within the coming months.
Oh, and we&#x27;re getting new hardware too (probably!).

                              <span>Tekka Maki in Disney Dreamlight Valley is a tasty Japanese dish you can make for your pals like Donald and Mickey. Unfortunately, the ingredients take a long while to grow. 


All Tekka Maki Disney Dreamlight Valley ingredients


Tekka Maki can be made with the following ingredients in Disney Dreamlight Valley: 



Tuna


Seaweed


Soya


Rice

Tuna can be fished from the waters of Glade of Trust and Forgotten Lands in the original valley. The ingredient can be found in white ripples within the water. 


Seaweed can be found in a similar spot to Tuna. Use your fishing rod and set the feed to a place outside of ripples within any spot in the Valley. You should get Seaweed pretty quickly. This ingredient is also used to feed turtles in Disney Dreamlight Valley. 


Soya can be purchased from Goofy&#x27;s Stall in the Lion King-themed Sunlit Plateau. The clumsy character sells the green beans&#x27; seeds for 60 Star Coins. It annoyingly grows within one hour and 30 minutes. You can speed up the process with some Miracle Growth Elixir. 


Rice is also bought from Goofy&#x27;s Stall, this time in the Glade of Trust. The seeds are 35 Star Coins each, while the ingredient itself is 92 Star Coins each.  Rice is a little quicker to grow than Soya and takes 50 minutes. Rice can also be used to make another Japanese dish, Sake Maki, which includes Salmon instead of Tuna.


Once you have all the ingredients, go to a cooking station at your home or Chez Remy. Then, place them all into the pot to create your Tekka Maki. It can be sold for 366 Star Coins or consumed for 984 Energy. Now, you have the delicious recipe in your culinary repertoire!

                              <span>Ever wished you could witness the embryonic stage of Halo: Combat Evolved? The original version of Halo: Combat Evolved from a time when the most influential FPS of our time wasn&#x27;t even an FPS yet. Then you can now download and play the elusive Halo 1: Speartest and e32k builds, completely free of charge, and enjoy a massive blast from an alternate past. 




You can now finally play as that old-school Master Chief with the weird helmet, fire the minigun shown in the very first previews, try out a non-covenant sword, various rocket launchers, a sick flamethrower, and even drive the scorpion tank. It&#x27;s all there. Moreover, I was surprised to see just how beautiful and rich the original ringworld looked — and that&#x27;s coming from someone who adores the original&#x27;s aesthetic.

There are several units from the ever-popular manga that have already been added to the game. They&#x27;re present as part of two factions, and each faction has different clans. You&#x27;ll always need to be a part of a clan, but they&#x27;re not all the same. Let&#x27;s look at which ones are the best for you to consider.


Complete Ghoul://RE Clan tier list


I have used a four-tier system to separate all the available clans in the game. 



S-tier clans are pretty much the best ones available in the latest version.


A-tier clans are pretty close to S-tiers but slightly behind on the power curve.


B-tier clans are okay choices if you&#x27;re a starter.


C-tier clans are common clans, and they&#x27;re only…</span>

What are Ninja Scrolls in Anime Adventures?


Ninja Scrolls are materials in Anime Adventures that are used to evolve units inspired by characters from Naruto. There are three types of them: Ninja Scroll (Fire), Ninja Scroll (Water), and Ninja Scroll (Wood). You need all three to evolve some units. However…</span>

                              <span>The Flea Market added in the Palworld Feybreak update lets you trade items and Pals with other players. You can either sell off things you don&#x27;t need or buy items that are hard to find.  But before that, you have to unlock it first.


How to unlock Flea Market in Palworld


Screenshot by Destructoid.


Step 1: Reach Level 22


First things first, you have to reach Level 22 in the game. This is the initial requirement to access the Flea Market, meaning you will have to progress before you can unlock the feature.


Step 2: Earn two Technology Points


Once you have reached the required level, then you will need two Technology Points. You can easily earn these by doing missions and tasks in the game. Once it is done, you will unlock the Flea Market tech in the Technology Tree. But that’s not enough; you have to still craft it. 


Step 3: Gather materials


Before you can craft the Flea Market, you will need a few materials. Specifically, you will need:



20 Ingots


40 Wood


3 Cloth



Step 4: Unlock and craft the Flea Market


Once you have completed all the aforementioned steps, you can go to the Technology Tree and unlock the Flea Market tech using your points. After that, you have to head to a crafting station and use the required materials to craft it. 


What is the use of Flea Market in Palword?


As mentioned before, it helps you trade off any extra items, such as Pals, food, weapons, and more. It is a good way to earn some extra in-game currency in Palword.

                              <span>If you want to make your build in Jujutsu Infinite as powerful as possible, you&#x27;ll want to concentrate on getting Energy Nature.


Unlike typical resources, there&#x27;s no direct explanation about Energy Nature inside the game. Additionally, you can&#x27;t get Energy Nature directly, and you&#x27;ll have to concentrate on the resources used to create this resource.


How to farm Energy Nature in Jujutsu Infinite


You&#x27;ll need to collect an Energy Nature Scroll to get an Energy Nature, but this won&#x27;t be an easy task. The Energy Nature Scroll is a Lvl. 300 Special Grade item. To get Energy Nature, you&#x27;ll have to use an Energy Nature Scroll.


When you use a scroll for the first time, you&#x27;ll get one Energy Nature, and you can use only one at any given moment. Using a scroll with one equipped will allow you to reroll your existing choice for a different one.


There are two ways of getting Energy Nature Scrolls. You can find them from chests, but the rate of obtaining one is very low. You can use consumables to improve the chances of finding one, and using Beckoning Cats or Lotuses with Fortune Gourd will be helpful.

Another way of obtaining a scroll is by trading in the Curse Market, and you can do so mostly with the help of Domain Shards and Maximum Scrolls. Ultimately, it&#x27;s pretty complex to get the scrolls in the first place as you&#x27;ll have to rank up your character to level 300 or more. 


Again, not every Energy Nature is the same, and you can check out this tier list to get the best option for your build. Ultimately, their effectiveness depends on the style of play of your character, and you should pay attention to that particular aspect as well.

                              <span>Frost Petals in Jujutsu Infinite has confused a lot of players so far. While the resource is part of the Yuki Fortress daily quest, there doesn&#x27;t appear to be any known method to obtain it. Let&#x27;s take a look at whether you can get this item right now inside the game.


How to get Frost Petals in Jujutsu Infinite


At the time of writing, there&#x27;s no way to obtain Frost Petals in Jujutsu Infinite. Naturally, this means the Yuki Fortress daily quest can&#x27;t be solved, as you&#x27;ll need this specific resource to do so. In all probability, this might be a bug, and the developers are likely to be working on it to solve the situation.


Incidentally, you can find this resource in the Sandbox version, where Frost Petals shares the same icon as Cursebloom, a common material required to craft different consumables. This might be a good indication of how you&#x27;ll be able to use Frost Petals eventually when they&#x27;re properly added to the game.




Then again, you can already find the description for the resource, meaning they&#x27;re in core game files. All the available evidence suggests that the developers might have locked Frost Petals for the time being so that players can&#x27;t obtain it. But that&#x27;s likely to be resolved soon.


Once Frost Petals can be obtained inside the game, we will update this section to help you get this valuable item. If you&#x27;re just getting started, the first task will be to farm as many spins as possible. Make sure to check out our guide on that topic, which will allow you to make your gameplay journey a lot easier.

                              <span>Although fairly new, Marvel Rivals already features one of the most active modding scenes in the market, with their creations varying from quality-of-life mods to a few that succeed in bringing amazing and never-thought-before crossovers to the game.


But even if popular, the use of mods brings forth another question. After all, can you get banned for using them? Here&#x27;s whether or not you can get banned for using client-side mods in Marvel Rivals.

Can you get banned for using mods in Marvel Rivals?


Yes, although no bans related to the use of client-side mods have been reported since Marvel Rivals debuted in early December, having any installed might cause you to be flagged by its anti-cheat tool. No matter how harmless your chosen mod might be, installing it wil…</span>

How to access Sandbox mode

You can access Sandbox mode from the main hub. Simply walk near the PvP Modes portal, and you should see Jake (from Adventure Time) on the right side. Talk to him and select the &quot;teleport&quot; option and Jack will teleport you to the Sandbox mode.


There is a common misconception that you need to have played the early access version of Jujutsu Infinite to access Sandbox mode. To test this theory, we used a new account, and sure enough, we were able to access Sandbox mode without any …</span>

In short, there&#x27;s a lot, so we wanted to narrow all of them down in a best-of-the-best list. So, without further ado, here&#x27;s our list of the 10 Best items in Jujutsu Infinite.


Top 10 Best Items List in Jujutsu Infinite


We&#x27;ve already covered all items in the game in our All Items Listed and All Weapons and Armor guides. We based the items on this list on how often we use them or how often we have them equipped. Depending on your playstyle, you may not at all agree with our picks, but if you aren&#x27;t sure which items you should go for, we think this is a nice list to follow.

                              <span>If you want to make the most of the festive season in Anime Adventures, collecting Holiday Stars should be high on your priority list.


This specific resource will help you collect different skins, some of which are exclusively part of the Christmas event. You can also use the item for getting different units as well, so let&#x27;s take a look at how to farm Holiday Stars.


Best way to farm Holiday Stars in Anime Adventures (Christmas Event)


The Holiday event update has added a new Frozen Abyss limited-time mode, which tests your skills as a player. This mode has no end part, and its hard difficulty makes it a real challenge for all. Players can play the mode on their own or with other players. This is the best mode to farm Holiday Stars, and you can also buff your chances to increase the rates in your favor.


To play the Frozen Abyss mode, you&#x27;ll need to have a player level 15 or higher.




How to get more Holiday Stars in Anime Adventures


The main way to get Holiday Stars is to clear Frozen Abyss and kill as many enemies as possible. You should look to use units that do a lot of AoE damage. You can also use holiday skins to boost your units so that you can do more damage. Here are some of the best units you can use to increase the chances of finding Holiday Stars.



Berserker


Ghost Kun


Best AoE for Epic Unit


Light Admiral


Demon Girl



Once you collect the stars, you can use them to summon skins and units that are exclusive to the Christmas event. These skins will range between Mythic and Rare, and the odds will change accordingly. If you are in luck, there&#x27;s a secret unit waiting for you in the draw as well.

CentOS Stream 10 as the upstream to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 10 is largely similar to what&#x27;s found in the RHEL 10.0 beta but one of the key differences is being powered by Linux 6.12 LTS rather than Linux 6.11 as currently used by the AlmaLinux/RHEL 10 beta.

If you are the proud owner of a Nintendo Switch (and if you&#x27;re reading this, we&#x27;d wager that you are), then it will come as no surprise when we say that the eShop is a wild place in 2024.
While gaming may have never been better, Nintendo&#x27;s storefront has never been worse. Discoverability is a thing of the past with new titles added in waves of 30 or more each week, and keyword-dumping scam games are more prevalent than ever.

One of our biggest gripes with Antonblast on the Switch was its performance at launch. In our review, we noted that slowdown during more chaotic moments of gameplay can &quot;cheapen the experience enough to be disappointing&quot;, which isn&#x27;t really ideal for a 2D platformer in which speed is a key factor.
Thankfully, a new update has gone live which provides a welcome performance boost, amping up the framerate to a much more palatable 60fps. According to the announcement, bug fixes have also been implemented, but developer Summitsphere has not elaborated on what kind of issues these specifically target.

Nintendo&#x27;s gamble to save its &#x27;Switch 2&#x27; announcement for the New Year has seemingly paid off - at least in Japan, anyway.
Starting with software, Super Mario Party Jamboree has once again topped the boxed charts, selling a further 133,542 copies and inching ever closer to a total of 1 million lifetime sales. Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake follows behind with another 38,088 copies sold, with a selection of familiar, evergreen Nintendo titles making up the remainder of the top ten (oh, and Minecraft too).

It might feel like a long time since Pepper Grinder was unearthed for Switch at the November 2022 Indie World Showcase, but it has been even longer for Riv Hester, the game&#x27;s solo developer at studio Ahr Ech, who first dug up the idea seven years ago.

                              <span>The latest Blox Fruits update introduces candies that can be extremely useful for your adventure on the new island, and you can trade them for exclusive rewards. Naturally, you&#x27;ll want to earn as many candies as possible and do so efficiently. Here&#x27;s how you can do so.


Best way to get candies in Blox Fruits (Christmas Update 2024)


Earning a candy is pretty simple once you know what to do. You&#x27;ll have to eliminate NPCs with [ELF] written ahead of their names and levels. These enemies spawn randomly, but they are guaranteed to drop candies when eliminated, making this a consistent method of getting this resource.


Any enemy with the [ELF] prefix will drop candies, but their level difference must not be less than 100 from yours. Still, you can farm a lot at locations where the difficulty matches your level, and you can encounter many NPCs quickly.


How to use candies in Blox Fruits (Christmas Update 2024)




Once you find the candies, go to a Christmas Island to trade them. There are three islands found in the Sea of Treats areas Sea 1, Sea 2, and Sea 3. After you reach the island, interact with Santa Claws at the dock. You can find some cool items like the Santa Hat, Elf Hat, or a Sleigh. You can also talk with the Greedy Elf to exchange your candies for Fragments.


If you aren&#x27;t happy with what&#x27;s being offered, the Magic Elf offers an EXP multiplier that works for a limited time.

According to PersonaCentral, the next issue of Weekly Famitsu Magazine features an interview with Katsura Hashino, the founder Atlus&#x27; Studio Zero and the director of Metaphor: ReFantazio. In it, he revealed some fascinating information about the future of this brand-new IP, like the fact that he would like to set a future title in the Sengoku period. Although he jokingly said this may result in a world similar to Capcom&#x27;s Sengoku Basara series.

Couch co-op and JRPG are two genres you don&#x27;t often see together.

Grip the fibrous handles, feel its jagged soul imprint upon your palm. Now pull! Rend the sinew, tear muscle from bone, hatch their fetid gift! The yoke draws near! Take up the slip and read the words upon its face.
Time to enjoy your lovely joke!

                              <span>According to a phrase popularized by Carl Sagan, extraordinary claims should be supported by extraordinary evidence. A new piracy scare story published on Sunday takes a different approach. The extraordinary claim is that fake IPTV portals run by law enforcement are entrapping &quot;ordinary users&quot; to obtain evidence of their crimes. Supported by exactly zero evidence, the report claims that hundreds of internet users have already been identified.

Amazon&#x27;s &#x27;The Boys&#x27; takes the second spot at a respectable distance, while Disney&#x27;s Shōgun is the hottest newcomer.

                              <span>My selection box isn&#x27;t really a selection box. It&#x27;s a tray of barely-nibbled leftovers, hastily lifted from my Steam backlog. One of the disadvantages of being news editor, you see, is that I have  developed a goldfish-grade attention span. In my hectic pursuit of the next scoop, or the next Elden Ring update changelog, I snatch and cast aside game demos like a pickpocket speedrunning the checkout line at Harvey Nichols. I&#x27;m dimly aware that some of these cast-aside games are Very Good. A few might even deserve to be played for longer than 30 minutes. I feel immensely guilty about that. Perhaps a little... existential, too. I have measured out my life in tutorial levels. 


So! Rather than digging out three of the games I&#x27;ve actually completed this year, such as The Crush House, Death Of A Wish and Mask Quest, I&#x27;m going to gamble on recommending a few I&#x27;ve barely scratched, but which sure feel excellent and have attracted a positive critical consensus. If I am false in this assessment, may Horace the Endless Bear bite my head off for my impudence. Let&#x27;s begin.

                              <span>The fell moons rise, and in their cold glare emerges a parcel from the dirt. Bloat and gangrene, crimped as if by tourniquet. A dark promise wriggles within. Grip the fibrous handles, feel its jagged soul imprint upon your palm. Now pull! Rend the sinew, tear muscle from bone, hatch their fetid gift! The yoke draws near! Take up the slip and read the words upon its face.
Time to enjoy your lovely joke!

                              <span>The fell moons rise, and in their cold glare emerges a parcel from the dirt. Bloat and gangrene, crimped as if by tourniquet. A dark promise wriggles within. Grip the fibrous handles, feel its jagged soul imprint upon your palm. Now pull! Rend the sinew, tear muscle from bone, hatch their fetid gift! The yoke draws near! Take up the slip and read the words upon its face.
Time to enjoy your lovely joke!
Q: How can you tell a soulslike fan has fallen in love with a giant ape?

                              <span>In a landmark ruling, the Court of Milan has ordered Cloudflare to block pirate streaming services that offer Serie A football matches. The court found that Cloudflare&#x27;s services are instrumental in facilitating access to live pirate streams, undermining Italy&#x27;s &#x27;Piracy Shield&#x27; legislation. The order, which applies in Italy, affects Cloudflare&#x27;s CDN, DNS resolver, WARP and proxy services. It also includes a broad data disclosure section.

Podpora alternativního backendu byla zavedena před čtyřmi lety a měl používat knihovnu hyper napsanou v jazyce Rust. Cílem bylo zavést alternativní implementaci vnitřních funkcí HTTP, kterou by curl/libcurl mohl používat místo nativní implementace.</span>

                              <span>Ho, ho, ho, Santa is in town. And he’s brought a gift with him. Here’s a shiny new package for you to unwrap, containing the first beta version of the upcoming OpenTTD 15 release. It comes faster, with road waypoints, fewer passwords, better scenario editor, and hopefully with a lot less bugs. To be a bit less vague, here are some of the highlights: Improved picker windows for stations/waypoints/objects/and more. Oh, and that does include road waypoints. Better perfomance in various places, including faster path signals that are now green by default. Password-less network authentication using keys. Several improvements for NewGRFs regarding cargo support. Better scenario editor with a town data importer and manual house placement. A large tree fully hung with ornamental bugfixes. Sadly though, not everbody was good this year. The old NPF pathfinder was finally retired, after YAPF being the superior default for many, many years now. There’s a lot of bugs left for you to find, though, guaranteed. Enjoy the beta, test all the things and report anything you find amiss, to make OpenTTD 15 the best OpenTTD 15 ever.

Může to klidně souviset s výtkami, které stále má vývojář Aurélien Pierre, ale to dnes ponechme stranou. Novinek je zkrátka dost, jde celkem o 1198 commitů do darktable a rawspeed, celkem 505 zpracovaných pull requestů a uzavřených 45 hlášení o problémech. Pascal rovnou dodává, že dokumentace pro tuto verzi ještě není kompletní.</span>

                              <span>Around 2016, sports streaming site Rojadirecta closed its doors to visitors from Spain after losing its legal battle with Mediapro. Despite the win, the broadcaster was disappointed that the court had found the company behind Rojadirecta liable, but not company owner Igor Seoane. After the Supreme Court held that Seoane could be held liable, last Friday a court confirmed total damages of $33 million, with Seoane and the company jointly liable for half of that amount.

NSE is now demanding millions of euros to compensate for the alleged damage to its business. BREIN, however, sees things differently.

Yeah, I know, those things you can right-click and make an infinite number of. So silly. Anyway, three years after that all collapsed, Ubisoft has launched a game featuring the grift.

                              <span>The easiest way to hurt a pirate site, at least temporarily, is by taking away its domain name. Historically, domain name registries have been hesitant to take action but with the right approach, progress can be made. This week, anti-piracy group BREIN reported that following their complaints, the .nl and .eu registries took action against several &#x27;pirate&#x27; domains. On closer inspection, it appears that copyright has little to do with it.

                              <span>Coordinated by Italy last month, a huge law enforcement operation reportedly &#x27;dismantled&#x27; a pirate IPTV service with 22 million users. That&#x27;s an extraordinary number and shows why countries like Italy have adopted mass site blocking measures. Logic suggests that the removal of such a huge player from the market might reduce the need for blocking measures, if only temporarily. The data shows that in the wake of the action, blocking demands significantly increased.

                              <span>&quot;A tactically rich turn-based game with some meaty role-playing elements&quot;, was how Staff Sergeant James Archer characterised his Menace hands-on, back in September. The only thing missing from his account of the game was the bread needed to make that rich, meaty concoction a tasty, nourishing sandwich.
And by bread, I of course mean the strategic layer - the parts between the turn-based battles where you pick your next mission, improve your squads, deal with pop-up story events, appraise your standing with each NPC faction, and equip your strike cruiser with auxiliary systems. Developers Overhype have now shared a few details of how it all works. Mmmmm, such malty, yeasty strategicalness.

Instead, I want to talk about mini PCs – not just small-form-factor desktops, but properly tiny, box o’ chocolates-sized computers – which have, of course, been around for decades.
Recently, however, I’ve been wondering if mini PCs are finally on the cusp of having their moment as serious games machines. Between rising desktop component prices and ever-ballooning electricity bills, it would make sense that a smaller, cheaper system would take on a new appeal, and the success of handhelds like the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Ally show that convenience still trumps out-and-out performance for a lot of PC players. There have even been hints that Valve are resurrecting their Steam Machine mini PC concept, years after a flopping first attempt. Should you be interested?

Its structure most resembles Songs of Conquest or Heroes of Might and/or Magic, but with little RPG emphasis or base building, and minimal tactical fighting.
Taxonomy is arbitrary and often unimportant at the end of the day, but I am very glad to firmly rule it out of one category: It&#x27;s not a bloody card game. It looks like one, sure. You do most things with cards, and characters acquire more cards over time. But even if you absolutely, utterly, and correctly loathe card-based systems, this game has none.

                              <span>Two men on the board of directors for Epic Games have stepped down from their positions after the US Department of Justice investigated the board under antitrust laws. The pair of directors were originally appointed to Epic&#x27;s board by Tencent (who slurp upon a minority stake in the Unreal Engine company) but the United States government took a look at this and said: ah-ah-ah, you&#x27;re not allowed to have a director in your boardroom if they&#x27;re already fingers-deep in the pie of a competing company.

The Winter sale that began yesterday is almost identical to the Autumn sale that ended just two weeks ago, for example. But you can still find one or two gifts if you bore deep enough into the ice. Me? I&#x27;m only interested in one thing. How many of these games are snowy and chilly enough to induce wonderful hypothermia? I&#x27;m on a frostbitten quest to find out. Here are the most winter-iest games you can pick up for cheap.

At least that&#x27;s what the interstellar pilots of Elite Dangerous are celebrating in the galaxy-sized multiplayer space sim. Earlier this month, the Thargoid menace finally landed in the Sol system, putting earth itself under threat for the first time, not to mention other human homeworlds and colonies. This meant players were invited to drop everything and head for home - to embark on one last great stand against the final, desperate, and dangerous alien attacker: a Thargoid Titan called &quot;Cocijo&quot;. Don&#x27;t worry, they got him.

                              <span>Frostpunk developers 11 bit studios have cancelled a new, console-oriented game in response to both &quot;shifting market trends&quot; - in particular, declining player enthusiasm for &quot;narrative-driven, story-rich games&quot; - and specific problems during development. As a consequence, a number of 11 bit staff are going to lose their jobs, though at least half of the affected development team are being offered the chance to move to other projects, including a few unannounced ones.

                              <span>At any given moment I am in the center of a wonderful vortex of skeletons. Bones splash and rattle and burst out of the ground in sharp, horrible spurs. My weakest skeletons, sensing their death coming, explode into fire and shards. My strongest skeletons fight so hard and with such alacrity that upon dying, they drag their spirits together and keep fighting as ghosts for a while. Foul little bone scorpions skitter around on fans of legs made from human hands. Somewhere in the middle, almost invisible among the noise, is the character I am actually playing: Path of Exile 2’s mean-spirited, callous, and gleefully enjoyable Witch.
This is a review in progress. It has to be. Even in its incomplete early access period, Path of Exile 2 is a great sprawling mass of a game. Three meaty acts of a planned six act campaign are followed by a trickier return tour through them, before the absurd endgame kicks into gear and the real work begins. If I came to you having played everything on offer I would be wild-haired, bloodshot-eyed and possessing perfect, incomprehensible knowledge. Let’s compromise: I have toured the dark caverns and the antediluvian crypts. I have been killed by various accumulated nasties. I’ve had a great time.

                              <span>The announcement of The Witcher 4 with The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt&#x27;s Ciri as protagonist has attracted a bit of discussion. Some of the reaction is online toddlers waxing wroth about a video game having a (somewhat older!!!) woman as lead character, and especially, shock, a video game in a series that has hitherto starred a man. And some of it is people commenting more thoughtfully on whether Ciri genuinely makes for a suitable Witcher protagonist, given that she isn&#x27;t the product of the typical Witcher genetic modification regime (which is heavily tailored towards men), and given that, without spoiling too much, she has gifts that make crumbly old Geralt&#x27;s sword-and-sorcery skillset look rather paltry. 


Speaking to Eurogamer this week, game director Sebastian Kalemba and narrative director Philipp Weber responded to a few of these comments, and also shared a little about Ciri&#x27;s situation at the start of the game.

                              <span>&quot;We are a people who honour democracy,&quot; said the dog, scratching himself. &quot;Per our custom, you may drink of our fresh water.&quot; The dog was called Senator Umeshefaat, and he was very civil, even if he was shedding his black and white fur everywhere. We spoke in his home village at dawn. Later, I examined the senator&#x27;s personal history more thoroughly and discovered he was &quot;hated by bears for cooking them a rancid meal.&quot; I suppose every politician has their enemies. 
That Caves Of Qud creates fun anecdotes out of simple encounters shouldn&#x27;t be a surprise. It has had 15 years of early access to establish itself as a small-but-mighty story generating roguelike of repute (there&#x27;s a reason it sits deservedly side-by-side with Dwarf Fortress in the same publishing house). After creating many characters, and dying and dying and dying again, I understand why it grips the brain with such fierce glee. It is a machine of grand imagination and adventuresome comedy. A deceptively powerful RPG that isn&#x27;t half as obtuse to newcomers as the screenshots make it out to be. Qud&#x27;s low-res bark is just a complement to its bite.

                              <span>Insults are so serious, these days. They&#x27;re all so insulting, whereas the kinds of insult I cherish are the ones that coax a belly laugh from both the roaster and the roastee.

This pioneering file-sharing site, once a hub for millions of users, was abruptly shut down on December 19th, 2004. Today, we revisit the Suprnova story and speak with the site&#x27;s founder about its lasting impact and the YouTube empire he built in recent years.

                              <span>They say hope is the first step on the road to disappointment, and reader, I’ve made a pretty damn big step. Previously, on my mission to survive S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl with only wild mutants as my weapons, I’d discovered clues that someone else was attempting to tame the Zone’s beastly inhabitants. With one of their electronic tracking collars in hand and absolutely no preexisting knowledge of their location, I set out to find this kindred spirit, only for the Zone to once again slam a door in my face.
A cold, steel, very literal door to boot. It turns out that the scientist’s laboratory is locked up tight, and will remain so until I delve about twenty hours deeper into the faction war that’s bubbled up while I’ve been running around throwing irradiated rats at people in tracksuits. Fine. Fine! But I’m keeping the collar.

                              <span>Fists up, a big fighting game mod is due out this weekend. Marvel vs Capcom Infinite came out in 2017 and got some flak for its plastic figurine art style. But this year a modder began work on an overhaul that would grant the game pretty cel-shaded visuals. Since then the modding team has grown to 40 people and the scope of the mod&#x27;s features has ballooned. It&#x27;s now going to include new moves, stages, costumes, and a chaotic-looking 2v2 multiplayer tag team mode. All good news for biff &#x27;em up sickos, as the mod is due to release on Friday.

In October of this year, we got a look at some icky celestial faction and zero in the way of actual gameplay. And now? Now we finally get a look at how you do things. Like sucker-punching armoured space bears in the face with electro-pistols.

                              <span>After much teasing, the vicious tyrants of Arrowhead Games and their noxious puppets, the &quot;democratic government&quot; of Super Earth, have announced the very first Helldivers 2 licensed crossover. In yet another hollow display of solidarity and &quot;Liber-tea&quot;, they&#x27;ve teamed up with the loathsome fascists of Killzone, the elderly shooter series from Sony and Guerrilla Games.
From today, you&#x27;ll be able to buy weapons, armour and cosmetics belonging to Killzone&#x27;s despicable stormtroopers from the Helldivers Superstore, and there&#x27;s the suggestion of an additional Killzone-themed reward depending on the fortunes of the so-called Galactic War, a xenocidal bloodbath couched as an exercise in bringing &quot;freedom&quot; to the upstanding socialist Automatons, the blameless wildlife of the Tyranids, and the Wellsian cosplayers of the recently added Illuminate faction.
We here at Rock Paper Shotgun stand against Super Earth and Arrowhead&#x27;s wanton aggression, which absolutely isn&#x27;t a big satirical joke based on some Verhoeven film or other. Anyway, those capes. Find an image and further details below.

                              <span>Times Of Progress is a special game for me, because it&#x27;s the first news tip I have ever received from Sin Vega, Prime Minister of Strategy Gaming. Sin once described writing news articles for our former news editor Alice0 (RPS in peace) as like practising backflips in front of the kung fu master. Writing about a new city builder at Sin&#x27;s suggestion is like being invited to budget the development of Londinium by Julius Caesar.
The terror of screwing it up - together with other, more trivial distractions, like international games industry conferences - has stopped me from writing about Times Of Progress for months. Today I bite the bullet, and emerge from my lodgings to issue a hesitant speech to the masses, hoping like hell that Caesar is too preoccupied with the latest Gaul uprising to notice my errors.

                              <span>Italians who simply view pirate IPTV via illicit subscriptions have been warned for months that their activities could be reported to the judicial authorities for potential prosecution. As part of an investigation into a pirate IPTV subscription seller, a total of 23 people have appeared in court in recent months for simply buying a pirate package. Judges in two separate proceedings have now acquitted all 23 after concluding that this type of piracy isn&#x27;t actually a crime.

                              <span>The Federal Court of Canada has issued a new site blocking order requiring major ISPs to block access to Soap2Day domains. The order was issued in response to a lawsuit filed by Netflix, Bell, and several major Hollywood studios alleging copyright infringement.  The operators of the associated Soap2Day domains must pay millions of Canadian dollars in damages.

                              <span>Suing people for consuming content illegally can be a risky endeavor for companies with brands to protect. Nevertheless, sports rightsholders now seem prepared to put brand integrity on the line in their fight against IPTV pirates. Spain&#x27;s LaLiga is already mailing out &#x27;fines&#x27;, ostensibly to people who simply watched pirate streams. Predictably, there&#x27;s more to it than that.

It&#x27;s a free visual novel with a macabre puzzling element. The setup is that you&#x27;re a toy inspector working for a jovial Grand Toy Maker, his face hidden above the top of the screen. Your job is to disassemble toys - five in all - according to his eldritch written instructions, and either &quot;salvage&quot; them or &quot;sentence&quot; them to the incinerator.

If you missed the reveal, perhaps because you value sleep over the spectacle of Geoff Keighley&#x27;s fashion friends, let me catch you up: in Nightreign, you pick one of eight preset characters and explore a parallel-universe version of Elden Ring&#x27;s Limgrave map, fighting lesser foes and levelling up quickly so that you can battle a boss at the end of each 15-minute in-game day.

                              <span>Quick, the world is in peril, your adopted daughter is under threat, and nearby villagers are being terrorised by monsters. What do you do? Oh, you&#x27;re sitting down at a cosy table in the local tavern. You&#x27;re playing a card game with a dude called &quot;Aldert&quot;. The wind outside is howling, and so are the nightwraiths, but you&#x27;re just sitting there. Playing another &quot;cow&quot; card. Okay.
Guess you&#x27;ll be happy to learn that the Witcher 4 developers have more or less confirmed that Gwent will be making a return in the recently trailered Ciri-led sequel.

                              <span>For over a decade, The Pirate Bay has been accepting Bitcoin donations. In dollar terms, this provided a relatively modest but consistent revenue stream. However, if the torrent site had held onto its early Bitcoin, it could have amassed a small fortune, worth $14 million today. The same applies to BitcoinTorrentz, which once charged today&#x27;s equivalent of $8,000 per gigabyte transferred.

                              <span>Japan-based anti-piracy group CODA is reporting new successes in its overseas efforts to disrupt access to pirate sites. Earlier this month, operators of pirate anime sites in Brazil received in-person visits from CODA, acting on behalf of three major Japanese anime producers. CODA reports that Bakashi.tv, the third most-visited anime site in Brazil, shut down among 15 in total. No other sites are officially named, but our unofficial list provides a few pointers.

And now I know: changing gears is a fucking chore. This year, in my mid-thirties, I finally learned to drive. And weirdly, a racing game about destroying clapped-out old bangers helped me along.

                              <span>Today’s door has a big DO NOT ENTER sign, suggesting your immediate opening of it was in fact prohibited. Banned. Taboo, even. Yet it’s hard to see why, as it swings open to reveal a spectacular sunset view, interrupted only by the roar of a mechanical woolly mammoth.

                              <span>Seasons greetings, reader! It&#x27;s almost time to hang your stocking by the crackling fireplace and post your handwritten letters to Santa up the chimney. If you don&#x27;t have stockings, a fireplace, or a pen, rest easy. I&#x27;ve had a word with Santa&#x27;s elves, and they say it&#x27;s permissible to hang a trash bag by your George Foreman grill or local equivalent, and leave a comment on an RPS article instead. Wot you want for Wintermas, then? Extra trash bags? New George Foreman grill? Whatever it is, Santa will provide. If he doesn&#x27;t, I&#x27;ll feed him to the Maw.

It returns us to the days of LAN parties and dial-up, of demo discs and Fileplanet – a more innocent era, before multiplayer shooters fell under the spell of progression. Not that innocent, maybe. There were plenty of arseholes back then. Some of them now run very large software companies. But at least there was no grinding to ruin your bunnyhopping.

                              <span>The first pirate site blocking order in Canada was &#x27;discontinued&#x27; this week. The plaintiffs, including rightsholders Bell and Rogers, won&#x27;t request an extension of the landmark blocking measures against IPTV service GoldTV. Interestingly, many of the targeted domains are still online. No reason was provided for the discontinuation, but costs and changed priorities likely play a role.

It’s a video game of some description, though it looks like a squirrel, with frantic white eyes. What’s it doing? Ah, whoops, you’ve startled it. Better follow it offscreen.

                              <span>Crimson Desert first galloped onto the scene in 2020, with a bombastic trailer at Gamescom 2023 showcasing some particularly beautiful medieval open world action adventuring. It&#x27;s got horses, fishing, plate armour and roving heroism, but one thing it lacks is a release date. Now, thanks to The Geoff Awards, that&#x27;s changed! Well, sort of - Crimson Desert is out sometime in late 2025.

                              <span>Stealth launching a game during an awards ceremony is cool. But you know what&#x27;s cooler? Stealth launching a union. As many in the games industry settled in for an evening of advertisements and blockbuster backslapping, one group of US workers quietly succeeded in organising something of their own. Employees at Zenimax Online Studios launched their union with 461 members, as announced on social media site Bluesky last night.

Turok: Origins will revisit the dino-hunting archery of ye olde Nintendo 64, reimagining it as a story of three native huntsfolk out to lambast large lizards. The big new angle is that it&#x27;ll be a third-person shooter and you can play in online co-op as a team of T-rex wreckers. You then slurp up their dino DNA to upgrade your character. Come and watch these crimes against nature in the trailer below.

                              <span>Earlier this week we heard rumblings of a new character announcement for Tekken 8, and at the same time a trailer dropped a big unmistakable hint for red-dressed rabble rouser Anna Williams. Turns out that unmistakable hint was mistakable. My mistake. At last night&#x27;s Game Awards we learned that the next fighter to come to the game will be... Clive? From Final Fantasy XVI? Sure. Why not.

                              <span>Aaron Paul, he of a heartbreakingly fraught performance as Todd in Bojack Horseman, and also Breaking Bad, is starring in a new strategy story game from AdHoc, a studio with ex-Telltale developers at the helm. Dispatch is a story-focused strategy game where you’ll play a broke superhero trying to get himself a new mech suit by working at a hero dispatch center. Having trouble tracking a trailer down for this one, but you can find it here on Steam.
Wait. I’ve found it! Leaving that last bit in though. Consider it my gift to you reader. The gift of visible workflow at 4am.

I&#x27;m less of a fan of Sonic&#x27;s other kart racing exploits, but I&#x27;m still cautiously interested to learn he&#x27;s getting back behind the wheel. Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds was just announced.

                              <span>Back in the mid &#x27;90s, I was hooked on an PC racing game called Screamer. It got a sequel a couple of years later, and then the series went dormant. Until now, when it&#x27;s seemingly returning as a foreboding, anime-infused racer about defying death, once again called simply Screamer. Huh! Huh. You&#x27;ll find a trailer below.

                              <span>Arrowhead and Sony have released a new Helldivers 2 update that introduces the long-rumoured third faction, the Illuminate. Titled Omens of Tyranny, the update also stirs in city maps and a driveable jeep with a mounted gun that immediately reminds me of Halo&#x27;s Warthog, and is hopefully just as fragile and bouncy. Here&#x27;s a trailer.

Thankfully this year he also had a game to show: Split Fiction, a new co-op action adventure. It&#x27;s about two aspiring authors, one who writes science fiction and one who writes fantasy, being sucked into and having to survive inside their own fictions.

It looks, as you might expect, very much like the first one, but a bit nicer. The game itself was announced back in 2021, but we’ve seen nary a vaguely satirical sign nor very large gun since. Now we have both, plus some punching. Here’s that trailer.

                              <span>RPG Solasta: Crown Of The Magister is getting a sequel. Solasta II launches in early access next year, and they’re aiming to have a demo out sometime earlier. Like its predecessor, this one’s a party-based CRPG with tactical combat, featuring single player and online co-op. Here’s a trailer. Warning: it has shiny rock people in it, the worst videogame enemy.

If, like me, you really enjoyed the French developers&#x27; previous martial art sims, you might, like me, find this news deflating. Football? We already have that at home. It&#x27;s like a martial art, but all you get to kick is some... ball.
I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll ever entirely swallow my disappointment, but credit where it&#x27;s due, Rematch does look like both an enjoyable game and a quietly disruptive one. It&#x27;s also struck a chord with me inasmuch as it&#x27;s a new way into the culture of a sport which I have pretty mixed feelings about.

                              <span>A master thief creeps over cobbles in an early modern metropolis that splits the difference between Edinburgh, Glasgow and Liverpool. Lit by gaslamps that can’t quite dispel the industrial haze, they pass for a civilian - a rough one, admittedly, but not shady enough to cause an itch in the swordarm of any passing guard.
Until, that is, they take to the thieves’ highway - following the trajectory of their grappling hook upward to the rooftops, from which they can see the shape of the city, and the moon beyond. Up here, it’s a parallel world - the trees on street level answered by chimney stacks, and the distant hills echoed by the rise and fall of steep gables. “We’re super proud of these rooftops,” says Greg LoPiccolo. “It’s an amazing landscape that we put a lot of thought and effort into, and it’s a lot of fun to traverse.”
Back in 1998, LoPiccolo was the game director who saw Thief: The Dark Project to completion. Today - after an 18 year detour to Harmonix to lead projects like Guitar Hero and Rock Band, among other adventures - he’s the game director of Thick as Thieves. “It really is an opportunity to do something unique and cool and new, on the shoulders of this stuff that is now well-respected,” he says. “Thief has some legs, right? People still talk about it to some degree.”

Several movie studios hope to convince the court otherwise, as that would strengthen their piracy enforcement efforts, making it easier to identify online pirates. According to Cox, however, Congress clearly excluded ISPs from this legal &#x27;shortcut&#x27;.

The trailer also treats us to a few snippets of the game&#x27;s story scenes, shoot-outs and punch-ups. We get to see wise guys swinging knives, riding horses and glowering silently at sun-baked Sicilian countryside.

                              <span>Tonight is The Game Awards 2024, the first since Geoff Keighley killed E3 and consumed its heart in front of a group of screaming schoolchildren. Just saying, this had better be good, Geoff, especially after the 2023 show’s &quot;embarrassing&quot; shooing-off of developers whose acceptance speeches cut into that valuable trailer showcase time.
Who will need to please wrap it up this time? Which games will be revealed? Will there be a musical number to top last year’s Herald of Darkness performance? (That was fun, actually, fair play on that one.) You can find out right along with us, as we once again fire up the RPS liveblog-o-tron to report all the developments as they happen. Even the ones that happen at 3:45am, when I’ll be desperately trying not to collapse into my keyboard like a felled tree.

                              <span>At first I thought Marvel Rivals was basically rebranded Overwatch, in the way it&#x27;s a free-to-play PVP hero shooter. And in some ways, it is. Fights are like if you took a MOBA and forced both teams to bash heads constantly. Success lies in picking off Spider-Man or Squirrel Girl or Marcus Fenix so as they wait to respawn, you hop on the big area that needs capturing. Or you push the cart while tanky Hulk absorbs bullets with his biceps and John Marvel snipes from afar.
The more I played Rivals, though, the more it hit me that it&#x27;s specifically a messier, more complex Overwatch. A hero shooter with a surprising amount of polish and charm, sure, but also one that slides off my brain like water off Birdman&#x27;s back. I understand why it&#x27;s supremely popular at the moment and yet, I really don&#x27;t.

                              <span>After a failure-riddled start, my attempt to turn S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2’s mutants into beasts of war is finally bearing fruit. I’ve engineered a Bloodsucker attack that wiped out the worst of villains – someone who was mean to me – and I’ve progressed far enough to really open up the map, and with it, access to more of the Zone’s fiercest fleshwarps.
Also, rats. Buoyed by the successful Bloodsucker siccing, I’m back on the trail of some mysterious anomaly scanners, and word is I might find a lead inside a local maze of wrecked cars. It’s heavily guarded by some gangster types, but for once, I won’t have to dash off in search of some far-off muties and coax them back here using my neck as bait. Mercifully, a gaggle of overgrown rodents are already hopping around right outside the labyrinth’s entrance. I beckon them in like a bouncer on his last day, then sprint past the stunned gunmen, who can barely shoulder their rifles before being set upon by a pack of giant carnivorous hamsters.

                              <span>In more ways than one, today’s Total War: Warhammer 3 expansion marks a milestone for game director Rich Aldridge and his team at Creative Assembly. Omens Of Destruction’s three headline legendary lords each bring new campaigns and units for their respective factions, but it’s the fourth lord - a Khorne champion free to all players - that I imagine Aldridge will end up remembering the most fondly.
When Total War: Warhammer released back in 2016, it shipped with eight legendary lords - famous characters from Games Workshop’s fantasy setting that here act as faction leaders. The number grew steadily and, in terms of announcement order at least, today’s addition of Arbaal The Undefeated marks the series’ 100th. That&#x27;s a hundred campaigns, a hundred joint efforts of game design, animation, art, writing and voice work.
Aldridge has never been shy about the team’s ambition for the series to eventually offer up each unit from every Fantasy Battle 6th edition army book (&quot;The goal is to do everything, right?&quot;). But ambition is one thing, and considering the fraught conditions at Creative Assembly and parent company Sega over the past few years, it’s not just the addition of the 100th lord that feels like something to celebrate. It’s taken time, effort, and a siesmic shift in update frequency, but Total War: Warhammer III is in the best place it&#x27;s ever been.

                              <span>If Space Marine 2&#x27;s wanton devil-mulching left you hungry for more fantastical depictions of medieval zealotry, maybe take a look at Band Of Crusaders, an open-world party-based RPG in which you are the Grandmaster of a knightly order, trying to keep a bunch of wily Archdemons out of Europe. It seems to play a bit like XCOM, with an oppressive world map that is slowly encroached upon as you travel around recruiting soldiers, interacting with settlements, and picking real-time fights with hellfiends &quot;inspired by biblical descriptions and European folklore&quot;. Naturally, parallels with real-life xenophobia and sectarian hatred abound. Here&#x27;s the trailer.

                              <span>If your PC has ever started randomly roaring, and you check Steam only to find Space Marine 2 is panic-installing a 9 billion gigabyte update, then perhaps Valve&#x27;s new upcoming feature is for you. For most of us, Steam simply slurps down fresh gigs of installed games automatically when a new update is released (and sometimes schedules the updates according to its own capricious whims).

Rock Paper Shotgun’s CMS (content management system) even has a built-in widget that shouts at me if I don’t write at least 250 words. &quot;Page 1 body content is quite short&quot; it says if I go under. How cute is that &quot;quite&quot;? I love being fooled into getting charmed by automated systems via colloquial British understatement. Anyway, I bring this up because I honestly don’t have anything to add about Blippo+. I just wanted to inform you all of its existence. It&#x27;s a &quot;casual&quot; &quot;FMV&quot; &quot;Cinematic&quot; &quot;Pixel Graphics&quot; &quot;1980s&quot; digital product from developers also named Blippo+, as well as publishers Panic, who&#x27;ve previously unleashed the horrible goose and Thank Goodness You’re Here! on the world.

One person sloughs off a piece of themselves, shapes it, wraps it, and sends it out into the world in the hope that it might mean something to someone else. Other people do this for us all the time and mostly we don&#x27;t even notice. The work is unseen and unremarked upon even as, through repetition, we come to depend upon it. Until, one day, that light that they shine can&#x27;t be seen. Maybe you left home, or maybe they did, but now it&#x27;s your turn to perform such acts of kindness. To carry the tradition forward for others - and for yourself.

Friends, it&#x27;s time to play Skeal.

                              <span>Infamous evolutionary flop Spore, for all its flaws, still had a lot of magic to it. It was fun to design your weird creatures, to watch them try to walk, and - in principle - to turn your humble creations into a spacefaring species.

Curiosmos is a very different game, but it has a little of the same appeal. It&#x27;s a galactic playground in which you smash meteors together to make planets, then tinker with the ecosystems of those planets to make life and watch that life evolve. All while a hungry black hole lingers nearby, eager to consume everything you have created. There&#x27;s an explanatory video below.

The differences are myriad, given that Breaker is also 3D, open world, co-op and a roguelite. It also now has a release date for its launch into Steam Early Access: January 14th, 2025.

It&#x27;s about steering a tank through a desolate sci-fi landscape, blasting similar tank and mecha enemies to bits, then scavenging them for parts using a drone.

It&#x27;s been in quiet development for years, but it got a big reveal during tonight&#x27;s Day Of The Devs stream. It was also released during tonight&#x27;s Day Of The Devs stream, so you can buy it from the Epic Games Store now.

Fortunately, I was rolling a Witch - perhaps the best beginner POE2 class - so I could summon an army of skeletons in response. A similar horde vs horde encounter is underway at POE 2 developers Grinding Gear Games. The game launched in early access over the weekend, and has already drawn so many players that the developers are emergency-hiring additional staff to cope with the waves of support emails.

Sampling the demo, I was immediately enflamed by the orchestral score and placed in a mood of white-gloved sophistication only slightly spoiled by the familiarity of the underlying platform moveset, and by my repeatedly falling into pits.

Back then, it was only available as a free-to-play browser or itch.io experience. Seven years later, though, and on this very day, it&#x27;s out on Steam. Not only that, it&#x27;s arriving with all the tramming of the original, with an added &quot;scheduled mode&quot; that adds more charm to an already lovely game.

Quite specific of you, but a new documentary from Noclip might just have what you’re looking for. The Past, Present &amp; Future of Soul Reaver interviews key developers from the action adventure game, and about halfway through host Danny O’ Dwyer gets hold of some archive materials, including old audition tapes. These include Mark Hamill reading for Janos Audren, and Jennifer Hale for Ariel.
The biggest treat, of course, is hearing Hayter read for Raziel, especially as it’s that excellent opening monologue. You’ll find the video below, with Hayter around 37:30.

                              <span>The Steam Deck OLED has joined Valve’s Certified Refurbished programme, offering a much cheaper way of getting your hands on the best handheld PC around. Provided you don’t mind it being in someone else’s first, anyway. As with official refurbs of the original Steam Deck, &quot;certified&quot; Steam Deck OLEDs are formerly-broken models that have been returned to Valve, fixed up and tested in-house, then put back on the market at steep discounts. You’re looking at £389/$439 for the 512GB spec and £459/$519 for 1TB, down from £479/$549 and £569/$649 respectively.

                              <span>I am a Winter baby. My birthday is very close to Christmas, and so you’d think this might make me immune to the serotonin-sapping effects of the greyest season in a “I was born of the cold. Moulded by it” kind of way. No such luck, I’m afraid. So, since there’s only so many Vitamin D supplements and delightfully festive lunchtime Gin and Tonics one can consume, I figured I’d ask: what are your favourite comfort games for the bleaker months? The special places you can always rely on for an escape when the weather outside is frightful, and the Cosy Fireplace Ambience 4K (10 hours) keeps getting interrupted by adverts for crypto scammers and War Thunder.

                              <span>While it’s always worth starting a new game of Cyberpunk 2077 just to hear Judy say &quot;his own choomba shot him!&quot; for the thirtieth time, there’s now a slightly more tangible reason to start a new journey into Night City’s open world. Update 2.2 went live yesterday, bringing with it a host of fixes, as well as some deeper customisation options for both your character and vehicles. The base game is also 55% off on Steam until the 18th of December, with the Phantom Liberty expansion at 20% off, or both in a 48% off bundle. Cyberpunk is on sale often enough, although these current discounts line up with the cheapest it&#x27;s ever been on Steam. Again: worth it for the line.

Animal Crossingbut. To be more specific, it&#x27;s Animal Crossing but your chibi fox protagonist is specifically running a shop, mending and painting objects to sell while maintaining cleanliness and the plants outside.
