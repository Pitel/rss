                              <span>It&#x27;s easy to place Dark Souls 2 in your crosshairs and take aim at its differences. Its map doesn&#x27;t intertwine like Dark Souls 1 or 3. Lots of bosses do that thing where they summon in some mates and it&#x27;s quite annoying. The atmosphere lacked that magic glaze. And yet, its quirks and frustrations make it one of my favourites.

                              <span>I toyed around with this intro a lot, because I didn’t want to start with a super pessimistic bang. But, for lack of a nicer way to put it, I’ll simply say things are looking pretty scary out there, huh? Capitalism is failing, the economy is crumbling, and normal people have nothing left to give. It’s something I&#x27;ve been thinking about a lot lately, but I don’t really talk about it. I keep it all inside, like a microwave holding a ball of tin foil while it spins on full power.
At least, that was the case until I played Citizen Sleeper. It’s a rather simple RPG inspired by tabletop roleplaying games, giving you a limited number of action dice that you can spend each day to receive consequences. Mechanically, it doesn’t stretch much further than those actions and consequences, meaning I can instead focus on connecting with characters. In its simplicity, I found a cathartic way to process my thoughts on lots of scary stuff happening in our actual world. I also realised that Starfield, the big space game looming on the horizon which I was previously pretty excited about, just doesn’t seem appealing anymore.

                              <span>Lunistice is a 3D platformer inspired by the PSX/Sega Saturn era, but its high-speed movement reminds me of Sonic’s 3D adventures, in a good way. Out today on PC and Switch, it was originally developed by solo dev A Grumpy Fox as a small 30-day project, but it quickly ballooned into something larger. It&#x27;s now been over a year since A Grumpy Fox first started work on the game, but I think you can agree from the announcement trailer below, it&#x27;s been time well spent.

This week we&#x27;re talking about games that make us feel like proper cool people, just like you - who, I emphasise again, are a very cool person. Matthew is not cool enough to be here this week, but I am joined by Nate, who is the king of cool (and crabs).
There&#x27;s a Cavern Of Lies to test Nate&#x27;s coolness, and we check in with Henry &quot;The Vit&quot; Cavill, but first, of course, we must litigate the different kinds of cool we feel, what counts as cool, and which games make us feel the coolest.

Players have forged remakes of classic Halo maps and entirely new designs that give us a peek at what’s possible in the engine. If you’re unfamiliar, Forge is a long-time Halo feature that allows players to create and edit their own maps and modes, leading to some of the most fun experiences in the franchise. Let’s take a look at the community’s creativity.

Jagex will also support the existing Earthlock along with development of the previously announced sequel, Earthlock 2.

                              <span>I’m of the strong and perhaps completely nonsensical opinion that any game is better when it’s set on an island. School me in the comments, please do, but I suspect that Escape Academy: Escape From Anti-Escape Island, new DLC launching for the puzzle game today, might lend my claim some extra weight. That could always be the baggage plummeting from the sky over Anti-Escape Island though, where a summer vacation for the students of Escape Academy has gone very, very wrong. Check out the trailer below.

                              <span>Art posted to Civilization 6’s mobile site has revealed an as yet unannounced Leaders Pass DLC, which seems to include classic leaders from older games in the Civ series. Former US President Abraham Lincoln and Egyptian pharaoh Ramesses II are clearly visible in the artwork. Alongside them are Ngola Nzinga of Ndongo, and someone wearing a ruff that I’m going to have to assume is either Queen Elizabeth I or Mary, Queen of Scots, because That Hair. Please correct me if I’m wrong.

                              <span>Last night’s Nintendo Indie showcase gave us fresh looks at many exciting indies. Chief among them was Storyteller, a narrative-puzzle game we first saw ten years ago, and has now confirmed a release date of March 23rd. The game’s comic-strip puzzles let you remix classic stories, like Dracula, using various props, verbs and nouns. A game for all the literary nerds out there.

In a statement to GamesIndustry.biz, ZA/UM - the studio that developed Disco Elysium - confirmed the reasons several employees were fired last year. These include &quot;limited to no engagement in their responsibilities&quot;, &quot;creating a toxic work environment&quot;, &quot;verbal abuse and gender discrimination&quot;, and attempting to sell ZA/UM&#x27;s IP to other companies.

Still, it’s one to take with a pinch of salt, which probably wards off the undead too. There’s been no word from devs Arkane on whether rumblings of a Redfall beta are legit yet, but The Game Awards are only a few weeks away so we might see something announced there.

                              <span>Say what you will about Square Enix&#x27;s ill-fated ventures into NFTs and mildly embarrassing follies with live service games recently. Their commitment to remaking, remastering and generally sprucing up their ageing back catalogue from decades past is an admirable one in my eyes, even if they are making you pay through the nose for them almost every single time. As we all know, though, some have made more successful transitions than others. The dream, of course, at least for me, is the Final Fantasy VII Remake approach for literally everything, no matter how unfeasible, impractical or physically impossible that would be for Squeenix&#x27;s enormous game library. Alas, the reality is often a lot more modest. Best case scenario: you&#x27;re a 90s SNES game getting a lovely HD-2D makeover like Live A Live. Next on the rung: some added 3D zhuzh a la Final Fantasy VIII Remastered (although even that was by no means perfect). 
Mostly, though, it&#x27;s your Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster treatment. A welcome update that maintains the look of the originals (albeit with some questionable font choices), but that&#x27;s more or less your lot. Tactics Ogre: Reborn, a remaster of the 2010 PSP remake of the 1995 SNES original, falls squarely into the latter camp, but you know what? That&#x27;s fine. It&#x27;s still a rollicking turn-based tactics game all these years later, and one that definitely deserves to be freed from the shackles of Sony&#x27;s long-dead handheld, where it&#x27;s lain dormant for the better part of a decade. Besides, I&#x27;ll take a fully re-orchestrated soundtrack over slightly fancier pixels any day of the week. You know me.

As that’s less than a week away now, it’s a good job there’s loads of info about everything, from the game’s battle pass overhaul to the incoming story-based DMZ extraction mode.

MindGeek defeated the pirate site in court and also secured more than $32 million in damages. The verdict comes after the court previously denied a broad injunction that required hosting and CDN providers to take action as well.

                              <span>Usually, you play a few hours of a game and you can confidently give your thoughts on it.

Beyond our coverage of Street Fighter 6 in the latest issue of Game Informer, issue 351 also includes a deep dive into Tchia, and the unusual trip where we learned more about the game.  
Tchia is created by the development studio known as Awaceb. Awaceb’s founders grew up in a small French territory east of Australia called New Caledonia, and this debut game from the studio is inspired by their childhood there. I visited New Caledonia in September, and joined the team from Awaceb to learn more about the culture, peoples, and geography that make it such a memorable place.  
Check out the new issue to discover more about the trip and the game.
Our video below features a small part of the lovely Tchia soundtrack alongside glimpses of video taken during the trip, as well as gameplay footage of Tchia.  


Tchia is set to release in early 2023 on PS5, PS4, and PC.

                              <span>We recently traveled to Osaka, Japan, for our Street Fighter 6 cover story. While we were in the city, Game Informer video editor Alex Van Aken and I thought it would be a great idea to take advantage of our proximity to Universal Studios Japan to visit Super Nintendo World. Like you, we saw the tour provided by the legendary Shigeru Miyamoto, but we needed to see it for ourselves. And to be quite frank, we are so glad that we did.
It&#x27;s impossible to fully convey how cool most of our time at Super Nintendo World was. From the moment we exited the giant warp pipe at the entrance, we felt transported into an actual Mario game. Check out the photos from our time at Super Nintendo World to get a sense of how incredible the experience is.
First, we had to reserve a time to enter that particular…</span>

                              <span>With Stadia’s impending shutdown in January, Google has begun fulfilling its promise of issuing refunds to its customers. The process started yesterday, and Google has posted an FAQ breaking down how the refund process works. 
As previously announced, Google is refunding all software purchases through the Stadia Store (such as games, DLC, in-game currency, and current pre-orders) and hardware purchases made through the Google Store; physical store purchases cannot be refunded. Eligible hardware includes:
Stadia Controller
Founder&#x27;s Edition
Premiere Edition
Play and Watch with Google TV packages
Stadia Pro subscriptions will not be refunded, but members can play their Pro titles until the shutdown. However, those who purchased a subscription on or after September 29, 2022, and were charged for it will have that money returned. 
Refunds will be issued to the form of payment used to make the purchase. If that account is no longer available, Google will send an email with instructions for setting up an alternative method of receiving the refund.
Users may have already received an email notifying them of their refund status. Although payments are now being issued, that doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll get yours today or this week. This will be a gradual rollout that will continue up until January 18. There&#x27;s no way of knowing when you&#x27;ll receive your refund, so eligible users should keep an eye on their inbox and bank account over the coming days or weeks.</span>

                              <span>Dig it!
Publisher Skybound Games has announced a release window for the intriguing and spectacularly silly-looking wrestling RPG WrestleQuest — As reported during yesterday&#x27;s Nintendo Indie World Showcase, the day-glo grappler will launch on PC and console platforms in May 2023.
As we have previously reported, WrestleQuest is a unique spin on the typical RPG adventure title, as will charge players with taking their custom superstar through the territories in a bid to become the pro-wrestling king of the 1980s. Along the way, the rookie will team with, (or oppose), a who&#x27;s who of 30 genuine pro-wrestling legends, including &quot;Macho Man&quot; Randy Savage, Koko B. Ware, Jake &quot;The Snake&quot; Roberts, The Road Warriors, Sgt. Slaughter, and Andre the Giant.
Also, Jeff Jarrett is in the mix.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;AtpjlXOviKA
WrestleQuest incorporates fun pixel visuals, as well as a novel &quot;Hasbro figure&quot; look to each of its ring legends. As you can see from the above trailer, matches play out in turn-based fashion, with a wide variety of strikes, holds, throws, and specials available to our roster of ring-rockers. One gal even shows up on a motorbike, which might be considered cheating, all things considered. Another fun moment sees Andre show up to bodyslam the entire ring! Good work, boss.
As the player progresses through their star-spangled career, they will be given the option to customize their wardrobe, gimmick, and entrance to ensure that they become the talk of the town... or at least The Observer. With its tongue firmly stuck in its cheek, and some rad-looking visual design. I&#x27;m definitely looking forward to seeing whether this underdog delivers a five-and-a-half star matchup when it finally emerges from the locker room.
Add Bull Nakano and this is going to be my GOTY 2023.
WrestleQuest launches May 2023 on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.

As we head into the holiday season, it&#x27;s time to get used to packed eShop weeks. This time we have 40ish games, and several surprise releases thanks to the recent Indie World Showcase.
Rogue Legacy 2 surprise-dropped last night on Switch (after arriving in April of this year on PC), but we also have A Little to the Left, Once Upon a Jester, Milk inside a bag of milk inside a bag of milk and Milk outside a bag of milk outside a bag of milk, Tactics Ogre: Reborn, and Aragami 2. Those are the core releases that Nintendo chose to highlight, and the very real full title of Milk inside of a bag of milk.

                              <span>Don&#x27;t overthink it!
There are a ton of different types of puzzles in Sonic Frontiers, and not all of them are going to be simple.
This one is, thankfully! But you just need to not overthink it and just go for it.

Locating the Sonic Frontiers M-043 puzzle
So the M-043 puzzle can be found on Ares Island, where Knuckles is located. It&#x27;s actually the second main hub you&#x27;ll visit in Sonic Frontiers.
To find it, you&#x27;ll want to head to the central part of the island, which can be easily accessed through the western ruins entrance. Make your way to the location with the orange beacon with the red arrow pointing at it in the map above.

Solving the Sonic Frontiers M-043 puzzle
To solve this puzzle, you&#x27;ll need to make use of the Cyloop ability. Again, you can trigger that with the Triangle/Y (on Xbox) buttons while running. Create a Cyloop beam around the blue fire pits in the order above. So Cyloop around column one first, then two, then three, then four, then five.
Once you&#x27;ve done that, the puzzle will pop, you&#x27;ll get a little more of the map, and you&#x27;ll get a reward (in our case, it was a Seed of Defense).

While Street Fighter 6 is already hoping to on-board new players with its simplified &quot;Modern&quot; control option, Capcom&#x27;s development team are looking to go one step further, with the addition of an A.I. driven &quot;Dynamic&quot; system, that looks to make even the most rabid button-mashed into a World Warrior.
As demonstrated during an interview with Game Informer, the Street Fighter 6 Dynamic control option will literally ascertain a player&#x27;s position on screen, and will throw out one of a number of strikes, moves, specials, and supers based on the current mise en scene. Once activated, Dynamic mode will literally allow players to mash attack buttons and have those random presses transformed into useful maneuvers.
You can check out the feature in the video below, courtesy of Game Informer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;vkRXTVd51dE
Now, of course, while Modern controls already offer up something of a gateway to newer players, Dynamic is truly for beginners, youngsters, and those who just want to smash buttons and hope for the best. It also fits in as another addition to the sequel&#x27;s impressive list of accessibility options. As such, the mode will be locked to local play only, and will not be a viable option for online matches. It&#x27;s another fine addition to the overall Street Fighter 6 package, which continues to impress month by month with its myriad modes, options, and attention to the small details.
A Capcom employee once told me that a key goal of the SF6 team was to deliver a game that felt &quot;full&quot; at launch. So far, they&#x27;re doing a magnificent job at sticking to that idiom.

Although Knight is technically the third major boss you&#x27;ll encounter in Sonic Frontiers, it&#x27;s actually one of the easiest to defeat.

Getting the Chaos Emerald to turn into Super Sonic
Like the rest of the key gigantic bosses, you&#x27;ll need to make your way to the top of Knight to actually trigger the Super Sonic transformation and deal damage.
Knight will mostly throw out slow attacks, so have your finger on the R2/RT (dash) button and dodge them manually. After they raise their hand to slam the ground, that&#x27;s when your opportunity to strike is about to start.
Wait for them to hit the ground, then run up and slide on the rails. You&#x27;ll grind up to their head, and the game will prompt you to pick up the Chaos Emerald.

Even without a lot of upgrades, Kni…</span>

                              <span>Ezio once was king, but there&#x27;s been so much since then
There&#x27;s a reason Ubisoft kept making so many Ezio-centric Assassin&#x27;s Creed games: people bought them! But as Origins moved in and established a new broader formula, the series has continued to change with the times.
With the dust settled on Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla, here&#x27;s the five best AC games, having played all of them.

5 - Assassin&#x27;s Creed 2
Giving credit where credit is due, Ezio actually does make this top five list (twice!).
While Assassin&#x27;s Creed 2 was somewhat polarizing in the wider gaming community, it&#x27;s also credited with bringing the series to higher highs; establishing the counter-based combat system that would eventually spread to other action adventure games. It was the blueprint for so much following it, and the Ita…</span>

                              <span>Network campaign co-op and campaign mission replays are among what&#x27;s added
I enjoyed Halo Infinite at launch, but there was a lot that was promised that needed to eventually make it in. It seems as if this November update is going to make due on a lot of prior delays.
Here are the main sticking points of the Halo Infinite 2022 November Patch:
Network campaign co-op (four player co-op in the campaign)
Campaign mission replay (this seems like a launch type feature, but it&#x27;s here now)
More campaign achievements (420 additional Gamerscore)
Forge mode (in beta form)
Season pass progression updates (more of a focus on match XP)
A 30-tier winter battle pass is live
Studio 343 explains that you can play the &quot;entire Halo Infinite campaign together&quot; with up to four players in total, so it doesn&#x27;t seem like a half-measure. As for the Forge, 343 stresses that it&#x27;s in beta form: &quot;Halo Infinite Forge mode is currently in a beta state, meaning that additional improvements are planned. The Forge Beta will support canvas maps and not developer-made maps (such as Live Fire, Recharge, Fragmentation, etc.). Support for developer-made maps will be implemented in a future update.&quot;
Weirdly, 343 still hasn&#x27;t figured out battle pass progression yet, and will be implementing a &quot;match XP beta&quot; (what?) on top of the challenge system.
Here&#x27;s a brief look at the changes to Halo Infinite&#x27;s XP progression system:
Arena Match Complete: 150 XP
Big Team Battle (BTB) Match Complete: 250 XP
Featured Match Complete: 200 XP
Winning Team: 50 XP
Match MVP: 50 XP
Top 50% of Team: 50 XP
Free-For-All placement

1st: 150 XP
2nd: 100 XP
3rd: 50 XP
4th: 50 XP
5th: 50 XP
If you can believe it, progression systems in live service games that have been in operation for nearly a year need betas.

The Overwatch team has put in a lot of effort over the past few years to help make the game as enjoyable for players as possible by curbing toxicity, and one of the best moves in that direction was adding endorsements to the game.
Apparently, the mechanic helped curb bad behavior by 40% back in 2019 when they were first added. Originally introduced back in the days of the first Overwatch game, endorsements are a way for players to reward their teammates for good behavior, like good communication, teamwork, or just generally good play. Back in the day, they were broken out into categories like &quot;Shot Caller&quot; or &quot;Good Teammate,&quot; but now you get awarded with a simple &quot;Endorsement.&quot;
So the endorsement system in Overwatch 2 has obviousl…</span>

We already took you through a guided tour of how to beat Giganto in the first Sonic Frontiers island: so now it&#x27;s time for the next big bad in line.
Wyvern, just like the other core bosses in the game, requires a bit of platforming before the fight can really begin.

Getting the Chaos Emerald to turn into Super Sonic
While it&#x27;s not a puzzle per se, Sonic Frontiers plops you into a little sandbox arena and asks you to manually kick off the battle. Wyvern will be flying aimlessly above in the sky, and to engage them, you need to climb up a tower and get the final Chaos Emerald to power up into Super Sonic.

                              <span>Production still continues for Haunted Chocolatier, too
There are so many moving parts at this point for Stardew Valley, it can be tough to keep track of! Basically, most versions have welcomed the packed 1.5 update a while back: except mobile. But that&#x27;s still set to change by the end of the year.
Here&#x27;s the full picture from developer Eric &quot;ConcernedApe&quot; Barone, recently shared on Twitter:
&quot;Hey everyone, happy &#x27;ween (spirit&#x27;s eve). I know I haven&#x27;t been too active lately, but don&#x27;t worry, I&#x27;m still here. And mobile 1.5 update is still on track for what I said last: &#x27;Before the end of the year.&#x27; Thank you&quot;

&quot;What they said last&quot; was roughly three months ago: but in this era of constant delays and production issues, it&#x27;s great to have a more up-to-date window. When asked about progress on Haunted Chocolatier by a fan, Barone reminded folks that they were working on it (citing &quot;yeah a little&quot; when quizzed on whether or not they&#x27;ve been working on spooky in-game ghosts), so there&#x27;s a lot to be done and micro-manage.
Barone has thankfully fostered a healthy environment of patience, as Stardew Valley fans trust in the process, and recognize Barone&#x27;s limitations as a mostly solo developer. It&#x27;s a great place to be, but they&#x27;ve earned that trust.

                              <span>It can get pretty annoying
Sonic Frontiers has some wacky puzzles, and this callback to Sonic&#x27;s pinball days is easily near the top of the list.
Here&#x27;s how to finish the somewhat confusing sequence.

Sonic Frontiers: Clear the pinball game and solve the puzzle of the Ancients&#x27; gate
Your goal is to achieve the confusingly named &quot;get&quot; score (at the top right hand corner of the screen). You have control over the left and right flippers, but nothing else, and there&#x27;s no &quot;shake&quot; button. Try not to ever hit the &quot;cease operation&quot; button, or you&#x27;ll have to start over from scratch again.
Prioritize red rings
So you&#x27;ll want to aim for the red rings as soon as they appear, as they grant instant score multipliers. No matter where they are, it&#x27;s important to try and grab them fast, so you can clear the…</span>

God of War Ragnarok introduces the player to all manner of characters, pulled from the annals of Norse mythology and thrust in the paths of protagonists Kratos and Atreus — And while many of these figures may be relatively unknown, one father &amp; son duo will be recognized by all: The mighty king Odin and his thunderous offspring, Thor.
As God of War Ragnarok focuses its story on the titular event, said to bring about the destruction of the gods and devastation to the planet, it figures that Odin and Thor both have a very important part to play in the game&#x27;s narrative. As such, it was vitally important that Sony Santa Monica nailed the casting for both roles — hiring actors who could portray the stoicism, strength, and utter intimidation radiating from the regal warriors.…</span>

We are just several weeks into the era of &quot;Elon Musk owns Twitter&quot;, and already there are major new issues involving the validation and verification of genuine accounts — Yesterday saw an early example of the chaos to come as fake &quot;Verified&quot; accounts popped up for major gaming companies such as Nintendo, Twitch, and Rockstar Games.
Perhaps the most notable and egregious of these was the &quot;@nintendoofus&quot; account, which simply posted a surprising render of Mario flipping the bird. A simple reply &quot;Mario would never do that :(&quot; added further melancholy humor to the situation. The account itself remains live as of this writing, although its paid-for &quot;verification&quot; tick has been removed.

                              <span>When you&#x27;re strange...
Publisher Ysbryd Games has announced that its creepy, lo-fi RPG World of Horror will finally exit its Early Access status in the summer of 2023 — Soon thereafter, the pointillistic petrifier (oh yes) will receive its long-awaited official launch on PlayStation, PC, and Nintendo Switch platforms.
Developed by one-man Polish studio Panstasz, World of Horror is a graphic adventure horror title in the vein of classic DOS and Amiga text adventures such as Personal Nightmare, WaxWorks, and Elvira: Mistress of the Dark, blended with a meticulously itchy aesthetic that blends the horrors of manga artists such as Junji Ito with intricate, but rudimentary, MS Paint visuals. The result is a game that feels like it shouldn&#x27;t be getting inside your head, but is somehow able to do so. And with relative ease.

Set in the town of Shiokawa, Japan, World of Horror follows a young investigator as they follow a series of obscure and bizarre clues, ultimately uncovering evidence of a coming apocalypse, heralded by a platoon of grotesque creatures. The player engages in turn-based combat with these monstrosities in their efforts to seek out the truth about armageddon and, hopefully, discover a way to prevent it.
World of Horror launches summer 2023 on PlayStation, PC, and Nintendo Switch. It is available in early access now on the Steam platform. You can check out Jordan Devore&#x27;s thoughts right here.

Activision Blizzard, in association with developer Infinity Ward, has offered up some early details on its new DMZ mode, which will be rolling out in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II and its battle royale sister, Warzone 2.0 on November 16 at 10:00 PT / 13:00 ET / 19:00 BST.
While deep details were not on offer, we do now know that DMZ will operate within Warzone 2.0 and will consist of an open-world, narrative-driven multiplayer mission for players and their squad buddies. Teams will be given free rein to complete a series of core missions, accept side objectives, and battle it out with other operators and A.I. bots. From this early description, it almost sounds like DMZ is an amalgamation of previous Call of Duty multiplayer experiences, such as Fireteam and Zombies... Except without the zombies.

The brief blurb also seems to confirm the CoD community&#x27;s suspicions that DMZ is to be Call of Duty&#x27;s take on Battlestate Games&#x27; own long-running shooter Escape From Tarkov. Launched in open beta way back in 2017, Escape From Tarkov is another open-world military shooter that tasks squads of players with gathering intel, completing missions, and exfiltrating from the battlezone, all while engaging in bullet-pumping firefights with bots and other players.
DMZ will launch as part of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2/Warzone 2.0&#x27;s Season One content, which will include new Warzone map Al Mazrah — complete with revamped Gulag mode — as well as a fistful of new operators, weapons, vehicles, and modes, all of which will roll out over the coming weeks. For full details on all season one content, check out the official Call of Duty website.

                              <span>But don&#x27;t forget what Cory Barlog said a while back
[Warning: Vague spoilers for God of War Ragnarok are found on this page.]
God of War is a complicated beast. At this point the budgets are fairly insane, and there&#x27;s only so many hours of the day to work on AAA games. One of the leads of the series agrees, which gives us a clear idea of where God of War might go after Ragnarok.
When interviewed by Kaptain Kuba on YouTube, God of War boss Cory Barlog explained why he thought it would be best for the Norse arc to end in two games:
&quot;The most important reason is: the first game took five years. The second game, I don&#x27;t know how long it&#x27;s going to take, close to a similar time. If you think wow a third one, that&#x27;s a span of close to 15 years of a single story. I feel like that&#x27;s just too stretched out. We&#x27;re asking too much to say the actual completion, of the story, it takes too long. Given where Eric [Williams] was at, I thought we can actually do this in the second story. The core of the story&#x27;s engine is really the relationship between [Atreus and Kratos] and the complexity radiates out like ripples in a pond. We could make it an ocean and have those ripples go thousands of miles...but is that beneficial?&quot;

Without giving away too much, suffice to say that Atreus and Kratos&#x27; journey could go on after Ragnarok; and given the massive critical and commercial success of the game already, it&#x27;s probably a sure thing. Will the core team want to devote their lives to another five year journey, is the real question.
Maybe we&#x27;ll get another mythological road trip through another civilization and set of Gods, or perhaps Atreus himself will be the focal point this time around: with the same actor, naturally aged up.

The atmospheric and critically acclaimed puzzler Inscryption is headed to the Nintendo Switch platform in just a matter of weeks, following on from its warmly received launch on PC and PlayStation platforms. Publisher Devolver Digital announced the news during yesterday&#x27;s Nintendo Indie World showcase.
Developed by Daniel Mullins Games (of Pony Island and The Hex fame), Inscryption is a skin-crawling creepy puzzle game that blends elements of RPGs, roguelikes, and deckbuilding card games to create a uniquely weird and nightmarish experience. Inscryption masterfully blends these various gaming genres while unfolding its own in-game lore in smart and immersive fashion. In the vein of titles such as Doki Doki Literature Club, Inscryption is a game best experienced, rather than explained.
Inscryption launches on Nintendo Switch December 1. It is available now on PC and PlayStation.

One of the concerns people have with any competitive free-to-play game is whether or not you’re playing against real people or bots. It’s not unusual to find bots across all competitive online games. Many online games use bots as a way of gently introducing the player to the game before putting them up against human opponents. For most competitive games, the longer you play, the less likely it is you’ll face AI opponents. As Marvel Snap is the hottest free-to-play mobile game on the market right now, many have been asking if there are Marvel Snap bots. And the answer is yes. In fact, you’ll face bots for quite some time.
When you first start playing Marvel Snap, you’ll go through the tutorial and what’s known as the Recruit Season Pass. In both of these instances, you’…</span>

As a fan of both literature and puzzle games, Storyteller has been one of my most anticipated games of the year. The game takes place in the pages of a storybook, and requires players to combine different elements like characters, settings, and objects to create coherent stories. There are multiple ways to solve each puzzle, making for some fun, creative, and challenging gameplay. Storyteller was first announced during last year&#x27;s Annapurna Interactive Showcase, which showed off the basic mechanics of the game in a short trailer. After almost a year and a half of waiting, Annapurna finally announced Storyteller&#x27;s official release date for Steam and Nintendo Switch: March 23, 2023.

For evaluating the EPYC Genoa performance under Linux, AMD kindly provided review samples of the EPYC 9654 flagship 96-core processor, the EPYC 9554 64-core processor, and the EPYC 9374F 32-core high frequency CPU. In today&#x27;s benchmark review I am looking at the EPYC 9554/9654 CPUs while the EPYC 9374F will be featured in its own review in the coming days on Phoronix.</span>

EPYC Genoa takes AMD server processors to the new SP5 socket, up to 96 cores / 192 threads per socket, AVX-512 with Zen 4, twelve channels of DDR5 system memory, and much more -- all combined it puts AMD and the industry at new levels of HPC performance.

After last week saw almost every game in the Japanese charts being a new release, things looks to have settled down a little more in this week&#x27;s software sales.
It should come as no surprise that Splatoon 3 continues to ink its name at the top spot, but this week also sees the charting debuts of Harvestella and Doraemon Story of Seasons: Friends of the Great Kingdom in second and third place respectfully. This was a particularly good showing from Square Enix&#x27;s new farm sim, which recorded 26,644 units sold in the week.

The Tower -To The Bottom- is a real-time roguelike deckbuilding survival adventure, coming to Switch and PC with the help of manga publisher SHUEISHA (One Piece, Bleach, Naruto, Death Note) and their new video game publishing arm.

                              <span>Another day, another Twitter verification controversy.
If you have found yourself logging onto Twitter in the past 24 hours, you may have come across a picture of Mario making a somewhat unsavoury gesture, seemingly posted by the official account for Nintendo of America. Yep, we were a little confused at first too. Has Mario seen all the outpouring of Bowser love following the movie trailer and is now determined to flip-off anyone in his path? Nope. That&#x27;s not Mario, and that&#x27;s not @NintendoAmerica.
Parody accounts have been a part of Twitter since the site&#x27;s conception, but all of a sudden the discourse surrounding them has reached a whole new height thanks to the new &#x27;Twitter Blue&#x27; policy and the chance to buy &#x27;verification&#x27; status with the renowned blue tick next to your name. Of course, the parody accounts did exactly what they were always going to do and took this opportunity to post some very much off-brand content (who could have seen that coming??).

Sonic Frontiers had a bit of a wild ride ahead of its release. Since the initial announcement and subsequent trailer reveals, public opinion of the blue blur’s latest outing has been all over the place, going from lingering dread to a more optimistic “hey, maybe this will actually be okay, after all”. Well, after sinking over 20 hours into Sonic Frontiers on Switch and exploring everything the game has to offer, we have just two words that can adequately describe our feelings for this game: oh dear.
The game starts off with a brief introduction to our heroes Sonic, Tails, and Amy (don&#x27;t worry, Knuckles shows up too). After some digital hocus pocus, Sonic mysteriously winds up in one of the game’s ‘Cyberspace’ levels which, surprise surprise, is based on Green Hill Zone. This linear stage acts as a tutorial for Sonic’s basic moveset, but you’ll be able to revisit it later on to complete the optional objectives and gain extra items, if you wish. After you’re done, you’re dropped into the first of five “open-zone” locations: Kronos Island. It turns out that Sonic’s friends are missing and it’s up to you to find and rescue them.

It&#x27;s pretty widely known at this point that Game Freak, the developer behind the Pokémon franchise, used to work on print magazines before it started on video game development.
What&#x27;s not quite so well known is exactly what these magazines consist of. Well, we now have a bit of a stronger idea thanks to Twitter user Picto who has uploaded the entirety of one of Game Freak&#x27;s magazines over on Internet Archive.

Backwards compatibility is rapidly becoming easier for Nintendo than ever before. At least, that&#x27;s what Shingeru Miyamoto implied at a recent Q&amp;A following the company&#x27;s latest financial report. And while the Switch continues to build up a growing library of NES, SNES and N64 titles (if you have the NSO Expansion pass, that is) Miyamoto wants to ensure that the company remains focused on the future, despite this ease.
Reading through any Reddit forum or the comments section of an NSO announcement, it would be easy to assume that if Nintendo was to just drop a Game Boy and GBA library on the Switch then all would be well in the world. Miyamoto addressed the simplicity of this in the Q&amp;A (as translated for VGC by @Sephazon), speaking of how difficult Nintendo&#x27;s Virtual Console was in the past, before stating that all of this has changed:

To celebrate, ex-Retro Studios dev Zoid Kirsch will be sharing daily anecdotes on the development of the game leading up to the anniversary on the 18th. He&#x27;s already knocked out about five stories so far, and one in particular caught our eye for its sheer ingenuity.

After decades of gamers thirsting over the sexy, sexy female video game characters out there, it looks like our favorite virtual himbos are finally getting the mainstream attention they deserve. In case you missed it, Tiktok is currently obsessed with Ghost from Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II, and posting countless videos of scenes from the game, skits, and fan art have flooded the app. Just like the withdrawn kings to come before him like Darcy, Rochester, and Heathcliff, fans are drawn to the cold, aloof nature of a mysterious male character.
Simon &quot;Ghost&quot; Riley was first introduced in the original Modern Warfare game and its subsequent sequel, and was brought back for the reboot. He&#x27;s one of the main recurring characters in Modern Warfare II, and while I have to be honest…</span>

On higher difficulties, God of War Ragnarok keeps up some of the high tension antics of the series proper: so you may want to know about something as crucial as uh, healing.
I even went several hours thinking &quot;there&#x27;s got to be more to this:&quot; but no, it&#x27;s actually pretty straightforward.
Crack green orbs in combat
The most simple method for healing is to locate green orbs while fighting. They&#x27;ll literally appear at your feet/across the battlefield as glowing green power-ups, and interacting with them will heal you a small amount. Keep this in mind as you&#x27;re running across bigger arenas: and make a mental note of where orbs are, so you can go back to heal them like running back to a &quot;stash.&quot;
So there&#x27;s actually an options setting that will either hel…</span>

                              <span>An uneven surprise
Look, any given Sonic Team production can go wrong: it&#x27;s just a fact of life. Even if something seems like a sure thing, the &quot;Sonic Cycle&quot; is jokingly shared for a reason.
An open world Sonic game that draws upon well-liked inspirations like Zelda: Breath of the Wild seemed like something that wouldn&#x27;t be disastrous at the very least. Thankfully, it isn&#x27;t. But some of it is definitely an acquired taste.

Sonic Frontiers (PC, PS4, PS5 [reviewed], Switch, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S)
Developer: Sonic Team
Publisher: Sega
Released: November 8, 2022

Pokemon is such a massive IP that leaks are inevitable. No matter how much Nintendo tries to clamp down, some content creator is likely going to show off part of the game, and/or someone is probably going to buy it early from any number of retailers that break street date. Well the latter is exactly what happened, so be aware that Pokemon Scarlet and Violet leaks are out in the wild.
As was the case with Legends, Twitter is the main source of leak sharing. Many users are getting takedown notices from Nintendo and The Pokemon Company, leading to even more proliferation and more sharing. A heap of these do not have spoiler warning shields, and are just flying around. So you may want to mute anything Pokemon related if you use the platform regularly, or just stay off of it entirely for a bit if you&#x27;re really bothered by leaks.
Most Pokemon subreddits have extensive leak policies in place that prevent accidental reveals: including the &quot;main&quot; one, so you might be safe there.
Pokemon Scarlet/Violet: Leaks
The Pokemon Leaks reddit has compiled a full list so far, which is fully in text form. This is by far the safest place to look, as Twitter is sometimes inaccurate (people throwing in fake leaks), constantly riddled with takedowns, and hard to search.

Today sees the long-anticipated arrival of one of the biggest sequel&#x27;s in gaming history, as Sony Santa Monica&#x27;s magnum opus, God of War Ragnarok, launches on PlayStation platforms — And while Fathers and Boys everywhere will be eager to stand up against the coming wave of armageddon, the developer has suggested that you take a moment or two to download the sequel&#x27;s day one patch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;g1wr0DfV73E
The God of War Ragnarok V2 patch features over 100 tweaks and fixes, relating to the epic title&#x27;s UI, combat, controls, visual elements, dialogue, accessibility options, menus, and much, much more. There are also specific stability fixes for both PS4 and PS5. You can check out the huge list of fixes via the official patch notes, though be warned that SSM suggests that the tweaks feature minor spoilers pertaining to abilities, creatures, and questlines. The update should download as soon as you install the game.
God of War Ragnarok is the follow-up to the stellar 2018 release, God of War. The new title follows the continued adventures of an aging Kratos and his brave but somewhat inexperienced son, Atreus, as they face the coming of Ragnarok — the fabled event said to bring death and destruction to a number of gods and figures of power, while bringing chaos to the world and its climate. Quite what role our heroes will play in this event, and how it ties into the lives of their allies and enemies... Well, we&#x27;ll have to just play the game to find out.
God of War Ragnarok is available now on PlayStation platforms. Check out Chris Carter&#x27;s review right here.

                              <span>Make it a priority, Sony
When Ghost of Tsushima came out, I knew it was something special. That&#x27;s why I was waiting for the Director&#x27;s Cut/DLC package with open arms. Now I&#x27;m waiting for basically anything else. A PC port would do.
Sadly there is no confirmation at all right now that Ghost of Tsushima is even getting a PC port, but we can look at some trends and surmise that it&#x27;s likely going to happen. It was also part of that partially correct, partially incorrect Nvidia PC leak from 2021.
Here are the games Sony currently has on PC/Steam:
God of War (2018)
Spider-Man Remastered
Spider-Man: Miles Morales (out on November 18)
Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection (Uncharted 4 and Lost Legacy)
Sackboy: A Big Adventure
Note that the earliest game is God of War, and it was released in January of this year. Yep, all of the above list launched in 2022. Sony is clearly serious about porting their biggest games to PC, and if Sackboy can make the cut, a lot of other titles could too.
But Ghost of Tsushima, like many other open world games, would be incredible to mess around with on PC. I mean, just imagine the mods! And the graphical options! While it hasn&#x27;t happened yet, I&#x27;m hoping we get some form of announcement in early 2023, perhaps via a State of Play. This feels like a sure thing at this point.

Sony Santa Monica&#x27;s highly-anticipated sequel God of War Ragnarok is finally in the hands of players worldwide, who now have the opportunity to continue the epic odyssey of Kratos and Atreus as they look down the barrel of the fated cataclysm known as Ragnarok — said to bring death and destruction to the world and its Gods.
God of War Ragnarok will see our protagonists come across new and familiar faces, from the returning witch Freya to the ferocious wolf-god Fenrir and the mighty, hammer-wielding warrior Thor. Among these legends of Norse mythology, Kratos and Atreus will encounter the somber Tyr, whose limp frame and addled mind belie his ultimate identity: That of the son of Odin and the defiant Aesirian God of War.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;g1wr0DfV73E
Tyr&#x27;s mythology is somewhat muddled across various localizations, but he is generally depicted as one of the sons of Odin and the half-brother to Thor, Heimdall, Baldur, and Skjöld. A variant of Mars, Tyr takes up the role of God of War for Aesir, (as opposed to Kratos&#x27; Grecian heritage), and is usually depicted as missing a hand — torn off during the binding of the wolf-god Fenrir. While Tyr does not play as large a role in mythology as his siblings, he is nevertheless associated with themes of bravery, victory, and glory.
Tyr&#x27;s appearance in God of War Ragnarok, much like his mythological origins, starts a little inauspiciously. Found imprisoned in the dwarven caves of Svartfalfheim — his mind almost entirely lost to fear and paranoia. A shadow of the glorious God of War foretold by fate. As to whether Tyr&#x27;s senses can be restored, and what role he will play in Kratos and Atreus&#x27; journey toward the impending apocalypse, players will simply have to delve into the adventure for themselves.
God of War Ragnarok is available now on PlayStation platforms.

                              <span>Think of Hacksilver like cash
A lot of core mechanics and concepts are ported over from 2018&#x27;s God of War into Ragnarok: and that includes the main currency of Hacksilver.
It can be found basically anywhere, and you&#x27;ll acquire a ton during the normal course of the story. Here&#x27;s a few ways to get some extra cash.

Look above and below, and smash everything
Standard NES and beyond retro game rules apply: smash everything. In God of War: Ragnarok, you can randomly earn cash through environmental objects, including ones on the ground and hanging on a chain in the air.
You&#x27;ll also find a lot of Hacksilver in chests. If you find yourself wanting to farm Hacksilver, go to an area you haven&#x27;t been in a while and take a new path to a sidequest. A…</span>

The Games Done Quick (GDQ) team has released a jam-packed schedule for its next speedrunning event, AGDQ 2023 — Once again, the fastest fingers in gaming will be gathering online to lay waste to a wide variety of new, classic, and debuting games, from a variety of genres, and all for a worthwhile cause.
While GDQ had planned to host the AGDQ 2023 extravaganza in a physical capacity, the team decided that Florida does not currently provide a safe enough environment, (from a social or COVID-19-related standpoint), for such a community gathering. As explained on the official GDQ Twitter, the cancellation of the Floridian venue has left the organizer out of pocket, and thus requires the event to now be held in an online capacity.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been a good week for monitor deals, but a lot of what we&#x27;ve looked at has been fairly expensive, from a 42-inch LG OLED for £779 or a 34-inch QD-OLED ultrawide for £943. These are great monitors, don&#x27;t get me wrong, but you could spend a fraction of the money and still get a brilliant monitor.
That brings us neatly to the subject of this deals post: the Dell S3422DWG, a 34-in ultrawide gaming monitor that sits at the comfortable crossroads of refresh rate and resolution: 3440x1440 and 144Hz. Rather than expensive OLED, this monitor comes with a curved VA panel, offering excellent contrast, great colours and good motion handling, while costing significantly less: just £351 when you use code GSGALLMON10 at the checkout, down from £390.

                              <span>LG&#x27;s C2 OLEDs are brilliant gaming displays at any size - and the 42-in and 48-in models are just small enough to fit onto an average to large-sized desk. That technically makes them &quot;cool gaming monitors&quot; and therefore well within my RPS deals duties. Both are now discounted from Crampton &amp; Moore via Ebay, with a 25% off coupon (&quot;FLASH25&quot;) that maxes out at a pretty sweet £150 discount. 
That means you can pick up the 42-in for £779 and the 48-in model for £848, both of which are the best prices we&#x27;ve ever seen for these highly recommended TVs.

Stratton&#x27;s post was written all the way back in May 2020, and Gordon&#x27;s response is a doozy. “Marty lied about the circumstances surrounding the DOOM Eternal Soundtrack and used disinformation and innuendo to blame me entirely for its failure,” Gordon said in the post on Medium. Gordon claims that Stratton later offered a six-figure amount if he never spoke about the matter, but Gordon insists he turned the money down.

                              <span>Boy, American McGee&#x27;s Alice really sticks in the mind of a ten-year-old, doesn&#x27;t it? It resides in the Goldilocks Zone of creepiness: just the right amount of creepy to be considered cool, and not quite creepy enough to cause nightmares. There were quite a few things I loved about the game, but none more than that deliciously haunting opening theme that played in the main menu.

                              <span>More than 11,000 workers at Meta will lose their jobs, the technology company has announced, a figure that includes some staff working in its VR team Reality Labs. The Company Formerly Known As Facebook broke the bad news to employees via a message CEO Mark Zuckerberg shared earlier today. The job losses equate to 13% of Meta’s entire staff. Redundancies will affect staff across Meta’s global offices, including here in the UK.

                              <span>I love tidying up in games, and I’m not just talking about playing Unpacking and House Flipper, either. Any game I play with an inventory gets a regular, satisfying purge. I’m either marching to an in-game shopkeeper and holding my adventuring sack upside down, or just swiftly frisbeeing items straight into the bin. If it’s cluttering my screen, it’s cluttering my mind. Zero regrets. That’s the gamer dopamine hit I’m chasing.
So, as you might have guessed, I love the idea of A Little To The Left, a game that celebrates neatness and tidiness through a string of fun puzzles. If you love the satisfaction of arranging books on your shelf in order of height, or displaying your mugs in order of which can hold the most tea, then you’ll love this game too. Some simple tidying puzzles would have been enough for me, but A Little To The Left takes the idea in interesting directions through smart puzzle design.

Having previewed both Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty and Wild Hearts, I&#x27;ve come to discover that the mark of a great boss is one of these things, none of the rest, and 500 pounds of ham. BIG PIGs are in, and they are here to do a high-pitched squeal and charge to the top of the &quot;Trending Bosses&quot; list.

                              <span>Praise the Sun! FromSoftware have announced that Dark Souls Remastered’s long dormant PvP servers have been reactivated at last. The fantasy action RPG’s multiplayer was scuppered earlier this year when a security vulnerability that could harm anyone playing online was discovered all the way back in January. PC servers for Remastered were taken offline until a fix could be found, along with every other Dark Souls game.

They’re also touting more frequent updates to an FPS game that’s been relatively Spartan in terms of content, so far. Another game update is planned for later in 2022, which means Halo Infinite players can almost certainly expect something in December.

Valve are currently testing new expanded modding features in TF2, letting modders play with the VScript feature supported by games including Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and Left 4 Dead 2. While it&#x27;s not yet clear what will happen, a proof-of-concept video mashing in wallrunning, swish grappling hooks, and pilotable mechs suggests great potential. Come watch!

The intention to conduct an in-depth investigation was announced in a statement on the European Commission’s website, and will focus on how the deal will affect console and PC games, along with PC operating systems. This means that both the EU and UK are now holding further investigations into the potential buyout of Activision Blizzard due to concerns that Microsoft’s acquisition of the company could reduce competition within the games industry.

                              <span>Earlier this year, EA Sports and FIFA ended a partnership that had lasted for 30 years, mostly because the irredeemably corrupt sports governing body had started making all kinds of wild demands for the rights to their name. EA walked away, and FIFA tried to pretend everything was going to be just fine. It is clearly…

                              <span>An interview with developers Max Inferno.
It&#x27;s not often we get to do in-person interviews these days. It&#x27;s even less frequent that we get to travel to a game studio to do them. But this might be a first, because for this interview, we actually got to go to a developer&#x27;s house.
It turns out that Max Inferno, the two-person studio making upcoming Switch game A Little to the Left, is based in Halifax, Nova Scotia — just around the corner from our Staff Writer, Kate. We couldn&#x27;t pass up the opportunity to bag a world-exclusive chat with Lukas and Annie, the two developers of this charming tidying-up puzzle game, and we&#x27;re glad we did, because we think the game is exactly what many of us need right now: Something quiet, contemplative, and a little bit magical. Also, it&#x27;s out right now, as announced in the November 9th Indie World Showcase! What a neat bit of synergy.

The next few months just got a whole lot more exciting, thanks to Nintendo&#x27;s November Indie World Showcase, which was (as usual) packed with exciting reveals and announcements.
A whopping 22 games in total were shown off in the latest presentation, and the general consensus is pretty good; overall, a fantastic showing for Nintendo. But if you missed it, or you can&#x27;t remember quite what happened, no worries — we&#x27;re here to catch you up.

                              <span>Hello Goodbye.
The Indie World Showcase threw a lot of stellar looking titles our way, and one that really stood out to us was GOODBYE WORLD, which launches on Switch later this month.
ISOLATION STUDIO and PM Studios, Inc. have managed to put together a game which looks to tick a lot of boxes for us. It&#x27;s got friendship, it&#x27;s got classic pixel art aesthetics, it&#x27;s got nods to the grind of game development. Combine all that with the fact that the in-game development is taking place for a suspiciously Game Boy-looking device which you can play (at this point, we&#x27;ll take a GB emulator on Switch any way we can), and you can consider us sufficiently intrigued.

Trust Devolver Digital to deliver something pretty unusual — and fun-looking. One of the surprise announcements from today&#x27;s Indie World Showcase was Pepper Grinder, a fantastic-looking pixel art sidescroller from developer Ahr Ech. And our little Game Boy Advance hearts were beating when we saw just how Pepper, the shipwrecked, swash-buckling pirate got around these levels — with a drill!
Yes! Our hearts were racing as we watched Pepper zip and zoom around with her trusty power tool. This is the high-speed sequel to Drill Dozer we&#x27;ve always wanted, and now we&#x27;re getting it in 2023! She&#x27;s even named her drill — Grinder.

The psychological horror-inflected roguelike deckbuilder appeared in the showcase&#x27;s sizzle reel, but that trailer was enough to get us sufficiently spooked/excited (spookcited?)

Rogue Legacy 2 is finally coming to Switch. And, like any good roguelite, it&#x27;s randomly generating onto Switch... today! Surprise! And the Switch release comes packaged with the Fabled Heroes update, meaning this release has everything you need to start building your legacy.
This genealogical adventure brings more randomised runs, character changes, and skills than you can shake a sword (or a bow and arrow, or a spear, etc.) at. This sequel to the fantastic original — which we loved on Switch — just expands on the already outstanding formula of the first game, which still stands as one of the best examples of the genre to date.

Ken Masters, one of the two original playable Street Fighter characters, steps back into the spotlight with an all-new backstory. As soon as his new look was unveiled, the Street Fighter community had a field day pondering what happened to put Ken in the rough state he appeared, with memes popping up deeming him &quot;Hobo Ken.&quot; While at Capcom&#x27;s headquarters in Osaka, Japan, we spoke with Street Fighter 6 director Takayuki Nakayama and art director Kaname Fujioka to get more details abou…</span>

                              <span>Eric Williams has been working on God of War since the first game, and his credits extend beyond Kratos&#x27; journey to titles like Darksiders and Insomniac&#x27;s Spider-Man, but he will always consider Sony Santa Monica home. For God of War Ragnarök, Williams put a pause on his video game consulting business to take on the director role for the highly anticipated sequel. We spoke with Williams about why God of War 2018&#x27;s director, Cory Barlog, had to convince him to take on the role, why nearly every God of War game has a new director, how he discovered he is not able to generate visuals in his mind&#x27;s eye, how the surprising casting of Richard Schiff as Odin came about, and plenty more.

Now EA have announced internally that they won&#x27;t be making any more Project Cars games, and that they will move staff working on the series into &quot;suitable&quot; roles &quot;wherever [they] can.&quot;

                              <span>Dell&#x27;s Alienware AW3423DW is my favourite ultrawide monitor, thanks to its beautiful 34-inch QD-OLED screen that offers perfect blacks, near-instant pixel response times and gorgeous colours. With wide-screen 1440p (3440x1440) resolution and a 175Hz refresh rate, it&#x27;s both detailed and responsive, and it looks the part too with a very cool space-y design. 
I was lucky enough to review one for several months for Digital Foundry - I think Dell forgot about it for a while - so I consider it my duty to inform you that it is now on sale for the first time ever, dropping from £1099 to £943 - still a big chunk of change, but a fitting Black Friday price for one of the best monitors on the market of any description, hands down.

                              <span>If your favourite PC games are competitive shooters, then a high refresh rate monitor is an essential upgrade in my eyes - the reduced input lag and improved visual clarity makes a huge difference in games like Counter-Strike, Valorant, Fortnite and Call of Duty. 144Hz and 165Hz monitors used to be the norm, but now even faster monitors are becoming quite affordable - including this 280Hz Acer monitor that&#x27;s dropped to £180 at Laptops Direct, down from an original price of £275.

                              <span>Rhythm games lose something when they don’t come bundled with a peripheral, I think. There’s something about a physical controller, custom built to emulate the action the game revolves around, that lends games a level of credibility you lose the second you try and play it with a regular pad. Playing Guitar Hero with an Xbox 360 controller feels like trying to paint a bedroom wall using a spoon. You’ll get there eventually, but if anyone spots you through a window they’ll rightly assume you’re some kind of deviant.

Notable standouts this time around are PowerWash Simulator, which might well be my personal GOTY contender, and a bonus appearance from cutesy cyberpunk cat sim Stray. There’s also a Google Stadia run of nautical indie action-adventure Wavetale, just a week before the streaming platform closes for good.

                              <span>The other week I played a short demo for the upcoming Resident Evil 4 remake. You’d think being lucky enough to actually play the damn thing would have numbed my hyper-fixation about it a touch, but, nope. I’m afraid not. It turns out the guy who owns eight physical copies (and four digital) of the original Resident Evil 4 is still pretty excited to play the remake. Who ever could have predicted this?


The day my preview went live, Capcom showed off a couple of additional bits as part of a hefty Resident Evil showcase. Alongside a fresh story trailer the company also discussed the various gubbins you’ll receive if you fork out for the game&#x27;s special edition as well as a short gameplay demonstration. Surprising no one, I’ve watched these clips so many times I now have a load of thoughts that are not only completely useless but are taking up vital brain space I usually reserve for things like pin numbers and dates. If I don’t vent all of this garbage out of my skull there’s a chance I’ll forget my Mam’s birthday again, something that genuinely happened once when I was 17 and I haven’t stopped feeling guilty about it since. I bought her a plant from a Tesco Express three days later thinking that would help. It didn’t. This event haunts me more than any Resident Evil jumpscare ever could.

                              <span>Blacktail is a complicated, first-person adventure when you play a lil witch. Well, a witch in training, sort of. A witcheen. Baba Yaga has been forced to live in the forest having been accused of witchcraft, so it seems like one of those self-fulfilling prophecy deals.
It&#x27;s a very brightly coloured, fantastical world, this forest you live in, and you&#x27;re dropped in media res. I thought that hands-on preview I got would be quite a casual gadabout talking to a cute dragon and what have you, but in fact it was difficult, and weird, and very opaque in the best way. The res in question included treasure chests with teeth and talking pine-cone spirits, and exploding fireflies. But you&#x27;re an archer, too, and I really, really hate using arrows in first-person, and I don&#x27;t think that will change.

                              <span>World-straddling behemoth of a guessing game Wordle has welcomed its own overlord this week in the form of an editor. The New York Times have announced that Tracy Bennett is now in charge of curating the word list for the puzzle game, which was acquired by the newspaper back in January. Wordle will be programmed and tested just like the NYT’s Spelling Bee and Crossword.

The Coalition’s Gears Of War series of beefy blastermen fending off equally beefy aliens is coming to the red streaming service at some indefinite point in the future, it’s been revealed. Netflix say they’re working together with The Coalition on producing both the movie and animation.

                              <span>Activision have not-so-clarified that next year’s annual Call Of Duty release will be a “full premium” one. The shotgun blast of marketing speak erupted from the company’s third quarter earnings results for the year, setting off car alarms, shattering glass, and triggering journalists’ Google Alerts. You can interpret “full premium release” to mean an actual game that costs $70, or an expansion packaged and sold during the ritually observed Call Of Duty release window. I choose to sit on the fence for the next 12 months, carefully raising one eyebrow so I don’t topple over.

                              <span>How To Say Goodbye starts with someone dying. It’s not shocking or distressing; quite the opposite. The person died in a hospital bed surrounded by their closest friends and family, and after they&#x27;ve passed on the group begins to share stories and memories from when they were alive. Death isn’t always this calm and it isn’t always this peaceful, but on rare occasions it can be. 
This is how developers Florian Veltman and Baptiste Portefaix have approached death in How To Say Goodbye, a cosy game that explores the topic with kindness and sensitivity. With its paper doll illustrations and pastel colour palette, it kinda feels like a children&#x27;s pop-up book that teaches kids about grief. It’s not overly sweet or patronising, just a gentle game about a group of ghosts who discover how to mourn, how to accept their own death, and how to move on.

You probably also noticed that BioWare shared some concept art of an in-construction mass relay from the next Mass Effect game, along with a snippet of jumbled audio for people to download. Enterprising Shepard stans set to work cleaning up the noise to see if anything meaningful was held within and, lo and behold, there was a short message from everyone’s favourite asari scientist Liara T’Soni.

                              <span>After a lengthy Street Fighter 6 hands-on session and a few interviews at Capcom&#x27;s headquarters in Osaka, Japan, I am in the back room of a small sandwich shop overlooking the Higashiyokobori River. As I eat my sandwich, I make conversation with Street Fighter 6 director Takayuki Nakayama, who is seated next to me, enjoying his own sandwich. After touching on topics of our respective histories with Street Fighter and other games we&#x27;ve been playing, he asks if I&#x27;ve enjoyed what I&#x27;ve played of Street Fighter 6 to this point.
I let him know the gameplay and art style are terrific and that I feel the Real-Time Commentary feature is a revolutionary addition to the fighting genre. The director nods along with a smile until I mention how I don&#x27;t feel the Modern Controls (which simplify the overal…</span>

That&#x27;s right: Our next issue proudly features Street Fighter 6 on the cover. The cover art, created by designer Goro Tokuda, features one of the original World Warriors, Ken, sporting his new look. Everyone (Capcom included) has seen your memes about Ken&#x27;s rougher appearance in this game, but we traveled to the studio in Osaka, Japan, to learn more about what&#x27;s happening with one of the franchise&#x27;s most iconic characters.
While there, we went hands-on with the game, had extensive conversations with the developers, chatted about the lessons the team took from Street Fighter V&#x27;s disappointing launch, and even learned about a new way to play Street Fig…</span>

This new look at Pokémon Scarlet and Violet was mostly focused on Ed Sheeran’s new Pokémon single “Celestial,” but it also included a few Big Nuggets of information we learned for the first time. The most significant reveal is a glimpse at two new creatures, called Great Tusk and Iron Treads. At first glance, they look a lot like Donphan (a Pokémon that has been confirmed for the new games), but it’s unclear how they’re related. They could be new regional forms, evolutions, or something entirely new.
The trailer also showed a sneak peek at the Scarlet Book and Violet Book, two tomes detailed further on Pokémon’s official website. They’re records from an old expedition and have notes and drawings of old Pokémon, including the new Donphan-esque creatures reve…</span>

                              <span>Sonic Frontiers is available now, marking a new era for the iconic Sonic the Hedgehog franchise. While much of the 3D action remains intact through Sonic Frontiers, the arena in which much of that action takes place is a massive departure. The open-zone setup gives players large areas in which to run, fight, and explore, but the game also presents players with linear Cyber Space stages that veer much closer to the action levels players are used to. With so much to do in Sonic Frontiers (I spent more than 30 hours clearing as much as I could off the map), I wanted to give players some tips to help them squeeze the most fun out of the Blue Blur&#x27;s enjoyment.

                              <span>Ebay&#x27;s TAKEIT10 code offers a 10% discount on a wide range of PC components and peripherals, but I was tickled by this deal on an Integral 480GB SSD, which brings this sizeable drive down to just £24. 
That&#x27;s a solid £5 below the price of the same drive on Amazon, and well into bargain buy territory for anyone that wants to cheaply and easily add more storage to their desktop or laptop. If you have any old laptops that are still running on hard drives, for example, then this could be an awesome low-cost upgrade!

This little gadget has a simple premise: fifteen customisable keys, each with a little LCD screen behind it, that can be bound to accomplish a wide range of things from scene switching in OBS and monitoring your computer&#x27;s vitals to launching programs or muting your microphone. Normally the Stream Deck costs £150, but today it&#x27;s down to £90 at Amazon UK.

                              <span>Compared to many of the latest FPS offerings out there, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a fossil. It&#x27;s such a simplistic looking game, right? A bit bland and archaic, lacking that colour and pop that the likes of Apex Legends and Valorant possess. But to pass it off as dull and basic is to do the game a disservice, as it&#x27;s more refined than basically any of its competitors.

                              <span>I, like many people I know these days, will only watch a YouTube video if it&#x27;s either less than 5 minutes or more than an hour long. YouTube evolved a while ago into a platform for long-form video essays, and I for one am happy about it. Even better: Jenny Nicholson just released an almost four hour video on an uncompleted attraction in Utah called Evermore. Evermore is a sort of theme park-slash-immersive-theatre that appears to have been beset both by uncontrollable world events and bad management, but I still want to go because it looks pretty fun(ny). 
I did think about what games I would like to become immersive experience theme parks in this kind of vein, though, and I gotta say... I&#x27;m coming up empty.

                              <span>Fantasy roguelike Dead Cells is being invaded by indies again. Weapons and outfits from six games are making their way into the game with today&#x27;s free Everone Is Here 2 update: Terraria, Hotline Miami, Shovel Knight, Slay The Spire, Risk Of Rain 2, and Katana Zero. There’s also new lore rooms based on locations from these games, which is where you’ll find the weapons stored. You can watch some of the costumes and weapons in action in the trailer below.

                              <span>Ever fancied becoming the bad guy? Well, a new Stranger Things VR game that mixes psychological horror with action is coming from creative studio Tender Claws in 2023, and it casts you as telekinetic monstrosity Vecna. The game’s been commissioned by Netflix, with the series writers involved in creating it. I’m not sure exactly how involved they are, but the trailer is suitably Stranger Things enough that it’s not that big a deal if they just looked at it and went “Yes, fine.” You can watch it for yourself below.

                              <span>Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2&#x27;s multiplayer - not including Warzone 2.0 - brings out the best of COD&#x27;s excellent gunplay on an array of colourful maps that largely deliver. And it tones down the pace of movement too, making for a measured experience that certainly rewards speed, but doesn&#x27;t make it an athletics competition.
And while the game&#x27;s multiplayer is a slick refinement of what&#x27;s come before, its gun unlock process is messy and excessive, even if it offers plenty of options for all types of player. Oh, and make sure you&#x27;ve got the game installed on an SSD...

I’ve only been keeping track in a very general sense but it does feel like non-sale prices, especially on mechanical keyboards, have been creeping upwards. If you are in the market, you could thefore find, say, a list of the best early Black Friday gaming keyboard deals very useful indeed. Hey, here&#x27;s one.

That’s why I’m intrigued by Chop Goblins, a “microshooter” from Dusk and Gloomwood developer David Szymanski that’s coming to Steam on January 2nd, 2023. Szymanski says Chop Goblins’ campaign can be finished within a single sitting of around 30 minutes. Appropriately enough, it’s all about time travel.

                              <span>There’s a war going on between instalments in the Battlefield series, and it looks like Battlefield 1 is coming out on top for now. The World War One FPS has been spotted nestled in Steam’s top ten best-selling games rankings (thanks, Emopulse), although it&#x27;s since slipped out again. Battlefield 1’s also set a record over the weekend for its all-time highest concurrent player numbers, reaching more than 50,000 players in the past 24 hours. I say, tip top.

                              <span>Fresh hell could arrive in April 2023 in the form of a Diablo 4 launch, if new rumours are accurate. Windows Central and the XboxEra podcast both say they’ve heard the release window from sources. That’s not all, as details of the fantasy action RPG’s release could be announced on December 8th at The Game Awards, according to both sets of sources. These include pre-orders opening during the show, and a February 2023 open beta.

                              <span>It’s nearly the end of the year, a time when many a person&#x27;s thoughts turn to the birth of Jesus Christ (along with whether or not they’re getting FIFA 23 on Christmas morning). Forget about other games for the moment though, because one developer’s bringing The Bible itself to Steam. The appropriately named Bible Games are releasing a fully voiced version of the good book on November 14th, complete with trivia quizzes to check your biblical knowledge. You can watch the surprisingly dramatic trailer below.

                              <span>Scorn is an abstract game that is difficult to decipher. Even after seeing credits, players are left in an uncomfortable but memorable state of mind that defies clear explanation. To try and develop some context, we spoke with the game&#x27;s director, Ebb Software&#x27;s Ljubomir Peklar, via e-mail to try and get some more insight into the bizarre experience. Unsurprisingly, much is meant to be left to the players&#x27; imagination, but Peklar did offer some details, like how it managed to create something so abstract, some of the incidental imagery that occurred, and the best movie from the Aliens franchise.

The streaming giant revealed the news in a tweet that&#x27;s light on details but states it&#x27;s partnering with Gears developer The Coalition. Based on the tweet&#x27;s wording, it sounds like the animated show will come after the movie&#x27;s release. It may not stop there, as Netflix also says there&#x27;s “potential for more stories to follow!”

The last NFL Blitz was released on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade in January 2012. Even then, it was considered a retro revival title developed by Madden studio EA Tiburon. Before that, we hadn&#x27;t received a proper NFL-licensed Blitz title since Midway&#x27;s NFL Blitz 20-03 on PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube, and Game Boy Advance. Despite EA Sports acquiring the license from Midway during its 2009 liquidation, the NFL has largely seemed averse to the hard-hitting arcade-style gameplay of the Blitz series.
In August, Arcade1Up, the company behind various arcade replicas, including other Midway classics like NBA Jam and Mortal Kombat, announced the franchise&#x27;s return through NFL Blitz Le…</span>

In Sonic Frontiers, Sega finds the intersection of the series’ linear past and its “open-zone” future, paying capable service to both eras of the franchise. The open Starfall Islands offer engaging exploration, while linear Cyber Space stages deliver the familiar speed-based Sonic experience. Though each side of the coin has faults, Frontiers is an overall positive experience that serves as a boost in the right direction for the franchise.
Running through the open zones is often a joyful experience. …</span>

                              <span>Russia&#x27;s premium broadcasters use conditional access systems to restrict viewing to paying customers and prevent piracy. These systems are reportedly very good but that&#x27;s making Russia nervous. Western anti-piracy companies dominate the market and at least in theory, could black out TV sets all over the country. A second scenario has Russia equally worried - free premium TV for all.

                              <span>The original Dungeons &amp; Dragons RPG grew out of a connection to miniature wargames, so it’s little surprise that the DNA of tactical tabletop play has remained bound to the long-running franchise ever since. The current edition of D&amp;D supports tremendous flexibility in playing out combat how you like, including through tabletop miniature play, allowing big battles to flow out from ongoing campaign storylines in your weekly sessions. However, perhaps your group is more into combat than interconnected storylines. Or, more likely, you sometimes just want a break from the campaign planning to have a focused evening of combat. If that’s the case, WizKids’ new Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Onslaught game should be on your radar.

                              <span>Standing here, I realize that this Super Replay will be a cut above the rest because we’ll be slicing and dicing in Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance! Join us today on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central to enjoy two hours of what will be a full playthrough of the cult favorite action game streaming weekly each Friday. You can also catch up on previous episodes by visiting our new Game Informer Shows YouTube channel or watching the latest episode embedded below. 
Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance serves as a sequel/spin-off to Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots that puts cyborg ninja Raiden at the helm. Instead of sneaking around in boxes, players eviscerate foes in fast-paced, stylish action courtesy of developer Platinum Games. Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look. Will I acquire a new appreciation for the game nine years later? How many watermelons will I slice? You’ll have to tune in to find out. 


Join me, Marcus Stewart, and Blake Hester as we revisit Raiden’s beloved solo adventure.

                              <span>God of War Ragnarok is out next week and ahead of the game&#x27;s release, developer Santa Monica Studio has revealed more than 70 accessibility features in the game. 
PlayStation has been pushing the importance of accessibility in gaming more and more with each new release and Ragnarok is no different. The studio has been quite open with its accessibility desires, detailing more than 60 in a blog post earlier this year. Now, with the game out on November 9, the studio has released an even more detailed post breaking down exactly what to expect. 


Santa Monica Studio says there are more than 70 features in Ragnarok that &quot;enable players to customize the gameplay experience to suit their needs&quot; and the list is a sight to behold. It includes plenty of presets, too, which could make it easier for players to easily get the game started in a way that makes the experience better for them. Presets include one for vision accessibility, hearing accessibility, motion reduction, apply motor accessibility, and a changed setting indicator as well. 
There are alternative control schemes, remappable buttons, hold and press options, in-game assistance settings, and so much more. If you&#x27;re interested in what accessibility features are in Ragnarok, be sure to check out the full blog post.

                              <span>The composer for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II, Sarah Schachner, has revealed that she has parted ways with the game and the free-to-play battle royale Call of Duty: Warzone (and likely the upcoming Warzone 2). As for why, she says the working dynamic with the game&#x27;s audio director has become difficult and she sees no path forward. Variety reports that the audio director in question is Stephen Miller but Schachner doesn&#x27;t name this person in her announcement. 
News of her departure comes from a statement released by Schachner on Twitter on November 3, as reported by Video Games Chronicle. Schachner&#x27;s departure comes after years of work with Modern Warfare II studio Infinity Ward on games like 2019&#x27;s Call of Duty: Modern Warfare and 2016&#x27;s Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare. Other credits include Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla and Anthem, as noted by VGC. 
&quot;I am sad to say I can no longer continue to compose music for MWII/Warzone,&quot; her statement reads. &quot;Over the past couple of months, the working dynamic with the audio director has become increasingly challenging and I don&#x27;t see any path forward. As of now, I am unsure of the status and release plan for the soundtrack as it&#x27;s been taken out of my hands. While I don&#x27;t have any control over how the music is presented in-game, what will be released on the soundtrack is not my artistic intent in regards to mixing and mastering.&quot; 
She then thanks fans for their support and gives some shout outs to others involved with the game&#x27;s score, including mixer Frank Wolf, &quot;creative vision&quot; Mike Dean, and performing artists including Baseck, Brain Mantia, and M.B. Gordy.

                              <span>I can&#x27;t remember now if it was Monster Prom or Dream Daddy that introduced me to the dating sim genre, but Monster Prom was definitely my first dating sim hybrid, a sub-genre I&#x27;m now more than a bit obsessed with. Other favourite examples of mine include last year&#x27;s Boyfriend Dungeon (a dating sim and dungeon crawler), Max Gentlemen: Sexy Business (a dating and business sim), and HuniePop (a dating sim and match-3 puzzle game). Monster Prom is a dating sim and competitive multiplayer party game, where up to four players vie to romance attractive monsters and invite them to the school dance.

RimWorld is the more direct influence, really. Instead of a planet&#x27;s surface, your little blobby torso people are stuck on a spaceship, which you need to rebuild around them using a fleet of robots as they gradually wake up from stasis. If you know the genre well, it will be reminiscent of several games, but its balance of survival, management, and creative building makes for a refreshingly forgiving experience at the current default settings.

Handily, it’s made me realise that Paul Kaye – known for his Game Of Thrones role as resurrectionist Thoros of Myr, and for being mortally annoying as Dennis Pennis in the Nineties – is playing shock doc director Charlie. Kaye’s nonchalant accent seems like a great fit, as you’ll see in the trailer below.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been an interesting exercise playing Triangle Strategy and Tactics Ogre: Reborn in quick succession lately. I&#x27;ve now played both Square Enix strategy RPGs for around six hours apiece now - starting with Tactics Ogre for my preview the other week, and following it up with a Triangle-shaped chaser. I didn&#x27;t have any history with either game before now, but it&#x27;s become increasingly apparent that they&#x27;re effectively cut from the same tile-based cloth. And I mean, exactly the same. They&#x27;re so similar, in fact, that it&#x27;s kinda hilarious Square are releasing them so close together on PC, with Tactics Ogre&#x27;s release on November 11th following little more than a month after Triangle Strategy. 
At the same time, though, their approach to story-telling couldn&#x27;t be more different, and comparing and contrasting them like this one after the other has been both fun and enlightening. Triangle Strategy, for example, is about 80% cutscene, 20% fighting for its first six hours, while Tactics Ogre is pretty much the opposite. And yet… I think I sort of prefer Triangle Strategy? Let me explain.

                              <span>When Team Ninja&#x27;s Soulslike action-RPG Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty was announced not long ago, I thought: &quot;Wow, that looks like my sort of jam&quot;. A PS5 demo came out and I only got to spend all of five minutes with it before life got in the way. I never got to truly taste the jam, which was quite sad. So, colour me very excited when I got to spend a good couple of hours battling through two short hands-on demos. I got battered by a big pig, prickled to death by a massive porcupine, and aggressively mauled by a large tiger. And I&#x27;d say I had a whale of a time. There was no killer whale in the demo, but I wouldn&#x27;t count it out for the full release.

They’re due to air tonight, November 4th, in the US, and in the early hours of tomorrow morning for people on the other side of the Atlantic. That leaves enough time to place your bets on who it’ll turn out to be.

                              <span>We finally have AMD’s answer to the Nvida RTX 40 series: the Radeon RX 7900 XT and Radeon RX 7900 XTX, the red team’s first graphics cards build on the RDNA 3 architecture. These are both high-end GPUs, set to cost $899 and $999 respectively when they release on December 13th, but you’ll note those prices are oodles cheaper than the £1269 / $1199 RTX 4080 and the £1679 / $1599 RTX 4090.
They’re also structurally distinct from the current Radeon RX 6000 cards to an extent that, frankly, is quite surprising to see from AMD GPUs. RDNA 3 uses a Ryzen CPU-inspired chiplet design, where the GPU is split up into different sections, and the new media engine is engineered for the 4K gaming monitors of the future as much as it is for current PC hardware.

                              <span>Vampire Survivors is morish. Pulsating lights stretch in a vertical column from the top to the bottom of my screen, scattering into deadly particles like notes played on an accordion of cosmic destruction. Fireworks burst in every corner, thanks to the evolved version of my diamond-spewing runetracer weapon that’s now called ‘NO FUTURE’. Monsters go pop by their thousands. Flaming meteors still abound.
Vampire Survivors is an arcade-style survivathon about weaving through fields of enemies as your weapons automatically obliterate the oncoming hordes. It’s still about collecting upgrades until you’re the locus of an unstoppable death machine, and now that it’s left early access that death machine comes in more colours and more flavours. There are new maps to conquer, new characters to conquer with, and new secrets to uncover. If you haven’t played since the early access launch then yes, it’s worth checking out the new stuff. If you haven’t played at all, then God yes, please check out all the stuff. Or like, most of it.
Vampire Survivors is still morish. Up to a point.

Because, while the majority of the original simulator remains in tact, the computer powering everything was too old to find replacement parts for, so a Raspberry Pi […]

In France, however, movie fans still have to wait more than a year before they can stream the latest blockbusters. The MPA flags this mandatory release window as a potential trade barrier, with the potential make piracy even worse.

                              <span>Ubisoft has rolled out its post-launch content roadmap for Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope. Owners of the game’s season pass, whether purchased separately for $29.99 or bundled in the game’s $89.99 Gold Edition, have three big adventures aimed at keeping them glued to the game throughout 2023. 
It all kicks off early next year with the first expansion, Tower of Doooom (their spelling, not mine). This introduces a new combat mode where the team must fight their way up Madame Bwahstrella’s multi-story tower to rescue Spawny, the visor-rocking Rabbid from Kingdom Battle. What’s important to note is that Tower of Doooom will be exclusive to the season pass, meaning you’ll be unable to purchase it separately. 
The second untitled DLC arrives in mid-2023. So far, we only know it takes players to a new planet, features never-before-seen enemies, allies, and secrets, and stars a new antagonist. Finally, Rayman crashes the party in the final expansion to close out the year. Ubisoft’s limbless hero joins Rabbid Peach and Rabbid Mario on a separate adventure in a new location. Unlike Tower of Doooom, the second and third expansions can be purchased a la carte. 
I enjoyed Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope quite a bit, awarding it a 9 out of 10. In my review, which you can read here, I wrote that the game “builds upon Kingdom Battle’s foundation with smart tweaks and fun additions to emerge as a better game in every way.”</span>

                              <span>Hideo Kojima has finally addressed the conspiracy theories revolving around him and Blue Box Game Studios&#x27; Abandoned and in short, it&#x27;s a nuisance for him, unsurprisingly. 
Abandoned was announced with a short teaser back in 2021 as a game being developed for PlayStation 5 and PC. Not long after the reveal, speculation that Abandoned was actually a Silent Hill game secretly in development began to ramp up, but studio head Hasan Kahraman took to Twitter to shut down those rumors.
From there, the speculation train arrived at the idea that famed Metal Gear Solid developer Kojima was attached to the game. Some believed that Kojima actually was Kahraman on the basis that both their first names start with &quot;H&quot; and both their last names start with &quot;K.&quot; Plus, people thought Blue Box was meant to ti…</span>

To call the 2018 God of War a sequel almost does it a disservice. Yes, it was a continuation of Kratos’ original multi-game journey, but it placed him and a new family in a foreign world to reflect on his past and try to secure his future. Kratos’ journey to connect to his son while battling a new legion of distrustful gods was a revelation in both video game storytelling and action, setting a high bar for the inevitable sequel. Ragnarök may lack the unique impact of the prior game, but everything that worked so well the…</span>

Without spoiling the ending of Village, the story left off in a way that created some big, interesting questions about the future of Resident Evil. From its beginning, the series has never claimed a singular protagonist, but moving forward, it seemed Ethan’s daughter Rose was going to be an important character to the franchise and whatever narrative direction a potential Resident Evil IX might follow. The Shadows of Rose DLC offers the first chance to play as Rose while filling in a small story gap that arguably did not need filling. Even with a somewhat benign…</span>

As you can see, there&#x27;s a lot going on in terms of graphics modes for this game, and that&#x27;s great – the more options, the better! Regardless of where you play or how you play, it sounds like you&#x27;re in for a good time based on the first five hours of the game. You can read what we thought about those first hours in our God of War Ragnarök spoiler-free impressions here.

                              <span>Rainy Season is a game that speaks to that universal feeling of having your plans scuppered by inclement weather. We&#x27;ve all been there at some point in our lives, painstakingly planning a grand day out only for it to absolutely tip it down on the day in question - and for the boy in Inasa Fujio&#x27;s hour-long narrative game, it&#x27;s a trip to the local theme park during his summer holidays that gets rained off. 
Unfortunately, his mum (sensibly) decides against taking him and his brother out in the oncoming storm, so now he&#x27;s got to face a day stuck inside his grandma&#x27;s house instead. FUN. Turns out, though, that there are still plenty of memories to be made in this small, cluttered space. All you need is a little imagination.

Flailing wildly at enemies with a big sword, axe, or warhammer, jostling them about with your implement of doom like armour-clad sausages frying in a pan, never seems to get old. What if you could do that while being more ethically sound, in a non-lethal way? Hold onto your butts because vanilla Skyrim modder drumfire has come up with the solution. It’s a mace that’s, well, Mace.

We talk about the characters that we relate to most, and also I find a way to mention Saturnalia again. Tune in next week to see if I can keep up my streak!
Matthew being away this week means that Nate takes on the role of the anti-Matthew, and we speculate about which games we think Matthew would probably find relatable. For myself and Nate the themes include sadness and drudgery. But there&#x27;s good news, because Nate has remembered to make me a Cavern Of Lies this week! Hooray!

                              <span>Gaming mice love a Black Friday sale, they do. Every November there’s a glut of discounted peripherals, and not just the sad plastic lumps that retailers won’t be able to sell otherwise – we’re talking real quality desk rats. This guide to the best early Black Friday gaming mouse deals confirms as much, as even with the big day itself not until the 25th, loads of new and old favourites are available with substantial savings.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been playing an awful lot of Overwatch 2 recently. As you&#x27;ll know if you&#x27;ve played either of Blizzard&#x27;s near-identical hero shooters, Overwatch 2 lets you queue up for a match as a particular hero role, which ensures balanced team compositions but also can mean a wait of several minutes before you get into a match. Cue me scouring my Steam Library a few days ago for a quick little time-waster to fill those gaps. And after a few failed attempts, I discovered it. Or, more accurately, rediscovered it.

                              <span>I don’t know about you, but I’m not very good at reading Ye Olde Ynglishe. The letters are all curly, and my vision’s already a bit rubbish to begin with. Like a lot of specialised fonts, I find calligraphy awkward to read at best and virtually illegible at worst. That’s why I always appreciate when games make an effort to make text as accessible as possible. Case in point: Obsidian’s upcoming medieval mystery, Pentiment, which has an option to swtich to easy to read fonts baked in. Verily, thou hast mine thanks.

                              <span>If our glowing Signalis review has you hungry for more retro-styled survival horror, do also check out the new demo for Heartworm. Inspired by classics like Resident Evil and Silent Hill, Heartworm is neat even before you learn it&#x27;s almost entirely made by one person. It offers good times exploring a spooky house, bad times possibly trapped inside a neighbourhood in a VHS tape, and a very cosy time hanging out in the safe room. It is a lovely safe room.

                              <span>Only last week I was praising games that wanna be weird, and as such I must commend the weirdness of The Chant, a third-person action adventure where a retreat akin to Jared Leto&#x27;s definitely-not-a-cult finds itself crashing into a weird nightmare realm akin to the Upside Down from Stranger Things. The thing is, if anything I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s weird enough. If you&#x27;re going to do a game where the main character uses flaming witchhazel sticks to lash energy-crystal monsters with vagina-flower faces, my view is that you go hard or go home.

Now though, a new trailer gives a proper glimpse of what Holmes and Watson will be getting up to when they take on H.P. Lovecraft’s Cthulhu Mythos, once again for the very first time. Have a watch below, and try not to get lost in an ethereal netherworld inhabited by malevolent, sleeping gods.

It’s not exactly a replacement for the Google Stadia streaming service that’s shutting down in January, but if you play a lot of Android games on your phone, tablet, or Chromebook then at least it’s an option.

IO Interactive shared their roadmap for what’s ahead this month in Hitman 3, with a new escalation contract that takes its inspiration from one of my kids’ favourite stories, the Three Little Pigs. You can catch up on what’s in store for Ian this month by watching the video below.

                              <span>If you’ve finished Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2’s campaign and feel eager to work your way up the echelons of multiplayer then you’ll have to wait until 2023. That’s when Call Of Duty: Black Ops developers Treyarch will be delivering the military shooter’s ranked play, although there’s no more intel on when exactly we’ll be able to dolphin-dive in. The window for ranked play’s arrival was tweeted by Treyarch alongside some more things to expect from Modern Warfare 2’s multiplayer, such as competitive modes, a Top 250 leaderboard, and visible skill ratings.

                              <span>Ghost Song is a 2D Metroid-like that&#x27;s always a feast for the eyes, but a frequent frustration for your head and hands. Its gorgeous art direction depicts a vibrant alien world that bubbles and throbs with bio-mechanical life, where spore clouds and fleshy organic tunnels live side by side with floating metal skulls and impenetrable thickets of wires and cables. It&#x27;s a fascinating place that seems to morph and change with every passing map segment, calling to mind the animated techno gunge of Akira and Metropolis one minute, and the flowering brilliance of Alex Garland&#x27;s Annihilation the next. Its roots sink deep, creating a world you&#x27;ll want to explore every last nook and cranny of as you delve deeper into its underbelly to find out why you&#x27;re here.
But Deadsuit, your android-like protagonist, makes for a slightly rusty-feeling companion at times, lacking the grace and elegance of Nintendo&#x27;s Samus Aran, and the nimble dexterity of Team Cherry&#x27;s nameless knight. It will tide you over until Silksong arrives, for sure, but it also never quite sings in the way you&#x27;d hope.

                              <span>When it comes to DDR4 RAM, the market has decided that 3200MT/s CL16 is the perfect spec: noticeably faster than early DDR4-2133, 2400 and 2666, while being significantly cheaper than higher-end 3400, 3600 and 4000 kits. Normally you&#x27;d expect to pay around £60 for a 16GB dual-channel kit of DDR4 RAM hitting this spec, but today you can get a Kingston Fury Beast 16GB kit for just £48.64 at CCL in the UK.

After more than a year of uncertainty, two people named in the complaint have now agreed to settle with the videogame companies for $300,000. The fates of two others remain uncertain.

November 2, 2022
Original story: The Last of Us TV series will premiere in a little over two months if HBO&#x27;s page for the show is any indication. 
HBO Max subscribers began to notice that on the page for The Last of Us series on HBO, a description of the show says it premieres on January 15, as reported by Eurogamer. The publication reports that only U.S. subscribers are seeing this January 15 premiere date in the show&#x27;s description so I opened up the HBO Max app on my phone to check and sure enough, it&#x27;s there.

I don’t envy the developers of puzzle games. They have to create puzzles formidable enough to be challenging and exciting, but not so much that the player feels more burdened than empowered. The best walk that line almost perfectly, and The Entropy Centre is chock full of them. But The Entropy Centre is more than its brain teasers, and it’s that “more” where the game hits its stumbling blocks. Despite that, its core design is unlike anything I’ve ever played, and genre enthusiasts will find that this game be…</span>

                              <span>Atomic Heart, the BioShock-esque shooter set in an alternate reality&#x27;s Soviet Union, will be released this February. 
More specifically, the game will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on February 21, 2023. Developer Mundfish and publisher Focus Entertainment announced this news in a new and bloody gameplay trailer showcasing more of what to expect in the game early next year. 
Check out the Atomic Heart release date trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Atomic Heart continues to look great in trailers and I can&#x27;t wait to finally go hands-on with it in just four months, especially as a fan of BioShock. While Atomic Heart is doing its own thing, it&#x27;s hard not to compare it to the BioShock series given the whole alternate reality thing, the types of guns on display here, the enemies we&#x27;ll be facing, and the hand-controlled powers. 
Atomic Heart was revealed years ago, and there are plenty more trailers to watch if you&#x27;re interested. Check out this 2020 gameplay trailer for an early look at the game, and then watch this 2021 trailer for a look at the creepier side of Atomic Heart. Find out why it&#x27;s one of our most anticipated horror games after that, and then watch this action-packed combat trailer from earlier this summer. 
For additional information about Atomic Heart, be sure to check out Mundfish&#x27;s official website, where there&#x27;s info about the game&#x27;s different editions available for preorder and more.

                              <span>Copyright holders often write to internet billpayers claiming that their IP addresses have been linked to piracy. They say that billpayers are liable because they pirated content themselves or failed to stop someone else who did. When movie company Voltage Holdings tried to win default judgments against 30 internet subscribers, none of whom were shown to be the actual infringers, a judge refused to comply. In its appeal, Voltage says the judge made the wrong decision.

                              <span>According to a Bloomberg report, video game publisher Embracer has shut down Onoma, the studio formerly known as Square Enix Montreal, just months after its acquisition. Some staff will be transferred to Eidos Montreal, another studio owned by Embracer. This news comes just a few weeks after Onoma underwent a rebranding process where it adopted the new name.
Onoma was best known for its work on the Go series, turn-based spin-offs of popular Eidos Interactive titles designed for mobile. This includes Hitman Go, Lara Croft Go, and Deus Ex Go. Their most recent work was Tomb Raider Reloaded, which came to mobile devices earlier this year, and their future plans involved a title based on Avatar: The Last Airbender.
Earlier this year, Onoma was just one part of a much larger series of Embracer’s acquisitions, which included Crystal Dynamics and Eidos Montreal. In August, Embracer proceeded to acquire Limited Run Games, Tripwire Interactive, Tuxedo Labs, the IP rights to The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, and several more studios.
The Bloomberg report also says that the closure is part of a cost-cutting initiative, and that Eidos Montreal will have projects scaled back and cut as well. Some of these resources will be redirected to assist in the development of a game in the Fable franchise, led by Playground Games.

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II is a very unpleasant game. Like every Call of Duty game, the majority of time spent playing involves either killing or being killed in horrendous ways, for one thing, and there’s a natural revulsion that comes from seeing so many gouts of blood shooting from bodies or the ragged slump of newly lifeless human corpses piled up in a doorway. And yet, the surface-level hideousness of its parade of death might not be so notably ugly if it wasn&#x27;t for Modern Warfare II&#x27;s cast of c…</span>

                              <span>The official Sonic the Hedgehog YouTube channel has uploaded an animated short titled “Sonic Frontiers Prologue: Divergence.” Starring Knuckles, the short reveals how he wound up on the island players explore in Sonic Frontiers. You can watch the six-minute animation in its entirety below.


In the trailer, Knuckles provides a voice-over explanation of his background up until now, including the fact that he was tasked with guarding the Master Emerald, a relic that hasn’t appeared in the Sonic series for quite some time. The trailer ends with Knuckles absolutely demolishing some robots, and while we’ve received no indication that he will be playable in Sonic Frontiers, that sequence makes me hope he will be.
Knuckles has been a core Sonic character for most of the franchise’s existence, so it’s not surprising that he’s making an appearance in the blue blur’s latest adventure. While this animated prologue gives us insight into how he wound up on the island, it’s still not entirely clear why, especially when it comes to the appearance of Sage (a new character introduced in Sonic Frontiers) at the end of the trailer. We’ll have to wait for the full game to find out.
The past month has been full of Sonic news. We got a December 14 release date for Sonic Prime, Sonic Frontiers got a trailer confirming Super Sonic would be playable in the game, and we learned that the Sonic series has sold over 1.5 billion copies worldwide. For more Sonic news, check out our cover story from earlier this year, and stay tuned for more Sonic Frontiers coverage when the game releases on November 8.</span>

                              <span>Developer Salt &amp; Pixel and publisher VoxPop Games have revealed Outer Terror, a new arcade bullet hell with roguelite elements coming to PC soon. That&#x27;s because its release is set for sometime this year, and given there are only two months left in 2022, it sounds like we won&#x27;t have to wait too long to check it out. 
Outer Terror&#x27;s inspirations are clear from the jump: pulpy horror comics and B-movie horror from the 1980s and 1990s with a dash of arcade fun thrown in for good measure. In the game, you&#x27;ll choose from one of 10 survivors to control, each with their own unique weapons and skills, to face off against waves of enemies. You can play by yourself, but you can also team up with a friend via two-player co-op.

                              <span>Spry Fox, the developer of games like Cozy Grove and Alphabears, is joining Netflix games to become the company’s sixth in-house game studio. The news was announced through a blog post on the Spry Fox website, which also answers some questions about the future of the studio.
Spry Fox says the partnership will not change any of their upcoming plans, meaning that Cozy Grove 2 and their unnamed non-violent MMO will still be developed as planned. Instead, Netflix will provide them with financial support, which Spry Fox says will allow them to “stop stressing” about how their games will generate profit. Despite all of Netflix’s current games existing through their mobile app, the blog post does not mention anything about platform exclusivity.
Spry Fox joins five other in-house game developers at Netflix: Next Games (Stranger Things: Puzzle Tales), Night School Studio (Oxenfree), Boss Fight Entertainment (Dungeon Boss), and two internal studios in Helsinki, Finland and southern California.
Netflix launched its games collection just over a year ago, in November of 2021. Currently, subscribers can play over 30 games on their mobile app, including Into the Breach, Spiritfarer, and Poinpy. On top of that, Netflix has over 50 more games in development. Have you had a chance to play any games on the Netflix app? Let us know in the comments.</span>

                              <span>When Electronic Arts&#x27; Motive Studios announced its Iron Man game in September, we learned it would be the first of a multi-game deal between the publisher and Marvel. That was a vaguely defined arrangement at the time, but we now know the partnership will produce a minimum of three titles.
EA announced the news in a press release, with the publisher describing it as a “long-term” deal that could extend beyond three games based on the wording. The release also specifies these titles will be action-adventure games for consoles and PC, each featuring original stories in the Marvel universe. 
It&#x27;s worth clarifying that EA is not getting exclusive rights to Marvel like it had with Star Wars. There are multiple Marvel games in the works at various studios, including the recently announced Captain America/Black Panther game from Amy Hennig’s Skydance New Media. 
“We have been long-time fans of Marvel and their impressive leadership, so this is a remarkable moment for our developers as well as our players and fans,” said EA COO Laura Miele. “We look forward to welcoming Marvel into the EA family of creators and know this collaboration will produce exceptional experiences for our players. We can’t wait to see players&#x27; reactions when they suit up as Iron Man and do the extraordinary things this Super Hero is known for.”
We’re curious to learn what other Marvel projects are on the docket and which EA studios are behind them. Motive’s Iron Man, a single-player third-person action game, is currently in pre-production, so it’s a long way from release (the team is also making the Dead Space remake). What heroes would you like to see EA tackle, and which studio do you want to see bring them to life? Let us know in the comments.</span>

This news comes by way of a new interview between Spencer and the Same Brain YouTube channel, where Spencer said Activision Blizzard would keep releasing Call of Duty games on Sony consoles &quot;as long as there&#x27;s a PlayStation out there to ship to,&quot; as reported by Eurogamer. 
&quot;We&#x27;re not taking Call of Duty from PlayStation,&quot; Spencer said. &quot;That&#x27;s not our intent. Our intent is not to do that. As long as there&#x27;s a PlayStation out there to ship to, our intent is that we continue to ship Call of Duty on PlayStation, similar…</span>

ScummVM 2.6.1 is a maintenance release mainly focused on improving the new features and engines we introduced in our previous release.
This update includes upgrades for the following engines:
AGS
AGOS
Asylum
Ultima
SCI
SCUMM
Tinsel
Toltecs
Toon
Other improvements include upgrading the icon-based grid view in the ScummVM launcher and fixing OpenGL render graphic corruptions.
Finally, Android users will be able to properly use a mouse on virtual screens, and Windows users will not have any duplicated icons folder issues.
You can find all of this goodness available for a number of platforms on our downloads page. If you are using Windows, macOS, the Ubuntu Snap package or the FlatHub repository, the auto-update robots will assist you in updating to ScummVM 2.6.1.
As always, the detailed list of improvements is available here.
Thank you for your continuous support — happy adventuring!

Luckily, I can offer you the first testing release of the 13.X release series. We collected whatever we could find on the cutting room floor to get you a Halloween release. Some of the higlights of this release include: Build NewGRF objects over an era with click-and-drag. Wider rivers on map generation. Improved handling of HiDPI and mixed-DPI screens. Some more GUI improvements like a cleaned up finance window. Many bug-fixes (over 50 of them), tweaks, changes, and other additions. (As ever, see the changelog for further details). The usual titlegame competition has been announced on the forums. See the page for the exact competition rules if you are interested. Download Changelog Bug tracker</span>

                              <span>Remember Mewgenics? The wacky cat-breeding roguelike is the brainchild of Super Meat Boy co-creator and The Binding of Isaac mastermind Edmund McMillen and has been in and out of the works for a decade. After being announced, put on hold, and restarted, it appears to have a new release window. 
McMillen tweeted a gif of two of the game’s adorable cats engaging in what we&#x27;ll call an intimate cat exercise. The tweet links to the game’s Steam page, which lists a 2024 release window.

What the heck is Mewgenics? The game tasks players with collecting and breeding hundreds of cats to train and send into battle. Or, as the Steam description puts it, Mewgenics is a “turn-based legacy roguelike draft sim about cats!” The game apparently boasts “100s of hours” of gameplay, multiple classes with over 50 unique abilities, over 200 enemies, and other features. 
Mewgenics was first announced in 2012, with McMillen at the time describing it as &quot;By far the strangest project I&#x27;ve ever worked on.” McMillen has worked on it alongside Tyler Glaiel; the pair previously partnered for The End is Nigh, among other titles. The game was originally billed as a cross between Pokémon, The Sims, and Animal Crossing, and had first been planned to release in 2014. It was, of course, delayed, and its development was put on indefinite hold in 2016 when McMillen began work on The Legend of Bum-Bo, which launched in 2019. At the time, McMillen was unsure of Mewgenics’ future, but in 2018 he announced he was remaking the game to be released in “a few years.” 
The game is slated to launch for PC, though whether or not it’s still coming to iOS is unknown. Are you still interested in Mewgenics? Let us know in the comments! For more on Edmund McMillen, we spoke with him last December where he discussed his life and career, including Mewgenics, which you can read in this interview feature.</span>

                              <span>With Pokémon Scarlet and Violet right around the corner, The Pokémon Company is releasing a new expansion in its Sword and Shield series. Silver Tempest stars Alolan Vulpix on the key art, but monsters like Lugia, Serperior, Ho-Oh, and Mawile share the spotlight. Meanwhile, players can expect cards starring Regieleki and Regidrago.
The Pokémon Company sent us several booster packs so we could open them and see what we pull. While it may just be dumb luck, I feel like this expansion gave me better pulls than any others in recent memory. As I cracked these open, I was met with several attractive full-art cards, as well as some gorgeous Trainer Gallery cards. I even managed to pull two of the three new Radiant Pokémon cards. 
This expansion adds over 190 cards to the ever-growing library of Pokémon cards. That number includes 6 Pokémon VSTAR cards, 15 Pokémon V cards, 1 Pokémon VMAX card, 30 special art Trainer Gallery cards, and more than 15 Trainer cards. You can see my favorite pulls from this expansion below.

Pokémon Trading Card Game: Sword and Shield – Silver Tempest launches on November 11. For all things Pokémon Trading Card Game, head to our special hub by clicking on the banner below!</span>
