There might not be any Legend of Zelda game coming out anytime soon, but First 4 Figures is planning to fill this gap with another gigantic and expensive resin statue.
This time it&#x27;s &#x27;Link on Horseback&#x27; - based on Link from The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Unfortunately, the horse isn&#x27;t Epona. There&#x27;s no price yet or release date, but you can expect to find out more next week on the 16th of August.

Humble Bundle always has some great deals on games, but one of its newest bundles, Resident Evil Decades of Horror, has got to be just about the best value of any game sales right now. Not only can you get eleven different Resident Evil games for $30 (plus a half off coupon for Village), but some of the proceeds from the bundle&#x27;s sales go to the charity organization Direct Relief&#x27;s crisis relief in Ukraine.

Sony shared the new games coming to the PlayStation Plus Game Catalog in August for Extra and Premium subscribers, and I hope you like Yakuza or are willing to give it a chance. Heavily discounted as they often are, the Yakuza games rule, and Yakuza 0, especially, is an all-time great video game — the kind that will sit with you for years.
It feels strange to call Monopoly Madness a hidden gem, but it is. Take a chance on it.
Here&#x27;s the full lineup, which some of you might find disappointing.

                              <span>Storm the DioField today
Square Enix and Lancarse&#x27;s strategy RPG The DioField Chronicle has a demo, and it&#x27;s available right now. The upcoming game has an introductory demo live now on digital storefronts for PC and console.
The demo kicks off right at the opening of the game, and up through the first chapter. Save progress will carry over from the demo into the full version of The DioField Chronicle.
You can find it here on the PlayStation Store for PS4 and PS5, the Microsoft store for Xbox Series X|S and One, on the eShop for Nintendo Switch, and on PC via Steam.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;16eW4pAJUKU
The DioField Chronicle is a strategy RPG following a band of mercenaries, caught up in the war and machinations of the politicians around them. A core group of heroes tries to navigate shady dealings and plots while trying to effect change for the better, especially on the island nation of DioField.
Keeping three moves ahead
I got the chance to check out The DioField Chronicle early, and played this section in particular. You can find my full impressions here, but I came away surprised by how different it felt.
This year is not exactly wanting for tactical RPGs, with new entries like Triangle Strategy and the revival of classics like Tactics Ogre and Front Mission providing ample fodder for strategy fans. The DioField Chronicle stands out by taking a real-time strategy spin on the RPG concept, allowing units to move in real-time on the field.
Mix in some interesting class variations and some tight, well-designed arenas to fight in, and it all works pretty well. The player can even retreat to a home base and chat with allies, build up base buildings, and purchase upgrades, in a very Fire Emblem: Three Houses manner.
If you like a little strategy mixed into your RPG, it&#x27;s worth giving a shot. The DioField Chronicle demo is out now, and the full game is out on September 22.

Warner Bros. has given new studio Player First Games some of its most popular characters to carve out space in the Smash Bros.-dominated IP-crossover-fighter genre. MultiVersus succeeds where others have failed, but it still has some growing to do.
Though LeBron James appears on the roster thanks to his starring role in Space Jam: A New Legacy, the WB roster in MultiVersus doesn’t feel as icky as the roster of that film. Each character is treated with reverence, creating a world where you eventually don’t b…</span>

                              <span>How much gaming monitor can you get for £100? Not much, it turns out - but I did spot something unexpected for £10 more: a genuine ultra-wide monitor. Now, it&#x27;s not a stunner as far as looks go, and it&#x27;s not got the latest specs either. But what it has got is an expansive 25-inch span, a 2560x1080 resolution and a blistering refresh rate of... 75Hz. OK, so it&#x27;s far from the best gaming monitor on the planet, but getting an IPS monitor of this size is honestly not bad going - especially as it&#x27;s been reduced from a UK RRP of £170.

                              <span>I was a bit sad when Square Enix announced last month that PC players would be missing out on the first demo for their upcoming strategy game The DioField Chronicle, but happily the RPG giant has reconsidered their tactical options and released it on Steam after all. The move coincides with pre-orders also going live, but the good news is that your save data, progress and character levels from the demo will all transfer over to the final game should you decide to take the plunge in full when the game comes out on September 22nd. Huzzah.

Cameras won by only eight votes, so you&#x27;d better join in if you feel strongly about this week&#x27;s face-off. And this one might involve taking a face... off.

It’s also a skyscape-swinging, baddie-decking good time, so says Alice Bee’s review, and one that comes with plenty of special features just for the Windows version. I’ll be posting a more performance-and-hardware-focused guide to it later this week, but in the meantime I called up Jurjen Katsman, founder and senior director of development at Nixxes, and Mike Fitzgerald, core technology director at Insomniac, for a chat about how Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered makes the jump to PC.

                              <span>When Sony revealed that Spider-Man Remastered was headed to PC earlier this year, I became fixated with the idea that the game would potentially work on the Steam Deck. I mean, it worked on a base PS4, right? By my understanding the Steam Deck is basically just a PS4 with a screen slapped on it, so surely portable Spider-Manning wasn&#x27;t an unrealistic thing to expect?
After spending a few days testing out the game on the Deck I&#x27;m thrilled to confirm that Spider-Man Remastered plays great on Valve&#x27;s handheld with only a few very minor caveats. Hooray! I can finally punch a Vulture in my back garden without getting shouted at by local bird protection services. What a time to be alive.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve played a lot of Spider-Man games. To this day I nurture the belief that all tutorials should be narrated by Bruce Campbell. I even played Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions, which had four different web-dudes and later inspired the Spider-Verse storyline in the comics. Point is, I&#x27;m standing on pretty solid ground to judge Spider-Man games. Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man, originally released onto Sonyboxes in 2018, is finally coming to PC in a Remastered form, and let me tell you: it is a great Spidey game.

You know Spider-Man. He&#x27;s a dude named Peter Parker who was bitten by a radioactive spider and can now climb up walls and punch criminals really well. Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man Remastered lets you roleplay being Spidey against the backdrop of a big, living New York city. It is, if you&#x27;ll excuse the pun, amazing. Now, is it the best Spidey game? Nah. I reckon that&#x27;s its spin-off/sequel Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man: Miles Morales, but that&#x27;s not on PC yet. This means Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man gets to be the best wall-crawler game on PC for another few months, which isn&#x27;t a bad consolation prize.

                              <span>A bright sun heralds the start of day 37 for CultPaperShotgun. Katharine wakes up and immediately sets to work cleaning up the mountains of poop and vomit puddles left over from the previous night&#x27;s revelries. As she works, she spies her good friend Alice B harvesting cauliflowers from the cult&#x27;s garden, trying to keep as far as possible away from the (now slightly rotting) corpse of Graham that lays nearby. A cluster of other followers are busy dancing around a shrine in the centre of the village, but they all stop to witness a fight between the two oldest members of the cult - Alice0 and Liam. Ritual combat of the elderly is a staple of CultPaperShotgun, and as Alice0 delivers the final blow to an ailing Liam, cries of euphoria reverberate about the camp as his spirit (and chunks of flesh) are donated to the cause.
Where am I in all this, you ask? I, the Lamb, the glorious leader of our cult, the holy vessel of Death itself, and the sworn enemy of the Bishops of the Old Faith that are destined soon to die by my blade? I&#x27;m kicking back at a nearby camp, enjoying a spot of fishing and a friendly game of Knucklebones.
This, friends, is Cult Of The Lamb. And it is excellent.

First published in Japan last year, Swery took to Twitter yesterday to announce its English translation by Dan Luffey is now available digitally. You might want to sit down for the synopsis, though. It sounds wild.

                              <span>Some of the early trailers for Forspoken, a Squeenix action-adventure/RPG epic coming in January, suggested portentious world-saving stuff. This is a different vibe to a clip shared on Forspoken&#x27;s offical Twitter this week, which featured main character Frey Holland doing a &quot;Yup, that&#x27;s me!&quot; kind of elevator pitch for the game. A lot of people on the birdsite took an instant, vehement dislike to Frey&#x27;s dialogue, and were just as instantly sure who to blame for the peachy keen quiplashing, even if by proxy. Yes, Joss Whedon strikes again.

                              <span>You know when a game instantly charms the socks off you the moment you first clap eyes on it? Point and click puzzler Lost In Play is one of those games for me. Its vibrant cartoon visuals immediately caught my attention when I first sampled its Steam Next Fest demo earlier in the year, and I&#x27;m happy to report that the full game, out today, is just as captivating as it was back then. 
It tells the tale of Toto and Gal, a pair of rambunctious siblings who end up far from home after getting lost inside a fantasy world of their own imagining. If they don&#x27;t find a way back before nightfall, though, they&#x27;ll be stuck there forever. A classic kids adventure story, in other words, but one that really relishes in its own sense of playfulness. Over the course of their four-odd hour adventure, they&#x27;ll meet monster fighting frogs in a dark forest, board game-playing seagulls on the high seas, orc mechanics in a vast desert and even a heavy-metal loving sheep on a floating island in the sky as they make their way home  to their messy childhood bedroom. It all makes for some memorable puzzling backdrops, but be warned: if you&#x27;re planning to play this with little ones, then you&#x27;ll definitely need a puzzle savvy adult in the mix, as some of its brainteasers aren&#x27;t quite as child-friendly as you might expect.

Betrayal At Club Low is the name, and an RPG infiltrating a former coffin factory-turned-nightclub is its game. This time, Cosmo D says he&#x27;s inspired by one-shot indie RPGs as we roll dice, bake pizzas, and try to help an undercover agent escape.

                              <span>In Splatoon 3, the part-time party never stops
In today&#x27;s Splatoon 3 Direct, we got a deep-dive on many of the modes coming to the next Splatoon. And one returning mode from Splatoon 2 is getting a few big upgrades, including one major one: it&#x27;s available any time, all the time.
For those who played Splatoon 2, you&#x27;ll remember that the co-op Salmon Run mode was a timed event. Special windows would be open only at set times to play the PvE mode.
Well, according to the Splatoon site, Splatoon 3&#x27;s Salmon Run mode is available any time. So yes, that means you won&#x27;t have to set a time and date for those part-time jaunts into Salmonid territory.
During today&#x27;s Direct, we also got a look at a few of the special enemies that will be causing problems for the Golden Egg collectors. These Boss Salmonids have special moves and weaknesses, like the barrier-popping, lid-dropping Slammin&#x27; Lid. Or the mortar-launching Big Shot, who seems like a big problem if left unattended.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;aiuIZN0KDFQ
These new bosses add a little extra challenge, and on top of that, there are King Salmonids. According to today&#x27;s Direct, this special event can sometimes occur at the end of a job. You have to do as much damage as possible within a time limit to drive back the big bad, using special Golden Egg Cannons.
The Big Run is another special event that occurs once &quot;every few months,&quot; where Salmonids invade the city. Functionally, it looks like that means playing Salmon Run on regular Splatoon maps. It looks pretty exciting, but there is one update that&#x27;s big for any Salmon Run fan.
Don&#x27;t stop me now
Even more was shown off during today&#x27;s Splatoon 3 Direct, including new amiibo coming this holiday season and a special card game mode that&#x27;s being added to the action. It looks like next month is going to be one heck of a dive back into the inky world of Splatoon.
Splatoon 3 will launch on September 9 for the Nintendo Switch.

                              <span>GTA and Breaking Bad would be a match made in heaven
Breaking Bad is widely regarded as one of the best TV series of all time, and frankly, its subject matter would make for a great game. The show&#x27;s creator Vince Gilligan thought so too, because he at one point pitched a GTA-like adaptation of the iconic series. Originally reported by ComicBook, Gilligan expressed the interest he had in turning Breaking Bad into a game on a recent episode of his podcast &quot;Inside The Gilliverse,&quot; where he was accompanied by Eric Broadbent and Peter Gould.
Gilligan said that he&#x27;s &quot;not much of a video game player,&quot; but that he wanted to reach out to the studio that owns Grand Theft Auto and see if they could make &quot;like a module&quot; inspired by his series. Even for someone who doesn&#x27;t know games all that well, he might be onto something with a Breaking Bad x GTA DLC.
&quot;There have been quite a few attempts at video games,&quot; Gilligan continued. &quot;Some of them kinda sort of made it to market. We tried to do a VR experience with the Sony PlayStation VR headset. We did a mobile game that lasted for a little while.&quot; He&#x27;s referring to a narrative base-builder game that was released back in 2020 called Breaking Bad: Criminal Elements, but it didn&#x27;t last longer than a year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;bVpGPX_Lj64&amp;t&#x3D;3069s
Gilligan also shared the sentiment that the team behind Breaking Bad didn&#x27;t want to create a bad game that only drew players because of its association with the show, specifically referencing the colossal failure of the 1982 E.T. game for the Atari as something they wanted to avoid replicating.
I honestly find it impressive that conversations are still swirling about adapting Breaking Bad into a game — it speaks to the legacy the show has built nearly a decade after it went off the air.

Nintendo hosted a Splatoon 3 Direct today, detailing what&#x27;s to come in September. Alongside that news, it also launched a site for Splatoon 3 with even more info, including what rewards players with save data from Splatoon 2 will get in the new game.
According to the Splatoon 3 site, users who have Splatoon 2 save data can get a few different bonuses when they load up the third game. They range from equipment benefits to unlocking a few multiplayer settings earlier than others.
One of the Splatoon save data bonuses is three Gold Sheldon Licenses. These will let players access their favorite weapons immediately, without concerns about player level. So if you have a particular favorite from previous Splatoon games that you want to check out, you can grab …</span>

                              <span>One more round for Street Fighter V
Without hyperbole, it&#x27;s safe to say that Evo 2022 was a huge success — perhaps one of the greatest editions of the Evolution Championship Series ever, in fact. Returning in a physical capacity for the first time in years, fighting game fans were treated to hundreds of exciting matchups, some quality presentation, a fistful of exciting reveals, updates, and announcements, and some amazing in-ring action.
And the good times are set to continue, as it has been officially announced that Evo will be returning not only to western shores in 2023, but also in the east, as Evo Japan makes its own grand stage return next spring. The Japanese iteration of the event will take place at Tokyo Big Sight in Odaiba, Tokyo, for the weekend of March 31 — April 2. While a full card is yet to be announced, Arc System Works&#x27; Guilty Gear Strive, SNK&#x27;s The King of Fighters XV, Bandai Namco&#x27;s Tekken 7, and Capcom&#x27;s Street Fighter V: Champion Edition are all confirmed to be in attendance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;T9I0GG0UR-k
The appearance of SFV on the main card is something of a curiosity, given that Capcom is looking at a spring 2023 release for its successor, Street Fighter 6. The Industry&#x27;s Chris Moyse is still betting on a February release, but one would imagine that such a launch date (March at the latest) would be just a tad too late to see the new fighter headline the Evo Japan card. Still, it&#x27;s quite clear that Capcom will want SF6 out in plenty of time to qualify for next year&#x27;s Evo USA, so the predicted date still stands.
Evo Japan will return in March 2023. Be sure to check out all of the fighting game headlines from the past weekend over in our round-up guide right here.

Indie outfit COWCAT has announced that its fun-looking point &#x27;n&#x27; click/brawler hybrid Brok the InvestiGator is almost ready to embark upon its first case. The animated adventure will come busting out on PC August 26, with a bevy of additional console ports scheduled for winter 2022.
Brok the InvestiGator is set in an alternative anthropomorphic universe and sees the down-on-his-luck boxer turned private detective eking out a living among the city&#x27;s more downtrodden and repressed denizens. However, a new case looks to shed new light on the life of Brok and his stepson, Graff, with spiraling events that may lead to answers about the tragic events that took the life of Brok&#x27;s wife and Graff&#x27;s mother. Break out the detective hat and knuckledusters — We got ourselves a mystery to solve.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;6JKf3uNTl4A&amp;t
As both Brok and Graff, players will embark upon a classic point-and-click adventure, conversing with the locals, solving puzzles, and gathering clues in order to progress the intriguing narrative. These investigative moments will be frequently interrupted by ne&#x27;er-do-wells, forcing our heroes to engage in bouts of down &#x27;n&#x27; dirty 2D brawler action, which makes for a fine mix of action, adventure, and mystery. Packed out with a wealth of comic-style artwork, a fully-voiced cast of characters, and even multiple endings, Brok the InvestiGator is a very ambitious project from the young studio, and definitely worth keeping an eye on for those of the point &#x27;n&#x27; click, brawler, or furry persuasion.
Brok the InvestiGator launches August 26 on PC (via Steam and GOG). PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch ports will follow this winter.

                              <span>Yeah, I guess this is something I do now
When we last left Forspoken, the jury was still out on it, and it was delayed into 2023. I&#x27;m cautiously optimistic for some parts of it. But now it&#x27;s time for Forspoken&#x27;s quippy dialogue to really face the music.
A lot of prospective fans have been waffling on the dialogue since it was announced, which can definitely teeter into the realm of overly-edgy. A new tweet this week from Square Enix, which showcased some gameplay and reminded us of the January 2023 release date, didn&#x27;t instill much confidence that things have improved.
Alright, so here&#x27;s the tweet:
https://twitter.com/Forspoken/status/1556679378892898306
&quot;So let me get this straight&quot;
&quot;I&#x27;m seeing freaking dragons&quot;
&quot;And oh yeah I&#x27;m talking to a cuff&quot;
&quot;Yeah OK that is something I do now!&quot;
It&#x27;s essentially a 2022 version of &quot;record scratch: so you&#x27;re probably wondering how I got myself into this situation,&quot; right? While the narrative can still deliver, I&#x27;m not sure I can stand to listen to the constant quips. And this is before the game is out!
Various content creators have taken to roasting the promo, including the following choice videos:

At what point do people slide down the volume on Forspoken&#x27;s quippy dialogue? I guess we&#x27;ll find out on January 24, 2023.

We&#x27;re just a fortnight out from the launch of the super stylish-looking Shin Megami Tensei title Soul Hackers 2, which will launch on PC and console platforms come August 25 — and while the demon-hunting adventure hasn&#x27;t hit the streets yet, Atlus is already getting its DLC machine in gear.
On launch day, multiple paid DLC packs will be made available for Soul Hackers 2, comprised of additional music tracks, in-game costumes, extra in-game currency/items, and — perhaps a little more egregiously — a full alternate story chapter featuring a super-cool new devil summoner, Nana. Here&#x27;s a shocker: She has a sort of &quot;gothy/punky&quot; aesthetic, as do day one DLC characters for all video games in existence.
You can check out a Japanese trailer spotlighting all of the DLC below. More images are available over on the official Atlus Japan website.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;H3QzKiFiVCE
There are four paid DLC packs in total. One featuring the extra character/scenario, one featuring a roster of additional demons, and one featuring a variety of character skins — including gear representing previous titles such as Persona 5, Shin Megami Tensei IV, and the original Soul Hackers, as well as the obligatory &quot;swimsuit&quot; wardrobe. Each pack can be purchased separately or in an &quot;All-in-One&quot; bundle for a discounted price of ¥4,840, or roughly $35 USD. Don&#x27;t shoot the messenger.
Soul Hackers 2 launches August 25 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

Spider-Man PC is bringing the modern Insomniac classic to a wider market, just like God of War and several others did before it. The spice must flow, and so must ports.
What can be said about Spider-Man that hasn&#x27;t already been said? Well, not much! But this port is new.

Despite the déjà vu, I found myself getting lost in playing Spider-Man all over again — even though the purpose of this exercise was to mainly test performance. The intro says everything it needs to say about Peter Parker, then he quickly becomes Spider-Man, and we&#x27;re on our way with some organic tutorials on how to web-sling and get around. Even slipping into the Arkham Asylum/Assassin&#x27;s Creed 2 combat was like riding a bike: it felt like second nature to web up a goon near a wall so that you cou…</span>

Cult of the Lamb is what happens when snappy roguelite dungeon-crawling action meets freaky animal cult base building and management, and it&#x27;s a wild, intoxicating fusion.
It&#x27;s challenging to combine two very different genres in a cohesive way, making sure each half feels satisfying on its own while also fitting into the bigger picture, but the risk is often worth taking. And the developers at Massive Monster sure pulled it off. Straight away, it&#x27;s clear this is a tortured, sinister-yet-weirdly-cute world worth getting to know. But I was surprised by just how riveting the core &quot;slice and build&quot; loop ended up being.
We&#x27;ve played roguelites that wear out their welcome. We&#x27;ve sunk dozens of hours into town builders. …</span>

Mobile software company AppLovin has issued a proposal to Unity Technologies, offering to merge with the popular and highly widespread game engine creator for a staggering $17.5 billion USD buy-in rate. AppLovin made the offer public yesterday, with Unity Technology currently weighing up its options.
In order for Unity to accept the deal, it must first back out of its current agreement with another mobile-heavy software company, IronSource. IronSource and Unity announced their plans to merge a mere month ago, in a deal that would see IronSource become a subsidiary of Unity Technologies. AppLovin has requested the abolition of these plans as a key qualifier for its own merger proposal.
&quot;Over the last decade, we have built and operated a leading and innovative company in mobile app marketing and monetization solutions,&quot; writes AppLovin CEO Adam Foroughi. &quot;Unity is one of the world&#x27;s leading platforms for helping creators turn their inspirations into real-time 3D content. With the scale that comes from unifying our leading solutions and innovation that would be achieved with the combination of our teams, we expect that game developers would be the biggest beneficiaries as they continue to lead the mobile gaming sector to its next chapter of growth.&quot;
Should the merger go ahead, Unity CEO John Riccitiello — recently embroiled in the &quot;fucking idiots&quot; monetization controversy — would become joint CEO of the new company. In regard to new company stock, Unity shareholders would receive 55% of company shares, with 49% of voting rights shares. AppLovin believes that the merger will result in somewhere in the region of $500-700 million a year in the new company&#x27;s pre-tax revenue.

                              <span>It&#x27;s called Tableturf Battle
Thanks to a new Nintendo Direct, we have confirmation of a new Splatoon 3 card game called &quot;Tableturf Battle.&quot;
It&#x27;s a 1v1 competitive card battling game that you&#x27;ll be playing inside of Splatoon 3, similar to Triple Triad in Final Fantasy, or Gwent in Witcher 3. Battling is done by &quot;laying out cards,&quot; which create different shapes on the battlefield: then you&#x27;ll &quot;unleash&quot; a special attack in some fashion after crafting a calculated shape board state. Tableturf Battle will boast &quot;150 cards&quot; at launch to &quot;collect&quot; in-game.
https://twitter.com/NintendoUK/status/1557355548974137346
To kick it off you&#x27;ll talk to Sheldon in the Splatoon 3 hub (the Tableturf Battle Dojo in Splatsville to be precise), where you&#x27;ll presumably be gifted the &quot;starter deck&quot; that everyone gets by default. How players will earn future decks/cards is currently unknown, but it could be tied to the Tableturf Battle mode, or linked to other in-game activities like the campaign or versus.
Maybe this could become a standalone game one day? While nothing is guaranteed with Nintendo, that seems to be the case for a lot of other card-based spinoffs. If you want to see more, the Tableturf Battle sequence starts at roughly 16:00 in the Direct.

Splatoon 3 amiibo? Sure! We have three more figures on the way thanks to a confirmation from the recent Nintendo Direct presentation.
Those figures are:
Octoling (Blue)
Inkling (Yellow)
Smallfry
They join the current list of Splatoon amiibo, which is formidable at this point:
Inkling Girl (Smash series)
Inkling Girl (Orange)
Inkling Boy (Blue)
Inkling Squid (Green)
Callie
Marie
Inkling Girl (Green)
Inkling Boy (Green)
Inkling Boy (Purple)
Inkling Squid (Purple)
Pearl
Marina
Octoling Girl
Octoling Boy
Octoling Octopus
Inkling Squid (Orange)
Inkling Girl (Red)
According to Nintendo, the new trio is coming &quot;this holiday,&quot; but no further details were provided. Interestingly, amiibo news points out that different regions could be getting individual or 3-pack SKUs. Based on the US Nintendo Direct presentation, individual packs seem to be the default in that region.
Through the presentation, we know that there will once again be an amiibo case to visit to do amiibo-related things. But other than getting new outfits and &quot;posing with your amiibo&quot; for pictures, there isn&#x27;t a whole lot in terms of what each amiibo figure will actually provide, gameplay-wise.
It&#x27;s also very likely that we&#x27;ll get more amiibo for Splatoon 3 at some point, including the new &quot;core&quot; trio of Shiver, Frye, and Big Man. With Callie/Marie and Pearl/Marina setting the precedent, it seems like a good bet.
As always, here&#x27;s a full list of amiibo!

It&#x27;s time for the Splatoon 3 Nintendo Direct! While it&#x27;s not the big all-hands Direct everyone has been wanting, a 30-minute-ish Splatoon 3 spotlight is a fun way to spend a little bit of time hanging out — or in your case, reading a recap!
[This recap will be updated in real time as more news arises]

Here&#x27;s everything that was touched on in the August 10, 2022 Splatoon 3 Nintendo Direct:
We got a quick introduction to the Splatsville hub, with the conceit that the presentation was being narrated thematically by researchers.
Turf War was recapped as a returning 4v4 (three-minute) core mode, with the team that inks the most territory winning the match. Squid surge and squid rolls can allow players to instantly zoom up walls or turn while jumping out of the ink (a timed glow will also…</span>

                              <span>Maybe a date, finally?
After insisting that Sonic Frontiers is coming by the end of the year multiple times, we haven&#x27;t gotten a straight answer yet from Sega. That may change with a release date at the Sonic Frontiers Gamescom announcement, confirmed for August 23 during the Opening Night Live stream.
The tweet included a new piece of art for the game from Sega, and an ominous promise of some sort of announcement. Gamescom Opening Night Live showrunner Geoff Keighley promises &quot;a new look and news&quot; for Frontiers, and at this point, we&#x27;re kind of getting down to the wire. I mean it&#x27;s going to be playable publicly soon, so all the cards will be out on the table. If you&#x27;re interested, the Gamescom Opening Night Live stream will start at 2PM ET on August 23.
I&#x27;m at the point where I&#x27;d just like to play the game and be done with it. Sonic cycles are often exhausting, especially when Sega provides little snippets that don&#x27;t always look great, followed by the onslaught of reactions that are often impacted by underwhelming showings. Sometimes things work out in the end! But I am on my guard after Sonic Forces, so hopefully this new take on the formula brings it.

Quick-time events are a staple of Supermassive Games&#x27; cinematic horror adventures, but are the QTEs too easy in The Quarry? It&#x27;s a more mainstream game, for sure. And while it can be annoying to botch a micro-event and have that snowball into sweeping story changes, the threat of failure ratchets up the stakes. With a new update today, Supermassive will let The Quarry players increase the speed of QTEs to raise the tension.
The setting in question, Min Timer, is under QTE Speed, which is located in the Accessibility settings from The Quarry&#x27;s main menu. It&#x27;s only usable in single-player.

                              <span>The studio is moving back one project so it can get another out the door
Embark Studios recently confirmed it was pushing back one of its titles, ARC Raiders. Alongside the reasoning it gave, the company also shed some light on its future production plans, including a game that it plans to have out ahead of ARC Raiders.
In a blog post, Embark CEO and founder Patrick Söderlund discussed the ARC Raiders delay. As the studio confirmed, the co-op shooter won&#x27;t be launching until next year.
For transparency, Söderlund confirms Embark has several projects in development. Alongside ARC Raiders, the studio is working on a team-based first-person shooter codenamed Project Discovery. It was teased in a tweet, in November of last year.

                              <span>Snow Blind, the next installment in the Mortal Kombat Legends animated film series, got its first trailer today ahead of its October release. The new movie tells the origin story of Kenshi, who tags up with Sub-Zero to kombat Outworld&#x27;s usual suspects and keep the peace (or as peaceful as this universe can get). 
The film explores how Kenshi loses his eyesight and trains to become the master swordfighter that fans have loved since his debut in Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance. Kenshi’s goal: take down a fully cybernetic Kano and his Black Dragon clan. Kenshi has another ace up his sleeve in the form of a powerful ally (?) in Sub-Zero. Some of the characters that appear include Shang Tsung and Kabal and even lesser seen faces like Tremor and Kira. 


Snow Blind is the third Mortal Kombat Legends film following 2021’s Battle of the Realms and 2020’s Scorpion’s Revenge. It will be available on digital storefronts and on Blu-ray on October 8. Personally, I&#x27;m excited to see where it winds up landing on my ranking of every Mortal Kombat on-screen adaptation.</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m recovering from my recent trip to Las Vegas for EVO – the long-standing fighting game championship that invites competitors worldwide. The event is home to vendors, artists, demos for upcoming fighting games, and massive stages where only the best compete in front of thousands of fighting game fans. While on-site for the event, former Game Informer editor John Carson and I traveled to the top floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort with a camera to meet the Arcade1Up folks and play the recently announced Marvel Vs. Capcom 2 cabinet for ourselves. 
Here&#x27;s the video: 


If you&#x27;re looking for more information on the Marvel Vs. Capcom 2 Arcade1Up cabinet, read our news story about the announcement. Here&#x27;s a snippet:
One of the most beloved fighting games of all time is finally getting the Arcade1Up treatment. Marvel vs. Capcom 2, the legendary crossover extravaganza from 2000, is the latest game featured by the replica arcade cabinet company. 
Marvel vs. Capcom 2 gathers 56 playable heroes and villains from both Marvel and Capcom&#x27;s robust catalogs of characters in an over-the-top 3v3 fighting game.

I loved Animal Crossing: New Horizons back in 2020, but its premise wasn’t enough to keep me engaged over time. Designing my island and keeping all of the villagers on it happy was thoroughly enjoyable, but after a few dozen hours, I craved a new type of gameplay to coincide with what I was doing each day. Cult of the Lamb, a mish-mash of adorably cute animals, critters, and creatures and macabre cult-isms, remedies that issue with an expansive action-combat dungeon system. I only wish its base building provided …</span>

To this point, Splatoon 3 has drip-fed players with new information about new weapons, music, and even a special Switch OLED model and Pro Controller themed after the highly anticipated family-friendly shooter. However, now that Splatoon 3 is the next major release on the Switch&#x27;s release calendar, Nintendo officially opened the flood gates this morning with a wealth of information through a special Nintendo Direct all about the ink-covered shooter. 
Splatoon 3 leaves behind Inkopolis in favor of Splatsville, which is out in the heart of the Splatlands. Splatsville is a growing city that has rece…</span>

                              <span>After weeks of videos individually showcasing Gotham Knights’ Nightwing, Robin, and Batgirl, it’s Jason Todd’s turn in the spotlight. A new trailer shows off Red Hood’s brutal, more supernatural approach to battling the Court of Owls.
The in-engine footage showed off the former Robin’s deadly competency with firearms as well his Lazarus Pit-induced powers, such as his spectral leaping ability. We also get a look at a unique cosmetic skin featuring a horned helmet that gives off serious Darth Maul vibes. 


We&#x27;ll see how the Bat family manages on its own when Gotham Knights swoops in on October 25 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</span>

                              <span>We learned in June during the Xbox &amp; Bethesda Games Showcase that Persona 5 Royal would be coming to Xbox consoles alongside Persona 4 Golden and Persona 3 Portable. 
With an official Xbox Series X/S version of the game coming out on Oct. 21, and the remastered version set to hit other consoles then too, we’re just a few months away from seeing what the full JRPG looks like running on a new-gen console. Now we have our best look yet, featuring Persona 5 Royal running at 60 FPS on an Xbox Series X, thanks to Faz on YouTube, as reported by Video Games Chronicle. 
Check it out for yourself below: 


As you can see, Persona 5 Royal looks wildly different running at 60 FPS. Personally, and this is shocking for me to say, I think I prefer it running at 30 FPS. I was chatting with a friend about this last night, but the animation of the game and its general art style lend themselves well to 30 FPS. This remastered 60 FPS look almost takes away some of the shine from the game, giving characters and enemies a matte-like finish. Perhaps it will look better in the final release, but right now, I think I will stick to my PlayStation 4 version.

                              <span>Two Point Campus opened its door today, and we think it’s pretty darn good. But what does a real college professor think? Sega answers this burning question by releasing a video of a qualified educator putting the simulator through its paces. 
Sega enlisted Tracy Fullerton, professor, and director of the game innovation lab at the Univerity of Southern California Games, to enroll in Two Point Campus and react to its zany brand of higher education. Besides providing a nice look at the moment-to-moment gameplay for those curious about the title, it&#x27;s fun to listen to Fullerton&#x27;s takes as both a game maker and a college professor. Check it out below. 


You can judge Two Point Campus for yourself on PlayStation and Xbox (including Game Pass), Switch, and PC.</span>

Fans of the Breaking Bad spin-off Better Call Saul are getting ready to say goodbye to the critically acclaimed series as it heads into its final episode next Monday. But while many are beginning to contemplate what on earth they&#x27;ll be doing with their lives after the finale airs, others are being a bit more productive with their time.
Take YouTuber LumpyTouch and artists Game Boy Demakes, for instance! As reported by our brand new sister site Time Extension, the creators have concocted a beautiful Game Boy adaptation of Better Call Saul that effectively &quot;demakes&quot; some of the show&#x27;s most iconic scenes.

                              <span>Let&#x27;s break down the latest Direct.
Over the past few months, there&#x27;s definitely been a growing concern amongst fans that Splatoon 3 might not be able to justify its own existence. Regardless of your opinion on them, live service games like Fortnite and Apex Legends have proven that it&#x27;s perhaps more beneficial to launch what is effectively a &quot;platform&quot; that developers can build upon for the foreseeable future. Heck, Nintendo itself supported Splatoon 2 for yonks after release, with new content drops and multiple Splatfests for gamers to enjoy. But when it announced that it would be making a third mainline entry in the Splatoon franchise, we must admit, some of us had our doubts it really needed to exist.
You can&#x27;t blame us, either. Since its initial announcement, all we really saw from the new game were minor updates on new maps, weapons, gear, and music — that&#x27;s really it. Does Nintendo really think it can justify a whole new game just to showcase a light refresh of its core content? This ain&#x27;t a FIFA: Legacy Edition. Let&#x27;s not forget that Splatoon 2 was hardly a monumental shift from the template of the first game. With just a month left until launch (September 9th, in case you forgot!), Nintendo needed to demonstrate exactly what Splatoon 3 does that its direct predecessor couldn&#x27;t. And you know what? With its recent Splatoon 3 Direct presentation, it just about succeeded.

If we haven&#x27;t had enough strategy RPG news from Square Enix this year, then the upcoming The DioField Chronicle brings a bit of a twist to the genre. And you can find out just what that twist is as a demo has launched on the Switch eShop today!
Calling itself a &quot;Real Time Tactical Battle&quot; game, this is Square Enix and Lancarse&#x27;s attempt at trying their hands at some real-time strategy action. On a slightly smaller scale to those other veterans, of course. And with this demo comes our favourite modern-day addition — your progress carries over to the full game!

Digerati have today announced that its grizzly cloning puzzle platformer, Overloop, will be coming to Switch at some point in Q4 2022. This will follow the game&#x27;s Steam release which is due later on this month on August 26th.
In a dystopian future (is there really any other kind?) scientists have invented a cloning gun capable of practically maintaining human life for all eternity. In an attempt to overthrow this corrupt governing body, Overloop will see you steal this gun and embark on a mission where the only help available to you is yourself.

Let&#x27;s begin with those updating seasonal catalogues. Nintendo has confirmed that instead of randomly generating new clothing items, Splatoon 3&#x27;s garments will be refreshed with a fresh new catalogue every three months for the next two years. Yep, two years! Now that&#x27;s a lot of crazy sandals.

Here&#x27;s something we didn&#x27;t have on our Splatoon 3 bingo cards! In today&#x27;s Splatoon 3 Nintendo Direct, our Inklings and Octolings won&#x27;t just be duking it out on the stages throughout Splatsville — they&#x27;ll also have something to say at the table in Tableturf Battle.
This new minigame takes place in Splatsville&#x27;s Tableturf Battle Dojo, and it&#x27;s like a weird, wonderful mix of Tetris, trading cards, Columns — you name it! We&#x27;ll be addicted to this for hours, no doubt.

Today&#x27;s Splatoon 3 Direct revealed a whole bunch of new details about the upcoming splatter, including new amiibo and the announcement of a pre-release Splatfest, but it also revealed the new hosts who will introduce the stages when you fire up the game — and this time it&#x27;s a trio.
Replacing Pearl and Marina from Splatoon 2, Deep Cut is the musical outfit that will be giving you the details once you get past the title screen of the new entry. Continuing the series&#x27; trend of musical hosts — with the &#x27;Squid Sisters&#x27; Callie and Marie acting as presenters in the first game, Deep Cut is made up of Shiver, Frye, and Big Man.

Aren&#x27;t you just sick and tired of video game bosses, with their special powers and their cool weapons? Don&#x27;t you think you should have those powers, as the protagonist and hero? In Biomorph, an upcoming 2D Metroidvania, you can.
Drawing inspiration from games like Kirby and Mega Man, Biomorph lets you consume deadly monsters, take their shape, and use their powers to defeat other, smaller monsters as you platform around the place. Their powers are also the driving force behind the Metroidvania part, as their abilities will help you access new areas. But it&#x27;s not just as easy as eating your enemies — each creature that you&#x27;ve committed identity theft with will come back even stronger than before, with all-new powers. That&#x27;ll teach you to eat people.

The UK monthly charts for July are in, showcasing a solid debut for Monolith Soft&#x27;s epig JRPG Xenoblade Chronicles 3, despite the game launching right at the tail end of the month on the 29th.
The game, which stars protagonists Noah and Mio on a quest across the vast landscape of Aionios, lands at number 13 in the physical and digital charts. It&#x27;s worth noting, as ever, that Nintendo does not provide figures for its digital sales, so Xenoblade Chronicles 3 would hypothetically have charted even higher if digital sales were included.

Here&#x27;s something that probably won&#x27;t surprise Waluigi fans (at least we think!) — Waluigi has gone viral on TikTok. But not for the reasons you might think.
Last week, Emily Yates — Cherrie Sorbet on TikTok — shared a video on TikTok that showed seven different people dressed up as Waluigi. The reason? It was for a bachelorette party — or a hen night, for those of us in the UK. Yes, really, a Waluigi bachelorette party. Did you know there are seven different variations of Waluigi? We didn&#x27;t until this.

Uhodnout jde například RSA klíč. Ve skutečnosti Apple M1 nemá SMT, ale pokud by v budoucnu Apple měl procesory se SMT, tak by také patrně byli zranitelné.</span>

The biggest of the changes are to how summoning works, but there are also tweaks to quests, attack speeds, and bug fixes that&#x27;ll maybe not make you die less, but will at least make your deaths fairer.

                              <span>Update: the Iskur XL appears to be out of stock at Amazon and now back at a more regular price of £490. Original article follows below: 
The XL version of the Razer Iskur gaming chair is down to £287, nearly half the price it is on Razer&#x27;s official website and an all-time historic low price. Curiously, it&#x27;s also nearly £230 cheaper than the regular size version! Katharine reviewed that Iskur previously and rated it highly, so if this size fits you then this is a nice chance to pick it up at a very fair price.

                              <span>Peter is a guy with his head in the clouds. Literally. Well, sort of. A climate science lecturer at Cambridge University, Peter&#x27;s great passion in life is cloud research. All he wants to do is study clouds: their different formations, their flight paths, their properties, everything.  He can’t get enough of them, and finds them fascinating enough to be the subject of his 100-page PhD thesis. It’s a poetic subject and one that matches his temperament as a boyish and awkward researcher and &#x27;path of least resistance&#x27; kinda guy. But around him the world is spiralling from the political tensions of the Cold War, and as much as Peter wishes to escape to in the clouds, current events are keeping him firmly tethered to the realities of an impending war. 
It’s this tension that makes South Of The Circle such an engrossing story. With player choices that subtly tug the game’s narrative needle in ways you might not expect, it&#x27;s clear skies and fair winds for the game’s three-hour journey. But with an abrupt ending after a calculated slow-burn drama, it&#x27;s a rough landing.

                              <span>Sorry, loot box fans
Overwatch&#x27;s third Anniversary Remix event is finally here, and it will be the last that we know of — unless it rolls over into the sequel. The seasonal event has been a fan favorite, not just because you can get some cool limited-time skins, emotes, and voice lines in Overwatch loot boxes, but also because you can replay other limited-time game modes from the other seasonal events.
While it&#x27;s exciting that the Anniversary Remix is back yet again, Blizzard announced some not-as-exciting news along with it: players will no longer be able to buy loot boxes after the end of the event. To be clear, you&#x27;ll be able to purchase loot boxes up from now until August 30 as part of the Anniversary. However, this just applies to the purchase of loot boxes — you can still earn standard loot boxes in gameplay after the event is over.

As would be expected, more changes are coming after Overwatch 2 launches, namely that loot boxes will be done with altogether because the game will be replacing its predecessor.
Because Overwatch 2 will be free-to-play, it will be adopting the seasonal model, which will include both free and paid battle passes. In addition, players will be able to purchase individual cosmetic items as well, in case there&#x27;s just that one skin you can&#x27;t live without. It took me a few years to get the Witch Mercy skin back in the day, so I wish this had been an option a few years ago, to be honest.
While this feels like the end of an era, it&#x27;s probably for the best. Loot boxes can be pretty exploitative, especially for games with younger player bases like Overwatch.
Some countries are banning the practice entirely, so it was only a matter of time before we see the randomized loot box model phased out of games entirely.

                              <span>Get your very own Skyrim foe
The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim can be modded to the moon and back with new magic, models, and systems. But a new Skyrim mod adds the Nemesis system, for a little extra Shadow of Mordor in your Elder Scrolls.
Created by modder Syclonix, the &quot;Shadow of Skyrim&quot; mod adds a new Nemesis-style system to Skyrim. It essentially adds a new player death mechanic, making it so dying in Skyrim adds a bit more narrative flavor and mechanics.
When an enemy takes the player down, they gain a unique name, stats, and more. For example, they might become a shield-breaking vampire. Toggles can allow the enemy to also loot your stuff and use it against you, donning armor the player had been wearing.
Not only does this give you a new objective and quest, but it can turn into a boon, too. The player might gain a certain debuff upon dying, but be able to remove that and replace it with a new buff in its place once besting their rival.

Rivals of Skyrim
While the mod takes inspiration from the Shadow of Mordor and Shadow of War games, the modder emphasizes that it&#x27;s not drawing on specific Mordor gameplay ideas. The concept might have arisen from having a named Nemesis, but its systems are notably different.
And while the important distinctions are one thing, I also like the twists Syclonix puts on this rival system. The flavor text is fun, and I like the idea of gaining rewards and having to recover your armor, almost in a Tarkov-style manner. It&#x27;s also designed to work with a number of other The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim mods. For full compatibility info, you&#x27;ll need to check out the mod page.
You can find the Shadow of Skyrim mod for The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim on NexusMods here.

For even the most diehard VR fans, the cumbersome nature of chunky VR headsets is something of a barrier to overcome in search of an immersive gaming experience. It&#x27;s one of the main factors that keeps VR from becoming more widespread than it already is, but experts have figured out how to remove at least this one inconvenience from the VR experience — researchers from Stanford University and Nvidia teamed up on a project to create a VR headset that is the same size as normal glasses. (Thanks, PC Gamer.)

Input lag — even in 2022, it continues to be a frustrating thorn in the sides of online fighting game players. And, ironically, while the ninth generation of gaming is well underway, it appears that Sony&#x27;s shiny new PlayStation 5 platform tends to exacerbate the issue, rather than repair it.
Case in point: Arc System Works&#x27; Guilty Gear Strive, which currently suffers from an estimated 4.5 frames of input lag on PS5 when compared to its sibling PS4, which only suffers from around 2.5 frames. Input lag is an inevitability in almost all fighting games, but the lower a developer can get the fateful number, the better it is for all players.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;3GYL5FVpjG4
To that end, ArcSys has released Version 1.21 on both PlayStation and PC platforms, bringing with it a few small bug fixes, optimized controls for the Figure Mode and much requested improvements to the server connection time on startup. Specifically for PS5, however, the input includes reoptimized input lag. This should bring the PS5 edition more in line with its PS4 and PC brethren, although ArcSys is tight-lipped on exactly how much faster your chosen fighter will respond to your instructions.

Guilty Gear Strive is preparing to launch its second season, bringing with it new characters, new stages, a new competitive season, and further updates. The wonderful Bridget is already available today, with more content coming to the title over the coming year. Guilty Gear Strive has already smashed the one million sales mark, and hopefully, this popularity will continue across the remainder of 2022 and into 2023.

Clap Hanz, the indie outfit behind the beloved Everybody&#x27;s Golf franchise, has registered two new golf-related trademarks, suggesting that the Yokohama-based studio might be preparing to return to the green in the near future.
As spotted by ResetEra users, (and later reported by VGC), the trademarks Easy Come, Easy Golf and いつでもGOLF, (which roughly translates to &quot;Golf Anytime&quot;), were registered together, which suggests that they are localized names for the exact same project. Whether this represents an all-new golfing franchise or is merely a rebranding for the previously released Apple Arcade game Clap Hanz Golf is unknown.
Everybody&#x27;s Golf launched on PlayStation in 1997 to immediate success, presenting quality golf gameplay with accessible controls, tight mechanics, and a generally cheerful and charming comedic aesthetic. This original release would be followed by over 10 sequels and spin-offs on various PlayStation and mobile platforms. The last iteration launched on PSVR in 2019. Given the closure of PlayStation Studios — as well as an overall disinterest in supporting third-party projects — the chance of the series returning anytime soon is incredibly unlikely.
The franchise is definitely missed by its dedicated playerbase. Given golf&#x27;s intricate technicalities, titles such as the Clap Hanz series — as well as franchises such as Mario Golf and Golf Story — are often very successful, stripping back the simulation efforts and replacing them with colorful and charismatic visuals. Hopefully, Clap Hanz will reveal its plans for the new trademarks very soon.

A monster hunter&#x27;s work is never over, it seems. Capcom showed off a few of the monsters arriving in this week&#x27;s free Title Update 1 for Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak, and they&#x27;re some nasty ones.
The free title update arrives on August 10 for Nintendo Switch and PC, bringing more giant monsters into the fold. From massive wings and whip-like tails to an apparent smoldering magma beast, they all look terrifying in this new trailer.

                              <span>This person &quot;casually found&quot; game-changing cheat codes for character select and multiplayer
A new string of Super Punch-Out cheat code combinations is now lurking about, thanks to community member Unlisted Cheats (who uncovers old school cheats mostly for the NES, Game Boy, and SNES systems).
The first code allows players to access a level select, likely serving as a debug feature. The next code is even more fascinating, as it lets a second player take control of a CPU opponent, to create a &quot;versus&quot; like system. These codes in tandem must have been really useful in testing balance changes. I&#x27;m definitely going to be playing as Narcis Prince immediately. You can find out how to use them below.
Amazingly, these codes do work in the Switch Online version of the game, so you don&#x27;t need the original hardware. How&#x27;s that for relevance! Honestly, it&#x27;s been too long since Punch-Out was in the zeitgeist. I can&#x27;t believe that the last major release was in 2009!
The Super Punch-Out fighter select cheat code
All combinations must be held on Joypad [controller] 2. Then press A or start on Joypad 1.
At the title, hold Y+R, then press A or start.

Reminder: All combinations must be held on Joypad 2. Then press A or start on Joypad 1.
In the above free match mode, at the character info screen, hold B+Y then press A or start.

Activision Blizzard has quietly pulled a new DLC skin from its billion-dollar shooters Call of Duty: Vanguard and Call of Duty: Warzone following accusations of plagiarism from an online artist.
The &quot;Loyal Samoyed&quot; skin is a bizarre conception that features a realistically depicted head of a Samoyed breed canine plastered on the body of a heavily armed mercenary. The strange look is part of a new range of in-game skins just released for Vanguard and Warzone — a pack that also includes looks stylized after characters from movies The Terminator and Terminator 2: Judgment Day.
However, artist and Call of Duty fan Sail Lin has expressed their disappointment, given that the Loyal Samoyed skin is, almost indisputably, pulled from Lin&#x27;s portfolio of animal-based Call of …</span>

Elden Ring patch 1.06 is now live, and there&#x27;s several things that probably need to be highlighted, among balance changes.
Arguably the most interesting tidbit involves White Mask Varre’s questline, which previously required players to engage in PVP to complete it. Now there is a &quot;new way to advance&quot; the quest, without having to resort to PVP. It&#x27;s a big win for 100%ers who don&#x27;t otherwise engage in online play. Speaking of multiplayer though, Elden Ring has &quot;added the function to send summoning signs to summoning pools in multiple areas, including distant areas.&quot; Everyone wins!
As far as the balance stuff goes motion speed has been increased across the board for several weapons, and great axes have been given a general buff (everything is faster). Light equipment loa…</span>

                              <span>A lawsuit filed last year by several Hollywood studios and Netflix targeting illegal streaming veteran PrimeWire now resembles a war of attrition. As efforts to gather intelligence and seize domains continue, the studios have also been dealing with PrimeWire replacement &#x27;HydraWire&#x27;. But despite the numerous hurdles, all signs point to the plaintiffs toughing the case out for as long as it takes.

                              <span>Embark Studios, a young team of former DICE employees led by ex-EA head Patrick Söderlund, has delayed its upcoming shooter, Arc Raiders. The title was initially slated to arrive this year but will now launch in 2023. 
The reason is that the team has decided to pivot and focus on launching another team-based shooter codenamed Project Discovery. A blog post written by Söderlund explains that Embark has several projects in development and that Discovery progressed so quickly that it seemingly caught up to Arc Raiders, presenting the team with the possibility of shipping two games within the same timeframe. However, doing would&#x27;ve been more than the small team can handle. 
“For a young, relatively small studio like ours, releasing two games in short succession would have strained our teams and resources, many of which are shared between the two projects.” Söderlund explains. 
“As such, we decided to let Project Discovery be our studio’s first game to market, pushing Arc Raiders to a 2023 release. It’s a decision that will also allow us to expand and refine the Arc Raiders experience.”
Outside of being a team-based first-person shooter, little is known about Project Discovery. The concept art posted above hints that it&#x27;s set in the current day or perhaps the near future. Söderlund promises to reveal more details “very soon.” 
Arc Raiders made its debut during the 2021 Game Awards and will be a free-to-play cooperative shooter where players work together to battle mechanical creatures from space. It will launch for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</span>

                              <span>To say that Sonic the Hedgehog 2 was successful would be an understatement. The highest-grossing video game film in U.S. history already had a confirmed threequel in the works, but today we found out exactly when we&#x27;ll see Sonic and friends return to the big screen, and it’ll be chillier than usual.
The official movie Twitter account announced the unofficially titled Sonic the Hedgehog 3 will premiere in theaters on December 20, 2024. This marks a big seasonal shift for the franchise as Sonic 1 and 2 arrived during the first halves of their respective years, with the first movie premiering on Valentine&#x27;s Day and the second arriving in April.

The tweet doesn’t reveal anything else about the film, but if you’ve seen the post-credits scene for Sonic 2, you already have a good inkling of where the series is headed. 
December 2024 is a long way off, but Paramount plans to fill the gap with a live-action series starring Idris Elba’s Knuckles hitting Paramount+ next year. There’s also Sonic Prime, Netflix’s animated series that, while disconnected from the film universe, provides another avenue to enjoy the Blue Blur on the small screen. With the next big video game, Sonic Frontiers, slated to launch this fall, the next few years look pretty bright for Sega&#x27;s mascot.

                              <span>Join host Wesley LeBlanc as he rides solo today to showcase a quick glimpse of You Suck At Parking, an upcoming racer with a very unique twist. Instead of racing to a finish line, your objective is stop...in the marked parking stop.  
Stopping in a parking spot might sound easy but as you&#x27;ll soon find out, it&#x27;s anything but because each track is littered with obstacles such as barriers that immediately destroy your car, magnets aiming to pull you off the track, boosters, jump pads, and more. You must survive through it all in order to reach the coveted parking spot at the end of the road. 
Check it out for yourself in the New Gameplay Today below: 


Enjoy this first look at You Suck At Parking as Wesley briefly introduces you to the world of the game before taking a back seat to let you enjoy some uninterrupted gameplay (that&#x27;s harder than it looks so when you see me die a bunch of times, no you didn&#x27;t). You Suck At Parking is slated to launch sometime this year on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.

                              <span>The Sonic the Hedgehog franchise may have turned 30 years old last year, but the party is still going for some. We already knew additional Sonic-themed costumes were planned for Fall Guys this month, but developer Mediatonic this morning announced the details of the collaboration event with Sega&#x27;s iconic brand. The event is meant to celebrate over 30 years of Sonic the Hedgehog and includes a new Sonic-themed level and new outfits. 
The new level is called &quot;Bean Hill Zone&quot; and tasks the Fall Guys beans with collecting as many rings as possible to win special rewards. If players earn 200 points, they get a &quot;Bean Hill Zone&quot; nameplate. Earning 400 points yields 200 kudos, 600 points get a Bonus Rings Pattern outfit, 800 points gives 400 kudos, and 1,000 points gives you access to Sonic&#x27;s iconic sneakers.
Those aren&#x27;t the only rewards you can snatch up during this event, though. New costumes for Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, Super Sonic, and Dr. Robotnik are all available in the store during the event. You can also buy the Sonic Foot Tap emote.
This isn&#x27;t Sonic&#x27;s first appearance in Fall Guys as a costume. Back in 2020, players could pick up this Sonic costume. This special Fall Guys event featuring Sonic the Hedgehog begins on Thursday, August 11, and runs until Monday, August 15.
Fall Guys originally launched on PlayStation 4 and PC, where it found overwhelming success as a fun gameshow-style twist on the battle royale genre, in 2020. In 2021, publisher Epic Games acquired Fall Guys developer Mediatonic. Earlier this summer, Fall Guys changed from a premium model to a free-to-play model, and launched on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and Switch.</span>

                              <span>Join host Wesley LeBlanc as he takes you through a full mission in Square Enix&#x27;s upcoming real-time tactical RPG, The DioField Chronicle. Not only will you be getting a glimpse at what combat in the game looks like, but he gives you a brief glimpse of what you&#x27;re doing in The DioField Chronicle when you&#x27;re not in a battle. 
Developed by Lancarse and Square Enix, this RPG is aiming to feel unique amongst a sea of other tactical RPGs by infusing real-time combat into its formula. So while you are controlling units on a battlefield, you&#x27;re watching their moves play out in real-time, and you must adjust your classic tried-and-true TRPG strategies to match it. 
Check it out for yourself below: 


Enjoy this first look at The DioField Chronicle as Wesley walks you through one full expedition in the game before showing you around the main palace that acts as your home base. The demo showcased here takes place completely within Chapter 1 so if you&#x27;re worried about spoilers, you should be alright. The DioField Chronicle hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on Sept. 22.

                              <span>Marvel’s Midnight Suns, the upcoming card-based strategy RPG by Firaxis, as been hit with its second delay. A Take-Two earnings report revealed that the game had been pushed out of its October 7 date to an unspecified release within the 2023 fiscal year. That means it will now arrive sometime before March 31, 2023.
The game’s Twitter account confirmed the delay with a message, embedded below, that also revealed that the game will now have a staggered release. Midnight Suns will come to PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC first within the fiscal year. The PS4, Xbox One, and Switch versions arrive sometime after that.

August 8, 2022
While Midnight Suns will only face a five-month setback at most (for current-gen, at least) and could technically still arrive in 2022, seeing it suffer another delay is disappointing nonetheless. The game was first announced almost a year ago at last year’s Gamescom. It graced Game Informer’s cover that month and was first scheduled to launch this March before being delayed to October. A reimagining of the Rise of the Midnight Sons comic event, players control a team of occult heroes like Blade, Magik, and Nico Minoru and Avengers like Iron Man, Captain America, and Spider-Man to battle Lilith, the mother of all demons. Midnight Suns&#x27; turn-based combat utilizes a card system for selecting commands, and between battles players explore a headquarters where they can socialize and bond with their teammates. 
We played the first four hours of Marvel’s Midnight Suns in June and wrote up seven takeaways based on our time with it. You can also watch us battle Venom as Spider-Man and other heroes in this episode of New Gameplay Today.</span>

                              <span>It’s been a week since the Diablo 4 beta test started, and players are already leaking footage of the game on the internet.

                              <span>All advertising is evil, obviously. But sometimes, despite this, it can be extraordinarily entertaining. This latest 3D billboard from outside of Tokyo’s Shinjuku Station is maybe the best use of this optical illusion tech I’ve seen, and it’s cross-promoting Pokémon GO and, er, World Cat Day.

                              <span>I don&#x27;t spend a ton of time testing gaming laptops these days, but one of my recent favourites was the Zephyrus G14. This laptop is slim and compact, yet sports a brilliant 14-inch 2560x1600 120Hz display, a powerful RX 6700S graphics card and a top-end Ryzen 9 6900HS processor. This is backed with a 1TB NVMe SSD and 16GB of DDR5 RAM (!!), an impressive loadout that uses basically the fastest and latest-gen components you can fit into a laptop of this size. 
Today Best Buy in the US are doing a great price on this spec of the Zephyrus G14, charging $1399.99 for it rather than the launch price of $1649.99 - a $250 reduction. That&#x27;s the best price we&#x27;ve seen for this model and an awesome deal on a compact yet powerful all-AMD laptop.

                              <span>Graphics cards are falling in price rapidly, and nowhere is this more true than on the bleeding-edge end of the market. After seeing discounts on AMD&#x27;s first 6000-series graphics cards last month, we&#x27;re now also seeing deep cuts to the more recent 6X50 models - including the subject of this piece, the Radeon RX 6950 XT. This particular card is the very fastest that AMD make, and offers rasterised performance on par with Nvidia&#x27;s RTX 3090 and 3090 Ti.
Today, it&#x27;s been discounted to £850 at Scan, a big reduction from its original UK RRP of £1065 earlier this year.

                              <span>You might remember that I couldn’t beat Spelunky 2&#x27;s first stage, no matter how hard I tried. Well, I&#x27;m proud to announce that my fortunes have since changed and that I&#x27;ve bested it. I should say &quot;we&quot;, as my achievement was aided by a co-op pal, and the only person on Earth patient enough to accompany such a terrible Spelunker. We even reached the first boss, and the level after that! Before we both got splatted by an anti-gravity zombie-puppet-that-lives-underwater.
Aside from my – our – achievements, I learned that the game is a perfect measurement of fatigue. Where rulers calculate distance or Ollie&#x27;s highly scientific WIPERS precipitation system measured the best rain in games, Spelunky 2 is the ultimate tool for accurately determining just how tired someone is.

I&#x27;ve crossed the active warzones of GTA Online and PUBG, stunted down murderous descents in extreme sports games, tried to learn serious bike race tactics in strategy games, gone for a weird ride in a walking simulator, and even needed to ride my real bike for a game powered by Strava. For your convenience and enjoyment, that&#x27;s now all gathered here with some bonus bike thoughts.

                              <span>Is it lazy to describe Turbo Golf Racing as ‘Rocket League if the cars were playing golf instead of football?&#x27; A bit, yes. But it’s also largely accurate. Up to eight players race across a track, ramming their boost-enabled car into their huge futuristic golf ball to send it flying forwards until (depending on your skill or luck) it flies/rolls/plops anticlimactically into the big hole at the end. It’s golf, sort of, but fast, demanding, and often unpredictable. You don’t even have to wear silly trousers while playing it, but that’s just my personal choice.
Of course, it’s not quite so simple as hitting your ball forward and relying on the videogame gods to deem your ball worthy of reaching the goal before everybody else’s. There are 30 courses of varying length and complexity, and none of them are a simple drag race to the end. There are ramps, twists, turns, and plenty of obstacles. While the very shortest courses are pretty frictionless (I’ve won a few in under 20 seconds), the longest ones are practically begging you to make agonising mistakes.

                              <span>Dragon Ball FighterZ is finally getting rollback netcode by way of the newly announced PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S versions of the game. The update will also be available on PC.
For the unfamiliar, rollback netcode is a system that provides a nearly lag-free online experience, hence why it&#x27;s always a highly desirable feature in the fighting game community. During EVO 2022, DBFZ producer Tomoko Hiroki shared that the current-gen versions will support rollback netcode, whereas the PS4 and Xbox One editions will not. There&#x27;s no release window for upgraded ports, but a message from Bandai Namco&#x27;s Twitter account states we&#x27;ll learn more information later and that it will take &quot;some time&quot; before the system is finished. 
While that&#x27;s bad news for those who don&#x27;t own a PS5 or Xbox Series X/S, Bandai Namco is at least planning some sort of upgrade path for existing game owners on current consoles (such as Smart Delivery on Xbox). There&#x27;s no mention if the Switch version will receive a rollback netcode.  
Hiroki also announced that Dragon Ball FighterZ is now content-complete, meaning it will not receive any more fighters or balance updates. The game received three DLC fighter packs during its lifetime that added over a dozen characters to its roster. 
Dragon Ball FighterZ first launched in January 2018 and was hailed as one of the best fighting games of the decade and arguably the best Dragon Ball video game period. You can read our review of the launch version of the game here.</span>

                              <span>Bandai Namco revealed a big update for Tekken 7 during this weekend’s EVO tournament, which may have also teased the next entry in the long-running series.
A trailer running down the Tekken 7 balance update, which arrives on August 17 and introduces balance adjustments and new tactics, concluded on a tantalizing note. A clip of Kazuya’s semi-infamous Tekken 1 arcade ending, in which he drops Heihachi off a cliff before giving a cheesy smile to the camera, transitions to a smirking modern Kazuya with a message of “Get Ready.” The clip begins at the 1:40 mark. 


Fans have excitedly interpreted this footage as a teaser for Tekken 8. That would make sense; Tekken 7 launched on consoles in 2017, so it feels like the right time to begin hinting at the next entry. Perhaps it’s a different Tekken project entirely. Or Bandai Namco simply thought this would be a humorous footnote to wrap up its Tekken 7 news.

                              <span>Nintendo has revealed that it will live stream a Splatoon 3 Direct this week. 
More specifically, it will begin at 6 a.m. PT on Wednesday, Aug. 10, and will feature roughly 30 minutes of updates. Check out the announcement for yourself below:

August 8, 2022
As you can see, there’s not much else to glean from this news. If you’re the kind of person who anticipates game-focused Directs to reveal information about other anticipated titles, I would say you should not do that with this one. It seems very much a “we’re only going to talk about Splatoon 3” kind of Direct announcement. Of course, I could be wrong, but you know, expectations and all that. 
However, if you’re a Splatoon fan, it sounds like Wednesday will be an excellent day. Not only are you getting new Splatoon 3 details and information, but “roughly 30” minutes of it – that’s a lot! As for what to expect, new weapons, characters, maps, and story details will likely be showcased. This will probably be the last Splatoon 3-focused Direct, too, considering the game hits Switch less than a month after it on Sept. 9. 
While waiting for Wednesday’s Direct, check out this Splatoon 3-themed Switch console and then listen to this new punk rock-inspired track from Splatoon 3’s soundtrack. After that, check out the latest Splatoon 3 gameplay trailer.

                              <span>SNK revealed during the Evo 2022 fighting game tournament held in Las Vegas that a new Fatal Fury game has been greenlit and is now in development. 
This news comes from a short teaser trailer that showcases a new look at some Fatal Fury art alongside the following message, which plays on screen: “The city of legend still breathes. Hungry wolves back on the prowl. A new destiny hidden in darkness. New Fatal Fury/Garou green-lit.” 
Check it out for yourself below: 


As you can see, SNK didn’t reveal much else, and if you’re a Fatal Fury fan, you probably have many questions. Will this new game adopt a 3D art style like other modern fighting franchises such as Street Fighter 6, or will it stick with traditional 2D art? Which fighters are returning? Will there be new fighters? Only time will tell. 
If you’re unfamiliar with Fatal Fury, you might recognize the name Terry Bogard, who regained some popularity after his inclusion in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. He’s the protagonist of the Fatal Fury fighting game series. If you don’t recognize that name either, nobody can blame you – the last Fatal Fury game came out 23 years ago, with Fatal Fury: Mark of the Wolves’ release in 1999. 
It’s unclear when we’ll hear more about this new Fatal Fury game, but it’s nice to know at least a game is in development for the classic fighting franchise.

                              <span>Obsidian, the first supported game of the mTropolis engine, is ready for public testing!
Created in 1996 by Rocket Science Games and published in early 1997, this ambitious 3D-rendered first-person adventure has you journey through 4 surreal, dream-like worlds in search of your lost colleague.
ScummVM currently supports the English and German versions.  It features a widescreen mode, improved cinematic quality, and a few bug fixes. A Japanese version also exists, but we need more information about it to support it. Please contact us if you have a copy of the Japanese version or some other language version that we haven&#x27;t discovered yet.
To play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. You can also download a demo here.  If you encounter any issues, please submit them to the issue tracker!

                              <span>Saturnalia is an upcoming indie survival horror with one of the most interesting visual styles I’ve seen in the genre in a minute. 
Developed by Italy-based studio Santa Ragione, Saturnalia is influenced heavily by the folklore of Sardinia, Italy, and inspired by Italian Giallo horror films (typically more horror-esque mystery thrillers). In it, you control four different characters, all connected through a mysterious storyline that ties back to the “haunting traditions” of an ancient village. 
“The village itself is an elaborate maze with no two iterations being precisely the same – you will have to explore and solve mysteries of the game largely unguided,” the game’s website reads. “Die, and watch the village reconfigure itself into a new form. Solve puzzles and open shortcuts to new areas with tools and items you find along the way, unlocking every piece of the story with different characters, each suited for another aspect of exploration and investigation.” 
All of that sounds great, but Saturnalia&#x27;s unique art style makes me most excited. It’s like a mix of stop-motion and sketchbook, which looks like it’ll lend itself nicely to the game&#x27;s horror elements. Check it out for yourself below:


Santa Ragione is the studio behind games like Fotonica, MirrorMoon EP, and Wheels of Aurelia. Saturnalia does not yet a launch date, but it will hit PC exclusively via the Epic Games Store sometime in 2022. The studio is planning to launch the game on other platforms, but the timing on that remains TBA.

                              <span>When Sonic Origins arrived on consoles and PC in June, it delivered a four-pack of classic Sonic the Hedgehog games from the &#x27;90s. While the bundle was praised for bringing Sonic 1, Sonic 2, Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles, and Sonic CD to modern platforms with various gameplay enhancements and other additions, it was also heavily criticized. Various bugs, mislabeled titles in the in-game museum, and overall stability (particularly with the PC version) frustrated the player base as they waited for Sega to fix the problems. This week, Sega released that long-awaited patch, addressing those problems and more, hopefully stabilizing the compilation and making the overall experience more enjoyable.
The two biggest items this patch addresses include fixing issues with the game crashing and one of the most annoying bugs of the year: Tails falling behind in Sonic 2 and constantly jumping instead of respawning on the player – we can finally turn off mute when playing Sonic 2. The patch also includes fixes for sound bugs, menu and controller issues, museum mislabels, and data-saving issues. Unfortunately, the replacement music in Ice Cap, Carnival Night, and Launch Base remain in place. 
The patch is available to download now for all platforms. Sonic Origins arrived on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC on June 23. For more on the speedy selection of games, check out our review here.</span>

                              <span>One of the most beloved fighting games of all time is finally getting the Arcade1Up treatment. Marvel vs. Capcom 2, the legendary crossover extravaganza from 2000, is the latest game featured by the replica arcade cabinet company. 
Marvel vs. Capcom 2 gathers 56 playable heroes and villains from both Marvel and Capcom&#x27;s robust catalogs of characters in an over-the-top 3v3 fighting game. In addition to giving you something approximating the original arcade experience through this replica cabinet, the Arcade1Up release also features online play via Wi-Fi. 
As it has done with most of its recent cabinets, Arcade1Up offers more than just the game on the marquee. You can see the full list of eight classic Marvel games included in this cabinet below.
Marvel vs. Capcom 2
Marvel vs. Capcom
Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter
X-Men vs. Street Fighter
Marvel Super Heroes
X-Men: Children of the Atom
X-Men: Mutant Apocalypse
Marvel Super Heroes in War of the Gems
Marvel vs. Capcom 2 has been largely unavailable since 2013, with home digital versions getting delisted or physical copies skyrocketing in price. Arcade1Up&#x27;s Marvel vs. Capcom 2 cabinet opens up for pre-orders starting September 8, with orders shipping a few weeks later in early October. The package includes a matching custom riser, light-up marquee, a headphone jack, and exclusive side-panel art. You can sign up to be notified of when pre-orders go live at Arcade1Up&#x27;s official page.</span>

                              <span>I love Final Fantasy. I’ve played nearly every numbered entry and have beaten most of them. I adore Final Fantasy Tactics. I watched both terrible feature films. My ringtone is the FFVII victory fanfare theme. But the biggest hole in my fandom for years has been Final Fantasy XIV.
MMOs have never appealed to me, but as I listened to friends and colleagues rave about FFXIV over its long existence, the more I felt like I was missing out on something special. Every expansion and free trial had me hovering over the purchase button, but I always told myself I didn’t have the time to invest in such a behemoth of a game. The excuses have come to an end. 
I’ve finally broken the seal and dived headfirst into one of the most celebrated games on the planet. Join me on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central as I trek through my first dungeon with the help of two of the biggest FFXIV experts I know. First up is the returning Jon Woodey, Game Informer web programmer extraordinaire. I’ll also have a special guest: MinnMax cohort Sarah Podzorski joins our party to lend her bubbly brand of insight. Watch along to learn some valuable tips and tricks and, if you’re like me, get an early taste of FFXIV to see if it’s something you want to jump into as well!

Discovery – then you know things have been bleak the past couple of days. 
The HBO Max film, Batgirl, a complete movie, has been canned alongside a sequel to 2020’s Scoob! There are rumors of massive layoffs at HBO Max to the tune of a 70% reduction in staff (thanks, The Wrap), as well as word that in-the-works projects like DC’s Supergirl movie will not be moving forward. Warner Bros. Discovery will roll HBO Max into Discovery&#x27;s streaming service, Discovery+, with less emphasis on premium scripted content fans of HBO Max have come to know and love, as reported by The Hollywood Reporter.

                              <span>Much in the same way Nintendo recently released its financial results for the first quarter of Fiscal Year 2023, which ends March 2023, Capcom has done the same. As a result, we now have an updated list of the best-selling Capcom games as of June 30, 2022, which is when the company’s latest financial quarter ended, as reported by MyNintendoNews. 
If you’re a Capcom fan, there’s likely no surprise as to which games are at the top, but there might be a few surprises for you in it elsewhere.
Here are the top 10 best-selling Capcom games: 
Monster Hunter World: 18.3 million 
Resident Evil 7: Biohazard: 11 million
Monster Hunter Rise: 10.3 million
Resident Evil 2: 9.8 million
Monster Hunter World: Iceborn: 9.5 million 
Resident Evil 5: 8.3 million
Resident Evil 6: 8.3 million
Street Fighter V: 6.6 million
Resident Evil Village: 6.4 million
Street Fighter II: 6.3 million
As you can see, this list is mostly Monster Hunter and Resident Evil, as anyone tuned into Capcom’s releases probably could have guessed. However, it&#x27;s important to note that Capcom, strangely, breaks each individual release up as its own game, meaning each of the multiple Resident Evil 4 re-releases counts as its own game. Collectively, though, Resident Evil 4 would be on this top 10 list. The same can be said for various other titles, such as Dragon&#x27;s Dogma and its re-release, and more. 
Now that you’ve seen this top 10 list, go check out the top 10 best-selling games on Switch and then read Game Informer’s review of Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak, the recent expansion for the game. After that, read about Capcom’s remake of Resident Evil 4, which is due out next March.

                              <span>PlayStation revealed that the long-rumored remake of The Last of Us was real in a leak hours before Naughty Dog could officially reveal it during Geoff Keighley’s Summer Game Fest, but alas, it’s real nonetheless.
Following in the steps of its sequel, The Last of Us Part II, the remake is called The Last of Us Part 1, and it’s beautiful. It will also cost $70, and some fans have criticized Naughty Dog and PlayStation for that price, citing that $70 is a high price tag for a game released on the PlayStation 3 before getting remastered for the PlayStation 4 a year later. It also appears to be very much the same game – just with improved graphics and some changes to AI systems and other under-the-hood things. Nonetheless, it’s out on Sept. 1 and will cost $70. 
Since the reveal, Naughty Dog has been slowly dolling out information about the upcoming title, including neat comparison videos that showcase how drastic the visual upgrades are. The studio released a new one this morning, this time comparing a sequence with Ellie and Joel riding horses on a road. Check it out for yourself below:

As you can see, the difference is night and day, with the remake looking a lot more like Part II. For more information, be sure to read our write-up about all the changes coming to The Last of Us Part I, and then read Game Informer’s original review of The Last of Us.

Wisdom from those who have tried opening a restaurant informs you that it isn’t the easiest way to make money. If Recipe for Disaster is any indication, running a successful eatery is a challenging, trial-and-error affair with plenty of stress and frustration, but one that, once mastered, offers excitement and gratification to balance it all out.

                              <span>Top-tier football league LaLiga and subscription TV platform Movistar Plus+ have won a joint lawsuit in Spain that allows them to block IPTV services until 2025 without needing permission from the courts. A second lawsuit won by Movistar Plus+ allows the TV platform to advise local ISPs of piracy-facilitating sites on a weekly basis and have them blocked within three hours.

                              <span>On this week&#x27;s episode of the Ultimate Audio Bang, we get all nostalgic as we pick our favourite FPS game modes over the years. It&#x27;s mainly an excuse for me for me to bring up Gears Of War and it&#x27;s long-forgotten Wingman mode, which I demand make a return to the series. I also learn that Hayden likes big games, big modes, and big comradery.

                              <span>I don&#x27;t think I like the game Descenders ostensibly is, but I enjoy playing. It&#x27;s a downhill mountain biking game with dangerous speeds and even more dangerous stunts, including leaping through a ring of fire over of a moving train. This is fun. The roguelikelike campaign structure this is all built into, eh, I don&#x27;t think it has added any enjoyment. But it is very fun to stack a double-backflip, slam into a rock, and watch your ragdoll corpse rocket downhill. It&#x27;s a good reminder to ride whichever way you enjoy, expectations and pressures be damned.

                              <span>My exposure to summer camps is entirely through films and games. Summer camp culture isn&#x27;t as much of a thing in the UK, possibly because we&#x27;re fairly happy to allow our children to learn to tie knots by themselves, by affixing each other to disused railway tracks or sick trees. In any case, the summer camps I&#x27;ve seen portrayed are usually unwholesome ones, because they&#x27;re good horror fodder. Camp Canyonwood is a camp counsellor sim, out now in early access, where you (an bird) look after a flock of demanding smaller birds. It sounds like it would be twee, except the owner is cutting corners and you dream about a talking jackalope. I have not explored these aspects much because I am constantly trying to feed the children.

Enter Saturnalia, &quot;a fever dream inspired in equal parts by authentic Sardinian culture and classic Italian giallo horror films&quot;. Announced a year ago and &quot;coming soon&quot; in 2022 to the Epic Games Store, this extremely unsettling slice of nope - but also yes - just got a new trailer. If Stanley Tucci visited this town on his quest to eat nice ravioli, his final piece to camera would be from inside an imminently-afire wicker effigy.

                              <span>Ooblets, the long-in-development indie title that blends monster collecting, farming, and dancing, has gone Gold. That means the game has completed certifications for release, signaling that its impending 1.0 launch is fast approaching. 
Developer Glumberland shared the news on Twitter, stating that they’ll announce the release date of the game’s full launch in the near future. Pre-orders for the recently announced Switch version will begin soon as well.
We just found out that Ooblets has gone 🌟GOLD🌟!!

Ooblets was first announced in 2016 and has been playable in PC early access and Xbox Game Preview since 2020. The farming sim game tasks players with planting and growing lovable creatures called Ooblets, who can then perform tasks and battle other Ooblets in dance battles. You can decorate and expand your farm, plus complete side quests from the many residents of Badge Town. Ooblets has received numerous content updates over the years, such as new creatures, locations, decor, and even seasons. Glumberland announced in May that the game would go 1.0 this summer, so today&#x27;s news seems to reaffirm that release window. 
We&#x27;ve enjoyed Ooblets whenever we&#x27;ve checked in on it over the years, so it&#x27;s exciting to see it approaching the finish line. Ooblets is slated to launch for Xbox One, Switch, and PC via The Epic Games Store.</span>

                              <span>Mega Man fans in the west got a surprise treat with the global launch of Mega Man Battle &amp; Fighters on Switch. The game was originally released for the Neo Geo Pocket Color and has never been released outside of Japan until now. 
The game was first released in 2000 and serves as a portable bundle of two arcade games: Mega Man: The Power Battle and Mega Man 2: The Power Fighters (both of which were recently included in the Capcom Arcade 2nd Stadium collection). Players can play as Mega Man, Proto Man, Bass, and Duo to engage in a series of boss battles against robot masters from Mega Man 1 through 7. A total of 40 bosses await, and players gain character data by defeating them with the added goal of filling a personal database. 


Despite launching stateside, this is a largely direct port of the Japanese version, and the game’s original link cable trading function has been disabled. You can pick it up now for $7.99.</span>

As a kid who grew up with little money, I’ve always loved the fantasy tycoon games realize: the possibility of cashing in on whimsical business schemes like theme parks, restaurants, and aquariums. It’s always been satisfying to start with an empty plot of land and then build the foundation of a business atop it, customizing small details like paint colors, furniture layouts, and walking paths along the way. 
But the genre’s bubble gum aesthetics often mask a darker side – one prioritizing profit over peopl…</span>

                              <span>Like Xbox and PlayStation, Nintendo also suffers from supply issues and component shortages. This might explain why a recent Nikkei report – relayed by Bloomberg&#x27;s game and tech writer, Takashi Mochizuki (see below) – stated that there wouldn&#x27;t be new hardware releases this fiscal year. 
Nikkei: there will be no new Nintendo hardware this fiscal year, which ends in March 2023. Not immediately clear whether that part of the article is from Nikkei&#x27;s own reporting or what Nintendo President, who Nikkei interviewed for the story, said. https://t.co/HJVqk9Kbef

Mochizuki&#x27;s tweet reads, &quot;There will be no new Nintendo hardware this fiscal year, which ends in March 2023. Not immediately clear whether that part of the article is from Nikkei&#x27;s own reporting or what Nintendo President, who Nikkei interviewed for the story, said.&quot;
For all the Nintendo fans speculating a Switch “Pro” release – sorry, it looks like that’s not happening any time soon. In any case, the Switch recently crossed 111 million units sold, but overall sales are down by 22.9%. Perhaps Nintendo will pivot to hardware announcements after the fiscal year comes to a close.</span>

                              <span>Square Enix has revealed Tactics Ogre: Reborn, a remaster of the classic Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together, and it’s releasing in just over three months. 
More specifically, it will hit PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC (via Steam) on Nov. 11. Square Enix revealed this heavily rumored (and leaked) remaster today with the first official trailer, and you can check it out for yourself below: 


As you can see, Tactics Ogre: Reborn now features voice acting, improved visuals, and more. Square Enix says, “Tactics Ogre: Reborn features updated game design, fully-voiced cutscenes, improved graphics, and sound.” Tactics Ogre: Reborn will be available as a physical and digital Standard Edition on PS5, PS4, and Switch and a digital-only Standard Edition on PC. A digital Premium Edition will be available for all platforms the game is coming to later this year. 
The digital Standard Edition includes a selection of three songs from the remaster’s soundtrack as a preorder bonus. The digital Premium Edition contains the entire soundtrack as a preorder bonus and a “Tactics Ogre (1995) Digital Mini Soundtrack.”

                              <span>The crossover brawler of our dreams, MultiVersus, is the fighting genre&#x27;s latest prize winner. From Adventure Time to Game of Thrones, Player First Games&#x27; debut title is a wacky fusion of legendary franchises that&#x27;s left fans enamored with the light-hearted art style and Super Smash-inspired gameplay. Sadly, the rising champ&#x27;s first season and next playable character, Morty (Rick &amp; Morty), have been pushed back. A finalized release date remains unknown.  
We want to let everyone know that we are delaying the start of Season 1 &amp; the release of Morty to a later date. We know this might be disappointing for some and want to assure our Community that we are dedicated to delivering new and exciting content that delights players. (2/3)
August 4, 2022
Tweets released by the MultiVersus dev team thank players for their continued support and patience while announcing the unexpected news (seen above). You can read the complete statement below:
Season 1 was initially slated to launch on August 9. For now, you&#x27;ll just have to keep busy kicking Lebron James&#x27; butt. John Carson previewed MultiVersus for us and concluded his findings by stating, &quot;I went into the alpha test of MultiVersus with low expectations. Besides Smash Bros., the big brand mash-up fighters feel hollow and feature underwhelming rosters, but I&#x27;ve come away impressed with what I&#x27;ve played so far. The cast is great so far, and each character brings unique gameplay and mechanics to the fray.&quot;

                              <span>Funcom and The Outsiders have announced a metal concert happening at this year&#x27;s Gamescom in Cologne, Germany to celebrate the impending release of their heavy metal rhythmic shooting game, Metal: Hellsinger. The concert, which takes place on August 25, hopes to become the largest concert ever put on at the massive annual gaming convention. 
Several of the vocalists featured in Metal: Hellsinger will be on hand to perform their songs from the soundtrack. Matt Heafy of Trivium, Alissa White-Gluz of Arch Enemy, Mikael Stanne of Dark Tranquility, Dennis Lyxzén of Refused and INVSN, and James Dorton of Black Crown Initiate are all currently scheduled to take the stage. The concert is set to kick off at 7 p.m. Central European Summer Time (1 p.m. Eastern/10 a.m. Pacific). The event is free and open to thousands of in-person attendees, with potentially millions being able to join through a livestream, which will be detailed at a later date. The first 200 people to enter the hall for the concert will receive a bag full of exclusive Metal: Hellsinger merchandise.


Metal: Hellsinger comes to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on September 15. If you want to try the game for yourself, a demo is currently available on all three of those platforms. If you&#x27;d rather read my hands-on impressions, you can do so here.</span>

As CJ reported last week, Frogwares now intend to close the circle by pitting hot Holmes against (hot?) Cthulhu creatures in a remake of 2007&#x27;s The Awakened. Its Kickstarter project launched today and there&#x27;s a reveal trailer below.

Seemingly not, if publisher Koch Media are any indication, as they announced today that they&#x27;ve changed their name to Plaion. At least the mispronunciations are now lower stakes.

One of the included bug fixes is that &quot;The &#x27;Ask to be Girlfriend/Boyfriend&#x27; Want now targets appropriate Sims&quot;, which sounds innocuous enough. In reality, this is fixing a bug Rebecca reported on last week which was causing Sims to want to date their siblings.

                              <span>Final Fantasy 14&#x27;s patch 6.2 will arrive in late August, and will bring with it the new Island Sanctuary.

This is the lowest price we&#x27;ve ever seen for this model, actually, even lower than it was during Prime Day, so it&#x27;s well worth picking this up if you&#x27;re after a high-speed drive for your PC or PS5.

If all had gone according to the original plan, they’d already be out and playable, but repeated delays have hit, leaving only one card – the low-end Arc A380 – having a muted launch in China only. As of early August, the full range of GPUs haven’t even been announced in an official capacity. These were meant to finally provide the competition to Nvidia and AMD’s best graphics cards, so where’s the deets?

Shenzhen is absolutely worth a go if you enjoy Zachlike puzzlers, and Turbo Golf looks like one of those &quot;could be fun, sure I&#x27;ll give it a try&quot; Game Pass games.

                              <span>Ice Code Games may have called it Hard West 2, but &#x27;round these parts we refer to it as &quot;The Laughing Deer Show&quot;. New to town, are ya? Let me clue you in. Laughing Deer is a six-foot man of raw muscle and rage, a native American warrior with shoulders like a pair of yoked oxen and a personality best described as &quot;barely contained&quot;. Unlike the rest of his posse, which includes a cowboy without a shadow, a woman with ties to the occult, and one very stubborn corpse, Laughing Deer doesn&#x27;t really &quot;do&quot; guns. While his compatriots are all crouched behind crates, ricocheting bullets off buckets and wheelbarrows to hit enemies from behind, Laughing Deer is getting in their faces (shortly before his club gets significantly further into their faces).
Now, bringing a club to a gunfight might not seem like the smartest idea. But while pistols require two of a gunslinger&#x27;s action points to shoot, and rifles take all three, it only takes one action point to whack some neckerchief-wearing bandit with a big ol&#x27; stick. And Laughing Deer whacks a whole point of damage harder than normal, meaning he can rush foes and nail them into the ground with a couple of hard swings before they can pull the trigger. Better yet, killing an enemy completely refills a character&#x27;s action points in Hard West, meaning that, when set up right, Laughing Deer can ping around the battlefield like a weaponised pinball.

Vantage hails from the icy world of Pagos, and her skills as a sharpshooter are borne out in her three powerful abilities - not least of which is her custom sniper rifle Ultimate, which she can bring out before the ability has even fully charged in order to snipe enemies and mark them for increased damage for her entire team.
Take a closer look at her dangerous-sounding abilities in the new Apex Legends vignette trailer below.

                              <span>I&#x27;m back from my holidays to record The Electronic Wireless Show podcast once again, and I&#x27;ve brought a reader email and a new tattoo of Murray from Monkey Island with me. These are both relevant, because the email from James suggests that we talk about the games that we&#x27;d like to play for the first time again - just erase them from our heads and encounter them anew. Thus, we discuss Lucasarts games like the Monkey Island series. See, I tied it all together.
In fact, I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;d wipe Monkey Island from my head or not, because I can&#x27;t be sure how much of my love for it is fuelled by nostalgia. Matthew has other concerns, though, because as is our usual fashion we spend some time discussing the question &quot;what games would you play for the first time again?&quot; more literally than is intended. What grave consequences would come from erasing certain things from your brain? What sort of person would co-host Nate be if he wiped the Civ games from his memory? Listen in to find out.

                              <span>Two Point Campus trades the operating rooms of its predecessor Two Point Hospital for lecture theatres and decrepit dorms. But its foundations remain the same: you&#x27;re a manager with a budget and you&#x27;ve got to turn the fortunes of increasingly prestigious – and in some cases, bonkers – institutions around. Of course, this time you&#x27;re not dealing with injured mummies and lazy surgeons, you&#x27;re in charge of running university campuses (campi?) and ensuring they deliver a solid education.
The job of a university president is a pretty relaxed affair, which means you&#x27;re able to soak in the joys of watching your oddball students grow. But this leniency means it struggles to reward you for constructing a campus that&#x27;s uniquely yours.

The mountain biking game is full of gnarly descents, dangerous jumps, and barely controlled skids, but also has secret spots where you can sit down and enjoy a nice view for as long as you like. Lonely Mountains is a collection of little adventures, each leading to your tent at the end of the day. Delightful.

                              <span>Charter Communications and several major record labels have settled their lawsuits over the ISP&#x27;s handling of repeat copyright infringers. The deal was signed around the same time that the ISP&#x27;s daughter company Bright House settled its case. No further details are available but with hundreds of millions of dollars in damages at stake, negotiations must have been tough.

                              <span>Since its first season launch in 2016, I’ve always felt like the Westworld TV series offered an especially compelling commentary on the video game hobby. Like a lot of sci-fi, the show leverages futuristic technology and far-fetched ideas to get its point across. But at its core, it’s still a show about the psychology of people playing a game and how that game is really just about life and the decisions we make that shape that life. Westworld may not borrow from a longstanding video game license. Still, with its incisive and often surprising perspectives, it has emerged as the best show about video games, their potential, and their threat that I’ve ever seen.
SPOILERS follow for the entirety of the Westworld TV series, up to and including current episodes of Season 4.

                              <span>Throughout 2022&#x27;s Pokémon Go Fest events in cities like Seattle, Berlin, and Sapporo, Ultra Beasts, wormhole-dwelling creatures introduced in Gen VII&#x27;s Pokémon Sun and Moon, have appeared for trainers to catch. If you weren&#x27;t able to attend those events (or the virtual event earlier this year), you&#x27;ve missed out on your opportunity to catch them to this point. However, that changes later this month, as the four Ultra Beasts are set to gather during the Pokémon Go Fest 2022: Finale event.
The finale is a global event that trainers can enjoy regardless of location. In addition to the Ultra Beasts, participating trainers will encounter other Pokémon they may not usually see in the wild, as well as the Mythical Pokémon Shaymin, who can be obtained by completing special research missions. This also features the conclusion of the story of Professor Willow being sucked into an Ultra Wormhole. The Ultra Beasts available in Pokémon Go through this event include Pheromosa, Nihilego, Buzzwole, and Xurkitree.
Finally, Daily Adventure Incenses have been added to the game. These special incenses can be used once a day and last for 15 minutes. This special daily item can attract Pokémon not typically found in your area and can even pull in Legendary Pokémon. 
Since the game&#x27;s launch in 2016, Pokémon Go has expanded well beyond the original 151 creatures. As of this writing, you can now catch, train, and battle more than 700 Pokémon throughout your travels. The Pokémon Go Fest 2022: Finale is set to happen on Saturday, August 27, from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. local time.</span>

                              <span>Nintendo released its latest round of financial results, this time for Quarter 1 of the 2023 Fiscal Year, which accounts for April, May, and June of 2022. In it, the company revealed that the Switch surpassed 111 million units sold but, despite that, overall sales are down. 
In terms of hardware, sales are down 22.9%, with Nintendo citing the ongoing semiconductor shortage as why. Software sales are down too, declining 8.6% this quarter. However, while 8.6% is a sizeable drop, Nintendo still moved 41.41 million units in Q1 FY23. It also revealed its top 10 best-selling Switch games, with many having seen increases since the last round of financial results earlier this year. 
Here are the top 10 best-selling Nintendo Switch games as of June 2022: 
Mario Kart 8 Deluxe: 46.82 million 
Animal Crossing: New Horizons: 39.38 million
Super Smash Bros. Ultimate: 28.82 million
The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild: 27.14 million
Pokemon Sword/Pokemon Shield: 24.50 million
Super Mario Odyssey: 23.93 million
Super Mario Party: 18.06 million
Pokemon Brilliant Diamond/Pokemon Shining Pearl: 14.79 million
Pokemon: Let&#x27;s Go, Pikachu!/Pokemon: Let&#x27;s Go, Eevee!: 14.66 million
Ring Fit Adventure: 14.54 million
Mario Kart 8 Deluxe had the biggest jump in this list, selling 1.48 million units this quarter. According to Nintendo, new 2022 releases are also selling well. Nintendo Switch Sports sold 4.84 million units, Mario Strikers: Battle League sold 1.91 million, and Kirby and the Forgotten Land sold 1.88 million units, making it the second-best selling Kirby game of all-time.

After that, feast your eyes upon all the new Pokemon from Scarlet and Violet revealed in today&#x27;s Pokemon Presents showcase.

                              <span>Amazon&#x27;s cloud-based gaming service, Luna, is the latest addition to the Samsung Gaming Hub, a recently added feature available on all 2022 Samsung smart TV and smart monitor models. Amazon Luna joins an ever-growing list of cloud-gaming services that already include the likes of Google Stadia, Xbox Cloud Gaming, Nvidia GeForce Now, and more in the Samsung Gaming Hub.
The hub, which was added to all 2022 models in late June, collects your various catalogs of cloud entitlements on one screen with no additional hardware required. That means if you own one game&#x27;s entitlement on Google Stadia but another&#x27;s rights on Amazon Luna, you can access them through the same hub without the need for any consoles. Not only that, but you can play these games using any supported Bluetooth controller.
Amazon Luna offers various subscription plans, with the top-tier subscription, Luna+, offering access to triple-A titles from publishers like Sega and Capcom as well as various independent titles. If you&#x27;re an Amazon Prime subscriber, you can access a rotating collection of titles. This month&#x27;s offerings include Control: Ultimate Edition, Myst, Steel Assault, and Garfield Kart. You can also add Ubisoft+ to your subscription for an additional cost to play games in franchises like Assassin&#x27;s Creed, Watch Dogs, Ghost Recon, and Far Cry. 
Through the addition of Amazon Luna to the library of cloud-gaming services, Samsung Gaming Hub now offers more than 1,000 games to choose from. I came away impressed from my time with the company&#x27;s new gaming initiative at Summer Game Fest this year. You can read my full impressions of my experience with the cloud-based gaming feature here.</span>

During today&#x27;s Pokémon Presents livestream, The Pokémon Company revealed a ton of new details surrounding the first fully open-world RPGs in the Pokémon franchise, Scarlet and Violet. During the extended trailer and subsequent deep dive, we received new info about the region in which the games take place, how multiplayer works, some of the Pokémon players will encounter during their adventure, and the new Terastal phenomenon that allows Pokémon to change.
In Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, players embark on an adventure in the Paldea region, a massive area full of lakes, mountains, wastelands, and more. Outside of its natural lands…</span>

As we get ready to embark on our Gen IX journeys in a few short months, The Pokémon Company and Game Freak released a new trailer showing off the region, some new Pokémon, and several of the characters we&#x27;ll be interacting with.
The Pokémon Company describes the Paldea region as &quot;a land of vast open spaces dotted with lakes, towering peaks, wastelands, and mountain ranges.&quot; Players can expect everything from small farming villages to bustling port towns.
You can see the full trailer from today&#x27;s livestream below:


Pokémon Scarlet and Violet come to Nintendo Switch on Nov. 18. For more on the upcoming Gen IX games, check out our full screenshot gallery of all the new Pokémon and everything we learned about the games today.</span>

                              <span>All Elite Wrestling’s first triple-A wrestling title, AEW: Fight Forever, takes a few significant steps towards becoming a reality. After heavy rumors, THQ Nordic is confirmed as the game’s publisher. Moreover, we got a rundown of the game’s modes, a batch of fresh screenshots, as well as the unveiling of the box art. 
AEW: Fight Forever is being developed by Yuke’s and has been billed as an homage to classic, arcade-style wrestling games such as WWF No Mercy (including input from director Hideyuki “Geta” Iwashita). In addition to capturing an old-school feel, the game hopes to emulate AEW&#x27;s in-ring style with the newly revealed addition of elaborate tandem offense moves for tag team bouts. 
First off, here’s what the box art looks like:

                              <span>Nintendo released its latest round of financial results, this time for Quarter 1 of the Fiscal Year 2023, which makes up the months of April, May, and June of 2022. While hardware sales of the base Switch, the OLED model, and the Switch Lite have surpassed 111 million units sold, sales are down nearly 23% overall. 
More specifically, hardware sales for Nintendo are down 22.9% this quarter. Broken up, the base Switch&#x27;s sales are down 60% in Q1 while Switch Lite sales are down 48.4%. Nintendo did not report OLED model Switch sales, possibly because it groups the OLED model with the base Switch. As for why hardware sales are down this quarter, Nintendo sites the ongoing semiconductor shortage, which affects other hardware makers like Xbox and PlayStation too.

                              <span>Puzzles are fun. Exploring floating islands is pretty boss too. That’s why open-world puzzle game Project S, announced at the end of the Behaviour Beyond stream today, has me raising an intrigued eyebrow as I lower my pipe to peer from behind a broadsheet newspaper. “I say, that looks rather like Breath Of The Wild, but with bits from The Witness and a faint hint of Myst,” I declare to Watson. “Astute observation, Wheeler,” he replies, “but why don’t you have a proper look at the trailer below?”

                              <span>4TB NVMe drives normally cost upwards of $400, but today you can pick up the new Crucial P3 for just $289.99 after a $60 discount at B&amp;H Photo. That&#x27;s incredible value, working out as just 7 cents per gigabyte, and marks a sea change in the affordability of NVMe SSDs. 
(By comparison, the same drive costs £348 in the UK - the equivalent of $423.)

It combines building futuristic fortresses with raiding them for life-giving genetic material, either solo or in two-player online co-op. Revealed during today’s Behaviour Beyond stream, Meet Your Maker is the next game from the devs behind survival horror Dead By Daylight. Check on how the post-apocalypse is faring in the trailer below.

                              <span>Even if you’re not “into” PC gaming hardware, spend enough time in its orbit and you’ll eventually develop a healthy scepticism for a specific type of electro-trickery. The kind that promises, naturally with the right purchases, to help you shoot better or drive cars faster or generally be a more PRO ELITE WINNER in competitive games.
For me, there have been two such technologies I’ve never really bought into: ultra-high 360Hz monitor refresh rates, and Nvidia Reflex, a kind of setup-wide latency reduction system. Now, having spent some quality time with the MSI Oculux NXG253R – which features both – I’ll cop to being wrong about one of them.

They all sounded terrible and we haven&#x27;t posted about them (also because a bunch of them aren&#x27;t on PC). AEW: Fight Forever, still officially Coming Soon, is their first crack at a sweaty graps sim to rival WWE&#x27;s series, and today it was confirmed the publisher is THQ Nordic. This not only means that we&#x27;ll see more gameplay at next week&#x27;s THQ Nordic showcase, per a tiny teaser, but it adds another horse to the confusing carousel of companies that have worked on wrestling sims.

I have a bunch of friends who persisted and now spend their weekends in gyms and car parks, where they skate under 11/10 names like Correctional Felicity and give each other huge bruises. I can&#x27;t be sure, but from their activity on social media I estimate they spend about 114% of their time being excited about roller derby, which I endorse. Now both they (and people like me, who find wheels frightening), can spend even more free time on roller derby with the annoucenment of 2023&#x27;s sports management game Roller Drama.

                              <span>It’s fair to say that Deck Nine had a lot to prove with Life Is Strange: True Colors. While it wasn’t their first Life Is Strange - the Colorado studio released the spin-off  game Before The Storm in 2017 - it was the first time they were tasked with creating their own world and characters, instead of inheriting Dontnod’s creations. 


Fortunately Deck Nine successfully managed the tightrope walk of honouring the series’ existing DNA, while still taking the Life Is Strange world in new directions. To find out more about how it was done, I sat down with Philip Lawrence and Sarah Van Rompeay, respectively the Senior Narrative Designer and Senior Producer at Square Enix External Studios.

You can read the full patch notes on Steam, but I’ll give you the highlights, which include a new warning that pops up when the Steam Deck’s temperature “goes outside the safe operating range”. When it starts throttling, in other words, a threshold that many Deck owners have been discovering during recent heatwaves. I have an overheating notification feature myself, only it’s just me typing “too hot” in the RPS Slack.

YouTube). Přímo HDR streamování pak funguje jen s YouTube HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) a formátem HEVC, OBS může pro zachytávání HDR streamu využívat hardware s podporou HDR (např. EVGA XR1 Pro, Elgato 4K60 Pro Mk.2, AverMedia Live Gamer 4K). S HDR však nefungují některé filtry (Apply LUT, Chroma Key, Color Key, Image Mask/Blend, Luma Key, Sharpness). HDR také bude funkční zatím jen na Windows, na macOS a Linuxu je podpora nehotová.</span>

                              <span>We spotted a rare discount on Lenovo&#x27;s brand new Legion 5i Pro 16 laptop, and it&#x27;s a high-end model with a 12th-gen Core i7 processor, RTX 3070 Ti graphics card and a stunning 16-in 2560x1600 165Hz display. Normally this laptop retails for £1500, but thanks to an Ebay code (AUG15) you can take £60 off. This isn&#x27;t a massive discount, but it&#x27;s a notable price reduction for a laptop that is literally brand new with the latest-gen tech inside.

                              <span>Right now a combination of a Box discount and an Ebay voucher code are making two MSI AiO liquid CPU coolers extremely cheap. The 360mm CoreLiquid 360R is down to £60 when you use code AUG15, while the CoreLiquid 280R is down to £52 using the same one. This is a massive reduction from their original prices and a frankly unbeatable deal for a liquid cooler with decent fans, RGB lighting and good thermal performance.

                              <span>With cancelled pre-order comes small discount. Isn’t that the motto of Spider-Man? Well, it’s close enough under the circumstances. Steam have recommended scrapping your pre-order of upcoming webslingathon Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered because the game was priced too high in some territories. The price drop only applies in a few regions, but means that anyone who pre-ordered the game there might want to cancel theirs and buy it again. Or, you know, just wait until the game’s out.

                              <span>With only a month or so to go until the anime spin-off of Cyberpunk 2077 hits screens, Netflix and CD Projekt have fired out a full trailer for Cyberpunk: Edgerunners. It has a little more background for the main characters, and introduces their cyborg posse. Watch the very edgy trailer below.

The ISP stood accused of turning a blind eye to pirating subscribers and faced millions of dollars in potential damages. The parties reached an agreement at the last minute as the trial was scheduled to start tomorrow.

                              <span>To reduce piracy on the Switch console, last week Nintendo used a DMCA notice to target a popular &#x27;sigpatch&#x27; repository on Github. While the coding platform ultimately took the repo down, it appears there was a difference of opinion over what type of infringement they represent. So what are &#x27;sigpatches&#x27;, why do they even need to exist, and why might they breach copyright law?

I was going to head in a different direction for my second deals post of the night, but when I spotted this deal on a great mid-range AMD graphics card I knew I had to double-dip on CCL&#x27;s excellent summer sale. 
The British retailer is offering the AMD RX 6700 for £299 when you use code AFF15, bringing a PowerColor Fighter OC model down to the lowest price we&#x27;ve seen for this class of card. The 6700 is a strong contender for 1080p and 1440p gaming, and this factory overclocked model ought to outperform other options in the field.

                              <span>RTX 3080 graphics cards are continuing their inevitable price decline, as at least one new next-gen GPU is rumoured to be announced within the next few months. That means it&#x27;s a good time to pick up current-gen models at a discount while availability is good - and this RTX 3080 12GB model is the cheapest we&#x27;ve ever seen it. 
Right now, you can pick up this Gainward Phantom RTX 3080 12GB for £724 when you use code AFF25 at the checkout at CCL. If you&#x27;re not familiar with CCL, the British retailer is a minnow compared to the whale of Amazon, but it&#x27;s one that has existed since 1996 and has always proved reliable for me.

I can&#x27;t keep pace with professionals so it&#x27;s fine if I run long, and today I want to take my time and enjoy the journey. I&#x27;m playing Aran&#x27;s Bike Trip, a visual novel/interactive diary/thingamy where Dutch indie dev Aran Koning (the designer of Stacklands) documents a two-day bike tour with 360° photos. It&#x27;s a lovely little adventure, taking in sights including an art deco radio station and the tallest waterfall in the Netherlands. The waterfall is... about what you might expect in a notoriously flat country.

                              <span>Microsoft have justified their $68.7 billion ($56 billion) purchase of Call Of Duty publisher Activision Blizzard by telling regulators that the company doesn’t produce “must have” games. If that’s making you ask why they’d stump up more than any other tech buyout in history for the privilege of owning a company that doesn’t have any killer apps in its stables, then you can line up right behind me, bosmang.

                              <span>Logitech have launched the Aurora Collection, a set of bright, customisable PC gaming peripherals built to be “gender inclusive”. Fortunately, that seems to be more than just pastel colours and cynical “For girls” marketing – the G375 headset, G705 mouse, and the G715 and G713 keyboards are all proper gaming-spec accessories, and they’ve been crafted by mostly female design and engineering teams based on feedback from women PC players.


The G705, then, is a wireless mouse designed for smaller hands, while the G375 headset – also wireless – is proportioned to fit smaller heads and has more space in the earcups to accommodate earrings. It’s safe to say I’m not the Aurora Collection’s target audience, but having used the G705, the G375, and the G715 wireless keyboard as my main peripherals for a few days, I can say all three are pretty swish playthings regardless of how you identify. What’s more, their light, soft-cornered aesthetic is a nice break from the blacks, greys and harsh angles that have become standard design language for gaming gear. Anyone who’s ever cringed their face inside out at a peripheral resembling Megatron’s running shoe may indeed find these more to their tastes.

The Season 14 update will drop in just over a week&#x27;s time, and as well as the customary new Legend - youthful sharpshooter Vantage - we&#x27;ll also be seeing lots of weapon updates, and some important changes to Apex&#x27;s oldest map, Kings Canyon.

Whatever the project is, ZA/UM’s reference to Shakespeare’s play Hamlet in the job listing certainly suggests they’ll stick with the keen intellect of their last RPG. If you’re not familiar with Disco Elysium’s blend of ideology and role-playing then watch Astrid’s (RPS in Peace) video below.

Nine newly supported games on 6 engines will plunge you into a variety of different settings. Are you able to escape from an alien-infested planet? What about challenging the Lord of the Dead in the Underworld? And have you ever explored the deepest depth of your psyche to see if you really know yourself?
Find out in one of the following titles:
Sanitarium
Hades Challenge
Marvel Comics Spider-Man: The Sinister Six
The 11th Hour

Besides adding new games, we are always focused on improving already supported games. Once again, we managed to squash quite a few bugs from various engines. It is always impressive to see bugs getting fixed in engines that are more than 20 years old!
One of the main new features of ScummVM 2.6.0 is a completely new way to view your games in an amazing icon grid overview via our launcher. Accompanied by some very shiny artwork provided by our graphics artists, you are now able to show off your collection like never before. It almost looks and feels like a virtual shelf!
Check out the full Release Notes for a comprehensive summary of how our developers managed to make ScummVM even more amazing!
You can find all of this goodness available for a number of platforms on our downloads page. If you are using Windows, macOS or the Ubuntu Snap package, the autoupdater will assist you in updating to ScummVM 2.6.0.
As always, thank you for your continuous support — happy adventuring!
