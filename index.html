                    <span>During an investor call earlier today, Strauss Zelnick, CEO of Take-Two Interactive (the parent company of Rockstar Games) listed off some of the publisher’s most popular and successful franchises.

Update : If you were wondering what happened to Platinum&#x27;s Sol Cresta broadcast that was scheduled to air on YouTube last weekend, it&#x27;s been postponed.
It&#x27;s apparently due to &quot;technical difficulties&quot; with streaming equipment and a new date for the broadcast will be organised soon. In the meantime, the company has reassured fans development of Sol Cresta is &quot;doing just fine&quot;.

Update : Techland has reached out to us to clarify just how long the game will take if you&#x27;re not attempting to 100% it.
A &quot;focused playthrough&quot; of Dying Light 2&#x27;s main story can be finished in &quot;about 20 hours&quot; - this will vary, depending on the player. To complete all side quests, learn the lore and engage with all the characters it could take a player 80 hours or more.

Sega&#x27;s taking great care with Sonic&#x27;s next mainline outing, Sonic Frontiers. Apart from making the tough decision to delay the release in order to &quot;brush up the quality&quot; of the title, it&#x27;s also been added in additional features to make the experience more accessible to everyone.
As part of this, Sonic&#x27;s new game will bolster its localisation offerings - with even more supported languages in both voiced and subtitle form. Here&#x27;s the full rundown, courtesy of the official Sonic the Hedgehog Twitter account. Note: * for Xbox and PC only.

The mod support for The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild over the past few years has been outstanding.
One thing we&#x27;re yet to see though is multiplayer support. As you might recall, someone last year offered $10k to anyone who could create a mod for BotW that made this happen. With this in mind, a modder by the name of Alex Mangue (in collaboration with Sweet and Ethi) recently uploaded some clips to show what they&#x27;ve been working on (thanks for the tip, @Swiftfeet16).

                    <span>What is it like compared to the Switch version?
Monster Hunter Rise was easily one of the best Nintendo Switch exclusives of 2021, and while Capcom won&#x27;t be slowing down its support for this version anytime soon, in a few days it&#x27;s releasing a PC port on Steam.
If you&#x27;re just a tad curious to know what the PC version of the game is like, we&#x27;ve rounded up a handful of critic reviews that compare this version to the Switch one. While there are some obvious improvements in the PC release in terms of resolution and performance, no cross-play support is definitely a letdown.

                    <span>Giant sprawling MMORPGs are a rarity these days compared to when it seemed like new options were available for players every week. Lost Ark has already had success in other regions, but the title will finally see a launch in North America next month after many years. In a nutshell, Lost Ark has a ton of features and mechanics that you’d expect in a traditional MMORPG like dungeons, raids, loot, crafting, home building, and more. So what’s the hook? It’s all tied together with stylish action combat, more akin to what you’d find in a modern ARPG like Diablo, Path of Exile, or Torchlight. Check out the trailer below to get a taste of what you can expect!

With various character classes to suit most traditional archetypes and years and years of content already online in other territories, Lost Ark has a blueprint for launching heavy and hard come February 11 on PC. We’ll have to see exactly what choices Amazon Games has made to many systems, especially monetization, but we won’t have long to wait. Are you looking forward to Lost Ark?

                    <span>Over the weekend, developer Techland made waves on social media by tweeting that its upcoming open-world zombie sequel, Dying Light 2: Stay Human, would take &quot;at least 500 hours&quot; to fully complete. While the studio likely thought this was good messaging to showcase just how much content is in its branching-narrative story, the announcement was met with some backlash amidst the excitement, as some players bemoaned the length and worried about bloat or that they would never see the end of such a massive adventure.
Later, as the studio saw some of the negative response, the Dying Light Twitter account clarified to one fan that you can complete the story and side-quests in 70 to 80 hours, &quot;if you&#x27;re not in a rush.&quot; Then, the official Twitter account took the messaging wide, saying that &quot;500 ho…</span>

                    <span>I’m old enough to remember when the first Yakuza game released on the PlayStation 2 in 2006 (2005 in Japan). That initial release was treated like a joke in the U.S. Yakuza was seen as a Japanese crime curio by some and an inferior Grand Theft Auto knock-off by others. But mostly, it was just ignored. 
Over the years, creator Toshihiro Nagoshi and Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio continued to churn out one Yakuza sequel after the other. I remember a small minority in the gaming community praised the series’ combat, humor, and storytelling, but the general public broadly waved off these games. However, slowly something started to change. With each new Yakuza, that vocal minority grew until they just couldn’t be ignored.

                    <span>Update, 2:50 p.m. EST, 1/10/21:
Following this past weekend’s reveal that doing every single thing in Dying Light 2 Stay Human will take 500 hours (and less than 100 hours to beat the story, complete all side quests, and explore the map), Techland has told Game Informer that the main story of Dying Light 2 can be completed in about 20 hours. 
“Completing all the side quests, learning about the world’s history, and engaging with all characters can easily take 80 hours or more, depending on playstyle,” Techland says. “Dying Light 2 takes place in a complex world filled with content and built both broadly and vertically.” 
For comparison, Techland says that in the original Dying Light, finishing the main story and all side quests took about 30 hours.

                    <span>Pokémon Legends: Arceus is scheduled to arrive on Nintendo Switch on January 28. That’s not far away at all. Will the formula shake-up from the standard treatment prove to be a success? While that remains to be seen, a trailer unveiled today gives prospective players a taste of some of the experiences they can expect to see in the latest Pokémon entry. While it’s been already relayed that the game won’t be a “true” open world, it looks like the colorful little critters do roam free in various areas. Check out the full trailer below.

An action slant and style for the game seems to add quite a few new elements for players to engage with, while still maintaining the classic core of Pokémon. Based on the new trailer, it looks like crafting will be quite important as a mechanic, so that particular aspect is intriguing to me. Also, you can fly on a bird, which makes me wonder if the rest of the traditional HM abilities will be represented with heavy action and mobility. I’d say there’s a pretty good chance, especially since it looks like you can also surf around in the water on your favorite Gyrados.

PlayStation released the full list of top downloads on the PlayStation Network in December today, and as usual, it gives us a great look at what players were interested in last month. While Among Us took the top spot on both PS4 and PS5 in the U.S., Canada, and EU, a big movie release helped push an older title into the number two spot.

                    <span>Netflix is developing a &quot;Scott Pilgrim&quot; anime with creator and graphic novel artist Bryan Lee O’Malley. 
This news comes by way of The Hollywood Reporter, which reports that O’Malley will also write and executive produce the series based on his cult-classic graphic novel series (and subsequent film). Netflix is developing the adaptation with UPC, the group behind Netflix’s The Umbrella Academy and SyFy’s Chucky TV series.

O’Malley is writing and and executive producing this Scott Pilgrim anime alongside the showrunner for Nickelodeon’s Are You Afraid of the Dark? series, Ben David Grabinski. However, it’s important to note that a series order has not been made, so the anime isn’t entirely off the ground just yet – it’s simply in the works for now. If it’s picked up for a full series order, O’Malley and Grabinski will serve as the showrunners. 
As far as animation goes, it’s being handled by anime studio Science Saru (Devilman Crybaby, Star Wars Visions). Saru’s Eunyoung Choi will be a producer for Scott Pilgrim and the company’s Abel Gongora will direct the series. The Hollywood Reporter writes that the members of the Sex Bob-omb are set to be featured in the anime, with Scott Pilgrim movie director Edgar Wright and producing partner Nira Park also working as executive producers on the series alongside and Adam Seigel, Jared LeBoff, Marc Platt, and Michael Bacall.  
&quot;Scott Pilgrim&quot; was published as six volumes between 2004 and 2010 and Wright’s movie based on those volumes, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, was released in 2010 with Michael Cera playing the titular character. There’s no word if any of the cast members from that film are returning for the anime. 
While waiting for the anime, read about why Scott Pilgrim vs. The World: The Game is still one of the best 2D brawlers out there.

                    <span>The Riddler is an infamous Batman villain and one of the smartest in the world&#x27;s greatest detective&#x27;s rogues gallery. Having been around for decades, first appearing in Detective Comics #140 back in 1948, the character has been through countless iterations. 
There’s the green tights version the world first met in 1948 and that slowly evolved into a green suit with purple accents. We also got more on-the-nose versions with some Riddler iterations dawning a costume covered in question marks and sometimes carrying a question mark cane.
Frank Gorshin’s Riddler from the 1960s Adam West Batman series (and movie) played with both the green suit look and the green tights look. Then, we saw Jim Carrey step into those tights in 1995’s Batman Forever and that was the last silver screen appearance of …</span>

                    <span>Elden Ring is seemingly the hype train that just won’t stop and with less than two months to go until release, it is now officially Steam’s most anticipated title. 
That’s because From Software’s upcoming action RPG is now the most wishlisted game on Steam. It’s an impressive feat for Elden Ring as Techland’s highly-anticipated sequel to 2015’s Dying Light held that spot for 12 months, as reported by Eurogamer. Steam’s “Top Wishlists” page is a great indicator for Steam player hype, but unfortunately, it does not reveal any specific numbers.

However, someone wishlisting a game does not automatically translate to a purchase so if there were numbers, it wouldn’t necessarily be indicative of how much Elden Ring is going to sell on Steam. It’s a great indicator for general excitement around the title, though, and considering Dying Light 2 held the top spot for a year (after taking it from Cyberpunk 2077), Elden Ring is sitting pretty. 
For context, here’s what the top 10 on Steam’s “Top Wishlists” page looks like right now: 
Elden Ring
Dying Light 2 Stay Human
Party Animals
God of War (2018)
Hollow Knight: Silksong
The Day Before
Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2
S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chernobyl
Starfield
Frostpunk 2
As you can see, Elden Ring is sitting above some very exciting releases such as Starfield, the PC version of God of War, and the sequel to indie darling Hollow Knight, Hollow Knight: Silksong. Hopefully, Elden Ring delivers on all the hype it’s garnered so far. One Game Informer editor who previewed the game seems to think so.

                    <span>Take-Two Interactive, the company behind the Grand Theft Auto series, announced that it is buying all outstanding shares of Zynga for $12.7 billion. 
The publisher giant announced the news this morning with a press release that says Take-Two spent $9.86 a share to acquire Zynga, which is perhaps most famous for titles like FarmVille, Words With Friends, and the upcoming Star Wars: Hunters. Bringing Zynga under the Take-Two umbrella immediately makes Take-Two one of the largest publishers of mobile games in the world, which the press release says is “the fastest-growing segment of the interactive entertainment industry.”

It&#x27;s not the first time that Zelda&#x27;s Hyrule Castle has made it to the final stage of LEGO&#x27;s fan-created and crowdsourced IDEAS platform, and it certainly won&#x27;t be the last — anything to do with Nintendo usually gets summarily dismissed, after all.
But this latest Hyrule Castle design, based on Breath of the Wild, includes Calamity Ganon, Koroks, Bokoblins, Guardians, the Hylian Shield and Link&#x27;s sailcloth glider, so surely all those details will convince LEGO and/or Nintendo to put it into production this time?

There have been few sightings of Arceus in the Pokémon Legends trailers, despite his name being on the game itself. Mostly, he pops up at the end to remind you that he&#x27;s there, and he&#x27;s going to beat you up.
Nevertheless, Arceus is the face (and body) of Pokémon Legends: Arceus on Twitter, as Nintendo have secured some fancy hashtag emojis featuring the spiky boy.

It&#x27;s just a couple of weeks until the release of Pokémon Legends: Arceus, and still we know relatively little about the game — we know it will take place in the past, in the new/old Hisuian region, with new/old variants and evolutions of existing Pokémon. We know there will also be crafting, as players will have to invent and then create their own Poké Balls from materials foraged in the wild.

Optimism is a wonderful state of mind, especially if it&#x27;s rewarded. Around all of the recent renewed talk about Mario Kart 9 being in &#x27;active development&#x27; we&#x27;ve definitely succumbed to giddy positivity about its prospects, and with some very good reasons. Nintendo rarely has so much time to work on a major sequel to a once-a-console-generation series, a circumstance gifted to the company by the best-selling game on Switch.

                    <span>A record-breaking acquisition.
Take-Two Interactive Software is acquiring Zynga in a $12.7 billion deal, the two companies confirmed on Monday, 10th January. That colossal sum includes Take-Two paying $9.86 per share, plus Zynga&#x27;s debt, in order for the company to make moves into the mobile market.
This deal is now the largest sum of money paid out for an acquisition in video game industry history, surpassing Microsoft&#x27;s 2020 acquisition of Bethesda for $7.5b, and Tencent&#x27;s 2016 acquisition of Clash of Clans studio Supercell for $8.6b. Activision Blizzard had a similar deal in 2015 when they bought Candy Crush developer King for $5.9 billion.

While this may not be a huge shock to anyone (that&#x27;s Fortnite&#x27;s whole thing, after all), it&#x27;s all down to a deal between Epic and Paramount, the latter of which owns a ton of properties.

It&#x27;ll be launching digitally on 21st January, with a physical edition also arriving in Asia on the 26th. Pre-orders for the digital edition are going live on the Switch eShop today, where you&#x27;ll be able to grab a copy at 10% off its usual $19.99 price for a limited time.

The Singapore Tour kicks off this week (11th January at 10pm PT / 12th January 7am CET) and also introduces Vacation Luigi. Here&#x27;s the new trailer:

The last two years have been rather strange in various ways, with game expos being a particular casualty in the game industry. The norm previously was for a number of expos throughout the year packed with big crowds of gamers, media and stressed game developers; the loss of these events has had a significant impact on various parts of the video game business. However, for many of us at home in the past these shows have always taken the form of online conference streams and showcases, so the recent trends of cancelled in-person events haven&#x27;t necessarily changed a great deal in how we relate to E3, for example.

                    <span>The eShop&#x27;s biggest games.
Nintendo has shared an updated list of Europe&#x27;s most-downloaded Switch eShop games, revealing which titles were the most popular during December 2021.
Perhaps a result of families getting together over the holidays, Mario Party Superstars has claimed the number one spot for the month. There&#x27;s nothing like a good old argument over who&#x27;s stealing whose stars and who punched who during that last minigame after Christmas dinner, huh?

Nintendo has updated its Nintendo Switch maintenance schedule, detailing several spots of service maintenance set to take place over the next couple of days. While you&#x27;re unlikely to face any severe issues, it might be worth keeping the following times in mind.
Four sessions are planned in total for this week, with some relating to the transfer of save data and user data. Nintendo warns that &quot;during the maintenance window, network services may be unavailable.&quot; We have all the times you need below:

                    <span>Five Switch exclusives make the top ten.
UK physical chart data is now in for the week ending 8th January, revealing that Mario Kart 8 Deluxe has remained on top for a second week in a row.
The news means that, despite the game launching way back in 2017, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe has so far been top of the charts in the UK for the entirety of 2022 so far (yes, we&#x27;re aware it&#x27;s only been ten days). The streak will no doubt come to an end at some point, but it&#x27;s impressive to see that Switch&#x27;s best-selling game is still doing the business after all this time.

                    <span>These days, you can&#x27;t shake a stick without bouncing brown beams around the room. Raytracing has been a hot high-end graphics trend for a few years, with new games boasting support for the complex lighting simulators and old games being retrofitted with shine. This year, a new Half-Life mod will add raytracing support to Valve&#x27;s seminal shooter, and even as someone usually perfectly happy with old games looking old, I think it doesn&#x27;t look half-bad. See for yourself in the new video, below.

                    <span>As we’ve already seen from the demo, the PC version of Monster Hunter Rise spruces itself up considerably from the Nintendo Switch original. It’s not a match for Monster Hunter World on overall visual fidelity and detail, but the upside is that it’s easy to go a-huntin’ at high frame rates even if you’re on low end hardware. To whit, Monster Hunter Rise’s PC requirements go even lower than World’s, only asking for a GT 1030 or Radeon RX 550 at minimum.

                    <span>After the roaring success of Monster Hunter: World back in 2018, the idea that the next big PC entry in Capcom&#x27;s dino pants craft &#x27;em up is a game that originally started life on the Nintendo Switch is bound to ruffle a few feathers. But far from being a step down from World, Monster Hunter Rise is every bit its equal - and Capcom&#x27;s stellar work with this PC port has given it a much-needed buff and polish to really make it shine. Not only does Rise offer the same seamless and expansive environments as World, but it also adds a few new twists to make tracking down its titular titans even more enjoyable.

                    <span>Zynga, the company whose games made being Facebook friends with your family even more annoying, are selling to Take-Two. The owners of Rockstar and 2K plan to buy up Zynga shares in a deal that&#x27;ll value the company at $12.7 billion (£9.4b). Take-Two hope to use Zynga&#x27;s social and mobile expertise to make more games based on their games. Sure sure, #business and all, but I&#x27;d rather spend that much money on 9.8 billion Greggs sausage rolls instead of Grand Theft Autoville or something.

                    <span>One of the presents I got for Christmas this year was a copy of PS5 exclusive Spider-Man: Miles Morales. I had about a week where I was completely by myself this year, and I spent it being Spidey and self-yeeting around New York. It&#x27;s a great game on many levels, and I especially liked that one of the outfits you can unlock through story missions is a scarf and ear warmers. Mostly though, it&#x27;s just made me think that web-swinging is the most fun way to get around in games, and more games should do it. By &quot;more games&quot;, I mean &quot;every game&quot;.

                    <span>I briefly posted before the new year about WorldBox - God Simulator, and Graham wrote about it over the weekend, too. It is a world simulation game that has no resource costs or goals, just simulated events. You make a world, plop some animals and fantasy races into it (and if you want, a bunch of dragons and wizards) and see what happens. I cannot stop playing it. And I wanted to give some more detailed examples of how the simulation works, especially if you just leave it running with little intervention.
I am a WorldBox scientist, you see (though merely a BSc at the moment), and my first experiments suggest that every civilisation, along a long enough time scale, is basically doomed. Big 2022 energy. In the case of WorldBox, this may be because at some stage the scientist running the experiment will get bored and drop in e.g. a tornado. That&#x27;s okay, because there are almost infinite experiments to run. I hope that isn&#x27;t how the simulation I am living in is being run. Oh no. Don&#x27;t think about it.

                    <span>Techland have achieved something incredible. With a single Dying Light 2 marketing Tweet, they caused the greatest mass exhalation seen, perhaps, ever. Thousands of adults were informed that to &quot;fully complete Dying 2: Stay Human, you&#x27;ll need at least 500 hours&quot; and collectively sighed at their desks, heads in hands. Even some hurried backtracking from Techland&#x27;s marketing team couldn&#x27;t save us from exhaustion.

                    <span>Nová verze 6.2 operačního systému DragonFlyBSD přináší tři klíčové novinky. Tou pro desktopy nejpodstatnější je zahrnutí ovladače AMDGPU, tedy konečně moderního ovladače pro Radeony mnoha posledních generací, který v DragonFlyBSD chyběl. Prozatím to má ještě jednu mušku, systém zde zakládá na verzi z Linuxu 4.19, tedy nezahrnuje nejnovější možný ovladač AMDGPU se všemi architektonickými optimalizacemi. Doplňme ještě, že vážčí BSD nově podporuje také GPU Gen9 u procesorů Intel Whiskey Lake.</span>

                    <span>Who needs Gordon Freeman aka the main protagonist of the original Half-Life game released back in 1998? The dude is boring. It’s time to move on to someone new. Someone like Spyro, that purple dragon from the Spyro The Dragon franchise. And thankfully, a new mod swaps the old Gordon for the (similarly old) Spyro,…

                    <span>&quot;there&#x27;s no noticeable burn-in&quot;.
When it was revealed Nintendo&#x27;s latest hardware revision for the Switch would feature an OLED screen, concerns were immediately raised about the possibility of screen burn-in.
Although this type of display has come quite far since the days of the PlayStation Vita, the risk of burn-in is still a thing. Fortunately, since the launch of the Switch OLED model, we haven&#x27;t really heard about any horror stories, so is it actually something to be concerned about?

                    <span>Is an all-star Nintendo cast the &quot;new twist&quot;?
Don&#x27;t get us wrong, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is an amazing game and arguably the best entry in the series to date, but it&#x27;s an enhanced port of a 2014 Wii U title - meaning we&#x27;ve technically been playing the same game for a very long time now.
Fortunately, Nintendo might finally be readying itself to reveal a new entry - with claims from industry analyst Dr. Serkan Toto earlier this week that &quot;Mario Kart 9&quot; is now in &quot;active development&quot;, and could be teased at some point in 2022. As usual, the latest game is expected to come with a &quot;new twist&quot; and that last part is what&#x27;s sent the internet and social media into overdrive.

                    <span>After tackling Metroid in Season 1, the second season of Game Informer&#x27;s Video Gameography podcast moves on to one of the biggest shooter franchises in existence: Halo. This week, we examine Bungie&#x27;s smaller experimental entry in the series, Halo 3: ODST.
Halo 3: ODST was released on the Xbox 360 on September 22, 2009, and was intended to be a smaller project designed by a skunkworks team. However, the development of ODST has roots in Peter Jackson&#x27;s aborted attempt to make a Halo film/game. For the next hour, we talk about ODST&#x27;s relatively short development time, why the title changed from Halo 3: Recon, the innovative Firefight multiplayer mode, and Bungie&#x27;s push to spin out from under Microsoft and become its own company again.
Join hosts Ben Reeves (@BenjaminReeves) and Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), and former Game Informer editor Bryan Vore (@Bryan_Vore) as we unpack the history and impact of the first Halo game to not feature Master Chief.  And for more Halo, be sure to check out our definitive ranking of every Halo game.

                    <span>Every year a glut of video game releases hit the market, making it hard to keep track of everything. RPG fans had a pretty good 2021, from fantastic indies to new games in popular franchises. Bandai Namco gave us two stellar RPGs in Tales of Arise and Scarlet Nexus. Remakes and remasters, like Nier: Replicant, Mass Effect Legendary Edition, and Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, provided plenty of nostalgia, while also bringing new fans into the fold. Longawaited entries finally debuted with Shin Megami Tensei V and Neo: The World Ends With You. And that’s only scratching the surface. Here are five RPGs worth your time that may have slipped past your radar.

                    <span>What may end up being one of the greatest Linux kernel features of 2022 is the recently published &quot;Fast Kernel Headers&quot; effort for cleaning up the kernel headers and dramatically speeding up Linux kernel builds both for absolute/clean and incremental builds. Fast Kernel Headers can cut the Linux kernel build time in half or greater and out this weekend are the v2 patches...</span>

                    <span>To me, Mass Effect ends about six hours into Mass Effect 1, when I get bored and wander off to play something else. I&#x27;ve had ears and eyes long enough to know that people were upset about the ending of Mass Effect 3 however, even after BioWare tweaked it. The original Mass Effect 3 had various &quot;Happy Ending Mods&quot; to change the close of Commander Shepard&#x27;s story, and now Mass Effect Legendary Edition does, too.

True or not, it&#x27;s definitely happening this week, beginning tomorrow, Sunday January 9th, and running through until Sunday January 16th. This time, the charity speedrunning marathon features several recent games including Deathloop and Death&#x27;s Door, among many others.

                    <span>Developers have good taste in games. That&#x27;s the take away from each year&#x27;s Independent Games Festival Awards, which consistently selects shortlists of excellent games. The nominations for 2022 are up, and the contenders for this year&#x27;s Seumas McNally Grand Prize includes Unpacking, Inscryption, Loop Hero, Cruelty Squad, The Eternal Cylinder and Unsighted. Sounds about right.

I look forward to swimming in sight of some snowy hills today then hiking through some snowy hills tomorrow, then returning to my cosy flat. But what are you playing this weekend?

                    <span>Earlier this year, Atlus announced that it wants “to create a 6 which exceeds 5.” I can only speak for myself, but that’s a hard bar to rise above. Persona 5 (and its Royal expansion) is easily one of my favorite games of all time. The limited details surrounding the next game’s narrative, combat, and music have forced superfans like me to make their own wishlists. So, here are six – that’s right, six! – features I’d like to see in Persona 6:
  



      
												
All-Adult Cast
Look, I love Persona’s tried and true narrative DNA – a crew of teenage outcasts call upon their mystical alter egos to defend the world from evil forces while also juggling hobbies, romance, and classes. Nevertheless, I’m ready for Atlus to bring the series’ mature themes to the adult world.

                    <span>For a while in the late 2000s, developers at Rockstar New England thought they were working on the next big Rockstar game.
They were excited to push the company’s tech and to bring a cult hit into Rockstar’s vision for the future. They were excited for the chance to prove themselves as a Rockstar studio, having recently been purchased by the company. They were excited to lead development on Bully 2, the sequel to Rockstar’s critically acclaimed open-world adventure about life in a private school.
But things don’t always go as planned, and other obligations on a release schedule get in the way of passion projects. Rockstar New England’s Bully 2 was shelved in favor of other, more troubled projects in development, like Max Payne 3 and Red Dead Redemption.

That is, if you can get your hands on them, err, feet in them. Converse’s Pokémon collection went live today and it features 22 different things to buy ranging from adult shoes to children’s shoes to shirts, hats, and more. And to be honest, all of it looks great.
Right now, a quick stroll through the collection page will reveal that the Converse x Pokémon First Partners Chuck Taylor All-Star shoes, Converse x Pokémon Poké Ball Chuck Taylor All Star shoes, and the Converse x Pokémon Pikachu Chuck Taylor All Star Easy-On shoes are sold out. 
The Converse x Pokémon Pikachu Crewneck T-Shirt, Converse x Pokémon Team Long Sleeve T-Shirt, and Converse x Pokémon Patch Long Sleeve T-Shirt are sold out as well. However, there’s still plenty of stylish Converse x Pokémon merch up on the site available to buy. Here’s a look at some of the shoes you can purchase:

                    <span>The King of Fighters XV is coming close to having a complete roster, with the frosty fighter Kula Diamond becoming the 38th member. 
Kula and her ice-centric moves were revealed in a new trailer this week. Formerly a member of Team K&#x27; in past King of Fighters installments, she&#x27;s joined the tournament with newcomer Krohnen (who&#x27;s mechanically a callback to the popular Akira-inspired KOF character K9999) and Ángel, a former NESTS assassin with a pro wrestling move set.

It would have been quite the shock if a fan-favorite face like Kula didn&#x27;t make the main roster of KOFXV, but since she&#x27;s the 38th character revealed from a confirmed roster of 39, other mainstays like Taekwondo practitioner Kim may have to wait for DLC or miss out entirely. There are rumors as to who the final character will end up being, but what we do know is there&#x27;s only one spot on a team open, and it&#x27;s alongside Ash Crimson and Kukri. 
The King of Fighters XV is scheduled for release on February 17 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Those who preorder it digitally can start fighting a few days sooner with an early access period that begins on February 14.</span>

                    <span>South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone revealed last August that a new South Park game is in the works alongside “several spinoff movies” and more, and now, we know what studio is developing that title. 
Revealed on a Careers web page, Question Games, the team behind The Magic Circle and The Blackout Club, is working on a new South Park game and a job listing might hint at multiplayer. The listing also reveals that the game will be developed in Unreal Engine with an aim to release on “modern systems” such as PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

“Question and South Park Digital Studios are seeking a Lead Level Designer for work on a new video game set in the world of South Park,” the Lead Level Designer job listing on Question Games’ Careers page reads. 
The requirements section of this listing reveals that multiplayer experience is a must for anyone who applies, which could hint that this South Park game could feature some kind of multiplayer. This would be especially interesting because both South Park: The Stick of Truth and South Park: The Fractured But Whole were single-player. 
“Multiplayer Experience – Shipped at least one multiplayer game as a senior level designer or have equivalent relevant experience,” the requirements for the Lead Level Designer position read.

You can check out the full Careers page here, but there’s not much else to gleam from the listings. Whether or not this South Park game resembles the last two released or is something totally different, only time will tell. For now, read Game Informer’s South Park: The Stick of Truth review and then check out Game Informer’s South Park: The Fractured But Whole review.

                    <span>A not-so-long time ago in the same galaxy we all reside in, Respawn Entertainment deviated from its first-person shooter roots to create Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. This third-person action game was the studio’s first stab at tackling the coveted Star Wars license, crafting an original adventure set five years after Revenge of the Sith. It stars Cal Kestis, a padawan turned junker (played by Shameless star Cameron Monaghan) that managed to evade the Jedi purge of Order 66. After he’s outed by the Sith, he embarks on a quest to recover an artifact capable of locating force-sensitive children while also avoiding capture by the Inquisitors, who are elite Jedi hunters. 
The game features a blend of lightsaber combat and a suite of Force abilities. Borrowing inspiration from FromSoftware’s Soul series, encounters are challenging, requiring a strategic blend of blocks and parries to outduel opponents. Meanwhile, the various planets take on a Metroid-inspired progression with players unlocking abilities to backtrack to previously inaccessible areas.

Fallen Order was released November 15, 2019, and was a critical and financial success. It also served as a saving grace for single-player fans, providing proof to an increasingly multiplayer-focused EA that linear story-driven experiences can still make the big bucks. With a sequel reportedly in the works, we’re revisiting this gem of the Star Wars video game pantheon. 
Join Marcus Stewart, Daniel Tack, and Andrew Reiner on Twitch today at 2 p.m. Central as we journey through the entirety of Cal Kestis’ adventure. Expect plenty of laughs, deaths, and general nerding out over all things Star Wars. We encourage you to hang out with us in chat.

                    <span>Update, 1/7/21:
Yesterday, Game Informer reported that Days Gone director Jeff Ross said Bend Studio&#x27;s latest game sold more than Ghost of Tsushima, which recently hit a milestone after selling 8 million copies. However, in a recent livestream with former God of War and Twisted Metal director David Jaffe, Ross revealed that his source for the sales numbers was a now-defunct website called Gamestat, which tracks PlayStation Trophy data, as reported by PushSquare. 
Here&#x27;s what Ross said: &quot;Where I got my data from, I had access to a lot of telemetry, and I could see stuff and when we were at 5 million copies – when we were announced at 5 million copies – the telemetry data was at 5.8 [million]. There are basically resells or shared discs. I was actually using an external website – I think the…</span>

                    <span>The cleverly named Pupperazzi, a cute game about taking snapshots of doggos that appeared during last August’s ID@Xbox Showcase, has a release date. Best of all, it’s coming in just a couple of weeks – January 20 to be exact.
Does the idea of Pokémon Snap but with dogs appeal to you? Pupperazzi has you covered. Armed with your trusty camera, you’ll capture a variety of dog breeds in a world seemingly populated with nothing but canines. You’ll catch them doing all manner of strange things, like jamming to music, riding bicycles (somehow), or executing death-defying skateboard tricks.

                    <span>Former Bend Studio director Jeff Ross revealed earlier this week that Days Gone sold more than Ghost of Tsushima, but was not praised like it and instead seen as a disappointment by Sony and PlayStation. Discussing that with former God of War and Twisted Metal director David Jaffe on a recent livestream, Ross also revealed some other pitches Bend Studio made after a sequel to Days Gone was rejected. 
As first reported by Video Games Chronicle, Ross said he was especially interested in rebooting PlayStation’s long-dormant Resistance series, which was created by Insomniac Games back in the PlayStation 3 generation. Like the pitch to Days Gone 2, though, it was rejected.

“The pitch I was making was, &#x27;open-world Resistance would be f**king rad,&#x27;” Ross told…</span>

                    <span>Look, I’m not going to lie – when Kilter Films, Bethesda Game Studios, and Amazon announced back in 2020 that a Fallout TV series was in the works, I immediately wrote it off. Surely it’d be another video game TV project that would stumble through development until it’s quietly canceled, only for the world to collectively ask years later, “Hey, what happened to that Fallout show?” That’s what video game movies and TV developments have done to me. In this instance, though, it appears I’m wrong because production is moving forward and the show now has a director. 
Those familiar with HBO’s Westworld series might recognize him, too, as it’s the same person who created and executive produced that series: Jonathan Nolan, the brother of famed director Christopher Nolan (The Dark Night, Inception…</span>

                    <span>Pokémon Legends: Arceus is right around the corner, hitting Switch on January 28, and Nintendo has been slowly revving up its marketing for the upcoming hub-based RPG. That continued today with a new six-minute trailer released on the Japanese Nintendo YouTube account and while the entire video is in Japanese, it still gives us a great look at what’s in store for us in the Hisui region. 
Namely, the locations, pocket monsters, and NPCs we’ll be encountering. It also gives us our best look at the HUD and menu screens in Pokémon Legends: Arceus thus far as well. If you’ve been following this game since its announcement, you’ll notice that the game is looking much better than when it was first shown, too.

Pokémon Legends: Arceus has been described by Nintendo as an open-hub game, akin to the Monster Hunter series, rather than an open-world one and while that’s still the case, this trailer reveals these hubs are actually quite large – big enough to make flying around on a Pokémon or riding on the back of one in water very viable. 
The entire trailer is exciting and it offers us our best look at Pokémon Legends: Arceus yet so if you’re excited for this upcoming RPG, it’s definitely worth six minutes of your time. 
For more, be sure to check out this trailer released last month that introduces the Diamond and Pearl clans to the game and then read about how Hisuian Voltorb still somehow looks like a Pokéball. Check out this reveal of the Hisuian forms for Zorua and Zoroark in Pokémon Legends: Arceus after that.

                    <span>2021 was the year of the time loop wasn&#x27;t it? Deathloop topped a lot of charts and made an appearance in our game of the year list. Twelve Minutes: a timeloop thriller. Lemnis Gate: a tactical FPS where you out time loop one another. The Forgotten City, the Outer Wilds DLC, watching a man throw a “traditional shaped returning” boomerang on YouTube. All of them, time loops.
I’m absolutely sick of them. So here’s me hoping that 2022 is the year of the &quot;time skip&quot;, instead. Or at least, one of these coming years an excessive number of games built around skipping time. Yes, they aren&#x27;t without their flaws, but I&#x27;d argue they&#x27;re less repetitive and capable of greater surprise. Alright, at least hear me out.

                    <span>CES is a gloriously mad hodgepodge of different tech fields; the kind where smartphone chip makers share floor space with car manufacturers and sex toys. It’s also one of the biggest showcases of PC gaming hardware in the calendar, and CES 2022 has been no exception, with major component reveals from AMD, Intel, and Nvidia along with loads of gaming laptop, peripheral, and monitor announcements.


This year’s show is technically still going for another day, but like a Foo Fighters album, CES tends to front-load the good stuff. As such, it’s basically safe to start rounding up any PC gaming kit highlights. Some of these have been a long time coming – like the GeForce RTX 3050, Nvidia’s first XX50 desktop GPU with full ray tracing and DLSS support – while others might be pleasant surprises or eye-catching, if likely to be witheringly expensive, new concepts.

                    <span>I was a little worried about Left 4 Dead-alike Rainbow Six: Extraction. You know, after it was announced as Rainbow Six: Quarantine, changed its name, dipped under the radar for ages, then re-emerged with news it was being delayed. Signs pointed to a shaky spin-off from Rainbow Six: Siege&#x27;s popular Outbreak mode. But no, I was totally wrong! After an early hands on with the game, I’m now at ease, at least when I’m at a safe distance. You see, the zombies here may be fewer in number, but they don’t mess about. This makes for a tactical spin on zombie-slaying that truly rewards teamwork, and it’s wonderful as a result.

                    <span>2022 is finally here and that can only mean one thing. We&#x27;ve got another year of hip new video games to look forward to, and we&#x27;ve been busy rustling up the ones we&#x27;re most excited about. In truth, there are tons of games on the horizon that could easily sit on this list, and some of them are so close to release we can practically already see the pixels on our screens morphing into their lush, polygonal landscapes. Games like Monster Hunter Rise, God Of War and Rainbow Six Extraction. You won&#x27;t find them here, but trust us, you&#x27;ll be seeing a lot of them over the coming weeks. 
There are always more games coming out than we have fingers to write about them, but the 2022 games we&#x27;ve listed below are the ones the RPS team are personally most looking forward to playing. We&#x27;ve got games big and small here, and they&#x27;re all listed in alphabetical order. After all, release dates are increasingly slippery beasts these days. Think we&#x27;ve missed something? Why not take to the comments below and tell us all about it. You might just convince us to put it on our radars. But enough from me. Here are our 43 most anticipated games of 2022.

                    <span>Last September, Studio Pixel Punk released Unsighted, a top-down action RPG with a unique time limit on the life of its NPCs. It quickly garnered high praise from critics, including RPS&#x27; own Katharine Castle who named it one of the Best Games You Missed in 2021. To find out more about this indie gem, I got in touch with Studio Pixel Punk&#x27;s pair of developers Fernanda Dias and Tiani Pixel to talk to them about its inspirations, turning off its timer, and the true meaning behind the game&#x27;s name.

                    <span>Developers Might And Delight call Book Of Travels a TMORPG, a &quot;tiny&quot; MMO that&#x27;s focused on fleeting interactions with other players, as opposed to lots of them. It’s a lovely looking adventure with a neat concept, so it was sad to hear that they&#x27;d been hit with layoffs after a difficult launch. However, some heartening news! More levels are on the way, as well as new character customisation tools. They also reaffirmed that despite being a much smaller team than before, they&#x27;re committed to working on the game for the foreseeable.

                    <span>Unsurprisingly, E3 will once again not happen as an in-person event this year, what with the whole global pandemic and all. The Entertainment Software Association, who organise E3, had hoped that the main event on the video games industry&#x27;s marketing calendar would return properly this year, after skipping 2019 and going online in 2020, but nope. While they haven&#x27;t yet confirmed whether or not they&#x27;ll arrange an online E3 in its stead, they seem to be considering it. But even if not, the industry will doubltess manage to host its own advert-o-ramas without the E3 banner.

                    <span>The justice system is stupid. You can go to jail for setting a plant on fire and putting it in your mouth. Shut up, the police. Be smart for once. Maybe people would stop trying to escape from prison if you did something sensible like, I don&#x27;t know, cease being a militarised gang of dirtbag predators. Stop watching everyone through video cameras, you absolute creeps. What? Oh right, video games. Here&#x27;s 9 of the best jailbreaks in PC games.

                    <span>Horizon Zero Dawn set a solid foundation for Guerrilla Games to build upon in Horizon Forbidden West, and the developer isn’t about to let this opportunity pass it by. For the upcoming sequel, Guerrilla Games looked at fan feedback, revisited ideas that were too ambitious for the first game, and tapped into the studio’s well of creativity to make Aloy’s exploits even more exciting. For our latest cover story, we saw Forbidden West in action and learned firsthand about how the sequel is making some worthwhile changes to improve upon its predecessor. 
Better Cinematics 
We expect improved graphics with each new entry in a series, and so far, the footage shown for Forbidden West has been extremely impressive. But sometimes it takes seeing the game up-close to really notice its finer points. “…</span>

                    <span>It looks like E3 2022 will follow in the footsteps of last year’s show by being a digital-only event. Although the hope after 2021 was a return to an in-person gathering at the Los Angeles Convention Center (with even the city’s mayor crossing his fingers), the ongoing pandemic has nixed those plans. 
In a statement to Venture Beat, posted below, the ESA confirmed that the coronavirus remains a major issue so it’s playing it safe for one more year:
As we all know, the pandemic is still very much a thing, especially with the Omicron variant running rampant. This isn’t the biggest shock in the world but still disappointing for fans, developers, and media hoping to reconnect in person this June. Since the pandemic started, E3 has been canceled outright in 2020 and the 2021 edition saw the event unfold through a series of livestreams and digital meetings held on the ESA’s website. If nothing else, it&#x27;ll be interesting to see how the ESA iterates on last year&#x27;s approach.

We&#x27;re back with 2022&#x27;s first episode of The Game Informer Show! This week, we&#x27;re breaking down our thoughts on the PlayStation VR 2 and Horizon Call of the Mountain, along with catching you up with all the games we&#x27;ve been playing over the holidays! Also, Inquisitor of Indie Games Jill Grodt and Marcus Stewart join the Alexes this week and add to another stellar round of Listener Questions to round out the show.

                    <span>One of the worst experiences I ever had in virtual reality was rolling credits on Half-Life: Alyx. Not playing the game – mind you – that was fantastic. No, I hated rolling credits on the game because I knew this phenomenal AAA VR experience was over, and I didn’t know when I would ever have another VR adventure of that caliber again.
Anyone who has ever put on a VR headset can tell you that the technology is promising. Anyone who owns a VR headset can tell you how slow the industry has been to fulfill that promise. I love creative offerings like Beat Saber, Superhot VR, and Pistol Whip. Those entertaining diversions make me happy to have a headset, but they only provide one type of experience. I still crave meatier, story-based VR adventures. Stuff like Half-Life: Alyx and … and … and wel…</span>

                    <span>A very creative person has designed Lego versions of the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and while they aren’t available to purchase at the moment, they could be one day. 
Twitter user BrickinNick revealed these two proof-of-concept Lego kits today with a stylish video and it turns out, with enough support, these could become real. That’s thanks to Lego Ideas, which is a unique Lego program where users can submit project concepts such as Lego new-gen consoles and ask for support. With enough backing, Lego could bring these conceptual kits to fruition. That assitance is what BrickinNick is asking for on Twitter and showing it requires simply creating a Lego Ideas account and clicking support. BrickinNick says 10,000 supporters can help this project become a Lego set so if you like what you …</span>

                    <span>Action! We all love it, and some of the best games have it, whether that takes the form of a bombastic shooter, sword-clashing melee fest, or good old-fashioned brawler. Action is one of the most universally beloved genres, so we’ve compiled a list of upcoming games that already have our adrenaline pumping. Rather than rank them, each game is arranged in chronological release order so you’ll know how long you’ll have to wait before you can get your hand on them. And hey, just because an action game didn’t make the cut doesn’t mean it won’t be worth a look! These are just the titles that, at a glance, raised our eyebrows the highest.

                    <span>Bioware general manager Gary McKay has posted a blog discussing the state of the studio as it marches into 2022. The post provides some insight into the company&#x27;s development and cultural goals moving forward, as well as light updates on its upcoming projects.
You can read the full post here, but one of the biggest takeaways is Bioware’s acknowledgment of previous missteps and its mission to get back in the good graces of its fans. McKay states that “When I took on the GM role, I talked about rebuilding our reputation, and that remains a huge priority. We are laser-focused on building back the trust of our fans and community, and we plan to do that by delivering the types of games that we are best known for and ensuring they are of the highest quality.” McKay touts the positive reception o…</span>

                    <span>We&#x27;re back after our holiday streaming sabbatical to bring you live gaming goodness straight from the shores of Eorzea and beyond. That&#x27;s right! Our first livestream of the year is centered on the latest expansion to Final Fantasy XIV Online, Endwalker. Join fearless adventurers and Game Informer editors John Carson and Dan Tack to venture into some of the new dungeons and explore the new zones, including the surface of the moon! 
The stream is set to go live at 2 p.m. Central this afternoon on our Twitch channel, so don&#x27;t miss it.

The sky is falling and only the Scions of the Seventh Dawn and the Warrior of Light are prepared to take on whatever or whoever is causing the calamitous end of days. Endwalker signals the conclusion to the Hydaelyn and Zodiark storyline, a central conflict between the forces of light and darkness that&#x27;s been at the core of FFXIV&#x27;s story since its early days. The expansion brings multiple new zones and two exciting new Jobs, the Sage and Reaper. 
Give us a follow on Twitch so you know when we&#x27;re live for any of our various livestreams. You can find us live on Thursday afternoons for variety streams featuring the latest games, and on Fridays for Super Replay!

                    <span>Far Cry 6 was released last October, and while the base game offered dozens of hours of FPS action gameplay, Ubisoft upped the ante by committing to free content drops and three paid DLCs. 
Some of the free DLC includes Los Pollos Hermanos and Heisenberg outfits from Breaking Bad, while the first paid DLC, dubbed Vaas’ Insanity, gave players the chance to play as the infamous villain from Far Cry 3. Vaas’ Insanity was the first part of a villain-focused trilogy included in the Far Cry 6 season pass that costs $40. The second villainous DLC will star Far Cry 4’s Pagan Min, and now, Ubisoft announced that it’s coming next week. 
Dive into the twisted mind of Pagan Min. The new Pagan: Control DLC is coming January 11. pic.twitter.com/2hIr1xoPkc
January 5, 2022
More specifically, it will go live on January 11. Like the Vaas experience before it and the forthcoming Joseph Seed DLC coming after it, this Pagan Min-focused episode called Pagan: Control is a rogue-like experience that sees the Troy Baker-voiced villain “struggling to escape the horrors of their own minds.” You will die a lot and retry a lot, Ubisoft promises. 
You begin with a pistol and must find new weapons and powers to progress through Pagan Min’s mind. You’ll be able to give this experience a go in five days on January 11. 
For more, read about the other DLC offerings you can expect in Far Cry 6, and then check out our thoughts on the game in Game Informer’s Far Cry 6 review. Read about the Vaas’ Insanity DLC after that.

                    <span>It is important to keep in mind what is going on within Activision Blizzard at this time regarding ongoing allegations about the work culture. The ongoing lawsuit from the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) against the company is over reported toxic workplace culture. The bulk of the suit focuses on &quot;violations of the state&#x27;s civil rights and equal pay laws,&quot; specifically regarding the treatment of women and other marginalized groups. To learn more about the proceedings thus far, including details listed in the lawsuit against Activision Blizzard, please check out our previous coverage here.

After weeks of public silence, Activision has responded to an ongoing strike at Raven Software. 
The ongoing Raven employee strike, which began after a dozen contract QA workers were let go in December, entered its third week this week with no formal acknowledgment from Activision. However, a new statement from upper Raven Software management (see: Activision management) given to GamesIndustry.biz reveals that the company is in active discussions with employees. 
For more about story, read Game Informer’s prior coverage of the Raven layoffs, including Activision’s statement following the transition of 500 contract employees to full-time.

                    <span>Konami is celebrating the 35th anniversary of its Castlevania series with a new “memorial NFT” collection. 
More specifically, the company is auctioning 14 NFTs, some of which are just static images, others which appear to be videos. You can, of course, view each right now on their website – no purchase required – but you won’t be able to see how much each is going for as the auctions won’t begin until January 12. 
“Konami Memorial NFT is a new initiative to share content that has been loved by players all over the world, for many years,” a press release reads. “As the company’s first project in this area and with NFTs and blockchains technology in its infancy, Konami will continue to explore new developments and listen to player feedback following this initial collection.”

                    <span>Horizon Forbidden West&#x27;s new west coast setting isn’t just inhabited by fearsome new machines. Aloy will also encounter tribes and cultures, some friends and some foes. Guerrilla Games released a video reintroducing players to familiar tribes such as the Oseram, Utaru, and Tenakth, giving a rundown of their culture and standing in this region of the country. 
We see the Utaru, a culture in tune with nature, singing songs in an effort to cure their land of the blight. On the flip side, the battle-hardened Tenakth, which is divided into three clans, serves as the dominant tribe in the Forbidden West. One of those clans is the Regalla, the rebel faction shown in previous trailers that are at war with their fellow clansfolk. As powerful as the Tenakth is, the trailer hints at rumors of an even stronger group residing on the outer reaches of the Forbidden West.

So here comes Pupperazzi, nailing the zeitgeist as a game specifically about taking photos of dogs - who, of course, you can also pet. It&#x27;s now just two weeks away from release, with a January 20th release date.

                    <span>I have a strange relationship with Dead Cells. I picked it up in 2019 and played it for a while, by which point I&#x27;d clearly had my fill. No DLCs to my name, nothing. I&#x27;d done a big run and put the game down.
Fast forward to now. Suddenly I own the latest expansion The Queen And The Sea, plus all the DLCs that came before it. I&#x27;m nonchalant, thinking that I dropped the game for a reason. Surely I can&#x27;t be won almost three years later? Well, nope. I was wrong. The DLCs have opened my eyes to the game in ways I hadn’t anticipated. The combat is crunchy, the challenge is thrilling, and Dead Cells more than holds its own next to more modern darlings of the genre like Hades.

                    <span>If you prefer Earth be but a blue marble alone in the void, two of the latest Game Pass additions might tickle your spacefancy. Microsoft&#x27;s subscription service today adds BioWare&#x27;s remastered Mass Effect Legendary Edition trilogy as well as the beautiful clockwork mystery Outer Wilds, which was our favourite game of 2019. The cooperative and chaotic first-person firefighting game Embr hit Game Pass today too but that has, like, gravity? So passé.

It&#x27;s called The Queen And The Sea and is home to shipwrecks and lighthouses infested with monsters, mainly. And a throwable shark. That’s me sold.

In all likelihood, though, that’s not going to happen, so instead let’s put our chins in our palms, angle our heads slightly and gaze off into the sky while picturing all the neat PC hardware that’s launching this year.

                    <span>Konami, the Japanese company best known for squandering every shred of goodwill they built through series like Castlevania and Metal Gear Solid, are getting into NFTs. Of course they are. Should&#x27;ve guessed. While publishers like Square Enix, EA, and Take-Two are still contemplating NFTs, I am not remotely surprised that Konami are one of the first notable names to actually start selling useless digital junk. Next week, they will hold an auction for NFTs of videos, artwork, and music from early Castlevania games. Konami, man.

                    <span>Studio director and co-founder of Playground Games, Gavin Raeburn, has revealed that he’s leaving the company. 
First reported by Windows Central, he has revealed that after co-founding and working at Playground for 12 years, he’s retiring from the racetrack. This news comes two months after the studio put out its most successful title yet in Forza Horizon 5, which at the time of its release, also had the biggest launch of any Xbox Game Studios game ever.

“After 12 years working on five award-winning Forza Horizon games, Gavin Raeburn is leaving Playground Games as studio director,” Turn 10 Studio Head and Forza franchise lead Alan Hartman told Windows Central. “A founding member of Playground Games, we thank Gav for his leadership and contributions to the Forza franchise and wish him all the best.” 
Hartman said another Playground co-founder, Trevor Williams, will transition from General Manager to Studio Head effective immediately, replacing Raeburn. He also said the studio will continue to focus on updates to Forza Horizon 5 and the ongoing development of its Fable reboot, which was officially announced in 2020. 
As noted by Windows Central, Raeburn has quite the history in the racing genre, having worked on Codemasters’ TOCA series, Dirt, and Grid. He left Codemasters in 2009 to create Playground Games, which was acquired by Microsoft in 2018. 
There’s no word on what’s next for Raeburn or if he’s even staying in games.

                    <span>Riot Games have pulled the curtains back on the newest agent joining Valorant and her name is Neon. 
Revealed by way of a special agent trailer, Neon is a fast-paced electric shooter that seemingly specializes in zooming all over a given map quicker than any other agent in the game. The short story trailer, which runs less than three minutes, reveals that Neon is a Manila, Philippines-based agent with an excellent taste in music.

As you can see in the trailer, Neon is a fan of Entertain Me by Ylona Garcia and 88rising. She’s also seemingly a fan of dreaming about what players are going to accomplish on the battlefield using her powers. We see her sprinting and sliding all over the maps shown in the trailer, using her electricity to make it easier. However, it doesn’t seem like she’ll be able to shoot while sprinting so don’t expect to be the run-n-gunner Neon might appear to be. 
We also get a quick look at one of her abilities where Neon lifts two large and long walls of electricity in a straight line, walls that she’s free to run in and out of. 
The trailer also reveals that Neon will arrive in Valorant with Episode 4: Disruption, although a release date for this new episode (which is what Valorant calls its big updates) has not yet been revealed. However, the current battle pass ends on January 11 so some fans have speculated that Episode 4 will begin the following day on January 12. 
While waiting to learn more, check out our thoughts on the shooter in Game Informer’s Valorant review and then read about how Valorant’s director is no longer working on the game and instead working on a new secret project at Riot. Be sure to read about how a mobile version of Valorant is on the way after that.

                    <span>Virtual reality hasn’t caught on as quickly as some predicted, but VR headsets have managed to amass an impressive collection of software in the last few years regardless. And given Sony&#x27;s recent PSVR2 announcements, this could be a big year for virtual reality. If you just bought a Meta Quest or haven’t fired yours up in a long time, there are several great experiences to be had. We highlight some of the best VR titles out now for the Quest, from high octane music games to spooky shooters. Here are 10 VR games you shouldn’t ignore, in no particular order.

                    <span>Arcade1Up, makers of affordable arcade cabinets built at a manageable size to put in your home, is broadening its product line to offer a larger, full-size machine for collectors who want a more true-to-arcade experience. 
The first in the line of Arcade1Up&#x27;s Pro Series cabinets features a handful of games, centered around Rare&#x27;s classic fighter, Killer Instinct. What makes the Pro Series stand apart from its contemporaries isn&#x27;t its slate of games, though; it&#x27;s the construction of the cabinet itself.
Arcade1Up&#x27;s traditional home arcade machines stand somewhere between 47&quot; and 57&quot; tall, depending on whether you have it sitting on the height-boosting riser. The Killer Instinct Pro Series cabinet measures in at 67.5&quot; tall (or 5ft 6in), almost a foot taller than the typical cab with a riser s…</span>

                    <span>Nobody Saves The World, the upcoming action RPG from Guacamelee developers Drinkbox Studios, has a release date and it’s less than two weeks away. 
More specifically, it will be released on January 18 and as previously announced, it will hit Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC via Windows 10 and Steam for $24.99. However, if you’re an Xbox Game Pass subscriber or a member of Microsoft’s PC Game Pass, the game will hit those services on day one, meaning you can download them for free.

Hopefully, you’ve got a friend lined up to play Nobody Saves The World with, too, because the game features online co-op, although it does not feature cross-play so you’ll need to be on the same platform as your friend to play together. 
In Nobody Saves The World, you control a “featureless nobody” that can transform into a variety of different animals and creatures, including a slug, a ghost, a dragon, a rat, a robot, and much more. You’ll need to swap between over 15 different forms with mixed and matched abilities to unlock and complete quests to progress through the game’s narrative. 
Speaking of abilities, Drinkbox says there are over 80 different Form abilities, meaning each player will likely have their own customized build that works best for them. You might play as an egg that leaves a trail of slime behind you or a rat that shoots fireballs – the choice is up to you. 
If you’re interested in the soundtrack, which was created by composer Jim Guthrie (Below, Sword and Sorcery), it will be available for purchase on Steam and other platforms when the game is released on January 18. 
Nobody Saves The World was announced back in March and it quickly gained traction as yet another exciting title from Drinkbox. For more, watch this New Gameplay Today segment about the game.

                    <span>Bomb Rush Cyberfunk, the upcoming Jet Set Radio-inspired game by the makers of Lethal League, is all about style. With that in mind, what’s cooler than hitting a bunch of sick tricks set to a fresh soundtrack? Not much based on this latest trailer. 
Although the video doesn’t update players on when Bomb Rush Cyberfunk will drop, it does provide a glimpse into some of the cool moves you can pull off. Whether you’re tearing up the city on a pair of skates, a bike, or a skateboard, executing stylish rail grinds and nailing combos is not only fun but vital to progression. The crux of the game is tagging enough spots with your graffiti and out-tricking other crews to earn enough reputation to challenge them for territory control. Mastering traversal also matters for reaching hidden areas of the city that may contain secrets.

If this modern homage has you chomping at the bit to play it, developer Team Reptile promises in the video&#x27;s description that it&#x27;s “going in hard” to get Bomb Rush Cyberfunk out the door this year. The game is slated to arrive on Switch and PC.

                    <span>Marvel’s Spider-Man on PlayStation 4 was a real treat and its remastered version on PlayStation 5 was even better. Despite how great it feels to play as Peter Parker in both versions, one thing neither version could do was really put you behind the Spider-Man mask. 
However, one player has come up with a unique way to give people a way to see what the game looks like through Peter Parker’s eyes: stop-motion.

As you can see in YouTube video above, creator ItIsSpid decided to take on a daunting task to show us what swinging through Insomniac Games’ New York City is like on PlayStation 5, both via Peter Paker and Miles Morales, and it looks amazing. We’re treated to a minute and 40 seconds of hundreds of first-person screenshots (courtesy of the games’ impressive photo modes) and we’ve never wanted a first-person Spider-Man game more. 
Of course, it takes a couple of seconds for your eyes to adjust to the stop-motion effect but when it sings, it looks great. 
“Using Spider-Man PS5/Miles Morales PS5 photo mode, I decided to try and combine 850+ photos and make a first-person gameplay stop-motion,” ItIsSpid’s YouTube description reads.

                    <span>Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Extraction is launching on January 20 and today, Ubisoft announced that it will hit Xbox Game Pass on day one. The company also announced that its own Xbox Game Pass-like service, Ubisoft+, will be coming to Xbox as well. 
Ubisoft first teased today’s Xbox-related news on Twitter before revealing shortly after that the next entry in the very popular Rainbow Six series, Extraction, will be on Xbox Game Pass and Game Pass for PC on the game’s launch day of January 20.

                    <span>The musou genre is a long-spanning one with dozens of entries in it, but despite that, it has remained relatively niche in the grand scheme of things. 
However, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild has helped buck that trend as Omega Force has revealed (on Twitter) that its Zelda musou, Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity, has shipped a whopping 4 million units since its release back in November of 2020. Of course, “shipped” is very different than “sold,” as this new statistic doesn’t necessarily indicate 4 million people have purchased the game, but manufacturers aren’t going to ship a game to storefronts when said storefronts have plenty in stock.

So while Age of Calamity hasn’t sold 4 million units, it has likely sold millions, which must be exciting for Omega Force. The team had to pull off quite the feat to make it a success, as creating a prequel to Breath of the Wild, one of the most celebrated games of all time, is no easy task. Omega Force even went a step further and created an expansion pass for Age of Calamity that furthered the prequel story by adding in controllable guardians, new weapons, and a rideable motorcycle to use in-game. These expansions also brought a new “Apocalyptic” difficulty to the musou as well as new challenges in the Royal Ancient Lab, new enemies, and more. 
For more about Age of Calamity, read this feature on why Omega Force made this musou a prequel in the first place, and then check out our thoughts on the game in Game Informer’s Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity review.

                    <span>Update 2, 1/05/2021: Epic Games has revealed the rewards players will be getting after Fortnite went down for several hours back in December. 
Game Informer first reported on December 29 that Fortnite was down due to server issues and after several hours of the battle royale being offline, Epic Games pushed it back online. They promised rewards to compensate for the downtime, too. The company didn&#x27;t announce at the time what those rewards would be, but the official Fortnite Twitter account revealed what we can expect today. 
As thanks for everyone’s patience during the December login issues, we’ll be kicking off a Power Leveling Weekend from 1/7 @ 7 PM to 1/10 @ 7 AM ET and granting everyone who logged in during Winterfest the new Crescent Shroom Pickaxe before it arrives in the Shop later…</span>

Today they announced a release date of January 18th for Nobody Saves The World, a top-down ARPG with where players can transform into everything from a rogue to a rat, and customise them to be even weirder. It will be on Game Pass, too.

The monster-mashing spin-off from R6 Siege isn&#x27;t one of their full-price games, coming at a slightly cheaper £34, but still, damn, that&#x27;s a good get. And exactly the sort of game I likely wouldn&#x27;t buy new but would try on Game Pass.

Supposedly they were using stolen credit card info to buy Bits (Twitch&#x27;s virtuacurrency), which they would then donate to Twitch streamers who had agreed to give money in return in exchange for keeping a portion for themselves. This first came to light following Twitch&#x27;s big data leak last year.

                    <span>Steam has existed in a grey area in China, technically not following rules which require all games be approved yet never drawing the ire of authorities. Many have long expected it to eventually be banned, though, especially after Valve partnered with Perfect World to launch the limited Steam China. This might now be happening. Maybe. Or it&#x27;s possibly being hindered, at least. This all started with a big stink on Christmas Day that led some to declare Steam had been banned by the Great Firewall which restricts access to many sites outside China, but the reality is not so clear cut.

                    <span>The vanguard of Intel’s 12th Gen Alder Lake CPUs had some seriously good chips in it – including two of the best CPUs for gaming overall – though there weren’t many models for aspiring PC builders on tight budgets. Now, though, Intel has used CES 2022 to launch the rest of the 12th Gen desktop lineup, adding loads of more affordable Core i5 and Core i3 processors on top of new Core i7 and Core i9 options. Intel also unveiled its new H-series, 12th Gen gaming laptop chips, which use the same hybrid architecture (combining powerful P-cores with smaller, less energy-intensive E-cores) as their Alder Lake desktop cousins.

                    <span>Before it pivoted to talking about self-driving cars, something I can’t even put into a PCIe slot, Nvidia’s CES 2022 showcase went both high and low with its graphics card reveals. The high: the GeForce RTX 3090 Ti, as new top-of-the-line CPU with 24GB of upgraded, 21Gbit/s GDDR6X VRAM. The low: the GeForce RTX 3050, Nvidia’s first XX50 GPU in a donkey’s age.

                    <span>It’s the first week of 2022 and that means – yes! – all the big PC hardware movers and shakers are hosting their CES 2022 events. On the same day. Within a couple of hours of each other. But my stress is your gain, as there are and will be some major announcements on new kit, starting with AMD. Their freshly-announced hardware includes an assortment of new CPUs, desktop and mobile graphics cards and even some laptop APUs – APUs that sound a lot more useful for gaming that what current integrated graphics can offer. There’s even an Nvidia Image Scaling rival in the upcoming, driver-level Radeon Super Resolution feature.

                    <span>Nightingale certainly isn&#x27;t the sort of game I was expecting from a former BioWare developer, but I&#x27;m well excited to give it a go. Announced at The Game Awards 2021, Nightingale is a survival craft &#x27;em up set in a fantastical, alt-history world. It&#x27;s being made by Inflexion Games, a studio lead by Aaryn Flynn, former programmer and general manager at the Dragon Age and Mass Effect developers. 
But don&#x27;t go in expecting the sort of huge, arcing plotlines of BioWare&#x27;s recent games. While Nightingale will have an over-arching narrative, it&#x27;s being designed to offer up adventures that let you make your own stories. I spoke to Flynn at the end of last year to find out a little bit more about what that entails.

                    <span>Riot Games, the makers of Valorant and League Of Legends, have agreed to pay out $100 million (£74m) as part of a proposed settlement to a class-action suit brought against them for &quot;systemic sex discrimination and harassment&quot;. Money will go to current and former female employees and contract workers. The suit started in 2018 following widespread allegations of a festering workplace culture, and was originally due to be settled for $10 million (£7m) until California state authorities raised objections that it wasn&#x27;t enough.

                    <span>The first rule of video game club (apart from not talking about video game club) usually involves saving the world somehow. We do our best to rescue others from harm, to avert world-ending disasters, and give everyone around us the happy ending they deserve. But if there&#x27;s one thing I&#x27;ve learned about myself in 2021, it&#x27;s that I&#x27;m a cruel, heartless robot who will happily toss others under the bus if they don&#x27;t provide any material benefit to me. Or at least I am when I&#x27;m playing Unsighted, the gorgeous and criminally underrated action RPG from Studio Pixel Punk that puts a ticking time-bomb inside each of its characters&#x27; metallic chests which, if left unchecked, will remove them from the game entirely, preventing you from gaining some potentially very handy upgrades to help you in your quest to fight back against your human oppressors. 
It&#x27;s an ingenious system, as you&#x27;re not only fighting against the hordes of enemies that appear onscreen, but your own ineptitude.

                    <span>If you&#x27;re anything like me, when you start a game you will almost invariably try to run off into the woods or swamp and aggressively ignore anything even passably resembling a main story. After hours of feeling like a brave rebel by doing this in Vagrus - The Riven Realms, I realised it&#x27;s how you&#x27;re supposed to play it. This is not a game about some Epic Quest or grand campaign. It&#x27;s a game about running a caravan in a world that just happens to have a cool history.

                    <span>2021 was hot boy summer for detectives. Well, not summer. Hot boy autumn? Is that a thing? Anyway, I not only played Sherlock Holmes Chapter One, but also an incarnation of Hercule Poirot as a bright young thing in Agatha Christie - Hercule Poirot: The First Cases. And yes, that name is a bit of a nightmare, but the game itself is very sweet. There&#x27;s &#x27;orrible murder, conspiracy, blackmail, union busting, and a cast of Cluedo-esque characters trapped inside a snowy manor. And yes, I am reusing the shoddy Love Island promo photo composite I made for a header picture, because it deserves the mileage.

                    <span>Ghost Time Games’ Tux And Fanny, from co-developers Albert Birney and Gabriel Koenig, is not only the game I think you may have missed this year, but it is also my Game Of The Year for 2021. This game sends two best friends (alongside a courageous flea and a mischievous cat) through adventures great, small, and absurd to stunning effect – and you owe it to yourself to give this little marvel a play before the year is well and truly out.

                    <span>It’s pretty difficult to quantify which games actually whip ass, mostly because it’s a little subjective. That being said, if barrelling through the streets of a futuristic, neon-glazed Detroit, hopping over pursuing cop cars and racing through business offices and factories to the tune of an engrossing soundtrack doesn’t whip ass, I don’t know what does.

                    <span>Immersive sims are tricky games to get right. The spaces need to have incredibly tight design so they feel fun to explore, and lots of ways to get around them. And one of the best games of the year just happens to be one that does that expertly. Hang on, Deathloop? What are you talking about? No, no, the real best immersive sim this year is co-open by lowpolis, obviously!

                    <span>Diablo has, for good reasons, become a shorthand for describing the flavour of gothic, grimdark fantasy setting in games, where pus-filled demonic hordes and rotting, undead corpses scour a hellish cathedral looking for unwitting adventurers. For all its wretched decay, however, the series still feels like an indulgence to be savoured. Its clickiness and abhorrent sights make the games endlessly gratifying, and masterful butchery of fiends eases most players into a comfortable rhythm. And part of that appeal lies in the macabre yet captivating fantasy it so deftly peddles — all that blood, gore and guts really make for a grisly setting that’s nearly impossible to look away from.


Tainted Grail: Conquest conveys the same sense of blight and doom in its dark fantasy universe — one that’s a reimagining of Arthurian legends — but also ups the ante with a huge wallop of Slay The Spire’s roguelike, deck-building elements.

                    <span>As a child struggling to sleep at night I&#x27;d dream of three worlds. First and least of these was Desert World, a blithe eternity of golden sand always viewed from kilometres up, where fizzing white rings rose toward me like expanding surf. I&#x27;d try to find my way down to the surface, but always at the risk of glitching straight through and ending up in Snake World, where monstrous serpents emerged from darkened kitchens.


Somewhere between these two poles lay the realm of the Animals, not that they were really animals, but clouds of eyelash-thin mandible, grot and sparkle, like rotten food on the point of becoming a school of tropical fish. I loved Animal World. I used to spend hours trying to mind-hack my way into it. I was pretty shocked to find its likeness in Sluggish Morss: Pattern Circus - an irresistibly strange, gristly, sorrowful, comical and inventive album of creatures, songs, places and phrases from Jack King-Spooner and composer Helena Celle.

                    <span>It’s hard to imagine a collaboration between Zero Escape and Danganronpa creators Kotaro Uchikoshi and Kazutaka Kodaka going under the radar, but an odd release schedule (involving dropping a half-finished experience on Apple Arcade) saw interest in the collaboration buried by the time the game hit PC last month. Which is a shame, since it’s a rather unique title in their respective careers, and it charts new waters for these cult directors.


World’s End Club was the first game the pair released since forming their own studio, Too Kyo Games, and can best be described as a bizarre but intriguing blend of platforming and death games, starring a cast of prepubescent children way too young to be fixing the world or dealing with cults. Think Danganronpa, if Danganronpa was a Saturday morning cartoon rather than a murder game filled with psychopaths.

                    <span>All right, folks, we&#x27;re now officially done and dusted for the year. 2021 is being brought to a close, and RPS is entering its annual hibernation period. We wish you a merry Christmas, a happy holiday, and a general Festivus for the rest of yous as we scuttle out of the RPS Treehouse for a couple of weeks and have a nice big sleep in our mountain of sweet wrappers. We&#x27;ll see you back bright and early on Tuesday January 4th 2022.

                    <span>If you like your RPG adventures to contain dungeons and dragons, and be as complex as Dungeons &amp; Dragons, perhaps you might fancy the latest game being given away free in the Epic Games Store&#x27;s festive sale. For 24 hours, Epic are handing out Pathfinder: Kingmaker free for keepsies. It&#x27;s a vast fantasy RPG based on the Pathfinder pen &#x27;n&#x27; paper system, played out in ye olde isometric perspective. The sort of RPG that&#x27;s fascinating to some, offputting to others—so a great candidate for a freebie.

Watching &#x27;til that morning comes creeping
Green Door, what&#x27;s that secret your keeping?
Jim Lowe&#x27;s Green Door might not be a Christmas song, but it sure can feel like one—especially inside the festive action of Dracula Cha Cha. That&#x27;s right, it&#x27;s Christmas Eve, which means one more night without sleeping, and time to play Dracula Cha Cha.

They&#x27;re named Takaya Kuroda &amp; Goodfellas and they have a Christmas song out. Not only is this excellent news, I can&#x27;t get over the fact it straight up sounds like Kiryu delivering some festive cheer. So get comfy, bang this on, and let Kiryu&#x27;s warm tones wash over you like mulled wine.

                    <span>Right now Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker is so popular you can’t buy it anymore. To prevent overcrowding and crashing servers, Square Enix have had to halt free trials and new sales to keep the game stable after an unprecedented surge in popularity this summer. Between that and the global shortage of materials to add more servers, it may be quite some time until new players are able to experience it. If you have an active subscription and manage to brave the long queues however, you’re one of the lucky few who get to experience something truly special. For everyone else: hang in there, it will be worth the wait.

                    <span>MERRY CHRISTMAS YA FILTHY ANIMALS! This time of year can be one that feels particularly apocalyptic, as well as, you know, good will to all I guess. If I have to. The indie games I&#x27;ve been playing recently all have a bit of an end-of-the-world flavour to &#x27;em, whether literal or metaphorical or by your own hand, if you feel like it. I dunno, I actually found them strangely relaxing, as a sort of counterpoint to the chaos of my own life during the holiday season. See what you think.

                    <span>The latest free game giveaway in GOG&#x27;s winter sale is an unexpected one for the festive season, but perhaps a game which captures the feeling of being trapped at a seemingly endless Christmas lunch with awful relatives: I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream. Nothing says &#x27;bad family Christmas&#x27; like being tortured for 109 years by a sentient supercomputer which nuked humanity and keeps only five people alive to torment. The 90s point &#x27;n&#x27; click adventure game is a grim one (so grim!), but one which does have its fans.

                    <span>In a special Christmas message from three of the NieR series&#x27; development stars, creative director Yoko Taro has announced that NieR is over. No more NieR games for us... unless he receives a massive pile of money. Quickly, it becomes clear he&#x27;s just joshing around. Another classic ruse from the man in the Emil mask, and a subtle hint that they may have something new in the works. Plus, it&#x27;s just a really delightful video and you should all watch it.

                    <span>Though I hardly remember the Steam Autumn Sale ending, the Steam Winter Sale started yesterday, bringing squillions more cheap video games. If you&#x27;re staring baffled at an endless list of innumerable deals, you could use some help. Honestly, most of our Steam Autumn Sale recommendations still stand, but the few of us in the RPS treehouse who haven&#x27;t already clocked off for the Christmas holiday do have some fresh picks for you too.

                    <span>We&#x27;re nearing the end of the year and my brain&#x27;s battery is flashing red. There&#x27;s some Christmassy-ness flowing in to tide me over, thanks to the mini-Christmas tree in my room. Every year it&#x27;s popped on the wardrobe alongside an honorary Lynx Africa. They share the same festive colours, after all.
Having pondered my tree for a bit, I thought about trees in games and how they make for good side quests. Now join me by the bark, as I examine why this might be the case in a roundabout manner.

                    <span>When I was younger I watched a nature documentary narrated by David Attenborough (I realise that doesn&#x27;t narrow it down) and in this nature documentary David told me about a cave. It is a very big cave, and every night a huge colony of bats come screaming out of the entrance. They spend the day clinging to the ceiling of this big cave, and all their bat poo falls down and has become a towering heap carpeting the floor.
But then David said look, the carpet is moving. And it turns out that the whole bottom of the cave is covered in cockroaches and giant centipedes. And if ever a small baby bat or an old injured bat falls, it is eaten alive by this hoard of chittering insects. This nature documentary haunted me, for it was the worst thing I could imagine happening.
Anyway, Nate has been to that cave and he&#x27;s going to tell us all about it for this episode of our supporters only podcast, The Nate Files. Thanks for being a supporter, pals!

                    <span>It&#x27;s been a busy, kind of mixed year for strategy games. Ever a broad church, 2021&#x27;s seen enough releases to keep ten of me busy, from the easy-going Legion War to the month-consuming Shadow Empire. I don&#x27;t know about you, but my personal &quot;to play&quot; list is out of control.
And yet, while we&#x27;ve had plenty to enjoy this year, it&#x27;s felt like a period of build-up to something bigger. I&#x27;m not one for looking forward. If a game&#x27;s not out yet it tends to disappear from my mind, making room for a hundred other recent releases in this age of plenty. That I&#x27;ve less interest in looking back over this year than I do pondering the next suggests that maybe we&#x27;re in for something special in the coming twelve months. Or perhaps it&#x27;s just been a rough one and I&#x27;m very sleep deprived and don&#x27;t want to think about 2021. Either way, let&#x27;s have a look at what&#x27;s in store for strategy fans in 2022, yeah?

Among these are Perfect World, the publishers of Star Trek Online and Torchlight, and the studio behind Scribblenauts Showdown, Shiver Entertainment. They&#x27;re also going transmedia, buying comics and TV company Dark Horse as well as an animation company and a video-on-demand network. Now they just need to get into food and housing, then our dystopian dreams of one corp owning our entire lives can come true.

                    <span>A recent round of BIOS updates for Dell and Alienware systems has turned out to be something of a bad batch. As first spotted by Bleeding Computer, multiple owners of Dell-made PCs – including the Alienware Aurora R8 and Inspiron 5680 gaming desktops, as well as the Latitude 5320 and 5520 business laptops – started developing big problems after installing the new BIOS versions. Failed boots, mainly, which of course makes it harder to apply potential fixes.

                    <span>Everyone knows there are two conditions that must be met before Christmas can officially begin. The first is playing Skeal. The second is the arrival of Steam&#x27;s Winter Sale. Blissfully, we can now tick both of these objectives off our to-do list, as Valve have finally unleashed their flurry of seasonal deals. Between now and January 5th, thousands of games will be discounted across Steam, and you&#x27;ll also be able to claim a free sticker every day as well, for those of you who enjoy that sort of thing.

                    <span>As that age-old saying goes, all good things must come to an end. As we prepare to put a full stop on the year and see out 2021 from our cocoon of Christmas chocolate wrappers, we must also sadly bid farewell to our news writer Imogen Beckhelling, who is heading off for a new adventure in the games industry in the New Year. Today is Imogen&#x27;s last day at RPS, so come and say goodbye.

                    <span>It struck me recently that I’ve not played as much of Halo Infinite’s multiplayer as I thought I would. I envisaged myself wiling away most evenings with my mates, playing Oddball and Slayer and laughing like someone from those video game adverts, swaying violently with a controller in hand.
I now know the reason why and I hate to admit it. Infinite doesn’t have a battle royale mode, which I&#x27;ve come to realise is the perfect FPS template for gaming with my mates. Something about it just works, you know? Listen, let me explain.

                    <span>I know almost nothing about Alfred Hitchcock. He’s the kind of archetypal director whose work I’ve been exposed to in bits and pieces without ever actually sitting down to watch one of his films in full. All of that is to say that, upon starting Alfred Hitchcock - Vertigo the game, I was in no position to judge whether it was a faithful adaptation of the film or to recognize all but the most obvious illusions to Hitchcock’s body of work (look, birds!). That’s okay, though, because as it turns out, Vertigo is an original story based on a collage of Hitchcockian concepts, not a direct adaption of the 1958 film by the same name.
Vertigo the game follows author Ed Miller as he grapples with a debilitating case of vertigo–a condition that leaves him unable to stand as the world appears to spin around him–and paralyzing guilt over the death of his daughter and her mother, Faye, after their car falls off a bridge into a ravine below. With Ed bed ridden, it’s up to Dr. Julia Lomas, psychologist and psychiatrist, and Sheriff Nick Reyes to unravel the mystery of what really happened, and whether Faye and his daughter even exist. My thoughts on how Vertigo goes about telling this story are... complicated.

                    <span>Final Fantasy XIV players haven’t had it easy these last few weeks. The sheer success of its Endwalker expansion resulted in lengthy login queues and server errors. It’s become so popular that Square Enix have temporarily stopped selling the game, taking its Starter and Complete Editions off sale. All the while, some low-poly grapes stayed static in the breeze. Jagged, delicious, minding their own business. Until their blockiness was papped and thrust into the public eye. Memes ensued and the grapes became the talk of the town, so much so that they’ve been smoothed out in the latest patch, much to everyone’s dismay.

I was with three friends, and we&#x27;d been adventuring together for years at this point - two of us were lovers, and yet a third had made a strange pact with a wolf God. We could do anything together, we four. And then we stumbled upon this door...

                    <span>Book Of Travels is what developers Might And Delight call a TMORPG - a &quot;tiny&quot; multiplayer online role playing game, as opposed to a &quot;massive&quot; one. It&#x27;s a gorgeous-looking adventure that came out in early access back in October, but unfortunately the launch didn&#x27;t go as well as the devs had hoped it would. Yesterday, they announced that they&#x27;ve had to lay off around 25 employees to keep the studio going. They add that development will continue, albeit at an understandably slower pace.

                    <span>Hello folks. It&#x27;s been a funny old year, 2021. On the games side, it&#x27;s often felt like a year of shifting goalposts. Games that were delayed by the pandemic last year finally got their due in 2021, but in turn many of the releases we were expecting this year have inevitably slipped into 2022. The pandemic has affected games of all sizes this year, and I don&#x27;t think it will go down in the history books as one of our all-time greats. There were still plenty of fantastic games that came out this year, mind, and we&#x27;re still counting down our absolute favourites over in our Advent Calendar. 
That said, I do think 2021 will prove to be a pivotal year for RPS - and not just because I stole Graham&#x27;s key card and changed the locks on the front door of the Treehouse. It&#x27;s been a year of immense change here at the site, so I wanted to take some time to reflect on everything that&#x27;s happened this year, and look forward to what we&#x27;ve got in store for 2022.

                    <span>If you simply can&#x27;t get enough of raccoon detectives sleuthing around dystopian Vancouver, then you&#x27;re in luck, because more is on the way. Developers EggNut have announced that a new Backbone game is coming in 2022, dropping us back into the snowy, animal-filled city. We don&#x27;t know much about it yet, but Backbone is an excellent detective puzzle game, and a gorgeous one at that, so I have high hopes for the next one.

The devs have another freebie for those folks too now - you can claim a free copy of GTA V: Premium Edition, GTA IV: Complete Edition, LA Noire, Bully: Scholarship Edition, or Max Payne 3 over the holiday period. Ah, free festive violence.

Modders have been hard at work weaving nice dresses with their virtual looms at a rate of knots. Oh, and they’ve morphed characters into Buster Swords and produced some other equally useful things too. Let&#x27;s have a gander at some of their most interesting creations.

                    <span>Update: Loop Hero&#x27;s time is done! The dino-battling FPS Second Extinction is the new freebie. 
Original Story: This year had us stuck in many video game time loops, but one of my absolute favourites was Loop Hero. I never thought an autobattler RPG would hook me the way it did, but I spent hours upon hours helping a little knight circle a seemingly endless void, and had a wonderful time doing it. If you didn&#x27;t have a chance to play it earlier this year, it&#x27;s now free on the Epic Game Store until tomorrow. I heartily encourage you to pick this one up, it&#x27;s one of our favourite games of 2021.

                    <span>The great thing about traditions is: you can just make them up. While some traditions feel more real because they&#x27;re embedded deeper in our culture, you can start your own whenever you want, and jettison any you don&#x27;t care for. Anything can be imbued with special meaning and, over time, grow into a tradition you cherish and come to anticipate. So here I am, approaching Christmas, so ready for my annual play of Skeal. Join me, reader dear.
