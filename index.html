The Frenchman had an outstanding start to his Manchester United career, but injuries and poor performances ruined his stay. He is set to leave the club very soon, and this is a great chance for all fans to obtain a special card. To get the item, you&#x27;ll need to complete the challenge and all its tasks before its expiry from Ultimate Team.

                              <span>As a follow up to its first handheld gaming PC, Asus has just revealed its brand new variant, the ROG Ally X. The updated Steam Deck competitor comes with a host of new features and improvements over the standard ROG Ally. Though as you&#x27;d expect, that bumps the price up a bit. 


How is the ROG Ally X better than the ROG Ally?

First and most noticeably, the new Ally X handheld gaming PC is black, while the previous version only came in white. Good news to some, but especially those who are snacking while they&#x27;re playing. Next, the Ally X sees upgrades to storage, battery life, and an additional vent to keep temperatures low. 


Asus added a new 80Wh battery, which will help with one of the biggest complaints about the ROG Ally. Its storage upgrade features a 1TB M.2 …</span>

                              <span>Geoff Keighley&#x27;s Summer Game Fest is upon us, taking its rightful place as the de facto summer video game experience after the shuttering of E3 last year. 


As is also tradition, Keighley has released his annual &quot;Geoff&#x27;s Trailer,&quot; a hype real spliced together of the biggest and best announcements that fans can expect at Summer Game Fest. 




There&#x27;s not necessarily any surprises in the trailer, but it does do a good job of setting the tone fans can expect from the show. There is, of course, a lot of Shadow of the Erdtree in here, which makes sense. The DLC is imminent, and Elden Ring&#x27;s premiere was at Keighley&#x27;s Game Awards broadcast, so it should have a big showing here. 


There are other, similarily big games featured, too, hinting we may see more over the next week. The trailer features glimpses of the upcoming Dragon Ball Sparking! Zero and what looks to be the next Batman game, the Meta-exclusive Batman: Arkham Shadow. 


Summer Game Fest will air live on various platforms, including YouTube and Twitch, on Friday, June 7, at 5 PM ET/2 PM PT. The show will be a live production with trailers, reveals, and news of the biggest games from a plethora of devs. 


In addition to the main SGF show, there are a number of highly anticipated ancillary programs over the surrounding days, including Devolver Direct and the much-hyped Xbox Games Showcase + Call of Duty Direct. 


There will also be some kind of Nintendo Direct soon, though details remain scarce. Though Nintendo is unaffiliated with Summer Game Fest, they do tend to schedule their presentations around the same weekend, so it may be sooner rather than later.

                              <span>A leak from a reasonably reliable source seems to hint that the Rabbids, Rayman&#x27;s iconic lagomorphic foils, could soon appear as a joinable faction in XDefiant. Where&#x27;s the limbless wonder when you need him?


The leak comes to us courtesy of AgainTx, a data miner who has provided credible information about weapons, abilities, and features that made their way into XDefiant after the game&#x27;s initial launch. According to AgainTx, the Rabbids are just one of several new factions that will debut in XDefiant&#x27;s second year. Many of these factions are based on Ubisoft games that have not yet received any representation in XDefiant, including Assassins Creed, Rainbow Six, and The Crew.


Unfortunately, many of AgainTx&#x27;s posts regarding this potential leak have been taken down to do copywrite strikes made against them by Ubisoft. While this means I can&#x27;t technically back up AgainTx&#x27;s claims, the fact that Ubisoft is going out of its way to censor their content does lend an air of credibility to them and their work.


If this leak turns out to be accurate, I&#x27;m amazed it&#x27;s taken this long for the Rabbids to appear in XDefiant. The Rabbids have come a long way since their debut in Rayman: Raving Rabbids back on the Wii, to the point where they&#x27;ve effectively become the unofficial Ubisoft mascots. While I&#x27;m not afraid to admit that I feel the Rabbids&#x27; whole &quot;so-random&quot; schtick is a little played out, I&#x27;d be lying If I said I&#x27;m not excited by the sheer madness they could introduce into the straight-laced world of a first-person shooter like XDefiant.


Of course, this is still all speculation, and there is a real possibility that AgainTx will be proven wrong once XDefiant&#x27;s second year starts. Only time will tell, but it seems like this leak could be a fun, or at least funny, one if it turns out to be true.

                              <span>Fans who were looking forward to Little Nightmares III will unfortunately have to hold on, as the game has now been delayed. 


In a post on the official Little Nightmares Twitter, developer Supermassive Games revealed the game was being delayed, and would now release in 2025. 




&quot;As much as we can&#x27;t wait for you to return to the Nowhere, we also want to make sure we give the game the care and love it deserves.&quot; Supermassive said in the statement. &quot;Quality is a top priority for us, and we know you feel the same way. For this reason, we&#x27;ve made the decision to shift the game to 2025.&quot;


&quot;We&#x27;ll be sharing more about Little Nightmares III later this summer, so please bear with us and look forward to further updates.&quot; the developer promised. 


Little Nightmares III was announced in 2023 with a 2024 release window. It is the first in the franchise to be developed by Supermassive. The game will follow two young protagonists, Low and Alone, as they explore a haunting 2.5D world that focuses on exploration, platforming, and puzzles. 


The previous games in the franchise were developed by Swedish-based Tarsier Studios, who had to leave the franchise when they were acquired by Embracer Group after the release of Little Nightmares II. Tarsier Studios does not currently have an announced project. 


Little Nightmares has been a cherished franchise since its 2017 launch. The original game followed Six, a girl who had to escape the horrifying vessel known as The Maw. Though Six retuned for 2021&#x27;s Little Nightmares II, the character and compatriot Mono do not appear to be returning for Little Nightmares III.

                              <span>The relaunch of Multiversus has already been a fairly divisive affair, but fans took note that the game was missing some features. However, the dev assures the game is bringing those features back. 


Several features that were available in what PlayerFirst and the community are generously calling the Beta were missing, which obviously rubbed fans the wrong way. 


But Tony Huynh, the co-founder of Player 1st Games, took to social media to assure fans that those features would be restored soon. 






&quot;Many of these features are currently implemented and are in testing and we had planned, but were left out due to time as we had to rebuild every screen and feature again to support our new netcode and Unreal Engine 5 switch.&quot; Huynh revealed on his Twitter/X account. 


When Multiversus finally returned after its long hiatus, fans were quick to note features were missing that had added to the game&#x27;s online multiplayer. These components included leaderboards, match stats, a co-op vs AI mode, and a Smash Bros-like free-for-all mode that added random items. 


Also missing was the ability to play as an unowned character in training mode. Without this option, players are left with no means of test-driving a new character without unlocking them.


In their place was a brand new season pass with unlockables and a new single-player driven &quot;Rift&quot; mode.  The reception to the new Multiversus has been fairly mixed, but hopefully this is just a small bump for this already controversial game.

Call of Duty&#x27;s Zombies mode is a staple of the franchise, with complex lore, a sprawling multiverse, varied maps, and numerous now-iconic original characters behind it. Not to mention, more than a few celebrity guests have gotten in on the zombie-killing action.


While the likes of Tank Dempsey (Steve Blum), Dr. Edward Richtofen (Nolan North), and Samantha Maxis (Julie Nathanson) have carried the mode from game to game, several notable pop culture favorites have briefly come along for the ride. Malcolm McDowell, Jeff Goldblum, the late Ray Liotta, and more have featured in the mode, and that&#x27;s just in Treyarch&#x27;s titles.

Some Exotic armor effects are due for tweaks, both to support the new Prismatic Subclass and to adjust the meta as needed.


Bungie has been using the window up to The Final Shape&#x27;s release to highlight how Destiny 2 would change. The studio has already detailed some new Exotics and what players could expect from weapons in the new expansion, and now it&#x27;s showing the alterations being made to existing Exotic armor.

Pinc yourselves — May is over, the big Summer of Gaming is here, and it&#x27;s eShop Selects time again. Time flies!
To say May has been crazy is a bit of an understatement. Nintendo may have had two big(ish) releases with Endless Ocean Luminous and Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door, but have you seen the indies this month? We&#x27;re practically drowning. But as always, we have a job to do — our staff and contributors vote for their top three eShop games from the list of games we&#x27;ve reviewed, and we give you the winners (and the best that didn&#x27;t quite make the top)

This time trainers can get their hands on a Talonflame based on the one featured at last year&#x27;s Japanese Championships and distributed to also celebrate the same event this year (thanks, Serebii.net).

We are back, back, back for another edition of Box Art Brawl!
Before we dive into this week&#x27;s topical match-up, let&#x27;s recap what went down last time. Two 3DS covers for Bravely Default went head-to-head in our last duel and great Scott, was it a close one! The European &#x27;For the Sequel&#x27; version put up a good fight but was narrowly beaten by the OG Japanese &#x27;Flying Fairy&#x27; version which grabbed 51% of the vote. Talk about a photo finish.

This title was initially revealed during a &quot;sneak peek&quot; in May last year, and during the latest broadcast, the game&#x27;s product manager Takehiro Ishida introduced viewers to the game&#x27;s intro video, which you can see at the beginning of the video above.

We&#x27;re now at the halfway mark of the year for 2024 and it&#x27;s been a blast on the Switch so far with games like Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door. Thankfully, there&#x27;s even more on the way in terms of first-party exclusives, with the 3DS title Luigi&#x27;s Mansion 2 making a return this month in HD.
As for third-party releases, it&#x27;s just as exciting with Capcom&#x27;s 3DS game Monster Hunter Stories also being revived for the Switch, and the Atlus title Shin Megami Tensei V making an encore with &#x27;Vegeance&#x27; - a definitive version.

Did you know that the word &#x27;book&#x27; was originally spelled with several extra &#x27;o&#x27;s in it? This was changed when it was collectively decided that telling someone to &quot;please, just read a book&quot; was resulting in several more murders a year than anyone could be bothered to keep track of. This week, it’s Obsidian vet and Pentiment creator Josh Sawyer! Cheers Josh! Mind if we have a nose at your bookshelf?

Before I barge into the comments uninvited and argue with no-one in particular that Doom Eternal’s lateral expansion of its gameplay loop was ultimately a fantastic choice for the long-term health of the series, you swine, let’s read this week’s best writing about games (and game related things!)

The Dutchman has never hidden away and has continuously claimed his service operates legally. If only in part, it&#x27;s still streaming channels right now.

There I&#x27;m in my element due to a lifetime of Mario Kart, Diddy Kong Racing and Sonic &amp; All-Stars Racing Transformed. It&#x27;s those games that make me interested in Nightmare Kart, a PSX-aesthetic racing game which was formerly known as Bloodborne Kart, and which is out now.

Omenroad turns out to be the end of the road, however, both for Wildermyth and - for now - for the team that made it, Worldwalker Games.

Early positive sentiment was quickly scuppered by bugs, slow updates and more. Now its developers say that they&#x27;re ending support for the game, and multiplayer functionality will be switched off this September.

A bunch of us have recently returned from trips down to the Brighton office to meet some new faces. Weird to think I&#x27;m now the most far-flung of the lot, living way up here in Glasgow. Maybe that&#x27;s why I elected to take over these Playing This Weekend posts, to help fill the friendless void growing inside my heart.
So just know that if you don&#x27;t sound off in the comments below with news of what you&#x27;re playing this weekend, the void in my heart will grow, until one day it consumes me. And then who will write these posts? Here&#x27;s what we&#x27;re clicking on this weekend!

                              <span>In 2024, one of the most popular and recognizable non-Marvel or DC Comics creations turned 30: Hellboy. Yes, the Dark Horse Comics staple has been around for three decades now, having appeared in some truly remarkable print stories along the way. Of course, given his icon status, it&#x27;s no surprise that Anung Un Rama has transcended the comic book medium on numerous occasions.


Since his first wide-release story, 1994&#x27;s Seed of Destruction, Hellboy has tried out numerous mediums. He&#x27;s a merchandise mover with plenty of t-shirts, action figures, and posters to show for it. He has popped up at the movies three times, with Ron Perlman and David Harbour taking him on. Hellboy has even made the jump to animation. Not to mention, he has also cracked paranormal cases in the video game realm.

                              <span>With the third and final season of Star Wars: The Bad Batch and the miniseries Tales of the Empire now firmly in the rearview mirror, the Star Wars franchise is revving up for yet another new addition. The first live-action series in some time, Star Wars: The Acolyte aims to take viewers back in time. Long before the Empire, long before the Clone Wars, there was the Jedi Order, the Republic, and a mysterious, powerful force seeking to destroy them both.


The Acolyte takes audiences a century ahead of Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace as a group of Jedi attempt to sort out a criminal conspiracy. Jedi are being killed left and right and no one knows who is responsible. This intriguing tale comes from series creator and showrunner Leslye Headland, who&#x27;s no stranger to the Star Wars g…</span>

There are a whole string of Doctors and Doctor-adjacent characters, such as Jackson Lake, who briefly believed himself to be an incarnation of the Doctor after having his memories altered by a Cyberman, who appear throughout the series. While I haven’t mentioned all of them here, I’ve taken what I consider to be the man faces and ranked them.

                              <span>Rivers of London was written by author Ben Aaronovitch and is a masterful series set mostly around the city of London in the UK that blends grounded police policies, a fantastical world within our own, and Aaronovitch&#x27;s own excruciatingly precise memory for the details of London&#x27;s streets. 


When I first picked this series up, I thought I&#x27;d be reading a murder mystery novel set in London that was grounded and offered a good twist ending. That&#x27;s not what I got, but I&#x27;m so glad it wasn&#x27;t because the Rivers of London series is so much better. The series has grown over time and now encompasses smaller novellas, meaning it can be difficult to understand what order to read them all. But don&#x27;t worry because I&#x27;ve got you covered with the definitive reading list.

                              <span>My Hero Academia&#x27;s pitch is quite simple. It tells the story of a young powerless boy who aspires to be a superhero. Despite the numerous twists and turns, the series remains loyal to that idea. Izuku Midoriya&#x27;s hero journey started when All Might chose him to inherit One For All — the very same Quirk that allowed a Quirkless All Might to become the symbol of justice.


Initially, One For All is thought to only grant immense strength. As such, the user&#x27;s body must be strong enough to endure the strain of releasing that much explosive power. But as the story progressed, the mysteries involving One For All slowly unraveled. It turned out that One For All not only passes superstrength from one user to another but also the Quirks the previous users wielded.

Elfen Lied&#x27;s Poster


Elfen Lied has arguably the most famously gruesome opening in the history of anime. The series never reaches those all-time gory heights again, opting instead to create a very heartwarming narrative where the evil monster loses their memory and becomes the nicest creature on earth. The true horror of Elfen Lied lies in the constant fear of wondering if the beautiful tale will once again turn bad,…</span>

                              <span>One-Punch Man is known for housing some of the anime world&#x27;s zaniest characters, but don&#x27;t let their inconspicuous appearance fool you. Many of One-Punch Man&#x27;s characters are insanely strong, to the point that obliterating Earth would be comparable to a grocery run. If you&#x27;re wondering which characters I&#x27;m talking about, then scroll on.


Before anything else, however, a warning is necessary. Some characters and details from recent manga developments are included in this article. If you&#x27;re one of the many (me included) waiting for the elusive third season of the anime and still haven&#x27;t caught up to the manga, then don&#x27;t scroll on.

The average Demon Slayer may be able to fight and even eliminate lower-ranked demons on their own, but they are helpless prey to stronger ones, especially the Upper Ranks. The only Demon Slayers who can match these powerful monsters are the Hashira.


The Hashira are the strongest Demon Slayers


The Hashira is the highest achievable rank for a Demon Slayer. Unlike many organizations, the Hashira title is earned and not just handed out, especially since the Hashira are the strongest warriors among all the Demon Slayers.

I always envied the way athletes carried themselves and the opportunities they got over the perceived &quot;nerds.&quot; For years, I held onto this sentiment until Haikyu!! changed my mind for the better. 


I still remember the day when my partner, who was the epitome of a first-rate jock in school, started to watch it. I glanced at it several times but ignored it due to my aforementioned distaste for sports. But I eventually gave in after she explained how much it perfectly captured her own past athletic journey.

                              <span>It doesn&#x27;t take a genius to figure out that Demon Slayer is all about demon slaying. However, that is easier said than done, as those actual demons are in no way weak. 


Eliminating even the tiniest of demons is already a laudable feat; which is why the titular group constantly hones its forces in preparation to face the mightiest of foes. But, interestingly enough, the one at its helm is not a swordsman with unparalleled skills but a dying man named Kagaya Ubuyashiki. 


Kagaya Ubuyashiki has always been painted as physically pained. Despite attempting to train himself in swordsmanship, his body simply cannot endure the physical strain. And in the latest season of the Demon Slayer anime, the Hashira Training Arc, Kagaya has become too weak to even sit down and face the Hashira. So, what&#x27;…</span>

The stories provide windows into the lives of side characters while also providing various art styles starkly contrasting with the main series. 


Without much ado, here is an explanation of every One Piece manga spinoff, all of which can be found on VizMedia.


Ace&#x27;s Story




Ace&#x27;s Story begins by following Ace on his pirating adventures before joining the White Beard Pirates. To avoid heavy spoilers, I won&#x27;t discuss the plot details or nuances. I will say that, as a fan of both Ace and One Piece as a whole, I thoroughly enjoyed this spinoff and highly recommend it.

The Team of the Season events introduced special cards from all five major European leagues. EA Sports also introduced the TOTS lineup from the women&#x27;s leagues, along with names from the rest of the world. The list of available choices has never been longer, which also makes it tricky to identify the best EA FC 24 TOTS players for all positions.


Best EA FC 24 TOTS players by position


Thanks to the vast number of TOTS cards released in Ultimate Team, every position is pretty well covered. EA Sports has also released TOTS Plus items, which make it easier for players to keep squad chemistry pretty high even if they&#x27;re using items from the Mixed Leagues.

Episode 8 release date: June 30, 2024 





The fourth season of Demon Slayer releases weekly every Sunday. Each release time is around 10:45 AM PT. Simply convert the time zone to your respective area&#x27;s time zone. 


Ufotable, the animation studio responsible for Demon Slayer, always does consistent weekly releases. They have no planned breaks for the season. Therefore, each episode should be released promptly on Sunday.


Unlike the previous seasons, which were all over 10 episodes long, Demon Slayer Hashira Training Arc is rumored to be far shorter. As of now, there appears to be no official announcement -- but many in the community are in resounding agreement that it&#x27;ll be eight episodes. This speculation is based on the length of the arc in the manga, which is only eight chapters long, making for roughly one episode per chapter. 


If they officially announce the number of episodes, expect this article to be updated with the appropriate information.

How to complete Breaking Brick Mountains in Final Fantasy XIV


Screenshot by Destructoid


If you want to take part in Breaking Brick Mountains, head to Ul’dah and talk to Havak Alvak on the Steps of Nald (X:12.1, Y:8.2) directly opposite the Adventurer’s Guild. After some discussion, you’ll find that you need to take part in a couple of FATEs:



Brick by Stone Brick


Brick by Gold Brick



These FATEs spawn directly after one another in the same location, and there are five different locations where they can possibly spawn:



Sil&#x27;dih Excavation Site, Central Thanalan (X:18.0, Y:23.5)


Blind Iron Mines, Lower La Noscea (X:27.0, Y:17.3)


Camp Bronze Lake, Upper La Noscea (X:34.1, Y:24.1)


Bentbranch Meadows, Central Shroud (X:23.6, Y:23.9)


Finders’ Bluff, North Shroud (X:15.8, Y:31.0)



Once you’ve completed these two FATEs, head back to Ul’dah - Steps of Nald and talk to the Burly Businessman (X:8.2, Y:12.4). This will complete the event quest and reward you with the following items:



Thug’s Mug


Wind-up Brickman

To get the iconic King Slime Crown, you’ll need to have completed the main quest of the Breaking Brick Mountains, including the FATEs. 


Once you’ve done this, Talk to Toughie in Ul’dah - Steps of Nald, where you will now be able to purchase the King Slime crown for 57 Gil.

He created Killer7, the No More Heroes series, worked with James Gunn (before he directed Guardians of the Galaxy or was put in charge of DC films) on Lollipop Chainsaw, and lots more. In preparation for his role as the keynote speaker at MomoCon this year, we caught up with him over e-mail to discuss his next game, Hotel Barcelona (a collaboration with Deadly Premonition creator Hidetaka &quot;Swery65&quot; Suehiro), remastering his 2011 game Shadows of the Damned, Batman, and more.
Game Informer: Hotel Barcelona is inspired by horror films. Are there specific films you cite as references?
Goichi &quot;Suda51&quot; Suda: There are a lot of them. Swery of White Owls is the main creator, so you should probably ask him …</span>

No, you can&#x27;t go back and read it again to get younger. Time marches on, so thank you for spending your precious seconds on this silly intro. We&#x27;ll get to the point.
&#x27;Retro games&#x27; — how do you classify them? Do you count years, generations, or is there some other personal metric you use to delineate between what&#x27;s &#x27;old&#x27; in the realm of video games? Do you need to be able to count the pixels with the naked eye?

Overmorrow, the debut release from solo developer PixelManta, manages to be philosophically interesting, is evocatively written, visually distinct, and lovingly crafted. Yet, the notion of re-playing it – which you’ll effectively need to do by design – is a tall order, and therein lies the unfortunate problem with this otherwise commendable maiden indie effort.
When we reported on Overmorrow’s central mechanic of a player’s save data being deleted after 30 in-game days, the comment section was abuzz with discussion over the merits of such game design. A player’s time is precious, and holding a sword of Damocles over save data is one of the most provocative decisions a developer can make.

Almost a year ago, Limited Run Games announced that it was working on a rerelease of Tomba!, the PlayStation 2.5D platformer. And after nearly 12 months of silence, Tomba! has re-emerged, and it&#x27;s coming to Switch on 1st August 2024 (thanks, Gematsu!).
Tomba! Special Edition is an enhanced rerelease created for modern consoles using the Carbon engine. Plus, original creator Tokuro Fujiwara has been working with LRG to bring the classic back to life. It&#x27;s not just a straight remaster, either — Special Edition adds new features to the 1997 classic to help introduce the game to a whole new audience.

                              <span>&quot;Collaboration contents from outside Capcom will not be carried over&quot;.
The Nintendo 3DS had plenty of incredible exclusives and in its heyday, a lot of those were in the Monster Hunter series. One gem that truly stands out from its no-glasses-3D siblings is Monster Hunter Stories. Developed as a collaboration between Capcom and Marvelous, this turn-based RPG was quite a massive departure in comparison to anything that&#x27;s come before and is highly regarded by those that did play it. However, Stories was overlooked by many at the time as it was dealt the unfortunate hand of launching six months after the console that would replace the 2DS and 3DS, the Nintendo Switch.
Flash forward to the year 2024, and not only has a Switch sequel to Stories released, but that first game that fans loved so much is finally making its way to Switch, too. We had the chance to send off a few questions to the Monster Hunter Stories team at Capcom and the game&#x27;s producer, Yoshihiro Akira, was kind enough to give us his insight on the game&#x27;s co-development with Marvelous, 3DS-exclusive features, and what it&#x27;s like bringing this game to a new audience.

Super Rare Games has today revealed its physical copies of the 2023 monster-catching RPG Cassette Beasts and they look wonderful.
Releasing on 6th June (and expected to ship in July/August) the physical version comes in both a Standard and Deluxe edition — with varying amounts of bonus goodies depending on which you choose. Both boxed copies include the two Cassette Beasts DLCs, &#x27;Pier of the Unknown&#x27; and &#x27;Cosplay Pack&#x27; too.

StreetPass was fantastic — StreetPass is fantastic — and last year our intrepid video producer Zion Grassl went on a personal quest to see how many tags he could get for the glorious little inter-console app...

At the start of 2023, I had a real longing for the days of the 3DS. Partially due to the fact the 3DS and Wii U eShop would be going down that year, but also because I had almost entirely failed to find any random StreetPass tags in the year prior. What once was such a common activity that I didn’t think much of, was now made a rare and celebratory experience. Sometimes ya just don’t know what ya got till it’s gone, right?

After being revealed at last year&#x27;s Gamescom Opening Night Live with a 2024 date attached, Little Nightmares III has today been delayed to 2025.
The announcement from developer Supermassive Games and publisher Bandai Namco Europe stated that the delay has been made so that the team can &quot;give the game the care and love it deserves&quot;. No specific date has been provided at the moment, though the announcement does say that we can expect to hear more news on the horror platformer &quot;later this summer&quot;.

Prominent leaker Midori (みどり) seems to have been giving Pyoro a run for their money recently, leaking details of unannounced gaming projects from multiple publishers, including Nintendo.
However, rather than outright hinting at upcoming announcements, Midori is putting more focus on project codenames. So while we may be getting a view of potential games in development over at Nintendo, we (and Midori, it seems) are currently unable to definitively confirm what these relate to.

As Nintendo&#x27;s internal software focus has switched to games for its as-yet-unannounced hardware, we&#x27;ve been enjoying a wave of lower-key ports, remakes, and remasters over the last year or so, in addition to the tentpole TOTKs and Mario Wonders of the world. The sun may be slowly setting on Switch, but quality revisits such as Metroid Prime Remastered, Super Mario RPG, and Paper Mario: TTYD hardly feel like stop-gaps. Even less exciting games like Mario vs. Donkey Kong and the upcoming Luigi&#x27;s Mansion 2 HD represent hearty late-gen fare, especially for players who never played the originals.
Still, if you are a returning player, you might be looking at the price tag for these games and raising an eyebrow. Nintendo has said in the past that it looks at pricing on a &quot;case-by-case&quot; basis, so here&#x27;s a look at the MSRP of all the recent Switch remasters/remakes/ports it&#x27;s published since the beginning of 2023:

The latest Pokémon Scarlet and Violet 7-Star Tera Raid Battle event has gotten underway today, finally giving players the chance to catch a Swampert (thanks, Serebii.net).
The fully-evolved Gen III starter doesn&#x27;t usually show its face in Paldean encounters — though you can grab a Mudkip thanks to the Indigo Disk DLC&#x27;s Blueberry Academy addition, of course — so this is a good chance to snatch one up.

Now during this year&#x27;s showcase, the Story of Seasons series manager Hikaru Nakano has provided a development update and another look at the project. The brief video reveals fireworks, a glider, updated natural lighting, and the return of fan-favourite pets.

Overall, sites are still being blocked in large numbers, but the real growth isn&#x27;t found on main domains. Easily and quickly deployed at almost no cost, subdomains can circumvent blocking and Spain blocks them in their thousands.

                              <span>After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora&#x27;s Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora&#x27;s Mask&#x27;s unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 1:00 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved.

                              <span>Toys for Bob, the developer of Crash Bandicoot 4 and the Skylanders series, has announced a publishing deal with Xbox for its next game. The studio recently went independent after splitting off from its former parent company, Activision Blizzard.
The studio states its new title is &quot;very early in development&quot; and that we won&#x27;t see it for some time. Whatever this game is, Xbox will be its home, which isn&#x27;t surprising since the studio teased it was exploring a relationship with the publisher a couple of months ago.
We&#x27;re excited to announce that we&#x27;ll be partnering with @Xbox to publish our next new game. We&#x27;re still very early in development, so you might not hear from us for a bit - but know that we&#x27;re working hard on an experience we&#x27;re so sooo inspired about!

Toys For Bob went independent in February, a few months after Microsoft acquired Activision Blizzard. The studio is seemingly getting to have its cake and eat it too, since it still gets to work with Xbox while being an autonomous entity. Prior to leaving Activision, Toys For Bob worked on the recent Crash Bandicoot games such as Crash Bandicoot 4: It&#x27;s About Time and Crash Team Rumble. It also developed the Spyro Reignited Trilogy and created the once-wildly popular Skylanders series.

Marvel Rivals is a superhero (specifically Marvel superhero) team-based PVP shooter inspired by games like Overwatch. The footage, seen below, reveals Venom and Adam Warlock are coming to the game. The footage also shows a new location – the Tokyo 2099: Spider-Islands map.
Alongside the new gameplay details, the game is now also confirmed to be coming to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S alongside the previously confirmed PC platform. Developer NetEase is also planning a closed beta for the game in July. PlayStation beta testers will have exclusive access to Spider-Man&#x27;s Scarlet Spider cosmetic skin.

                              <span>Little Nightmares III, the horror action platformer from Supermassive Games, has moved into 2025. The game never had a specific release date, but we were admittedly expecting it this year. In a post on the official Little Nightmares III X account, the team shared the message below, writing, &quot;As much as we can&#x27;t wait for you to return to the Nowhere, we also want to make sure we give the game the care and love it deserves. Quality is a top priority for us, and we know you feel the same way. For this reason, we&#x27;ve made the decision to shift the release of the game to 2025.&quot;
Please do bear with us, little ones, for we need a little extra time to prepare your visit.

Notably, Supermassive, the developer behind games like Until Dawn (which is coming to PC and PlayStation 5 soon) did not develop the first two games. Those games were developed by Tarsier Studios, whose next project has not been announced.

                              <span>If you haven’t followed Infinity Nikki, it’s equal parts charming, beautiful, and ambitious. The open-world game is the latest entry in the Nikki series of fashion games, which is very popular in Asia, and Westerners are getting their biggest exposure to it yet with this charming adventure. 


The game unfolds on the magical continent of Miraland, and Nikki must save it. Her main power is &quot;styling,&quot; which involves changing clothes from different nations, allowing her to adopt unique abilities. For example, one outfit allows her to float while another cleanses corrupted creatures of demonic energy. The trailer shows one outfit that lets players summon a giant flower to glide through the air. Another ability shrinks her to the size of her small companion, Momo, to access tight areas and other locations. 
The more outfits you collect, the more abilities Nikki has to solve puzzles and overcome platforming obstacles. But despite the &quot;save the world&quot; premise, Infinity Nikki is billed as a relaxing adventure. You can also catch bugs, go fishing, and gather resources to craft new outfits, among other activities. 
Infinity Nikki looks wild, and fans can get their first taste of it in a beta test happening during Q3 of this year. The game is coming to PlayStation 5, PC, iOS, and Android but has no release window.</span>

Path of Exile 2 on console will introduce couch co-op and supports cross-play and cross-progression. Despite Sony not having an official early access program, the game will be playable on the platform when early access begins on PC.

                              <span>Developer Survios has released the first look at gameplay in its upcoming VR game, Alien: Rogue Incursion, and it turns out, exploring a seemingly abandoned  facility in VR looks as terrifying as you&#x27;d expect.
The trailer aired during today&#x27;s PlayStation State of Play as the game is coming to PS VR2, but it&#x27;s also coming to Meta Quest 3 and Steam (for other PC VR devices) this holiday season. In the trailer, we get a few glimpses of some Xenomorphs, the tracking device we&#x27;ll be using to avoid said Xenomorphs, and a look at some pods that indicate we might be fighting more than one. 
Check it out for yourself in the Alien: Rogue Incursion gameplay trailer below: 


In a new PlayStation Blog post, Survios chief product officer TQ Jefferson explains that Alien: Rogue Incursion was developed from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5. Jefferson also shares that the &quot;high tension shooter&quot; tasks players with exploring an &quot;overrun facility on the inhospitable planet Purdan.&quot; 
&quot;Dynamically spawning and pathing with countless unique possibilities, even we couldn&#x27;t tell you exactly where and when each Xenomorph will strike, let alone what strategies it might use or if it&#x27;ll bring some friends,&quot; the blog post reads. &quot;While heart-pounding combat is the core of Alien: Rogue Incursion, grabbing your pulse rifle and blasting your way out of every situation is not always the best strategy. 
&quot;Constantly hunted by unpredictable and resourceful Xenomorphs, players will often find creativity and a level head to be their greatest weapons, especially when it comes to leveraging the environment to their advantage.&quot; 
Alien: Rogue Incursion hits VR this holiday season.

                              <span>Until Dawn, the 2015 horror adventure game from Supermassive Games, is coming to PlayStation 5 and PC in remake form this fall. We received a new trailer for the beloved game alongside the announcement during today&#x27;s State of Play presentation. 
Until Dawn puts you in control of eight teenagers/young adults who venture up a mountain for a fun night in a secluded cabin. In typical slasher-movie fashion, there is much more than meets the eye regarding this cabin and its surrounding area. Relying heavily on player choice, Until Dawn&#x27;s narrative uses a system called the Butterfly Effect, where pivotal choices you make have consequences that go far beyond that which you can immediately recognize. The game stars actors like Rami Malek, Hayden Panettiere, Meaghan Martin, and more.


Originally announced as a full remake of the game, the trailer footage does not appear to be a significant step up in terms of visuals, appearing to be more in line with the industry&#x27;s definition of a remaster. PlayStation&#x27;s official description says it&#x27;s been &quot;rebuilt and enhanced for PS5 consoles and PC.&quot; Developed by Ballistic Moon, this improved version also boasts new environments, collectibles, and re-cut narrative sequences. 
We loved Until Dawn when it arrived on PlayStation 4 in 2015, awarding it a score of 9 out of 10. In the time since Until Dawn&#x27;s original release, Supermassive has released other games in the genre, including The Dark Pictures Anthology and The Quarry. The studio is currently working on The Casting of Frank Stone, a game set in the Dead by Daylight universe. Until Dawn arrives on PlayStation 5 and PC this fall.</span>

                              <span>It’s been a long time since we wrote about a new Dynasty Warriors game, but that changes today with the announcement of Dynasty Warriors: Origins, the new release from Koei Tecmo’s Omega Force studio, a team long known for work on the venerable franchise.
The games have an unusual identity and are, in some ways, a genre unto themselves. They almost always feature large-scale battles in which the lead character can sweep through dozens of enemy combatants with a single swing.
That playstyle appears to remain intact if this new trailer is to be believed.
A lot has changed in action gameplay in the years since Dynasty Warriors was at its most popular, but there’s no doubt that the series once had an enthusiastic fanbase.
We’ll see if the series is able to update its gameplay and draw in new fans when it hits PlayStation 5 next year.</span>

                              <span>Today&#x27;s State of Play concluded with the reveal of a new Astro Bot game. Unlike the last entry, Astro&#x27;s Playroom, which was a PS5 launch title and a glorified (but very fun) tech demo for the console, this new game is a full-fledged platforming adventure. It&#x27;s also got an easy-to-remember name: Astro Bot. 
The trailer sees Astro Bot soaring through the galaxy on a Dual Sense-shaped spaceship to explore a variety of vibrant platforming stages set to a smile-inducing soundtrack. He also shows off new abilities like donning gloves that fire springs to grab and swing enemies, soaking water like a sponge to grow gigantic, and, best of all, just a random Parappa the Rappa reference (among other PlayStation franchises). It looks delightful, and we want to play it. 


A PlayStation Blog post also states the game features over 80 levels across 6 galaxies, 20 new abilities, and 70 new enemy types. Astro Bot will be available on PlayStation 5 on September 6. Our review of Astro&#x27;s Playroom can be found here.</span>

                              <span>The remake of Silent Hill 2 has a new trailer and a release date of October 8. Surprisingly, this news comes during Sony’s State of Play instead of the Silent Hill Transmission airing later tonight. 
Regardless, we aren’t complaining about seeing more of Bloober Team’s remake of the PS2 classic. The trailer provides new looks at gameplay and the psychological scares that made the first game so beloved. 


Silent Hill 2 is coming to PlayStation 5 as a console exclusive as well as PC.</span>

                              <span>Capcom has pulled back the curtains on Monster Hunter Wilds, revealing gameplay in a brand new trailer that aired during today&#x27;s PlayStation State of Play. In this trailer, we watch a monster hunter ride through a treacherous sandstorm on the back of a mount before starting a fight with a lion-like bear creature, and as you might expect, it looks great. 
We then watch our hunter fight a rocky toad monster in a cavernous canyon area before three buffalo-esque monsters join the fight. If you&#x27;ve played a Monster Hunter before, you have a good idea of what Wilds looks like – big, flashy, and exciting. 
Check it out for yourself in the Monster Hunter Wilds trailer below: 


This is our first look at Monster Hunter Wilds since its reveal at The Game Awards 2023 last December. Those with Monster Hunter World and Monster Hunter World: Iceborne save date will get exclusive in-game rewards. The trailer also reiterates that Monster Hunter Wild hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC in 2025.

                              <span>Today’s PlayStation State of Play brought a lengthy new trailer for Where Winds Meet, an upcoming action game from Everstone Studio. The Chinese studio describes its project as “Groundbreaking Oriental Wuxia Open World” on its official website. Today’s trailer seems to bear that out, with a number of bombastic and over-the-top scenes featuring high-flying martial arts against the backdrop of rainswept forests, burning castles, and warriors wielding sword and spear.
Today’s video makes it clear that the game is in development for PlayStation 5, but no word yet on a release date.</span>

                              <span>PlayStation has announced it is bringing its 2022 hit PlayStation-exclusive game, God of War Ragnarök, to PC. It revealed this during today&#x27;s State of Play with a new trailer alongside a September 19 release date. 
This follows PlayStation&#x27;s recent trend of bringing its single-player, narrative-driven games over to PC years after they first launch on PlayStation. Just this month, it brought Ghost of Tsushima Director&#x27;s Cut to PC, and today, PlayStation CEO Hermen Hulst revealed all live-service games will launch day-and-date on PS5 and PC while &quot;tentpole&quot; single-player games will launch at later dates on PC. 
As you might expect, the PC version of God of War Ragnarök will feature unlocked frame rates, Nvidia DLSS 3.7. (and AMD FSR 3.1 and Intel XESS 1.3), super ultrawide support, and other PC features. This version of Ragnarök will feature the free Valhalla DLC from last year, too, and pre-purchasing the game gets you in-game rewards like the Kratos Risen Snow Armor and Atreus Risen Snow Tunic. 
Check it out for yourself below in the God of War Ragnarök PC reveal trailer: 


According to the game&#x27;s Steam listing, it will require a PlayStation Network account. 
God of War Ragnarök hits PC on September 19, 2024.

                              <span>Today’s State of Play revealed a new fantasy action game called Ballad of Antara. The trailer shows all manner of over-the-top stylish combat against supernatural foes. However, the hero does all of this while carrying a small child on his back.


Ballad of Antara is billed as an Unreal Engine 5 single-player, free-to-play action RPG starring multiple characters called Emissaries. Each of these characters sports their own class and abilities, as well as a unique story. Players will travel between two worlds seeking out these Emissaries to strengthen your force, but the young girl being carried around is the apparently the key to salvation. A PlayStation Blog post on the game describes your duty to her as such: &quot;You will help her undo the devastation done to this desolate world through trials, twists, and confrontation, and witness her growth along the way.&quot;
In addition to a single-player story, the game lets up to three players explore together in multiplayer, whether they be close buddies or total strangers wandering the game alongside you. Developer Tipworks also states plans to continually update Ballad of Antara post-launch with new zones, story content, and Emissaries. 
Ballad of Antara is coming to PS5, PC, and mobile platforms in 2025.</span>

                              <span>PlayStation has formally revealed Concord, the first game from Firewalk Studios, which it acquired in 2023, and it brings a healthy (and comedic dose) of sci-fi to the console&#x27;s 2024 lineup. Concord is both the start of a new sci-fi IP for PlayStation and a five-versus-five-player multiplayer shooter coming to PlayStation 5 and PC this year. 
Before showcasing some third-person shooter gameplay, a vignette setting up the game&#x27;s world and tone played, and it&#x27;s here we get a look at its Guardians of the Galaxy-esque action. We see several characters who appear to make up the rag-tag group of heroes we&#x27;ll be controlling, each with seemingly unique abilities, attempting to capture a special device from someone attempting to escape a rundown locale called Crater City. 
Check it out for yourself in the Concord cinematic reveal below: 


After this vignette, PlayStation showcased our first look at Concord&#x27;s gameplay. We get a look at Vale, a sniper, Lennox, a cowboy-esque revolver shooter, Haymar, who uses a magical bow and arrow, Star Child, a brutish shotgun user, and 1-Off, a support character who appears to use support-type elemental moves. The gameplay looks reminiscent of Destiny 2&#x27;s PvP modes, although brighter in color and more fantastical in visual design. 
Check out the Concord gameplay reveal for yourself below:


After the gameplay, some of the Firewalk developers spoke about what players can expect, including deployable gear that can exist throughout a full game (across multiple rounds) and asymmetrical match-ups between players. While the gameplay only showcased five characters, a quick look at the game&#x27;s roster revealed several more. 
Firewalk says every week when you log on to Concord, you&#x27;ll be treated to a short cutscene vignette teaching you more about the characters. 
Firewalk and PlayStation will hold a beta on PS5 and PC this July before the game&#x27;s simultaneous launch on those platforms on August 23, 2024.

Announced a few weeks back, Redfall game update 4 introduces a much-requested offline mode and single-player pausing, together with some new progression features and activities: a Community Standing bar whereby Support currency can be spent on rewards from the Safehouse Skill tree, and Elder Nests, aka vampire nests with specially modified vampire bosses. That&#x27;s in addition to new enemy encounters in Redfall Commons, improved AI and a new Unrivaled Weapon.

                              <span>I regret not covering Skald Colon Against The Black Priory when its developer told us about it 2019. I&#x27;d get to be so smug now.
Skald is terrific. I&#x27;ve tried to come up with a clever angle on its journey, but they all wind up saying the same thing: For all its retro stylings (right down to party portraits taking up an unnecessary quarter of the screen at all times), it&#x27;s an accessible, charming treat, and the best modernisation of 80s RPGs that I&#x27;ve ever played.

                              <span>I fear we may have swum the Rubicon of diminishing returns where multiplayer horror games inspired by Lethal Company are concerned. The recent Content Warning has sucked up all the remaining oxygen in the room, and oxygen is pretty important in Murky Divers, for reasons that are hopefully self-evident. Still, Murky Divers has some fairly eye-catching USPs. It&#x27;s got underwater physics, of course, and it puts you and - unhelpfully - your friends in charge of a submarine.

                              <span>There is a time for perfect clarity in a shooter, for clean walls and clear-cut character silhouettes. But this is not it. Retro first-person gunwaltzer Selaco is a messy machine gun dash through an office exploding with glass, concrete, splinters, and sparks. The glock-toting wreckage &#x27;em up first hit our radar when it was announced as a modern combination of F.E.A.R. and Doom, promising both the fiendish AI enemies of the former and the satisfying blasting of the latter. Well, it&#x27;s out today. Bursting forth into the corporate lobby of early access with uzis akimbo, peppering the walls with angry bullets. Good, I say.

                              <span>In Mike Judge’s 1999 cult comedy Office Space, there’s a scene where Ron Livingston’s Peter - a programmer working a tedious corporate job - visits a hypnotist. “Is there any way that you could, sorta, just zonk me out so I don’t know that I’m at work, in here,” Peter asks of the hypnotist, pointing to his head. “Could I come home and think that I’ve been fishing all day, or something?”. That’s basically the high-level concept for brilliant sci-fi comedy show Severance, right there. Not wanting to spoil any more than I absolutely have to, I’ll present you with two facts up top. 1. It features a touching queer relationship between John Turturro and Christopher Walken and 2. It’s some of the best television I’ve seen in the last few years. Throw in some Stanley Parable, Control, Gilliam’s Brazil, and some more meta undertones of general musing on gamified reward loops, and you’ve got Severance.

                              <span>Between this, my supporter post later, and the fact I decided to watch Office Space again this week, I’d like to make it clear to any colleagues or management reading that I value and love them all dearly, and am 110% committed to the eternal grind machine of covering videogames online. Workday malaise is universal, however, whether or not you’re lucky enough to enjoy your job as much as I do. Enter Office Fight, a stylish physics action game where you, a ghost, posess office equipment to cause as much physics-based chaos as possible. The PR did some Office Space jokes in the email, so I pretty much had to cover it. At least once I realised what they were doing, after initially just thinking they were being a massive donkey.

The topic, comedy rock RPG/door-kicking sim Deathbulge: Battle of the Bands, was picked by a sadly absent Alice B, but you know what they say when beloved colleagues become ensnared in the kind of Kafkaesque employment limbo that only a corporate acquisition can engineer: the show must go on. We’re therefore sticking to the schedule, and will launch the liveblog at 4pm BST today, Friday May 31st.

                              <span>Riot games have committed to a series of new measures to curtail harassment and hate-speech in the Valorant community. In a video entitled ‘Keeping Our Community Healthy // Dev Updates,” studio head Anna Donlon took to Xitter to outline the new measures for the competitive FPS. Below is a graphic detailing the changes, which include new penalties such as hardware bans for offenders, and an expanded role for the game&#x27;s Voice Evaluation tech, which monitors chat for bad behaviour. “If you want to make evil statements under the guise of &#x27;[naughty word SEO doesn&#x27;t like being in the first paragraph] talk&#x27;, you aren&#x27;t welcome here,” writes the official Valorant account.

It showed off more of how its lovely desert environments morph to fit the weather and how its inhabitants largely don&#x27;t get on. We also got a look at some cursed lions, an armoured frog with an unsettling tongue and a rideable Chocobo-esque mount that lets you ping arrows on the fly. Let me break it down for you readers, as someone who is increasingly excited at the prospect of more colourful pants.

                              <span>This piece is being written on a train as I trundle towards our very first staff meeting with Rock Paper Shotgun&#x27;s new overlords. The morning is cloudy but bright and calm, the north London suburbs are a blissful checkerboard of red roofs and flourishing lawns, hope glistens faintly in the gutters and ditches beside the tube. How unlike the innards of Centum, a point-and-click horror game (Steam page here) that begins with a dreary retro desktop interface on which there are curious text files, curioser decryption tools and most curious of all, an .exe of some kind that drops you into a simulation consisting of a stone prison chamber. Hang on, I&#x27;m changing trains...

                              <span>My PC has a big white case, and sometimes, I sit and think: “big white box good!” But other times, I glance over to my PS5 and think: “other big white box also good!” Then I start getting fanciful and imagine a lovely future where they can both combine into one. Keeping track of two big white boxes is hard! Luckily, I only have to write about one of those big white boxes for RPS the vast majority of the time. Today is one of the rare occasions I do have to cover both, so here’s everything announced at yesterday’s Playstation State Of Play that you, the discerning big white box owner, might find relevant:

                              <span>Sony have dropped a trailer and release date for Concord at their latest State Of Play, Concord being a new 5V5 multiplayer FPS in which you play a bunch of freegans carrying out heists on various loudly coloured alien planets. Sorry, not freegans - freegunners. Freeganism is a portmanteau of &quot;free&quot; and &quot;vegan&quot; referring to people who fish jars of near-spoiled hummus out of supermarket dumpsters according to an ideology of minimal resource consumption. Freegunners, meanwhile, are lairy Guardians Of The Galaxy-alike mercenaries with phat guns and playstyle-defining secondary abilities. They do not consume hummus as far as I know. The game is out 23rd August 2024, with a beta happening in July, and I&#x27;ve got an overview trailer for you below.

                              <span>Per last night’s Sony State of Play, PS5 darling and supposedly rather good action-dad adventure God of War Ragnarök is coming to PC on September 19th 2024. The good news is that the port, co-developed by Jetpack Interactive and original makers Santa Monica Studio, will pack in all the DLSS 3, FSR 3, and ultrawide what-have-yous that one might expect from a big, monied PC release. The bad, silly, clearly pointless news is that it will need a PlayStation Network (PSN) account, despite the complete lack of multiplayer.

Tato melodie byla vyhodnocena jako porušení autorských práv, protože se shoduje s nahrávkou od uživatele Audego starou devět let. Což je vlastně přesně nahraná melodie pračky Samsung. Ke klipu však Audego připojil Content ID, tedy označil jej za vlastní výtvor.</span>

                              <span>Revealed during The Game Awards 2023 last December, The First Descendant is an upcoming looter-shooter RPG from Nexon and one of the South Korean company&#x27;s first forays into the console market space. Due out this year, this free-to-play third-person multiplayer shooter is hoping to attract players within the Destiny 2 and Warframe community and newcomers alike. And after playing the game for a couple of hours, we&#x27;re inclined to believe Nexon is on to something here. 
Ahead of the game&#x27;s release, Game Informer editor Wesley LeBlanc traveled to Seoul, South Korea, to visit Nexon and speak to some of The First Descendant&#x27;s leads about what players can expect, its plans for the game after launch, and more.

                              <span>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero’s latest trailer has unveiled fusion warriors for its roster. It also seems to tease another announcement on the horizon.
The trailer reveals the additions of Gotenks (the fusion of Goten and Trunks), Kefla (the fusion of Caulifla and Kale), Fused Zamasu, and Goku and Vegeta’s fusions, Vegito and Gogeta. Watch them trade blows in the trailer below: 


Since each fusion includes the fighters that make them up and their various transformations, the full list of characters joining the roster amounts to 21. Check them out below.

The trailer ends with a message serving as a classic callback to the anime that states, “Next time on Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero: Summer Game Fest 2024.” Could we be getting a release date at Geoff Keighley’s showcase? Given that the game was revealed during another Keighley show, The Game Awards 2023, it wouldn’t be surprising.
Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero is the next entry in what’s known in the West as the Budokai Tenkaichi series (Sparking is the franchise&#x27;s original Japanese name). The roster is only halfway revealed, but we’ve already seen a number of confirmed fighters from Dragon Ball Z and Dragon Ball Super, including multiple versions of the same characters. The game has no release window but is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. You can learn more about the game&#x27;s new mechanics and features here.</span>

Games inspired by The Legend of Zelda are common; after all, the long-running Nintendo franchise is among the most influential series in gaming history. Because of this, various games take the Zelda format and try to replicate it, but these homages often miss out on the magic that makes that series greater than the sum of its parts. This is particularly true in the indie space, with Zelda-inspired titles a dime a dozen, making it difficult to stand out from the crowd. Minishoot&#x27; Adventures clearly draws inspiration from Zelda – specifically A Link to the Past – but by applying…</span>

                              <span>PlayStation has reiterated its approach to releasing its games on PC, stating live-service games will launch day-and-date on PC. However, its tentpole single player games will not. 
This comes from one of PlayStation&#x27;s dual CEOs, Hermen Hulst, during a public business presentation held earlier this morning. During it, Hulst explained the strategy for releasing PlayStation&#x27;s single-player games on PC at a later date, rather than day-and-date, citing it&#x27;s part of a strategy to bring more people into the PlayStation platform. 


&quot;Indeed, we are bringing our titles to the PC platform, and we have a dual approach here,&quot; Hulst said. &quot;On the live service side, we are releasing our titles simultaneously, so day and date on PlayStation 5 and PC. But with our tentpole titles, our single player narra…</span>

                              <span>The PlayStation 5 generation is already Sony&#x27;s most profitable yet, the company has announced. In terms of numbers, the PS5 generation has already earned Sony $106 billion, according to a slide from its &quot;Game &amp; Network Services Segment&quot; presentation from PlayStation&#x27;s two new CEOs, Hideaki Nishino and Hermen Hulst. 
However, on that same slide, Sony shows that the PlayStation 4 generation earned $107 billion, which is obviously more than $106 billion. But, the reason Sony is calling the PS5 generation the most profitable one yet is because the PS4 generation is largely complete whereas the PS5 presumably still has years to go. Given it&#x27;s made $106 billion in roughly four years, it seems Sony is confident it will surpass $107 billion in the coming months or years. 
As for what Sony is including in its profits, it&#x27;s the entire gamut of the PS5 generation. This includes the PS5 console itself, associated hardware and accessories, and software, too. It also includes services, like PlayStation Plus, according to the presentation. 
One of the reasons the PS5 generation might be Sony&#x27;s most profitable yet is because even though the playerbase is as big as the PS4 – both are sitting at 49 million active consoles as of last month – PS5 players are playing significantly more on their console. The PS5 generation sits at 2.4 billion total gameplay hours while the PS4 sits at 1.4 billon. More playtime likely equates to more spending, which might be one of the reasons the PS5 generation is doing financially as well as it is. 
Life-to-date spending on the PS5 is also higher amongst players than the PS4, too. Across peripherals, services, content/add-ons, and content/full games, the PS4 life-to-date spend is $580 while PS5 players average $731.

                              <span>Netflix has announced a partnership with Mojang Studios to create a new animated series based on Minecraft. The news comes as part of a celebration of Minecraft’s 15th anniversary.
WildBrain, the studio behind other Netflix shows such as Sonic Prime, Ninjago: Dragons Rising, and Carmen Sandiego, is developing this CG-animated Minecraft show. Plot details are nonexistent, but a press release states the series will be &quot;showing the world of Minecraft in a new light&quot; and feature an original story with new characters.


This won&#x27;t be the only on-screen adaptation of the best-selling video game of all time. A live-action Minecraft movie is currently in production, with Jack Black confirmed to star as Steve.  
The Minecraft show, whatever it winds up being titled, has no premiere date. In the meantime, be sure to catch up on the other video game adaptations Netflix has on the way, including the first teaser for Season 4 of The Witcher (now starring Liam Hemsworth), the first trailer for Arcane Season 2, and the first look at the animated Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft starring Hayley Atwell.</span>

The only EPYC 4004 class processor I wasn&#x27;t able to finish testing in time was the entry-level EPYC 4124P as a 4-core processor with $149 retail price. I&#x27;ve now had the time to finish benchmarking that budget-focused Zen 4 server processor as well as seeing how it compares to the 4-core Skylake Xeons that were prolific for years.</span>

My personal reputation is great only among people who love mushrooms and hate deer. It&#x27;s been long enough that I should probably be a fierce warlord running a large chunk of the kingdom in opposition by now, but instead, I have the skillset of fifty peasants, and the outstanding work of fifty three. And I know why. Bellwright has taught me what I already knew in theory, but had not truly appreciated:
Good managers are rare and precious. And I&#x27;m not one of them.

Apple had just released their new electric barnacle scrubber, and sailors everywhere were trading sacks of freshly minted coins just for a solitary sweet sniff at one of the delightfully compact and sleekly designed charger cables. Of course, too-many-toes Jackson and myself had seen tell of this upcoming gold rush, written in crab trails on the sand, which is what we had instead of the stock market in them days.

                              <span>KILL KNIGHT, the silly-named twin stick action game you may have caught at similarly silly-named event The Triple-I Initiative in April, is joining this year&#x27;s Steam next fest with a demo ahead of its expected release date later this year. I’ve played it, and I feel must apologise, Mr. Knight. I still think it&#x27;s a silly name, but with frantic flowing action this immediately gratifying, you can call yourself whatever your killy little heart so desires. For this knight is not like other knights: this is a knight who kills. Wait, they all do that? Oh. Well, this one has four guns. Suck it, literally every other knight.

                              <span>Destructive third-person action game Just Cause is getting made into a movie, produced by the men behind The Fall Guy and Nobody, according to the Hollywood Reporter. This isn&#x27;t the first time the over-the-top explode &#x27;em up has been in line to get the big screen treatment. Another version spent years in development hell until the rights lapsed. But it&#x27;s been picked up again by Universal, who are no strangers to turning video games into box office burger bucks (they did The Super Mario Bros. Movie). So, it might result in an actual movie this time.

                              <span>The demo for puzzle game Schim, in which you play as a boy and his frog that only exists in the shadows, is out now on Steam. I’ve given it a whirl, and its pretty froggin’ delightful. The game has you progress through different scenes set in a chill, colorful townscape. You can switch at any time between boy and frog. The boy can go anywhere, but is frequently blocked by environmental puzzles. The frog has the means to solve such puzzles, by hopping between shadows naturally cast by the environment. They act like little inky puddles, and simply jumping from one to the other is a rare joy.

Last week, players of the character action gacha asked for more freedom to skip story scenes and dialogue. Having sunk a bunch of hours into the game, I can see why. The combat may be swish and the traversal across its rolling landscape flowing and carefree, but the lore-obsessed babble of its characters is mind-numbing.

                              <span>Readers, I appear to have locked myself in self-referential language matrix trying to describe the feeling of playing top-down action shooter Kickback. You can only move through the recoil from shooting, you see, which means facing the opposite way to where you want to go. It’s both  very counterintuitive and very fun. To call something both counterintuitive and fun seems, well, counterintuitive. But also: fun. Which, as a concept is very fun to think about. But, also, quite counterintuitive. Writing such a incredibly redundant paragraph is quite fun, even though I’m just repeating myself. Counterintuitive, right? I’m going to try to escape this paragraph now. If I manage it, I’ll see you in the one below.

                              <span>An Activision lawsuit targeting a group of Call of Duty cheat makers has ended with a $14.5m judgment in favor of the plaintiffs. The defendants, all linked to Germany-based EngineOwning UG, initially put up a spirited defense against alleged violations of the DMCA, Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and civil RICO, among others. By last summer, all defendants had disengaged from the legal process. At the time of writing, EngineOwning is selling its latest MWIII and Warzone cheat.

Last December, CCTV footage revealed a figure in black spray-painting the words &quot;free movie&quot; time and again. The damage to the culturally significant building was meant to advertise a pirate video site.

                              <span>Many moons ago, premiere wordsman Nate Crowley reviewed shark ‘em up Maneater, decrying its incurious perpetuation of anti-shark propaganda, and calling it “an ecstatically violent simulation of being a fool&#x27;s idea of a shark.” My own frothing penchant for the plan-schemes of Warhammer’s Skaven ratboys has been documented in these pages to the point of rabidity, but I do feel broadly similarly about media that sullies rats - clean, smart and good folk that they are. Lively tactics Trash Of The Titans does not aim to emancipate its villainous vermin. But, like Warhammer, it gets a pass for its evident affection towards its antagonistic dumpster diving scuttlers. Also, it&#x27;s just plain fun.

                              <span>A producer on Kerbal Space Program 2 has confirmed that those working on the space flight sim are being laid off en masse. We already knew that the developers at Intercept Games would be losing their jobs thanks to a closure announcement from Washington State. Until remarks from Strauss Zelnick, the CEO of Take-Two Interactive, muddied the waters. Zelnick refused to acknowledge that the studio was being closed when asked by a reporter, even going so far as to claim the opposite. &quot;We didn&#x27;t shutter those studios,&quot; he told IGN. But it seems clear from one producer&#x27;s testimony that Zelnick&#x27;s remarks are inaccurate.

                              <span>Mortal Kombat 1’s next superpowered guest fighter, The Boys’ Homelander, shows off his dominance in a new gameplay trailer. The less-than-heroic superhero becomes available for Kombat Pack owners on June 4 and for everyone else on June 11.
The patriotic and maniacal leader of The Seven shows no quarter to his new MK adversaries, obliterating them with an offensive style that is very reminiscent of Superman’s playstyle in the Injustice series. The trailer also shows off the new DLC Kameo fighter Ferra, the smaller, more feral half of the Ferra &amp; Torr team from Mortal Kombat X, who also joins the game sometime in June. 


Homelander joins Peacemaker, Invincible’s Omni-Man, Ermac, Quan-Chi, and the upcoming Takeda in the Year 1 DLC roster. Mortal Kombat 1 also has a story expansion on the way, but there’s still no word on what that will entail or when it will arrive.

XDefiant’s core modes offer temporarily fun stabs at the competitive multiplayer arena shooter, but Ubisoft’s latest attempt at carving out a slice of the lucrative esports pie feels half-baked. Core modes like its practice mode and ranked queue are gated off by construction tape at the time of writing. This leaves a bland battle pass with head-scratching progression decisions and standard weapon-based leveling systems as the only tangible means of rewarding you for playing the game or doing well beyond an individual match.

                              <span>Hive Jump 2: Survivors arrives in Steam Early Access today. To celebrate, publisher Midwest Games and developer Graphite Lab have shared an exclusive trailer for the Survivors-like sequel. The first Hive Jump caught our eye way back in 2015 when we named it one of the most promising indie titles on display at PAX West that year before its launch in 2017. The original Hive Jump served as a four-player co-op homage to Super Metroid, but Hive Jump 2: Survivors takes inspiration from a different title: Vampire Survivors.
The genre, called &quot;bullet heaven,&quot; puts players in the shoes of a single character who eventually builds up to become extremely powerful as the waves of enemies grow more intense. Hive Jump 2: Survivors carries forward the look of its Metroidvania predecessor but from the genre-standard top-down perspective. You take control of a lone survivor of an alien attack who must now face seemingly insurmountable odds to survive. You can customize your loadout and upgrade your jetpack to destroy enemies and escape tough situations.
The jetpack also allows you to traverse the levels in ways not available in Vampire Survivors. The Jumpers have specific builds that allow you to cater to your play style, which combines with the upgrades you select before each run. You can play with auto-assist aiming or switch to manual controls. If you can survive 14 rounds, you can challenge big boss battles. As you collect goo from fallen enemies, you can earn better weapons, upgrades, and relics to improve your odds. Meanwhile, amber you find in the field can be traded for permanent upgrades to stats, magnets for auto-scavenging, or even screen-wiping nukes.
You can see an exclusive look at the Early Access launch trailer below.

                              <span>Sony has announced its intentions to hold a State of Play broadcast this week that will last for a little over 30 minutes and feature updates on 14 PlayStation 5 and PlayStation VR2 games with a specific focus on PlayStation Studios titles arriving later this year.
State of Play returns with a 30+ minute broadcast this Thursday at 3pm PT / 11pm BST: https://t.co/eJWbP09sv3

Sony has no additional details, but Some PlayStation Studios developers we have not heard from in awhile include Asobi (Astro&#x27;s Playroom), Bend Studio (Days Gone), Bluepoint (Demon&#x27;s Souls remake) , Guerrilla (Horizon Zero Dawn), Housemarque (Returnal), Insomniac Games (Spider-Man), Naughty Dog (The Last of Us), Santa Monica Studio (God of War), and Sucker Punch (Ghost of Tsushima). There are more, but those are arguably the developers gamers would be most excited to receive updates from.
At the very, very least, I am hoping for an Astro Bot: Rescue Mission PlayStation VR2 port.</span>

In it, Druckmann was quoted as saying Naughty Dog&#x27;s next game &quot;could redefine mainstream perceptions of gaming.&quot; After the interview, Druckmann took to social media to clarify what he said and pointed out that he was misquoted.
In editing my rambling answers in my recent interview with SONY, some of my words, context, and intent were unfortunately lost. Well, here&#x27;s the full long rambling answer for the final question about our future game... pic.twitter.com/tVuxX3LYJF

                              <span>Quest Master answers the prayers of a certain segment of the Zelda fanbase by letting them create their own dungeons. With an art direction and gameplay heavily inspired by A Link to the Past, this fun homage is now available in Steam Early Access and gives players the tools to craft dungeons as clever or devious as they desire. Best of all, you can upload creations for other players to enjoy and experience the works of the community. Editors Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard do just that, exploring Marcus&#x27; custom dungeon to show off some of the game&#x27;s toolset before playing a (far superior) community creation.

                              <span>Cox Communications has filed its opening brief in a new appeal of the $1 billion piracy case. A jury previously held the Internet provider liable for the music piracy activities of its subscribers. After the trial, Cox learned that the music companies &#x27;concealed&#x27; key information about &#x27;destroyed&#x27; piracy evidence; this allegedly damaged the foundation of the landmark lawsuit.

                              <span>Billed as the most advanced anti-piracy system ever, Italy&#x27;s Piracy Shield had no chance of living up to the hype. It transpires that just eight weeks after its launch early February, top tier football league Serie A filed a complaint at an Italian court accusing Cloudflare of providing &quot;services to pirates&quot; that undermine Piracy Shield. In parallel, the system is already exceeding blocking limits agreed with ISPs. Now the law needs to be changed, so domains and IPs can be unblocked to free up capacity.

                              <span>I have played many a creepy throwback game that takes inspiration from the ever inadequately named &quot;Golden&quot; (Grimy and Diseased? Cadaverous, perhaps) Age of survival horror on PS1, but it&#x27;s rare you play one that invokes the N64, and even less often that you stumble on something horror-adjacent that riffs on Star Fox 64. Ah, Star Fox! The natural companion piece for, say, Eternal Darkness or The Suffering. In fairness, I did always find those Pez dispenser dialogue animations pretty eerie.

                              <span>To kick off with some extremely half-arsed mytho-geometry, the original Frostpunk was a testament to both the design utility and the inexhaustible political symbolism of circles. When people wish to found a community of equals they commonly form a circle, with each participant visible and audible to the rest. A circle is also the best shape for defending against an engulfing ambient threat such as a global ice age, because it has no weak points, and it makes a great centrepiece for a videogame interface, a symmetrical motif that can be tuned and adorned to either suck your attention into the screen or distribute it evenly in all directions.
Created by Polish developers 11 bit, Frostpunk takes place in the middle of a circle, an Arctic crater with a huge coal generator at its heart. Your city rises in rings around that generator, each additional layer of dwellings corresponding intuitively to decreasing temperature, and the result is one of the most focused and thematically consistent specimens of its genre - a building game that feels as intimate and urgent as tending a campfire. Frostpunk 2&#x27;s new campaign mode breaks the circle open. It starts where you (hopefully) ended, with the crater now fully colonised and evolved into a glaring, blue-orange geode of high-density housing and clustered chimneys. But the view has been pulled back, and construction now unfolds along the plains and canyons beyond the crater, which consist not of circles but of hexagons - another UI designer&#x27;s favourite - on which you&#x27;ll plot out upgradeable districts rather than assembling individual buildings.

                              <span>The first scene in RPS Game Club pick Deathbulge: Battle Of The Bands - a genuinely funny and innovative riff on turn-based RPGs -  sees candyfloss n’ superglue-haired guitarist Faye frantically search for her missing guitar as the crowd for the titular battle grow impatient. You’ll quickly realise this a school-with-no-trousers-esque dream sequence, but the matted mess of thick black cables that carpet this dingy side-stage is painfully accurate. Pissing around with gear is roughly 70% of the band experience, in my limited experience of being in bands. This probably changes when you’ve got roadies or dedicated tech people, but we did not, because we were skint. And also terrible. Several hours of Deathbulge has brought me more joy than several years of being in actual bands. I had some isolated good times in some of those bands, but I’m having a very good time with Deathbulge.

                              <span>A whopping 1000 corpses have been found in our ongoing investigation into Anthology of the Killer, Rock Paper Shotgun can reveal. The bodies were discovered in the aforementioned murder mystery &quot;video game&quot;, which is out now on itch.io. Following our previous reports we can confirm that exposure to the game&#x27;s crime-infested city can cause severe disorientation, confusion, uncontrolled fits of laughter, and moderate enlightenment. The streets here are so dense with crime that entire apartment blocks must shutter at night. When Rock Paper Shotgun reported the 1000 corpses to detectives, we were told this was &quot;normal&quot; and &quot;appropriate&quot;.

Sounds like a solid confirmation from me, though Microsoft and Activision have yet to start bellowing the news from any of Call of Duty’s official pulpits.

The claim was casually corroborated by trustworthy sort Andy Robinson of VGC. Note the wording here, which suggests a bundle package of sorts, similar to the rumoured original plan for the remakes of Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil 3.

                              <span>At intervals in our relentless battles with the Maw, we lose people. Sometimes, it&#x27;s because those people have succeeded in levelling up out of games journalism, or found their way into another echelon of the craft. Other times, the losses are more abrupt and arbitrary. In each case, one short term response is intensification. Those of us who remain must be rockier, paperier and more shotgun than ever before. With that in mind, here are this (four-day) week&#x27;s new PC games of note.

It’s only a matter of time before IllFonic perfects the asymmetrical multiplayer experience. Say what you will about its previous games; each one offered entertaining tweaks to the formula, small yet clever innovations, and a seemingly better understanding of what makes this genre so compelling. Killer Klowns From Outer Space: The Game embodies all these aspects, making it one of IllFonic’s best asymmetric games yet.
Killer Klowns From Outer Space: The Game offers a familiar gameplay loop for the genre. Seven human players must quick…</span>

                              <span>Tekken 8’s second DLC fighter, Lidia Sobieska, returns to action in her first gameplay trailer. The Polish politician and karate master will bolster the roster this summer.
First introduced as a DLC fighter in Tekken 7: Fated Retribution, Lidia is the prime minister of Poland and a practitioner of traditional karate. The formal and proud fighter clashes with fellow karate practisioner Jin Kazama in the trailer and humbles the arrogant Reina by dishing out her new Rage Art. 


Lidia follows on the heels of Eddy Gordo as the two revealed Year 1 season pass fighters. Owners of Tekken 8’s Deluxe, Ultimate, or Collector&#x27;s Editions automatically receive these fighters. Each can also be purchased individually for $7.99. Two more fighters remain in the Year 1 pass, who will be added during the fall and winter

                              <span>One of the biggest reasons Xbox acquired Activision Blizzard was for the Call of Duty series, a first-person shooter that has dominated the best-selling games list for decades. This would make it the perfect candidate to launch on Xbox Game Pass, Microsoft&#x27;s gaming subscription service, in order to bring new subscribers in. Black Ops 6 was officially revealed last week, and while it was reported to be in consideration for a Game Pass launch, today, the news was confirmed from Xbox itself. Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will launch on Game Pass day one.
We don&#x27;t know much about the game yet, but two live-action teasers have been released so far. The first features a group of people covering the faces of Mount Rushmore with blindfolds that say, &quot;The truth lies.&quot; The second, released today, can be seen below.


It features world leaders&#x27; black and white camera footage speaking in hushed tones about a grand conspiracy about manufactured wars and the elusive nature of the truth. The trailer ends with the game&#x27;s full title, along with a reminder that the full reveal will come on June 9, after Xbox&#x27;s summer showcase.

                              <span>Lego has pulled the curtain back on its new playset based on The Legend of Zelda. The 2-in-1 aims to satisfy both old-school and new-school fans and is set to go on sale in January.
The 2,500-piece set lets owners build two scenes modeled after the Great Deku Tree from Ocarina of Time and Breath of the Wild. In terms of characters, it includes both games&#x27; versions of Link, BOTW Zelda, and the maraca-shaking Hestu. Smaller details include the cooking pot, a Skulltula, treasure chests, and a Korok tucked away on the treetop.

The Great Deku Tree 2-in-1 costs $299.99 and can be pre-ordered now on Lego&#x27;s website. It will arrive in stores on January 9, 2025. It joins other sets based on Nintendo properties such as Animal Crossing, Donkey Kong, and Mario.</span>

                              <span>Konami revealed it is holding another Silent Hill Transmission event on May 30 at 4 P.M. PDT. The last Silent Hill Transmission happened in 2022 and revealed a surprising amount of Silent Hill news including the reveal of the remake of Silent Hill 2, Silent Hill f, a new Silent Hill movie, and more.
The post announcing the event reads, &quot;Consider this your invitation letter to Silent Hill. ✉️ Tune in May 30 at 4 p.m. PDT to our SILENT HILL YouTube channel for the second installment of the #SILENTHILL Transmission where we&#x27;ll share game updates, a deeper look at the film, and new merch.&quot;
The safe bet is a teaser trailer for the movie and hopefully new details about the Silent Hill 2 remake and Silent Hill f, the latter of which seems like the franchise&#x27;s next big original entry. Silent Hill Ascension, the online mobile narrative game where players dictated the story choices, also finished up its first season (though the developer may have a different term for it), so it&#x27;s possible we may learn what&#x27;s next for that game.</span>

If you haven’t seen the trailer for Kingmakers, I encourage you to watch it now before continuing. If you have, or perhaps you are reading this magazine in an effort to limit screen time (you’re doing great, and we appreciate your support), I can’t continue to talk about the game without spoiling its major twist. The trailer teases what appears to be a medieval strategy game with base-building elements before a contemporary, but admittedly junky truck screams through time to arrive in the middle of a battlefield brimming with horses, suits of armor, and presumably the shouting of old English phrases, but it’s difficult to hear through the chaos.

                              <span>In 2009, a video game called Canabalt was published on the iOS App Store. It had a simple premise: Your character flees through a crumbling urban landscape, making great leaps across rooftops at the touch of your phone screen. It met great success and charted in what was then only a burgeoning mobile game ecosystem. Canabalt popularized the infinite runner genre and would ultimately put its designer, Adam Saltsman, on the map.
Now working under the name of Finji as its creative director, Adam’s rise as a designer as well as his partner’s, Bekah Saltsman, as both a publisher and CEO, has been stunning to watch, especially considering the simplicity of that first big hit. Whether you’re playing the bass guitar as Mae Borowski in Night In The Woods, organizing patchwork-colored boxes in Wilmo…</span>

                              <span>I woke up this morning and put on a white Hanes t-shirt mass-produced by a machine able to produce clothing at a rate no human ever could. But shirts like this used to be made by humans. While making coffee, I ask Siri on my iPhone what the weather will be like today and what my day’s schedule looks like, and a few seconds later, an artificial intelligence-powered voice gives me the answers I’m looking for. After sitting down at my work computer to write this, I opened Spotify and checked out my Discover Weekly playlist, hyper-curated to my tastes based on the other music I’ve listened to over the past week.
On Instagram, my ads feel uncannily targeted to me, and on X (formerly Twitter), I see a new batch of posters for Amazon’s upcoming Fallout streaming series called out for using A.I. N…</span>

I had the chance to catch up with director Takayuki Nakayama about the importance of the Great Demon. However, in February, I sat down with Nakayama and producer Shuhei Matsumoto to discuss the addition of Ed to Street Fighter 6. During that conversation, Nakayama shared an intriguing anecdote about how important Ed was to the development of Street Fighter 6.
When the team sits down to decide on the characters, they think of balancing out the roster not only in style, but through the regions and countries the characters represent. However, the story of the game –in Street Fighter 6&#x27;s case, World Tour – also plays a big role.

He shared the recipe for a Cuban dish – the Arroz con Pollo – in an in-game radio station in Oxenfree II: Lost Signals, and it’s one that he describes as “very controversial.” The trick, according to Douglas, a senior writer at Night School Studio, is to use boneless, skinless chicken thighs for the dish instead of bone-in, skin-on thighs and drumsticks.
“My family’s from Cuba,” says Douglas. “It was my mom’s recipe that I have transformed into my recipe. And so, the version in the game is my version, which in the Cuban community is a very controversial version, and I stand by it. I still haven’t told my mom about any of this, by the way. I’m genuinely afraid of telling her this.”

The 2018 release of Frostpunk delivered a unique twist on the city-builder genre, putting you in control of a band of humans trying to survive the new ice age. Players assumed the role of The Captain as they built up their small colony of workers to a flourishing city in the post-apocalypse. Along the way, players needed to make hard decisions, like restricting food, enforcing strict authoritarian laws, putting children to work, or worse. Frostpunk 2 picks up the story 30 years later and, in the process, looks to impr…</span>

Expendables movies come with a three-point guarantee: lots of explosions, a solid 6/10 aggregate score on the Internet Movie Database, and thousands of people being monitored on BitTorrent so they can be sued at a later date. Almost 3,000 now face action in Canada&#x27;s Federal Court.

According to a new report, it’s subtitled The Dark Ages and we’ll get an official reveal next week.

                              <span>A Seattle jury has issued a landmark verdict following the legal battle between &#x27;Destiny 2&#x27; creator Bungie and cheat seller AimJunkies. The &#x27;cheat&#x27; company and its three owners are liable for copyright infringement and must pay damages to Bungie. The same applies to an independent cheat developer whose counterclaim, alleging that Bungie &#x27;hacked&#x27; his computer, was denied.

                              <span>The seemingly endless possibilities of generative AI are not on an unavoidable collision course with copyright law; the collision happened way back and sooner or later, someone will have to pick up the bill. In the meantime, popular LLMs seem to be developing a stubborn, pro-copyright streak, partly due to all the industry propaganda they&#x27;ve been consuming. But don&#x27;t fight back, it&#x27;s time to team up.

                              <span>Senua&#x27;s Saga: Hellblade II is out this week, but the starting line for developer Ninja Theory&#x27;s foray into the world of action games with a focus on performance capture began with Heavenly Sword. Released in 2007 for the PlayStation 3, the game featured Andy Serkis just a few years removed from his work on the Lord of the Rings films, and is a weird action game that has incredible moments of action that doesn&#x27;t last quite as long as you&#x27;d like. It&#x27;s a special game to me, however, and one I am always happy to revisit. I am pessimistic, but I would love to play a version of the game at 60 FPS.

                              <span>Operation Creative is a multi-agency anti-piracy initiative led by the Police Intellectual Property Crime Unit, also known as PIPCU. The primary aim is to shut down pirate sites but if that proves elusive, depriving sites of advertising revenue by placing them on a blacklist is seen as the next best thing. The Infringing Website List (IWL) isn&#x27;t made public but since there was no celebration of its recent 10-year anniversary, here&#x27;s what the decade-old list has been getting up to lately.

                              <span>Long-running British comedy panel TV game shows are not something we usually cover here at Game Informer (a magazine and website devoted to informing readers about video games), but Taskmaster, the long-running British comedy panel TV game show, is getting a video game adaption. The Taskmasters themselves, Greg Davies and Alex Horne, will be represented in-game, and Horne, who created the concept of the show and is technically its sole writer (see below) was available to chat about it. We learned about the upcoming VR game (releasing June 13 on Quest), why the American Comedy Central version of the show didn&#x27;t work, whether or not it is time to give an American version another shot, and what it is like to meet yourself in VR. So without further ado... it&#x27;s little Alex Horne!

                              <span>HBO and PlayStation have found their Isaac for The Last of Us Season 2, and it&#x27;s Jeffrey Wright, the actor behind the voice of Isaac in The Last of Us Part II. Perhaps best known for roles like The Watcher in Marvel&#x27;s What If...?, Commissioner Gordon in The Batman, and Bernard in HBO&#x27;s Westworld series, as well as his role as Thelonious &quot;Monk&quot; Ellison in 2023&#x27;s American Fiction, which earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor, Wright will return to Naughty Dog&#x27;s post-apocalyptic world to give Isaac another go. 
HBO announced this today with a quick post on X (formerly Twitter) that you can see below: 
We&#x27;re beyond thrilled that Jeffrey Wright is joining the cast of The Last of Us Season 2, reprising his role as Isaac! 🐺 https://t.co/g7tlLBrHWe

Titled &quot;Wrecked,&quot; Fortnite Chapter 5: Season 3 follows last season&#x27;s Greek Gods-themed season with a new battle pass, new weapons and skins, and more. 
&quot;A ferocious sandstorm recently moved over the Island, creating a new biome in the south dubbed the wasteland,&quot; an Epic Games blog post reads. &quot;The &#x27;Wasteland Warriors&#x27; have already called shotgun on owning the place (they did ride in with the sandstorm, after all). This crew moves as fast as their decked-out cars, proven by the places they&#x27;ve already established.&quot;

Every so often, I see a premise for a game that really grabs me. The Alters is the latest with its unique take on the &quot;what if&quot; questions and multiverses. What starts as seemingly a standard survival game set on a hostile alien planet quickly introduces enticing base-building mechanics and a fun premise of escaping an ever-encroaching deadly sunrise. But it&#x27;s the unique idea of the main character not only learning how different his life would have been had he made different choices at pivotal moments in his past but also being able to meet and work alongside those versions of hi…</span>

The captivating, combat-free Metroidvania is rich with a delectable buffet of challenges, puzzles and secrets to find even once you’ve seen the credits roll. Still, players have chewed their way through its more-ish platforming and puzzle-solving much faster than its solo developer intended, it turns out. Luckily for us all, creator Billy Basso is already looking ahead to a new game set in the moody zoo-niverse - even if that’s not a complete sequel.

                              <span>Slovak studio 3Division’s city-building strategy sim Workers &amp; Resources: Soviet Republic will leave early access on 20th June 2024 – a welcome blast of no-nonsense, planned-economy Soviet realism in the wake of the decadent capitalist theatrics of Summer Games Fest. Here’s a triumphal trailer with many a joyful image of high-density housing and locomotives in the snow.

                              <span>We&#x27;ve known for some time that Fallout was coming to Fortnite, we just weren&#x27;t entirely sure in what capacity. Well, now we know that this season&#x27;s wasteland offerings take the form of a sort of Mad Max meets Fallout meets Borderlands- battle royale affair. There&#x27;s a big emphasis on deserts and vehicles, basically, with highlights including: mechanical fists, turrets on cars, and the possibility of manning one of two War Buses that patrol the reworked map.

                              <span>Calling it now: this is the least intriguing article you will read about 11 bit&#x27;s The Alters, a blend of Danny Boyle&#x27;s Sunshine and Duncan Jones&#x27;s Moon in which (deep breath) you are a marooned space engineer who must spawn different versions of himself by means of backstory-branching gadgetry in order to operate an enormous, rolling base and escape the apocalyptic rays of the local sun. 


We&#x27;re not going to talk about any of that hoity-toity quantum wheeling-and-dealing in this piece, however. We&#x27;re going to talk about the fact that the opening stretch reminded me of Gears Of War and the many over-the-shoulder adventures it has influenced. I&#x27;m sorry. It&#x27;s been a complicated week involving minimal sleep, and I no longer have the grey cells for branching timelines, though they are certainly the more fascinating aspect of this game.

                              <span>In one of the better gaming trends of the last few years, we appear to have entered a golden age for booting the crud out of doors. There’s Deathbulge of course, but also the upcoming Anger Foot, Abiotic Factor, and a load more I’m sure. There was also literally Door Kickers, but that was ages ago. Anyway, the latest game to put a hinge-disrespecting protagonist front and center is also my current obsession: the excellent Post Void/Hotline Miami-type beat, Mullet Mad Jack. It’s a very fast, very silly FPS about shooting robot billionaires that takes its aesthetic from 80’s anime and PC-98 games. I’m not sure what else you need, honestly.

                              <span>I cannot compare my experience of writing a review for The Splintered Sea, the first paid expansion for dastardly clever physics puzzle builder Besiege, to that of a journaling sailor facing lethal storms on the horizon. Still, if we take for granted the idea that a review is only really valuable as an insight into the experience of the player: I haven’t been feeling especially great this week. That in mind: Splintered Sea is more Besiege, thoughtfully applied to its already expansive toolkit. More importantly, it&#x27;s currently bringing me deep and deeply needed moments of untainted, childlike, vaguely-Orkish joy.

I’m usually a lot more suspicious of hardware leaks, which are often just out-of-date or otherwise inaccurate info, but I’ve also sat through enough mic-muted prebriefings to know an official slideshow when I see one, and that appears to be exactly what Videocardz got its hands on. Besides, these specs include a gigantic 80Whr battery upgrade (doubling the ROG Ally’s 40Whr capacity), so we can at least file this under &quot;News James wants to be true.&quot;

There’s usually at least a few game announcements in there, and this year was a bumper. The headline announcement being an upcoming sequel to well-loved space-pope turn-based strategy Warhammer 40,000: Mechanicus. Yes, yes. I’m getting to the dog.

                              <span>Videogames and especially role-playing games are chock-full of sheltered upbringings that go tits up. Innocent times and places like the prologue for Baldur&#x27;s Gate, which unfolds in the vast, fortified monastery of Candlekeep (beware spoilers from this point on).
BioWare&#x27;s first ever RPG opens with your unsuspecting Chosen One learning the ropes from the old sage Gorion. There are fetchquests that take you around the enormous citadel, bits of combat training to do, cosy formative chinwags to have with characters like your childhood friend Imoen. But it&#x27;s not to last, of course: Gorion is murdered, and you must rove the Sword Coast in pursuit of his killer. When you return to Candlekeep later in the game, this once-proud bastion of learning has been filled with doppelgangers of Gorion and other acquaintances, a parade of chatbots waiting to stab you in the back.

                              <span>A decision by Italy&#x27;s Council of State, overruling the decision of a lower court that Google couldn&#x27;t be held liable for displaying locally illegal advertising, is being welcomed by the head of telecoms regulator AGCOM. Massimiliano Capitanio notes that Google&#x27;s defense failed the moment it became more than a passive host. &quot;The same line should be adopted to eradicate piracy,&quot; Capitanio says.

                              <span>Earlier this year, Game Informer revealed the exclusive first details and screenshots of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed, the video game set after the events of 2023 film, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem. Following that March reveal, developer A Heartful of Games and publisher Outright Games has largely gone quiet. Today, the publisher revealed what players can expect from the Deluxe and Collector&#x27;s Editions of Mutants Unleashed if they want to splurge on the game when it arrives later this year.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed allows you to take control of the four turtles in a 3D brawler/platformer for up to two players. The premium editions of the game will provide additional physical goodies for fans of the franchise. The Deluxe Edition includes the game, an exclusive steelbook, four pin badges, four keychains, and an artbook. Meanwhile, the Collector&#x27;s Edition includes the game, Season Pass, pizza van statue, LED sign, five pin badges, four patches, a mouse mat, notebook, pen, artbook, poster, stickers, and a collector&#x27;s box. The Deluxe Edition retails for $60, while the Collector&#x27;s Edition will set you back $200.
Oddly enough, both the Deluxe and Collector&#x27;s Editions are exclusive to the PlayStation 5 and Switch versions of the game. If you&#x27;re not planning to experience this title on those systems, but still want to at least play through the game, you&#x27;re in luck, as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleahsed arrives on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC later this year.

                              <span>Acquisitions have been rampant in the games industry recently. While the prime example on everyone&#x27;s mind is likely Xbox&#x27;s recent acquisition of Activision Blizzard, several have already occurred in 2024. The latest was announced today by Atari, which confirmed it is acquiring its longtime rival, Intellivision.
Atari announced it has purchased the Intellivision brand and more than 200 games from Intellvision Entertainment. As part of the deal, Intellivision Entertainment will rebrand and continue developing and distributing the Amico game console with a license from Atari to distribute new versions of Intellivision games on the console. Atari will also look to expand digital and physical distribution of legacy Intellivision games, potentially create new games, and explore licensing opportunities. 
&quot;This was a very rare opportunity to unite former competitors and bring together fans of Atari, Intellivision, and the golden age of gaming,&quot; chairman and CEO of Atari Wade Rosen said in a press release. 
&quot;Atari has been a valuable partner and we have every confidence they will be a responsible steward of the storied Intellvision brand,&quot; CEO of Intellivision Entertainment Phil Adam said. &quot;We look forward to our expanded collaboration and bringing a broad array of new Atari and Intellivision titles to the Amico and Amico Home family gaming platforms.&quot;
Atari has been experiencing a bit of a re-emergence in the public consciousness lately. In addition to other acquisitions, such as Nightdive Studios and Digital Eclipse, Atari has also published well-received games like Mr. Run and Jump and Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration. For more on Atari&#x27;s outlook and current strategy, be sure to listen to a 2023 episode of All Things Nintendo, which featured an in-depth conversation with Wade Rosen right here.</span>

                              <span>While I’ve always thought the race towards graphical hyperrealism isn’t as pervasive as it&#x27;s often perceived, Senua&#x27;s Saga: Hellblade 2 is definitely one of those games. The kind that probably has twelve artists dedicated to the recreation of visible pores, that sort of thing. It’s so focused on looking pretty that it hasn’t even noticed the title and subtitle got mixed up.
Sure enough, Hellblade 2 is a harsh test for older hardware, with a heavy reliance on DLSS or FSR upscaling to keep performance sweet. That said, it’s no Dragons Dogma 2-style technical horrorshow either. A happy balance of visuals and smoothness is attainable on plush PCs and low-end laptops alike, while DLSS 3 frame generation can deliver an effective kick in the framerate pants on RTX 40 series GPUs.

This is just one of many laughs your diaphragm will endure as you navigate &quot;the escalating adventures of a girl trying to make zines in a town of giallo-style masked serial murderers&quot;. The horror comedy already won its creators the Nuovo Award at the Independent Games Festival this year, recognition that has been a long time coming for prolific game maker Stephen &quot;thecatamites&quot; Gillmurphy. If you&#x27;re unfamiliar with his work, you can get acquainted next week, when Anthology of the Killer gets its full release on Itch.io on May 28th.  At which point you can explore its unsettling urban hell of shady corporations and cops who think they&#x27;re cool. There&#x27;s a trailer below.

While its Epic Games Store release can be worked around, and Proton GE will get the game’s own launcher running, no combination of software, compatibility tools, or installation folder deep-diving seems capable of actually booting the game proper.
As such, I’m accepting defeat. Obviously with apologies to any studious Steam Deck Academy readers.

                              <span>Everything And Then The Licensed Kitchen Sink fighting game MultiVersus returns next week after an almost year-long self-imposed post-beta exile. With the decision to pull the game from sale and turn off its servers for months on end after allowing people to sink their real-life money into unlocking costumes and such (with no refunds), its developers are now looking to seemingly give something back in return.

                              <span>The classic anime series Gundam examines the traumatic experience of war, particularly the unalterable effect it has on those young soldiers forced to participate in the horrors of fighting for their life while taking the lives of others using weapons of inhuman strength and devastation. Which clearly makes it the perfect fit for a bit of upcoming DLC for military-fetishising interactive gun range Call of Duty.

                              <span>In a twist of fate I&#x27;ve mentioned in some recent Destiny 2 news posts, I am fully back into Destiny. Former vidbud Liam and I used it, initially, as something we could do while catching up on life. But now? Now we&#x27;re all in. Liam has created a spreadsheet of things we&#x27;re ticking off to prepare for the upcoming expansion, and I think it&#x27;s the perfect summation of what the game is to us: something that makes no sense at all and yet something that makes our brains hum with happiness.
And what we&#x27;ve found with Destiny, in all of its bloat, is that we haven&#x27;t explored for a single second since our return. Everything is accomplished through menus, making it quite Starfield-esque, which is terrible… but also good. We can&#x27;t make sense of it and we don&#x27;t think we ever will.

                              <span>Hauntii sets the scene with a rather magical opening sequence. A beam of light shoots out of a mysterious planet and a zoom in reveals the beam to be an asteroid, but not just any asteroid: a crystal shaped like a teardrop, with a little ghost nestled inside. You awaken as this little ghost, who it turns out, has crash landed in Eternity (and who, it turns out, is called Hauntii). Soon you bump into a ghostly girl, who guides you to a tower that thrusts you both up to a higher plane - but though she ascends, you&#x27;re dragged back to the bottom at the last moment by some netherworldly chains. And so, as Hauntii you travel through Eternity to discover who that girl was and, ultimately, how to ascend to those heavenly skies yourself.

                              <span>At RPS we like Alices. When somebody comes along with the name &quot;Alice&quot; you don&#x27;t just say &quot;oh hi&quot; like some insolent rube. You nod with solemn respect and you say, &quot;Alice&quot;. An Alice is someone you should not take lightly, nor take for granted, nor leave unmonitored. For they will destroy worlds and build better ones while you are not looking. This is dangerous and exciting. Alices are a force to be reckoned with. To treat an Alice poorly is to invite shame, dishonour, and contempt. Here are some of the best Alices in video games!

                              <span>We just got a new Elden Ring: Shadow Of The Erdtree story trailer yesterday. As is their druthers, FromSoft have at once made the events it depicts feel of earth-shattering importance while providing basically no concrete information. A lot of people will be putting out gargantuan theory posts right now, rambling on about Miquella, the Crucible, the Golden Order blah blah. This is all a distraction. Anyone with eyes can tell you that the primary movers and shakers of this final chapter in the Lands Between are a secret faction of hitherto secret spear people. You&#x27;re likely confused, and that&#x27;s understandable. As the foremost authority on ephemeral nonsense in Elden Ring, I’m the only one who has your back here.

You can bop your way between screens, reader!

                              <span>I could pretend I understand Square Enix&#x27;s action-RPG series Kingdom Hearts, but I don&#x27;t need to, &#x27;cos what I do understand is how popular it is. Until fairly recently the nearly 15-game-strong series, where Disney characters cross over with Final Fantasy and go to war alongside a child wielding a key (I said I don&#x27;t properly understand it), wasn&#x27;t on PC. After some games arrived on the Epic Games Store in 2021, Squeenix have confirmed that multiple Kingdom Hearts games are coming to Steam next month, on June 13th. Unlucky for some, maybe, but not Donald Duck and Goofy, two of the main characters. Long has Goofy been seen as just a joke character in the minds of people people who didn&#x27;t watch A Goofy Movie. Hopefully this brings his heroism to a wider audience.

                              <span>Risk Of Rain 2 is one of my fave action roguelikes, as it&#x27;s a good time with pals and has all the hallmarks of things I enjoy most in my games: shooting and looting. That&#x27;s why the latest free update excites me so, as it introduces an artifact that makes chests malicious and another that lets you hatch angry lizard companions. Oh, and there&#x27;s a new map, too.

But in this ultimate game of keeping-up-with-the-Jones, the life sim from Paradox has slipped on a wet kitchen tile. The game has been delayed for a third time, and the developers are reluctant to set a new date for the planned release into early access. &quot;[We] believe it is more prudent to hold off while we plan ahead,&quot; said Mattias Lilja of Paradox Interactive, &quot;rather than committing to a new date that we cannot be certain to meet.&quot;

For the benefit of people who’ve discovered the one weird trick that therapists hate and improved their mental health tenfold by deleting the bad place, here’s an incredibly cool thread I stumbled upon this morning where indie developers share non-game influences on their projects.

But there&#x27;s more of it, and although after much reflection I think it&#x27;s not quite, quite for me, more of a good and unusual thing is definitely enough to push me into a very nearly wholehearted endorsement.

                              <span>Wacky space station management sim Startopia and wacky hosptial sim Theme Hospital are two of my favourite older games, so I was very pleased with the concept of Galacticare, which is a wacky space station hospital management sim. And you know what? It&#x27;s great! From early reveals and previews I thought it might veer into being too wacky, but it nails its tone, has some really striking levels, and bugs in earlier builds have been squashed (much as you can manually splat small parasites that make their way into your hospital). I can see this becoming a go-to comfort game for me.

                              <span>I may have winced a bit, initially, at Alice Bee’s choice of RPS Game Club game for this month. Deathbulge: Battle of the Bands looked funny and all, but it’s a turn-based RPG, a subgenre that usually elicits the same amount of enthusiasm from me as the phrase &quot;by Ernest Cline&quot; does from Alice. Deathbulge, however, is a clever little sod of a game, managing to devise not only a turn-based combat system that avoids the usual waiting-around tedium but one that’s outright good fun in itself.

                              <span>There are management games and there are micro-management games. Prison Architect 2 is the latter. I don&#x27;t mean this as an annoying thing, like when Harold from corporate starts commenting all over your document at 4.30pm on a Friday. I mean it as a distinction between those games that let you plop down a house, and others that need you to stack the bricks, install the plumbing, fit the lights, and select the wallpaper. The first Prison Architect allowed you to finesse every detail of a secure correctional facility, down to each cell and dog kennel. Unsurprisingly for a sim about prison, it encouraged obsessive control. The 3D-ified sequel isn&#x27;t finished yet, but it&#x27;s taking a similar approach. Maybe a little too similar.

                              <span>You remember the ending of 2011&#x27;s first-person bullethoser Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, right? Everyone does! A big man kills another big man with a gun but then - then! - a third big man kills that first big man with a rope. It&#x27;s dramatic stuff. Well, a data-diving enthusiast of the CoDwars has discovered a cut ending from the original trilogy&#x27;s closing chapter. It&#x27;s a more downbeat and mysterious finale, featuring a shadowy figure whose identity is never revealed. Also, Captain Price, the hero of the franchise and aforementioned big man number three, drops his cigar with possibly mortal implications.

This is RPG outfit Larian’s seventh studio worldwide, and the latest to contribute to their &quot;24-hour development cycle&quot; model. That’s even more hands on deck to a) keep Swen Vincke’s armour polished to a fine sheen and b) ensure smooth sailing for the two new games that Larian currently have in the works.

All very upbeat. Well, hold that thought, because on the 21st, it&#x27;s time for Senua&#x27;s Saga: Hellblade 2, another slice of Celtic sort-of-psychosis from Ninja Theory, which is as grim as the accompanying Paper Trail is *checks Nic&#x27;s review* incredibly annoying?
