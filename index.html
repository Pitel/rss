                    <span>From Thanos to Batman, Fortnite is becoming a comic book fan&#x27;s dream come true. If Epic Games keeps adding Marvel and DC characters at a rapid-fire clip, there&#x27;s a chance we could have an awesome showdown of 100 heroes and villains years down the road. The latest addition is The Batman Who Laughs, a prominent character in the new Fortnite comic book published by DC Comics. Epic surprisingly didn&#x27;t create any skins for the recently released movie, Eternals.

                    <span>Handheld consoles are often home to a variety of niche games and genres, and the PlayStation Vita keeps that streak going. The system is a great buy for people who can&#x27;t get enough JRPGs and adventure games, but that&#x27;s not all it has to offer. We&#x27;ve compiled some of the top games for the system, including some fresh and familiar faces.
Sony doesn&#x27;t seem to be supporting the system as aggressively as it did when it launched, but it&#x27;s far from a barren wasteland. Japanese developers have taken advantage of its high-end portable specs to deliver gorgeous-looking RPGs, and indie developers have found a place to explore their comparatively smaller and quirkier ideas. There&#x27;s a wide variety of gameplay to be found on Vita, as our list highlights.
Here are Game Informer&#x27;s picks for the top 10 games on the PlayStation Vita, as it currently stands.

                    <span>Following its re-release earlier this year on consoles, Baldur&#x27;s Gate: Dark Alliance has finally released on PC today. No, not the sort-of-reboot from this summer. That&#x27;s Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Dark Alliance, a very different game. We&#x27;re talking about the OG! It&#x27;s been a 20-year journey for the action RPG, first released on PlayStation 2 in 2001, that saw ports on Xbox and Gamecube, but never Windows until now.
While its store description says it uses the 3rd Edition Dungeons &amp; Dragons rule set, Dark Alliance plays out more like Diablo than the more strategic-feeling Baldur&#x27;s Gate titles. You&#x27;ll play as one of three characters representing the archer, fighter, and sorceress classes, fighting hordes of mystical minions, and taking quests through Black Isle Studios&#x27; rendition of the Forgotten Realms. 
This updated release features higher resolutions (up to 4K!), solo or co-op play, and full controller support on PC. For those reading this, who prefer playing on console, you&#x27;re in luck. Baldur&#x27;s Gate: Dark Alliance is available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Switch, too. 
And now we wait patiently for Dark Alliance 2 to surface on current hardware. Once, again, we are not talking about a sequel to this summer&#x27;s game with a similar name.
Have you played the PC version of Dark Alliance yet, or even the console ports? How does the game hold up after all of these years? Conviene in the comments and chat with us about it!</span>

                    <span>Because it&#x27;s cold outside...
Another week finished as we get very close to the holidays. This week&#x27;s highlight was undoubtedly the latest Indie World showcase, the Analogue Pocket got some retro gamers very excited, Super Mario Bros. 3 still has some secrets, Commodore 64 games may be coming to Switch, and if you want insights into your gaming habits the Switch Year In Review is now available.
Now, though, it&#x27;s time to chill out and discuss our weekend gaming plans. A few members of the Nintendo Life team have done just that below, so feel free to give our entries a read and then join in with your own via our comment section. Enjoy!

                    <span>Just imagine playing USA, World and Exotica on the go.
Cruis&#x27;n Blast was released on the Switch in September, and since then fans have been asking for more. One common request seems to be for Nintendo to bring the classic entries to the recently announced Switch Online Expansion Pack.
It appears the creator of the series is just as eager. During a Reddit &#x27;Ask Me Anything&#x27; on the Nintendo Switch subreddit, Eugene Jarvis - the founder of Raw Thrills and creator of the Cruis’n series - was asked about the possibility of the N64 Cruis&#x27;n trilogy speeding onto the Switch. And while it appears to be up to Nintendo, he&#x27;d &quot;love to see it happen&quot;.

                    <span>After 8 years and over 400 episodes.
If you subscribe to Nintendo&#x27;s official YouTube channel, you&#x27;ve likely seen at least one episode of &#x27;Nintendo Minute&#x27; hosted by Kit and Krysta. Each week they talk about the latest happenings in the world of Nintendo and of course play some games.
Sadly though, it seems they&#x27;ve just aired their final episode. The show started out in 2013, and after 8 years and over 400 episodes, Nintendo has decided to end it. The &quot;final episode&quot; is an emotional reflection on Kit and Krysta&#x27;s &#x27;Nintendo Minute&#x27; journey over the years.

Only kidding! I mean, statistically speaking I probably wouldn&#x27;t get on with all of you, but I actually really appreciate that you&#x27;re taking the time to read this and check out what games we&#x27;ll be playing this weekend. In fact, we&#x27;ll probably play loads of games over our breaks, but we&#x27;ll tell you about those later. Until I see you again, have a lovely time celebrating the end of the year, however you do it.

It&#x27;s not easy to release a kart racer in a world where Mario Kart 8 Deluxe continues to sell gangbusters on Switch, but alas, Nexon is bucking the trend and not only releasing their own kart racer, but it&#x27;s a free-to-play game, too. And it&#x27;s a fun time! 
Game Informer editor Wesley LeBlanc recently went hands-on with KartRider: Drift during the closed beta that ran from December 8 through December 15. During the beta, players were able to progress through 20 levels of both the free Battle Pass and Premium Battle Pass. Plus, two licenses of unique minigame-like challenges were available to play through, as were races in both the Item Mode and the Speed mode. 
In this New Gameplay Today, your hosts Wesley and Alex Stadnik will walk you through all that this beta had to offer. Thanks for watching, and be sure to let us know what you think of this upcoming free-to-play kart racer.</span>

                    <span>Halo Infinite is an epic return to form, a sequel that feels decades in the making. Within minutes of playing the campaign or multiplayer, nostalgia hits hard, and the title reminds us why Halo is one of gaming’s most important series. Infinite is easily developer 343 Industries’ best Halo game to date, an effort that honors the series’ 20-year legacy while blazing a new trail forward for Master Chief and the Spartans. No matter what mode you dive into, the gameplay delivers the iconic “feel” that made the series’ first entries hard to put down and expands upon it in a variety of excellent ways. Whether you are exploring a sprawling open world with Master Chief or are teaming up with friends for an intense battle in ranked play, Halo Infinite is a masterwork that pumps out excitement, maki…</span>

Henry Cavill has returned to reprise the role of the silvery-haired monster-slaying hunk Geralt of Rivia. Season two continues Geralt&#x27;s adventures, this time with his apprentice Ciri (played by Freya Alan) in tow. Also returning this season are Yennefer (Anya Chalotra), Vesimir (Kim Bodnia), Triss (Anna Shaffer), Lambert (Paul Bullion), and everyone&#x27;s favorite bard Jaskier (Joey Batey), among a bevy of newcomers.
Have no fear; this won&#x27;t be the last you&#x27;ll see of these characters! Season three has already been confirmed, so feel free to take in the show at your own pace – like me, who has yet to watch any of season one, though I&#x27;d like to very soon.
Catch eight brand new episodes of The Witcher streaming right now on Netflix, with at least one more season coming in the future. And remember, toss a coin to your Witcher, but not at your television. That probably won&#x27;t end well for the screen or your wallet.
Are you carving out time to catch this season of The Witcher? Which items and potions are needed to begin viewing Geralt&#x27;s live-action adventures? Let us know in the comments.</span>

                    <span>A not-so-long time ago in the same galaxy we all reside in, Respawn Entertainment deviated from its first-person shooter roots to create Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. This third-person action game was the studio’s first stab at tackling the coveted Star Wars license, crafting an original adventure set five years after Revenge of the Sith. It stars Cal Kestis, a padawan turned junker (played by Shameless star Cameron Monaghan) that managed to evade the Jedi purge of Order 66. After he’s outed by the Sith, he embarks on a quest to recover an artifact capable of locating force-sensitive children while also avoiding capture by the Inquisitors, who are elite Jedi hunters. 
The game features a blend of lightsaber combat and a suite of Force abilities. Borrowing inspiration from FromSoftware’s Soul series, encounters are challenging, requiring a strategic blend of blocks and parries to outduel opponents. Meanwhile, the various planets take on a Metroid-inspired progression with players unlocking abilities to backtrack to previously inaccessible areas.

Fallen Order was released November 15, 2019, and was a critical and financial success. It also served as a saving grace for single-player fans, providing proof to an increasingly multiplayer-focused EA that linear story-driven experiences can still make the big bucks. With a sequel reportedly in the works, we’re revisiting this gem of the Star Wars video game pantheon. 
Join Marcus Stewart, Daniel Tack, and Andrew Reiner on Twitch today at a special start time of 3 p.m. Central as we journey through the entirety of Cal Kestis’ adventure. Expect plenty of laughs, deaths, and general nerding out over all things Star Wars. We encourage you to hang out with us in chat.

                    <span>A new fighting game based on the Neople&#x27;s beat-em-up MMO Dungeon Fighter Online called DNF Duel starts its first beta test later today. The beta, which was announced on Sunday in the trailer below, will feature 10 characters from the roster, all of which are based on classes available in Dungeon Fighter Online.
Why should you care about a fighting game based on a Korean MMO you may not have heard of or played? DNF Duel is being developed in collaboration between Arc System Works, known for Guilty Gear and Dragon Ball Fighterz, and Eighting, the storied development team behind fighting games like Marvel Vs Capcom 3 and Bloody Roar. The pedigree behind DNF Duel is legit, and from the trailers released over the past few weeks, the characters look like they&#x27;re going to be really fun to fight w…</span>

                    <span>Tencent is making another big game development acquisition with the purchase of Turtle Rock Studios&#x27; parent company Slamfire, Inc, which includes Turtle Rock in the deal.
According to a press release shared with Game Informer, the Left 4 Dead and Evolve developers will remain an independent operation at its current Lake Forest, California office. It was also noted that despite the studio&#x27;s most recent release Back 4 Blood, which was published by Warner Bros. Games, the game and its continued development will not be affected. 
Steve Goldstein, president and general manager of Turtle Rock, had this to say about the acquisition, &quot;Tencent’s outstanding partners, global reach, deep knowledge of gaming and unprecedented support will help us create the kinds of ambitious games we dream of, while allowing us to retain our autonomy and independent spirit.”
Tencent, for the uninitiated, is a massive Chinese holdings company that has investments all over the video game landscape. Here are some other companies you may or may not know that Tencent has a stake in:
Riot Games
And many more. The above names represent anywhere from 100% ownership in the case of Riot Games to a small stake like Tencent&#x27;s 5% ownership in Ubisoft. With this newest acquisition of Turtle Rock and Slamfire, Tencent is bolstering its gaming portfolio even further with the veteran development talent.
No sale price was given at the time this story was written, nor were any details of any new games Turtle Rock may be working on past its current responsibilities regarding Back 4 Blood.

                    <span>Horizon Forbidden West, the much-anticipated sequel to 2017’s Horizon Zero Dawn, will finally hit PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 next February and it seems PlayStation is ramping up its marketing for the game. 
That’s because just over a week after a new trailer at The Game Awards 2021, Guerilla Games has released another trailer, this time giving us a better look at some of the new machines we’ll be fighting against in the game on February 18, 2022. Titled “Machines of the Forbidden West,” this trailer gives us a closer look at the armadillo-like Rollerback, the flying pterodactyl-like Sunwing, and the Slitherfang robot snake.

                    <span>Hot on the heels of Ghostbusters: Afterlife, it seems a new game based on everyone’s favorite busters could be on the way. 
That’s according to Winston Zeddemore actor, Ernie Hudson, at least. Hudson told YouTube channel Countdown City Geeks that a new one is on the way and that scheduling for recording voice-over is underway, as reported by Nintendo Life. Hudson also said fellow Ghostbuster Dan Aykroyd, who plays Ray Stantz in the films, is attached to the game as well.

“I just got an email because we’re doing another video game,” Hudson told Countdown City Geeks. “They’re scheduling it now to do the recording and I’m not too sure [who is] going to do it. I know me and [Dan Aykroyd], I think. I’m not sure [if Bill Murray] will do anything on it. So, there will be another video game…When they’ll bring it out, I don’t know, but it’s definitely happening.” 
Speaking further about the game, Hudson said whoever is developing it is sending him “prototypes of the character to get the image right.” He said the team seems to have a hard time creating his image, citing that while whoever is developing it is able to nail down Murray and Aykroyd’s likeness, he always ends up “looking like Eddie Murphy or somebody.” 
At the time of this writing, whatever Ghostbusters game Hudson is referring to has not been officially announced so it seems the actor let slip something he (probably) wasn’t supposed to. While waiting to learn more, check out our thoughts on the 2009 game in Game Informer’s Ghostbusters review and then read about how it was recently remastered and re-released in 2019.

                    <span>UPDATE 12/16/21 6:05 p.m. Central: GSC Game World has put out a new statement regarding its now previous intent to add NFTs to S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2. The announcement, which you can see in the tweet below, reveals the removal of all NFT content from the upcoming shooter.

&quot;We hear you,&quot; the GSC statement reads. &quot;Based on the feedback we received, we&#x27;ve made a decision to cancel anything NFT-related in S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2.&quot; The rest of the message says, &quot;The interest of our fans and players are the top priority for the team. We&#x27;re making this game for you to enjoy – whatever the cost is. If you care, we care too.&quot;
This wasn&#x27;t the first statement to be released by the developer today, however, with a very different message tweeted and deleted not long bef…</span>

They say that one of the most zen things you can do with a few hours of your life is digging in Minecraft. There&#x27;s something supremely relaxing about the soft, repetitive sound of pickaxe-meeting-stone; combine it with an enchanted diamond pickaxe and a couple of beacons and you can mine out entire caves in mere minutes.
But what about... an entire world? Does that sound zen, or does that sound incomprehensibly pointless to you? Well, that&#x27;s what YouTuber and streamer Minthical has been doing for the past four years... and he&#x27;s almost done, apparently.

Metroid Dread is packed full of excellent details that show just how much developer MercurySteam focused on franchise history. Whether it&#x27;s routes and tricks designed for speedrunners to discover or fun bonus ways to fight bosses, it&#x27;s a game that&#x27;s kept serving up surprises.

                    <span>The finest Switch games of the year, as ranked by you.
2021 has come and gone (almost) and despite a quiet start to the year, Switch owners have seen some real gems launch over the past 12 months. We&#x27;ve seen big releases (admittedly re-releases or remakes in several cases) of most of Nintendo&#x27;s biggest franchises, with some big anniversaries popping up, too.
We got a Mario, a Zelda, a couple of Pokémon, a Metroid(!) and, perhaps most excitingly, a Big Brain Academy. Hey, it&#x27;s a fun little game! Throw in WarioWare, another Mario Party and a host of brilliant third-party and indie titles — plus a sexy new SKU in the Switch OLED model — and it&#x27;s tough to deny that Nintendo&#x27;s console ended up having a strong software showing throughout 2021.

After its enjoyable demo that led to feedback and game adjustments, we now don&#x27;t have long to wait before Triangle Strategy launches on 4th March. From the team that brought us Octopath Traveler, this time around we&#x27;re getting turn-based strategy and what could be a fascinating tale to navigate.
A big part of the game will be making decisions at key moments, which will apparently influence the story, your allies and more. That&#x27;s a focus in the latest trailer, which also shows us more of young Prince Roland Glenbrook, a key protagonist in the game.

                    <span>The NA version, that is.
Early Mega Man box art — specifically the North American versions of Mega Man box art — are infamous for being a bit, well, off. And we&#x27;re being exceptionally generous when we say &#x27;a bit&#x27;; the NA cover used for the original game is renowned for being one of the worst examples of video game box art ever created and even Capcom designers themselves have been known to voice their dismay at the decisions made in those early NES days. We&#x27;d beg to differ that it&#x27;s the worst box art ever, although there&#x27;s no denying it is absolutely atrocious.
By the time Mega Man 3 rolled around, things had settled down a bit and the North American Mega Man adorning the 8-bit classic&#x27;s cover is much closer to the Rockman we know and love. Sure, his face is a little impish, but compared to 1 and 2, it&#x27;s close to being acceptable.

It&#x27;s that time of year when holiday tie-ins flood the Switch eShop, although this latest addition to Nintendo&#x27;s digital storefront is a little racier than the usual festive fare. Yes, even more so than Santa Tracker, an app which follows Santa as he races around the globe on Christmas Eve. You can&#x27;t get much racier than that, surely?
Well, it seems you can! Coming from Winged Cloud, developer of Would you like to run an idol café? and dozens of &#x27;Sakura&#x27; series titles, Sakura Santa is available now on Switch eShop.

You know how the bee-bee-bee-bee-beep of a laser-targeting Guardian in Breath of the Wild can completely ruin your day? It doesn&#x27;t have to be this way. Reddit user RinHara5aki has discovered yet another weird trick within the game that can save Link&#x27;s bum from getting exploded, and all it takes is a little bit of Magnesis.
We&#x27;ve already painstakingly covered the myriad ways in which you can slay a Guardian — one of the most fearsome enemies in Breath of the Wild — and even the fact that you can ride them. But it turns out that the big metal chaps are easy to defang, too.

                    <span>More reissue than brand new.
There are some things in life that are so predictably reliable, any change to the equilibrium would cause catastrophic disruption. Like the changing of the seasons, the annual holidays, and EA Sports’ insistence on screwing over Switch owners, Let’s Sing continues its annual releases with another set of both new and classic songs to sing along to with a group of friends and family. Much like the latest installment in Ubisoft&#x27;s rolling Just Dance series, Let’s Sing 2022 is a safe and reliable new entry that does very little to convince anyone not already in the fold that they really should be singing. We wouldn’t go so far as to say it’s completely unchanged, but it’s about as close as you’re going to get.
Like last year’s iteration and its strong spin-off Let’s Sing Queen, Let’s Sing 2022 is pretty much exactly the same experience. It contains 30 tracks for you to try out, ranging from David Bowie’s ‘Ashes to Ashes’ all the way to Nathan Evans’ incessant ‘Wellerman’ sea shanty. You can sort the songs on offer by genre and by release year to make things a bit easier, particularly if you’re not too familiar with the selection on offer.

Cris Tales is a JRPG that arrived in the Summer with a fair bit of attention, courtesy of bright visuals and interesting time manipulation mechanics at its heart - we gave it a recommendation in our review.
It&#x27;s now had a major update that&#x27;s rolled out and should be live now on the Switch. It adds some new content, while the press release also emphasizes that it delivers significantly decreased load times on Switch.

Earlier this month, Original Stitch, the makers of the official (and very fancy) Pokémon Shirts, retired 36 of their designs for the original 151 Pokémon from Kanto. Sad news, to be sure — but now they&#x27;ve been replaced with 36 new designs, so who cares! Get in the bin, old stuff! We&#x27;re all about new stuff now.
The new patterns replace the exact same Pokémon that were retired, and can be used to make shirts, masks, aprons, and bandanas. Here&#x27;s the full list:

The latest update for Animal Crossing: New Horizons went live recently and addressed various issues large and small, perhaps most notably fixing a glitch that left your animal residents wantering around in the nuddy.
Certain players have noticed another minor tweak to the game following the release of version 2.0.4, though — it seems that it&#x27;s now possible to find gyroid fragments washed up on your shoreline.

                    <span>Earlier this year, Black Isle Studios and Interplay Entertainment announced they were porting the old 2001 hack and slash Baldur&#x27;s Gate: Dark Alliance to PC and consoles. It came out on PlayStation back in summer, alas they didn&#x27;t give a date for PC. But, surprise! It&#x27;s today! PC folks can finally try out the Baldur&#x27;s Gate that console users first experienced 20 years ago. I did a full playthrough this summer and had a lovely time, at the expense of my partner, who I made sit through one of the jankiest couch co-op games in existence.

                    <span>This week&#x27;s episode of the Ultimate Audio Bang is both festive, but tinged with sadness. It&#x27;s Imogen&#x27;s final run of the pod and I&#x27;m very sad about it. But we (I) gather ourselves and chat FPS news, like how PUBG is going free to play, Overwatch actually has something new, and lots of Halo Infinite stuff. We also get one final update on Imogen&#x27;s Apex Legends rank. I&#x27;d love to say it&#x27;s positive, but it&#x27;s actually quite crushing. Merry Christmas.

                    <span>Remember when the Devotion developers Red Candle showed off a tiny snippet of a pretty 2D game they&#x27;d been working on earlier this year? They didn&#x27;t have much to say about it at the time, but last night they announced it properly. Named Nine Sols, it&#x27;s an action platformer with combat inspired by Sekiro. Honestly, they still don&#x27;t have much to say about it beyond that, but they have released a gorgeous poster featuring a cat-like character that you can see in full below.

                    <span>You know what Christmas was missing? The unmatched fear of being chased by terrifying killer robots through a shopping mall. Five Nights At Freddy&#x27;s: Security Breach launched last night, inviting players to fend off a whole new crew of animatronics. This is the eighth mainline game in the long-running pizzeria-based horror series (I know, there are loads of spin-offs too), and for the first time it will let players properly roam free, rather than be tied to a desk monitoring cameras.

To celebrate the first flakes of glimmering ice wafting out of the sky like God&#x27;s own sub-zero dandruff, here&#x27;s a list of the best snow in PC games. Put on a hat, for heaven&#x27;s sake.

                    <span>V úterý Steam vydal aktualizaci hry Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CSGO) s experimentální podporou Vulkan v Linuxu. Podpora funguje přes DXVK-Native, který překládá Direct3D do API Vulkan. Hru je potřeba spustit s parametrem -vulkan. Podobně již byly přetransformovány hry Portal 2, Left 4 Dead 2 a Half-Life 2 což je příprava na Steam Deck.</span>

                    <span>Transparent huge pages (THP) zrychlují práci s pamětí v Linuxu, protože umožňují pro aplikace transparentní použití velkých stránek paměti (na amd64 2 MB a u novějších procesorů 1 GB) místo výchozích stránek (u amd64 4 kB). THP je možné nastavit na never, always a madvise. Nastavení always může některé aplikace zpomalit, proto je často v distribucích výchozím nastavením madvise, tedy záleží na aplikaci, jestli při alokaci paměti použije madvise a tím dá najevo, že by použití velkých stránek mělo pomoci.</span>

                    <span>Today marks the 30th anniversary of the North American release of Nintendo&#x27;s first handheld gaming device, the Game Boy. Released in 1989, the Game Boy was a successor of sorts to the hugely successful NES, but was completely handheld. To commemorate the occasion we decided to debate our 10 favorite games released for the original handheld. You could argue the Game Boy and its successor the Game Boy Color were essentially the same system, but in order to keep this list as close to the original Game Boy as possible, we decided not to include great Game Boy Color games like Pokémon Gold &amp; Silver (which was playable on the original Game Boy, but released with the Game Boy Color logo on its spine) and Color-exclusive games like Metal Gear Solid (Metal Gear: Ghost Babel in Japan).

                    <span>Square Enix and Marvel have revealed a new collaboration with Adidas in the form of six new sneakers inspired by the universe’s most unlikely team. 
Announced today, this collection will launch in 2022 and feature six unique shoes, each inspired by one of the Guardians. There are two based on Eidos Montreal’s take on Star-Lord, and then one for Gamora, Drax, Groot, and Rocket. However, Square Enix did not reveal the price for any of these sneakers so we’ll likely learn more sometime next year. 
“A key starting point for the design of each sneaker was the unique visual cues from each of the characters – whether it’s the stitching details on Star-Lord’s leather jacket, Groot’s earthy color palette, or Drax’s unmistakeable tattoos,” Adidas senior designer James Liu said in a press release. “From there, we wanted to inlay various design discovery elements that helped further bring the story of reach character to life. Bringing it all together across the collection are unique signifiers for this original take on Guardians of the Galaxy as a Super Hero team – with matching sockliners, hang tags, labels, and packaging.” 
For more information about the collaboration and how the shoes came to be, you can read Square Enix’s full interview with Liu here. As for what the shoes are, here’s what you can expect: Star-Lord Forum Hi 84, Star-Lord Forum Mid, Gamora ZX 2K Boost 2.0, Drax Ozelia, Groot NMD R1, and Rocket ZX 1K Boost. Here’s what each looks like:

                    <span>It&#x27;s no secret Magic: The Gathering is returning to one of its most requested planes in Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty. Though a few years ago, Wizards of the Coast would have said it would be extremely unlikely we&#x27;d see the Japanese-inspired location represented in its own set again. Today, we&#x27;re getting our first good look at what Kamigawa is like in the present day, full of more bright lights and advanced technology than we&#x27;ve ever seen in Magic before.

                    <span>It is important to keep in mind what is going on within Activision Blizzard at this time regarding ongoing allegations about the work culture. The ongoing lawsuit from the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) against the company is over reported toxic workplace culture. The bulk of the suit focuses on &quot;violations of the state&#x27;s civil rights and equal pay laws,&quot; specifically regarding the treatment of women and other marginalized groups. To learn more about the proceedings thus far, including details listed in the lawsuit against Activision Blizzard, please check out our previous coverage here.

IGN spoke to 26 current and former employees of Bungie to create this report and, just under a week after its publishing, Bungie’s head of HR, Gayle d’Hondt, has stepped down. 
d’Hondt announced this to Bungie employees by email yesterday, and IGN saw said email in full. The former head of HR said she wants to do “everything in my power to make sure everyone who works here has a safe, welcoming, and supportive environment.” In doing so, d’Hondt said she feels Bungie’s leadership team needs to move forward with people new, or rather, people that haven’t…</span>

                    <span>The first event for Halo Infinite’s multiplayer, Fracture: Tenrai, wrapped up a couple of weeks ago and while it brought some new armor and game modes to the game, it was met with criticism largely surrounding the event-specific battle pass and its associated progression, store cosmetics, and more. 
It seems 343 Industries listened to feedback because yesterday, during a Halo Holiday 2021 livestream, the studio’s head of design, Jeff Hook, detailed various changes coming to Fracture: Tenrai when the event returns in January, as reported by Eurogamer.

                    <span>Red Candle Games is the team behind well-received horror games Devotion and Detention, but it teased a seemingly less spooky new project in March. The studio released a brief clip of a 2D action game labeled as a work in progress, and today we have a title and a hint at what the adventure entails.
The game is called Nine Sols, and Red Candle Games describes it on Twitter as a “hand-drawn 2D action platformer with Sekiro-inspired deflection-focused combat.” The game stars a vengeful hero on a journey to kill nine rulers, called Sols, of a forgotten realm inspired by Asian fantasy. This world was also home to an ancient alien race. The official art posted below reveals the protagonist’s cat-like appearance (which was obscured by a hat in the demo clip).
Nine Sols doesn’t have a release window or announced platforms, so it’s probably a ways off. Still, given the quality of Red Candle Games&#x27; horror titles, it’s exciting to see the team tackle something outside of what&#x27;s become their usual wheelhouse. 
In the meantime, check out our review of Red Candle Games&#x27; most recent release, Devotion.</span>

Since Turtle Rock Studios released Back 4 Blood back in October, players have been asking for a way to play the game offline and still be able to progress. That’s now possible thanks to the December 2021 update. This update also brings some other requested features to the shooter as well.

                    <span>Square Enix has temporarily halted sales of Final Fantasy XIV due to the ongoing Endwalker congestion issues. 
The company has also offered up additional free game-time to players who own the game or have an active subscription, adding another 14 days of time on top of the seven announced last week. This news comes by way of an FFXIV Lodestone blog post made yesterday by director and producer Naoki Yoshida. Yoshida originally issued warnings of expected Endwalker congestion in November and as predicted, the servers filled up immediately, with some players hitting queues with over 5000 people ahead of them.

It’s not surprising, though, considering the MMO added 1 million new players ahead of Endwalker’s launch.

More specifically, the MCU version of Spider-Man and MJ in Spider-Man: No Way Home will be hitting the Fortnite Item Shop today at 7 p.m. EST. That’s not all, though, as this Spider-Man will include Tom Holland’s “Integrated” No Way Home Suit and his Black and Gold Suit. Plus, it includes an emote that removes his mask. 
Those are just two of the new skins coming to Fortnite today. Now that the 2021 Winterfest is live, which runs until January 6, 2022, players can earn up to 14 presents from Sgt. Winter, including three outfits.

I began The Gunk with eager anticipation, blasting across the swirling clouds of the cosmos. The opening cinematic is beautiful and full of promise. Unfortunately, it is also the apex of the short game’s trajectory. In a game filled with alien worlds splashed with color and populated with extraterrestrial mysteries, The Gunk falls surprisingly flat. Fortunately, this spacecraft manages to stay afloat with likable characters, solid gameplay, and a serviceable story.

Aghanim from last year&#x27;s Aghanim&#x27;s Labyrinth event has returned, and this time a &quot;multiverse-melding mishap&quot; has split him into several doppelgängers players must rescue. The event mode is free, but it arrives alongside a new battle pass that&#x27;ll cost money to enter.

More strangely, today&#x27;s update also introduces experimental gamepad support.

Epic are also going wild with coupons again, giving a £10 (or $10) coupon on every game you buy which costs at least £13.99 (or $14.99). Given Epic&#x27;s habit of paying for timed exclusives, they do have discounts on some games you&#x27;ll not get elsewhere, or at least not with those vouchers.

                    <span>Let me slap you with the caveat up front. Halo Infinite&#x27;s best place is its open world, through which you can swing like a honking metal Tarzan and do sweet Warthog jumps from cliffs. But its best level, the most satisfying A-to-B gun boulevard, comes late in the campaign (spoilers ahead). The House Of Reckoning is a series of rooms where contrived artificial battlefields have been constructed inside an alien fortress. They are abstractly human structures surrounded by sand, as if your extraterrestrial enemies have been playing house but believe a homo sapiens&#x27; house looked exactly like a chunk of Normandy beach circa 1944. The narrative reasoning behind this level is absurd. But the fights that occur within are excellent.

Yes, our podcast&#x27;s wrestling promotion has rolled into your town for a showstopping tag team match. Each of your pod hosts fields a three-game tag team of our favourite games of the year, and fields them in a spectacular(ly described) ladder match. The victor will claim the GOTY In The Bank briefcase and win the chance to compete next year as well.
Before we get to that, though, we must first discuss (at length) whether 200 t-shirts is a lot of t-shirts, what Nate is having for his Christmas dinner, what kind of cop duo would be named Halloumi &amp; Date, and also what our favourite Christmas songs are. Nate also does a really good Mankind pun. Plus: which wrestler would be the best hugger?

                    <span>I’m beginning to think I need a dreamcatcher. The Lynx Africa on my bedroom shelf simply doesn’t have the same level of nightmare suction. In fact, I bet it attracts bad sleeps. Anyway, I’m considering the installation of a feathery net because DokeV’s music video from the latest Geoff Awards has infiltrated the darkest recesses of my brain again. I thought I’d shaken off the trailer song, but it’s back with full force and haunts me more than ever.

                    <span>Final Fantasy VII Remake certainly knows how to make a good first impression. The original&#x27;s bombing mission sequence, which sees Cloud and co. blow up a planet-killing mako reactor in the industrialised hellhole of Midgar&#x27;s city centre, was already one of the Final Fantasy series&#x27; best openers, but here we get to really luxuriate in every last detail of its twenty-four-year glow-up. Director Tetsuya Nomura may have a reputation for excess in JRPG circles (both in his tangled storylines and his passion for buckles and belts), but in FF7R that tendency toward indulgence has been applied with deadly, laser-like precision.

                    <span>CD Projekt have announced plans to pay out $1,850,000 (£1.4 million) to settle a class action lawsuit brought by investors over Cyberpunk 2077&#x27;s troubles. The suit started in December 2020 with investors primarily upset with the fact that the console version was in such a state, claiming that CDP hadn&#x27;t been honest about the game and its prospects. CDP say that the proposed settlement terms make clear that though they are paying out, this &quot;does not imply admission of any responsibility&quot;.

                    <span>It’s been nearly a year since Nvidia started reissuing older GPUs, like the GeForce RTX 2060 and GeForce GTX 1050 Ti, to help deal with the great worldwide graphics card shortage. More recently, Nvidia went a step further, quietly launching a brand new version of the RTX 2060 that doubles its VRAM to 12GB.


Emphasis on the “quietly”, mind – even if you’ve been regularly checking for available GPU stock or perusing our graphics cards deals guide, you probably won’t have even noticed there’s a 12GB RTX 2060 knocking around. So what’s the deal with this mysterious card, and should you even consider buying an RTX 20 series card in this day and age?

                    <span>The Gunk might not be the most sophisticated name in the universe for a gooey black jelly that pulses with an ominous red light, but goodness it sure is appropriate. As space haulers Rani and Becks touch down on a forgotten planet in search of a strange energy signal, the place is absolutely gummed up with the stuff. It oozes and throbs in the caves, plains and rivers of this once vibrant landscape, and the urge to suck it all up into Rani&#x27;s chunky power glove (a literal hand vac in this case) is overwhelmingly strong. After all, when it turns the ground black and saps the world of all its colour, this is one case of Extremely Bad Vibes you&#x27;ll want to remedy as soon as possible. 
Your reward for scooping up all the gunk in any given area is the kind of graphical wizardry video games do best. A burst of light, a shruum of sound, and the world is instantly transformed back to its former glory. Despite its gloopy namesake, The Gunk is frequently stunning, its soft pastels and coral-esque flora showing such an eye for jaw-dropping visuals that it&#x27;s hard to believe this is SteamWorld developer Image &amp; Form&#x27;s first ever 3D video game. If this is what they&#x27;ve been holding back on all these years, then their upcoming action adventure SteamWorld Headhunter should be a real treat for the old eyeballs. That said, while Image &amp; Form have clearly navigated their 2D to 3D transition from an art perspective, their typical flair for adding their own spin to different genres has been less successful. There&#x27;s a lot to like about this 3D action platformer, but it&#x27;s missing that spark to really make it sing.

This latest OlliOlli game swaps out the 2D style for a cel-shaded 3D world that looks absolutely lovely. Or radical. Or sick. Or other skater words. The action-platformer&#x27;s plot sounds great too, it drops you into Radlandia on a search for the skate gods. Skate gods! Don&#x27;t anger them, kiddos, they&#x27;ll break your collarbones.

                    <span>Here I was thinking Tetris 99 was the strangest game to be turned into a battle royale, but now you can fight to the death in Scrabble too. Babble Royale is a new Scrabble-like battle royale where 16 players fight to be the last letters standing. You have to make words in such a way that you escape a zone that&#x27;s closing in, and attack other players by building words off of theirs. I honestly didn&#x27;t think it would work, but man, it absolutely does.

                    <span>Final Fantasy XIV is suffering from success, thanks, in part, to its recently released Endwalker expansion. Despite updates to ease server errors and long queue times, players are still struggling to log into the game. So, Square Enix have only gone and done it. They&#x27;ve temporarily suspended sales of the game, as well as new registrations for the free trial version. Even adverts are being stopped for now.

The first full year of a new platform cycle is always exciting. Developers have new technologies to leverage in game releases, and players begin to glimpse the potential of new hardware. This particular new generation of gaming has had an unusual start. The global pandemic meant significant changes to development pipelines, causing production setbacks and global shipping delays. This resulted in games arriving later and new hardware that was difficult to find – even for the most diligent gaming enthusiasts.
Despite those challenges, 2021 came together as an excellent year for video games, filled with remarkable new experiences for players to enjoy. We’ve selected and ranked our picks for the 10 best releases of the year, detailing exactly why these particul…</span>

                    <span>In the year since its launch, Assassin’s Creed Valhalla has proven to be one of the more robust and popular installments of the long-running franchise. Recent entries like Odyssey received an impressive amount of post-release content in its first year. But even after releasing several successful, large-scope expansions in 2021, Valhalla is going strong and appears ready to outpace its predecessor by continuing its Viking voyage into a second year.
The Dawn of Ragnarök is the centerpiece of that ongoing rollout, a major new expansion set to be released in late winter, aiming to add a considerable chunk of new missions, environments to explore, and even gameplay-altering new character powers. That major expansion is steering toward launch in March, but you don’t need to wait that long to get…</span>

                    <span>Often overshadowed by the newest generation, games are still being built for and released on the PlayStation 4. After showing what Horizon Forbidden West looks and runs like on PS5, Guerrilla Games has given the world a glimpse at what Aloy&#x27;s next adventure looks like on the previous Sony console. 
In a tweet, Guerrilla offered a peek at four screenshots from Forbidden West running on PlayStation 4 hardware. While it doesn&#x27;t say whether the captures came from a PS4 amateur or a PS4 Pro, the vistas on display are still stunning to behold. Take a glance at the lush jungle flora with a mechanical bird hovering overhead, a desolate desert settlement, the Tallneck in all of its towering glory, and Aloy strolling through a pond riding atop what looks to be the horse-like Strider.

These images do look great, and yes, I&#x27;m sure if you put them next to their PS5 counterparts, you can nitpick which details may be missing, or how far the draw distance for LODs are. But instead, we&#x27;re going to take this preview of the rare PS4 visuals and celebrate how good they look on their own merits. If the performance side of the game pans out as well as these stills have, last-gen PlayStation owners may not feel as much pressure to find an elusive PS5 before Horizon Forbidden West&#x27;s February 18 release.</span>

                    <span>The Game Awards has come and gone. Josef Fares referenced his infamous Oscars line while accepting It Takes Two’s Game of the Year award, Halo The Series got a first-look trailer, and Monolith is developing a new Wonder Woman game. But the festivities aren’t over just yet; Xbox is holding a demo event inspired by the awards that offers limited-time, hands-on looks at anticipated games. There are over 35 titles to check out, but not for long. The free celebration ends next week on December 21, leaving players a short window to comb through every experience. However, if you don’t have the time to sample them all, here are the demos you do not want to miss.

                    <span>A Plague Tale: Requiem was announced just six months ago during a Microsoft Xbox showcase and it was received quite well. Featuring the painterly and lush art style of A Plague Tale: Innocence, if one thing was clear with Requiem’s announcement, it’s that publisher Focus Entertainment and developer Asobo Studio are planning to up the ante. Today’s batch of in-game screenshots is proof of that. 
Released on Twitter earlier today, these four screenshots showcase some of what we can expect in Requiem. Based on what we know of the game so far, these screenshots show Amicia and Hugo in new cities south of France, which is the primary setting of the sequel.

                    <span>Ubisoft has officially confirmed a remake of Splinter Cell is in the works after more than eight years of the series being dormant following the release of Splinter Cell: Blacklist. Development duties are being headed by Ubisoft Toronto, and the game will be built on the company’s ever-present Snowdrop engine.
The reboot was announced after years of speculation regarding what the next step was for stealth icon Sam Fisher. In an article on the Ubisoft website, word of Splinter Cell’s resurrection comes alongside an interview with developers working on refreshing the series. Producer Matt West sheds some light on the team’s ideas for the project, saying, “To me, a remake takes what you’d do in a remaster and goes a little bit further with it.” He goes on to state the plan is to stick close t…</span>

A new narrative campaign for Terminator: Resistance just launched last week, and our war against the machines will bleed into 2022 with the newly announced RTS game, Terminator: Dark Fate – Defiance. Developer Cats Who Play and publisher Slitherine today released the first details and two short videos that give us glimpses at how this future war will unfold for PC players.
Set in the same universe as the Terminator: Dark Fate film from 2019, Defiance delivers a campaign experience that puts you in the role of the Founders faction&#x27;s commander and asks you to keep the last remnants of humanity alive. You may even have the chance to deal a devastating blow to the Legion&#x27;s machines. As you make progress, you&#x27;ll rally allies to your cause, but the choices you make could have consequences.

Cats Who Play revealed details that your weapons and vehicles will take on damage, meaning armor and hull integrity could wear thin over time and leave your troops vulnerable. If a building collapses, the physics-based debris could devastate your efforts. You can also use physics to your advantage to take out well-fortified enemy strongholds.
If you&#x27;d rather play as the machines, you&#x27;ll get the chance to do that in the multiplayer and skirmish modes. In these avenues of play, you can control the Founders, Legion, and Resistance. For multiplayer, the battles can be 1v1, 2v1, or 2v2.
Cats Who Play hopes to have Defiance out in 2022, although no specific date or season has been announced at this time.</span>

                    <span>Herschel “Guy” Beahm IV, known by most as Dr. Disrespect, has launched a “AAA game studio” with former Call of Duty and Halo developers. 
Beahm is one of the more well-known streamers out there, be it the audience numbers he pulls in when streaming or his public ban from Twitch after streaming inside of an E3 bathroom. He’ll still be streaming, but he’s now making the jump to the game development side of video games by way of new studio Midnight Society. 
Welcome to Midnight Society /// https://t.co/xuTZGJskyx pic.twitter.com/RWWQSaXcGY

“We flip the tables on the traditional video game development model and embrace the ‘Day Zero Community,’” the Midnight Society website reads. “That means including our players – yes, you – from the earliest most inception. That could be testing reload times and recoil patterns on a firing range or jumping in for the first-ever PVP sessions. No more ‘I hope this game will be good.’ Be there when your voice can actually make an impact because we want to hear it. Really.” 
As for what to expect from Midnight Society, the studio does not have a formal announcement for a game. However, all signs point to a multiplayer shooter. Be it Beahm’s involvement, former Call of Duty and Halo developers, the mention of “reload times and recoil patterns in a firing range” or the job listing description that urges possible employees to “step up, strap in, and start defining the next best competitive multiplayer experiences, period,” it seems Midnight Society’s first game will be a shooter.

The website features some images, too – seen above – that might hint at what the team’s first game could be. It might be concept art, but it could also be nothing related to whatever Midnight Society is working on as well. We&#x27;ll see sometime in the future.

                    <span>Sony Pictures Entertainment released the first official trailer for its upcoming Uncharted movie, starring Tom Holland as Nathan Drake and Mark Wahlberg as Victor “Sully” Sullivan, back in October and it featured plenty of iconic sequences from Naughty Dog’s action-adventure series. 
That trailer led many to speculate that while Uncharted takes place before the Naughty Dog games, opting to go with a much younger Nathan Drake, the movie would be touching on each of the games in some way. For example, we see the iconic cargo-plane-over-a-desert sequence from Uncharted 3: Drake’s Deception in the trailer. We also see Chloe Frazer in the trailer, a character who doesn’t appear in the games until Uncharted 2: Among Thieves, and the main antagonist seems pulled right out of Uncharted: Drake’s Fortune. 
If you were looking for a tie or connection to Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End, the newest poster released by Fandango today has you covered. 
As you can see in the poster, it’s quite reminiscent of Uncharted 4, or rather, one of the final settings in it. Near the end of Uncharted 4, our cast is swinging from pirate ship to pirate ship in search of pirate gold and an escape from a ruined pirate city. Nathan Drake eventually makes his way to what is basically a pirate ship graveyard and it looks a lot like what’s seen in the background of this new poster. 
As for how Uncharted will tackle this connection to Uncharted 4 – which mind you, is just speculation for now, but like, come on, look at it – alongside the nods to the other Uncharted games, we’ll have to wait and see when Uncharted is released in theaters on February 18. All that’s left now is to hint at The Lost Legacy and Golden Abyss. 
While waiting for this movie to release, check out the first official trailer and then check out this look at Nolan North, the voice actor of Nathan Drake, on set with Holland.  Are you excited about Uncharted? Let us know in the comments below!</span>

                    <span>A new trailer for Pokémon Legends: Arceus introduces players to the game’s two rival clans. The aptly named Diamond and Pearl factions (Arceus takes place in the Sinnoh region, after all) are factions you&#x27;ll interact with in addition to the previously revealed Galaxy Expedition Team. 
Both clans share a deep respect for Pokémon though they are divided by their opposing philosophies. The Diamond clan, led by the daring Adaman and his Leafeon partner, values living in the moment with your allies. The Pearl clan cherishes the land itself, and its leader Irida, along with her Glaceon, is suspicious of newcomers. The trailer also introduces Ginkgo Guild Merchants, a traveling guild you’ll purchase goods from.

For those currently playing Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, Arceus has a treat for you. Players with save data from either game will be rewarded a modern Team Galatic set and a research quest that pits you against the mythical Pokémon Darkrai. 
Pokémon Legends: Arceus launches on January 28 for Switch. For more news on the game, check out the recently revealed Hisuian Voltorb and the Hisuian forms of Zorua and Zoroark.</span>

                    <span>Dead by Daylight just released its original story chapter, Portrait of a Murder, two weeks ago, but it seems Behaviour Interactive is already hard at work on what’s next for the asymmetrical horror game: Ringu. 
Ringu was first released in 1998 in Japan by director Hideo Nakata before it was remade as The Ring in the West by director Gore Verbinski, who would direct a trio of Pirates of the Caribbean movies for Disney (weird directorial jump, right?). Already a famous horror icon in Japan, Verbinski’s take further solidified the story of The Ring (and Ringu) as a classic in the genre. Now we’re all scared of videotapes, wells, and scary people emerging out of television screens. Behaviour Interactive will revive those fears with its newest chapter, due out in March of 2022.

                    <span>After eight years of radio silence, Ubisoft are finally bringing Sam Fisher in from the cold, as they&#x27;ve just announced a remake of the original Splinter Cell. In keeping with the series&#x27; stealth roots, the game was announced with little to no fanfare this evening via a blog post, with Ubisoft declaring its existence along with some developer chat before scampering back into the shadows. Typical.

                    <span>It&#x27;s not often those Nintendo Directs have PC-related news for us, but today&#x27;s announceathon had a little treat. Loco Motive is a train-based detective game published by Chucklefish (who also pubbed Stardew Valley and Starmancer), and is the debut game from developers Robust Games. There&#x27;s been a murder! And it&#x27;s your job to figure out who committed the crime. Classic whodunnit stuff that we&#x27;ll get to play next summer.

You can grab the excellent HTC Vive Cosmos Elite VR headset kit for £649. That&#x27;s £250 off the list price, as well as a return to the price that the full VR kit was going for on Black Friday. Surely, this is a sweeter deal than Tom Cruise&#x27;s Christmas cake.

                    <span>Nerves have been sufficiently jangled as of late, not least thanks to the slew of action packed games that have landed in recent months. I crave an altogether more sedate beginning to next year, and so my mind turns to games in which violence, reflex or any other kind of unblinking attentiveness takes a back seat. 
Looking for a broader mixture of games? Check out our regularly updated list of the best PC games you can play right now.
Primarily we&#x27;re talking violence-free games here, but I wanted to drill a little deeper than that - so nothing that generally requires a competitive streak. I&#x27;m chasing a certain feel rather than a certain category. Flying, walking, puzzling, driving, building, dreaming, climbing, stretching, swinging (not like that), swimming, wondering: these are just a few of the ways in which flashing pixels can make you feel a very different sort of accomplishment.

                    <span>I really don’t like gaming chairs. They’re expensive, often cumbersome, drastically over-designed things that lean way too heavily into the g4m3r aesthetic, and that’s coming from someone who’s built up something of a tolerance to it from years of unprotected RGB exposure. I’ve sat on them and have even shared homes with some of them, but have never, ever seen the appeal over a halfway decent office chair.


And then the Noblechairs Epic TX comes along, and it’s got me rethinking.

                    <span>Christmas is coming, PC gamers. The Untitled Goose is getting fat. Somewhere in the distant north, a scarlet priest works his elven minions into a frenzy as he prepares for the rite of the magic baby. Sprouts will be consumed in their millions, the Great Escape snoozed through by bloated grandparents far and wide. Most importantly, gifts of roughly equivalent financial value will be exchanged to demonstrate affection and prolong the reign of capitalism.

                    <span>I’ve been hands-on with Sifu, a beat ‘em up action-adventure game by Absolver developers Sloclap. My hands weren’t exactly “on”, but more “around”, actually. That’s one thing I learned from my time with this kung-fu caper. To keep my fists flowing, I needed to be patient, and not mash the buttons. Seriously, slap those buttons with zero thought and you’re dead.
Death in Sifu means you age, and if you die lots, you age faster. Hit 70 and you won’t be rising from the dirt again. Instead, you&#x27;ll have to start your quest for vengeance over from the beginning. While it can be tempting to cling onto your youth for this reason alone, I actually liked growing old, with my beard and my harder-hitting attacks. Not only do you develop a relationship with your body in Sifu, but your trips to the afterlife also help you master its myriad of moves. Sifu really does get better with age.

Ubisoft are giving the 2D side-scroller away as part of their 35th anniversary celebrations, which is wonderful news. It&#x27;s one of the best co-op games I&#x27;ve played, so it&#x27;s a perfectly timed freebie if you&#x27;re in need of something to keep friends and family entertained over the holiday period.

                    <span>Inscryption is, without a doubt, the best game I&#x27;ve played this year. It&#x27;s creepy, surprising, and superbly fun, and now you can play the best part for as long as you please. Developer Daniel Mullins has released a &quot;mini-expansion&quot; in beta on Steam, which (minor spoilers ahead!) makes its animal-based card game a standalone roguelike experience. Named Kaycee&#x27;s Mod, it&#x27;s slightly tougher than what you might have played already, and adds new challenges too, so you can keep going back in for more.

                    <span>When I finished watching The Game Awards reveal trailer for Rumbleverse, the new Epic-published battle royale game that looks a bit like Fortnite but with melee combat, I raised a practiced eyebrow of derision. &quot;Well, that looks terrible,&quot; chortled I, knowing full well that I&#x27;d still give it a go at the earliest opportunity because I am an absolute sucker for battle royales.
Two things happened later that day that I did not expect. First: I got the opportunity to dive into Rumbleverse&#x27;s action-packed 40-player matches far earlier than I&#x27;d anticipated, as part of a one day early look at the game. I downloaded and installed it in short order, and jumped right in. Two hours later, at 1am in the morning as the servers shut down, I happened across a second, far more unexpected thing. I found myself absolutely desperate to play more. I&#x27;ve sunk thousands of hours into Apex Legends, Fortnite, Plunkbat, Hunt: Showdown, Warzone, and various other behemoths of the genre. Yet those two hours I spent playing Rumbleverse might be the most fun I&#x27;ve ever had in a battle royale.

                    <span>Update, 12/14/21:
Slayer now has a dedicated playlist in Halo Infinite&#x27;s multiplayer. 
343 Industries announced yesterday that despite what the studio previously said, a Slayer playlist would be coming to Halo Infinite before the year&#x27;s end. In fact, the team announced that it would be coming December 14 and that&#x27;s today. As expected, a Slayer playlist can now be found in Halo Infinite after updating to the current build of the game. 
A Tactical Slayer (SWAT), Fiesta, and Free-For-All playlist have been added as well. For more information about these playlists, head to 343 Industries&#x27; full update breakdown.

                    <span>Nintendo showcased nearly 25 minutes of indie games during today’s Indie World Showcase, and if you weren’t able to catch it, or if you missed the name of the game you’re excited to check out, we’ve got you covered. 
Sea of Stars
Sea of Stars was announced in 2020 as a prequel to Sabotage Studio’s The Messenger, and while we saw it last year, which is where we also learned that Chrono Trigger composer Yasunori Mitsuda is helping compose the game’s score, today’s Indie World Showcase gave us another glimpse into its beautiful world. We saw a new trailer featuring some of its turn-based combat, stunning pixel art, and we heard a taste of what Mitsuda is cooking up. But perhaps the most exciting part was that we have a release window: Holiday 2022.

                    <span>Praey for the Gods has been in Steam Early Access since 2019, but it’s officially 1.0 as of…today! Furthermore, the game is also available on consoles. 
The game has been kicking around for some time, having first been revealed in 2015. It caught our attention thanks to its Shadow of the Colossus-inspired boss battles. Set in a frozen, open world, you play as a warrior outfitted with tools such as a glider and grapple hook used to scale titans as well as mountains and other structures. As a survival game, you’ll also have to catch food and craft items/equipment to survive the unforgiving landscape. If this is your first time hearing about the title, the launch trailer below offers a good idea of what the experience entails.

For those who have been playing the game in Early Access, the final version adds two final bosses, completes the narrative, and features a swath of quality of life updates/bug fixes.
You can play Praey for the Gods on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.</span>

                    <span>Inscryption is one of 2021’s biggest surprises in more ways than one. Outside of being a very good game (it cracked our Top 10 Games of 2021, after all) it also has a lot more going for it than it lets on. Those who have seen the adventure to its conclusion but are itching for more creepy card game goodness should be happy to hear that a small expansion is out now.
The update is called Kaycee’s Mod and serves as an endlessly replayable version of the cabin portion of the game. Players can challenge Leshy in an increasingly difficult series of card battles, with each level unlocking new cards, challenges, and even developer logs recorded by the expansions’ namesake. If you’ve completed Inscryption, you know the significance of that last bit. 
❗️Inscryption: Kaycee&#x27;s Mod❗️

December 14, 2021
To access Kaycee’s Mod, you’ll have to right-click on Inscryption in your Steam library. Select “Properties”, click the “Betas” tab, and punch in the code “givemeascensionmode”. Once you’re at the start screen, hit Shift+K+M to unlock the mod. Creator Daniel Mullens also warns that players should probably back up their save files prior to accessing Kaycee’s Mod. 
In a Steam post, Mullens explains that Kaycee’s Mod is a thank you to everyone who’s played Inscryption and that he wanted to appease fans who really enjoyed the Leshy’s Cabin chapter of the game. The expansion is billed as a beta, so expect some eventual balance changes as well as two new cards/items, more dev logs, and even a final encounter at the end of the 12th level.

                    <span>Nightdive Studio’s remake of System Shock has been in the works for some time. First announced in 2016, the game was tentatively planned to launch this past summer but will now arrive sometime in 2022.
Unfortunately, Nightdive still hasn’t nailed down an exact release date. It did announce a publishing deal with Prime Matter to help bring the game to PC and unspecified consoles. Taking place on an abandoned space station, the first-person game tasks players with surviving a hostile AI named SHODAN and the dangerous enemies lurking aboard.  The original 1994 game is widely considered a classic and a pioneer for story-driven first-person action games. 
Nightdive has also released a batch of new screenshots, which you can view in the gallery below.

An updated playable PC demo for System Shock was released in February, which you can still download on Steam, the Epic Games Store, and GOG. Nightdive bills it as the final demo before the game’s full release. 
The wait continues, but some update is better than nothing (unlike the long-lost System Shock 3). In case you missed it, a live-action System Shock TV show is also in the works.</span>

                    <span>Praey Of The Gods initially looks too similar to Shadow Of The Colossus for comfort. And then you think: why wouldn&#x27;t someone make another game where you climb and bring low gigantic beasts? After almost three years in early access, Praey has reached v1.0, adding two new boss battles in the process.

                    <span>Stargate: Timekeepers was announced back in May with little more than a cinematic. Most of my initial interest was tied to its developer, Creative Forge Games, who made interesting-but-flawed stealth XCOMlike Phantom Doctrine.

Now there&#x27;s a soundless gameplay trailer of Stargate in action, and ooh, it looks a lot like Commandos.

I&#x27;m an explorer (and frequent dier). But, with the Caves &amp; Cliffs Part 2 update that arrived last month, I&#x27;ve had a newfound purpose: create the coolest home I can find in the biggest cave I can find. And so I give to you, the upside down deepslate pyramid (located right beneath some festive tundra!)

Even in the best of years, I find Christmas challenging. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m filling my ears with the maximalist sounds of a song which knows true suffering, a song from a fictional musician in a video game. Reader dear, it&#x27;s that time of year: if you&#x27;ve not already started, pour a cocoa and join me for Christmas Pain In Christmas Town.

The town management game has its own cryptocurrency, of course, and this weekend they sold NFTs of virtual land for real money. The hope for crypto land barons is that they would be able to earn money back from other players through in-game business partnerships.

                    <span>Paralives Studio has given us all an early Christmas present, in the form of a look at Paralives&#x27; character creation tool. The video is pre-alpha footage and it emphasises that this is still a work in progress, but the character creator (called Paramaker, a name chosen by the game&#x27;s community) looks ridiculously detailed even so.
Paralives is a life sim game that may even have the chops to topple The Sims&#x27; supremacy when it launches. This video of the character creation is the beefiest look at Paralives we&#x27;ve had for a while. Marvel as the Paras change musculature, fat distribution and weight before your eyes. Importantly, you can give your Paras some sick tattoos and amazing patterned jackets, because what&#x27;s the point making a tiny puppet to play with if they&#x27;re not well cool?

                    <span>As part of our relaunched supporter program this year, we&#x27;ve been busy organising lots of great free game keys for RPS premium supporters. Admittedly, the last two we&#x27;ve done (Darkest Dungeon and Wartales) have both been quite small with only limited numbers of codes available, but I&#x27;m pleased to say we&#x27;ve finally put together that long-awaited &#x27;big&#x27; free game drop that all premium supporters will be able to get involved with. 
That next free game is Plunder Panic, a swashbuckling pirate &#x27;em up in which teams of up to six players battle it out on the high seas. Here&#x27;s how to get your copy.

                    <span>On Friday, a report into Bungie&#x27;s work culture unearthed allegations of racism, sexism, discrimination, toxic leadership and more besides. Current and former employees of the Destiny developers claim they&#x27;ve experienced &quot;overt sexism, boys&#x27; club culture, crunch, and HR protection of abusers, as well as more complex stories of microaggressions, systemic inequalities, and difficulties in being heard&quot;. CEO Pete Parsons has since issued an apology &quot;on behalf of everyone at Bungie&quot;, acknowledging that the studio needs to listen to these accounts, and do better.

                    <span>Is this pandering? If it is, I&#x27;m okay being pandered to. House Flipper Pets VR is a new spin-off from the fixer-upper floor-scrubbing sim which adds dogs, cats and co-op multiplayer. So you can tidy a house with a friend and then fill it with furniture your pet pal will like.

With them came another announcement: this is the cosy management game&#x27;s final update, and its developers are moving onto new things.

If none of that tickles your pick(le)s you could try a keyhole which twists dimensions? Or perhaps one with a steampunk or frost-bitten feel? If literally any of that got your immersion senses tingling then three Skyrim modders have something for you. Creating a cache of realistic looking catches, they have brought the Dragonborn what they&#x27;ve been desperate for; a more riveting lockpicking experience.

                    <span>As someone with bipolar, I have often wondered why sinking several hours into something soothing such as Shovel Knight does so much for my soul. However I recently read that Geek Therapy, a non-profit advocating the use of video games for wellness, promote using world-building games such as Minecraft, Roblox, Animal Crossing, and Fortnite to help people deal with mental health issues. While play therapy has long promoted the therapeutic powers of escapism to imaginary worlds, it is more recently that thought has gone into how these online experiences can be used to combat my, I mean someone&#x27;s, anxiety and depression.

                    <span>Intel’s latest 12th Gen Alder Lake processors include some of the best gaming CPUs money can buy, and they’re not just a big step forward on pure power. They also add support for some new and up-and-coming technologies that that could form the bedrock for even better performance in the future, like PCIe 5.0 and DDR5 RAM. In fact, when buying a new, Alder Lake-compatible motherboard, you’ll have a choice to make: stick with DDR4 memory, or upgrade to DDR5?

                    <span>Activision Blizzard employees are becoming increasingly frustrated with the company, holding walkouts in the wake of damning reports and layoffs. It&#x27;s reached a point where ABK employees are organising a formal strike, and there&#x27;s been talk of unionisation - talk that ActiBlizz would like to stop. In an internal email, chief administrative officer Brian Bulatao discourages staff from signing an agreement with the Communications Workers of America union (CWA) - because &quot;active, transparent dialogue between leaders and employees&quot; is better than unionisation, apparently.

                    <span>Fights In Tight Spaces is about one specific trope that all the spy movies I’ve seen love to use: our main character’s got to a part in the story where they can relax a bit, inevitably they let their guard down, and on cue, a mystery assassin erupts from the shadows to take advantage of the opportunity. The hero’s got nothing but their brawn to make it out, but then, surprise! They actually use brains instead. Nobody ever saw it coming. The thing is, watching those movies, we all know the main character’s not really going to die. I mean, it’s called The Bourne Identity. There’d be no movie without a Bourne! (The Jeremy Renner one doesn’t count.)
Instead of non-stop fast and frenetic action, Fights In Tight Spaces goes for a different approach, and dissects those same action sequences into a turn-based battle. Rather than the scene being a choreographed piece of stunt and camera work that’s over in a matter of seconds, it’s a roguelike deckbuilder that puts the player in charge of every minute decision an action hero would have to make in one of those situations. Which means, if that untouchable main character dies at any point, it was because of what you did. Most of the time anyway.

                    <span>I usually don&#x27;t like comparing games when I review them, but I have a funny feeling I&#x27;m not the only one that was reminded of other moody puzzle-platformers when I first saw White Shadows. It&#x27;s a game that features a monotone colour pallette, a dystopian setting, an incredibly abstract story and the first few minutes had me pushing around boxes to get past obstacles, so yes, it will remind you of Playdead&#x27;s Limbo or Inside. White Shadows gets close to growing its own wings and taking off, thanks to an incredible emphasis on musical sections and cinematic presentation. Sadly, some uninspired puzzles and an incoherent final act clip its wings before it gets to soar.

                    <span>Update: Yup, it&#x27;s official.
Original story:
Later today, Ubisoft will announce something new for Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla. They&#x27;re not yet saying what it is but because Ubisoft either can&#x27;t or won&#x27;t keep a secret, leaks have sprung up. According to supposed screenshots and store info, it&#x27;s an expansion named Dawn Of Ragnarok with a lot of fantasy fanciness, journeying into Norse legend with Odin and dwarves and giants and that.

                    <span>Unusually, the thirteenth door of the Advent Calendar is actually a door, but it&#x27;s probably best avoided, what with the scythe leaning against it. It is a very small scythe though...

                    <span>While the Pacific map in Call Of Duty: Warzone ushered in a new WW2 era of beachside battle royale, it also added weapon bloom. Swings and roundabouts, or in this case, new islands and a frustrating feature that meant some of your shots wouldn&#x27;t hit their target. Thankfully Raven Software realised it wasn&#x27;t the most popular addition to the game and have begun the process of patching it out entirely. But it&#x27;ll take time to fully remove.

                    <span>The Sniper Elite series has found a comfortable 7/10 groove, ploughing the territory halfway between Hitman and Call Of Duty and planting seeds by letting you shoot the bollocks off a Nazi. The next in the series was officially revealed during this week&#x27;s Game Awards, and you can find the first trailer below.

                    <span>Final Fantasy VII Remake is finally headed to PC on December 16th, as announced during The Game Awards. That&#x27;s great news, but there&#x27;s a catch: Square Enix are selling it at the next-gen console price of £65/$70/€80.

                    <span>Tchia was one of the best looking game&#x27;s at last year&#x27;s Game Awards, and looked even better at this year&#x27;s PlayStation Showcase. It&#x27;s simultaneously a bit Wind Waker, a bit Breath Of The Wild, and a bit Disney. This year&#x27;s trailer has all of the above, plus more of the animal and object possession and the ways you can use it in combat. Lovely stuff. Watch it below.

In the air: soap bubbles and excitement. One of my friends asks me whether Jinx is like that in-game. “It’s been a while, but I think so, yeah”, I reply.
I’m in the car on the way to badminton and I’m listening to the song Dynasties &amp; Dystopia from Arcane, the show based on League Of Legends. In the air: hip-hop and a bobbing head. Something significant has happened here. All of a sudden, I am obsessed with a game I shelved years ago, and yet I have no desire to go back. Is this next-gen? More than that, probably.

                    <span>While not as flashy as a new 4K monitor or one of the best graphics cards, an SSD can make a surprisingly big difference to your PC gaming experience. Storing their data in semiconductor cells rather than old-timey spinning plates, SSDs have considerably faster transfer speeds than traditional hard disks, and so can slash loading times right down. This also makes them generally more expensive, although prices are coming down all the time, this guide to the best SSD deals right now could help you find a particularly good bargain.

                    <span>I was wary of the possibility that White Shadows would be one of those platformers. You know the ones. The grim and depressing ones that despise you, with a child and a Stasi man, where the Stasi is actually memories of your daughter, and the child has to throw the puppy in a blender to get over a hedge.


With its stark monochrome look, ominous industrial environments, and dystopian themes, I can&#x27;t really deny that White Shadows is of that genre. But while I normally get bored of depressing platformers within half an hour, I enjoyed this whole thing and even the credits.

                    <span>When I heard that Quantic Dream are making a Star Wars game, I felt much as I did when I found out my home town Swindon had been twinned with Disney World: you&#x27;d have expected Disney to Google some stuff first.
Still, last night at The Game Awards we all got a first look at Star Wars Eclipse in the form of a cinematic trailer. And let&#x27;s be honest: that trailer is cracking. It&#x27;s really good. And it&#x27;s so good that I think we all need to remember that there is absolutely no way QD aren&#x27;t going to spectacularly boot this.

                    <span>Needs must, gentle friends, needs must, and in particular I need to once more head into the dank and dreary evidence basement of the RPS treehouse. Here, at the behest of our very kind supporters, I must navigate a strange maze of specimen tanks, suggestions of whiskers, tentacles and odd wings occasionally stirring behind the glass as I pass. Eventually I will reach a row of grey filing cabinets, locate the right drawer, and tug it open, the scream of rusted metal echoing through the dark room.
I will spend some time rifling through the papers within, growing more and more frantic as I hear the slow tread of heavy footsteps approaching. I must find the right file, but also I must escape in time! I haven&#x27;t been caught yet. Today I escaped with the fifth episode of The Nate Files supporters-only podcast. It&#x27;s about speculative biology. Oh no.

                    <span>Every so often, Matthew and I will be browsing BBC iPlayer in our never-ending search for something to watch and we&#x27;ll get served up some clips from the Live From The BBC comedy series. It&#x27;s a few years old now, first airing in 2016 before finishing in 2018, but there is one particular episode we will watch again and again. That episode is by the Bristol-based comic Mat Ewins, who in this set appears as a self-styled adventurer, film maker and amateur video game maker promoting his latest work Adventureman 7, a sort of budget Indiana Jones meets Tomb Raider kind of deal. 
He&#x27;s one of those comedians who uses a lot of multimedia in their sets, playing daft, self-made videos to help deliver punch lines. There&#x27;s plenty of that nonsense in Ewins&#x27; set here, but for this occasion he also created an entire video game companion piece, styled up as a mid-90s, almost N64 / PS1-style affair in which - unsurprisingly - comedy antics ensue. Matthew and I love it to bits, and I thought that in this, the 25th anniversary year of Lara Croft, we should remember the incredible Adventureman and all of the brilliantly-bad video games he was in we never got to play.

                    <span>If you&#x27;re a motorist in south west England, chances are you&#x27;ve probably encountered (or at least heard of) Swindon&#x27;s Magic Roundabout. It&#x27;s a monstrous concoction of five roundabouts smoshed together, and as far as I can see it serves no purpose other than to terrify bamboozled drivers up and down the country. I&#x27;m not kidding. In 2009 it was named the fourth scariest junction in Britain, after London&#x27;s equally mega roundabout at Marble Arch, the M8 junctions in central Glasgow and Birmingham&#x27;s Gravelly Hill, affectionately known as Spaghetti Junction. 
It&#x27;s the kind of nightmarish urban planning I try to avoid when building my own road networks in Mini Motorways, the excellent sequel to minimalist transport sim Mini Metro, but its new Challenge City update puts all four of these real-world asphalt atrocities to shame. In this new mode, each city gets a bunch of new rules and conditions you&#x27;ll need to abide by, and after playing an early version of it this week, there&#x27;s one challenge that&#x27;s truly diabolical. Not only does it limit the number of road tiles at your disposal, but it does so in favour of, wait for it, unlimited roundabouts.

                    <span>About five hours into Icarus, the new survival game from Day Z’s Dean Hall and co, I had a moment. I’d just been savaged by a bear, and had morosely jogged back over to my corpse from the respawn drop ship several miles away. It was dark, and also stormy, and also there were more bears. I desperately needed to find and reclaim my pack, stuffed with meat, tools and building supplies, which was proving difficult because your corpse just appears as a small pile of excruciatingly indiscernible brown sandbags. As the minutes dragged on, my mind flashed back to the time I spent half an hour searching for my wireless earphones amidst gails of horizontal rain on Brighton beach, shivering and still half-soaked from a foolhardy morning swim. The experience was so horrible it transcended mere discomfort and turned into, on some level, genuinely enjoyable farce. 


That’s Icarus, that is. It’s obviously flawed, wildly frustrating and frequently janky, but it’s also somehow simultaneously good enough to have kept me playing into the early morning on multiple nights without even realizing the time. It’s like Schrodinger&#x27;s cat, except if the cat was a bear made of draining thirst meters. I went on to spend another 20 hours (mostly) happily within its grasp.

A very expensive present! But as you look closer you see that the black background isn&#x27;t the inside of a velvet box. No, that is space, and those aren&#x27;t jewels...

The trailer shows the Chief walk slowly towards a large obelisk. There’s a classic dunnn of the piano and a cool space-mushroom city. Plus lots of close ups of human faces. Honestly, it looks quite good.

                    <span>PUBG Battlegrounds is going free-to-play in January 2022. The low admission fee of zero pounds was announced at The Game Awards, which is a pretty good deal if you’re looking to participate in a battle royale that’s still very much alive and kicking. Players can also pay for Battlegrounds Plus, an account upgrade that’ll net you some extra in-game unlocks. And don&#x27;t worry, if you already own the game you&#x27;ll get that upgrade for free.

Tunic, that indie Zelda-like with a fox that you sort of thought was probably already out until I just told you it isn&#x27;t yet, finally has a release date! As announced during The Game Awards last night, we can expect it to arrive on March 16th, 2022.
We&#x27;ve been hearing about Tunic for literal years now, and its omnipresence at showcases and announceathons like The Game Awards has kept it on everyone&#x27;s radar the whole time. Feast your eyes on what will hopefully be one of the last trailers for it, until the happy day we post about a launch trailer.

                    <span>I am not great at keeping my mind palace organised. I don&#x27;t even have a mind palace. If my mind were any kind of structure it would be a Lego creative box of randomly mixed bricks. Thus, like an advanced robot, I store my memory outside my body in the form of daily to-do lists that I write up every morning. Wytchwood is a to-do list game, with each item cascading into a sub-list of more things to be ticked off. The difference is, in real life, my daily to-do list only includes &#x27;make shiny lure to catch an elf and steal its shoes&#x27; on Tuesdays.

                    <span>Remember Saints Row? It&#x27;s back, in trailer form. After Volition&#x27;s reboot of their wacky crime RPG series was revealed in August, then delayed in November, we were treated to a new gameplay trailer at last night&#x27;s Game Awards.
The trailer is a series of clips, each averaging about 3 seconds long, of different people shooting different guns and rockets and so on. So it&#x27;s technically a gameplay trailer in the way that loads of different corpses stitched together is a person (no comments from Frankenstein fans). Still, aside from confirming the new release date of August 23rd next year, I think this trailer also confirms that the new city of Santo Ileso is going to be the star of this game. Check out the trailer below to agree with me.

New studio Dramatic Labs announced Star Trek: Resurgence, a Telltale-style game about choosing your own adventure in the world of Luke Skywalker and Hans Solo. It looks hella Telltale, and they even have the digital corpse of Leonard Nimoy. But man, the Star Trek story I crave would be about downtime, not action.

                    <span>Forspoken, a game whose name I will never pronounce correctly but was once known as Project Athia, finally has a concrete release date. Announced tonight at The Game Awards, Square Enix&#x27;s big action RPG adventure will be hitting PC on May 24th 2022. I guess that technically still counts as &#x27;spring&#x27; and therefore doesn&#x27;t constitute a delay on its previous launch window, but it sure is a lot closer to summer than I was expecting. In any case, there&#x27;s a shiny new trailer with some very hammy villains to enjoy at the same time.
