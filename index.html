                              <span>The first gameplay deep dive for Madden NFL 25, which took place on July 23, showcased some of the exciting changes coming in this year&#x27;s game.


EA Sports has worked on the FieldSENSE system since it was introduced two seasons ago. This year, the system will be accompanied by BOOM tech, which relies heavily on physics-based animation. Players will be able to enjoy new mechanics in both offensive and defensive areas of the game. Based on the gameplay deep dive trailer, the new system, combined with more steps to increase authenticity, could be great news for fans. 


BOOM Tech will be changing Madden NFL 25&#x27;s offense and defense


A fundamental change in Madden NFL 25&#x27;s defense will be how the tackles hit. With the introduction of BOOM tech, the Hit Sticks, Cut Sticks, and Dive Tackles wil…</span>

                              <span>Epic Games has collaborated with Tesla to introduce its Cybertruck as a vehicle in both Fortnite and Rocket League. The collaboration went live with the new Fortnite v30.30 update, which also introduces a collaboration with Adidas, and seven new tracks for Rocket Racing.


There are several Cybertruck decals to customize the look, including a cracked window decal, which is a nod to the failed test of the armored glass during the vehicle’s presentation. Players who will purchase the Cybertruck vehicle in Fortnite will also have it unlocked in Rocket League.


To unlock the Cybertruck for free in Fortnite, you have to complete all nine objectives in the new Summer Road Trip Quest, and these must be completed by August 6. The Cybertruck will arrive in the Fortnite Item Shop on August 6. Summer Road Trip challenges will also be available in Rocket League.


Also arriving in Epic&#x27;s battle royale is an Adidas collaboration, which includes an Adid-A-LOTL backpack, among other skins that offers a variety of customization, including the choice between the three stripes logo and the Trefoil logo (the leaf logo).




The player skins from the Adidas collaboration allow players to even customize and choose between options for the head, torso, pants, shoes, and bag. There’s also a skin where the character is using the Adidas logo as a Green Goblin-style glider.


The new update also brings content for Rocket Racing, featuring seven new tracks. Here are all the new tracks available in Rocket Racing:



Obsidian - Unlock in Ranked Racing at Bronze I


Seafoam Cove - Unlock in Ranked Racing at Bronze I


Skull Rock Isle - Unlock in Ranked Racing at Silver I


Lavish Lagoon - Unlock in Ranked Racing at Silver I


Basalt Burrow - Unlock in Ranked Racing at Silver I


Twin Flame Island - Unlock in Ranked Racing at Gold I


Azure Grotto - Unlock in Ranked Racing at Gold I

                              <span>Onyx Path recently released the ashcan edition of the new urban fantasy TTRPG Curseborne to coincide with their virtual gaming convention, and the comparisons to their recently mothballed Chronicles of Darkness game are inevitable. 


Onyx Path supported Chronicles of Darkness, or CofD for short, for two decades through 11 different game lines. Each line had its own distinct identity and a deep setting filled with drama, such as the Gothic Vampire: The Requiem and the mind-bending Mage: The Awakening, but in recent months it has become clear that diehard fans will need to look somewhere else for new urban fantasy experiences.

Remember: things were bad less than a year ago, and now Destiny 2&#x27;s enjoying a bit of a renaissance. Not all is perfect, though, starting with Pathfinder.


I&#x27;ll be the first to admit that I was a fan of The Final Shape&#x27;s new weekly progression system early on: the Pathfinder looks and feels about as slick as it gets, setting you on a fast-track to endorphin-laden clicks leading you to XP, loot, and other notable goodies. Thing is, though, that the Pathfinder isn&#x27;t as efficient as the old Bounty system was, and the players have caught onto this as time went on. As it currently stands, the big Ritual Pathfinder is a bit of a mess, and a surprising number of players …</span>

                              <span>The Fortnite x Fall Guys collaboration has officially begun its first stages, with Fall Guys skins and maps available to explore. However, one way to play Fall Guys early before the v30.40 update on August 6 is by creating and playing maps through Fortnite&#x27;s Creative mode.


How to play Fall Guys in Fortnite 30.30


Playing Fall Guys in Fortnite in v30.30 requires creating a Fall Guys island through the Unreal Editor (UEFN) or Creative mode. While UEFN is a PC-exclusive program that enables you to design Fortnite experiences, Creative is a mode directly in Fortnite that that allows you to create maps. 


Generally speaking, playing Fall Guys through Creative is easier unless you&#x27;re already familiar with UEFN. With that said, if you&#x27;ve never played Creative, you can access it by searching through the available modes in Fortnite, selecting it, and loading into the mode until you enter your world.

After entering your creative world&#x27;s hub, you&#x27;ll find a golden portal and a terminal. Interacting with this terminal lets you create and select new islands. Create a new island and select Fall Guys to see the list of starter islands. Choose any that look interesting before entering the golden portal to access your world. 


Now, your character will look like a Fall Guys character, and you can play through premade obstacle courses. Alternatively, you can make your own using empty grids or modify the starter island to unleash your creativity. 


As of now, this is the only way to play Fall Guys in Fortnite&#x27;s 30.30 update. However, in 30.40, we&#x27;ll see new additions to this collaboration, including the ability to play other people&#x27;s Fall Guys island and cosmetics to fit the theme.

                              <span>Tornadus Incarnate Forme is a formidable Flying type that can often appear in Raids. You&#x27;ll need to prepare beforehand to tackle this foe, including finding its weaknesses and selecting a suitable team. We&#x27;re here to help you with this endeavor with our Pokémon Go Tornadus Incarnate Forme guide.


What is Tornadus Incarnate Forme&#x27;s weakness in Pokémon Go?


As a Flying type, Tornadus Incarnate Forme is weak against the following Pokémon:



Electric


Ice


Rock



Since Tornadus is vulnerable to three types, you&#x27;ll have more than enough choices to pick for your Pokémon Go team. However, trainers must also take advantage of movesets within these categories.

As a PlayStation player for years, I was incredibly worried about what happens when you enable the feature, but I&#x27;m pleased to report it&#x27;s smooth and seamless. 


Cross-save is a feature in many online games that allows you to merge your accounts from each platform and unify your progression. This means that instead of having characters at different levels with various items unlocked on every platform, you have one character with one level and all your items under one profile. That profile can be accessed from every account, provided you enable cross-save, meaning no matter where you play, you&#x27;ll be adding pr…</span>

                              <span>The Fortnite x Fall Guys collaboration officially begins on August 6, with a quick sneak peek already available in a particular mode. While this doesn&#x27;t let you go all-out with playing through obstacle courses and completing quests, you can check out what your favorite skin looks like as a Fall Guys character even before this update releases.


How to use Fall Guys skins in Fortnite


The only way to get Fall Guys skins in Fortnite before the collaboration officially begins on August 6 is to make a Creative island. By heading into your Creative world, finding the island terminal next to the teleportation portal, and making a Fall Guys island, your regular skin will convert to a small bean-like character you&#x27;d find in Fall Guys.

Make sure you&#x27;re specifically choosing a Fall Guys starter island when making your new world. Picking any other template will cause your regular character to spawn in. 


The downside? You&#x27;ll revert to normal once you swap back to Fortnite&#x27;s Battle Royale or LEGO modes. In other words, this isn&#x27;t a permanent change, and it mainly serves as a way to have fun with the skins until the collaboration officially begins.


Nonetheless, even if you only keep the skin while on your island, you can use this to check out what your favorite skins look like as Fall Guys characters. For example, I was able to use my go-to character, Explorer Emilie, and see how she looks in this new form. You can do this with just about any skin to see how they change.

                              <span>Fortnite&#x27;s v30.30 update is full of wild and wacky additions, from a Fall Guys collaboration to the introduction of the Tesla Cybertruck. This famous Tesla car, in particular, is well known for its peculiar geometric design, making it a fun addition to have. Here&#x27;s how to get the Tesla Cybertruck bundle in Fortnite.


How to get a free Cybertruck in Fortnite v30.30


Getting the Tesla Cybertruck in Fortnite requires completing Summer Road Trip quests, available from July 23 to August 6 when v30.40 releases. However, since one Summer Road Trip quest is released daily, the earliest you can finish them all and get the car is on July 31, when the ninth and final mission is revealed.

With each daily quest, you&#x27;ll have to earn XP by playing creator-made islands and Fortnite&#x27;s Battle Royale modes. You can also use other game modes like LEGO, Rocket Racing, and the Fortnite Festival to gain experience, depending on what the quest asks for. 


Alongside the Cybertruck, Fortnite offers other rewards like the Sun Sign Back Bling, Underworld Camo Wrap, and other cosmetic items from the Summer Road Trip quests. Finishing every mission also gives you the Beast Mode Cybertruck Boost.


How to get the Cybertruck in Fortnite after August 6


If you miss the opportunity to get the Tesla Cybertruck during the Summer Road Trip, you can purchase it through Fortnite&#x27;s premium shop starting August 6. However, while the Summer Road Trip is a free way to get the Cybertruck, buying it from the shop requires V-bucks, a paid currency. Nonetheless, although it&#x27;ll cost money, it gives you another way to get the car if you wish.

                              <span>After quite a bit of waiting, a Call of Duty title is finally making its way to the Xbox subscription service. The series&#x27; most recent entry, Modern Warfare 3, is set to release on Game Pass on July 24, 2024.


Console, PC Game Pass, and Game Pass Ultimate users can access the hit title, including its campaign storyline and MW3 Zombies mode. You&#x27;ll see the return of the elite Task Force 141 as they go on a mission to take down the notorious Vladimir Makarov.

It&#x27;s a great time to get into Modern Warfare 3 if you haven&#x27;t already. MW3 and Warzone Season 5 will launch the same day as the Game Pass debut, featuring WWE Operators, events, and new maps. The release of Black Ops 6 is also on the horizon, and some rumors have suggested that this title will be the next up for the Game Pass.


With this GP launch, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised to see other Call of Duty entries make it to the Xbox service later on. There&#x27;s certainly more than enough content to put on there, from the original Modern Warfare to the fan-favorite Black Ops 3. Plus, Call of Duty isn&#x27;t the only Activision title to get a Game Pass integration, given that Blizzard&#x27;s Diablo IV arrived on the service in March 2024. We should see more Activision titles coming to GP, both from past iterations and possible new releases. 


However, Xbox Game Pass users will see an increase in subscription prices starting on Sept. 12. As reported by The Verge, Ultimate prices will go from $16.99 to $19.99, while PC Game Pass will change from $9.99 to $11.99. Since we&#x27;re reaching August, you&#x27;ll still have over a month to see these alterations happen.


As long as you have an active Xbox subscription, you can download Modern Warfare 3 on July 24. Additional seasons typically arrive each month, so get ready for some new ventures in the near future.

Naturally, this means she has a fair bit of potential for outputting damage through some of her sweeping attacks and overall AoE damage. Like any character, however, she&#x27;s only as good as the build you make for her. Here&#x27;s the best build for Riven in LoL Swarm.


The best build for Riven in LoL Swarm


Riven&#x27;s main weapon, Bunny Hop, causes her to do sweeping attacks that can take out small groups early on, and larger groups as you get into the later stages of the game. She also sports abilities that either allow her to do an additional blast of damage or send out waves to wipe out several targets at once. The goals of this build are to further that playstyle as an area-killing machine while allowing your t…</span>

                              <span>Troglobytes games, Stupidi Pixel, and Tiny Pixel have revealed that Death Noodle Delivery, a severely nihilistic game about gig work, is coming to PS4, PS5, Switch, and Xbox Series X|S on July 31.


Death Noodle Delivery on PC this past April. I reviewed it around launch and found it to be a hauntingly nihilistic and depressing game about the world’s decline in the face of endless crises and unchecked technological advancement. It takes the core premise of Paperboy and twists it to present its dark underbelly. It also ties in some thematically crude themes to hammer its points home. It’s distressingly effective.




You play as Jimmy, who is just trying to make ends meet in an uncaring world. He takes a job delivering noodles to people on the street, but each day brings more challenges as society quickly declines and his dignity as a human gets dragged across the pavement.


The core gameplay in Death Noodle Delivery is a rather simplistic take on Paperboy, but most of the focus is on exploring Jimmy’s apartment block and talking to his neighbors. I mention this in my review, but if you just want to play Paperboy, then don’t bother. It is worth noting that one of my biggest complaints was the difficulty balancing, which has been addressed through multiple patches. If you’re up for an effective and pessimistic perspective on the world today, then definitely check it out.


In fact, I hope that the console release means that more people will try it out. It’s something that should be experienced.


Death Noodle Delivery is out now on PC. It releases for PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch on July 31, 2024.

And while it&#x27;s not out yet, this update is definitely on the horizon, featuring Unreal Engine 5 and fishing ponds.


More specifically, Slavic Magic has now put out a lovely little preview of Manor Lords&#x27; upcoming fishing pond update on Steam. That&#x27;s not the update&#x27;s official title, granted, but it sure is both memorable and picturesque, so &quot;fishing pond update&quot; is what I&#x27;m going with. The fact that the game is being updated to Unreal Engine 5 is decidedly less important, I&#x27;d say. This update is due to be &quot;completed and released within the next few weeks,&quot; though, if a launch timeline is what you were hoping to get.…</span>

                              <span>Elden Ring :Shadow Of The Erdtree offers some of the biggest challenges in contemporary gaming for most players, but apparently not for Ainrun. The Twitch streamer spent more time buffing himself up than battling Shadow of the Erdtree&#x27;s final boss, and was able to undo the DLC&#x27;s greatest challenge in one supermassive blow.


Big spoilers for Elden Ring: Shadow Of The Erdtree&#x27;s big final boss below, naturally.


The final boss of Shadow Of The Erdtree is what the Internet has dubbed &quot;Prime Radahn.&quot; He&#x27;s stronger than his base game form; much, much, more resilient, and he even enlists the help of a god whose AOE turns the battle into a serious bullet hell challenge. Ainrun&#x27;s solution? Just stacking up on the most devastating buffs in the game to get the job done as quickly as possible.




You even see the custcene where Radahn summons Miquella for help, but by the time the cutscene ends, Radahn&#x27;s in-game model is already halfway into his death animation. I hope this provides all the poor players who had been immediately destroyed by Radahn upon setting foot in the arena as much vicarious vindication as it provided me.


Ainrun had previously made the rounds for crushing Midra in much the same way, though Midra is a far less intimidating foe. Ainrun is such a beast that he was likely just using the Lord of the Frenzied Flame himself as a mere guinea pig for his magnum opus.




And before anyone gets the idea that I&#x27;m talking about a one (shot) trick pony, let it be known that Ainrun once locked himself up in the same room with five Malenias, and was the only person to come out alive.




You, too, can now learn all of Elden Ring: Shadow Of The Erdtree&#x27;s  secrets on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.

                              <span>MythicOwl has officially revealed its upcoming delivery game, Truckful. While delivery may not sound exciting (it does to me), this one has you competing with bouncy physics similar to, say, Moving Out. There are also hints of deeper mysteries.


Probably not, like, dangerous mysteries. Truckful advertises itself as a cozy delivery game, after all. However, the trailer has the truck diverted into a dark forest where some sort of sinister creature lurks. I’m only speculating here, but I’m guessing that, eventually, you have to deliver the creature’s stuff.




Truckful gives you the ability to customize your truck, then asks you to pack the load you’re delivering yourself. Like in reality, you’re not just delivering identically sized boxes, but also awkward shapes like chairs and a (surprisingly small) grand piano. The challenge there would be to jam them in places where they’re not going to bounce out.


That’s because the road maintenance in the small town you’re traveling leaves a lot to be desired and will bounce and jostle your little truck. It will only get more difficult to keep things contained if you choose to go offroad.


What surprises me most is that the trailer invariably depicts the driving from a semi-isometric angle. It’s unique, but just a bit strange for any driving game that isn’t Micro Machines or R.C. Pro-Am.


Nonetheless, the concept is very appealing to me. I bet my dad would be great at this. He delivered lumber and building supplies for a lot of his life. I’ve asked him to help me move more times than I have any right to, and he always manages to fit things together tightly without damaging them… mostly.


Truckful is coming to PC. No other platforms or a release date have been confirmed.

                              <span>Those wanting a Genshin Impact alternative on PS5 might be happy to know that Wuthering Waves is heading to the platform in the future. Publisher Kuro Games confirms a PS5 version of Wuthering Waves is in development, and there will be a playable version of the port at ChinaJoy 2024. 




&quot;We are excited to announce that the PS5 version of Wuthering Waves is now officially in development,&quot; said the Wuthering Waves X account. &quot;We&#x27;ll provide updates on the official launch time of the PS5 version in the future.&quot; A PS4 port, unfortunately, hasn&#x27;t been listed, so those on that platform are stuck with Genshin Impact.


On a positive note, the PS5&#x27;s ChinaJoy booth from July 23 to July 26 seems exciting for those who can attend the event. In addition to Wuthering Waves, it will feature the promising 3D platformer Astro Bot,  the fast-paced action game AI LIMIT, and the upcoming fighting game Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves. If Wuthering Waves is already playable on PS5, it hopefully shouldn&#x27;t take too long for the port to launch. By the way, with this lineup, it&#x27;s quite odd that PlayStation&#x27;s skipping Gamescom. 


Wuthering Waves does seem to be a future highlight, especially for the free-to-play space on PS5. The next update v1.1 includes two new resonators (heroes) Jinhsi and Changli, who are both five-star characters that play a major role in the storyline. There&#x27;s also going to be a boss battle with Jué, one of Huanglong&#x27;s six Sentinels. 


For some, Wuthering Waves arguably has a more evolved combat system and better graphics, so competition between Genshin and Kuro Games&#x27; offering should get interesting when it hits PS5.

                              <span>In Warframe, there are numerous frames to choose from, each offering its unique advantages. However, a select few Warframes stand out as must-haves above the rest, regardless of the content you are running.


The best Warframes for any challenge


Each Warframe on this list is exceptionally equipped to tackle any challenge in the game. Their powerful abilities and robust survival tools make them capable of excelling in any scenario Warframe presents. That said, thanks to Warframe&#x27;s extensive modding system, there are always ways to make any frame work. If the frame you think is best is not on this list, worry not. It means you&#x27;ve got a winning strategy that most aren&#x27;t aware of.

                              <span>It&#x27;s easy to get lost in the Sands of Time mode&#x27;s labyrinth-like layout. You may even have trouble finding the exit, especially if you&#x27;re overwhelmed with enemy hordes. To help you do this, we&#x27;ll show you how to successfully escape Sands of Time in the MCC x Minecraft 15th Anniversary Party.


Minecraft MCC Party 2024 Sands of Time Challenge guide


You can successfully escape the Sands of Time mini-game using the Nether Portal by the entrance. This portal is the only way out, as the map doesn&#x27;t seem to have any hidden exit points.

Players must survive for two minutes to complete the Sands of Time Challenge in the Minecraft MCC Party event. Stick around the entry area so you don&#x27;t stray too far from the portal. It may also be best to pick up some time boosts since you&#x27;ll initially start with two minutes. I suggest reaching the required duration with at least a few seconds to spare, giving you enough time to escape.


If you happen to get lost, use the portal signs to guide you back to the entrance. Fortunately, you&#x27;ll have plenty of time boosts on these pathways to increase your duration. Remember to grab some coins, too, which can be exchanged for rewards later on.

Once you use the portal to get out, the game should notify you of your successful escape. Those who don&#x27;t utilize this route will see a significant decrease in coins as a penalty for their failed attempt.


Survive the two minutes and escape to complete the Sands of Time Challenge in the MCC x Minecraft 15th Anniversary Party. This feat will earn you the Victory Cartwheel Emote, allowing you to share your win with fellow crafters. There are still plenty more challenges to tackle, including the Mystery Cave. Complete them all to earn the prestigious MC Championship Cape.

Tallow Candles are not a new material in FFXIV. They’ve been around since the introduction of Heavensward and are mostly used in low to mid-level crafting recipes, particularly indoor and outdoor lighting items. However, this old ingredient is now a key part of XRral Soj’s Metalwares quests in Dawntrail.

                              <span>Capcom is one of the biggest companies in the gaming world, a position it&#x27;s pretty much held consistently for several decades now. As such, you&#x27;d think it would know what it&#x27;s talking about when it comes to the industry at large, and it seems as though physical games are still very much within the developer&#x27;s wheelhouse.


According to a Q&amp;A session, as noted in the 45th Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders, Capcom is still keen on providing physical products to its customers. A question on page three asks whether the increase of digital sales could change the way the company deals with physical games. The answer from Capcom reads:



Given that a significant number of end users demand physical games we currently do not expect to eliminate physical products.

                              <span>The legacy of Skyrim is such that it feels as though there will never be a time when it&#x27;s not in the gaming limelight. I&#x27;m partly to blame for that, given all the articles I do about fan-made mods. But what can I say? The community does a lot of work to keep TES5&#x27;s head above the water, improving on Bethesda&#x27;s original release. Oh hell, let&#x27;s talk about one more.


This one comes from Nexus Mods user Enneal (as spotted by DSO Gaming), and is for those who like a little sea travel with their (specifically Special Edition of) Skyrim. The &quot;Functional Ships&quot; download essentially adds point-to-point travel between the game&#x27;s ports via the use of ships.




The video above gives a brief idea of what you can expect, with the mod even allowing you to explore the inside of your vessel as it sails across the water. Enneal says it adds six new ships, though apparently not all of them include interiors.


Skyrim by sea...&quot;Searim&quot;


It seems as though &quot;Functional Ships&quot; is best paired with other custom additions to the game, so it&#x27;s unlikely that it will work with the basic, vanilla version of the game. Still, if you&#x27;ve been playing The Elder Scrolls 5 for the last 12 years, chances are your version is modded to Oblivion (little TES humor there) already.


As for features, here&#x27;s what Enneal&#x27;s offering comes with:



Point-to-point travel


Ships reflect quest progress &amp; world events


Accessible interiors from moving ships


Real-time(-ish) travel while inside ships


Ships travel between all ports on the Sea of Ghosts, including Raven Rock



Maybe one day I&#x27;ll stop talking about Skyrim mods. Today is clearly not that day. Onwards we go!

                              <span>Sony and developer Arrowhead Game Studios have just announced the biggest update for Helldivers 2 yet: Escalation of Freedom. The update adds new enemies for players to battle, more mission objectives, and even additional difficultly modes to fight through.


The Escalation of Freedom update for Helldivers 2 is built on the feedback the developer has received for the game since its initial launch in February and will be released on August 6, 2024. If you&#x27;ve been playing since then, you know as well as I do that mission objectives quickly grew stale, and higher difficulty modes are needed now we&#x27;ve all been playing for a few months. This update looks set to shatter player expectations and make the galaxy feel even more hostile as we battle for managed democracy.

                              <span>It recently emerged that yet another pirate movie streaming app managed to evade Apple&#x27;s stringent vetting process for more than a year. With incidents like this running in parallel with apps that are blatantly infringing, a new discussion paper asks what more can be done to prevent apps and app stores being used for infringing purposes. We also suggest a free tool to limit exposure to app-related risks.

The Casting of Frank Stone is Game Informer’s cover story this month, and we learned some exclusive details about the upcoming horror game during our trip to Behaviour Interactive’s studio in Montreal. Speaking to Supermassive creative director Steve Goss, he clued us in on the game’s most central and unique mechanic: the Super 8mm camera. 
Set within the Dead by Daylight universe, the game story unfolds in the summer of 1980 in the unassuming small town of Cedar Hills. It follows a group of teenagers who set out to film a horror movie at an abandoned …</span>

                              <span>Helldivers 2 has been one of 2024’s biggest successes, and developer Arrow Head Games is prepping to launch its most substantial update yet. Escalation of Freedom is an upcoming update that adds new missions, new hazards, and, of course, new bugs.
Arriving on August 6, Escalation of Freedom challenges players with a new level 10 difficulty and introduces new mission objectives, such as locating and extracting a crying larva that attracts Terminids. The game also receives new, larger fortress-like outposts for players to capture. The swamp biome gets a spookier facelift, and acid storms can now reduce the armor for players and enemies so both sides take greater damage. New Terminids and Automatons will clash with players, and Arrow Head Games teases that Escalation of Freedom features more surprises players will have to discover on their own. Check out the trailer for a look at what&#x27;s to come. 


Escalation of Freedom also brings quality-of-life improvements including an update to address grief kicking. Per the PlayStation Blog, the game is getting &quot;a system where if a player is kicked, they will spawn into a new session as the host with all of the team’s loot from their previous session. All items can now be picked up by the player before extraction. The squad doing the kicking will see a message in the chat widget that a player has been kicked, yet their loot remains unchanged.&quot;

                              <span>Last year&#x27;s Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III will be available on Xbox Game Pass tomorrow, July 24. This marks the next big Activision Blizzard title to join the service. 
The move comes less than a year after Modern Warfare III launched last November and represents the fruit of Microsoft&#x27;s $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard last year. It’s also the biggest AB title to appear on Game Pass since Diablo IV was added to the library in March.


This gives subscribers a chance to check out last year’s entry before 2024’s installment, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, launches on Game Pass on October 25. It also comes ahead of the new Game Pass price increases and subscription tier arriving in September, a move the FTC has taken issue with.

                              <span>Dead by Daylight (DBD) has been one of the most popular multiplayer games (and horror titles in general) since its launch in 2016, but fans have dreamed of experiencing its universe in a single-player format. Developer Behaviour Interactive agreed and enlisted the cinematic storytelling expertise of Supermassive Games (Until Dawn, The Dark Pictures Anthology, The Quarry) to create an original story in the DBD universe. That game became The Casting of Frank Stone, and it terrorizes Game Informer’s cover this month.


We traveled to Behaviour’s studio in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, to play an early slice of the game and speak to lead developers from both studios to learn how the collaboration came to be. The story also reveals some of the DBD-style mechanics remixing Supermassive’s traditional…</span>

Updated with Arranger: A Role-Puzzling Adventure and The Star Named EOS. Enjoy!

From the very beginning, Nintendo handhelds have been a powerhouse in the puzzle genre, championing games that might have been lost in the bombastic, graphics-obsessed arena of home consoles. Switch’s bridging of the portable/home console divide means it upholds that proud puzzling tradition and gives on-the-go gamers a chance to dive deeper than ever before into the ever-addictive world of puzzlers.

After a brief delay, the latest UK charts are in and while all of the familiar faces remain at the top, Prime Day sales have shaken things up elsewhere.
The top three are unchanged this time around, with Hogwarts Legacy, EA Sports FC 24 and Luigi&#x27;s Mansion 2 HD claiming the podium. The only real surprises in the top ten this week are the inclusion of Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown at ninth thanks to some recent sales — considering it hasn&#x27;t even made the top 40 for a while, that&#x27;s not bad going — and The Witcher III: Wild Hunt Complete Edition making the jump from 37th to tenth.

                              <span>Firm cites significant user demand.
During Capcom&#x27;s 45th General Shareholders meeting, the firm confirmed that it currently has no plans to end support for physical media.
The firm stated that due to a &quot;significant number of end users&quot; currently demanding physical games, it does not expect to &quot;eliminate physical products&quot;. This will no doubt come as good news to many at a time when digital media is growing exponentially every year.

Nintendo Japan has today revealed six new designs joining the &#x27;Controller Button Collection&#x27; — a range of miniature fidget cube-like keychains inspired by classic Nintendo controllers.
On top of the initial NES and Famicom designs, the collection now also includes buttons and sticks based on the SNES, N64 and GameCube. There are two SNES designs with European and North American colourways, but the stars of the show have to be the N64 and GC models, which brandish each controller&#x27;s button layout and control stick (or the little C-stick, in the GameCube&#x27;s case). Imagine having one of them to play with while you walk to work.

Photos capture a moment in time with full objectivity. They can defy our version of events, and settle ‘that’s not how it happened’ arguments. In these cases, you could say fitting a photo into one’s memory becomes a…puzzle.
For this review’s sake, please think about that metaphor, because it&#x27;s the premise of The Star Named EOS. Silver Lining Studio and PLAYISM have delivered a puzzler built into an emotional narrative. And, like a photo, this game is just a brief snapshot, yet it manages to tell an in-depth story.

Mega Man has received a lot of collections in recent years, but there hasn&#x27;t actually been a new mainline entry in the series since the release of Mega Man 11 in 2018. It seems there is no need to worry though, as Capcom has once again reassured fans that this classic series is still a big part of its plans going forward.
During its 45th General Shareholders meeting, Capcom mentioned how Mega Man is still one of the company&#x27;s most &quot;highly-valued IPs&quot; and it&#x27;s always &quot;considering how to create games for it on an ongoing basis&quot; (thanks, Rockman Corner).

It&#x27;s been a challenging year for the games industry and following last week&#x27;s story about potential Mortal Kombat studio layoffs, Warner Bros. Games has now announced it&#x27;s acquired Player First Games. This studio might not necessarily be a household name, but it released its first game MultiVersus in May.
According to a report from Variety, the studio will continue to be run by the co-founders Tony Huynh and Chris White, who have years of experience in the games industry. Here&#x27;s what Warner Bros. Games president David Haddad had to say about the acquisition:

Following a patch earlier this month, the &quot;DAY60 Patch&quot; has now been rolled out for all platforms including the Switch.
This patch improves the functionality and stability of the game on the Switch and bumps this particular build up to Version 1.0.7:

                              <span>In the heyday of Sierra&#x27;s adventure game years, there was a series called Space Quest that featured an intergalactic janitor named Roger Wilco. The series was more satirical than King&#x27;s Quest, less preachy than Police Quest, and not quite as adult as Leisure Suit Larry. Spearheaded by Scott Murphy and Mark Crowe - a pair of devs who called themselves &quot;Two Guys from Andromeda&quot; - Space Quest was renowned for its humour, and there was a nice sense of progression throughout most of the series, with Roger Wilco leveling up from working class spaceman to the head of his own Star Trek ship.
Tachyon Dreams Anthology, a collection of three short games previously released on Itch.io, is clearly channeling Space Quest. Made by indie dev Cosmic Void, AKA Aviv Salinas, each episode of Tachyon Dreams pu…</span>

                              <span>Between Against The Storms’ critters, Manor Lords’s perfect oxen, and now Cataclismo, Hooded Horse’s roster of strategy games share a common thread that many guard-the-village-em-ups can fatally overlook: they present a civilisation that’s worth protecting. Even if the fallen culture you’ll defend against waves of gribblies offers fascinatingly few concrete details on its origins, there’s a lithe and impressionistic otherworldliness and use of colour in Cataclismo’s art that evokes unearthed layers of history. Also, everyone is just so gosh darn likeable, with their foppish hats plopped atop stretched bodies, and dialogue that remains resolute, chirpy, and eager, even when you’re click-marching these poor folk straight to their deaths.
Still, none of this will stop me will sacrificing every last man, woman, and child of these beleaguered warriors if it means preserving a single one of my immaculately crafted staircases.

That&#x27;s right: Valve have added some new crates just outside of counter-terrorist spawn, near bombsite A. This means that players can now use these boxes to hop from CT up to catwalk with little fuss, where previously you&#x27;d need to use your teammates&#x27; heads as a springboard. What does this mean as a layperson who sort of plays the game sometimes? More than you might think!

                              <span>A glance at comedy medieval medic sim Stretcher Men might have you believe it is a co-op game about co-ordination and teamwork. Not so! It&#x27;s a singleplayer game in which you control not one but both carriers of a stretcher. You have to ferry a sick man over the hilly countryside, past muddy lake banks and over snowy mountains, all without dropping him on the ground. I can only imagine it controls a bit like Brothers: A Tale Of Two Sons, but with added ragdoll jollity. We&#x27;ll know next week, when it releases on Steam.

                              <span>One of the most memorable moments of Metro Exodus comes from a standoff with a giant catfish, who you have to avoid for a while (along with the cultists who worship it) before going &quot;fishing&quot; using an entire human corpse as bait. I didn&#x27;t expect to see any rival catfish appearing in games after that, but now that I think about it - why not? They&#x27;re a naturally freaky animal, perfect video game antagonists. And the developers of upcoming Japanese folklore &#x27;em up Otoshi No Shima seem to understand this, having created a monstrous creature with a gaping mouth that follows the player at every turn. Come see.

                              <span>Readers, something actually magical has happened! I’ve spent a non-zero amount of time this week compiling a wishlist for potential Stardew Valley-likes that also let me keep pets. I wasn’t sure what I wanted to play, but I knew I was burnt out on both stabbing and shooting, and wanted something light and colourful with a solid loop that I could veg out (pun intended) with at the end of the day. I even went to so far as to create a chap named Karrot King in Stardew before quitting in disgust because I couldn’t easily access carrot seeds.
I cannot in good conscious claim that I manifested such a videogame - that was the work of Skyreach Studio. However, this is the internet, so I will both take credit for it and offer you an exclusive discount on my course. While I’m waiting for your membership fee to arrive, I’ll be playing Critter Crops. It’s a witchy farming sim in which you grow odd pets and cast spells from flesh-bound grimoires. One of the verbs it offers on its Steam page is &#x27;noodle&#x27;. Apologies to all the other games on my wishlist.

                              <span>Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3’s latest patch was due to launch in closed beta yesterday, but Larian have decided to give it a bit more time in the oven due to bugs. Namely, a bug that caused passive rolls - like those that detect traps - to stop working.
Happily, if you hadn’t already registered to take part in the beta, you now have more time to sign up. Scroll down a bit on the RPG’s Steam page and click the ‘Request Access’ button.

I don’t expect to get to read eBooks via my Spotify subscription, any more than I would think Hello Fresh would send out movies.

After blowing past its Kickstarter target, there&#x27;s now a playable demo.

                              <span>Arranger is a puzzle game about moving, in both metaphorical and literal senses. Movement is the entire basis for the puzzles in Arranger, and is hard to explain without showing you (if you&#x27;re able to watch the trailer that will be helpful). The world of Arranger is divided into a grid, and you don&#x27;t move the main character, feisty misfit kid Jemma, across the squares. Rather, imagine that the row or column Jemma is on becomes a travelator, and you control the direction and speed of it. Jemma stands still and you move the ground, and anything on it left, right, up or down - like How To Say Goodbye but with more squares. It&#x27;s one of those things that makes sense when you&#x27;re doing it, trust me.

                              <span>Heihachi Mishima, the mustachioed malevolence of the Tekken series, is going to be the next DLC character for Tekken 8. He was last seen with his loving son Kazuya, who threw him into a volcano. Of course, to be fully submerged in impossibly hot liquid rock is merely a long-running family prank for the cast of this 3D fighting game, sort of like forcing your granddad to do the ice bucket challenge, but with lava. Nobody truly expected the horn-haired headbutter to be fully removed from the series. But I am a little surprised to see him back so soon.

But I still have this one last feature to publish, and it&#x27;s about Bellara Lutara, the Dalish elf and member of the new Veil Jumpers faction in the game. During my visit to BioWare&#x27;s Edmonton, Canada, office earlier this year, I checked out the game&#x27;s expansive character creator, its in medias res prologue, and the first mission after said prologue.
Though BioWare released a big look at Veilguard&#x27;s prologue via a 20-minute gameplay trailer last month, they haven&#x27;t released much about that subsequent mission, where you meet and recruit your first companion, Bellara. I learned a lot about this character, and knowing I was one of the first outside of the stud…</span>

Kunitsu-Gami is the kind of wonderful, left-field Capcom release we don’t see often these days. Bound to be a cult classic in the future, Path of the Goddess is original and does not lean on any of Capcom’s established properties. Instead, it relies on an admittedly difficult-to-explain but well-executed gameplay loop that I found hard to put down with an art style that is equally challenging to look away from.
Players take on the role of Soh, a masked swordsperson bound to protect the divine maiden Yoshiro as she slowly dances along the path …</span>

                              <span>MultiVersus has two new fighters on the way in the form of Jack from Cartoon Network/Adult Swim&#x27;s beloved animated series Samurai Jack and Beetlejuice of, well, Beetlejuice and its upcoming sequel (don’t make me write it a third time). The game is also getting a ranked mode.
Samurai Jack and Beetlejuice are part of the Season 2: Back in Time content, which kicks off tomorrow, July 23. Jack becomes available at launch, letting players cut down opponents using his signature katana (as you can see in the trailer below). Beetlejuice arrives later in the season at an unknown date, so we don&#x27;t get to see him in action just yet. However, Warner Bros. confirms he’ll become playable before the September 6 theatrical premiere of Beetlejuice Beetlejuice. 


Season 2 also introduces a new ranked mode, allowing players to battle for leaderboard points to earn exclusive rank-based cosmetics. A new map, the Warner Bros. Water Tower, will also be added.
MultiVersus is available now on PlayStation and Xbox consoles as well as PC. Since its return, the game has been bolstered by new fighters such as The Joker, The Matrix&#x27;s Agent Smith, and Friday the 13th&#x27;s Jason Voorhees.</span>

                              <span>Perhaps the most unexpected announcement at EVO 2024 was the reveal that 2003’s SNK vs. Capcom: SVC Chaos is being re-released. Not only does this make it available on modern platforms with new bells and whistles, but you can play it right now. 
The game was originally launched in 2003 for the Neo Geo arcade before it was ported to PlayStation 2 (in Japan) and Xbox in the U.S. It pits 36 fighters from SNK franchises such as The King of Fighters, Samurai Shodown, and Metal Slug 2 against Capcom fighters from series like Street Fighter, Mega Man, Darkstalkers, and more.


SVC Chaos now features quality-of-life updates such as a hitbox viewer, rollback netcode for online play, and an art gallery. It also makes formerly secret characters Athena and Red Arremer available from the start. The game&#x27;s surprise launch on Steam on July 20 followed its reveal, and it comes to PlayStation 4 and Switch today. You can pick it up now for $19.99.</span>

                              <span>On an almost weekly basis, Fortnite announces new crossover events, adding characters to its Battle Royale, Lego, and Festival modes. Whether it&#x27;s a fictional character like Jack Sparrow or a real person like Ariana Grande, it&#x27;s hard to find a corner of pop culture the game hasn&#x27;t touched. These crossovers, however, are almost always exclusive to characters, but Fortnite players don&#x27;t always have to traverse the Battle Royale map on foot – there are vehicles as well. Today&#x27;s crossover comes in the form of a particularly polygonal vehicle: Tesla&#x27;s Cybertruck.

For the unfamiliar, the Cybertruck is one of Tesla&#x27;s latest electric vehicles, a futuristic-looking pickup truck with a distinct shape and stainless steel exterior. It&#x27;s a vehicle that, quite frankly, always looked like it belonged in a video game, both because of its angular aesthetic and the word &quot;cyber&quot; in its name.
It&#x27;s unclear exactly how the truck will be present in Fortnite, as the trailer doesn&#x27;t include any actual gameplay, but it&#x27;s likely a vehicle skin that can be purchased from the in-game store. With car skins attached, whenever a player enters a vehicle, it will morph into the selected skin of their choice, and it&#x27;s available in Battle Royale and Rocket Racing alike. This is purely speculation, however – it&#x27;s equally possible the vehicle is introduced in some other limited-time event.
The Cybertruck will be added to Fortnite tomorrow. If you drive one, just pray your opposing players aren&#x27;t wielding a steel ball.
how do you feel about the Cybertruck being added to Fortnite? what other vehicles would you like to see in the game? Let us know in the comments!</span>

                              <span>Tekken 8’s next Season 1 fighter was revealed during Evo this weekend, and it’s none other than Heihachi Mishima. The mainstay villain has apparently survived his presumed death (again) and is ready to reclaim his throne. 
A cinematic trailer rolls out the red carpet for Heihachi, setting up his return after he was seemingly killed (i.e., tossed into a volcanic lava river) in Tekken 7. The video doesn’t explain how Heihachi managed not to melt into goop, but he does sport a Kazuya-esque scar on his chest now, so he didn’t walk away completely unscathed. 


Heihachi becomes available sometime this fall. He follows Eddy Gordo and Lidia Sobieska, who joined Tekken 8 in the spring (i.e., July 25) and summer, respectively, leaving one fighter left for the winter season. Owners of Tekken 8’s Deluxe, Ultimate, or Collector&#x27;s Editions automatically receive these fighters, and each can also be purchased individually for $7.99.

Publisher Devolver Digital and developer Skeleton Crew Studio have revealed Forestrike, a kung-fu roguelike all about solving puzzles and landing punches.
Set to launch on Switch next year, Forestrike will put you in the shoes of Yu, a martial artist on a mission across the country to save his Emperor. As you might imagine, there will be a fair amount of fighting along the way, but this isn&#x27;t your usual action-focused roguelike as you&#x27;ll be relying on Yu&#x27;s &#x27;Foresight&#x27; ability to play out combat encounters ahead of time and learn how to escape them unscathed.

Inspired by the Nintendo World Championships and acting as a sort of spiritual follow-up to the NES Remix games, it was a bit of a surprise announcement back in May. Yep, Nintendo pulled another one of those — game announcement in May, release it in July... slow down.

Stardew Valley creator Eric Barone, better known as ConcernedApe, has pledged to never charge money for any DLC or update.
The statement originated with a brief social media update on the 1.6 content for Nintendo Switch and other platforms, with ConcernedApe stating that it, along with the next PC update, is still in progress. Beyond that, there is little else to report, but one user responded to the statement by expressing fans&#x27; appreciation for the ongoing updates, noting that they likely won&#x27;t be bothered by the lengthy wait so long as the content remains free.

We have mused on the idea of a &#x27;Paper Zelda&#x27; game before, but &#x27;Paper Pokémon&#x27;? That&#x27;s not something we ever thought we needed. Until today, that is.
Animator and artist Spyrook has created a Pokémon-meets-Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door mash-up and it looks incredible. In the above video, you can witness a duo battle between Riolu / Ralts and Mawile / &quot;Eevee&quot; (though there&#x27;s something shifty going on with the latter), lovingly recreated in Paper Mario&#x27;s theatre setting.

There isn’t another puzzle game like Arranger: A Role-Puzzling Adventure. It makes sense that a game about celebrating the differences between humans and the world would be so different. With Arranger, Furniture &amp; Mattress – the studio formed by the lead writer on Carto, the artist of Braid, and the puzzle designer on ETHEREAL – wants to give every single person, no matter their differences, a warm embrace. Different is beautiful, and Arranger is here to tell us that in the most chipper, heartwarming way.
You might have guessed it already, but Arranger is more than just a puzzle game. As the title suggests, it borrows a lot from the role-playing genre, mostly in terms of its story. There are boss fights, dungeons, usable weapons, and gadgets – really, while it could be an RPG, it’s just as akin to a Legend of Zelda title, albeit with a coming-of-age slant.

Last year, Japanese toy company Re-Ment released a range of Pikmin terrarium figures and we collectively lost our minds over their cuteness. Well, guess what? There&#x27;s a new collection coming to Japan this Winter and we are once again itching to get our hands on them.
Re-Ment took to Twitter to reveal the new collection, which this time is modelled on the world of Pikmin 4. There are six different figures available in the upcoming blind box range, each displaying a Pikmin scenario playing out in a &#x27;glass&#x27; (or, more accurately, plastic) bottle.

Yet, at the time of writing, something more unusual catches the eye. Channels that have been dormant for 15+ years, or newer channels showing zero signs of previous infringement, are suddenly offering the latest Hollywood movies. Viewing numbers are vast - easily tens of millions - but the true number could be even higher.

Hlavní změnou je použití více jader při kompresi, jelikož moderní NVMe disky jsou nyní rychlejší. S použitím všech jader je komprese obzvláště na vyšších stupních (9 a 12) několikrát rychlejší (5–8×). Dekomprese je již při jednom vlákně rychlá jako NVMe, ale použitím překrývajících se IO operací bylo dosaženo zrychlení o asi 60 %.</span>

                              <span>Link-Busters has become the first anti-piracy company to report more than a billion &#x27;copyright-infringing&#x27; URLs to Google search.  The new milestone is driven by a surge in takedown efforts from publishers, who are doing all they can to make it harder for shadow libraries to operate. The top targeted domains are linked to Anna&#x27;s Archive and Z-Library, with Penguin Random House the most active rightsholder.

Carian Sovereignty is one such Ash of War that Intelligence builds aren’t going to want to miss in the game’s Shadow of the Erdtree expansion. It can absolutely decimate your foes with a giant magical sword. Awesome.

                              <span>After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora&#x27;s Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora&#x27;s Mask&#x27;s unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 1:00 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved.

                              <span>Last week, Xbox announced it was introducing new Game Pass tiers and raising its subscription prices for existing members on September 12. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) took issue with these changes in a filing yesterday to the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.
In case you missed it, Microsoft revealed a new tier called Xbox Game Pass Standard, a $15 monthly subscription for new members that excludes day-one releases, EA Play, PC Game Pass, and cloud gaming. Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, which includes those perks, will have its monthly price raised from $17 to $20. Xbox Game Pass Core, which only offers online play and a smaller library, is raising its yearly sub from $60 to $75 (the $10 monthly fee remains unchanged). PC Game Pass is increasing from $10 per month to $12.

Successful rebuilds require strong foundations. After a drought, Alabama’s Nick Saban reinforced his staff with innovative coordinators like Kirby Smart and Lane Kiffin. Urban Meyer urged beloved Gators captain Tim Tebow to inspire his teammates. And during his short tenure at Texas A&amp;M, Jimbo Fisher secured extraordinary recruiting classes. The road to success is paved in various ways, but EA Orlando knows football doesn’t have to be rocket science. In EA Sports College Football 25 (CFB 25), coaching chemistry is an engaging skil…</span>

                              <span>Paramount has canceled Halo, the live-action TV adaptation of Xbox’s flagship franchise, after two seasons. The show’s second season premiered on Paramount+ earlier this year. 
According to The Hollywood Reporter’s sources, Halo showrunners Amblin, Xbox, and 343 Industries are seeking a new outlet for a potential third season, with Paramount reportedly supporting the move. 
“Paramount+ can confirm that ‘Halo’ will not move forward with a third season on the service,” Paramount said in a statement. “We are extremely proud of this ambitious series and would like to thank our partners at Xbox, 343 Industries and Amblin Television, along with showrunner and executive producer David Wiener, his fellow executive producers, the entire cast led by Pablo Schreiber as Master Chief and the amazing crew for all their outstanding work. We wish everyone the best going forward.”
After years of development, Halo premiered on Paramount+ on March 24, 2022, and stars Pablo Schreiber as Master Chief. Season 1 received a mixed reception from critics and fans, with many lambasting it for deviating from the games’ established lore and characterizations. Season 2, which premiered earlier this year on February 8 and concluded on March 21, was received more positively, with several critics and viewers hailing it as a dramatic improvement. Season 1 currently sits at 70% on Rotten Tomatoes/61 on Metacritic. Season 2 garnered a 90% on Rotten Tomatoes/64 on Metacritic.

Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn does its best to provide an epic adventure despite clear limitations. This semi-open world action game’s bright spots include an exciting premise, a unique tag-team spin on Souls-inspired combat, and an entertaining exploration mechanic. Unfortunately, it falls short of providing a wholly satisfying or polished adventure, resulting in a respectable but flawed revenge quest. 
Developer A44 has crafted an intriguing world that blends a colonial aesthetic and technology (think 18th or…</span>

                              <span>Skeleton Crew, the team behind the 2021 side-scrolling action game Olija, and Devolver Digital have revealed an intriguing new project: Forestrike. The game sports a unique premise: as a martial artist, you can foresee and simulate future combat encounters, allowing you to perfect your execution before laying a finger on anyone. 
The fighter battles to free a captive Emperor from an evil Admiral, and doing so involves mastering Foresight, a meditative technique to mentally predict and play out battles before they unfold (for Dragon Ball fans, think of image training). Gameplay-wise, players are pitted against different combinations of enemy types. They use Foresight to play the battle in advance to find the optimal approach to defeating them while taking little to no damage.
For example, using Foresight may help you learn to dodge a charging enemy so they trample an ally, then finish him off by lobbing a nearby weapon. Determining the best approach may take several Foresight attempts, but once you have your strategy down, you then execute the battle in real-time. After winning a fight, a replay feature allows you to rewatch it using slow-motion and other editing tools to study your strategy or generally feel cool about your performance. 


Using the Foresight makes Forestrike&#x27;s combat feel puzzle-like in its execution, and winning fights as flawlessly as possible matters. That’s because you have limited health to fight through multiple stages in a roguelike-style branching map. Along the way, you’ll earn upgrades that carry over to future runs, as well as perks called Techniques that enhance your abilities. 
Forestrike is a neat spin on the action genre, and it&#x27;s slated to launch sometime in 2025 for Switch and PC.</span>

                              <span>Ho, wayfarer! Beware slight spoilers for Alan Wake 2 in the passages ahead.

Deep in the Dark Place of Alan Wake 2 there is a forest that is not a forest - a zig-zag tunnel adorned with murals of a grisly woodland scene. Entering that tunnel, you find yourself sealed in at either end. But the mural suggests a way out: it changes when you turn around, following an unspoken narrative. It&#x27;s a device as delicate as the graffiti elsewhere in the Dark Place is obnoxious. In hindsight, it feels like an example of &quot;metsänpeitto&quot;, a concept from Finnish folklore about forests which, as writer Sinikka Annala explains, saturates the design of Alan Wake 2. It&#x27;s a fascinating idea I&#x27;d love certain much larger, less intriguing video game worlds to learn from.

                              <span>Our former editor Katharine &quot;Thorsbane&quot; Castle has long since quit these turgid shores for the sunny uplands of Eurogamer, where the consoles multiply like rabbits, but her legacy endures. For instance, it&#x27;s thanks to her that I know and am excited about Roots of Yggdrasil, a roguelike deck-and-city-builder which casts you as a posse of vikings in a flying longship, touching down on floating islands to found a quick settlement and harvest some magic before the apocalypse - here known as the Ginnungagap, a swirling purple void - catches up with them.
Katharine called it &quot;a real grower&quot; before the early access release in January, likening it to both Dorfromantik and The Banished Vault - a chalk and cheese comparison if ever I heard one. Well rejoice, perverted chalk-and-cheese mixers, because Roots of Yggdrasil now has a 1.0 release date - 6th September 2024.

Following the Steam and PC Game Pass releases yesterday, there are widespread reports of heavy stuttering spoiling the fun; I’ve given both versions a test, and indeed, Flintlock does have a serious case of the framerate stammers. Especially the Game Pass build, which is significantly worse for it.

                              <span>I am burning the Bishop while he sleeps. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s nothing personal, but quite a lot in medieval management sim Norland is personal. He shouldn&#x27;t have slept with the Queen&#x27;s sister, for example. He shouldn&#x27;t have insisted his lover subsequently pay him for a confession to absolve herself of the guilt accrued from sleeping with him. He shouldn&#x27;t have felt safe in a room next to the Queen, a woman described as &quot;reckless&quot; in her character traits, and who is perilously close to having a nervous breakdown. This, my holy friend, is how your bed chamber becomes a raging inferno. 
By the end of my first game of Norland, the village of Nandos (you can name your own settlements) is covered in more blood than the back end of the bard&#x27;s best work. In storytelling terms, it is a tragedy. In terms of fantasy management games? It is great fun. The failure cascade as waterslide.

                              <span>Like many an addled follower of the games industry, I have recently fallen under the spell of Balatro, and especially, its jokers. The mechanics and overall presentation may be exquisite, but it’s the thrill of discovering another mutant jester modifier that has me lunging for the Steam Deck in my sleep. Well, now those jokers have competition: ducks. Step or rather waddle forward Placid Plastic Deck - A Quiet Quest, a quacked-up card battler which somehow takes inspiration from both the Pokémon series and Inscryption.

I did not know  how utterly burnt out I was on violence and misery until I held one of pet simulation Bobo Bay’s sentient blob critters in my arms and lavished snacks upon it. When I close my eyes, I can still hear Conscript’s shells falling in the distance. But here and now, there are only Bobos, the races they take part in, and the idyllic bay in which they reside.

                              <span>Many moons ago, I remember having a chat with Brendy about FPS Metro Exodus’s choice to have characters frequently speak over each other in conversation. It’s something I always appreciate in films (Brendy mentioned Fleabag, I brought up Shane Meadows), and although the flow of many of Exodus’ scenes were quite awkward, it was still refreshing to see a game break away from the common, unnatural back-and-forth line delivery. Bioshock and Judas’s Ken Levine has a name for this - “turn-based dialogue.” According to Levine, it’s “one of the biggest problems” in the way games portray conversations.

                              <span>Everybody knows that Counter-Strike&#x27;s asymmetric levels are its best. If only someone had told its millions of players. Counter-Strike creator Minh Le seems to agree with me at least, naming cs_siege as one of his favourites in a recent interview.

Alas, the streets of video game development are meaner than first thought, and its release date has now slipped until October 22nd.

Its video game adaptation, meanwhile, is a free-to-play, multiplayer, with several team-based modes. It now has an Early Access release date: August 6th.

                              <span>Crow Country, Conscript, and now Vultures - Scavengers Of Death. We really do seem to be living through a craze for PS1-style horror games. Vultures is different to the others, though, in that it&#x27;s turn-based zombie crunching combined with roguelike scavenging to survive and get more powerful. It&#x27;s arriving on Steam sometime soon and it&#x27;s probably worth a looksy if you&#x27;re after biohazard disposal with a tactical twist.

Tomorrow, I promise, it&#x27;ll be wall-to-wall wholesome life sims, pastel petals and hug emojis as far as the eye can see. But before then, a quick piece on well-received DreadXP-published horror sim The Mortuary Assistant, which will shortly be updated with an &quot;endless embalming-only mode&quot; that strips out the game&#x27;s supernatural scares and turns it into a very downbeat job sim.

                              <span>A good immersive sim, by its very nature, offers myriad varied approaches to solving problems. And yet, I find myself wanting to get hyper-specific when writing about the action of Corpus Edax, because it has an incredibly gratifying metal pipe sound, whether you’re stealthy wrapping it around the back of a blissfully unaware fool’s noggin, or lobbing it directly at their knee caps. In fact - although the game does have a delightful array of classic verbs, along with a few surprises - many of them are simply conducive to a stirring round of fisticuffs, to write my most British sentence of the week.

No tunnels choked with sickly, mushy-pea green gas. No rats feasting on my ankles, occasionally inflicting a disease that halves my health bar. “Christ, they’re sending runners now?” the rifleman asks as I hoof south from Fort Souville after a gruelling trench defence whittles down my resources to a busted fightin’ spade and a handful of pistol bullets.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been fumbling for a grasp on Bokeh&#x27;s skull-splitting horror game Slitterhead since I first heard the words &quot;brought to you by Keiichiro Toyama, former designer of Silent Hill, Siren and Gravity Rush&quot;. Thanks to a new interview, I now have a proper description of the relationship between protagonist and antagonist. Friends, Romans and countrymen: this is a game about a war between two sets of body-stealing monsters, waged in the neon shadows of a fictional East Asian city. It all puts me strongly in mind of a certain John Carpenter movie about squelchy goings-on in Antarctica.

                              <span>When you dive into the mess of folders on your PC, what do you find? Cobweb-plastered manuscripts for those twelve fantasy novels you started? Mouldy design documents for those nine games you never actually began coding? Perhaps dozens of little motheaten thumbnails of that masterpiece you&#x27;re planning to someday paint? Relax, I&#x27;m not calling you out (I have my own groaning cybercabinet of neglect). Rather, I&#x27;m here to say don&#x27;t worry. Everyone does it. Even famous Final Fantasy character designer and Kingdom Hearts director Tetsuya Nomura, who has a “huge number of game proposals lying dormant” in a mish mash of folders on his PC. You&#x27;re just like him!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve tried visual novel games in the past, like A Space For The Unbound and Hatoful Boyfriend. And what&#x27;s frustrating is that I just don&#x27;t get on with them, despite knowing that they can convey brilliant stories through all sorts of interesting cuts and shots and whatnot. I&#x27;m sorry to report that certain stories won&#x27;t grab me if they&#x27;re not ticking along at just the right pace or if they don&#x27;t pull me in straight away. I&#x27;m a needy soul, someone who demands immediacy and a special emotional sauce.
Until Then is, without a doubt, the only visual novel-y game I&#x27;ve truly enjoyed. In fact, I&#x27;d say I&#x27;ve more than enjoyed it - I think it&#x27;s superb so far. The teens that drive this story are written with an authenticity I&#x27;ve not encountered before, and the 3D interwoven with the 2D adds some surprising - besides the literal - depth.

The technical term for this is &quot;lunar pareidolia&quot;, which would have been a good alternative title for To The Stars, a spooky and spry &quot;planet-hopping&quot; strategy game in which the planets pout and grimace at you constantly, like a nestful of horrible baby sparrows.

                              <span>Usually when a game makes me want to stop playing and go outside it’s a bad sign, but with Dungeons of Hinterberg it’s different. It’s an action RPG that made me pine for the outdoors and want to be whisked away from all my responsibilities and just exist for a bit. Each time I would finish playing I’d be thinking about my next getaway, and although dungeon delving wouldn’t be on my holiday itinerary Dungeons of Hinterberg is making me think twice.

Vessel of Hatred ushers in a wave of change for Diablo IV. The game&#x27;s first expansion takes players to the new jungle region of Nahantu and, most importantly, introduces the new Spiritborn class. I visited the Blizzard campus to go hands-on with the Spiritborn and speak to some of the designers about how it created a class unlike any other in the Diablo series. After spending a couple of hours playing, the Spiritborn may already be my new favorite class in the game. 
Unlike other Diablo classes, the Spiritborn is not based o…</span>

                              <span>Splitgate’s combination of Halo-esque first-person shooter with Portal-inspired portal jumping mechanics made it quite the sensation when it launched in open beta in 2021. With its servers regularly buckling under the weight of its players, the game caught lightning in a bottle but petered out when the game finally went 1.0 and simultaneously ceased receiving support in 2022. Now, developer 1047 Games is back with Splitgate 2 and aims to refine the original&#x27;s winning formula. 


Like the first game, Splitgate 2 will be a free-to-play 4v4 shooter that arms players with a portal gun and more traditional firearms to battle each other in aerial, dimension-hopping combat. The sequel is being built in Unreal Engine 5 and has a new emphasis on factions. Players can suit up to compete in the Sol Splitgate League as members of one of three groups: the agile Aeros, the time-manipulating Meridian, or the trigger-happy Sabrask. According to a press release, “Factions will grant players the ability to choose and progress based on their preferred gameplay style or competitive strategies.” Splitgate 2 will feature new objective-based game modes across new arenas and upgradable weapons. 
Additionally, a special Splitgate 2 companion app is available to download now. The app lets players explore the game’s universe through collectibles that unlock in-game rewards when Splitgate 2 launches. It also features quizzes and a new comic series called Splitgate: The Games We Play. The five-issue series will flesh out the backstory of the characters featured in the announcement trailer and additional issues will arrive monthly. 
Splitgate 2 launches in 2025 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Check out the first batch of screenshots below.</span>

                              <span>Russia has just ordered Google&#x27;s CEO to unblock 200 pro-Kremlin YouTube channels. Telecoms regulator Rozcomnadzor said the restrictions &quot;fundamentally violate the key principles of free dissemination of information&quot; and accused Google of censorship within a &quot;Russophobic policy&quot;. In 18 takedown notices sent in a two-week period last month, Rozcomnadzor ordered Google to delete over 5.6 million search engine results for mentioning VPNs.

First up, Wesley LeBlanc shares his initial impressions of Capcom&#x27;s action/strategy/tower-defense hybrid Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess. Marcus Stewart then dishes out his time slaying gods in the action souls-like Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn. Kyle Hilliard unpacks his review of Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition, and we also discuss playing the Concord beta and Zenless Zone Zero before answering some listener questions.

                              <span>Fallout, a TV adaptation of the popular post-apocalyptic video game series, was released on Amazon Prime this past April. Video game adaptations can be a bit of a mixed bag sometimes, but in this case, fans and critics alike (us included) loved its characters, world-building, and its overall take on the Fallout universe. It should come as no surprise, then, that the show has been nominated in numerous categories at the 2024 Emmy Awards.
Fallout was nominated in 16 categories, but two of them are particularly exciting. First, the show is one of eight nominees for Outstanding Drama Series, ranking it among other big shows of 2024, like Shōgun, which currently leads the pack with 25 nominations. Secondly, Walton Goggins was nominated for Outstanding Lead Actor In A Drama Series for his portra…</span>

                              <span>Nintendo is, relatively speaking, a family-oriented company. Their games are aimed at kids, their parents, and everyone in between with bright colors, wholesome storytelling, and extremely approachable game design. That said, there are exceptions to this rule, like in this creepy 15-second teaser uploaded to the company&#x27;s YouTube channel last week. A man in a trench coat wearing a paper bag with a smile drawn on it stares into the camera while a distorted music box plays in the background. The only additional context we got was the hashtag #WhoIsEmio, leaving fans scrambling to figure out what exactly this was hinting at.
Today, that mystery has been cleared up. Emio, also known as &quot;The Smiling Man,&quot; is the star of a new game in the Famicom Detective Club series, which hasn&#x27;t had a new entry in 35 years. The game was revealed today alongside a video featuring series producer Yoshio Sakamoto, who wrote the first two games and went on to direct titles like Super Metroid and Metroid: Zero Mission. According to him, they decided to make this new entry during their time developing the Famicom Detective Club remakes back in 2021.
&quot;In Emio – The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club, a student has been found dead in a chilling fashion, his head covered with a paper bag with an eerie smiling face drawn on it,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;This unsettling visage bears a striking resemblance to a recurring clue in a string of unsolved murders from 18 years ago, as well as Emio (the Smiling Man), a killer of urban legend who is said to grant his victims &#x27;a smile that will last forever.&#x27;&quot; Players will assume the role of a private investigator and set out to solve the case and stop the killer for good.
Emio – The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club will be released for the Nintendo Switch next month, on August 29. Hopefully, the titular killer won&#x27;t murder too many people before then.

NES games are difficult to revisit. They’re easy to find and play, but they are showing their age and have been for some time. To play the original Legend of Zelda, for example, rewards a difficult-to-control, often obtuse puzzle game whose importance to the industry is undeniable, but its contemporary fun factor is low. Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition counters this with a strategy that WarioWare has been using to great effect since its inception: you only play classic Nintendo games for exactly as long as they’re fun – which in 2024 is anywhere from three secon…</span>

After playing a key role in the recent landmark sentences handed down to the operators of a major anime piracy site, CODA is now reporting the arrests of a further 13 people. After its Beijing office filed criminal charges on behalf of Japanese rightsholders, services offering tens of thousands of anime titles were shut down.

                              <span>No Man&#x27;s Sky is getting a big new Worlds update which treats the space sim&#x27;s gazillions of planets to a sumptuous overhaul, using technology devised for stablemate fantasy sim Light No Fire, which only has one planet, albeit a &quot;literally Earth-sized&quot; one with dragons. Catch a deep dive trailer for the Worlds update below.

                              <span>If DICE&#x27;s Battlefield series lacks for one feature, it&#x27;s surely the option to dig trenches. Properly dig them, I mean, not just waft them into existence with a wave of your magic trowel, a la Battlefield V. Think Minecraft, but with howitzers instead of Creepers. I have never been to war, but I do own several shovels, and let me tell you, if I ever hear artillery fire or even just dangerously raised voices round these parts, the first thing I will do is tunnel straight down.
Fuck it, I might do that if I read any negative comments on this news piece. Vex me not with your pestilent talk of &quot;map balancing&quot;. Watch this trailer for Flying Squirrel&#x27;s new FPS Over The Top WW1 instead. It abounds with trench-digging, and it looks like you can make some decent-sized craters, too.

                              <span>Prime Day 2024 has delivered a rather good deal on a rather good budget SSD, but now Amazon’s supersale settles down into its final hours, I think we can afford ourselves a look at something…spicier. Something superlative, in fact, as the Samsung 990 Pro is the single fastest NVMe SSD I’ve ever tested for game load speeds – and it can be yours for 24% off in the UK, or 40% off in the US.

                              <span>Back in 2011, Robot Entertainment released tower defender Orcs Must Die!, adding an exclamation mark to spark some urgency and also, irritate anybody who has to write about video games for a living, though not as much as the absolute maniacs behind Tom Clancy&#x27;s H.A.W.X. Evidently, players did not sufficiently meet their demand for wanton Orc-massacring, for Robot were forced to release two sequels, which I personally would have titled Orcs Must Die!! and Orcs Must Die!!! or perhaps Orcs Must Die!!?, to indicate a mounting existential crisis.
Now, Robot have stepped things up by announcing Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap, a newly roguelite, four-player spin on the goblin-farming formula, whose subheading throws bumbling Orc murderers a bone by specifying that you might try building a trap of some kind, a deathtrap possibly. Please find below a suspiciously innocent trailer, which I promise you isn&#x27;t covering a wall of arrow launchers or similar.

                              <span>I increasingly judge Souls-adjacent games not by the height of their bosses or the depth of their dungeons, but the cleverness of their shortcuts, and Flintlock: Siege Of Dawn has my favourite shortcuts in an age. Rather than just being routes around to the other side of a barred door - though there are plenty such Lordrannish loops to find in this game - they consist of aerial chains of magic, purple triangles that suck you toward them when you hold a button. They lend vigour to a branching, faux-Napoleonic world that might otherwise be a collection of atmospheric strolls between bonfire-equivalents and fights defined by taut resourcing systems. They&#x27;re idiot-proof grappling points from which you can launch yourself at another triangle, a ledgeful of upgrade materials, or a loitering musketeer who is in urgent need of a ground-pound.

Much in the same way that if you fancied a tin of beans, chances are you’d reach for classic Heinz, you just know that the Xbox pad will do the job. Unlike those saucy Haricots, however, I’ve always winced at how pricey the Xbox Wireless Controller is – except today, the last of Prime Day 2024, where UK-based Prime members can pick one up for a far more sensible £40. In one of five colours, too.

                              <span>A few months back I got my hands on an MSI Thin GF63, largely for an overdue look at the RTX 4050 within. Since then, this slimline gaming laptop has elbowed its way into more regular use within the Archer household, particularly when I have portable PC needs that the Steam Deck can’t quite satisfy. Now you too can get one on the cheap, by way of a chunky Prime Day discount – and as if God himself was calling me a loser nerd, it’s the significantly brawnier RTX 4060 model to boot.

                              <span>When Clickolding - a vaguely Inscryption-y sub-hour dread droplet -  opens, you’re sitting on a bed across from a man wearing a mask that looks like someone gave up halfway through carving an Easter Island statue of Joe Camel, stuck a pair of googly eyes on it, then went to cry in the corner at what they’d created.
In your hand is a clicker counter. Moose-face stares. What do those eyes convey? Patience? Intent? Longing? If nothing else, they betray a deep certainty that whatever else happens, you’re going to click. If you stop clicking for a moment, a prompt appears in the corner telling you the controls. At least, I think it&#x27;s a prompt, because it might actually be a threat.
Left click to click. He&#x27;d like you to click 10,000 times, please.

Here is a fresh look at the RADV versus AMDVLK Vulkan performance on Linux with a focus on ray-tracing performance.</span>

                              <span>The apparent complexity of Vietnam&#x27;s legal system has hindered Hollywood&#x27;s  enforcement efforts for years; investigations have been known to move at glacial pace before simply melting away. When three local men were arrested in January for running  illegal streaming sites, few expected a rapid conclusion. Yet after facing trial last week, all three were found guilty of copyright crimes, at a court where a copyright case had never been heard before.

                              <span>The Xbox 360 digital store shuts down later this month on July 26. Amid a wave of price reductions and other end-of-life updates, nostalgic fans can relive the console&#x27;s earliest days via a new dynamic background modeled after the old “Blades” interface.
For those too young to remember or didn’t get an Xbox 360 until years later, the Blades interface was the console&#x27;s first dashboard design. It was the first thing players saw from the console’s launch in 2005 until it was updated to an entirely different interface in 2008. Navigating it felt smooth as butter, and some diehards still believe it&#x27;s the best UI of any Xbox console. 
Although it&#x27;s less detailed, and you can’t flip through the Blades of this dynamic background and hear that satisfying “whoosh” sound, it’s nice to see Microsoft acknowledge the 360&#x27;s like this. Here’s how you to make the Blades your Xbox background:
Press the Xbox button on your controller to open the guide.
Navigate to Profile &amp; system &gt; Settings &gt; General &gt; Personalization &gt; My background &gt; Dynamic backgrounds.
Choose Xbox 360 Blades under Featured or Xbox dynamic backgrounds
Select the background art you want using the A button.

                              <span>Dead by Daylight’s 8th-anniversary stream revealed a few big updates for the popular asymmetrical horror game. The most immediate is the addition of Lara Croft as the game’s latest crossover survivor along with the impending addition of the much-requested 2v8 mode. 
Tomb Raider Chapter
Lara Croft (the 2013 reboot version, specifically) joins DBD today, and though she lacks her pistols and bow, she sports three new perks highlighting her adventuring prowess. Here&#x27;s an explanation of each per DBD&#x27;s website:
Finesse: Your fast vaults are faster when healthy, with a cooldown after a successful use.
Hardened: When you open a Chest and cleanse or bless a Totem, Hardened activates for the duration of the Trial. From that point, every time you scream, you’ll instead reveal the Killer’s Aura.
Specialist: When you open or rummage through a Chest, gain 1 Token (up to 3). When you do a Great Skill Check, consume a Token to reduce the max required Generator progress.


2v8 Mode
On July 25, a new 2v8 multiplayer mode descends into the game. This pits two Killers against eight survivors in expanded versions of five classic maps. The number of generators has been doubled, and Survivors must now repair 8 out of 13 to escape. Captive Survivors are now sent directly into cages, and Survivor perks have been reworked into a new role system designed to encourage teamwork. 


Cross-Progression
Cross-progression is being implemented on July 22. This means players can now sync their progress across multiple owned versions of the game. Everything can be shared across any platform except for Switch, which has a few restrictions as you can see in the chart below. 
Today’s stream also revealed a new trailer and the release date for The Casting of Frank Stone, the single-player DBD game developed by Supermassive Games (Until Dawn, The Quarry). You can read all about that here.</span>

                              <span>The Casting of Frank Stone, Supermassive Games’ single-player narrative-driven horror game set in the Dead by Daylight universe, has a release date. This intriguing horror collaboration will arrive on September 3, and a new trailer provides a proper introduction of the main cast. 
Developed by Supermassive (Until Dawn, The Quarry) and published by Dead by Daylight developer Behaviour Interactive, The Casting of Frank Stone stars five teenagers – Christine Gordon, Jaime Rivera, Linda Castle, Robert Green, and Bonnie Rivera – who film their own horror movie in an abandoned steel mill. Unfortunately, this mill has ties to a notorious murderer named Frank Stone, and the youth’s innocent art project goes horribly wrong.


We still don’t know much about the narrative other than that it is set within the world of Dead by Daylight and takes place in the town of Cedar Mills during the summer of 1980. Gameplay-wise, The Casting of Frank Stone follows a similar blueprint to Supermassive’s previous horror titles in that it’s a choice-driven adventure where characters can be permanently killed off based on your decisions. You can check out a recent gameplay trailer here to see it in action. 
The Casting of Frank Stone is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</span>

                              <span>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 launches in October, but players can get in early via a pair of open betas. Activision is running two of these beta periods during consecutive weekends, and the dates and times for each have been revealed. 
Here is when you can jump into each beta: 
Weekend 1: Early Access (for preorder customers/Xbox Game Pass subscribers) - August 30 at 10 a.m. PT to September 4 at 10 a.m. PT
Weekend 2: Open Beta (for everyone) - September 6 at 10 a.m. PT to September 9 at 10 a.m. PT
Both betas are multiplayer only and will feature several online modes, weapons, equipment, and perks for players to tinker with. 
Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 launches on October 25 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Set in 1991 during the Gulf War, the espionage-themed campaign centers on a mysterious organization&#x27;s infiltration of the U.S. government. The Black Ops agents must go rogue to stop this threat, which takes players across the globe with new faces and returning favorites like Woods and Adler.

                              <span>The word &quot;kiss&quot; occurs 10 times in the latest blog post for the seventh major Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 patch, while the word &quot;bug&quot; occurs 14 times. I think this ratio captures how BG3 updates at large walk the line between dealing with stuff like progression blockers, and sating the inexhaustible horniness of the fanbase. There&#x27;s more to patch 7 than glitch-hunting and snogs, however. Due in September, it introduces dynamic splitscreen functionality, expansions for Honour mode, modding tools, new endings for evil playthroughs, and a brace of tweaks for Origin characters.

                              <span>Graphics cards are always worth looking out for on sale events like Prime Day, largely because they’re so hideously expensive otherwise. Take Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 4060, whose positioning in the RTX 40 series hierarchy would suggest an affordable mid-range GPU, yet routinely pushes £300. Here, though, you can nab the Gigabyte GeForce RTX 4060 Windforce OC edition at a 15% discount, bringing it down to a far more agreeable £238. Nice.

                              <span>Recent SSD prices have made for miserable reading and even worse shopping, with the costs of last year’s manufacturing woes passed onto innocent punters. At least Prime Day 2024 is, if only temporarily, righting those wrongs – such as with the massive 2TB WD Blue SN580 going for a mere £96. Two whole terabytes of quality NVMe for less than a hundred quid? Nature is healing.

                              <span>Apologies for the two handheld-minded deals posts in a row, readers, but I’ve just noticed that the Prime Day 2024 has made the Lenovo Legion Go – a bulky but commendably unique handheld Windows PC – cheaper than it’s ever been in the UK. Provided you’ve got an Amazon Prime account, or at least the free Prime trial, the 512GB model can be yours for £569, a saving of £131. Not bad, for a device with a higher-rez display and more graphical horsepower than the Steam Deck or Steam Deck OLED.

                              <span>Amazon Prime Day is once again bearing the PC hardware fruits, with big discounts on one of the absolute best microSD cards for the Steam Deck (and other handhelds). Specifically, it’s the SanDisk Ultra, and not the diddly 64GB model in the picture above but the honking great 1.5TB version. It&#x27;s dropped below the £100 / $100 mark for the first time and, while Amazon has the lowest overall prices, it’s on sale elsewhere, allowing you to dodge the usual Prime subscription requirement.

It&#x27;s a gentle exploration game from the people who brought you Wimot&#x27;s Warehouse and I Am Dead (including Pip Warr, RPS in peace) where you never touch the ground, instead gliding around the strange forests and rippling meadows atop a giant bird with a beautiful trailing tail. Big Journey vibes, but more whimsical and colourful.

With this in mind, I think the words &quot;Call Of Duty&quot; should represent the endless, unstoppable nature of existence. And with Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6 revealing its multiplayer open beta and early access dates, we must further consume and be consumed by the circular march of COD. Let&#x27;s dolphin dive in, shall we.

                              <span>I know as much about programming video game monsters as I do the exact flavour and consistency of the sands on Mars, but I&#x27;ve always thought the chief advantage of the Slime monster archetype is its economy. A slime, in most games, is a squashy smiley face. Why, I could grow myself one of those right this very instant, by doodling a circle in MS Paint and squinting very hard. Slimes do take more complex forms - chrome slimes, fire slimes, slimes with angry eyebrows, etc - but come now, it&#x27;s not on the same level as rebooting Lara Croft&#x27;s hair to billow in the blowback from grenades.
The simplicity of slime creation may soon become a distant memory, however, for Epic Games tech artist and current Duck Shake Games Asher Zhu is hell-bent on reinventing the homely Dragon Quest sludgeball as a technical tour de force on par with his previous contributions to Unreal Engine showcase Matrix Awakens. That&#x27;s the impression I garner from the below video of Zhu&#x27;s latest project, anyway, whose description also tantalises with talk of &quot;Splatoon mechanics in dungeons&quot;.

                              <span>We do love a good diegetic interface here at the treehouse, whether that’s the analogue radar twisties of HighFleet, or the myriad hefty flickables of PVKK (Planetenverteidigungskanonenkommandant. Duh.) The fifth mech jam is currently happening over at Itch.io, and the clear standout for me thus far is Armored Shell Nightjar. It’s a first person pilot-em-up that puts you in the cockpit of a grasshoppery rust-bucket carrying out a critical mission on an industrial desert planet. The more the intro text stresses the importance of this mission, the more guiltily useless I feel, because I cannot get this beautifully run-down mech to do anything of note, unless you count violently hopping into walls to be notable.

When, in a “few weeks” according to the developer, fishing ponds come to strategy builder Manor Lords, it will take approximately 45 minutes for some enterprising medieval fintech tinkerer to utterly bork the entire economy, and it will be glorious. What will begin as brave new world of lean protein and previously unseen Omega 3 levels will soon devolve into hordes of beleaguered oxen hauling overburdened carts full of rotting fish carcasses, as hyperinflation looms.

The 75GB torrent is apparently fully playable minus a few assets, and also includes server binaries, meaning cool pirates can play with their cool pirate mates.
Sorry, sorry, I’m being told pirates aren’t cool and don’t have any mates. Sorry. Sorry.

                              <span>During my visit to BioWare in its Edmonton, Canada, office earlier this year for the current Game Informer cover story on Dragon Age: The Veilguard, I heard a sentiment repeated throughout the day from the game&#x27;s leads: in past Dragon Age games, BioWare stumbled onto great companions, but with Veilguard, it&#x27;s the first game where the studio feels it purposefully and intentionally created great companions. As such, those companions are key to everything happening in Veilguard. 
With such a significant emphasis on these characters, I spoke to some of the game&#x27;s leads to learn precisely about BioWare&#x27;s philosophy on companions in Veilguard. 


&quot;No, that is the case,&quot; BioWare general manager Gary McKay tells me when I ask if he agrees with the stumbled-onto-greatness sentiment. &quot;I would first …</span>

                              <span>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed, the video game follow-up to last year’s TMNT: Mutant Mayhem animated film, has its first trailer and a release date. The game was first announced last September. 
A Heartful of Games is developing the game, which retains the stylized Spider-Verse-inspired art direction from the hit film. The story unfolds after the movie&#x27;s events and sees Leo, Raph, Donny, and Mikey battling a new wave of mutants invading New York City. 


As previously covered in our exclusive preview earlier this year, Mutant Mayhem is a third-person action/platformer game, and each turtle features a unique playstyle. The game also supports up to two-player local co-op. 
TMNT: Mutants Unleashed launches on October 18 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. The game is also getting a fancy Collector Edition, and you can see the contents of that here. Mutants Unleashed is one of several TMNT games to arrive in recent years (and the third in 2024 alone, following Wrath of the Mutants and the Switch port of Splintered Fate), and you can read all about the franchise’s history in video games in our in-depth retrospective.</span>

                              <span>Mortal Kombat 1’s final Year 1 DLC fighter arrives next week, and it’s Takeda Takahashi. The young Shirai Ryu warrior makes only his second appearance in a Mortal Kombat game and looks every bit as capable as his older clanmates, Scorpion and Smoke. 
Although Takeda was Kenshi’s son in his debut appearance, Mortal Kombat X, the remixed timeline of Mortal Kombt 1 has changed him to Kenshi’s cousin. Like Kenshi, Takeda grew up a Yakuza but was more faithful to the clan than his cousin. As such, the Yakuza tasked Takeda with killing Kenshi, and the two battled, with the latter coming emerging victorious. Takeda was mortally wounded in the battle and rushed to the aid of the Shirai Ryu, where Kenshi protected him from being killed by the Yakuza for failing his mission. This causes Takeda to have a change of heart and join the Shirai Ryu to wage war against Earthrrealm’s criminal underground and, eventually, the evil forces of Outworld. 
Takeda still utilizes the Shirai Ryu fighting style, including his signature pair of bladed whips. He also sports shurikens, a barrage of teleporting flame attacks, and an aerial grapple best described as mid-air corkscrew piledriver. Check Takeda out below.  


Takeda will be available on July 23, both as a standalone purchase and as a free download for Kombat Pack owners. The same day also sees previously revealed Kameo fighter Ferra become available to buy. Both Takeda and Ferra will be playable for the first time during Evo 2025 this weekend.

                              <span>Crocs and Pokémon are teaming up again for another collaboration, this time bringing four classic Generation 1 pocket monsters into the shoe line sometime this year. This news comes by way of Sole Retriever, which reports that Crocs is releasing four new pairs of shoes, each themed after a specific Kanto Pokémon: Charizard, Gengar, Snorlax, and Jigglypuff. 
Though there isn&#x27;t a release date for these Crocs yet – Sole Retriever simply reports 2024 – we know each will cost $70. While each pair has unique theming based on the Pokémon it&#x27;s representing, each pair of Crocs comes with Jibbitz, which are the detachable charms on the tops of the shoes, the classic Pokémon title on back of the shoe strap, and the classic Pokéball logo as the buttons holding each of the straps in place. 
Charizard

Gengar

Snorlax

Jigglypuff

Sole Retriever says these Crocs will be available through Crocs and online and in-store retailers. 
While waiting to learn more, read about an upcoming Nike x Tekken 8 shoe collaboration.

                              <span>So I’ve just hopped on my motorbike, enjoying one of several pleasingly incongruent classical musical tracks that plays from the radio, on my way to tick tasks off a list in the top right corner of my screen by scavenging an abandoned hospital. It’s a great hospital, by the way. Spotlight-headed phantasma shamble about corridors reminiscent of The Division 2 or The Last Of Us’s naturalia.
Striking, but also within easy reach of comparisons. And if Once Human was purely the collection of x from ys it very much appears to be, I’m not sure I’d have much positive to say about it. On the surface, what you&#x27;re getting here is a 6/10 third-person shooter from ten years ago that gleefully spills thumbtacks along any simple paths to progress with live service obfuscation, propped up by a detached crafting and building economy that has you popping mined rocks and chopped wood in the oven then taking out freshly baked shotguns a few minutes later. Its systems run the gamut from numbly enjoyable to being a source of major psychic damage, and even the simple act of replacing your initial tier I rustic baseball cap means navigating several menus, currencies, and resources.

                              <span>Death Game Hotel came out last week - a comically gory game in which players play casino-style card games around a table and raise the stakes by betting their own limbs. It&#x27;s a VR game, which is a break from the norm for White Owls, the studio run by Hidetaka &quot;Swery&quot; Suehiro (then again, what is their &quot;norm&quot;?). It&#x27;s also got a big multiplayer component, with lots of jovial bubble-popping and chicken-squeezing between the comedy blood spurts. And this taste of multiplayer mischief has Swery&#x27;s head percolating. This game won&#x27;t be his last dipped toe in the multiplayer ocean, he told us.
&quot;In the future,&quot; said Swery, &quot;I would like to leverage this experience to challenge myself with something new in the online multiplayer realm (something you probably haven&#x27;t even imagined yet).&quot;

                              <span>If there’s one series that can be relied upon to dole out 80-hour helpings of joy straight into my eager face at regularly scheduled intervals, it’s the RPG brawler stylings of Yakuza/Like A Dragon. One could, I believe, make a convincing argument for Yakuza 0 being - if not the best videogame ever made - then at least the most videogame. While this coming October’s Amazon series won’t be the first live action adaption of Yakuza, I am hopeful its episodic format will give its characters a bit more room to breathe. Or, according to Kiryu actor Ryoma Takeuchi in an interview with IGN, to find the love they’ve always longed for.

Twice.&quot; This is how I like to imagine the designer of Supraworld explaining the hijinks that unfold in his life. Supraworld, the sequel to toybox explorer Supraland, is going to hit early access this year, say developers Supra Games in an update post on Steam. These are happy words for anyone who enjoyed 2019&#x27;s dander among the sandcastles and erasers. A lot of games offer a &quot;sandbox&quot; but in Supraland, the entire world really did take place in exactly that - a sandbox out in a garden, full of toys. The sequel&#x27;s launch into early access &quot;might be in october,&quot; says the post. &quot;We&#x27;ll see.&quot;

Nexon have since reached out to Tassi, saying they’re taking the concerns seriously, and will make adjustments so that the imagery &quot;clearly reflects the unique identity&quot; of their Warframe-Destiny hybrid GaaS shooter.

                              <span>Lots of games use frogs as a means to appeal to those who believe they are cute, me being one of those people. The humble croaker dominates the wholesome category, where they take centre stage in farming sims or as detectives or as green lads who hop over platforms and hurt enemies by lashing them with their tongues.
Schim is different: you play as a frog of the shadows, not some green attention-seeker. And in a mundane world of vibrant colour, you&#x27;re to bounce between patches of shade in search of a human pal whose shadow you&#x27;ve been unwittingly severed from. What ensues is a charming puzzler of both freedom and flow, which genuinely has you view everyday environments through the googly eyes of a phantom amphibian. It&#x27;s a lovely thing, if perhaps not as emotionally charged as it implies early on.

                              <span>Alarmed at what they describe as &quot;psychologically damaging&quot; religious instruction, received by school children from LifeWise, an organization providing off-site teaching in the United States, a group of parents decided to take action. As part of their mission to raise awareness, Parents Against LifeWise recently obtained LifeWise&#x27;s curriculum and published it on the group&#x27;s website. LifeWise responded with a potentially crushing copyright infringement lawsuit.

Something magical has happened! And by magical, I mean that I’ve bollocksed it up. Through a web of devious plots and shocking coincidences too labyrinthine to list here, I’ve gone and messed up my schedule. As such, we don’t have a guest this week.

                              <span>There are a lot of video game awards and most of them are simply popularity contests, and therefore also stinky borefests. The one that isn&#x27;t, in my eyes, is the yearly Independent Games Festival awards - the IGFs.

Announced back in 2021 and initially due to arrive alongside a gamer-focused streaming service called Binge in 2022, the live action series has been scrapped along with the production company behind it.

                              <span>Authorities in Argentina have launched a criminal investigation into a major pirate sports streaming operation. The alleged mastermind, described as a &#x27;pirate streaming consultant&#x27;, was arrested in the province of Mendoza. In addition to the arrest and an accompanying raid, the authorities also ordered ISPs to block more than 50 pirate streaming domains.

                              <span>Concord is in beta this weekend and Alex Van Aken and I decided to jump in, play a few rounds, and figure out which characters we liked from the impressive roster. Together we discovered that Lennox, the hot sauce eating green man seen in the game&#x27;s trailer shouts &quot;exploding knife!&quot; when he throws his exploding knife, but he had nothing on It-Z who had a great SMG, the ability to clone herself when she dodges, and teleportation ability making her easily and indisputably the best character in the game. Alex also liked Duchess. You can check out the archive of the full stream below.

In its fifth major expansion, Dawntrail, Final Fantasy XIV is facing its biggest existential crisis yet: where does your story go now that its 10-year A-plot is over? Dawntrail forges ahead with an enjoyable summer adventure to the land of Tural, doubling as a trojan horse for what lies in store for the future of the long-running MMO’s story. Dawntrail doesn’t match the narrative highs of the previous pair of expansions and is flawed in several ways, but its themes of legacy, the importance of culture, and responsible…</span>

                              <span>Nintendo added three new games to its Game Boy Advance Nintendo Switch Online library, and though none of the them are Mother 3 (or a Pokémon game or Astro Boy or Drill Dozer or any other GBA game we&#x27;ve been clamoring for) they are none-the-less interesting and completely unexpected.
Starfy isn&#x27;t a particularly familiar franchise to America players. They have received four games – three for Game Boy Advance, one for DS – but only the 2009 DS game ever released in America. Today, the original three Game Boy Advance games are now available for Nintendo Switch Online subscribers. The games retain their original title, Densetsu no Stafy, and have not been localized. The gameplay has been describe as Kirby-esque, but I have never been able to confirm that myself until today.


Are you planning on booting up these classic-outside-of-America platformers?</span>

                              <span>Gaming hardware makers have often walked the line between enabling a player’s true skills, and simply delivering them an unfair advantage. Sometimes, honest accessibility aids are falsely accused of being cheating tools; other times, a monitor will straight-up play League of Legends for you. This week, developments in gaming keyboards have sparked a new debate on what does and doesn’t fall within the scope of fair play, with mechanical keeb specialists Wooting declaring in no uncertain terms that &quot;Rappy Snappy is not the same as Snap Tap.&quot; Cool, glad that’s cleared up.

                              <span>In theory I&#x27;m down to review Breachway, a roguelike deck-building space sim which is sort of FTL but 3D and with cards. The second I wrested this privilege from Ed Thorn&#x27;s resentful fingers, however, developers Edgeflow Studio and publishers Hooded Horse delayed the early access release. Perhaps this reflects Hooded Horse&#x27;s atypically forgiving, when-it&#x27;s-ready approach to game publishing. Or perhaps they just hate me and wish to deny me things that might bring me pleasure. It matters not, because the game now has a new early access release date - 30th August 2024 via Steam, GOG, and the Epic Games Store. Catch a celebratory trailer below.

                              <span>From Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart through the original Prey to the obvious touchpoint Portal, gaming hath no greater love than that for an unassuming door which stitches together two places that are notionally far apart.
This rampant enthusiasm for teledoors might seem strange, given that video games are make-believe worlds held together by arbitrary squiggles of magic language. There is fundamentally no reason any video game door should obey the customary laws of spacetime. But don’t let that stop you watching the announcement trailer for Motion Blur’s Black State, a third-person stealth shooter which is heavily redolent of Metal Gear Solid but also, awash with doors that work in mysterious ways.

Following a backlash in the user reviews (the game was Mostly Negative on Steam at launch, but has since risen to Mixed) and on social media, the game&#x27;s developers Starry Studio have published a blog insisting that they harbour no dark intentions for your personal details - or at least, that they harbour intentions no darker than those of the many other developers who collect your personal information.

                              <span>Gotcha Gotcha Games, creators of the RPG Maker series, have announced Action Game Maker. Much like its predecessors, it aims to allow users to create games in its chosen genre without any programming experience, using a “node-based visual scripting system” (draggable arrows and concepts, basically). Could this finally be the opportunity to create the legally distinct Little Shop Of Horrors management sim of my dreams? No, of course not. The technology does not yet exist powerful enough to manifest it. Also, it&#x27;s not an action game. Also, I don&#x27;t know how to make games. Also it&#x27;s Friday and I&#x27;m tired. Also, AGM isn&#x27;t out yet. Still, I’m intrigued!

                              <span>Kain is merchandised. The clans sell tales of him. Few know the truth. He was a character in a dead franchise once, as were we all. However, his contempt for anonymity drove him to inspire the creation of an upcoming (crowdfunding allowing) graphic novel. The book stars Raziel, the first-born of his lieutenants, and It’s a canonical prequel story to the original Soul Reaver. I have waited a millennium. Over time, I became less human and more…games blogger. I have had the chance to write about Legacy Of Kain precisely once. You’re goddamn right I’m going to froth at the mouth at even the vague promise of more Shakespearean monologues and time-travelling vampires.

                              <span>In this week&#x27;s episode of The Game Informer Show, the crew attempts to highlight the best games of 2024 that have launched between January and July. This is not all-encompassing. Rather, it&#x27;s more a conversation about this year&#x27;s early standouts and other releases we plan to visit before our official Game of the Year discussions in December. Before we properly dive in, Marcus breaks down his review of Anger Foot, developer Free Lives&#x27; new first-person shooter. Afterwards, Alex highlights a small desktop game (literally) called Rusty&#x27;s Retirement. We hope you enjoy this episode and find new games to play!

Anger Foot exemplifies a simple idea executed to the nth degree. As a furious sneakerhead possessing seemingly the deadliest legs in the world, you must retrieve your prized collection of stolen footwear by kicking everything in sight. The bombast accompanying this wacky premise – fast-paced, split-second action, satisfying gunplay, and delectable destructibility – turns Anger Foot from a one-kick pony into one of the year’s most exciting, challenging, and tough-to-put-down adrenaline rushes.

                              <span>Planet Coaster 2 arrives later this year and its big update, alongside all the rollercoaster and theme park simulation gameplay of the first title, is the inclusion of water park mechanics. You will be able to create water slides, wave pools, lazy rivers, and more. You will also be able to visit your friend&#x27;s parks and build together in a shared sandbox mode (though you will apparently have to build one at a time) across platforms. You can check out the announcement trailer below.


Frontier is promising its first look at gameplay on July 31, and Planet Coaster 2 will arrive later this year for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. To read Game Informer&#x27;s Planet Coaster review, follow the link.</span>

                              <span>The Double Dragon series has been around since the arcades in 1987 and has managed to maintain a surprisingly consistent release cadence in those more than 35 years. It was only last year that we played Double Dragon Gaiden, a pixelated throwback brawler (or belt-scroll action game, per its official YouTube description) take on the franchise.
This next entry is decidedly more modern, with fully 3D visuals. It&#x27;s not the first time the series has explored this dimension, but it is a rare occurrence. The game is being developed by Yuke&#x27;s, the developer that worked on the WWE 2K franchise until 2K19 and most recently developed AEW: Fight Forever. It is being published, or presented by, as the trailer implies, Arc System Works, the developer behind Guilty Gear and Dragon Ball FighterZ.
Double Dragon Revive is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and One, and PC sometime in 2025.


For a whole lot more on Double Dragon, but maybe not the version of Double Dragon you&#x27;re thinking, head here to read all about the 1994 movie. Back in 2019, I tracked down the film&#x27;s director, James Yukich, to talk about the bizarre film&#x27;s trajectory, what went wrong, and what he would have done differently had he been giving a chance to try making the film again.</span>

                              <span>You ever do that thing on a fairground ride or rollercoaster where you sort of pull your neck and face back in preparation for extreme motion? Welcome to kick-exalting FPS Anger Foot. Violence is brutal and cartoonish. Slight mistakes kill you instantly. The soundtrack slaps. There’s an easy Devolver labelmate orientation point here, but if Hotline Miami was a cocktail of chemical euphoria and gut guilt, like realising you’ve accidentally pocketed someone’s lighter at a festival, Anger Foot is doing whippits out of balloon animals then having a great time rhythmically headbutting a portaloo for a few hours. Similarly, it’s also a bit of a masochistic ordeal to put yourself through. But, man. What a buzz.

Not for me it isn&#x27;t, because now I have to compare my shabby flat, in which there are exactly zero waterslides at the time of publication, with Planet Coaster 2, in which you can expect such aquatic attractions as &quot;meandering lazy rivers&quot;, &quot;adrenaline-pumping wave pools&quot;, &quot;looping flumes&quot; and &quot;exhilarating water coasters&quot;. Please watch the trailer while I yet again revisit the possibility of sneaking into Stoke-On-Trent&#x27;s Waterworld and trying to pass myself off as the resident ghost.

And 2) you&#x27;re in for a treat. Founded in 2019 with the signing of Terra Invicta, and led by Dallas, Texas-based chief executive officer Tim Bender and chief financial officer Snow Rui, Hooded Horse have spent the past five years grabbing up original strategy games and strategy RPGs like a smaller civ quietly steamrolling bandit fiefdoms, while larger empires like Creative Assembly and Paradox Interactive bleed each other white in the centre.

This in itself would be borderline post-worthy, but it&#x27;s also heavily inspired by Game Boy Advance RPGs such as Golden Sun, and features music created by Golden Sun composer Motoi Sakuraba alongside Terranigma composer Masanori Hikichi.

I&#x27;ve only now got hands on a demo shared earlier this year at Tribeca games festival, and I&#x27;m reverberating with pleased energy at the dreamlike atmosphere of this demonic kickflip simulator.

As such, I don’t have enough experience to tell you whether the currently free Pizza Hero is an especially interesting or innovative riff on the formula. However, I am simple-minded enough to enjoy the epic bacon 1.5 humour of a sentient pizza slice with a dog for a companion upgrading itself one topping at a time. This action roguelike reeks of concentrated internet like a week old-slice nestled amidst a stack of free AOL disks. But! It’s cute and fun and free, and that’s enough for me.

Jackson Clayton honoured the proud tradition of getting the 1993 FPS to run on things where no Doom should be by porting classic opening stage E1M1, via level editor Ultimate Doom Builder, into Fortnite’s Unreal editor as a 3D model. Welcome, newcomer Fortnite, to the vaunted halls currently occupied by gut bacteria, jar-grown rat neurons, lawnmowers, teletext, electric toothbrushes, Windows notepad (sort of), and a pregnancy test.

That&#x27;s something I learned firsthand while customizing my Rook within BioWare&#x27;s Edmonton, Canada, office earlier this year during my cover story visit. We were customizing a feminine Rook, and while adjusting body options - read Game Informer’s in-depth feature about Veilguard’s character creator here for more details – our Rook&#x27;s shirt disappeared to let us customize things like chest size. 
And that&#x27;s when Veilguard game director Corrine Busche smiled, likely knowing full well that nudity in the character creator means nudity elsewhere in the game, like in Veilguard&#x27;s romances, something I know BioWare fans will be delighted to hear. &quot;This is a mature RPG,&quot; she tells me.
I only see topless nudity in the character creator, and when I later as…</span>

                              <span>Starting today, Xbox Game Pass will be experiencing some changes which includes redefining of certain tiers. And later this year, there will be a handful of price increases for various tiers. Here&#x27;s the exact text as it is presented on Microsoft&#x27;s website.
Starting July 10, 2024, the following updates to Xbox Game Pass will take effect:
    Price changes will go into effect for new members for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, Xbox Game Pass Core, and PC Game Pass.
    Game Pass for Console will no longer be available for new members.
    Members who are already subscribed to Game Pass for Console and have automatic payment renewal enabled will be able to continue to enjoy their membership.
Also, a new Game Pass option, Xbox Game Pass Standard, will become available in the coming months. These changes will enable us to bring members more value and more great games to Game Pass.
The new Xbox Game Pass Standard tier for new members will be $15 a month and will not include access to Day One releases, EA Play, Game Pass for PC, and cloud gaming.
Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, which includes access to all the bonuses now not included in the Standard tier is increasing its price from $17 a month to $20.
Xbox Game Pass Core, which offers online access and a much smaller library of curated games, is changing its yearly from $60 to $75. The $10 monthly price for that tier, however, will remain unchanged.
PC Game Pass is increasing from $10 per month to $12, but that tier will still include Day One releases.
All of these price changes will be reflected starting on September 12.
Price changes for services you already pay for are always frustrating. What do you think of the change? Do you plan on maintaining your subscription? Or is it time to cancel?</span>

NBA 2K25 will feature three separate cover athletes across four distinct covers, depending on which edition you choose. In addition to revealing the cover art, 2K also provided the first screenshots and high-level details on the upgrades players can expect.
Headlining the cover star lineup is Boston Celtics forward Jayson Tatum. The 26-year-old Tatum is a five-time All-Star, a Gold Medalist at the 2020 Olympic Games, a member of the U.S. Men&#x27;s National Team for the 2024 Olympic Games, and is coming off his first NBA Championship.

                              <span>We haven&#x27;t written nearly enough about Fallout London, a gargantuan Fallout 4 total conversion that takes place in a whole new map based on England&#x27;s capital city - the Big Smoke and/or Great Wen, whose real-life incarnation probably harbours at least one nuke at any given moment, though I haven&#x27;t asked the King about that lately. Best not speculate.
Anyway, Fallout London is a huge effort from modders Team Folon that was recently sabotaged when Bethesda treated Fallout 4 to a next gen update to capitalise on the Amazon TV show&#x27;s popularity, rendering several mods incompatible and breaking a lot of stuff. Team Folon have now fiddled with the workings and sent a Fallout London build to GOG for QA testing, which suggests that release is imminent. The catch, however, is that you will need to downgrade your copy of Fallout 4 to play the mod, because even with Team Folon&#x27;s last-minute adjustments, Fallout 4 next gen and Fallout London simply don&#x27;t get on.

I too yearn to bound through the Star Post portal and into a world where Sonic has to min-max his trainers and do companion quests for Big The Cat. The spinning ball of spines is in your court, Iizuka-san. The people of Mobius are ready. Mario has had that genre all to himself for long enough.

                              <span>Many years ago game designers advised their peers to make their prototypes &quot;juicy&quot;. They were talking about the nebulous collection of sensations a player is exposed to when heads explode, coins jangle, and balls bounce. Zenless Zone Zero is a game deeply informed by the philosophy of juice. Like the lootbox hawkers of yesteryear, gacha designers understand the appeal and power of a pleasingly animated gizmo, ker-chunking open and fizzing with potential. This poppy visual and sonic language stretches across Hoyo&#x27;s latest game, from its cinematic moments, to each character&#x27;s attacks, to the cute bunny mascots that erupt into gatling guns, to the barista&#x27;s coffee-making ritual and the recipes of the robo-limbed noodle server. The menu screens, the maps, the free-to-play storefront, everything. It is all very juicy. It is pumped with juice, but only in the same way supermarket chicken is pumped with water.

That&#x27;s because developer Sucker Punch Production&#x27;s Ghost of Tsushima, which originally launched on PlayStation 4 back in 2020, was the best-selling game of May 2024 in the U.S. And that&#x27;s almost assuredly due to the recent PC release of Ghost of Tsushima Director&#x27;s Cut on May 16. 
Ghost of Tsushima Director&#x27;s Cut hit PC almost four years after the game&#x27;s initial launch on PS4, which speaks to PlayStation&#x27;s PC release strategy it detailed last month. It said its live-service games, like this year&#x27;s Helldivers 2 or the upcoming 5v5 hero shooter Concord, will launch day-and-date on PC, but its tentpole single-player games, like Ghost of Tsushima Directo…</span>

                              <span>Nike and Bandai Namco are teaming up to release a Tekken 8-inspired shoe that will be available for purchase this September. Dubbed &quot;Tekken 8 x Nike Air Foamposite One Fist,&quot; these shoes will be available through Nike, SNKRS, and select retailers in-store and online for $250, as reported by Sole Retriever. 
The shoes themselves are inspired specifically by Tekken 8&#x27;s primary antagonist, Kazuya Mishima, as the colorway of the shoe is basically a spin on his outfit in-game. Sole Retriever describes the shoes as featuring an iridescent Foamposite material across the design&#x27;s upper region in armory navy, with a faux crocodile skin texture across the Foamposite material, and black hues over the leather eyestays, shoe collar, and tongue. 
Check out the Tekken 8 x Nike Air Foamposite One Fist shoes for yourself below: 

As you can see, the shoes also feature the Tekken logos, a Fist logo with Tekken&#x27;s signature lighting, and a nice box to hold the shoes. 
Sole Retriever reports that a second colorway in this lineup is on the way and it will reference Jin Kazama, although there&#x27;s no images of what it will look like yet. 
These Tekken 8 x Nike Air Foamposite One Fist shoes will cost you $250 when they release this September. For more, read Game Informer&#x27;s Tekken 8 review.

                              <span>Piranha Bytes, the developer of series such as Elex, Gothic, and Risen, has been shut down. The studio was owned by Embracer, which had been seeking a buyer for the German developer as part of its ongoing cost-cutting restructuring following failed $2 billion deal with Saudi Arabia-backed Savvy Games Group last year. 
It was reported that Pirahna Bytes was looking for a new publisher following job cuts last year. In January, following a period of radio silence and inactivity from the studio, CEO Micahel Rüve addressed reports of an impending closure by stating the company was in a “difficult situation” while expressing optimism about finding a partner by saying, “Don’t write us off yet!”

                              <span>Dragon Age: The Veilguard is a BioWare RPG, which means a lot of things, including the fact that the game will feature romance. Based on what I learned during a recent trip to BioWare&#x27;s Edmonton office for the current Game Informer cover story, Veilguard will be the team&#x27;s most romantic game yet. 
Relationship Level
Every companion in the game has a Relationship Level related to Rook, and the choices you make (and not even specifically about the companion, but in the world in general), what you say to companions, how you help or don&#x27;t help them, and more all play into it. Every time you rank up a companion&#x27;s Relationship Level, you unlock a skill point to spend specifically on that companion.

                              <span>Developer-publisher GungHo Online Entertainment has revealed Disney Pixel RPG, an upcoming 8-bit adventure starring Mickey Mouse, Winnie the Pooh, Genie from Aladdin, Baymax from Big Hero 6, and many more beloved characters. It launches in Japan on iOS and Android devices this September, and is expected to be released in other regions of the world at a later date. 
According to the game&#x27;s website, Disney Pixel RPG will feature a story about merging worlds, fast-paced strategic battles (with simple controls for mobile and even an auto-play function), customization for your own avatar character, and expeditions that allow you to send pixelated Disney characters out on missions to gather materials and more. Players in Japan can pre-register for Disney Pixel RPG right now ahead of the game&#x27;s September 9 launch – there&#x27;s no word on if other regions will be able to pre-register anytime soon, however. 
&quot;The game world that these Disney characters call home have suddenly been invaded by strange programs, and are starting to break down,&quot; the story description reads on the game&#x27;s website. &quot;These previously isolated game worlds have merged, throwing all the characters into confusion. Take on the role of a player of these games and join Disney characters as you embark on an epic quest across multiple game worlds to restore order.&quot; 
The game&#x27;s listing on Apple&#x27;s App Store notes it will be free-to-play but will feature microtransactions. 
Here&#x27;s a look at the game&#x27;s combat: 
And here&#x27;s a look at the game&#x27;s avatar customization: 
Disney Pixel RPG launches in Japan on iOS and Android on September 9, 2024. There&#x27;s no word on when to expect it in other regions of the world.
