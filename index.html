The game had been due to launch next month on November 17th, but Relic say they need extra time for &quot;bug fixing, balancing, and polishing&quot;. This is all just tweaking time, apparently, as Relic have finished development of the game’s features.

Hadn&#x27;t heard of this,&quot; to &quot;holy video game, Batman, this is the absolute business&quot; in the space of a free demo. This is what I experienced with Flat Eye, a story-heavy management sim where you&#x27;re in charge of a super-advanced gas station, where you harvest personal data from the port-a-loos, and feed the biological matter from those same toilets into your high-tech vending machine. Mmmmm. Flat Eye, the Next Fest demo for which you can download and play right now, is from Night Call devs Monkey Moon. I liked Night Call fine, but I really love the Flat Eye demo.

So we heard that a Mario movie update was on the way, but thanks to a new tweet from Nintendo, they&#x27;re making it a bit more official with a Mario movie Direct.
In tandem with the October New York Comic Con event, we&#x27;ll get our first real look at the &quot;world premiere trailer&quot; for the film, which is still set to debut on April 7, 2023 at 1:05 PM PT (4:05PM ET). Basically all we have to go on still is the cast list, as Nintendo hasn&#x27;t provided a clear look at what the movie&#x27;s aesthetic is (in terms of sight or sound): unless this new potential movie poster is something to go by.
The first impression of this project is crucial. The Mario voice is what everyone is waiting to hear, and after the studio (and Mario&#x27;s performer Chris Pratt) have been hyping it up for months, they need to deliver. If the film is visually anything like this presumed poster, I think people will be happy.
As a note, Nintendo has confirmed that there will be no game information featured during this October 6 Mario movie Direct.

It&#x27;s hardly the world&#x27;s best-kept secret that Electronic Arts is working on a new title for its long-running racing franchise, Need for Speed, but the publisher is yet to officially reveal the road-ripper in question — That looks all set to change very soon, as EA is now teasing an unveiling for later this week.
https://twitter.com/NeedforSpeed/status/1576977802750234625?s&#x3D;20&amp;t&#x3D;1dKOamnyYuNIT8s7j9dcqA
The official Need for Speed Twitter account has been updated with a spanking new &quot;NFS&quot; avatar and header image, which is amusingly splattered with the order &quot;DO NOT IGNORE&quot;. Asked by a fan whether this meant the premiere of the new game was on deck, EA further teased with a shifty eyes emoticon. So let&#x27;s take that as a yes. The new game is developed by Codemasters and is rumored to be titled Need for Speed Unbound.
This Twitter update arrives mere days after Giant Bomb writer and frequent spoiler Jeff Grubb, speaking on Giant Bomb&#x27;s Giant Mess Mornings podcast, suggested that the NFS reveal was set to take place this week. Grubb has been proven to be pretty darn accurate in these matters, so it looks like NFS fans should start revving their engines, and keep their eyes peeled for a new trailer in the very foreseeable future.
We will, of course, bring you all of the wheel-spinning deets right here on Destructoid.

                              <span>These late stage amiibo are great looking
Thanks to a live showing at the Zurich Pop-Con &amp; Game Show this past weekend, we have a look at the real Sephiroth and Kazuya amiibo models for the first time.
Obtained by way of images from Twitter user OctoBoxie (through a conversation with the great amiibo resource Amiibo News), Sepiroth is sporting his signature &quot;winged form&quot; (the term that Smash uses internally), and Kazuya is ready to fight in a battle pose. As you can see from the header image, these look just like the mockups we got months ago from one of the last Super Smash Bros. Ultimate streams. All we have to see now is Pyra/Mythra (which have poses too) and a potential Sora figure.
The photos confirm that these detailed figures line up with the great quality of the new Splatoon 3 amiibo. As a reminder, those were shown at the Comic Con/Made in Asia convention in Brussels, Belgium. Nintendo is really bringing out the big amiibo guns to trade shows this year.
As always, you can check out when those were released here in our master amiibo list, which has been updated since 2014. The following amiibo are confirmed but not yet released:
Splatoon 3 wave (Holiday 2022):
Octoling (Blue)
Inkling (Yellow)
Smallfry
Super Smash Bros. Ultimate Wave 11 (2022-2023):
Sephiroth
Pyra/Mythra
Kazuya
Sora

[Disclaimer: The following report is not only intended as a nostalgic love letter to a game I enjoyed — one that legitimately helped me through the darkest and most self-destructive of years — but, moreso, this is about a devoted player community. However, my thoughts on the behavior of Activision Blizzard, including its continued workplace controversies are well documented in multiple reports here on Destructoid. Overwatch 2 is not in any way &#x27;penance&#x27; for said controversy.]
Early yesterday, October 3, 2022, Blizzard Entertainment&#x27;s juggernaut multiplayer shooter Overwatch finally hit the lights, bringing to an end six years of life, millions of exciting and intense battles, and only one payload ever actually pushed to its destination — This act, of course, was…</span>

We&#x27;re now over six years after the launch of No Man&#x27;s Sky, and yet, the game is more lively than it has ever been. The game has gotten countless updates to both improve quality of life and hugely expand on the game&#x27;s world and content, and there&#x27;s still more coming. To get the scoop on the future of No Man&#x27;s Sky, Eurogamer sat down with public-facing Hello Games developer Sean Murray, who explained the upcoming 4.0 update, as well as the future of where the company is heading next.
The star of the show here is that 4.0 update, which has some big changes headed our way. Going live on Friday, October 7, one of the biggest features of the release with the 4.0 update is that No Man&#x27;s Sky is finally coming to Nintendo Switch. This is pretty exciting stuff f…</span>

                              <span>Geoff&#x27;s Big Bash returns
As we hit October and the nights grow colder, we already begin the countdown to this year&#x27;s GOTY season, as video game fans the world over pick over their favorite titles, to ascertain which games represented the crowning achievements of good tech and good times in 2022. And, of course, it wouldn&#x27;t be the GOTY season without the coming of Geoff Keighley&#x27;s big-ass extreme bash: The Game Awards.
This year, ticket-buying members of the public will be able to purchase entry to the live event. This marks the first time the public is allowed entry to the event, having been understandably being barred from attending since the onset of COVID-19. For the 2022 event, however, we mere peasants will be allowed to rub shoulders with the game industry&#x27;s great and good, (there are some, honestly), to enjoy a few hours of live performances, trophy handouts, and trailer, after trailer, after trailer — no doubt rounded out with a 20-second video from Hideo Kojima.
So, if you fancy heading to Los Angeles for this year&#x27;s event to see Elden Ring win everything, then keep your eyes glued to both Geoff Keighley&#x27;s Twitter, and the Microsoft Theater website. Tickets will go on sale on November 1, though the price for entry is yet to be been announced. Be sure to iron your T-shirt with a tuxedo drawn on it, and don&#x27;t forget to bring your wheelie shoes and invisible dog leash. We&#x27;ll make them sorry that they ever re-opened the doors to the little people.
The Game Awards 2022 will take place December 8 at Microsoft Theater, Los Angeles.

Nintendo has announced a special Nintendo Direct presentation focused on the upcoming Super Mario Bros. Movie from production company Illumination.
The presentation will take place on October 6th at 1:05pm PT / 21:05pm BST / 4:05am AWST and will introduce the world premiere trailer for the film. Nintendo also notes, of course, that no game information will be revealed... obviously.

Zelda&#x27;s great. On that, we can all agree. Fighting monsters! Exploring dungeons! Battling gigantic bosses! ...But Zelda games don&#x27;t usually give Link much freedom when it comes to settling down. Although Breath of the Wild gave you a house for the first time — previously you were always living with family, or squatting in a treehouse — there wasn&#x27;t much you could do with it. Gardening? Fat chance. Furniture? Lol no. And befriending the villagers? Good luck with that, mate.
But Lonesome Village may just offer the Zelda-Animal Crossing fusion that you&#x27;ve always dreamed of. Although there&#x27;s no combat, you&#x27;ll be doing a lot of exploration, finding mysterious ruins, solving puzzles, and uncovering long-lost secrets. When you&#x27;re not out adventuring, you&#x27;ll return home to the titular village and make yourself a life, befriending your neighbours, customising your house, and, of course, working in your garden.

                              <span>A golden opportunity for Link.
Lynels are often considered one of Link&#x27;s most fearsome foes in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. With their huge, hulking figure, alarming speed, and dangerous weapons, we&#x27;ve had many a run-in with these creatures that have often ended in disaster. But someone&#x27;s figured out a wait to clip this beast&#x27;s fur and completely disarm it, turning this foe into nothing more than a big puppy.
Over on Twitter, @zelda_watchan (found via Automaton Media) has shared a clip of them taunting a Lynel who is standing there, motionless, unable to do anything. Automaton Media has translated the tweet as &quot;I was able to take a Lynel’s weapons away and leave it completely helpless. In this state, it won’t attack no matter what you do.&quot; And that&#x27;s exactly what happened, as this video on Twitter demonstrates (warning, the video contains a pretty rude, if artistically-drawn, hand gesture).

Earlier this year, OlliOlli World was released on Switch and we loved it (heck, we even gave it 9/10 in our review). Combine this with our love of physical media and you would think that news of an OlliOlli World physical release would be enough to make our heart do a kickflip; except, the game&#x27;s &#x27;physical&#x27; release is not all that it seems.
Today, Private Division and Roll7 announced that a physical version of the game will be released on October 28th, 2022. Only, this release will not contain a cartridge. Instead, the &#x27;physical copy&#x27; will be an OlliOlli World box which contains a code for the game&#x27;s digital download - note the message in the bottom right corner of the box in the image above.

                              <span>In need of a re-remaster.
When a studio looks to remaster an older title from its repertoire, the absolute minimum expectation is that the new version looks and perhaps plays better than the original, making the most of modern hardware and, where appropriate, integrating new features to align with modern gameplay sensibilities. Granted, the results have often been quite fluctuating; on one side, you’ve got astounding works of art like the Metal Gear Solid HD Collection, which arguably improves on the original games in every conceivable way, but on the other there are examples like Silent Hill HD Collection that undoubtedly serve as reminders of why some games should just be left well alone.
Life is Strange: Arcadia Bay Collection sits somewhere in the middle. It showcases two strong entries from the burgeoning franchise — Life is Strange and Life is Strange: Before the Storm — in their entirety, but its release on Switch does little more than highlight both games’ shortcomings, primarily in terms of presentation and visuals. It’s a collection that’s honestly difficult to recommend if you’ve already experienced Don’t Nod’s creation. If you’re completely new to the franchise, then this is an adequate way to experience two solid narrative-driven games.

Following on from its Kickstarter campaign last year, Pixel Games UK has released the previously-cancelled Dune GBA game — called Frank Herbert’s Dune: Ornithopter Assault — on Steam under a brand new name.
Spotted by @TheSpaceShipper on Twitter (via Time Extension), the newly-titled Elland: The Crystal Wars launched yesterday on Valve&#x27;s distribution service. The game has been retooled slightly to remove references to Frank Herbert&#x27;s novel, but otherwise remains largely intact. Despite covering the Kickstarter last year, it&#x27;s a pretty pleasant surprise to see this once-cancelled game hit digital storefronts.

We Pokémon fans have been frankly spoilt by remakes in the past. From Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen way back in 2004 to the recent Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, if there&#x27;s one thing that we love, it&#x27;s playing the same game again only slightly different looking.
One fan has taken this mission statement and ran with it. Published on their YouTube channel, Pokebro has spent the past two weeks attempting to remake Pokémon Yellow in 3D and the results are seriously impressive.

These elements can be accessed by navigating to the NSO icon on your Switch home screen, then selecting the &#x27;Missions &amp; Rewards&#x27; section. Here, you&#x27;ll find a list of available missions, which are related to (as Nintendo puts it) &quot;things you’re probably already doing with your Nintendo Switch Online membership, like playing online or trying out the library of classic games.&quot;

Pokémon GO and Pikmin Bloom developer Niantic has issued a notice about &quot;in-game currency prices&quot; increasing in select regions around the globe, starting on October 5th.

                              <span>Nintendo has revealed the first look at its upcoming Super Mario Bros. movie. 
Don&#x27;t get too excited just yet – this first look isn&#x27;t a trailer. But it is a new image showcasing our first look at the famed plumber in the Mushroom Kingdom of this movie, which is being made by Minions studio Illumination Entertainment. This image accompanies the announcement of a Nintendo Direct happening this Thursday, October 6, all about the movie. Nintendo specifically points out that there will be no video game news, however, so don&#x27;t expect anything more than Super Mario Bros. 
Tune in at 1:05 p.m. PT on 10/6 for a #NintendoDirect: The Super Mario Bros. Movie presentation introducing the world premiere trailer for the upcoming film (no game information will be featured).

Here&#x27;s a better look at it, too, courtesy of the film&#x27;s first poster:
As you can see, this image reveals quite a lot. There&#x27;s Toad, an antiques stall selling relics of Mario&#x27;s past video games, plenty of pipes and platforms, and of course, Princess Peach&#x27;s castle high above the rest of the kingdom. There&#x27;s probably plenty more to glean from the image so have at it. 
This image is our first look at the movie, but during the Direct on Thursday, which begins at 1:05 p.m. Pacific/4:05 p.m. Eastern, Nintendo will formally introduce the movie with the first-ever world premiere trailer, so be sure to tune in. 
Super Mario Bros. hits theaters on April 7, 2023.
While waiting for this Thursday direct, read about how Nintendo is reportedly happy with the film and so happy, that additional Nintendo movies are likely on the way. Read about how Chris Pratt says his Mario voice is &quot;unlike anything you&#x27;ve heard in the Mario world&quot;.

                              <span>Sony might be interested in helping produce movies and television shows based on From Software games. 
This news comes by way of a new interview between Reuters and PlayStation Studios head Hermen Hulst, in which Hulst explains PlayStation&#x27;s investments into its PC and mobile efforts as of late, as well as its recent investment into Elden Ring developer From Software. According to Hulst, &quot;further investments in areas that will strengthen the expansion on to PC, on to mobile, and into live services&quot; is definitely a possibility for PlayStation. 


However, more interesting to From Software fans perhaps is Hulst&#x27;s answer when asked about Sony&#x27;s investment in the studio. 
&quot;You should think of collaborations on the game development side first and foremost, but it&#x27;s also not unthinkable with our PlayStation Productions efforts that we explore opportunities,&quot; he said. 
While Sony has a 14.09% stake in From Software, that&#x27;s not quite enough to make decisions independent of the studio&#x27;s other investors, like Tencent, which acquired 16.25% of From Software around the same time Sony invested. So while PlayStation Productions might be interested in a Bloodborne horror movie one day or an Elden Ring TV series about Jar Bairn, for example, From Software and its other investors would likely need to give the green light as well. Here&#x27;s hoping, though, because From Software&#x27;s properties, be it Bloodborne, Elden Ring, Dark Souls, or something else, seem ripe for an on-screen adaptation. 
While waiting to see if anything comes of this, read about how Bloober Team is making a TV series adaptation and then read about how Sony is developing God of War, Gran Turismo, and Horizon screen adaptations after that.

                              <span>Bloober Team has announced that its 2021 psychological horror game, The Medium, is getting a TV adaptation. 
The studio announced this in a new blog post today, as translated by Bloody Disgusting, which reveals Tomasz Bagiński, an executive producer for Netflix&#x27;s Witcher series, and Bloober Team&#x27;s own Piotr Babieno will oversee the show. 
&quot;Both the film industry and the video game industry are close to my heart, and I am very happy that there is finally an opportunity to bring them both together,&quot; Babieno writes in the blog post, according to Bloody Disgusting. &quot;The story we told in the game was appreciated by players, and now more people will be able to hear about it. The latest hits of streaming platforms based on games such as Cyberpunk: Edgerunners or Arcane have shown that this is the perfect time for such productions.&quot; 
As noted in Babieno&#x27;s writing above, The Medium will join a slew of recent video game adaptations that have found great success, like Cyberpunk: Edgerunners (Cyberpunk 2077) and Arcane (League of Legends), and others still in development, like Sony&#x27;s God of War, Horizon, and Gran Turismo productions.

                              <span>Last week I shared some initial numbers how surprisingly when disabling Zen 4 CPU security mitigations can actually *hurt* the Ryzen 7000 series CPU performance. While conventional wisdom and with past Intel/AMD processors yield better performance when disabling the CPU security mitigations, with the Ryzen 9 7950X it was found to be basically the opposite.

                              <span>Dead Space fans will finally get a new look at gameplay for the upcoming remake of the first game. The game’s official Twitter account announced that we’ll see this footage tomorrow at 8 a.m. Pacific/11 a.m. Eastern on the game’s YouTube channel. 
Trailer tomorrow. Tune in at 8am PT for the first official look at #DeadSpace gameplay.

This premiere is being dubbed as the &quot;first official” look at gameplay. That distinction likely means that the footage will be of a near-complete build of the game since developer Motive Studios has spent the last year releasing several behind-the-scenes videos showcasing gameplay in more unfinished forms. This transparent approach to Dead Space’s development has given fans raw looks at how the 2008 classic is being updated. Player feedback from these videos has even allowed Motive to make subtle but important changes earlier in the pipeline. With the game only a few months away, we&#x27;re curious to see how all of that work has coalesced. 
Dead Space launches on January 27 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</span>

                              <span>A remake or remaster of 2017&#x27;s Horizon Zero Dawn is reportedly in the works alongside a new Horizon multiplayer game. 
This news comes by way of MP1st, which reports that its sources tell the publication that this remake/remaster will feature an improved lighting system, overhauled textures, better animations, and character models more in line with those of Horizon Forbidden West, Zero Dawn&#x27;s sequel that released back in February. However, MP1ST notes that its sources didn&#x27;t say whether this was a &quot;built from the ground up&quot; remake or a remaster – it might fall somewhere in between for all we know. 


According to MP1st, one of the project&#x27;s big focuses (ha) is bringing Forbidden West&#x27;s accessibility features over to Zero Dawn, something Sony did with The Last of Us Part II and Part I. As f…</span>

                              <span>The WD SN550 is going cheap at Ebuyer&#x27;s Ebay UK page right now, with a 2TB drive costing just £118.98. That&#x27;s an awesome deal for what is already one of the best value PCIe 3.0 SSDs, offering sequential read speeds up to 2600MB/s and sequential write speeds up to 1800MB/s. That&#x27;s about five times faster than even the fastest SATA drive in terms of peak read speeds, making this an excellent choice for handling large files such as 4K videos, disc images and so on. 
To get this reduced price, you&#x27;ll need to use the code SPEND15 at Ebay. This knocks £21 off the price, moving it from £140 to £119.

You can view the whole of October&#x27;s Steam Next Fest right here if you&#x27;d rather just dive in headfirst, but below you&#x27;ll find some hand-picked highlights we&#x27;ve been enjoying ahead of time - including a new Return Of The Obra Dinn-alike, a first-person skeleton shooter, an underwater citybuilders and a platformer where your gun is also an umbrella.

                              <span>A couple of weeks back you may remember that I played the early access build of Gloomwood, a very good Thief-like that currently snaps shut just as you reach the best bit. The Richard Gere holding a necklace of video games. One thing that I do not dwell on in my feature, though, is that I was hamstrung not just by the early access limitations of the game. For almost all of the first playthrough I did, I thought that you could neither heal nor store items in Gloomwood. I was like &quot;Wow, this is a really hardcore stealth sim.&quot;
You can, of course, do both of those things in Gloomwood. It&#x27;s just, I am an idiot.

If you don’t enjoy the sound of a satirical co-op beat ‘em up set in the vampiric realm of Nosgoth then you might want to chime in with your thoughts.

I can pretend, against incontrovertible evidence, that I am able to function in human society. However, a standard child’s imagination is magnitudes more powerful than my own. A child can believe that a dollar store knock-off Transformer is anywhere near as sexy as the real thing. They can also convince themselves that Mega Man on DOS is equatable to the NES version.

                              <span>&quot;Get your first look at Dead Space gameplay&quot;
A Dead Space remake trailer is coming on Tuesday October 4 at 11AM ET, and it&#x27;ll be our first actual look at what the re-release has in store for us.
The news comes by way of the game&#x27;s official Twitter account, which simply notes the date and time, as well as a brief text teaser. Here&#x27;s all the info we have at the moment, as well as a reiterated release date confirmation:
&quot;Get your first look at Dead Space gameplay and prepare to uncover the mystery aboard the USG Ishimura when the game launches on January 27, 2023.&quot;

As you may recall, we got an &quot;early look&quot; at the Dead Space remake roughly a year ago, but this one promises the &quot;first official look at gameplay.&quot; This will likely include some nuanced nods to the &quot;Dead Space 2 inspired zero-G movement,&quot; as well as the updated dismemberment system.
Since more and more publishers have gotten into the remaster/remake game, the space is decidedly crowded, but the reaction to Dead Space 2023 has been mostly positive so far. They even confirmed a lack of microtransactions a year ago! Smart move. It also helps that this particular game was widely liked at launch, and is from 2008: which feels like legitimate remake territory.
Remaking a popular series like this also lends itself to continued side projects of re-releases; in this case, leading into Dead Space 2 and Dead Space 3. If they can improve some things with the third entry the second time around (ha, video games in 2022 in a nutshell), they could have a big winner with re-selling this trilogy.

Publisher Nacon has announced that WRC Generations has been hit with a last-minute delay, and will no longer meet its October 13 release date — the Kylotonn-developed racer will now launch November 3 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms. A Nintendo Switch port is still in development for later release.
Speaking on Twitter, Nacon notes that it has decided to bring the console release in line with the PC launch date in order to allow for some further polish time for the PlayStation and Xbox editions by the development team at Kylotonn. Console players can pre-order WRC Generations now to receive a bonus vehicle — the Peugeot 206 WRC model. While PC players cannot pre-order the game, this bonus DLC will be offered to everybody who purchases WRC Generations on PC within its first two weeks of release.

WRC Generations promises to deliver the most content ever featured in a rally game. In addition to hosting over 750km of racetrack from no less than 22 countries, the new sequel will include 49 teams from the official WRC 2022 season, as well as 37 legendary cars and 165 timed special stages. WRC Generations will also feature hybrid cars for the very first time, bringing with them their own unique racing strategies — based on the battery management of the somewhat greener mud-rippers.

                              <span>But who will play Abobo?
River City Girls 2 director Bannon Rudis sent me a cryptic message on Friday. &quot;There is a play in Japan. I have no info on this.&quot;
That&#x27;s the kind of mystery I live for, so I got to researching, and eventually found out that a theater company called Solid Star (Heaven Eleven, Yu x You) is putting on a River City Girls play based on the original game. It&#x27;s set to be performed live from December 7th to 11th, 2022. That&#x27;s quite the limited run! And the cast is massive, maybe larger than that of the original game. Is that even possible? Bannon tells me that neither he nor River City Girls 2 writer Adam Tierney have anything to do with this production, so like Willie Scott once sang, &quot;Anything Goes.&quot;
I&#x27;d love to see Bannon and Adam go to Japan to review this official(?) River City Girls play, but I&#x27;m not sure who&#x27;ll pay to make that happen. Maybe Solid Star will? Even better would be if they shelled out some extra dough to cast my old Road Rules Northern Trail friend Bob Sapp as Abobo. Bob also hit me up just last Friday, for the first time in 25 years, to see how I was doing. Having Bannon and Bob come at me on the same day feels like more than a coincidence.
Solid Star, if you&#x27;re reading this, I will personally pay for Bob&#x27;s airfare and lodging if that&#x27;s what it takes to see him hit the stage in your show. Abobo was the role he was born to play.

For those of you currently grinding it out in Shin Megami Tensei spin-off Soul Hackers 2, Atlus is currently preparing a new update that hopes to make your hour-chomping journey through the demon-filled dungeons a more streamlined and faster-paced experience.
The new update, which will drop on all platforms in November, will feature a variety of gameplay and U.I. tweaks, all seemingly designed to remove the hurdles between you, the monsters, and endless nights of level-grinding action. The November update will add a &quot;Dash&quot; function to our dungeon-running heroes, and will also offer a &quot;high-speed&quot; option to the game&#x27;s many, many, many demonic encounters.

In regards to Soul Hackers 2&#x27;s U.I. and menu system, several small tweaks have been made to expedite the process and get you back to soul &#x27;ackin in double quick time. Players will now teleport to the shop interior when selecting the shop from the in-game map, while the tip transitions on loading screens have been stripped down to increase load times. Some menu elements will also be rearranged to prevent you over-eager button mashers from accidentally clicking the wrong option.
In addition to the above changes, four more demons will be added to the big book of baddies. These are the fiery Aitvaras, the priestess Isis, comical warrior Neko Shotgun, and finally, the iconic cutie-pie, Pixie (Devil Summoner variant). While a specific launch date is yet to be announced, fans can expect this update to hit next month.
Soul Hackers 2 is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

Sony&#x27;s new generation of PlayStation VR is due to roll out in 2023. And from the sounds of a new report, the PS VR2 will be moving quite a few units out.
According to Bloomberg, Sony plans to make 2 million units of the PS VR2 headset by March 2023.
Bloomberg&#x27;s sources say mass production of the new VR headset began in September, and it hasn&#x27;t dealt with any supply chain constraints yet. Those figures could be adjusted, the report notes, depending on how the device sells upon its release.
A spokesperson for Sony Interactive Entertainment declined to comment on the report to Bloomberg.

                              <span>He needs no introduction
It&#x27;s hard to believe that Fire Emblem Engage is already coming in January, but Nintendo seems dead set on that soonish release date: and is steadily showing off more of the game (albeit on the official Fire Emblem Japanese Twitter account). Amid the sprinkling of gameplay (more so than the trailer) we&#x27;ve gotten so far, the latest set of clips includes gameplay of a series star. New Fire Emblem Engage Marth footage is out thanks to the series&#x27; Twitter account, and gives us a better look at the hero in action.
Here is the full introduction/mini character bio from the inaugural tweet (translated/cleaned up), which also reveals his Japanese voice actor:
&quot;Marth (CV: Hikaru Midorikawa) is commonly known as &#x27;The Beginning Heraldry&#x27;, and is a noble and charismatic hero among heroes. He is the prince of the Altea Kingdom, located in the alien continent of Archanea,&quot;

We get to see how guest characters seem to appear in Engage, and Marth is reconfirmed as a sword user in this entry. There will also be some story elements involved with the summoned heroes, including the below conversation with the main character.
If Engage pulls this off, and manages to bring in some of the most celebrated characters in this series&#x27; lengthy history, it could lead to some explosive moments. Ideally the team actually manages to make these portions sing: and elevates them over a fanservice-like inclusion.

Several key members of ZA/UM, the studio behind the esoteric and critically acclaimed RPG Disco Elysium, have announced that they have left the studio and will not be committing further work toward the award-winning game&#x27;s upcoming sequel.
In a candid post on Medium, titled &quot;The Dissolution of the ZA/UM Cultural Association&quot;, Disco Elysium editor Martin Luiga succinctly noted that writer and designer Robert Kurvitz, co-writer Helen Hindpere, and lead artist Aleksander Rostov were all no longer at ZA/UM. The post notes that the trio left the company in an &quot;involuntary&quot; fashion. Rostov later confirmed the departure on their own Twitter. Luiga notes that this motion could cause a delay in the sequel&#x27;s release, subtly pointing at studio investors as potenti…</span>

If there’s one thing I love more than Castlevania, it’s the fantasy that someone can find me interesting enough to extend our companionship beyond the boundaries of a five-minute conversation about the weather. Ah, yes, that’s the good stuff. Now, what if you took Castlevania and mashed it up with my delusions of tolerability? You’d get Romancelvania, which sounds like a pun that is trying too hard until you realize it’s a play on the word Transylvania and not Castlevania. Video games have warped my perspective on puns, apparently.
However, the way of executing this sort of composition eluded me when I heard the pitch. I could think of a few ways to approach it, and each sounded rather precarious. I’m happy someone is making the attempt, even though I’m ske…</span>

                              <span>It also asks you to choose between Kain or Raziel
A new Crystal Dynamics-helmed Legacy of Kain survey has popped up, and could inform the future of the franchise based on its results.
Although it was a fairly short run looking back on it, the series tore onto the gaming scene in 1996, exploded in 1999 with Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver, and then effectively ended unceremoniously in 2003 with Defiance. Since then the powers that be attempted to resurrect the series in multiplayer form, but it also died off in its own way. But with Crystal Dynamics bought and paid for and part of the Embracer Group now, it&#x27;s likely time to start tapping into nostalgia.
As a reminder, here are the five major Legacy of Kain games that the survey centers on:
Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain (1996)
Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver (1999)
Soul Reaver 2 (2001)
Blood Omen 2 (2002)
Legacy of Kain: Defiance (2003)
Question topics for the Legacy of Kain survey include:
Have you ever seen someone stream a Legacy of Kain game?
How would you rate each game you&#x27;ve played in the series?
What are your favorite parts about the series (mechanically and thematically)?
Who is your favorite protagonist (Kain or Raziel)?
What would your reaction to a new &quot;vampire game&quot; be?
Do you want to see a sequel, remake, reboot, or remaster?
Do you want a theoretical game to be single or multiplayer (co-op is also an option)?
Beyond that, one of the most important questions drills down whether or not you&#x27;d rather see a remaster/remake of any of the five core games first. For what it&#x27;s worth, my top pick is probably a Soul Reaver remake. There are so many different directions you can go, but if I had to choose one possible outcome, that would likely yield one of the best-received/commercially successful single titles.
[Thanks Jeff!]

                              <span>Steps of Glory
The mighty Malenia, Blade of Miquella has fallen to a dedicated Elden Ring player once again — And while this is a meaty enough task and something of an achievement in itself, extra glory belongs to streamer and cosplay model MissMikkaa for striding into battle armed with... a dance mat.
Yes, you read that correctly, MissMikka, with a level one player character no less, toppled the iconic guardian of The Lands Between with the aid of a flimsy plastic mat and some jet-black volleyball socks. This incredible feat is the latest hurdle MissMikka has surmounted in her endeavor to battle their way through the FromSoft RPG with all manner of control-based disadvantages. (Previously, MissMikkaa had won plaudits for completing Elden Ring while playing with just one hand).
https://twitter.com/MissMikkaa/status/1576608756187549701?s&#x3D;20&amp;t&#x3D;56BFRDUEJbyE1QwIRuBRDQ
Of course, this was hardly a spontaneous, lazy afternoon affair, with MissMikkaa racking up a total of 553 attempts, which totals somewhere in the region of 15 hours of playtime, all spent just battling this one single boss character. Like so many of these unbelievable self-set streamer challenges, it has taken dedication, patience, practice, and knees that won&#x27;t fall off at a moment&#x27;s notice, (like mine), in order for MissMikkaa to step up to the plate. Literally. When you add into the mix that they were also hosting a stream and speaking to the viewers while the battle raged on — That&#x27;s some multitasking.
Kudos to The Lands Between Dance Mat Champion... Now maybe go and give your ankles a rest.
Elden Ring is available now on PlayStation and PC.

The first includes Doc Brown&#x27;s futuristic metal sunglasses from Back to the Future 2, titled the &quot;Lo-Vis Visor.&quot; Next up we have Marty McFly&#x27;s future hat (also from Back to the Future 2), called the &quot;Bream-Brim Cap.&quot; Another spotted reference includes the &quot;Brain Strainer&quot; in-game item, which is likely a reference to Ghostbuster&#x27;s 2 Keymaster Helmet.
Funnily enough, Back to the Future 2 takes place in the glorious year of 2015: when everything was supposed to be future-ized. While the full Splatoon timeline isn&#x27;t clear, it does play around with the idea of the fate of the future.

Sharpen your scythes, brighten your blades, and paint your toenails, as Arc System Works has announced a date for its crossplay open beta for stylish slapfest Guilty Gear Strive — The beta will take place on PlayStation and PC platforms, worldwide, on the weekend of October 14 to October 17.
During this time, players on PS4, PS5, and PC will be able to duke it out amongst themselves, will ArcSys gathers data, stress-tests servers, and attempts to identify and eradicate issues that arise from putting all GG Strive players into a single pool. This beta will give the developer all of the information it needs to progress its plans to roll out crossplay to Guilty Gear Strive proper at some point in the foreseeable future.

The beta will run within its own client, separate from the main GG Strive build, which will be available to download from October 13, ahead of the server&#x27;s opening times. The beta will be open to all, regardless as to whether you own Guilty Gear Strive or have a PlayStation Plus account. A full roster of 21 characters will be available, as will a wide variety of modes including Tutorial, Practice, Survival, various Online and CPU Vs. options, and even the very fun diorama builder, Figure Mode. No player data from the beta will be carried over into your main GG Strive account, so you wanna get nuts? Let&#x27;s get nuts!
Guilty Gear Strive is available now on PlayStation and PC platforms. It will launch on Xbox platforms in spring 2023. In related news, rollback netcode is coming to series&#x27; predecessor Guilty Gear Xrd Rev 2.

                              <span>Guerrilla Tactics
A strange, yet unsurprising, sprang forth to the information superhighway this weekend, with several sources reporting that Sony Interactive Entertainment is in the process of creating a PS5 remaster of Guerrilla Games&#x27; epic 2017 release, Horizon Zero Dawn.
First reported by MP1ST, with various industry pundits and websites supposedly corroborating the news, the remaster will be an updated and upgraded take on the anachronistic sci-fi adventure, which saw hunter and tribeswoman Aloy venture out into a lush land of dangerous machinery on a quest of reflection and self-growth. Originally launching on PS4, the smash seller would eventually make the leap to PC in 2020.
While details are understandably slim — even unproven — on the supposed remaster, one can likely expect improved load times, upgraded textures, improved accessibility options, and slicker visual effects, perhaps bringing the title more in line with its utterly stunning sequel, Horizon Forbidden West. We can likely look to similar PS5 remasters, such as The Last of Us and Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man, for examples of some of the improvements SIE will be striving for in this new release.
In addition to the remaster, the MP1ST report also claims that Guerrilla Games is currently working on a multiplayer side-title set within the Horizon universe. The alleged project is currently in the early stages of development for PS5 and PC, and will see a conflict between the world&#x27;s various tribes, with gameplay defined by some form of PvP or co-op multiplayer element. Given the success of the Horizon titles to date, it figures that SIE would be looking to capitalize on the series&#x27; growth via numerous projects.
The gaming industry will not rest until we are all playing the exact same four games ad infinitum.

If you&#x27;re a Paper Mario fan, then there&#x27;s one key thing that you probably share with all other Paper Mario fans: Disappointment.
Unfortunately for all of us who love the antics of Intelligent Systems&#x27; two-dimensional plumber, the Paper Mario series has been slowly declining in quality, taking the things we loved about the early games (turn-based combat! Witty writing! Incredible characters!) and turning them into things that... just aren&#x27;t as good. Endless parades of faceless Toads, combat that relies too heavily on a gimmick that doesn&#x27;t quite work, and writing that never quite reaches the heights of Paper Marios of old... this is what we&#x27;ve had to endure for a while (although, admittedly, Origami King was pretty good).

Devolver Digital&#x27;s Inscryption is apparently heading for Switch after appearing on rating firm PEGI&#x27;s website. The roguelike deck-building indie darling from developer Daniel Mullins found its way onto many a GOTY 2021 list with its PC release last October, and it seems we&#x27;ll soon be enjoying its unique strangeness on Nintendo&#x27;s console.
As pointed out by redoubtable pointer-outer-of-things Wario64, the game has appeared listed with an (inaccurate) 1st October 2022 release date, sitting just under the PS4 and PS5 versions which launched back in August.

                              <span>NieR-ly perfect.
NieR:Automata is perhaps a story of the power of word of mouth. A sequel in an IP with a devoted but modest following by Square Enix standards, it became a notable sales success over time as initial fans convinced neutrals that something special had arrived. Director Yoko Taro was also clever in his approach to storytelling - playing its predecessor(s) or the recently released remaster, NieR Replicant, gives you extra context and lore, but this entry is also self-contained and gives players all of the information they need. What we have, then, is a wonderful slice of sci-fi storytelling wrapped in an accomplished action adventure RPG. It&#x27;s quite unlike anything else, and now we get to enjoy it on Switch with the content- complete The End of YoRHa Edition.
A topic that often comes up in gaming, particularly in the retail / triple-A space, is the challenge of blending creative vision with slick, attractive experiences. Publisher Square Enix made a savvy decision, as it partnered the incredibly creative Taro-san with PlatinumGames, the latter being fans of the original NieR and very much on board to apply a flair for action and combat gaming. The blend is intoxicating, and also helped to establish the reputation of Platinum&#x27;s Takahisa Taura, who worked on design here before making his directing debut with Astral Chain; it&#x27;s fascinating playing Automata now, as there are whispers of ideas here that are played out more fully in 2019&#x27;s Switch exclusive.

If you&#x27;ve spent a good amount of time with the N64 classic The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time and its sequel The Legend of Zelda: Majora&#x27;s Mask, you may have become quite familiar with the visuals of each games and which assets were brought over from one title to the other.
The keen-eyed among you may even notice some small differences, too. One of these happens to be the texture of the deku stick, a key item in both games that can be used to give enemies a good whack while also acting as a pretty handy makeshift torch. Apparently, the slight difference in the stick&#x27;s appearance between both games wasn&#x27;t by design, but rather a bug that was left during development. This comes via Twitter user &#x27;darkeye&#x27; who discusses the curiosity in a thread (click through to view all posts):

We are but a few short days away from No Man&#x27;s Sky&#x27;s inaugural flight to Switch on October 7th and we are buckling in to see how this massive game plays on Nintendo&#x27;s comparatively tiny console.
In order to put some of our fears to rest, we recently got the chance to sit down with the game&#x27;s creator, Sean Murray, and talk about all things No Man&#x27;s Sky. The conversation ranged from the difficulties of the Switch port to which Nintendo character Murray would most like to add into the game - make sure to check out our full interview to read all of Murray&#x27;s insights.

There are just a few days until No Man&#x27;s Sky makes the journey onto Switch on October 7th.
Anyone who has played or has even been remotely interested in No Many&#x27;s Sky over the past six years will most likely have heard of Sean Murray. The founder of development studio Hello Games and creator of No Man&#x27;s Sky&#x27;s ever-expanding universe, Murray&#x27;s name sits above the game&#x27;s official Twitter account - a fitting reminder that he is one of the lead brains behind the intricate operation.

We are but a few short days away from the Switch release of No Man&#x27;s Sky on October 7th and it is fair to say that we have been nervous to see how this frankly massive game would run on Nintendo&#x27;s little console.
Following a huge update to the game as we currently find it out in the wild, it seemed unlikely that the Switch would be able to handle the large amount of interstellar content required to keep No Man&#x27;s Sky the experience that people have come to love since it launched back in August 2016. When we discovered that it would be coming to Switch, our curiosity about the project&#x27;s scope and the inevitable compromises to get it running on Nintendo&#x27;s hardware grew further.

After the release of promising but all too easy Transformers: Battlegrounds back in 2020, we have been wondering where those robots in disguise have disappeared to (presumably an industrial estate parking lot just off the M4). However, two years on, Battlegrounds&#x27; publisher Outright Games has announced that the engines are running on a new Transformers title to be released in 2023.
Developed by Tessera Studios (the team behind Star Trek Prodigy: Supernova) Outright is keeping schtum on the finer details at the moment, though it has said that the game will be based on the upcoming animated series, TRANSFORMERS: EARTHSPARK, which premiers in November.

                              <span>Včera Linus Torvalds vydal jádro 6.0. Jak jsem již psali, Linus mění číslování ne kvůli velkým změnám, ale protože jej velká čísla matou. Mezi novinky patří podpora diskrétních grafických karet Intel Arc A750 a A770. Tyto karty očekáváme již příští týden ve středu. Ovladač je pouze experimentální, vyžaduje experimentální knihovnu Mesa a parametr  force_probe.</span>

Hlasování podnítil Steve McIntyre, který také vysvětloval svou motivaci a také to, jak a proč sám hlasoval. Celkem se hlasování zúčastnilo 366 vývojářů a vyhrála varianta číslo pět: upravit Společenskou smlouvu Debianu a nabídnout jeden instalátor.</span>

                              <span>The RIAA has booked a landmark victory against YouTube-ripper Yout.com. The Connecticut District Court dismissed Yout&#x27;s request to declare the service as non-infringing. In a detailed ruling, Judge Stefan Underhill concludes that the service failed to show that it doesn&#x27;t circumvent YouTube&#x27;s technological protection measures. Yout is disappointed and will appeal the verdict.

Good morning, my beauties, and welcome to this week&#x27;s edition of Whatcha Been Playing? I hope that you have a warm drink to hand this cold fall morning, and I thank you for taking time out from your weekend to check in with us. It&#x27;s getting colder out there for sure. Wish I was there to warm you up.
For now, however, it is the weekend, and I hope that yours is filled with happiness, joy, good food, good friends, and video games. And if you are working, then I hope you have a smooth shift, and are able to make the most of the time which you do have to yourself — perhaps later this evening, or tomorrow. Either way, treat yourself this weekend, whenever you are able to, and be kind to yourself, always.

                              <span>Squish or be squished in this shrunken backyard survival game from Obsidian Entertainment
After two years in Early Access, it&#x27;s time to check back in with Grounded now that it&#x27;s been fleshed out with more bugs to battle and harvest, more impossibly large backyard sights to seek out, and a fully realized story — complete with an eventual ending — to uncover.
Having only dabbled in the early build, back when there were hardly any threads to follow, I&#x27;m surprised how far Grounded has come thanks to ongoing updates and a big final push for the 1.0 launch on PC and Xbox. Originally, the familiar yet creative-up-close shrunken world was its biggest asset — and it still is to this day. But now, the whole survival loop feels cohesive, with plenty of thoughtful touches you&#x27;d expect from a passion p…</span>

This weekend, I had the good fortune to sit down with Capcom&#x27;s upcoming scrapper Street Fighter 6 for the second time in as many months. Having already spent some solid time with the flashy fighter at the VSFighting tournament just six weeks ago, FGC punching bag Chris Moyse was given the opportunity to spend a solid few hours at a brand new build — showcased at premier UK trade show EGX.
And this time was special. This time, there was 100% more Juri...

                              <span>It&#x27;s a waiting game
Anyone who&#x27;s been into games for more than like a day knows how long the wait can be for our favorite titles to release. Game delays are a dime a dozen these days, but for some fans, the wait is so long, you start to wonder if you&#x27;ll ever get to see the Promised Land. While the development cycle can be anywhere from a year or two to six or seven years at most, there are some games out there that we&#x27;ve been waiting much, much longer for. One of those games is Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2, a long-awaited sequel to Ubisoft&#x27;s beloved classic. It&#x27;s been so long since the game was initially teased at Ubidays 2008, in fact, that the title is considered the longest-awaited AAA game of all time.
The previous record-holder in this regard was Duke Nukem Forever — players had to wait over 14 years from its announcement in 1997 to its release in 2011 (or 5,156 days, to be exact). We&#x27;ve now been waiting 5,236 days for Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 as of the writing of this post, and it doesn&#x27;t look like we&#x27;ll be getting any updates any time soon.
Ubisoft did release a full trailer for the game at E3 back in 2017 that looked pretty good, but I guess it would have been a pretty bad omen if it didn&#x27;t considering they had supposedly been working on it for nine years at that point.

Some Reddit users have pointed out that we wait so long for some games that they become something of an urban legend. Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 certainly fits the bill there, along with Half-Life 3 and whatever project Ken Levine is supposedly working on.
Part of me wants to respect whatever difficulties are likely going on behind the scenes to draw development out this much, but another part of me is so beyond curious to hear about any development drama. Oh well, if it&#x27;s anything interesting, Jason Schreier will probably write a book about it eventually.

                              <span>Rowing Blazers, a New York-based clothing brand, has announced a new line of Sonic the Hedgehog apparel. The collection draws inspiration from Sonic&#x27;s aesthetic from the 1990s, with graphics inspired by art from the time. 
Those who are interested in the collection can look forward to clothing items like a cotton sweater with Sonic&#x27;s image, a zip-up polar fleece, heavyweight rugby jerseys, a French terry loopback hoodie, cotton tees, and mesh shorts. The line also includes baseball caps, canvas tote bags, a necktie, and a hand-embroidered Sonic patch for blazers and other clothing items.
You can see a gallery of some of the items in the collection below.

According to Jack Carlson, founder and creative director of Rowing Blazers, which has done collaborations with FILA, Umbro, the NBA, and more, the company&#x27;s creations all hold important links to his personal life.
&quot;A lot of it has to do with the things I loved growing up: the sports, the brands, the culture,&quot; he said in a press release. &quot;I grew up in the &#x27;90s playing Sonic the Hedgehog on the Sega Genesis. Sonic has always been such an interesting character to me. In the original games, he was a little bit brash, a little bit punk. He was different from other cartoon and video game protagonists. He was very &#x27;90s. Of course, there have been a lot of Sonic clothing capsules created over the years. I wanted to do something elevated, really beautifully made, and kind of timeless in its aesthetic. Of course, there&#x27;s a kind of irony to it because Sonic himself isn&#x27;t really very preppy, but that&#x27;s the fun of it.&quot;
The collection retails as low as $38 to $325, though nothing is currently listed at the higher end of that spectrum just yet. The collection is live now, having launched yesterday. If you&#x27;d like to check out the collection for yourself, you can head here.</span>

                              <span>Get a taste of the lore in store for Dragon Age 4
The team behind Dragon Age: Dreadwolf is giving fans a taste of the lore awaiting them in the new RPG. The writing team has shared a handful of codex entries from Dreadwolf, as part of a community update on the next Dragon Age.
In a BioWare blog post, the team behind Dreadwolf runs down the basics. As it says, stories and characters are at the core of BioWare games. Each person has their own motivations, and each entry has its own hero, molded by player decisions.
Creating a world that&#x27;s interesting to role-play in, then, is pretty important. And that&#x27;s what today&#x27;s codex entries tease out. Dreadwolf will set out for the Tevinter Imperium, an old and powerful region ruled by a host of mages.

NieR: Automata was first released in 2017, just close enough to the Switch launch date that it could have helped define the console&#x27;s larger identity. It&#x27;s definitely a &quot;Style over Horsepower&quot; game, and did little to tax the hardware of the now last-gen PS4. It&#x27;s also developed by PlatinumGames, who&#x27;ve done a lot to build their audience on Nintendo consoles in recent years. Between The Wonderful 101, the full Bayonetta franchise, and Astral Chain, the Switch is where the bulk of their character action games live now. That&#x27;s another reason why it&#x27;s felt a little weird to see NieR: Automata on every major platform but Switch for all these years, but then again, weird has always been Nier&#x27;s thing.
Now the game is finally headed to Switch on October 4, 2022, and I&#x27;…</span>

While the company itself has a piracy history, today it&#x27;s one of the most protective copyright holders in the industry. With a sweeping court injunction, it hoped to take Daftsex.com and several related services offline. However, the court slammed the brakes on the request, at least for now.

                              <span>Petrol stations might not be the most natural setting for pondering life&#x27;s biggest questions, but the ones in Flat Eye, the next game from the makers of detective taxi-me-do Night Call, aren&#x27;t your ordinary rest stops. As well as a convenient place to relieve yourself and top up on snacks, these futuristic service stations also house cosmetic surgery bots, operation tables, teleportation booths and more - and they&#x27;re all overseen by a powerful AI trying to find the best possible future for the human race. As the station&#x27;s head clerk, you&#x27;ll debate the ethics of eternal youth and end of life care, while also making sure your station has enough power, stocked shelves and a happy customer base. It&#x27;s certainly an intriguing combo compared to other management games out there right now, so I sat down with director Laurent Victorino and writer Antony Jauneaud to find out more.

                              <span>Developers working on games for Stadia have expressed surprise and frustration that Google still haven&#x27;t made contact with them, almost 24 hours after the search giant announced they were shutting down their cloud gaming service yesterday afternoon. Many of the devs I spoke with have had no communication from Google at all since the announcement, with only one saying the company had been in touch. It&#x27;s not just devs who have been left in the dark, though. Through a leaked internal email sent to Google’s Stadia team, even Google&#x27;s own staff weren’t briefed until around the same time the public were made aware of the forthcoming shutdown.

                              <span>Sometimes, you look forward to a game&#x27;s release and it&#x27;s very disappointing. Sometimes, it comes out and it&#x27;s... fine. Kinda good, even. Only once does the game come out and it&#x27;s fuckin’ SPIDERHECK WOOOO!
Imagine Nidhogg, cross it with Webbed, give it solid single player options, and throw in one of the sickest game soundtracks I&#x27;ve ever heard. I&#x27;d hoped Spiderheck would merely be as fun as it looks. It instead consumed me. Neverjam have united my love for Webbed with my love for chaos, and it&#x27;s more glorious than I dared to hope.

                              <span>Out now in early access, Slime Rancher 2 is the highly anticipated sequel to Monomi Park’s charming farming sim. Beatrix LeBeau has packed up her slime-wrangling gear and has crossed the Slime Sear to Rainbow Island, a new land packed with new mysteries and new slimes.
As a seasoned slime wrangler myself, I was excited to dive head-first into this new, colourful world. Review code didn&#x27;t arrive until launch day unfortunately, but all week I&#x27;ve been vibrating with anticipation. After spending a handful of hours frolicking with slimes and skipping around Rainbow Island, though, that early dazzle is starting to wear off. Monomi Park’s sequel feels a little too familiar to its predecessor in its early game, and it&#x27;s put a major downer on my goo-hoovering adventures.

                              <span>December’s a month known for its white-haired, bearded men in weird outfits and hats, so it seems a fitting time of year for Slitherine Games to launch their remake of 4X strategy classic Master Of Magic. Slitherine are referring to their take on Master Of Magic as a re-imagining rather than a remake or reboot, saying they’ve tried to be “faithful to the original in spirit and mood”. You’ll be able to Gandalf it up from December 13th.

                              <span>Out Of Hands is a fairly &quot;does what it says on the tin&quot; title for this, a game where you play a dude who dreams he is made entirely out of hands every night. It also operates as a decent joke, because rather than being out of hands, he, if anything, has too many. So full marks for the name. The game itself is kind of a deckbuilder but not really, and though it also describes itself as a thriller, I can&#x27;t say my heart rate was raised. In fact, behind the (admittedly very cool) visual style there seems to be a pretty run-of-the-mill &quot;a girl I liked is no longer in my life and I&#x27;m pretty cut up about that&quot; story. I guess in the full game it might turn out she was murdered, or she mudered the main character, or the main character murdered her - just, some kind of murder, maybe?
But in the four demo levels I played recently, it seemed like a pretty normal breakup. I was really excited to give it a go, but in the preview I didn&#x27;t find the contrast between a face made of squirming hands and the well trodden women-be-leavin&#x27; plot to be particularly affective or evocative. The squirming hands are cool, though.

                              <span>At this year&#x27;s Gamescom I got hands-on with Bytten Studio&#x27;s Cassette Beasts, an upcoming monster-taming open world RPG in the vein of Pokémon, which is far more interesting to me than the basic concept of Pokémon. That&#x27;s because you&#x27;re able to fuse together any monsters you &#x27;catch&#x27;, but moreso because it&#x27;s a monster collectathon where you become the monster, essentially fusing yourself with bomb dogs and hermit crabs with traffic cone-homes.
I like the way the game does away with the overdone shonen story of wanting to become the very best there ever was, and instead puts the spotlight on its cast of characters and the relationships you form with your buds. It&#x27;s looking mighty promising.

                              <span>If you&#x27;ve ever wondered what the 1987 film Running Man might look like as a turn-based tactics game (see also last year&#x27;s Netflix sensation Squid Game, if the Running Man reference doesn&#x27;t quite do it for you), then Homicidal All-Stars probably comes pretty close. It&#x27;s the debut game from Artificer, a new studio formed by a bunch of ex-CreativeForge devs who worked on the first Hard West and Phantom Doctrine, and it centres on a woman called Scarlett who finds herself competing in the deadly TV show that gives the game its name. Like Running Man, Squid Game and all those other &#x27;deadly games&#x27; you know and love, Homicidal All-Stars is about folks who down on their luck fighting for their lives, where their only consolation prize in these dystopian bloodbaths is not getting pulped at the end of it. 
For Scarlett, this means mowing down scumbags in classic turn-based fashion with a bunch of other friendly competitors she&#x27;s teamed up with, but this is far from a straightforward XCOM-like. Between fights, you&#x27;ll also be navigating its trap-filled arenas in third-person, dodging sniper turrets, disabling tripwires, and dashing over spiky/fiery/horrible pits to get to the end of each &#x27;episode&#x27;. It&#x27;s a refreshing mix based on an early preview build I&#x27;ve been playing recently, especially when its gameshow hook allows for its malicious host, Orion Ford, to start meddling with your success. &quot;He’s the person behind the worst of the twists,&quot; creative director and Artificer CEO Kacper Szymczak tells me. &quot;He’ll start filling the level with poisonous gas, he’ll turn off the lights, drop explosive barrels everywhere, to name just a few.&quot;

                              <span>Massively multiplayer games rapidly calcified around a specific set of design ideas (eg. World Of Warcraft) and so many other attempts to jam a load of players onto a single server quickly disappeared (eg. most games by Improbable or Amazon). 

Foxhole is one of the few to do it successfully: a single, massive World War 2 battlefield in which players don&#x27;t just fight at the frontlines, but form supply routes, build defenses, and otherwise take the reigns of the logistics of war. After five years in early access, Foxhole released version 1.0 today.

                              <span>Vampire Survivors will hit version 1.0 on October 20th. Developer poncle announced the release date today as planned, but didn&#x27;t say what new features the full release would contain so that its additions remain a surprise.

Although reaching 1.0 means leaving early access, it&#x27;s also not the end of Vampire Survivors development. Work on porting the game to a new engine continues with the aim to &quot;release it by the end of the year.&quot;

If the answer is &quot;yes&quot;, or even &quot;possibly, why?&quot;, then you might find Retro Gadgets handy when it launches on PC towards the end of the year. It’s a gadget creation station that lets you “invent, build, solder, code and customise” your own electronics. That’s according to Bologna-based devs Evil Licorice, who count amongst them Kingdom co-creator Marco Bancale. Check out the trailer below, and try not to burn yourself with any soldering irons.

A blog post from the developers shares how they’re reworking the game’s setting of the USG Ishimura, along with bringing protagonist Isaac Clarke into line with Dead Spaces 2 and 3. They’re also finding time to flesh out the story with extra side quests.

I&#x27;d literally just woken up and rubbed the sleep out of my eyes, only to emotionally destabilise my morning with an eight-minute-long video in which one of, if not the greatest tennis player of all time poured out his heart. Even his great rival Rafael Nadal couldn&#x27;t hold back his tears, which said it all, really.

                              <span>Sci-fi miniatures sim Moonbreaker launches into early access on PC today, but Brandon Sanderson, the renowned fantasy writer behind the game&#x27;s story, says he&#x27;s working on at least ten years&#x27; worth of story ideas. Brandon Sanderson is known for his prolific ability to churn out books, but he’s also a fan of games and has been working closely with Moonbreaker’s devs Unknown Worlds to map out where the game’s story will go.

Having spent much of my early thirties skulking around the Barbican, I really enjoyed this variety of Brutalist experiences. And the monstermurder. The monstermurder&#x27;s fun, too.

There’s been no other official confirmation yet of the game’s release date for PC, or what storefronts it’ll be available from.

The second I began Shovel Knight Dig, it felt like returning home. As someone who hadn’t played most of Shovel Knight’s post-launch DLC, the last time I touched this series was nearly a decade ago. Gaining control of the titular character immediately felt familiar, and my old Shovel Knight habits returned to greet this new take on the series, led by developer Nitrome this time. The moment-to-moment experience plays excellently, in part because it’s more Shovel Knight with some well-designed gameplay twists. However, the game’s venture into roguelite territory feels i…</span>

                              <span>Google has revealed that its cloud-streaming games service, Stadia, will shut down early next year. 
More specifically, Stadia will close down its platform and end its online servers on January 18, 2023. After that, you won&#x27;t be able to access the Stadia service in any way. As for your games and hardware, Google is offering refunds &quot;for all Stadia hardware purchases (Stadia controllers, Founders Edition, Premiere Edition, and Play and Watch with Google TV packages) through the Stadia store,&quot; according to an FAQ posted by Google today. It seems like the only aspect of Stadia that won&#x27;t be refunded are Stadia Pro subscriptions. However, you &quot;will be able to continue playing your games in Pro without further charges until the final wind down date.&quot; 
If you are hoping to get a refund for your hardware, Google says &quot;most hardware purchases...made directly from Google&quot; will not require you to return your hardware. The company intends to have the majority of refunds processed by Stadia&#x27;s January 18 shutdown date. 
The Stadia Store and all its functions have been turned off so you will not be able to make any more Stadia-related purchases or in-game transactions. 
Stadia shutting down isn&#x27;t the most surprising news. Despite cloud gaming&#x27;s continuing rise in popularity as of late thanks to the likes of Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox Cloud Gaming initiative and others, Stadia never seemed to really take off. The first big sign that Stadia might not be long for this world came back in February of last year, when Google revealed it was ending its first-party game development and closing two studios. Then, this February, word got out that Google Stadia had reportedly been deprioritized by the company. Now, Stadia has just a few months left in it before it becomes a part of history. So long, Stadia.

                              <span>Publisher Kepler Interactive and developer Ebb Software have revealed that Scorn&#x27;s release date has changed, moving up one week earlier in October. The game will now release on October 14 instead of the previously announced October 21. 
As for why, the team doesn&#x27;t say. However, a new teaser trailer released today is titled, &quot;You&#x27;ve waited long enough,&quot; so perhaps the studio simply wants to get this game into players&#x27; hands sooner. Check it out for yourself below: 


Here are some screenshots from the game:

This PCIe 4.0 SSD offers sequential reads up to 7000MB/s and sequential writes up to 6000MB/s, making it one of the very fastest drives available, and today it&#x27;s also one of the cheapest. That&#x27;s because CCL have discounted the drive to £94.27, some £75 below its UK RRP and a terrific deal for a drive with these high-end specs.

The Amazon Prime Early Access Sale is taking place this October 11th-12th, a full six weeks before Black Friday 2022, and from a PC gaming standpoint will offer the same kinds of component and peripheral deals as that annual pre-Christmas shoppingfest. Just earlier.
That said, the Prime Early Access Sale isn’t purely a prelude to the anything-goes chaos of Black Friday. It’s more like a Prime Day 2, in that it’s an Amazon-only event, with all the best deals set to be require Amazon Prime membership to access. That’s right, it’s one of those.

Twitter user Laisul shared a recording of what they claimed are lines from an unreleased Joker pack, and they do sound like Hamill’s classic rendition of the Batman villain. Why so serious? Well, announcer packs replace the default MultiVersus announcer with the voice of one of the game’s fighters, so Joker’s addition to the roster seems legit.

In hindsight, it&#x27;s a bit of an interesting year for Time Capsuling purposes, as we&#x27;re now getting to the point where games from this era are getting their own remakes and remasters, or fancier, super duper director&#x27;s cut special editions. We&#x27;ve included the original 2011 release of one of these games in this month&#x27;s Time Capsule, but there&#x27;s another notable exception we&#x27;ve decided to save for further down the line. I mean, seriously, would you really recommend vanilla Skyrim from 2011 over 2016&#x27;s Special Edition?

                              <span>There&#x27;s a definition of &quot;pure&quot; that&#x27;s proscriptive; a dogmatic adherence to surface details and strict rituals. I&#x27;m genuinely not thinking of any specific game, but many &#x27;retro&#x27; inspired games fall into this way of thinking, and many more fans cut a good one down because of it.
Itorah, however, feels pure in the sense of capturing the essence, the heart of a good retro platformer, not just going through the motions to technically qualify for an arbitrary category. Aeons ago, it would have ported comfortably to your GameBoys and gramophones, and probably look just as pretty and feel just as good in motion, judging by the talented art direction on show here.

                              <span>It’s usually nice to see older games get updates, particularly when we’re not expecting it. Think of it as a good jump scare. Supermassive Games have given their first two The Dark Pictures Anthology some extra care and attention today, dropping in new difficulty settings and accessibility options, tweaked UI, and even faster walking for characters. There’s also an extended chapter for Man Of Medan. I didn’t think update trailers were a thing but there’s one for this, which you can watch below.

Overwatch VP Jon Spector discussed brand crossovers during an interview with Game Informer, saying that Blizzard is “interested in exploring” partnerships like those you might see in Fortnite. Although, he did qualify that it would have to be in keeping with the Overwatch franchise.

                              <span>It&#x27;s tough making a story where you establish early on that your main character will still be alive at the end. In The Excavation Of Hob&#x27;s Barrow, a point and click, small town, folk horror adventure game, the events are narrated by the main character Thomasina, writing in the future, and the game walks a slightly different line. Rather than successfully making you believe a character you know survives is in peril, all the way through The Excavation Of Hob&#x27;s Barrow you are aware that Thomasina in the future is alive but, somehow, definitely not okay. And you believe you can save her anyway.
This looming dread, growing increasingly loom as the game goes on, is one of the most effective weapons in Hob&#x27;s Barrows&#x27; arsenal of horror. Thomasina, a barrow-digger and proto-feminist trouser-wearer in a time when trousers were worn by men, is a practical and mostly cheerful woman. She approaches all the puzzles she has to solve in the robust, roll-your-sleeves up manner of an old-timey governess who doesn&#x27;t care if you hate learning French verbs. The Thomasina of the future voiceover, however, sounds blank, drained and sad. It&#x27;s a contrast that weighs more and more heavy as you slice into the horrible heart of Hob&#x27;s Barrow, and it underscores how great it is to play the game in its fully voiced form.
As well as the voice acting, Hob&#x27;s Barrow has an appropriately creepsome soundtrack, making fabulous use of the juddering bass tones that put all humans and related monkeys automatically on edge, and isn&#x27;t a stranger to unsettling lighting. Evil in this game is a sick purple. Most of all, some praise should be especially given to the several horrible close-ups that pop up: Thomasina&#x27;s eyes, wide in shock, a malevolent cat as he crawls onto your bed; round eyes over a slack, downturned mouth with little peg teeth in it. Devs Cloak And Dagger Games can coax extraordinary depth and motion from their pixel-art and then use that to repulse you.

                              <span>Skull and Bones has been delayed again, this time to March of next year. 
It was originally due out in 2018 but then delayed to 2019. It was delayed to at least March 2020 after that, but things went quiet and the game missed that window. Then, in May of last year, Ubisoft announced that Skull and Bones would release sometime between April 1, 2022, and March 31, 2023. And now, it&#x27;s slipping out of its November 8 release date, which was only just announced back in July, into a new March 9, 2023 date. As for why, the team cites a need for more polish and balancing.
Kotaku&#x27;s Ethan Gach says sources say the teams working on Skull and Bones are burnt out. According to Gach in his Kotaku story, the latest technical test for the game ended on September 19. One source involved with the test told Kotaku that gameplay was more refined than in previous tests but that progression needed work as it still felt too shallow. Gach writes that this is a concern shared by multiple sources close to the game&#x27;s development. 
Here&#x27;s what Ubisoft has to say about the delay: 
The last the public saw of Skull and Bones in a big way was during a July showcase, which is where we saw extensive gameplay and received the now-delayed November 8 release date. I learned a lot more about the game around the same time when Skull and Bones was Game Informer&#x27;s cover story. At the time, the team seemed confident in its November release date but given the history of this title, I&#x27;m not surprised it&#x27;s been delayed again.

                              <span>Electronic Arts and Koei Tecmo have revealed Wild Hearts, a new Monster Hunter-like game coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC next year. 
More specifically, this EA Originals title will be released on February 17, 2023. This news comes by way of the game&#x27;s reveal trailer released today. In it, we see a lot of monster hunting action. The game seems to take place in a mythological land filled with large and dangerous beasts. You&#x27;ll need to craft better gear to take on tougher monsters, eventually taming the otherwise wild area. 
Check out the reveal trailer below: 


As you can see, Wild Hearts looks great, especially if you&#x27;re someone who&#x27;s a fan of Capcom&#x27;s long-running Monster Hunter series.

&quot;I&#x27;m Guybrush Threepwood, mighty pirate!&quot;
Between the moment Guybrush uttered this iconic line in Return to Monkey Island and our reintroduction to familiar characters like used ship salesman Stan S. Stanman and Cobb, with his &quot;Ask me about Loom&quot; badge, I was already shrouded in a haze of nostalgia. And you would be eating all these up, too, if you&#x27;re a Monkey Island fan. The thing about Monkey Island enthusiasts is that we can talk your ears off about what makes the series so unique. It&#x27;s the earnest naivety of its pirate hero Guybrush Threepwood and the serie…</span>

This news comes from a new Overwatch 2 blog post, as reported by Destructoid. In it, Blizzard says a consistent piece of feedback it has received is that new players feel overwhelmed by Overwatch&#x27;s hero pool and various modes. As such, the team has implemented a new First Time User Experience, or FTUE, designed for Overwatch 2 players who have never played Overwatch. 
The new FTUE addresses that feedback directly. In phase one, players will need to unlock the game&#x27;s modes and chat functions – this happens &quot;rapidly,&quot; Blizzard writes in the blog post. Then, in phase two, players will unlock the original Overwatch heroes by playing &quot;approximately 100 matches,&quot; a…</span>

                              <span>There are Pokémon designs like Charizard that make me go, &quot;ooo yes, very nice&quot; and there are others like Voltorb that make me go, &quot;oh, why do you exist?&quot; There&#x27;s also a rare third class of Pokémon I call &quot;weird lil things&quot; when I see them and Wiglett, a new Pokémon joining the Pokédex in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, is that class&#x27; newest member. 
Today, Nintendo and The Pokémon Company released a 3 and a half minute video highlighting Wiglett, its similarities to Diglett, and how it&#x27;s just different enough that it is an entirely new species, rather than a regional variant. As such, this new Diglett-like Pokémon is called Wiglett. It looks like a worm, lives in the sea and on the beach, and seems to stick together with other Wigletts. Check it out in Serebii&#x27;s video below: 


I&#x27;m most excited to see Wiglett&#x27;s evolution, if it evolves at all. But hopefully, I&#x27;ll see that in another trainer&#x27;s party because I&#x27;m not sure Wiglett is a sure bet for mine. 
For more about Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, watch the latest trailer that shows off new school rivalries, gym leaders, and more, and then watch this trailer all about competitive play in the 9th generation of Pokémon. After that, read our preview of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet to find out everything you need to know about the Paldea region. 
Is Wiglett going to be in your party? Let us know what you think of it in the comments below!</span>

Its new trailer shows players grappling and ziplining between buildings, and those buildings being destroyed chunk by chunk.

                              <span>Overwatch 2 differs from its predecessor by being free-to-play, which means it will be more vulnerable to players who are up to no good. Blizzard today outlined how they intend to prevent &quot;disruptive behaviour&quot; from players, including the use of SMS verification and machine learning. More awkwardly, game modes will be locked for first-time players, and Overwatch 1&#x27;s original heroes will only be unlocked &quot;over the course of approximately 100 matches.&quot;

The Altar Of Hope update is already live in the game’s experimental branch and is coming to the main game when devs Red Hook are satisfied with its stability. You can catch a glimpse of the bounty hunter in the teaser below.

                              <span>I had hoped to bring you a proper review of Moonscars today, the new 2D Soulslike from indie studio Black Mermaid. But alas, both time and its ferociously difficult combat have got the better of me, so you&#x27;ll have to settle for some impressions instead. This isn’t simply a case of drinking the &#x27;git gud&#x27; kool-aid either. While I&#x27;ll hold my hands up now and say that Soulslikes have always been a bit of a challenge for me, I feel like I&#x27;ve been making some pretty good in-roads into the genre lately, and after falling in love with Moonscars&#x27; reveal trailer earlier in the year during the Humble Games Showcase, I really, really, really wanted to like this one. Sadly, it&#x27;s become increasingly clear that Moonscars does not like me very much, and maybe even hates my guts a bit - which is ironic, considering how many organs I&#x27;ve chucked at its feet over the last week and a bit to appease its hungry dread moon.

You can now pop in whatever music you want to listen to, not just metal. What genre did devs The Outsiders choose to show off this new feature? Lucifer’s very own favourite, jazz, of course. Brace yourself for some syncopated shenanigans before you watch the trailer below.

                              <span>There’s nothing inherently wrong with the AMD Radeon RX 6650 XT&#x27;s concept – faster clock speeds than the RX 6600 XT, to better compete with Nvidia’s RTX cards? Yeah why not – but surely its timing is questionable. Any GPU launching several months into 2022 would only ever do so under the looming shadows of Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 40 series and the AMD Radeon RX 7000 series, the latter being officially revealed in just a few days’ time. Not to mention Intel Arc Alchemist, delayed as it has been.


Still. AMD’s next-gen, RDNA 3-based GPUs are an unknown quantity, and the RTX 40 series will at first focus on high-end models like the RTX 4090. Even if its RDNA 2 architecture is on the way out, could the RX 6650 XT not find room in the pack as one of the best graphics cards for 1080p and 1440p?

                              <span>As players of Image &amp; Form&#x27;s excellent SteamWorld Dig games will know, there is something innately calming about chiselling your way through a hunk of rock. In both of those western-themed platformers, you were hunting for gem-like treasures to take back to the surface so you could get bigger and better equipment to begin the dig cycle anew. Now imagine that surface is constantly under threat from waves of alien attacks and that&#x27;s pretty much Dome Keeper in a nutshell, a moreish, meditative mining game that sees you balance digging for resources and hunting for all-important relics while defending your eponymous dome from being smashed to smithereens.

                              <span>Genshin Impact fans in the UK take note, because the fantasy action RPG’s mascot Paimon is heading to London this Sunday in massive, inflatable form. The character will be floating down the River Thames, and HoYoVerse are staging an opportunity to get up close at Tower Bridge. Oh, and they’ve chosen the date of the extremely busy London Marathon as the start of Paimon’s journey along the Thames. What a time to be alive.

                              <span>The RPS squad has once again made the trek to London for EGX 2022. There was plenty to see at this year’s show and, as always, we ran some of our own booths. The first was the Steam Deck Zone filled with thirty of Valve’s handhelds full of games for anyone to pull up a chair and play. The second was a showcase of weird and wonderful controllers including an incredibly inconvenient pool table, a digital plant that would grow by controlling light, and a game where you use a keyboard as a tie. 
Alongside those, the RPS gang were exploring the show floor and here you’ll find highlights of what we saw, who we chatted to, what we played, and just general show shenanigans. Enjoy!

There’s a few notable tweaks to MultiVersus in the patch, including a major change to XP between levels 3 and 15. You’ll need twice as much now. Developers Player First Games have tried to rein in infinite combos, too. You can get a look at Rick by watching the trailer below.

Where the original offers a more traditional top-down view where you&#x27;re avoiding cops&#x27; attention by dodging cones of vision, Serial Cleaners sprinkles different characters and abilities into the mix, alongside a visual revamp that ups more than just the aesthetics. And it works! Making the act of evidence disposal an action-packed affair that makes it a great game to play in bursts.

                              <span>When Grounded released into early access a little over two years ago, it immediately became a personal favourite. The story wasn&#x27;t complete and the garden was rather basic, but one encounter with the wolf spider proved that this was far more than a pile of mulch. With two years of updates layering new enemies, items, biomes, dungeons, and quests onto that healthy foundation, Grounded has blossomed into a perennial survival game that sits comfortably among the very best of the genre.

                              <span>Overwatch 2 introduces a bevy of new characters, maps, and modes when it launches early next week. However, the most significant change arriving alongside the sequel&#x27;s new free-to-play format is a Battle Pass. The pass&#x27; free track allows players to unlock a new support character named Kiriko, while its premium track – which costs $10 or 1,000 Overwatch Coins – offers unique cyberpunk-themed cosmetics like weapon charms, souvenirs, and legendary skins. Players who complete the 80-tier premium Battle Pass receive Cyber Demon Genji, the first of Overwatch&#x27;s new class of customizable cosmetics called Mythic Skins. 
We recently interviewed Overwatch 2&#x27;s leadership group to learn about their philosophy while developing the Battle Pass and Mythic Skins&#x27; role in the sequel&#x27;s revamped monetization …</span>

                              <span>At long last, HBO has released the first trailer for The Last of Us. Though officially classified as a “teaser,” it offers nearly two minutes of clips that provide pretty good looks at the upcoming adaptation. 
The teaser doesn’t reveal a premiere date, but we get to see how Joel (Pedro Pascal) and Ellie (Bella Ramsey) survive the post-apocalyptic world, scenes of humanity&#x27;s collapse a la the game&#x27;s prologue, and a quick glimpse of a Clicker. 


The Last of Us is led by Craig Mazin of Chernobyl fame and Naughty Dog co-president Neil Druckmann. We learned during Summer Game Fest that Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson, who portray Joel and Ellie in the games, will have unspecified roles in the series. The Last of Us will be available to stream exclusively on HBO Max in 2023.
To help prepare fans for what&#x27;s to come, Naughty Dog recently released a remake of the first game dubbed The Last of Us Part 1. You can read editor Blake Hester&#x27;s impressions of that title here.</span>

                              <span>In March, the Entertainment Software Association (ESA) announced that E3 would return next year as an in-person show following the cancellation of the 2022 edition. We now know the dates of the event as well as how it will be structured.
E3 2023 takes place at the Los Angeles Convention Center from Tuesday, June 13 through Friday, June 16. Digital presentations, such as the annual press conferences held by first and third-party publishers, take place a couple of days before, beginning June 11. 
The ESA also states that the show will feature separate admission days for industry professionals and the general public. E3 Business Days, designated for developers, publishers, and press/media, take place on June 13-15. Media registration opens in December. 
June 15-16 will host E3 Gamer Days, where fans will be admitted to the show floor. There is no date for public registration at this time. Since E3 first opened its doors to fans in 2017, professionals and the public have largely intermingled for the entirety of the show, which has caused issues in terms of crowd traffic. E3 adopting the same dividing format as events such as Tokyo Game Show should alleviate that problem.   
As previously announced, PAX/New York Comic-Con organizer ReedPop will helm E3 2023. The company has promised to make E3 into a &quot;world class event to serve the global gaming industry.&quot; The last E3 to take place in-person at the LA Convention Center was in 2019. The 2020 show was canceled due to the pandemic, and the 2021 version was a digital-only show.</span>

                              <span>Silent Hill: The Short Message has been rated by South Korea&#x27;s Game Rating committee, and it&#x27;s possible this is a new unannounced Silent Hill game. 
This news comes by way of Video Games Chronicle, which reported that the rating committee rated Silent Hill: The Short Message today. However, the rating did not include any platforms, so it&#x27;s unclear where this game might land if it actually ends up being a real title. In fact, the rating features little else other than listing Uniana as its publisher. As VGC notes, this company regularly publishes Konami games in South Korea. 
The publication also notes that Silent Hill: The Short Message might be related to one of various Silent Hill projects reportedly in the works at multiple different studios. VGC reported in February that Konami is planning a revival of the Silent Hill series amidst other reports stating that a Silent Hill 2 remake is in development. 
While waiting to hopefully learn more about Silent Hill: The Short Message, read about Silent Hill creator Keiichiro Toyama&#x27;s new game, Slitterhead.

                              <span>Marvel has stepped up its gaming output these past few years. Following the success of Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man in 2018 by Insomniac Games, the team later announced Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2, due out sometime next year. Insomniac is also working on a Wolverine game. Elsewhere, Motive Studio just announced last week that it&#x27;s working on a single-player Iron Man game and before that, Marvel pulled back the curtains on Amy Hennig&#x27;s new game that features Black Panther and Captain America. There&#x27;s also Crystal Dynamic&#x27;s Marvel&#x27;s Avengers, which is still getting content today, and last year&#x27;s excellent Marvel&#x27;s Guardians of the Galaxy. 
All of this is to say that Marvel has been pumping out a steady stream of games with more to come. However, despite that, you shouldn&#x27;t expect the company to create a co…</span>

                              <span>Night School Studio has delayed Oxenfree II: Lost Signals. 
Originally set to release this year, Oxenfree II will now debut sometime in 2023. The team didn&#x27;t mention a specific window, however, so as for when in 2023, that remains unknown. It could be just a month or two into the new year or six months into the new year – only time will tell. As for why, Night School Studio says it needs more time to make this sequel &quot;truly special&quot; and to add more localizations. 
Here&#x27;s the studio&#x27;s full statement on the delay:

Sources familiar with the case say the man is the alleged operator of Marvel Streams, a pirate IPTV service that shut down suddenly earlier this year.

                              <span>A while back, I was wondering where all the Steam Deck accessories were. Valve themselves have the case covered, including a decent hard case with even the cheapest 64GB models, and it’s not difficult to pick up one of the best microSD cards for the Steam Deck. Otherwise, and especially with delays to Valve’s official dock, there’s not much out there from the usual PC hardware suppliers.
I therefore turned to the makers and sellers of Etsy, where a kind of indie Steam Deck accessory market has emerged. Soon, I’d bought (with my own money, you’re welcome ReedPop) a selection of unique, handcrafted, sometimes questionable gadgets and appendages, and promptly packed them onto a train for independent appraisal by a newly minted Steam Deck owner. Specifically, RPS vid bud Liam.

                              <span>A great many new Cyberpunk 2077 mods are adding bits and pieces from Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, the new ultraviolent spin-off anime series. Various mods let V dress up as characters from Edgerunners and wield their weapons, as well as adding music, adverts, and more to the game world. Players old and new have flocked to the dystopian RPG since Edgerunners debuted on Netflix earlier this month, and I imagine more than a few might want to cosplay as their Best Girl (a controversial topic which I dare not broach).

The left-winger and lifelong reader of Rail magazine got his thumbs a-twiddlin’ for a special arcade version of the mod while at The World Transformed, a festival being held in Liverpool that celebrates radical politics, art, and culture. This is what he’s doing instead of singing God Save The King at the party conference then.

There hasn’t been an in-person E3 since 2019, and just one digital event bearing the E3 name has taken place since then. That’s a pretty big deal for a show that ran relatively unhindered for almost a quarter of a century. New organisers ReedPop are the people behind PAX, EGX, New York Comic-Con, and Star Wars Celebration, to name a few. I should mention too, of course, that they&#x27;re this site’s parent organisation.

Taki-san&#x27;s performance as character Kyohei Hamura was removed from the Japanese version of Judgment after he was arrested for possession and use of cocaine in 2019, never making it to the West. Now, the Judgment Pierre Taki Restoration Patch finally brings the scrubbed actor back for the very first time, over here at least.

                              <span>Standing here, I realize that this Super Replay will be a cut above the rest because we’ll be slicing and dicing in Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance! Join us today on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central to enjoy two hours of what will be a full playthrough of the cult favorite action game streaming weekly each Friday. 
Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance serves as a sequel/spin-off to Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots that puts cyborg ninja Raiden at the helm. Instead of sneaking around in boxes, players eviscerate foes in fast-paced, stylish action courtesy of developer Platinum Games. Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look. Will I acquire a new appreciation for the game nine years later? How many watermelons will I slice? You’ll have to tune in to find out. 
Watch on Twitch!
Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Blake Hester as we revisit Raiden’s beloved solo adventure. If you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes. You’ll also be granted entry to the official Game Informer Discord channel, where our welcoming community members, moderators, and staff gather to talk games, entertainment, food, and organize hangouts!</span>

                              <span>Everyone&#x27;s talking about Trombone Champ. Not since Untitled Goose Game have I heard this much excited chat about a game from pals who don&#x27;t usually talk about games. This is because: 1) it&#x27;s a fun silly idea; 2) it&#x27;s very funny to miss a trombone note and squeal out a farty toot in the middle of Also Sprach Zarathustra. As I play Trombone Champ myself, I come to really appreciate that. It&#x27;s a rare rhythm game where playing badly doesn&#x27;t frustrate or berate me, because the worst-case scenario is making fart noises, and fart noises are funny.

                              <span>Police in the UK have arrested a 17-year-old in Oxfordshire on suspicion of hacking, and it’s been alleged that it could be connected to the breach at Rockstar Games that led to the recent Grand Theft Auto 6 leaks. Journalist Matthew Keys tweeted that a source has told him that the teenager’s detainment was related to the Rockstar hack and another involving Uber. Keys claimed that the suspect is connected to hacking group Lapsus$, which organises through Telegram channels.

                              <span>The remake of classic stealth ‘em up Splinter Cell will be rewritten and updated for a “modern-day audience”, according to a job posting for the project. Ubisoft Toronto are looking for a scriptwriter for the new Splinter Cell, which they say uses the original as a “foundation” and aims at a “new audience of Splinter Cell fans”.

                              <span>There’s a new fighter announcement incoming from Warner Bros. licensed brawler MultiVersus today, with three already revealed characters yet to release in season one. My money’s on Rick And Morty’s Rick Sanchez, but Stripe from Gremlins and the DC Universe’s Black Adam are still set to arrive too. You’ll have to wait until 6pm BST/7pm CEST/10am PST to find out who the next fighter is, according to a tweet from the MultiVersus team.

We&#x27;re running a Steam Deck Zone filled with minicomps and have a showcase of games with weird controller experiences, and I imagine they&#x27;ll also be playing games, chatting, attending talks, loitering, expanding their LinkedIn networks, and other such expo activities. Kindly, they&#x27;re going to check in across the day, texting us all with updates on what they&#x27;re seeing, doing, and (I imagine) eating. And Ollie might join in from home with cat photos.

                              <span>In this week&#x27;s episode of The Game Informer Show, special guest Matt Storm joins Alex Van Aken and Brian Shea to break down the unprecedented Grand Theft Auto 6 leaks that happened over the weekend. In what is one of the largest video game leaks of all time, over 90 videos showcasing secret in-development footage of the open-world crime sequel were leaked on GTAForums and quickly spread via fans on YouTube and social media. 
Additionally, we chat about this week&#x27;s news of a collaboration between Marvel Games and EA Motive to develop a single-player Iron Man game. During The Playlist, we dive into our time playing Splatoon 3, TemTem, and Metal: Hellsinger.

                              <span>Illumination’s Super Mario Bros. film will get its first teaser trailer next month. It also has a new premiere date for the movie following its delay in April. 
The animated film, starring Chris Pratt as the titular plumber, will hit theaters on April 7, 2023. The biggest question regarding the film has been what Pratt’s Mario performance will sound like, and we may finally get to hear it in just a few weeks. The movie’s first teaser trailer premieres on October 6 at 4 p.m. ET during the New York Comic Con.

The Super Mario Bros. cast includes Charlie Day as Luigi, Anya Taylor-Joy as Peach, Jack Black as Bowser, Keegan-Michael Key as Toad, and Seth Rogan as Donkey Kong. The film was delayed to ensure quality, though Nintendo was reportedly pleased last year with how the film was shaping up at that point. Pratt recently described his performance as “unlike anything you’ve heard in the Mario world,” and it apparently won&#x27;t have an Italian accent.</span>

                              <span>The RPS-beloved turn-based strategy game Solium Infernum is back from the dead. Announced earlier today on stage at EGX London 2022, Armello creators League Of Geeks will be resurrecting and reimagining the game in 2023. Originally released in 2009 by solo dev Vic Davis and his studio Cryptic Comet, Solium Infernum cast you as an Archfiend hoping to stake a claim for Satan&#x27;s empty throne. With a strong emphasis on political intrigue and Machiavellian backstabbing over taking things by force, this strategy game from hell was a firm RPS favourite back in the day, spawning an eight-part diary series of the team&#x27;s play-by-email multiplayer adventures. Alas, it never quite found the audience it deserved back in the early 2010s, eventually causing Davis to shut up shop completely in 2015 and pursue a career in tabletop.
League Of Geeks are here to change that, though, and after speaking with studio director and co-founder Trent Kusters (both at EGX earlier today and during a hands-off presentation of their pre-alpha demo late last week), it&#x27;s clear the team have taken great care in bringing Solium Infernum up to date for modern audiences. It leans into all the same kinds of mind games as Cryptic Comet&#x27;s original, and its simultaneous turn structure is still very much intact – just with lusher 3D visuals, and all-new, revamped menu screens. And it looks devilishly good.

                              <span>Playing Wayward Strand feels like navigating a detailed clockwork mechanism. It reminds me of those cuckoo clocks where on the hour every hour a tiny door opens revealing two mechanical dolls that come together and have a &#x27;lil smooch. That’s essentially how Wayward Strand works but on a bigger scale. Characters are set on strict routines, following predetermined paths and schedules that are often invisible to you. They welcome an interruption - a friendly natter or helpful hand - but whether you’re there or not, they’ll go about their business regardless. The world keeps on spinning and all that.
It’s an interesting way of capturing the passage of time, and in Wayward Strand how you choose to spend that time is pretty important in a game that makes a point of not waiting for you.

                              <span>The Apple TV show Ted Lasso has proven to be one of the most popular and well-liked series of the last few years, introducing viewers to a lovable cast of characters whose lives and storylines largely revolve around the fictional English Premier League football club, AFC Richmond. Through its first two seasons, the series has taken home numerous awards, including the Primetime Emmy for Outstanding Comedy Series in 2021 and 2022, with several of its actors – including Jason Sudeikis, Brett Goldstein, and Hannah Waddingham – taking home awards for original performances. Now, Ted Lasso reaches into a new realm: video games. 
EA Sports today announced that Ted Lasso and AFC Richmond are joining the FIFA 23 roster of teams. Lasso is joined on the sidelines by Coach Beard, with the pitch being populated by some of the team&#x27;s biggest stars like Jamie Tartt, Roy Kent, Dani Rojas, Sam Obisanya, and Isaac McAdoo. While the actors&#x27; likenesses are included in the product, EA Sports hasn&#x27;t indicated if we&#x27;ll be hearing Jamie Tartt and Roy Kent&#x27;s signature crowd chants (though it seems doubtful, seeing as how Roy Kent&#x27;s chant would probably bump the ESRB rating up to M for Mature).
Regardless of that fact, you can play matches at AFC Richmond&#x27;s home ground, Nelson Road, and even take control of Coach Lasso or AFC Richmond through Career Mode. AFC Richmond is also playable in Kick-Off, Online Friendlies, and Online Seasons. FIFA 23 Ultimate Team is also adding several AFC Richmond customization items, including kits, TIFOs, and the option to select Ted Lasso or Coach Beard as your FUT club&#x27;s manager. All the AFC Richmond content in FUT will be obtainable through objectives and challenges.
You can see Ted Lasso and the AFC Richmond squad in action through the trailer below.


FIFA 23 arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4. Xbox One, PC, and Stadia on September 30.</span>

When Gun Interactive revealed The Texas Chain Saw Massacre last year, I was underwhelmed by its short teaser but excited about its potential. It’s one of my favorite horror movie franchises, partly because of how much it still scares me – every good haunted house has a Leatherface at the end that chases you out to the exit, right? – but also because of its backdrop: Texas.

                              <span>The Sonic the Hedgehog brand&#x27;s expansion throughout multimedia has given fans plenty to enjoy in recent years. Whether you&#x27;re talking about the two well-received films, the fun Sonic Boom animated series, or the long-running and beloved comic series, people who enjoy the Sonic the Hedgehog video games have had plenty of other avenues to expand their fandom. The next project to land on that list is Sonic Prime, the upcoming Netflix series that gives us all-new adventures with Sonic and his friends/enemies.
Today, Netflix and Sega released a teaser trailer giving us a taste of the action. It doesn&#x27;t show much, but if the 40 seconds of action are any indication, it&#x27;s bringing plenty of style and fun (as well as several classic characters). You can check out the trailer in the header above.
Sonic Prime is set to release exclusively on Netflix this winter. For more on what else Sonic is getting up to this winter, check out our exclusive coverage hub of Sonic Frontiers here. For our thoughts on the latest Sonic video game release, Sonic Origins, head here.</span>

                              <span>Tokyo Game Show is in full swing, especially now that the general public has invaded the Makuhari Messe convention center this weekend. Blake Hester and I have been touring the show floor, checking out games, and taking plenty of pictures. We shared our first batch of TGS photos yesterday (check them out here) and have even more images to help make you feel as close to the event without being here as possible.

                              <span>Hot on the heels of this week&#x27;s announcement of Ken, Dhalsim, Blanka, and E.Honda in Street Fighter 6, Capcom has posted the opening video of World Tour mode from the highly anticipated sixth mainline entry in its legendary fighting franchise. Through the video, the publisher reveals the full fighter roster at launch, featuring a good mix of fresh faces and familiar foes.
The launch lineup of fighters includes 18 characters to choose from. You can see the full list below.
Blanka
Cammy
Chun-Li
Dee Jay
Dhalsim
E. Honda
Guile
Jamie
JP
Juri
Ken
Kimberly
Lily
Luke
Manon
Marisa
Ryu
Zangief


Many of these fighters made their first appearances in Street Fighter (Ken and Ryu) or Street Fighter II (Blanka, Cammy, Chun-Li, Dee Jay, Dhalsim, E. Honda, Guile, Zangief). However, some fresher faces include Juri (debuted in Street Fighter IV) and Luke (debuted in Street Fighter V), and six all-new characters: Jamie, JP, Kimberly, Lily, Manon, and Marisa.
Check out the opening movie above and start plotting who will be your main when Street Fighter 6 launches on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC next year.

NBA 2K23, the latest in Visual Concepts’ long-running, annualized basketball series, introduces multiple new features and revamped game mechanics while taking us on a stroll down memory lane. Though the 2K franchise has garnered a reputation for focusing more on microtransactions than actual gameplay innovation, this year’s game mode additions and foundational improvements mostly overshadow the notorious pay-to-win schemes. The result is a package that feels more novel than other titles in the …</span>

Although Capcom just pulled the curtain back on the next batch of fighters to join the roster, my demo included the first playable sessions for the last trio of reveals: Guile, Juri, and newcomer Kimberly. Since Kimberly was the wildcard of that bunch, I opted to spend most of my hands-on time discovering what she brings to the table. After only a few rounds, I had a tough time wanting to switch to anyone else.
If you haven’t been keeping up, Kimberly is a ninja pupil of Guy who adores the ‘80s and graffiti. She incorporates the latter interest into her acrobatic offense, such as throwing exploding spray cans like they’re shurikens. That’s silly and fantastic.

The Pokémon franchise has been more prolific than usual as of late, with multiple releases over the past year and another big entry coming soon. However, those without a Switch or looking for a suitable monster-battling alternative should focus on Temtem, which has emerged from years of early-access development. While borrowing heavily from the formula of Nintendo’s massive franchise, its world is fun to explore, and collecting and learning all about the titular Temtems is satisfying. Although the core adventure is a smi…</span>

                              <span>I adore Final Fantasy VII, and I was similarly enamored with Remake. Given the latter game’s events and the tantalizing trailer for its second part, Rebirth, it had me thinking that it may be a good time to dust off my copy of 2008’s Crisis Core. Square Enix read my mind by announcing a remaster of Zack Fair’s PSP adventure, christening it with the subtitle “Reunion,” giving newcomers the answer to the question of “who the heck was that black-haired fella in Remake?” As for me, I thought I had a good reason to return to the game. After playing a decent chunk of Reunion at Tokyo Game Show, I’m all good. 
My expectations were always reasonable. Reunion is a remaster, not a remake the scale of, well, Remake. That means that feature-wise, the best way to sum it up is “That PSP game? You can pl…</span>

                              <span>Let me fill you in on a little secret most people won&#x27;t tell you: the real way to enjoy a video game show is at home, comfortably on your couch, watching the event on YouTube. 
Over the years, the game press has done a remarkable job tricking you into thinking otherwise. The shows look extravagant, energetic, and almost like we&#x27;re getting glimpses into the future, which we then curate into bite-sized news stories and on-demand trailers for our faithful readers back home. 
The reality is much more depressing.
Whether it&#x27;s E3, PAX, Gamescom, or in this case, Tokyo Game Show, going to a video game trade event means dealing with the near-lethal combination of jetlag and overwork. The brutal FOMO of being in some of the coolest cities in the world but spending all your time in convention halls. The unbelievable cacophony of thousands of people talking at once. The unbelievable smells of thousands of people all standing too close to each other. The never-ending lines of thousands of people all needing to use the toilet at the same time. This doesn&#x27;t even touch on the unavoidable safety concerns of having a video game conference in the midst of an ongoing pandemic. But I digress.
All that said, there&#x27;s some fun stuff to look at, like big, gaudy statues and giant booths that likely cost tens of thousands of dollars for games you&#x27;ve never heard of and likely will never play. Stuff that really makes it all worth it. 
While we&#x27;d love to fly each and every one of you out to Tokyo, sadly, we only had the budget to fly out two of our full-time employees. So in lieu of attending yourself, please enjoy my curated batch of pictures of what I saw on the show floor. 
Well, there you have it, folks. All the fun of TGS without actually being there. See you next year!</span>

                              <span>Capcom has revealed that it will hold a Resident Evil-focused showcase in October, presumably to discuss both Resident Evil Village&#x27;s upcoming DLC, The Winters&#x27; Expansion, which comes out next month, and Resident Evil 4 Remake. And speaking of Resident Evil 4 Remake, producer Yoshiaki Hirabayashi confirmed during Tokyo Game Show that the remake will also be coming to PlayStation 4, as reported by GameSpot. 
When Resident Evil 4 Remake was revealed during a PlayStation State of Play held back in June, Capcom said it was coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, with no mention of old-gen consoles like the PS4 and Xbox One. Now the company has confirmed that the game will be available on PS4 when it launches on March 24, 2023. There&#x27;s no word if Resident Evil 4 Remake will come to Xb…</span>

                              <span>Konami has revealed Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remaster Gate Rune and Dunan Unification Wars, a remaster of the first two classic Suikoden JRPGs, and the two will be released as a single package sometime next year on consoles and PC. 
More specifically, these two remasters will be packaged into the same collection and this remastered duo is due out on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC (via Steam) in 2023. The first Suikoden was released in 1995, and its sequel, Suikoden II, was released in 1998. Check out what the remastered versions of these classic games look like in the announcement trailer below: 


As you can see, these remasters are looking excellent, especially in the way that the original look and feel of the sprite imagery remains intact. Here&#x27;s hoping they feel as great to play as they did back in the day. 
Here are some highlights of this remastered collection from the game&#x27;s Steam page:
