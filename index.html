                              <span>The company also plans to review its real-estate footprint
EA has announced it will be laying off roughly 6% of its workforce as part of a restructuring effort.
Electronic Arts&#x27; most recent reports (via GamesIndustry.biz) put that number around 775. The publisher is also taking a look at its real estate and shifting its strategy.
&quot;As we drive greater focus across our portfolio, we are moving away from projects that do not contribute to our strategy, reviewing our real estate footprint, and restructuring some of our teams,&quot; said CEO Andrew Wilson in a note to staff.
&quot;This is the most difficult part, and we are working through the process with the utmost care and respect. Where we can, we are providing opportunities for our colleagues to transition onto other projects,&quot; Wilson said. &quot;Where that&#x27;s not possible, we are providing severance pay and additional benefits such as health care and career transition services.&quot;
EA started informing employees earlier in the quarter, and the publisher expects to be informing more affected workers into the next fiscal year, starting April 1.
Additionally, Wilson said the company is &quot;operating from a position of strength&quot; and will be focusing on a handful of priorities moving forward. This includes building games with large communities, making the most of those communities with social and creator tools, and creating blockbuster interactive storytelling.
More tech layoffs
Some cuts to the workforce at EA were already made earlier this year, as over 200 QA staff working on Apex Legends were laid off recently from the Baton Rouge team.
Meanwhile, Respawn recently announced a new studio to bolster Apex Legends development in Madison, Wisconsin.

Wargroove is back with its sequel Wargroove 2, a surprise follow-up that returns to the tile-based tactics. And while it&#x27;s hitting many of the same notes as its predecessor, we got to go hands-on with its new spin on turn-based warfare: the Conquest mode.
The Conquest mode is one of Wargroove 2&#x27;s big new features. It&#x27;s a roguelike approach to battles that follows a familiar structure if you&#x27;ve ever played other styles of roguelike. Yet for all the familiarity of this concept, it wound up being a pretty refreshing take on the turn-by-turn fights of Wargroove.

I&#x27;ve tested all but the keyboard, and they&#x27;re fantastic pieces of kit - and now at surprisingly low prices.

                              <span>Normally we expect to pay around £200 for a mid-range gaming monitor, but today you can pick one up for just £149 after a significant discount in Amazon&#x27;s Spring Sale. This is a great price for the Samsung Odyssey G3, a 27-in flat VA panel monitor that boasts a 165Hz refresh rate, 1080p resolution and excellent adjustability.

                              <span>Last time, you decided that ground pound attacks are better than reloads dumping unspent ammo. 60% against 40%, that one, which is a satisfying outcome. Chunky disagreement but a clear outcome. This week, I ask you to think carefully about two quite different cycles, one repeating and one resuming. What&#x27;s better: time loops, or resuming interrupted reloads?

                              <span>Alt.Ctrl.GDC is a regular fixture at the Game Developers Conference, and this year I spotted some properly incredible creations from its largely student-led group of exhibitors. There was a big focus on co-op games and time trial demos in this year&#x27;s cohort, with nearly every stand having some sort of whiteboard pinned up that was constantly being scrubbed out with new fastest lap times and corresponding visitor names. There was also lots of friendly hooting emanating from them as well, as mates and strangers attempted to co-ordinate their gaggles of limbs to steer various game characters in the right direction. 
It was excellent fun, and I sampled a bunch of games that used toasters, intricate pulley systems, papier-mache tree stumps, bike wheels and more in place of your typical controllers and mice and keyboard. There were also plenty more I didn&#x27;t get to try out, mainly due to time, and you can see the full list over on GDC&#x27;s website. For now, though, here are some personal highlights of what I saw, including the largest bowler hat I think I&#x27;ve ever seen in my life.

                              <span>Are you a fan of RPGs where you make friends with adorable critters? Not a fan of trapping said friends into small balls, only letting them out to fight gangs and other Godlike creatures? Well, Cassette Beasts might be the game for you. It&#x27;s a Pokémon-like where you’ll still be beating up wildlife creatures in turn-based combat, but rather than capturing them, you record their likeness on the titular tapes and then transform into those same street cone-wearing crabs and metal-clad wolves. It looks like an energetic, nostalgic romp, and it’s coming to PC and Game Pass on April 26th.

Last week, Polish site Bankier spoke with Bloober Team’s CEO Pitor Babieno in an interview that was mistranslated and began to circulate online. The mistranslations mentioned the remake was “technically ready” for launch, but Bloober Team have clarified these “statements have been taken out of context, due to inaccurate translations.”

                              <span>There’s always been something quaintly practical about the name Command &amp; Conquer. Sure, there’s a touch of Julius Caesar’s ‘veni, vidi, vici’ in there. But less romantically, the title evokes Internet Explorer or Acrobat Reader - sitting comfortably alongside the clearly and sensibly labelled Windows software of the mid-90s. It’s a reminder of just how early Westwood happened upon the blueprint for real-time strategy, right as many PC users were buying their first trackball mice.

Back then, the developer was fresh from Dune II, its unlikely David Lynch adaptation and progenitor of the RTS genre as we know it today. Inspired by the house politics and struggle for resources that consumed the desert planet Arrakis, Westwood had come up with an addictive formula for harvesting spice and converting that wealth into military power, which in turn could be used in the battle to secure more spice. The team was, quite frankly, surprised by how much fun that formula had turned out to be.

                              <span>Waking up in a room you don&#x27;t recognise with a camera trained on you: the result of a heavy Saturday night, or the opening salvo in an inexplicable kidnapping? In The Tartarus Key, a PS1-style thriller/puzzle/horror game, it&#x27;s definitely the latter. The free demo is out now, and throws you into the first couple of puzzles for the game as Alex, whose last memory is of being at home in her apartment. Now she finds herself locked in a weird study in a poorly lit mansion, with only a stranger on the end of a walkie-talkie for company. It was enough to staple this game right into the middle of my disorganised Charlie Day conspiracy board of games I&#x27;m interested in, I&#x27;ll tell you that much.

                              <span>The federal government in Australia have today proposed a number of changes to their National Classification Scheme as they seek to crack down on digital gambling and video games that promote it. The proposed changes would apply an R18+ (over 18s) rating to any game with simulated gambling, and an M for “mature” (over 15s) rating to any games with paid loot boxes, potentially changing the classification for games such as FIFA which were previously G-rated (for everyone).

Like any D&amp;D campaign, the crossover begins around a blocky table with an open pizza box, and then it escalates into a roughly ten-hour, action-RPG take on Minecraft as you trek through the classic tabletop’s fantasy world.

                              <span>Sad horror? Misery?
If you’re like me, you enjoy your horror best when it’s sad. Video games can’t really scare me anymore, but gosh, they sure can get me depressed. Not that it’s difficult. A happy memory can depress me.
Anyway, a portion of Mortal Meal was featured on the Haunted PS1 Demo Disc: Spectral Mall compilation that was released back in 2022. The Haunted PS1 Demo Disc is sort of a nexus for experimental, lo-fi horror, and somehow I’m not on their mailing list. Thankfully, it usually passes my radar eventually.
Mortal Meal is perhaps a direct take on the genre, being largely a walking simulator. It’s also not terribly scary, but then, how would I know? It’s more focused on telling a melancholic narrative while weaving in a bit of levity and some fantastic horror imagery.

                              <span>One small slice has me ready for the whole thing
This week, we got a solid look at Link&#x27;s next adventure in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. It was a roughly 10-minute slice of gameplay, the most we&#x27;ve seen of the game thus far. And for me, I don&#x27;t think I need to see any more of it until launch.
Zelda&#x27;s gameplay showcase, hosted by series producer Eiji Aonuma, might seem unassuming compared to other big gameplay spotlights. It had the same tenor as the character reveals for Super Smash Bros. Ultimate; rather than make a big production or splice together a sizzle reel, it was just a chopped-and-guided tour through the new Hyrule. For one of year&#x27;s biggest presumptive hits, it was a chill stream that let the game speak for itself. And it really did talk.

                              <span>It&#x27;s July 1, 2023 at Anime Expo
Several weeks ago, Atlus unveiled the existence of a Shin Megami Tensei 30th anniversary concert called &quot;Band of Shadows.&quot; Held at Anime Expo 2023 in July in Los Angeles, this is billed as the &quot;first ever live anniversary concert for Atlus in the west.&quot; It&#x27;ll focus on Shin Megami Tensei works, and not the Persona series: the focus of most of the company&#x27;s concert-based events in the past.
Interestingly, the concert is also getting the backing of voice actors from the series who will host and appear at the event, including: Christian La Monte (Demi-fiend – Shin Megami Tensei III), Casey Mongillo (Nahobino – Shin Megami Tensei V), and Daman Mills (Aogami – Shin Megami Tensei V).
According to Atlus, doors will open at 6:30PM PT on July 1, and again, tickets are exclusively tied to Anime Expo attendees. Pre-sale tickets are live now, and you can get them here.

Ticket pricing tiers for the Shin Megami Tensei Anime Expo concert:
VIP Pit (Standing) &#x3D; $95
VIP Balcony &#x3D; $85
GA Floor (Standing) &#x3D; $70
GA Balcony &#x3D; $50
Similar to many Comic-Cons and the like, there&#x27;s an add-on, too:
&quot;A pre-show reception is scheduled and will feature early access to concert merchandise, a meet-and-greet with the show hosts, a themed autograph card signed by the show hosts, light hors d&#x27;oeuvres, and more. The pre-show reception will have limited availability and is a $125 add-on to all concert ticket purchases.&quot;

                              <span>Also, Meet Your Maker and Tails of Iron
Warm up your network card, Sony has announced their offerings for their “Essential” Tier offerings for all PlayStation Plus subscribers. Free for the month of April will be Sackboy: The Big Adventure, Meet Your Maker, and Tails of Iron.

Beginning with Sackboy: The Big Adventure, this 2020 LittleBigPlanet spin-off was described as Destructoid’s resident snack-cake, Chris Carter, as a “chill platformer.” It ditches the creation suite that was such a focus of the LittleBigPlanet games to instead create a unique and charming platformer.

Next up is Meet Your Maker from Behaviour Interactive. This title is currently unreleased, so it you’ll be able to grab it free on its launch date if you’re a PlayStation Plus subscriber. Behaviour Interactive describes it as a first-person build and raid game. It has a co-op and base-building focus, so it’s something to grab if you need a game to share with a friend. If you have one.

Finally, Tails of Iron is a Souls-like action-RPG, that Destructoid’s resident tough-lad, Chris Moyse, described as one of the most distinctive RPG experiences of 2021.
There’s nothing on this list that strikes me as something I need to download and play right away, but they’re all welcome additions to the library. Sackboy and Tails of Iron are both well-loved titles, while Meet Your Maker still needs to prove itself in the crucible of opinion.
Sackboy: The Big Adventure, Meet Your Maker, and Tails of Iron will be available to all PlayStation Plus subscribers on April 4, 2023 until May 1.

                              <span>Expanding the world of Forspoken
Square Enix&#x27;s Forspoken is getting a little more story. The special story DLC &quot;In Tanta We Trust&quot; arrives for Forspoken on PS5 and PC on May 26.
The DLC will dive into the world of Athia and its past, before the events of the main game. As Square Enix describes it, this DLC will show the battle that drove the Tantas to madness.
https://twitter.com/Forspoken/status/1641062989724884994/
The DLC will be up for purchase on May 26, and will also be available for owners of the Digital Deluxe Edition of Forspoken. If you got that version, you&#x27;ll also get a few days&#x27; early access to the DLC.
A new view of Athia
Forspoken was one of the first big games of 2023, and received a fairly lukewarm reception. In our own look at the game, it seems like Forspoken plays it safe in many areas, but does have some neat visuals and cool concept for its combat.
Still, that&#x27;s not always enough to save a game from the fallout. Square Enix announced that Luminous Productions, after launching Forspoken, is being absorbed into Square Enix. The publisher also characterized sales of Forspoken as &quot;lackluster,&quot; and review of it were &quot;challenging.&quot;
Meanwhile, Square Enix president Yosuke Matsuda confirmed he&#x27;s stepping down in June, with current company director Takashi Kiryu stepping up pending shareholder approval. It&#x27;s a season of change for Square Enix, as some games miss marks and leadership shifts around, following a year where the company sold off some big studios.
The Forspoken story DLC In Tanta We Trust will drop for PS5 and PC on May 26.

Wizards of the Coast is still rolling with multiple Magic: The Gathering sets each year (for both paper Magic and digital variants like Magic: Arena), and the next set, March of the Machine, is ready to debut in April.
There are some heavy-hitting artists backing this set, including the always fantastic Magali Villeneuve: who I would consider one of the greatest artists in the history of Magic. You can get a look at some spoiler cards for March of the Machine below, as well as some full art. The full story of the set can be read here.
March of the Machine is out on April 21, 2023 in full, with pre-release events starting on April 14, and a digital release on April 18.

After word got around about Bloober Team&#x27;s remake of Silent Hill 2, the studio has released a statement clarifying certain details about the game&#x27;s forecast and readiness.
In the statement, Bloober says it doesn&#x27;t comment on rumors, but felt the need to clarify recent statements that were &quot;taken out of context, due to inaccurate translations.&quot;
This arrives after an interview with Bankier.pl was circled online, in statements that appear to have been mistranslated. Bloober says the company&#x27;s messages did not contain sales forecasts of specific titles, and that figure connected to Silent Hill 2 refer to the &quot;potential success&quot; of the type of games it will be focusing on in the future.

The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom had its first gameplay demonstration from Nintendo, reintroducing fans to the world of Hyrule with roughly 10 minutes of gameplay. There were many fantastic moments and reveals in this presentation, ranging from each of the new powers to the islands in the sky.

Even within the relatively brief gameplay demonstration for The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, there are several standout moments that happen. Here are the 10 best situations and reveals that happened during the recent presentation in no particular order.

                              <span>The phoenix rises
That was fast. Bandai Namco has dropped yet another trailer for Tekken 8, this one focusing on Ling Xiaoyu. Ling was previously unannounced for the game, so this trailer is a big reveal for her. I’m mostly just surprised that this happened so quickly after Jun Kazama capped off the reveal trailers for their already-revealed cast.
This maybe shouldn’t be a huge surprise. Ling Xiaoyu was introduced way back in Tekken 3 and has been in every entry since. She initially wanted to win enough money to build her own amusement park but eventually got wrapped up in the family drama of the Kazama family.
https://youtu.be/vTd2XeL4ygQ
The trailer shows Ling Xiaoyu kicking her winged slippers at Nina Williams and King, who commenters have pointed out were her foes in the Tekken: Bloodline anime. Much of the time, she’s wearing her trademark smile right up until she gets mad and nukes King’s well-developed abs.
Ling Xiaoyu gets the spotlight after the previously shown characters: Jin Kazama, Marshall Law, Nina Williams, King, Paul Phoenix, Jack-8, Lars Alexandersson, Kazuya Mishima, and Jun Kazama. Bandai Namco hasn’t said how large the roster is going to be, exactly, but they’ve certainly got a brisk pace going on with these trailers.
Tekken 8 is currently in development for PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X. It is tentatively expected to launch late in 2023 or early 2024.

Game Freak and Nintendo are no stranger to Pokemon promos: whether they require you to go to a retail location or not. This newest one unfortunately is the former; and oh, it&#x27;s also tied to GameStop. Just like the flying Pikachu doled out at the launch of the new generation, this promo Pokemon is also in flight: and it&#x27;s a pig. Get it?! With April Fools&#x27; coming up, you know someone couldn&#x27;t resist. Yep, it&#x27;s a flying tera type Lechonk.
If you follow the GameStop link in the announcement tweet, you&#x27;ll just get a generic &quot;find a GameStop in my area&quot; landing page. But TCG site Pokebeach has more info, noting that the codes will be available in stores on March 31, in an effort to tie it to the Scarlet &amp; Violet new TCG set. Welp, marketing kinda botched that connection! Pokebeach says that there is no purchase necessary for these promo cards (as in the past), which will provide a code to download the flying Lechonk.
There&#x27;s also a separate promo going on featuring the Pokemon TCG, which is potentially linked to a $15 in-store purchase, as a reverse holo card. I say &quot;potentially&quot; because individual stores might not require said purchase, but that&#x27;s going to be up to the stores themselves.
Either way, you can get a free Lechonk. Maybe you already have 20.

A game like Demonschool feels like the kind of mash-up that makes obvious sense in hindsight. Tactics games are quite popular, as are their often-accompanying social mechanics and life-sim elements. So combining demons and school makes sense.
But Demonschool is a lot more than the sum of its parts. It&#x27;s a sleek, engaging tactics game that gets right to the thick of things. It&#x27;s a school life sim that easily slots into the overall drives of the story. And it&#x27;s a game I&#x27;ve been thinking a lot about since my two playthroughs at PAX East 2023.

                              <span>Yasunori Mitsuda has worked on dozens of games since the mid-90s, but he is best known for his work on Chrono Trigger. The story of how he came to work on the game is surprisingly straightforward. &quot;[Sea of Stars creative director Thierry Boulanger] was like, ‘We have a contact that is in touch with all these people. And he just kind of reached out, and [Mitsuda] liked what he saw. And so he&#x27;s like, &#x27;Yeah, I would, I would love to be a part of this’,” Sea of Stars lead composer Eric W. Brown says. “There’s no words to describe this. Like, it’s… we literally got the guy.” Mitsuda committed to creating about 10 tracks for the game, and the process has been smooth.

On paper, Crime Boss: Rockay City is bombastic, star-studded, and promises a city-spanning adventure about a criminal organization’s rise to the top. The actual game, however, is anything but. The gameplay is unbalanced, buggy, repetitive, and boring. The celebrity-filled cast is exciting at first glance, but crude and humorless writing weighs down the already-phoned-in performances of characters voiced by Michael Madsen, Michael Rooker, Vanilla Ice, and more. The single-player roguelite campaign lacks any of the genre’s typical hooks, and bu…</span>

                              <span>Forspoken may not have set the world on fire, but those who enjoyed it have a new reason to revisit the world of Athia. Square Enix has announced a new story expansion called In Tanta We Trust, and it takes place decades before the campaign begins.
The story sees Frey Holland follow a mysterious voice that leads to her being sent back in time 25 years before she first stepped foot in Athia. She arrives at the Purge of Rheddig, the battle that caused Athia’s collapse and pushed the Tantas to madness. Frey must now fight to save this era of Athia, and she has backup in the form of Tanta Cinta. Frey gains new magical powers, including tag-team-focused abilities that utilize Tanta Cinta’s talents. The DLC also features new environments for players to scale using Frey’s parkour skills. 
Forspoken: In Tanta We Trust is a paid expansion that launches on May 26. Those who purchased the Digital Deluxe Edition of the game can play it three days early, on May 23.

It&#x27;s been more than eight years since Tekken 7 arrived in arcades across the globe. While the console version didn&#x27;t hit for another two years, the gap since that seventh entry represents the largest distance between two mainline entries since the series began in 1994. Bandai Namco used that time to evolve the experience, adding several new characters by way of DLC en route to the announcement of a highly anticipated eighth entry.
With so much time since Tekken 7 launched, Tekken 8 represents not only the franchise&#x27;s first game developed for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, but als…</span>

                              <span>Earlier this month, developer Deck 13 revealed that its upcoming action RPG, Atlas Fallen, would arrive May. Now today, less than a month later, Deck 13 has announced that the game has been delayed to August. 
More specifically, Atlas Fallen will now hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on August 10. This news comes after previewers recently went hands-on with the game as part of a press event and after the game was showcased at PAX East, which took place last week. As for why Deck 13 is delaying Atlas Fallen, the team says it needs more time with the game.

Deck 13 also revealed that this delay will allow the team to include a full German voiceover for Atlas Fallen.

The numbers shared then were very promising and since then I&#x27;ve had more time looking at the performance impact of Intel&#x27;s stellar software optimization work and its impact on real-world workloads. Here is a look at how Intel&#x27;s pending kernel optimization patches are a huge deal for today&#x27;s high core count servers.</span>

Bytten Studio has announced a release date for its unique monster-catching RPG Cassette Beasts. The game launches on Steam, the Microsoft Store, and PC Game Pass on 26th April, and it&#x27;ll land on Switch later in the Spring — that means realistically we shouldn&#x27;t have to wait long to fuse these little fellas together.
In Cassette Beasts, it&#x27;s not just about catching and battling with your monsters á la Pokémon or Digimon. And you use a cassette to &quot;catch&quot; them in. But the best part is that you, the player character, can fuse with these creatures yourself or you can fuse them with other monsters.

The Final Fantasy Pixel Remasters are due to release in spring 2023, which means the collection of classic Final Fantasy titles should be just around the corner. We don&#x27;t have a date yet, and it sounds like Square Enix isn&#x27;t ready to reveal that date yet, either — except pre-orders have started being charged.
Over on ResetEra (via Push Square), AlexFlame116 shared an email they got from Square Enix after the company indicated it would begin taking payment for the 35th Anniversary Edition from the 5th April. Others based in Europe have said they&#x27;ve received a similar email, but that payments will begin being processed from 31st March.

Good Smile Company has announced that its range of Undertale Nendoroid figures is growing as The Human will enter the fray later on this year.
The figure comes with an &quot;Expressionless face&quot; Face Plate and a number of optional parts including a SOUL heart, Flowey and a special hand so that the figure can hold onto the upcoming Toriel Nendoroid when it is released — how adorable!

Rejoice, sinners, for redemption is on its way. Saga of Sins puts players in control of Cecil, a battle-weary cleric who has recently returned from the Crusades. Rather than receive a joyous reception when he arrives, he sees his home village of Sinwell has become infested with plague and its citizens consumed with their sinful ways.
Fortunately, Cecil’s master, Ulrich, has a solution to the crisis gripping Sinwell. He grants Cecil the power to enter people’s minds and battle the sin within them — first as a Werewolf that shoots fireballs from its mouth, and later as a flame-breathing Gargoyle and, eventually, as a winged Griffin. By taking these forms and diving into the hearts of those indulging in sin, Cecil can battle the demons and free the people from their influence.

If you know Splatoon 3, then you know Big Man. The loveable Manta Ray is one of the first faces that you see when you boot up the game and his wobbly little dance moves immediately captured our hearts when Deep Cut first burst onto the scene. But what if we have been referring to this icon by nothing but a nickname for all of these months? What would his &#x27;proper&#x27; name even be?
Well, as it turns out, it might just be Ian. Yep. Ian...

Heart Core’s Gripper has a lot to like at first glance. Motorcycle slides inspired by the classic anime, Akira? Yes, please. Starring a stylish half-cybernetic young man named None? Weird name, but cool. A slick art style and a heavy synthwave soundtrack? You’re speaking our language.
The opening cinematic introduces an intriguing setup. Returning to find his home world destroyed, None finds out that a disembodied robot head – reminiscent of Andross in the original Star Fox – called Zero is responsible. Zero isn’t very nice and beats None to a pulp. His old robotic feline pal, Cat-Kit, pieces him back together with a twist: to live, he must remain connected to his motorcycle to keep his new half-cybernetic body charged. Cat-Kit then reveals he also must rip out the hearts of four Guardian robots to save his world and defeat Zero.

After being officially announced way back in September 2020, it was a nice surprise to see Teslagrad 2 — the follow-up to Rain Games&#x27; critically-acclaimed metroidvania — appear at last year&#x27;s Future Games Show. Now the good folk over at Modus Games have given us a closer look at the upcoming title with some magnetic new screenshots.
Showcasing the new lands of Wyrmheim with five gorgeous environments and some of Lumina&#x27;s electromagnetic powers, this latest look is setting the sequel up to be even prettier than the last. We&#x27;re particular fans of the giant snake boss towering over the hero in picture three — if there&#x27;s one thing that never fails to make us giggle with glee, it&#x27;s a battle with a huge boss.

Acute Owl Studio&#x27;s undead cooking game Bone&#x27;s Cafe is coming to Switch on 31st March, and it looks absolutely to die for. The game launched on Steam last year to extremely positive reviews, and now it&#x27;s rising from the grave to make its mark on the eShop.
Taking inspiration from Overcooked, in Bone&#x27;s Cafe, you&#x27;re a necromancer who&#x27;s dropped out of school in order to open your own cafe. That&#x27;s everyone&#x27;s dream in college, right? Well, you can use those necromancy powers to run that cafe, and you&#x27;ll get to customise the layout, tell your minions what to do, and work together with friends.

As a part of the recent D&amp;D Direct presentation, we got our first look at some brand-new Dungeons &amp; Dragons-themed Minecraft DLC that will be adventuring its way into the game at some point this spring (thanks, Polygon).
While the above trailer might not give the most precise details in regard to the DLC&#x27;s release date, it does give a pretty good impression of what we might encounter in the Forgotten Realms including Icewind Dale and Candlekeep as well as Mojang&#x27;s take on some blocky baddies like Beholders, Mindflayers and Gelatinous Cubes.

It&#x27;s the end of a generation, with Nintendo yesterday calling time on the 3DS and Wii U eShops. Now that digital sales and physical production have come to a halt, the Switch creator is essentially done with these older platforms, but that doesn&#x27;t mean everyone is....

It currently sits at a &quot;Mostly Negative&quot; rating after nearly 3000 reviews, with players reporting regular crashes and plentiful performance issues.

                              <span>Balsa Model Flight Simulator launched into Steam Early Access last year, to positive reviews and few sales. It is, like its developer&#x27;s previous game Kerbal Space Program, about building a machine designed to fly, crashing it back to earth, then constructing something better. 

Now its developer has announced they&#x27;re doing something similar with the game itself. Balsa Model Flight Sim will relaunch later this year with a new name, Kitbash Model Club, a more ambitious physics construction sandbox, and a plan to release as a complete game rather than into early access. Existing owners of Balsa Model Flight Simulator will get Kitbash Model Club for free.

                              <span>Company Of Heroes 3 had rough beach landing, garnering mostly positive reviews from critics (like us) and mixed-to-negative reviews from players on Steam. Today&#x27;s release of its first major update, titled Operation Sapphire Jackal, may help address that disparity given that it promises to fix &quot;hundreds&quot; of bugs in the base game. On the other hand, it also adds cosmetics - both those that can be unlocked for free and via spending real money.

This one is a cracker though - you can now pick up a 28-inch 4K monitor for just £181, a great choice for anyone that plays slower-paced PC or console games, or wants a high-quality 4K monitor for content creation and consumption. This Lenovo IPS monitor normally costs £260, so to get it for nearly £80 less is quite a scoop.

                              <span>The Lenovo Legion 5 is a laptop that I&#x27;ve recommended here at RPS on several occasions, as it gets excellent reviews online yet still provides much better specs and build quality than you&#x27;d expect for the money. 
Today though, the Legion 5 is the best deal I&#x27;ve ever seen on an RTX gaming laptop, with this spec including a Ryzen 5 5600H and RTX 3060 Laptop graphics card for just £730.98 when you use code CATCH20 at CCL&#x27;s web store on Ebay. That&#x27;s an exceptional price for a brand new laptop that&#x27;s still selling for £1100 at Amazon - Spring Sale or no.

I’ve been using the HyperX Cloud Alpha Wireless almost every day since putting them on our best gaming headsets list – that was in June last year, and today, it’s a solid £70 off in the UK.

                              <span>After weeks of teases and rumours, Counter-Strike 2 invaded the internet to confirm that, yes, it was a real thing and not a figment of the community&#x27;s shared imagination. It’s fully launching this summer, and Valve have been holding a limited access test since the pseudo-sequel&#x27;s announcement. They’ve been inviting select players based on factors that are important to the dev team, such as trust factor, Steam account standing, and recent playtime on Valve servers. But last night, Valve shook their finger like a stern parent, informing fans that playing more Counter-Strike: Global Offensive wouldn’t get them into the CS2 test any faster.

The offer ends at 7am PDT/ 3pm BST, so you still have over a month to grab and keep the second expansion on Steam, the PlayStation store, or any other storefront that’s participating in the promotion. Squeenix have an FAQ page for more information, too.

                              <span>The Scottish author Robert Louis Stevenson claimed that &quot;the mark of a good action is that it appears inevitable in retrospect.&quot; Had he not died in 1894, he might’ve said the same thing about the Logitech G502 Hero showing up in Amazon sales events, although maybe it wouldn’t have sounded as profound.


That’s right, the G502 Hero – beloved by RPS readers, a longtime resident in our best gaming mouse list, and precursor to an inferior new model – is once again going cheap. A predictable development, albeit an entirely welcome one. This time it’s in the Amazon Spring Sale, with a better-than-half-price discount bringing it down to £35.

This feels like that. It&#x27;s like a fake game made up by a Hollywood television  producer.&quot;
A few hours later, after numerous short cutscenes in which Michael Rooker has to shout nonsensical American Football metaphors every so often, to justify the fact that his character is called Touchdown, and Michael Madsen growls about &quot;candy&quot; in a hard-living 65-year-old&#x27;s voice coming out of an uncanny-vallyy 35-year-old&#x27;s face, I text him an update: &quot;It&#x27;s also like that tweet that goes &#x27;Bames Nond&#x27;s having a stronk, call a bondulance&#x27;.&quot;

                              <span>Tax Heaven 3000 changed its release date a couple of times, moving from a March 31st date that was suspiciously close to April Fools&#x27; Day, to April 4th after its removal from Steam, to yesterday, March 27th. For the uninitiated, Tax Heaven 3000 is the anime dating sim that claims to do your taxes and asks you for identifying info such as your email and Social Security Number. It’s likely a joke app, partly because of its waifu Iris (like, the IRS) and partly because it’s from MSCHF, the art collective behind Lil Nas X’s Satan Shoes and other viral drops.

                              <span>Good timing if you recently picked up a Steam Deck on discount, as now you could also save a few quid on one of the best microSD cards for the Valve-made handheld. Two, in fact, as the Amazon Spring Sale is currently cutting prices on the super speedy SanDisk Extreme Pro and the more budget-oriented, but still quick, SanDisk Ultra.

                              <span>Steam will no longer support Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 8.1 operating systems starting from January 1st, 2024, Valve have announced. To continue playing games or using apps through Steam, you’ll need to update to a more recent version of Windows. After that date, the Steam Client will no longer run on older versions of the Windows OS. The reason? It’s Google Chrome.

                              <span>As is so often the case in systemic turn-based tactics games, things started to go wrong in my preview session for The Lamplighters League when a nearby torch met a cunningly placed oil slick and erupted into flames. A load of enemies were instantly enveloped in its hot sea of death, as intended, but one of our heroes - the tank-like bruiser Fedir - also ended up getting burned by mistake. As an ex-mob enforcer, he&#x27;s certainly built to take a few punches, and his abilities are all focused on making him the centre of attention, his attacks growing more powerful as his rage levels continue to grow. &quot;You want him to get attacked,&quot; game director Chris Rogers tells me, calling on the phrase &#x27;you wouldn&#x27;t like him when he&#x27;s angry&#x27; as the basis for Fedir&#x27;s ability set. But with that extra fire damage he receives, it&#x27;s just a little too much all at once. He gets knocked down, and the tide of battle quickly goes south.
In truth, I played no part in this downfall. Rogers was in the control cockpit for this one, showing me exactly how Harebrained Schemes&#x27; latest game actually works. It&#x27;s quite a different proposition from their last game, Battletech, and in this quite literal trial by fire, studio head and co-founder Mitch Gitelman actually pulled a dollar out of his pocket at one point and put a bet on whether Rogers would make it out alive. He certainly had his work cut out for him. Rogers won that dollar, and here&#x27;s how the game&#x27;s emphasis on deep, customisable character builds set him up for success.

                              <span>Rejoice, fellow Nintendoers! Dolphin Emulator - the open-source emulator for Nintendo GameCube and Wii games - is coming to Steam in Q2 2023. The Steam page is quick to note, for probably legal reasons, that “this app does not come with games” and “you must own an original copy of any game” you want to emulate. Dolphin allows you to emulate retro games with 4k support, modern controllers, and it’s totally free.

Two seasons deep, the studio say they’re taking MultiVersus offline because it’s been in Open Beta this whole time (I know, shocker), so an extended break will give them time to prepare for their proper launch.

The book’s publisher Knobf Doubleday have now issued a statement refusing to credit Romero since “the only games listed in the author’s acknowledgements are video games.”

Yacht Club Games has been the &quot;Shovel Knight studio&quot; for a long time. Since the blue knight first took up the spade, the studio has made and published many spin-offs. With Mina the Hollower, it&#x27;s trying something different. And a change of scenery feels like it&#x27;s ignited a spark for Yacht Club.
Rather than the themed side-scrolling platforming of Shovel Knight, Mina the Hollower takes directly after Game Boy treasures like The Legend of Zelda: Link&#x27;s Awakening or the Oracle games. This was an overt direction Yacht Club went for, as a &quot;love letter&quot; to the Game Boy Color, as lead artist Sandy Gordon describes it.
&quot;So after doing Shovel Knight, we knew we wanted to do something different,&quot; Gordon said. &quot;And we also knew that we wanted to do something that hit similar nos…</span>

                              <span>Welcome to the final days of Samurott
In case you haven’t heard, Samurott is joining the roster of Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet via a 7-Star Tera Raid Battle event. This event will run from March 31 to April 2, and it will repeat the following weekend from April 7 to April 9.
One of the most challenging aspects of 7-Star raids is sheer unpredictability. The moveset of any Pokemon can completely change which monster will counter it best, so it’s almost impossible to prepare for an event before it goes live. For example, Samurott is a Water-Type Pokemon with a Bug Tera Type, which means Flying-Type Pokemon should be the best counters. However, if Samurott knows an Ice-Type move, the best Pokemon may be Walking Wake with Flamethrower or a Skill Link Cloyster with Rock Blast.

Splatoon 3 is keeping up the same cute marketing campaign as it has in the past: adding &quot;SplatNet&quot; rewards that require scanning in a QR code. This one, released in late March 2023, involves a &quot;Boston-themed banner.&quot; No, it&#x27;s not a Dunkin Donuts/Ben Affleck promo. But there is a lobster (lobstah?) involved.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;aNdesjIP2AA&amp;t&#x3D;7079s
Said banner is Boston-themed because of the recent Splatoon 3 tournament sponsored by Nintendo: which was held at PAX East this past weekend in Boston, Massachusetts. Team Starburst beat out team Destiny Bond with a sweep, becoming the winners of the 2023 Splatoon 3 North American Championship. Hey look, it&#x27;s a free gift! Take it or leave it.
Scan this QR code for the Splatoon 3 Boston reward:
[caption id&#x3D;&quot;attachment_371169&quot; align&#x3D;&quot;alignnone&quot; width&#x3D;&quot;512&quot;] Image via Nintendo[/caption]
First off, you can’t just scan the QR code with your camera app on your phone. You’ll need to go download the Nintendo Switch Online app on either iOS or Android.
Once you have the app, load it up, log into your Nintendo Switch Online account, and look for the Splatoon 3 icon at the top. That’s actually “Splatnet 3,” and it’s the app-within-the-app that you’ll need to use to scan the below codes.
After Splatnet 3 loads, scroll to the bottom and look for the “QR Code Reader” icon.
Select “use your smartphone’s camera to scan a QR code” to directly scan codes from this article, or select “scan a QR code from a saved image” (you may need to give your app access to your phone’s camera or image collection).
That’s it! The code will then redeem and you’ll be able to pick the reward up from the in-game terminal. Depending on the size of the code you may need to move your camera around a bit.

                              <span>You can redeem this one in addition to the last one
This week, Nintendo of Europe tweeted out that it&#x27;s going to be extending the week long Switch Online trial period.  The reward is available until April 2 at 7PM ET, and will work even if you already redeemed the one available last week.
Here&#x27;s the full breakdown of all the stuff you can actually do:
&quot;During the free trial, you can use the online play, voice chat via the smartphone app, Save Data Cloud, Nintendo Entertainment System™ - Nintendo Switch Online, Super Nintendo Entertainment System™ - Nintendo Switch Online and Game Boy™ - Nintendo Switch Online services. It’s not possible to purchase classic controllers during the trial period.&quot;

You can find the reward on My Nintendo directly here. The US doesn&#x27;t seem to be part of this particular promotion, but there is an existing seven day trial promo currently available in the US.
Note that this isn&#x27;t a trial for the Expansion Pack, which recently got some more bonuses under its belt in the portable category. Is the &quot;Expansion&quot; aspect of that pricier tier finally up to snuff given the increase? Well, you be the judge of that (I&#x27;d take some more stuff!).

Might as well start unpacking your bags; IGN is reporting that Sega and Tencent have confirmed to them that they are going to be skipping E3 2023. At this point, the list of companies not attending outsizes the ones who have confirmed they are.
While the two biggest takeaways from IGN’s article is that Sega and Tencent won’t be on the floor, they also received word that Devolver Digital isn’t attending in any capacity. While the publisher would often set up shop in the parking lot as an unofficial demonstration, this year, they’re not even planning that. There will be a Devolver Direct in June, however.
It’s not looking good for E3, which was already facing an uphill battle in re-establishing itself after the COVID pandemic. While video game conventions and shows are still widespread, E3 has long been held as a sort of video game Christmas that all gamers look forward to. Big game and hardware announcements were withheld for this time of year.
The expo’s battle for relevancy won’t end this year. IGN reached out to numerous publishers to get a response on whether they’ll be attending and got mostly radio silence. While that doesn’t mean they definitely won’t be there, in a normal year, most companies would have announced their intentions already.
I have mixed feelings about this, but mainly I’m rooting for E3. It’s been running since I was a kid, and I remember getting excited for it and watching video game news. It’s different now that the internet has changed the speed at which we can hear of new events, so maybe this is the unavoidable future, but I’m going to miss that hype-based burst of dopamine.

I hope you weren’t too attached to that Aero interface, because Valve has announced that its Steam client will no longer support Windows 7, 8, or 8.1 starting on January 1, 2024.
In a support article, Valve states that “The newest features in Steam rely on an embedded version of Google Chrome, which no longer functions on older versions of Windows. In addition, future versions of Steam will require Windows feature and security updates only present in Windows 10 and above.”
While this specifically impacts the Steam client, it also means that you won’t be able to launch games from it. It’s not clear if you can stick with an older version and turn updates off, but Valve is suggesting it’s time to upgrade.
Maybe that’s true. Personally, I think Windows 7 was a great step up from Windows XP. Everything that followed has been a bigger and bigger mess that I mostly tolerate and hope that nothing breaks. I worked in I.T. during the transition from XP to 7 (we’ll pretend Vista never happened, the business world certainly did). When 8 came along, it was horrible for businesses, and Microsoft basically had to strongarm companies to move off of Windows 7 by ending support for it. Windows 10 isn’t bad, I guess. Windows 11… works.
In any case, if you want to keep using Steam, you’ll want to consider letting go of those better days and get back on the Operating System treadmill. Support ends for good on January 1, 2024.

We live in arguably the greatest era of gaming controllers. And while I’m sure younger generations will take it all for granted, those of us who’ve been gaming for a few decades know it’s been a long road to get to where we are today. The Switch Pro controller, Xbox Series X|S controller, and PlayStation Dual Sense controller are the best controllers we’ve seen from console manufacturers, both in terms of comfort and usability. And you know that’s the case because basically every third-party controller manufacturer these days is producing devices that more or less look exactly like what you can get from Nintendo, Microsoft, and Sony.
But that hasn’t always been the case. For many years, back when gaming was still thought of as a “kids&#x27; thing,” manufac…</span>

                              <span>Beating the end of conflict into faces
Bandai Namco has dropped their latest character trailer for Tekken 8. This one focuses on Jun Kazama, as she complains about violence while unloading on her family.
Jun Kazama was featured in Tekken 2 and the non-canon Tag Tournament games. She went missing at the beginning of Tekken 3’s narrative, so her return has been a long time coming. She’s the mother of Jin Kazuma, who she had with Kazuya Mishima.
She shows up in some flowing silks which, like the wardrobe of some other characters, seem far too nice to actually fight in. She seems to be some sort of Disney Princess, as nature just loves her, though that might be to highlight her peaceful nature. Despite her disgust with conflict, she’s depicted as showing no hesitation in beating the stuffing out of her son.

With Jun Kazama, Bandai Namco has given a highlight trailer for all announced characters, including the previous ones: Jin Kazama, Marshall Law, Nina Williams, King, Paul Phoenix, Jack-8, Lars Alexandersson, and Kazuya Mishima. Will they announce others? Maybe. We’re still a year out from its targeted launch window.
Tekken 8 is currently in development for PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X. It is tentatively expected to launch late in 2023 or early 2024.

The creaking of the boards, the screams of the infected, and the winces of the rats beneath your feet all add to the Resident Evil 4 remake experience: I&#x27;m spooked and intrigued at the same time! The Resident Evil 4 sound design is immaculate and stands just as tall as the impressive graphics on display.
That&#x27;s thanks in part to the sound designers from Resident Evil 4 remake. Here&#x27;s why.

The past two weekends saw Activision Blizzard roll out twin betas for its upcoming hellfest, Diablo IV. Pre-order customers were given the opportunity to revisit Sanctuary on the weekend of March 17, while everybody was invited to Hell and back on the weekend of March 24. These betas would offer die-hard fans of the BIG DEEEEEE their first look at the dungeon-crawling epic.
Well, at least they were if they were able to get through the door... Online games, same old story, y&#x27;know?

I, legitimately, put well over 1000 hours into Diablo III. This was made possible thanks to the encouragement of a dear friend and longtime franchise fan, as well as the simple fact that I really didn&#x27;t have all that much to do in 2012. The point is, I really ate up the divisiv…</span>

Ubisoft has locked in its plans for a summer Ubisoft Forward stream, happening around the same time as E3. But as the company confirmed yesterday, that won&#x27;t be a part of E3 2023.
Posted in a new blog update today, Ubisoft will air its new Forward on June 12 at 10 a.m. PT. The show is set to host the &quot;latest game updates, news, and reveals&quot; both live and in-person from Los Angeles. More details, like the line-up and where to watch, will be on the way. This date puts it directly adjacent to E3 2023, which runs from June 13 through 16.

Curve Digital has announced that they’re helping assemble Kitbash Model Club, a game by Floating Origin Interactive and helmed by Kerbal Space Program lead developer Felipe Falanghe. Previously known as Balsa Model Flight Simulator, Kitbash Model Club is a game about designing and testing out various types of vehicular models.
The trailer that dropped alongside the announcement shows off the various types of models you’ll be making, as well as some of the modes and the design suite. You can definitely see the Kerbal DNA in Kitbash Model Club, as it seems to focus on experimentation. Once you’ve got a built model, you take it out into Wirraway to test them out. While not much is shown in the way of gameplay objectives, it does demonstrate the RC dogfighting, which allows you to “challenge friends.”
https://youtu.be/jU1aYokrbDA
I’m liking what I see, and I absolutely love Kerbal, but I feel like I need to see more of what I’m actually going to be doing with these models before I can really get excited. Creation for the sake of creation is something I can already do in so many games, so I’m more interested in what these abominations of model design will be doing.
Fortunately, the store page lists a full career with “paintball combat missions, races, and maneuverability challenges.” There’s also going to be a scenario editor where you can create your missions and share them out. Neat.
Kitbash Model Club is initially eying up a PC release and is aiming to be out sometime in 2023.

Before the PSVR 2&#x27;s launch, there was some apprehension surrounding whether the headset would have enough content to keep gamers busy, especially because it lacks backward compatibility with the original PSVR. Sony&#x27;s new headset proved that all the worrying was worthless, however, as the launch line-up has been nothing short of explosive. Titles like Horizon Call of the Mountain and Kayak VR: Mirage demonstrate the graphical power of the new headset, while games like No Man&#x27;s Sky and Gran Turismo 7 bring the AAA gaming experience to the world of Virtual Reality.
Thanks to the increased immersion that the platform brings, horror thrives in virtual reality. Already, there is an assortment of titles available that provide plenty of heart-stopping moments and stom…</span>

Nintendo gave us a rather deep look into the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom today, and it has answered a question that has been burning in the mind of players since its announcement: Are there still breakable weapons? Are weapons still made of porcelain?
Yes. Yes they are.
Early on in the gameplay footage, Link is depicted battling it out with a construct using a tree branch. It doesn’t take long before that branch shifts into a “badly damaged” before breaking entirely. Considering this is essentially how weapon degradation worked in Breath of the Wild, it’s safe to assume that this is how it will be for anything you can swing.

Nintendo has shared more gameplay today of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, showcasing Link&#x27;s new abilities in a new and changing Hyrule. Among all the new features, there were a few that seemed to open up a wealth of creative options for future adventurers of Hyrule.
The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild was already a font for player ingenuity. Alongside all the Stasis hijinks players could get up to, there were also items like the Octo Balloons which could let players create flying contraptions. With Tears of the Kingdom, Nintendo seems to be leaning even further into that.
Fuse, in essence, allows Link to pair any two items together. Today&#x27;s gameplay spotlight started off simple, attaching a rock to a stick to make a club. Easy, right? Well, it escal…</span>

                              <span>It was inevitable
Thanks to today&#x27;s The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom presentation, we can confirm the game has finished development. We have a couple months until release, but anyone looking for a Switch upgrade before then has a tantalizing prospect.
A special edition Tears of the Kingdom OLED Switch will launch on April 28, 2023. Sporting gold colors that have long been synonymous with the franchise, this is looking like a treat for Zelda collectors. Even the dock sports a vibrant display that will look great when you aren&#x27;t playing in handheld mode. Remember, the system itself is otherwise identical to the regular OLED Nintendo Switch. If you&#x27;re not interested in the aesthetics or already own an OLED Switch, this won&#x27;t do too much for you.

But wait, there&#x27;s more!
Additionally, a corresponding Switch Pro Controller and carrying case will be available on May 12, the same date that the game itself will launch. These will run you $74.99 and $24.99 respectively, roughly $5 more than each peripheral&#x27;s standard counterparts. Again, for Zelda fans and collectors, these are perfectly fair deals. I can&#x27;t tell anyone else if a couple Triforces are worth $10, but I also buy video games I never actually play, so I&#x27;m not a reliable source for monetary advice.
Even if a Tears of the Kingdom OLED Switch is no surprise, it&#x27;s nice to see it officially announced. Nintendo says the special edition system and accompanying accessories are available to pre-order (potentially today), but no listings seem to be up following the broadcast. Keep your eyes peeled if these interest you, as other Tears of the Kingdom collectibles have already sold out at many retailers.

In IFPI&#x27;s latest Global Music Report, insiders stress that music&#x27;s &#x27;human&#x27; element should stay at the forefront. According to Sony, the same applies to AI-synthesized voices, which should not replace human vocals.

After literal years of waiting, we have finally had a look at some extended gameplay for The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, introduced by legendary series producer Eiji Aonuma no less.
Unlike the trailers that we have seen over the past few months, this was all about some of the new features that we can expect to come across in the Breath of the Wild sequel. This is a Hyrule that will look familiar, it is true, but it certainly seems like there have been a number of changes between the two Switch titles.

                              <span>Whiffs and Dingers.
For the second year running, SIE San Diego&#x27;s MLB The Show franchise lands on Nintendo Switch and, this time around, history takes centre stage with a new Storylines mode giving players the opportunity to learn about some of the all-time great baseballers from the Negro Leagues. It’s undoubtedly the highlight of an outing that underwhelms in places and suffers from a few Switch-specific performance issues here and there. But, when all’s said and done MLB The Show 23 still manages to serve up a decent overall package.
Let&#x27;s start with where this one is most lacking, and MLB The Show 23 once again fails to address a few issues that have been fairly long-standing with the game at this point. Both its Franchise and Road to the Show modes do little to make themselves stand out over previous entries, continuing to take a firm back seat to the centrepiece Diamond Dynasty. That’s not to say getting involved with either of these is a total let-down — they’re still perfectly fine — they just feel a little flat and uninvolved in terms of presentation and there are few reasons to stick with them compared to Diamond Dynasty and the new Storylines offering.

In today&#x27;s The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom gameplay trailer, we found out that yes, Link can indeed build vehicles. And he does this using the brand new ability &#x27;Ultrahand&#x27;.
Now, if you&#x27;ve been around these parts for a while, then you probably spotted this name and went &quot;wait, what, Ultra Hand? Like the 1960s toy?&quot; And we&#x27;re pretty sure that&#x27;s what this big gameplay feature is referencing. The toy was created in 1966 by Gunpei Yokoi, who played a pretty major role in video game development, as he designed the D-pad, Game Boy, and WonderSwan.

                              <span>A new character trailer for Tekken 8 showcases the action of the returning Jun Kazama. Jin’s long-lost mother is making her first playable appearance in a mainline entry since Tekken 2, and based on a new gameplay trailer, she hasn’t lost a step.
A gameplay trailer shows off Jun’s expert use of Kazama-style martial arts to cleanse opponents of their evils. That translates to beating the snot out of them if that wasn’t obvious. We also see a brief reunion between Jun and her former lover, Kazuya, and it goes about as well as you would expect from a mother meeting the father and repeat attempted killer of their son. 


For those keeping count, here’s the list of confirmed fighters thus far:
Jack-8
Jin Kazama
Kazuya Mishima
King
Lars Alexandersson
Marshall Law
Nina Williams
Paul Phoenix
Tekken 8 still doesn’t have a release date, but it’s coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</span>

If you’re in the market for a new OLED model, this Zelda variant launches on April 28, a couple of weeks before the game arrives. It retails at $359.99 and features a Switch dock and Joy-Cons adorned with Hyrulian designs.

                              <span>Development on The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is now complete.
The Legend of Zelda series producer, Eiji Aonuma, revealed this during today&#x27;s Tears of the Kingdom gameplay showcase. He then jumped directly into the game, showing off more than 10 minutes of new gameplay. Aonuma begins this demonstration by showing how Link can get up to the Sky Islands floating above Hyrule. He uses the &quot;Recall&quot; power, which rewinds an object&#x27;s movement, to reverse a fallen rock&#x27;s descent. He&#x27;s able to reach one of the floating sky islands using this new power. 
After fighting an enemy up here, we learn that weapon durability, a hotly debated feature of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, is back. But now, you can use Link&#x27;s new &quot;Fuse&quot; ability to create brand-new weapons. Aonuma showed us ho…</span>

                              <span>E3 2023 has taken another hit, as Ubisoft has confirmed it will not have a presence at the show. In a statement to Video Games Chronicle, the publisher reveals that it will instead hold its own live presentation on June 12 in Los Angeles. 
The publisher statement to VGC reads “While we initially intended to have an official E3 presence, we’ve made the subsequent decision to move in a different direction, and will be holding a Ubisoft Forward Live event on 12th June in Los Angeles. We look forward to sharing more details with our players very soon.”
Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot stated in February that the company would commit to attending “if E3 happens”. If that&#x27;s the case, this news certainly doesn’t bode well for the fate of what’s supposed to be E3’s big return. 
As for what Ubisoft could show at its event, Assassin’s Creed Mirage, The Crew Motorfest, and (maybe) Skull and Bones are slated to release this year. Other announced projects include the long-quiet Splinter Cell and Prince of Persia remakes, a multitude of new Assassin’s Creed games, and Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora. A rumored follow-up to Immortals Fenyx Rising could also make an appearance.  
Ubisoft joins Nintendo on the list of major publishers that have declined to participate in this year’s show, following a previous report that Microsoft and Sony plan to follow suit. E3 is largely organized by ReedPop this year and will take place June 13-16 at the Los Angeles Convention Center. The event will open its doors to fans and press, with separate attendance days for each. It will be the first in-person event since 2019.

The game’s online modes will later become unplayable as developer Player First Games plans for a relaunch early next year. 
In a developer blog post, Player First Games CEO Tony Huynh explains that since MultiVersus launched in open beta (yes, open beta) last July, players have offered a ton of feedback. The studio feels that the only way to properly implement improvements based on these fan requests is to shut the game down temporarily. Huynh writes,

                              <span>December 25, 2013, was the day I finally got my hands on a Wii U. It was a special edition that came with a code for Wind Waker HD and a gamepad emblazoned with a golden Triforce. For my brother and I, 11 and 13 at the time, respectively, this was a massive deal; we’d spent the last year seeing Wii Us at friends’ houses, yearning for our own, and struggling to explain the difference between it and our current Wii to our parents.
But while it was valuable to us, the Wii U struggled to sell and has ultimately gone down as one of Nintendo’s most disappointing consoles. Today, the system’s eShop shuts down forever, permanently closing a chapter of Nintendo’s history.
I’ll be the first to admit that the rosy lenses of nostalgia heavily tint my memory of the Wii U. It was a formative time in my …</span>

To watch the video when it premieres tomorrow on YouTube, just click the Link below:
Despite the fact that we&#x27;ve gotten multiple trailers over the past few months, Nintendo has yet to reveal any clip of gameplay longer than a few seconds, and every new glimpse seems to raise more questions than it answers. What are those strange vehicles? Does Link have a new paraglider? And why does the game cost $70? Whether or not tomorrow&#x27;s showcase addresses those questions, we&#x27;ll all find out when Tears of the Kingdom releases on May 12.
We&#x27;ll be live streaming our reactions to the 10 minutes showcase on Game Informer&#x27;s Twitch channel.</span>

                              <span>Since some people apparently can’t go a few months without some sort of mega money-off event, here’s a guide to all the best Amazon Spring Sale deals on PC gaming hardware. This doesn’t look to be as much of a wide-ranging sale as Prime Day or Amazon’s Black Friday dealings, but there are still some decent savings to be had on plenty of RPS-approved gear, from gaming mice and keyboards to SSDs and gaming monitors.

This time it&#x27;s a massive 18TB HDD from Seagate, an Exos enterprise-grade drive, which is available for £245 when you use the CATCH20 code at CCL&#x27;s Ebay shop front.

                              <span>I like to think I have rhythm, in the same way that a wobbly air dancer lunging about sporadically has rhythm. That is to say I have none at all, and that any time spent dancing turns me into an uncontrollable set of limbs flailing in the wrong directions. Think Octodad in a night club and you’d be on the right track (although the disastrous limb flailing is enough to keep me out of the clubs).
That lack of rhythm isn’t just native to the dance floor of an awkward family party, though. Even nuzzled into my chair with a controller in hand, I simply can’t stick to the beat. My eyes glued to notes floating across the screen, trying to hit them at just the right time, you’d probably see Time hiding in a corner to my left, giggling at my repeated failure. A barrage of borked bleeps and bungled notes tend to leave me with spirits sunk.
In Hi-Fi Rush, though, I always leave with my head held high.

                              <span>A long time ago (in 2013, in fact) in a student-y house far away (assuming that you don&#x27;t live too near to Nottingham), I started playing the BioShock series. I&#x27;d flirted with the idea for years, but it was the release of BioShock Infinite that finally convinced me to take the plunge. And I can&#x27;t exactly complain: the series&#x27; Rapture arc — made up of the first and second games, plus the prequel novel by none other than John &quot;The Crow&quot; Shirley — now makes up maybe 10% of my personality, having given me two of my favourite video games, my favourite video game tie-in book, and a front-running contender for my favourite video game locale all at once.
I just wish that, after all that prep I did for it, I&#x27;d actually liked BioShock Infinite a bit more.

                              <span>It has been said (by me) that a lot of games journalists are generalists in terms of what we play, especially if we&#x27;re talking about people who are staffers at an outlet, or have ever worked in guides. Though we all have stuff we prefer, or series that we serve as the go-to expert on for in-house needs (I think vid bud Liam might actually walk around wearing an ASK ME ABOUT RESIDENT EVIL badge in his day-to-day life), we - unlike the blue-haired neo-Gods of streaming - often can&#x27;t focus on one game all of the time. You have to know enough about enough to be able to write about enough.
There are, however, a bunch of big important games that I haven&#x27;t played. Sometimes it&#x27;s because a bunch of other people have, so that gap in the site&#x27;s knowledge is already plugged (and I do always make sure to be aware of their impact and basic facts). Other times, they might be games that I&#x27;m not really interested in playing, either because they&#x27;re not my genre or they seem too overwrought. Or, in some cases, it&#x27;s because everyone says they&#x27;re really good and I have to try them, though I&#x27;ve been burned before on this method (you people said the same about Ready Player One). But you know what would make me take in info about these games, even if it&#x27;s just by osmosis? If they all got PowerWash Sim DLCs.

Happily, the open world detective sim is now sneaking into an early access release next month, on April 24th.

When it all comes together and you can look over the fruits of your labour, birds chirping and piano melodically playing in the background, it’s beautiful. Getting to that point, though, is an often repetitive experience marred with frustration.

                              <span>Slay The Spire has remained an incredibly popular deckbuilding roguelike, so it naturally invited a healthy modding community that added fun stuff to the game - goofy googley eyes included. One of Slay The Spire’s most popular mods was called Downfall, a huge fan-made expansion that added tons of playable characters, a new mode, and more. Those developers - Table 9 Studio - are now back with their own not-modded game: an auto-battling, fantasy Chess roguelike called Tales &amp; Tactics.

                              <span>Rod Humble has his son to thank for his upcoming life sim Life By You. After finishing up work on two successful mobile games around four years ago, Humble was itching for something new. But he wasn&#x27;t quite sure what. &quot;I was in the kitchen talking to my son about, &#x27;Oh, what should I do? I don&#x27;t know what opportunities there are,&#x27; and he was like, &#x27;Why don&#x27;t you just pick the company you want to work at and ask them?&#x27;&quot; And as a life-long Crusader Kings player, the answer was clear. &quot;Okay!?&quot; Humble says incredulously. &quot;I can do that, I guess. So I did. I wrote to [PR manager] Troy [Goodfellow], and he knew Fred [Wester, CEO], and that was it. It was two weeks later and I met him in San Francisco and said, hey, I&#x27;d like to start a studio, and here&#x27;s the way I&#x27;d like to run it. And he was like, sure, let&#x27;s go for it.&quot;
So began Humble&#x27;s journey to creating Life By You, his upcoming life simulator that&#x27;s set to give his former pet project, The Sims, a run for its money. With The Sims 5, or Project Rene as it&#x27;s currently known, still some way off, Life By You seems poised to finally give life sim fans the game they&#x27;ve always wanted. &quot;I wanted to make an open world life simulator where the core tenant was freedom,&quot; says Humble. &quot;Where players could freely play and tell their stories with minimal friction.&quot; And what was standing in the way of that freedom? Loading screens, says Humble.

                              <span>I keep alternating between wanting to play more and feeling weary at the prospect. While that might sound bad, it arguably means that it&#x27;s balanced an appealing strategic challenge with the grinding theme of trench warfare.
The Great War Colon Western Front is about taking the Triple Alliance or Entente through the hell years of 1914-18, or beyond. It&#x27;s a purely military game about overcoming massed defences through attrition, both in localised real-time battles, and a turn-based strategic map. It&#x27;s perhaps unfair to criticise it for repetition and some intermittent sense of futility, since a First World War game without them would defeat the point. But I still feel a little mixed.

During a chat with Paradox Tectonic&#x27;s general manager Rod Humble at this year&#x27;s GDC, I spoke to him about whether there was any plan to accommodate lower-end PC specifications when Life By You enters early access this September, and he answered by urging players to take its minimum PC specifications &quot;seriously&quot;.

Alice0 enjoyed its alpha playtest last December, and it ended up becoming one of the most popular games of February&#x27;s Steam Next Fest. It wasn&#x27;t due to launch in full until sometime this winter, but that window&#x27;s now up in the air after Dark And Darker was removed from Steam over the weekend, following a messy legal dispute between Nexon and developers Ironmace, who have been accused of “using trade secrets and copyrighted information,” allegedly stolen from Nexon.

The mention of “Left4Dead3” was recently spotted in CS2’s files (thanks, Reddit) which sparked online speculation for a third game in the series. The files state that the “severity” is “high”, the “version” is “2”, but what about the “priority?” Bad news for fans of the run-and-gunning zombie shooter: according to the files, the priority is “none.”

                              <span>Počet DDoS útoků na české firmy v únoru sice klesl, zvýšila se ale intenzita jednotlivých útoků. Po několika měsících se totiž opět objevily útoky s intenzitou vyšší než 150 Gbps. U průměrného útoku je přitom tato hodnota přibližně desetkrát menší. Zároveň již druhý měsíc po sobě nejvíce útoků míří z Ruska. Stále pak platí trend, že útočníci napadající servery provozující služby či internetové stránky více hledají úplně nové cesty svých DDoS útoků a prodlužují dobu jejich trvání.</span>

                              <span>Imagine for a moment, if you will, that Persona 5 let you suplex your opponents. Even better, imagine if those moves were pulled off through timing based minigames that resembled the battles found in Nintendo&#x27;s excellent (and underrated) Mario &amp; Luigi RPG series. Sounds good, right? Well guess what, that game exists! It&#x27;s called Wrestle Story and it&#x27;s definitely a project to keep an eye on.


After spending twenty glorious minutes with its colourful demo at PAX East, I was keen to chat to creative director Steve Jimenez about the team&#x27;s inspirations, the challenges of translating wrestling into a turn-based RPG and the  exciting locations that players will attempt to liberate from a group of devious heels.

                              <span>Earlier in the week, Liam and I had the opportunity to chat with Animal Well&#x27;s solo developer and publisher Bigmode about creating their eerie subterranean world. We then had a chance to go hands on with the PAX East demo, and wow, we were both incredibly impressed. Watch the video below for our enthusiastic impressions:
If we could give an RPS &#x27;Bestest Best in show&#x27; award to a game, is would be Animal Well. Liam and I loved the game&#x27;s dense atmosphere, spider-web of interconnected caverns, and creepy creatures that lurk in the dark. We also loves the effects the game has, which reminded Liam of Octopath Traveler&#x27;s visual flairs. If I had to compare it to one game, it would be Hollow Knight, which is very exciting.
We have plenty more PAX East indies for you to check out so make sure you have a peruse through our RPS@PAX tag. A couple of our favourites have been chaotic rouguelite Pizza Possum, Resident Evil-like Alone In The Dark, and island exploration game Mythwrecked.

                              <span>Show me a game about a feral, furry creature with a never ending hunger for junk food and I&#x27;m immediately interested. I played Pizza Possum on the first day of PAX and knew it would make a great indie highlight for our time here at PAX East. Liam and I have now both played the demo and you can listen to our impressions in the video below:
What really appealed to us about Pizza Possum is how chaotic it is. It&#x27;s like Untitled Goose Game but at double the speed. Playing the eponymous possum, you need you scamper around a sunny Mediterranean town scoffing as much food as you can get your grubby mitts on.
There&#x27;s an element of hide-and-seek too, as there are patrol dogs who will try and stop your food eating rampage, but you can quickly jump into a berry bush to thorw them off your scent. It&#x27;s goofy fun, and we&#x27;re completeley smitten with it.

                              <span>Liam and I had a fun time chatting with the folks over at Mega Cat Studios about their upcoming wrestling RPG WrestleQuest last year at PAX West, and this time at PAX East we finally cornered them in the ring for a proper interview.
Watch below to learn about how the developers created their zero to hero story, how they&#x27;re addressing myths and persaonl issues in the world of pro wresting, as well as sharing a story about how one of the team got their nose broken in a wrestling accident during development.
My main take away from the interview is how much of the RPG incorporates all aspects of Wrestling, not just the ring fights we see on TV. Another interesting thing is that Mega Cat reached out to a handful of real-life wrestlers to ask their permission to use their likeness in the game - not an easy feat to secure, I&#x27;m sure.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve played a bunch of indie game demos at PAX East, but none left my head reeling as much as 43 Studios&#x27; fiendishly frantic action platfotmer Hell Of An Office. It&#x27;s a super fast parkour adventure in the vein of Neon White, and after ten minutes with the demo my heart race was through the roof. If I owned a fitbit it would have been screaming at me to have a nice sit down with a cuppa. Check out my full impressions in the video below:
Hell Of An Office puts your platforming reflexes to the test as you&#x27;re tasked with sprinting ad jumping your way straight outta hell. With only a stapler as your means of survival, you need to navigate through each level before it slowly sinks into the burning lava. React quickly, or fall victim to Hell&#x27;s scorching pools.
If you love the blood-pumping, sweaty palm inducing action-platforming of Neon White, make sure to keep an eye on Hell Of An Office as it makes it&#x27;s way through Early Access.

                              <span>Have A Nice Death&#x27;s dark art and quick-slashing combat bring Hollow Knight to mind, but it has more in common with Hades and Dead Cells. One of the things it has in common with those games is that it was released in early access. After a little more than a year, version 1.0 arrived this week, bringing a final area, a new boss, and the end of its storyline.

                              <span>Go-Go Town! has more than a little Animal Crossing about it, as players become mayor of a cutesy fixer-upper town and start doing oddjobs to attract new visitors and inhabitants. It differs in several key ways too, thankfully, from its more urban setting, its tactile power tools, and the ability to automate a lot of the gathering and crafting by putting residents to work for you. Watch the reveal trailer below.

Ten už v roce 1965 předpověděl, že počet tranzistorů, které mohou být umístěny na integrovaný obvod, se při zachování stejné ceny zhruba každých 18 měsíců zdvojnásobí. Později byl odhad upraven na zdvojnásobení každé dva roky, ale toto pravidlo zůstalo platné po mnoho desetiletí.</span>

                              <span>I somehow missed the news two weeks ago that Wargroove 2 was on the way. The actual successor to a spiritual successor to Advance Wars, Wargroove 2 is another 2D turn-based strategy game, but with new factions, a new roguelike mode, and a new co-developer.

There&#x27;s also a demo available to play right now, although only until the end of the weekend.

                              <span>I really enjoyed dark fantasy adventure Roki when it first released back in 2020, and keen to see what developers Polygon Treehouse have gotten up to since, I jumped at the opportunity to play the PAX East demo for Mythwrecked: Ambrosia Island. You can watch my impressions of the demo in the video below:
In Mythwrecked you play as Alex, a backpacker who has washed up on the sun-drenched shores of Ambrosia Island. As she begins exploring, she soon realises that this island seems to be a hot spot for the gods from ancient Greek myths. Your task is to befriend each god, help them restore their memories, and find a way back to civilisation.
From playing the demo, you can see much of what made Roki fun reflected in Mythwrecked. The environments are interesting to poke around in, puzzles are breezy brain ticklers, and it has Polygon Treehouse&#x27;s sense of humour. Each Greek god has a humerous twist on their lore,  and during the demo I had a fun time chatting with Hermes, who is dressed in nothing more than a pair of skimpy white speedos and a matching white sweat band - a bold choice of attire.

It&#x27;s a 2D metriodvania where you play as a little blob trying to navigate a subtterranean labyrinth filled with creatures - some cute, some not so cute. 
To find out more about this strange puzzle platformer&#x27;s beginnings and development, we spoke to solo develeoper Billy Basso and Bigmode&#x27;s Leah Gastrow which you can view in the two videos below.

                              <span>Join us for another PAX East game highlight straight from the show floor, and this time we decided to revisit a cult horror classic: Alone In The Dark. This psychological horror is being developed by Pieces Interactive with publishing backing from THQ Nordic and is a love letter to the original game released back in the 90s.
As someone who had played the original, and RPS&#x27; Resident Evil uber fan, Liam decided to check out the demo and you can hear his impressions in the video below:
According to the devs at the THQ booth, this demo is a stand-alone prequel story that will not be in the final game, but shares the same eerie atmosphere and action that&#x27;ll be in the main game. This reimagining is set in the Gothic American south and in the main game you&#x27;ll be playing as Edward Carnby or Emily Hartwood as they navigate the monster infested Derceto Manor, the same mansion featured in the demo.

                              <span>We&#x27;ve had our eyes on Goodbye Volcano High since it appeared in Sony&#x27;s State Of Play back in February and the demo at PAX East is one of the first times that the devs have placed a game preview in the hands of eager players. I had the chance to sit down with the demo and play KO_OP&#x27;s teen dino adventure first hand. Check out the video below if you&#x27;re interested to know what I thought:
Goodbye Volcano High follows a group of teen dinos as they begin their senior year of highschool. It&#x27;s part coming-of-age visual novel part rhythm game as the group try to grapple with school while also trying to make it big as up-and-coming musicians.
I had a great time with the demo, and it looks like we won&#x27;t have to wait long for the full release at Goodbye Volcano High is launching on Steam and PlayStation on June 15th.

                              <span>It&#x27;s almost become an RPS tradition to search the show floor at PAX events and find the coolest stuff and highlight it in a video, so that&#x27;s exactly what we&#x27;ve done at PAX East. There&#x27;s a lot of cool booths, fun props, and generally weird stuff to see, so we&#x27;ve chosen our absolute favourites and have listed them in video form for your viewing pleasure.
Everything at PAX East is situated in one massive hall (instead of PAX West&#x27;s multiple floors, rooms, and buildings) so it&#x27;s nice and easy to see everything in one or two loops. It doesn&#x27;t feel cramped at all, even with Friday&#x27;s busy crowds, and the booths are as spectacular as ever.
Some of our favourites included Devolver Digital&#x27;s movie theatre-inspired booth, which has the new addition of a candle-lit shrine for Cult Of The Lamb&#x27;s upcoming free expansion Relics Of The Old Faith. We also loved Ysbryd Games&#x27; Demonschool booth which had a school desk layout and cool retro TV. Another favourite was the animated robot dinosaur (complete with rideable saddle) that we found at the Roots Of Pacha demo builds.

                              <span>“Imagine someone saying ‘We need you to make a trailer for our movie, but we&#x27;ve only got half of the sets and props ready…” says Tim Bevan de Lange, Creative Director at Realtime Nordic, a studio that makes, specifically, video game trailers. “...and we haven’t actually shot anything, so you’ll need to do that yourself. Some of the actors won&#x27;t come out of their trailers. One of them will but if you shoot him from the front you realise he&#x27;s got no eyes, but don&#x27;t show the audience that. It&#x27;s not intentional, he&#x27;s getting them fixed. Also can you film it twice, for different streaming platforms? Make a really good version for Netflix and a slightly worse looking one for Quibi.”


Every so often a game trailer comes along that makes me think, hang on, that was bloody brilliant! I bet some people made that! Most recently it was Creative Assembly’s Immortal Empires trailer. Well, I’ve been digging around and I’m happy to report that yes, although I’m the first one to just see a trailer as an algorithm trying to snatch my coin purse away like a manure-encrusted Victorian ne’er-do-well, game trailers are made by humans. They&#x27;re often humans who do it as as specific job, either in-house at a developer or as an outside agency like Realtime Nordic. Enlightened and enthralled, I asked some of them about what went into the strange space that is making the trailers for your favourite games.

                              <span>I can&#x27;t remember if I&#x27;ve already banged on about what a terrible, unhelpful term &quot;metroidvania&quot; is, so let&#x27;s skip past to say that Angel&#x27;s Gear reminds me of the one Castlevania game I&#x27;ve ever played.

It&#x27;s partly the tone: a compelling blend of gothic and biomechanical horror, with a 90s game boy goriness that&#x27;s cartoony enough to feel colourful rather than repulsive. &quot;Camp&quot; isn&#x27;t the right word, but a hint of melodrama gives the story severity without self-seriousness. I mean, within the first minute of the game, your soldier goes from a terrified Normandy-style amphibious assault on a fortified metal church to seeing their war made irrelevant when the moon explodes. The whole thing is kind of metal, to be honest.

                              <span>Everywhere (not to be confused with Everything) was a big fat question mark at last year’s Gamescom Opening Night Live. It comes from Build A Rocket Boy, the studio founded by ex-GTA boss Leslie Benzies, and despite its cryptic reveal trailer, AliceB theorised it was some kind of Robloxlike. Turns out her hunch was correct - Everywhere is a platform that allows players to create their own custom content. To show off what the tools can do, Benzies and the team unveiled MindsEye, an episodic “blockbuster” adventure available inside Everywhere. A game set inside a game, if you will.

Perhaps you’ve become a self-sufficient blueberry empire, surviving off handfuls of fruit while cannibals knock at your door. Or maybe you’ve gone full Charlie Kelly, consuming tins of cat food found around the island. If so, it’s time for a diet cleanse. Sons Of The Forest’s newest patch adds a demon boss, a new cave system, and tons of other improvements. It’s also nerfing cat food, since it was overpowered and, well, are there actually any cats in the game?

Just like the first, Sludge Life 2 is a sticky graffiti vandalism sim set inside a funky lo-fi open world. You’ll be running about, snapping pics of chain-smoking crabs, tagging graffiti spots around the city, and just generally having a super chill time, yo. Developer Terri Vellman and music producer Doseone are back behind the scenes, and if you want a taste of the slime (ew), Sludge Life 1 is free to keep until March 31st. On Steam, that is.

                              <span>To celebrate Deep Rock Galactic’s fifth anniversary, developer Ghost Ship took us back in time to the mystical land of 2018 and let us play Deep Rock Galactic Legacy, a version of the co-op shooter as it was back in 2018, before all of the updates. It was a fun, nostalgic way to let fans reminisce on the game’s infantile days. Ghost Ship had planned to remove Legacy today - March 23rd - but after fan feedback, they’ve decided to keep Legacy edition around indefinitely.

Maybe not to the battery-sipping, framerate-abundant extent of the very best Steam Deck games, but with the right settings, nu-Resi 4 can keep its burlap sacked head well above 30fps even in its most visually demanding scenes.

Still, twelve maulings, three beheadings, and one chainsaw disembowelment later, I’ve got enough of a handle on Leon S. Kennedy’s disappointing Spanish holiday to help you get the most out of the new model’s PC performance. Including a guide to its best settings, which can especially help on lower-end rigs.

                              <span>This year&#x27;s Game Developers Choice and IGF Award ceremonies were really heartening stuff. Getting to see so many great developers have their games celebrated by their peers will always warm the old cockles, especially when we celebrated so many of them in our own RPS Advent Calendar at the end of last year. Well, I say &#x27;see&#x27;. In truth, I was tucked away backstage at this year&#x27;s IGF and GDC Awards, clutching my dictaphone with a single question in mind: if each winner had to give away their award to another game in their category, who would it be and why?   
It&#x27;s an idea Brendan (RPS in peace) came up with back in the primordial mists of 2018, and it was so good I just had to knick it and do it again. It might be cruel to wrench these awards away so soon after receiving them, but it&#x27;s all in the name of spreading good vibes and extra shoutouts, I promise. So here are the games of the year 2022, according to the people who just won awards for games of the year 2022.

                              <span>It&#x27;s day one of PAX East and what better way to kick off our show coverage than highlighting a great indie game! We first came across Demonschool back at PAX West last year and have loved it ever since. It&#x27;s a slick, tactical Persona-like where you play as a band of university students navigating school life by day and beating up ghosties and ghoulies by night.
I had a chat with Demonschool&#x27;s Jenna Stoeber who talked me through what Demonschool is about, the game&#x27;s many horror inspirations, and what spooky shinanigans players can expect. If the giant skeleton lad in the game&#x27;s trailer and demo is anything to go by, we&#x27;re in for a treat. You can watch the full interview by watching the video below:

If you&#x27;ve haven&#x27;t yet, set your peepers on Demonschool&#x27;s slick trailer to see what demon hunter Faye and her gang of misfits are up against. There&#x27;s no concrete release date, but like Jenna said, Demonschool should be out sometime in 2023 with a playable demo available in May.
We&#x27;ve got plenty more interviews, demos, and highlights lined up for the rest of the week and you can find all our PAX East coverage by checking out our RPS@PAX tag.

Whereas Relic&#x27;s recently released Company Of Heroes 3 will let you pick from its four broad faction types in its WWII RTS battles, Men Of War 2 takes a much more granular view, offering up 14-15 different unit types for each of its three playable nations. That&#x27;s a dizzying array of infantry, tank and artillery battalions to choose from, and that&#x27;s before you account for all the individual nuances between its Soviet, USA and German army types. Throw in seven game modes across several different maps, and it&#x27;s a veritable strategy smorgasbord to stuff your face into. 
Crucially, though, everyone gets access to some sort of tank, which let&#x27;s face it, is always going to be the MVP of any WW2 strategy game, and probably the sole reason why we&#x27;re here in the first place. As Men Of War 2 heads into its first open multiplayer tech test on Steam today (running until March 27th), here&#x27;s my full report of my mildly doomed multiplayer tankventures in its Combat, Front Line and Incursion modes.

                              <span>One of Sea of Star’s most compelling selling points is the involvement of Chrono Trigger composer Yasunori Mitsuda. To know that a game heavily inspired by Chrono Trigger will feature music from the man behind its score is exciting. Still, it is worth being excited for the soundtrack that Mitsuda will not be directly involved with, as well.
The majority of Sea of Stars’ soundtrack is in the hands of the talented Eric W. Brown, who also composed the soundtrack for The Messenger. Brown’s musical history started with playing drums in metal bands. “I&#x27;ve been a drummer since I was a kid and I&#x27;m still a drummer now, but, you know, I got into music production via chiptune essentially,” Brown says.  Around 2006 he decided to focus on making music on his own in the chiptune genre, primarily on Game…</span>

Tento problém byl v Coreutils již od verze 6.0, tedy od roku 2006. Nově také rm se lépe ukončí, pokud dojde k vyčerpání paměti.</span>

The developer took action after the Motion Picture Association targeted the open-source Android app in a complaint filed at GitHub. The MPA hasn&#x27;t contacted the developer directly but the Hollywood group considers Cloudstream a prime enforcement target.

                              <span>A video game based on the hit Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles graphic novel The Last Ronin is in the works, Polygon reports.
The news comes from Polygon&#x27;s interview with Doug Rosen, senior vice president for games and emerging media at Paramount Global. According to Rosen, The Last Ronin video game will be a single-player action role-playing title in the vein of the Norse-themed God of War series. Like the story it adapts, the game will feature a mature tone. The game’s developer has not been named, and the project is years away from release. 
The Last Ronin was published in 2020 as a five-issue mini-series by IDW. It takes place in a dark futuristic New York, where three of the four turtles have been killed. The surviving turtle, whose identity is revealed at the end of the first issue (we won’t spoil it), dons a black mask and seeks revenge by fighting crime using both his and the weapons of his fallen brothers. 
It’s a cool (and very grim) story if you haven’t read it, and we’re excited to see it translated into a game. Rosen also mentions in the same interview that Paramount sees opportunities to create different types of TMNT games that target young and adult audiences. 
The Turtles are enjoying quite the renaissance lately thanks to the launch of the well-received beat ‘em up Shredder’s Revenge last year, the nostalgia trip of the Cowabunga Collection, a Shredder-themed Call of Duty pack, and even a new animated film coming to theaters this August.

                              <span>Daedalic Entertainment revealed The Lord of the Rings: Gollum way back in 2019, announcing that it would be released in 2021. In 2021, however, it was delayed to 2022. In May of last year, Daedalic revealed Gollum would release in September but then, in July, announced it had been delayed once more. Now, today, Daedalic has revealed that Gollum will finally be released this May. 
More specifically, Gollum will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on May 25. There will be a Switch version of the game, but Daedalic says it&#x27;s planned for later this year. Alongside today&#x27;s news, Daedalic has released a new story trailer. Check it out below: 


&quot;The Lord of the Rings: Gollum is a story-driven action adventure,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;Embark on a perilous journey as Gollum, chasing the only thing that is precious to you. Climb, leap, and sneak your way past dangers or into advantageous spots. Gollum is skillful and sly, and torn by a split personality. It is up to you to decide whether to yield to the darker side of Gollum or trust the kinder gentler hint of Sméagol.&quot; 
Check out some new screenshots from the game below:

                              <span>Arkane Studios, best known for creating the acclaimed stealth series Dishonored, has made a name for itself by realizing game worlds with rich lore, environmental storytelling, and curious, interweaving levels. Its specialty is developing immersive sims, a niche it’s helped cultivate since 1999. On May 2, Arkane releases its next project, Redfall, an open-world first-person shooter.
I’ve been a fan of Arkane Studios’ rich single-player worlds for years. Naturally, I had questions about Redfall’s position in the developer’s portfolio. However, after interviewing Studio Head Harvey Smith and playing the game for 90 minutes, I have the answers I was looking for – and I’m excited to share it all in this week’s episode of The Game Informer Show.

                              <span>Last year, Sonic Origins celebrated Sonic the Hedgehog&#x27;s birthday by gathering Sonic the Hedgehog, Sonic the Hedgehog 2, Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles, and Sonic CD in one place with new features and some added bonuses. Despite some shortcomings, the compilation remains the best official way to experience those classic games from Genesis and Sega CD three decades following their original releases. Today, Sega announced the bundle is about to get better through Sonic Origins Plus, a premium upgrade that arrives a year after the collection&#x27;s initial launch.
Sonic Origins Plus brings forward all the features of Sonic Origins delivered last year – Classic Mode, Anniversary Mode, widescreen support, added story animations, a virtual museum, and more – while adding a bunch of new content. First up, Sonic Origins Plus adds all 12 Sonic Game Gear games to the museum.
The full list of Game Gear games getting added is listed below.
Dr. Robotnik&#x27;s Mean Bean Machine
Sonic Blast
Sonic Chaos
Sonic Drift
Sonic Drift 2
Sonic Labyrinth
Sonic Spinball
Sonic the Hedgehog
Sonic the Hedgehog 2
Sonic the Hedgehog Triple Trouble
Tails Adventure
Tails&#x27; Sky Patrol
On top of that, Amy joins the roster of playable characters in the Genesis and Sega CD titles (Sonic 1, Sonic 2, Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles, and Sonic CD). One of the strangest exclusions in the original Sonic Origins release is also rectified, as Knuckles will become playable in Sonic CD. Sadly, this first press release does not make any mention of restoring the replaced music in Sonic the Hedgehog 3.


Sonic Origins Plus arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on June 23. If you don&#x27;t already own the initial release of Sonic Origins, the digital version of Sonic Origins Plus costs $40. The physical version, which includes a 20-page artbook and reversible coversheet with new art, also costs $40. If you already own Sonic Origins, you can upgrade to Plus for $10.

The Nier: Automata tracks &quot;Dependent Weakling,&quot; &quot;Weight of the World Kowaretasekainouta – Marina Kawano,&quot; &quot;Amusement Park,&quot; &quot;A Beautiful Song,&quot; And &quot;Emil&#x27;s Shop,&quot; will be added to the game on March 29. That&#x27;s next Wednesday, so you don&#x27;t have to wait long. Check out Square Enix&#x27;s trailer showcasing these songs in the Tweet below: 
The wait is NieRly over!
@NieRGame Series pack for Theatrhythm Final Bar Line will launch on March 29th with the following songs:

These five songs will join the recently-added six songs from The World Ends With You series. That DLC pack added &quot;Someday,&quot; &quot;Your Ocean,&quot; &quot;World is Yours,&quot; &quot;Breaking Free,&quot; &quot;Twister,&quot; and &quot;Calling.&quot; Song packs typically cost $3 to $6 depending on the pack, but you&#x27;ll get all of these NEO songs and all of these Nier songs if you&#x27;ve purchased Season Pass 1. 
We love the game, and you can find out why in Game Informer&#x27;s Theatrhythm Final Bar Line review.

                              <span>During Summer Game Fest last June, Alien fans were treated to the reveal of a new title called Aliens: Dark Descent. The real-time tactical shooter pits a squad of marines against dozens of deadly xenomorphs, though we hadn&#x27;t seen any gameplay footage until the release of a new video today.
A gameplay commentary video walks players through the basics, in which players command a team of marines to investigate a xenomorph outbreak on Moon Lethe. You’ll issue commands for teammates to attack or execute skills and can also slow time during firefights to select orders. However, your squadmates can perish permanently, but you can raise your survival odds by outfitting soldiers with various weapons and upgrades to ensure the best team composition.


Aliens: Dark Descent is being devleoped by Tindalos Interactive, makers of the Battlefleet Gothic: Armada series, and will be published by Focus Entertainment. It arrives on June 20 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.</span>

                              <span>The Lego Group and 2K have revealed Lego 2K Drive, a new open-world racing game launching this May. 
More specifically, Lego 2K Drive hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on May 19. The game is being developed by WWE 2K and NBA 2K studio, Visual Concepts, and is reminiscent of Forza Horizon&#x27;s open-world exploration mixed with Mario Kart-like racing. If you&#x27;re wondering how we know that, it&#x27;s because we went hands-on with it for a few hours recently, and you can read our preview of the game right now. 
Check out the game in action below: 


Lego 2K Drive is the first collaboration between the Lego Group and 2K but not the last because it is the start of &quot;a multi-title partnership between 2K and the Lego Group to develop AAA Lego games.&quot;

Night Dive Studios is currently led by Stephen Kick and Larry Kuperman and is both a development studio and a publisher. It has published more than 100 games, and will add its remake of System Shock to that list on May 30 (on PC). Atari says a key to the success of Night Dive Studios is its proprietary KEX engine that makes classic games playable on modern hardware. Considering Atari is a retro company, and one that just acquired 12 classic retro games, it&#x27;s easy to see what Night Dive Studios can do for it.

                              <span>Arkane was developing a PlayStation 5 version of its upcoming first-person vampire shooter, Redfall, before Microsoft acquired Bethesda in 2020. However, following the acquisition, the PS5 version of the game was canceled by Microsoft, according to Arkane director Harvey Smith in an interview with IGN France (translated by IGN). 
Discussing this with IGN France, Smith said, &quot;We got bought by Microsoft and that was a huge sea change. They said, &#x27;No PlayStation 5. Now we&#x27;re gonna do Game Pass, Xbox and PC.&#x27;&quot;


Smith said Arkane didn&#x27;t mind the decision, even if Redfall was originally meant to release on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC. 
&quot;Support from Game Pass and having to worry about one less platform, one less complexity,&quot; Smith told IGN France. &quot;And Game Pass has a ton of people that can play. It could be our biggest game ever because of the 30 million Game Pass [members] or whatever that number is.&quot; 
News of this canceled PS5 version of Redfall doesn&#x27;t come as much of a surprise. When Redfall was revealed during a 2021 Xbox and Bethesda E3 showcase, it was revealed as an Xbox console exclusive. And considering it&#x27;s par for the course for companies like PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo to keep their first-party releases off of competitor consoles, it&#x27;s also not surprising Microsoft opted to make Redfall an Xbox exclusive after it acquired Bethesda. 
A spokesperson for Microsoft responded to this story, providing the following statement: 
Redfall hits Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC on May 2.

                              <span>Long before Final Fantasy 14 swept over the MMO landscape, there was 2002&#x27;s Final Fantasy 11 Online. I wasn’t really away that Final Fantasy 11 was still running, but the MMO has been chugging along quietly for a few years - its last expansion having arrived in 2013. After 20 years of support, however, Square Enix is putting Final Fantasy 11 in maintenance mode, meaning servers will stay up and it’ll remain playable, but with limited support.

                              <span>Surprise! The long-promised patch that brings ray tracing to Elden Ring is here, over a year after release. There’s much more in the version 1.09 update besides – the patch notes list plenty of balance changes and bug fixes – but given the sheer amount of time the new ray tracing features have been in the works, not to mention the fact that Elden Ring has never exactly been an exemplar of technical reliability, I wanted to focus in on &#x27;em and see what performance is like on PC.

We kind of end up on an &quot;who tf knows?&quot; but do manage to boil it down into a cowboy metaphor that helps us get a grip on things.
We talk about all that stuff for so long that we end up overrunning and don&#x27;t have time for A Good Day To Ware Hard, or Nate&#x27;s Tower Of Jocularity - although he promises a titanic one next week. We do get in our what games we&#x27;ve been playing this week, and it&#x27;s a varied selection.

                              <span>After some early leaks these last few days, publisher 2K have officially announced Lego 2K Drive, an open-world racer that looks surprisingly awesome - if you’ll excuse the low-hanging adjective. The game features co-op, multiplayer modes, and the ability to transform between air and land vehicles, Team Sonic Racing-style. The downside? Its collection of pre-order bonuses probably needs a graph of some kind to understand.

                              <span>Something terrible lurks beneath the waves in Dredge. Actually, scratch that. There are a lot of terrible things that call the oceans of The Marrows home in this melancholy fishing adventure, but what they are, I couldn&#x27;t possibly tell you. In all my hours sailing these cursed waters, I&#x27;ve only ever seen brief flashes of them - their ungodly, slippery masses, long spiny fins, and a dozen different combinations of glowing eyes, teeth and tentacles. They&#x27;re forever fading in and out of view, cloaked by the thick fog that blankets the sea every evening. Sometimes your ship lights will catch them for a split second before they slip away, or maybe you&#x27;ll only hear them hurtling toward you, with a scream of a jet engine and a maw that&#x27;s white hot, ready for gnashing your flimsy wooden carcass into sawdust. 
It&#x27;s unnerving, being out at sea after dark, but that&#x27;s the time when the rarest and most vile catches raise their scaly heads. So the question becomes: are you willing to risk your own sanity for the sake of a quick buck? Or are you too afraid of what you&#x27;ll find in Davy Jones&#x27; locker? In Dredge, the answer is always yes. Yes, you will be frightened of what&#x27;s out there, whether it&#x27;s real or born from your own fearful imaginings, but you&#x27;ll sputter out into the darkness regardless, because the allure of this supernatural fishing sim is just too good to resist.

                              <span>Last fall, a court of appeals in the Netherlands ruled that internet provider Ziggo is not required to forward piracy warnings to its subscribers. The ruling was a setback for local anti-piracy group BREIN, which wanted to warn frequent uploaders without knowing who they are. BREIN now says that it won&#x27;t take the dispute to the Supreme Court, which might actually be bad news for pirates.

                              <span>Publisher CI Games and developer Hexworks have released a new trailer showcasing some of the impressive visual work going into its upcoming Lords of the Fallen sequel, The Lords of the Fallen. 
The Lords of the Fallen, previously known as Lords of the Fallen 2, has had a rocky development history thus far, but with Hexworks taking over development back in 2020, the sequel has begun to shape up.
We got a reveal trailer during Gamescom last year that showcased the game&#x27;s darker, more gothic tone alongside word that this sequel will feature online co-op and a world five times larger than its predecessor. We got another look at the game&#x27;s grisly world in a new trailer released during The Game Awards back in December, and now, thanks to Epic&#x27;s State of Unreal presentation today, we get to see more of the game. 
Because it&#x27;s a trailer released as part of today&#x27;s State of Unreal presentation, it&#x27;s less cinematic than previous trailers and instead, focuses on some of the visual design work going into the game.
Check it out for yourself below in this new trailer for The Lords of the Fallen:  


As you can see, The Lords of the Fallen continues to look great, and fortunately, we don&#x27;t have to wait too much longer to go hands-on with it because it&#x27;s due out on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC sometime this year. 
For more information about the game, head to our hub for The Lords of the Fallen and then read our thoughts on its predecessor in Game Informer&#x27;s Lords of the Fallen review after that.

                              <span>Ninja Theory revealed Senua&#x27;s Saga: Hellblade II during The Game Awards back in 2019 and while that initial trailer impressed us with its dark tone and beautiful visuals, not much else has been released about the game. Since 2019, the Xbox-owned developer has released two instances of behind-the-scenes footage, with one revealing the game is not a direct sequel to 2017&#x27;s Hellblade: Senua&#x27;s Sacrifice. We did get some gameplay during a trailer at The Game Awards in 2021 but since then, not much. 
Now, thanks to today&#x27;s State of Unreal presentation highlighting the current state of Epic&#x27;s Unreal Engine, we get another tease of what&#x27;s to come in Senua&#x27;s Saga: Hellblade II; this time, it&#x27;s a look at the impressive facial animation Ninja Theory has pulled off in the sequel. 
Check out this new Senua&#x27;s Saga: Hellblade II teaser for yourself below: 


As you can see, Senua&#x27;s Saga: Hellblade II continues to look impressive. Unfortunately, we still don&#x27;t know when we&#x27;ll be playing the game, though. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer&#x27;s Hellblade: Senua&#x27;s Sacrifice review and then head to our Senua&#x27;s Saga: Hellblade II hub for more information about this upcoming sequel.

                              <span>Valve has revealed Counter-Strike 2 and it will be released this summer. 
An official release date was not revealed, but Valve says Counter-Strike 2 will be a free upgrade to anyone who owns Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Plus, if you do own Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, you can jump into a limited test for Counter-Strike 2 starting today. During this testing period, Valve says it will &quot;be evaluating a subset of features to shake out any issues before the worldwide release.&quot; 
The company also says, &quot;Counter-Strike 2 is the largest technical leap forward in Counter-Strike&#x27;s history, ensuring new features and updates for years to come.&quot;
Alongside today&#x27;s reveal, Valve has released three gameplay videos for Counter-Strike 2. You can check out all three below: 






Counter-Strike 2 will run in the Source 2 engine, which has tools and rendering features &quot;available for community map makers to make it easier to build, experiment, and iterate.&quot; There will be a Source 2 Item Workshop as well, and it will be available at a later time during the Counter-Strike 2 limited test. 
The official Counter-Strike 2 has plenty of more nitty-gritty details about the game so head there if you want more information. 
Here are some quick-hit highlights players can expect in Counter-Strike 2: 
Upgraded and overhauled maps
Game-changing dynamic smoke grenades
Tick-rate-independent gameplay
Residgned visual effects and audio
All of a player&#x27;s CS:GO items with them in CS2
Counter-Strike 2 hits PC sometime this summer.

                              <span>Editor’s Note: This story’s headline has been changed to better reflect that a voice actor from Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 hinted at a September release date, even though developer Insomniac Games has only said the game will be released this fall. 
News on Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2, the highly anticipated follow-up to Insomniac Games&#x27; Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man from 2018 and 2020&#x27;s Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man: Miles Morales, has been light since the game&#x27;s reveal in 2021. But back in December, PlayStation did reveal that Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2 would be out sometime this Fall. 
According to the voice actor for Venom in the game, Tony Todd (who we heard briefly in the game&#x27;s reveal trailer), Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2 could be out this September. Strangely, Todd responded to a fan excited about the game and spilled the b…</span>

                              <span>Ubisoft revealed Ghostwriter yesterday, marketed as an AI development tool (really just machine learning) that generates first drafts of NPC barks, which are the offhand remarks you might hear when running past NPCs. Skyrim’s “I used to be an adventurer like you” is probably the most famous example of a bark. Ubisoft Ghostwriter has been met with passionately negative responses from some narrative designers, while others have been arguing for its use cases.

                              <span>Storyteller is a make-your-own drama puzzle game, taking place on the pages of a book and within empty comic-ish panels on those pages. For each puzzle you&#x27;re given a set of characters and scenarios (the Baron, the Knight, the Queen; a wedding, a kidnap, an execution) and are tasked with arranging them in a combination that fits the story title you&#x27;re given (The Queen Marries). It&#x27;s playful and cute, with surprising depth that draws inspiration from classic stories. It&#x27;s also very short. I&#x27;d wager you&#x27;ll have hunnerpercented Storyteller in two hours max, which will sound like mana from heaven to some, but may disappoint you if you&#x27;ve been waiting for Storyteller for over a decade.

                              <span>Arkane’s upcoming co-op shooter found itself in hot water when fans heard of Redfall&#x27;s always-online requirement, even when playing alone. This deflated some longtime Arkane fans since their other immersive sims - between Dishonoured, Prey, and Deathloop - had either no online functionality or were still playable offline. Thankfully, in an interview with Eurogamer, game director Harvey Smith said the team are now working to U-turn the decision.

                              <span>Netflix’s take on chonky soldiers vs. equally chonky underground aliens is, excuse me, gearing up. Last November, the streaming service announced plans to adapt Gears Of War’s chainsaw-swinging into an animated series and a live-action film. The latter has now tapped a writer. Jon Spaihts is the Oscar-nominated screenwriter behind Dune, Prometheus, and Doctor Strange, and he’s now writing the Gears Of War film, Netflix announced today.

An underground volcano lair. A Smaug-pleasing gold hoard, conveniently adjacent to a finance executive’s office. Who’d have guessed, then, that its absolute best fight – not just a thrilling brawl in itself, but the point at which a stumbling adventure plants its feet back in greatness – would take place in a canteen?

I remember a chill ran down my spine as I cast my mind back to Far Cry 6, where the tutorial island itself was longer than anything else I&#x27;d played that year. I was scared Redfall might succumb to a similar fate. I imagined it filling my head with map markers until my head swelled, popped like a balloon, and dropped grey rarity brain matter.
Well, having given Redfall a go for 90 minutes I was, perhaps, being a bit dramatic. The game may be open world, and may have some slightly jarring open world-isms, but I felt like Arkane&#x27;s magic wasn&#x27;t diluted by it all. Their talent for storytelling and level design bubbled to the surface constantly, making exploration a genuine joy. Sure, I have some reservations, but I can&#x27;t deny that I&#x27;m itching to play it again.

Over the past few days, Capcom have released two 1-minute episodes of the Resident Evil 4 anime Masterpiece Theatre called Leon And The Mysterious Village, a childlike take on the classic gothic journey. It’s beautifully animated and hilarious, even without context for Resi4. The only problem? These shorts are too damn short!

                              <span>Update: Seems the agents have come a-knocking. Tax Heaven 3000 has been removed from Steam, although the dating sim and/or tax software is still incoming on Itch.io with a new release date of April 4th.



Doki Doki Literature Club was already scary enough for a dating sim, but our Graham has found something just as creepy. Tax Heaven 3000 is an upcoming dating sim that apparently prepares your US federal tax returns and asks you for personal information like your social security number - all while giving you a cheerful waifu to romance. Her name’s - wait for it - Iris. As in the IRS, aka the government branch responsible for taxes. Sigh.

                              <span>The studio behind Mutant Year Zero: Road To Eden - The Bearded Ladies - have announced a release date for their next game: May 23rd. Miasma Chronicles is another post-apocalyptic tactical RPG, but this time it replaces the anthropomorphic pigs with a friendly robot - who the trailer refers to as your big brother, I should add. Spiritually rather than biologically, of course. If you’re not sold yet, Miasma Chronicles will be showing up to tomorrow&#x27;s Future Games Show.

                              <span>The Outer Worlds: Spacer’s Choice Edition launched to entirely deserved incredulity over its dire performance problems, PC version included. Low framerates, stuttering, lighting glitches, texture popping, wonky shaders... if you could think of a technical woe, it was probably already undermining this remaster’s efforts to rework and enhance the original RPG’s visuals.
Publishers Private Division have since promised a series of updates to get the Spacer’s Choice Edition up to code, with the first of these – v1.1 – releasing late last week. I’ve given it a test on various graphics cards and credit where it’s due, it has bumped up general performance significantly, although many broken parts remain unmended.

                              <span>In our sixth episode, the Indiescovery gang belatedly turn our attention to the question of just what the heck we&#x27;re doing here anyway. The issue of &quot;what makes an indie game an indie game?&quot; is full of twists and turns, and nobody has ever really come up with an answer that covers all the bases. Lucky for us, that&#x27;s not really what we&#x27;re talking about here, although we do use that as a jumping-off point for our chat.
Instead, we try to come up with an Indiescovery Manifesto, one that will guide us in the future when we&#x27;re thinking about what games we ought to cover on the pod. We achieve this through a lively discussion that mainly involves me playing devil&#x27;s advocate by throwing out ridiculous edge cases until Rachel and Liam want to break down and weep. (What can I say, I never saw a fence I didn&#x27;t want to touch just to see if it&#x27;s electrified.)

                              <span>Music streaming apps like Spotify offer more than 100 million tracks but for some, nothing sounds better than leaked, unreleased music. &#x27;Unreleased Sounds&#x27; is a site dedicated to this type of content and already linked to many high-profile leaks. After an artist, linked to Avicii, asked fans not to buy &quot;stolen&quot; music last year, the RIAA now wants to know who&#x27;s behind the site.

                              <span>A few months ago, Netflix announced it was partnering with Gears of War developer The Coalition to bring a film and TV project to the streaming service. Today, the company announced the writer on the film project will be John Spaihts, known most recently for his work on Dune and Doctor Strange. In a press release, Spaihts had the following to say about the project:
 In the same press release, The Coalition called Spaihts &quot;a master storyteller.&quot; The Gears of War developer will also be attached to this project as a producer. You can see their tweet about the announcement below.

We still have no release window for the project, and given that they&#x27;ve only just attached a writer, it&#x27;s probably still a few years out. While many are likely excited at the prospect of this movie&#x27;s existence, there is perhaps nobody more eager to be in on the production details than Dave Bautista. The Guardians of the Galaxy star has been campaigning for years to be cast as the live-action version of Marcus Fenix, and was even available as a playable skin in a post-launch update to Gears 5.

                              <span>Activision has revealed that Crash Team Rumble, the 4v4 competitive multiplayer game revealed at The Game Awards last year, will be released this June. 
More specifically, Crash Team Rumble hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on June 20, as reported by Video Games Chronicle. Activision has also revealed that a closed beta will take place from April 20 through April 24 and anyone who preorders the game will get access to it. This beta will feature Crash Bandicoot, Coco Bandicoot, Tawna Bandicoot, Doctor Neo Cortex, and Dingodile. 


The game will cost $29.99 but a deluxe edition for $39.99 will also be available. Crash Team Rumble will also include a battle pass and both editions include the first season&#x27;s pass. The deluxe edition will also include the Season 2 battle pass, a free 25-tier boost for Season 1, and the digital proto pack, which brings &quot;Blocky&quot; skins to the game alongside some equippable items, according to VGC. 
Previews released today mention three different roles in Crash Team Rumble: Booster, Blocker, and Scorer. Using these three roles in a MOBA-like fashion, players will need to collect as much Wumpa Fruit as possible and bring it to their zone. If you&#x27;ve played 2021&#x27;s Pokemon Unite, you probably get the gist here. 

Crash Team Rumble will feature crossplay. It is being developed by Toys for Bob, the team that developed the Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy collection and Crash Bandicoot 4: It&#x27;s About Time. 
While waiting for Crash Team Rumble to release in June, read Game Informer&#x27;s Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy review and then read our review of Crash Bandicoot 4: It&#x27;s About Time. 
Crash Team Rumble hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on June 20.

The trailer provides glimpses of Cal’s friends and crewmates Ceres Junda, Greez Dritus, and Merrin, all sporting five years&#x27; worth of age, strife, and hair (or lack thereoff). We also get a look at a new partner, the mercenary Bode Akuna. Some fresh gameplay clips are sprinkled in, too, as we see the now grizzled Cal duel stormstroopers, bounty hunters, and droids. 


Star Wars Jedi: Survivor launches on April 28 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. To learn more, check out this story about how the director hopes to turn the series into a trilogy and our interview with star Cameron Monaghan.</span>

                              <span>Update, 3/23/23: 
Another day, another horrifyingly cute and disturbing Resident Evil 4 anime short to watch. Earlier this week, Capcom released Episode 1 of its &quot;Resident Evil 4 Anime – Leon and the Mysterious Village,&quot; following it up yesterday with the release of Episode 2. Episode 3 is now available for viewing and it&#x27;s the most gruesome yet (but also, still very cute). 
Enjoy!


The original story continues below...
Update, 3/22/24: 
Earlier this week, Capcom released a cute (and disturbing) anime short based on Resident Evil 4 and now, just a couple of days later, the company has released another one. The first saw Leon attempting his way through the Village section of Resident Evil 4 but this time, we see him try to rescue Ashley Graham from El Gigante...and it doesn&#x27;t go well.

                              <span>Developer Angry Mob Games has revealed that its action roguelite platformer, Trinity Fusion, will launch into Early Access next month. 
More specifically, Trinity Fusion hits Early Access on April 13. You can access this Early Access launch via both Steam and the Epic Games Store. In Trinity Fusion, you play as Maya, a cross-dimensional warrior who is able to tap into three versions of herself across parallel dimensions. 
Check out the action all three versions of Maya must face in the multiverse in the new Trinity Fusion trailer below: 


&quot;We have a ton of content in the works for Trinity Fusion,&quot; Angry Mob Games&#x27; Bogdan Iliesiu writes in a press release. &quot;Given the amazing feedback we received from players throughout Steam Next Fest and events like EGX, releasing in Early Access was an easy decision to make. With the Early Access release, we&#x27;ll be able to get that same great feedback on our new biomes, enemies, and bosses on an ongoing basis as we keep adding more for players to explore and fight through.&quot; 
Trinity Fusion hits Early Access on PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store on April 13.

                              <span>Zack Snyder, the director behind &quot;Batman vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice,&quot; &quot;Man of Steel,&quot; and more, has revealed that his upcoming Netflix movie, &quot;Rebel Moon,&quot; is getting the game treatment. 
Snyder told The Nerd Queens podcast this alongside word that he was helping with the development of the game, as reported by Video Games Chronicle. As for the type of game, Snyder says it will be an RPG and apparently, it will have a &quot;ridiculous scale.&quot; 
&quot;The one thing that I&#x27;m having a really good time with – and I don&#x27;t really know if I&#x27;m supposed to talk about it – is this RPG that we&#x27;re doing that is just literally insane, and so immersive and so intense and so huge,&quot; he said on the podcast, according to VGC. &quot;There&#x27;s more coming, but all I&#x27;ll say is that it was pitched to me – because I&#x27;ve always wanted to do an RPG – like, &#x27;well, we could do it at this scale, or we could do it at ridiculous scale.&#x27;
&quot;And I was like, &#x27;ridiculous scale is clearly the scale that we should be doing it.&#x27;&quot;
Snyder says the team behind the RPG said, &quot;Well, it&#x27;s going to take so much time, we&#x27;ve got to do all these brain dumps, you&#x27;ve got to tell us everything in the universe, what&#x27;s happening, the science.&quot; And Snyder said he was happy to do that, telling them, &quot;Let&#x27;s go all the way.&quot; 
Snyder wrote and directed Rebel Moon and it hits Netflix this December. 
In the meantime, read about how Netflix is developing its own series based on video games, like this live-action Assassin&#x27;s Creed show and this animated Gears of Wars series (alongside a live-action Gears of War film, too).

Now, just a few months later, the music companies say they&#x27;re entitled to more. To compensate for attorneys fees and interest, the labels are seeking over $12 million, a request that has sparked opposition from Grande.

                              <span>Editor&#x27;s Note: This article was updated on March 20 to include statements from Bungie, Guerrilla, and Lance Reddick&#x27;s wife, Stephanie Reddick. 
Lance Reddick, perhaps best known for his role in HBO&#x27;s &quot;The Wire&quot; has died. He was 60 years old. 
At the time of this writing, the cause of death is unknown but according to TMZ, &quot;law enforcement sources say it appears to be natural.&quot; Deadline was also able to confirm, through the actor&#x27;s public relations representative, that Reddick has died.
Beyond &quot;The Wire,&quot; Reddick also had roles in other shows like &quot;Fringe,&quot; &quot;Lost,&quot; &quot;Bosch,&quot; and even last year&#x27;s &quot;Resident Evil&quot; series on Netflix. His movie credits include the &quot;John Wick&quot; franchise (he was promoting the latest, &quot;John Wick 4,&quot; which hits theaters soon, just this week), &quot;Godzilla Vs. Kong,&quot; and more. 
On the video game side of things, you might recognize him as the voice actor behind Destiny 2&#x27;s Zavala. He also provided his voice and likeness to Sylens in PlayStation&#x27;s Horizon series and Martin Hatch in Remedy&#x27;s Quantum Break. 
Below are statements from Destiny 2 developer Bungie, Horizon Forbidden West developer Guerrilla, and Reddick&#x27;s wife, Stephanie Reddick:

In this series, Pascal plays a detective named Tim Rockford, who&#x27;s trying to figure out what exactly is going on with the mysterious grandma in Merge Mansion. It&#x27;s an enigma so elusive that he never even says exactly what he is he&#x27;s investigating, though from the collection of knives he has in his evidence room, it seems an act of violence was committed.
In a press release, Pascal had the following to say about this role.
What exactly is Tim Rockford investigating? What is grandma putting in her pies? Will Pedro Pascal become a playable character in-game? You&#x27;ll have to play Merge Mansion, available on iOS and Android devices, to find out.
Which extremely high-profile actor do you think will appear in a Merge Mansion ad next? Let us know in the comments!</span>

                              <span>Strayed Lights is out next month on consoles and PC, but you can play it today via a new Steam demo. 
Developer Embers announced the news of this demo today during the Mix Direct Spring 2023 Showcase that aired today alongside a new trailer for the game. Strayed Lights continues to look great visually, and the action looks awesome. 
Check it out for yourself in the new Strayed Lights gameplay trailer below: 


&quot;In Strayed Lights, you travel through otherworldly regions of misty woods, glowing ruins, and corrupted cities while pursued by eerie shadow creatures,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;You also take on boss fights with colossal creatures wrought with unbridled emotion. Your tiny light will grow, picking up new abilities and increasing in size, before eventually evolving into a pseudo-mystical entity imbued with vivid powers. 
&quot;Meanwhile, you&#x27;ll get a glimpse at the mysteries of the surrounding world, whether through other strayed lights like yourself, or different creatures entirely. The game is set to an atmospheric soundtrack that reflects states of feeling in creatures you encounter, by Grammy-award-winning composer Austin Wintory – whose previous projects include Journey, Abzu, and The Banner Saga Series.&quot; 
As for the new Steam demo, Embers calls it a &quot;limited time&quot; experience so if you&#x27;re interested in checking the game out, do it as soon as you can because there&#x27;s no word on when the demo will no longer be available. 

&quot;We are thrilled to be able to share our new gameplay trailer and demo with fans of Strayed Lights,&quot; Embers co-founder and creative director Alexandre Arramon writes in a press release. &quot;We&#x27;ve been working hard to create a game that is both engaging and visually outstanding, and we can&#x27;t wait for players to experience it for themselves.&quot; 
Strayed Lights hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on April 25.

                              <span>Developer Bloober Team has released a new 11-minute trailer showcasing a heaping dose of Layers of Fear gameplay. 
Last year, the studio revealed Layers of Fears, a &quot;psychological horror chronicle built upon the foundations of the original Layers of Fear, Layers of Fear: Inheritance, and Layers of Fear 2.&quot; This new game is essentially an Unreal Engine 5 collection of Bloober Team&#x27;s Layers of Fear series, unified with new elements that tie the overall story together. 
Bloober Team revealed last month that Layers of Fears is now called Layers of Fear and will release sometime this June. Now, you can check out the game in action in the new Layers of Fear gameplay trailer below:

                              <span>Last November, Game Freak released Pokémon Scarlet and Violet on Switch. The game quickly became one of the top-selling games in the history of the popular console, and now, it&#x27;s time for the new generation to kick off within the popular Pokémon Trading Card Game. The inaugural Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet expansion does more than just introduce the ninth generation of Pokémon into the TCG; it also implements a whole host of changes, not the least of which is a higher price tag for most items. 
However, along with that price increase come several benefits, including a new guarantee of three foil cards in every booster pack, plus the introduction of the silver border in the U.S. and other quality-of-life improvements with regards to the designs. The Pokémon Company sent over several booster packs for us to crack open and see what we could pull. While I was less frequently blown away by the big cards I pulled, this is one of the most robust galleries of &quot;the coolest cards&quot; articles I&#x27;ve done in a great many expansions. Partially, that is due to me enjoying seeing some of the newer Pokémon from Gen IX getting their first cards, but I can&#x27;t help but think the increase in foil cards was to thank.
In total, the Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet expansion introduces more than 190 new cards, including more than 10 new Pokémon ex cards, more than 30 Trainer cards, new Tera Pokémon, and tons of special-illustration Pokémon and Trainer cards. You can see the coolest cards we pulled from this expansion in the gallery below:

                              <span>The first two installments of Syberia are now ready for testing in ScummVM!
The acclaimed series from Benoît Sokal follows Kate Walker, a lawyer from New York as she initially tries to complete the sale of the Voralberg toy factory. But quickly Kate is drawn into a search for the owner which takes her on a journey of discovery.  Join her as she uncovers the owner’s fascination with mammoths, the secrets of Syberia, and a love for adventure.
