                    <span>After tackling Metroid in Season 1, the second season of Game Informer&#x27;s Video Gameography podcast moves on to one of the biggest shooter franchises in existence: Halo. This week, we examine Bungie&#x27;s blockbuster Halo 2.
Halo 2 was released on the original Xbox on November 9, 2004, and it was an even bigger success than the original. The lead-up to Halo 2 was full of anticipation, but its development was anything but easy. For the next hour as we talk about Halo&#x27;s massive lore, the Arbiter&#x27;s secret origins, Bungie&#x27;s original grand plans for multiplayer, and how the studio was almost forced to release Halo 2 several years early.
Join hosts Ben Reeves (@BenjaminReeves), Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), and former Game Informer video editor Wade Wojcik (@WadeWojcik) as we unpack the history and impact of Master Chief&#x27;s grand sequel.  And for more Halo, be sure to check out our definitive ranking of every Halo game.

                    <span>The Book of Boba Fett arrives on Disney+ on December 29, but you don&#x27;t have to wait that long to play as the feared bounty hunter in Fortnite. He was added to the store today, sporting his new look from the forthcoming streaming series.
If you purchase just the Boba skin, you&#x27;ll also get his Z-6 jetpack, as well an emote where he using his targeting computer. You can also separately purchase his starship (formerly named Slave One) as a glider, and his gaffi stick as a harvesting tool. You can get everything together in a bundle should you want it all.
If you can survive a sarlacc pit, nothing’s impossible!

Boba isn&#x27;t the only Star Wars character in Fortnite today. While it&#x27;s a bummer he&#x27;s the only new face from The Book of Boba Fett, Epic Games did bring back the previously released imperial storm trooper skin, along with a Y-Wing glider, and a dark side emote.
There&#x27;s a chance more characters from this series will appear in Fortnite over time, but for now, we&#x27;ll just have to use the new renter of Jabba&#x27;s Palace. Unlike Fortnite&#x27;s release of The Mandalorian content last year, Boba Fett&#x27;s arrival doesn&#x27;t add new missions or armor upgrades – it&#x27;s just the skin and themed accessories.
Epic updates Fortnite&#x27;s store every day with new content at 4 p.m. PT. We&#x27;re still waiting for Matrix skins, which we believe will be coming after the recently added emotes and glider, but there&#x27;s a chance that&#x27;s all we&#x27;ll get. Epic may be moving on to Star Wars and other properties in the days ahead. We&#x27;ll have to wait to see what comes next.

My dad used to tell me that, when he was young, the world was in black and white. For a long time, I didn&#x27;t think to question it - after all, every shred of historical evidence we had from the 1950s and before was in black and white, too. Unfortunately, I grew up, and realised that my dad - as all dads are wont to do - was pulling my leg. Still, I could never quite imagine the past as anything more than sepia-toned, even when poring over colourised photos and videos from bygone eras.

                    <span>...and it took a really long time.

We could argue all day about which Zelda is technically the best. In fact, we often do, especially with the 35th Anniversary of the series this year. But no matter how many times we yell at each other that Majora&#x27;s Mask is better than Ocarina of Time, or that Oracle of Ages and Seasons are underrated, there can be no definitive ranking.

                    <span>&quot;A truly special person who can never be replaced&quot;.
The Nintendo community is a tight community. It is a community of joy that is shared online and at events. One of the community&#x27;s most loving, energetic, and hard-working members was Bobby Pauls – also known as The Nintendo Guru. After a long-fought battle in the hospital with COVID-19, Bobby Pauls sadly passed away on Friday, February 26th, 2021.
I was fortunate enough to share many great moments with Bobby online as part of his streaming channels on YouTube and Twitch, as well as in person at E3 in 2018. I have very fond memories of Bobby’s Splatoon 2 streams, his frequent Nintendo news updates, and interviews he would do with personalities from the Nintendo community. He always brought his “A game”.

The term &#x27;genwunners&#x27; gets thrown around a lot in the wider Pokémon community, but when forced to actually rank all the original 151 we think many fans would think twice about at least a few of the original &#x27;mon.

                    <span>Is it worth the hype?
Well, here we are. Eight months after The House In Fata Morgana&#x27;s release, and six months since our first diary entry of &quot;the game better than Breath of the Wild&quot;, it&#x27;s finally time to actually, finally review it.
Fata Morgana is an subject of bafflement, a tantalising enigma, and a frequent point of mockery, all because its Metacritic score (which was a perfect 100, and is now a measly 97) elevated it into being described as &quot;one of the best games of all time&quot; on Switch. This placed it alongside such classics as the aforementioned Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Super Mario Odyssey, and Hades. PC Gamer included it in their latest &quot;Top 100 PC Games&quot; in September. Visual novel fans already knew this, of course — it&#x27;s well-reviewed for a reason — but anyone outside of that genre sphere was left to wonder how good an anime visual novel could actually be, and point out that Fata Morgana&#x27;s high score comes from just nine critic reviews, as opposed to the dozens those games above have to their names. There has to be a catch, right?

GoldenEye 007 has been back in the news lately. We&#x27;ve known for a long time that Rare planned an Xbox Live Arcade remake of the acclaimed shooter and, courtesy of Youtuber Graslu00, we recently got a full look at what that could have looked like. Since then, several people have managed to get their hands on the leaked remaster and play it themselves, either on modded Xbox 360 systems or via emulation.

On 20th January 2021, Nintendo artist, designer, producer and director Takaya Imamura posted his first ever tweet announcing that he was leaving the company after 32 years. Imamura isn&#x27;t retiring — he&#x27;s only 54 — but his departure signals the end of an impressive Nintendo career spanning the 16-bit era to Switch.

Ho ho ho! Yes, the most wonderful holiday of the year has officially arrived and it&#x27;s time to start cracking out the sweetmeats, beverages, and — if you&#x27;re reading this — video games. It&#x27;s Christmas!
Following on from an all-round miserable 2020, this year has been... well, not a whole lot better really. COVID-19 restrictions continue to come and go and come again in many places around the globe, and it&#x27;s looking like things will continue in a similar vein as we head into 2022 in a week&#x27;s time.

                    <span>So this is Christmas, and what have you done? As Katharine said, we&#x27;re officially off until the new year but have lined up some guest authors and god-awful Christmas cracker jokes to tide you over until then. The death of the year does bring some sorrow, with Imogen leaving us, so do say goodbye if you haven&#x27;t already. Then, return to tell me: what are you playing this holiday?

                    <span>Those who enjoy gaming have their reasons for loving the hobby. Still, one prevailing thing that keeps us coming back to keyboards and controllers is the ability of video games to take us to new worlds, introduce us to new characters, and ultimately tell us stories that stay with us long after the credits roll. Maybe someone’s looking to explore a fantasy realm to get away from what might be a more mundane setting here on Earth. Perhaps someone feels homesick and wants to visit a game world that happens to be their old stomping grounds.
Games can even take us to different time periods and seasons, too. Here are some of our favorite games that take place during the holidays.

                    <span>It&#x27;s the most wonderful time of the year: the holidays. If you&#x27;re reading this, I&#x27;m not at work right now, and it&#x27;s great. My brain is happily free of thoughts about video games, video game articles, and the people who play and read both. I&#x27;m free. Free at last. Until January. 
But taking a a day or two off also means filling this website with the almighty drip of pre-written content. The wheels keep turning, no matter the day of the year, and as a lowly worker bee, I am happy to oblige the Game Informer CMS&#x27; never-ending need for listicles. 
So, what should we rank this time? Really, it could be anything. We don&#x27;t put too much thought into these – they&#x27;re pretty low-effort, moderate-to-high gain pieces. You just come up with a couple of good buzzwords – something at least a few thousand p…</span>

                    <span>Earlier, we announced Game Informer&#x27;s official Top 10 Games of 2021, but that list doesn&#x27;t paint the whole picture. That list was compiled after a hard-fought battle over many hours as we struggled to squeeze our collective favorites onto one official list. Unfortunately, many of our favorite games of the year couldn&#x27;t be represented in the official Top Ten, which is why we put together these editor-specific top 10s. Read more...</span>

The Nintendo Switch has an incredibly strong library of games, with many worth recommending. For our 10 absolute favorite games, however, you can check out the list below. It&#x27;s a list we will be updating as often as games worthy of inclusion release. We will kick games off and add new ones as the Switch&#x27;s library grows.
Please note that while the list below contains 10 entries, we aren’t actually ranking them – if a game has made it this far (and managed to stay here), it’s a must-play, period. As such, we’ll be listing entries in reverse chronological order. Also, you’ll find a rundown of previous entries at the bottom of the list. While those titles have gotten bumped for bigger and better experiences, they are still all great games in their own right and…</span>

                    <span>In a year full of satisfying time loops, Returnal’s were often the longest and most punishing. But every time Selene’s ship would crash into the damp, misty enclave on Atropos, it was another opportunity to chase the mysterious white noise. Another shot at challenging the ever-shifting landscape packed with deadly eldritch horrors. One more run at discovering out how long Selene has been making futile attempts at figuring out why she’s on this bleak planet in the first place. Read more...</span>

                    <span>Ever wonder what are the best trees in gaming? No? Look it’s the holidays and we’re strapped for stories. Let’s just run with this and see what happens.

#1 Deku Tree – Why does the Deku tree outrank every other tree in gaming? Because it’s from The Legend of Zelda, and The Legend of Zelda is like the coolest thing ever. Haven’t you heard? Everything Zelda related should be ranked number one. That’s how journalism works. Also, the Deku Tree has a mustache. Double win.

#2 Teldrassil – The old world tree from World Of Warcraft is home to the Night Elves. Of course, the Night Elves suck because they are part of the Alliance, so we weren’t going to include Teldrassil. However, then we heard that sometimes stupid Night Elf noobs fall off the tree and die, so we moved this tree up to number two…</span>

                    <span>Earlier this year, Atlus announced that it wants “to create a 6 which exceeds 5.” I can only speak for myself, but that’s a hard bar to rise above. Persona 5 (and its Royal expansion) is easily one of my favorite games of all time. The limited details surrounding the next game’s narrative, combat, and music have forced superfans like me to make their own wishlists. So, here are six – that’s right, six! – features I’d like to see in Persona 6:
  



      
												
All-Adult Cast
Look, I love Persona’s tried and true narrative DNA – a crew of teenage outcasts call upon their mystical alter egos to defend the world from evil forces while also juggling hobbies, romance, and classes. Nevertheless, I’m ready for Atlus to bring the series’ mature themes to the adult world.

                    <span>In concept, the song “The Twelve Days of Christmas” is just a big list of amazing gifts to get your significant other for the holidays. But in practice, it’s useless! Seriously. Who has twenty different kinds of birds on their wish list, and where would you even put them all? But it’s undeniably catchy. So, we thought we’d spruce up this classic carol by replacing all those unwanted fowl with some great game-related gifts you could get your true love (or really anyone) this holiday season. Hopefully, this version will catch on soon.

                    <span>Second-hand Nintendo games are notoriously pricey, but why?
Over the holidays we&#x27;re republishing some of our best features, interviews, opinion pieces and talking points from the previous 12 months from staff and contributors alike — articles that we feel represent our best of 2021.

The year is 1999. I&#x27;m in a GAME, in Loughborough town centre. The grey carpet is sticky, the awful fluorescent lights are so dim I can barely see, and everything sort of smells like stale sweat. I&#x27;m standing in the N64 section with my brother, both of us clutching a small fortune in pocket money, browsing games that we know nothing about, because we don&#x27;t know that reviews exist yet. We are children, and our buying habits tend to be dictated by whichever colours are brightest, and what we can actually reach.

                    <span>Our team&#x27;s picks for the year&#x27;s finest games.
As 2021 comes to an end there&#x27;s plenty of gaming to reflect upon. It was a relatively busy year from Nintendo as it kept up momentum for the Switch, which added the OLED model and continues to be a top-seller.
The year started with Nintendo&#x27;s first-party slate looking relatively quiet, but that was rapidly fixed with a steady flow of releases big and small, with some ports thrown in to fill gaps. All told we were kept busy and there were a few huge releases from the big N, while third-parties also did their bit. There were a few notable big &#x27;uns from Capcom, SEGA and Atlus, as examples, while the eShop continued to serve up a lot of the finest Indie games.

While Wrestling Empire is no critical darling, sole developer Mat Dickie is used to that reception, having been making his own professional wrestling games since 2000. Despite unusual visuals and unpredictable gameplay, these titles have achieved a cult following – it&#x27;s not a huge leap from the suspension of disbelief required to enjoy wrestling to the suspension of disbelief required to enjoy Wrestling Empire.

It&#x27;s an old chestnut now. Way back in 2006 it was disappointing — if not surprising — that Mother 3 wasn&#x27;t brought to the West, but after Lucas came to Super Smash Bros. in 2015 it seemed like a foregone conclusion that we&#x27;d see the third part of the EarthBound trilogy officially localised at some point.
It wasn&#x27;t to be, though — at least not yet. In the video above Mother uberfan Zion-from-Nintendo-Life-here is joined by fellow video fella and EarthBound advocate Jon-from-Nintendo-Life-here to discuss a few facts and theories about the franchise, the years of hearsay, the state of play right now, the forms in which Mother could potentially return in the near future (or, indeed, the distant future), and how they feel about it all.

Indie game developer Monsoon Studios has revealed that the crowdfunding campaign for its NES action title Cooper Jacket has been a success.
The game – which offers a simultaneous 2-player mode and takes inspiration from the likes of Contra and Commando – had a very modest funding goal of just $9,000. Thanks to the support of 244 backers, it has managed to raise almost twice that amount, finally securing $16,000 of cash.

                    <span>Some trainers are just lucky.
You might have seen a shiny encounter in Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl but have you seen a double shiny encounter before?
Twitch streamer MitchOG was doing a shiny-only run in the newest Pokémon remakes and managed to get the encounter of a lifetime - a shiny starter Turtwig and shiny Starly in the same battle. The odds of a shiny encounter are one-in-4096 and a double encounter is a one-in-almost 17 million chance.

For 24 hours, Epic are handing out Pathfinder: Kingmaker free for keepsies. It&#x27;s a vast fantasy RPG based on the Pathfinder pen &#x27;n&#x27; paper system, played out in ye olde isometric perspective. The sort of RPG that&#x27;s fascinating to some, offputting to others—so a great candidate for a freebie.

Not only is this excellent news, I can&#x27;t get over the fact it straight up sounds like Kiryu delivering some festive cheer.

                    <span>Right now Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker is so popular you can’t buy it anymore. To prevent overcrowding and crashing servers, Square Enix have had to halt free trials and new sales to keep the game stable after an unprecedented surge in popularity this summer. Between that and the global shortage of materials to add more servers, it may be quite some time until new players are able to experience it. If you have an active subscription and manage to brave the long queues however, you’re one of the lucky few who get to experience something truly special. For everyone else: hang in there, it will be worth the wait.

The indie games I&#x27;ve been playing recently all have a bit of an end-of-the-world flavour to &#x27;em, whether literal or metaphorical or by your own hand, if you feel like it. I dunno, I actually found them strangely relaxing, as a sort of counterpoint to the chaos of my own life during the holiday season. See what you think.

                    <span>The latest free game giveaway in GOG&#x27;s winter sale is an unexpected one for the festive season, but perhaps a game which captures the feeling of being trapped at a seemingly endless Christmas lunch with awful relatives: I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream. Nothing says &#x27;bad family Christmas&#x27; like being tortured for 109 years by a sentient supercomputer which nuked humanity and keeps only five people alive to torment. The 90s point &#x27;n&#x27; click adventure game is a grim one (so grim!), but one which does have its fans.

                    <span>In a special Christmas message from three of the NieR series&#x27; development stars, creative director Yoko Taro has announced that NieR is over. No more NieR games for us... unless he receives a massive pile of money. Quickly, it becomes clear he&#x27;s just joshing around. Another classic ruse from the man in the Emil mask, and a subtle hint that they may have something new in the works. Plus, it&#x27;s just a really delightful video and you should all watch it.

                    <span>Music games can provide some of the most fun in all of gaming because music is something everyone can enjoy. Add in gameplay mechanics like puzzles, shooting, dancing, or the use of electric instruments that can be played with a group of friends, and you’ve got a genre that easily becomes a house favorite. While the music genre is not as clear-cut as it used to be – remember when it was basically “Do you want to play Guitar Hero or Rock Band?” – there are many more creative renditions of these experiences, so the scene has never been better than now. However, with the abundance of options now afforded to fans of music games, picking out the one to play can be tough. This list has you covered, though. Here are ten great music games – listed in no particular order – you’ll have a great time …</span>

                    <span>It&#x27;s always awesome when you can see your favorite pokémon tagging alongside you in the well-loved RPG. But now, some fans can recreate that feeling in real life with the new Pokémon Collection from Secretlab. The gaming chair company has given its Titan Evo 2022 Series the very best makeover, with the ergonomic seats sporting two of the franchise&#x27;s most recognized mascots. One of the offerings features an adorable image of Pikachu, with yellow lettering and accents to match. The other orange-and-blue-laced option in this fresh collection is packing a Zard. Both chairs come with a pair of pokéballs stitched into the upper left corner, the creatures&#x27; pokédex number in the right, and a handful of themed, custom stitching throughout. 
But before you go off to try and snag one of these functional gaming collectibles, we have good and bad news. The bad? Secretlab&#x27;s collection is only available in Japan right now while supplies last. So, it would seem like anyone outside that country is out of luck for now. However, there is a glimmer of hope as the manufacturer has provided a link on its website that will allow you to &quot;register interest.&quot; We hope this means that – given enough people click the link and provide their email – Secretlab will consider selling these unique products around the globe. So if you&#x27;d like to get more news on the chairs and hopefully bring the Kanto-region pokémon to your region, check out the collection&#x27;s official website.

                    <span>The Xbox-published title that aims to simulate life on the high seas has sailed past another milestone and is giving away a special gift to mark the occasion. Sea of Thieves has sold five million copies on Steam, and it’s heading into the holiday season full of festive cheer, as well as a little bit of a pirate’s favorite beverage. If you want to join in, the developers at Rare suggest you play the game now through the middle of next week to snap up a special emote. The team announced this achievement on the game’s official blog, along with the news that over 25 million players have dived into Sea of Thieves to hunt down treasure, explore the oceans, and live out the life of a scallywag with their friends.

                    <span>A new year, a new slew of video game heroes and villains. This year had a lot of great stand-outs – from characters we met for the first time to old favorites. Narrowing down our favorites wasn&#x27;t easy, but after much deliberation, here are our top picks for the best heroes and villains of 2021. 
Please note: Neither list is ordered, so just because one character comes before or after another doesn&#x27;t mean we consider them better or worse in any way. 
HEROES
Ethan Winters – Resident Evil Village
The best horror protagonists are relatable; people who find their circumstances both as terrifying and hard-to-believe as we would in the same situation. This is what makes Ethan Winters such a good lead in the two Resident Evil games he&#x27;s starred in – Resident Evil 7: Biohazard and this year&#x27;s excel…</span>

                    <span>New year, new Games with Gold lineup, and this upcoming month&#x27;s titles all seem to have a theme. We are looking forward and backward with a slew of games that run the gamut from ultra-futuristic to retro-futuristic. Come January, Xbox owners with Xbox Live Gold membership or that subscribe to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate will be able to grab the titles listed below for free:
NeuroVoider: Available January 1 to 31
Aground: Available January 16 to February 15
Radiant Silvergun: Available January 1 to 15
Space Invaders Infinity Gene: Available January 16 to 31
As usual, the games are only available for a limited time, so make sure you catch anything you are interested in before it leaves the service. The first up on the list is NeuroVoider, a twin-shooter RPG that sets waves of robotic baddies after you. You&#x27;ll have to take each of them down to end the neverending war that&#x27;s been tearing up the cyber futuristic world. Coming in the same window as NeuroVoider during the first half of the month is Radiant Silvergun. The vertical scrolling shoot &#x27;em up was first released in 1998 but has been shined up for modern players.
In the back half of the month, players will be able to pick up Aground and Space Invaders Infinity Gene. The second title, a fresh twist on the well-known Space Invaders franchise, is only available until the end of January, so pick it up as soon as you can. However, Aground, a game focused on building and crafting set amongst the stars, will be available until the middle of February. 
While the end of the year is fast approaching, we still have a little bit more time left in December. So, if you have not picked up last month&#x27;s Games with Gold, you can pick those up now. This month&#x27;s free titles included The Escapists 2, Tropico 5: Penultimate Edition, Orcs Must Die, and Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet. There are some good titles in there, so don&#x27;t miss out if you have Xbox Live Gold or Xbox Game Pass Ultimate.
What do you think about 2022&#x27;s opening Games with Gold? Let us know in the comments below.</span>

The new Uncharted film is only months away and we just got a brand new trailer to pick apart. Much of the footage isn&#x27;t new, following the first trailer that was released back in October pretty closely. However, this new look at the upcoming adaptation does give us a few fresh tidbits, including a little more backstory on Moncada, the movie&#x27;s antagonist played by Antonio Banderas. It seems, his family did more than search for the unbelievable fortune central to the story, they found it but were then betrayed. We&#x27;ll have to see how this ties into Nathan Drake (played by Tom Holland) and Victor &quot;Sully&quot; Sullivan&#x27;s (played by Mark Wahlberg) plans to recover the glittering treasure. 
One of the biggest reveals of the trailer came at the end when we get our first glimpse of Sully in the film with his characteristic mustache. In the games, Sully&#x27;s facial hair is one of his defining features, and one that Uncharted fans immediately noticed was missing in early character reveals. While it felt strange to see the mentor without it, the change made some sense considering this movie takes place before the Naughty Dog series. However, it looks like Sully won&#x27;t stay clean-shaven throughout the whole film, and you can check out the reveal, along with the rest of the new details in the trailer above. 
Sony Entertainment Picture&#x27;s Uncharted will release in theatres on February 18. Recent posters found on Fandango showcase some pirate-worthy imagery, of which we see more in today&#x27;s trailer. This led some to believe that the upcoming movie may have ties to Uncharted 4: A Theif&#x27;s End, which features a graveyard of similar-looking vessels. However, it&#x27;s hard to tell exactly what connections we will see between the games and the upcoming adaptation. There&#x27;s only two more months until we find out.</span>

                    <span>Every long-running series has its turning points, times that demand reinvigoration and forward-thinking. Tales of Arise was Bandai Namco’s opportunity to enact meaningful change and enter a new console generation soaring. The developers didn’t let the opportunity pass by, rising to the challenge and breaking franchise sales records in the process. Tales of Arise took interesting risks and made smart improvements, resulting in a fantastic RPG full of endearing characters, intense battles, and rewarding exploration.
In its 26-year run, the Tales series has always had a passionate fanbase, but Tales of Arise helped expand the franchise’s reach and elevate its established formula to make it one of the best entries in years. While retaining the series’ essence, Bandai Namco brought in a new visual style, more strategic combat, and a mature story about warring nations. The latter especially made its mark for how it tackled socio-political issues, like racism, authoritarianism, and mental illness. Read more...</span>

                    <span>It&#x27;s been just around two years since Telltale Games announced its return. Populated by some of the former studio&#x27;s staff and led by a new team, the company announced a follow-up to The Wolf Among Us during The Game Awards 2019. Then things seemed to go quiet, leading many to speculate on how the newly reformed studio was doing. However, Telltale has recently been very vocal about the status of its projects and the studio itself. This most recent post from Telltale&#x27;s official Twitter account runs down a list of the studio&#x27;s recent milestones and what it hopes to achieve in the near future. It begins, &quot;Telltale is back.&quot; Then the post moves on to assure readers that the company, while trying to stay true to the Telltale legacy, is changing things up and steering clear of the problems that plagued the original studio.
Perhaps the most eye-catching part of the message comes near the end, in the section detailing what comes next. It seems like we will be hearing more about The Wolf Among Us 2 soon. As you can read below, the post states the team will be ready to reveal more news &quot;early next year when we can go deeper into things.&quot;
While we are excited to hear news about Telltale&#x27;s upcoming sequel, the studio has more projects on the horizon. Announced just weeks ago at The Game Awards, The Expanse: A Telltale Series will be an adaptation of the popular Amazon TV show and is being co-developed with Life is Strange: True Colors studio Deck Nine. The two developers have a strong storytelling history, giving us a lot to look forward to in the title.</span>

                    <span>I’ve been pretty open about this recently, but a few years ago, there was a time when I was feeling overwhelmingly lonely. My days at work were mostly spent alone in a dark projection booth above a corporate auditorium. To spice up my evenings and force some human interaction on myself, I started playing Magic: The Gathering at a local game shop. I spent multiple days a week there, learning how to draft, build decks, and catch onto the lingo and language of the game. Slowly, I incorporated myself into the small group of regulars, and day by day, I felt less alone.
While shuffling decks and slinging spells against these new acquaintances, I noticed shared mannerisms and social archetypes people took on within my little corner of the Magic community. Let me tell you how pleasantly surprised …</span>

Honestly, most of our Steam Autumn Sale recommendations still stand, but the few of us in the RPS treehouse who haven&#x27;t already clocked off for the Christmas holiday do have some fresh picks for you too.

There&#x27;s some Christmassy-ness flowing in to tide me over, thanks to the mini-Christmas tree in my room. Every year it&#x27;s popped on the wardrobe alongside an honorary Lynx Africa. They share the same festive colours, after all.
Having pondered my tree for a bit, I thought about trees in games and how they make for good side quests. Now join me by the bark, as I examine why this might be the case in a roundabout manner.

                    <span>When I was younger I watched a nature documentary narrated by David Attenborough (I realise that doesn&#x27;t narrow it down) and in this nature documentary David told me about a cave. It is a very big cave, and every night a huge colony of bats come screaming out of the entrance. They spend the day clinging to the ceiling of this big cave, and all their bat poo falls down and has become a towering heap carpeting the floor.
But then David said look, the carpet is moving. And it turns out that the whole bottom of the cave is covered in cockroaches and giant centipedes. And if ever a small baby bat or an old injured bat falls, it is eaten alive by this hoard of chittering insects. This nature documentary haunted me, for it was the worst thing I could imagine happening.
Anyway, Nate has been to that cave and he&#x27;s going to tell us all about it for this episode of our supporters only podcast, The Nate Files. Thanks for being a supporter, pals!

                    <span>It&#x27;s been a busy, kind of mixed year for strategy games. Ever a broad church, 2021&#x27;s seen enough releases to keep ten of me busy, from the easy-going Legion War to the month-consuming Shadow Empire. I don&#x27;t know about you, but my personal &quot;to play&quot; list is out of control.
And yet, while we&#x27;ve had plenty to enjoy this year, it&#x27;s felt like a period of build-up to something bigger. I&#x27;m not one for looking forward. If a game&#x27;s not out yet it tends to disappear from my mind, making room for a hundred other recent releases in this age of plenty. That I&#x27;ve less interest in looking back over this year than I do pondering the next suggests that maybe we&#x27;re in for something special in the coming twelve months. Or perhaps it&#x27;s just been a rough one and I&#x27;m very sleep deprived and don&#x27;t want to think about 2021. Either way, let&#x27;s have a look at what&#x27;s in store for strategy fans in 2022, yeah?

                    <span>Embracer Group are continuining to do their part in attempts to merge the entire video games industry into one megacorp, this week announcing another five intended acquisitions. Among these are Perfect World, the publishers of Star Trek Online and Torchlight, and the studio behind Scribblenauts Showdown, Shiver Entertainment. They&#x27;re also going transmedia, buying comics and TV company Dark Horse as well as an animation company and a video-on-demand network. Now they just need to get into food and housing, then our dystopian dreams of one corp owning our entire lives can come true.

                    <span>A recent round of BIOS updates for Dell and Alienware systems has turned out to be something of a bad batch. As first spotted by Bleeding Computer, multiple owners of Dell-made PCs – including the Alienware Aurora R8 and Inspiron 5680 gaming desktops, as well as the Latitude 5320 and 5520 business laptops – started developing big problems after installing the new BIOS versions.

There are plenty of fantastic fighting games out there, both old and new. As Arc System Works continues to update its older Guilty Gear games with rollback netcode, those fighters are given new life. However, is there room for another fighter with recent entries in the genre, such as Guity Gear Strive, and others on the horizon like SNK&#x27;s King of Fighters XV? After going hands-on with the DNF Duel beta over the past weekend, Game Informer editor John Carson thinks so. 
Game Informer editor and today&#x27;s host, Wesley LeBlanc, is joined by John, AKA The King of Late Night, AKA possibly the greatest fighting game player in the world, to discuss the recent beta test. The two also talk about what makes DNF Duel different in a busy genre, where its inspirations lie, and most importantly, how it feels to play. 
In this New Gameplay Today, we also have 15 minutes of action-packed DNF Duel Beta gameplay on top of the discussion topics above. Thanks for watching, and be sure to let us know what you think of this upcoming fighting game from Eighting and Arc System Works.</span>

                    <span>Each week, Hasbro unveils new Star Wars action figures at Bring Home the Bounty. This week&#x27;s reveal focuses its sights on Electronic Arts&#x27; Star Wars Battlefront II video game from 2017. Hasbro is bringing four new action figures from the game to market. All four are Clone Troopers decked out in some of the game&#x27;s unique armor coloring. Three of the figures fall into the 3 and 3/4-scale Vintage Collection, with the final one joining the Gaming Greats Black Series line.
The latter figure is the Umbra Operative Arc Trooper with a cool black and orange coloring. This clone stands at roughly six inches in height and comes with two pistols. It will be sold exclusively at GameStop with an expected ship date next April.

                    <span>Brandon Sanderson, the famed author behind fantasy series Mistborn and The Stormlight Archive series, has revealed he’s working on a video game. 
This news comes by way of a recent blog post he made titled “State of the Sanderson 2021,” which, like previous “State of” posts made by the author, details what he has going on in his career. He mentions feature films, TV series, and more, but he also quickly divulges that he’s been working on a game for a while and we might be seeing it soon. 
“I’ve been working on a video game for several years, and I suspect it will be announced this year,” Sanderson writes. “So commence speculation.” 
Sanderson’s post includes a note that says the game is not based on one of his properties and is instead something new he built with the team he’s working with on this project. He also said that people will recognize the company developing the game but playfully suggests it&#x27;s “probably not the one you’re thinking of right now,” nor is it “that other one either.” 
And that’s all Sanderson had to say about this game. Sanderson entering the video game scene would be quite a treat for fans of the author, whose only other experience in games is minimal. He wrote a novella e-book in 2011 for Epic Games Infinity Blade series called “Infinity Blade: Awakening.” (Editor&#x27;s note: he has also worked on some fiction for Magic: The Gathering. – JC) However, as the author notes that this game won’t be based on one of his own series, those holding out for a Mistborn RPG will have to continue their wait. 
Perhaps this development will go so well that Sanderson decides to greenlight a Mistborn game of some kind. While not a full game, you can technically get a taste of Mistborn in the form of a game by way of Fortnite, which recently sold a skin based on Kelsier. Be sure to check out Sanderson’s entire “State of” post for more information about what the author is up to.

                    <span>In celebration of our Horizon Forbidden West cover story, which digital subscribers read now, we&#x27;re letting you get a look at the new screens Guerrilla Games shared with us for the story. These shots were provided exclusively to Game Informer for our extensive 12-page feature to highlight certain aspects we discussed.
For some context for the images below, they mostly feature a new area called the Daunt, which is a canyon at the eastern edge of Sundom (Carja territory). This new settlement acts as an onboarding area to get players up to speed with the game’s new mechanics. It is Aloy&#x27;s last stop before she heads to the Forbidden West. These screens also provide a view of a market and tavern to show off the more lively locales.
Lastly, there&#x27;s a look at a new machine called the Burrower, which is a successor to Horizon Zero Dawn&#x27;s Watcher. This common recon machine can tunnel underground and resurface in unexpected locations. When it senses danger, it emits a high-pitched sound to call allies and stun enemies.  According to game director Mathijs de Jonge: &quot;We wanted to add even more character and locomotion to the machines in Horizon Forbidden West, so the Burrowers are very similar to otters or weasels: flexible, quick, and pretty ferocious!&quot;

                    <span>The upcoming immersive sim western from former Dishonored and Prey devs, Weird West, has been delayed. 
Previously due out on January 11, 2022, on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC, Weird West will now hit those platforms a little over two months later on March 31, 2022. As for why, the team at Wolfeye Studios needs more time to make it as great as it can be.

“Weird West is an impressively deep mix of action RPG and immersive sim elements built on the Wolfeye team’s experience with Dishonored and Prey,” a press release about the announcement reads. “Early feedback is fantastic but, as is the case with any immersive sim, there are a lot of variables that can lead to unintended consequences. More time is needed to deliver an experience that the community expects from Wolfeye and Devovler. The team understands this might be a disappointment to folks, but want to sure that the game they’ve worked on for years is launched in the best form possible.” 
Weird West was first announced during The Game Awards 2019 and it promised a very weird west indeed, complete with gunslingers and fantastical creatures. Two years later, one Game Informer editor went hands on with it and determined that Weird West is a wild west worth exploring.

                    <span>Ubisoft, the company behind franchises like Assassin’s Creed and Far Cry, first broached the topic of NFTs back in early November, revealing plans to one day implement them into its games and also develop blockchain games. We learned a month later – this month – that Ubisoft’s comments in November were less a broach of NFTs and more preparation for a reveal of its NFT-based platform called Ubisoft Quartz. 
Quartz is now live as a beta where players can earn NFT cosmetic items to use in Ghost Recon Breakpoint. However, the announcement and reveal of Quartz was met with criticism, with many calling for Ubisoft to back off the idea of NFTs in its games. A report from Eurogamer reveals that Quartz Digit recipients have sold a total of just 15 of these NFTs, likely a number much smaller than Ub…</span>

                    <span>Hot on the heels of Spider-Man: No Way Home, which hit theaters one week ago, Marvel Studios has released a teaser for its highly anticipated Doctor Strange sequel, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness. 
Spoilers for No Way Home below…
Okay so just in case you missed that nice spoiler warning up above, I figured I’d write some additional sentences here for those whose eyes might have wandered down just a bit. I&#x27;m going to write just one more sentence for those wandering eyes because I care about you and don&#x27;t want you to get spoiled of something you don&#x27;t want to be spoiled on.

                    <span>The missions change. They always do. While that’s true, what’s at the heart of the Halo franchise does not change – it’s Master Chief, Cortana, some punchy guns that don’t get old, and a soundtrack that never lets up. Throughout the decades, Chief and Cortana (and buddies like Buck) have found themselves on Earth, Sanghelios, hurtling through space, aboard exploding rings, and more. But no matter the locale, we were finishing the fight – even when some of those battles were more grueling than others.
Sadly, Chief was absent from the fight the Game Informer editors partook in to rank all the Halo games from worst to best. It’s important to note that we opted to rank only the Xbox console FPS Halo games, which means you won’t find mobile, arcade, or RTS spinoffs like Halo Wars or Fireteam Ra…</span>

                    <span>Halo Infinite is joining in on the winter holiday fun other live-service multiplayer games take part in each season, and similar to those, there are plenty of free rewards to earn by taking part. 
Dubbed Winter Contingency, this event began yesterday, December 21, and will run until January 4. What’s more, there are ten free rewards for all players to earn, and earning them is simple: play a match of Arena or Big Team Battle. That’s it. 
Click here to watch embedded media


“Rewards will be unlocked over time, meaning they will not all be available to grab on day one,” a Halo Waypoint blog post about the event reads. “Think of Winter Contingency like your in-game Halo advent calendar: you’ll unlock one reward each day, with the event running through the morning of January 4, 2022. To be clear: While the daily rewards conclude on December 30, what this means is you’ll have several extra days to catch up on any items that you may have missed.”
For example, if you didn’t play a match yesterday, you’re one day behind, but because the event lasts until January 4, you’ll earn your final reward on December 31 (assuming you play a match every day in between now and then). 
Speaking of rewards here’s what you can expect: 
Day 1: Wild Justice nameplate
Day 2: Peppermint Laughter armor coating
Day 3: UA/Tatius shoulder left pad
Day 4: UA/Tatius shoulder right pad
Day 5: Peppermint Laughter MA40 Assault Rifle weapon coating
Day 6: Snowmageddon backdrop
Day 7: Navlogcom nameplat
Day 8: Peppermint Laughter MK50 Sidekick weapon coating
Day 9: Myesel ammo pouch
Day 10: Sunset Contessa armor coating
If you’ve already nabbed your daily reward today and need something to do, check out the official Game Informer Halo Infinite review. Then, give our breakdown of everything available in the Halo Infinite shop this week (including a very Iron Man-esque armor coating and cat ears) a look.

                    <span>The third and final pair of Xbox 20th Anniversary shoes were unveiled yesterday, and as any sneakerhead might guess, they sold out immediately. 
Priced at $140, the Adidas Forum Tech Boost sneakers sold out immediately, but it looks like more could be on the way. On the official Adidas storefront page for the shoes, you can sign up for email notification of future drops. Of course, it could just be referencing any incoming future drops, but we’re hoping it means more of these Boosts are on the way because they look great.

                    <span>Rockstar Games is once again treating PC gamers to something a little extra by giving out a free game with the purchase of Theft Auto: The Trilogy – Definitive Edition.  
As an incentive to buy the collection through Rockstar&#x27;s store on PC, you&#x27;ll be able to redeem an additional free Rockstar game to add to your digital collection. That&#x27;s on top of the advertised 20% discount and the free original versions of the trio of games that were brought back as a make-good for performance issues at launch.
Which games can you snag for free? It&#x27;s, of course, a selection of titles developed by Rockstar, but there are some great options to choose from. However, you only get one, so choose carefully. Here&#x27;s the list:
Grand Theft Auto V: Premium Edition
Grand Theft Auto IV: Complete Edition
Max Payne 3
L.A. Noire
Bully: Scholarship Edition
If you already own those games through Rockstar&#x27;s launcher, you won&#x27;t be able to redeem a second copy. But, there are a couple of alternatives, like a Great White Shark Cash Card for GTA Online or 55 Gold Bars for Red Dead Online.
You can find the holiday deal on Rockstar&#x27;s site, which will be available through January 6, 2022. Unfortunately, the deal is only available through Rockstar&#x27;s storefront, and there aren&#x27;t any similar deals extended to console players.
Will this incentive be enough to get you to pick up the remastered trilogy on PC? Let us know what you think in the comments.</span>

                    <span>Everyone knows there are two conditions that must be met before Christmas can officially begin. The first is playing Skeal. The second is the arrival of Steam&#x27;s Winter Sale. Blissfully, we can now tick both of these objectives off our to-do list, as Valve have finally unleashed their flurry of seasonal deals. Between now and January 5th, thousands of games will be discounted across Steam, and you&#x27;ll also be able to claim a free sticker every day as well, for those of you who enjoy that sort of thing.

                    <span>It struck me recently that I’ve not played as much of Halo Infinite’s multiplayer as I thought I would. I envisaged myself wiling away most evenings with my mates, playing Oddball and Slayer and laughing like someone from those video game adverts, swaying violently with a controller in hand.
I now know the reason why and I hate to admit it. Infinite doesn’t have a battle royale mode, which I&#x27;ve come to realise is the perfect FPS template for gaming with my mates. Something about it just works, you know? Listen, let me explain.

                    <span>I know almost nothing about Alfred Hitchcock. He’s the kind of archetypal director whose work I’ve been exposed to in bits and pieces without ever actually sitting down to watch one of his films in full. All of that is to say that, upon starting Alfred Hitchcock - Vertigo the game, I was in no position to judge whether it was a faithful adaptation of the film or to recognize all but the most obvious illusions to Hitchcock’s body of work (look, birds!). That’s okay, though, because as it turns out, Vertigo is an original story based on a collage of Hitchcockian concepts, not a direct adaption of the 1958 film by the same name.
Vertigo the game follows author Ed Miller as he grapples with a debilitating case of vertigo–a condition that leaves him unable to stand as the world appears to spin around him–and paralyzing guilt over the death of his daughter and her mother, Faye, after their car falls off a bridge into a ravine below. With Ed bed ridden, it’s up to Dr. Julia Lomas, psychologist and psychiatrist, and Sheriff Nick Reyes to unravel the mystery of what really happened, and whether Faye and his daughter even exist. My thoughts on how Vertigo goes about telling this story are... complicated.

                    <span>Final Fantasy XIV players haven’t had it easy these last few weeks. The sheer success of its Endwalker expansion resulted in lengthy login queues and server errors. It’s become so popular that Square Enix have temporarily stopped selling the game, taking its Starter and Complete Editions off sale. All the while, some low-poly grapes stayed static in the breeze. Jagged, delicious, minding their own business. Until their blockiness was papped and thrust into the public eye. Memes ensued and the grapes became the talk of the town, so much so that they’ve been smoothed out in the latest patch, much to everyone’s dismay.

It&#x27;s a gorgeous-looking adventure that came out in early access back in October, but unfortunately the launch didn&#x27;t go as well as the devs had hoped it would. Yesterday, they announced that they&#x27;ve had to lay off around 25 employees to keep the studio going. They add that development will continue, albeit at an understandably slower pace.

                    <span>AMD s nejnovější aktualizací svého balíku kompilátorů založených na projektech LLVM/Clang/Flang přidává další drobné výkonnostní optimalizace.

                    <span>The Assassin’s Creed series debuted in 2007, and since then, the series has become a fixture in the gaming landscape. It received reliable annual installments (or more!) for several years; that cadence has relented a bit now, but the franchise&#x27;s long history has certainly left us with no shortage of Assassin’s Creed games to enjoy. But how do they stack up against each other?
 We originally published a version of this list back in 2015, but more Assassin&#x27;s Creed games have released now, and some of our perspectives have shifted. So we are taking another look at the titles in the whole main series (no spin-offs or side-stories) and ranking them, highlighting the best moments and acknowledging the weaknesses in each.

                    <span>Halo Infinite&#x27;s shop updates every Tuesday at 10 a.m. PT with new items that players can purchase with credits. Since the launch of the free-to-play multiplayer component, 343 Industries has done a nice job of offering up colorful items for players to purchase. The latest rotation brings a bundle that alienates dog lovers but should make cat enthusiasts feel right at home.
This week&#x27;s pricey 2,000 credit bundle is called Fire and Frost and gives your Spartan the red-and-gold coloring of Iron Man. To use this armor coating you need the Yoroi and Mark V armor core. The bundle also comes with the Trash Removal stance, and Tempest of Blades emblem, nameplate, and weapon decal.
The most comical item this week is the Cat Lovers bundle that gives your Spartan helmet cat ears. You also get a faded blush armor coloring and a Tabby charm for your weapons. If you just want to look like a cat yet want to show off your love of food through the charm, the Chow Down bundle gives you a pizza slice charm, a bacon charm, and a Second Breakfast emblem, nameplate, and weapon decal.
For those of you seeking more realism, the Maltese Mayhem Weapon Set offers a variety of weapon models, such as the Critpoint Shroud design for the MK50 Sidekick. You also unlock the Maltese Mayhem weapon coloring.</span>

Axios’ report about this exodus says colleagues across the company refer to what’s happening as “the great exodus” and “the cut artery.” Those colleagues describe this exodus happening at Ubisoft as something they’ve never seen before, citing reasons such as low pay, competitive opportunities, frustration at the company’s creative direction as of late, and the recent scandals surrounding the video game development and publishing company. 
The report also says that “at least five of the top 25-credited people from the company’s biggest 2021 game, Far Cry 6, [are] already gone,” noting that on the Assassin’s Creed Valhalla side of things, 12 of the top 50-credited developers from that game have departed …</span>

                    <span>Online multiplayer functionality and DLC could soon be coming to Raw Thrill’s Cruis’n Blast in a future update. 
First reported by Nintendo Life, Raw Thrills boss Eugene Jarvis recently took part in a Reddit AMA where he talked about a number of video game-related things, including the recently-released Cruis’n Blast. He said that the next goal for the team is online multiplayer.

“Online multiplayer is out next goal for Cruis’n/Switch…when we get our online multiplayer going, we’ll definitely look at bringing on some more content,” Jarvis said in the AMA. 
While not official confirmation that online multiplayer and additional content are coming to Cruis’n Blast, it’s at least nice to hear that Raw Thrills is looking into both. That’s great because one Game Informer editor who wrote up their first impressions of the arcade racer noted that it was a disappointment Cruis’n Blast didn’t feature online multiplayer. 
Elsewhere in the AMA, Jarvis said he’d love to see the original Cruis’n Nintendo 64 trilogy ported to Switch and that he’ll “talk to Miyamoto” about seeing what Raw Thrills can do. 
Only time will tell if online multiplayer and additional content like new cars and tracks make their way to Cruis’n Blast. For now, check out our thoughts on in it this episode of All Things Nintendo, which is Game Informer’s Nintendo podcast, and then read about how Cruis’n Blast is an unapologetic, enjoyable arcade racing throwback after that.

                    <span>In 2017, Guerrilla Games wowed us with a new IP that was different from anything it had ever produced. Best known for the shooter Killzone series, Guerrilla flipped the script and ventured into the open-world action/RPG genre, inviting us to a post-apocalyptic Earth where massive, animal-like machines have become a part of the ecosystem. Horizon Zero Dawn was an overwhelming success, with adrenaline-pumping battles, an awesome protagonist in headstrong Aloy, and exciting discoveries around every bend. We couldn’t wait to experience more, especially since Guerrilla had left some loose ends hanging. Thankfully, the highly anticipated sequel, Horizon Forbidden West, is just around the corner with its February 18 release date.

                    <span>We’re in Year 2 of the new-gen consoles from PlayStation and Xbox, and it’s still as tricky as ever to get your hands on one. 
This is due to several reasons, including the rise of online bots that automatically purchase these consoles, the resale market, and more, but perhaps chief among these reasons is the ongoing chip shortage. These chips are used in the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S consoles, which means PlayStation and Xbox cannot produce as many as they’d like as quickly as they’d like. Unfortunately, after AMD CEO Lisa Su said back in October that the chip shortage could last into 2022, the CEO of Intel has now said he believes it could last into 2023.

                    <span>It might be a while until we learn more about the Ghost of Tsushima movie adaptation currently in the works.
That’s because director Chad Stahelski, who’s perhaps best known for directing all three John Wick films (as well as the upcoming fourth one, too), told IGN in a new interview that the team behind it wants to do right by the game. To do that, the team is taking its time.

“We just want to do it right,” Stahelski said. “You know how video game adaptations can go. So we’re taking our time and doing it right. We’re working very closely with game developers to make sure we stick to what’s great about it.” 
IGN notes that Stahelski stated that a script is still being developed for the movie. He also said that fans of Ghost of Tsushima “would be very happy with what we’re working on,” noting that he’s played it “many times,” which is something that initially drew him to the project.
When asked if Jin Sakai English voice actor Daisuke Tsuji would be reprising his role in the film, Stahelski said, “we’ll see,” and they “haven’t gotten that far yet.” Only time will tell for now. 
For now, read about the original announcement of a Ghost of Tsushima movie and then read about how Tsuje really wants in on the film – he even said he entirely agrees to butt-nudity in it. Read our thoughts on the game in Game Informer’s Ghost of Tsushima review after that.

                    <span>The ancient Egypt of Assassin’s Creed Origins is a visually stunning place to explore, and it could soon look even better. 
That’s because Ubisoft has revealed that it’s looking into adding 60 FPS support to the Bayak-led Assassin’s Creed title. This news was announced today, December 21, which also happens to be Assassin’s Creed Day. No, it’s not an anniversary for the first Assassin’s Creed title or any title in the franchise. It’s the day of the Winter Solstice, and in Assassin’s Creed lore, December 21, 2012, was supposed to be the end of the world. 
Happy #ACDay 💝

However, Desmond Miles sacrificed himself to save the world from the destruction of Juno. That happened in 2012’s Assassin’s Creed 3. Assassin’s Creed Origins would be released on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC five years later. As the name implies, its story represents the origin of the Assassin Brotherhood (or at least what would one day become the Brotherhood). It sounds like soon we’ll be able to experience that origin story in 60 FPS. 
Unfortunately, those looking for more will have to wait and see what comes of this update, as Ubisoft did not reveal anything else. There’s no word of when this 60 FPS patch might go through, nor is there a definitive guarantee it will happen – just Ubisoft’s assertion that it’s “looking into adding 60 FPS support for Assassin’s Creed Origins.”

After that, read about the now-live crossover between Assassin’s Creed Odyssey and Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, and then check out Game Informer’s ranking of all Assassin’s Creed games.

                    <span>Konami has announced that its upcoming free-to-play card game, Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel will launch with crossplay cross-save support. 
This news comes from Nintendo Life, which reports that Konami announced this news alongside many other features players can expect in Master Duel during the Jump Festa 2022 event recently held. The game is not yet out, but it’s expected sometime this Winter, which means its release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, PC, iOS, and Android could be imminent. For now, you can check out its official trailer.

As noted by Nintendo Life, duelists can expect the following features in Master Duel: 
4K resolution duels
Over 10,000 cards to unlock across the series’ history 
A Solo Mode campaign
Deckbuilding and a large database with Decklists
Tutorials to teach players how to play 
Special events and tournaments 
Because of today’s news, duelists can now expect to be able to play their Xbox-owning friend while on a PlayStation, for example. Or, they could play on their mobile device while their opposition plays on PC, thanks to Master Duel’s crossplay support. And thanks to cross-save support, players can freely switch between platforms. You can play primarily at home on a console or PC and then take your progression with you on the go via your mobile device. 
While waiting for Master Duel, read about its reveal and the reveal of Yu-Gi-Oh! Rush Duel Saikyou Battle Royale that happened alongside it. Check out why one Game Informer editor believes Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel might finally be what fans are looking for after that.

Even twelve years after its initial release, League of Legends stands atop the esports pantheon as one of the most popular competitive games in the world. Ruined King: A League of Legends Story takes several of the beloved MOBA’s notable characters and drops them into an entertaining, albeit overlong, role-playing experience. Skill-based progression, explorable hubs, and turn-based combat might immediately excite fans of developer Airship Syndicate’s debut project, Battle Chasers: Nightwar. However, Ruined King’s implementation of these features is often mediocre. Nevertheless, the total package i…</span>

                    <span>Square Enix announced back in October that the pixel remaster of Final Fantasy V would be launching on November 10, and it did, with word that the pixel remaster of Final Fantasy VI would be coming next, naturally. 
However, many expected a December release, but now we know it’s coming later. Square Enix has now revealed that we can expect this remaster on PC, iOS, and Android in February, although a specific release date was not given.

“In order to bring you the best experience possible, we’re giving ourselves the necessary time to apply final polish while finishing development on the game,” a Steam post from Square Enix reads. “We’re adding some new items for those that pre-purchase either the game individually or have purchased the bundle. We’re looking forward to sharing the final title in our pixel remaster series with you all early next year and we hope you’re looking forward to it.” 
As far as pre-purchase items go, players will get Locke’s Theme (Timelapse Remix), The Decisive Battle (Timelapse Remix), Terra’s Theme (Timelapse Remix), Searching for Friend (Timelapse Remix), and Aria di Mezzo Carattere (Instrumental). They’ll also get two Final Fantasy VI wallpapers, and two more wallpapers from the pixel remasters of the first six Final Fantasy games.

Originally announced in 2016 for an early 2017 release under Steam&#x27;s now-defunct Greenlight program, you&#x27;d be forgiven for thinking that Blazing Strike was canceled. However, after years of fine-tuning the gameplay, seeking different methods of funding the project, and undergoing a full visual overhaul, Blazing Strike is finally poised to launch in 2022. I went hands-on with a recent build of it and came away impressed with how the game pays loving homage to the 2D fighters I grew up with in the &#x27;90s.
In late 2016, developer RareBreed Makes Games delayed the planned playable Steam demo indefinitely. Following an abandoned Kickstarter…</span>

                    <span>Hello folks. It&#x27;s been a funny old year, 2021. On the games side, it&#x27;s often felt like a year of shifting goalposts. Games that were delayed by the pandemic last year finally got their due in 2021, but in turn many of the releases we were expecting this year have inevitably slipped into 2022. The pandemic has affected games of all sizes this year, and I don&#x27;t think it will go down in the history books as one of our all-time greats. There were still plenty of fantastic games that came out this year, mind, and we&#x27;re still counting down our absolute favourites over in our Advent Calendar. 
That said, I do think 2021 will prove to be a pivotal year for RPS - and not just because I stole Graham&#x27;s key card and changed the locks on the front door of the Treehouse. It&#x27;s been a year of immense change here at the site, so I wanted to take some time to reflect on everything that&#x27;s happened this year, and look forward to what we&#x27;ve got in store for 2022.

Developers EggNut have announced that a new Backbone game is coming in 2022, dropping us back into the snowy, animal-filled city. We don&#x27;t know much about it yet, but Backbone is an excellent detective puzzle game, and a gorgeous one at that, so I have high hopes for the next one.

I began The Gunk with eager anticipation, blasting across the swirling clouds of the cosmos. The opening cinematic is beautiful and full of promise. Unfortunately, it is also the apex of the short game’s trajectory. In a game filled with alien worlds splashed with color and populated with extraterrestrial mysteries, The Gunk falls surprisingly flat. Fortunately, this spacecraft manages to stay afloat with likable characters, solid gameplay, and a serviceable story.  
The Gunk’s heroes, Rani and Becks, are a pair of plucky and impoverished space haulers. They touch dow…</span>

                    <span>Another quarter of the year has passed, therefore another quarterly update from the Diablo IV team at Blizzard is upon us. This update on the demonic RPG focuses on some important topics like itemization and endgame progression.
It is important to keep in mind what is going on within Activision Blizzard at this time regarding ongoing allegations about the work culture. The ongoing lawsuit from the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) against the company is over reported toxic workplace culture. The bulk of the suit focuses on &quot;violations of the state&#x27;s civil rights and equal pay laws,&quot; specifically regarding the treatment of women and other marginalized groups.

                    <span>Update: Loop Hero&#x27;s time is done! The dino-battling FPS Second Extinction is the new freebie. 
Original Story: This year had us stuck in many video game time loops, but one of my absolute favourites was Loop Hero. I never thought an autobattler RPG would hook me the way it did, but I spent hours upon hours helping a little knight circle a seemingly endless void, and had a wonderful time doing it. If you didn&#x27;t have a chance to play it earlier this year, it&#x27;s now free on the Epic Game Store until tomorrow. I heartily encourage you to pick this one up, it&#x27;s one of our favourite games of 2021.

                    <span>The great thing about traditions is: you can just make them up. While some traditions feel more real because they&#x27;re embedded deeper in our culture, you can start your own whenever you want, and jettison any you don&#x27;t care for. Anything can be imbued with special meaning and, over time, grow into a tradition you cherish and come to anticipate. So here I am, approaching Christmas, so ready for my annual play of Skeal. Join me, reader dear.

                    <span>There’s no single, solitary reason why it’s been so hard to buy certain PC components over the past year and a bit – it’s more like a perfect storm of multiple circumstances, unfortunate coincidences and unforseen annoyances. That said, one of the biggest underlying causes of MIA CPU and graphics card stock has been a shortage of the chips needed to make them, and it’s a shortage that Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger has warned could likely continue into 2023.

                    <span>Oslain Brante tried to be a decent guy. Kind to his relatives except the one who murdered him. Resolutely loyal to his friends, even dying for one. Willing to die once again rather than betray his revolutionary allies. But it just kept going wrong for reasons that felt utterly artificial and sometimes deeply dissatisfying.
I&#x27;d have given up on the game if it weren&#x27;t so interesting. For one thing, none of those deaths were final. He died as a child and came back. He died as a teenager and came back. These were not saved games, but ordinary occurrences. It&#x27;s an interesting world made infuriating by awkward design choices.

                    <span>A new Cyberpunk 2077 mod makes the dystopian RPG&#x27;s decorative monorails functional, adding a metro system with cute wee trains you can ride. For all the game&#x27;s flaws, I did greatly enjoy wondering Night City&#x27;s streets, cooing at giant buildings and bright colours, and today I was glad to continue that tourism on rail. How lovely to see the megacity from a new perspective, looking down on rooftops and being buzzed by hovercars. See a wee bit of my journey in a video below.

                    <span>I’m rubbish at the building component of Minecraft; it’s much easier to simply download a map and wander around in the splendour of someone else’s creation. And if you’ve got the ray tracing beta version of Minecraft for Windows installed, I can heartily recommend you too take a wander through the Nvidia RTX Winter World: a vast, Christmassy and very, very pretty custom map that has you helping Santa throw a festive shindig while you trade sweets with his elves.

                    <span>The twentieth door on the RPS Advent Calendar this year is very small. In fact, it almost looks small enough to attach to someone&#x27;s head, if you were the kind of weirdo who&#x27;d do that kind of thing.

                    <span>Supergiant Games&#x27; gay, Greek gallivant, Hades, is the first video game to receive a Hugo Award. The awards which celebrate literary works in the science-fiction and fantasy genres, added a special one-off &#x27;Best Video Game&#x27; category this year, which is where old Zagreus picked up his accolade. Our short king&#x27;s battle out of the underworld beat out its closest competition, cosy escapism simulator, Animal Crossing: New Horizons in the polls by almost fourfold.

Superliminal has added co-op, letting four of you jump into the world-bending puzzler together. The update dropped on Friday, and it seems that even your pals aren&#x27;t safe from the game&#x27;s forced perspective. They&#x27;ll appear in the world as little chess pieces, and from the looks of things you can pick them up to use as puzzle solving items.

A combination of competitive pricing, more user-friendly devices, and more fleshed-out VR games like Half-Life Alyx has seen headsets push deeper into the mainstream within the last 12 to 24 months.

V současných distribucích se nejčastěji používá mlocate, který stejně jako starší slocate ukazuje ve výsledcích pouze soubory, které by uživatel podle práv měl vidět.</span>

                    <span>I had some fun with the Wargame series of real-time strategy games, although past a certain point I couldn&#x27;t tell the difference between its umpteen historical tanks. Now developers Eugen Systems are making a spiritual successor called WARNO, which is coming to Steam Early Access next month.

This second series arrives almost exactly two years since the first, but work is already underway on the third. Showrunner Lauren Schmidt Hissrich says that season three&#x27;s scripts are &quot;almost done.&quot;

For those of you more skilled than me, the trailer comes alongside the news that the DLC will launch January 6th.

They&#x27;ve only been in training for three months? And they&#x27;re not even properly qualified? Oh no, what have we done...

Only kidding! I mean, statistically speaking I probably wouldn&#x27;t get on with all of you, but I actually really appreciate that you&#x27;re taking the time to read this and check out what games we&#x27;ll be playing this weekend. In fact, we&#x27;ll probably play loads of games over our breaks, but we&#x27;ll tell you about those later. Until I see you again, have a lovely time celebrating the end of the year, however you do it.

                    <span>Walking through the smoggy jerktown that is London a while back, the thought occurred that for all the building games I&#x27;ve played, I&#x27;d never seen one about remodelling an existing city. The closest I knew was NIMBY Rails, which isn&#x27;t even close.
It turns out I was miles behind the curve, as The Architect Colon Paris already exists.

                    <span>Earlier this year, Black Isle Studios and Interplay Entertainment announced they were porting the old 2001 hack and slash Baldur&#x27;s Gate: Dark Alliance to PC and consoles. It came out on PlayStation back in summer, alas they didn&#x27;t give a date for PC. But, surprise! It&#x27;s today! PC folks can finally try out the Baldur&#x27;s Gate that console users first experienced 20 years ago. I did a full playthrough this summer and had a lovely time, at the expense of my partner, who I made sit through one of the jankiest couch co-op games in existence.

But we (I) gather ourselves and chat FPS news, like how PUBG is going free to play, Overwatch actually has something new, and lots of Halo Infinite stuff. We also get one final update on Imogen&#x27;s Apex Legends rank. I&#x27;d love to say it&#x27;s positive, but it&#x27;s actually quite crushing. Merry Christmas.

                    <span>Remember when the Devotion developers Red Candle showed off a tiny snippet of a pretty 2D game they&#x27;d been working on earlier this year? They didn&#x27;t have much to say about it at the time, but last night they announced it properly. Named Nine Sols, it&#x27;s an action platformer with combat inspired by Sekiro. Honestly, they still don&#x27;t have much to say about it beyond that, but they have released a gorgeous poster featuring a cat-like character that you can see in full below.

                    <span>You know what Christmas was missing? The unmatched fear of being chased by terrifying killer robots through a shopping mall. Five Nights At Freddy&#x27;s: Security Breach launched last night, inviting players to fend off a whole new crew of animatronics. This is the eighth mainline game in the long-running pizzeria-based horror series (I know, there are loads of spin-offs too), and for the first time it will let players properly roam free, rather than be tied to a desk monitoring cameras.

To celebrate the first flakes of glimmering ice wafting out of the sky like God&#x27;s own sub-zero dandruff, here&#x27;s a list of the best snow in PC games. Put on a hat, for heaven&#x27;s sake.

                    <span>They say the best things come in small packages, which is clearly nonsense in a world where giant novelty cheques exist but giant novelty bills don&#x27;t. When it comes to price tags, however, the smaller the better rings true, especially when it&#x27;s a full 50% off a quality gaming keyboard like the Corsair K65 RGB Mini.

                    <span>V úterý Steam vydal aktualizaci hry Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CSGO) s experimentální podporou Vulkan v Linuxu. Podpora funguje přes DXVK-Native, který překládá Direct3D do API Vulkan. Hru je potřeba spustit s parametrem -vulkan. Podobně již byly přetransformovány hry Portal 2, Left 4 Dead 2 a Half-Life 2 což je příprava na Steam Deck.</span>

                    <span>Transparent huge pages (THP) zrychlují práci s pamětí v Linuxu, protože umožňují pro aplikace transparentní použití velkých stránek paměti (na amd64 2 MB a u novějších procesorů 1 GB) místo výchozích stránek (u amd64 4 kB). THP je možné nastavit na never, always a madvise. Nastavení always může některé aplikace zpomalit, proto je často v distribucích výchozím nastavením madvise, tedy záleží na aplikaci, jestli při alokaci paměti použije madvise a tím dá najevo, že by použití velkých stránek mělo pomoci.</span>

Aghanim from last year&#x27;s Aghanim&#x27;s Labyrinth event has returned, and this time a &quot;multiverse-melding mishap&quot; has split him into several doppelgängers players must rescue. The event mode is free, but it arrives alongside a new battle pass that&#x27;ll cost money to enter.

More strangely, today&#x27;s update also introduces experimental gamepad support.

They&#x27;re starting with one that I&#x27;m certainly curious enough to play for free but not buy: Shenmue 3. Yeah gwan, I&#x27;ll grab that. Epic are also going wild with coupons again, giving a £10 (or $10) coupon on every game you buy which costs at least £13.99 (or $14.99). Given Epic&#x27;s habit of paying for timed exclusives, they do have discounts on some games you&#x27;ll not get elsewhere, or at least not with those vouchers.

                    <span>Let me slap you with the caveat up front. Halo Infinite&#x27;s best place is its open world, through which you can swing like a honking metal Tarzan and do sweet Warthog jumps from cliffs. But its best level, the most satisfying A-to-B gun boulevard, comes late in the campaign (spoilers ahead). The House Of Reckoning is a series of rooms where contrived artificial battlefields have been constructed inside an alien fortress. They are abstractly human structures surrounded by sand, as if your extraterrestrial enemies have been playing house but believe a homo sapiens&#x27; house looked exactly like a chunk of Normandy beach circa 1944. The narrative reasoning behind this level is absurd. But the fights that occur within are excellent.

                    <span>God rest ye merry listener, let nothing you dismay - for today, for one night only, EWS stands for Electronic Wrestling Show. Yes, our podcast&#x27;s wrestling promotion has rolled into your town for a showstopping tag team match. Each of your pod hosts fields a three-game tag team of our favourite games of the year, and fields them in a spectacular(ly described) ladder match. The victor will claim the GOTY In The Bank briefcase and win the chance to compete next year as well.
Before we get to that, though, we must first discuss (at length) whether 200 t-shirts is a lot of t-shirts, what Nate is having for his Christmas dinner, what kind of cop duo would be named Halloumi &amp; Date, and also what our favourite Christmas songs are. Nate also does a really good Mankind pun. Plus: which wrestler would be the best hugger?

                    <span>If your PC&#x27;s drive space is fuller than Mr. Creosote, it might be time to call in some external backup. You can currently grab the WD Black P10 external hard drive in its vast 5TB configuration for a very reasonable £97 - it won&#x27;t be able to hold any wafer thin mints, but 5TB makes room for an awful lot of game installs.

                    <span>I’m beginning to think I need a dreamcatcher. The Lynx Africa on my bedroom shelf simply doesn’t have the same level of nightmare suction. In fact, I bet it attracts bad sleeps. Anyway, I’m considering the installation of a feathery net because DokeV’s music video from the latest Geoff Awards has infiltrated the darkest recesses of my brain again. I thought I’d shaken off the trailer song, but it’s back with full force and haunts me more than ever.

                    <span>Final Fantasy VII Remake certainly knows how to make a good first impression. The original&#x27;s bombing mission sequence, which sees Cloud and co. blow up a planet-killing mako reactor in the industrialised hellhole of Midgar&#x27;s city centre, was already one of the Final Fantasy series&#x27; best openers, but here we get to really luxuriate in every last detail of its twenty-four-year glow-up. Director Tetsuya Nomura may have a reputation for excess in JRPG circles (both in his tangled storylines and his passion for buckles and belts), but in FF7R that tendency toward indulgence has been applied with deadly, laser-like precision.

                    <span>CD Projekt have announced plans to pay out $1,850,000 (£1.4 million) to settle a class action lawsuit brought by investors over Cyberpunk 2077&#x27;s troubles. The suit started in December 2020 with investors primarily upset with the fact that the console version was in such a state, claiming that CDP hadn&#x27;t been honest about the game and its prospects. CDP say that the proposed settlement terms make clear that though they are paying out, this &quot;does not imply admission of any responsibility&quot;.

                    <span>It’s been nearly a year since Nvidia started reissuing older GPUs, like the GeForce RTX 2060 and GeForce GTX 1050 Ti, to help deal with the great worldwide graphics card shortage. More recently, Nvidia went a step further, quietly launching a brand new version of the RTX 2060 that doubles its VRAM to 12GB.


Emphasis on the “quietly”, mind – even if you’ve been regularly checking for available GPU stock or perusing our graphics cards deals guide, you probably won’t have even noticed there’s a 12GB RTX 2060 knocking around. So what’s the deal with this mysterious card, and should you even consider buying an RTX 20 series card in this day and age?

                    <span>The Gunk might not be the most sophisticated name in the universe for a gooey black jelly that pulses with an ominous red light, but goodness it sure is appropriate. As space haulers Rani and Becks touch down on a forgotten planet in search of a strange energy signal, the place is absolutely gummed up with the stuff. It oozes and throbs in the caves, plains and rivers of this once vibrant landscape, and the urge to suck it all up into Rani&#x27;s chunky power glove (a literal hand vac in this case) is overwhelmingly strong. After all, when it turns the ground black and saps the world of all its colour, this is one case of Extremely Bad Vibes you&#x27;ll want to remedy as soon as possible. 
Your reward for scooping up all the gunk in any given area is the kind of graphical wizardry video games do best. A burst of light, a shruum of sound, and the world is instantly transformed back to its former glory. Despite its gloopy namesake, The Gunk is frequently stunning, its soft pastels and coral-esque flora showing such an eye for jaw-dropping visuals that it&#x27;s hard to believe this is SteamWorld developer Image &amp; Form&#x27;s first ever 3D video game. If this is what they&#x27;ve been holding back on all these years, then their upcoming action adventure SteamWorld Headhunter should be a real treat for the old eyeballs. That said, while Image &amp; Form have clearly navigated their 2D to 3D transition from an art perspective, their typical flair for adding their own spin to different genres has been less successful. There&#x27;s a lot to like about this 3D action platformer, but it&#x27;s missing that spark to really make it sing.

This latest OlliOlli game swaps out the 2D style for a cel-shaded 3D world that looks absolutely lovely. Or radical. Or sick. Or other skater words. The action-platformer&#x27;s plot sounds great too, it drops you into Radlandia on a search for the skate gods. Skate gods! Don&#x27;t anger them, kiddos, they&#x27;ll break your collarbones.

                    <span>Here I was thinking Tetris 99 was the strangest game to be turned into a battle royale, but now you can fight to the death in Scrabble too. Babble Royale is a new Scrabble-like battle royale where 16 players fight to be the last letters standing. You have to make words in such a way that you escape a zone that&#x27;s closing in, and attack other players by building words off of theirs. I honestly didn&#x27;t think it would work, but man, it absolutely does.

Despite updates to ease server errors and long queue times, players are still struggling to log into the game. So, Square Enix have only gone and done it. They&#x27;ve temporarily suspended sales of the game, as well as new registrations for the free trial version. Even adverts are being stopped for now.

                    <span>After eight years of radio silence, Ubisoft are finally bringing Sam Fisher in from the cold, as they&#x27;ve just announced a remake of the original Splinter Cell. In keeping with the series&#x27; stealth roots, the game was announced with little to no fanfare this evening via a blog post, with Ubisoft declaring its existence along with some developer chat before scampering back into the shadows. Typical.

                    <span>It&#x27;s not often those Nintendo Directs have PC-related news for us, but today&#x27;s announceathon had a little treat. Loco Motive is a train-based detective game published by Chucklefish (who also pubbed Stardew Valley and Starmancer), and is the debut game from developers Robust Games. There&#x27;s been a murder! And it&#x27;s your job to figure out who committed the crime. Classic whodunnit stuff that we&#x27;ll get to play next summer.

                    <span>If you fancy escaping from reality in 2022 (and let&#x27;s face it, who wouldn&#x27;t at the moment?) You can grab the excellent HTC Vive Cosmos Elite VR headset kit for £649. That&#x27;s £250 off the list price, as well as a return to the price that the full VR kit was going for on Black Friday. Surely, this is a sweeter deal than Tom Cruise&#x27;s Christmas cake.

                    <span>Nerves have been sufficiently jangled as of late, not least thanks to the slew of action packed games that have landed in recent months. I crave an altogether more sedate beginning to next year, and so my mind turns to games in which violence, reflex or any other kind of unblinking attentiveness takes a back seat. 
Looking for a broader mixture of games? Check out our regularly updated list of the best PC games you can play right now.
Primarily we&#x27;re talking violence-free games here, but I wanted to drill a little deeper than that - so nothing that generally requires a competitive streak. I&#x27;m chasing a certain feel rather than a certain category. Flying, walking, puzzling, driving, building, dreaming, climbing, stretching, swinging (not like that), swimming, wondering: these are just a few of the ways in which flashing pixels can make you feel a very different sort of accomplishment.

                    <span>I really don’t like gaming chairs. They’re expensive, often cumbersome, drastically over-designed things that lean way too heavily into the g4m3r aesthetic, and that’s coming from someone who’s built up something of a tolerance to it from years of unprotected RGB exposure. I’ve sat on them and have even shared homes with some of them, but have never, ever seen the appeal over a halfway decent office chair.


And then the Noblechairs Epic TX comes along, and it’s got me rethinking.

                    <span>Christmas is coming, PC gamers. The Untitled Goose is getting fat. Somewhere in the distant north, a scarlet priest works his elven minions into a frenzy as he prepares for the rite of the magic baby. Sprouts will be consumed in their millions, the Great Escape snoozed through by bloated grandparents far and wide. Most importantly, gifts of roughly equivalent financial value will be exchanged to demonstrate affection and prolong the reign of capitalism.

                    <span>I’ve been hands-on with Sifu, a beat ‘em up action-adventure game by Absolver developers Sloclap. My hands weren’t exactly “on”, but more “around”, actually. That’s one thing I learned from my time with this kung-fu caper. To keep my fists flowing, I needed to be patient, and not mash the buttons. Seriously, slap those buttons with zero thought and you’re dead.
Death in Sifu means you age, and if you die lots, you age faster. Hit 70 and you won’t be rising from the dirt again. Instead, you&#x27;ll have to start your quest for vengeance over from the beginning. While it can be tempting to cling onto your youth for this reason alone, I actually liked growing old, with my beard and my harder-hitting attacks. Not only do you develop a relationship with your body in Sifu, but your trips to the afterlife also help you master its myriad of moves. Sifu really does get better with age.

Okay, so actually we don’t have much time left now. You must play these beat &#x27;em ups before they disappear into the realms of non-free (sort of; you know what I mean). Here’s why.

                    <span>One of my absolute favourite platformers, Rayman Origins, is free to keep on Ubisoft Connect right now. Ubisoft are giving the 2D side-scroller away as part of their 35th anniversary celebrations, which is wonderful news. It&#x27;s one of the best co-op games I&#x27;ve played, so it&#x27;s a perfectly timed freebie if you&#x27;re in need of something to keep friends and family entertained over the holiday period.

                    <span>Inscryption is, without a doubt, the best game I&#x27;ve played this year. It&#x27;s creepy, surprising, and superbly fun, and now you can play the best part for as long as you please. Developer Daniel Mullins has released a &quot;mini-expansion&quot; in beta on Steam, which (minor spoilers ahead!) makes its animal-based card game a standalone roguelike experience. Named Kaycee&#x27;s Mod, it&#x27;s slightly tougher than what you might have played already, and adds new challenges too, so you can keep going back in for more.

                    <span>When I finished watching The Game Awards reveal trailer for Rumbleverse, the new Epic-published battle royale game that looks a bit like Fortnite but with melee combat, I raised a practiced eyebrow of derision. &quot;Well, that looks terrible,&quot; chortled I, knowing full well that I&#x27;d still give it a go at the earliest opportunity because I am an absolute sucker for battle royales.
Two things happened later that day that I did not expect. First: I got the opportunity to dive into Rumbleverse&#x27;s action-packed 40-player matches far earlier than I&#x27;d anticipated, as part of a one day early look at the game. I downloaded and installed it in short order, and jumped right in. Two hours later, at 1am in the morning as the servers shut down, I happened across a second, far more unexpected thing. I found myself absolutely desperate to play more. I&#x27;ve sunk thousands of hours into Apex Legends, Fortnite, Plunkbat, Hunt: Showdown, Warzone, and various other behemoths of the genre. Yet those two hours I spent playing Rumbleverse might be the most fun I&#x27;ve ever had in a battle royale.

                    <span>Praey Of The Gods initially looks too similar to Shadow Of The Colossus for comfort. And then you think: why wouldn&#x27;t someone make another game where you climb and bring low gigantic beasts? After almost three years in early access, Praey has reached v1.0, adding two new boss battles in the process.

Now there&#x27;s a soundless gameplay trailer of Stargate in action, and ooh, it looks a lot like Commandos.

                    <span>Kingdoms Of Amalur: Re-Reckoning arrived late last year, offering a chance at re-redemption for the cult fantasy Re-PG. Now Re-Reckoning has received its first new expansion in nearly ten years. Called Fatesworn, it&#x27;s out now and offers a new, six-hour storyline.

                    <span>Come one, come all, and witness one of the coolest Minecraft homes I&#x27;ve ever bothered to help make. Look, I&#x27;m not usually a builder in survival crafting games. I&#x27;m an explorer (and frequent dier). But, with the Caves &amp; Cliffs Part 2 update that arrived last month, I&#x27;ve had a newfound purpose: create the coolest home I can find in the biggest cave I can find. And so I give to you, the upside down deepslate pyramid (located right beneath some festive tundra!)

                    <span>Like many people, I&#x27;ve had a difficult year. My dad died, an uncle died soon after, and everything is a lot, you know? Even in the best of years, I find Christmas challenging. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m filling my ears with the maximalist sounds of a song which knows true suffering, a song from a fictional musician in a video game. Reader dear, it&#x27;s that time of year: if you&#x27;ve not already started, pour a cocoa and join me for Christmas Pain In Christmas Town.

                    <span>Peter Molyneux&#x27;s 22cans studio have sold around £40 million of NFTs for their &quot;blockchain business simulator&quot; Legacy, before it&#x27;s been released. The town management game has its own cryptocurrency, of course, and this weekend they sold NFTs of virtual land for real money. The hope for crypto land barons is that they would be able to earn money back from other players through in-game business partnerships.

                    <span>Paralives Studio has given us all an early Christmas present, in the form of a look at Paralives&#x27; character creation tool. The video is pre-alpha footage and it emphasises that this is still a work in progress, but the character creator (called Paramaker, a name chosen by the game&#x27;s community) looks ridiculously detailed even so.
Paralives is a life sim game that may even have the chops to topple The Sims&#x27; supremacy when it launches. This video of the character creation is the beefiest look at Paralives we&#x27;ve had for a while. Marvel as the Paras change musculature, fat distribution and weight before your eyes. Importantly, you can give your Paras some sick tattoos and amazing patterned jackets, because what&#x27;s the point making a tiny puppet to play with if they&#x27;re not well cool?
