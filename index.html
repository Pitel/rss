Retro Fighters is coming out with a new version of the Brawler64, a modernized N64-inspired controller, and it should pair well with the Switch Online library thanks to its button placement. The Brawler64 Wireless Bluetooth Switch Edition is compatible with Nintendo Switch and PC and it&#x27;s currently drumming up support on Kickstarter.
That said, the crowdfunding campaign has 20 days left to go and the funding threshold has already been crossed with $12,000 pledged. It&#x27;s happening. Backers will get their orders shipped before retail customers, with an ETA of February 2023.
There are three colors — Classic Gray, Transparent Blue, and Arctic White — and the Brawler64 Switch Edition is tied to $45 pledges, …</span>

Do you wish more games followed in the footsteps of Monster Hunter, especially after big-budget hits like Monster Hunter: World and Iceborne? While Capcom has been on fire, there&#x27;s room for more, and EA of all companies is making a move with Omega Force.
Electronic Arts announced its partnership with Koei Tecmo for an Omega Force-developed hunting action game that&#x27;s set in &quot;fantasy feudal Japan.&quot; According to the companies, they are aiming to deliver &quot;the next great hunting game&quot; with this &quot;AAA&quot;-budget original IP.

                              <span>Bah gawd, that&#x27;s the PlayStation boot music
Sony is joining the list of publishers rolling out a showcase this week. A new State of Play is set to air tomorrow, September 13, with updates on all things PlayStation.
Announced just 24 hours ahead of its air time, the Sony State of Play will go live at 6 p.m. ET / 3 p.m. PT on Sony&#x27;s Twitch and YouTube channels.
In its announcement, Sony notes that the Tokyo Game Show is just around the corner. For the State of Play, Sony says to expect some updates from its Japanese partners, along with a &quot;few other surprises&quot; from developers around the world.
The show is expected to come in at about 20 minutes of reveals, new updates, and gameplay for 10 games. Platform-wise, Sony identifies the PlayStation 5, PS4, and PlayStation VR 2.

The week to come in showcase streams
This puts Sony at the opposite end of tomorrow&#x27;s news cycle from Nintendo, which is hosting its September Nintendo Direct at 7 a.m. PT / 10 a.m. ET.
In the week ahead, several more publishers and developers are planning streams for the Tokyo Game Show 2022. Square Enix, Capcom, Konami, Bandai Namco, and more will all host streams throughout the week.
As for what Sony still has to show, there are several games in its own studio pipeline. God of War Ragnarok is currently aiming for its launch in November, while other projects like Insomniac&#x27;s Marvel games are further down the line.
Japanese partners could cover a broad swath as well. Square Enix has made several State of Play appearances, as has Capcom. With just about 20 minutes set for this Sony State of Play, across 10, it will probably be a pretty fast and to-the-point show.
We&#x27;ll see what Sony has in store for its September State of Play tomorrow, at 6:00 p.m. ET.

A bunch of players have been diving into Splatoon 3 this weekend, grinding for new levels, gear, and abilities. But make sure that you have the SplatNet 3 app handy, and you can access a bunch of extra goodies.
SplatNet is the Nintendo Switch Online companion app for Splatoon. For Splatoon 3 it&#x27;s SplatNet 3, and you can access it easily by just downloading the Nintendo Switch Online app and linking your account.
While a separate app might seem a little annoying, it&#x27;s a little extra work that opens up a ton of extra offers and goods.
SplatNet QR Codes
For one, the SplatNet 3 app can scan QR codes that unlock additional content. The Splatoon 3 team has already published one, which will give you a new banner for customizing your Splashtag…</span>

                              <span>Hot on the heels of the announcement of a long-awaited Nintendo Direct, PlayStation announced that tomorrow will also feature a special livestreamed presentation of its own. Now, in addition to that aforementioned Nintendo Direct tomorrow morning, we&#x27;re now also receiving a PlayStation State of Play stream in the afternoon.
The news comes as Tokyo Game Show looms, giving publishers a massive convention to piggyback off of. According to PlayStation, tomorrow&#x27;s show will feature updates from some of the company&#x27;s Japanese partners, as well as surprises from developers all around the world. Tomorrow&#x27;s presentation is set to last approximately 20 minutes and will feature new updates and gameplay footage from 10 games across PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation VR2.
This PlayStation State of Play stream is set for tomorrow, September 13 at 3 p.m. Pacific/6 p.m. Eastern. You can watch it live on PlayStation&#x27;s Twitch and YouTube channels. Of course, if you miss the show, we&#x27;ll have all the biggest announcements covered right here on Game Informer.</span>

                              <span>Disney had a big event last week that, I’ll be honest, I let wash over me. Announcements like Avatar games and Alien games that aren’t an Isolation sequel aren’t really for me. One thing they didn’t really cover, though, and which I wish they had done in a lot more detail, was the excellent news that classic…

You can count on FromSoftware to deliver memorable music, and if you&#x27;re in an Elden Ring mood but aren&#x27;t quite ready to commit to (yet another?) playthrough right now, you can at least soak up the vibes while going about your day-to-day. The Elden Ring soundtrack is now streaming on Spotify, YouTube Music, Amazon Music, Apple Music, and other platforms — here&#x27;s a handy catch-all link — and at 67 songs, it&#x27;s a big collection.

It&#x27;s the obvious pick, but thinking back, I can&#x27;t shake the game&#x27;s main theme. Ahead of a long journey, it felt so empowering and ominous. Every time I would start up the game, I&#x27;d just hover there on the menu, waiting for the music to hype me back up before continuing.

Mass Effect is one of those series that we&#x27;ve played so many times, sometimes it can be fun to load up a mod for the sake of switching things up a bit. You could always go for the expanded armory or expanded galaxy, or even try the Take Back Earth mod if you really want to make it interesting. Of course, I&#x27;m sure there are some crypto bros out there who are also Mass Effect fans, or at the very least, some people who want to try to game a stock market in a low-stakes environment. Or maybe they just hate the probing mini-game. Who&#x27;s to say?
Either way, this Mass Effect Legendary Edition mod might be for you. It&#x27;s called Nos Astra Mineral Exchange (created by beccatoria and Team Pyjak), and adds a whole galactic stock market to Mass Effect 2, which allows players to trade money and resources. (Thanks, PC Gamer.) Basically, you can either trade minerals and mine them, or just forgo the probing altogether.

There are also new missions attached to the mod as well, which include new voice lines for existing characters with AI dialogue tool xVASynth thanks to the work of modder Gaige Barker.
To gain access to the newly available stock market, players will first need to head to the Crescent Nebula, then to the Asari world of Illium, then to the capital city of Nos Astra, and then finally to the docks entrance where public trading terminals can be found. There&#x27;s also a terminal on the Shadow Broker&#x27;s ship, if that&#x27;s more convenient.
The mod&#x27;s site even details the Mass Effect 2 stock market&#x27;s exchange rate, which is the kind of thing I don&#x27;t really get, but go nuts if you&#x27;re into that sort of thing. Nos Astra Mineral Exchange is available to download on NexusMods or Mod DB — just make sure you have the ME3 Tweaks Mod Manager ready to go first.

Retro-loving publisher City Connection has announced that it is to publish a newly developed remake of obscure arcade release Psychic 5. As reported by Gematsu, Psychic 5 Eternal is currently in development for Nintendo Switch and will be playable during this week&#x27;s Tokyo Game Show festivities.
Originally developed by NMK and released to Japanese arcades in 1987, Psychic 5 sees a party of cute anime characters navigate a maze filled with hazards and perils, en route to a showdown with the nefarious Demon King. While all five characters have their own playstyle, gameplay places heavy emphasis on the smart control of incredibly &quot;floaty&quot; jumps, which require the player to glide their chosen hero around the various traps and obstacles that stand in their way.

The odd little adventure would not receive a home port and was rarely seen outside its native Japan, but has garnered a devoted fanbase in modern times, with fans attracted to its tricky gameplay and fun aesthetic. Psychic 5 Eternal — developed by CRT Games — will sport improved visuals, a new widescreen option, co-op two-player action, and a fully rescored soundtrack, handled by the original composer, Shinichi Sakamoto. Players will be able to switch between the remastered and original versions of the game on a whim.
Psychic 5 Eternal is currently in development for Nintendo Switch. Given that it will be playable at Tokyo Game Show later this week, one would assume that an announcement of its release date should be relatively forthcoming.

A new Fall Guys season is taking off this week, and it&#x27;s headed for the stars. Fall Guys launches Season 2 this week, dubbed Satellite Scramble, goes live on September 15.
As you can guess, this new season is all galactic. Space-themed variations of other Rounds found in Solos, Duos, and Squads will roll out, as will some new Costumes and Challenges.

A mission to repair the Fall Guys satellite can net a few rewards: a Space Bean nickname, some Kudos, a Satellite Explorer nameplate, Space Icons pattern, and a Satellite backpack at the highest tier.
But the big attraction, of course, is the new Rounds. Several new levels will join the Fall Guys rotation.

Valve has announced that its Steam Deck Repair Centers are now fully operational and anyone encountering any issues with their expensive handheld hardware can now send it away for evaluation and repair — though the publisher was quick to add that you probably would never need to, of course.
&quot;If you encounter an issue and need to send your Steam Deck for repair or replacement, devices will now go to one of our repair centers,&quot; writes Valve in a statement on Steam. &quot;Once there, our team will diagnose the device, repair if needed, then ship the fixed unit back to you.&quot;
If your issue is covered by warranty, then the team will repair your Steam Deck free of charge and whisk it back to you. Should your warranty have expired, then the team will contact you to discuss any issues found with the device and come to an agreement on what is to be done to get the powerful piece of kit fully operational and back in your hands once again. Of course, some problems will not be covered by the free repair scheme.
&quot;If your dog gnaws on your thumbstick and breaks it, this is not covered by warranty,&quot; offers Valve as an example. &quot;Previously your only option was DIY repair, but now you&#x27;ll now be able to contact support, who will supply instructions to ship your Steam Deck to one of our repair centers. Our team will take a look and offer to replace and calibrate your thumbstick for a fee.&quot;
So better keep ol&#x27; Fido away from your purchase.
The Steam Deck, essentially a powerful handheld PC, launched earlier this year and has since been rolling out units to its pre-order customers. Valve has handled the launch well for the most part, and has increased the rapidity with which it has been fulfilling its orders over the summer months. If you wish to place your name on the reservation list, or for more details about the hardware, check out the official store page.

You never know what games will pop up in it months before they&#x27;re ever announced for a worldwide release. Case in point: Loop 8: Summer of Gods. Originally revealed during the Japanese Direct back in February, Xseed announced today it&#x27;ll be localizing the title early next year with a new Loop 8 trailer that showcases the game&#x27;s new English voice acting.
Loop 8 will put players in control of Nini, a young man raised on a space station who is sent to the quaint country town of Ashihara for the month of August. Demons are threatening to destroy this little slice of paradise, and it&#x27;ll be up to Nini and his friends to stop the demons and save Asihara, …</span>

                              <span>From a lacerated sky
Saber Interactive&#x27;s Evil Dead: The Game gets its most exciting update since its launch today, with the arrival of the Evil Dead 2013 DLC Pack, now available to download on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox.
The new DLC sees Mia and David Allen, sibling stars of Fede Álvarez&#x27;s great pseudo-remake, join the roster of Survivors as Warrior and Support class players, respectively. Mia — marvelously portrayed in the movie by Jane Levy — is a fearsome Deadite slayer when up close and personal, and sports a trait that sees her damage actually increases as her fear level rises. Mia can also unleash her own Deadite nature, as one of the few humans ever to survive Deadite possession. Check her out in the trailer below.

As a Support class character, David provides a central beacon of unwavering strength and hope for his teammates. David is equipped with healing abilities — for both himself and his brethren — and is also able to severely reduce the fear of characters in his vicinity. Much like in the brutal movie, David is equipped with a violent nail gun, as well as, somewhat more hilariously, dual-wielding syringes. These new weapons are also readily available for use by other Survivors.
In addition to the two new characters, the DLC bundle includes a new single-player mission, &quot;Weekend at Knowby&#x27;s,&quot; which is loosely based on the events of the movie. This mission features a variant of the Knowby Cabin, complete with the terrifying blood storm that concludes the film. A brand new screamer, (which remains an obnoxious and weirdly cheap-looking element of the game), is also included in the new bundle.
Evil Dead: The Game is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox. A Switch port is reportedly in development, though, admittedly, news has been particularly quiet on that front for some time now.

                              <span>The longtime Halo lead is leaving due to a family medical issue
343 Industries founder and lead Bonnie Ross is leaving the Halo Infinite studio. After 15 years leading 343 at Microsoft, Ross has officially confirmed her departure.
The studio head has said she will be leaving the company to attend to a family medical issue.
Here&#x27;s the statement in full, via social media:
While I had hoped to stay with Halo until we released the Winter Update, I am letting you know I will be leaving 343 and attending to a family medical issue.
I am incredibly proud of the work everyone at 343 Industries has done with Halo Infinite, the Master Chief Collection, the Halo television series and so much more. It has been an honor to serve alongside the team for the last 15 years and to be a part of a universe I love.
Thank you to everyone in the Halo community for your support. Halo&#x27;s future is bright. I cannot wait for all of you to experience what we have in store - and to cheer alongside you, as a fan, at the Halo World Championship in October!
Axios,
Bonnie Ross

The Halo rolls on
Ross has a long legacy at Microsoft, having worked on a number of franchises over the years leading up to 343 Industries. She helped found the new studio 343 Industries in 2007. Under her leadership, 343 released The Master Chief Collection, an initially rough launch that managed to right the ship and become quite a stellar collection.
With Halo Infinite experiencing similar pains now, it will be interesting to see how 343 forges ahead. According to a statement via Windows Central, Pierre Hintze will immediately step in as studio head. Bryan Koski will take on the role of GM of Franchise. Elizabeth Van Wyck steps in to oversee business and operations.
With a Winter Update coming soon and more on the horizon, there&#x27;s still more to do for Halo Infinite.

                              <span>Nintendo will be going hard on this sequel
Given the rapid release of the Splatoon 3 and Pokemon Scarlet and Violet OLED models, this Zelda: Breath of the Wild 2 OLED mockup (via vragal on Reddit) sounds super probable as something Nintendo might release in 2023.
Billed as a faux &quot;special edition,&quot; the box even has the detail of &quot;not including the game,&quot; but does sport a fan-made white Zelda OLED Switch dock (presumably with the LAN cable functionality), as well as two special Joy-Con themed around the series with a gold and green color scheme. Remember, there is a real Zelda Joy-Con set, via the Skyward Sword re-release.
Switch mockups are among my favorite things to gander at, mostly because so many of them could actually become reality. With how experimental Nintendo is, any given first-party franchise could see some sort of special edition release, all the way up to a hardware revision. Sadly, since we&#x27;re out of the age of the 3DS, we&#x27;re not going to get too many of those crazy projects.
Remember when the 3DS was alive and well, and Nintendo came out with some sort of new model multiple times a year? Fun times. That practice dates back all the way to the original Game Boy, but I miss having a dedicated handheld in the mix all the same.

                              <span>(Mostly based on characters who don&#x27;t wear shoes)
Iconic sportswear retailer Reebok is teaming with Capcom to produce a brand new range of footwear based upon the latter&#x27;s legendary fighting franchise, Street Fighter. The new Reebox x Capcom collection was revealed by Reebok Taiwan, and unfortunately may be exclusive to that territory.
The new range of sneakers is styled after some of the franchise&#x27;s most legendary World Warriors, including Ryu, Chun-Li, Dhalsim, M. Bison, and dopey edgelord Akuma. As far as licensed sneakers go, they&#x27;re actually pretty slick, with the super clean Ryu and Chun kicks looking crisp, while the brown and gold Dhalsim edition also shines. You can check out some of the new footwear in the images below, courtesy of Twitter user Petefighter.
https://twitter.com/PeteFighter/status/1568245638739132422?s&#x3D;20&amp;t&#x3D;BrSKVsqxXnSL2FBeNP5Lyw
In addition to the sneaker range, Reebok will also be offering up some basic apparel, including T-shirts, a pair of flip-flops, (or &quot;slides&quot; as y&#x27;all call them), and some casual track pants. Again, it seems that this entire range might be exclusive to Taiwan, so die-hard sneaker collectors will, unfortunately, have to go the import route if they wish to get their hands... erm... feets, on the cool-looking shoes.
This Reebok line is, of course, not the first time that Street Fighter and shoewear have collaborated. Previously, Capcom has teamed with Vans, Nike, Onitsuka Tiger, Converse, and many other apparel retailers to produce shoes and clothing based on its stellar series. Given the enduring nature of the franchise and its legendary characters, it seems to be a partnership set to run and run.

Ubisoft officially revealed Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage, its next installment in the franchise, over the weekend at Ubisoft Forward. But now it&#x27;s clearing up the details on a still-pending ESRB rating for Mirage.
Users spotted that Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage appeared on the Microsoft Store with an Adults Only 18+, or AO, rating. It previously showed an AO rating, for &quot;Intense Violence, Blood and Gore, Sexual Themes, Partial Nudity, Real Gambling.&quot; As of this writing, it has since moved to an RP, or Rating Pending, designation.
That AO rating also appeared on a VOD of the Ubisoft Forward livestream. In a statement to GamesIndustry.biz, the publisher says the rating is a mistake.

                              <span>One of the best acquisitions in company history
While Monolith Soft toils away at their beefy core RPGs they&#x27;re known for, they&#x27;re also helping Nintendo with various first-party titles. Every so often we get a glimpse of what games they actually help work on, like the Zelda series. As spotted by Nintendo Life, it seems like Monolith Soft added a new game to their repertoire on their company game list: Splatoon 3.
As the lengthy list points out, Monolith Soft has been assisting on many first-party Nintendo games, including prior entries in the Splatoon series. This is not unlike the relationship that a lot of other studios have with larger publishers, like High Moon Studios and Vicarious Visions assisting Activision with franchises like Destiny. This particular info drop that they worked on Splatoon 3 is fascinating though, given that it and the massive undertaking that is Xenoblade Chronicles 3 were released at basically the same time.
While the company started in 1999, it was taken over by Nintendo in 2007, and has been a staple studio at the publisher ever since. They&#x27;ve grown year after year, going from 150 employees in 2017 to roughly double that recently. As I&#x27;ve said numerous times, I hope they continue their run indefinitely. They&#x27;re an asset to Nintendo and aren&#x27;t celebrated enough.

Rainbow Six Siege, one of the most successful shooters in the history of the genre, is preparing to go pint-sized today, with the launch of the first closed beta for Rainbow Six Mobile, which go live presently on Android devices in select territories.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;ceKBhaJD41k&amp;t
Rainbow Six Mobile, essentially a scaled-down edition of the excellent tactical shooter Rainbow Six Siege, hopes to replicate the nail-biting five-on-five action as teams of Attackers and Defenders battle it out in order to protect or capture numerous objectives, all taking place against the backdrop of meticulously designed maps, where a single foot wrong will put your chosen operator out of commission. Siege is renowned for its exceedingly tense gameplay and reliance on strategy, teamwork, and lightning-fast reactions, which developer Ubisoft hopes will be reflected even on the smallest of screens.
Anyone willing to jump in on the action can sign up over at Google Play, in hopes of being invited to the party. It should be reiterated that the beta is currently on Android devices only, though an iOS equivalent is expected in the near future. The Rainbow Six Mobile beta is currently accepting players from the United States, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, India, Singapore, and the Philippines. So, unfortunately, European fans will have to stay frosty for the time being.

                              <span>At 7AM PT
A September Nintendo Direct is confirmed! It&#x27;ll be viewable here, and since a lot of people are keen on details, here&#x27;s the full rundown we got from Nintendo:
&quot;Tune in at 7 a.m. PT on Tuesday, Sept. 13, for a Nintendo Direct livestream featuring roughly 40 minutes of information mainly focused on Nintendo Switch games launching this winter.&quot;

Breaking the obvious down, this is a fully-fledged 40-minute non-indie Direct, which will likely focus on first-party games as well as &quot;partner studios.&quot; Also, it&#x27;s &quot;mainly focused on winter games,&quot; so the bulk will probably not feature titles slated for 2023 and beyond. Maybe we&#x27;ll get a final tease/stinger at the end for something like Metroid Prime 4.
They picked the right time to schedule it, as we&#x27;re heading into the fall/winter season, and Nintendo needs to start hyping that up. Also, it&#x27;s TGS week! So folks are already tuning into various streams and the like, and are ready for it.
What we could see in this Nintendo Direct
As for what&#x27;s launching the rest of the year, we have Bayonetta 3, as well as Pokemon Scarlet and Violet. It&#x27;s possible that Advance Wars could get some sort of update as well, even a new window, if not a surprise launch.
Then there&#x27;s Zelda: Breath of the Wild 2 and Metroid Prime 4, which aren&#x27;t of a &quot;mainly focused on games launching this winter&quot; sort; but are still things people have wanted updates on. A smaller-scale surprise eShop drop could be in the cards too, similar to HAL Laboratory&#x27;s instant-release projects.
A Mario movie update is a distinct possibility as well.

For the UK stream, Nintendo UK has provided the following statement:
&quot;As a mark of respect during this period of national mourning, we will not livestream tomorrow’s Nintendo Direct. It will be published as a video-on-demand on our YouTube channel at 16:00 (UK time) tomorrow.&quot;

                              <span>It&#x27;s a two-pack in the US
After a lengthy overseas pre-order period, the Steve and Alex amiibo are finally out in the US. They were released on September 9, and are available throughout the country in various retailers. As of now, they&#x27;re also available on the official My Nintendo Store (again, as a two-pack).
The figures themselves are true to the Minecraft series, but are less detailed (by design) compared to some of the more premium figures that have been released recently: like the carefully-crafted Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak line.
If you need to check with your retailer, here are the details for the two-pack:
SKU - 115856
UPC - 00045496893910
So what&#x27;s next for amiibo in 2022 and beyond?
After Steve and Alex, we have the Splatoon 3 amiibo trio confirmed for &quot;holiday&quot; of this year, with three figures in tow:
Octoling (Blue)
Inkling (Yellow)
Smallfry
Beyond that, Sephiroth is next up for the Smash wave, followed by Pyra/Mythra, then Kazuya, then (presumably) Sora. Once Sora potentially hits, the Smash Ultimate line will be fully complete, ending a journey that began in November of 2014.
Of course, it&#x27;s going to take a while for that to happen: at least until 2023, given the timeline between announcements and release for these figures. If you need a list to bookmark, we&#x27;ve been keeping track since everything started!

Mixed among the frankly suffocating wave of headlines rolling out of Disney this weekend was the curious, but not unwelcome news that The House of Mouse is to release a remaster of its 16-bit release Gargoyles, an action-platformer based upon the cult animated series of the same name.
Released in 1995 for the Sega Genesis, (the SNES version was canceled), Gargoyles was part of Disney&#x27;s major push into 16-bit gaming, which would see it adapt franchises such as Aladdin, The Lion King, The Jungle Book, and even Pinocchio (which nobody remembers) for home consoles. Gargoyles was one of the few 16-bit games that licensed a Disney TV show rather than a classic movie, albeit one with a very passionate fanbase.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;uF7KQjKC-1c
Gargoyles, which first aired in the fall of 1994, told the story of an ancient Scottish clan, cursed to live as stone creatures for all eternity until they are accidentally awoken after their castle is transported to modern-day New York. Now, under the shadows of the night, the Gargoyles protect the people of the city from crime, lawlessness, and corrupt capitalist David Xanatos. The show, much like Batman: The Animated Series, was praised for its melodramatic flair, darker tone, and character relations.
Details pertaining to the Gargoyles remaster are incredibly thin on the ground, but the title is expected to launch on PC and &quot;modern consoles&quot; at some point in the future. It was not made clear how far along the project is at this moment in time, so it looks like Gargoyles fans will simply have to return to their perch and wait for the coming of the moon.

Nintendo&#x27;s super-colorful, super-messy sequel Splatoon 3 has now been unleashed upon the public and is already proving itself to be an incredible sales success. In Japan alone, the Switch shooter has already shifted a staggering 3.45 million copies in its first three days of release, breaking previous Switch release records in the country. The news was broken in a weekend press statement by the publisher.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;-ODI00fgeS0
Launching on September 9, Splatoon 3 sees the return of madcap, team-based, multiplayer gameplay, as squid kids and octolings battle to out to capture territory across various modes and maps. Splatoon 3 features all of the paint-sloshing action that is the franchise&#x27;s trademark, set against a slightly more dystopian landscape — the aftermath of Splatoon 2&#x27;s final Splatfest favoring &quot;Chaos&quot; over &quot;Order.&quot;
But, despite the series&#x27; general popularity, I&#x27;m not sure that anybody was expecting the new sequel to be a record-breaker, having already become the fastest-selling Nintendo Switch title in its native Japan. It should also be noted that these figures do not include sales from Europe and North America, which will no doubt add to the incredible number and see Splatoon 3 nestle comfortably in place as one of 2022&#x27;s best-selling releases.
Splatoon 3 is available now on Nintendo Switch. Check out Chris Carter&#x27;s review right here.

                              <span>Following the launch of PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, multiple video game publishers bumped up the price of new-gen versions of some of their games. While Ubisoft resisted that trend to this point, CEO Yves Guillemot tells Axios in an exclusive interview that it is making $70 the standard price for bigger triple-A experiences published by the company. 
We already knew that the new-gen versions of Ubisoft&#x27;s long-in-development pirate game, Skull and Bones, would retail for $70, but now it appears to be the start of the standard pricing for Ubisoft. In that interview with Axios, Guillemot stated that &quot;Some of the games will come at the same price as the competition. The big AAA games will come at $70.&quot; 
In 2020, Ubisoft CTO Frédérick Duguet said that games released in 2020 would not reach the $70 mark (and they didn&#x27;t, outside of special editions). Then, last year, Duguet said, &quot;In terms of pricing, we&#x27;ve been analyzing the competitive dynamics of the past quarter, and we are still looking at new opportunities, but we have not made any decision yet.&quot; Today&#x27;s Axios interview with Guillemot is the first indication that Ubisoft has come to an official decision regarding its pricing.
Ubisoft is far from the only gaming company increasing prices. Publishers like 2K Games, Activision, and Sony have been selling select games for $70 since the introduction of the new consoles in 2020. Meanwhile, just last month, PlayStation announced it was raising the price of its PlayStation 5 consoles in select, non-U.S. markets. Skull and Bones, the first $70 Ubisoft title, is set to launch on November 8. It&#x27;s worth noting that new-gen versions of Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage are currently listed on retailer websites for $50.

                              <span>When Danny Peña was a child, he would spend hours playing games at his local New York arcade before he received his first console, an Atari 2600, from his grandmother. Peña knew early on that he wanted to do something in the games industry, but he didn&#x27;t know what. All along the way, he was told that video games won&#x27;t pay the bills, but he didn&#x27;t let that deter him. Flash forward a couple of decades, and Peña returned to New York to show his mother a billboard featuring his face in Times Square – a monument to his success in the games industry, but not one that was easy to achieve. Now, with a new children&#x27;s book called Danny Loves Video Games about his life and career set to release this week, I sat down with Peña to chat about his road to this point.
While the 2021 Times Square billboard…</span>

The news comes by way of Ross&#x27; Twitter account, which mentions that she wished to stay with Halo until the upcoming Winter Update, but she is leaving the studio amid a family medical issue. 
Since the studio&#x27;s founding in 2007 under Ross, 343 Industries has worked on several Halo games, including Halo 4, Halo: The Master Chief Collection, Halo 5: Guardians, and Halo Infinite. The studio fully took over the Halo franchise following Bungie&#x27;s departure from the brand after 2010&#x27;s Halo: Reach. Ross oversaw the Halo franchise for Microsoft and Xbox ever since. She first joined Microsoft in 1994 and has worked on several projects in myriad roles, including stud…</span>

Metal: Hellsinger knows precisely what it is from the second it begins: a love letter to fast-paced first-person shooters, especially Doom, and a tribute to metal music and the culture surrounding it. It’s a no-frills shooter that asks, “What if you had to blow bodies to pieces to the beat of a metal album made by genre greats?” It excels at answering that question. It’s not perfect – the bosses are uninspired at times, and it could use an extra dash of variety in combat design – but my criticisms mattered little to my overall enjoyment of my 1…</span>

                              <span>Nintendo has revealed that it will livestream a Nintendo Direct tomorrow.
More specifically, the Direct will begin at 7 a.m. PT/10 a.m. ET tomorrow, Sept. 13, and it will run for roughly 40 minutes. That&#x27;s one of the largest Directs of the year, so it will likely be jam-packed with new looks at previously announced games and new ones, too (perhaps a Zelda port or two, if rumors about this Direct are correct). As for what to expect, Nintendo says the Direct will &quot;mostly&quot; focus on Switch games launching this Winter. 
Tune in at 7 a.m. PT tomorrow, 9/13, for a #NintendoDirect livestream featuring roughly 40 minutes of information mostly focused on #NintendoSwitch games launching this winter.

The key word here is &quot;mostly&quot; because that leaves just enough room for Nintendo to discuss and/or announce games coming next year. Only time will tell, but fortunately, we don&#x27;t have to wait long because the Direct is less than 24 hours away. 
If you&#x27;re in the U.K., please see the tweet below: 
As a mark of respect during this period of national mourning, we will not livestream tomorrow’s Nintendo Direct. It will be published as a video-on-demand on our YouTube channel at 16:00 (UK time) tomorrow.

                              <span>Splatoon 3 is already shaping up to be another hit for the franchise and Nintendo. Selling 3.45 million copies since Friday in just Japan, Splatoon 3 had the best launch ever for a Switch game in Japan, as reported by Eurogamer. 
This includes both digital and physical sales. It&#x27;s safe to say the squid (and Octoling) community are off to a great start with the threequel that&#x27;s exclusive to Switch. According to Eurogamer, however, despite the game also being number one on the U.K. boxed charts, as reported by GamesIndustry.biz, overall launch sales are down 9% compared to Splatoon 2 there. The U.K.&#x27;s boxed chart only included physical games, though, so it&#x27;s possible that decline isn&#x27;t present when digital games are taken into account. There&#x27;s no word on how Splatoon 3 is fairing in the U.S., but it typically follows trends in the U.K. 


&quot;Nintendo Co., LTD...announced that domestic sales of the Splatoon 3 game for the Nintendo Switch system have surpassed 3.45 million units in the first three days since launch on September 9, 2022,&quot; a Nintendo press release reads. &quot;This is the highest domestic sales level for any Nintendo software within the first three days.&quot; 
It&#x27;s no surprise Splatoon 3 is selling well in Japan and elsewhere – it&#x27;s great! And you can read about why in the Game Informer Splatoon 3 review.

For the current-flagship Intel Xeon Platinum 8380 &quot;Ice Lake&quot; processors, Ubuntu 22.10 does deliver some performance advantages over the current Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS release.

                              <span>Run &#x27;n&#x27; Rank!
This week marks the 30th anniversary of Contra III: The Alien Wars (or Super Probotector: Alien Rebels) on the SNES in Europe. That&#x27;s crazy, right? Despite Konami&#x27;s rather lacklustre attempt to revitalise the franchise with Contra: Rogue Corps in 2019, we here at Nintendo Life still have a spot in our hearts for the run &#x27;n&#x27; gun shooter series.
Starting with the original Contra back in 1986 as a coin-op arcade title, the franchise has since gone on to spawn a sizeable handful of sequels on Nintendo platforms. Since many of these are known by different names in Europe, it can often be a bit tricky to know exactly where to start (although Konami&#x27;s own Contra Anniversary Collection for the Switch goes a long way to rectifying this).

Due for launch on October 7th, 2022, the game will feature over 40 playable characters from Nickelodeon franchises, including SpongeBob Squarepants, Avatar: The Last Airbender, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

It&#x27;s happening folks, it&#x27;s finally happening! After keeping us in the dark for months on end (bar some rumours which had us convinced of its truth), Nintendo has today announced that it will be hosting a full Direct Showcase tomorrow (September 13th) at 7am PT / 10am ET / 3pm BST.
Thanks to word from Giant Bomb journalist and all-round rumour machine Jeff Grubb, we have been led to believe that there is going to be a lot of Zelda content for us to get into with this one. It seems likely that we will hear about Switch ports for either one or both of The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD and Twilight Princess, and could tomorrow finally be the day when we get to hear something more about Breath of the Wild 2? Just give us a title at least Nintendo, please!

Here at Nintendo Life, we&#x27;re big fans of Splatoon 3 — as if you couldn&#x27;t already tell from our glowing review — and while the lobby wait times can go on a little, being able to ink your surroundings and zip around is better than staring at a board while you twiddle your thumbs.
An update is on the way which should address any lingering connectivity teething problems players have been experiencing, but however zippy they may be, you&#x27;re still going to find yourself waiting in the Splatsville Lobby at some point. Seeing your fellow players in force-ghost hologram form is all well and good for the first few seconds, but what do you do when you are 100 seconds in? What about 200? What abou— well, you get the picture.

We miss Nintendo Selects. Nintendo&#x27;s budget marketing label was used to indicate the company&#x27;s best-selling titles that were sold at lower prices. Introduced in 2015 and used on Wii U and 3DS titles, every time we saw this little gold logo, we were always a bit excited to see those first-party titles at a reduced price. Sadly, this hasn&#x27;t made a return on the Switch or the eShop, but Nintendo seems to be reusing some of those assets in a bit of a cheeky manner.
Good friend of Nintendo Life Jon Cartwright spotted the &#x27;Team Picks&#x27; range over on the Switch&#x27;s eShop earlier today and rightly pointed out that the branding looks pretty darn familiar. The gold label, the little crown, and even the font are all reminiscent or taken from the Nintendo Selects marketing

After a whole bunch of rumours, Nintendo has officially announced a new Direct Showcase, scheduled to air on September 13th at 7am PT / 10am ET / 3pm BST. Nintendo UK has also announced that it will not stream the Direct as a mark of respect for the country&#x27;s current period of national mourning; as such, it will be published as a video-on-demand on its YouTube channel at 4pm BST. This won&#x27;t make any difference, of course, since the NA livestream will be available at the designated time.
The Direct will be approximately 40 minutes in duration and will focus primarily on games releasing this Winter.

Developed by The Chinese Room of Dear Esther and Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture fame, Little Orpheus sheds some – but not all – of the studio’s reputation for making games with a focus on engaging stories rather than gameplay. Fear not, the studio&#x27;s flair for an intriguing setup remains with its latest release inspired heavily by Russian folklore, leaving the question of whether or not Little Orpheus is any fun to play.
Little Orpheus begins with protagonist Ivan Ivanovich Privalov being interrogated by a man known as the General. You see, Ivan is a bumbling Soviet Cosmonaut who – having failed his exams and his physical – is sent on a massive drill to the centre of the Earth rather than the stars. Ivan went missing for three years, and now the General wants to know the whereabouts of the titular atomic bomb that helped power the drill. Ivan weaves an incredible story to stave off his execution at the hands of his increasingly irate interrogator.

After months of hints and talking about NFTs, Square Enix has finally become part of a blockchain. Gameindustry.biz reports that the Japanese developer and publisher has partnered with Oasys, which claims to be &quot;an eco-friendly blockchain built for the gaming community, offering the best user experience with fast transactions and zero gas fees.
The Final Fantasy developer will become a &#x27;validating node&#x27; on Oasys&#x27; upcoming blockchain. What this means is that Square will be responsible for maintaining records of blocks on the platform — it stores a copy of the blockchain and keeps the system secure. Square Enix is just one of 21 other companies joining Oasys, with both Sega and Ubisoft validating the service.

This weekend was marked by the release of Splatoon 3, and we must say, we just think it&#x27;s neat! Selling a record-breaking number of copies over its opening weekend, the game has been enjoyed by millions in its early days, with many agreeing that Nintendo&#x27;s newest splat sequel has a lot going for it.

However, just as positive as the opening reviews are, there have also been reports of the game crashing and players being hit with unwarranted connectivity issues. A brief glance over the r/Splatoon_3 Reddit forum sees players&#x27; issues being spoken about just as much as their joy of the game. From threads concerning errors when joining Anarchy Battles to one issue which seems to be wiping all Salmon Run progress at the end of the game, it is clear that for all of Splatoon 3&#x27;s success, the game is still left to deal with a few notable problems.

                              <span>Wrap it up.
With multiple indie developers taking up the Paper Mario mantle — in aesthetics and gameplay — Paper Animal RPG aims to do something a bit different with this crafty style. Developed by Cuddling Raccoons Studio, Paper Animal RPG is an utterly adorable take on the N64 Paper Mario&#x27;s visuals, leaning into the slightly-more pixelated side, but it mixes up the RPG side with roguelike elements.
Cuddling Raccoons launched a Kickstarter for the game a few weeks ago, and has smashed past its $40,000 goal, and as part of that campaign, the game has also secured a Switch release, which seems like the perfect home for this pixelated paper party.

Update:  - As promised, Dispatch Games has provided a bit more context around what the heck is happening with both the company itself and its products. It&#x27;s not a particularly comforting update, granted, but at least it&#x27;s not silence.
Chiefly, Dispatch’s “revoked” status as a company is addressed, as previously highlighted in the original article below. It states that this is a &quot;paperwork issue&quot; and &quot;should clear by next week&quot; (at the time of writing, nothing has been updated as of yet, so it&#x27;s still labelled as either &quot;revoked&quot; or &quot;suspended&quot;):

Ladies and gentlemen, the week! Welcome back to another Monday folks, but hey, it&#x27;s not all doom and gloom. Here we have the latest UK charts for you to take a look over and brighten your day being safe in the knowledge that a Nintendo title is once again at number one!
In case the title didn&#x27;t give it away already, this week sees the ink-redible rise of Splatoon 3, with the Switch&#x27;s newest shooter sequel coming straight in at number one in the charts (it&#x27;s also sold pretty spectacularly in Japan too, according to Nintendo!). We are elated to see the game performing so well. After our glowing 9/10 review described the game as &quot;the pinnacle of the series, and the pinnacle of shooters on Switch&quot;, we are pleased to see the UK sales reflect the game&#x27;s supremacy.

                              <span>Nintendo releases domestic sales figures.
To say the Splatoon franchise has become a breakthrough hit for Nintendo since its debut on the Wii U back in 2015 would be somewhat of an understatement. Although the first entry sold modest numbers, all told, its focus on fast-paced multiplayer with a unique spin resonated with fans worldwide and has since grown exponentially in popularity in the years since.
The latest title, Splatoon 3, has become the fastest selling Nintendo Switch game in Japan, according to Nintendo. In a post on its official corporate website, the company confirms that Splatoon 3 has surpassed an extraordinary 3.45 million units sold within the first three days domestically. This includes both physical and digital copies of the game.

                              <span>Fantasy action RPG Forspoken has been delayed more times than most games, although it’s finally pencilled in for a January release date. We’re still quite a way off from then, but Sony have released a smattering more gameplay footage today, detailing the moves you&#x27;ll be pulling as heroine Frey &quot;I&#x27;m seeing freaking dragons&quot; Holland. Alas, said footage has been crushed down to only a handful of GIFs over on the PlayStation Blog, but our friends at Eurogamer have a bigger, chunkier hands on preview that tells us more about why it won&#x27;t be mega cringe. Alas, we weren&#x27;t privy to this Forspoken demo, so have a watch with us below.

                              <span>I did a lot of talking at Gamescom, whether that be to developers or muttering to myself deliriously as I typed stuff up in the evening. Talking to devs especially is a wonderful thing, especially when you&#x27;re playing their game and it resonates with you. But getting hands-on with an early portion of American Arcadia rendered me virtually silent, to the point where I had to apologise to the devs for being so quiet.
And I wasn&#x27;t being rude; far from it! I was just so engrossed in the game&#x27;s mixture of side-scrolling platforming and first-person puzzling. Keep this under surveillance, because I think it&#x27;s going to be a real hit when it lands.

                              <span>Gloomwood is, so far, a very good game, but it is also not much of a game - in the literal sense that it has launched into early access incomplete. There&#x27;s currently just enough of it to play that it makes you feel both bereft and quite annoyed when it suddenly clangs its great iron doors shut in front of you. &quot;Let me in!!&quot; you scream, as you hammer on the silent portal. &quot;I really like Thief! I get you! I want to throw more decapitated heads as lures!&quot;
If you are one of those people who bases their gaming personality on liking the original Thief series, Gloomwood will have been on your radar for a while. It&#x27;s a grimy, steampunk-ish stealth immersive sim with a deliberate low-poly vibe, and it picks up the abandoned Thief football to absolutely run with it. But, though the current EA build is but short, it feels like Gloomwood is aiming to punt that ball into outer space. There&#x27;s so much more room to be playful and experiment than I expected, and it&#x27;s so much fun that if you&#x27;d never played a stealth sim in your life I&#x27;d recommend Gloomwood. Except I wouldn&#x27;t, because it feels like I&#x27;d be doing you a disservice to recommend it now, when the fun will be so quickly snatched away.

                              <span>It&#x27;s a very odd feeling, building a catapult all on your lonesome while watching fiery death rain down on your enemy&#x27;s castle in the valley below. I suspect it&#x27;s probably a similar experience to watching the carnage of Chivalry II play out from the safety of a nearby bench. The newly announced Warlander from Nier Replicant devs Toylogic certainly has the medieval setting in common with Torn Banner Studio&#x27;s first-person hack and slash, but this free-to-play multiplayer warfare game is an altogether different beast. You control your warriors in third-person, for starters, and its more cartoonish visuals allow for, well, daft cataclysmic events like a flaming meteor shower to hone in on a player&#x27;s position without appearing completely over the top. As it prepares to enter its first open beta later today, September 12th, I went hands on with a brief demo build to see what it was all about.

                              <span>&quot;Oh, come on!&quot; is a phrase you hear a lot in Sunday Gold. It&#x27;s often uttered by your knuckle-dusting healer Sally, and is invariably followed up by, &quot;You havin&#x27; a laugh, mate?&quot; and &quot;Facking hell!&quot; - partly because Sally is from Laaaandan and is thus obligated to speak lik&#x27; tha&#x27;, innit (because how else would you know this is a game set in Laaaandan), but also because the thugs, security guards and cybernetic dogs she&#x27;s often fighting in this seedy tale of corporate dystopia are some of the most frustrating enemies known to video games. The type who are seemingly resistant to every single weapon type in your arsenal, or who invariably have big, scripted healing sequences just when you&#x27;re about to nail &#x27;em. 
It&#x27;s a phrase I often found myself echoing while playing Sunday Gold for review, too, both during its tedious, war of attrition-style turn-based battles, and while trying to figure out some of its more obtuse puzzles. BKOM Studios have tried to fuse one too many things together in Sunday Gold, and the result is a messy, somewhat artificial blend of Deathloop&#x27;s style, Invisible Inc&#x27;s tension and a more action-led focus on the cerebral role-playing of Disco Elysium. There&#x27;s still much to admire in its stylish visuals and atmospheric music, but I also haven&#x27;t been this cross playing a video game since Felix The Reaper, and that&#x27;s saying something.

                              <span>Ubisoft’s subscription service doesn’t have the user-base of something like Microsoft’s Game Pass. Now, it seems, the French publishers are hoping that plonking in some indie games among its multitudes of Assassin’s Creeds and Tom Clancy shooters will attract a more varied clientele. They’re also running a free trial period for Ubisoft+ until October 10th, including for lapsed subscribers, so that’s something.

Pokud nemůžete nastavit PL1 a PL2 v Biosu, v Linuxu je možné použít powercap-utils a rozhraní Intel RAPL (Running Average Power Limit). PL1 a PL2 jde přečíst pomocí powercap-info a zapsat pomocí  powercap-set.</span>

                              <span>Ace Stream is a decentralized streaming tool with millions of users. The application, built on the VLC media player, doesn&#x27;t host or link to any content, but that hasn&#x27;t stopped rightsholders from complaining. In fact, the software&#x27;s website is currently blocked by ISPs in Spain, which is completely unjustified according to Ace Stream&#x27;s management.

The removal of Kiwi Farms will likely increase calls for voluntary curation of the web, and may reach way beyond Cloudflare. Domain registrars, registries, and ISPs may actually be better targets.

Super Smash Bros. Ultimate character DLC might have ended some time ago now with the addition of Sora from the Kingdom Hearts series, but Nintendo isn&#x27;t completely done with the game just yet.

Good morning, my dear friends, and welcome to Whatcha Been Playing? I hope that the week has treated you and yours kindly, and that the weekend brings you some cheer. I have little qualm in admitting that my week was weighed down by a particularly powerful bout of depression, the worst in many, many years. And, (because when it rains, it pours), I also dealt with a hospital visit, some work strife, a couple of ugly encounters, and a bathroom flood, the latter of which actually led to me breaking my glasses. What a comedy! The kind of comedy that leaves you in tears and requiring supervision!
But I do not want anybody to worry, and I appreciate that this column gives me the freedom to talk about weeks good and bad, both in and out of the digital sphere. It&#x27;s import…</span>

Paris. 1789. The Renaissance was so very long ago... Did it even happen?
Looking around the fallen capital, one would fairly assume not. The City of Lights, a place celebrated for its art, invention, culture, and architecture now resembles The Gates of Hell, a vision soon to be crafted by Rodin himself. The streets are awash with blood and bodies — innocent civilians, rebellious conspirators, and even the king&#x27;s own army lying in miserable piles of broken flesh.
And the king himself? This citywide massacre is his doing, the heart of his capital torn in two by a seemingly unstoppable army of robotic soldiers. Far from being the loyal guardians and entertainers of Paris, as initially designed, the automaton army has instead become her oppressor, stal…</span>

When discussing video gaming’s propensity towards violence, I often say, “ballistics are easy, discussion is difficult.” Simulating the path of a bullet has been part of the video game landscape for almost as long as it has existed. However, we still struggle with creating meaningful communication. We don’t often argue with the end boss, they’re usually not in a talking mood.
I’m always intrigued to see games make an attempt at simulating discussions. At the bottom rung, a game will have you pour stat points into charisma and maybe pair it with a dice roll. You only sometimes get games like Alpha Protocol, which has a smidge more nuance. You have to read the room to figure out how to shmooze your target (into bed, hopefully).

These are where you&#x27;ll send your handheld PC if it develops a problem, either so Valve can fix it free-of-charge if it&#x27;s still under warranty, or so they can diagnose the problem and quote you a repair price if it&#x27;s not. &quot;If your dog gnaws on your thumbstick and breaks it, this is not covered by warranty,&quot; say Valve.

This also provides a more complete implementation of Intel Thread Director for Linux and may also be used as the basis for instruction set differences between the performance and efficient cores...</span>

                              <span>As was leaked, and then hurriedly confirmed by Ubisoft about a week ago, the next Assassin&#x27;s Creed game to come out will be Mirage, in 2023. It&#x27;s not going to be quite the massive open world adventure &#x27;em up that the last few entries have been (don&#x27;t worry; one of those is on the way as well), but a more classic AssCreed experience to mark the series&#x27; 15th anniversary. This milestone has made me realise that the Creedsperience has taken up almost half of my current lifespan. Or, to put it another way, I fear that playing Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage may induce a pathetic but very real existential crisis in me.

To celebrate the doughty action-adventure&#x27;s 15th anniversary, senior community developer Alice Terrett was joined by a, to his credit, very excited Danny &quot;it&#x27;s the Daddy&quot; Wallace, to lay out an almost MCU-like timeline of every Assassin&#x27;s Creed thing happening for the next good while. It includes new DLC for Valhalla, and a mysterious horror-ish tease. But top of the list, after next year&#x27;s more trad and compact Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage, is Assassin&#x27;s Creed: Codename Red, the next big flagship open-world RPG for the series. And it&#x27;s set in feudal Japan.

                              <span>About a year ago we learned about the existence of something called Assassin&#x27;s Creed Infinity (or, more precisely, Project Infinity, but we&#x27;re all just calling it Infinity). The suggestion that Assassin&#x27;s Creed might become a live service online game akin to Fortnite was quite upsetting to me. Thankfully, VP executive producer on Assassin&#x27;s Creed Marc-Alexis Côté (aka MAC) appeared on tonight&#x27;s Ubisoft Forward livestream to explain more about Infinity, and I am slightly less alarmed but no less confused. Rather than a game, MAC says that Infinity is &quot;going to be the single entry point for our fans into the Assassin&#x27;s Creed franchise in the future&quot;.

As you may have guessed from the title of this post, it&#x27;s also on sale at Amazon for a very reasonable price: £59 gets you a 500GB model compared to a UK RRP of £101.

I don&#x27;t miss those 5am sunrises either. So we can surely all agree that the sensible course of action would be to lock sunrise to 7:30am and rotate the whole clock around that. Anyway! What are you playing this weekend? Here&#x27;s what we&#x27;re clicking on.

The September 2022 Ubisoft Forward was surprisingly filled with news, especially for Assassin&#x27;s Creed fans. But even those who don&#x27;t like to time-travel had something to see in Rabbids, BMX bikes, and mobile games.
Ubisoft laid out its short-term plans for several major franchises, before taking the back slice of the showcase to spotlight the big picture for Assassin&#x27;s Creed. It&#x27;s a pretty packed show, but we&#x27;re here to run down all the headlines for you.

                              <span>The Assassin&#x27;s Creed franchise is getting its hub
Today, Ubisoft laid out the road ahead for the Assassin&#x27;s Creed franchise. While it looks to a trip way back to Basim in Mirage, several other adventures are on the horizon, including a long-awaited jaunt to Feudal Japan.
During the Assassin&#x27;s Creed showcase portion of today&#x27;s Ubisoft Forward, the publisher confirmed its plans for Assassin&#x27;s Creed Infinity. This AC Infinity will act as a hub of sorts for Assassin&#x27;s Creed moving into the future, tying together all the different experiences and locales of Assassin&#x27;s Creed.
Several studios are working on projects for it right now. And as reported earlier this week, one of them is Ubisoft Quebec, which is working on something fans have likely been waiting some time for: an Assassin&#x27;s Creed spotlighting shinobi. Codename Red will see Assassin&#x27;s Creed head to Feudal Japan, playing a shinobi character.
Also in the works is Codename Hexe, a project from Ubisoft Montreal with Watch Dogs: Legion creative director Clint Hocking on board. No more info was given on the stream, but reports have indicated this will head to the witch trials of the Holy Roman Empire.

An Infinity ahead
All of this is part of Ubisoft&#x27;s plans for the Assassin&#x27;s Creed Infinity hub, which may have even more in store. Alongside the two codename projects, Ubisoft&#x27;s Marc-Alexis Côté confirmed that the publisher is looking into ways to incorporate standalone multiplayer into Assassin&#x27;s Creed again.
With a mobile project, Netflix partnership, and more in store, seems like a lot of Assassin&#x27;s Creed is in store for the coming years.

                              <span>It&#x27;s &quot;the last chapter&quot;
More Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla DLC is in the cards beyond what we&#x27;ve already gotten, and it&#x27;s appropriately called &quot;The Last Chapter;&quot; a free questline that &quot;ties up the game.&quot;
In the brief trailer (which is more of a teaser, starting around 16:45 in the below showcase), Eivor notes that she&#x27;s &quot;done all that she can for her people,&quot; and says that it&#x27;s &quot;time to say goodbye, and set sail for distant shores and new adventures.&quot; And apparently she&#x27;ll do just that in the DLC! The good news is that this DLC is free, and is being treated as a customary questline add-on. Eivor will &quot;reunite with some key characters, including some influential historical ones.&quot;
If you haven&#x27;t been following along, Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla was released in late 2020, and it&#x27;s still trucking through the end of 2022. It hosted expansions titled Wrath of the Druids and The Siege of Paris, on top of the aforementioned free updates and quality of life upgrades. Like most Assassin&#x27;s Creed games once the DLC stops flowing, it&#x27;ll make for a pretty packed &quot;GOTY/Complete&quot; experience once everything is factored in. Ideally this &quot;Last Chapter&quot; actually ties up some loose ends and adds to the connective tissue of the series.

                              <span>&quot;All the iconic Assassin&#x27;s Creed gameplay, with mobile controls&quot;
Assassin&#x27;s Creed China is going to be entering the mobile mix &quot;soon,&quot; thanks to a new reveal from the Ubisoft Forward stream today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;SS_khJE0mbQ&amp;list&#x3D;PLBnrd5k2F2INdjLweJqlvK0OCRIJPg_O2&amp;index&#x3D;33&amp;t&#x3D;1048s
Expanding on the quick dip into China seven years ago, this one is a fully-fledged Assassin&#x27;s Creed game for mobile platforms. According to Ubisoft, it&#x27;ll sport &quot;all the iconic Assassin&#x27;s Creed gameplay, with mobile controls.&quot; The exact date given for the timeline is 215 BCE, and in the teaser we see an aerial view of the new open world playground: and a closeup of the upcoming protagonist. However, said protagonist is actually &quot;fully customizable.&quot;
All we have to go on right now, beyond the short teaser, is that it&#x27;s called &quot;Codename Jade.&quot; This was one of three codenames given out for future entries, which will deal with feudal Japan and (based on leaks) the Holy Roman Empire, and the witch trials therein. So to sum everything up today, three new Assassins&#x27; Creed games were announced, with a look at the already-confirmed Mirage. So uh, this series isn&#x27;t taking a break anytime soon.
If you want to skip to the Codename Jade footage, that starts at roughly 20:45 into the above video.

                              <span>Head back to the ninth century with Basim
The next Assassin&#x27;s Creed heads way, way back in time. Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage will spotlight the assassin Basim, and arrive sometime in 2023.
Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage is set 20 years before the events of Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla, where we first met Basim. It will explore ninth century CE Baghdad, as the young orphan dives into the world of the Hidden Ones. And yes, that includes cutting a finger off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;x55lAlFtXmw
The reveal comes after several reports and rumors about the game. Ubisoft confirmed its existence prior to today&#x27;s showcase, teasing more to come in the reveal trailer.
Guiding Basim in his training is Roshan, voiced by Shohreh Aghdashloo. Here&#x27;s the story rundown from the trailer:
In Assassin’s Creed Mirage, you are Basim, a cunning street thief with nightmarish visions, seeking answers and justice. After an act of deadly retribution, Basim flees Baghdad and joins an ancient organization – The Hidden Ones. As he learns their mysterious rituals and powerful tenets, he will hone his unique abilities, discover his true nature, and come to understand a new Creed – one that will change his fate in ways he never could have imagined.

No firm date has been set yet, outside of 2023. But with some excellent voice talent already on-hand and a focus on narrative adventure, this seems pretty interesting for longtime Assassin&#x27;s Creed fans. Meanwhile, Ubisoft did reveal a collector&#x27;s edition for Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage.

If you want more to check out, Ubisoft also posted a developer breakdown of its reveal trailer on YouTube.

The turn-based strategy formula is back, but with a bevy of new sci-fi tricks up its sleeves, and it’s giving me major Super Mario Galaxy 3-vibes. Also Rayman will be coming in one of the future DLCs.

Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage
This game was officially revealed last week following extensive leaks, and as expected, Ubisoft had a lot more to share about it during today&#x27;s Ubisoft Forward showcase. Basim Ibn Ishaq, the master assassin from Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla, is taking the lead role this time, but he&#x27;ll be much younger. This game follows his journey from a thief on the luscious and diverse streets of Golden Age Baghdad in 861 to an apprentice of the Hidden Ones to a master assassin. It also represents a return to the series&#x27; roo…</span>

However, he&#x27;s not the polished warrior you might remember him as because Mirage takes place years before Valhalla.

                              <span>Ubisoft and Netflix have announced an expansion of their partnership that was first announced in 2020 with a live-action Assassin&#x27;s Creed series that is still on the way and the Rabbids Invasion: Mission to Mars movie that arrived on the service earlier this year. Today, we learned that Netflix subscribers will have exclusive access to three upcoming Ubisoft mobile games as a part of their existing memberships, with no ads or microtransactions. This announcement comes as Netflix prepares to enter the gaming space with its first releases later this year.
First up, is a sequel to Valiant Hearts, a World War I puzzle-adventure. This new title is in development by the team behind the first game and will bring a new story exclusively to Netflix members in January 2023. That same year, a sequel to Mighty Quest, the roguelite hack and slash, will arrive for subscribers. Finally, Ubisoft is currently working on a new, original Assassin&#x27;s Creed mobile title, which, again, will be available exclusively to Netflix subscribers.
In addition to the Assassin&#x27;s Creed live-action series, Ubisoft and Netflix are currently collaborating on three animated series: Captain Laserhawk: Blood Dragon Remix, Far Cry, and Splinter Cell. While Netflix is set to enter the games industry later this year, we&#x27;ll have to wait until at least next year to experience these three new mobile titles for Netflix subscribers.</span>

                              <span>Huge reveals in video games, movies, and TV are currently unfolding at D23 Expo, Disney&#x27;s annual consumer show held in Anaheim, California. Yesterday we received our first looks at an unnamed Marvel game, a new Tron title, and Mickey Mouse and crew teaming up in a platformer. Today, Marvel and Lucasfilm unloaded a flurry of announcements and trailers for projects hitting in 2022 and beyond.
On the Marvel Cinematic Universe front, we learned Fantastic Four will be directed by Matt Shakman, who worked on Wandavision and It&#x27;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia. Dominique Thorne&#x27;s Ironheart will take on the villain The Hood (brought to life by Anthony Ramos) in the Ironheart Disney Plus series. Sam Wilson&#x27;s first mission as Captain America in New World Order will be against The Leader, with Tim Blake reprising this role 14 years after 2008&#x27;s The Incredible Hulk.
We also learned who the Thunderbolts are in the forthcoming film. The team consists of anti-heroes Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh), Taskmaster (Olga Kurylenko), Valentina (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), Red Guardian (David Harbour), U.S. Agent (Wyatt Russell), Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen, and Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan).
Marvel also treated us to our first looks at Secret Invasion, starring Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury and Emilia Clarke in an unknown role. And in just one month, we can watch the classicly designed horror film Werewolf by Night on Disney Plus. You can see both trailers below.
The Star Wars news is a bit lighter, consisting of our first look at The Mandalorian&#x27;s third season, which looks absolutely bonkers in the best way. We also got a glimpse of the animated anthology Tales of the Jedi, hitting on October 26. The Bad Batch&#x27;s second season hits on January 4, yet no new footage was shown. Andor also received a new trailer for the first season hitting in 11 days. The second season&#x27;s filming is already underway! Again, you can see all of the Star Wars trailers below.

                              <span>During today&#x27;s Ubisoft Forward presentation, the publisher showed off new footage of a boss battle in Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope. The crossover game, which combines the iconic Mushroom Kingdom crew with the zany Rabbids, looks to expand in the first 2017 turn-based tactical game in the series, Kingdom Battle, in myriad ways, including the new Sparks that can add various buffs to the heroes and debuffs to the villains.


This time around, we got a look at battles on a train, including Bowser joining the team. The battle takes place on the train as the crew tries to cleanse an angered Wiggler of corrupted darkness eyes as it runs alongside the train. Ubisoft also announced that it has post-launch plans including free DLC with the third content drop introducing a new playable hero: Rayman.
Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope comes exclusively to Switch on October 20.</span>

                              <span>In the world of Marvel Comics, the word &quot;ensemble&quot; invokes thoughts of the Avengers, X-Men, or Fantastic Four. Recently, we learned Skydance New Media and Marvel Entertainment were working on an ensemble Marvel video game. The internet&#x27;s rumor mill believed this game would focus on Reed Richards and his fantastic family. Yesterday, during the Disney &amp; Marvel Games Showcase, we learned this ensemble wasn&#x27;t Fantastic Four, Avengers, or any known Marvel team whatsoever. Skydance is creating its own team of four heroes, set to the backdrop of World War II.
The timeframe has Captain America front and center fighting against Hydra and Nazi troops. Through a narrative twist, Wakanda gets involved, and players gain control of Black Panther, but not the one you know. This Black Panther is Azzuri, T…</span>

What I didn&#x27;t expect at all was that the game still wouldn&#x27;t have a name, although there are a few other details to glean from the most teasery teaser trailer.

A new visual novel set in the neon universe called Tron: Identity was announced during this evening&#x27;s Disney &amp; Marvel games showcase, and it&#x27;s being developed by Bithell Games.

                              <span>Foxhole hits 1.0 later this month after years in Steam Early Access, and the update will bring the most exciting possible addition to the massively multiplayer war game: trains. Also, player-built factories, and several other features which should make players focused on the logistics of warfare very happy. There&#x27;s a new trailer below ahead of its release on September 28th.

Like everything, it&#x27;s also a roguelike, but it&#x27;s transparent and fair enough that I can reluctantly forgive that too, not least because I&#x27;ve found myself enjoying this one the more it went on. It&#x27;s a lighter, cheerier sibling of Into The Breach that&#x27;s half tactical fighter, half puzzler, and its default difficulty setting is close to perfect if you&#x27;re looking for something less intense that will still catch you out now and then.

That&#x27;s Betrayal At Club Low, the latest game from Cosmo D, set in the same strange city as Off-Peak, The Norwood Suite, and Tales From Off-Peak City. This time, it&#x27;s an honest-to-goodness RPG, full of skill checks, strange solutions, multiple endings, and so very many dice. And it&#x27;s great. And it has a demo.

                              <span>Despite lamenting the other week that the rest of 2022&#x27;s gaming calendar was looking a bit weak sauce after endless delay announcements, September is shaping up to be an absolutely monster month for indie releases right now. As Alice Bee noted earlier in the week, there are just too many cool, interesting games coming out for us to review effectively on the site at the moment (although rest assured, we will do our darnedest to cover as many of them as we can).
Part of the challenge is working out what&#x27;s worth reviewing, and what we think is worth highlighting for you, our readers. The other part, though, is often entirely selfish on our part, just playing and writing about cool games we like. In fact, the decision to review many of the games we covered this week - Railbound, Jack Move and Roadwarden - were all down to having played and liked some form of demo, making events like the Steam Next Fest an increasingly invaluable tool in helping us cut through the noise when we inevitably enter mega months like September.

Blizzard VP Jon Spector confirmed that heroes will be available through a free track for the battle pass. Spector’s comments were an attempt to put an end to speculation over what he described as “incomplete info” circulating online about Overwatch 2’s battle pass.

                              <span>Disney Speedstorm, the upcoming free-to-play kart racer starring a who’s who of Disney and Pixar icons, got a new trailer highlighting the terrifying (or hilarious, depending on your reaction) inclusion of Monsters, Inc.
Monsters, Inc. is represented with its own themed course that takes players throughout the corporate office and the department of doors. We also got to see Mike Wazowski, Randall, and Celia behind the wheel as playable racers, joining the previously announced Sulley, Mickey Mouse, Mulan, and Jack Sparrow. 


Disney Speestorm still has no release window, but it’s slated to launch on Switch and PC.</span>

                              <span>During today&#x27;s Disney &amp; Marvel Games Showcase at the D23 Expo, we got a look at the first game from Skydance New Media. While we didn&#x27;t get a name or release date, we did get a cinematic trailer from which we can try to extract information. The biggest news right out of the gate is that this game stars Black Panther, Captain America, and two additional heroes.
This new triple-A game takes place during World War II. As the camera pans over a table covered with things like a brochure for Paris and a flyer for a jazz performance, the items quickly take a turn for the insidious with things like a dagger, a pistol, documents, a hat featuring the Hydra insignia, and, finally, Captain America&#x27;s iconic shield scratched by what appears to be claws.

                              <span>Gargoyles is back! Well, sort of. The 1995 Sega Genesis side-scroller based on the beloved 90’s animated series is getting the remaster treatment, bringing Goliath and his team (much to their chagrin) back into the spotlight.
Unfortunately, the reveal didn’t come alongside a trailer, a list of platforms, or a release window. However, it sounds like we should expect a similar treatment that the Disney Classics Games Collection received. Those games were enhanced with high-res graphics, a rewind ability, a level skip, and art galleries showcasing concept sketches and other historical goodies. 
You can see the announcement at the 12:33 mark.</span>

The gameplay trailer offers a montage of tactical card-based combat, as well as choice-driven relationship building. Give it a watch below. 


We also got word that a series of animated shorts serve as a prequel to the game’s plot. The first episode arrives on October 31 on Marvel&#x27;s YouTube channel.


Firaxis previously announced Marvel’s Midnight Suns will have a staggered launch, so the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC versions will launch on December 2. Meanwhile, the Switch and last-gen versions hit sometime later.</span>

This reveal kicked off today&#x27;s Disney and Marvel Games Showcase, a first for the company. Unfortunately for those looking for more information about the game, the reveal trailer falls more in line with being a &quot;teaser&quot; than anything else. It does feature the Identity Disc, which is typically used for combat in the Tron world, but that&#x27;s about it. However, in an interview after the showcase, Bithell Games&#x27; Mike Bithell said the game takes place &quot;in a world where Flynn created an Ark, where Flynn created a second grid for them to go to, promising that he&#x27;d come back.&quot;


&quot;As we know from [2010&#x27;s Tron: Legacy], though, he didn&#x27;t,&quot; Bithell continued. &quot;Tron fans will also know that time moves…</span>

The trailer also showcases roughly a minute of new gameplay, which reveals more about the strategy card game. It looks quite dynamic, with plenty of fun animations to accompany your card&#x27;s individual moves.
Check it out for yourself below: 


As you can see, Marvel Snap is set to hit PC, iOS, and Android devices next month, on Oct. 18. 
&quot;The adrenaline-pumping, superpowered card battler lets fans assemble their Marvel dream team of heroes and villains and then battle their way through the multiverse to glory – all in just three-minute play sessions,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;Marvel Snap is super easy to learn, but will take a lifetime for even the best of players to master.

                              <span>Disney and DLaLa Studios have revealed Disney&#x27;s Illusion Island, a 2D platformer starring Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Donald, and of course, Goofy. 
Revealed during today&#x27;s Disney and Marvel Games Showcase, Illusion Island looks a lot like Disney&#x27;s Mickey Mouse show that consists of various shorts starring original Disney characters like, well, Mickey and all of his friends. 


It seems that in Illusion Island, we&#x27;ll be controlling Mickey, Minnie, Donald, and Goofy based on what obstacles might be in our way. Mickey, for example, seems to be able to bounce off of walls, whereas Minnie has a grapple hook-like rope useful for clearing large gaps. Donald can swim – duh – and Goofy uses condiments (it kind of looked like mustard, but it might also be paint) to float and bounce above the stage below. 

All of it looks like good fun, but it&#x27;s not all smiles and happiness on Illusion Island. That&#x27;s because our heroes must endure three trials to retrieve the coveted Book of Knowledge. We&#x27;ll learn exactly what those trials are when Disney&#x27;s Illusion Island hits Switch exclusively next year.</span>

Ooblets offers a smile-inducing amalgamation of monster collecting, farming simulation, and relationship building. However, this delightful chill pill becomes tougher to swallow thanks to a tedious, grind-heavy progression that tests your patience in less enjoyable ways.  
The adventure whisks players to Badgetown, a quirky village where residents harmoniously live alongside Pokémon-esque creatures called Ooblets. Despite your newcomer status, the townsfolks turn to you to restore the city to its former glory. That involves tasks s…</span>

                              <span>Following the rocky and bug-filled launch of Battlefield 2042 last year, EA announced that Respawn’s Vince Zampella was named as the head of the Battlefield franchise amidst wider franchise changes that include the creation of a Battlefield universe. Then, a few months later, EA announced that its next Battlefield game had entered pre-production using “valuable lessons” learned from Battlefield 2042. 
While exactly what the next Battlefield game is remains confirmed, a new Battlefield-centric blog post from chief experience officer of EA Byron Beede and the Battlefield team sheds new light on a possibility. The next game might be a narrative-focused one set in the Battlefield universe. 
“Many of you know that Marcus Lehto joined the team earlier this year,” the blog post reads. “Today, we announced the name of his new Seattle-based studio, Ridgeline Games. Marcus will bring his long legacy of creating fascinating worlds and gripping narratives to Battlefield. Backed by a world-class team, he’ll be leading the charge to develop a narrative campaign set in the Battlefield universe that will engage fans in new and exciting ways while remaining true to the classic elements of the series.” 
As you can see, the blog post doesn’t indicate that Lehto’s narrative game is the next Battlefield, but it’s a possibility, as is a new multiplayer-focused project like Battlefield 2042. Only time will tell. 
There’s a lot more in the blog post, including the announcement that creative director Lars Gustavsson, who has been with the franchise since its start more than two decades ago, is leaving EA, so be sure to head there to get the full rundown.

                              <span>This April, a coalition of entertainment companies convinced a judge to sign a pirate site blocking injunction that affected every ISP in the United States. This document was later found to be unenforceable but it was public access to court records that first pushed it into the public eye. As the case enters a new phase to block more domains, a level of secrecy had been requested by the plaintiffs.

                              <span>I somehow missed that Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory came to Steam back in April, 19 years after it was first released. Now Bethesda have announced that they&#x27;re launching new dedicated servers for the free World War 2 shooter, which will all run the six original maps with no mods.

                              <span>Eidos Montreal, the studio behind recent Thief and Deus Ex games, say they are &quot;now the owner of the games [we] developed, like the Deus Ex and Thief games.&quot; Likewise, Crystal Dynamics say they have taken &quot;control&quot; of its Tomb Raider and Legacy Of Kain games from their previous owner, Square Enix.

Which sounds like a big deal, but really both studios are just reporting a change to their terms of service and privacy notices since they were bought by Embracer Group last month.

I’ve definitely enjoyed it more than on its release in 2019, and its DLC adds more to think about and manage during what were once long lull periods. There&#x27;s a lot to like about its final form. There&#x27;s also a lot to... I don&#x27;t quite want to say hate, but I&#x27;m also not quite sure why. It&#x27;s one of the most evenly mixed bags I&#x27;ve ever rummaged around in.

AGDQ 2023 had originally been planned to take place in Florida, but that’s scrapped due to the state’s attitudes towards COVID-19 and LGBTQ+ people.

Not to worry, though, as myself and Nate are ever ready to hold down the fort. This week we&#x27;re talking about our favourite cinematics in video games, a fitting subject because last weekend I saw the greatest piece of cinema yet conceived by man: Michael Flatley&#x27;s Blackbird.
I do spend quite a lot of time explaining Blackbird to Nate, but after that we do talk about some cutscenes and cinematics in games (as well as litigating the difference between the two, and Nate tries to remember the first time he saw a cutscene in a game that was in-engine rather than being pre-rendered). And today the Cavern Of Lies is a Cavern Of Justice, after we received a troubling missive from one [squints] Brond Coatwear?

                              <span>I saw a panel of thriller authors a couple of months back and one of them made reference to &quot;the fat chapter&quot;, and the others all went &quot;Ohhhh, yes, the fat chapter!&quot;. Thriller writers deal in short, snappy chapters, and the fat chapter is the one that ends up getting a load of events or exposition shoved into it, somewhere in the second half, because they wouldn&#x27;t fit anywhere else. Every year in games there&#x27;s a fat month, where loads of games come out and loads of them look really good and there is never enough time godammit.
This year that month is September. There are so many games out this month that look so much my jam that I want to spread &#x27;em on my morning toast, but September is also the month that a lot of RPS staff have holiday booked - including me, for two weeks, which means that if these games do get reviewed it probably won&#x27;t be by me. But know that I have my beady little eyes on &#x27;em.

                              <span>Temtem’s inspiration has always been clear. We didn’t beat around the bush when it entered early access back in 2020 - Cian Maher called it the best Pokemon game in years - and I won’t beat around the bush now. It’s still the best Pokemon game in years. It borrows so much from Nintendo&#x27;s behemoth, but it also takes some much-needed lessons that Game Freak fails to recognise, taking the formula to its highest evolution yet.

Some players have been getting themselves very worked up over the inclusion of a paid pass in a full-priced game. Yet there’s been a plan to include a battle pass in Temtem for years. Check out the game’s launch trailer below while you wrap your head around it all.

                              <span>It cannot be a coincidence that 1997 is a pivotal year in the world of Jack Move. In the game, it&#x27;s the year everything went dark in this turn-based Japanese-style RPG, with a solar storm biffing the world&#x27;s electronics. It threw the world into chaos, giving rise to the megacorps that now control the dystopian cyberpunk society where our heroine Noa is trying to make a living. In the real world, of course, 1997 was the year Final Fantasy VII came out, the seminal JRPG that Jack Move owes a great deal to (right down to its menu plink plink sound). Developers So Romantic have said outright that it&#x27;s been one of the main inspirations for Jack Move, and its shady corporate powers and grungy urban landscape certainly feel of a piece with ShinRa&#x27;s grip on the city of Midgar. 
But the bigwigs at MonoMind aren&#x27;t out to poison the world and suck the life from it in Jack Move. Instead, they&#x27;re more concerned with using their newfound technological powers to find eternal life – a classic &#x27;upload your mind to the metaverse&#x27; kind of tale you&#x27;ll probably recognise if you&#x27;ve read any of the cyberpunk 101 novels such as William Gibson&#x27;s Neuromancer or Permutation City by Greg Egan. Jack Move&#x27;s story doesn&#x27;t tread any new ground in this respect, but Noa and her hacker pal Ryder are a fiery spirited pair that make this six-hour tale of espionage and rebellion against its cartoonish villain well worth dipping into. Yes, you read that correctly. A JRPG you can polish off in a single day of play. Bliss.

                              <span>I keep thinking about Roadwarden like a tourist city that I visited for not quite long enough. Sure, I saw the main sights and had a great time soaking in the ambiance, but I know that I missed so many hidden gems. I want to go back and explore, maybe this time with a local guide who knows its secrets.
At its most basic, Roadwarden is a text-based RPG. You play as the titular roadwarden, who sets out from the city to investigate an unmapped peninsula with little more than their horse for company. Your goal as set by the people who sent you is to investigate the region and report your findings in preparation for the expansion of trade guilds in the area. But you can also set your own goal, shaping your character’s approach from the start in a way that helps with roleplaying a particular kind of adventurer throughout. And once you get to that adventuring, dozens of sidequests open up covering everything from gathering fruit to curing the plague.

                              <span>Every corner of Skyrim houses a locked chest, but where are all the keys? Only a handful actually have keys to open them. So do the chest&#x27;s owners lockpick them every time they want an apple or knife? Are these chests merely decorative, their contents deemed inaccessible and long forgotten? A new mod for Skyrim Special Edition answers this playfully by adding a load of hidden keys to unlock these chests. Some of the keys look quite well hidden in this object hunt, so you&#x27;ll need to poke around, rummage, and turn things over.

                              <span>When we last saw Amicia and Hugo de Rune at the end of A Plague Tale: Innocence back in 2019, things were looking up for the orphaned rat wranglers. They&#x27;d escaped the clutches of the French Inquisition and the hordes of plague rats following in their wake, and the pair were hopeful about finding a cure for the cursed macula flowing through Hugo&#x27;s veins.
Alas, when I pick up their journey in chapter six of Asobo&#x27;s upcoming sequel, A Plague Tale: Requiem, Amicia is having a particularly terrible time of it. Not only is she suffering from an open head wound, leaving her unsteady on her feet, but rumours are flying in the nearby pilgrim camp about something bad having gone down in the last city they passed through.

That brings it to £48, an incredible deal for an ultralight mouse with optical switches, an ambidextrous design and HyperSpeed wireless. You even get a free wireless charging dock with it - what&#x27;s not to like?

It contains $660 worth of games from the publisher, including series like Borderlands, XCOM, Civilization and Bioshock, for $16 (or the equivalent in your local currency, this is a local sale).

                              <span>Last week, the multiplayer shooter Halo Infinite, which makes headlines more often for its stumbles than its successes, suffered its biggest PR blow to date: Couch co-op, a feature first flaunted half a decade ago, wouldn’t come out as intended. It wasn’t delayed, as with most of the planned features for Halo Infinite…

Above all, a deeper level of customization lets players fine-tune their own wintry apocalypse. PlayStation enthusiasts might recognize the phrase “Play has no limits” from a string of ads. Ragnarök’s lead UX designer, Mila Pavlin, echoed the same sentiments and voiced her dedication to centering players of all walks of life. “This is a fantasy epic,” Pavlin says. “This is about a father and son. This is about fate and the Nine Realms. And the ability to go into that, regardless of your background, and be able to experience all this rich detail and history and story? That drives me every day.”

                              <span>All of the new heroes coming to Overwatch 2 will not be immediately playable at launch, and that&#x27;s because you&#x27;ll need to unlock them on the free track of the game&#x27;s battle pass. 
Overwatch commercial leader and vice president of Blizzard Jon Spector revealed this on Twitter last night following leaks and rumors that stated the new heroes would need to be unlocked in the battle pass, which is a paid premium pass that rewards players for leveling up through it akin to passes seen in Fortnite and other games. That&#x27;s partly true in that yes, new heroes will need to be unlocked through the battle pass but Spector clarified on Twitter that those heroes will be on the free track of the battle pass. 
&quot;Addressing some incomplete info posted early about our Overwatch 2 Battle Pass – we&#x27;ll be sharing all details ahead of launch, but want to confirm that new Overwatch 2 heroes will be available on the free track of the Battle Pass.&quot;

September 8, 2022
As you can see, you won&#x27;t need to pay any money to unlock the new heroes in Overwatch 2. However, it could still take some time to unlock these heroes depending on where they are on the free track. Only time will tell but fortunately, we don&#x27;t have to wait too much longer to find out because Overwatch 2 is out Oct. 4. 
In the meantime, read about how Xbox boss Phil Spencer says Overwatch will come to Xbox Game Pass and then check out why we think Overwatch 2 feels like a completely different game. Read about how cross-progression is coming to Overwatch 2 after that.

Amazon Games president Christoph Hartmann recently shed light on this series of events in a new interview with GameSpot, citing that things got &quot;very complicated&quot; following the acquisition.

The side-scrolling strategy title garnered a cult following when it hit the PlayStation 2 in 2007, but it got another shot in the spotlight this year with the Japanese launch of GrimGrimoire OnceMore in July. Now we know when players in the U.S. and Europe get to experience Lillet’s spellbinding adventure again or for the first time. 
GrimGrimoire OnceMore comes to the west in Spring 2023 for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and Switch. The game stars Lillet Blan, a witch-in-training who attends the famed Tower of Silver Star magic school, where things have gone awry. It’s up to her to uncover its dark secrets in an adventure that unfolds over a repeating five-day cycle. Though a side-scroller, players battle enemies by summoning and commanding Familiars in real-time strategy battles that unfold in a 2D perspective. 
OnceMore features HD graphics, a new skill tree, an improved user interface, an art gallery, and other unspecified features. 


Fans may remember Odin Sphere making a similar comeback in 2016 with the Leifthrasir edition, and it’s cool to see GrimGrimoire get the same treatment. Are you excited to replay GrimGrimoire? Will this be your first time giving it a try? Let us know in the comments!</span>

Since its debut in 2015, the Splatoon series has delivered unique, colorful gameplay cribbed by scarce launch content and disappointing time restrictions for specific modes. While post-launch content greatly bolstered both games to this point, I’ve always been disappointed by how little was initially on offer. Now on its third entry, the series may feel a bit less fresh, but Splatoon 3 remedies the series’ long-standing launch content woes while retaining all the fun that made the series such a success.
Stepping back into the stylish shoes of your custom Inkling feels great; splattering your brightly colored ink looks, feels, and sounds satisfyingly messy, particularly when you’re splatting an enemy. Few games match the smo…</span>

                              <span>Gotham Knights pits a dysfunctional Bat Family against a litany of their greatest foes, but one of the biggest conflicts the group must confront comes from within. How did Warner Bros. Montreal adapt and reimagine these characters to keep them true to their comic origins while still surprising players? A new video breaks down its storytelling process. 
The development team explains the narrative&#x27;s themes of trauma, loss, chosen family, and how it uses the Knights&#x27; long, complicated relationships to make each hero feel fully realized as individuals and as a family. WB Montreal also discusses Alfred&#x27;s pivotal role as a father figure to the team, the social moments that unfold in the Belfrey hideout, and its approach to cinematic design. 


Gotham Knights launches on October 21 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. You can see more on the game by checking out the Gamescom trailer spotlighting the villains players will battle.</span>

                              <span>PlayStation told players in 2020 that it could add 1440p support for game resolution output to PlayStation 5 “if requested enough.” It seems that happened because it’s now available in a new update. 
With the launch of today’s new global PS5 system software update, not only is 1440p resolution available for applicable TVs and monitors, but Gamelists and other anticipated social features are too. There’s also a new audio comparison option to listen to the difference between stereo output and 3D audio in headsets and a new YouTube voice command preview. 
“The update includes several highly-requested features like 1440p HDMI video output and gamelists, as well as social features like the ability to request a Share Screen from a fellow party member, easily view new friends’ profiles, and receive a notification to help you join a friend’s game more quickly from a party chat,” platform experience senior vice president Hideaki Nishino writes in a new PlayStation blog post. “Additionally, you can now compare 3D audio and stereo audio on the same screen and more easily access in-progress Activities from game hubs.” 
For more information about these new features, head to this breakdown here. 
This system software update will allow players in the U.S. and U.K. to preview the ability to search YouTube through voice command. 
“Another feature we’re excited to bring to more PS5 players is the ability to search for content on YouTube through Voice Command (Preview),” the blog reads. “From anywhere on PS5, including during gameplay, you can say ‘Hey PlayStation, find [keyword] on YouTube.’ The YouTube app will open, and relevant search results will be shown.”

                              <span>The Hitman games are often good and usually fun, it’s fair to say, particularly the recent World Of Assassination trilogy. Ian Hitman’s turn in the two films released about his adventures has been rougher to recommend, though. That’s why it’s simultaneously disappointing and awesome to learn that Guardians Of The Galaxy, The Suicide Squad and – shudder – Slither director James Gunn narrowly missed his target when he pitched a Hitman movie.

                              <span>Third person skater shooter Rollerdrome has some really cool weapons, but what is it that makes them so special? I mean, there’s only four of them, and you’re forced to constantly perform tricks to regain ammo, which doesn&#x27;t make them easy to use. I think it’s because of their more literal significance in the game. Rollerdrome threatens you with multiple enemy types called Houseplayers, all formidable, especially in the heat of battle when they combine their efforts. Luckily, the four distinct weapons you’re equipped with act as an equaliser; each weapon is a solution for a particular enemy. Developers Roll7 could have easily added a bunch of copied and pasted guns from every generic shooter, but instead they were more intentional about the weapons they included, with each weapon complimenting the gunplay and the game as a whole.

                              <span>Red Dead Redemption 2 now has official FSR 2.0 support, as of the just-released 1.31 update. This makes Rockstar’s cowboy epic/improvised teleconferencing software the latest game to work with AMD’s upscaler without mods; an unofficial FSR patch for RDR2 has been out for a while, but this update should make it even easier to simply enable or disable FSR in the settings menu. Alongside its rival, Nvidia DLSS, which Rockstar also added last year.

The deal will see Tencent bring some of Ubisoft’s most well known game series to mobile, and to PC in China. Tencent’s investment in Guillemot Brothers Limited follows speculation last month that they were looking to take out a bigger stake in Ubisoft, even becoming the single largest shareholders.

                              <span>I&#x27;m an enormous fan of the premise of Steelrising (which is good, because enormous fans are also a weapon in it). In it, we&#x27;re whisked to an alternative history where King Louis XVI stopped the French Revolution before it properly got going by, err, killing everyone with steampunk robots. You&#x27;re Aegis, a feminine robot created to entertain and protect Queen Marie Antoinette. Marie, safe outside Paris but somewhat peeved at her husband&#x27;s new penchant for extreme mass murder, sends you on a Soulslike mission to sort it all out.
This takes some doing, but luckily Aegis is a very advanced robot, the bestest of all the robots. Slight but adaptive with it, and even having an advanced AI, Aegis can carve a swift path through the more than usually twisted metal in her way. It&#x27;s a bit too easy, in fact.

Unnamed sources have supposedly told TryHardGuides that three new AC games will be announced during the event, with an instalment set in feudal Japan being among them. Bloomberg backs up the report, stating that the other games purported to be in development include one set in the 16th century that could be dealing with witches, and a mobile game set in China.

                              <span>I have lovely, blue sky memories of Sega Rally, and I&#x27;m not the only one. Over Jump Rally is a fan-created homage to Sega&#x27;s forgotten arcade racer built in Unreal Engine 5, and there&#x27;s a demo available now if you want to get your wheels dirty.

                              <span>The AMD Ryzen 5 5600 is a cheaper, better-value version of the Ryzen 5600X - the CPU took the world by storm when Ryzen 5000 launched back in 2020. With six cores and 12 threads to access, you get good performance in modern game engines, while the higher single-core speeds introduced with this generation of AMD processors allows for better performance in single-core-limited (often older) games. It&#x27;s a potent combination that makes the 5600X - and the 5600 - the best value AMD CPUs for gaming out there. 
Normally the 5600 retails for £173, in comparison to £185 for the 5600X, but today it&#x27;s down to £150 on Amazon, coming within £10 of the best price we&#x27;ve ever seen on this model.

Not until I saw several scrunching up, pretending to be the eyes, nose and mouth of someone’s face in images from upcoming psychological horror card game Out Of Hands. See, Out Of Hands has a slight fixation on the ol’ phalanges. Witness for yourself in the trailer below.

In addition to millions in damages, the plaintiffs demand user disconnections and pirate site blockades.

I resolved to get one for myself, but things went mad and I only eventually managed to get one through my work.

                              <span>I saw people referring to Gloomwood as &quot;Thief with guns&quot; and thought, &#x27;ah, bit reductive that. I&#x27;ll come up with--&#x27; oh no wait its URL is thiefwithguns.com. Fair enough. It is an accurate description, and if you&#x27;ve enjoyed its demos during various Steam Fests, you&#x27;ll be pleased to know it&#x27;s now out in Steam Early Access.

America&#x27;s bad-ass actor dad played semi-imaginary rock anarchist (I know I&#x27;m being reductive, don&#x27;t leave comments) Johnny Silverhand in the main game, and he popped up to confirm he&#x27;s back for 2023&#x27;s expansion - which we now know is officially called Phantom Liberty.
There&#x27;s also the Edgerunner update dropping today, a tie-in for the Netflix anime Edgrunners (more info on that was also revealed tonight), and free-to-play mini game featuring Roach the horse, because we all like Roach the horse.

I don’t think I’ve ever built one on the back of a giant animal after the apocalypse, though. Indie sci-fi citybuilder The Wandering Village will let me do that when it enters early access on Steam on September 14th. See the great lumbering beast for yourself by watching the trailer below.

I got a sneaky early peek at Lucid behind closed doors at PAX East earlier this year, and let me tell you, its gorgeous pixel art and emphasis on air dashing through crystalline barriers with a honking great axe looks rad as hell.

But most of my thought is going on farming, planning my crop rotations to optimise fertility and yields. Finally, I have a use for everything school taught me about the three-field system and the nitrogen cycle.

                              <span>Sci-fi tabletop sim Moonbreaker is getting two rounds of playtests on Steam in September ahead of its launch into early access, devs Unknown Worlds have revealed. These run on September 9th to 11th and again on September 16th to 18th, giving access to most of the game. You can take a look at Moonbreaker in action from its announcement at last month’s Gamescom below.

                              <span>The latest playtest build of the next in EA’s Skate series appears to have leaked, continuing the pattern that seems to have been established for the game over the past few months. Footage from the build was shared by Reddit user Parzalai, who said they had been banned from their EA account for leaking a previous build. Modders have been running their own multiplayer servers based on leaked builds of skate. for months, so it’s not surprising to see further leaks spring up from the game’s playtests.

                              <span>The sight of a two-carriage train is normally something that prompts a deep sigh of despair from me in real life. Nine times out of ten, it&#x27;s a sign that something&#x27;s gone wrong further up the line - that someone, somewhere, has sent out a train with half its usual number of carriages, and is therefore destined to ruin everyone&#x27;s day in the process by cramming us all in like a pack of sardines. 
In Afterburn&#x27;s adorable train puzzler Railbound, however, two carriages are a cause for celebration. In a game that&#x27;s about guiding numbered compartments onto the back of an engine (using a limited number of track tiles to get them there in the right order), two-carriage puzzles offer the perfect amount of cerebral head-scratching. They&#x27;ve got a bit more bite than simply guiding a single carriage to its destination, but they&#x27;re not so complicated that they&#x27;ll repeatedly make you reach for the hint button to help you fill in the gaps. Railbound has a tendency to be a bit too abstract in its later stages, but more on that in a sec. All you need to know right now is that there are plenty of smart ideas to wrap your head around here, and that you&#x27;ll be grinning from ear to ear by the time you reach the end of the line.

After four packed days of demos, panels, interviews, and lots of fruit smoothies, Liam and I are completely PAXed out, but we&#x27;re not done quite yet.
Below you&#x27;ll find something a little different from our usual daily round-ups. For our last day at PAX, we&#x27;ve done a super, uber, mega round-up on the entire event. We list off our favourite panel moments, the best game demos we played, and our general opinion on how the overall convention went. Click play below to see one of our last videos from the event:

                              <span>CD Projekt Red has unveiled the first Cyberpunk 2077 story expansion called Phantom Liberty will be released next year. 
This was revealed during today&#x27;s Night City Wire livestream, which is also where CDPR, Netflix, and Studio Trigger revealed what the English Dub for Cyberpunk: Edgerunnners sounds like. CDPR revealed Phantom Liberty shortly after, and it looks great. Not only does it add more to V&#x27;s story, with them seemingly becoming a secret service-like agent for the New United States of America, but it also sees Keanu Reeves&#x27; Johnny Silverhand return to the fold.

                              <span>If you’ve been looking to give your PlayStation 5 a more rugged makeover (or want to hide it while playing outdoors, somehow), a new set of camouflage accessories is on the way.
This fall, you can outfit your PS5 with gray camouflage plates, a DualSense controller, or Pulse 3D headset. While it&#x27;s as camo as camo can be, eagle-eyed fans can spot tiny PlayStation symbols embedded into the lightest shades of the pattern for a nice touch. 


Pre-orders begin on September 15. The cover plates and DualSense launch globally on October 14. The headset becomes available in December. Sony has not listed prices for these items. 
Maybe one day we&#x27;ll get a camo version of the recently revealed DualSense Edge controller. In related news, Sony recently increased the price of the PlayStation 5 in multiple non-U.S. territories. It also acquired Savage Games Studios as part of its newly formed mobile division.</span>

                              <span>CD Projekt Red has released a (kind of) new trailer for its upcoming anime, Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, which it is making with Netflix and Studio Trigger. 
I say it&#x27;s a trailer that&#x27;s kind of new because if you&#x27;ve been keeping up with Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, there&#x27;s a good chance you&#x27;ve already seen it. It&#x27;s the NSFW one released last week, but it featured Japanese VO with subtitles. Today, CDPR has released the same trailer with the English dub now.

As you can see, the English dub sounds great. The studio also announced the series will feature 12 total dubs, including English, Japanese, German, Polish, French, and more. There will be subtitles for each of those languages and many more too.

                              <span>A powerful sense of discovery drove players to chart courses throughout God of War 2018&#x27;s map. Winding footpaths led to expansive hubs at a scale unlike previous games in the franchise. Ornate chests holding rare equipment and Jötnar Shrines with lore murals were just some of the items awaiting wide-eyed players across six realms. Golden path locales like Midgard and its massive Lake of the Nine, Alfheim, home to light and dark elves, Helheim, the underworld, and Jötunheim, the land of Giants, were sprawling zones in their own right, filled with enough content to keep players engaged. Yet, the optional but equally impressive Niflheim and Muspelheim realms pushed player skills to the limit with vigorous combat trials. Despite the size and myriad navigable backdrops, the Norse universe felt …</span>

So as for what to expect, your guess is as good as anyone else&#x27;s. I wager we&#x27;ll be seeing some new Pokémon, perhaps some more information about the legendaries and how they play into the wider narrative of this gen, and maybe a new look at some gym leaders. Only time will tell, but fortunately, we don&#x27;t have to wait long. 
In the meantime, watch the latest Pokémon Scarlet and Violet trailer for a quick look at this gen&#x27;s competitive play, and then catch up on everything we learned from the recent Pokémon Presents livestream.

If you’re looking for something new to play today, Disney Dreamlight Valley, the adventure game that mixes quests, exploration, and more with life simulation gameplay, will be available to download later today. On both PC and Xbox Game Pass, players will have access to the Founder’s Edition of the game, which gives players early access, exclusive cosmetic rewards, and a starting pile of in-game currency.

                              <span>Did you notice that The MagPi’s Features Ed Rob Zwetsloot likes to write about wearable tech and cosplay? There’s a good reason for that. For a very long time, I’ve been into dressing up. I vividly remember being 17 and going to every charity shop in town looking for a specific type of striped trouser […]

                              <span>The Elgato Stream Deck MK.2 is a kind of funny thing, a little plastic box with 15 plastic buttons. Each button has a tiny screen behind it, and when pressed can do any number of things - launching a program, changing to a new scene in a stream, adjusting your media volume, muting a microphone or sending out an alert. It&#x27;s ideal for automation, giving you an easy way to trigger scripts or shortcuts that speed up the dreary parts of your job or your favourite game, and of course for game streamers it&#x27;s invaluable. The MK.2 model normally costs £139, but today at Currys you can pick one up for £97 using the code GAMING30.

                              <span>BioShock Remastered, BioShock 2 Remastered and BioShock Infinite have all fallen afoul of some questionably titled “quality of life” updates that publishers 2K Games released last week. These updates added a new 2K Launcher to all three BioShocks that appears when booting them up from Steam, but as found by GamingOnLinux, something about this launcher doesn’t take kindly to Linux-based operating systems. Linux-based operating systems like the Steam Deck’s SteamOS.


As it happens, then, there&#x27;s a chance – if you’re trying to play on Valve’s handheld PC – that all these updates will do is swing a bloodied 9-iron into the Deck’s ability to launch the affected games at all. Whoopsie doodle.

                              <span>Back in the mists of time of 2014, the original Tales From The Borderlands followed the classic Telltale episodic template, with a new chapter dropping every three or four months. Gearbox Software&#x27;s upcoming New Tales From The Borderlands, however, is going to be doing things a bit differently. As our PAX West team found out over the weekend, NuTales will still be split up into an episodic-style chapter structure, according to director of production James Lopez, but you won&#x27;t have to wait several months before you can play them altogether.

                              <span>A truly dynamic story is a goal game designers have strived toward for decades. Worldwalker Games&#x27; Wildermyth gets closer to that goal than most. In this spellbinding RPG, players guide bands of heroes through a lifetime of adventure, embarking on dozens of short, whimsical quests wherein they grow, age, and quite literally evolve, with the potential to transform into walking trees, celestial beings, and anthropomorphised crows.


Wildermyth is an inspired example of narrative design, with some nifty tactical combat to boot. But when Nate Austin, his wife Annie, and his brother Doug began developing the game around eight years ago, the weight of emphasis between storytelling and combat was very much the other way around.

                              <span>A store page for The Division&#x27;s upcoming free-to-play looter-shooter spin-off The Division: Heartland went up on the Ubisoft Store yesterday, revealing new details about the game&#x27;s setting and multiplayer modes. The store page has since been taken down, but not before it was spotted by a few eagle-eyed Twitterers. Seeing as the next Ubisoft Forward showcase is scheduled for this coming Saturday, it’s entirely possible that we’ll be seeing some concrete deets about Heartland then.

                              <span>Images that allegedly show a Silent Hill 2 remake have been doing the rounds online over the weekend, featuring creepy nurses and the very shadowy back of protagonist James Sunderland’s head. They’re appropriately blurry, considering the series&#x27; penchant for mistiness, but still recognisably Silent Hill. Once again, it’s claimed that the game is being developed by Layers Of Fear studio Bloober Team.

This week, my eye has been caught by a shrimp breeding game, some lovely places to explore, some bleak places to explore, and a plasma rifle with a surprising number of functions.

After watching yesterday&#x27;s TF2 panel, we were incredibly excited to put our own questions to the TF2 squad. Ellen McLain (the TF2 announcer), Gary Schwartz (Heavy and Demoman), John Patrick Lowrie (Sniper) and Robin Atkin Downes (Medic) answered all our questions including how they each created the voices for the characters and if they would they return for a completely metaphorical release of Team Fortress 3 which - spoilers - was a resounding yes. Watch below for the entire interview.

Local ISPs have been ordered to block 18 pirate sites but the same order also applies to domain registrars, including US-based Namecheap and GoDaddy. These far-reaching measures apply to a movie that hasn&#x27;t yet been released and hasn&#x27;t been pirated either.

                              <span>It&#x27;s the dawn of day three here at  PAX West, and what better way to wake us up than play the incredibly chaotic demo build of
 Friends VS Friends. We loved the trailer from Gamescom and Liam even chose it for his bestest pick in our Gamescom round-up video, so our expectations were high, and after playing a quick match at the Raw Fury booth, Brainwash Gang&#x27;s blood-pumping deck-building FPS shot straight to the top of our favourite things we&#x27;ve seen here at PAX so far.
If you&#x27;ve not heard of Friends VS Friends, check out the game&#x27;s trailer first (its incredibly slick animation is super cool, highly reccomended for your peepers) then watch our interview with Brainwash Gang developer Edu Verz who talked all about the game&#x27;s development.

It&#x27;s now the weekend so the show floor was significantly busier, but not enough to keep us from getting our mitts on some games. That&#x27;s right, we actually played some games today!

We are big fans of Monkey Island here at RPS, so after watching him guest speak on the Adventure Games PAX panel today, we got a chance to chinwag with Gilbert and to chat about his upcoming comeback to the series with Return to Monkey Island.
Gilbert was lovely enough to tell us all about the next game in the Monkey Island saga -  what it was like to return to Monkey Island&#x27;s world after so long, what we can expect from the puzzles, and snippets of the game&#x27;s story. Watch below to see the interview in its entirety and make sure you watch to the end to see my impression of a pirate - you won&#x27;t wanna miss that.

                              <span>It&#x27;s day two of PAX West and to kick off our second day of game events and demos we got hands-on with a build of Neowiz&#x27;s Pinocchio RPG, Lies of P. The gameplay demo caused quite a stir when it was at Gamescom earlier this year, so we made it one of our priorities to check it out here in Seattle.
Neowiz are not actually at PAX so there wasn&#x27;t anyone on the team to give us some behind-the-scenes info, but I got stuck into the demo for a solid 30 minutes, brawling with the game&#x27;s angry robot lads that roamed the city&#x27;s blood-washed cobbled streets.
Overall, I had a great time with the demo. Yes, it is incredibly similar to Bloodborne in both its combat and environments but there are plenty of other elements that steer it away from FromSoftware&#x27;s horror-filled gothic RPG. If you want more details instead of that short summary then check out our video below where I talk about my time with the build, and about having my arse kicked by giant mechanical automatons. Enjoy!

                              <span>Companies seeking to protect their copyrights online can often rely on professional advice, either from in-house experts or external anti-piracy companies. The big issue facing rightsholders in Japan is that overseas pirate sites complicate opportunities for enforcement. A brand new portal offering free legal consultations hopes to level the playing field.

                              <span>Google has removed several popular YouTube rippers from its UK search results. The company took this action following a notice from local music group BPI, which pointed out that local ISPs are required to block the sites due to a High Court order. In response, Google voluntarily took the same action.

                              <span>A few weeks ago we posted about a stellar deal on Lenovo&#x27;s BoostStation, an external GPU enclosure that lets you turn almost any Thunderbolt 3 laptop into a gaming powerhouse with the simple addition of a graphics card. Rather than the £200 or £300 prices we normally see attached to these enclosures, this one was available at just £93. Now that deal is back, once again via the Laptop Outlet store on Ebay. 
This time though, you&#x27;ll  need to use code FANCY15 to knock 15% off the price of the BoostStation, bringing it down to that alluring £93 price point once again.

This is a huge amount of storage, ideal for archiving games and storing media like music and video, and well worth considering especially if your boot SSD is getting full. By comparison, the cheapest 8TB SSD is £669, making this more than four times cheaper.

Then, during Gamescom’s Opening Night Live event, Gearbox officially revealed the sequel, which is less a direct continuation of Telltale’s story and more a spiritual successor to the series, which is evident in its official name: New Tales from the Borderlands. 
That new trailer gave us a look at the new protagonists – altruistic scientist Anu, her street-wise brother Octavio, and local business owner Fran – as well as a look at just how Tales from the Borderlands this new entry is this time around. Sure, it’s a new cast and an all-new story in the world of Borderlands, but it’s clear it will play and feel familiar…</span>

                              <span>Fans of Splitgate, the sci-fi multiplayer shooter with portals, received some bittersweet news today. Developer 1047 Games has announced it’s finally bringing the game out of its lengthy beta and launching it in 1.0 next month. It also revealed plans to create another title within the Splitgate universe. But to facilitate work on this next project, it will cease feature development of Splitgate.
1047 explains in a press release that it’s developing a new shooter in Unreal Engine 5 set in the world of Splitgate, which means it will also feature portals. There aren&#x27;t any more details beyond this, but it will be the team’s full-time project going forward. 
As such, 1047 is launching Splitgate out of beta on September 15, but it will move away from creating substantial content after that. However, the team assures fans that Splitgate will remain online. The game’s launch will kick off a new season, which includes a new, free battle pass featuring an infinite number of levels along with new characters, skins, and other goodies. Splitgate’s weekly featured playlists, and item drops will continue, and the team will still work on smaller fixes and updates. 
You can read 1047&#x27;s full statement below (click to enlarge):
Splitgate launched in PC beta in 2019, but the game really caught fire when its console beta began in 2021. The game became so popular on PlayStation and Xbox that servers regularly became congested, to the point that 1047 decided to postpone the full launch and keep the game in an indefinite beta to focus on further stabilizing the online infrastructure as the project continued to receive more funding. Season 0 began last August, adding a new map, game mode, and other features.</span>

                              <span>Standing here, I realize that this Super Replay will be a cut above the rest because we’ll be slicing and dicing in Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance! Join us today on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central to enjoy two hours of what will be a full playthrough of the cult favorite action game streaming weekly each Friday. 
Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance serves as a sequel/spin-off to Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots that puts cyborg ninja Raiden at the helm. Instead of sneaking around in boxes, players eviscerate foes in fast-paced, stylish action courtesy of developer Platinum Games. Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look. Will I acquire a new appreciation for the game nine years later? How many watermelons will I slice? You’ll have to tune in to find out. 
Watch on Twitch!
Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Andrew Reiner and Blake Hester, as we revisit Raiden’s beloved solo adventure. If you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes. You’ll also be granted entry to the official Game Informer Discord channel, where our welcoming community members, moderators, and staff gather to talk games, entertainment, food, and organize hangouts!</span>

                              <span>DC Fandome, the virtual fan convention showcasing DC movies, TV shows, and, of course, video games, will not take place this year, Warner Bros. Discovery confirms. 
The first DC Fandome took place in 2020, serving as a livestream alternative to in-person conventions in the wake of the pandemic. It featured virtual panels with celebrities and filmmakers that provided new announcements, trailers, and early looks at all things DC media. In terms of video games, the 2020 and 2021 editions gave us substantial new looks at Gotham Knights and Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. 
In a statement to Popverse, Warner Bros. Discovery explains the decision by writing:
Fandome’s cancellation is an unfortunate blow in the ongoing transition resulting from April’s Warner Bros./Discovery merger. Although only two years old, Fandome has found great success, generating millions of views. Last year&#x27;s show was highlighted by new trailers for The Batman, Black Adam, and The Flash. Unfortunately, the DC film slate has largely been flipped on its head since then as several projects have been delayed (Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, Shazam! Fury of the Gods), in limbo (The Flash), or canceled (Batgirl). 
While we won&#x27;t see them during DC&#x27;s big event, Gotham Knights launches on October 21, and Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League arrives sometime in 2023.

For the uninitiated, Night City Wire is basically like CDPR&#x27;s version of a Nintendo Direct, except the showcases are specifically focused on Cyberpunk 2077. They were quite prevalent in the leadup to the release of Cyberpunk 2077, but now, with it nearing two years old, Night City Wire has grown to be rarer. The next one airs on Sept. 6 at 8 a.m. PT/11 a.m. ET, though, and will be &quot;about our upcoming anime Cyberpunk: Edgerunners and what&#x27;s next for Cyberpunk 2077.&quot;
Choooom! There&#x27;s something new on the horizon – a special episode of Night City Wire!

                              <span>Developer Avalanche and Warner Bros. Interactive have released a new Hogwarts Legacy featurette that dives deep into the design of the titular school. It also features the first-ever look at the four house common rooms in Hogwarts Legacy, a sneak peek of some of the easter eggs in the game, and more. 
This new featurette runs more than four minutes long and gives players the most in-depth look at the actual school of Hogwarts in this game thus far. As noted in the video, the design of Hogwarts is based on the eight Harry Potter movies and the books written by controversial author J.K. Rowling, who will undoubtedly be making money from the sales of this game. 
Check out the featurette for yourself below: 


As you can see, Hogwarts is looking great, as are the four common rooms. What’s especially interesting is it gives viewers a look at the Hufflepuff common room, which has rarely been seen on screen in the wizarding world, as pointed out in the video. 
What’s more, the featurette also contains information about linking your WB Games account to your Harry Potter Fan Club account. Doing so will automatically bring your Fan Club wand into the game alongside your Hogwarts house, which can be determined on the Fan Club’s site through a special sorting quiz. You’ll also unlock some in-game rewards for doing so, too, including a special decorative house robe and a beaked skull mask. Check them out in the gallery below:

                              <span>After growing to become one of the most-leaked games in franchise history, Ubisoft has confirmed that Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage is real and we&#x27;ll be learning more about it next week.
That&#x27;s because the publisher is hosting a Ubisoft Forward on Sept. 10 at Noon P.T./3 p.m. ET, which has been previously advertised as the event where we&#x27;ll learn more about the future of Assassin&#x27;s Creed and more. It seems Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage will be the big highlight of the show, but it&#x27;s possible we learn more about Assassin&#x27;s Creed Infinity, which is Ubisoft&#x27;s in-development Assassin&#x27;s Creed live-service platform. We might even learn about non-Assassin&#x27;s Creed games, too. 
Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage is the next Assassin&#x27;s Creed game.

If rumors and leaks about Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage are correct, we&#x27;re in for a game set in Baghdad with Basim, a major character from Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla (if you know, you know), as the protagonist. Leaks indicate that he&#x27;s not yet an assassin at the start of Mirage and instead, a thief who comes to discover the Hidden Ones, which later become the Assassin&#x27;s order in the series. Rumors also point to this game being a much more stripped back take on the franchise, feeling more like older games in the series rather than the massive and sprawling open-world RPGs of late.
The potential for this to feel like a bridge between classic Assassin&#x27;s Creed and new Assassin&#x27;s Creed has me incredibly excited. I love the new games, especially Origins and Odyssey, but they&#x27;re downright exhausting. An Assassin&#x27;s Creed game I can beat in less than 80 hours? Sign me up!
In the meantime, read Game Informer&#x27;s ranking of every Assassin&#x27;s Creed game and then catch up on everything announced during the Assassin&#x27;s Creed 15th Anniversary Celebration stream that aired earlier this summer.

                              <span>Halo Infinite’s long-awaited campaign co-op will finally arrive on November 8 as part of the game’s big Winter Update. 343 Industries released a video today running down what it calls its largest content update yet, breaking down the Forge Beta, new multiplayer maps, and more. 


Online Campaign Co-Op
The biggest addition in the update finally goes live following a beta period in July. Campaign co-op, which supports up to four players, features cross-platform support, shared progression, mission replay, and a batch of new achievements. 
However, campaign co-op will be online only. 343 announced that it has chosen to cease development on local splitscreen co-op to reallocate those resources towards quickly implementing online updates and improvements based on player feedback.

                              <span>Soldier Boyz is the newest supported game of the Hypno engine, and it’s ready for public testing!
Released in 1997 by Hypnotix and published by DreamCatcher Interactive and MCPA Interactive, this full-motion rail shooter is based on the 1995 film of the same name. The game starts when the daughter of an American billionaire is kidnapped by a group of Vietnamese terrorists. Then, it’s up to Major Howard Toliver, ex-Marine and highly decorated Vietnam veteran, to gather a deadly team for the dangerous mission of rescuing her. He recruits six prison inmates serving life sentences for a chance at a full presidential pardon.
Keep the body count rising to survive five territories by playing as each Soldier Boy (and Girl),
but beware and don’t waste a “friendly” since they provide vital survival information!
ScummVM currently supports the English release of the game (which is the only one we know about) and features more responsive controls than the original. We couldn&#x27;t find a demo but there is a trailer. Please contact us if you have a demo or any other release.
To play the game with ScummVM, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.
