                              <span>Quite my Tempopo.
Witch Beam, the Brisbane-based dev team behind BAFTA-winning indie hit Unpacking, has revealed that its next project — a musical puzzler by the name of Tempopo — is coming to Switch sometime in 2024.
With Cult Games on publishing duties, the initial trailer debuted in the recent PC Gaming Show, but you can check out the &quot;Director&#x27;s Cut&quot; of it above. We recommend watching the whole thing, as the gameplay clips at the end do a better job of explaining the chill vibes and puzzle gameplay than the tone-setting opening.

Following a delay that pushed it out of 2023 into this year, tactical RPG Demonschool is finally coming to Switch (and other platforms) on 13th September — appropriately, it&#x27;s a Friday.
Announced as part of the PC Gaming Show (with previous showcases containing Meet the Characters and Boss Mechanics trailers), we&#x27;ve been looking forward to this one for a long time — since we went hands-on with it back in 2022 — so we&#x27;re pleased to see a solid release date on the game.

You can’t fool me, god of game reveals, this one has been openly in the works on GameJolt for 2 years.

                              <span>Streets of Rogue 2 is coming to Steam Early Access on August 14. The news comes via the PC Gaming Show, which also premiered a new trailer for the open-world sandbox game.
Set in a living, procedurally generated world, Streets of Rogue 2 gives players one task: take down a corrupt president. How they accomplish that is up to them. Whether that means helping citizens with their problems or causing absolute chaos, the game gives players the freedom to twist and bend its colorful, destructible world to their whims. Sporting a variety of playable characters with unique talents, such as a ninja, chef, or hacker, you can cruise around in cars, boats, and other vehicles. 


There&#x27;s no word on how long Streets of Rogue 2 will be in Early Access, but creator Matt Dabrowski says to expect &quot;multiple exciting updates&quot; as it gears up for a 1.0 launch.</span>

                              <span>Polaris is a four-player co-op PvE shooter set in an original sci-fi universe coming to PC via Steam this year. Developed by Polaris Team, an offshoot of Variable State, which is the studio behind 2021&#x27;s Last Stop and 2016&#x27;s Virginia, the developer formally unveiled Polaris during today&#x27;s IGN Live showcase with a cinematic trailer. 
In the trailer, we get a glimpse of this sci-fi world, which takes place in a region of space overtaken by a ruthless force known simply as the Regime. In the game, players must reclaim their homeworlds and bring every enemy stronghold down. 
Check out the game&#x27;s first look in the Polaris reveal trailer below:

Citizen Sleeper 2 will be released in early 2025 for PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch. So don&#x27;t worry. There&#x27;s no need to clear your schedule just yet.

It&#x27;s a first-person shooter and covert thriller title in which you exact revenge on those asking a little too much of you and learn to hate wasps. 


In I Am Your Beast, you play as returned secret agent Alphonse Harding. The problem is his retirement has been interrupted by &#x27;one last mission&#x27; a few too many times, and now he&#x27;s out for revenge. The latest mission quickly descends into a guerrilla war between Harding and his employers, the Covert Operations Initiative, and will see you shooting through a forest full of enemies while using the weapons aimed at your head to take them down.

                              <span>Developer Frost Giant Studios revealed its upcoming RTS Stormgate&#x27;s third playable faction today as the Celestial Armada. An ancient and advanced civilization, the Celestial Armada traverses the universe in massive world-ships ruled by the Sovereigns, immortal beings. Frost Giant also announced an August 13 release date for the RTS Early Access to begin.




Essentially space nomads, the playstyle of the Celestial Armada looks rather unique compared to the two other factions. The Celestial Armada is built around the Arcship, a flying HQ that assists with the creation of new bases rather than utilizing builder units like the other factions. Similar to the Protoss from StarCraft, buildings constructed by the Celestial Armada will generate a cascade field that expands the possible building area for the faction.


Interestingly, the Celestial Armada does not have to worry about supply. This faction starts with the max cap of 300, and can build as many units as their resources allow. Primarily focused on buildings rather than units, the Celestial Armada also has to juggle maintaining an efficient power grid by building power-generating structures to support the many buildings it will construct.


Those wanting to try out the upcoming RTS early can do so by purchasing a Founder&#x27;s pack for access on July 30, or wait until it releases for free into Early Access on August 13, 2024 on PC via Steam.

                              <span>CoD Next is back for a third consecutive year and is set to give fans an in-depth look at Call of Duty: Black Ops 6.  


Anticipation for Black Ops 6 is at an all-time high. During the CoD Direct, Treyarch dropped a boatload of information about the campaign, multiplayer, and zombies. Key highlights included 16 new multiplayer maps, a new omnidirectional movement system, two round-based zombies maps, and a spy action thriller campaign set in a post-cold war landscape in 1991. 


When is CoD Next 2024?




CoD Next 2024 will be held on August 28. Treyarch did not confirm a start time for the event. For reference, CoD Next 2023 started at noon est. 


How to watch CoD Next 2024


CoD Next 2024 will be streamed on the official Call of Duty YouTube and Twitch channels. As was the case last year, we expect there to be exclusive Twitch drops and YouTube rewards for watching the streams. Fans can also watch the event from their favorite streamers&#x27; prospective, as dozens of content creators will be flown out to show off their skills. 


What to expect from Cod Next 2024


Fans certainly get their money&#x27;s worth from CoD Next events. In 2023, Activision gifted fans with a four-hour livestream. Over 100 content creators were flown out and played several Modern Warfare 3 matches across a few of the title&#x27;s maps. Then, those streamers played several Warzone matches, and gave players a first look at Urzikstan. In between, there were developer interviews filled with new nuggets about every game mode. 


CoD Next 2024 will most likely follow a similar format and provide gameplay footage from some of the 16 new multiplayer maps. Most Warzone information remains shrouded in mystery, as Treyarch kept tight-lipped about the battle royale during the CoD Direct.

                              <span>For the first time since 2021, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 brings back round-based zombies. 


As part of Call of Duty Direct, Treyarch confirmed that Black Ops 6 will launch with two round-based zombie maps. Liberty Falls is set in West Virginia during the day, while Terminus is set in a black site area with a dark setting. 


Zombies in Black Ops 6 continues the narrative that started in Black Ops 6. Treyarch confirmed a mix of new and returning power-ups and a healthy dose of easter eggs for players to put their detective hats on to solve. In addition, the movement overhaul will also be available for players in Zombies. This means that players will be able to slide, dive, and sprint in any direction, and the intelligent movement option allows you to move forward and auto sprint, auto mantle, and auto crouch. Lastly, the new Supine Prone lets you rotate your body while laying prone. Treyarch also teased that there will be new zombie-exclusive features too. 




This has been a long time coming for Zombies fans. Treyarch opted to turn away from round-based gameplay in CoD Vanguard and instead focused on players completing objectives, which went down poorly with the Zombies community. The decision went down poorly, so the development team backtracked and added round-based maps at the end of the title&#x27;s life cycle. As it turned out, those two maps wound up being the last two round-based environments for several years. 


Thankfully, players won&#x27;t have to wait much longer, as Treyarch plans to unveil new information about the beloved game mode in the following weeks.

                              <span>There were a lot of big announcements to come out of the Xbox Showcase, but the actual biggest announcement was likely the new Life is Strange and the return of original protagonist Max Caulfield.


Life is Strange: Double Exposure was dropped seemingly out of nowhere at the Xbox event in a franchise that many assumed was dormant, if not done entirely. Not only does the franchise live on, but it&#x27;s also bringing back fan-favorite Max, the original game&#x27;s master photographer with the ability to travel through time. 


Fans are having a huge response on Twitter, and it&#x27;s honestly heartwarming to see so many people excited for the return of Max after so long.

                              <span>The EA FC 24 Bradley Barcola Path to Glory SBC is now live in Ultimate Team, and this is a rather interesting addition in terms of content. 


Like all Path to Glory cards, Barcola&#x27;s item will be eligible for upgrades in the near future. However, this item is pretty easy to obtain as there are only two tasks in his SBC. Moreover, France has a great chance of going all the way to lift the trophy. In that case, Barcola&#x27;s PTG (Path to Glory) card could end up getting some massive boosts, making this SBC an absolute bargain. 


EA FC 24 Bradley Barcola Path to Glory SBC tasks


Both tasks of the EA FC 24 Bradley Barcola Path to Glory SBC have different conditions that will need to be satisfied during squad submissions. 


Task 1 - France



Min. 1 Players from: France


Min. Team Rating: 87

                              <span>A new dark-fantasy action-adventure game Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn, has been announced at the Xbox Games Showcase 2024, set to release on July 18, 2024.


In addition, a demo is set to release on Steam tomorrow on June 10, 2024.


Set in the world of Kian, the game hosts a variety of open and sprawling areas for players to explore, either by foot, or by air using warp points with the help of a mystical fox-like companion named Enki.


The story stars a woman named Nor, a fighter in a decade-long war whose situation becomes even more bleak when she incidentally releases a multitude of imprisoned Gods across the land, including Enki, who agrees to help her track down each of the Gods and strike them down.


While the game features a souls-lite structure of exploration and progression, the action is far more intricate, as players dispose of enemies with a mix of magical spells, swordplay, and vintage firearms in hack-and-slash combo heavy combat.


The game is being developed by A44 games of Ashen fame and published by Kepler Interactive.


The game launches on Xbox Series X, Series S, and PC Gamepass, with only just over a month to wait.


This is a developing news story.

                              <span>During the CoD Direct, Treyarch gave players a good idea of what they can expect from multiplayer in Call of Duty Black Ops 6. 


Call of Duty Black Ops 6 is set to launch with 12 new 6v6 maps and four Strike maps that support 2v2 and 6v6 matches. None of these maps are remastered, meaning they will be new environments that vary in sizes and support traditional three-lane gameplay. There will be 12 new weapons and several other familiar guns inspired by other titles to choose from. However, Carry Forward will only be available in Warzone, meaning players won&#x27;t be able to use weapons from MW2 and MW3 in Black Ops 6 multiplayer. 


In addition, the classic prestige system returns in Black Ops 6. Military ranks go from 1 to 55. At level 55, prestige begins, and at launch, there will be 10 pre…</span>

                              <span>A new hand-drawn survival-adventure game Winter Burrow was announced at the Xbox Games Showcase, featuring cute mice trying to outlast a harsh winter.


The story involves a young city mouse returning to her rural childhood home, only to find it in disarray. They will have to craft equipment like adboral little leaf snowshoes and scavenge supplies to rebuild their modest home and prove themselves to the community of mice they left behind.


Player will have to wait for another winter to pass to get their hand on this game when it comes out on Xbox platforms, Gamepass and PC in 2025.

                              <span>The Microsoft digital-only push continues. During today&#x27;s Xbox Games Showcase, Microsoft unveiled a new line-up of Xbox Series X|S consoles, two of which are all-digital, and one special edition console with a disc drive. The three new consoles are set to release this holiday 2024 season.




Oddly enough, the two all-digital consoles have a smaller SSD than the one that comes with a disc drive. However, that one is the special edition at a higher price point, which helps make a bit of sense out of it. Even still, you would think the all-digital consoles would benefit from a bigger drive.


Here are all three new Xbox Series X|S consoles coming Holiday 2024:

                              <span>Announced at the Xbox Games Showcase, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a new fantasy RPG coming to consoles and PC in 2025.


Taking place in a lucid depiction of the world we know, the entire planet is held in the vices of an omnipotent being called the Paintress, who has been slowly whittling down the global population with a curse that erases anybody from existence upon reaching the age painted upon her monolith. With each passing year, she lowers this age limit, eliminating swaths of lives, and spurring those who remain to seek her out and stop her from inking her canvas in blood.




The most striking quality is the dynamic RPG action with real-time prompts, which the developers refer to as reactive turn-based battles. Players are able to take their time selecting which abilities to use but then must perform action commands to execute the moves effectively, such as mashing button presses or aiming at weak points. These actions can also be reactive, allowing players to parry an incoming attack with a well-timed input. Think Paper Mario, but with spells, guns, and fantastical cinematic flare. 


Despite all the added action elements, the game is still first and foremost an RPG with upgradable equipment and branching skill trees that encourage players to craft a playstyle that suits them best.


This ethereal adventure is being developed in Unreal Engine 5 and is the first game from developer Sandfall Interactive, with publisher Kepler Interactive backing the project.


Time is ticking away, so look forward to playing this day one on Gamepass, Xbox Series X|S, Playstation 5, and PC (Steam and EGS) when the calendar year is painted to 2025.

                              <span>It&#x27;s Sunday, and Microsoft is taking the stage to unveil everything it&#x27;s got for the future of Xbox. It&#x27;s one of the largest showcases this weekend at Summer Game Fest in Los Angeles, and it&#x27;s certainly going to set the tone for Xbox moving forward into late 2024 and beyond.


This showcase arrives amid a tumultuous time for Xbox as a whole. Though it&#x27;s finally secured its acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Xbox has also gone through a streak of layoffs and studio closures in the last few months. And on top of that, the Xbox brand is looking to expand beyond its own box, moving some of its games to other platforms.


Today&#x27;s show is a unified showcase, almost easy to see as a solidification of the new face of Xbox. So what happened today? Here&#x27;s every game shown during the Xbox Games Show…</span>

                              <span>Xbox closed out its mammoth showcase event with a surprise: a new Gears of War game. 


The game is Gears of War: E-Day, and looks to be a prequel to the original 2006 Xbox 360 title and, by extension, its beloved Ultimate Edition remaster.






E-Day, otherwise known as Emergence Day, is the Gears of War event in which the Locust Horde invaded the planet Sera. The original Gears of War starts 14 days after E-Day, with franchise hero Marcus Fenix imprisoned for abandoning his post. 


A new Gears game was the predominant rumor going into the Xbox Showcase, with fans eagerly awaiting a new entry in the store series. Gears has long been a fan-favorite Xbox franchise, praised for its storytelling, visceral action, and first-in-class multiplayer experience. 


This marks the first mainline series entry since 2019&#x27;s Gears 5. That game ended with Marcus, his son J.D., and allies Del and Marcus forming the new Delta Squad. The last overall release was 2020&#x27;s RTS experience, Gears Tactics. 


We gave Gears 5 an 8/10, calling it &quot;an amplification of everything every Gears before did well,&quot; and &quot;a maturation of everything those same games struggled with.&quot;


Gears of War: E-Day does not currently have a release date, but will be available at launch on Game Pass.

                              <span>The latest Indiana Jones and The Great Circle trailer captures everything fans love about the iconic movie franchise, and even includes a nod to where it all started. 


During the Xbox Games Showcase, Bethesda provided another look at Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. The trailer did not confirm an official release date beyond the 2024 release window already known. Still, it did show Indy and his sidekick Gina in action deep in the Himalayas as they hunt down an artifact called The Great before the Germans get to it first. 




The first-person, single-player adventure is set between the events of Raiders of the Lost Arc and the Last Crusade, meaning Indiana Jones is still in his prime. Indiana Jones and the Great Circle features a mix of puzzles, dramatic action set pieces, up close and personal fist fights, and gunslinging. Also, it wouldn&#x27;t be an Indiana Jones title without being able to use his trusty whip in action. 


This is a developing news story and will be updated as new information is available.

                              <span>It&#x27;s a good time to be a Blizzard fan. Not long after revealing a release date for the upcoming World of Warcraft: The War Within expansion, Blizzard revealed the opening cinematic as well as a release date for the first Diablo 4 expansion, Vessel of Hatred. Diablo 4: Vessel of Hatred will be released on all platforms on October 8, 2024.




The cinematic trailer is just as hellish as you&#x27;ve come to expect from Blizzard and its Diablo 4 cinematics. Tempted by the Prime Evil Mephisto, Neyrelle heads to the new jungle region of Nahantu.


Players will follow Neyrell to Nahantu where they can play as the new Spiritborn class, recruit mercenaries to join them in combat, and participate in an all-new PvE co-op activity with friends.


Following the recently released Season 4: Loot Reborn, this feels like a great release time for the expansion. The Loot Reborn season essentially changed how loot works in the popular ARPG, paving the way for a great opportunity for some new Diablo 4 content using the new systems.


Diablo 4: Vessl of Hatred will be released on all platforms on October 8, 2024.

                              <span>As part of the Xbox Games Showcase, Microsoft showed off a spiffy new Fable trailer. Beyond that, we’ve also learned we won’t be playing it until 2025.


I didn’t really believe Uncanny Valley could be applied to video games until I saw the new Fable. That really hasn’t changed in this trailer. It’s largely cinematic, telling the story of one person who looks like they’ll be your mentor and another who’s maybe your foil.




More importantly, there’s some stuff in there that looks like gameplay. There are interactions with both fans and haters, a little bit of combat, and a few peeks at the world. Neat.


I wonder if you’ll be able to plant a tree and watch it grow over the course of your hero’s life.


Fable is coming to Xbox Series X|S and PC sometime in 2025.

                              <span>The Xbox Games Showcase, which originally streamed on June 9, introduced a continuation of the Life is Strange franchise through a world premiere, and it&#x27;s bringing everything back full circle. 


Nine years after her debut in the series, Max Caulfield, the main protagonist of the original Life is Strange, is back in a supernatural murder mystery iteration of the series, Life is Strange: Double Exposure.




The trailer features an aged-up version of Max, now in her adult years, who is here to solve a mystery about what happened to her dead friend. 


As she searches for clues about the murder and determines who&#x27;s trustworthy or not, we get a glimpse into her thoughts on her powers, which seem to be shunting her into alternate dimensions, and how they&#x27;ll impact the game&#x27;s story.


Life is Strange: Double Exposure will be released on October 29, 2024, for Xbox Series X|S and PC

                              <span>During the Xbox Games Showcase 2024, Microsoft revealed a brand new trailer for Age of Mythology: Retold, the remake of the classic mythology-based RTS title. The trailer contains some stunning gameplay that&#x27;s been brought up to modern standards, and includes glimpses of the game&#x27;s epic expansion: The Titans. 


We&#x27;ve known Age of Mythology was getting a remake for a while now, but only during this showcase has it been confirmed that we&#x27;ll be able to play it on September 4, 2024. Not only that, it&#x27;s coming to Game Pass on day one, and for me, that makes it an easy game to justify your subscription for the month with.

                              <span>After revealing the official name as Dragon Age: The Veilguard just a few days ago, not the in-development name of Dreadwolf, BioWare officially revealed the next chapter in the Dragon Age franchise.  


Almost a decade after its last entry, Dragon Age: Inquisition, the upcoming Dragon Age: The Veilguard will be released this Fall 2024. While the first gameplay reveal is coming June 11, the Xbox Showcase revealed the first trailer for the game. 




We already knew that The Veilguard would be taking place roughly a decade after Inquisition, but the trailer shows the current state of Thedas and it looks quite exciting. It also features several returning Dragon Age characters, including fan-favorites Varric and Scout Harding. 


The official gameplay reveal for Dragon Age: The Veilguard is right around the corner on Tuesday, June 11. It&#x27;ll be exciting to see what direction the popular RPG will be taking after a nearly decade-long hiatus.


Dragon Age: The Veilguard is set to release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC this Fall 2024.

                              <span>I’m as shocked as you are. As part of the Xbox Games Showcase, we’ve finally been given a new look at the Initiative and Crystal Dynamics&#x27; Perfect Dark. It&#x27;s been a while. This one is the first trailer to include actual gameplay.


The trailer shows off what I’d expect from a sequel to the N64 classic. There’s actual stealth and gadgets, and the levels look somewhat non-linear, maybe. I did not, however, see a large-headed alien or a presidential clone, but there’s still time. We do see the series’ protagonist, Joanna Dark, and mention of Daniel Carrington, though he seems to be the target of the mission.




Actually, a lot of the trailer reminds me of marketing material from around the Xbox 360 release. Parkour, gunfights behind fruit, and first-person tricks. Not that I expected it to look like an N64 game. This just looks a little generic. If it borrows the objective-based gameplay of Goldeneye and the original Perfect Dark, that would be a pretty good hook.


A release date hasn’t been stated, and neither have its target platforms. Xbox Series X|S and PC would be a good bet.

                              <span>Konami showed off a brand new trailer for Metal Gear Solid Delta Snake Eater during the Xbox Game Showcase 2024. It shows off some familiar-looking gameplay with a much-needed new coat of paint and confirms the return of Naked Snake&#x27;s original voice actor, David Hayter. 


While we&#x27;ve seen snippets of gameplay of the Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater remake before, we&#x27;ve never seen it in action like this. The trailer contains key moments from the game with their fantastic upgraded graphics, but the gameplay seems to remain pretty true to the original. No matter how clunky it might have been. The most exciting part of the trailer is the voice acting, which confirms that David Hayter, the original and best voice for Solid and Naked Snake, is back at the helm as the protagonist for this game.

The trailer primarily revealed promotional footage, with gameplay elements, release date information, and a surprise content drop coming the same night as the showcase&#x27;s airing.


When will Starfield&#x27;s Shattered Space expansion be released?


Starfield&#x27;s Shattered Space expansion is confirmed to release sometime in 2024, as highlighted in its official trailers and announcement posts. While no exact date was revealed, we can anticipate it coming sometime during Fall 2024 or between September and December. Considering Starfield&#x27;s release date of September 2023, it would be fitting for its first major expansion to launch a year later.

                              <span>One year after its announcement, Compulsion Games finally gave fans a first look at South of Midnight&#x27;s gameplay. 


South of Midnight is a third-person action-adventure game set in the American Deep South, and follows a weaver named Hazel who has been tasked with repair tears in the universe by taking down mythical creatures. Compulsion described the project as a wide linear game, meaning there will be limits to how much players will be able to explore the bayou. South of Midnight launches worldwide in 2025 on Game Pass, Xbox Series X|S, and Steam. 


In South of Midnight&#x27;s first gameplay trailer, we get our first look at the mix of magical abilities and weapons Hazel uses to fight the swamp&#x27;s strange and disturbing creatures. 




This is Compulsion Game&#x27;s first project since We Happy Few in 2018, which was set in a dystopian English city and combined role-playing, survival, and roguelike elements. South of Midnight is a much different project but it still features some of that signature Compulsion Games flair.

                              <span>Blizzard and Microsoft announced the release date for the upcoming World of Warcraft: The War Within expansion as August 26, 2024. The expansion marks the first chapter in the new Worldsoul Saga trilogy for the popular MMORPG.




World of Warcraft: The War Within recently moved from the Alpha phase to the Beta phase, which historically has indicated an imminent expansion release. However, August 26 puts the expansion just over two months away, which is a bit sooner than I expected.


Players who pre-order the Epic Edition for $89.99 will get access to the MMORPG four days earlier on August 22.


From what I&#x27;ve played in the beta, though, it feels quite polished, so I&#x27;m not surprised that the upcoming release is so close.


World of Warcraft: The War Within will launch on PC on August 26, 2024.

                              <span>As part of the Xbox Games Showcase, Bethesda and id Software have pulled back the curtain on the next game in the storied Doom series. True to rumors, Doom: The Dark Ages is coming in 2025.


The trailer doesn’t show much in terms of narrative but suggests it takes place before Doomguy became a hero. More accurately, judging by the tech on display and how it relates to Doom Eternal, it looks like it will take place during Doomguy’s time as a Sentinel. This happens after Doom 64, and seemingly in an alternate universe/timeline from the original ‘90s games.




That makes it somewhat predictable what the story will be. The worlds of the Sentinels will be invaded by Hell. Doomguy will impress the Sentinels with his sheer rage and hatred for demons. He’ll probably lead the Night Sentinels into Hell. The priests will betray them to the Makyrs. Doomguy will wind up entombed and on ice until the start of Doom (2016).


Not important, I guess. The gameplay shows off a lot of locations on Sentinel worlds like Argent D’nur. Doomguy has a shield that is also a sawblade and a mix of weapons both familiar and more primitive. Many of the enemies are familiar.


I’m down. I absolutely loved Doom Eternal. It has some of the most intense combat I’ve experienced in an FPS. While the narrative they have set up isn’t exactly one I’m very interested in, I’m always down for more of the gameplay. I mean, it looks like we&#x27;ll be able to finally pilot one of those big robot suits that were always hanging around in Doom Eternal.


Doom: The Dark Ages is coming to Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and PC sometime in 2025.

                              <span>Bethesda and Microsoft officially announced the next Fallout 76 expansion, Skyline Valley. Players will head to the Shenandoah region to investigate a strange electrical storm and delve into the mystery of Vault 63 and its inhabitants, including a Ghoul type called The Lost. The expansion launches on all platforms this Wednesday, June 12.




The trailer showed off the shocking new Shenandoah region, with the massive electrical storm constantly looming overhead. It&#x27;s great timing for Fallout 76, which has seen a recent resurgence in player numbers due to the wildly popular Fallout show that was released on Amazon.


Near the end of the trailer, we also get a glimpse of the new Ghoul type, called The Lost, as well as a teaser that, in early 2025, players will actually be able to play as a Ghoul.


I haven&#x27;t played Fallout 76 since it originally launched and wasn&#x27;t too fond of it. However, I&#x27;ve heard it&#x27;s gotten a ton of love since then and is up there with the upper echelons of Fallout goodness in terms of both gameplay and story. This sounds like a great time to jump back in.


Fallout 76: Skyline Valley launches on June 12 on all platforms.

With hundreds of media members and content creators converging in Los Angeles, California, developers and publishers brought a ton of promising new games and updates to existing games. We spent hours getting our hands on the most anticipated titles on the horizon, all while discovering the hidden gems among the higher-profile titles.
This year saw Summer Game Fest Play Days extended an extra day to last a full three days, meaning the Game Informer crew had even more time to try out plenty of amazing games over the course of our time at the show.

                              <span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 was one of the brand-new reveals during today&#x27;s Xbox Game Showcase. Developed by Sandfall Interactive (its debut title), the turn-based RPG unfolds in a fantastical world governed by a powerful figure who wipes out countless innocents every year via a mysterious number. 
Clair Obscur&#x27;s world is at the mercy of the Paintress, who awakens once a year to paint a cursed number on a monolith. That number causes every person of that age to instantly vanish in wisps of smoke. The citizens dealing with this recurring threat know that her next number is &quot;33&quot; and a brave collection of them have one day to mount an expedition to her island to stop her once and for all. However, these &quot;Expeditioners&quot; are merely the latest of dozens of failed attempts at killing the Paintress. Thus, this team will retrace the steps of every squad that came before them as they explore a dreamlike world filled with dangerous threats.


The game is powered by Unreal Engine 5 and sports slick-looking turn-based action. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is coming in 2025 to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S (including launching day one on Game Pass), and PC.</span>

The trailer, which features an impressive art style and character animation that drops frames à la Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, will feature music from bands like Devo, Roxy Music, Lush, and The Smashing Pumpkins, among others.


The game is being published by Annapurna Interactive and is coming some time in 2025.</span>

                              <span>In a press release for the newly announced Winter Burrow, the game is described as a “cozy woodland survival game,” though we have some doubts about the cozy part, given that the tail end of the trailer features the protagonist’s friend being taken away to be eatern by a hungry owl.
With that said, much of the rest of the game does seem to match an expectation of crafting, baking, resource gathering, and many of the other features you’d expect out of a survival game, albeit with an adorable aesthetic of anthropomorphic mice as the visual style.
Publisher Noodlecake intends to release the game on Xbox consoles, and PC in early 2025.

After years developing Baldur&#x27;s Gate and its sequel early in its history, BioWare struck out to create its own fantasy RPG. That series began with Dragon Age: Origins in 2009. It was followed up with Dragon Age II in 2011, and then Dragon Age: Inquisition in 2014. While the Dragon Age series&#x27; history has its ups and downs, fans have been patiently waiting for BioWare to return to the franchise, and 2024 is finally the year. 
We visited BioWare&#x27;s Edmonton, Canada, office for an exclusive look at Dragon Age: The Veilguard, including a look at its character creator, its prologue and opening missions, and more. We also spoke to many of the game&#x27;s leads about the name change, th…</span>

                              <span>The next expansion for Fallout 76 is called Skyline Valley and it launches next week. More specifically, Skyline Valley expands the game&#x27;s map southward to the all-new Shenandoah region on June 12. 
There, players will investigate the cause of an electrical storm circling overhead and unveil the mystery around Vault 63. In this mysterious vault, players will meet its dwellers and discover a new Ghoul type called The Lost, too. 
Check it out for yourself in the Fallout 76: Skyline Valley trailer below: 


As you can see from the trailer above, the Shenandoah region is not looking so great in post-apocalyptic America. Plus, the trailer also reveals that Fallout 76 players can play as Ghouls starting sometime next year.

                              <span>Today, we received an in-depth look at Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, the latest entry in Treyarch&#x27;s popular, long-running subseries to one of gaming&#x27;s biggest franchises. As part of that, we learned the series is implementing a new movement system, bringing back round-based Zombies and Classic Prestige, and taking us to the year 1991 for its campaign. We also learned another key piece of information: when we&#x27;ll be able to play it.
Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on October 25. Alongside that, players can expect a campaign that hopes to instill a sense of paranoia and intrigue with the Black Ops team going rogue in order to remove an entity that has infiltrated the highest levels of government, as well as a competitive multiplayer suite that includes 16 all-new maps.

                              <span>Xbox has revealed Gears of War: E-Day, and it&#x27;s a prequel &quot;origin story&quot; set 14 years before the very first Gears of War game. Revealed during today&#x27;s Xbox Games Showcase, E-Day stars fan-favorite hero Marcus Fenix and gives players the chance to experience the terror of the infamous Emergence Day. 
In the trailer, which features an orchestral remix of Gary Jules&#x27; Mad World (the very same Mad World from the Gears of War launch trailer), we see Marcus and returning hero Dom Santiago come face to face with the Locust Horde. And though we know the Locust Horde quite well, it appears to be Marcus and Dom&#x27;s first bout with these infamous enemies. 
Check it out for yourself in the Gears of War: E-Day reveal trailer below: 


&quot;Experience the brutal horror of Emergence Day through the eyes of Marcus Fenix in the origin story of one of gaming&#x27;s most acclaimed sagas,&quot; the trailer&#x27;s description reads. &quot;Fourteen years before Gears of War, war heroes Marcus Fenix and Dom Santiago return home to face a new nightmare: the Locust Horde. These subterranean monsters, grotesque and relentless, erupt from below, laying siege on humanity itself.&quot;
Xbox says E-Day has been developed from the ground up with Unreal Engine 5 and promises to deliver &quot;unprecedented graphical fidelity.&quot; 
There&#x27;s no release date or window for E-Day yet.

The video&#x27;s opening shows off the ninja stealth action players will explore when playing as the shinobi named Naoe, with plenty of rooftop antics and nighttime assaults. The subsequent sequences showcase the samurai Yasuke, a bruiser who can hold his own in a big fight.
Check out the trailer to see the distinction between the two. Assassin’s Creed Shadows is set to launch on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC, and Mac, on November 15.</span>

The Call of Duty franchise has undergone various transformations since its departure from the World War II setting. From modern and near-future settings to distant-future adventures in space, the franchise has explored the reaches of theoretical conflicts. However, the series may well be at its best when focusing on historical time periods and events, as has largely been the case with Treyarch&#x27;s long-running Black Ops series. This subseries, which debuted in 2010, focuses on historical time periods and conspiracies surrounding them, creating narratives ripe with intri…</span>

                              <span>The latest footage of MachineGames&#x27; Indiana Jones game showed an extended cutscene, some gameplay clips, and a tease of the first film&#x27;s boulder run. In the footage we see Jones and a companion coming across a battleship somehow perched on top of an icy mountain. What follows is an extended cutscene where Jones comes face to face with a verbose Nazi who really wants the stone Jones discovered. A punchout ensues and the ship begins to fall before the footage switched to a series of gameplay snippets. Perhaps most exciting, however, was a tease of Indiana Jones outrunning the boulder like he did in the first film. Maybe the Great Circle will feature classic moments from the films?


Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is planned for release this year, but we still don&#x27;t know the release date.</span>

                              <span>Blizzard Entertainment has released a new trailer for Diablo IV&#x27;s upcoming Vessel of Hatred expansion, and its looks gorgeously horrific. This trailer also reveals the expansion hits Xbox, PlayStation, and PC on October 8.
In the cinematic trailer, we get another look at the terrifying and dark world of Diablo IV by way of Vessel of Hatred&#x27;s opening cinematic. If you&#x27;re curious about what to expect, give it a watch – otherwise, it&#x27;s likely the cinematic that will play at the start of the expansion later this year when Vessel of Hatred hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.
Check it out for yourself in the Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred cinematic below: 


Pre-purchasing the expansion will give players instant rewards in the game.

                              <span>We got a first glimpse at the new Life is Strange game at today’s Xbox Showcase. Life is Strange: Double Exposure brings the return of fan-favorite character, Max Caulfield, as she seeks to solve the mystery of her friend’s untimely death.
The twist is that she experiences that death in one timeline, and her unusual powers allow her to transition into one where the murder didn’t happen, leaving her to try and figure out what happened, and somehow prevent the death in the first place in both timelines.
The new game comes to us courtesy of Square Enix and Deck Nine Games, and is targeting release on Xbox Series X/S and PC on October 29.</span>

                              <span>The long-lost reboot of Perfect Dark made its grand return during today&#x27;s Xbox Games Showcase. First announced in 2020 at The Game Awards, the trailer consists almost entirely of gameplay, showing off the reimagined vision of the Nintendo 64 classic. 
The over 3-minute trailer shows off first-person gameplay as Joanna Dark airdrops into a lush sci-fi city. Pursuing a target, she utilizes gadgets that allow her to hack systems to open doors and eavesdrop on nearby conversations. Getting around the city involves first-person parkour as she leaps and swings across balconies. Johanna is eventually greeted by goons that she drops by blasting them with bullets, stunning them with electrical rounds, or humbling them with CQC melee takedowns. She also has a scanner that reveals enemies behind barriers.


Perfect Dark is being developed by The Initiative and Crystal Dynamics. It is coming to Xbox Series X/S, but it still has no release window.</span>

The trailer shows off the action in an open world that recalls titles like God of War and Elden Ring. The team has previously said that the action draws at least some inspiration from Soulslike games.
With today’s announcement, we know we won’t have long to wait until the game is available to try for ourselves, with a release date of July 18 on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.

                              <span>Fable will launch sometime next year, developer Playground Games has revealed. It did so during today&#x27;s Xbox Games Showcase with a new trailer that features quick snippets of gameplay starring our heroine. 
In the trailer, we see our hero waltzing through a large medieval town while a narrator discusses an old threat returning to the world. Our hero wants to save Albion, and to do so, she needs to enlist the help of Humphry, who is the one narrarating the trailer. 
While there appears to be gameplay in the trailer, there&#x27;s no U.I. and no combat – it&#x27;s mostly just our hero protagonist walking and running through various fantastical locations. We do see some glimpses of combat, but it looks cinematic so it&#x27;s hard to tell if it&#x27;s actual combat gameplay. 
Check it out for yourself in the Fable gameplay trailer below: 


&quot;What does it mean to be a hero,&quot; the trailer&#x27;s description reads. &quot;Humphry, once one of the greatest, will be forced out of retirement when a mysterious figure from his past threatens Albion&#x27;s very existence.&quot; 
Microsoft revealed Fable was coming back in 2020, with a reveal trailer from Forza Horizon developer Playground Games. We then got our next look at the game with a more narrative-focused trailer starring Richard Ayoade last year, and today&#x27;s new trailer is our first look at the game since then. 
Fable launches on Xbox Series X/S (and presumably PC) in 2025.

The footage thankfully didn&#x27;t spoil any major story beats for the Metal Gear Solid 3 newcomers, but we saw lots of sneaking, eating, and CQC.


Other details, like whether series creator Hideo Kojima is involved in any way (unlikely) and a release date, are still unknown. But we&#x27;re still excited to commence the virtuous mission again, hopefully soon.</span>

                              <span>Starfield is getting a big expansion later this year, but you will also be able to play with some new content later tonight. The big expansion is called Shattered Space and appears to put you in conflict with the cultish organization, The Serpent&#x27;s Embrace. It looks very creepy.


We&#x27;re not sure when Shattered Space is releasing (outside of 2024) , but there will be some content available tonight. New locations, new gear, new bounties, and all kinds of new custom content will all be available to play soon.</span>

                              <span>Today brought some exciting news for fans of the long-anticipated State of Decay 3, as we finally got a trailer that shows off some of the grim survival experiences waiting for players. State of Decay 3 doesn’t have a release date yet, but we do know that the game will release on Game Pass on day one.
The earlier State of Decay games focused on survival first, rather than simply gunning down hordes of enemies that have infested the world, even if taking out zombies remained a notable part of the experience. Beginning with the second game, there was also a big focus on cooperative play for up to four players. Based on the new trailer, that second feature appears to be a particular focus, as the narrative of the video showcases individuals working together to survive the killer undead all around them.</span>

                              <span>Xbox has revealed Doom: The Dark Ages, the third installment in developer ID Software&#x27;s modern Doom reboot. And, as the name suggests, it brings Doomguy to a more medieval setting. Revealed during today&#x27;s Xbox Games Showcase, The Dark Ages sees the infamous demon defeater shoot and blast his way through a world seemingly inspired by medieval scenery. It will launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (and Xbox and PC Game Pass) sometime next year. 
Fret not, though. It&#x27;s still very much Doom, with plenty of weapons, demons from hell, some fantastic metal music, and a ton of gory first-person shooter action. 
Check it out for yourself in the Doom: The Dark Ages reveal trailer below: 


As you can see from the trailer above, Doom: The Dark Ages is a visual departure from the rest of the series. The scenery, weaponry, and even the enemies look significantly more medieval than anything else seen in the Doom series. There even appears to be a rideable dragon, too. 
Id Software rebooted the series back in 2016 with Doom, which we loved – read why in Game Informer&#x27;s Doom review. The studio followed it up with Doom Eternal in 2019, which we enjoyed even more. Read Game Informer&#x27;s Doom Eternal review to find out why we gave it a 9.25 out of 10. 
Interestingly, this is the first Doom game from Id Software and publisher Bethesda Softworks since Microsoft (and Xbox) acquired Bethesda parent company ZeniMax Media in 2020 for $7.5 billion. Many have speculated how Xbox will handle exclusivity with its recent years of acquisitions, including whether future Doom, Call of Duty, and other popular IPs now under the Xbox umbrella will get multiplatform releases. It seems, in Doom&#x27;s case at least, it will still come to PlayStation, which makes sense, considering Doom and Doom Eternal were released there as well.

                              <span>Developer Treyarch and publisher Activision have released the first look at Call of Duty: Black Ops 6&#x27;s narrative in a new cinematic gameplay trailer. Revealed during today&#x27;s Xbox Games Showcase, todays&#x27; trailer highlights some of the strange 1990s conspiracy happening within the United States in Treyarch&#x27;s long-running Black Ops series alongside some quick looks at the gameplay. 
After the trailer, Microsoft Gaming CEO reiterated that Black Ops 6 will launch on Xbox and PC Game Pass on day one later this year, although no release date was revealed. The game will also come to PlayStation as well. Spencer said this Black Ops 6 trailer is the first time a Call of Duty game has appeared in an Xbox showcase in 10 years, and that going forward, all players (across all platforms) will experience the game, betas, seasonal expansions and updates, and more at the same time.

                              <span>Battle Chef Brigade developer Trinket Studios has unveiled its next project, Battle Suit Aces. Instead of a culinary puzzle battle, you’re hopping into anime-inspired mech suits to take on other mech suits in card-based combat.
Revealed during the Future Game Show, players lead a crew of mech pilots, who take the form of cards, to engage in 5v5 battles against enemies. Not only can you improve their mech suits, of which 30 types exist, but you can grow meaningful relationships with your plucky pilot squad.


The game includes over 50 voiced characters to bond with over 50 story missions, and players can steer the narrative by making decisions such as choosing to side with one of five factions. Gameplay is all about building the most strategically viable hand based on your personal playstyle to wipe out what Trinket Studios describes as a &quot;star-consuming threat.&quot; 
Battle Suit Aces is slated to launch for PC via Steam at an unknown date. You can read our review of Battle Chef Brigade here.</span>

Both the hero shooter genre and mainstream Marvel media are currently in interesting places. Overwatch, the most prominent hero shooter of last decade, has experienced a sharp downtown since the late 2019 announcement of its sequel, while the Marvel Cinematic Universe, once a surefire cash cow, has seen a wider range of results since its 2019 culmination with Avengers: Endgame. Marvel Rivals exists at the intersection of these two categories, and my hands-on session gave me hope that it will be able to capture the magic of both of these genre&#x27;s glory days.

Sonic X Shadow Generations brings one of the most well-liked Sonic games of the last decade and a half forward to modern consoles. What was essentially a &quot;greatest hits&quot; compilation of remade levels from throughout Sonic&#x27;s history to serve as a celebration of the Blue Blur&#x27;s 20th anniversary is being remastered for current technology, but that&#x27;s not all: As part of the package, players can engage in a standalone campaign starring Shadow. I went hands-on with two stages of each character to see how the anticipated definitive edition of the 2011 title is coming along.

Mixtape draws on the classic tropes of coming-of-age teen flicks, adds striking stop motion-style visuals and completes the package with a soundtrack that would feel right at home in a John Hughes movie.

In the process, you may choose to become &quot;the apex predator of the jungle as the all-new Spiritborn class&quot;.

                              <span>The rumours of a new Gears of War appearing at today’s Xbox Games Showcase were accurate - well, mostly. The next Gears of War won’t be a sequel like Gears of War 6, but instead looks to be a prequel to the entire series that returns to the very beginning of the bloody battle between humanity and the alien Locust.

                              <span>Microsoft have released a new trailer for South Of Midnight, a third-person action adventure from Compulsion Games, who created dystopian Britpop survival game We Happy Few. I thought We Happy Few had some wonderful ideas and presentation - it&#x27;s sort of Fable by way of Clockwork Orange and Bioshock - but found its mixture of pill-popping satire and survival game mechanisms self-defeating. South Of Midnight seems no less vivid, but a lot more assured in its God Of War-style action... and it&#x27;s perhaps a bit less intriguing, as a consequence. Still, don&#x27;t just sit there reading my opinions. Watch the trailer.

                              <span>Indiana Jones And The Great Circle, Indy’s upcoming FPS adventure game, has a new ‘Official Showcase Reveal’ trailer, officially showcasing and revealing basically nothing about the game except that it features some pretty and decently acted cutscenes, which we already knew from the previous reveal. It does have snow nazis in however, possibly the rarest flavour of Nazi after Cookies n’ Cream and Original. You’ll find the trailer below. Be careful: it’s official. Also, it’s mainly just one very long cutscene, so if you want to save that stuff for when the game’s out, maybe don’t bother.

                              <span>Microsoft and Playground&#x27;s genuinely long-awaited Fable reboot will launch in 2025, and they&#x27;ve released a new trailer which... seems... good? And is also quite informative about the moment-to-moment of the game. The video is framed as the memoir of a paunchy retired champion, Humphry, who once mentored a young heroine I presume will be the game&#x27;s main character, though it&#x27;s ambiguous. She could also be the villain. Then again, Fable is a series in which you can be the villain. Egad, such shenanigans!

                              <span>I never played the original Perfect Dark, but the trailer for the reboot shown during this evening&#x27;s Xbox Games Showcase instantly made it the most exciting game I&#x27;ve seen during not-E3. It&#x27;s first-person, it&#x27;s got stealth, it&#x27;s got parkour, it&#x27;s got hand-to-hand melee combat including slidekicks. It looks like a mashup of Mirror&#x27;s Edge and something more immersive sim-y? What&#x27;s not to like.

This will be the 2002 game’s second remaster following its Extended Addition re-release in 2014, and aims to thoroughly spiff up the original with a 3D visual overhaul, new animations and texture, plus UI and QOL improvements.

                              <span>The Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater remake - aka Metal Gear Solid Delta - resurfaced during tonight’s Xbox Games Showcase. We still don’t have a release date, despite signs we might see the remake of the 2004 game this year, but we did get a pretty good look at a bunch of key moments from the original remade in the shiny Unreal Engine 5 do-over - including a look at The Boss and the familiar gravelly tones of Snake actor David Hayter.

It accompanies the first details of this &quot;immersive single player RPG&quot; - pause for ecstatic applause from Anthem haters - &quot;where you become the leader others believe in&quot;. Not miles from the premise of Dragon Age: Inquisition, then. That footage, tho? Not entirely Inquisitiony.

My main takeaway? That Bethesda are leaning into cosmic horror, as the trailer features landscapes that look like they&#x27;re on the other side of an Oblivion gate than anything I saw during my time with Starfield.

I reviewed State Of Decay the first and thought it was a cool scrappy underdog next to larger zombie-botherers such as Left 4 Dead or DayZ. State Of Decay 2, on the other hand, I found to be disappointing - the same game with more money behind it in a way that seemed to magnify its faults. The threequel? I have tempered expectations, but I do want it to be good.

                              <span>Busy week, this one. We&#x27;ve had a whole load of games announced over the past few days, and there&#x27;ll doubtless be a whole lot more this weekend. Most of them we can&#x27;t play yet. But as a general rule, talking about games makes us want to play games, even if they&#x27;re completely unrelated. Everyone has those moments where they see the trailer for a new multiplayer hero shooter or some such thing, and for reasons only known to themselves, they say, &quot;yes, I really must play more Simpsons: Hit And Run.&quot; So: here&#x27;s what we&#x27;re all clicking on this weekend!

                              <span>Computer Artworks&#x27; 2002 videogame adaptation of 1982 movie The Thing was a ghoulish and gripping third-person shooter with some terrific mechanics that weren&#x27;t quite fleshed out, flesh being the operative word. For instance: you can enlist surviving soldiers as squadmates, but are they really surviving soldiers, or are they human-shaped warrens of teeth and mandibles poised to split open and shower you in digestive juices? You have a limited supply of blood tests with which to determine whether any people you rescue are Things in waiting - and even as you&#x27;re worrying about them, they&#x27;re casting suspicious eyes at you, care of some embryonic &quot;trust&quot; and &quot;fear&quot; systems.
Sadly, much of this acute paranoia could be easily gamed out in practice - back in 2002, I deduced that contact with enemies increased the odds of infection, and adopted a policy of shooting anyone who&#x27;d been in my squad for too long. But it&#x27;s the kind of system an intelligent remake could pounce upon and have fun with. Sadly, Nightdive are not working on a remake, like their previous System Shock remakes. They&#x27;ve just announced that they&#x27;re making a remaster, due later this year. Still, I will take a Thing remaster and thus, the opportunity to write more about The Thing, over no remaster at all.

                              <span>A goat or a lamb - which makes the better sacrifice? Trick question, it&#x27;s neither. The best sacrifices are old rich people. In Cult of the Lamb&#x27;s next update, Unholy Alliance, you can sacrifice folks with a pal. The upcoming free update will add a co-op goat character so a friend can indoctrinate and stab alongside you. The developers have shown off the two-player update amid the summer news plague that is threatening to tear entire branches off the RPS treehouse this week. &quot;Summoned by blood and born in corruption, this wicked new ally can join the holy Lamb in local co-op,&quot; say publishers Devolver. Ah, local co-op. Not online then. I guess this is for real-life people with real-life friends and a proper real-life sofa. Well. Good for them. I&#x27;m happy for them. Couldn&#x27;t be happier. Happy happy happy.

Here&#x27;s another: you may remember The Crush House, the colourful 90s reality show where you film the cast by day, trying to please the audience, and creep around by night, trying to investigate the unsettling true nature of the show. No? You don&#x27;t remember? Well, it has been a long year. Never mind, The Crush House now has a release date. But I&#x27;m not telling you what it is until you come watch the new trailer.

                              <span>Wet chunks of summer games news continue to shower down on us like an explosive blast of whale viscera. But look, this bit of news blubber is quite good. Philosophy-obsessed puzzler The Talos Principle 2 is getting a big three-part DLC expansion, and some of the environments look lush. Not least this humongous cube sticking out from the sands of a tropical island at a jaunty angle. It is called the Hexahedron, and its interior constitutes a “large, continuous puzzle cluster” that the player will navigate. As one of those dweebs who has walked around London saying “aha, brutalism” at every insignificant piece of concrete he sees, this pleases me. Come and see it up close in the trailer.

                              <span>Capcom&#x27;s series about big beasts and the clothes you can skin/steal from them continues in Monster Hunter Wilds, which looked as great as ever in its newest trailer from tonight&#x27;s Summer Game Fest show. We get new peeks at some lovely dunes, reptile-chicken mounts and bulky weapons. Oh, and some monsters ripe for huntin&#x27;, presumably.

It’s been over ten years now since Tim Schafer and the folks at Double Fine kicked off the non-profit initiative to help shine a spotlight on games what they thought were nice. No way! I love games what I think are nice! Here’s everything from Day Of The Devs 2024, dutifully arranged for your clicking pleasure.

                              <span>Enough moons ago to qualify as quite a lot of moons but not so much for me to categorise them as ‘many’, Alice Bee wrote about an Itch game called Kevin Costner’s Waterworld - a fully playable extrapolation of a Simpsons’ joke from three decades ago. Simpsons jokes from three decades making up most of my sense of humour, I of course thought it was brilliant. And yet, I couldn’t shake a singular, burning question: What if this, but not joke? Enter Tides Of Tomorrow. Ok, so I actually don&#x27;t know if it has anything in common with Waterworld aside from having lots of water everywhere. Still, I&#x27;ll never pass up an opportunity for a crispy Simpsons reference.

                              <span>UFO 50 is a collection of fictional retro games designed as if they were made for a non-existent games console 40 years ago, but in reality have been developed as brand new titles for an upcoming collection from indie devs including Spelunky creator Derek Yu. With the ambitious project nearing a decade in its own development, though, those games have now taken on their own real history in addition to their made-up one. Those histories will meet this September, when UFO 50 finally sees the light of day.

                              <span>Before we get to the latest trailer for S-Game&#x27;s soulslike Phantom Blade Zero I have a couple of complaints to lodge about the title. Firstly, this game clearly contains a non-zero quantity of blades, from whacking great axes to katanas. Secondly, I do not accept the premise that these are phantom blades. They are very obviously non-spectral, going by the amount of stabbing and clanging on show in the video. With these potentially ruinous caveats out of the way, I am now free to tell you more about a game that looks like it&#x27;s out to eat Sekiro&#x27;s lunch.

Ah, to return to a simpler time, where kids tripped each other up in the school hallways to steal toys , before Pokémon cards came along and everyone leveled up to stabbings. Sorry, Petal Runner devs, for opening a news article about your lovely wholesome game talking about stabbings. This gorgeous, fuschia-splashed, slice-of-life RPG is, if anything, the antidote to stabbings. In terms of game fatigue, anyway. It won’t cure tetanus, at least I don’t think so.

Then Wanderstop started to get rather bleak, and I finally stopped pinching myself. See for yourself.

                              <span>Grid-based puzzler Grindstone was a favourite of Katharine’s, who found it to be her go-to during regularly scheduled moments of “cat-based paralysis”. I didn’t spent quite so many hours of feline enforced stasis with it, but I too was drawn in for a respectable time chunk. It’s those detail-stuffed visuals and caffeinated animations that tipped it for me, and it’s the same art that have me excited for Capybara’s follow-up. Battle Vision Network is an online puzzle battler that pits you head to head against real-life humans (boo those guys). The conceit here is its a televised space sport, in which you’ll steer the fate of its ongoing story arcs by winning or losing as your chosen team.

I want you to have nice things. Here are the new things coming to Palworld: a new island. Some new Pals. A new level cap. A new arena. A new subspecies. A new raid. A new oil rig stronghold. A new faction and boss. Maybe some other, secret things? All this newness comes as part of the ‘Sakurajima’ update, which releases on June 27th, 2024.

The ‘next-gen’ part probably refers to Unreal Engine 5, and fair’s fair, it’s a real looker this one. The below trailer is mainly scripted or edited bits, but having played a chunk of the last technical test, there’s some genuinely impressive sci-fi vistas to behold, as well as some absolutely massive bosses. Click on the trailer below, until the purple hat or whatever it is you kids grind for these days, pops out with a synapse-tickling noise workshopped by psychologists for eighteen months.

                              <span>I’m not familiar with the proto-internet cartoon Killer Bean, but Graham assures me it’s fairly important in the history of online animation. Regardless, I’ve been won over by the upcoming video game of the same name from original creator Jeff Lew, which looks to blend together Just Cause stunt shenanigans, John Woo slo-mo gunfights and the energy of a third-person action game you would’ve found in a bargain bin for the PlayStation 2 in 2002. It’ll hit early access this summer, courtesy of a fresh look from tonight’s Summer Game Fest showcase.

Jusant could be tricky, but climbing was more the way you experienced its story. In survival climber Cairn, the ascent is the story. It seem to mainly be a story about how bad you are at climbing.

                              <span>Publisher Nordcurrent Labs and newcomer developer River End Games have revealed Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream, a narrative-driven stealth-strategy adventure game launching next year. Revealed during today&#x27;s Future Game Show Summer Showcase, Eriksholm comes from a team of developers whose experience includes Battlefield, Mirror&#x27;s Edge, Little Nightmares, and Unravel. 
Set in the titular Eriksholm, a fictional city inspired by a Nordic aesthetic of the early 1900s, Eriksholm follows three protagonists united in their hearts to defy their oppressors. In the reveal trailer below, you can see one of those protagonists, Hanna, an adolescent orphan searching for her brother Herman. That journey transforms Hanna into a reluctant hero, inspiring herself and her friends to rise from the gutters of Eriksholm to become symbols of change. 
Check it out for yourself in the Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream reveal trailer below: 


From Eriksholm&#x27;s top-down 3D perspective, players will control the game&#x27;s three protagonists to navigate through the city (aboveground and underground) while utilizing unique character skills, tools, weapons, and more to overcome enemies and complete puzzles. River End Games says players can freely move the in-game camera to survey the environment, plan their next steps, and execute strategies with perfect timing. 
&quot;All of us at River End Games are proud to finally reveal Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream to the world,&quot; studio founder and creative director Anders Hejdenberg writes in a press release. &quot;This is just the first glimpse of what we&#x27;ve done, and we hope it will capture your hearts and minds, just like it has captured ours. We can&#x27;t wait to show you even more in the future.&quot; 
Here are some screenshots from the game: 

Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream will launch in 2025 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (via Steam and the Epic Games Store).

                              <span>Dustborn, the narrative action road trip game developed by Red Thread Games and published by Quantic Dream, received a new trailer during today’s Future Games Show. We also learned that players can get their hands on it before its August launch.
Dustborn stars Pax, an ex-criminal with the unusual ability to weaponize words. As in, words are literally power for her as she can fight with shouts or manipulate people in conversations. While Pax can crack skulls using a bat and create new shouts to battle enemies, the game also focuses on building relationships with her crew of misfits (who have their own special powers). Set in an alternate Neo-western version of the U.S., you’ll travel across the country to transport an important package under the disguise of a traveling punk band. Check out its new trailer below. 


If Dustborn piques your interest, you can play a 30-minute demo next week during Steam Next Fest from June 10-17. Dustborn launches on August 20 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.</span>

                              <span>Silver Lining Studio, the developer of Behind The Frame, has revealed its next game, The Star Named EOS, will launch next month. More specifically, the narrative-driven photography-based puzzle game will launch on July 23 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC. 
Silver Lining revealed this during today&#x27;s Wholesome Direct, during which it also showcased some new gameplay from The Star Named EOS. In the gameplay trailer, we see more of this game&#x27;s beautiful hand-drawn world, unique puzzles solved through photography, and more. 
Check it out for yourself in The Star Named EOS release date trailer below: 


You might recognize someone in the trailer, too, as the main character&#x27;s mother is voiced by Suzie Yeung, who voices Yuffie in Final Fantasy VII Remake and Final Fantasy VII Rebirth. The Japanese dub features the voice of Aoi Yūki, who has voiced characters in Persona 5, Genshin Impact, and more, and the Chinese voice-over is performed by Shandy Ma, who has appeared in more than 20,000 commercials and TV shows. 
&quot;The Star Named EOS is a story-driven puzzle game centered on a love for photography and the pursuit of memory,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;As a child, Dei regularly received letters from his mother when she was traveling, each of which came enclosed with a memorable snapshot of the location she was visiting. But one day, Dei notices something peculiar about one of the photographs she left behind, putting everything he believes to the test. Now, guided by his mother&#x27;s voice deep within himself, it&#x27;s time for Dei to set out on his own to learn the truth about his family and confront the echoes of the past.&quot; 
Here are some additional screenshots from The Star Named EOS: 

The Star Named EOS hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC on July 23. If you&#x27;re curious about the game, you can download its Steam demo right now.

                              <span>Wanderstop is the next game from the creators of The Stanley Parable and The Beginner&#x27;s Guide, and in it, you are a character named Alta who is running a tea shop, though it seems in the past she was a soldier. The trailer starts with charming, cozy tea shop tasks like serving customers and collecting tea ingredients but ends with Alta on a bench working through a panic attack while convincing herself she is living her best life. Both The Stanley Parable and The Beginner&#x27;s Guide are games that play with player perceptions and are some of the best uses of taking the interactive medium to tell stories that only video games can tell. Wanderstop looks like a cozy game, but it&#x27;s safe to assume there is more to it than that.


The game is being published by Annapurna Interactive and is planned for PlayStation 5 and PC via Steam.</span>

                              <span>This year&#x27;s not-E3 weekend video game events have begun, starting with Geoff Keighley&#x27;s Summer Game Fest showcase earlier today. Shortly after that, though, perhaps the zaniest publisher, Devolver Digital, took to the digital airwaves to showcase six of its games in the 2024 Summer Devolver Direct presentation. 
If you weren&#x27;t able to catch it, or if you missed the name of the game you&#x27;re excited to check out (or even its release date maybe), we&#x27;ve got you covered. 
Here&#x27;s Everything Announced During Today&#x27;s 2024 Summer Devolver Direct Presentation

                              <span>Heart Machine, the team behind Hyper Light Drifter and Solar Ash, has revealed Possessor(s), a side-scrolling action game coming to consoles and PC next year. Revealed during today&#x27;s Devolver Digital presentation and teased earlier this week, Possessor(s) features action combat inspired by platform fighters like Super Smash Bros. set in a quarantined city destroyed by interdimensional catastrophe. 
In Possessor(s), you control Luca, the host, and Rehm, her less-than-cooperative counterpart as the two venture through a sprawling metropolis filled with collapsed skyscrapers to explore and secrets to uncover. Devolver says the narrative features multiple paths in an &quot;open-ended world structure&quot; as players attempt to learn the truth behind the catastrophe that has wrecked the city (and seemingly the world). 


&quot;Gameplay is centered around tight, fast-paced platforming with a range of unique movement abilities that extends to its tense, precise combat,&quot; a press release for Possessor(s) reads. &quot;Balance ground and air attacks, replete with combos and juggles as you encounter a variety of deadly enemies and challenging bosses.&quot;
Throughout Possessor(s), players will discover upgrades that allow Luca and Rehm to explore previously inaccessible areas, nodding toward a potential Metroidvania-style city layout. 
Here are some Possessor(s) screenshots: 

Possessor(s) hits consoles and PC in 2025, presumably after Heart Machine&#x27;s other in-development game, Hyper Light Breaker, hits PC this year.

                            <span class="media-object__text">
                              <span>Tenjutsu is a jujutsu-inspired action roguelite from Sébastien Benard, lead designer of Dead Cells and solo developer at Deepnight Games, and it&#x27;s coming to consoles and PC sometime in the future. Revealed during today&#x27;s Devolver Digital presentation, Tenjutsu is a fully fleshed-out version of Tenjutsu (48h version), which Deepnight released back in 2022.
Devolver describes the game as a &quot;fast and fluid rogue-jutsu,&quot; leaning into the game&#x27;s jujutsu roguelite action. In it, you control a renegade yakuza &quot;hellbent on defying her former associates and loosening their grip on the Secret Garden City.&quot; To do so, you must fight four powerful crime syndicates. To defeat them &quot;you must master a brutal brawling system and build a diverse arsenal of weapons, upgrades, and martial arts techniques, breaking their hold on the streets in a flurry of violence.&quot; 
Check out the Tenjutsu trailer for yourself below: 


While you must take down all four crime syndicates, the order you do so is up to you. As you take more and more down, you gain control of Secret Garden City and can seemingly upgrade its districts and more for rewards. Doing so will unlock new weapons, combat moves, and additional areas for exploration. However, the longer you spend doing this, the stronger your enemies become. 
Here are some Tenjutsu screenshots: 
There is no release date for Tenjutsu just yet, but it&#x27;s coming to undisclosed consoles and PC.

                              <span>Developer Massive Monster still isn&#x27;t done with its 2022 hit game, Cult of the Lamb, as it&#x27;s bringing full campaign co-op to it this August. Revealed during today&#x27;s Devolver Digital presentation, the Unholy Alliance update hits Cult of the Lamb on August 12 and adds a new playable character: the Goat. 
With the Goat joining the titular Lamb, players can now experience the entire campaign in local co-op. Devolver says this update includes two-player twists on existing minigames in Cult of the Lamb, like fishing and kuncklebones, as well as additional corrupted weapons, tarot cards, curses, and relics. 
Check out the two-player action in the Cult of the Lamb: Unholy Alliance trailer below: 


While playing in co-op, players can swap weapons, deal extra damage when fighting back-to-back, and deal critical hits if their attacks are in sync. Plus, solo players get some new powers and abilities to play with, too. 
Elsewhere in the update, Unholy Alliance adds new buildings, fleeces, follower traits, follower quests, and more secrets to discover. 
Here are some Cult of the Lamb: Unholy Alliance screenshots: 

Cult of the Lamb&#x27;s Unholy Alliance update hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC for free on August 12.

                              <span>The latest Monster Hunter Wilds trailer shows off a chase across desert dunes as burrowing, armored reptiles pursue a squad of hunters. It&#x27;s the latest look at the game following its first gameplay appearance during last week&#x27;s State of Play. 
Though this squad of hunters tries to fight back with gunfire, the ground gives way beneath them, trapping them inside a cave. We then see clips of a proper battle against these beasts, with one character using a very large gun and unleashing hell while atop a mount. The trailer also gives a few glimpses of story moments, but it&#x27;s still hard to parse what the plot of Wilds entails. 


Capcom promised to share more detail about the game during Gamescom. Monster Hunter Wilds arrives in 2025 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</span>

                              <span>Developer S-Game has released a new trailer for its upcoming action game, Phantom Blade Zero, which features plenty of gorgeous (and gory) fast-paced action. Though we still haven&#x27;t received a release date, the game is looking great, and it will be playable at Summer Game Fest&#x27;s Play Days this weekend, so we could soon hear how it feels to actually play. 
It will also be playable at a few other locations this year, including Gamescom in August and Tokyo Game Show this September. 
Check out the latest look at Phantom Blade Zero gameplay in the trailer below: 


Revealed as a new entry in the Phantom Blade series during a PlayStation Showcase last year, Phantom Blade Zero is inspired by Chinese martial arts and steampunk. In it, you control the Dark Raider, who is out for revenge against a group called &quot;The Order.&quot;

                              <span>One of Summer Game Fest’s most intriguing reveals is Killer Bean. This upcoming action roguelite puts you in the boots of a bean who seemingly embodies every awesome trait of every action/spy hero you&#x27;ve ever seen.


The game&#x27;s Steam page provides the following synopsis: &quot;After being betrayed by the Shadow Agency and learning the truth about their evil ways, Killer Bean has made it his life goal to destroy them. Yet this is easier said than done, as Killer Bean will face armies of enemies, and mysterious Shadow Beans who are better trained and more powerful than him.&quot;
The humourous gameplay trailer shows the game&#x27;s ever-changing open world, which morphs each time you begin a new single-player campaign. As rogue assassin Killer Bean, you can blast apart enemies (in both 1st and 3rd person), which range from soldiers to giant, Metal Gear-esque walking mechs, suplex them with wrestling moves, blow them up with rockets or just plow them with your sports car. The world is your oyster, and the game seems to be a physics showcase, with copious amounts of ragdolling characters and objects. 
Killer Bean is slated to launch into Steam Early Access this summer.</span>

                              <span>Publisher EA and developer Full Circle have released a new trailer for their long-in-development Skate, the fourth mainline entry in the Skate series and the first in more than a decade. Revealed during today&#x27;s Summer Game Fest 2024 showcase, EA announced with the trailer that &quot;console playtesting&quot; for the game will begin this fall; there&#x27;s still no release date for the game, though. 
In the trailer, which begins with a live-action segment starring comedian Tim Robinson (who actually shreds in real life, by the way), we see him as an employee of the fictional M-Corp before transitioning to a look at pre-pre-alpha gameplay of Skate. The gameplay admittedly looks early, but players can check it out on console this fall when &quot;console playtesting&quot; begins. 
Check it out in the Skate. trailer for yourself below: 


EA announced in 2020 that it was working on a new Skate game, and we later learned it will be called &quot;Skate.&quot; instead of Skate 4 like many presumed. We also learned in 2022 that it will be a free-to-play title as well. 
For more, read this behind-the-scenes look at Ful Circle, the newcomer studio making Skate, and then check out this early look at Skate&#x27;s fluid movements and awesome bails after that.

Coming from developer Lightbulb Crew (Othercide), Nova Hearts blends genres with dating sim elements paired with turn-based battles and a dose of the cosmic for something that feels decidedly unique and quite the departure from the darkness of its previous game, as you can see from the trailer above.

Hot off Minecraft&#x27;s 15th anniversary celebrations, Mojang has unveiled a collaboration with the famous puzzle game Tetris in the form of a new add-on. The good news is it&#x27;s available now!
Here&#x27;s a bit about this new add-on which is available now on the Minecraft Marketplace (via Minecraft.net):

Chrono Trigger is still missing in action on Nintendo Switch. Suspiciously so, really. But people said the same thing about Super Mario RPG, and then bam: Nintendo dropped a remake on us. Fans have been asking for a Chrono Trigger remake for decades at this point, so now more than ever, with so many other revivals from Square like Dragon Quest, Live A Live, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, and more, it just feels like it’s the right moment.
But with multiple ways to remake this game that many herald as one of the greatest of all time, how exactly should Square remake Chrono Trigger?

The weekend is finally upon us and it&#x27;s time to play some games!
There has been plenty to talk about this week in the world of Nintendo. Yet more &#x27;Switch 2&#x27; rumours trickled in with a fresh batch of supposed codenames, Playtonic announced Yooka-Replaylee (maybe our favourite title of the year, so far) and we finally got a release window for Metal Slug Tactics.

Summer Game Fest 2024 is finally up and running following yesterday&#x27;s Opening Showcase. Geoff Keighley&#x27;s two-hour show featured a good variety of games, big and small, starting off with a surprise for Switch owners in the form of a flagship Sony series making its debut on a Nintendo platform. Sure, LEGO Horizon Adventures is a fun, tongue-in-cheek spin-off of Guerrilla&#x27;s series, but we were still a little taken aback to see that Switch logo at the end of the trailer.
Elsewhere, Switch gamers saw announcements and trailers for Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions, Neva, Civilization VII, Battle Crush, Monster Hunter Stories, and Sonic X Shadow Generations, plus the &#x27;Outersloth&#x27; indie dev initiative from Among Us dev Innersloth will surely yield some fruit on Nintendo&#x27;s console, too. Not a huge amount of Switch news, then, but we&#x27;ve come to expect as much.

Day of the Devs is here once again! This bi-annual celebration, from Double Fine Productions and iam8bit, of the weird and wonderful world of indies is always a delight, and at Summer Game Fest 2024, the showcase didn&#x27;t disappoint.
We got a look at 20 games, including seven World Premieres. These range from the sweet to the silly to the spectacular. Some highly-anticipated indies — including Mossmouth and The Game Bakers&#x27; next games — might have stolen the show, but everything here is worth a look. The big question for us is, &quot;Are these coming to Switch?&quot;. That&#x27;s always difficult for these bigger showcases, but we&#x27;ve got all the answers.

                              <span>Nothing puzzling about that.
Furniture &amp; Mattress&#x27; delightful puzzle game, Arranger: A Role-Puzzling Adventure, has a release date. During today&#x27;s Day of the Devs stream, the hand-drawn, story-driven adventure will be coming to Switch (and other platforms) on 25th July 2024.
Originally announced during a Nintendo Direct back in February 2024, Arranger is the debut game from Furniture &amp; Mattress, which combines the indie might of David Hellman (the artist of Braid), Nick Suttner (writer of Carto), and Nicolás Recabarren (designer of Ethereal). With music from Ethereal composer Tomás Batista, it&#x27;s an all-star development team aiming to bring some hand-drawn magic to the world.

While we were very excited to see when this one will be coming our way, the real star of this new trailer is a better look at the all-new Shadow campaign. This fresh story will see you speeding through iconic locations from the Hedgehog&#x27;s history to take on the Black Doom. Ooooo.

                              <span>As part of a copyright infringement lawsuit against DoodStream, the cyberlocker platform was handed orders by a court in India to remove links to all content owned by the major Hollywood studios, Netflix, Amazon, and Apple, within 24 hours. When that failed to happen, the terms of the injunction seemed to be up for negotiation, at least for a while. Having done little to convince the court that infringement wouldn&#x27;t continue, DoodStream&#x27;s operators and associates are now banned from running the site.

                              <span>Oh, this one looks nice, doesn’t it? Tears Of Metal is a rousing medieval stabathon that sees you retaking your Scottish island from a bunch of bad lads who’ve decided to come have a go, which was a bit silly of them, honestly. It’s a hack n’ slash co-op roguelike with some nifty looking strategy elements and a striking art style, but you can tell most of that from the trailer below:

                              <span>Stare into an abyss for long enough and, as Nietzsche wrote, a mostly naked man will wobble out of the abyss and try to murder you with a mattock. Inasmuch as can be told in the absence of dialogue or a text preamble, the naked man wants to murder you because you, and not he, are in possession of a hat. The hat makes you look like an eraser pencil from Forbidden Planet. It&#x27;s the kind of headgear worn by the kind of criminal Batman&#x27;s too grown-up to fight anymore. But it has, nonetheless, roused in this under-dressed stranger a sense of Dionysian frenzy. He will do anything for that hat - hewing your arms off, ripping your intestines out, tearing the skin from your ribcage. And you, in turn, will do anything to rob him of that mattock, because by the gods, it looks a lot more dangerous than the candlestick you&#x27;re trying to fend him off with.


There are many such lost souls in the bleak, midnight world of the Half Sword demo - all lurking near candle-lit piles of randomly spawned hammers, stools, barrels, axes and lengths of wood, all subject to unforgivably authentic physics and cursor-based attacks that conspire to transform every scuffle into a Monty Python blooper reel.

                              <span>Whether or not they actually amount to anything, rumours of a new Doom have had me diving back into Doom Eternal recently. There’s at least one level in it that feels like essay-bait, so I’m obliging. The centerpiece of Mars Core - the FPS’  best level - is a comically massive superweapon called the BFG-10000. Oh, Chekov. If only you could see what we’ve done with your wisdom. The literary subtlety to gun-big-enough-to-scar-planets pipeline will eventually subsume all of pop culture, and those of us who chose to specialise writing about headshots will alternate between grins and tears from the wreckage.

                              <span>In my eternal quest to describe games concisely enough that you don’t feel robbed of time you could have just watched a trailer with, I am compelled to use many of the same words and word combinations ad nauseam. So, when a game like horror tower defence Bella Wants Blood comes along and uses some odd nouns, I get all excited. Here, that’s because I get to recklessly spaff out terms like ‘Blood Gutters’, ‘The Rattler’, and your friend and mine, ‘The Stabber’.

                              <span>Back in 2020, fresh out of high school and feeling unstoppable, Charles Maddock and a few friends “decided to code a game about Fish Wizards.” The result was Fishards,  Magicka-inspired PVP arena action that has you out-squirt, out-splash, and out-spellcast your mates. It’s a charmer, but after two years of dev, release saw it suffer the same sad fate as many multiplayer-only indies. People would play for half hour, says Maddock, then refund the game because they couldn’t find others to play with.

Indeed, documents suggest that injunctions are up for negotiation.

Staff, talking under condition of anonymity, described corporate owners who pushed for a multiplayer game from the studio known for singleplayer experiences, as well as indecisive leadership and a culture of &quot;toxic positivity&quot;.

                              <span>I’ve been scouring Steam Next Fest demos specifically for something laid back, and Spilled! – despite sounding like the title of a musical about upturned milk – has delivered nicely. It’s a light and breezy ocean cleanup game that has you sailing a cute lil’ boat around polluted seas, cleansing oil patches and scooping up plastic bottles. Even if it doesn’t have the every-last-speck detailing of PowerWash Simulator or Viscera Cleanup Detail, it satisfies in very similar ways, and I would very much like to get back out on the water whenever the full game is complete.

                              <span>Back in the day I used to be one of those Counter Strike players who&#x27;d hop into a custom aim-training &#x27;environment&#x27;. I&#x27;d spend a good ten minutes or so darting my eyes between blobs or skittish enemy models then whipping my wrist to blast them with an AK.
Glyphica reminds me of those heady days. It&#x27;s a roguelite horde survival game where you&#x27;ve got to protect your central pewpew from an onslaught of words. I think it&#x27;s the perfect warm up for someone who&#x27;s about to do a big essay or maybe defend Dark Souls 2 in an errant comments section. It&#x27;s fun!

                              <span>Maybe you can relate, but I tend to find I crave twee and colorful things proportionally inverse to my melancholy. If I’m having a good week, give me Fear and Hunger and horrible films like Speak No Evil. If, like this week for some reason, I feel like bursting into tears at inopportune moments, I need silly little guys doing whimsical activities. Enter Dungeon Clawler. It’s a vaguely Slay The Spire-ish roguelite where you grab weapons from a claw machine while you fight. It&#x27;s got lazy Steam Deck depression nap written all over it. The main theme reminds me of Zombies Ate My Neighbors, and the character I picked is named Sir Bunalot.

No, it doesn&#x27;t boast a title in all-caps, but Selaco&#x27;s early access release more than deserves it&#x27;s spot as a must-play for those who desire some sophistication with their ultra-violence.

                              <span>Taipei’s annual Computex event is always a big, circled, triple-underlined mark in the PC gaming hardware calendar. Whereas CES splits its focus across tech, cars, and the occasional overdesigned white good, Computex is all computing, all the time, making it a prime source of reveals and showcases for the hardware bits that make games happen.
Sadly, Computex 2024 is unlikely to go down as a classic, largely because this year’s show has been mesmerised by AI and the most tedious applications thereof: search, but different somehow! Run art-stealing generation tools faster! Oh, Computex, what have they done to you, and why do you have seven fingers on one hand?
Granted, AI is a broad field, and not everything about it is necessarily gross or creatively bankrupting. But it also doesn’t deserve to overshadow all the other useful, unexpected, and curiosity-piquing gaming tech that Computex has to offer, from new Steam Deck alternatives to resurrected CPU lineups and promising graphics card updates. Here are those highlights of the show so far...

What is Fucksweeper? Discerning videogame cognoscente that you are, I feel like you should be able to read the title and form some broad conclusions. But for those who never owned a Windows PC in the 90s, Fucksweeper is a free, titillating, revolting, beautiful, apocalyptic new version of classic avoid-the-bombs grid puzzler Minesweeper that incorporates elements of dating sims and a vast quantity of generative AI filth. Maybe turn down the volume before watching this video.

                              <span>After the climatic end to a decade-long saga in Endwalker, anticipation is high for Final Fantasy XIV’s next expansion, Dawntrail. I got to try out the game and talk to Director Naoki Yoshida (aka Yoshi-P) about new Jobs and the difficulty of incorporating fan feedback (not to mention the reasons the Warrior of Light has such great skin - you&#x27;ll see). But how can the Square Enix possibly hope to follow the highs of Endwalker, including space travel and a fight against the physical embodiment of sorrow? By taking us on holiday, of course.

                              <span>Hollywood Animal is a management sim about turning a bankrupt movie studio into a money printing machine, set in Hollywood’s golden age. While a Frostpunk 2 or Manor Lords might have you grapple with the elements, here it’s all about balancing a fickle audience and Tinseltown’s seedy underbelly. Maybe making some worthwhile art, too? Sorry, did I say ‘worthwhile art’? I meant to say “lots of money.” Let’s get clicking!
First up, I need to name my studio (I settle on Horace&#x27;s Revenge) as well as my crack new team of business bastards. There’s my chief legal officer, Jebediah End. My CCO, Anne Egg, and CFO, Rummy McLastdrink. He doesn’t have a sauce problem, because obviously I wouldn’t put him in charge of money if he did. In the wreckage of the studio, we find an unedited film reel hidden in the waffles n’ cocaine cupboard. It’s a noir thriller named ‘Messenger Of Death’. Whatever influential critic is currently directing this era’s discourse has chosen to categorise each film as genre percentages (‘60% detective/40% thriller’), and setting (‘modern American city’.) Let’s just hope those pigs in the stands recognise a solid gold picture when they see one!

In addition to going up to 16 cores versus 8 with the Xeon E-2400 series, the more competitive pricing, the 3D V-Cache SKUs, and 28 PCIe lanes rather than 20, the AMD EPYC 4004 models also support DDR5-5200 memory where as the Intel Raptor Lake E-2400 models are bound to DDR5-4800. In this follow-up testing is a look at the AMD EPYC 4004 performance both at DDR5-4800 and DDR5-5200 speeds for showing the performance difference.</span>

Some models are also already available for pre-order ahead of launch day. This is quite nice compared to in the past there was often at times quite a delay between the initial AMD Ryzen mobile announcements and being able to (pre)order any hardware.

                              <span>Příští vydání Blenderu 4.2 přechází s vydáním beta verze do fáze feature freeze a už se jen bude ladit kvalita kódu. Můžeme se tak podívat na novinky, které opět stojí za to. Nově běží s GPU akcelerací compositing pro fine rendery (výsledek by měl být prakticky stejný pro CPU i GPU cestu). Render compositor je přepsán, jeho běh je nyní až několikanásobně rychlejší. Rychleji probíhají i undo operace.</span>

In some instances, the problem is kept intact due to limited availability of content from legal sources. This week, &#x27;Adam Ruins Everything&#x27; star Adam Conover mentioned BitTorrent as a viewing option for fans who no longer have access to the series after HBO removed it a few months ago.

                              <span>In August 2023, video game giant Bungie filed yet another copyright infringement-based lawsuit targeting up to 50 individuals involved in developing and selling cheat tools for Destiny 2. What set this apart from similar lawsuits was a two-line warning in the complaint&#x27;s introduction. Elsewhere, the statement could&#x27;ve been dismissed as typical anti-piracy posturing, but here, Bungie&#x27;s relentless deanonymization of targets sends a powerful, credible message.

                              <span>Mods are to Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 what butter is to bread, that unreadable squiggle-font is to death metal bands or wheels are to the bottom of trainers when you’re a kid: not necessarily essential, per se, but so harmonious and well-suited that they feel essential. In the case of the D&amp;D CRPG, it’s a natural extension of playing dungeon master around the table, crafting the world and its characters as you see fit - typically by making everyone in Faerûn even hornier somehow.

                              <span>We knew a PC adapter for PlayStation’s VR2 headset was on the way, and it looked to be fairly soon - and we were right! Sony’s shiniest virtual reality offering is now confirmed to be adding official PC support via a nifty wired adapter at the start of August. It’ll cost £50/$60 - but whether it’s worth the price given a number of key features will be missing is another question entirely...

That coldness seems to have seeped into the company itself too, as they racked up their career-killing bodycount with nearly 100 more layoffs this week.

A brighter, stagier variety of action-role-playing, which deepens the connection between Italian folklore and Soulsliking established by last year&#x27;s Lies Of P. Well then: cast aside those ursine mitts, slip on a pair of immaculate white theatre gloves and get your thumbs into Enotria: The Last Song, which has a demo on Steam.

Aside from being a dry reflection of tabloid reporting on women who commit crimes (bad woman! sexy, bad woman!) this is also the kind of incidental character-building you can expect in this perky, retro-styled survival horror. It plays like Silent Hill charged with the hot pink body horror of Porpentine interactive fiction. And judging by my hour of unsettled strolling through the decrepit tube station of the game&#x27;s demo, it&#x27;s a powerful combo.

You answer the questions by looking ponderously down and pressing the big red and yellow buttons on the desk in front of you. The questions begin with relatively innocuous, CAPTCHA-style inquiries, such as &quot;is this a door?&quot; accompanied by a picture of a face. A few minutes later, there&#x27;s stuff like &quot;Are you alone?&quot; and &quot;Is it safe to be alone?&quot; and &quot;You are alone&quot; and yep, time to smash Pause or better, throw the Steam Deck behind the sofa and go stare out the window for a while.

                              <span>Roguelike FPS Wild Bastards is the space western follow up to 2019’s Void Bastards. It takes some of that game’s ideas, mainly those related to shooty and looty, and reforms them into a largely different can o’ campfire beans. This time, it’s less focused on exploration, more on individual, tense shoot-outs. You collect a cast of weirdos, each with different guns and abilities, and form the deadliest dang posse this side of the last tactical overworld map you descision&#x27;d your way through. I like what I&#x27;ve played so far, although I think a lot is going to hinge on how much evolution the mid-game offers. As always, here’s a Steam demo, if you want to be all contrary and &#x27;form your own opinions&#x27;. Pah.

                              <span>Witchy roguelike Hades 2 got a fresh update yesterday that sees a bunch of weapons getting stompier, thumpier, and, yes, whompier. It&#x27;s like the hammer of Hephaestus himself was put to work on the entire armory. The Moonstone Axe&#x27;s heavier attacks now channel faster, for one thing, which could make the most sluggish of the weapons a little more viable. I haven&#x27;t had a go at the re-jigged bashing yet myself but I trust from these patch notes it will be subtly noticeable.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve set aside some time this evening for Destiny 2&#x27;s latest expansion The Final Shape, which launched last night. My pal Liam suggested we play this evening because Bungie&#x27;s servers would inevitably go up in flames the moment it launched. And what do you know? The right decision was made. Are we smug about it? Yes. Anyway, the good news is that Bungie have put out a few of those fires, though there are still a few bugs to fix.

                              <span>Call me a Paranoid Android or a Suspicious Stanley, but when I ask a videogame developer a question and the videogame developer pauses for exactly 31 seconds and then says “no”, I tend to assume the answer is, in fact, “yes”. Or at least “it’s complicated”, to channel a bit of antique Facebook coyness. The Alters is a complicated game. It is a moody sci-fi extravaganza in which your character, beleaguered offworld miner Jan Dolski, has to create new versions of himself by branching off his own past timeline using a &quot;quantum computer&quot;, splitting the chain of events at trigger points by, say, having his younger self stand up to his domineering father rather than leaving home.

Půjde o novou generací mobilních procesorů Core Ultra, která navazuje na loňský Meteor Lake. Bude mít dva typy jader: efektivní E-jádra a výkonná P-jádra. Intel také prozradil, že půjde o kombinaci 4E+4P s vypnutým hyper-threadingem. Přidělování jednotlivých úloh závisí na operačním systému, jehož plánovač musí v reálném čase provádět úpravy nastavení vyvažující efektivitu s výpočetním výkonem v závislosti na intenzitě pracovní zátěže.</span>

                              <span>A popular GitHub repo and over 120 forks containing Switch emulation tutorials have been targeted by Nintendo. While most forks are now disabled, the main repository has managed to survive after being given the opportunity to put things right. Whether Nintendo appreciated the irony is unclear, but it appears that use of encoding as a protection measure to obfuscate links, was no match for the video game company&#x27;s circumvention skills.

The announcement post doesn&#x27;t go into much detail about either the reasons for the layoffs or how exactly Avalanche will be supporting the departing staff, adding only that &quot;our focus is now on supporting all Avalanchers through this challenging time&quot; and that &quot;we&#x27;re grateful for the invaluable contributions of those leaving and remain committed to creating incredible gaming experiences for our players.&quot;

                              <span>I was a diehard WipeOut player as a kid. Seriously, me and the boys used to roam the streets of Bradford looking for F-Zero players to bully, at least till the RollCagers rocked up and stole our lunch money. Mind you, I think I was probably less interested in WipeoUt&#x27;s racing than its trackside landscapes, which remain exquisite decades on - all those sweeping album-cover facades with their animate fixtures that thickened and solidified into full-blown peripheral cities as the series progressed. 


I am similarly hooked by the worlds of Ghosts Ehf&#x27;s Phantom Spark, which are a million lightyears from WiPeout in terms of their influences and atmosphere, much as the underlying hover-jockeying is a million lightyears away from WipeouT in terms of its gentleness and lack of combative elements. But these spaces are just as mesmerising to fly through and think about when not focussed on finding the perfect line through the next corner, or avoiding a patch of grass. Small wonder, given that the game&#x27;s art director is Joost Eggermont, whose streaking astral contraptions and &quot;small interactive moments&quot; I&#x27;ve long admired, but never managed to write about until now.

Then, I realised that some other people might be less enlightened than me about the whole ‘having limits’ things, and that there was a lot of money to be made hawking implants. Enter space strategy story-spewer Stellaris, specifically, it’s spost specent spee-LC The Machine Age. It adds many options for your space civs, most of which I’m too rusty with the ever-yawpening sandbox’s myriad nuances to appreciate. But what&#x27;s this? A new origin that lets you play as techno-religious corpo-cult obsessed with transcending the limits of their meat prisons through cybernetic augmentations? I recognise that from toys! Let’s do some clicking.

                              <span>Yes, I&#x27;ve played a portion of Elden Ring&#x27;s expansion Shadow Of The Erdtree and I think it&#x27;s brilliant. But there&#x27;s one thing I didn&#x27;t flesh out in the preview and that&#x27;s the DLC&#x27;s standalone levelling system, brought to our attention a month or so ago. Well, here I am to flesh it out! Be warned, though, the role of the system is a jarring thing to condense into words.

Life In Jars is this YouTuber I&#x27;ve followed for a while. He makes videos that might involve, say, scooping up some puddle water, leaving it in a sealed jar for a while, then coming back to it a few months later. He&#x27;ll report on the results, which are often tremendous. Look at the LIFE in that jar! The little wriggly lads just wriggling around. The blobs whose job is to float and squidge indiscriminately. A lovely bit of fauna sloshing about there, like a forest dwelling for those who implement the five-second rule. It&#x27;s a reminder that bog water is rather beautiful, actually.
Having spent three hours with Elden Ring expansion Shadow Of The Erdtree&#x27;s opening area, I can&#x27;t help but think of Life In Jars. What resides in the shadowy dome of the Big Tree is horrendous! Miserable! The forgotten creatures and their crumbling homes are grim. But oh my word, the shadows have spawned a beautiful disasterpiece. Just, errr, those other jars? The fun guys with the scoopy arms and little legs? Yeah. I have bad news.

                              <span>I usually avoid writing sentences that could easily be quoted on a Steam page, but the exquisitely satisfying sound that Grunn’s garden shears make is the exception. Please feel free to try any of these on for size: Grunn’s shear sound is the Wilhelm Scream of gardening equipment, sure to be referenced for decades to come. Grunn’s shear sound wormed its way past my eyes and into parts of my brain I’d previously assumed could only be accessed by either masterful ASMR or irresponsibly long Q-tips. I used to have anxiety, but now, my only fear in life is that Grunn’s grass will run out, so I no longer have a reason to click away with its shears. Play Grunn, innit. There are, by the way, lots of other things to like about it, although I cannot hear them over the wonderful sound of these shears.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been one month since the sound of engines began. The hardest track ever created in Trackmania was published by a team of mappers on May 4th, bringing an intimidating 16-floor tower called Deep Dip 2 into the racing game. It became a magnet for competitive drivers after a prize pool of over $30,000 was offered to the first three players to conquer its hellish heights. The prize has yet to be claimed. Even today, determined racers continue to bang their heads against the brutally designed course, featuring icy surfaces, curving rails, and perilous loop-the-loops that hang kilometres about the ground. Some players have parked their hopes and given up. But others persevere. The top three players have reached the final floor and currently stand shoulder to shoulder, eyes focused on the prize.

                              <span>If you heard loud swearing last night in the Watford area it may have been one of two things: 1) me cussing out my (borrowed) Steam Deck while stealthily accessing the wifi from outside a closed public library, as I don&#x27;t currently have broadband at home, or 2) me subsequently trying to make head or tail of Mech Engineer, in which you take charge of a mobile undersea metropolis and send squads of painstakingly assembled robosoldiers to semi-auto-battle squidgy alien fauna. 


Engineering a mech is a Herculean labour whose completion eludes today&#x27;s puny scientists, and Mech Engineer doesn&#x27;t aim to make life easier, whatever its putative status as a &quot;means of fun&quot;. Mech Engineer is a game with an attitude problem, frankly. I realised this on in-game day two, when the interface coughed up a bunch of damage reports presented as pieces of paper, which I then had to crumple up and toss away individually.

Where its offworld mining concern once dealt merely with steep drops and irate bugs, it’s since had to face down the robotic army of a rival mineral corp and an omnicidal alien plague. If the subsequent question is &quot;It used to be about the rocks, y&#x27;know?&quot; then DRG’s imminent Season 5 update, Drilling Deeper, is the answer.

Like A Dragon: Yakuza will be a six-part series following characters in the criminal underbelly of Kamurocho, set to straddle between two time periods: 1995 and 2005. The series &quot;showcases modern Japan and the dramatic stories of these intense characters, such as the legendary Kazuma Kiryu, that games in the past have not been able to explore,” said Amazon, who are releasing it through Prime Video, just like their Fallout series.

                              <span>We’ll never know exactly what sort of fiction Tom Clancy would have written if he was less interested in the calibre of specific bullets and their effiency at dismantling burgeoning socialist governments, and more so in the specific sigils required to blast a riot cop through a third story window. While charity shops across the land mourn this devasting loss to their paperback shelves to this very day, we do at least have a glimpse into what such a literary venture may have looked like. Oh, did you like that door? Was it your favourite door? Soz, pal. Strategy game Tactical Breach Wizards just hexed right through it with a new demo as part of Steam Next Fest. I’ve played it, and it’s very exciting stuff, not least for how differently it plays than what I’d expected.

Likely to be the most significant action of its type ever in Belgium, the blocking measures coincide with a growing number of similar actions around Europe.

                              <span>Honestly, I turn my back on shooter-of-note Helldivers 2 for (checks calendar)... one, maybe two weeks, and you all go and transform a planet into a black hole. &quot;You&quot; being the players who completed the metagame&#x27;s last Major Order and successfully pumped the Terminid supercolony of Meridia full of an experimental &quot;Dark Fluid&quot; - which Super-Earth, incidentally, pinched from the Illuminate faction during the First Galactic War, aka Helldivers 1.
Now, Meridia has imploded and become a radiant, wailing, purple-fringed disc of pure nothingness, with triumphant players rudely ejected from orbit via emergency hyperspace jump, but subsequently allowed to return and gaze into the dark heart of their victory. Great work, Inferno-plungers. I&#x27;m sure the consequences of this will be neither cosmic nor horrible.

                              <span>Update: Card Bard appears to be a copy of a game by another developer, Dire Decks by kindanice. Dire Decks was released in 2023 on itch.io and was well received there. Kindanice has pointed out the direct likeness between their game and the one released on Steam under another name. Yikes. Thanks to our diligent commenters for catching this. We&#x27;ll try to find out more. 
Original article: The onslaught of fun Steam Next Fest demos you can play right now continues and will not relent. Card Bard is a deckbuilding roguelike shooter in which your wee gunman is seemingly frozen in abject terror as little pill-shaped baddies creep towards him like bacteria on a petri dish. Good thing you have a hand of cards, each one showing how many bullets will bop forth from your body when you select it. It&#x27;s surprisingly tough for something so pastel-paletted. I&#x27;m 10th on the leaderboard. You can probably beat that, right?

                              <span>In EA&#x27;s Desert Strike - released way back in the dim salvages of 1992 - you are a helicopter pilot scooting around a Sylvester Stallone reinvention of Iraq, shooting down tanks and fighters with guns and missiles while rescuing VIPs and fretting constantly about your wafer-thin armour and espresso-sized fuel reserves. It was a no-frills piece of Gulf War fanfic, complete with George Bush ending cameo, and a well-made shooter that used to drive me nuts on Sega Mega Drive.
Megacopter: Blades Of The Goddess is Desert Strike, but heavily Blood-Dragonified and with a big dollop of Airwolf to boot. Here, the enemy troops are naughty Reptoid aliens, the writing is scattershot-satirical (upgrades are bought with pizza tokens) and your helicopter houses the soul of a blood-drinking &quot;AZ-TECH&quot; goddess. Is it a nuanced parody of the Strike series? It doesn&#x27;t feel like it. Did I enjoy the demo? Yes. Does it have a crawling tentacle boss called Queen Oildusa? Also yes, and will you please stop asking questions so I can write the rest of this article.

                              <span>Since the death of E3, June has descended into a chaotic clusterfunk of trailers, broadcasts, announcements, and a generalised frenzy of publicity-seeking barking noises. Summer Game Fest has emerged as a hub for a lot of developers seeking eyes. The 2-hour show hosted by marketing man Geoff Keighley will be broadcasting on Friday, blasting you in the ocular nerves with, probably, a lot of games. However, most of these games will not be brand new, exciting reveals, said Keighley himself in a fresh Twitch Q &amp; A. &quot;There will be, definitely, new announcements,&quot; he said, &quot;but the show is largely focused on, I think, existing games that have new updates for fans.&quot; He&#x27;s mentioning this ahead of time, he said, to set expectations.

                              <span>I&#x27;m sure you could fill a bottomless pit with the things Larian decided not to add to Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3. One of those things was, in fact, a bottomless pit. Not just a bottomless pit, but a conveniently portable, Looney Tunes-esque hole into which you could seemingly chuck everything from items and equipment to characters. Speaking to me during the same interview in which they discussed long-abandoned plans for bringing back Baldur’s Gate 1’s Candlekeep, Larian CEO Swen Vincke and Baldur’s Gate 3 lead writer Adam Smith (RPS in peace) touched on the subject with tantalising brevity. Argh, if only I hadn’t had to run off and catch a taxi, I’d still be there now, discussing the many applications of a portable hole. Bypassing carrying capacity limits would just be the start of it.

                              <span>If you love cosy games where the biggest challenge is choosing between which farm utensil to place next to your barn doors, then Tiny Glade may be just the game for you. It&#x27;s a creative building game like The Sims 4 but with none of the fuss of actually controlling lives - and no quests, combat or arbitrary challenges of any kind.

Instead, Tiny Glade simply offers a meadow and tools with which to build. The vibe of the game is cottage-core at its finest, with enough whimsigoth finery that you&#x27;ll soon lament that you can&#x27;t actually live inside your glorious creations. I&#x27;ve played the charming demo as part of Steam Next Fest, and you&#x27;ll find some thoughts from my time with it below.

                              <span>A DIY engineer has created a realistic tank simulator that puts the average haptic controller to shame. The mechanical monster is jury-rigged to the top of an office desk and must be reloaded with a new shell after every shot. The recoil is terrifying. It&#x27;s operated by three people: one person drives the tank with a steering wheel and levers, another uses cranks to aim the gun barrel, and a third reloads the shells that eject automatically from the chamber after every desk-lifting blast. The &quot;shells&quot; in question are 2-litre bottles of fizzy drink, and the crew has set up a whole rack of these bottles for panicked reloading. If you are the kind of person who yearns for the immersion of the legendary Steel Battalion controller then you will get a definite buzz from watching the death machine in action below.

                              <span>Spain&#x27;s Ministry of the Interior says eight people have been arrested after police dismantled a €5.3m pirate IPTV network serving local expats. Authorities aren&#x27;t naming the service but if the name TVMucho rings any bells, people are on the right track. That police identified the owner of the service is no surprise. The Dutchman has never hidden away and has continuously claimed his service operates legally. If only in part, it&#x27;s still streaming channels right now.

                              <span>On June 1, 1999, the first public release of Napster launched online, kick-starting a global piracy frenzy that never disappeared. At the same time, it can be argued that the file-sharing software paved the way for legitimate business models that would eventually evolve into subscription-based platforms such as Spotify and Netflix.

                              <span>It&#x27;s no secret that online piracy presents a major challenge to copyright holders. With owners of pirate sites largely unresponsive, search engines and other online intermediaries are often asked to intervene. With a starring role for anti-piracy company Link-Busters, Google has seen a significant surge in takedown requests, one that has set new records on the way.

                              <span>Data published by S2CPI, the body responsible for Spain&#x27;s administrative pirate site blocking program, shows that the number of headline domains blocked during Q1 2024 is noticeably down on the same period in 2023 and 2022. Overall, sites are still being blocked in large numbers, but the real growth isn&#x27;t found on main domains. Easily and quickly deployed at almost no cost, subdomains can circumvent blocking and Spain blocks them in their thousands.

                              <span>Reddit is not required to hand over to filmmakers the IP-addresses of several Redditors who made piracy-related comments. A California federal court denied the filmmakers&#x27; request for a &#x27;de novo&#x27; review, after turning down their initial request in February. While this is bad news for the movie companies, a viable alternative appeared recently.
