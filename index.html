                              <span>I’ve likely mentioned hitting Lovecraft fatigue so often that it’s now evolved into a second phase of Lovecraft-fatigue fatigue. This is not the same as Lovecraft refreshment, no matter how much I might want to return to the days before old one plushies and Cthulhu children’s books terrorised the internet en masse. There’s not quite enough information about “story generator” sim Marry a Deep One: Innsmouth Simulator for me to confidently say it’ll cut through my exhaustion with all things tentacular and horrifically be-gilled. But it is beguiling, isn’t it? There’s all sorts of little widgets and details shown off that remind me of everything from Sid Meier’s Pirates to classic adventure games, and maybe even a little Rimworld? It’s a heady soup, although one I’d recommend against quaffing, given where the water comes from.

                              <span>One of the best roguelikes on PC is getting a farewell of sorts this week. Twitchy slashfest Dead Cells received its final major update, introducing new enemies, fresh weapons, and a few mutations. Unfortunately, all this new stuff is very cursed. In other words, it all toys with the game&#x27;s &quot;curse&quot; status effect, a hex that causes you to be killed if you take even a single hit. You&#x27;ll probably die a few times as a result of this update, which in some ways is a fitting finalé for this fast-paced jar smasher of a game. You can see the new features in the trailer below.

                              <span>Last week, the Xitter account for H2M - a mod aiming to recreate the heyday of classic Modern Warfare 2 multiplayer inside Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered - announced that they had received a cease and desist from Activision Blizzard, and would shut down the project. The 2022 version of Modern Warfare 2 lacked the original’s multiplayer, and H2M was so highly-anticipated that Steam sales of the 2016 FPS balooned in the lead-up to the mod’s planned release date. It didn&#x27;t hurt that Activision had it on sale, of course, but the timing lined up so well that some fans speculated the discount was a deliberate bait-and-switch on the publisher’s part to profit from excitement over a mod they were already planning to shut down.

As ever, we have a way of thwarting the Maw&#x27;s advance, and it&#x27;s... pasta sauce? Graham, why is there pasta sauce in the Trello? Have Ziff Davis subfranchised us to Dolmio? Oh, I&#x27;m sorry! That&#x27;s just my shopping list. What I meant to say was: new video games! Video games (PC games, specifically) are the only thing that can preoccupy the Maw, the only thing newsworthy enough to distract it from the tempting clifftop maisonettes of Torquay. Let&#x27;s see what the week has in store for us, eh.

                              <span>When Bloober and Konami announced that they were remaking Silent Hill 2 as part of a comprehensive series reboot, it made immediate if slightly deflating sense to me. Silent Hill 2 is the more feted of the Hills - if I were a calculating franchise custodian tasked with &#x27;bringing back&#x27; one of the acclaimed original trilogy, that&#x27;s probably the instalment I and my spreadsheets would fix upon. I mean, it&#x27;s the game with Pyramid Head in it - the nearest thing Silent Hill has to a mascot, and it&#x27;s not like there&#x27;s an issue of cutting out plot material: each game in the Silent Hill series is, on some level, a distinct story with a distinct protagonist.

                              <span>Bring out yer Dead.
Motion Twin and Evil Empire have today released the final update for Dead Cells, wrapping things up after six years of DLC, content drops and patches on Switch. As the great Samwise Gamgee once said, &quot;Yes, Mr Frodo, it&#x27;s over now.&quot;
Update 35, fittingly titled &#x27;The End is Near&#x27;, refuses to go out with a whimper. The final update is packed with new additions like fresh weapons and curses, bonus customisation and a handful of new accessibility options to bring us back for just one more run.

                              <span>Launching this October.
PQube &amp; Octeto Studios have revealed the release date for Sky Oceans: Wings for Hire, an intriguing Skies of Arcadia-inspired RPG in which players partake in aerial combat controlled via classic turn-based gameplay.
Launching for the Nintendo Switch on 10th October 2024, there&#x27;s a demo available via Steam right now if you want to get a taste of the action ahead of its release. The general gist of the story, however, is that you take control of captain Glenn Windwalker who must recruit and manage a group of rag-tag pirates. You&#x27;ll be able to explore various locations on foot, but the real meat of the gameplay takes place in the skies.

If there&#x27;s one thing Geoff Keighley has been consistent at, it&#x27;s telling his audience that his events probably won&#x27;t be as good as they&#x27;re expecting.
Take this year&#x27;s Gamescom Opening Night Live event, for example. While we can expect to see some pretty exciting titles like Civilization VII and uh... some other games not currently slated for Switch, one upcoming banger that supposedly won&#x27;t be there is Hollow Knight: Silksong.

The glove’s ability summons a rock that resembles the icon this glove’s name carries. This rock creates a circular zone of effect and any player’s character that comes close to the rock is immediately turned into a ragdoll, rendering them ineffective.


Since the Moai glove serves great defensive purpose and secures easy slap count, obtaining it is not as simple.


To get the Moai glove in Slap Battles, players have to first acquire a Trap glove. As is often the case with Slap Battles, getting the Trap glove would first require you to get the Brick Master badge that needs the Brick glove to earn. If you alrea…</span>

These rewards also include the Sentinel Multitool and Jetpack which can be unlocked after a series of objectives, including solving a glyph puzzle


How to find a Harmonic Camp in No Man’s Sky


To get started, players would first have to find a Harmonic Camp. These can be found by defeating Corrupted Sentinels, who are most likely present on a Corrupted Planet. Look for a Dissonant star system, as they are your best bet for finding a Corrupted Planet in No Man’s Sky. Once you find a Corrupted Planet and defeat some Corrupted Sentinels, you should be able to find an Echo Locator. You may also find an Echo Locator by destroying Dissonance Resonators which are present near Corrupted Sentinels.


Harmonic Interface puzzle in No Man’s Sky


Select Echo Locator in your inventory and interact with it so that the Echo Locator “resonates”. Doing so will reveal the location of a Harmonic camp. Head to its location and interact with a computer there which is called the Harmonic Interface.


How to solve Harmonic Interface puzzle



To start the glyph puzzle, select “Scan memory registers”.


There will be three math puzzles for players to solve which are pretty easy. Just make sure you remember the answers you’ve given. They will come in handy for the next part of the puzzle.


Select “Access main interface” and choose “Input override glyphs”.


Now, you have to select glyphs with numbers that are the same as the results of the previous math questions.



That’s all there is to it. This will unlock the Sentinel Multitool and Jetpack, and players can find both items in the tent next to the Harmonic Interface.

                              <span>Freighters in No Man’s Sky are large space vessels that are capable of storing multiple starships and serve as a massive storage area for the wide array of resources that you run into and collect in No Man’s Sky. Moreover, Freighters make it possible for players to own Frigates and send them on missions. Frigates are larger than starships and are primarily designed for embarking on a variety of missions including exploration, combat, and trade.


Freighters in No Man’s Sky are also useful for building your squadron, which is essential if you’re interested in taking on fights in space, and do not want to bow down to rogue pirates. Your squadron consists of pilots you’ve met and recruited in your journey and they show up to your aid whenever you are under attack, providing decent backup.

                              <span>Helldivers 2 is a fantastic game that I&#x27;ve been playing pretty consistently since its launch in February 2024. Whenever an update buffed or nerfed a weapon, I never took it too seriously because the core gameplay is solid and enjoyable. However, the weeks following the Escalation of Freedom update&#x27;s release have revealed a glaring issue with the game, and it stems from developer Arrowhead Game Studios. 


When the Escalation of Freedom update was initially released, it was met with a lot of backlash from players who were angry about the weapon nerfs it brought. In fact, it caused such an uproar that Arrowhead Game Studios quickly responded with a 60-day plan to update the title and alter its balancing to bring it more in line with what players are after.

                              <span>Bloodborne&#x27;s PC version is the most desired game in the world — right above Bloodborne simply running at 60 FPS on PlayStation. Not a week goes by on the Internet without us hearing about new rumors that Bloodborne is totally coming to finally grace PC gamers with its gory awesomeness. Sadly, it&#x27;s not a reality yet, but rogue gaming science is getting us closer.


Not too long ago, hacker DwE revealed he&#x27;d been able to get Bloodborne to run on PC via the shadPS4 emulator, but he only had audio output. That might seem bad, but it was a sign that something could get out of it. Over a month later, we learned that DwE is finally getting to play Bloodborne, though the visuals are a bit different than what you&#x27;d expect:




The tweet above is in Portuguese, but the gist of it is easy to understand. DwE is using Linux and altered the game’s look to prevent the emulator from crashing. That’s why it looks less like the PC version of Bloodborne and more like it came out of Nintendo&#x27;s Virtual Boy. 


I really like the black and red color palette. It really drives home the notion that this version is likely cursed and that you probably shouldn&#x27;t play it, but I&#x27;m aware that it might not make for the most eye-pleasing experience if you plan to play the game for longer than 10 minutes at a time. 


An even newer video shows the game running without the color correction, but the sound and even a lot of the video are way too messed up for it to be enjoyable.




But if thought that a haunted version of Bloodborne on PC would be the only news we&#x27;d get about this project for a while, then I have good news. ShadPS4&#x27;s Twitter account has just revealed a screenshot of the retail version of the game running on PC with the correct colors.




What does that mean?  I don&#x27;t know, but I sure am eagerly waiting for whatever comes next.

There’s a very long list of forageables in Fields of Mistria, and each will only appear in certain seasons, with some even spawning in particular locations.

Warframe&#x27;s player base is well known for being friendly and welcoming, and Destiny 2 players are seeing this firsthand as the latest group of displaced MMO players in need of a game with a developer they feel they can trust. The Warframe subreddit is packed with thankful posts from new players, but it&#x27;s the way they&#x27;re being helped that&#x27;s so great. There are no spoilers, just hints about the next move to make, and misunderstanding a mechanic is never ridiculed as it might be in other communities.

Picking up samples for the Scientist in Dredge&#x27;s The Iron Rig DLC has been pretty simple while working through the game&#x27;s first two biomes, but this is where it gets tricky Stellar Basin is a dangerous area to explore without there being large puddles of contaminant that host creatures that can smash your boat if you&#x27;re not careful. That&#x27;s why, when the Scientist asks you to go there and collect some samples for him, you need to be prepared with the right gear and all the ideas.

                              <span>The epic conclusion of Attack on Titan is set to rumble through theaters later this year with a newly announced finale compilation film titled Attack on Titan The Movie: THE LAST ATTACK. This cinematic event will combine the two parts of the Attack on Titan Final Season THE FINAL CHAPTERS into one colossal 145-minute film, offering fans the chance to experience the story&#x27;s breathtaking conclusion in a single sitting.


Alongside the announcement of THE LAST ATTACK, a teaser trailer was released, providing a glimpse of what fans can expect. A visual for the film has also been revealed, which sets the stage for its November 8 release in Japan.




Directed by Yuichiro Hayashi, the mastermind behind the final season, THE LAST ATTACK is more than just a simple re-edit. According to Crunchyroll, Hayashi shared that the original storyboards for THE FINAL CHAPTERS were conceived with a movie format in mind, making this theatrical release a &quot;dream come true&quot; for him. The visuals have been updated from the original television broadcast to take full advantage of the big screen, ensuring that viewers will experience the series&#x27; climax in the best possible way.


Attack on Titan follows the story of humanity&#x27;s desperate struggle for survival in a world where giant humanoid creatures known as Titans have decimated civilization. The series centers around Eren Jaeger and his friends Mikasa Ackerman and Armin Arlert as they join the military to fight back against the Titans and uncover the dark secrets behind their existence.

Not all skins are created equal. Some will only cost a couple of cents - literally loose change you can find down the bottom of your couch. Others (often knives) will see you choose between the skin and the downpayment on a new house. There are definitely a few Counter-Strike 2&#x27;s AK-47 skins that will leave your jaw dropped.

However, anyone who has completed the base game knows there&#x27;s one final biome the DLC hasn&#x27;t referenced yet: Devil&#x27;s Spine. 


With Twisted Strand out of the way, you trigger another world event that causes the black contaminant seen all over the watery world of Dredge to appear on the waters of the toughest-to-explore biome. The Scientist now cowers behind his blackboard and asks only for the usual set of samples from the newly contaminated biome. Without any other guidance, it&#x27;s time to sail over, dodge the giant red angler fish that can crash your boat in a single attack, and gather every sample he needs.

It was the game that took the franchise&#x27;s single-player in a bold new direction, embracing an open-world campaign for the first time. It was an interesting experiment, one that makes Halo Infinite one of the most unique games in the series.


In this open world set on Installation 07, players can still complete a series of traditional campaign missions. These are separated by area, so once you&#x27;ve finished one location, you must move to the next to unlock the next set of missions.

                              <span>It has been 45 years since director Ridley Scott&#x27;s Alien first blew moviegoers away, and its cultural impact doesn&#x27;t seem to have diminished in the slightest. Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is still an icon, the Xenomorphs are still terrifying, and the franchise it has launched is still going strong. 


Having taken a few years off after some disappointing and confusing entries, the Alien franchise has finally returned with director Fede Álvarez&#x27;s Alien: Romulus, a film that certainly has its ups and downs and has even generated some division among Alien enthusiasts since debuting on August 16.


For the most part, Romulus brings the Alien series back to basics. It introduces a new crew of space colonist characters, led by Rain Carradine (Cailee Spaeny), who take it upon themselves to sca…</span>

                              <span>The Mother’s Blessing event is coming back in Diablo 4 Season 5, and it’s probably an even better incentive than ever to get back in. With all the positive changes that have been implemented this season, it’ll be great for many reasons, so here’s what you need to know.


Diablo 4 Season 5 Mother’s Blessing event details


To start off, the Mother’s Blessing event for Season 4 in Diablo 4 will begin on August 20, 2024, at 12 PM PST. It will run until August 27 at 10 AM PST. 


During this time, all players will earn 35% more XP and 50% more gold. You can do this either on your Seasonal characters or Eternal characters.

Is the Mother’s Blessing event worth going back in?


With the big increase in XP and gold gains, you can easily level up another character to level 100 in a few days. 


If you haven’t played Season 5 yet or are getting bored with your current character, now is the best time to hop in. The time it takes to level to 100 is a lot quicker compared to previous seasons and this just makes you hit the endgame faster.


Better yet, with the amount of Tempering, Enchanting, and Aspect Imprinting you’ll do, the amount of gold needed will increase dramatically. Namely, Enchantment re-rolling will cost upward of a million per re-roll after a few tries. 


With newer and way better ways to farm gold, you can make enough to comfortably re-roll your favorite items until you get the right stats. Alternatively, you can also use that gold to trade with other people. With it being fixed prior to an exploit that needed to be patched out, there’s more use of it there.


If you’re willing to take the dedicated grinding route for the best build for your seasonal characters, you have to grind gold since it’s the ultimate endgame resource. Take that over the XP.

                              <span>Alien: Romulus is finally out, and you know it&#x27;s a true Alien sequel because it immediately weirded out fans and moviegoers alike. 


Even though it&#x27;s currently sitting at 81% on Rotten Tomatoes, many are criticizing the movie for its supposed blatant lack of originality. This is the first Alien movie to come out since Disney&#x27;s acquisition of FOX, so the accusation that Romulus is the Force Awakens of the series seems fitting. 


A large part of the new film feels old, like a wacky collage of small higher-budgeted remakes of the best moments in the entire series, but I think that one moment specifically is actually a ripoff of an Alien-unrelated property.

For the fish wing, these items are (unsurprisingly) fish, and they all have their own requirements which must be fulfilled in order to catch them. 


Some fish are harder to catch then others, and those inside the Mines can prove to be particularly evasive. Thankfully, there are few things you can do to improve your chances of finding them all, including the Stone Loach.

The Stone Loach is a fish which can be located in the Upper Mines (Floors 1 - 20). If you’re looking for a Stone Loach, you’ll need to find a medium sized shadow, but sometimes it just isn’t that simple, and even …</span>

Provided they don&#x27;t crash your system.


Vampire Survivors&#x27; Darkasso update is a meaty one with a new challenge stage, relic, the aforementioned Darkanas, new character skins, and, of course, some additional surprises. It&#x27;s the Darkanas that have been causing havoc for players, though, and they haven&#x27;t been shy about sharing their experiences in the update on the game&#x27;s subreddit.

Hello everyone, and welcome back to another edition Box Art Brawl!
We had a doozy of a brawl last week as we looked at The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past and Four Swords for the GBA. You folks really surprised us with this one, though: we weren&#x27;t too keen on the Japanese box art for this, deemed it to be fairly busy in comparison to the others, but your votes are the ones that matter, and so Japan won the day with 47% of the vote. Europe came in second place with 29%, and North America managed 25%.

                              <span>Square Enix is publishing this enhanced version.
During Nintendo&#x27;s June Direct, Square Enix announced an enhanced version of Mistwalker&#x27;s turn-based Apple Arcade RPG Fantasian on multiple platforms including the Switch.
FANTASIAN Neo Dimension (from the creator of the Final Fantasy series Hironobu Sakaguchi) has now been rated by the ESRB, and it&#x27;s revealed a little bit more about what to expect from this new enhanced release. The game was also previously locked in for a &#x27;Holiday 2024&#x27; launch on the Switch - so it seems it&#x27;s still on track for this window.

Earlier this week, the joyous storybook adventure &#x27;The Plucky Squire&#x27; locked in a September release date for the Switch.
If you were hoping for a physical release, you&#x27;re in luck. The development team has now revealed a hard copy is on the way. No date or platforms have been mentioned just yet, but it has been confirmed it won&#x27;t be ready for the game&#x27;s launch on 17th September 2024.

Back in June, it was discovered The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom would include amiibo support. We&#x27;ve got a little bit of extra information revealing how exactly amiibo functionality will work in the game.
This information comes from the official Japanese game website, and according to a translation, amiibo will unlock useful items for Zelda&#x27;s adventure, as well as different colours of clothing.

                              <span>Almost two years after Radiohead released &#x27;In Rainbows&#x27; as a pay-what-you-like album, the track &#x27;These Are My Twisted Words&#x27; leaked on private torrent site What.cd. Many believed that the band itself was responsible, something we highlighted in our August 2009 article. Coinciding almost perfectly with the leak&#x27;s 15-year anniversary, a complaint filed with Google now claims that the report violates copyright law and must be permanently deindexed from search results.

                              <span>The Iron Rig is the final expansion for Dredge, but its story takes place alongside the base game&#x27;s. While playing, it&#x27;s difficult to know if there&#x27;s a point of no return that will end the game before you&#x27;re done. Thankfully, I&#x27;ve been through the entire thing and can tell you exactly what to do as you near the end of the DLC.


After starting The Iron Rig, you&#x27;ll be sent on a series of new Pursuits that see you visit or revisit, depending on where you are in Dredge&#x27;s story, every biome in the game. The rig, the DLC&#x27;s new location, is massively imposing and always looked to me like it would be the focal point for the game&#x27;s ending. This isn&#x27;t the case, and the DLC&#x27;s ending happens separately from the base game&#x27;s, but they&#x27;re intertwined in a way you may want to know about.

BitLife is aware of this, and it&#x27;s celebrating the Olympics by having a sports-themed challenge asking you to become a famous soccer player.

                              <span>The team behind Silent Hill 2: Enhanced Edition, a mod that&#x27;s widely regarded as the best way to play the original game on PC, has announced that it will launch the mod&#x27;s final update on August 30, 2024, leaving plenty of time to play and prepare for the upcoming remake. 


The final update for Silent Hill 2: Enhanced Edition is being touted as the biggest that it&#x27;s ever received. While we don&#x27;t have all the details on every change and upgrade it adds just yet; we do know that among them is improved water physics. It might sound trivial for a survival horror game, but water physics was the hallmark of a good video game back when Silent Hill 2 was initially released in 2001, so it&#x27;s nice to see it finally catching up with its modern-day competition.

&quot;Y&#x27;all, I expected this game to be hard, but dude,&quot; KittyRawr said before getting disrupted. Towards the end of the session, Kitty said she &quot;was a sweaty mess,&quot; likely due to how much she had to use her feet for button inputs. &quot;I&#x27;ll be honest I was only able to get through the past three levels; it&#x27;s rough.&quot; 




Crash Bandicoot is funnily known as the Dark Souls of platformers as you need precise timing and awareness of what&#x27;s happening around the bandicoot. The first game, in particular, is challenging. In our review for the N&#x27;Sane Trilogy, we say that t…</span>

However, developer Crytek is acting swiftly to address all concerns and streamline the game to suit players as quickly as possible. 


I caught wind of players&#x27; issues with Hunt: Showdown 1896 soon after launch when they began sharing them on Twitter. The two main pain points for long-time fans who received the update and are now having to get used to everything are the new placements of pretty much every element, from settings to loadouts, and the flow of the game between picking a character, then weapons, and finally getting into a match.

                              <span>If you’ve been looking for a fresh new take on life simulation, then inZOI might be the answer to your prayers. From KRAFTON, the developer behind PUBG: Battlegrounds, inZOI is set to revolutionize the life sim genre, and you can try out character creation for yourself later this month. 




Like many long-time The Sims players, I’ve sunk hours of my life into character creation, downloading CC to improve my characters and tweaking the most minute of details. With that said, inZOI looks to have made some major improvements on what I’ve grown used to, and I can see myself sinking at least 20 hours into the Character Studio alone. 


Speaking of the Character Studio, it will go live on Steam for just five days on August 21 before going offline again on August 26. This sneak peek into the potential competitor to The Sims will come just one day after we get to see a brand new trailer for inZOI at Gamescom 2024 Opening Night Live.

According to a press release from KRAFTON, the Character Studio features over 250 customization options, including the following:



Length and style of hair


Sleeves on a shirt


Age


Fingernails


Height


Body Type


Complexion

The Character Studio also uses generative AI in order to create truly unique patterns on items of clothing, and players are encouraged to share their creations on ‘Canvas’, which is a built-in platform where the community can share their creations, similar to The Sims 4 Gallery. 


KRAFTON is also partnering with Overwolf, a platform that allows creators to create and monetize in-game apps, mods, and more. The hope is that the partnership will allow inZOI players to build on the base game and add further customization options as soon as the game launches into Early Access, which is set to be sometime in late 2024.

                              <span>Being a Clash of Clans player, I can understand that choosing the right hero equipment is a big deal for everyone. Currently, there are 22 Hero Equipments, with Magic Mirror being the most recent. Basically, these pieces of equipment can buff up your heroes in terms of damage, health recovery, etc. But not every Hero Equipment is effective in battles.


To help you sort that out, we crafted a tier list for all the hero equipment so that you can find the best one that you are looking for. We have divided the rankings into five tiers: S, A, B, C, and D.

Hero Equipment that is in S-Tier is top-class in Clash of Clans. You don&#x27;t want to miss them, as they can provide the ultimate edge over your opponent in a match.…</span>

This week, the company informed the court that these claims fall flat, arguing that copyrighted books are nothing more than statistical correlations to its AI models.

Wheeeeey, the weekend&#x27;s here again, which means it&#x27;s time to pop on our most comfortable slippers and get some gaming done.
Looking back on this week, the most interesting piece of news (well, &quot;interesting&quot; in an oh-god-when-will-it-end kind of way) was that the &#x27;Switch 2&#x27; likely won&#x27;t be launching until after the current fiscal year, which ends March 31st, 2025.

                              <span>Larissa Knapp, the MPA&#x27;s new Chief Content Protection Officer, and the team at ACE have announced the shutdown of several US-based pirate IPTV services. The FBI veteran revealed the closure of AnytimeTV plus other pirate brands, and a settlement with three operators worth over $2m. After appearing to disregard the importance of security, shutting down now may have helped to avoid a larger bill, further down the road.

Toward the beginning of Perfect Organism: An Alien: Isolation Companion, author Andy Kelly asks a question that, to an outsider, might seem particularly pertinent: why write an entire book about one game? However, to those who have ever held a deep passion for a piece of pop culture, whether it be a film, a book, or a game, there’s an innate sense of understanding right from the start. After all, who hasn’t felt a burning desire to harp on about their favourite game for hours on end to anybody willing to sit down and listen? It’s only natural that when we love something so completely, we want to talk about it.
This, ultimately, is what makes Perfect Organism such a pleasant read; it could only have been written by someone who loves Alien: Isolation from top to toe. I’ve experienced far too many books based on the world of video games that felt like they were written out of some begrudging obligation, but Andy Kelly’s exploration of Creative Assembly’s outstanding survival horror is simply overflowing with love and enthusiasm. As somebody who holds a similar passion for the game and the Alien franchise as a whole, it resonated with me deeply.

Chapter 2 will drop on 22nd August, while Chapter 3 will arrive on 27th August, a few days before the game releases. Plus, all of your progress will carry over to the full release.

Fortunately, Switch caters to gamers on both ends of the spectrum, whether you&#x27;re after a brief amuse-bouche or a 12-course blow-out meal with all the trimmings.

Originally released back in 1996, Shadow of the Templars (or Circle of Blood, as it was known in North America), received high praise for its writing, art direction, voice action, and story.

                              <span>Baroque wilderness-builder Nightingale has not been doing brilliantly since Ed Thorn described the launch early access version as &quot;a numbers grind disguised as a gaslamp survival game&quot;. We had moderately high hopes for it before the early access release - I personally enjoy the fairytale setting, with its pop-up Pucks and magic umbrellas, but I also think I&#x27;ve raised enough hovels on procedurally generated maps for one lifetime. Still, I&#x27;d quite like it to come good, if only so I can justify op-eds about Lewis Carroll, and I&#x27;m somewhat encouraged by what I&#x27;ve heard of the game&#x27;s forthcoming Realms Rebuilt update.

                              <span>There you are, rambling through the woods of Interactive Entertainment with an empty pack and a spring in your step. Here I am, lying in wait behind a tree. Wham! Bam! You reel back in consternation as I bounce into the path and clobber you with a sack containing no less than eight venerable RPGs, from Baldur&#x27;s Gate to Warhammer 40,000: Rogue&#x27;s Trader - well over a thousand hours worth of dungeons, dragons, dicerolls, dwarven shopkeepers and many other things I refuse to spend time alliterating, all of which will (currently) set you back just £32.07. 


Were you planning to spend this weekend playing some cute two-hour artgame sideshow, without any levelling at all? Shut up, you DOLT. You will play what the nice journalist tells you to play! Best lay in extra caffeine tablets, because it&#x27;s going to take you till Monday just to get through the character creators alone.

                              <span>Black Myth: Wukong is an action RPG that leans a bit into the Souls camp and a bit into the adventure camp. And either way, it&#x27;s a spectacular journey that works for mostly everyone: those after challenging fights against Chinese mythological creatures, and those after the same thing, but with a little less challenge than your typical Soulslikes. What separates Black Myth from the crowd, though, is its slick presentation and a sense of generosity. You&#x27;re to witness the most lavish, cinematic worlds and its creatures. And you&#x27;re to enjoy battering everything with your staff as a highly athletic monkey with copious spells at his furry follicles and fingertips. It&#x27;s been a while since I&#x27;ve played anything quite as impressive as this.

The strategy game’s 5.2 update is on the horizon, and tagging along with it are the first of the “extra bits” the team teased in June. I’m very excited about them. They sit somewhere between the usual patch fare of stat tweaks and errata, and the weightier faction facelifts that come alongside paid DLC. They’re also focused right where Immortal Empires needs them the most: depth, rather than width. In the dawi’s case, quite literally.

                              <span>The mountain biking of Lonely Mountains: Downhill was sometimes a relaxing ride down gentle slopes, and at other times a hairy hurtle down declivitous cliffs. Alongside the likes of the Descenders and Riders Republic, it offered a more laid-back game, open to furious time trialling but always remembering to let you stop and appreciate the view. Both the stakes and the poly count were low. Happy news then, that it is getting a snowy sequel. In Lonely Mountains: Snow Riders you&#x27;ll be swapping your bike for a pair of skis, and you&#x27;ll be able to barrel down the mountainside with friends in co-op.

                              <span>The Fallout universe is full of little minigames that shake up the dominant exploration and first-person shooter gameplay, such as the lockpicking and hacking minigames. The former is straightforward to grasp. But the latter? Not so much. But we’ve got you! Seriously, relax, it’s going to be fine. This is all good.

There will soon be an opportunity to judge whether that feat is likely. Krafton have announced that they&#x27;re releasing a time-limited trial of Inzoi&#x27;s character creator next week on August 20th.

I know there are several railway management sims kicking around Steam, but I haven&#x27;t found the one that does it for me yet. Could it be Railroad Corporation 2? It&#x27;s a train tycoon game in which you lay tracks through the early 20th century, and it&#x27;s launching in Early Access on September 9th.

It now has a release date: September 17th.

Last time I checked in, it was school trips to other dimensions. Now, it&#x27;s Cosmic Storms. Due for release alongside the Stellaris 3.13 Vela update on September 10th, these are a paid &quot;mechanical expansion&quot; (priced at a rather chunky £11, $13 or €13, and available as part of the current season pass) that builds upon the game&#x27;s existing Space Storms, &quot;providing a deeper experience with strategically meaningful gameplay and beautiful upgraded visuals&quot;. Wash that down with new civics, precursor narratives, anomalies, archaeology sites, techs, edicts, a new Ascension perk, and new galactic community resolutions.

                              <span>Tiny Glade is a relaxing, wholly escapist building sim where you can kick back and summon villages, cottages and castles whilst listening to whimsical tunes without the worry of combat or busywork. This cosy game has received a lot of attention, becoming the fourth most-played demo during Steam Next Fest and earning a place within our own list of favourite demos. It now has a release date - 23rd September 2024.

You remember that thing, right? Plus, no-one’s got a big enough table. Or the new errata. Also, Trevor’s been banging on about lady Custodes for five months straight and nobody wants to be around him right now. Thank the Omni-trevor, then, for the three-player co-op of Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2. “Warhammer with the boys?” said Horace as he stretchily dished out preview keys from an entirely different postcode. James, Edwin and Nic were initially all booked-up for the week, but Horace repeated himself, making it absolutely clear that it wasn’t a question.

                              <span>Earlier this week there was some minor Discourse about the removal of the Erotica photography tag from the Dead Rising remaster. Some readers characterised this as a familiar species of cultural hypocrisy regarding video games - emphasising violence is A-OK, but for the love of god, don&#x27;t mention sex. Good news, those people: Dread XP&#x27;s latest horror signing The Lacerator has both. It casts you as hirsute 1980s porn star Max - surname not given in press release, but presumably something like Jackin&#x27; or Girth - who has been abducted by a large scary individual called the Lacerator.

                              <span>I was all set to plunge into Blackbird and Gearbox&#x27;s Homeworld 3 this spring when I received a slightly underwhelmed intergalactic transmission from Nic, praising the game&#x27;s atmosphere and story while ruminating over fussy controls and a want of tactical depth. Like a herd of frigates scenting a pride of destroyers lurking behind a nearby asteroid, I rerouted hastily and took up a holding position approximately one astronomical unit from the Buy button, hoping that the developers might iron out a few of the wrinkles.

                              <span>Over 2000 hours spent in various factory games makes me a bit of a purist, I suppose. In theory, I should then be the ideal reviewer to enjoy Shapez 2. But I&#x27;m also the ideal reviewer to tear it apart over the most minor hiccups and defects. I&#x27;m the Anton Ego of factory games. I don&#x27;t like food, I love it. If I don&#x27;t love it, I don&#x27;t swallow.
Ah, you needn&#x27;t worry. This is by far the most fun I&#x27;ve had reviewing a game, and Shapez 2 has, in my mind at least, turned the holy trinity of factory games (Factorio, Satisfactory, Dyson Sphere Program) into a holy quartet. Its pared back, everything-is-free-forever approach is quite liberating, and I&#x27;ve never had so much fun placing conveyor belts in my life. But 40 hours into my save file, I&#x27;ve often found myself yearning for a bit more creativity in the challenges, a few more curveballs sent in my direction.

                              <span>It’s an oddly Halloweeny summer week for games, this one. Dragon Age: The Veilguard’s October 31st release date leaked earlier, Steam have put together a Summer Fright Night bundle featuring RPS fave Hauntii, and I’ve got a strange urge to gorge on Haribo and mini Double Deckers until blood comes out of my eyeballs. What a perfect time, then, to dive into the alpha demo for vampire management game Blood Bar Tycoon, especially since Two Point seem to be resting on their laurels a bit too comfortably for my liking.
The idea here is you build a swanky bar serving claret cosmopolitans, ichor-ish coffees and uh, viscera vampiros to your undead clientele. But (with the sorta exception of the crimson-sapped Dracaena cinnabari) blood doesn’t grow on trees, so you’ll also be moonlighting as a human-nabber. You’ll research a slew of “whacky contraptions” to extract their blood, which I greatly enjoy, because “zany exsanguination” is a real winner of a feature. You can’t frivolously phlebotomise with impunity, however - you’ll also want to be on the lookout for vampire hunters aka the fun police.

Electronic Arts had planned to share the game&#x27;s debut-day in about... *checks watchless wrist* ... 7 hours, as part of a special release date trailer. But the internet will ever internet, and thanks to some slip-up or other, we have the knowledge just a smidge early. Will I tell you what the actual release date is? Sure. I guess so.

                              <span>Steam’s seeing a good few sweeping changes of late. They’ve recently added a ‘Trending Free’ tab to separate the no money down and no, money down playables. And, as of September, they’re cracking down on links to other websites in store pages. Now, horror of horrors, they’re coming for your ascii gigachads and “nobody is going to read this review so I’ll just say I’m gay” bangers. The changes are part of their ‘New Helpfulness System’, outlined here.
The new system, which will be enabled by default but can be toggled off, aims to “help potential players make informed decisions about the games they are considering purchasing by understanding the attributes of the game that other players like or don&#x27;t like.” Ah, so a sort of ‘review’, if you will. I like it!

With the Ryzen 9000 series the Zen 5 cores have a full 512-bit data-path compared to the &quot;double pumped&quot; 256-bit data path found in the Zen 4 processors as well as the Strix Point SKUs. In this article is an AVX-512 enabled versus disabled comparison for not only the Ryzen 9 9950X but also the prior generation Ryzen 9 7950X and looking too at the CPU power use, thermals, and peak frequency when engaging a variety of AVX-512 workloads.</span>

                              <span>After years of legal proceedings, New Zealand Justice Minister Paul Goldsmith has approved Kim Dotcom&#x27;s extradition to the United States. The Megaaupload founder faces criminal copyright infringement, racketeering, and money laundering charges, which in theory could lead to decades in prison. Dotcom says he has a plan and doesn&#x27;t intend to leave the country.

Whether both will actually see the inside of a cell is unclear; one turned up to face the music, the other failed to appear. The reason for his absence is unknown and just the start of a long list of other unanswered questions.

Today is their day. We have lined up these racing games on a starting grid and are interested to see how things shake out. Will the realism-obsessed driving sims take the lead with their sublime physics engines? Might the futuristic combat racers simply destroy the opposition with explosive rockets? Or perhaps a nippy arcade crowd-pleaser will soar to the finish line, propelled by the sound of roaring cheers. It&#x27;s all to play for here at our incredibly messed-up grand prix with a worrying lack of rules or regulation. Start your engines, everyone, these are the 11 best racing games on PC. 3! 2! 1! ...

                              <span>The next advance in video game graphics technology is not ray-tracing or tray-racing or any variation thereof - it&#x27;s janky stop motion and rubbish plastic dolls, and it actually began about 30 years ago, when I watched the Adam and Joe show for the first time. If you never watched the Adam and Joe show, they used to do home movie recreations of famous films like Titanic and Saving Private Ryan using stuffed animals and action figures. I found these &quot;Toymovies&quot; hysterical as a kid - I suspect they are less so now. Probably, they are full of jokes we might tentatively class as &quot;of their time&quot;. The point is, Reptilian Rising is sort of Toymovie: The Game.

                              <span>The Crimson Diamond is a proper old-school style puzzle adventure. It&#x27;s 2D pixel art, with a limited colour palette as in EGA games, and you control it with a text parser, like King&#x27;s Quest or one of them other Sierra adventures old men like Graham remember. It&#x27;s important to mention this up front because it&#x27;s very possible that, despite The Crimson Diamond&#x27;s tale of betrayal, murder, and mineral rights in 1914 Canada, the text parser element will be a Rubicon you instantly can&#x27;t be arsed to cross. A not unreasonable stance - though I think the text parser in The Crimson Diamond is fantastic. Such beef that I have with this adventure game is down to the specificity required to solve some of the puzzles.

                              <span>KIBORG: Arena feels like a throwback in several ways that I quite enjoy. It’s a free prologue to the upcoming cyberpunk puncher KIBORG. The titular arena is a large room in which you, a large man, bash a large amount of enemies. You have to punch a gong between waves to trigger the next, and this struck me as a nice pre-emptive nudge that every problem you face in Kiborg can be solved by rapidly moving your fist towards offending objects, which turned out not to be too far off the mark.

Since then, we&#x27;ve heard nary a peep about it, with developers Obsidian focusing on Pillars Of Eternity successor Avowed and their ace survival game Grounded, which left early access in September 2022. According to Obsidian&#x27;s studio head Feargus Urquhart, the project is rubbing along nicely. But it was not ever thus: during the opening years of the Covid pandemic, there was apparently &quot;talk of &#x27;do we stop Outer Worlds 2 and just throw the whole team on Avowed&#x27;.&quot;

                              <span>Valve have made no secret of their plans to make SteamOS – the Linux-based operating system that powers the Steam Deck – available to other games-playing devices, including rival handhelds. After a recent beta update mentioned adding support for the Asus ROG Ally’s inputs, The Verge confirmed with Valve that SteamOS support for non-Steam Deck portables is still very much in the works. The Deck’s long-promised dual booting capability, on the other hand, sounds further down the to-do list.

                              <span>It’s been looking grim for Super Earth recently. I mean, not really. Multiplayer shooty Helldivers 2 is still sitting around 35,000 concurrent players, which is perfectly respectable, if only around 10% of its peak back in April. Still, a clutch of disgruntled ‘divers have recently found a novel way to protest an increasingly unpopular series of nerfs: laying down their guns and letting the bots take the damn planet.
“If Super Earth wanted to remain safe, they would stop nerfing our guns,&quot; reads one comment on the subreddit, in response to a post titled “Let the bots advance. Let the Super Earth burn.” It seems to have picked up some steam inside the actual game, too. As of earlier this week, there’s only around a thousand players actively trying to stop the bots advancing perilously close to the home planet, via Gamesradar.
Whether this is all massively overblown for the sake of a dramatic yarn or not, Arrowhead themselves have taken note of player concerns over nerfs. Yesterday, game director Mikael Eriksson unveiled a plan for the next 60 days, directly addressing player feedback over the controversial ‘Escalation of Freedom’ update.

                              <span>Finding and sharing Free Stuff is one of the time-honoured duties of the video game journalist or SEO-monger. Back when I was OXM&#x27;s online editor, &quot;free Xbox games&quot; was one of our golden Google pillars, the other two being &quot;Minecraft Xbox 360 update&quot; and &quot;Skyrim something something&quot;. Well, uncle Valve has just rudely torpedoed that ancient investigative initiative by adding a Trending Free tab to the Steam frontpage, encompassing prologues, demos, free-to-play games and that most treasured of jewels, a full free game with no monetisation elements, such as Grimhook.
Do not cry for us pitiful electronic scribblers, crowded on our melting internet icebergs. Play free games instead! Thanks to that new tab, I&#x27;ve just discovered a demo for neato wide-format tower defender Frontline Crisis. Hah, that&#x27;ll keep the awareness of steady livelihood erosion at bay.

                              <span>File-hosting service Uptobox was taken offline last year following complaints from entertainment industry giants including Amazon, Disney, and StudioCanal. The platform&#x27;s servers were targeted in a police raid just months after a French court ordered ISPs to block the site. Uptobox tried to reverse this decision, arguing that it&#x27;s not the piracy haven rightsholders make it out to be, but the court denied that challenge.

                              <span>Top tier French football leagues, Ligue 1 McDonald&#x27;s and Ligue 2 BKT, have obtained a new court order to block dozens of pirate IPTV platforms. As presented on the Paris Judicial Court&#x27;s website, the list of domains amounts to a wall of merged text simply asking to be misinterpreted. Fortunately they&#x27;re more easily determined in the downloaded order, but that doesn&#x27;t mean precision blocking won&#x27;t be needed. Perhaps now more than ever, one mistake could go terribly wrong.

                              <span>Aside from being a game where you run around a shopping mall murdering the living dead, the original Dead Rising from 2006 is a clownish satire of sleazy tabloid photojournalism. It expresses this by way of its scoring system, where you earn &quot;Prestige points&quot; for snapping pictures that fit one of five categories: &quot;Brutal&quot; scenes of characters being slain; moments of &quot;Horror&quot;, such as the spectacle of an approaching horde; comical &quot;Outtakes&quot;, like characters caught in bizarre poses; moments of &quot;Drama&quot;, such as people reacting to discoveries; and &quot;Erotic&quot; photos of women alive or undead, which range from snaps of exposed underwear to close-ups of cleavage.
The Erotica tag has, however, been chopped from the Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, in what Capcom gingerly suggest isn&#x27;t &quot;a response to a changing cultural climate&quot;, but expressive of the view that earning points from such photos is not &quot;an appropriate reward for survival and not a skill required of a journalist trying to stay alive&quot;.

                              <span>The Steam Deck’s competitors, whether they’re the old guard Ayaneo family, the luxe Asus ROG Ally X, or the shapeshifting Lenovo Legion Go, usually share the same attack line: they can play more of your games. The Deck’s compatibility issues aren’t nearly as issue-some as they were at launch, but between its Linux-based SteamOS and its relatively mild processing power, but it is true that beefier Windows handhelds will more likely cater to your entire cross-launcher library.
Unless, that is, you get something else to run them for you. Streaming games on the Steam Deck has emerged as a nifty workaround for the portable PC’s lingering compatibility woes, making even officially unsupported games playable. Usually with much better performance, too, as the actual rendering work is done remotely – what you see on the Deck’s screen is basically a video feed of that remote device’s display output, with your control input beamed the other way via a low-latency connection. And because you’re not using SteamOS or the internal hardware to actually run the game, it’s not bound by their limits.

Games like Maelstrom, Ambrosia&#x27;s Macintosh clone of Asteroids, and the proto-shmup Crystal Quest from Patrick Buckland, who would go on to make Carmageddon. Little did I know that the humble premise of a small 2D spacecraft shooting baddies on a wrap-around screen would reach the glittering heights of Nova Drift. Had you shown me this game back in 1995, I dare say I&#x27;d have shmupped myself.

                              <span>The survivors in the upcoming Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster - itself an update of the 2016 HD version of the 2006 zombie open-mall action game - are still idiots. I’m starting to regret giving Burt a gun, honestly. Every time he bumps into a magazine rack he starts screaming like someone’s eating his face, and the little circle above his name turns red to indicate he’s in danger. That’s a mannequin, Burt. They can’t hurt you. They’re actually known for not being able to move.

                              <span>As long-time readers will know, I&#x27;m a piteous mark for weird little game guys. I’m currently trying to puzzle out what the titular Mother Machine in The Curious Expedition studio Maschinen-Mensch’s upcoming co-op platformer refers to. But, if it’s a reference to forming a parental bond with what the game has saw-me-comingishly named “chaos gremlins”, I&#x27;m way ahead of you.
Ah, the press release speaketh! Probably should have read some more before I began exclaiming “Chaos Gremlins!” over and over. Have an announcement trailer.

                              <span>Among the many, Gigery beauties of 2014&#x27;s Alien: Isolation is that you save using an in-game, wall-mounted Emergency Phone - a maddeningly analog process of slotting a keycard into the machine and waiting for three beeps. Doing this requires you to stand upright in full view, with your back turned upon an entire space station&#x27;s worth of shiny domed technology and guttural industrial noises. Delightful!
Amongst the players harrowed and compelled by this fixture is Fede Álvarez, director of the 2013 Evil Dead remake, 2016&#x27;s Don&#x27;t Breathe and, most recently Alien: Romulus - the seventh and avowedly &quot;back to basics&quot; Alien movie. Isolation is the Alien experience that convinced Álvarez the Alien could still be scary, after decades of milking the creature&#x27;s dugs for spin-off movies and making it share a screen with the Predator, the Pepsi Max to Alien&#x27;s Dom Pérignon 1921. In possibly self-defeating homage to Creative Assembly&#x27;s work, he&#x27;s filled the movie with Emergency Telephones, turning them into a straightforward-sounding form of foreshadowing.

                              <span>Everyone loved Half-Life yet no one in 1998 was brave enough to say: &quot;Okay, but what if this was an early access crafting survival game voiced by a bunch of New Zealanders?&quot; Those 90s cowards. Abiotic Factor is the courageous game that has been correcting this historic oversight. It&#x27;s fun, and the fun just got funnerer. The &quot;Crush Depth&quot; update, released yesterday, adds a heap of new areas to the game&#x27;s messed-up scientific facility, including a dangerous Security Sector and a vast reservoir zone called the Hydroplant. On top of that there are new weapons, tools, workbenches, drivable vehicles, fishing rods, and quite a bit more. It&#x27;s all shown off in the trailer below.

                              <span>Valve&#x27;s third-person hero shooter Deadlock hasn&#x27;t been officially revealed yet, but thousands of you unscrupulous devils have been playing it thanks to stolen development builds. Speculation abounds that these &quot;leaks&quot;, coupled with Valve&#x27;s obstinate silence about it, are a calculated publisher psyop. Are they deliberately letting people play the game early so as to temper the marketing rollout in some way? Perhaps handle any initial player criticism under cover of non-announcement? It seems unlikely, but as other writers have pointed out, this is Valve, unaccountable elder god of PC gaming. I guess we should be thankful it isn&#x27;t another Half-Life tease.

Well, root my toots. Unless you’re Australian, in which case don&#x27;t do that. Just enjoy the now very much confirmed-looking release of the original Red Dead Redemption on PC. That’s according to a listing on the PlayStation Store, which contains the currently inaccurate but tantalising phrase “now on PC for the first time ever.”

Last week, Russian telecoms operators gave RuTube another boost by massively throttling YouTube. On Friday, RuTube&#x27;s apps were suddenly removed from Apple&#x27;s App Store and Google Play.

The early access game is on our best immersive sims list for a reason, you know, and now it has an autumn release date for the final version, along with a new trailer.

                              <span>Last week, Bethesda released a remastered edition of Doom and Doom II on Steam, with lots of extra episodes and improvements. One of these new features is a built-in browser for mods, and support for many existing mods that previously required a different version of the game. Basically, lots of good fan-made mods are now playable on the Steam version of ye olde Doom. That&#x27;s neat! Ah, but there is some demon excrement on the health pack, so to speak. The mod browser lacks moderation and lets people upload the work of others with their own name pinned as the author. That&#x27;s prompted one level designer to call it &quot;a massive breach of trust and violation of norms the Doom community has done its best to hold to for those 30 years.&quot;

Four joke topics appear at the bottom of the screen. Ridiculous celebrity kids names. Action figures for news anchors. Diet water sales boom. You cautiously slide that last one over to the microphone. Throwbrien emits a string of chirps, like a flame-crested lyre bird with a wounded voicebox trying to mimic human language. “Have you folks heard about this one…”
There is an implied terror in this seemingly friendly opener. What if they have heard this one? What will Throwbrien do then?

The Hi-Fi Rush studio have been acquired - alongside the IP for future games in the rhythm action series - by South Korean company Krafton, who also own PUBG Studios and Striking Distance, among others. “This strategic move will include the rights to Tango Gameworks’ acclaimed IP, Hi-Fi Rush,” Krafton said in a statement today. I particularly enjoy the hand-rubbing, grinning use of the word ‘strategic’ here. Great news though.

This week, it&#x27;s the latter.

Musical talent is not required, but independent and inquisitive prospects, with a strong attention to detail, are preferred.

This week, I’ve been half reading in the garden and half staring in awe at my Kindle’s paperwhite doohickey and it’s ability to stay readable in searing sunbeams.

                              <span>The title of this article contains a question, one that in various forms has been asked millions of times over the years. The reason the same question still gets asked countless times even today, is simple: the answer, should one even exist, is never true for long, even if we assume it was initially true. So what&#x27;s the harm in asking?

I know it&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve made you aware of this project, but it&#x27;s been going on since I moved to Glasgow. So far, Lidl&#x27;s own brand remains the clear winner, a solid 8 on the taste meter at just 59p. But while writing this, I&#x27;m sipping an &quot;Intenso&quot; Arctic Coffee from Morrisons, which is giving the Lidl frontrunners some stiff competition at last, albeit at 145% the cost. Will one true victor emerge? Find out next week! For now, here&#x27;s what we&#x27;re all clicking on this weekend!

                              <span>The Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) has repeatedly taken a tough stance on piracy, condemning freeloaders and calling for tough enforcement measures. In a recent earnings call, UFC parent company TKO noted that ESPN price hikes haven&#x27;t made things easier. On the contrary, the company directly links price increases to the &quot;jacked up&quot; piracy numbers.

The Italian football league filed a legal complaint in April, claiming that Cloudflare assists and protects pirate services. In a decision handed down this week, the Court of Milan said that it has no legal authority to compel Cloudflare to join the program. The Court also denied Serie A&#x27;s application for an injunction, for reasons that suggest this battle may not be over.

                              <span>Sometimes I want to play a video game, and sometimes I just want to assemble a quiet little Dutch town with iron bridges, fountains and dinky trams bustling about like bumble bees. The project in question is Tramstertram. Aside from being a terrifying feat of punmanship, it&#x27;s a browser-based building toy from Matt Stark, creator of the really rather lovely Viewfinder.

The same is apparently true of the multiplayer Control spin-off Project Condor and the Max Payne 1 &amp; 2 remakes, on which Remedy are collaborating with GTA and Max Payne 3 developers Rockstar.

When I pursue Ayo and Dija around the garden, keeping their feet and butts in shot as they belittle each other, it&#x27;s not because I&#x27;m a busybody and a lech. And when I pan to the lighthouse piercing the sunset beyond the security spikes it&#x27;s not out of any feeling of wonder, or even curiosity about possible escape routes. Please understand: I do not see these people, these objects at all, just the boneless, faceless traces they leave upon my own servitude to the lens.

                              <span>The first Splitgate was a cracker mash-up of Halo multiplayer gunfights and Portal&#x27;s nifty spacetime windows. It was a gimmick that made flanking fun again, at least until you died to a distant rifle that was right next to you all along. Its sequel, Splitgate 2 is continuing that gimmick but is also sprucing up the free-to-play arena shooter with a few modern additions, like bum-sliding around corners and big deployable bubbles called &quot;time domes&quot; that slow down your enemies yet speed up your allies. All this and more comes from a gameplay trailer that went up yesterday.

                              <span>The new God Of War duology has my favourite snow in gaming. I can take or leave about 60% of everything else in them, but lawdy, that snow! In God Of War Ragnarok, the action kicks off a during the apocalyptic fimbulwinter, which is probably bad for some characters I don’t care about, but it is good for me personally, because there’s a lot of snow to play with.
How much snow, you ask? 190 flippin’ gigs worth, apparently, according to Sony’s system requirements.

                              <span>Yesterday, Nic took James and I on a tour of Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2&#x27;s co-op campaign. A merry old time was had, romping through fortress cities like a small herd of crusader buffalo, using the game&#x27;s absurd jetpack functionality to pancake invading Tyranids, and getting our screens so slathered in gore we couldn&#x27;t work out who was killing what.
It looks like the gargantuan action game&#x27;s PvP multiplayer will be even messier. Saber and Focus Home have released an extended trailer that walks you through two major modes - the PvE boss and wave-slaying frenzy of Operations, and the 12-player PvP carnage of Eternal War, which spans a range of match types. The ecstasy of dying for the Emperor aside, both give me frightful flashbacks to the early days of Gears Of War.

In a new post, its lead developer has laid out what to expect from Early Access. In the main: a polished, 40 hours-or-so experience with no known major issues, and a post-release roadmap waiting to be defined by player feedback.

                              <span>Did The Gentlebros come up with the pun &quot;Pi-Rats&quot; and then work backwards from there in deciding that Cat Quest 3 should be pirate themed? Or was &quot;Purr-ibean&quot; the initiating pun? I feel that the action-RPG sequel had to begin with one of wordplay or another, given that its Steam page boasts that it also has &quot;furr-ocious spells&quot; and &quot;gla-meow-rous costumes&quot;.

It&#x27;s also claws-out now on Steam, which has me feline fine.

                              <span>You&#x27;re a long time undead. 7 Days To Die was shuffling along in early access for 11 years, until version 1.0 finally burst through the windows. In that time, many other survival games have sprouted, blossomed, and gently faded away. I first visited the burnt-out ruins of this zombie-infested world a decade ago and I returned to it this week to find a tree-puncher that, despite bearing the pockmarks of early access, retains much of what made it enjoyable back when the survival genre was still wearing its baby onesie. Instead of a review, I figured I&#x27;d scribble together a mini starter guide for new (or returning) players. Partly because the game is a proper time sink and it was taking me so long to get through everything. But mostly because I wanted to use that numberful headline. So, here you go: 7 dos and 7 don&#x27;ts in 7 Days To (7) Die.

                              <span>I was partial to a scrappy little strategy game even before idiot billionaires doomed the planet, and the UK to brain-steaming heat just when you thought we&#x27;d escape it this year. Khaligrad is plenty scrappy. Its edges are rough and you have to figure it out yourself, but it&#x27;s more intuitive than it appears, and easy to operate once you discern some basics. It&#x27;s scrappy too in that it&#x27;s, well. It&#x27;s Stalingrad. Not really: its world is so fictional it&#x27;s their 15th century. But the invaders are explicitly fascists and the defenders communists embroiled in a long and brutal semi-guerrilla city war with World War 2 technology. Thankfully, it&#x27;s stripped of any actual fashy or genocidal play-acting beyond each side doing &quot;hail the empire/union&quot; bits as a sign off.
I think that&#x27;s why, despite its brutal and difficult setting, it&#x27;s this year&#x27;s entry in the long tradition of Low-Intensity Strategy Games For When Hot Why Hot Please Stop You Cannot See My Begging Tears For They Evaporate.

                              <span>WolfEye&#x27;s debut game Weird West attempted to pack a little of Dishonored&#x27;s immersive sim sorcery into a top-down action-RPG. For the studio&#x27;s next game, co-founders Raphaël Colantonio and Julien Roby are leaning into comparisons with their old endeavours at Arkane more earnestly. The new game - currently untitled and without a release date - is a first-person sci-fi RPG set in an alternate-1900s North America, which ostensibly combines the ingenuity and gadgetry of Dishonored and Prey with a &quot;real RPG&quot; experience redolent of Skyrim and modern-day Fallout.

Reduced score means I can squeeze in another card for more healing. If I can pull my Tarot card, I&#x27;ll deal damage with each heal, and I’ve already pulled two scratch cards for yet more quick damage. Now, if I can just pull a Jack, I can plonk down the King Of Space And Time for a brutal finisher. That’ll transfer everything on my side over to my opponent’s, forcing a bust for a nice final chunk of hurt and…

                              <span>Spaceship likers, come hither. Long-running space sim Elite Dangerous has just unloaded a new interstellar vessel into its universe, and she&#x27;s a beaut. The new Type-8 Transporter is a medium freighter capable of hauling a maximum of 406 tons of cargo. It&#x27;s got a default jump range of 17.55 light years and two big prongs sticking out of its face like a sci-fi forklift. Cool. The catch is that this ship can only be bought with real money for now, say the developers. This is part of Frontier&#x27;s new strategy of having paid-for ships in the game. I don&#x27;t really play Elite Dangerous anymore, so I don&#x27;t have strong feelings about that. But I do have strong feelings about the space trucker advertisement the developer has put together for the new ship. Come watch it with me.

                              <span>I’d initially assumed that puzzle game Sliding Hero counts was a Sokoban-like, until I realised that it’s actually you, not endless boxes, that do the sliding here. Still, I wasn’t entirely convinced. The only thing that’s fun to slide back-and-forth indefinitely is a lounging cat on a smooth kitchen worktop. Still, after messing around with Sliding Hero’s Steam demo, I think this one might have much longer legs than its restrictive-sounding concept suggests. All the better to endlessly slide with.

Do I let it spin on forever, a gleaming machine of prosperity bathed in an eternal twilight, or do I, as the case may be, unleash a horde of voluptuous hellwomen to gather spirit energy for the resurrection of my tragically slain beloved? If you picked option B you should probably play My Lovely Empress, a plush empire management sim with a dastardly twist, from Indonesian team GameChanger Studio. Find a trailer below.

                              <span>It is I, the wound salter. The injury insult adder. Life By You, the simulation life-em-up from Paradox, was canceled in June after being delayed indefinitely. The day after the cancellation - which Paradox CEO Fredrik Wester implied was down to a “lacking”, unfixable development state - designer Willem Delventhal spoke about his time at the subsequently shuttered Paradox Tectonic. He claimed the team spent a month “in purgatory” prior to being told of the game’s cancelation and studio shuttering two weeks before launch, despite being told by higher-ups that work was “exceeding expectations.”
We’ve now got another look at a game we’ll likely never get, thanks to a thread by Twxbbly user SimMattically collating unseen screenshots from portfolios by several artists who worked on Life By You.

                              <span>The IIPA, which represents the MPA, RIAA, and other entertainment industry groups, believes that Canada could and should do more to tackle online piracy. The association argues that anti-piracy efforts, in the broadest sense, should be prioritized. In addition, copyright exceptions that, by IIPA&#x27;s standards, grant the public too much freedom, should be scrapped.

By stacking blocks, twisting knobs and clicking chunky buttons, you create your own track - then record it to a cassette tape you can keep.

It now has a release date: August 15th.

                              <span>There seems to be a wave of retro racers around recently, and each one seems to pick a particular target to shoot with its nostalgia gun, whether Wipeout or Lotus or Micro Machines or whatever else. 

Maybe I&#x27;m forgetting some classic arcade racer, but Victory Heat Rally feels less laser targeted and more a modern take on the spirit of the genre. It&#x27;s a 2.5D, &quot;neo super scaler&quot; arcade racer with split screen, drifting, car tuning and a lot of pep.

                              <span>UK arts and entertainment union Equity have unveiled a raft of &quot;best practice guidelines&quot; for video game developers hiring voice actors, including some suggested minimum rates that are designed to address &quot;systemic low pay&quot; for performers. Other measures are designed to improve voice actor working conditions, and stop companies using their voices and likeness as fuel for generative AI tools without their consent. It&#x27;s both a praiseworthy endeavour and an interesting breakdown of the voice-actor&#x27;s trade.

                              <span>What if the company that sold your cheese also sold your PC gaming hardware? This is not the murmuring of some poor sod on a nineteen-hour Dota 2 binge who’s started thinking that the crumbs in his keyboard resemble a viable snack, but a bold new reality, one I recently found myself staring down during a trip to Asda. The supermarket chain – third biggest in the UK by turnover and purveyors of ill-fitting clothes and surprisingly good doughnuts alike – has added light-up gaming mice, keyboards, and headsets to its mountain of own-brand wares.
Asda being what it is (Americans, if you’re unfamiliar, think Walmart with less gun violence), it’s all dirt cheap as well. £17 for a full-size keyboard. £16 for an FPS mouse. Overwhelmed with curiosity, I ended up taking home a complete starter set (keeb, different mouse, headset, and mousemat) for £45, or about a third of the price of the Logitech G515 Lightspeed TKL that I’d shortly kick off my desk. Could this be a new frontier in affordable PC hardware, bringing tech to the masses in a way no specialist retailer ever could, or should supermarkets stick to cereal and meal deals? Surely the Asda Tech (real name) 4-in-1 Gaming Kit would have the answers.

                              <span>Hmmm... it could be nothing, but the technomancers at Nvidia have just updated their graphics drivers, and among the list of game profiles now listed in their control panel tool is Final Fantasy XVI. The blockbuster JRPG isn&#x27;t out on PC yet, and developers Square Enix have not given a concrete release date for it, but this does seem to be prep work for the inevitable. And with Squeenix in attendance at Gamescom, it&#x27;s possible we&#x27;ll know more soon.

                              <span>Back in June, strategy bods Creative Assembly put out a chunky, chatty video discussing the next expansion for Total War: Warhammer 3. Aside from a not-so-subtle hint that the orcs, ogres, and Khorne pack would feature at least one colossal squig, it also ended with a tease at smaller bits of new content coming alongside regular patches. As of the game’s latest hotfix blog, we’ve now got a better idea when we’ll start seeing some of these “smaller bits and pieces.” Bits and pieces? In this economy?

                              <span>In the grim darkness of the far future, there is only War, unless you don&#x27;t have a 64-bit PC with an Intel Core i5-8600K equivalent and at least eight gigs of RAM, in which case you&#x27;ll have to, I don&#x27;t know, live in everlasting peace, or something. I&#x27;m pretty sure not having eight gigs of RAM is heretical, but never fear, you can probably compensate by taking a leaf from the God-Emperor&#x27;s book and arrange for a host of dying psykers to pour their brain energy into your motherboard.
All of which is to say that Focus Home have released the system requirements for huge-shouldered action game Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2. Find them proudly emblazoned across the header image above, and written out for easier copy-pasting in the blockquote, below.

                              <span>As the wait lengthens for Hollow Knight: Silksong, other Soulsy creature features are scurrying to fill the breach. We had Deviator last week - now, it&#x27;s time for a bumper helping of the heebie-jeebies in the shape of Perennial Order. The title makes it sound like an eBay delivery of potted geraniums. The game festering beneath is actually a &quot;plant horror&quot; boss rusher with twin stick melee controls, unlockable &quot;Instinct&quot; abilities and one-hit deaths.
In a gift to headline writers everywhere, the developers, four-person Gardenfiend Games, are calling it &quot;Hollow Knight meets Titan Souls&quot;, and who am I to deny them? It&#x27;s got one of those &quot;painterly&quot; art styles, too, though other words come to mind, such as &quot;rotted&quot; and &quot;unhallowed&quot; and &quot;manky&quot;. It&#x27;s out on 6th September. Find a trailer nested below this paragraph like a venus flytrap poised to clamp around your fingers.

                              <span>Okay, listen. The Roads To Power expansion coming to Crusader Kings III is focusing on the Byzantine Empire. But forget that. Because today developers Paradox revealed the ins and outs of another feature from the DLC that is way more exciting than some fusty old Greeks. It&#x27;s called &quot;landless adventurers&quot; and it&#x27;ll let you play as disgraced dirtbag travelling the world in a sort of medieval gig economy. You&#x27;ll be making camp, gathering followers, taking random jobs from local rulers, and catching infectious diseases as you try to travel safely through war-torn regions. It sounds amazing.

                              <span>I don&#x27;t play much Call Of Duty any more. My feelings about the series have settled back from self-righteous fury over its Pentagon-sponsored war-fellating to a quieter, regretful sense that there have maybe been enough Call Of Duty games now, and that it would be nice if we could fill that infamous late October/early November release slot with, I don&#x27;t know, games about witches instead, or maybe just turn it into a public holiday and spend the week lying on a mattress regarding the ceiling. Still: I&#x27;ve skinned and filleted enough COD in my time to know that Black Ops 6&#x27;s new &quot;omnimovement&quot; system is going to ruffle as many feathers as it smooths. The short version is that it turns you into Max Payne.

                              <span>In his Vampire Survivors review, Matt Cox described the game as something he could play with &quot;one hand in a packet of crisps&quot;. I think about this quite often, actually, as someone whose largely offline friends (or Fortnite/FIFA pals) ask me to recommend them a game that&#x27;s good or interesting. Show them something popular like Elden Ring and, despite its grandeur, it might prove too much in all facets. But Vampire Survivors? It&#x27;s an easy sell: simple, digestible, ridiculous value.
All of this is to say, One BTN Bosses is from the same school of the easy sell. You can fight bosses with one hand in a packet of pickled onion Space Raiders, after all.

You get your bearings, and you soon meet up with another, only slightly irritating, small child. His name is Kimothy, which sounds like something you’d only say as a joke to annoy friends named Kim, and then only once because it would be stupid to say it again. It’s fine! Leaves flutter, rays of sun cavort through trees, and the music is utterly gorgeous. The game opens on twinkly piano and mournful strings, infused with a good dose of stirring JRPG whimsy, and soon transforms into whatever the genre of music is called that makes you want to immediately go on a massive adventure. Potion-punk. Slime-swing. Limit breakcore etc.

                              <span>Is early adoption a chump’s game? I dunno about that, though between the Asus ROG Ally X and the Steam Deck OLED, those who stayed their hand on their earlier handheld gaming PC counterparts do have a couple of quality second-genners to choose from. Valve’s effort manages to wring multiple performance, design, and battery life improvements out of its new display, while the ROG Ally X makes similar upgrades with a bigger-yet-better take on the original ROG Ally.
The only thing to do, clearly, is make them fight. It’s probably in the Irish Code Duello or something: &quot;Should one portable games box impugn another’s honour by releasing shortly after it, satisfaction must be claimed through a comparison article.&quot; My hands are bound here, folks, though if you yourself have been playing the waiting game on a handheld purchase, perhaps this little head-to-head can help you pick the right one.

                              <span>Cinematic platformer Bionic Bay opens on a scene of a very large egg doing very bad things - easily my third favourite genre of speculative fiction. You awake to a world of tree trunks that twist like viscera and corroded contraptions powered by luminous goop that’s stored in the balls, uh, big glass orbs. A beam of light soon fills your character with newfound vigour, which is a nice moment of triumph in what otherwise feels like a deeply oppressive rust pit, all unsteady platforms and jagged pipes.
It doesn’t take long before you start spotting examples of the reason Bionic Bay went viral earlier this week. Above your head hangs a painstakingly detailed mass of vents and cables, looming lifelike with dust and shadow and history. I stood and stared because I’d seen how the sausage was made, but I like to think I would have lingered longer than usual anyway. It really is just that impressive.

                              <span>This week sees the release of a new Steam edition of Type-Moon and Kinoko Nasu&#x27;s dark fantasy visual novel and dating sim Fate Stay/Night. I randomly watched one of Stay/Night&#x27;s many anime spin-offs, Fate Zero, during the pandemic lockdowns. It triggered a short-lived obsession with the Fate series - I even dipped a toe in the long-lived mobile gacha game Fate/Grand Order. As such, I think I&#x27;m the nearest thing RPS has to a Fate &quot;expert&quot;. Join me for a brief and sporadically informed tour of a universe that has Shaped The Culture like few others.

                              <span>Star Wars Outlaws is out relatively soon and looks relatively exciting, if you&#x27;re into Ubisoft open worlds and pseudo-Uncharted mechanics with pewpews and dribbly aliens. And if you&#x27;re excited, prepare to get more excited-er - or more exhausted-er - as Ubi have just unveiled Outlaws&#x27; DLC plans for season pass holders. Those DLCs will let you meet &quot;notorious gambler&quot; Lando Calrissian and &quot;veteran pirate&quot; Hondo Ohnaka, who I am definitely familiar with.

                              <span>What is it with monstrous eating mechanics in games of late? Last week it was carnivorous post-Soviet elevators, now it’s retro fantasy RPGs that devour themselves. In Super Dungeon Muncher, you are a teeny-tiny hero navigating a corridor-shaped map full of fireball traps and crumbling platforms, spinning coins and patrolling critters. That’s the “Super Dungeon” part. The “Muncher” part refers to the corpulent red monster guzzling the whole level in your wake.
