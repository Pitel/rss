                              <span>Holy shit. It was just two months ago that I was asking Sega, very nicely, to maybe think about bringing the Yakuza series’ historical spin-off games to the West. Now, today, Sega only went and announced that one of them is indeed on the way, and has been remade for modern hardware to boot.

                              <span>Today Sony held another PlayStation State of Play event. This one was about 20 minutes long and featured a few small announcements, a couple of new trailers for some already-announced games, and a bizarre ad for Sony’s terrible digital-collector program, PlayStation Stars.

                              <span>Today brought a doubleheader of platform-holder livestreams. Our day kicked off with a Nintendo Direct, which brought us more than 40 minutes of headlines, gameplay trailers, announcements, and even name reveals. We finished off the day with a PlayStation State of Play, giving us trailers and information for the PlayStation family of consoles, including PlayStation VR2.
Now that the dust has settled a little bit, we want to know what caught your eye. Was it something from Nintendo&#x27;s digital event? Perhaps the name and release date reveal of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom? Was the impressive list of Nintendo 64 games coming to Switch Online&#x27;s Expansion Pack? Maybe you&#x27;re super hyped for Fire Emblem Engage?
Or was it something from the PlayStation State of Play event? Tekken 8 was an expected but exciting reveal, while games like Rise of the Ronin and Like a Dragon: Ishin look like an absolute blast. Of course, we can&#x27;t talk about the State of Play stream without mentioning that God of War: Ragnarök footage.
Let us know in the comments below what you&#x27;re most hyped about coming out of today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct and PlayStation State of Play. If you happened to miss any of the announcements, you can check out our news hub for all our coverage from today.</span>

                              <span>Sony revealed a brand new story trailer for God Of War Ragnarök during today’s State Of Play stream. The video showcased otherworldly imagery, including astral jellyfish, giant dinosaur-like creatures, and notably, a pivotal scene wherein Atreus appears to usher in Fimbulwinter, the end of the world, alongside Sköll and Hati – two wolves that are the offspring of Fenrir. According to Norse mythology, Sköll and Hati are two wolves who exist to one day spark the beginning of Ragnarök by chasing and devouring the sun and the moon. It’s pretty clear that’s what is happening in this new trailer, but why is Atreus helping them?
Additionally, it seems Atreus is hiding critical information from his father, Kratos, so why is Kratos following orders from his teenage son? Why is Freya holding a sword up to Atreus’ throat in the trailer? Is she holding Atreus hostage or trying to show Kratos the same pain she suffered after her son Baldur was killed in the first game? The trailer creates more questions than answers, precisely what I want from pre-launch marketing. 


We’ll have to wait to find the answers to these questions when God Of War Ragnarök releases on November 8. In the meantime, let me know your story theories in the comments below!</span>

                              <span>Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio, the team behind the beloved Yakuza franchise, has announced Like a Dragon: Ishin. This spin-off entry was first released on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 3 in 2014 but never came to the West. Now titled Like A Dragon: Ishin, the game has been rebuilt from the ground up, and it&#x27;s coming to Western markets next year.


The game takes place in the Late Edo Period, in the 1860s. After finishing his sword training, Sakamoto Ryoma returns home to Tosa, only to get into a fight with a prestigious and highly ranked samurai. Now, players can change the course of Japan&#x27;s history in this Yakuza spin-off game.
Like a Dragon: Ishin is set to launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC in February 2023.</span>

                              <span>PlayStation and Team Ninja have announced Rise of the Ronin, a new action game coming exclusively to PlayStation 5 sometime in 2024. 
It was revealed during today&#x27;s PlayStation State of Play, and if you&#x27;re at all familiar with Team Ninja&#x27;s other games, you&#x27;re probably going to be into this one. It&#x27;s not quite clear if it&#x27;s taking up the Soulslike mantle that other Team Ninja games have (looking at you, Nioh), but there were a few gameplay sequences that showed some combat similar to From Software&#x27;s hit series. 
Check it out for yourself in the reveal trailer below: 


As you can see, Rise of the Ronin looks quite interesting. The combat looks fast, brutal, and explosive, and the characters look fun. The world looks especially unique, too, with some of the game seemingly taking place in more rural areas of Japan and others taking place in more dense villages and towns.

Unfortunately, it might be a while before we learn more because Rise of the Ronin won&#x27;t hit PlayStation 5 until 2024.

                              <span>Another action RPG (like that&#x27;s a bad thing)
Depending on how you slice it, the highlight of today&#x27;s State of Play was either Like a Dragon: Ishin from Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio or Rise of the Ronin from Team Ninja. (Why not both?) The developer shared its first look at this PS5 open-world action RPG, which is seven years in the making. It&#x27;s another historical-inspired tale with over-the-top flair, as you&#x27;ll quickly see in the trailer — a mix of &quot;gameplay and in-game cinematics.&quot;
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;0gwsQvDGh4o
&quot;Set in the late 19th century, Japan is facing the darkest of times as it struggles with its oppressive rulers and deadly diseases while western influence permeates as civil war continues to rage between the Tokugawa Shogunate and the Anti-Shogunate factions,&quot; noted director Fumihiko Yasuda. &quot;Here in this time of mayhem, you embody a Ronin character, a warrior bound to no master and free to make choices of its own.&quot;
Going a step further, Yasuda calls Rise of the Ronin the &quot;most ambitious and challenging project for Team Ninja Studio to date,&quot; promising a &quot;multilayered story&quot; and &quot;unrestricted open gameplay.&quot; The action-game fundamentals can always get this team&#x27;s foot in the door for me — so while I&#x27;m already &quot;in,&quot; so to speak, I am curious to hear concrete info.
For now, there&#x27;s that cool glider and rifle-stabbing animation. I love a good finisher. From everything we can glean, this looks like another skillful action romp. Keep &#x27;em coming.

Rise of the Ronin will launch in 2024 and it&#x27;s said to be a &quot;PlayStation 5 console exclusive,&quot; which opens the door for a (well-advised) PC version.
Considering Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty (the Three Kingdoms-inspired Nioh successor) is coming up first in 2023, that far-off timing makes sense. We&#x27;re feasting as action fiends.

                              <span>Really hope we don&#x27;t have to kill that jellyfish
A new story trailer for God of War Ragnarok debuted today. And it sees Kratos and Atreus hurtling towards some big confrontations as fate winds around them.
This is probably the biggest look we&#x27;ve had at the new God of War yet, and it&#x27;s packed with a ton of details. The trailer premiered during today&#x27;s Sony State of Play, and really drives home what Kratos and Atreus are up against.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;hfJ4Km46A-0
In the three-minute trailer, we see Kratos dueling with what looks like valkyries in the cosmos. They head underwater to make some nautical acquaintances, come face-to-face with old &quot;friends&quot; like Freya, and dang, there&#x27;s even a giant jellyfish.
Tons of set pieces and new attacks get shown off, including some combo moves for Kratos and Atreus. And at the very end, Atreus rips apart the sky with the help of a wolf pal. Norse mythology enjoyers probably have a ton of details to pick apart.

And it closes off with a match-up between Kratos and Thor, the big battle that felt like it was teased in the final moments of 2018&#x27;s God of War.
Godhood ain&#x27;t easy
God of War Ragnarok is locked in for a November 9 release. It&#x27;s a date we&#x27;re inching closer and closer to, as we&#x27;re already into September. And today, we also got news that God of War is getting a special Sony DualSense controller.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;uvZZvTRFbTs
It&#x27;s two-toned blue and white, and it&#x27;s got the bear and wolf insignias on the touchpad. A really nice touch!
While I would normally say I don&#x27;t need to see more of God of War Ragnarok at this point, today&#x27;s story trailer definitely has me itching to play the new game. I&#x27;m ready to smash up some bad guys and throw the Leviathan Axe around again.
God of War Ragnarok goes live on PS4 and PS5 on November 9.

We aren&#x27;t yet at a point where Sony is slinging game-themed PS5 consoles like in the PS4 days, but at least God of War fans are getting a special controller variant. Announced during this afternoon&#x27;s State of Play, Sony will release a God of War Ragnarok DualSense controller for PS5 on November 9, 2022 — the same day Ragnarok is out on PS4/PS5.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;uvZZvTRFbTs
The white and blue DualSense controller has a bear and wolf insignia to represent Kratos and Atreus, according to Sony. It&#x27;s a nice contrast to the lighter Starlight Blue model.
Funny enough, for a split second, I thought this was going to be the State of Play&#x27;s closer, which goes to show how low my expectations tend to be for these showings. Instead, the controller tidbit just led into our fullest-yet look at God of War Ragnarok&#x27;s story with a new trailer, and yep, it looks awesome. The weight of the story is finally sinking in.
I&#x27;ve got too many of these gamepads as is (three, somehow!), but I&#x27;m sure this will sell out fast. Pre-orders for the God of War Ragnarok DualSense begin on September 27.
A price hasn&#x27;t been listed yet, but I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised to see a bit of a premium over the $70-$75 tag for the current DualSense colorways.

                              <span>The other bodysuited hack &#x27;n&#x27; slash gal
During today&#x27;s State of Play presentation, developer Shift Up released a new gameplay trailer for its previously teased hack &#x27;n&#x27; slash adventure Project EVE, which has now been officially titled Stellar Blade. It will launch as a PS5 exclusive at some point in 2023.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;ayek3ZzWb1E
Previously shown off during a State of Play presentation one year ago, Stellar Blade follows a powerful mercenary, Eve, as she spearheads a mission to bring humanity back to Earth, following a violent expulsion at the claws of a monstrous force known as &quot;NA:tives.&quot; It is up to Eve and her military friends to take back Earth from its occupiers.
Equipped with amazing acrobatic ability and cybernetic weaponry, Eve will slice &#x27;n&#x27; dice her way through an army of enemies, while upgrading her weapons, skills, combat maneuvers, and high fashion with the expenditure of gathered XP, which in the Stellar Blade universe is known as &quot;Beta Gauge.&quot; It looks suitably flashy and action-packed, with an opulent and special-effect-packed presentation style. One worth keeping an eye on for the Devil May Cry and Bayonetta crowd methinks.
Stellar Blade will launch exclusively on PS5 in 2023. Next year is filling up fast.

Breath of the Wild 2 finally has a real name with The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. To many gamers&#x27; surprise, Pikmin 4 was revealed. Fire Emblem Engage is coming on January 20 and it has a lengthy trailer with tons to speculate on. Then, we saw It Takes Two for Switch, Octopath Traveler II, new N64 games for Nintendo Switch Online, and tons more.

                              <span>Ishin finally comes to the west on PS4 and PS5
A long-awaited Yakuza title is making its way to new fans. Like a Dragon: Ishin is a historical action-adventure, launching globally in February 2023.
Ishin is a historical thriller set in 1860s Kyo, a fictional version of Kyoto. Hero Sakamoto Ryoma is a true historical figure, and the story follows the overthrow of the shogunate and how the samurai era vanished.
If the faces look familiar, it&#x27;s for good reason. Kazuma Kiryu is essentially &quot;cast&quot; as Sakamoto Ryoma, and others will appear as well. Yes, that includes Goro Majima.

While Yakuza Ishin launched in Japan in 2014, western players haven&#x27;t had a localized version to play just yet. And more than a localization, Like a Dragon: Ishin is being built on Unreal Engine 4. I have to say, it&#x27;s looking pretty darn good on it, too.
Of course, the game will still have heat actions for some big finishers. Sakamoto can also wield a blade in Swordsman style, a gun in the Gunman style, or both in the Wild Dancer style. Or maybe just go back to good old fists, in the Brawler stance.
Like a dragon
There&#x27;s more to come for Like a Dragon: Ishin, and we might not have to wait long. Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio is set to host a summit live stream early tomorrow morning. Hopefully we&#x27;ll get some more details and info on RGG&#x27;s plans there.
Today&#x27;s State of Play confirms that Like a Dragon: Ishin is coming to PlayStation 4 and PS5. The Sega upload of the trailer also confirms Ishin is coming to Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC via Windows and Steam.

                              <span>Can you survive the road to hell?
We&#x27;ve seen lots of driving games over the years, but for the most part, their gameplay focuses on racing, demolition derbies, or navigating a large open world map. Pacific Drive is a new run-based, first-person driving survival game, the debut title from Seattle-based Ironwood Studios. The developers behind this new project have worked on classics like Ratchet &amp; Clank, Mortal Kombat, Call of Duty, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, and many more. Pacific Drive was revealed today during the PlayStation State of Play, and featured a heart-pounding drive through dark, desolate woods. It seems there is a mystery afoot, and the only way to figure it out is to drive towards it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;dN1I_znpzrk
&quot;Your car is your only companion as you navigate a surreal and anomaly-filled reimagining of the Pacific Northwest,&quot; says the description on the game&#x27;s official website. &quot;Structured as a &#x27;road-like,&#x27; each excursion into the wilderness brings unique and strange challenges, as you restore and upgrade your car from an abandoned garage that acts as your home base. With the car as your lifeline, you’ll unravel a long-forgotten mystery as you make your way to the heart of the Olympic Exclusion Zone.&quot;

While much of Pacific Drive remains a mystery, I have to admit that this is one of the most unique premises I&#x27;ve seen at these game showcases as of late. Government secrets, spooky monsters, and some kind of supernatural weather phenomenon? Looks like a recipe for a classic, edge-of-your-seat adventure. I&#x27;m usually pretty bad at driving mechanics in games, so I think I&#x27;ll probably need to brush up a bit before Pacific Drive finally releases.
Pacific Drive will be coming to PlayStation 5 and PC sometime in 2023. Until then, I&#x27;ll be on the lookout for any more updates, because this is certainly one I&#x27;ll be looking forward to.

Talk about kicking things off with a bang — PlayStation began its State of Play live stream with the official reveal of Bandai Namco&#x27;s next entry to its legendary 3D fight franchise, Tekken. Tekken 8 is currently in development &quot;exclusively&quot; for PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X/S.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;zI6I63PnW0Q
The very attractive trailer saw long-time rivals and troubled father-son duo Jin Kazama and Kazuya Mishima battle it out amidst a raging storm. In what appeared to be a blend of cinematic visuals and real-time gameplay, the footage sure looked like Tekken, albeit with an absolutely stunning new look.
&quot;We are very excited to show the next generation of Tekken,&quot; said Katsuhiro Harada, chief producer at Bandai Namco Studios, in a press statement. &quot;The team at Bandai Namco Studios has been hard at work to bring groundbreaking new features to Tekken 8, pushing the feeling of power in battles continuously further by harnessing the power of the latest generation of consoles. We can’t wait to show you more in the months to come!&quot;
Tekken 8 is currently in development for PlayStation 5, PC, and Xbox Series X/S using Unreal Engine 5. Check out more info over at PlayStation Blog.

                              <span>Bandai Namco has revealed Tekken 8, a new sequel in the popular and long-running fighting game franchise. 
Tekken 8 was revealed in a new cinematic trailer that aired during today&#x27;s PlayStation State of Play. It began with a few shots to set up the scenery before cutting to two series mainstays, Kazuya and Kazuya&#x27;s son, Jin. The two duke it out in what appears to be a fair fight, that is until Kazuya calls forth the power of the devil gene inside him to finish the fight. 
Check it out for yourself in the reveal trailer below:


Unfortunately, this trailer doesn&#x27;t reveal much else. Tekken 8 looks very much like Tekken, which is great. The trailer also doesn&#x27;t reveal a release date – it just says to stay tuned for more information.

                              <span>As one of the most influential and beloved shooters of all time, GoldenEye 007 is a special game for many who played it in the late &#x27;90s. However, it&#x27;s been a long time since the game has been playable on modern consoles. That changes soon, as the revolutionary first-person shooter received a duo of announcements today. First, we learned about a Switch version as part of the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack N64 catalog. However, we also learned the title (which was developed by now-Microsoft-owned Rare), is also coming to Xbox as a part of Game Pass and Rare Replay.
When the game arrives on Xbox, it will include the classic campaign, complete with the original difficulty settings and cheat codes (no word on if &quot;DK Mode&quot; will be renamed to something more generic like &quot;Big Head Mode&quot; for the Xbox version). The Xbox version will also include the split-screen local competitive multiplayer mode that made the game such a mainstay for get-togethers in the N64 era.


Unfortunately, it does not appear as though the online multiplayer available in the Nintendo Switch Online version will make the jump to the Xbox version. However, the Xbox version of GoldenEye 007 does include improved control options (including dual analog stick support), native 16:9 resolution up to 4K Ultra HD, a consistent refresh rate, and full achievement support. 
GoldenEye 007 is coming to Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One as part of Game Pass. Everyone who already owns Rare Replay will also be able to download the game at no additional cost. We don&#x27;t know exactly when GoldenEye 007 arrives on Xbox, but according to Rare, the game will land simultaneously on Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch Online.</span>

                              <span>I never thought I would write these words: I&#x27;m leaving Game Informer.
For nearly 30 years, I looked forward to each workday, eager to see what game news would break, what I would be writing about, and on the best days, what I would be playing. In the time it took to create 330 monthly magazines, I was privileged to work alongside some of the most talented and amazing people I&#x27;ve ever met. For a kid who couldn’t get enough of video games growing up, I was living a dream. I knew how lucky I was and never took it for granted. I worked hard. I wanted Game Informer to be the place to go to celebrate games. I think we accomplished that tenfold and have created an outlet unlike any other.
In the weeks ahead, I’ll transition from writing game news to creating it. I’m entering the world of game dev…</span>

                              <span>We&#x27;re rapidly approaching the midway point for Mario Kart 8 Deluxe&#x27;s Booster Course Pass content. With two of the six promised waves of new courses already out, Nintendo has begun teasing what players can expect with the third wave, which is due out this holiday season. During today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct, we learned the first two courses coming in the third eight-course wave of new tracks.
Fittingly, the first course we learned about for Wave 3 of the Booster Course Pass is Merry Mountain. This holiday-themed track first made its debut in Mario Kart Tour in 2020 as part of the Winter Tour. Meanwhile, for those looking for something not holiday-themed, Nintendo is also bringing Peach Gardens, a track that first appeared in Mario Kart DS in 2005.
Wave 1 brought fan favorites like Coconut Mall (Wii), Choco Mountain (N64), and Sky Garden (GBA), while Wave 2 gave us access to tracks like Kalimari Desert (N64), Mario Circuit 3 (SNES), and Mushroom Gorge (Wii). Each wave has also given us two tracks from Mario Kart Tour, with Wave 2 also including an all-new course in Sky-High Sundae. 
Mario Kart 8 Deluxe – Booster Course Pass Wave 3 is scheduled to arrive this holiday season.</span>

                              <span>In the lead-up to Nintendo Switch Sports, Nintendo promised two major free updates following the launch. The first free update, which came out earlier this summer, added the ability to use the leg strap accessory for entire soccer matches instead of just shootouts. The second, more anticipated free update is set to add a new playable sport to the package: golf. Originally set for release this fall, Nintendo today announced a small delay to the update, saying it now arrives this holiday season.
The Nintendo Switch Sports version of golf lets you tee up across 21 holes carried over from the Wii Sports series. You can play locally with other players or hit the links with up to eight players online in the new Survival Golf mode. In Survival Golf, whoever takes the most strokes each round is eliminated.
This free update to Nintendo Switch Sports arrives this holiday season. For more about Nintendo Switch Sports, you can check out our full review here.</span>

In The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, players can explore the surface of the version of Hyrule they traveled across in Breath of the Wild as well as various floating islands in the sky. In the new trailer, we see Link go from the sky to the surface, then from the surface to the sky.
There&#x27;s still so much we don&#x27;t know about Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, but in addition to the official name, we also now have a release date. The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingom arrives exclusively on Nintendo Switch on May 12, 2023.</span>

                              <span>Dauntless developer Phoneix Labs has announced a new title that, needless to say, is dramatically different than its monster-slaying RPG. Fae Farm is a cozy life simulation that whisks players to a world of magic and wonder where you&#x27;ll flex your green thumb as a farming savior. 


As the name suggests, the bulk of the experience involves running a farm as an adventurer and newcomer to a community in the land of Azoria. Though you’ll work to bring peace to this troubled land, you’ll also kick back and leisurely explore various environments, collect resources, and build homesteads. Fae Farm is built with cooperation in mind. The title features drop-in/drop-out co-op, both locally and online, allowing players to farm and quest together. 
“With Fae Farm we wanted to take our favorite elements of the sim genres we love, infuse them with magic and beautiful art, and wrap everything in a light-hearted cooperative experience,” said creative director Katie De Sousa in a press release. “I can’t wait to see what kind of cozy homesteads players build in Azoria.”
Fae Farm is slated to release during Q2 2023 exclusively for Switch.</span>

                              <span>Today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct was loaded with surprises, including an enhanced port of the 2011 Wii game, Kirby&#x27;s Return to Dream Land. On this colorful adventure, Kirby uses a variety of copy abilities to solve puzzles and platforming challenges. These abilities, like a sword and whip, can also be used for combat encounters. This updated version of the game also includes a new Mecha ability, which adds long-range rockets, a close-range dash, and a mighty blast to the arsenal.
Up to four people can play cooperatively using Joy-Cons on the same system. Multiplayer is also available in the expanded minigame collection, giving players a new challenge called Magolor&#x27;s Tome Trackers.
Kirby&#x27;s Return to Dream Land Deluxe launches exclusively on Switch on February 24, 2023. Preorders begin today.</span>

                              <span>Capcom is bringing its best horror games to Nintendo Switch later this year via the handheld&#x27;s cloud gaming capabilities. Resident Evil Village, Resident Evil 7: Biohazard and the recent remakes of Resident Evil 2 and 3 will all be available on the eShop before the end of 2022. While we don&#x27;t know every game&#x27;s exact release date, Capcom announced that Resident Evil Village Cloud is launching on October 28. Additionally, a free demo of Village will be available later today on the Switch eShop if you&#x27;d like to test the quality of the cloud version yourself. 
This release coincides with the global launch of the Resident Evil Village Winter&#x27;s Expansion, which introduces new story content surrounding the protagonist&#x27;s daughter, which is also arriving on October 28. However, the expansion won&#x27;t be available to play on the Nintendo Switch cloud until December 2.</span>

                              <span>I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m writing this: Pikmin 4 is real, and it&#x27;s out next year. 
Let&#x27;s get right to it – check out the official Pikmin 4 announcement trailer below: 


Here&#x27;s what Nintendo had to say about Pikmin 4 in a press release following today&#x27;s reveal: 
 
Pikmin franchise revealed a tranquil park and a napping Bulborb, but it was still missing one important element … Pikmin! Where could they be? More details about this new title for Nintendo Switch will be revealed ahead of its 2023 launch.&quot;

 
Pikmin is a very special franchise to many people, but despite its niche popularity, it&#x27;s never quite reached the heights of other Nintendo franchises. In total, the franchise has sold more than 8 million copies. Pikmin 3 Deluxe on Switch proved the franchise still had some (fruit) juice in it by selling roughly 2 million units in less than a year – a quarter of the series&#x27; entire sales – and fans speculated this had proved to Nintendo that it was time for a proper sequel. 
Pikmin 4 was mentioned by series creator Shigeru Miyamoto back in 2015 when he told Eurogamer that it was in development and &quot;very close to completion.&quot; Time passed and then Hey! Pikmin, a 2D Pikmin spinoff, was announced and then released in July of 2017. Some speculated that this was the Pikmin 4 Miyamoto was referring to back in 2015 but in June of that year, Miyamoto told Eurogamer that &quot;it is progressing,&quot; seemingly confirming that he did not view Hey! Pikmin as the fourth sequel. Unfortunately, that was the last Nintendo or anyone there referred to Pikmin 4...until today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct!

Nintendo showcased a short and sweet teaser trailer that gave us more of the luscious world of Pikmin before flashing to a title screen that revealed Pikmin 4 is coming to Switch next year. As for exactly when, that remains unknown  – Nintendo simply stated 2023. But hey, that&#x27;s better than wondering when, if ever, Pikmin 4 would actually come out!

                              <span>Square Enix has announced Theatrhythm Final Bar Line, the next entry in the Final Fantasy rhythm series. This first console entry in the series includes modernized visuals for the backgrounds and nearly 400 songs included in the base game.
The soundtrack includes favorites like &quot;One Winged Angel,&quot; &quot;Torn from the Heavens,&quot; &quot;Suteki Da Ne,&quot; and plenty more. With 385 songs included in the base game, Square Enix understands it might be difficult to sort through them all, so it included a way to sort by game. The game can be enjoyed by two players locally or four players online.


Theatrhythm Final Bar Line comes to PlayStation 4 and Switch on February 16. Square Enix also announced that players can look forward to paid DLC from the Saga, Nier, Octopath Traveler, and Live A Live series for a total of 90 additional songs. There&#x27;s also a Season Pass which will add 27 extra songs.</span>

More specifically, the first post-launch Splatfest will begin at 5 p.m. PT/8 p.m. ET, on Sept. 23 and end at 5 p.m. PT/8 p.m. ET on Sept. 25. As for what we&#x27;ll be fighting for, you can choose to be on team Gear, Grub, of Fun (in regards to what you&#x27;d bring with you to a deserted island). It should be a great time if the pre-launch Splatfest held recently is any indication.
Check out the Splatfest trailer for yourself below: 


The trailer above also reveals that some additional Splatoon 3 updates are on the way, too, although it stopped short of telling us exactly what to expect.

                              <span>On November 4, Hazelight and Electronic Arts&#x27; It Takes Two launches on Switch. This heartwarming adventure originally released in 2021 on PC and PlayStation and Xbox consoles. It received a 9.25 out of 10 review from Game Informer and also won The Game Awards&#x27; 2021&#x27;s Game of the Year honors.
It Takes Two can only be played cooperatively and can either be played on a single Switch via splitscreen or on two Switches via local wireless or online via the free friend&#x27;s pass.
In my review of the Xbox One version, I said &quot;It Takes Two may not be the platforming juggernaut that it aspires to be, but it more than makes up for it with its big heart, wealth in variety, and gorgeous imagery. All of its individual actions are things we’ve done in other games, but when applied to this distinct cooperative approach, they take on a whole new life and are used in wonderful ways over a long adventure. The action will have you laughing and screaming at your TV, and the story stays strong throughout, creating the backbone for an entertaining adventure that roars with excitement and should keep you glued to the controller to see if this couple’s lost love can be rekindled.&quot;
Preoders for the Switch version begin today.</span>

It seems Nintendo is ready to take us back to that world and its excellent HD-2D visual style because it announced Octopath Traveler II is coming to Switch February 24, 2023. 
You can check out the reveal trailer below:


As you can see, Octopath Traveler II is looking great, as expected. Rather than picking up with our previous heroes, this sequel presents us with eight new travelers: the warrior Hikari, the dancer Agnea, the merchant Partitio, the scholar Osvald, the thief Throné, the cleric Temenos, t…</span>

                              <span>Cyberpunk 2077 is having a bit of a resurgence at the moment. CD Projekt Red&#x27;s 2077 anime, Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, developed by Studio Trigger and Netflix is out (as of today!) and the Phantom Liberty expansion for the game is due out next year. While Phantom Liberty has been confirmed to be 2077&#x27;s first and only expansion, it seems CDPR is not yet ready to part with this world. 
During the CD Projekt Group H1 2022 earnings call, CDPR&#x27;s vice president of business development Michał Nowakowski said the studio is committed to doing more with this IP, as reported by IGN. 


&quot;We decided to develop one major expansion for Cyberpunk, which is going to take advantage of all the capabilities of the new-gen consoles,&quot; Nowakowski said during the call. &quot;Having said that, we&#x27;re totally, fully committed to developing the Cyberpunk IP further, beyond this particular Cyberpunk expansion. We&#x27;ve put a lot of effort and time into building this franchise and we definitely want to continue to build upon what was built right now – with new stories, new experiences, new content, basically. Not just the video game format...in terms of expansions, there&#x27;s just going to be one major expansion. However, there&#x27;s going to be new stuff in the future.&quot; 
As for what exactly, only time will tell but considering a Cyberpunk 2077 anime is already out, perhaps the studio is looking to dive more into the entertainment medium with this IP. As IGN notes, there&#x27;s also The Molasses Flood, a Boston-based studio that CDPR acquired earlier this year, which is working on an existing CDPR IP. This could be something related to The Witcher, of course, but perhaps it&#x27;s something related to 2077. 
In the meantime, read about why now is the right time to play Cyberpunk 2077 and then read about what to expect in next year&#x27;s Phantom Liberty expansion.

                              <span>Developer Platinum Games and publisher Square Enix have revealed that Babylon&#x27;s Fall will shut down next year, less than a full year after its March 3 launch this year. 
More specifically, Platinum Games will terminate the game&#x27;s service on February 27, 2023. As for why, the team didn&#x27;t really outline the reason but it&#x27;s likely due to the game&#x27;s poorly received launch and its lack of players since then. Square Enix tried to remedy the game&#x27;s issues by sending players a survey asking them how the team can improve the game and shortly after, Platinum Games said it has &quot;no plans to reduce the scale of development on Babylon&#x27;s Fall.&quot; It seems things have changed because Babylon&#x27;s Fall will fall early next year.

                              <span>Hot on the heels of the announcement of a long-awaited Nintendo Direct, PlayStation announced that tomorrow will also feature a special livestreamed presentation of its own. Now, in addition to that aforementioned Nintendo Direct tomorrow morning, we&#x27;re now also receiving a PlayStation State of Play stream in the afternoon.

Tomorrow&#x27;s presentation is set to last approximately 20 minutes and will feature new updates and gameplay footage from 10 games across PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation VR2.
This PlayStation State of Play stream is set for tomorrow, September 13 at 3 p.m. Pacific/6 p.m. Eastern. You can watch it live on PlayStation&#x27;s Twitch and YouTube channels.

                              <span>Adventure platformer Little Orpheus was meant to launch on PC back in March but was delayed at the last minute. At the time, the announcement said the decision to delay was taken &quot;in light of recent events&quot;, referencing without directly naming the Russian invasion of Ukraine. 

Well, as of today, Little Orpheus, which is a scifi adventure about a Soviet cosmonaut in 1962, has been released.

                              <span>One of the best developments in PC gaming over the past five years has been the arrival of the entire, silly, joyous Yakuza series on our platform. Well, now it looks like Yakuza&#x27;s detective agency spin-offs are also heading to PC, as 2018&#x27;s Judgment and 2021&#x27;s Lost Judgment have both received an ESRB rating for &quot;Windows PC&quot;.

                              <span>The XIII remake, when it was released in 2020, was a disaster. Players complained of poor AI, bugs, missing multiplayer and an art style that abandoned the iconic, cel-shaded look of the original. After almost two years of further work by a different developer, the remake of the XIII remake is now live.

                              <span>I only just realised, while mentioning the dev&#x27;s next game, that we never posted about excellent indie horror game Mothered. Not to be confused with the unrelated Remothered games, it&#x27;s the tale of a young girl returning home after surgery to find everything is weird and her mother is some sort of eerie mannequin. It might be my favourite horror game of 2021? Now&#x27;s a good time to raise Mothered because: 1) it finally has a demo for newcomers; 2) for veterans, that demo actually hides a secret expansion continuing the game&#x27;s story.

The announcement was buried amongst a whole bundle of other JRPG information from today’s Nintendo Direct broadcast. You’ll have to make do with the Switch trailer below for now, I’m afraid, because Squeenix haven’t released a PC one yet.

The game had struggled to make an impact since its launch on March 3rd earlier this year, with concurrent player counts dropping to zero at times. It hadn&#x27;t looked good from the early days when, as we pointed out, Platinum Games were tweeting statements that Babylon’s Fall’s wasn’t &quot;in danger&quot; just two weeks following its launch.

Ross said her departure was due to a “family medical issue” in a statement shared on her Twitter account. She’d been at the company since it was established in 2007.

Set in Japan during its feudal period but with a fantasy twist, EA and Koei Tecmo describe the as-yet-untitled project as “the next great hunting game”. Dispel those mental images of theHunter: Call Of The Wild and Big Buck Hunter though, because it sounds like this is more in the vein of hack-and-slash monster hunting shenanigans.

Unlike the mere low-res images of abandoned Steam Deck designs we’ve already seen, however, these were mostly functional PC gaming machines. That’s according to Valve engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais, who shared a video of an early, more rounded-looking Deck booting to SteamOS and loading up Half-Life 2.

                              <span>Correctly striking a succession of notes in a rhythm game gives me a huge high, but I&#x27;m more familiar with feeling the corresponding low. A succession of missed notes whizzing past sounds like an ode to my failure, and in mashups that mix demanding rhythms with another genre - like Crypt Of The Necrodancer, say - these reminders of my musical inadequacy often drown out even the simplest pleasures. 

Often but not always. Metal: Hellsinger&#x27;s mix of rhythm game and Doom 2016-style shooter kept me tapping my foot as I battled through hell - even as I failed regularly, and even as someone who doesn&#x27;t care for metal music.

Remember when we just had E3? Essentially a fortnight of reveals, updates, and surprises as they relate to all things gaming? Well, today, E3 is now 12 months long... And it&#x27;s not called E3 anymore. And E3 isn&#x27;t even involved. Is this better, or is this worse? I guess it&#x27;s just a matter of perspective... Where was I?
Ah yes, here on Destructoid, and welcoming you, our beloved community to today&#x27;s surprise PlayStation State of Play presentation, dropped upon us with less than 24 hours&#x27; notice, and ready to rock our worlds with 20 minutes of news and updates pertaining to several titles headed to platforms PS4, PS5, and PSVR2. While Sony is tight-lipped on the content of today&#x27;s stream, we can expect around 10 games in all — and given the relative shortness of the show, it&#x27;s probably gonna be a bit of a trailer fest.
And so, we&#x27;d like you all to join us for the State of Play, which kicks off 30 minutes from now. We will, as always, be bringing you all of the hot news right here on site, but it&#x27;s always fun to sit in the peanut gallery and offer your thoughts on Sony&#x27;s reveals. What&#x27;s coming? FromSoft news? A new Street Fighter 6 character reveal? The Callisto Protocol release date? Blood &amp; Truth 2?
There&#x27;s only one way to find out.

There were an awful lot of games revealed and updated during today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct presentation. And while the heavy hitters of the show–your Zeldas, your Fire Emblems–will be headline acts for weeks to come, it was one of the smaller announcements that has me more excited than anything else: Story of Seasons: A Wonderful Life. Originally released for the Nintendo GameCube as Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life, the game was unique for its use of chapters to tell the story of your farmer&#x27;s life on the land. Characters age and die, and your child can be raised from an infant to an adult where they can take over the reins of the farm. It&#x27;s perhaps the best storytelling the Story of Seasons series has seen, presenting your character&#x27;s life on the farm as more t…</span>

                              <span>An obvious Steam Deck candidate
It&#x27;s been a stellar year for strategy games, and now one is making the leap from Switch to PC. Triangle Strategy is coming to Steam on October 13.
Square Enix announced the port today, amid all the news blasting out during and just after the Nintendo Direct. The Steam port rolls in with two options: a $59.99 base game (currently at a 10% discount) or a $64.99 digital deluxe that comes with a digital artbook. You can also opt to bundle a Triangle Strategy purchase with the newly ported Various Daylife, if you need more than just one RPG in your near future.
Triangle Strategy is a strategy RPG from Square Enix and Artdink, that takes very much after its genre predecessors. It follows Serenoa Wolffort, the heir-to-be of a house caught in the tensions between several nations.

If you&#x27;re in the market for a strategy RPG with some political tension and interesting choices, Triangle Strategy is very much up your alley. It&#x27;s also got a classic approach to tactics that reminded me of both Tactics Ogre and Final Fantasy Tactics when I was playing it.

Choose your own path
Triangle Strategy has a fantastic combat system and set of classes, with every character bringing their own twist to the lineup. There are multiple paths and a &quot;golden route&quot; to unlock as well. It seems like a great strategy RPG to pick up for Steam Deck users (fingers crossed it gets Verified status as soon as possible).
In my review, my only shortcomings centered on the dialogue and story pacing, which can wear on a bit. Otherwise, if you&#x27;re someone seeking tactics on the PC, there&#x27;s no reason not to eye Triangle Strategy. And please, oh please, let&#x27;s see some sick mods for this one too.
Triangle Strategy hits Steam on October 13.

Back in 2019, the global gaming community was introduced to two totes-adorbs, totes-dopey schoolyard sluggers: Kyoko and Misako, collectively known as the River City Girls. Essentially a rebirth of sorts for the legendary Kunio-kun series, WayForward&#x27;s River City Girls revitalized the franchise for modern audiences, retaining the open-world nature and nose-busting brawling of its predecessors and dressing it up with dazzling colors, a badass soundtrack, slick artwork, and cool new characters. River City Girls reinvented not only the Kunio-kun series, but also brawlers themselves.
However, in news that still surprises folk today, River City Girls was not the debut adventure for Kyoko and Misako. No, our excitable and somewhat obsessive teens made their original video game…</span>

                              <span>The end is coming
The blessed occurrence of 3DS stability updates has struck again: as the system has just been patched this week.
Yes, it&#x27;s a stability update, which generally focuses on &quot;minor adjustments&quot; for the hardware — and have been known to address various exploits. This is the second stability update for the 3DS this year (we&#x27;ll mention why it got an update in August in a moment), with one update apiece in 2021 and 2020, and two in 2019.
Sadly, as most of you know (most of you already know that I won&#x27;t miss any chance to further eulogize the 3DS and WiiU), the 3DS, as an active platform, is set to die out on March 27, 2023. As in the 3DS as a general platform — since all eShop purchases will not be possible. The cutoff for the ability to add money to your account already passed on August 29, 2022. Some regions have already begun shutdown operations.
If you heard it here first, I&#x27;m sorry! Oh, and the Wii U is lumped into this entire scheme too. I hit you with the apology first to lull you into a false sense of security.
Anyway, here&#x27;s the full patch notes from Nintendo for this round of 3DS stability updates:
Ver. 11.16.0-49U (September 12th, 2022)
Further improvements to overall system stability and other minor adjustments have been made to enhance the user experience.

These streamers are just built different, because it feels like every time I turn around, another one has completed a seemingly impossible task in games with increasingly ridiculous means of playing said games. There was the streamer who played Untitled Goose Game by turning himself into a giant goose controller, or the Elden Ring streamer who challenged herself with beating the game using only a dance pad — you know, like you use for Dance Dance Revolution.
At this point, nothing should surprise me, but yesterday I was shocked to see a video come across my Twitter feed of a streamer playing Call of Duty: Warzone with a recorder. You know, the little plastic flute they forced seemingly every fourth grader in the United States to try to learn how to play? That&#x27;s the o…</span>

One of the more intriguing titles on my (and many others) watchlist is Round8 Studio&#x27;s Lies of P — this gothic retelling of the famous tale of Pinocchio is currently in development for PC and console platforms, and promises a dark-yet-faithful take on the story of the puppet child and his endeavor to become human.
Publisher Neowiz has taken the bold step of releasing a huge gameplay showcase, which features no less than 40+ minutes of Lies of P in action. The video spotlights the opulent but miserable architecture, grim splendor, and frightening oppression of the city of Krat, the backdrop to our young hero&#x27;s quest. Pinocchio must battle violent automatons, engage with what remains of the local community, and harness the power of falsehoods in order to come …</span>

The year in games is closing out with a reunion. Crisis Core -Final Fantasy VII- Reunion, a remaster of the original PSP game, arrives for PC and consoles on December 13, 2022.
Previously set for sometime in the winter season, Square Enix revealed the remaster will arrive just ahead of the new year. Shown off during today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct, Crisis Core looks like it&#x27;s bringing all the action and antics of the original game to bear once more.

The new trailer spotlights not just the combat, though. Many of the characters who show up in Crisis Core -Final Fantasy VII- Reunion are also crucial to the overall FFVII plot. Sephiroth, Cloud, and Aerith are all here, as well as a host of Shinra employees. Heck, even…</span>

                              <span>From September 18 to October 1, 2022
If you want to get in on a shiny Eternatus Pokemon Sword and Shield event, you&#x27;ll have to go to an actual store in the near future.
Following a tease that it would be happening in some regions, information on the distribution event is fully live now on the official Pokemon site.
All the details on the Pokemon shiny Eternatus distribution:
It&#x27;s located at GameStop (in the US and Canada) or EB Games (in Australia and New Zealand)
As per usual you don&#x27;t need to buy anything, and the code will be distributed by way of a card
The event runs from September 18 through October 1
The Eternatus you&#x27;ll get from the event is level 100, with timid nature and the pressure ability (move-wise it sports dynamax cannon, eternabeam, sludge bomb, and flamethrower)
Nintendo also provides re-iterated instructions on mystery gift redemption:
To claim your in-game gift, follow these steps:
Launch your Pokémon Sword or Pokémon Shield
Select Mystery Gift on the X menu.
Select Get a Mystery Gift.
Select Get with Code/Password to save your game and connect to the internet.
Enter your code or password.
Watch as the gift arrives in your game. (Pokémon will appear in your party or your Pokémon Boxes. Items will appear in your Bag.)
Be sure to save your game.
Overall it&#x27;s a pretty simple process: other than going to the store! At least this event is for a shiny legendary, and not a quirky character from the anime.

                              <span>The glory of Demon Fang on high-end hardware
A classic entry in the Tales series is getting new life on newer consoles. Tales of Symphonia Remastered brings the story of Lloyd, Colette, and company to PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch in early 2023.
Revealed during today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct, Tales of Symphonia Remastered brings the GameCube-era RPG to modern systems. It will get a version on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One, and be playable on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S via their respective versions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;A8XVavbSrDw
Tales of Symphonia originally released in 2003 and was brought over to North America in 2004. The remaster will feature both graphical enhancements and improved gameplay, though no details have been given just yet.
Alongside a physical edition, Bandai Namco is also publishing a Chosen Edition of Tales of Symphonia Remastered. This will come with a special metal case, art prints, and stickers. Both editions are up for pre-order on the Bandai Namco store here.

Back to Sylvarant
Tales of Symphonia is a fondly remembered entry in the long-running Tales series. It was likely the introduction to the series for many players, myself included. It&#x27;s definitely a lengthy role-playing game, but it has an incredible cast of characters and a really fantastic story.

Seeing another Tales game get a modern port, much like Tales of Vesperia did a while back, is great. While Tales of Arise laid out a path forward for the series, I&#x27;m excited that newcomers will have an easy way of playing Symphonia too. Honestly, just keep this train rolling and dive back into some older entries while we&#x27;re at it. My fingers are now crossed that Abyss is on a list somewhere at Tales HQ.
Tales of Symphonia Remastered arrives for PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch sometime in early 2023.

Finishing in style, today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct closed out with a brief trailer and a release date for the highly anticipated The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. The exciting follow-up to the widely loved The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild will launch on Nintendo Switch May 12, 2023.
The evocative new trailer, which you can check out below, begins with some traditional wall carvings, instantly recognizable as belonging to the Zelda universe. These solemn images then transition to a short but breathtaking clip, that sees our indelible hero, Link, as he barrels through an ornate pair of double doors and freefalls into the great beyond. We are then presented with some short snippets of world-traversing action before the trailer concludes with its warming new logo and title. Very exciting.

                              <span>A whole bunch of Resident Evil is coming to the Switch
Nintendo Switch owners will get a chance to check out the modern run of Resident Evil, thanks to the cloud. Resident Evil Village arrives October 28, with three more Resident Evil games coming in 2022, all via the cloud.
The first up is Village, which launches on October 28 and will get the upcoming Winters&#x27; Expansion on December 2. A demo is available now, so you can test out how the cloud processing works for your setup.
Winters&#x27; Expansion adds a new third-person option to Resident Evil Village, as well as a new story following Rose Winters and some new Mercenaries content.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;vJ1Ih37TnTI
Also coming to the Nintendo Switch via cloud are three more Resident Evil games, all hitting this year. The modern remakes of Resident Evil 2 and 3 will come to Nintendo Switch alongside Resident Evil 7, all available through cloud streaming.

Scary clouds on the horizon
Seeing these games come to Nintendo Switch at all is pretty exciting, though the cloud addendum puts a bit of an asterisk on it. These are some pretty hefty games, and it&#x27;s understandable that the Switch alone probably can&#x27;t do all the heavy lifting. It&#x27;s far from the first game to try it out, either.
But these cloud versions have had a history of being pretty spotty, and in some cases don&#x27;t hold up well to comparisons. At the very least, it&#x27;s nice that the demo gives players an option to try the current implementation out, and see if it&#x27;s the way they want to experience Ethan Winters&#x27; Hand-Slammin&#x27; Holiday Adventure.
Resident Evil Village arrives on the Nintendo Switch via cloud on October 28, 2022. The other three Resident Evil entries will hit the Switch via cloud before year&#x27;s end.

                              <span>It&#x27;s called Kirby&#x27;s Return to Dreamland Deluxe
Kirby&#x27;s Return to Dreamland Deluxe is confirmed thanks to a Nintendo Direct! It&#x27;s coming to Switch next year, and will bring back the 2011 Wii game as a re-release.
In this Switch version, Kirby will sport new copy abilities, and there&#x27;s local play for up to four players. Everyone can be Kirby this time, denoted by different colors of Kirby models. A collection of minigames is available, including Magolor&#x27;s Tome Trackers, and Samurai Kirby. Four-player play is confirmed for all minigames.
Nintendo has some further details for us: &quot;The heroic puffball’s Wii game is returning … this time in deluxe proportions! One day, a mysterious spaceship crash-lands on Planet Popstar. To help the mysterious Magolor, Kirby and his friends set off on a captivating quest. When inhaling certain enemies, Kirby will gain access to a wide range of Copy Abilities – with the new Mecha Copy Ability making its debut! The game supports multiplayer for up to four players on the same system by sharing Joy-Con controllers. Plus, everyone can play as Kirby at the same time while using their favorite Copy Abilities! There’s also a collection of subgames to play, including returning ones like Samurai Kirby and new ones like Magolor’s Tome Trackers.&quot;
It&#x27;s out on February 24, 2023, and really, I can&#x27;t wait! The original was fantastic as a good clean Kirby game, and it&#x27;s about time my wife and I fully replayed it.

                              <span>We didn&#x27;t get any gameplay today
Just what we all wanted! Nintendo legend Shigeru Miyamoto himself appeared on this morning&#x27;s Nintendo Direct to confirm that Pikmin 4 would be out in 2023. No more aimless waiting!
Miyamoto said that although we weren&#x27;t getting any gameplay today, we did get a single screenshot. According to Miyamoto, the gameplay is &quot;simpler&quot; this time around, with a focus on &quot;dandori;&quot; or &quot;strategically deploying and commanding the Pikmin.&quot;
It&#x27;s been a while since Pikmin 3, that&#x27;s for sure! This is all Nintendo had to say on the matter outside of the stream: &quot;The first sneak peek at the next game in the Pikmin franchise revealed a tranquil park and a napping Bulborb, but it was still missing one important element … Pikmin! Where could they be? More details about this new title for Nintendo Switch will be revealed ahead of its 2023 launch.&quot;
So there you have it: a coy confirmation that we&#x27;ll get some sort of proper update on Pikmin 4 before it comes out. Though, the lack of gameplay today (as well as the lack of date announcements before May 2023) likely ensures that this will be a mid-to-late 2023 game. Again, all we have right now is &quot;2023.&quot;

                              <span>We&#x27;ve been expecting you, Mr. Bond
During today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct presentation, the publisher revealed that one of the most popular Nintendo 64 titles of all time, Rare&#x27;s GoldenEye 007, will be heading to the Nintendo Switch Online service at some point in the near future. Rare would also announce that the same release will be made available on Xbox platforms via the Xbox Game Pass service.
Many had wondered whether the 1998 classic would ever show its face on the Switch, or any modern gaming service, given its tangled mess of licensing deals. It seems, however, that Rare, Nintendo, and Xbox have managed to cross the i&#x27;s and dotted the t&#x27;s, and the multiplayer classic will soon be available to Nintendo Switch Online subscribers and Xbox platforms. Online multiplayer has been confirmed for the Switch release, but the Xbox Game Pass version may be local only.
GoldenEye 007 is &quot;coming soon&quot; to Nintendo Switch Online and Xbox Game Pass.

Other upcoming N64 games include Mario Party, Mario Party 2, and Pilotwings 64 in 2022. And next year, Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscribers are also getting 1080 Snowboarding, Excitebike 64, Mario Party 3, Pokémon Stadium, and Pokémon Stadium 2.

                              <span>Nintendo has delayed it a bit
The Nintendo Switch Sports golf update has been delayed, according to Nintendo via their Nintendo Direct stream this morning. As a reminder, golf was touted as a free addition to the game shortly after launch, but now it&#x27;ll arrive &quot;this holiday.&quot;
We did get a detail though! Eight players can play online in the same course at the same time — and folks can get kicked out. You can also &quot;hit the fairway across 21 holes from the Wii Sports series.&quot;
So far, the post-launch support for Nintendo Switch Sports has been fairly low-key, as it came with a lot of features at launch to begin with. There&#x27;s still a wishlist from fans to be sure (including more long-term rewards), but Golf should nicely round out the long-term impact of the game.
The big July update pretty much took care of a lot of those aforementioned wishlist items, including the shoring up of soccer (which thankfully now has full, rather than partial, leg strap support), and a general cleanup in terms of the overarching control scheme. Online play was also tweaked, including an indicator that informs players if someone has a weak connection.

Eight new travelers will feature in this game, and their specific paths will change depending on whether it&#x27;s day or night. Their stories will once again intertwine, and of course see all of them uniting to take on evil.

Well, now we know what that Final Fantasy Theatrhythm Final Bar Line trademark was all about earlier this year!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;1ODX-GwpBHU
Thanks to today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct, we know it&#x27;s a new entry coming to Switch, and it&#x27;ll sport two-player local play, along with online support. A few of the songs confirmed in the trailer for Final Fantasy Theatrhythm Final Bar Line are:
One Winged Angel
Torn from the Heavens
Suteki Da Ne
Final Fantasy Theatrhythm Final Bar Line is out on February 16, 2023. Oh, and paid DLC from the NieR, Saga, Live a Live, and Octopath Traveler franchises are confirmed. You can get a look at everything included in the digital deluxe and premium digital deluxe editions below. It&#x27;s uh, a lot! And these editions are extremely Square Enix.
I don&#x27;t know if anyone else in the west has fond memories of this series, but I certainly do. I even imported a copy of Theatrhythm Dragon Quest on 3DS just to play it in 2015, as it was never released in the west. Really, as long as the tracklist is handled properly (read: and a ton of key songs that deal with the game in question aren&#x27;t gated behind DLC or some bonus of some kind), Square Enix can just keep making these. Hopefully this one turns out alright come February.

                              <span>What is a marooned Inkling to do?
During today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct, the publisher announced the first splatfest for its brand new release Splatoon 3. As per usual, players will be asked to choose their teams and then battle it out to decide the winning answer to a fun question, with points decided by public vote and in-game action.
The first splatfest for Splatoon 3 is a question of desert island activities, and asks what you would bring to a desert island, should you ever find yourself marooned. The choices are Gear, Grub, or Fun. Honestly, that&#x27;s pretty darn bizarre. Only one of them will keep you alive... unless you Eat Fun.
Regardless, the first splatfest will take place on the weekend of September 23 and, as usual, will run from Friday through Saturday in North America. It is to be assumed that the European edition will run Saturday through, as was the case of Splatoon 2.
Splatoon 3 is available now on Nintendo Switch.

Well, that was one heck of a Nintendo Direct, wasn&#x27;t it? While it perhaps wasn&#x27;t the massive Zelda blowout we were all expecting, Nintendo had no shortage of first-party reveals and exclusives, amidst some big Indies and multiplatform releases.

If you had a GameCube and you loved RPGs, then you&#x27;ve likely played Tales of Symphonia. The first Tales of game to be released in Europe, it&#x27;s arguably among the best games on the system. Now, fans who may have got into the esteemed Tales of series late will be able to try out this classic when it gets a remaster on Switch next year!
During the Nintendo Direct, Bandai Namco&#x27;s action RPG got its own dedicate section, showing off the game&#x27;s combat, characters, and unique cell-shaded visuals that would go on to inspire the 3D entries going forward.

                              <span>Howdy there, partner.
Hazellight Studios&#x27; Game of the Year winner at the 2021 Game Awards, It Takes Two, is making the jump to Switch on 4th November. This was one of the many announcements that was heavily rumoured by multiple people last week, but it&#x27;s fantastic to see this acclaimed title finally hop over to the hybrid console.
This platforming adventure game sees a married couple, who are on the brink of divorce, get turned into dolls by their daughter. Rose then play-acts with the two dolls in an attempt to fix her parent&#x27;s relationship. The game is a co-op experience designed to be played split-screen with a partner — or friend, or whoever you want (or online, even!). The game&#x27;s multiple levels are inspired by different genres and each one requires you to co-operate with your partner in order to progress.

                              <span>Following the launch of PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, multiple video game publishers bumped up the price of new-gen versions of some of their games. While Ubisoft resisted that trend to this point, CEO Yves Guillemot tells Axios in an exclusive interview that it is making $70 the standard price for bigger triple-A experiences published by the company. 
We already knew that the new-gen versions of Ubisoft&#x27;s long-in-development pirate game, Skull and Bones, would retail for $70, but now it appears to be the start of the standard pricing for Ubisoft. In that interview with Axios, Guillemot stated that &quot;Some of the games will come at the same price as the competition. The big AAA games will come at $70.&quot; 
In 2020, Ubisoft CTO Frédérick Duguet said that games released in 2020 would not reach the $70 mark (and they didn&#x27;t, outside of special editions). Then, last year, Duguet said, &quot;In terms of pricing, we&#x27;ve been analyzing the competitive dynamics of the past quarter, and we are still looking at new opportunities, but we have not made any decision yet.&quot; Today&#x27;s Axios interview with Guillemot is the first indication that Ubisoft has come to an official decision regarding its pricing.
Ubisoft is far from the only gaming company increasing prices. Publishers like 2K Games, Activision, and Sony have been selling select games for $70 since the introduction of the new consoles in 2020. Meanwhile, just last month, PlayStation announced it was raising the price of its PlayStation 5 consoles in select, non-U.S. markets. Skull and Bones, the first $70 Ubisoft title, is set to launch on November 8. It&#x27;s worth noting that new-gen versions of Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage are currently listed on retailer websites for $50.
You can read the full interview with Guillemot, which touches on subjects like the Ubisoft&#x27;s troubled workplace culture, the company&#x27;s current approach to NFTs following Ghost Recon Breakpoint&#x27;s integration of them, and plenty more here.</span>

                              <span>When Danny Peña was a child, he would spend hours playing games at his local New York arcade before he received his first console, an Atari 2600, from his grandmother. Peña knew early on that he wanted to do something in the games industry, but he didn&#x27;t know what. All along the way, he was told that video games won&#x27;t pay the bills, but he didn&#x27;t let that deter him. Flash forward a couple of decades, and Peña returned to New York to show his mother a billboard featuring his face in Times Square – a monument to his success in the games industry, but not one that was easy to achieve. Now, with a new children&#x27;s book called Danny Loves Video Games about his life and career set to release this week, I sat down with Peña to chat about his road to this point.

Metal: Hellsinger knows precisely what it is from the second it begins: a love letter to fast-paced first-person shooters, especially Doom, and a tribute to metal music and the culture surrounding it. It’s a no-frills shooter that asks, “What if you had to blow bodies to pieces to the beat of a metal album made by genre greats?” It excels at answering that question. It’s not perfect – the bosses are uninspired at times, and it could use an extra dash of variety in combat design – but my criticisms mattered little to my overall enjoyment of my 1…</span>

                              <span>Nintendo has revealed that it will livestream a Nintendo Direct tomorrow.
More specifically, the Direct will begin at 7 a.m. PT/10 a.m. ET tomorrow, Sept. 13, and it will run for roughly 40 minutes. That&#x27;s one of the largest Directs of the year, so it will likely be jam-packed with new looks at previously announced games and new ones, too (perhaps a Zelda port or two, if rumors about this Direct are correct). As for what to expect, Nintendo says the Direct will &quot;mostly&quot; focus on Switch games launching this Winter. 
Tune in at 7 a.m. PT tomorrow, 9/13, for a #NintendoDirect livestream featuring roughly 40 minutes of information mostly focused on #NintendoSwitch games launching this winter.

The key word here is &quot;mostly&quot; because that leaves just enough room for Nintendo to discuss and/or announce games coming next year. Only time will tell, but fortunately, we don&#x27;t have to wait long because the Direct is less than 24 hours away. 
If you&#x27;re in the U.K., please see the tweet below: 
As a mark of respect during this period of national mourning, we will not livestream tomorrow’s Nintendo Direct. It will be published as a video-on-demand on our YouTube channel at 16:00 (UK time) tomorrow.

                              <span>Splatoon 3 is already shaping up to be another hit for the franchise and Nintendo. Selling 3.45 million copies since Friday in just Japan, Splatoon 3 had the best launch ever for a Switch game in Japan, as reported by Eurogamer. 
This includes both digital and physical sales. It&#x27;s safe to say the squid (and Octoling) community are off to a great start with the threequel that&#x27;s exclusive to Switch. According to Eurogamer, however, despite the game also being number one on the U.K. boxed charts, as reported by GamesIndustry.biz, overall launch sales are down 9% compared to Splatoon 2 there. The U.K.&#x27;s boxed chart only included physical games, though, so it&#x27;s possible that decline isn&#x27;t present when digital games are taken into account. There&#x27;s no word on how Splatoon 3 is fairing in the U.S., but it typically follows trends in the U.K. 


&quot;Nintendo Co., LTD...announced that domestic sales of the Splatoon 3 game for the Nintendo Switch system have surpassed 3.45 million units in the first three days since launch on September 9, 2022,&quot; a Nintendo press release reads. &quot;This is the highest domestic sales level for any Nintendo software within the first three days.&quot; 
It&#x27;s no surprise Splatoon 3 is selling well in Japan and elsewhere – it&#x27;s great! And you can read about why in the Game Informer Splatoon 3 review.

For the current-flagship Intel Xeon Platinum 8380 &quot;Ice Lake&quot; processors, Ubuntu 22.10 does deliver some performance advantages over the current Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS release. However, Ubuntu 22.10 still trails in a distance behind Intel&#x27;s own Clear Linux platform for the most aggressive out-of-the-box performance.</span>

                              <span>Fantasy action RPG Forspoken has been delayed more times than most games, although it’s finally pencilled in for a January release date. We’re still quite a way off from then, but Sony have released a smattering more gameplay footage today, detailing the moves you&#x27;ll be pulling as heroine Frey &quot;I&#x27;m seeing freaking dragons&quot; Holland. Alas, said footage has been crushed down to only a handful of GIFs over on the PlayStation Blog, but our friends at Eurogamer have a bigger, chunkier hands on preview that tells us more about why it won&#x27;t be mega cringe. Alas, we weren&#x27;t privy to this Forspoken demo, so have a watch with us below.

                              <span>I did a lot of talking at Gamescom, whether that be to developers or muttering to myself deliriously as I typed stuff up in the evening. Talking to devs especially is a wonderful thing, especially when you&#x27;re playing their game and it resonates with you. But getting hands-on with an early portion of American Arcadia rendered me virtually silent, to the point where I had to apologise to the devs for being so quiet.
And I wasn&#x27;t being rude; far from it! I was just so engrossed in the game&#x27;s mixture of side-scrolling platforming and first-person puzzling. Keep this under surveillance, because I think it&#x27;s going to be a real hit when it lands.

                              <span>Gloomwood is, so far, a very good game, but it is also not much of a game - in the literal sense that it has launched into early access incomplete. There&#x27;s currently just enough of it to play that it makes you feel both bereft and quite annoyed when it suddenly clangs its great iron doors shut in front of you. &quot;Let me in!!&quot; you scream, as you hammer on the silent portal. &quot;I really like Thief! I get you! I want to throw more decapitated heads as lures!&quot;
If you are one of those people who bases their gaming personality on liking the original Thief series, Gloomwood will have been on your radar for a while. It&#x27;s a grimy, steampunk-ish stealth immersive sim with a deliberate low-poly vibe, and it picks up the abandoned Thief football to absolutely run with it. But, though the current EA build is but short, it feels like Gloomwood is aiming to punt that ball into outer space. There&#x27;s so much more room to be playful and experiment than I expected, and it&#x27;s so much fun that if you&#x27;d never played a stealth sim in your life I&#x27;d recommend Gloomwood. Except I wouldn&#x27;t, because it feels like I&#x27;d be doing you a disservice to recommend it now, when the fun will be so quickly snatched away.

                              <span>It&#x27;s a very odd feeling, building a catapult all on your lonesome while watching fiery death rain down on your enemy&#x27;s castle in the valley below. I suspect it&#x27;s probably a similar experience to watching the carnage of Chivalry II play out from the safety of a nearby bench. The newly announced Warlander from Nier Replicant devs Toylogic certainly has the medieval setting in common with Torn Banner Studio&#x27;s first-person hack and slash, but this free-to-play multiplayer warfare game is an altogether different beast. You control your warriors in third-person, for starters, and its more cartoonish visuals allow for, well, daft cataclysmic events like a flaming meteor shower to hone in on a player&#x27;s position without appearing completely over the top. As it prepares to enter its first open beta later today, September 12th, I went hands on with a brief demo build to see what it was all about.

                              <span>&quot;Oh, come on!&quot; is a phrase you hear a lot in Sunday Gold. It&#x27;s often uttered by your knuckle-dusting healer Sally, and is invariably followed up by, &quot;You havin&#x27; a laugh, mate?&quot; and &quot;Facking hell!&quot; - partly because Sally is from Laaaandan and is thus obligated to speak lik&#x27; tha&#x27;, innit (because how else would you know this is a game set in Laaaandan), but also because the thugs, security guards and cybernetic dogs she&#x27;s often fighting in this seedy tale of corporate dystopia are some of the most frustrating enemies known to video games. The type who are seemingly resistant to every single weapon type in your arsenal, or who invariably have big, scripted healing sequences just when you&#x27;re about to nail &#x27;em. 
It&#x27;s a phrase I often found myself echoing while playing Sunday Gold for review, too, both during its tedious, war of attrition-style turn-based battles, and while trying to figure out some of its more obtuse puzzles. BKOM Studios have tried to fuse one too many things together in Sunday Gold, and the result is a messy, somewhat artificial blend of Deathloop&#x27;s style, Invisible Inc&#x27;s tension and a more action-led focus on the cerebral role-playing of Disco Elysium. There&#x27;s still much to admire in its stylish visuals and atmospheric music, but I also haven&#x27;t been this cross playing a video game since Felix The Reaper, and that&#x27;s saying something.

                              <span>Ubisoft’s subscription service doesn’t have the user-base of something like Microsoft’s Game Pass. Now, it seems, the French publishers are hoping that plonking in some indie games among its multitudes of Assassin’s Creeds and Tom Clancy shooters will attract a more varied clientele. They’re also running a free trial period for Ubisoft+ until October 10th, including for lapsed subscribers, so that’s something.

It’s 23°c outside and folks are already thinking about PC gaming deals they might want in the damp, dark, dying days of November. Hey, I’m not knocking it, and I’ll even put together this guide that early Black Friday birds might find useful. I just don’t even think of what I want for dinner later.

                              <span>Square Enix are taking more steps to implement the controversial blockchain technology in their games. Squeenix have teamed with blockchain company Oasys, who describe themselves as “environmentally-friendly”. This is because of their less energy-intensive “proof-of-stake” mechanism compared to “proof-of-work” methods such as those used in Bitcoin mining. Oasys&#x27;s plans fits with Squeenix’s intention to develop tokenised economies built on blockchain in their future games.

An ESRB 18+ rating that lists &quot;real gambling&quot; appears to be in effect for the upcoming back-to-basics Assassin’s Creed set in 9th century Baghdad. If you missed the first look at Mirage over the weekend then you can watch the cinematic trailer below.

                              <span>Thermal Design Power (TDP) je na nových procesorech konfigurovatelné a sestává se s PL1 pro spotřebu při dlouhém trvání a PL2 pro krátké trvání. Na serveru cnx-software.com vyšel minulý týden návod, jak nastavit limity PL1 a PL2 na procesorech Intel a AMD. Pokud nemůžete nastavit PL1 a PL2 v Biosu, v Linuxu je možné použít powercap-utils a rozhraní Intel RAPL (Running Average Power Limit). PL1 a PL2 jde přečíst pomocí powercap-info a zapsat pomocí  powercap-set.</span>

In fact, the software&#x27;s website is currently blocked by ISPs in Spain, which is completely unjustified according to Ace Stream&#x27;s management.

                              <span>Despite broad public protests, Cloudflare initially declined to cut its ties with Kiwi Farms. When death threats came into play, the company quickly changed its position. The removal of Kiwi Farms will likely increase calls for voluntary curation of the web, and may reach way beyond Cloudflare. Domain registrars, registries, and ISPs may actually be better targets.

These are where you&#x27;ll send your handheld PC if it develops a problem, either so Valve can fix it free-of-charge if it&#x27;s still under warranty, or so they can diagnose the problem and quote you a repair price if it&#x27;s not. &quot;If your dog gnaws on your thumbstick and breaks it, this is not covered by warranty,&quot; say Valve.

                              <span>Before announcing a bazillion Assassin&#x27;s Creed games during tonight&#x27;s Ubisoft Forward stream, the publisher did first show a handful of other games. Among them was a first look at The Division: Heartland, a free-to-play spin-off from the Clancyverse shooter, which was described as an &quot;action survival shooter.&quot; You can watch it below.

                              <span>As was leaked, and then hurriedly confirmed by Ubisoft about a week ago, the next Assassin&#x27;s Creed game to come out will be Mirage, in 2023. It&#x27;s not going to be quite the massive open world adventure &#x27;em up that the last few entries have been (don&#x27;t worry; one of those is on the way as well), but a more classic AssCreed experience to mark the series&#x27; 15th anniversary. This milestone has made me realise that the Creedsperience has taken up almost half of my current lifespan. Or, to put it another way, I fear that playing Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage may induce a pathetic but very real existential crisis in me.

                              <span>A not-insignificant part of the Ubisoft Forward livestream tonight was dedicated to Assassin&#x27;s Creed. To celebrate the doughty action-adventure&#x27;s 15th anniversary, senior community developer Alice Terrett was joined by a, to his credit, very excited Danny &quot;it&#x27;s the Daddy&quot; Wallace, to lay out an almost MCU-like timeline of every Assassin&#x27;s Creed thing happening for the next good while. It includes new DLC for Valhalla, and a mysterious horror-ish tease. But top of the list, after next year&#x27;s more trad and compact Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage, is Assassin&#x27;s Creed: Codename Red, the next big flagship open-world RPG for the series. And it&#x27;s set in feudal Japan.

                              <span>About a year ago we learned about the existence of something called Assassin&#x27;s Creed Infinity (or, more precisely, Project Infinity, but we&#x27;re all just calling it Infinity). The suggestion that Assassin&#x27;s Creed might become a live service online game akin to Fortnite was quite upsetting to me. Thankfully, VP executive producer on Assassin&#x27;s Creed Marc-Alexis Côté (aka MAC) appeared on tonight&#x27;s Ubisoft Forward livestream to explain more about Infinity, and I am slightly less alarmed but no less confused. Rather than a game, MAC says that Infinity is &quot;going to be the single entry point for our fans into the Assassin&#x27;s Creed franchise in the future&quot;.

As you may have guessed from the title of this post, it&#x27;s also on sale at Amazon for a very reasonable price: £59 gets you a 500GB model compared to a UK RRP of £101.

I don&#x27;t miss those 5am sunrises either. So we can surely all agree that the sensible course of action would be to lock sunrise to 7:30am and rotate the whole clock around that. Anyway!

                              <span>To divert people away from piracy, legal streaming services warn of the unreliability of illegal streaming sites. But for the third time in a matter of weeks, football fans have been unable to watch key matches due to legal platforms falling over. As one fan wrote on Twitter: if I pay for a legal service that doesn&#x27;t work and can find a pirate stream in less than a minute, why am I paying?
From: TF, for the latest news on copyright battles, piracy and more.</span>

Here&#x27;s Every Assassin&#x27;s Creed Announcement
Let&#x27;s take it from the top, shall we? 
Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage
This game was officially revealed last week following extensive leaks, and as expected, Ubisoft had a lot more to share about it during today&#x27;s Ubisoft Forward showcase. Basim Ibn Ishaq, the master assassin from Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla, is taking the lead role this time, but he&#x27;ll be much younger. This game follows his journey from a thief on the luscious and diverse streets of Golden Age Baghdad in 861 to an apprentice of the Hidden Ones to a master assassin. It also represents a return to the series&#x27; roo…</span>

As expected, Ubisoft revealed a lot more about Mirage during today&#x27;s Ubisoft Forward showcase, including the game&#x27;s protagonist, setting, and more. 
If you&#x27;ve been paying attention to leaks and rumors, you likely already had a good idea of what Mirage will be, doubly so after today&#x27;s presentation. Basim Ibn Ishaq, the master assassin from Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla, is in the lead role this time around. However, he&#x27;s not the polished warrior you might remember him as because Mirage takes place years before Valhalla. In this game, he&#x27;s a young thief, and his playground is the luscious and diverse streets of Baghdad, Iraq. Set in 861, a period when Baghdad was the epicenter …</span>

                              <span>Ubisoft and Netflix have announced an expansion of their partnership that was first announced in 2020 with a live-action Assassin&#x27;s Creed series that is still on the way and the Rabbids Invasion: Mission to Mars movie that arrived on the service earlier this year. Today, we learned that Netflix subscribers will have exclusive access to three upcoming Ubisoft mobile games as a part of their existing memberships, with no ads or microtransactions. This announcement comes as Netflix prepares to enter the gaming space with its first releases later this year.
First up, is a sequel to Valiant Hearts, a World War I puzzle-adventure. This new title is in development by the team behind the first game and will bring a new story exclusively to Netflix members in January 2023. That same year, a sequel to Mighty Quest, the roguelite hack and slash, will arrive for subscribers. Finally, Ubisoft is currently working on a new, original Assassin&#x27;s Creed mobile title, which, again, will be available exclusively to Netflix subscribers.
In addition to the Assassin&#x27;s Creed live-action series, Ubisoft and Netflix are currently collaborating on three animated series: Captain Laserhawk: Blood Dragon Remix, Far Cry, and Splinter Cell. While Netflix is set to enter the games industry later this year, we&#x27;ll have to wait until at least next year to experience these three new mobile titles for Netflix subscribers.</span>

                              <span>Huge reveals in video games, movies, and TV are currently unfolding at D23 Expo, Disney&#x27;s annual consumer show held in Anaheim, California. Yesterday we received our first looks at an unnamed Marvel game, a new Tron title, and Mickey Mouse and crew teaming up in a platformer. Today, Marvel and Lucasfilm unloaded a flurry of announcements and trailers for projects hitting in 2022 and beyond.
On the Marvel Cinematic Universe front, we learned Fantastic Four will be directed by Matt Shakman, who worked on Wandavision and It&#x27;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia. Dominique Thorne&#x27;s Ironheart will take on the villain The Hood (brought to life by Anthony Ramos) in the Ironheart Disney Plus series. Sam Wilson&#x27;s first mission as Captain America in New World Order will be against The Leader, with Tim Blake reprising this role 14 years after 2008&#x27;s The Incredible Hulk.
We also learned who the Thunderbolts are in the forthcoming film. The team consists of anti-heroes Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh), Taskmaster (Olga Kurylenko), Valentina (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), Red Guardian (David Harbour), U.S. Agent (Wyatt Russell), Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen, and Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan).
Marvel also treated us to our first looks at Secret Invasion, starring Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury and Emilia Clarke in an unknown role. And in just one month, we can watch the classicly designed horror film Werewolf by Night on Disney Plus. You can see both trailers below.
The Star Wars news is a bit lighter, consisting of our first look at The Mandalorian&#x27;s third season, which looks absolutely bonkers in the best way. We also got a glimpse of the animated anthology Tales of the Jedi, hitting on October 26. The Bad Batch&#x27;s second season hits on January 4, yet no new footage was shown. Andor also received a new trailer for the first season hitting in 11 days. The second season&#x27;s filming is already underway! Again, you can see all of the Star Wars trailers below.

                              <span>During today&#x27;s Ubisoft Forward presentation, the publisher showed off new footage of a boss battle in Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope. The crossover game, which combines the iconic Mushroom Kingdom crew with the zany Rabbids, looks to expand in the first 2017 turn-based tactical game in the series, Kingdom Battle, in myriad ways, including the new Sparks that can add various buffs to the heroes and debuffs to the villains.


This time around, we got a look at battles on a train, including Bowser joining the team. The battle takes place on the train as the crew tries to cleanse an angered Wiggler of corrupted darkness eyes as it runs alongside the train. Ubisoft also announced that it has post-launch plans including free DLC with the third content drop introducing a new playable hero: Rayman.
Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope comes exclusively to Switch on October 20.</span>

                              <span>In the world of Marvel Comics, the word &quot;ensemble&quot; invokes thoughts of the Avengers, X-Men, or Fantastic Four. Recently, we learned Skydance New Media and Marvel Entertainment were working on an ensemble Marvel video game. The internet&#x27;s rumor mill believed this game would focus on Reed Richards and his fantastic family. Yesterday, during the Disney &amp; Marvel Games Showcase, we learned this ensemble wasn&#x27;t Fantastic Four, Avengers, or any known Marvel team whatsoever. Skydance is creating its own team of four heroes, set to the backdrop of World War II.
The timeframe has Captain America front and center fighting against Hydra and Nazi troops. Through a narrative twist, Wakanda gets involved, and players gain control of Black Panther, but not the one you know. This Black Panther is Azzuri, T…</span>

                              <span>As previously announced, Amy Hennig&#x27;s game for Marvel was shown during this evening&#x27;s Disney games showcase. As was leaked, it&#x27;s about Captain America and Black Panther working to fight against Hydra during World War 2. What I didn&#x27;t expect at all was that the game still wouldn&#x27;t have a name, although there are a few other details to glean from the most teasery teaser trailer.

                              <span>For my money, if you want a story about a society set inside a computer, look to ReBoot. But I suppose Tron might satisfy, too. A new visual novel set in the neon universe called Tron: Identity was announced during this evening&#x27;s Disney &amp; Marvel games showcase, and it&#x27;s being developed by Bithell Games. There&#x27;s a very brief teaser trailer below.

Also, player-built factories, and several other features which should make players focused on the logistics of warfare very happy. There&#x27;s a new trailer below ahead of its release on September 28th.

Like everything, it&#x27;s also a roguelike, but it&#x27;s transparent and fair enough that I can reluctantly forgive that too, not least because I&#x27;ve found myself enjoying this one the more it went on. It&#x27;s a lighter, cheerier sibling of Into The Breach that&#x27;s half tactical fighter, half puzzler, and its default difficulty setting is close to perfect if you&#x27;re looking for something less intense that will still catch you out now and then.

This time, it&#x27;s an honest-to-goodness RPG, full of skill checks, strange solutions, multiple endings, and so very many dice. And it&#x27;s great. And it has a demo.

                              <span>Despite lamenting the other week that the rest of 2022&#x27;s gaming calendar was looking a bit weak sauce after endless delay announcements, September is shaping up to be an absolutely monster month for indie releases right now. As Alice Bee noted earlier in the week, there are just too many cool, interesting games coming out for us to review effectively on the site at the moment (although rest assured, we will do our darnedest to cover as many of them as we can).
Part of the challenge is working out what&#x27;s worth reviewing, and what we think is worth highlighting for you, our readers. The other part, though, is often entirely selfish on our part, just playing and writing about cool games we like. In fact, the decision to review many of the games we covered this week - Railbound, Jack Move and Roadwarden - were all down to having played and liked some form of demo, making events like the Steam Next Fest an increasingly invaluable tool in helping us cut through the noise when we inevitably enter mega months like September.

                              <span>Overwatch 2 won’t be locking new heroes behind a paid battle pass, it’s emerged. Blizzard VP Jon Spector confirmed that heroes will be available through a free track for the battle pass. Spector’s comments were an attempt to put an end to speculation over what he described as “incomplete info” circulating online about Overwatch 2’s battle pass.

The game is alleged to star national superheroes Captain America and Wakanda’s Black Panther, and take place during World War 2. Skydance’s project is being headed up by former Uncharted director Amy Hennig, helmer of such unfortunately cancelled projects as Visceral&#x27;s Star Wars action-adventure.

Monsters, Inc. is represented with its own themed course that takes players throughout the corporate office and the department of doors. We also got to see Mike Wazowski, Randall, and Celia behind the wheel as playable racers, joining the previously announced Sulley, Mickey Mouse, Mulan, and Jack Sparrow. 


Disney Speestorm still has no release window, but it’s slated to launch on Switch and PC.</span>

                              <span>During today&#x27;s Disney &amp; Marvel Games Showcase at the D23 Expo, we got a look at the first game from Skydance New Media. While we didn&#x27;t get a name or release date, we did get a cinematic trailer from which we can try to extract information. The biggest news right out of the gate is that this game stars Black Panther, Captain America, and two additional heroes.
This new triple-A game takes place during World War II. As the camera pans over a table covered with things like a brochure for Paris and a flyer for a jazz performance, the items quickly take a turn for the insidious with things like a dagger, a pistol, documents, a hat featuring the Hydra insignia, and, finally, Captain America&#x27;s iconic shield scratched by what appears to be claws.


This narrative-driven ensemble game stars Captai…</span>

                              <span>Gargoyles is back! Well, sort of. The 1995 Sega Genesis side-scroller based on the beloved 90’s animated series is getting the remaster treatment, bringing Goliath and his team (much to their chagrin) back into the spotlight.
Unfortunately, the reveal didn’t come alongside a trailer, a list of platforms, or a release window. However, it sounds like we should expect a similar treatment that the Disney Classics Games Collection received. Those games were enhanced with high-res graphics, a rewind ability, a level skip, and art galleries showcasing concept sketches and other historical goodies. 
You can see the announcement at the 12:33 mark.</span>

The gameplay trailer offers a montage of tactical card-based combat, as well as choice-driven relationship building. Give it a watch below. 


We also got word that a series of animated shorts serve as a prequel to the game’s plot. The first episode arrives on October 31 on Marvel&#x27;s YouTube channel.


Firaxis previously announced Marvel’s Midnight Suns will have a staggered launch, so the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC versions will launch on December 2. Meanwhile, the Switch and last-gen versions hit sometime later.</span>

                              <span>Disney and Bithell Games have revealed Tron Identity, a new PC game coming to Steam sometime next year. 
This reveal kicked off today&#x27;s Disney and Marvel Games Showcase, a first for the company. Unfortunately for those looking for more information about the game, the reveal trailer falls more in line with being a &quot;teaser&quot; than anything else. It does feature the Identity Disc, which is typically used for combat in the Tron world, but that&#x27;s about it. However, in an interview after the showcase, Bithell Games&#x27; Mike Bithell said the game takes place &quot;in a world where Flynn created an Ark, where Flynn created a second grid for them to go to, promising that he&#x27;d come back.&quot;


&quot;As we know from [2010&#x27;s Tron: Legacy], though, he didn&#x27;t,&quot; Bithell continued. &quot;Tron fans will also know that time moves…</span>

                              <span>Marvel announced Marvel Snap, a new free-to-play collectible card game for PC and mobile devices developed by Nuverse and Second Dinner, earlier this year. Now, thanks to a new trailer released during today&#x27;s Disney and Marvel Games Showcase. 
The trailer also showcases roughly a minute of new gameplay, which reveals more about the strategy card game. It looks quite dynamic, with plenty of fun animations to accompany your card&#x27;s individual moves.
Check it out for yourself below: 


As you can see, Marvel Snap is set to hit PC, iOS, and Android devices next month, on Oct. 18. 
&quot;The adrenaline-pumping, superpowered card battler lets fans assemble their Marvel dream team of heroes and villains and then battle their way through the multiverse to glory – all in just three-minute play sessions,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;Marvel Snap is super easy to learn, but will take a lifetime for even the best of players to master. Nuverse and Second Dinner also released the game&#x27;s pre-registration page today, where players can sign up to get the latest information on the game and snap it up the moment it launches on October 18.&quot;

                              <span>Disney and DLaLa Studios have revealed Disney&#x27;s Illusion Island, a 2D platformer starring Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Donald, and of course, Goofy. 
Revealed during today&#x27;s Disney and Marvel Games Showcase, Illusion Island looks a lot like Disney&#x27;s Mickey Mouse show that consists of various shorts starring original Disney characters like, well, Mickey and all of his friends. 


It seems that in Illusion Island, we&#x27;ll be controlling Mickey, Minnie, Donald, and Goofy based on what obstacles might be in our way. Mickey, for example, seems to be able to bounce off of walls, whereas Minnie has a grapple hook-like rope useful for clearing large gaps. Donald can swim – duh – and Goofy uses condiments (it kind of looked like mustard, but it might also be paint) to float and bounce above the stage below. 

All of it looks like good fun, but it&#x27;s not all smiles and happiness on Illusion Island. That&#x27;s because our heroes must endure three trials to retrieve the coveted Book of Knowledge. We&#x27;ll learn exactly what those trials are when Disney&#x27;s Illusion Island hits Switch exclusively next year.</span>

Ooblets offers a smile-inducing amalgamation of monster collecting, farming simulation, and relationship building. However, this delightful chill pill becomes tougher to swallow thanks to a tedious, grind-heavy progression that tests your patience in less enjoyable ways.  
The adventure whisks players to Badgetown, a quirky village where residents harmoniously live alongside Pokémon-esque creatures called Ooblets. Despite your newcomer status, the townsfolks turn to you to restore the city to its former glory. That involves tasks s…</span>

                              <span>Following the rocky and bug-filled launch of Battlefield 2042 last year, EA announced that Respawn’s Vince Zampella was named as the head of the Battlefield franchise amidst wider franchise changes that include the creation of a Battlefield universe. Then, a few months later, EA announced that its next Battlefield game had entered pre-production using “valuable lessons” learned from Battlefield 2042. 
While exactly what the next Battlefield game is remains confirmed, a new Battlefield-centric blog post from chief experience officer of EA Byron Beede and the Battlefield team sheds new light on a possibility. The next game might be a narrative-focused one set in the Battlefield universe. 
“Many of you know that Marcus Lehto joined the team earlier this year,” the blog post reads. “Today, we announced the name of his new Seattle-based studio, Ridgeline Games. Marcus will bring his long legacy of creating fascinating worlds and gripping narratives to Battlefield. Backed by a world-class team, he’ll be leading the charge to develop a narrative campaign set in the Battlefield universe that will engage fans in new and exciting ways while remaining true to the classic elements of the series.” 
As you can see, the blog post doesn’t indicate that Lehto’s narrative game is the next Battlefield, but it’s a possibility, as is a new multiplayer-focused project like Battlefield 2042. Only time will tell. 
There’s a lot more in the blog post, including the announcement that creative director Lars Gustavsson, who has been with the franchise since its start more than two decades ago, is leaving EA, so be sure to head there to get the full rundown.

                              <span>This April, a coalition of entertainment companies convinced a judge to sign a pirate site blocking injunction that affected every ISP in the United States. This document was later found to be unenforceable but it was public access to court records that first pushed it into the public eye. As the case enters a new phase to block more domains, a level of secrecy had been requested by the plaintiffs.

                              <span>Eidos Montreal, the studio behind recent Thief and Deus Ex games, say they are &quot;now the owner of the games [we] developed, like the Deus Ex and Thief games.&quot; Likewise, Crystal Dynamics say they have taken &quot;control&quot; of its Tomb Raider and Legacy Of Kain games from their previous owner, Square Enix.

Which sounds like a big deal, but really both studios are just reporting a change to their terms of service and privacy notices since they were bought by Embracer Group last month.

                              <span>Do you ever feel like you&#x27;re sitting down with a game like a worried parent, saying &quot;I just don&#x27;t know what to do with you?&quot; Because that&#x27;s how I feel about Phoenix Point after the last few months of playing it on and off. I’ve definitely enjoyed it more than on its release in 2019, and its DLC adds more to think about and manage during what were once long lull periods. There&#x27;s a lot to like about its final form. There&#x27;s also a lot to... I don&#x27;t quite want to say hate, but I&#x27;m also not quite sure why. It&#x27;s one of the most evenly mixed bags I&#x27;ve ever rummaged around in.

AGDQ 2023 had originally been planned to take place in Florida, but that’s scrapped due to the state’s attitudes towards COVID-19 and LGBTQ+ people.

Not to worry, though, as myself and Nate are ever ready to hold down the fort. This week we&#x27;re talking about our favourite cinematics in video games, a fitting subject because last weekend I saw the greatest piece of cinema yet conceived by man: Michael Flatley&#x27;s Blackbird.
I do spend quite a lot of time explaining Blackbird to Nate, but after that we do talk about some cutscenes and cinematics in games (as well as litigating the difference between the two, and Nate tries to remember the first time he saw a cutscene in a game that was in-engine rather than being pre-rendered). And today the Cavern Of Lies is a Cavern Of Justice, after we received a troubling missive from one [squints] Brond Coatwear?

                              <span>I saw a panel of thriller authors a couple of months back and one of them made reference to &quot;the fat chapter&quot;, and the others all went &quot;Ohhhh, yes, the fat chapter!&quot;. Thriller writers deal in short, snappy chapters, and the fat chapter is the one that ends up getting a load of events or exposition shoved into it, somewhere in the second half, because they wouldn&#x27;t fit anywhere else. Every year in games there&#x27;s a fat month, where loads of games come out and loads of them look really good and there is never enough time godammit.
This year that month is September. There are so many games out this month that look so much my jam that I want to spread &#x27;em on my morning toast, but September is also the month that a lot of RPS staff have holiday booked - including me, for two weeks, which means that if these games do get reviewed it probably won&#x27;t be by me. But know that I have my beady little eyes on &#x27;em.

                              <span>Temtem’s inspiration has always been clear. We didn’t beat around the bush when it entered early access back in 2020 - Cian Maher called it the best Pokemon game in years - and I won’t beat around the bush now. It’s still the best Pokemon game in years. It borrows so much from Nintendo&#x27;s behemoth, but it also takes some much-needed lessons that Game Freak fails to recognise, taking the formula to its highest evolution yet.

                              <span>Monster-taming MMO Temtem just launched out of early access on PC earlier this week, but developers Crema have taken to Discord to defend the game’s paid battle pass. Some players have been getting themselves very worked up over the inclusion of a paid pass in a full-priced game. Yet there’s been a plan to include a battle pass in Temtem for years. Check out the game’s launch trailer below while you wrap your head around it all.

                              <span>It cannot be a coincidence that 1997 is a pivotal year in the world of Jack Move. In the game, it&#x27;s the year everything went dark in this turn-based Japanese-style RPG, with a solar storm biffing the world&#x27;s electronics. It threw the world into chaos, giving rise to the megacorps that now control the dystopian cyberpunk society where our heroine Noa is trying to make a living. In the real world, of course, 1997 was the year Final Fantasy VII came out, the seminal JRPG that Jack Move owes a great deal to (right down to its menu plink plink sound). Developers So Romantic have said outright that it&#x27;s been one of the main inspirations for Jack Move, and its shady corporate powers and grungy urban landscape certainly feel of a piece with ShinRa&#x27;s grip on the city of Midgar. 
But the bigwigs at MonoMind aren&#x27;t out to poison the world and suck the life from it in Jack Move. Instead, they&#x27;re more concerned with using their newfound technological powers to find eternal life – a classic &#x27;upload your mind to the metaverse&#x27; kind of tale you&#x27;ll probably recognise if you&#x27;ve read any of the cyberpunk 101 novels such as William Gibson&#x27;s Neuromancer or Permutation City by Greg Egan. Jack Move&#x27;s story doesn&#x27;t tread any new ground in this respect, but Noa and her hacker pal Ryder are a fiery spirited pair that make this six-hour tale of espionage and rebellion against its cartoonish villain well worth dipping into. Yes, you read that correctly. A JRPG you can polish off in a single day of play. Bliss.

They&#x27;ll be teaming up on Steam later this month on September 26th. Check out the trailer below.

                              <span>I keep thinking about Roadwarden like a tourist city that I visited for not quite long enough. Sure, I saw the main sights and had a great time soaking in the ambiance, but I know that I missed so many hidden gems. I want to go back and explore, maybe this time with a local guide who knows its secrets.
At its most basic, Roadwarden is a text-based RPG. You play as the titular roadwarden, who sets out from the city to investigate an unmapped peninsula with little more than their horse for company. Your goal as set by the people who sent you is to investigate the region and report your findings in preparation for the expansion of trade guilds in the area. But you can also set your own goal, shaping your character’s approach from the start in a way that helps with roleplaying a particular kind of adventurer throughout. And once you get to that adventuring, dozens of sidequests open up covering everything from gathering fruit to curing the plague.

                              <span>Every corner of Skyrim houses a locked chest, but where are all the keys? Only a handful actually have keys to open them. So do the chest&#x27;s owners lockpick them every time they want an apple or knife? Are these chests merely decorative, their contents deemed inaccessible and long forgotten? A new mod for Skyrim Special Edition answers this playfully by adding a load of hidden keys to unlock these chests. Some of the keys look quite well hidden in this object hunt, so you&#x27;ll need to poke around, rummage, and turn things over.

                              <span>When we last saw Amicia and Hugo de Rune at the end of A Plague Tale: Innocence back in 2019, things were looking up for the orphaned rat wranglers. They&#x27;d escaped the clutches of the French Inquisition and the hordes of plague rats following in their wake, and the pair were hopeful about finding a cure for the cursed macula flowing through Hugo&#x27;s veins.
Alas, when I pick up their journey in chapter six of Asobo&#x27;s upcoming sequel, A Plague Tale: Requiem, Amicia is having a particularly terrible time of it. Not only is she suffering from an open head wound, leaving her unsteady on her feet, but rumours are flying in the nearby pilgrim camp about something bad having gone down in the last city they passed through. Exactly what is hard to say with five chapters&#x27; worth of context missing from my preview build, but the pack of guards who are hot on the siblings&#x27; trail quickly make it plain: several men died back in that city, and they&#x27;re pointing the finger squarely at Amicia&#x27;s knife, slingshot and crossbow.

                              <span>Razer&#x27;s Viper Ultimate is one of my all-time favourite gaming mice - and now it&#x27;s a massive 72% off at Amazon UK. That brings it to £48, an incredible deal for an ultralight mouse with optical switches, an ambidextrous design and HyperSpeed wireless. You even get a free wireless charging dock with it - what&#x27;s not to like?

It contains $660 worth of games from the publisher, including series like Borderlands, XCOM, Civilization and Bioshock, for $16 (or the equivalent in your local currency, this is a local sale). That&#x27;s a reasonable price for even one of these games, let alone the 18 games included in this bundle.

Above all, a deeper level of customization lets players fine-tune their own wintry apocalypse. PlayStation enthusiasts might recognize the phrase “Play has no limits” from a string of ads. Ragnarök’s lead UX designer, Mila Pavlin, echoed the same sentiments and voiced her dedication to centering players of all walks of life. “This is a fantasy epic,” Pavlin says. “This is about a father and son. This is about fate and the Nine Realms. And the ability to go into that, regardless of your background, and be able to experience all this rich detail and history and story? That drives me every day.”

                              <span>All of the new heroes coming to Overwatch 2 will not be immediately playable at launch, and that&#x27;s because you&#x27;ll need to unlock them on the free track of the game&#x27;s battle pass. 
Overwatch commercial leader and vice president of Blizzard Jon Spector revealed this on Twitter last night following leaks and rumors that stated the new heroes would need to be unlocked in the battle pass, which is a paid premium pass that rewards players for leveling up through it akin to passes seen in Fortnite and other games. That&#x27;s partly true in that yes, new heroes will need to be unlocked through the battle pass but Spector clarified on Twitter that those heroes will be on the free track of the battle pass. 
&quot;Addressing some incomplete info posted early about our Overwatch 2 Battle Pass – we&#x27;ll be sharing all details ahead of launch, but want to confirm that new Overwatch 2 heroes will be available on the free track of the Battle Pass.&quot;

As you can see, you won&#x27;t need to pay any money to unlock the new heroes in Overwatch 2. However, it could still take some time to unlock these heroes depending on where they are on the free track. Only time will tell but fortunately, we don&#x27;t have to wait too much longer to find out because Overwatch 2 is out Oct. 4. 
In the meantime, read about how Xbox boss Phil Spencer says Overwatch will come to Xbox Game Pass and then check out why we think Overwatch 2 feels like a completely different game. Read about how cross-progression is coming to Overwatch 2 after that.

This followed reports that stated the cancelation was due to contract negotiations surrounding the franchise following Tencent&#x27;s acquisition of Leyou Technologies Holdings Ltd., a company Amazon Games was working with on this game. Amazon Games president Christoph Hartmann recently shed light on this series of events in a new interview with GameSpot, citing that things got &quot;very complicated&quot; following the acquisition.

                              <span>The Hitman games are often good and usually fun, it’s fair to say, particularly the recent World Of Assassination trilogy. Ian Hitman’s turn in the two films released about his adventures has been rougher to recommend, though. That’s why it’s simultaneously disappointing and awesome to learn that Guardians Of The Galaxy, The Suicide Squad and – shudder – Slither director James Gunn narrowly missed his target when he pitched a Hitman movie.

                              <span>Third person skater shooter Rollerdrome has some really cool weapons, but what is it that makes them so special? I mean, there’s only four of them, and you’re forced to constantly perform tricks to regain ammo, which doesn&#x27;t make them easy to use. I think it’s because of their more literal significance in the game. Rollerdrome threatens you with multiple enemy types called Houseplayers, all formidable, especially in the heat of battle when they combine their efforts. Luckily, the four distinct weapons you’re equipped with act as an equaliser; each weapon is a solution for a particular enemy. Developers Roll7 could have easily added a bunch of copied and pasted guns from every generic shooter, but instead they were more intentional about the weapons they included, with each weapon complimenting the gunplay and the game as a whole.

                              <span>Red Dead Redemption 2 now has official FSR 2.0 support, as of the just-released 1.31 update. This makes Rockstar’s cowboy epic/improvised teleconferencing software the latest game to work with AMD’s upscaler without mods; an unofficial FSR patch for RDR2 has been out for a while, but this update should make it even easier to simply enable or disable FSR in the settings menu. Alongside its rival, Nvidia DLSS, which Rockstar also added last year.

The deal will see Tencent bring some of Ubisoft’s most well known game series to mobile, and to PC in China. Tencent’s investment in Guillemot Brothers Limited follows speculation last month that they were looking to take out a bigger stake in Ubisoft, even becoming the single largest shareholders.

                              <span>I&#x27;m an enormous fan of the premise of Steelrising (which is good, because enormous fans are also a weapon in it). In it, we&#x27;re whisked to an alternative history where King Louis XVI stopped the French Revolution before it properly got going by, err, killing everyone with steampunk robots. You&#x27;re Aegis, a feminine robot created to entertain and protect Queen Marie Antoinette. Marie, safe outside Paris but somewhat peeved at her husband&#x27;s new penchant for extreme mass murder, sends you on a Soulslike mission to sort it all out.
This takes some doing, but luckily Aegis is a very advanced robot, the bestest of all the robots. Slight but adaptive with it, and even having an advanced AI, Aegis can carve a swift path through the more than usually twisted metal in her way. It&#x27;s a bit too easy, in fact.

Unnamed sources have supposedly told TryHardGuides that three new AC games will be announced during the event, with an instalment set in feudal Japan being among them. Bloomberg backs up the report, stating that the other games purported to be in development include one set in the 16th century that could be dealing with witches, and a mobile game set in China.

                              <span>The AMD Ryzen 5 5600 is a cheaper, better-value version of the Ryzen 5600X - the CPU took the world by storm when Ryzen 5000 launched back in 2020. With six cores and 12 threads to access, you get good performance in modern game engines, while the higher single-core speeds introduced with this generation of AMD processors allows for better performance in single-core-limited (often older) games. It&#x27;s a potent combination that makes the 5600X - and the 5600 - the best value AMD CPUs for gaming out there. 
Normally the 5600 retails for £173, in comparison to £185 for the 5600X, but today it&#x27;s down to £150 on Amazon, coming within £10 of the best price we&#x27;ve ever seen on this model.

Not until I saw several scrunching up, pretending to be the eyes, nose and mouth of someone’s face in images from upcoming psychological horror card game Out Of Hands. See, Out Of Hands has a slight fixation on the ol’ phalanges. Witness for yourself in the trailer below.

In addition to millions in damages, the plaintiffs demand user disconnections and pirate site blockades.

                              <span>In a new Night City Wire tonight, CD Project Red played the strongest card they have in their Cyberpunk 2077 deck, that being Keanu &quot;Nicest Guy In Hollywood&quot; Reeves. America&#x27;s bad-ass actor dad played semi-imaginary rock anarchist (I know I&#x27;m being reductive, don&#x27;t leave comments) Johnny Silverhand in the main game, and he popped up to confirm he&#x27;s back for 2023&#x27;s expansion - which we now know is officially called Phantom Liberty.
There&#x27;s also the Edgerunner update dropping today, a tie-in for the Netflix anime Edgrunners (more info on that was also revealed tonight), and free-to-play mini game featuring Roach the horse, because we all like Roach the horse.

I don’t think I’ve ever built one on the back of a giant animal after the apocalypse, though. Indie sci-fi citybuilder The Wandering Village will let me do that when it enters early access on Steam on September 14th. See the great lumbering beast for yourself by watching the trailer below.

I got a sneaky early peek at Lucid behind closed doors at PAX East earlier this year, and let me tell you, its gorgeous pixel art and emphasis on air dashing through crystalline barriers with a honking great axe looks rad as hell.

I&#x27;m planning road and neighbourhood layouts to optimise movement and happiness. I&#x27;m planning defences to fend off bandits. But most of my thought is going on farming, planning my crop rotations to optimise fertility and yields. Finally, I have a use for everything school taught me about the three-field system and the nitrogen cycle.

Footage from the build was shared by Reddit user Parzalai, who said they had been banned from their EA account for leaking a previous build. Modders have been running their own multiplayer servers based on leaked builds of skate. for months, so it’s not surprising to see further leaks spring up from the game’s playtests.

                              <span>The sight of a two-carriage train is normally something that prompts a deep sigh of despair from me in real life. Nine times out of ten, it&#x27;s a sign that something&#x27;s gone wrong further up the line - that someone, somewhere, has sent out a train with half its usual number of carriages, and is therefore destined to ruin everyone&#x27;s day in the process by cramming us all in like a pack of sardines. 
In Afterburn&#x27;s adorable train puzzler Railbound, however, two carriages are a cause for celebration. In a game that&#x27;s about guiding numbered compartments onto the back of an engine (using a limited number of track tiles to get them there in the right order), two-carriage puzzles offer the perfect amount of cerebral head-scratching. They&#x27;ve got a bit more bite than simply guiding a single carriage to its destination, but they&#x27;re not so complicated that they&#x27;ll repeatedly make you reach for the hint button to help you fill in the gaps. Railbound has a tendency to be a bit too abstract in its later stages, but more on that in a sec. All you need to know right now is that there are plenty of smart ideas to wrap your head around here, and that you&#x27;ll be grinning from ear to ear by the time you reach the end of the line.

                              <span>As PC setups are carefully packed away and booths are dismantled, the curtain closes on another PAX West and it&#x27;s time to say goodbye to Seattle (for now anyway). After four packed days of demos, panels, interviews, and lots of fruit smoothies, Liam and I are completely PAXed out, but we&#x27;re not done quite yet.
Below you&#x27;ll find something a little different from our usual daily round-ups. For our last day at PAX, we&#x27;ve done a super, uber, mega round-up on the entire event. We list off our favourite panel moments, the best game demos we played, and our general opinion on how the overall convention went. Click play below to see one of our last videos from the event:

                              <span>The Elgato Stream Deck MK.2 is a kind of funny thing, a little plastic box with 15 plastic buttons. Each button has a tiny screen behind it, and when pressed can do any number of things - launching a program, changing to a new scene in a stream, adjusting your media volume, muting a microphone or sending out an alert. It&#x27;s ideal for automation, giving you an easy way to trigger scripts or shortcuts that speed up the dreary parts of your job or your favourite game, and of course for game streamers it&#x27;s invaluable. The MK.2 model normally costs £139, but today at Currys you can pick one up for £97 using the code GAMING30.

                              <span>BioShock Remastered, BioShock 2 Remastered and BioShock Infinite have all fallen afoul of some questionably titled “quality of life” updates that publishers 2K Games released last week. These updates added a new 2K Launcher to all three BioShocks that appears when booting them up from Steam, but as found by GamingOnLinux, something about this launcher doesn’t take kindly to Linux-based operating systems. Linux-based operating systems like the Steam Deck’s SteamOS.


As it happens, then, there&#x27;s a chance – if you’re trying to play on Valve’s handheld PC – that all these updates will do is swing a bloodied 9-iron into the Deck’s ability to launch the affected games at all. Whoopsie doodle.

These far-reaching measures apply to a movie that hasn&#x27;t yet been released and hasn&#x27;t been pirated either.

                              <span>Soldier Boyz is the newest supported game of the Hypno engine, and it’s ready for public testing!
Released in 1997 by Hypnotix and published by DreamCatcher Interactive and MCPA Interactive, this full-motion rail shooter is based on the 1995 film of the same name. The game starts when the daughter of an American billionaire is kidnapped by a group of Vietnamese terrorists. Then, it’s up to Major Howard Toliver, ex-Marine and highly decorated Vietnam veteran, to gather a deadly team for the dangerous mission of rescuing her. He recruits six prison inmates serving life sentences for a chance at a full presidential pardon.
Keep the body count rising to survive five territories by playing as each Soldier Boy (and Girl),
but beware and don’t waste a “friendly” since they provide vital survival information!
ScummVM currently supports the English release of the game (which is the only one we know about) and features more responsive controls than the original. We couldn&#x27;t find a demo but there is a trailer. Please contact us if you have a demo or any other release.
To play the game with ScummVM, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.
