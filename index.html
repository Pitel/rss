                              <span>God of War: Ragnarök’s Valhalla DLC packs a lot of story into Kratos and Mimir’s roguelike journey through the titular hall of heroes. With Santa Monica Studio framing the sequel as the end of the series’ Norse mythology arc, there’s been a lingering question of what’s next for Kratos, his son Atreus, and the God of…

                              <span>If you’re looking forward to playing Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League, especially to experience its story, your time on the internet just got a little bit harder. Some big plot points have leaked online, and naturally, developer Rocksteady isn’t happy.
Apparently, the leaks stem from a closed beta test in which audio from a pivotal story cutscene plus images and video showing yet-to-be-revealed characters got out in the wild. We won’t share the details, but they’re not hard to find, so you’re on your own if you want to know more. We just ask that you refrain from posting any spoilers in the comments out of respect for others who wish to remain in the dark.
Rocksteady has posted a statement on its X account addressing the leaks, which we&#x27;ve posted in full below. 
It’s always a bummer to see leaks like this happen, and with Suicide Squad still two months away from launch, interested players who want to be surprised have several weeks of dodging spoilers before they can see the story for themselves. 
Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League takes place several years after the end of Batman: Arkham Knight and stars Harley Quinn, Deadshot, Captain Boomerang, and King Shark, tasked with defending Earth from a brainwashed Justice League, courtesy of Brainiac. The cooperative open-world adventure has received a lot of vitriol from fans for its shooter-based gameplay, always-online requirement, and live service elements, such as its battle pass.

Over the last week, PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo have each released their annual player year-in-reviews, letting users find out exactly how much time they spent engaged with each platform, the games they played most, and more. PC players on Steam can now do the same, as Valve has released its year in review. 
You can access the review here (you&#x27;ll need to sign into your Steam account, of course). You&#x27;ll find the expected stats, such as the top batch of games you spent the most time playing, your average playtime per month, and even metrics like time spent playing on a mouse/keyboard versus a controller. In a nice bit of convenience, you can export your stats graphic in different sizes to fit whatever social media site you plan on sharing it on. Here&#x27;s what the tall ve…</span>

                              <span>James McCaffrey, actor best known to video game fans as the voice of Max Payne, among other characters, has passed away. He was 65.
TMZ reports that McCaffrey died on Sunday after a battle with multiple myeloma, a form of cancer. A rep for McCaffrey tells the outlet that the actor died surrounded by friends and family.
McCaffrey&#x27;s extensive on-screen credits include roles in Law &amp; Order, Suits, and Blue Bloods, and video games such as 2008’s Alone in the Dark and 2005’s Area 51. However, Remedy fans knew him best as the voice of Max Payne in all three entries. Furthermore, McCaffrey voiced Thomas Zane in Alan Wake, Zachariah Trench in Control, and, most recently, Alex Casey in Alan Wake 2.
We are deeply saddened to hear about the passing of our beloved friend and collaborator James McCaffrey, the iconic voice of Max Payne and Alex Casey.

In a separate X thread, Remedy creative director Sam Lake offered his condolences as well. 
I’m heartbroken to hear the sad news of James McCaffrey’s passing. We worked together for more than 25 years. He was a lovely man and a dear friend. He was a key part of the Remedy family. He was a brilliant actor. No one could do what he did better than him. (1/2) pic.twitter.com/JLcEIMUT43

                              <span>Sea of Stars took home the award for Best Independent Game at The Game Awards 2023 earlier this month and now, developer Sabotage Studio has revealed the RPG has surpassed 4 million players since launch. Sea of Stars is available on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC, launching back in August, and is free to subscribers on Xbox Game Pass and PC Game Pass, as well as PlayStation Plus&#x27; Extra and Premium subscribers. 
Alongside Sea of Stars&#x27; TGAs win, Sabotage took home the Best Indie Game award at the Golden Joysticks and was recognized by the British Academy Film and Television Awards as one of the best games from 2023. 


&quot;Sea of Stars is the game of my dreams, and seeing its quest resonate so strongly with players and critics means the world to everyone at Sabotage,&quot; studio co-founder and Sea of Stars game director Thierry Boulanger writes in a press release. &quot;The team behind this game is the most talented and dedicated group I could have ever hoped to create Sea of Stars with, and I&#x27;m again reminded of their brilliance as we progress with creating Sea of Stars&#x27; upcoming DLC, Throes of the Watchmaker. 
&quot;For fans to have recognized our adventure in such an incredibly prosperous year for RPGs alongside new arrivals from the genre&#x27;s biggest franchises, we simply just cannot thank you enough for supporting us, and we can&#x27;t wait to show you what&#x27;s next for Sea of Stars.&quot;

                              <span>Netflix has announced that it is remaking the first saga of One Piece, and it&#x27;s doing it with one of the best animation studios out there. 
Over the weekend, Netflix released a minute-and-a-half video celebrating the 25th anniversary of the One Piece anime, revealing in it that Wit Studio, the team behind Spy Family and the first three seasons of Attack on Titan, is producing &quot;an all-new anime adaptation of the One Piece manga starting from the iconic East Blue saga.&quot; It will come to Netflix, although the company hasn&#x27;t said when to expect it. 
Check out the announcement for yourself below: 


Notably, the East Blue saga is the first sage of the One Piece manga and anime, covering 100 chapters and roughly 60 episodes, respectively. This remake, which will be called The One Piece, is an anime adaptation of the manga version of the East Blue saga, meaning it will likely vary from the ongoing One Piece anime. 
Beyond this announcement video, Netflix hasn&#x27;t revealed much else about The One Piece, so casting and its release remain unknown.

Through the Steam application or by signing into the website, you can get a write-up of your year spent on the platform.


Except it won’t tell you your overall time played.


No. What it will tell you is how much of your mysterious overall time has been spent in each game. It will also tell you what your preferred genres are, how many achievements you unlocked, and how much time was spent using a mouse versus a keyboard.


But enough about you, let’s talk about me.

It was actually a narrow competition this year for our newly founded indie game category. Intended as a way to get more independent games involved in the conversations we have at the end of every year, we wound up with an intriguing mix of games.


Chained Echoes was a holdover from last December, but still retained more staying power than most early-year launches. And World of Horror&#x27;s full launch finally arrived, leaving a mark on us. But Lethal Company&#x27;s recent surge seems to be the note we&#x27;re ending 2023 on.

                              <span>Entourage star Kevin Dillon has given us some sad news today. James McCaffrey, known for his role as the voice of the titular character from the Max Payne series has died at 65. TMZ reports that McCaffrey passed away as a result of a battle with multiple myeloma.


McCaffrey first made his debut as a video game voice actor in 2001’s Max Payne. While he stayed close with Remedy, voicing roles in the Alan Wake games and Control, he also acted as Edward Carnby in 2006’s Alone in the Dark reboot. Beyond that, he starred in a number of TV and film roles going back 35 years.


Remedy has also given their condolences, stating, “We are deeply saddened to hear about the passing of our beloved friend and collaborator James McCaffrey, the iconic voice of Max Payne and Alex Casey. His remarkable talent not only gave life to our characters but also left an enduring impact on our community. Our hearts go out to his family in this time of loss.”




While his list of roles in video game voice acting is somewhat short, his impact was massive. As Max, McCaffrey gave life to the character’s melancholic, neo-noir brooding, even providing motion capture animation in Max Payne 3. In the same way I have trouble hearing Batman without the voice of Kevin Conroy, I can’t imagine Max without McCaffrey behind the vocals. This has been a sad year when it comes to who we’ve lost in the industry, both in terms of their contributions to beloved characters and those behind the scenes who make it happen. 


Sam Lake, who provided the face for Max in the first game, perhaps said it best on Twitter: “He was a key part of the Remedy family. He was a brilliant actor. No one could do what he did better than him.”

                              <span>Chris Avellone, the former chief creative officer and co-founder of Fallout: New Vegas developer Obsidian Entertainment, has revealed that the company tried to make an Elder Scrolls game in a similar vein. In a thread confirming an old tweet uncovered by 80 Level, Avellone discussed details about the proposal.




He also compared the idea to the way Infinity Ward and Treyarch handled alternate Call of Duty games during that generation, with Bethesda developing a main game and Obsidian working on something that would offer more Elder Scrolls adventures, like Fallout: New Vegas did for that series. 


According to Avellone, the idea didn&#x27;t gain traction with Bethesda, and he suggests that the Starfield studio wasn&#x27;t happy with the reception that Fallout: New Vegas received, &quot;good and bad.&quot;


Although Fallout: New Vegas has become highly regarded over the years since its release, there was initially some backlash toward the game due to bugs and game breaking issues. 


After years of patches and updates, Fallout: New Vegas has gotten the recognition that it deserves. It&#x27;s disappointing to think of what we could have had if this had ultimately panned out. It has been over a decade since The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim was released, and it doesn&#x27;t look like we&#x27;ll get to play The Elder Scrolls VI anytime soon. 


If only we had an Obsidian-developed Elder Scrolls game to fill the decade plus gap between releases. It seems like Bethesda missed a trick with that one. Maybe Obsidian&#x27;s (remarkably Elder Scrolls looking) fantasy RPG, Avowed, can fill that hole in my heart.

                              <span>Lethal Company has enjoyed enormous success since it launched just a couple of months ago. From smashing its player record not long after releasing to being the top-selling game on Steam (where it still sits), it&#x27;s been quite the journey for indie developer Zeekerss. Now, the title could walk away with one of gaming&#x27;s greatest honors.


The Steam Awards recently revealed the player-voted nominations for this year. With categories such as Labor of Love, Best Game on Steam Deck, Most Innovative Gameplay, and more, there&#x27;s a lot of competition about. However, it&#x27;s seeing Lethal Company up for Game of the Year that&#x27;s most intriguing.




Obviously, we&#x27;re aware of just how successful the release has been, but it says something that it&#x27;s able to go up against the likes of Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 and Resident Evil 4. Those are some elbows Zeekerss&#x27; game is rubbing against, and it&#x27;ll be interesting to see whether it can come out on top against such names.


Something of an underdog story


In a world of AAA flexing and classic releases being given a new lease on life in the form of remakes and remasters, it&#x27;s tough for independent games to stand out. Whether Lethal Company takes the Game of the Year award away or not doesn&#x27;t detract from the fact that it was nominated in the first place.


At the time of writing, it&#x27;s still going strong, and I have – rather ashamedly – still not got round to playing it.


If you want to vote on your favorite in each of the Steam Awards categories, you can do so from December 21 (when the Steam Winter sale begins). Voting will close at 10am PT on January 2, so you&#x27;ve got the holiday period to make your choices.

                              <span>Drip marketing is here for Version 4.4 of Genshin Impact, introducing a playable version of Cloud Retainer and a brand-new character named Gaming.


Xianyun, aka Cloud Retainer


Xianyun appears to be Cloud Retainer in a human disguise. She has an Anemo Vision, though her weapon is still up in the air. Given her design and popularity, it’s hard to imagine that Cloud Retainer will not be a 5-star character. Her Constellation is listed as Grus Serena, which is Latin for “serene crane.”


It’s unknown why Cloud Retainer has decided to live among the humans, but she seems to be getting along well. The residents of Liyue Harbor only have good things to say about her, describing her as a talented artisan with a kind heart. There are those who know her true identity, such as her fellow adepti and…</span>

                              <span>Last week, we witnessed another series of layoffs as Free Radical Design closed its doors. With that reported bombshell coming to fruition, we likely lost the potential for a new TimeSplitters game. However, images appearing to show what-could-have-been have been leaked.


According to a number of posts on Twitter (as spotted by Eurogamer), concept art and early screenshots from the elusive TimeSplitters revival have made an appearance. User @ithedestrxyer shows some character models, while an account called TimeSplitters News &amp; Archives has uploaded general art work.




These have been credited to the now-defunct Free Radical Design, which was the studio that&#x27;s been behind the series since day one. More have been curated on the fandom page, each of which has been given attributes for their respective artists.


Dare to dream


We can&#x27;t say for sure whether these are legitimate images from the game, but if they are, then they certainly act as a tease. With the developer shutting down entirely, the future of TimeSplitters remains uncertain.


The former studio was under the Embracer Group umbrella, so the parent company will likely have to make a decision about whether to revive the dormant franchise going forward.


Of course, with Free Radical now out of the picture, any hope of a brand-new entry will come with the caveat that it won&#x27;t be made by the original creators. Still, a lot of people would love to see TimeSplitters make a comeback and these recent images (if they do belong to the game) could encourage Embracer to continue the project, or maybe even sell it to another company.

                              <span>FromSoftware’s Armored Core 6: Fires of Rubicon has been out since August, but apparently, during all this time, there hasn’t been a way to prove how muscular your mech is. That changes tomorrow (December 19) because ranked matchmaking and leaderboards are coming aboard patch 1.05.


That’s it, that’s all I’ve got. I don’t even have patch note for you. Instead, I’m just going to wheel in the TV, put the trailer on, and take a nap while the class is distracted.




To reiterate what the trailer said, you should:



Conquer new PVP maps.


Personalize your nameplate.


Ascend the leaderboards.


Dominate in ranked matchmaking.



I think those last two are backward.


In addition to the new ranking and leaderboards, you’ll also be getting some new mech parts and maps to use them in.


I haven’t gotten around to playing Armored Core 6. I feel like it came and went pretty quickly. One moment, everyone was writing about how 1997’s Armored Core was actually really good and maybe also had shades of Dark Souls in there. The next, we’ve moved on to the next thing. All I know is that I hesitated on picking a bunch of the series’ games up from my local game store, Armored Core 6 was announced, and then suddenly, all those games were gone. Let that be a lesson to you: always buy things.


Armored Core 6 is available on PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. Patch 1.05 arrives on December 19, 2023.

According to his recent Tweet, his peers, colleagues, and relatives expressed doubts concerning his plan to go independent. It appears that it wasn&#x27;t that they had no faith in his abilities.

                              <span>Od roku 2026 musí veřejná správa vést povinně elektronickou spisovou službu. Už žádné papírové podací deníky. To by dávalo smysl, kdyby se pro elektronické spisové služby cena atestace dle nového standardu nezvýšila téměř sedmkrát. Atestace stávajících systémů na trhu tak bude stát z původních 75 tisíc Kč přesně 489 tisíc Kč. Proč? Protože je náročné prověřit nové (vylepšené) XML standardy pro elektronické spisové služby. Chyby i nejasnosti se řeší v GitHubu. Kdo to zaplatí? Zákazník. Jak to bude fungovat? No musí.</span>

                              <span>Ville Syrjälä z Intelu si všiml, že v ovladačích X11 xf86-video-modesetting je pro HW kurzor alokováno místo 256×256. Pokud se však kurzor vejde například do 64×64, tak na Intel Alderlake klesne spotřeba o 0,5 W. Tak velká hodnota patrně znamená, že se bude muset opravit i něco v samotném ovladači i915. I tak dává smysl pro kurzor alokovat co nejmenší místo.</span>

                              <span>With the new Intel 5th Gen Xeon &quot;Emerald Rapids&quot; processors there is a new feature called the Optimized Power Mode (OPM). This Optimized Power Mode can be enabled via the system BIOS for Emerald Rapids for helping to reduce the CPU power consumption when not running at full utilization. With Intel claiming that up to 110 Watts of server power savings can be conserved when running at 30~40% utilization, I was curious and set out to run my own Optimized Power Mode benchmarks with the Xeon Platinum 8592+ processors. Here is a deep dive on Intel Optimized Power Mode benchmarks.</span>

The festive season is finally upon us and Nintendo&#x27;s European eShops are getting into the spirit of things the only way that they know how — with a festive sale, of course!
This year&#x27;s Festive Offers sale has brought a sack-full of discounts to European Switches and is now depositing them under the eShop tree. These deals won&#x27;t be around for long, however, so you only have until 31st December to grab yourself a bargain.

The Prince of Persia series is held near and dear to the hearts of many, whether you fell in love with the original platformers and their revolutionary rotoscope animation, The Sands of Time for its rewind mechanic and magical atmosphere, or maybe even the reboot from 2008 — which we&#x27;re sad never received a Nintendo release, or a true ending for that matter.
The franchise is back soon with quite a few fun twists in the upcoming Prince of Persia, the Lost Crown, which we&#x27;ve recently been given a pretty in-depth look at. While we were out visiting the Ubisoft office, we also had the chance to pick the brain of Joseph-Antoine Clavet, the cinematic director on this new Prince of Persia.

Sabotage Studio has announced that Sea of Stars has been played by over 4 million users across all platforms since its launch on August 29th, 2023.
Now something to keep in mind is that this will include figures from the likes of Xbox Game Pass, so we&#x27;re not talking about copies sold, as such, but 4 million is still a remarkable feat, regardless.

Cave, a shoot-&#x27;em-up developer assembled from the ashes of Toaplan, was preparing to fold in 2001. The arcade scene was moving in new directions, relying on increasingly ostentatious Taikan cabinets to compete with the emerging technology of home consoles. For Cave, the 2D shoot &#x27;em up, no matter how unerringly creative, was struggling to make the bottom line sing, and it was in large part thanks to Taiwanese company IGS that they survived another decade. Cave was so impressed with IGS&#x27;s PolyGame Master arcade hardware and the bastard Donpachi entry they had created for it, that they licensed the tech to have one last charge - events that would deliver DoDonpachi DaiOuJou, its suffix loosely translating as “blissful death”.
Tsuneki Ikeda, lead programmer, video game auteur, and then the company’s public face, lamented that he could never make anything as impressive as Ikaruga. He was wrong. Over time, DaiOuJou stands not only superior to Treasure’s polarising genre hybrid, but is considered by enthusiasts to be one of the greatest games ever coded. It’s the shoot-&#x27;em-up equivalent to Capcom’s Super Street Fighter II Turbo or SNK’s King of Fighters ’98: a signifying work that does not date, and compels people decades on to play for fresh achievements. In 2015, at Shanghai’s Lie Huo arcade, the expert DaiOuJou players casually ripped through its two loops like tin foil, cigarettes dangling idly from their mouths. When questioned, all were unanimous in citing it as the apex of the bullet-hell sub-genre. And they were right. Although its difficulty is a high bar, learning to play it is also to understand its genius.

Ever since the release of the Pokémon GO Plus wristband, there have been a handful of &#x27;auto-catching&#x27; imitators keen to bring something new to catching &#x27;em all. But many of these (including the catchily named Pokémon GO Plus +) have suffered from the same issue: after a while, they will disconnect from the game.
For the most part, until now this problem was only remedied by manually reconnecting the device, but Brook Gaming&#x27;s Pocket iRecatcher is on the way to make this necessary step a little more automatic.

Atlus has announced that the Persona 5 series has surpassed an incredible 10 million copies sold worldwide. Now, the obvious caveat here is that we&#x27;re talking about several games rather than just one, with the series comprised of the original Persona 5, its comprehensive Royal sibling, Persona 5 Strikers, Persona 5: Dancing in Starlight, and Persona 5 Tactica.
Still, 10 million is nevertheless a commendable feat and just goes to show the sharp increase in the franchise&#x27;s popularity. Switch owners had been clamouring for Persona 5 for years before it was finally confirmed to launch on October 21st, 2022. Persona 3 Portable and Persona 4 Golden followed in January 2023 before Persona 5 Tactica launched across all platforms on November 17th, 2023.

Players can now pause the title during gameplay, head to the options menu and swap the display to HI-RES. This will give the game a crisp resolution of 1080P in docked and 720P in handheld mode. You can even swap to HI-RES CRT mode.

                              <span>Multiplayer shooters have become defined in recent years by the methods they use to withhold power from players, whether that’s a hero shooter&#x27;s unlocks and battle pass or a survival shooter&#x27;s vast map of scattered goodies.

                              <span>Every weekend, indie devs show off current work on Twitter&#x27;s #screenshotsaturday tag. And every Monday, I bring you a selection of these snaps and clips. This week is the end of the year for us here at RPS, so this is the last look I&#x27;ll bring you until the future arrives. In that spirit, please enjoy this bumper Christmas edition to tide you over until we&#x27;re back. Don&#x27;t read it in one go under the covers while guzzling chocolate coins, you little scamp.

Soon, we will commence the annual Engluttification ceremony, a ritual of banishment in which we feed the Maw our entire Steam wishlists while singing an arcane carol of our own devising, Nth Days of Solstice, in which the famous partridge in the pear tree has Twice-Twenty Wings, and on each Wing I saw an Eye, verily, and a Mouth rejoicing for lo, the Great Catch-Up Period has come. But before that, there is still a little more News to cover.
Some games we&#x27;re keeping under surveillance before we flee the premises: surreal turn-based RPG Entogious (18th Dec), construction-minded endless runner Project Bridge (18th Dec), 90s-style RPG Prophecy of the Shadow (19th Dec).

An application filed at a California court seeks assistance from Cloudflare to identify the operators of dozens of illegal streaming sites after they provided access to matches featuring big clubs including Manchester City, Liverpool, Chelsea, and Arsenal.

                              <span>The Sonic franchise has taken many forms, from 2D to 3D, and even a point-and-click game. This time around, we&#x27;re dealing with Sonic Dream Team which is a platformer available on various Apple devices through its Arcade.


As a fan of the series, Dream Team&#x27;s concept piqued my curiosity. To my surprise, I&#x27;m subscribed to Apple Arcade, allowing me to download the game without forking out any cash. What I discovered is a sterling Sonic platformer that&#x27;ll unfortunately fly under the radar for most, despite providing the kind of gameplay fans are always desperate for.


Sonic Dream Team (Mac [reviewed], iOS, iPad, AppleTV)
Developer: Hardlight 
Publisher: Sega
Released: December 5, 2023
MSRP: Free for Apple Arcade subscribers

                              <span>When Super Mario RPG first dropped, it showed the kind of magic that could happen when two of the biggest names in gaming — Square and Nintendo — combined their powers. The recent remake is a great reminder of how those creative decisions can introduce new players to a genre that otherwise never clicked for them.


I used to be among that crowd, appreciating the idea of role-playing games without ever quite grasping what made them work. Not to out myself as a Dumb Gamer™, but going from reflex-based to menu-based action was jarring for me. When you&#x27;re a kid who almost exclusively plays platformers, beat &#x27;em ups, and run-and-gunners, it can be difficult to make the leap to RPGs. It certainly wasn&#x27;t for lack of trying, either.

                              <span>I was shuttling up to my Voidship, planning to check out a prison planet uprising, when the sun exploded. The unexpected arrival of Xenos ships and the quick deployment of their star-shattering weapon left my crew in complete disarray. As I met with a round table of companions and ship staff, I was presented with choices.


With the collapsing force of the star and the growing instability brought on by the Warp, evacuations were ill-advised. Still, I could try to save the nearby planet&#x27;s population, but allies noted that the Warp had likely corrupted them. Alternatively, a member of the Adeptus Mechanicus asked if I&#x27;d consider diverting resources to save a piece of sacred machinery. Others at the meeting demanded we high-tail it out of the system as fast as possible.

What’s the meaning of life? Are we alone in the universe? How do you know if the fridge light goes off after you close the door? It’s questions like this that have driven humankind to explore the planet, the cosmos, and ourselves. And the kitchen. This irresistible drive of curiosity and the addictive high of discovery are what Outer Wilds captures so well, letting this indie game put big-name space exploration titles to shame.
Mobius Digital’s mesmerising cosmic adventure that is Outer Wilds first landed on PC and Xbox in 2019 to serious critical acclaim. Receiving plaudits around the internet and a Best Game BAFTA to boot, it’s no surprise that it topped stacks of game-of-the-year lists. It’s been a long wait for Switch gamers hoping for a port, but it’s mostly good news: the indie masterpiece has kept its magic in the jump to Nintendo’s portable – albeit with a bit of a technical struggle.

We&#x27;re republishing this list to mark the 30th anniversary of the SNES classic, Mega Man X. Enjoy!

The little blue guy known as Mega Man (along with his various associates and related robots) has had a very long and storied career in video games. Since the NES days, he&#x27;s starred in some absolute classics of the run-and-gun genre, although for every incredible game or spin-off experience Capcom has delivered, there have arguably been one or two titles that either didn&#x27;t quite hit the mark or — more often — felt a little too familiar. With so many games in the Blue Bomber&#x27;s back catalogue, it can be hard to know which ones are the cream of the crop. Well, that&#x27;s where we come in.

Soapbox features enable our individual writers and contributors to voice their opinions on hot topics and random stuff they&#x27;ve been chewing over. Today, to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the launch of Mega Man X in Japan, Ollie dives into what makes its introductory stage so darn good...

The original Mega Man series is well known for its punishing difficulty, particularly for newcomers. With time, patience, and persistence, it is relatively easy to learn the ropes and get through each entry with little fuss, but if there’s one thing the original franchise lacked — particularly on the NES — it was a tutorial.

Welcome back to another edition of Box Art Brawl, are you ready to rank some covers?
Before we head into this week&#x27;s competition, however, let&#x27;s check out what happened last time. We got all agricultural as we matched up two covers for Harvest Moon 64 in celebration of it landing on NSO. They were both pretty sweet options, but the result wasn&#x27;t even close with North America walking away with a staggering 81% of the vote compared to Japan&#x27;s 19%. Oof.

Spike Chunsoft, the Japanese developer (Pokémon Mystery Dungeon, AI: The Somnium Files, the Danganronpa series) and publisher, wants fans to take its 2023 video game survey, so it can learn more about what they&#x27;re interested in.

                              <span>Stealth tactics &#x27;em up Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew is an &quot;all-time treasure&quot;, according to Katharine&#x27;s review, and it has to be given that developers Mimimi announced their closure almost immediately after its release.

                              <span>The nominees for the public-voted Steam Awards have been announced and they are, perhaps more than ever before, baffling to me. If I was being uncharitable, I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s because the list is overrun by games with large multiplayer communities that can be encouraged to vote for them - but who would want to be uncharitable? Let&#x27;s instead say that the list is certainly not boring, even if Starfield gets a nod for &quot;most innovative gameplay&quot;.

V článku nazvaném Towards SSH3: how HTTP/3 improves secure shells se píše: Protokol SSH byl navržen na konci devadesátých let, aby se vypořádal s bezpečnostními problémy rodiny protokolů telnet. Do protokolů pro vzdálený přístup přinesl ověřování a důvěrnost a nyní je široce používán. Téměř 30 let po původním návrhu se k protokolu SSH vracíme ve světle nejnovějších protokolů včetně QUIC, TLS 1.3 a HTTP/3. Navrhujeme, implementujeme a vyhodnocujeme protokol SSH3, který poskytuje rozšířenou sadu funkcí bez kompromisů ve srovnání s protokolem SSHv2.</span>

Sabotage Studio director Thierry Boulanger has announced via Discord the company will be removing the content creator and internet personality Jirard &#x27;The Completionist&#x27; Khalil from the indie RPG hit Sea of Stars.
Sea of Stars arrived on the Switch earlier this year in August and featured a segment in it where Khalil showed up as a non-playable character known as &quot;Jirard the Constructionist&quot;, who the main heroes of the story could interact with. This decision follows Khalil being accused of &quot;charity fraud&quot; last month.

                              <span>&quot;We actually don’t like to talk about Worldless as a Metroidvania&quot;.

Fans of 2D platformers in the Metroidvania mould aren&#x27;t exactly lacking for excellent examples of the genre. It feels like every other game launching at the moment is either a roguelite deckbuilder or an explorative action platformer.

It&#x27;s GOTY time, lovely people.
Looking back over the last 12 months, it&#x27;s been an incredibly fruitful year for gamers.

Well, the weekend has rolled around once again so it&#x27;s time for a spot of gaming, we&#x27;d say.
Before we get to that, however, does anyone fancy a quick round-up of the Nintendo highlights from this week? We&#x27;ve been taking a look at what classic SEGA franchises you&#x27;d like to see return, keeping up with everything going on in Fortnite and gawping at how long we have all played a certain Hylian adventure thanks to Nintendo dropping our years in review.

Earlier this week the relatively new farming sim Fae Farm got a free DLC update Coasts of Croakia - taking players to the Archl-pal-igo Park, where they can learn the language of the many critters roaming the park.
In addition to this, there&#x27;s been a bunch of updates to the game adding in new dialogue, an increase to house storage, and much more. We&#x27;ve not got the full list of patch notes, detailing exactly what this latest update has added to the game. Here&#x27;s the rundown:

This bumps the application up to Version 3.2.1 and most importantly adds compatibility for the Part 2 DLC. Here&#x27;s a bit about what you can expect from this update, which also comes packed with the Blueberry Pokédex, new challenges and stickers:

I think last week I might have forgotten to update whatever it was I was playing. I can&#x27;t remember. It&#x27;s nearly the end of the year, what do you want from me? To do my job? Pah. Anyway, we&#x27;re playin&#x27; some stuff, alright.

                              <span>In the market for a new SSD and a new controller? Good news, Ebuyer has got you covered with deal that bundles the excellent Sony DualSense PS5 controller with a fast Crucial T500 2TB SSD, complete with heatsink. Bought separately, these would run you £180, but together you can pick them up for just £140.
This deal is marketed as the &#x27;ideal PS5 upgrade kit&#x27;, but it&#x27;s actually just as relevant for PC users looking to pick up one of the best gamepads (alongside the Xbox Elite controller also discounted today) and get more game storage at the same time.

                              <span>Microsoft&#x27;s phenomenal Elite Series 2 controller is down to £100 after a £60 discount at Amazon UK. That&#x27;s a great price for, in my opinion, one of the very best gamepads for PC and Xbox - and well worth picking up for the holidays. 
If you want just the core controller without its accessory bag (purchaseable separately), you can get the controller for even less - £78!

                              <span>A Hunter x Hunter fighting game is officially in development, as announced by publisher Bushiroad at Jump Festa 2024. It&#x27;s being worked on by DNF Duel and Tatsunoko vs Capcom developer Eighting. 


According to Gematsu, more details will be shared at Bushiroad New Year Grand Presentation 2024, which occurs on January 6. The announcement was made at the publisher&#x27;s booth in Jump Festa 2024 on Friday. No gameplay or even screenshots has been shown as of the time of writing. No platforms have been announced either. 


Bushiroad has games based on other anime properties, including Goblin Slayer, Miss Kobayashi&#x27;s Dragon Maid, and Shin Chan. This Hunter x Hunter game seems to be the publisher&#x27;s first fighting title on consoles, but it has released a mobile wrestling game in the past based on NJP…</span>

                              <span>Movies and games have always had an ambivalent relationship. Gaming&#x27;s the new kid on the block, and it seems pathologically obsessed with clinging onto Hollywoodesque tropes and presentation styles. Nevertheless, with its flourishing popularity, the gaming industry does occasionally show deep-seated desires to forge an independent identity.



FMV games complicate the situation further. They&#x27;re not quite movies, as you&#x27;re invited to interact with the story. On the other hand, when you have live-action scenes in your game, it&#x27;s understandable to feel like you&#x27;re engaging with the work of folks who&#x27;d much rather be on film sets. 




Stubbornly resistant to concrete categories, FMVs exist in a liminal space populated with both potential and pitfalls. Despite producing some of gaming&#x27;s earlie…</span>

                              <span>There&#x27;s something shameful I must admit about myself: I&#x27;m a native of Miami, Florida. It&#x27;s where I spent the first 18 years of my life growing up, and even after leaving, I look back on my time a lot.


South Florida was my home, and feeling its vibe is rare unless I visit family. That is, until I saw the long-anticipated trailer for Grand Theft Auto VI. I&#x27;ve watched it more than a few times now, and my only thought is, &quot;Yeah, that&#x27;s Florida.&quot;




Does it capture absolutely everything I associate with the state? No, but for a trailer that&#x27;s only 90 seconds long, it gets so much right. It also makes me feel represented in a way I don&#x27;t think any other game has made me feel before.

                              <span>The Earthworm Jim games were perhaps the earliest indication that I’d wind up in this career. They were the first time that I really became aware of the developers behind the games I played, and beyond that, I actually contacted one of them – via snail mail.


I was probably 7 at the time, and I wrote to Shiny Entertainment asking them if they were going to make an Earthworm Jim 2. Amazingly, they wrote back. Not just some pre-formatted response, either. They actually answered my questions. I wish I still had that letter.


After Earthworm Jim 2, Shiny adopted a no-sequel policy. Earthworm Jim 3D wasn’t developed by Shiny, and as an N64 owner, I wouldn’t play another game by the developer until 2003’s Enter the Matrix. At that point, Shiny had been sold to Infogrames, and their last years …</span>

For transgressions of rules that didn&#x27;t apply in the past, creators receive community strikes in the present. For the operator of the DBTech YouTube channel, which specializes in tutorials about self-hosted services, two strikes for old videos featuring youtube-dl and similar software, raise concerns over future content viability, even when it fully complies today.

The world of Dota doesn&#x27;t have a Santa Claus, but it seems that Wraith King is stepping up to fill his shoes nonetheless, and his &quot;Naughty List&quot; includes thousands of accounts that have been positively unsportsmanlike.


Indeed, the Frostivus 2023 update that rolled out incorporates a hilarious surprise for smurfs and other bad actors in Dota 2.

Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom


Obviously, all eyes are going to be on Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. As a follow-up to Breath of the Wild, it was expected to deliver: But I don&#x27;t think anyone could have anticipated just how much it would iterate upon the fantastic framework we already got with the launch of the Switch in 2017. People may have been worried that Tears would operate like an &quot;expansion pack&quot; to the 2017 modern classic, but those fears were completely unfounded.


We also got a new Fire Emblem game, another Pikmin entry (which might be the best one …</span>

We&#x27;ve already hit the PlayStation and Xbox consoles, along with more specific categories like best indie and ongoing game. Looking back, I realize 2023 is one of the toughest years for GOTY choices I&#x27;ve had in ages, and I&#x27;m thankful this was a staff-wide endeavor; otherwise, this list would&#x27;ve taken until next year to shape up. 


As always, our platform categories don&#x27;t mean the game only released on that platform. Plenty of the nominees here launched on both console and PC, but our formula still keeps games limited to one nomination in any given categ…</span>

                              <span>Atari and Mega Cat Studios have released Food Fight: Culinary Combat, a multi-player reimagining of the somewhat bizarre 1983 arcade game, into Early Access. The catch is that, right now, it’s exclusively available on the Atari VCS.


As a note of disclosure, I did a stint with Mega Cat Studios writing for their blog and for a still unannounced (and maybe canceled?) game. They weren’t working on Food Fight at the time, as far as I know.




By the looks of things, Food Fight: Culinary Combat doesn’t really have anything to do with the 1983 arcade game. Maybe. It’s hard to tell. It’s the type of trailer that cuts so frequently that you don’t get a very good look at things. There is a single-player mode, and maybe you fight chefs, or perhaps instead, it’s zombie food.

                              <span>In sad news for anyone who enjoys fan games and remakes of retro titles, Nintendo has shut down a fan-made The Legend of Zelda: Link&#x27;s Awakening PC port. 


Eurogamer reported on this disappointing turn of events for the Zelda fangame community, and reiterating its features only makes its loss sting. The Link&#x27;s Awakening PC port included some lovely features, including supporting up to 120 frames per second, widescreen, and zooming options that could let you see virtually the entire world map at once. That still doesn&#x27;t change how ardently protective Nintendo is over its properties, so it called for the game be pulled from Itch&#x27;s pages.


According to the Nintendo representative who sent the notice of infringement, &quot;It has come to our attention that the following game, https://linksawakeningdxhd.itch.io/links-awakening-dx-hd, offered on Itch.io infringes and makes unauthorized use of Nintendo’s copyrights in The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening video game.&quot;


Any downloads for the Link&#x27;s Awakening port are no longer available on its Itch.io page. Its takedown is a shame, but not a surprise.




Nintendo is infamous for its ironclad control over its IPs, with well-documented fights with other fan projects. There are plenty of cases in the past of projects like this gradually picking up internet infamy, then receiving a cease-and-desist.


While Nintendo&#x27;s within its legal rights to go after these projects, it&#x27;s sad to see interesting projects like these go. Link&#x27;s Awakening is still available on Switch, either through the remake or Switch Online&#x27;s Game Boy collection.

                              <span>Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 is now available on Xbox Series platforms, but don&#x27;t expect the game to make its way to Microsoft&#x27;s Game Pass subscription service anytime soon.


In a recent interview with IGN, Larian Studios boss Swen Vincke confirmed the company has no plans to release its award-winning title on Game Pass, citing the game&#x27;s sheer scope as a factor for this decision.


&quot;We made a big game, so I think there&#x27;s a fair price to be paid for that, and I think that that is okay,&quot; Vincke said. &quot;We don&#x27;t charge you any micro-transactions on top of it, so you get what you pay for. Upfront, it&#x27;s a big meaty game. So I think that should be able to exist as it is. This is what allows us to continue making other games.&quot;


With the average Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 playthrough running for at least 50 hours (according to player data aggregated by HowLongToBeat) Vincke definitely has a point there. My own run took me 107 hours, and I  ignored a whole bunch of side quests and points of interest in Act 3.


Larian doesn&#x27;t seem inclined to give up Xbox&#x27;s market potential for a Game Pass deal with Microsoft, and given the game&#x27;s overwhelming success, it&#x27;s no wonder.




Still, Xbox fans might find it disappointing that the studio is dismissing the possibility altogether. Vincke, who recently released his full Game of the Year acceptance speech, certainly isn&#x27;t mincing words when he talks about knowing what their game is really worth. 


While Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 took home multiple trophies at The Game Awards and has received a lot of acclaim, it&#x27;s easy to see how some might still be wary of spending $70 if they&#x27;re not not an initiate of the CRPG genre or Dungeons &amp; Dragons itself. 


A Game Pass demo might have gone a long way toward alleviating those fears. But as of now, Larian has no plans for one.

                              <span>After a decade in Early Access, Planet Management God Simulator The Universim is finally set for its full 1.0 release. Developer Crytivo revealed today that the God Sim will leave Early Access on January 22, 2024. Alongside a ton of improvements, the full release also introduces the space age which gives players access to advanced technology including the all-new planet cracker. 




A decade of features


The God Simulator has been in development for ten years now, including a successful Kickstarter campaign back in 2014 that got almost $400k in backing. With the full release of The Universim, players will be able to explore an unlimited amount of space and colonize as many planets as they wish, each with their own conditions and challenges. Some planets will be abundantly resource-rich providing a great opportunity to expand and prosper with your civilization. Over 600 new voice-over lines have been added to enhance the now-completed storyline. 


The Universim has become quite popular among the simulation community, with over half a million Steam wishlists and over 6,000 reviews giving it a Very Positive rating.


I played The Universim years ago and loved it, and with all the content they&#x27;ve added in recent years, this is the perfect time for me to give it another go. If you&#x27;re looking for a multi-planet faring God Simulator, you should definitely check it out.


The Universim fully releases on PC via Steam on January 22, 2024.

After years of waiting for consoles to be easily accessible to purchase, you can get a PS5 on Amazon or an Xbox Series X at Target. Plus, the Nintendo Switch, including its OLED version, has seen some price cuts since its 2017 launch. 


It’s the perfect time to get that gamer in your life a console. Now all that&#x27;s left to do is to buy some games. I mean, you can&#x27;t get a console without some games. But what to choose? Well, I&#x27;m here to help ease that search and give some of my recommendations for the best games to gift.

                              <span>I may not put much thought into Christmas lists today, but back when I was a kid they were practically an art form. From the presentation to the content itself, I pulled out all the stops to draw attention to whatever it was I coveted at the time. 


Thanks to the magic of Never Throwing Anything Away, we can now take a trip back to 1994 to see how well my wants, needs, and frothing demands stack up today.


When I first found this relic, I was instantly transported to more carefree days. While it may indeed be &quot;just another Christmas list,&quot; there&#x27;s a certain element of time travel involved when you&#x27;re staring down the barrel of crumpled yellow legal paper full of must-own games, consoles, and action figures. Ever the savvy child, my &#x27;94 list is ordered by priority, with the first page pra…</span>

                              <span>Resident Evil 4 being nominated for several categories at The Game Awards 2023 shows that remakes are still very much in vogue. It seems evident that we should never forget the classics. And that&#x27;s exactly what this one modder is doing with the original RE2.


Perhaps in an attempt to blend modern Resident Evil with the retro installments, Itch.io user PerroAutonomo has been remaking the second game in the series. Only, they aren&#x27;t updating the visuals or the cheesy dialogue. No. They&#x27;re sticking with how the original 1998 release looked, but have made it into a first-person shooter.




The above video from the YouTube channel Residence of Evil does a half hour playthrough of the demo. As for when the full thing will be released, PerroAutonomo&#x27;s page says they may not finish it, and the current build &quot;has many errors&quot; (translated by Google).


Complete with fully remade cut scenes


The footage shows how authentic this unofficial remake is. It endeavors to keep the visual style of Resident Evil 2 but chooses a different perspective. We get to see a lot of the game from new angles never seen before, and even though it&#x27;s a fan project, it&#x27;s still impressive to see.


As Capcom marches forward with its iconic survival horror series, we welcome whatever&#x27;s on the horizon. With more Resident Evil remakes being confirmed, everyone&#x27;s going to be wondering which one&#x27;s going to get the remake treatment next.


We may well get to see a fresh take on one of the spin-offs, such as Code Veronica or Umbrella Chronicles. Or maybe RE5 will get another crack at not being a disappointment. Time will tell on that front.

                              <span>Via Twitter, Square Enix has announced that the latest in the SaGa series, SaGa: Emerald Beyond, will launch on April 25, 2024. It’s coming to Switch, PS4, PS5, Steam, iOS, and Android.


While a new SaGa entry was talked about as far back as 2021, SaGa: Emerald Beyond was only officially announced in the September 2023 Nintendo Direct. It’s the latest from the long-running series, dating back to 1989 with Makai Toushi SaGa or The Final Fantasy Legend. You don’t have to have been following the series since then, as this one is supposedly standalone.




SaGa: Emerald Beyond is an RPG where you take control of six protagonists and explore 17 interconnected worlds. It features a branching storyline based on the choices you make. The combat is turn-based, with a great deal of emphasis put on the timeline, which tracks turn order. From the look of it, it’s similar to Fuga: Melodies of Steel, where your success is determined partially by how you can maximize your speed while delaying the enemy.


I’ve never gotten into the SaGa series, mainly because I don’t really know where to start. I’ve played The Final Fantasy Legend, but dropped off partway through. I’m not sure sequentially is the right move here. However, SaGa: Emerald Beyond looks rad as heck, with some great character design and imaginative worlds.


SaGa: Emerald Beyond releases on April 25, 2024 on Switch, PS4, PS5, Steam, iOS, and Android.

                              <span>It&#x27;s not just Steam that has sale events, albeit those are the ones most PC gamers think of. Other outlets such as GOG also put some deals on as well, and the CD Projekt-owned distribution site has recently started its winter sale.


If you head over to Good Old Games, you&#x27;ll see a host of titles that are currently on offer. The event is going until January 4, so you&#x27;ve got some time to get a few downloads in around the Christmas period.




As for what&#x27;s on offer, there&#x27;s a veritable bevy of classic/retro and more modern releases. For example, the original Mortal Kombat games are currently 75% off, as is the complete Yakuza series. The remake of System Shock is 35% off and, naturally, Cyberpunk 2077 and the DLC are discounted at 50% and 15% respectively.


Yes, of course Skyrim is in the sale, too


All-in-all, there are around 6,000 games that are part of the winter sales event. Oh, I could list off many more examples, but I&#x27;d be here for quite some time.


Suffice it to see, there&#x27;s quite a few that I&#x27;ll be tempted to pick up between now and January. I was pleasantly surprised to see the Myst 30th anniversary collection at nearly 60% off. Not because I&#x27;m a fan of Myst (have never played it), but because I don&#x27;t think I even knew it was that old. Time is fleeting, etc.


Anyway, as we approach the end of 2023, all the gaming platforms and websites will be putting on their own sales. Look out for the Steam winter event next week. Admit it. That&#x27;s probably what most of you are waiting for.

                              <span>It&#x27;s that time of year when things start to slow down and everyone settles in for the arrival of winter. For those looking to boost their ranking on Santa&#x27;s Nice List, PowerWash Simulator is taking us to Santa&#x27;s Workshop to clean up after a wild elf party.


In an X post made by the PowerWash Simulator account, a gift has arrived for those who wish to clean a bit more. Players on PlayStation, Xbox, and Steam can access a new free level on December 14, 2023, and Switch players can get in on the fun on January 8, 2024.


PowerWash Simulator brings Santa&#x27;s Workshop to life


The level itself is a small but densely packed affair, with plenty of nooks and crannies to blast clean. I hadn&#x27;t touched PowerWash Simulator since the SpongeBob SquarePants DLC back in June and I was pleasantly surprised at how quickly it all came back to me. Before I knew it, Christmas had been saved and my trip to the North Pole could be written off as a business expense.


Every one of PowerWash Simulator&#x27;s offerings, both free and paid, has been an utter delight. Santa&#x27;s Workshop is no different and offers plenty of reasons to boot up the relaxing title and spray away the gunk.




With the Warhammer 40,000 DLC being delayed to 2024, this bite-sized DLC should hopefully be enough to tide players over. Either way, if you&#x27;ve been wanting a break from other titles or even want to take power washing into the third dimension, PowerWash Simulator has you covered. Just make sure you wear the proper PPE when cleaning Cloud&#x27;s Buster Sword in the Seventh Heaven Bar.

Dragon Quest possesses so much history that any new game carries a degree of raised expectation. Dragon Quest Monsters: The Dark Prince delivers many of the conventions I’ve come to expect from the series: the vibrant opening song, the charismatic Slime, and the emotional storytelling I already associate with the franchise.

&quot;Without that element of trust, I couldn&#x27;t continue working there, and so I left, so that I could continue working in what I consider to be the right way,&quot; Kamiya said. &quot;I don&#x27;t think of games as products, but rather as works of art.

                              <span>Rocket Arena, the multiplayer rocket-powered shooter, developed by Final Strike Games as an EA Originals title, was removed from sale last month without warning or a word on why, as reported by RockPaperShotgun. Now, roughly a month later, Final Strike Games has announced Rocket Arena will be sunset and its servers shut down in March. 
More specifically, Rocket Arena will come to an end at Noon PT/3 p.m. ET on March 21, 2024. As for why, the team doesn&#x27;t really address that in its announcement but presumably, it has lost the player count needed to sustain its live-service, multiplayer model. 
Rocket Arena will be sunset on March 21, 2024 12:00 PM PDT. We’ll have some community events leading up to the date.

                              <span>Naughty Dog has announced it has ceased production of The Last of Us Online, its long-in-development multiplayer title set within its popular post-apocalyptic universe. 
In a blog post, Naughty Dog explains it made the “incredibly difficult” decision to cancel the project after it apparently became so big that the studio realized it would need to devote precious resources to support it post-launch for years to come. When faced with the reality of having to become a studio solely dedicated to supporting a live service game or to continue making single-player experiences, it chose the latter. 
Here&#x27;s Naughty Dog&#x27;s full statement:
The Last of Us Online was originally intended as a multiplayer mode attached to The Last of Us Part II, serving as a successor to the first game&#x27;s Factions mode. Ho…</span>

                              <span>In common with most technologies, Artificial Intelligence can be used for both good and bad. Universal Music Group says that it recognizes its full potential. The company uses AI for marketing, production, and security, but also cautions against misuse. The label says that fraudsters are generating and selling fake &#x27;pre-release tracks&#x27; of popular artists for thousands of dollars.

The identities of Glo TV&#x27;s operators are currently unknown but by also targeting those identified more easily, DISH may choose to put their feet to the fire and see who sweats first. With $25m in damages on the line, December could be a warm month.

                              <span>I don&#x27;t look for Christmas games. Partly because they&#x27;re basically all terrible, and partly because of how tiresome it is when everything is saturated with the same theme wherever you look. But Ebenezer And The Invisible World is about helping Scrooge run around London bashing capitalists and other evil spirits with his cane, and summoning friendly ghosts to prevent Caspar Malthus from genociding the working class. I simply could not find out what the hell was going on there.
Turns out, it&#x27;s kinda good. But it has too many problems to reach much beyond that.

                              <span>It&#x27;s always saddened me that Simogo&#x27;s brilliant text-based adventure Device 6 has been trapped on iOS-only devices since it first came out... ten years ago? Hell&#x27;s bells, now I feel old. If you&#x27;re unfamiliar with it, it&#x27;s about a girl named Anna who must escape from a mysterious island, but the whole game is presented like you&#x27;re reading a book - only one that you can click on and prod with your fingers to reveal new puzzles within that text. It&#x27;s very clever, especially when it occasionally asks you to rotate your device to navigate parts of its game worlds - there&#x27;s an excellent bit with stairs that I won&#x27;t spoil, but seriously, if you haven&#x27;t played Device 6 and you own an iOS device, go and download it now. 
Once you&#x27;ve done that, you should also have a look this year&#x27;s Delete After Reading, which does a very good impression of it for us folks on PC, hiding smart, tactile text puzzles inside its interactive spy thriller.

                              <span>Naughty Dog have officially stopped development of The Last Of Us Online, a multiplayer game based on their celebrated McCarthyite (no, not that McCarthy - I mean the novelist) post-apocalyptic action-adventure. Announced in the dusty days of 2018 as a multiplayer mode for The Last Of Us: Part 2, it evolved into a standalone experience with new characters and a new setting, but Sony reportedly scaled the project back earlier this year. Naughty Dog have now formally called it quits, stating that supporting a live service project such as this would have “severely impacted” future single-player game projects. Sony never locked down platforms for The Last Of Us Online, but a PC release was surely on the cards, though I would have expected the game to launch first on PlayStation, as with the original Last Of Us and Uncharted 4.

                              <span>To celebrate Doom&#x27;s 30th birthday we had a discussion about the (understandably) vaunted FPS&#x27;s influence, and what games would look like without it. It seems particularly interesting today in light of the recent resurgence of Doom-style shooters, often known as &quot;boomer shooters&quot; because of their deliberately retro style and singular focus on shootin&#x27; stuff and bein&#x27; cool, much like Doom. And then the obvious solution was to just ask the devs making these games about what they think of Doom and its impact on their work.
I reached out to developers who&#x27;ve worked on Turbo Overkill, Prodeus, Forgive Me Father (and Forgive Me Father 2) and almost the whole stable working at New Blood Interactive to ask them some annoyingly specific questions about Doom in the hope of getting the sort of idiosyncratic answers you get from interesting devs - and they delivered! In fact, they delivered in such quantity and quality that I&#x27;ve elected to just present their answers to you, rather than try to weave them together as if we were all sitting together at dinner exchanging bon mots, both for clarity and to include as much as possible in their own words. It&#x27;s a fascinating and entertaining collection of thoughts.

It was announced this week and there&#x27;s a demo on Steam, which I think will tickle the cockles of Psychonauts 2 players and A Short Hike fans alike, though I do wish developers ln404 and akinat0 had taken their own work just a little more seriously.

                              <span>There are as many Doom mods as there are stars in the sky: jillions of accursed celestial bodies orbiting the supermassive black hole that is id Software, each infested with its own local flavours of cacodemons and keycards and shotguns. I&#x27;ve played just a handful - certainly, far from enough to pronounce myself any kind of expert - but I do feel like I&#x27;ve played one of the best in the shape of Siren, a Doom II total conversion from Dithered Output, the first episode of which can be downloaded free from Itch.io.


The mod&#x27;s overall vibe is encapsulated, I think, by the sentient vending machine you meet a short way in, just round the corner from a rec room that contains a disembodied head on tentacles, and down the corridor from a tiered canteen full of ghouls and unsympathetic men with shotguns. You ask the machine if it has any clue what&#x27;s going on. It tells you that its job is to keep its mouth shut and dispense soda. Can I have a soda, then? &quot;No.&quot;

                              <span>I haven’t been keeping up with player reaction to the latest Twar and Twarhammer games, but it seems players are none too pleased with Creative Assembly right now. In a rather dramatic open letter, the company&#x27;s vice president Roger Collum has acknowledged that Total War: Warhammer 3’s Shadows of Change add-on and the recent historical strategy outing Total War: Pharaoh did not ship in a desirable state, with complaints ranging from wobbly execution to overpricing. The studio will try to make things right by offering partial refunds to Pharaoh owners and giving away DLC on top of the usual updates.

                              <span>The first mod I ever downloaded was for Skyrim. It replaced NPCs with Shrek. The second was a texture pack for Dark Souls: Remastered. I believe that these two examples form a representative sample of what mods are: quality of life improvements, and Shrek. Doom’s modding community, known by its file package WAD, is the Ur modding community. Thanks to John Carmack’s lightning-fast engine, creating levels and content for Doom has been accessible for 30 years. WAD devs have gone on to become fully-fledged game designers, and some WADs have been released commercially. The breadth and depth of this community formed the bedrock of game developers. And yet even with this pedigree, MyHouse.WAD is a miracle.

                              <span>Ultrawide monitors often come at a premium, but right now you can pick up a 34-inch gaming monitor for just $199 - just in time for the winter holidays where you&#x27;ll have a chance to snuggle up and play some video games! 
That&#x27;s a phenomenally good price for a 3440x1440 LG model with a 100Hz refresh rate and FreeSync/G-Sync Compatible support for gaming. The monitor is even based around an IPS panel that covers 99% of the sRGB gamut with wide viewing angles and good colour accuracy, making it a good choice for content creation too.

That said, the reveal trailer isn&#x27;t that long, and fans are understandably hungry for more.
Luckily for them, co-creative director/art director Sébastien Mitton revealed a few images of concept art on X today. These images were created by Sergey Kolesov and Jean-Luc Monnet, and you can see them for yourself below:

Concept art is mainly made to establish a general artistic tone and vibe of a game, so it doesn&#x27;t always include details present in the finished product. That said, we can infer a lot about the tone of the game based on these images. The dense city streets and subways certainly evoke Arkane&#x27;s environmental design, and Blade&#x27;s positions up high and in the shadows suggest stealthy problem-solving, another recurring aspect of Arkane&#x27;s games.

                              <span>Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - Definitive Edition didn’t launch in the greatest state, but after months of fixes, the game has been deemed ready to launch on mobile devices. The remasters of the series’ defining trilogy are now available on iOS, Android, and Netflix.
Like all Netflix titles, subscribers have immediate access to the Definitive Edition, which consists of modernized remasters of GTA III, Vice City, and San Andreas. On mobile, you can pick them up in the Trilogy bundle or purchase them individually.


Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - Definitive Edition first launched for consoles and PCs in November of 2021, while the mobile version was originally planned to launch in early 2022. These improved versions of the 2000s-era classics feature high-resolution textures, advanced lighting/weather effects, and modernized controls (modeled after GTA V), among other bells and whistles. However, due to the player complaints stemming from the collection’s poor launch state, the mobile version was hit with a lengthy delay as Rockstar worked to improve the released versions. 
In addition to the launch of The Trilogy, Grand Theft Auto VI was announced for a 2025 release. You can watch the game’s debut trailer here.</span>

The biggest omission was New Game Plus, but Insomniac assured fans it would come in an update to the game before the end of the year. Unfortunately, the developer won&#x27;t be able to hit that deadline, as it posted this update on social media yesterday.

                              <span>505 Games have released a chunky overview trailer for the heavily Suikoden-inspired RPG Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes – which means it’s time once again for me to share that one Suikoden story I have about how I bought Suikoden 2 for PS1 but got bored and traded it in, and now PS1 copies of Suikoden 2 regularly sell for hundreds of pounds, and why, why, didn’t you keep that in your sock drawer, Edwin, instead of your prized vintage copy of V-Rally, current average eBay price £3.99???
Plus which, Suikoden 2 is clearly one of the best RPGs ever made, Edwin, you blundering oaf, you absolute weapon. Arrrrgh. Hopefully Eiyuden Chronicle will ease the agony a little when it goes on sale on 23rd April 2024.

                              <span>&quot;I was looking up our Wikipedia page to see what happened this year,&quot; says Nightdive Studios&#x27; CEO Stephen Kick as we sit down to chat. That might seem like an odd thing to say about your own company&#x27;s activities. But when you look at what Nightdive have done in the last twelve months, it&#x27;s less surprising. In March, Nightdive announced they were being acquired by Atari in a deal worth $10 million. In May, they released their long-anticipated remake of System Shock, in development for eight years. July brought Rise Of The Triad: Ludicrous Edition, while August saw the release of Quake 2 Remastered, and a remaster of Turok 3 arrived at the end of November. Nightdive are currently working on an overhaul of Star Wars: Dark Forces, due out in 2024. 


In short, it&#x27;s been a busy year for the remastering maestros. In the wider context of 2023, which has been simultaneously a banner games and a deeply worrying year for the people making them, I wanted to know how Nightdive view the last twelve months, and what the audience response to these projects means for the studio&#x27;s future.

On the surface the artworks give away little, but thankfully, I am a Vampire of News, equipped with supernatural vision and insight. Why not come inside my den and let me regale you with some speculations? Don&#x27;t worry about the red stains on the carpet, that&#x27;s just, er, strawberry jam from all the doughnuts I&#x27;ve been eating recently. The red stains on the wall? Yeah, that&#x27;s blood.

                              <span>This week, the Electronic Wireless Show podcast remembers the recently deceased E3 games show. Unfortunately, all that we can really recall is the occasional watch party, and maybe Keanu Reeves was there at one point? Was mostly just trailers, let’s be honest. Thus we also consider the events that replace it (with a side-chat on this year’s Game Awards), and how we’d design our own glittering showcase o&#x27; games.
We also share what we’ve been playing this week, make a single non-PC game recommendation (that also represents the strangest coincidence in EWS history), and take another look at the Lenovo Legion Go. Last time I talk about the Lenovo Legion Go for a while, promise.
You can listen above, or on on Spotify, iTunes, Stitcher, or Pocket Casts. You can find the RSS feed here, and you can discuss the episode on our Discord channel, which has a dedicated room for podcast chat.

                              <span>Intel have finally confirmed the full lineup and specs for their 14th gen Meteor Lake CPUs, which for now is comprised entirely of ultrathin laptop chips with the new Core Ultra branding. I appreciate that a PC gaming site might not be the most natural home for this information, considering both that these are not technically gaming CPUs and that that Meteor Lake’s most hyped-up feature is more of a productivity aid: a Neural Processing Unit (NPU) for client-side AI work. However, as the new H-series parts also integrate Intel Arc graphics for the first time, there is some interesting potential for them to transform lightweight ultrabooks into viable gaming laptops.

                              <span>Video game openings have always been a source of fascination for me. As a player, you&#x27;re excited by the prospect of the game to come - the sights you&#x27;ll see, the challenges you&#x27;ll face - and first impressions can make or break your entire perception of what a game is versus the one you had stored in your head before switching it on. For video game creators, however, a new beginning is often racked with questions. What, exactly, do you choose to show players first? How will you introduce them to something they&#x27;ve never seen before? And if that game is successful, how do you keep reinventing that first impression across what could be several decades? 
In revisiting every mainline Doom game to celebrate its 30th anniversary this month, it&#x27;s clear that even id&#x27;s iconic shooter has wrestled with how to answer these question, and the ways it&#x27;s tried to reinvent itself over the years paints a captivating portrait of a series trying to move with the times. Nowhere is this more apparent than in its opening levels. Played in close succession, crushing 30 years into not even quite three hours, what emerges isn&#x27;t just the evolution of one of the all-time great PC games, but also a potted history of the FPS. So join me as we chart Doom&#x27;s rise, fall and rebirth through the lens of its first stages.

                              <span>Confession time, readers. Before a couple of weeks ago, I had never played the original Doom. As a child, my family didn&#x27;t have much money and I didn&#x27;t get my first laptop until I was 16. Thus, I missed out on a lot of what are now considered PC staples. With dread, I&#x27;m often met with the accursed exclamation, &quot;You&#x27;ve not played insert game before?&quot; followed by a good dose of judgment. But what do you do when you need to play through a backlog of games all while keeping up-to-date with new releases for work? With games now stretching out at 100+ hours apiece, where is the time for old classics like Doom?

It would not have been, all things considered, an unusual question to ask one of the game industry’s leading personalities. The Entertainment Software Association’s Electronic Entertainment Expo, better known as E3, has long been a dominating feature of the summer. But in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, the ESA hasn’t been able to open the doors to the highly regarded in-person convention.
However, Keighley is the driving force behind Summer Game Fest, a newly established but increasingly successful showcase effectively competing with E3. The query came from one of the many viewers who tuned in to see him speak candidly on YouTube following the Xbox/Bethesda showcase, one of Summer Game Fest’s crowning jewels. Keighley’s an…</span>

                              <span>Since rolling credits (and platinum-ing) God of War Ragnarök shortly after its release last year, I have craved more of developer Santa Monica Studio’s take on Norse mythology. I was satisfied with how the story wrapped up, although admittedly, I would have liked a more bombastic finale worthy of the name “Ragnarök,” so I wasn’t necessarily looking for new story content just yet. I was fine to wait for a sequel years down the road, perhaps with Kratos and Atreus traversing through a new line of mythological lands and gods. But I wanted some reason to return to its beautiful world, adrenaline-inducing combat, and top-tier characters. 


When PlayStation revealed Ragnarök’s Valhalla DLC, I was immediately excited. A free DLC dropping less than a week after its reveal featuring a new roguelit…</span>

For example, more than 40 percent of players customized their analog stick deadzone input in last year&#x27;s Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II. More than half of all players in that game adjusted graphical accessibility settings, too, like motion blur, field of view, and camera movement.

As the release date nears, developer Bandai Namco has been releasing more and more about the latest entry in its flagship fighting series. We learned about newcomer Reina last month, and recently went hands-on with the game, too – read Game Informer&#x27;s Tekken 8 preview here. Now, Bandai Namco has revealed the first gameplay trailer for its &quot;mechanized space ninja&quot; Yoshimitsu. 
It did so with a new Tekken 8 gameplay trailer that shows Yoshimitsu ripping and slicing through various fighters in the game&#x27;s roster. This ninja is no stranger to the Tekken series, having appeared in every mainline numbered Tekken game since the series&#x27; start – he&#x27;s actually my favorite fighter, and for money, this is his best look yet. 
Check him out in the Tekken 8 Yoshimitsu reveal and gameplay trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Yoshimitsu unsurprisingly relies on his ninja sword to do a lot of damage to enemy fighters. And he does so with the speed the character is known for. 
Tekken 8 hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on January 26, 2024. 
For more about the game, watch the Tekken 8 fighter reveal trailers for characters like Nina Williams, Paul Phoenix, Marshall Law, Jun Kazama, and Reina. After that, read Game Informer&#x27;s preview thoughts of Tekken 8 after playing the game for a couple of hours.

                              <span>Developer Bethesda Game Studios is working on bringing mod support, city maps, and &quot;all-new ways to traveling&quot; to its recently released sci-fi RPG, Starfield. It announced this by way of a Starfield subreddit comment from the official developer Reddit account, as reported by IGN. The team says it&#x27;s working on other things, too, like quest fixes, hotfixes, and more. 
It says players can expect a rollout of fixes and updates roughly every six weeks, although if something can be corrected with a quick hotfix, it might launch those in between the six-week waits.


While bug and progression fixes are nice, it&#x27;s the new ways of traveling and city maps that has me most excited. Traversing Starfield&#x27;s cities is fun, but actually learning them is quite difficult without a map. And I&#x27;m hoping the ne…</span>

                              <span>God of War  Ragnarök&#x27;s Valhalla DLC is out now on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4, less than a week after it was revealed at The Game Awards 2023. It features a good bit of story content that acts as an epilogue to the events of Ragnarok, and it&#x27;s packaged within a roguelite structure, meaning it&#x27;s heavy on combat. Apparently, there&#x27;s an endgame challenge in Valhalla so difficult that nobody on the dev team could complete it on the DLC&#x27;s &quot;Show Me Mastery&quot; difficulty, according to Valhalla&#x27;s director Mihir Sheth. 
&quot;I am so, so curious to see how quickly players will humble us...as they often do...but maybe this time we&#x27;ve beaten them?&quot; Sheth writes on Twitter, as first reported by Wccftech. 
There is an endgame challenge in #GodOfWarRagnarokValhalla that no one on the dev team has completed on the hardest difficulty &#x27;Show Me Mastery&#x27;.
December 12, 2023
God of War  Ragnarök, the sequel to 2018&#x27;s God of War reboot, hit PS5 and PS4 more than a year ago – read Game Informer&#x27;s review to find out why it was one of our favorite games of 2022. While many fans expected some kind of follow-up to the ending of  Ragnarök, be it a sequel down the road or an expansion, it&#x27;s safe to say nobody had roguelite DLC on their bingo cards. But a roguelite DLC called Valhalla is exactly what developer Santa Monica Studios announced last week. Now, God of War Ragnarok&#x27;s Valhalla DLC is out and apparently has the hardest challenge in the entire series. 
You can watch us tackle the first hour of  God of War Ragnarök: Valhalla in this episode of Game Informer Live.

How could anyone ask you to pick between two iconic tools of ultraviolence. What kind of monster would. Yet we must. What&#x27;s better: Doom&#x27;s shotgun or Doom 2&#x27;s super shotgun?

                              <span>Othercide from French developer Lightbulb Crew is one of my favourite recent tactics RPGs. It&#x27;s an atmospheric and rewardingly meticulous experience that typically pits you against overwhelming numbers, where victory comes about by carefully exploiting reaction abilities, positioning your troop of weary warriors just-so, and manipulating the initiative bar. At times, for me, it&#x27;s up there with Into The Breach.
But I do acknowledge that it&#x27;s an acquired taste, not least because the narrative and extra-dimensional setting are relentlessly unpleasant - a terrible soup of mother metaphors and Penny Dreadful imagery, in which you pit clones against Silent Hill monsters, then liquefy the survivors to spawn new characters. What&#x27;s the appropriate way to follow up a game like that? Ah yes, with an episodic dating sim.

                              <span>Revealed during last week&#x27;s Geoffening, Exodus is the first game from Archetype Entertainment, a new studio that includes former members of BioWare and Naughty Dog. It&#x27;s a sci-fi odyssey with third-person shooting that looks and sounds a lot like Mass Effect, but it has one differentiating Big Idea (aside from Matthew McConaughey): time dilation, whereby time passes different in different places, depending on relative velocity and local gravity.

                              <span>Back in May when I first played Ubisoft&#x27;s new Metroid-like Prince Of Persia game, The Lost Crown, ahead of its reveal at this year&#x27;s Summer Game Fest, I got to sample several hours&#x27; worth of some of the early areas inside its cursed mountaintop citadel of Mount Qaf. Some of protagonist Sargon&#x27;s powers had been unlocked early to give us a taste of his abilities, and on the whole, I had an exceedingly good time with it. One thing was missing though, and that was any kind of narrative framing for why Sargon was here in the first place. Sure, we&#x27;d been told ahead of time that Sargon&#x27;s main mission in The Lost Crown is tracking down and saving the eponymous Prince of this game, but I didn&#x27;t actually see any of this in action. Anything with the slightest whiff of story about it had been expertly excised from that initial demo build, and I was left none the wiser about how those opening hours of The Lost Crown would really play out in the final game.
Now, I&#x27;ve been able to play the game from the beginning, with all the story bits slotted back in and Sargon&#x27;s powers unlocked in the correct order. You may have got a glimpse of some of that stuff in the new trailer released during last week&#x27;s Game Awards. In the space of two minutes, it sets the scene for Sargon&#x27;s rescue mission by first introducing all of his fellow warrior mates, and then seconds later showing how they&#x27;re all at each other&#x27;s throats as they get increasingly turned around in Mount Qaf&#x27;s labyrinth. And oh my, I can practically feel all the inevitable backstabbing from here. It&#x27;s going to be delicious, I can tell, and I can&#x27;t wait to slice them all six ways to Sunday when The Lost Crown comes out in January.

Here, you&#x27;ll find markedly less insight, but a more personal take on why my E3s lay, largely, with others. More than anything, I&#x27;ll miss E3 because I liked watching the original Gametrailers crew react to it live. And I liked watching them form Easy Allies once GT closed and continue the tradition, suiting up and completely losing it to the big reveals.

                              <span>It&#x27;s no surprise to hear that E3 is officially dead. The games industry&#x27;s annual mega-marketing event had been suffering for years, then skipping 2020 due to covid without an online alternative left space for its killers to aggressively expand and make clear quite how redundant E3 had become. On one hand, E3 was a week of misleading marketing, dubious claims, expensive stunts, and empty hype. On the other, the 317 assorted online events replacing E3 are just as bad, and now they sprawl across months. I miss E3. Bring back E3. I&#x27;m sorry, E3. I didn&#x27;t know how good we had it. Please, bring back E3.

                              <span>A good parry mechanic is a kind of redemption. Where blocking - aka holding a button to avoid damage - is a concession to the tedious attritional undertow of many action games, parrying - aka pressing a button on cue to cancel damage and often, prep a counter - is the act of cutting through the bullshit. It passively reduces any and all visual and thematic overwhelm the game would have you experience to a question of timing. 


In the face of a good parry mechanic, the grandest of bosses are equivalent to rank-and-file mobs. You&#x27;re a monster the size of a building? You&#x27;re the demonic manifestation of a protagonist&#x27;s mother issues? You&#x27;re capitalism incarnate? You&#x27;re wielding eight chainsaws at once? Ehhh. I&#x27;m not just going to survive your onslaught. I&#x27;m going to dismiss it. All of it: your absurd DPS, your multiple elemental modifiers, your screen-blanketing special effects, your overcooked core concept, the very laws of physics - poof, gone, as though they had never been. Blocking is akin to maintaining a poker face while you&#x27;re being harangued by your boss over Zoom. Parrying is politely pointing out that your boss has left his camera on, and that he should probably wear trousers when he&#x27;s at work. It is &quot;nope&quot; said so quietly that it shuts everything else up.

Sony are &quot;investigating&quot; these reports and say that &quot;they have no reason to believe that any other SIE or Sony divisions have been impacted&quot;, which reads to me like an acknowledgement that the leaks are legit. Colour that speculation for the moment, however.

                              <span>&quot;Consider yourself warned! This book contains scenes of graphic violence!&quot; These are the words that adorn the Doom comic book, which was originally released for promotional purposes during 1996&#x27;s E3 by GT Interactive and Marvel Comics. &quot;Knee-deep in the dead!&quot; is the next bit of text below the logo, referencing the name of the first shareware Doom episode and beautifully describing the blood-soaked cover illustration by Tom Grindberg, who was apparently tickled enough at the thought of drawing this monstrosity to take time away from working on 2000 AD.
The cover is an accurate peek at the gore and demonic entrails that lie within this epic work of sequential storytelling, which required the writing skills of not one, but two gentlemen - Steve &quot;Body Bag&quot; Behling and Michael &quot;Splatter&quot; Stewart. Both Behling and Stewart have a decent body of work between them at Marvel, where they&#x27;ve penned more civilised fare starring the likes of Ant-Man and The Hulk. The Doom comic, in comparison, seems to have been a thing that was written in a fever dream, and DoomWorld, which lovingly hosts scans of this brisk read to this day, describes it appropriately: &quot;Some time in 1996 a couple of guys got together and smoked what was apparently a large amount of crack and then injected pure heroin into their eyes and then proceeded to create what is now known only as &#x27;the Doom comic.&#x27;&quot;

                              <span>Legendary-tier monster cards on the table time: I do not like video game loot. I think that the popularity of &quot;looting&quot;, an English word itself looted from Hindi during the time of the East India Company, is one of the worst aspects of the modern games industry and especially of the blockbuster live service game, which strives to keep its audience coming back by means of fresh loot injections at regular intervals.
I distrust how the randomisation element of much video game looting flirts with actual gambling mechanics. I hate that structuring games around the acquisition of loot creates a framework and an appetite for microtransactions and arguably, NFTs. But I am kind of fascinated by the art of designing loot, and especially when it comes to action RPGs such as Diablo 4 and Path Of Exile 2, because it seems to trade on some irresolvable contradictions.

                              <span>Open your map in Starfield and you won&#x27;t see much more than a height map, even in cities. If you want to then travel around, you&#x27;re limited to walking huge distances when on planet surfaces and using fast travel spaceship hops when in outerspace.

Both these things might change next year, as Bethesda have teased that they&#x27;re working on &quot;many new features&quot; that players have asked for, including city maps and &quot;new ways of traveling&quot;.

                              <span>Epic have won a victory in their attempt to argue that Google violates antitrust laws, as a jury has agreed that the Google Play app store and Google Play Billing service constitute an illegal monopoly. The decision comes three years after Epic first attempted to bypass Apple and Google when selling in-app purchases within Fortnite, leading to the game being yoinked from both the Apple and Google app stores and Epic filing lawsuits against both tech giants.

                              <span>The videogame union ZeniMax Workers United have come to a &quot;tentative&quot;, &quot;first of its kind&quot; agreement with ZeniMax parent company Microsoft over the company&#x27;s usage of the latest &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; tools in the workplace. As part of the agreement, ZeniMax will &quot;provide notice to the union in cases where AI implementation may impact the work of union members&quot; and the union will be able to &quot;bargain those impacts&quot; where they feel it necessary. It seems genuinely historic, to me: a tech company formally giving their workforce a say on the adoption of tools that continue to feel like  a pretext for efficiency-minded &quot;restructuring&quot;.

                              <span>Two years ago, developers Fntastic debuted their &quot;open world survival MMO&quot; The Day Before with a fairly lengthy trailer (which has since been scrubbed from their official YouTube channel, but it&#x27;s been preserved by IGN and Gamespot). It shows a couple of players scavenging a post-pandemic American city slick with detailed lighting effects and reactive zombie hordes. There&#x27;s crafting, cracked glass, and even a horror tease as a player peers around a corridor with a torch. It was an MMO that promised a mixture of The Last Of Us and The Division, and it quickly became the most wishlisted game on Steam.
Now, days after releasing into early access, developers Fntastic have shut down and you can&#x27;t purchase the game anymore. Does it come as a surprise? Not really, considering the final product wasn&#x27;t what they promised - not even close. Instead of an MMO, it was barely an extraction shooter. Consider my words below a record of a rancid time had across its short-lived early access release, then. A time when I would&#x27;ve rather handed a stinging nettle £40 to line my socks than spend another minute in this empty husk.

                              <span>Of course I was going to insert myself into the recent Tribes 3: Rivals alpha playtest – as a Tribes: Ascend player who’s mourned its demise for years, the reveal of a new, heavily Ascend-inspired ski-shooter was like seeing a long deceased pet rabbit miraculously come back to life. Cured, judging from Rivals’ more palatable monetisation plans, of the myxomatosis that killed it in the first place.


From what I played, Tribes 3 can definitely bring back happy memories of zipping around, nicking flags and copping Spinfuser blasts, and the finished article may well have the chops to create some new ones. At the same time, the playtest build was conspicuously short on much of what makes Tribes really feel like Tribes.

                              <span>The party poppers are out, the finger food is ready and waiting to be served, and the guest list for Doom&#x27;s 30th birthday party is well and truly set. Well, it would be if Doomguy ever lowered the drawbridge to his flying space castle high above the Earth&#x27;s orbit. I did try and get a radio signal out earlier, but the grumpy sod never responded. Probably too busy organising his trophy case in his man cave, to be honest. But let&#x27;s face it. Doomguy wouldn&#x27;t be much fun at a birthday party anyway. He&#x27;d be too busy ripping and tearing into his presents to give anyone the time of day, let alone a polite thank you, and then he&#x27;d be working on ripping and tearing apart said presents in a display of strength and machismo. 
So Doom&#x27;s hellspawn have got together to throw their own party for the occasion, and let me tell you, they&#x27;re having a riotous good time all by themselves. Well, most of them are, anyway, as there are some demons here that wouldn&#x27;t know how to have fun even if was seared across their skulls with the beam of a BFG9000. Here&#x27;s every classic Doom enemy ranked on a scale of the most miserable wallflowers to the life and (undead) soul of the party.

                              <span>Whatboy and Paradox Interactive&#x27;s 4X spin-off Stellaris Nexus has boldly gone where many other games have gone before and entered early access. Apologies, I realise that reference is more appropriate to Paradox&#x27;s other recent strategy release, Star Trek: Infinite, but I don&#x27;t know the Stellaris fiction well enough to think of an appropriate in-joke. If you are similarly lacking in Stellaris knowledge, please rejoice in the fact that Nexus is a stripped-down, sped-up, turn-based version of the legendary space sim, which emphasises snappy tactical and strategic relationships over backstory.

                              <span>New Blood Interactive have released a free HD DLC remaster for their reputation-making retro FPS Dusk, almost five years to the day since the original shooter launched on Steam. Honestly, the idea of remastering an alt-history &quot;199X&quot;-style homage to Half-Life and Doom does a number on my sense of time - which multiversal branch are we in now? Still, those gibbable demon Klansters certainly look swish. Find a comparison trailer below:

                              <span>The BeStreamWise anti-piracy campaign run by Sky, Premier League, FACT, ITV, CrimeStoppers, and the UK Intellectual Property Office, aims to deter piracy by linking illegal streaming services with criminality and malware. In an ironic twist, multiple security vendors are flagging the campaign&#x27;s website for suspected suspicious activity. On closer inspection, this unusual and unlikely situation may pre-date the campaign&#x27;s official launch.

                              <span>Mouse, an upcoming classic first-person shooter sporting a vintage rubber hose animation style, turned heads in May with its first look at gameplay. Although that initial showing was very much a work in progress, today’s video offers a more polished look at what’s to come.
The noir game stars a private-eye rodent cleaning up his corruption-riddled city by using his trusty tommy gun to mow down scores of mouse gangsters in cartoonishly violent fashion. Additionally, we get a look at other lethal methods, such as tossing dynamite, shooting down pianos to crash on top of foes, or just knocking goons&#x27; heads off with a good punch. Between all of that, the mouse protagonist consumes spinach and tea for presumably health while engaging in other activities such as collecting baseball cards and chatting with characters.
Mouse is the debut title from developer Fumi Games, and the trailer ends with the reveal of a 2025 release window. 


Mouse is slated to come to PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC. It joins the growing ranks of confirmed 2025 titles such as Grand Theft Auto VI, Monster Hunter: Wilds, Big Walk, Usual June, and Pony Island 2: Panda Circus.</span>

There&#x27;s never been a better time to get into Ace Attorney. Developer-publisher Capcom has spent the last few years remastering and re-releasing every game in the series, and with the Apollo Justice trilogy, you can now play every mainline game on modern consoles. And even though the three games in this collection are unchanged story-wise, after going hands-on, we can comfortably say that they&#x27;ve never felt better.

After reports in November indicated that Free Radical Design, the team behind the TimeSplitters franchise that had been reformed in 2021 to create a new entry in the series, was facing a complete shutdown, the studio closure happened yesterday. Game Informer reached out to Free Radical Design parent company Embracer Group for a comment on the closure – it pointed us to the following LinkedIn post by Plaion, which owns Free Radical Design. 
&quot;It&#x27;s with a heavy heart that we must announce yet another difficult decision,&quot; the post reads. &quot;Today, we have to confirm the official closure of Free Radical Design, and say goodbye to many remarkable, talented, and hard-working people. We are beyond grateful for their incredible contributions to Plaion and wish them the best of luck…</span>

                              <span>The Entertainment Software Association announced today that E3 is officially dead. After more than two decades, the long-running video game conference where developers, publishers, businesses, and press met to check out new games, watch reveals, and more, has been permanently canceled. 
The first E3 took place in 1995 and the last in-person conference happened in 2019. The 2020 event was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but E3 returned for one last bout in 2021 with an all-digital event. The 2022 show was canceled, and this year&#x27;s event, which was set to happen with ReedPop, was canceled as well.

                              <span>The Entertainment Software Association has announced that its long-running Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) is officially dead, as reported by The Washington Post. The last in-person E3 conference happened in 2019 before the COVID-19 pandemic and other complications prevented it from coming back in full form since. Despite struggles, the ESA attempted to bring E3 back in various ways. 
It was canceled in 2020 as a result of the pandemic; the 2021 E3 was an all-digital event; the 2022 show was canceled, and this year&#x27;s attempt with PAX organizer ReedPop was canned, too.

&quot;After more than two decades of hosting an event that has served as a central showcase for the U.S. and global video game industry, the Entertainment Software Association has decided to bring E3 to a close,&quot; ESA president and CEO Stanely Pierre-Louis told The Washington Post. &quot;We know the entire industry, players and creators alike have a lot of passion for E3. We share the passion. We know it&#x27;s difficult to say goodbye to such a beloved event, but it&#x27;s the right thing to do given the new opportunities our industry has to reach fans and partners.&quot; 
Pierre-Louis told The Washington Post that E3&#x27;s closure means video games and the surrounding business &quot;has blossomed in different ways,&quot; noting that any of the major game companies can create their own individual showcases. He&#x27;s likely alluding to the format popularized by Nintendo with its Nintendo Directs, which other publishers like Xbox and PlayStation utilize now. &quot;That&#x27;s exciting for our industry, and it means it&#x27;s an opportunity for them to explore how to engage new audiences in different ways.&quot; 
For a recap of the history of E3, read The Washington Post&#x27;s full story here. For a look at the event&#x27;s recent cancellation, read our E3 breakdown here.

Following the events of Tekken 7, the stage for Tekken 8’s story is set up to be perhaps the most over-the-top yet. In the six months since the defeat of Heihachi Mishima, his son, Kazuya Mishima, has installed a reign of terror over the planet using his devil powers. And while the setup is, quite frankly, a lot to take in, if the first four chapters I played are any indication, the level of spectacle and bombast reaches new levels in Tekken 8’s Story Mode.
The first chapter opens with Lars Alexandersson on a high-tech plane. He mentions the mission is to take down &quot;evi…</span>

The company, which is also behind the Transformers franchise (toys and other media),  announced this decision yesterday, on December 11. 
Hasbro CEO Chris Cocks called the need for layoffs in an email sent to staff a &quot;lever we must pull to keep Hasbro healthy&quot; and &quot;a last resort.&quot; As noted by Dicebreaker, Cocks became CEO of Hasbro in February of last year and earns roughly $1.5 million in salary in the position – his total earnings for 2022 amounted to $9.4 million, however.

                              <span>Terra Nil, the &quot;reverse city builder&quot; from developer Free Lives and publisher Devolver Digital, is coming to Switch next week. More specifically, it will hit the Nintendo console on December 18, as revealed in a new trailer you can watch below. 
While many simulation games task you with creating a new metropolis or saving a colony of humans from post-apocalyptic conditions, Terra Nil instead tasks you with saving nature from climate change and the effects of humans. Instead of building roadways and buildings, you build windmills, calcifiers, and more. 


As you can see, Terra Nil is not only a unique spin on the simulation genre, but a pretty one. It&#x27;s sure to pop on Nintendo Switch OLED models, too, if you have one. 
If you&#x27;re unsure whether or not the game is for you, read Game Informer&#x27;s Terra Nil review to learn what we thought about it. Listen to us talk more about it on this episode of The Game Informer Show after that.

Fntastic, the studio behind The Day Before, announced yesterday that it was shutting down. It said at the time that servers for the game, which launched last week on December 7, would remain operational but that the future of The Day Before is unknown. Now, less than 24 hours later, The Day Before is no longer available for purchase on Steam (although you can still visit the page). 
Plus, anyone who purchased the game is eligible for a refund, according to Fntastic. 
&quot;Answer to those who ask for a refund,&quot; a Fntastic tweet reads. &quot;[We and publisher Mytona are] currently working with Steam to allow refunds for any player who chooses to request one, regardless of the game time. Fntastic received $0 and will receive nothing from The Day Before sales.&quot;

                              <span>Less than a week after The Day Before’s disastrous launch on PC, following multiple delays and becoming the most wishlisted game on Steam, the makers of the zombie-survival shooter have announced their closure.

                              <span>Viral Steam hit Lethal Company is no stranger to mixing the scary with the slapstick, as anyone who’s been dispatched with a ladder to the head or eaten by a fire exit knows. The co-op scrap scavenging game’s absurd humour might just have peaked though, thanks to one of the funniest additions I’ve ever seen in a PC game.

While we’re yet to get a release date, development of FF16 on PC clearly continues apace, as the game’s producer has teased a few more details - including the fact you’ll need an SSD to play.

                              <span>Banishers: Ghosts Of New Eden is a game of twos. It has two protagonists and two broad ways of playing, leading to two broad narrative outcomes, and is created by a company who, as Don’t Nod’s lead narrative designer Elise Galmard explained to me at a preview event, feel like they make games for two different audiences - fans of noodly narrative intrigues on the one hand, and of fantasy combat games on the other. Among the game&#x27;s challenges, of course, is to blend these halves convincingly.
A spiritual (hah) follow-up of sorts to 2018’s fairly well-received Vampyr, it takes place in the alt-historical realm of New Eden, which is kind of 17th century colonial North America through the lens of Dragon Age: Inquisition with a pinch of Hellblade: Senua&#x27;s Sacrifice. The titular Banishers are a ghost-hunting couple, the Scotsman Red MacRaith and the Cuban Antea Duarte. Antea is killed at the very beginning of the game, during a battle with an especially noxious spook, but she soon returns as a spirit, and your overall story objective is to either resurrect her body or help her &quot;Ascend&quot; to the afterlife.

                              <span>AMD&#x27;s Ryzen 7 7800X3D is the best value gaming CPU by a wide margin, as it manages to overpower the Intel Core i9 14900K regularly while costing nearly half the price. Perhaps it&#x27;s unsurprising then that a major German PC retailer recorded the 7800X3D as massively outselling any other processor on the market as of late. 
As of today, the best prices available in the UK and US are at Overclockers (£330) and Amazon ($358). Both retailers offer the CPU with a free copy of the truly stunning Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora game.

                              <span>In just over a month&#x27;s time, the entire mainline Ace Attorney series will finally be playable on PC with the arrival of the Apollo Justice Trilogy. Launching on January 25th 2024, this collection bundles together the fourth, fifth and sixth games in Capcom&#x27;s excellent lawyer &#x27;em up - Apollo Justice, Dual Destinies and Spirit Of Justice - which originally launched on the Nintendo DS and 3DS across a ten year period between 2007 and 2016. It&#x27;s been funny revisiting the earlier cases of these games after so much time has passed. Apollo&#x27;s name may be the one on the box, but the series&#x27; original cover star Phoenix Wright is never far from the front lines - not only does he get tangled up on the wrong side of the law in Apollo&#x27;s own debut outing, but he&#x27;s back as a full-time defence attorney on the (w)right side of the legal bench in the other two. 
At the time, poor old Apollo always felt like he got the short end of the stick as Capcom tried to figure out what to do with the series, and to some extent, he still does - for he never quite gets out from under Phoenix&#x27;s shadow to completely hold court on his own two feet. But now, after 2021&#x27;s excellent Great Ace Attorney Chronicles proved that neither time, setting or its lead defence need to be set in stone for the series to carry on, the pressure does feel ever so slightly less intense on a second visit. There&#x27;s no denying Apollo still has a bit of an uphill climb on his hands, but if, like me, you&#x27;ve been waiting for these games to be freed from their Nintendo-bound prison, this is arguably the best glow-up Capcom&#x27;s done to the series to date.

                              <span>Every weekend, indie devs show off current work on Twitter&#x27;s #screenshotsaturday tag. And every Monday, I bring you a selection of these snaps and clips. This week, like many weeks, my head is full of Metal Gear Rising&#x27;s RULES OF NATURE. But unlike most weeks, it feels relevant. This week I saw an indie game where you slow-mo slice weapons and armour off robots in a forest and oh, that&#x27;s doubly rules of nature right there. Plenty of other attractive and interesting indie games are about too, come have a look!

                              <span>Doom turns 30 this year, and that&#x27;s a cause for celebration. There are many reasons to commemorate id Software&#x27;s 1993 jaunt through the demon-infested corridors of Mars, from the fact that you can play it on every device known to man to its undying modding scene that even lets you pet Cacodemons. But I have a personal connection with Doom that&#x27;s a bit special. It&#x27;s the first game that made me so sick I wanted to puke.

                              <span>A year or two ago I interviewed an actual, practising witch, the wonderful Damien Crawford of Purgatory Dungeoneer fame, about how videogames represent magic. I badly need Crawford&#x27;s thoughts on Emberstorm Entertainment&#x27;s Reka, published by Fireshine Games, which has just been slapped with a Steam early access release window of Q2 2024.
In this curious, moody survival-ish adventure, you&#x27;re an apprentice witch who travels about the land in a chicken-legged cottage loaned out by your mentor, the Baba Jaga. The cottage isn&#x27;t just mobile - you can expand it with second-floor extensions and decorate the interior with jaunty wooden furniture. Sadly, there doesn&#x27;t appear to be an option to employ gingerbread during construction, nor can you currently fly about on broomstick, but perhaps all that&#x27;ll be added on the road to 1.0. Here&#x27;s the latest trailer.

The Maw tends to be at low ebb over the Xmas period, because it has a violent allergy to festive cheer. But for the moment, it still clamours for News.


Some game releases we&#x27;re pondering this week: squad-based RTS Stargate: Timekeepers (12th Dec), Settlers spiritual follow-up Pioneers of Pagonia (13th Dec, early access), anime chainsaw metroidvania Cookie Cutter (14th Dec), &quot;pixel pulp&quot; visual novel Bahnsen Knights (14th Dec), and multiversal metroidvania Trinity Fusion (15th Dec).

                              <span>Hogwarts Legacy hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC back in February – you can read Game Informer&#x27;s Hogwarts Legacy review here. Now, as 2023 comes to a close, Google has released the top 10 trending searches in games on Google over the year and in the top slot is Hogwarts Legacy.

While many were likely searching for new trailers, gameplay, and information about the game, there&#x27;s no doubt some of the Google searching for this game stems from Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling&#x27;s inflammatory statements about the trans community. Publisher Warner Bros. Interactive says Rowling was not involved with the creation of Hogwarts Legacy, which was developed by Avalanche, but given it&#x27;s based on the Harry Potter franchise she created, she undoubtedly made money off of it. Nonetheless, it was the subject of many top trending searches on Google. 
As for what that means, Google describes it like so: &quot;This data shows the top trending searches in the U.S., which means the &#x27;trending&#x27; inquiries are the searches that had such a high spike in traffic over a sustained period in 2023 as compared to 2022.&quot; 
With that in mind, here&#x27;s the top 10 trending searches in the U.S. for games on Google in 2023: 
Hogwarts Legacy – Our Review
Connections (if you, like me, didn&#x27;t know what this was, it&#x27;s a New York Times word grouping puzzle game)

Starfield – Our Review
Diablo IV – Our Review
The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom – Our Review
Atomic Heart – Our Review

And here are the top 10 trending searches in the world for games on Google in 2023: 
Hogwarts Legacy

                              <span>Developer Dlala Studios and publisher Walt Disney Games released Disney Illusion Island, a 2D Metroidvania-esque platformer, exclusively on Switch earlier this year. It was nominated for Best Family Game at The Game Awards 2023 – check out all the winners here – and now, Dlala has revealed it is launching new content this week. 
More specifically, the Keeper Up update will go live in Disney Illusion Island for free on Wednesday, December 13. It includes new time trial challenges, quality of life updates like an improved map, and more. 

&quot;In this fast-paced new experience, players must try and beat the clock and show off their parkour prowess, thanks to a set of new challenges arranged by the &#x27;Mavens of Monoth,&#x27; a group of &#x27;old Monoth&#x27; enthusiasts who want to see if anyone knows how to navigate these lands better (and faster) than them,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;Upon entering a course, a timer will tick away as players scramble to grab collectibles through remixed areas of the world, making their way to the finish line in the best time possible.&quot; 
Elsewhere in the Keeper Up update, Dlala studios says Disney Illusion Island will receive &quot;a host of quality of life updates, including new accessibility features, new gallery unlocks, and an updated map.&quot; 
Disney Illusion Island is available exclusively on Switch, and the new Keeper Update goes live this week on December 13.

                              <span>“When people read anything, no matter the source, they will believe it.” So says Doom designer John Romero on the subject of his relationship with John Carmack. Together, the pair built id Software and the FPS genre as we know it - before the cracks started to show during the difficult development of Quake, ending their professional partnership.
Yet any lasting acrimony has now dissipated. That became apparent when Romero’s new autobiography, ‘Doom Guy: Life In First Person’, showed up on shelves with a glowing back cover quote from Carmack. The latter praised Romero’s “remarkable memory”, and waxed wistfully about their shared impact on the gaming medium. “For years, I thought that I had been born too late and missed out on participating in the heroic eras of computing,” Carmack wrote. “Only much later did I realise that Romero and I were at the nexus of a new era - the 3D game hackers.”

                              <span>32 inches. That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m looking for in a gaming monitor, but normally screens of this size are just expensive. As you may have guessed from the title though, you can pick up a 32-inch LG gaming monitor for just $187 today, nearly half its original price. 
That&#x27;s a wicked deal for the LG 32GN600, a VA-panel monitor with excellent contrast, a 2560x1440 resolution and 165Hz refresh rate with FreeSync and G-Sync support.

There has been some negative feedback, however, from players upset that player movement is now slower than it was during the beta.

Except, it&#x27;s not slower, say the developers - there have been no changes to the movement system at all. Instead they&#x27;re investigating why it apparently feels slower, and say they&#x27;ve found the culprits.

That&#x27;s £30 below its UK RRP and a fantastic deal for a mouse that offers both 2.4GHz wireless and Bluetooth connectivity plus an 18K optical sensor and a comfortable symmetric shape.

                              <span>Recently I helped a friend spec out a gaming PC to play Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 and other triple-A releases, and we opted for a machine with an RTX 4070 Ti graphics card as that fit within her £2000 budget and allows for excellent performance with gaming monitors up to 4K while leaving enough cash free for a high-end CPU and other nice components. 
Today though, you can pick up a pre-built RTX 4070 Ti gaming PC for way less than that - just £1299 - when you get it from Stormforce Gaming in the UK. This build includes a 12th-gen Core i5 processor, 16GB of DDR4 memory, a 1TB PCIe 4.0 NVMe SSD and a 750W power supply, all for £500 off its listed price.

Most of what everyone is playing this weekend is &#x27;being asleep&#x27;, I assume, although those of us who will be awake have a bit of a variety this week.

                              <span>Around 50 record labels, all members of the RIAA, have filed a mass copyright infringement lawsuit against Altice, owner of U.S. ISP Optimum. Filed in a Texas district court, the complaint focuses on Altice&#x27;s alleged failure to take action against customers the plaintiffs describe as &#x27;repeat infringers&#x27;. Last December, a group of music rightsholders including BMG, UMG, and Capitol filed a substantially similar lawsuit against Altice at the same court.

                              <span>During The Game Awards, we learned that The Outlast Trials is wrapping up its time in PC early access and is heading to consoles next March. The game was first announced in 2019 and entered Steam Early Access in May. 
The game is a co-op take on the popular horror series, with up to four players controlling test subjects fighting to survive in a dangerous test facility. Check out its latest trailer below (headphone users beware: it&#x27;s got a lot of shrieking streamers). 


The 1.0 launch will include a new Toy Factory trial with new MK challenges. It will also feature new evidence documents, character customization, cell decorations, legendary outfits, an increased level cap, weekly programs, and other quality-of-life improvements. 
The game will be sold alone in a $39.99 Standard Edition and a $49.99 Deluxe Edition that includes the Regent Start Pack, giving players four legendary skins, exclusive cell items, posters, and player icons. 
The Outlast Trials launches on March 5 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.</span>

                              <span>Alan Wake 2 hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on October 27, but shortly before its release, developer Remedy Entertainment revealed that it would be getting a New Game Plus mode with an alternative narrative and nightmare difficulty, amongst other things. During The Game Awards 2023 last night, Remedy, which picked up three wins during the show, revealed that &quot;The Final Draft&quot; update, which includes the aforementioned New Game Plus mode, goes live next week. 
More specifically, The Final Draft hits Alan Wake 2 on Monday, December 11. It features a new ending to the story of Alan Wake that Remedy says will spark speculation and theory crafting among its most dedicated fans. Plus, there&#x27;s new lore to find in the form of new videos and manuscript pages. 


&quot;Players will retain all Weapons, Charms, and character upgrades earned during their first playthrough,&quot; a blog post about The Final Draft reads. &quot;They should come in handy when you seek the ultimate challenge of trying out the new Nightmare Difficulty level. Brace yourselves for intensified enemies, strategic gameplay, and an adrenaline-pumping experience that will push your skills to the limit.&quot; 
You will find all of your unlocked weapons in the first available shoebox for the characters, so don&#x27;t expect to immediately start the game with all of your weaponry. 
Remedy says The Final Draft update also includes numerous bug fixes and slight performance optimizations that will be further detailed in the complete update notes, which go live alongside the update on Monday. 
The Final Draft update for Alan Wake 2 goes live at 10 a.m. PT/1 p.m. ET on Monday, December 11, on all platforms where you can play the game.

                              <span>The Game Awards 2023 was a massive night for games, with more than 30 announcements, premieres, and more. It ended with developer Larian Studios taking home the Game of the Year award for its critically acclaimed RPG, Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3. Shortly after the win, Larian revealed that the game was now available on Xbox Series X/S, meaning it&#x27;s finally playable on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.
 

Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 director Swen Vincke tweeted, &quot;I had one job and that was to announce this if we won an award – sorry all but happy it&#x27;s out there,&quot; meaning this might have been meant to be an on-stage announcement. Nonetheless, everyone&#x27;s happy Vincke and the team took the extra time to praise its team of developers and thank fans for the reception during the Game of the Year award acceptance speech instead. 
Xbox players, it’s party time.

                              <span>Mecha Break is an new multiplayer co-op mech game by Seasun Games that premiered during The Game Awards tonight. Fans of games like Armored Core VI and Zone of the Enders may want to keep it on their radar. 
The game puts you in the cockpit of a variety of mech suits, which you can customize the look and weapons of, to take on other players across a variety of modes. The biggest battlefield is a 48-player battle royale. If you’d rather play alongside friends, a co-op option allows three-to-six players to team up to complete specialized missions. Other destinations include a 3v3 arena mode and a 6v6 battlefield mode. See the game in action below.


Mecha Break currently has no release window or announced platforms.</span>

                              <span>As Dusk Falls, the narrative adventure game about two families linked together by a burglary gone wrong, hit Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC in July of last year. More than a year later, developer Interior/Night is bringing the game to PlayStation, but you&#x27;ll have to wait just a bit longer to play it.
That&#x27;s because As Dusk Falls hits PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 on March 7, 2024. Interior/Night announced this news during The Game Awards 2023 tonight. It will also launch on the Epic Games Store and GOG on PC the same day. The studio released a new trailer to celebrate the announcement, and you can check it out for yourself below:


This new PS5 version of As Dusk Falls includes new exclusive features like haptic feedback and touchpad controls. Plus, a new audio description accessibility feature will be available on all platforms in March.
&quot;In this uncompromising crime drama of betrayal, sacrifice, and resilience, players explore the entangled lives of two families across decades, starting in 1998 with a robbery gone wrong in small-town Arizona,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;The story can be replayed to discover the vastly different outcomes depending on the decisions taken. As Dusk Falls has an innovative multiplayer mode supporting up to 8 players locally, online, or as a combination of both, using controllers or the companion app for Android or iOS.&quot; 
As Dusk Falls won the Games For Impact award at last year&#x27;s Game Awards. For more about the game, read Game Informer&#x27;s As Dusk Falls review.

                              <span>Despite claiming that it had no plans to release DLC for Final Fantasy XVI, Square Enix announced at The Game Awards that Final Fantasy XVI is getting not one but two pieces of DLC. They&#x27;re called Echoes of the Fallen and Rising Tide, and the former is available to play right now.
Echoes of the Fallen adds new story chapters that takes place before the finale of Final Fantasy XVI. Clive and the gang follow the origins of a mysterious crystal to a strange ruin filled with deadly defenses tied to Eikons and plenty of monsters. Rising Tide is set to launch in Spring 2024 and is a bit more mysterious, but we do see Clive taking on what may be the scariest enemy in all of Final Fantasy: Tonberry King. Oh, and Leviathan pops up too. 


You can purchase each DLC separately or together for a discount in an expansion pass. You can read our review of Final Fantasy XVI here.</span>

                              <span>The Game Awards are packed with eager looks at highly anticipated games, but the ceremony is full of plenty of surprises too. One of them is a flashy Metroidvania called Tales of Kenzera: Zau, the debut game from Surgent Studios.
Zau is a boy on a quest to bring his father back from the dead. Guided by Kalunga, the God of Death, he uses his ability as a warrior shaman to defeat the ancestral spirits that roam the land of Kenzera. His main tools are a pair of magical masks; with the Moon mask he can manipulate time and crystalize enemies, and the Sun mask allows him to launch fiery spears. Studio founder Abubakar Salim says that the two masks are reminiscent of the Devil May Cry series with the way they allow the player to flip between ranged and melee modes.

The world is inspired by Bantu lore and imagery, with bright colors and mythical beasts. Additionally, the game will be scored by Nainita Desai, a British composer who made the music for Half Mermaid&#x27;s Telling Lies and Immortality.
Salim founded Surgent in 2019, but most gamers would currently recognize him as the voice of Bayek from Assassin&#x27;s Creed Origins. According to him, the passing of his father motivated him to create a new project – he wanted to tell a story of grief in the form of a video game. With assistance from the Ridley Scott Creative Group and Critical Role, five years later, Tales of Kenzera: Zau tells that story.
The trailer ended with the news that Tales of Kenzera: Zau will be coming to PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC on April 23, 2024.</span>

                              <span>A new law passed in Italy during the summer promised a new dawn in the war against pirate IPTV providers.

                              <span>DNS-resolver Quad9 has won its appeal against Sony Music&#x27;s pirate site-blocking order at the Higher Regional Court in Dresden. The non-profit Quad9 Foundation no longer has to block pirate sites. The court concluded that it can&#x27;t be held liable, since DNS resolvers don&#x27;t play a central role in copyright infringing activities. Meanwhile, trouble is brewing in Italy.

                              <span>For many years, the GOG.com affiliate program has been a great way to support the project. By using our affiliate links to buy your favorite games, you granted us a small commission from GOG.com – without having to spend more than the original price.
Earlier this year, GOG.com announced the discontinuation of its old affiliate program. Instead of using a simple referral link, they are now using two external affiliation networks that contain cross-site tracking, as considered by many ad blockers. Since we have been affiliated with GOG.com since 2009, we were able to use the legacy referral links for a couple of months after they initially discontinued them.
Unfortunately, our affiliate links were put to rest effective November 22nd, 2023.
Since we don&#x27;t feel comfortable that you would have to use external affiliation networks just to support the project, and because tracking users is against our project policies, we decided not to join the new program.
We still value GOG.com as an excellent source for legally purchasing games supported by ScummVM. Even though we are not affiliated with them anymore, we&#x27;ll continue to support their releases, e.g. by adding and updating the game data files&#x27; signatures for the ScummVM supported games that are available for purchase from GOG.com in our detection database and providing links to their releases in our list of available games.
Thank you GOG.com and everybody who used our affiliate link for your support over the last 14 years!
