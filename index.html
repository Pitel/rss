                    <span class="article-reading-time">(2 min)</span>
                    <span>Sony released its quarterly financial results yesterday and in it, CFO Hiroki Totoki revealed that PlayStation plans to launch 10 live service games by March 2026. 
This isn’t surprising, considering the company essentially just invested $3.6 billion in developing live service games by acquiring Bungie earlier this week. However, 10 games is a lot. Ten live service games in four years is very ambitious, but it seems Sony and PlayStation are going to rely on Bungie’s expertise in the genre a lot, not to mention, Bungie has its own original IP in the works too.
“The strategic significance of this acquisition lies not only in obtaining the highly successful Destiny franchise, as well as major new IP Bungie is currently developing, but also incorporating into the Sony group the expertise and technologies Bungie has developed in the live game services space,” Totoki said, as reported by The Verge. “Through close collaboration between Bungie and PlayStation Studios we aim to launch more than 10 live service games by the fiscal year ending March 2026.” 
With all this talk of live service and multiplayer games in light of Sony acquiring Bungie, you might be wondering if PlayStation is shifting away from its focus on single-player, story-driven games. Considering Sony’s first-party studios known for those kinds of games are still around, you’ll likely still be seeing single-player games from PlayStation. With the acquisition of Bungie, it just seems that Sony is using some of its newer studios and expertise to get studios pumping out new live service games. 
In the meantime, catch up on Sony’s acquisition of Bungie and then check out Game Informer’s reactions to that news. Read Game Informer’s Destiny 2: The Witch Queen preview after that.

                    <span>343 Industries revealed last year, before the launch of Halo Infinite, that the game would not ship with campaign co-op or a Forge mode. Halo Infinite creative director Joseph Staten said around that time that an update regarding these two modes, and a seasonal roadmap for the shooter, would arrive in January, but that didn’t happen. 
Staten has now revealed that the planned Halo Infinite update on the game’s seasonal roadmap, co-op, and Forge has been delayed. The reason why is so that the team can have more time to share concrete plans.

“Hey folks,” Staten said in a tweet. “In November, I said we’d have a Halo Infinite update on our seasonal roadmap, co-op, and Forge in January. We need more time to finalize our plans so what we share is something you can rely on. This work is my top priority, and we’ll have an update as soon as we can.” 



Hey folks. In November, I said we&#x27;d have a #HaloInfinite update on our Seasonal roadmap, Co-Op, and Forge in January. We need more time to finalize our plans so what we share is something you can rely on. This work is my top priority, and we&#x27;ll have an update as soon as we can.
February 1, 2022
As for when to expect this update, that’s anybody’s guess as Staten did not further elaborate. Fans noticed this update hadn’t happened when the calendar jumped from January to February but Staten let everyone know that a delay had happened on February 1. Here’s hoping the update comes soon because we can’t wait to jump back into Halo Infinite’s campaign with a co-op partner. 
If you’re waiting for that too, read Game Informer’s Halo Infinite review in the meantime and then read about how Halo Infinite was the series’ biggest launch ever. Check out the changes to the economy of Halo Infinite’s multiplayer store after that.

                    <span>After years and years of waiting, Dying Light 2 Stay Human is almost out and in the hands of players. In fact, it’s already in the hands of some players who have received early retail copies of the zombie parkour sequel. 
If you’re one of those people, Techland really wants you to resist the urge and wait until the game’s proper release on February 4 to play the game. That’s because there’s a Day One patch that will make the experience better.

                    <span>EA’s quarterly results for Q3, which was the three months that ended with December 2021, were released late yesterday and it turns out, it was one of the company’s biggest ever. 
That’s due to steady growth in long-running franchises like Fifa, Madden, and Apex Legends. As reported by GamesIndustry.biz, EA’s revenues were up 7% in Q3, which equates to $1.79 billion and net bookings were also up 7%, to $2.58 billion. However, net income was down 69%, dropping to $66 million.

While Gardens does not have a new game to formally announce just yet, it does say its “core mission is to create vibrant online games that foster meaningful multiplayer moments and relationships between players around the world.” …</span>

                    <span>Cable tied.
Trading has always been a key component of the Pokémon franchise, right the way back to the launch of the original Game Boy games. Nowadays, of course, trading is handled wirelessly, but back in the &#x27;90s we had to use cables to link up consoles and share &#x27;mon – and it&#x27;s that period of time that this recent My Retro Life video focuses on.
In case you haven&#x27;t encountered the channel already, My Retro Life is the work of Tyler Esposito, a filmmaker who has a wealth of home movie footage recorded by his late father. He&#x27;s been sharing these amazing clips for a few years now, and one of his latest looks at the process of trading Pokémon with friends.

                    <span>&quot;We believe a team of diverse voices has the most to say&quot;.
A new studio has just been founded on the West Coast of the United States, but it&#x27;s one that&#x27;s committed to its workers being fully remote, with unlimited paid time off, 35-hour work weeks, and benefits and perks that vary depending on the country in which you work. It&#x27;s called Gardens — and it boasts some great talent already.
The founders, Chris Bell, Lexie Dostal, and Stephen Bell, have credits on Journey, What Remains of Edith Finch, Blaseball, and Dustforce. Other video game veterans have already joined the studio, including Ryan Benno (Spider-Man, The Wolf Among Us, Ratchet and Clank), Sarah Sands (Fullbright), Roldán Melcon (Blaseball, Where Cards Fall), and Leighton Milne (Ashen, The Hobbit).

                    <span>What&#x27;s old is new again (but still old).
Hamster has confirmed that this week&#x27;s Arcade Archives title is Namco&#x27;s 1981 racer, New Rally-X.
Originally released in 1981, New Rally-X improves on the original Rally-X (which is also part of the Arcade Archives series) by showcasing ever-so-slightly better visuals and a new soundtrack. It also has easier gameplay and a few gameplay tweaks, all of which made it more popular in Japan than the first title.

Amid the recent news around Nintendo targeting and taking down soundtracks on YouTube, today brings a slightly cheerier outcome for game music fans. The Pokémon Company has not only uploaded the official soundtrack for the original Pokémon Diamond &amp; Pearl to YouTube, but has created an excellent &#x27;Pokémon DP Sound Library&#x27; website with a variety of features.
On the website (which is under heavy load so may be inconsistent at the time of writing) you can download multiple discs of the official soundtrack, though unsurprisingly in doing so you agree to a lengthy set of terms and conditions. In addition to downloads for your personal use, the site lets you stream the soundtracks and has set up some rather nice playlists; we were listening to the &#x27;Relax&#x27; playlist while typing this. You can even create your own mini playlists if you want.

The latest indie publisher to hop on the Nintendo Direct-like showcase bandwagon (which, for the record, we&#x27;re big fans of) is Chibig, the studio behind Summer in Mara and Deiland: Pocket Planet. Their showcase, which is called &quot;Chibig Presents&quot;, will be livestreamed on their Twitch channel at 4pm GMT, on Wednesday, February 2nd.

                    <span>Switch hit.
Just recently we had the very welcome news that MLB The Show 22 is coming to the Switch in April, alongside the PlayStation and Xbox versions. It&#x27;ll be the first PlayStation Studios title on Switch (it&#x27;s developed by Sony San Diego), though it&#x27;s worth reminding people that this is at the behest of Major League Baseball (MLB); in fact MLB was technically the publisher of last year&#x27;s Xbox version.
In any case, at the top of the page you can see a snazzy animated trailer released to celebrate its cover star Shohei Ohtani, and we&#x27;d bet money that this will also be the opening cinematic in the game. We&#x27;ve also been digging around on the official website to get a feel for how the Switch version will turn out.

                    <span>The Sign of the Eight (Out of Ten).
With an apologetic tip of the long, fancy hat to original author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, we think it&#x27;s fair to say that Sherlock Holmes&#x27; many adaptations have supplanted the original text in terms of prominence. Most luridly, of course, there is Steven Moffat&#x27;s Sherlock, as well as similarly contemporary take Elementary, plus the Robert Downey Jr. Hollywood interpretation. Going back further we have Jeremy Brett and Basil Rathbone&#x27;s iconic portrayals, and who could forget Tantei Opera Milky Holmes?
What we&#x27;re getting at here is that any take on Sherlock Holmes detached from all of these previous presentations is necessarily going to take inspiration from its predecessors and must work hard to find its own identity. Sherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishments feels like a hodge-podge of characterisation and direction, borrowing liberally from the aesthetics of Guy Ritchie&#x27;s efforts while incorporating elements of the BBC Sherlock series for the deduction sequences. And, despite the somewhat unavoidable feeling of unoriginality, it all works rather brilliantly.

It&#x27;s hardly shocking news, but it turns out that everyone and their nan is excited about Shovel Knight studio Yacht Club Games&#x27; new offering, Mina the Hollower.

                    <span>That&#x27;s not how Nintendo usually does business.
The big news of 2022 is industry consolidation – with Microsoft buying Activision and Sony snapping up Bungie, it&#x27;s all about big fish gobbling up the smaller fish. As we discussed yesterday, this isn&#x27;t necessarily something we should be cheering on from the sidelines – but rather predictably, it has kickstarted a discussion surrounding Nintendo and what the Japanese giant&#x27;s response to all of this activity is likely to be.
On one hand, it&#x27;s a perfectly sensible question to ask. As Microsoft and Sony&#x27;s recent actions have proven, being a successful platformer holder is very much down to the unique experiences you can offer your customers – and these same experiences can hopefully tempt other people to invest in your product, be it a console or subscription service. In any competitive marketplace, it&#x27;s very much about offering the best deal to the buyer, and that often leads to the kind of consolidation we&#x27;re seeing.

Taito&#x27;s vertically-scrolling shmup RayForce – known as Layer Section in Japan and Galactic Attack / Gunlock in the west – is coming to Switch, according to a new rating via the Taiwan Digital Game Rating Committee.
Released in 1994, the arcade original was created using Taito&#x27;s F3 arcade hardware and was subsequently ported to the Sega Saturn in 1995. A PC version followed in 1997, and the game came to iOS in 2012 and Android in 2017.

                    <span>&quot;it&#x27;s really not worth it to keep the channel up&quot;.
It turns out last week&#x27;s events were just the beginning - with YouTube video game music channel GilvaSunner announcing they&#x27;ve now been hit with another 2,200 copyright blocks from Nintendo.
The same channel has had a target on its back for some time now, and the latest update follows on from 1,300 takedowns. In a series of messages over on Twitter, the channel&#x27;s creator said they were ready to call it a day and would be deleting the channel, or at least &quot;what&#x27;s left of it&quot; this Friday. More copyright blocks are also expected to follow:

                    <span>With NVIDIA&#x27;s newly-introduced 510 Linux driver series paired with the latest XWayland and a modern Wayland compositor like the newest GNOME/Mutter packages, the NVIDIA (X)Wayland experience is in great shape and delivering comparable performance to a traditional X.Org session. The NVIDIA Wayland support with GBM usage has stabilized and appears to be in good shape for the upcoming Ubuntu 22.04 LTS release.

                    <span>As the consolidation of the games industry continues, Sony buying Bungie is the acquisition that might most directly affect me, someone who has played over 2000 hours of Destiny 2. Bungie have said things will continue as normal on all platforms. But beyond the usual issues with consolidation and platformholders buying studios, the concerns I have for Destiny 2&#x27;s future stem from the same old source: Bungie&#x27;s own decisions. The grind needs to end.

                    <span>Western Digital are continuing their charge into high-speed PCIe 4.0 SSDs with the WD Black SN770. This is pretty straight down the middle as far as Gen 4 SSDs go: the 1TB model I’ve tested claims sequential speeds up to 5150MB/s for reads and 4900MB/s for writes, enough to embarrass any PCIe 3.0 SSD without veering into mega-enthusiast territory. There’s a broad range of capacities too, starting at 250GB and ending at a roomy 2TB.

SCP-173 is part of the SCP Foundation, a collaborative online horror writing project which most famously inspired Remedy&#x27;s Control, and has appeared in several SCP fan games, too. But as SCP&#x27;s administrators wrestle with copyright and morality issues, they&#x27;re preparing to remove that iconic image, which actually is a photo of a sculpture by a Japanese artist.

Plenty of words have been written about Techland’s backfiring boast of a three week runtime, so no need to relitigate that here. Going in, the only time value I was interested in was how long - if ever - the game takes to sink its teeth into you.

Like with Shovel Knight, Yacht Club Games are partially crowdfunding Mina through a Kickstarter campaign, and in less than a day they&#x27;ve already passed the goal. Have a peek in the trailer.

                    <span>Capcom released an &#x27;HD&#x27; remaster of Resident Evil 4 in 2014, but their official makeover is nothing compared to the work by a small team of modders across almost eight years. Their mod, the Resident Evil 4 HD Project, is out now, and I think it&#x27;s the most impressive remaster mod ever made. In replacing the game&#x27;s textures and models with high-def versions, they&#x27;ve tried hard to replicate both the form and the style, and even tracked down locations and objects Capcom had photographed to work into textures. Dead impressive.

                    <span>Yesterday, publisher Team17 announced the MetaWorms NFT project. Basically, the plan was to create NFTs based on its popular Worms license with the help of NFT maker, Reality Gaming Group. Team17 billed these NFTs as environmentally friendly because they were a “side chain” of Ethereum and produced using RGG’s carbon neutral servers. Team17 even had plans to donate a portion of the revenue earned from NFT sales to global sustainability firm Coins 4 Planet and its Refeed Farms initiative, which promotes using worm beds as a cleaner method to process waste. The NFTs themselves were, of course, just various images of Worms characters, which you can see in the header up top.

                    <span>Yacht Club Games, creators of Shovel Knight have announced it&#x27;s working on a new IP called Mina the Hollower, and like her platforming predecessor, Mina looks to build upon some classic inspirations. 
Unveiled during a presentation on G4 this afternoon called Yacht Club Games Presents, Mina the Hollower is a new title that shares elements of The Legend of Zelda and Castlevania. Not straying far from Shovel Knight&#x27;s retro aesthetics, Mina looks like it was ripped from the Game Boy Color era. As Mina, you&#x27;ll be whipping enemies, burrowing into the ground, and equipping various sidearms and trinkets to survive and save a cursed island full of deadly baddies and bosses.
Like Shovel Knight before it, Yacht Club Games is starting a Kickstarter campaign for Mina, but don&#x27;t worry; the studio is fronting most of the funds to make the project a reality. In the press release provided to Game Informer, Director Alec Faulkner spoke about why the Kickstarter is being utilized again, saying, “We want your feedback, collaboration, and support in making Mina the Hollower the best game it can possibly be.&quot; Alec continues, &quot;Though we’re financing a majority of this project ourselves, we hope we can create a more expansive game this way. More importantly, we want to build a community around Kickstarter, much like we did with Shovel Knight. We also want to share our development process, more than ever before!”
To sweeten the deal for backers, Yacht Club is partnering with Fangamer to create physical rewards such as &quot;a physical soundtrack, enamel pins, an art book, and an adorable plush.&quot;
No release date has been given for Mina the Hollower, but we hope to be whipping and digging soon. For more info on the Kickstarter and its backer rewards and goals, head over to the Mina the Hollower project page. Yacht Club still has some Shovel Knight projects in the works, with Shovel Knight Dig on the horizon and updates to Shovel Knight Pocket Dungeon coming soon.</span>

                    <span>Life is Strange was a surprise hit from DontNod way back in 2015 when it was released episodically over the year. Life is Strange: Before the Storm was also a hit, but not so much a surprise because after the original game, we all knew what DontNod and the Before the Storm team, Deck Nine, were capable of. 
Since the 2015 release of Life is Strange, we’ve received two mainline sequels in Life Is Strange 2 and Life is Strange: True Colors. The storylines have become even more branching and naturally, the visuals and performance of the series have improved. Now, those improvements have made their way back to the first two Life is Strange games and both are playable today in the Life is Strange: Remastered Collection.

                    <span>With Pokémon Legends: Arceus hitting Switch last week, and reviewing quite well here at Game Informer, you might be feeling the Pokémon bug. What better way to address it than by adding some new Pop! figures to your Pokédex, err, collection. 
Pop! is well known for its lineup of figures for basically everything and it’s Pokémon collection has been quite popular so it’s no surprise that the company is releasing more. Pop! announced today that three new figures are available for pre-order and if you’re a fan of psychic, fairy, or fighting types, these might be for you.

As you can see in the slideshow above, which features a look at each figure and the box it comes in, the newest Pokémon Pop! offerings are Lucario, Sylveon, and Alakazam. All three are available for preorder and will cost you roughly $12. They&#x27;ll be released on March 15 so you won’t have to wait too much longer if you preorder. Plus, it gives you enough time to evolve your favorite Eevee in Pokémon Legends: Arceus into a Sylveon. 
While waiting for your Lucario, Sylveon, or Alakazam (or all three) to arrive, check out these Pokémon Pop! figures revealed last September. After that, check out our thoughts on Pokémon Legends: Arceus and then read Game Informer’s Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl review.

Should you find yourself obsessing over achievements as I do, I hope this guide serves you well. It&#x27;ll be updated whenever I find a new game that you need to know about.

                    <span>There’s never been a better time to be a fan of pop culture, superheroes and their villainous counterparts, D&amp;D, fantasy books, and just general nerd culture. That’s because some of the world’s most popular licenses are making their way to consoles and PCs this year. These games promise to give us new ways to interact with some of our favorite media franchises like DC, Harry Potter, Star Wars, and more. 
What’s more is that each of these games is not only unique in license, but in gameplay too. That’s because these titles aren’t straddled to just one genre. Hogwarts Legacy is a third-person magic-casting RPG, while MultiVersus is a platform fighter. This list of games covers all kinds of genres and all kinds of licenses, and we can’t wait to check them out sometime this year. Here are Game…</span>

                    <span>Hot on the heels of yesterday’s news that Sony is acquiring Bungie, the studio has released a new Destiny 2: The Witch Queen trailer that’s all about the gear and weapons coming with the new expansion. 
With The Witch Queen, Destiny 2’s latest expansion launching Feburary 22, it’s not surprising that Bungie is ramping up its marketing for it. After a trailer a couple of weeks ago all about Savathun’s Throne World, today, the studio opted to reveal some of the weapons our Guardians will be using later this month.

As you can see in the trailer above, there are a handful of exotic weapons coming to the game, starting with the Grand Overture, a Slug Launcher that charges full auto missiles. There’s also the new Parasite weapon, which is a worm launcher wit…</span>

                    <span>If you consider yourself a diehard Pokémon fan, odds are you already own at least one replica Poké Ball. But there’s no such thing has having too many of them, right? The Pokémon Company and prop replica makers The Wand Company hope you agree because they&#x27;re introducing a new line of premium Poké Balls throughout 2022. 
The Wand Company has previously manufactured upscale replicas of the Poké Ball, Great Ball, Ultra Ball, Dusk Ball, and Premier Ball. This upcoming batch will feature four new balls starting with the Heal Ball. This to-scale replica measures 3.5 x 3.7 x 3.5 in diameter and is made of a die-cast metal shell with a high-gloss lacquer finish. Its coolest feature is its touch/proximity sensor that causes the front button to light up when someone is nearby, and pressing the button triggers the light sequence that occurs when Pokémon are caught. The Heal Ball comes with a matte black display case where it can sit atop a stainless steel display ring. It also includes a manual and three AAA batteries.

If you like what you see, you can pre-order it now from The Pokémon Center store for $99.99. Shipping begins in early April. Replicas of the Friend Ball, Quick Ball and Cherish Ball will launch during the year but have no release dates as of yet.

                    <span>Supermassive Games began its anthology horror series, The Dark Pictures, in 2019 with Man of Medan, and since then, it’s released a new entry every year. Little Hope was released in 2020, and last year, the studio put out House of Ashes. 
The Devil In Me is up to bat next, and that game will serve as the season finale of The Dark Pictures’ first season. The fifth game in the series, Switchback, was semi-revealed through a trademark filing by Supermassive Games. Now, the next five games have been revealed in the same manner. 
What’s interesting is that Supermassive Games has long referred to The Dark Pictures as an eight-game series. These five new trademarks bring the total up to 10. Perhaps Season 2 is a six-game season, or perhaps, a third season is in the works. Only Supermassive Games knows. For now, we have a pretty good idea of what the next five games after Switchback will be, thanks to a new trademark filing spotted by Twitter user The Marmolade, as reported by Gematsu:
The Dark Pictures: Directive 8020
The Dark Pictures: The Craven Man
The Dark Pictures: Intercession
The Dark Pictures: Winterfold
The Dark Pictures: O Death
And here’s a slideshow featuring images of each trademarked logo:

For most of these, it’s tough to piece together exactly what the game is about, which makes sense considering all we know is the possible names. However, some are easier than others. For example, Directive 8020 seems to hint towards a futuristic sci-fi horror game. The Craven Man might be similar to The Wicker Man, or maybe even Jeepers Creepers. 
It might be a while before we learn what each is, so in the meantime, check out our thoughts on the series thus far in Game Informer’s Man of Medan review, Little Hope review, and House of Ashes review.

                    <span>It’s time for the payoff. For years, Bungie has teased the potential of Destiny’s most devious villain. In recent months, that tease has escalated. The Hive queen named Savathûn has infiltrated all the major storylines, insinuating herself into the events shaping the story. Now, at long last, the Witch Queen’s trap is sprung, as she co-opts humanity’s most precious resource – the Light that gives power to its Guardians – and uses that power to make deathless warriors of her own. 
With The Witch Queen, Bungie is betting big on a narrative twist that’s been in the making for a long time and using that storytelling moment to push forward new twists on the long-established gameplay model, including a dramatic move toward playstyle customization for players. On the eve of the expansion’s releas…</span>

                    <span>Update: Titan reached out to Game Informer and provided more details. This series is written by Cullen Bunn, with art by Piotr Kowalski and Brad Simpson. The cover art featured below is by Kowalski.
Original Story: Titan Comics just revealed the cover of a forthcoming Bloodborne comic book that will be released on May 7 for absolutely free. As comic book fans know, the first Saturday in May is Free Comic Book Day. All of the major publishers in the industry are giving away free comic books on this day, and you should be able to walk out of your local shop with a stack of things to read.
This free comic is the first part of a new Bloodborne limited series that will also launch in May. Titan Comics&#x27; official description doesn&#x27;t give us much of a hint of what we can expect from this series: &quot;Enter the city of Yharnam through the eyes of its citizens, when new hunters take to the streets to fight against the cruel and unusual epidemic that has gripped the city. In the black of night, families and faith will be tested.&quot;
This isn&#x27;t Titan&#x27;s first Bloodborne series. The publisher just this month released a box set collecting all of its limited Bloodborne comics. From Software, the developer of the Bloodborne game, is weeks away from releasing its next Souls-like game, Elden Ring. The game is on this month&#x27;s cover of Game Informer Magazine. This coverage extends online where we have nearly a dozen stories or looks at the game. Once this game releases and people see the credits roll, the drumbeat of wanting Bloodborne 2 will likely begin again.

                    <span>If you&#x27;ve been following Battlefield 2042 since its launch back in November, then you likely know that Dice is facing an uphill battle when it comes to improving the game. It launched with bugs galore – something touched on in the Game Informer Battlefield 2042 review – and post-launch updates and patches have been focused almost exclusively on squashing them and fixing other issues. 
Through all of it, Dice has recognized the shortfalls of 2042, promising to get the game up to shape and meet fan expectations for EA&#x27;s latest FPS. To do that, Dice is delaying the game&#x27;s first season.

With Batman supposedly dead at the outset of play, the Bat-family has a lot of weight on their shoulders to deliver a superhero experience that can live up to his legacy. We discuss the tone we want to see, gameplay direction, and also who should show up as villains.
For the comic readers out there, we go deep into two red-hot series: Something is Killing the Children and Saga. Yes, Saga is finally back after a three year break! We also talk about our favorite books from last week&#x27;s new releases rack, and highlight the books we hope to pick up this Wednesday.

                    <span>Yacht Club&#x27;s latest gets the 8-bit top-down.
Following the the promise of a &quot;groundbreaking&quot; reveal during a broadcast on G4&#x27;s Twitch stream channel, Yacht Club Games, developer of Shovel Knight, has pulled back the curtain on an all-new title called Mina the Hollower.
Described as a bone-chilling action adventure, Mina the Hollower uses a top-down 8-bit art style that strongly evokes the look of Game Boy Color titles, which is in keeping with the company&#x27;s catalogue of modern games with retro aesthetics (think of the NES stylings of the Shovel Knight series and Mechanical Head&#x27;s Cyber Shadow).

Team17, the hugely successful UK-based publisher and developer, has been facing a storm of bad publicity since revealing plans for a &#x27;MetaWorms&#x27; NFT project. Many details were yet to be revealed, but the negative reaction was swift from some fans of the company and indeed employees; tellingly, major development partners had started to speak out and say they wouldn&#x27;t work with the company in future.
The reaction has been so strong that Team17 has now shut the project down, less than 48 hours after its reveal. The following message was shared on social media.

&quot;It’s Pokémon, but not as you know it&quot; seems to be the tagline for Pokémon Legends: Arceus, which is a pretty good way of summing up our thoughts on it, too. But The Pokémon Company&#x27;s latest advert for the game, which is based on the idea that it&#x27;s new and different, is a little... strange.
A Muppet-like puppet of Munchlax is shown causing trouble on a cooking reality show by stealing potatoes and throwing vegetables everywhere, much to the annoyance of the head chef.

The best karaoke song of all time and the best Zelda game of all time have finally been united in this mashup, in which Bigfatfrown plays the entirety of Toto&#x27;s 1982 hit Africa on the Majora&#x27;s Mask instruments. Perhaps the original arrangement of the song was not entirely intended for a set of bongos, an electric guitar, an ocarina and whatever the hell Deku Pipes are, but it sounds bangin&#x27; nonetheless.
Now, if you&#x27;ll excuse us, we&#x27;ve got a karaoke booth to get to, and some lyrics to rewrite. I bless the stoooorms down in Ikanaaaaa...

Broken Rules is a development studio that has produced a number of intriguing games, quite a few of which have been on Nintendo platforms - it&#x27;s probably best known among Switch gamers for Old Man&#x27;s Journey. The studio has now confirmed its next release, Gibbon: Beyond the Trees, which will debut on Apple Arcade on 25th February before arriving on Switch and PC later this year.
It looks rather interesting, blending momentum-based gameplay with serious messages around deforestation and climate change. Some official details are below:

As part of this, the pair have created DK Creations, a YouTube channel that sees them sharing their secrets and generally looking back on some of the amazing games they&#x27;ve worked on.
If you haven&#x27;t checked out the channel already, you&#x27;re in for a bit of a treat. Bayliss – who worked on titles such as Killer Instinct and Donkey Kong Country during his time at Rare and now plies his trade at Playtonic Games – has not only been sharing drawing tutorials but also videos where he plays (and chats about) classic titles he&#x27;s worked on. He&#x27;s done the NES games Cobra Triangle, Anticipation, Hollywood Squares and California Games so far.

I&#x27;ve no answer for you, but fan-made demake Bloodborne PSX should tide you over for a little while. It&#x27;s Bloodborne as if made for 32-bit consoles, four hours long, and features the original game&#x27;s first two bosses. It&#x27;s out now.

Seriously, I own some geeky merch to demonstrate my love for this series; up to and including, yes, the official Life Is Strange deck of playing cards. In other words, I am exactly the sort of fan the Life Is Strange: Remastered Collection is geared towards; so you may be surprised when I say that I&#x27;m not planning on picking it up anytime soon.
I&#x27;ll be honest, I&#x27;ve been wary of the remasters of the first Life Is Strange title and its prequel Before The Storm ever since the first stills were released. &quot;Look how much emotion their faces show now!&quot; was the boast, splashed across side-by-side images of Rachel frowning in the original vs Rachel smiling in the remaster, Chloe frowning in the original vs Chloe smiling in the remaster, Max smiling slightly in the original vs Max grinning widely in the remaster... perhaps you begin to see my issue.

                    <span>Hi, nice to meet you. Can I get you anything? A drink, a bite to eat, an acquisition maybe? There are apparently a lot of them to go around, after all. Hear that? It&#x27;s Sony buying Bungie. It&#x27;s Microsoft buying Activision Blizzard. It&#x27;s Tencent accidentally dropping £365 billion down a grate as they stroll down the street and unknowingly buy the Earth&#x27;s crust. They were on the phone to me at the time, putting an offer on my flat. I am tired of these big companies buying everything. Can we just slow down for a hot second and chill out a bit, please?

                    <span>Oh, this is classic Kingston. I don’t think any other SSD manufacturer so consistently goes quiet for months on end, then suddenly rocks up at your house, slams a world-beating NVMe drive on your desk and wordlessly disappears again. It happened with the A2000, it happened with the KC2500 and now it’s happened with the Fury Renegade.

                    <span>I keep trying to figure out how to describe The Waylanders’ unique blend of endearment and jank. Unfortunately I am cursed with chronic writer’s brain so all I can come up with is this: it feels like a really good first draft.


For every aspect of worldbuilding that I enjoyed, there was a bug that had to be overlooked. For every character that I found charming, there was some voiceover that was jarring. For every area that was absolutely gorgeous there was a part of the script that made me extremely grateful for having editors on all my writing. Over and over, I found these flaws didn’t stop me from enjoying the core that I could see underneath. At least, until the game (as far as I can tell) bugged so badly that I literally couldn’t continue.

This time Australia gets the polish, with scanned photogrammetry replacements for 11 cities, handcrafted models for 94 landmarks and points of interest, and new local missions. It looks pretty! Check out the trailer below.

                    <span>I often find myself intrigued by games where you have to manage a business - not the slow, thoughtful ones like Strange Horticulture (which I like for a different reason), but the surprisingly deep management ones that are like strategy games except for coffee production instead of war.
I am usually catastrophically bad at these games, as I lack the sheer nerve to commit all my assets to something at once, or take out loans to cover a product run, even in a fictional digital setting. Still, I was drawn to Startup Panic like a moth to a flame, and giggled to myself at the prospect of cosplaying as a Silicon Valley nerd trying to reinvent having a chicken coop. I called my founder Beth, and the company was therefore Betherium. But it turned out that the product I was tasked with making and selling was, basically, Facebook.

The New York Times, a hardcopy blog, are buying the viral hit word puzzle game for &quot;an undisclosed price in the low-seven figures.&quot; They say it will be free when it moves under their banner, though it&#x27;s not clear if it will stay that way.

                    <span>Evil Dead: The Game is no stranger to delays. The asymmetrical multiplayer title based on the cult horror franchise was originally scheduled for 2021. Then it got delayed to an unspecified February 2022 date. It has now been pushed back once again, though this time it has a concrete release date: May (Friday) 13. 
The game, developed by Saber Interactive, simply needs more time to come properly come together according to a message from the game’s official Twitter. The team does promise a new trailer to premiere in February.

Evil Dead: The Game was first revealed during The Game Awards 2020 and pits a team of players, taking on the role of Ash and other beloved characters, against a human-controlled monster. Last August, Saber announced a single-player mode for the game as well. Narratively, it features an amalgamation of elements from every mainline Evil Dead film (sans the 2013 reboot) and the Ash vs The Evil Dead TV series. 
Evil Dead: The Game is launching on PlayStation/Xbox consoles, Switch, and PC.</span>

                    <span>It is important to keep in mind what is going on within Activision Blizzard at this time regarding ongoing allegations about the work culture. The ongoing lawsuit from the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) against the company is over reported toxic workplace culture. The bulk of the suit focuses on &quot;violations of the state&#x27;s civil rights and equal pay laws,&quot; specifically regarding the treatment of women and other marginalized groups.

                    <span>Announced back in May of last year, Sony and Discord formed a partnership to bring the PlayStation and Discord ecosystems together. Today, we&#x27;re finally seeing some movement in bringing Discord integration to Sony&#x27;s consoles, or rather the other way around. 
As of today, you can now link your PlayStation account to your Discord ID. This lets your friends or other server mutuals see when and what you&#x27;re playing on PS5 or PS4. The service works like any others, such as Steam, Blizzard, Xbox, Spotify, etc. The setup is the same as well.
Here&#x27;s how Discord says to connect a PlayStation account:
&quot;To connect your Discord account to your PlayStation Network account, open up Discord and head into User Settings &gt; Connections on either desktop or web. On mobile, go to User Settings &gt; Connections.&quot; From there, you&#x27;ll enter your login information for your PlayStation account. Pretty easy. It also notes that you can toggle whether anyone can see your PlayStation status in case you need to keep something hidden for whatever reason.
The PlayStation functionality works on any platform Discord is on, so give it a go if you play on Sony&#x27;s consoles. Unfortunately, there wasn&#x27;t any update to the broader integration of the two, but this small step is a good start for now. 
In other Sony news today, the console maker picked up a huge studio with the acquisition of Destiny 2 developer Bungie. Read all about the big purchase and the future of Destiny here.</span>

The gaming IP arms race continued today as Sony bought vaunted developer Bungie for a whopping $3.6 billion. But what does that mean for Destiny fans and the industry at large? Join us on this discussion video as we talk about all of that and so much more.
Alex Stadnik is here with associate editor Jill Grodt and Magazine Content Director, and huge Bungie fan Matt Miller to break down today&#x27;s breaking news. We start by discussing the particulars of the deal as we know it now, including how Bungie is maintaining its independence. The studio has said that it still can self-publish and choose where its games can release. The studio&#x27;s blog post also outlined that the goal is to keep Destiny communities intact and not strip the game away from Xbox users now or in the future. 
While we may know the immediate plans for one of the biggest franchises in games, what about the future? Bungie is working on new projects, but will they be exclusive to PlayStation in the future? Bungie has said, in fact, &quot;We want the worlds we are creating to extend to anywhere people play games. We will continue to be self-published, creatively independent, and we will continue to drive one, unified Bungie community.&quot; Xbox fans can sleep soundly, at least tonight. 
We finally round out our video discussion by zooming out to the gaming landscape at large. This is the second impactful industry acquisition in the last month, but how will this change the landscape of games? Will this motivate the streaming giants also to start buying up IP? Is this good for the industry? We answer all those questions and more, and we hope you enjoy our talk.

                    <span>Shadow Warrior 3 has been a long-time coming for fans, but developer Flying Wild Hog finally confirmed the game is launching on March 1. A stylish (and self-aware) cinematic trailer celebrates the occasion in over-the-top fashion.
Hero Lo Wang returns and has some new traversal tricks up his sleeve such as a wall run, grapple hook, air dash, and double jump. You’ll still be slicing apart enemies with your katana or riddling them with bullets using a variety of firearms. He&#x27;ll need all the help he can get as he teams up with a powerful witch to slay a colossal dragon and hordes of demons.
Flying Wild Hog also announced a new voice cast consisting of Mike Moh (Lo Wang), Andromeda Dunker (Motoko), and SungWon Cho (Zilla). Alex Dobrenko reprises his role as Hoji. Shadow Warrior 3 was first announced in the summer of 2020 for a 2021 release, a window that obviously came and went. Fans have waited somewhat impatiently for an updated launch date, making this a good way to start the week.

Shadow Warrior 3 will be available on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Those who pre-order receive the exclusive Koromodako Katana in-game weapon. Purchasing early on consoles also rewards players with Shadow Warrior 1 and 2 for free.

                    <span>Hazelight Studios is looking to adapt its 2021 co-op romp It Takes Two to film or television thanks to a partnership with dj2 Entertainment. The news of this deal comes from an exclusive report from Variety. 
Outspoken Hazelight creative director Josef Fares sounds excited for the opportunity to bring It Takes Two to another medium. “Creating the world and story in ‘It Takes Two’ was so much fun for me and the team,” Fares said to Variety. “Since it has a strong narrative with many crazy characters and just as crazy co-op action moments, the potential is huge for a great adaption to film or television.” 
dj2 Entertainment is no stranger to producing adaptations of video games with 2020&#x27;s Sonic the Hedgehog movie and its sequel, the upcoming Tomb Raider anime series slated to be released on Netflix, and is attached to executive produce projects based on Disco Elysium and Life is Strange. dj2 CEO and founder Dmitri M. Johnson spoke to Variety about the potential project, saying, “dj2 is honored to partner with Josef, Oskar [Wolontis], and the incredible team at Hazelight Studios on the linear media adaptation of ‘It Takes Two.&#x27;” He continues, “Just like the rest of the gaming world, we fell head-over-heels in love with Cody, May, Rose, Dr. Hakim and the imaginative fantasy universe Hazelight have created, and can’t wait to bring these characters -and this world- to life on the big and small screen.”
According to Variety, the project doesn&#x27;t have any studios or networks attached as of yet. However, there does happen to be a &quot;multi-party bidding war&quot; ongoing for the rights to the It Takes Two adaptation. 
It Takes Two saw plenty of critical acclaim last year, and we here at Game Informer are quite fond of it ourselves! Check out our review of It Takes Two and why we ranked it number eight on our top 10 games of the year.</span>

The original Final Fantasy VII catapulted JRPGs into the limelight and established a new standard for expansive gameworlds and emotional stories. Final Fantasy VII Remake is an homage to and reimagining of its predecessor&#x27;s motifs: Eco-activism, classism, atonement, and companionship (among many other important themes). We demonstrate how Remake&#x27;s plot beats can be reevaluated with the themes of departure and reunion in mind.
Square Enix plans to tell Cloud’s extensive story in parts but, because the first entry solely focuses on Midgar, Final Fantasy VII veterans get to experience the original game’s introductory setting and characters in more nuanced ways. The high stakes remain the same: The fallout from the Mako Reactor 1 and 5 bombings, the eventual destruction of the slums, and Sephiroth’s sudden and terrifying return. Our video essay considers these emotional moments and looks to provide other interpretations surrounding Remake’s most important plot motivations.
There are many scenes that Square Enix will have to reveal and unpack in upcoming installments, but we’re excited to see what the future holds for Cloud and co. In other Final Fantasy VII news, today marks the 25th anniversary of the classic JRPG steampunk adventure. Apparently, there are &quot;even more new FFVII projects&quot; slated for the future.

                    <span>Sony Interactive Entertainment has announced it is purchasing Bungie for $3.6 Billion. That means the studio that created Halo and Destiny is coming under the PlayStation umbrella. Sony’s announcement caps off an acquisition-heavy January that saw Take-Two buy Zynga for $13 billion and Microsoft announce plans to acquire Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion. 
Bungie posted a blog post discussing the acquisition, saying that it will “continue to independently publish and creatively develop our games” and that SIE’s first, most immediate influence will be an acceleration in the studio’s hiring process. Bungie states that it’s staffing up for Destiny 2 as well as “all new worlds beyond&quot;, hinting at a new IP.

This news comes by way of a new interview with Inverse in which Anabuki said a sequel would be “even more mature.” He also said it would hone in on the “superpower” aspect of Scarlet Nexus, implementing these otherworldly powers into other elements of the game rather than just combat.

                    <span>One of 2021’s most eyebrow-raising stories was MLB The Show, the PlayStation published and exclusive series, launching on Xbox platforms, including Game Pass. If you thought seeing the PlayStation Studios logo appear on an Xbox title was strange, we’re about to see it happen in Nintendo’s ballpark too. 
That’s because the newly announced MLB The Show 22 is coming to Switch, marking the series’ first appearance on a Nintendo platform. The game is also heading to Xbox for the second year in a row, including launching day one on Game Pass. Of course, you’ll still be able to play it on PlayStation consoles. Los Angeles Angels superstar player and American League MVP Shohei Ohtani graces this year’s cover, and the game is set to launch on April 5.

While the video still presents the in-game action from a cinematic standpoint, it does provide looks at the models and animations on display. That’s important given that 2K22 runs on an entirely rebuilt gameplay engine, which 2K promises will be more intuitive than ever. The video also reveals previously unconfirmed superstars such as Asuka, Damien Priest, and Alexa Bliss. Cover star Rey Mysterio’s legendary career gets spotlighted in this year’s Showcase Mode and the trailer reveals one of the matches players can revisit: Rey vs Eddie Guerrero at WrestleMania 21.

To celebrate the 25th anniversary of what is considered by many to be the most popular Final Fantasy in the entire series, FF7 director Yoshinori Kitase and Final Fantasy 7 Remake director Tetsuya Nomura shared some words about what the series means to them.

                    <span>Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands is right around the corner – it hits PlayStation and Xbox consoles, and PC, on March 25 – and Gearbox Software has been doling out new information about classes, locations, and more. Today, that stream of information continues with a new trailer that reveals the final two classes in the game. 
We learned about Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands’ Stabbomancer and Brr-Zerker classes back in October. Then, in December, we learned about the Spellshot and Clawbringer classes. Now, the final two classes, Spore Warden and Graveborn, have been revealed in a new trailer detailing how each works.

                    <span>CD Projekt Red is developing a single player, standalone Gwent game and it’s coming this year. 
Revealed by IGN, this Gwent game, which is based on the popular card game of the same name in the studio’s Witcher titles, is codenamed Project Golden Nekker. CDPR says Golden Nekker will be different from previous iterations of its Gwent titles, instead aiming to provide a “captivating single-player experience,” according to IGN. 
Because it’s a standalone game, players will not need to own other versions of CDPR’s Gwent games to play it. Once you boot up Golden Nekker, you’re all set to play. 
“It’s not another Witcher Tales game, but something different,” Gwent communications head Pawel Burza told IGN. “We’re aiming to provide a captivating single-player experience for players who prefer it over competitive multiplayer Gwent.” 
If you’re a fan of CDPR’s competitive multiplayer Gwent game, though, don’t fret – development is set to continue on that title at least through 2022, as the studio has released a 2022 roadmap that features new card drops in April, July, October, and December. When Golden Nekker is released, it will be the first CDPR game since the release of Cyberpunk 2077 back in 2020.
Be sure to check out IGN’s full report about this new Gwent game to see art for some of the cards. After that, read Game Informer’s Gwent: The Witcher Card Game review and then check out this opinion piece about why Assassin’s Creed Valhalla’s Orlog game is almost as good as Gwent.

                    <span>PlayStation has announced that it will air a State of Play this week all about Gran Turismo 7. 
The first State of Play of 2022, this one promises more than 30 minutes of new PlayStation 5 footage of the upcoming Polyphony Digital simulation racing game. It will also feature new details about GT7, which is slated to arrive on PS5 and PlayStation 4 on March 4. 
“The first 2022 State of Play arrives later this week, and we’re all revved up for just over 30 minutes of new PS5 footage and gameplay details for Gran Turismo 7,” a PlayStation Blog post reads. “Watch live February 2 on Twitch or YouTube starting 2 p.m. Pacific/ 5 p.m. Eastern/ 11 p.m. CET.” 
And that’s all that PlayStation had to say about the State of Play. Usually, PlayStation will mention that viewers shouldn’t expect this or that, but because it’s being dubbed a GT7 State of Play, there’s probably no reason for the company to give any caution in that regard. Basically, we don’t recommend going in this expecting PlayStation to surprise reveal a game or talk about Horizon Forbidden West in the showcase’s final few minutes. 
This State of Play will be the first in-depth look at GT7 in a while. It’s been a sure bet that we’ll see a trailer in recent PlayStation first-party showcases but beyond that, not much about GT7 is known. 
While waiting to learn more on Wednesday, read about GT7’s original announcement back in 2020 and then check out this GT7 trailer that shows off the game’s detailed customization and photo mode. Watch the latest GT7 trailer, which features a race around Daytona, after that.

While built on the current-generation RDNA2 architecture, this graphics card was widely panned for its price while only offering 4GB of video memory, limited to PCIe x4 bandwidth, and performance similar to the years-old Polaris GPUs. While all the major benchmarks online to this point have been under Windows, here is a look at how the AMD Radeon RX 6500 XT is performing under Linux.</span>

                    <span>Following Code Force&#x27;s recent demonstration, I was optimistic about the upcoming space 4X/simulation/strategy/forward slash game Distant Worlds 2. The original was a game I very nearly adored, but playing it always meant being a little too frustrated to talk about it without complaining a lot (which, granted, I do about everything, but still).
Code Force have since sent us a preview build, and I&#x27;ve been consumed with it for the better part of a week. I&#x27;m struggling to gauge exactly how much to reserve, because it&#x27;s had me positively cackling at my minor successes and howling in enjoyable despair at my setbacks. If they can do, ooh, two thirds of what I&#x27;m hoping in the six weeks before its release on March 10th, this could be every bit as brilliant as its predecessor, with fewer flaws.

                    <span>The new Apex Legends Season 12 gameplay trailer gives us a better look at Mad Maggie&#x27;s fiery abilities, and they seem perfect for flushing campers out of their hiding spots. This latest trailer, delivered as a piece of Silva Pharmaceuticals propaganda, also reveals the Sabotaged Olympus map update and Control mode coming in Season 12.

                    <span>A new standalone singleplayer game of Gwent is coming this year, telling a new tale with the card game spun off from The Witcher 3. It&#x27;s codenamed Project Golden Nekker and... that&#x27;s about all we know for know. It&#x27;s not another &#x27;Witcher Tales&#x27; like the previous singleplayer Gwent game, like Thronebreaker: The Witcher Tales, and it is confirmed to have at least two (2) monsters. Possibly three (3) if you consider that man is the real monster. Or four (4) if you hate libraries.

                    <span>Even with a bunch of post-launch performance improvements, Microsoft Flight Simulator is still the kind of game that can make most PCs sweat. Good news, then, for frequent flyers who happen to own an Nvidia GeForce RTX graphics card: Flight Sim is getting DLSS support this year.


Specifically, DLSS will be available when running the sim in DirectX 12, as part of a handful of upcoming DX12 enhancements that also include optimisations for playing on multiple monitors. Developers Asobo Studio confirmed the DLSS addition in a recent devstream, which you can watch in full below, though the feature is still being tested so there’s no specific date beyond 2022.

                    <span>Square Enix first launched Final Fantasy VII 25 years ago today, introducing a new generation to big-sword bishies. In celebration, both the director of the original JRPG and the creative director of the recent FF7 Remake have posted messages looking back and forward. Along with several FF7 mobile games kicking about, they tease that more new FF7 things we don&#x27;t know about are coming. Hopefully this means we&#x27;ll hear more about efforts to complete the remake, but I guess they could also be talking about merch or new movies.

                    <span>It wouldn’t work without the sounds. The thwop of your whip, the thwick of your dagger. The electronic twinkle of health-restoring chicken, which sounds uncannily like the shield’s up sound from 1999 classic 3D Astro Blaster. The ‘boo boo de boo, boo boo de boop’ of the chest-opening jingle, to which my shoulders cannot help but shimmy. Best of all: the plink of picking up an XP-granting gem - at first a sporadic treat, soon a near constant hum as the tide of enemies grows from a trickle into a flood. 
Vampire Survivors is a simple, early access, arcade-style game about dodging an ever-growing horde of monsters while acquiring spells that fire automatically. You can (and should) play it with one hand while eating a bag of crisps. It’s a very good way to spend £2.

                    <span>Intel’s Arc graphics cards are, despite apparent delays, likely to launch this year. And not just with the expectation of being good GPUs, but with the hope that they can fix one of the biggest vexations in PC gaming: a years-long component shortage that’s made all of the best graphics cards nearly impossible to buy at fair prices.


Intel graphics chief Raja Koduri is at least well aware of the pressure, tweeting that the company is “working hard to find a path towards the mission - getting millions of Arc GPUs into the hands of PC gamers every year.” Koduri was responding to an open letter from our friends at PC Gamer, calling on Intel to finally toss an escape rope down the hardware hellmouth we’ve all found ourselves trapped in. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger also responded, claiming “We’re on it.”

                    <span>As previously announced, a new trailer for Paramount’s Halo TV series premiered today, giving us an even better look at the much-anticipated adaptation and a premier date. 
The show starts from the beginning, with Dr. Halsey (played by Natascha McElhon) selling the UNSC on Master Chief’s exceptional combat prowess but, most importantly, his ability to be controlled. But when Chief encounters an ancient artifact, he uncovers a plot that may require him to act independently in a manner that may rub his superiors the wrong way. 
The new trailer provides the first looks at the Covenant, specifically Elites, who look pretty accurate in the brief clips of them battling Master Chief. We also get a glimpse of the show’s more human-toned (and slightly unsettling) Cortana, who is still voiced by Jen Taylor. The biggest adjustment will be getting used to Chief’s new voice, with actor Pablo Schreiber bringing him to life. Lastly, we found out that Halo premieres exclusively on Paramount + on March 24.

Me, right now: wait, so shaders can also be used to tell the story of a planet over four and a half billions years, from a lump of molten rock to the formation of mountains, rivers, and human cities. 
Humanity, an in-browser shader created by David A. Roberts, is worth the four minutes it takes to watch.

                    <span>Halo Infinite has been having trouble with its Big Team Battle mode since launch. Attempts to fix it before Christmas and earlier in January largely failed, with the mode available but matchmaking issues making it near-impossible to play for some. 

Now 343 Industries think they&#x27;ve fixed the issue, with a patch due to be deployed sometime after February 3rd.

The changes include Microsoft refunding and even cancelling subscriptions in cases where customers &quot;haven&#x27;t used their memberships for a long time.&quot;

Faced with liability lawsuits, ISPs are more inclined to take this drastic action today, which can have grave consequences. For one subscriber, downloading a Skyrim mod appears to have been too much. But is this really what the game&#x27;s creators want?

                    <span>After tackling Metroid in Season 1, the second season of Game Informer&#x27;s Video Gameography podcast moves on to one of the biggest shooter franchises in existence: Halo. This week, we’re taking a look at the controversial Halo 5: Guardians, widely considered to be the most polarizing entry in the series. 
Halo 5: Guardians launched on the Xbox One on October 27, 2015, and was the tale of two Spartans. The campaign told a dual narrative centered on Master Chief and Jameson Locke, a soldier tasked with apprehending Chief after he goes AWOL to recover a rampant Cortana. Speaking of everyone’s favorite AI, her mission to subjugate the galaxy positions her as the main antagonist. Halo 5’s narrative didn’t universally land with fans and the game overall served as an unintentional poster child of the Xbox One’s flawed philosophy during its early years. How, you might ask? You’ll have to listen to find out.  
Join hosts Ben Reeves (@BenjaminReeves) and Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7) along with Wirecutter lead editor Arthur Gies (@aegies) as we unpack the history, impact, and lasting legacy of Halo 5: Guardians.

                    <span>This weekend I am looping the Assault On Precinct 13 theme to build the plodding determination I will need to survive the impending NFT bonanza. I do take some comfort in the fact that NFTs are so unpopular that Riot had scramble to cover after accidentally suggesting a Valorant character liked NFTs. And I especially enjoyed Yanis Varoufakis explaining why the metacryptofungiverse sucks. But more and more companies are talking about NFTs and things will get worse, and I&#x27;ll need the energy I can only get from Precinct 13 (and the amazing unused Jimmy Chambers song based on it).
But the terrible future can wait, what are you playing this weekend?

                    <span>In the closed network test, players explored a small slice of Limgrave and Stormveil. When I went hands-on with the game, all of Limgrave and Stormveil were open to me, including the haunting Weeping Penninsula to the south. But to the north of Stormveil lies another realm, a biome with a completely different aesthetic. Each realm in Elden Ring has its own signature set of creatures, flora, fauna, and more. The big boss of Stormveil, Godrick the Grafted, does not need to be beaten before moving on to the realm to the north, as a mildly hidden mountain path can lead players into this area without ever stepping foot inside the dangerous castle dungeon. 
This is the home of the magical academy of Raya Lucaria, and instead of the pastoral greens and rolling fields of Limgrave, it is draped in …</span>

                    <span>From the Nexus to the Firelink Shrine to Majula, From Software’s dark fantasy realms have always had a place of respite to hang out, resupply, and talk to a variety of collected NPC guests gathered from adventures around the world. Access to Elden Ring’s hub realm, known as the Roundtable Hold, does not come right away when starting the game, though it may be possible to speed access given the player fulfills the right conditions. Sometimes when you come across a site of lost grace (checkpoints similar to bonfires in the Souls games) and rest, Melina will appear and offer some interesting words of guidance or commentary on the Lands Between. 
During an early encounter, Melina is the source of Torrent, the Spectral Steed, and the ability to level up. On my quest, I encountered Melina again …</span>

                    <span>While Limgrave offers players a variety of smaller-scale dungeon and boss experiences, Stormveil Castle looms over the entire zone and features two major bosses. Many have already seen Margit the Fell Omen, who punished players in the closed network test. During my hands-on time with the game, I had the chance to face off with Godrick the Grafted himself, the current lord of Stormveil, and a serious challenge, especially for an “early game” boss. Granted, you don’t have to fight Godrick at all to get to other adjacent zones to continue exploring and powering up, so my path to the many-appendaged tyrant was brisk. I didn’t really do a whole lot of leveling up or gear optimization because the clock was ticking during my 10-hour play session, and I wanted to see and do as much as possible. It…</span>

                    <span>Boss battles in Elden Ring are frequent, ranging from small-scale affairs in coves, caves, and catacombs to incredibly intense boss battles in the legacy dungeons. However, there are also other boss battles located in both mid-tier dungeons and outside in the open world. While many players had a chance to take on a dragon in the Network Test, we encountered a new kind of open field boss in our time with Elden Ring, a ghostly mariner in the middle of a shallow lake. There’s no indication you will be entering a boss battle, other than fairly serious environmental clues. If you’re exploring organically, you may have also encountered the NPC “D” nearby, who hunts the undead and warns you that this small town has been beset by this ghostly fiend. Other than that, there’s just a big shallow lake…</span>

                    <span>Elden Ring features numerous mini-dungeons like caves and catacombs to explore alongside giant sprawling dungeon crawls like Stormveil Castle. Castle Mourne, nestled in southern Limgrave on the Weeping Penninsula, is a place where horrors abound. Chimeric leonine creatures and other surprises await the player should they dare approach. While this locale would fall into the mini-dungeon classification, it&#x27;s substantially larger than any of the minor offerings that I experienced during my 10 hours of gameplay, with a dangerous approach and several checkpoints.

                    <span>Legendary writer George R.R. Martin collaborated with From Software and Hidetaka Miyazaki to essentially create the mythology of the world of Elden Ring before the catastrophic Shattering event. The characters involved were often crafted as humans, heroic but flawed in their journeys and adventures. However, as From Software took on the task of converting these characters to entities that would fit into Elden Ring, these mythic heroes and personalities got broken down into something twisted and more suited to occupying a “boss monster” role.
“When Martin wrote these characters, and when he provided that origin story that mythos for the world of Elden Ring, these demigods were much closer to their original form, and maybe closer to human form back then, before the Shattering, before it all …</span>

                    <span>Through an entirely unplanned sequence of events, I&#x27;m currently playing two big action adventure games that couldn&#x27;t be less alike. One is God Of War, a big, serious dadventure epic about an emotionally distant father trying his darnedest to connect with his (at times very irritating) son. The other is Kena: Bridge Of Spirits, an altogether more wholesome adventure about a young girl cleansing a lush, forested mountainside from a serious case of bad vibes and helping lost ghosts pass on to the other side. 
About the only thing they have in common is that they both have what one might call &#x27;cute&#x27; NPC companions. Dad Of War is joined by his eager archer &quot;BOY!&quot; Atreus, while Kena has her gaggle of black, fluffy Rot friends (above, right). According to the widely accepted law of big googly-eyes, I should find the Rot absolutely adorable and thus beyond reproach. Atreus does not have big googly-eyes (they are merely wide and naive), but he is certainly a lot cuter than God Of War&#x27;s other main companion, a talking disembodied head. And yet. Even though Atreus has now reached that stage where he&#x27;s doing all his adolescent whining and rebellion and &quot;I know you are, but what am I?&quot; nonsense in the space of about two hours, I would much rather have this sulky pre-teen by my side than the interminable Rot. Let me explain.

                    <span>In theory, I miss auto scrolling arcade shooters and would love it if they came back. In reality, they come back all the time and I never really click with them because what I really miss is being a child and feeling like almost every game I saw was magical.
I&#x27;m pretty bad at them as well, which doesn&#x27;t help. Mostly though, I became jaded and curmudgeonly at around nine years old, and will never know such naive wonder again.
Still, Hyper Echelon is fun.

                    <span>They say everything is bigger in Texas. It&#x27;s a statement I have only briefly put to the test during a rushed weeked in San Antonio, a trip I mostly remember for 1) seeing a roadside billboard that advertised Jesus on one side and massive tits on the other, and 2) making a joke about having a puffy taco &quot;so I guess I should see a doctor!&quot; [finger guns] that fell bone-chillingly flat to a dinner table of American business colleagues.
You know where everything actually is bigger? The past. Join us on this special supporter-funded bonus podcast episode where Nate is our gentle and enthusiastic guide for really massive historical monsters. A giant owl? Bigfoot is really an orangutan? A huge fish that might in fact just be well big, owing to a mistake with its skeleton? Yes, we have all these delights and more. A big thank you to our supporters for making The Nate Files happen.

                    <span>With NFTs in games proving unpopular with almost everyone who doesn&#x27;t plan to get rich by fleecing other players, even appearing to support them is controversial. This is a situation Riot Games found themselves in after a lighthearted tweet about one of the Valorant wizards visiting an art exhibition on a day out. Turns out, the picture seen by Killjoy is an NFT. Cue Riot scrambling to make clear it was unintentional and say, literally, &quot;Whoopsie!&quot;

                    <span>Anecdotally, the first records of modern golf date back to its banning in 15th century Scotland. “Nay Golf,” said parliament. “It’s turning the soldiers into fiendish, turf-snorting club-strokers who’d rather say shit like ‘Triple Bogey’ than batter the English, and we’re no having it.” RPGolf Legends is not set in 15th century Scotland, but it does take place in a world where golf has been banned. Only you - through the power of bare-bones ARPG combat and a fun but limited golf mini-game - can save the noble sport from ostensible nonexistence. 
I say ostensible because, in reality, golf is everywhere. Our heroine Aerin’s hometown is called Mulligandale. It has two shops, one of them dedicated entirely to golf. Folk shimmy about in golfwear, talking about golf. Many give out golf-related quests, the rewards for which are usually some form of golfing paraphernalia, often golf balls. The actual golf courses themselves have been sealed off by an ill-defined big villainous, but if you put a translucent barrier around the thing you’re trying to crush and still let the people you’re attempting to terrorise build their entire society as a monument to it, you’re basically asking for a plucky hero to restore the national passtime to glory. Highly questionable bit of villainy, this.

It might be that it&#x27;s the best example of its genre, or it contains a valuable lesson for future generations. This month, we&#x27;re travelling back to rescue eight games from 2010, and cor, what a good year that was. Too bad almost all of them will end up in the lava bin by the time we&#x27;re done.

Unfortunately its drop in popularity was just as sudden, and almost as immediate. Eighteen months later, Ubisoft have announced they&#x27;re ending development and shutting the game down on April 28th.

                    <span>Back in the mists of time of 2013, a bunch of Japanese developers got together to make a series of short 3DS games called the Guild series. Headed up by Ni No Kuni makers Level-5, it had some pretty big-name contributors: Keiji Inafune, Goichi Suda, Yoot Saito and Yasumi Matsuno among others. But there was one game that stood out to me as something really quite special. It was the considerably less well-known Millennium Kitchen&#x27;s Attack Of The Friday Monsters, a sweet slice of life adventure that saw you play as ten-year-old Sohta walking the streets of his small Tokyo suburb on a hazy summer afternoon in 1971. It was a tender celebration of childhood nostalgia and imagination, with just an inkling of some menacing undertones, both from the people Sohta meets in his neighbourhood and the titular Friday kaiju monsters that may or may not exist in the real world. 
I mention all this because The Kids We Were is probably the only game I&#x27;ve played since then that&#x27;s even come close to capturing some of that Attack Of The Friday Monsters magic. You won&#x27;t find any kaiju here, but this is a similarly nostalgic portrait of pastoral Tokyo, as viewed through the eyes of young Minato on his summer holidays, first in the present day and then in the 1980s when he ends up travelling back in time Back To The Future-style to when his parents first met as kids. With three days to right past wrongs, this is one of those gentle, coming of age tales that leaves you feeling warm and fuzzy in all the right places, even when there&#x27;s no real &#x27;game&#x27; to speak of.

                    <span>Hitman 3 had a rough launch on Steam last week, quickly gathering 50% negative user reviews. Many of the complaints related to price and confusion over the various editions on sale.
To make amends, Io Interactive are giving anyone who buys Hitman 3 on Steam before February 19th a free upgrade. If you buy the standard edition (£50/$60), you&#x27;ll be bumped up to the Deluxe Edition (£75/$90). If you bought the Deluxe Edition, you&#x27;ll get a free upgrade to the Seven Deadly Sins Collection (which on its own costs £23.73 with its 15% launch discount).

Zásadně bylo přepracováno a rozšířeno interaktivní rozhraní a také možnosti vestavěného programovacího jazyka. To ospravedlňuje skok číslování ve verzích z předchozí 1.3 na 2.0.</span>

TV shows are the most sought-after content and represent nearly half of all pirate site traffic, with an average of more than 7 billion visits per month. The report concludes that piracy continues to be a major threat but this presents opportunities as well.

In addition to searching the homes of 20 suspects believed to have violated copyright law, the operation also identified the administrator of CyberGroup, an internet service provider whose servers were used by several IPTV suppliers.

                    <span>Mostly, I want people to shut up about NFTs and cryptocurrency and the metaverse and play-to-earn games. Maybe if we turn away and pretend they&#x27;re not there, it&#x27;ll all burn out when scammers grow tired of being scammed by other scammers. However, one of the few people I do want to hear talk about it all is Yanis Varoufakis, who was Valve&#x27;s in-house economist before becoming Greece&#x27;s finance minister then an MP. In a wonderfully long new interview, he is not impressed by much of the hype, and it is DELIGHTFUL.

                    <span>Be honest with me: when you read the words &quot;Lovecraftian dating sim&quot;, did your mind go straight to a joke about tentacle porn? Horror-themed dating sims are not exactly new, but it&#x27;s rare to be given the opportunity to date the eldritch gods themselves, and taken at face value, it&#x27;s hard to imagine where else this could be going.
Well, allow me to dispel your illusions right away: Sucker For Love: First Date is not an H-game. It is, in fact, the most chaste dating sim I think I&#x27;ve ever played, while also managing to be the most obscenely graphic. You often hear games that straddle different genres accused of not knowing what they&#x27;re trying to be. Sucker For Love does not suffer from this issue: it knows exactly what it wants to be. The challenge is for you, the hapless player, to keep the hell up.

A humble beast, the inventory, yet a feature of many games - sometimes even a necessity. Often we only notice one if it&#x27;s terrible. But boy, a good inventory is worth a dozen mules. So lets talk about them today!
In other news this week, Nate thinks he has come up with an original premise for a Pixar film, only to discover he has invented Seth Rogan&#x27;s nightmare film Sausage Party, and we are officially starting our campaign to get Henry &#x27;Vitamin H&#x27; Cavill on the show. We will be mentioning him every week from now on. Plus: what we like doing on our birthdays, school plays, and pro-wrestling adaptations of Dickens.

                    <span>Boomerangs are cool as hell. The sleek wooden objects careen through the air in a perfect circle - in theory, at least - before returning right back to where they began in the palm of your hand. They’re something that fascinated me as a child, and 20-something years later I still don’t really know how or why they work.


Deflector is like someone taped two swords to a boomerang, Mad Max-style. How does the boomerang still operate with twin blades slashing back and forth on either end? Don’t know. How does it always circle its way back to where you’re standing after dashing around an arena filled with enemies? Not a clue.

The maps were some of the best things about it. Old-school mega-arenas adorned with portal-zappable walls that functioned as DIY shortcuts. As virtual coliseums of chaos go, they were pretty cool. Well, now you can make your own. Splitgate is launching into season 1 this week (the developers insist the last four months have been &quot;season 0&quot;) and alongside a couple of new game modes, there&#x27;s now a map creation tool.

                    <span>Tell you what&#x27;s the opposite of cosy: watching the world crumble from your bedroom window. Tell you what is cosy: playing as a fox who repairs quirky machines and eats nice meals cooked by furry friends. That&#x27;s FixFox for you, an upcoming sci-fi adventure game developed by Rendlike which looks like the video game equivalent of a soothing balm.

                    <span>Official support for same-sex marriages will arrive in Crusader Kings 3 as part of Update 1.5, launching alongside the first expansion in February. It&#x27;ll come as both a game rule for everyone and new options for modders to work with. It&#x27;s taken longer than expected, but Paradox adding an option for same-sex marriage without using mods is more than they had initially planned, so that&#x27;s nice.

                    <span>My personal top Twitter tip: add pleasant breaks to the nightmares of your feed by following a few good image accounts or bots which regularly post nice things. I like accounts which post rock formations or bots which generate landscapes. Perhaps you find comfort in violence? If so, you might enjoy interrupting your doomscrolling with the Doomscroll Doom Bot, a Twitter bot which is very slowly posting a complete playthrough of Ultimate Doom, one frame every hour.

He has no time for the posh dark elf who applauds him for something. Whatever it is, Jack doesn&#x27;t care. In fact, I don&#x27;t think he knows where he is. If he does, he wants nothing to with it.
This interaction is contained in a new trailer that I deem to be perfect. It sells me on this Final Fantasy action RPG, because it seems like I&#x27;ll get to control someone as impatient as I am. Jack lives for crashing and bashing. The story is an inconvenience for him, the fighting is not.

                    <span>Although announcing three games at once feels a bit much, I&#x27;m really happy about the Respawn feat. Star Wars news. Respawn Entertainment always felt like one of those development studios that should have been shut down by a bigger studio circa 2015 because the people loved Titanfall but it wasn&#x27;t, you know, Call Of Duty or anything. I turned my back for what seemed like but a moment, and suddenly Apex Legends exists and Respawn are one of the key players under EA, growing stronger from within. One day we&#x27;ll be watching Andrew Wilson at an E3 showcase and realise it&#x27;s actually Vince Zampella&#x27;s eyes looking out at us. Everyone coming on stage to present is just Vince Zampella doing a voice and wearing a different baseball cap.
Point is, I&#x27;m mostly just pleased that Respawn are still around to make games featuring robots that surprise and delight us. And if they&#x27;re not allowed to do Titanfall 3, Star Wars is at least a rich field to till said robots. Lousy with robots, is Star Wars. But honestly, if anyone is going to make Star Wars games (apart from BioWare, who have spent recent years making Dragon Age 4 and / or collapsing like a magnificent neutron star) then I&#x27;d root for Respawn. They may not make the Star Wars games you think you want, but they&#x27;ll make the ones you need right now.

                    <span>Podmořský kabel, který spojuje ostrovní Království Tonga se zbytkem světa, je po nedávném tsunami vážně poškozený. Pro sto tisíc místních obyvatel výpadek zasáhl veškerou komunikaci včetně té telefonní. Pomocí družicového spoje z místní univerzity se podařilo alespoň částečně obnovit provoz mobilní 2G sítě, ale spojení je nestabilní a připojení k internetu přes něj nefunguje prakticky vůbec.</span>

                    <span>After moves to block access to the Tor network, last month Russian authorities ordered the blocking of TorProject.org, the main domain of the privacy-focused anti-censorship tool Tor. With assistance from digital rights activists at Roskomsvoboda, Tor has now mounted a legal challenge to have the blocking reversed.

                    <span>Vampire Survivors is an action RPG boiled down to its core. You walk around, you kill monsters, you level up, you get stronger, you kill more monsters. In place of story, an inventory, or even the need to fire and aim your own weapons, there is pixel art spectacle. 

On my last life, I killed around 24,000 monsters in 30 minutes. I am hooked.

                    <span>After six long weeks, Final Fantasy XIV is back on sale. That&#x27;s after Square Enix stopped selling the MMORPG after the critically acclaimed life-hog overwhelmed its servers, causing massive server queues and network errors. Thankfully, those days are behind the game now. So yes, if you&#x27;ve been longing to check out its excellent Endwalker expansion or famous smooth grapes, you can! And from a new Oceania server too, because Squeenix now have room for those down under to sample Eorzea&#x27;s delicacies.

                    <span>There was cause for joy and concern alike when Intel revealed the Core i5-12400F, alongside loads of other new 12th gen Alder Lake CPUs. Here was a much more affordable, still gaming focused-alternative to the Core i5-12600K, yet it would lack the signature hybrid of fast Performance cores and flexible Efficiency cores that made that chip one of the best gaming CPUs ever made. 


Turns out, the concern was for naught: the Core i5-12400F is a cracking slice of silicon, both for the money and for games specifically. Although the sole reliance on Performance cores (or P-cores) puts it behind the Core i5-12600K for desktop multitasking, if it’s just the frames per second you’re after, this cheaper chip can match and sometimes even surpass its big brother.

                    <span>Firework actually came out almost exactly a year ago, but the English language version (translated from the original Chinese) was released just before Christmas. Which is a good thing, because Firework is well worth checking out if you have an interest in either horror games or puzzle games. The horror isn&#x27;t blood-chilling, but rather twisted up with grief and sorrow in how inevitable it is. Similarly, the puzzles aren&#x27;t going to stump you for long, but they fit very well with the story. These two strands of the game weave together and create a nice, thoughtful experience that&#x27;s worth the four or so hours of having it.

Please make a game that is basically Strange Horticulture, but about a weird book shop. Possibly a book shop with a small coffee shop attached. I&#x27;m not going to be too strict about it, you know, I&#x27;m not a monster. It could, for example, be a library. Or maybe there isn&#x27;t another business attached, or the business attached to it is a bakery instead of a coffee shop. This isn&#x27;t just my personal hobby horse, either. I&#x27;m pretty sure loads of people would like that game. And please, for the love of God, tell me if the Mystery Book Shop Game already exists. I&#x27;d be disappointed if it does, because nobody has yet brought it to my attention.

The team at Blackbird Interactive has watched the recent return of the classic RTS games with interest - vested interest, in fact. Tasked by Korean developer Smilegate with transposing their Counter-Strike-style shooter Crossfire to the strategy genre, Blackbird believes it has identified a hole yet to be filled. A nostalgic need to be catered to.
“I argue that in the recent resurgence, we haven’t yet come across an RTS game that offers players an experience comparable to StarCraft or Red Alert,” says game designer Maurice Grela. “We’re hoping to fulfill that gap.”

                    <span>Bang your gong, sing it from the rooftops, put your phone on full brightness and swing it to and fro. Elden Ring has gone gold, which means the game should be ready to release on schedule in February. Every NPC has rehearsed their ominous laugh and bosses their second and third phases, basically.

                    <span>Everyone can agree that it is at least a little bit funny when scammers run fake NFT drops and cryptocurrencies to fleece idiots, but it&#x27;s less funny when innocent people get caught up in a scam. The publishers of Outerverse, a game about building automation and battling bosses, say scammers are pretending to run a blockchain version of the game and using this to sell cryptocurrency. It seems an obvious scam, which can&#x27;t be good for the game&#x27;s image.

                    <span>With the Steam Deck’s February rollout bearing down, Valve are still unveiling the portable PC’s new tricks. The latest, as per a Steamworks Development blog post, is Dynamic Cloud Sync: a variation of Steam’s existing cloud save feature that ensures save files can sync between a player’s Steam Deck and PC even when the former is only suspended, rather than fully powered down.

                    <span>Personal data and other records held by ISPs on their customers are highly sensitive and as such, can only be handed over to third parties when the law requires it. In movie piracy cases, judges often order this type of disclosure after consideration but in a new case involving CenturyLink customers, customer details could already be in the hands of some extremely litigious copyright holders.

The YouTube-rippers cited a letter where the EFF defends the non-infringing nature of the youtube-dl software. The RIAA, however, argues that this letter is irrelevant and suggests that the EFF is far from a neutral expert.

Today the makers of the Unity engine announced the acquisition of Ziva Dynamics, a company whose tech specialises in simulating skin and meat to make fancy facial animations and meaty muscle and such. Their tech powered the flappy flesh of the troll in a recent Hellblade 2 trailer, and has been seen on PlayStations in Spider-Man: Miles Morales.

I ended up going with Studio Pixel Punk&#x27;s Unsighted in the end, but it was very nearly OPUS: Echo Of Starsong, a stunning visual novel adventure game from Taiwanese studio Sigono Inc. I&#x27;d seen a few other games journalists raving about it when it came out on Steam last September, and hey, over 3000 overwhelmingly positive Steam reviews can&#x27;t be wrong either, so I took the plunge, and golly, it sure is something special.

This time, it’s going right back to Codemasters&#x27; TOCA Race Driver roots and adding in a full-fat story mode, complete with real actors. No Scotty, mind, but we suppose they have to save something for the sequel. It’s this story mode we’ve been given early access to, so let’s jump in.

The Twitch Rivals tournament SquidCraft Games over the weekend included a number of players in Andorra, several of whom dropped out after their connections exploded. Trying to blast a whole country offline to ruin a Minecraft tournament sounds like the setup for a bad YA metaverse novel but may be a terrible vision of our future.

That’s for the RTX 3090 FE, which now sits at a widowmaking €1,649, while the rest of the range has gained between €20 and €60 in wallet weight.

                    <span>I mostly associate Yu-Gi-Oh! with its manga and anime and all its hairstyles you could cut your hand on. It&#x27;s also, of course, an enormously popular trading card game, and its latest digital iteration, Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel, came to Steam this past week. It&#x27;s currently the fourth most popular game on the platform by concurrent players.

                    <span>Hitman 1-3 is a fantastic trilogy and, also, a curse upon digital storefronts. Hitman 3 frustrated players when it first launched on Epic, because their progress didn&#x27;t carry over; Hitman 1 frustrated players on GOG last year because its internet requirements constitute DRM; and now Hitman 3 is back at it again on Steam. It currently has &quot;Mixed&quot; reviews after arriving on the platform earlier this week, with players cross about its price, its umpteen editions, and - yes, again - progress not carrying over for some.

                    <span>Blizzard Entertainment head Mike Ybarra says their top priority is to &quot;rebuild your trust in Blizzard.&quot; In a new blog post, Ybarra outlines the steps the company is taking, including new senior positions dedicated to improving their culture.

These moves come in the wake of several lawsuits alleging a culture of harassment and discrimination within the company. The post announcing the plans also comes days after Microsoft announced their intent to buy Activision Blizzard.

                    <span>&quot;Palworld looks like Pokémon until you see the guns and sweatshop&quot;, wrote Alice O last year. Palworld has now returned with a second trailer, which continues in kind. The pals are again seen crafting machineguns in a sweatshop - but also crafting space rockets, being strapped to beds in nightmare hospitals, and dragged while tethered to the backs of moving trucks.

                    <span>Sheesh, what a week. Microsoft buying Activision Blizzard for $69 billion is so weird that it&#x27;s easy to lose your head and forget to say &quot;Nice.&quot; Alice Bee has considered some of the implications while I&#x27;m also groaning hard about nostalgic navel-gazing reviving old Activision series. But it was nice to close out the week with news that Raven QA are unionising. Sheesh! Settle down, Actiblizz. Tell me gang, what are you playing this weekend?

                    <span>Capcom have released a new Monster Hunter Rise patch aimed at fixing a frustrating bug with save files which stopped some would-be players from playing at all. Thankfully, a week and change later, that seems to be fixed—though a little extra fiddling is required if you did suffer this bug.

                    <span>What a ridiculous week. Activision Blizzard came in on Monday dragging a trail of lawsuits and scandal with allegations of widespread discrimination and harassment, on Tuesday were being bought by Microsoft for $69 billion (£50 billion), and now on Friday they&#x27;ve grown a union. 34 quality assurance testers at the Activision Blizzard studio Raven Software, who currently maintain Call Of Duty: Warzone, are forming a union named the Game Workers Alliance. They&#x27;re seeking better working conditions in the wake of Raven QA layoffs.

                    <span>I’ve always entertained the idea of an apocalypse. I mean, zombies are definitely scary, but it’d be a cool fantasy to play out. Over the years, I’ve even formed my own little plan. Loot some local houses and then set up a base in the fire station on my street. They’ve got electric gates and metal fences to guard the perimeter, a renewable power source thanks to a wind turbine on the roof, and a really handy watchtower. I thought 11 years of The Walking Dead would’ve prepared me fairly well and I fancied my chances. So, I made myself in Project Zomboid. It turns out, everything I learned from The Walking Dead was useless.
