                              <span>A good part of the Internet has already sung high praise for the OG Tomb Raider trilogy remaster&#x27;s loving determination to rejuvenate the classic. I&#x27;m glad it has. Being alone in finding it quite a marvel would leave me feeling pretty sad and possibly stupid.


One aspect of the remastered trilogy that I believe I haven&#x27;t seen enough praise for, however, is the game&#x27;s achievements, which I absolutely adore. There&#x27;s something for everyone here. Some achievements are expected, some are difficult to find, some are hilarious, and many are straight-up bonkers.

The team notes that &quot;players will continue to see progression being restored across impacted games,&quot; and Champions Quest/Ranked Play will continue to be disabled until the progression fix is fully rolled out.]


Logging into Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 today is quite the ride. Players have seen their rank drop to level 1 overnight, in addition to the server errors being delivered in certain game modes. Particularly Zombies, but also other modes, have displayed a &#x27;Minot Hawthorne&#x27; error, or just a never-ending loading screen, which prevents the player from playing.

                              <span>As yet another week passes, we get more proof that 2024 is shaping up to be a very busy year in gaming—if not for game releases, then certainly for big stories around game exclusivity, adaptions, and, as always, streamers.

Games, is disappointed in the performance of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. Like a poorly made macaroni picture, it looks like this one isn&#x27;t going up on the fridge.


Warner Bros. Discovery CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels spoke on the 4th Quarter 2023 Earnings Webcast regarding Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League.



&quot;This year, Suicide Squad, one of our key videogame releases in 2024, has fallen short of our expectations since its release earlier in the quarter, setting our games business up for a tough year-over-year comp in Q1.&quot;




Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League has been on a decline since release with many players, myself included, being unable to play the supervillain looter …</span>

                              <span>I realized a long time ago I was probably never going to be good at poker. It&#x27;s not that I&#x27;m bad at assessing risk; worse, I just don&#x27;t care. When I used to play casual games in-between classes in school, I&#x27;d go all-in on bad hands. I&#x27;d swap cards for a flush that probably wouldn&#x27;t show up. So imagine my surprise when Balatro, a deckbuilding poker roguelite, asked me to lean into those bad habits.


Developed by LocalThunk and published by Playstack, Balatro made a bit of a splash during the recent Steam Next Fest. So when people started talking it up in the full release on February 20, I had a feeling I should put this on what I call my &quot;temperature check&quot; radar: dip a toe in, play a few rounds, and see if the hype is real. So I booted it up, expecting a bit of card-counting fun.

                              <span>I have a number of valuable games in my collection. Some I acquired through lucky timing, others I’ve actually shelled out for, but all of them are the result of questionable priorities. None are as valuable as my copy of Little Samson.


As of today, Little Samson is worth more than two months of rent for my small, one-bedroom apartment in a nowhere town. That’s really depressing because it both illustrates how ridiculous the collectors market is for video games and how ridiculously expensive it is just to afford a roof over my head for a fraction of a year.


But I don’t collect games to pretend I have some sort of valuable asset. I collect them to play and appreciate. And to demonstrate this, I put Little Samson in my NES. Then I kind of wiggled it around a bit to get it to display prop…</span>

                              <span>For a series coming up on three decades of history, I guess it only makes sense it expands into mobile with everything else. During today&#x27;s Age of Empires New Year, New Age Livestream, Microsoft unveiled Age of Empires Mobile which is coming to both iOS and Android




Developed by TiMi Studios, Age of Empires Mobile brings the classic RTS genre to mobile devices for the first time ever. Featuring several different civilizations including China, Rome, France, and Byzantine, players will be able to choose from over 40 heroes to raise an army and conquer others.


Visually Age of Empires Mobile actually looks pretty good. I know mobile graphics have come a long way, but I sort of expected it to just look like Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition but it actually looks better.


Unfortunately, I&#x27;m not completely sold on the gameplay. Even though several scenes showed what looked to be pretty similar to authentically classic Age of Empires gameplay that we&#x27;ve come to love over the many years, other scenes showed what looked to be pretty normal markers of current mobile &quot;Pay to Win&quot; trends like a VIP Level, timers (that can be skipped for a cost, I&#x27;m sure), and more. Hopefully, I&#x27;m just being paranoid. But it worries me to see predatory practices like that in an epic franchise like Age of Empires.


Age of Empires Mobile is currently available for pre-registering on both iOS and Android,

                              <span>The Bloodborne community is the equivalent of a dog losing its absolute mind whenever it catches wind of a remaster or PC port of its beloved title. &quot;Bloodborne!? Bloodborne! BLOODBOOOOOOOOOORNE!&quot; Such was the case when the FromSoftware darling was brought up with director Hidetaka Miyazaki during the Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree DLC reveal.


I&#x27;ve had enough of this dream... The night blocks all sight...


While speaking with Eurogamer during the aforementioned Elden Ring DLC announcement, the topic of a potential Bloodborne remake sprang up. Miyazaki seems to have waxed nostalgic. 


&quot;It is a title we hold very dear and just as much as our fans,&quot; Miyazaki told Eurogamer. &quot;It does make me very happy to see that there are still so many people passionate about it.&quot;

                              <span>The Mother games are a highly celebrated RPG series, containing the likes of both Mother and EarthBound. There&#x27;s also Mother 3, a really good RPG from what I&#x27;ve heard, that still hasn&#x27;t made it to the west. 


Ever since it came out in 2006 for the Game Boy Advance, fans have been begging Mother series creator Shigesato Itoi for an official English release. We&#x27;ve recently learned that Mother 3 will be coming to Nintendo Switch Online, but still only in Japan. Western fans naturally clamored for a Western release, which got him to make a tweet asking fans to ask Nintendo, not him.




By looking at the Tweet above alone, it&#x27;s hard to infer whether he&#x27;s just politely saying that there&#x27;s nothing he can do about it, or if he really wants us to beg louder for Nintendo to get Mother 3 to spread all over the world. 


Either way, Twitter user Lone translated a letter by Itoi that seems to vent his innermost thoughts and feelings about the game, and it sure does look like the man would be really happy if we got to play Mother 3.




Freeing Mother 3 from its GBA-shaped prison and putting it on the Switch is great. This rocks not just for the instant gratification of Japanese fans, but also for gaming preservation purposes — even if it&#x27;s only coming out digitally. Still, it&#x27;s a total bummer that there&#x27;s no news of a possible English port.


In any case, fans have infamously, notoriously found ways to still play lauded games that never came over to the West. And maybe, right now, that&#x27;s still the best solution for someone just dying to play them. Or, if you just don&#x27;t want to wait on a western release of Mother 3, then perhaps it&#x27;s time to finally learn Japanese.

                              <span>Some people like World of Warcraft because of the interaction with other players. The promise of a massively multi-player online game is a community of folks to pal around with. But, some players wish they could just go on a big single-player adventure. The upcoming Hardcore Self-Found Mode aims to grant the latter WoW Classic players their wish on February 29.


For those who are unaware, Hardcore servers are ones where your character death is permanent. For Self-Found mode, you can&#x27;t escape the wider world (of Warcraft) entirely. It does, however, restrict any material assistance from other players. You will no longer be able to mail items, use the auction house, or trade items in any capacity. If you need to fill gem slots on your weapon, didn&#x27;t take jewelcrafting, you are at the mercy …</span>

                              <span>Xbox Game Studios is currently hosting a New Year, New Age live stream to celebrate everything Age of Empires and reveal updates about its future. However, it&#x27;s not all about Age of Empires. After being teased in 2022, Age of Mythology: Retold has been revealed. A definitive edition of the original classic RTS Age of Mythology, Retold will release on PC and Xbox Serise X|S later this year.




A bit more mystical


If you&#x27;ve never played the original Age of Mythology but are a fan of RTS like Age of Empires, you are in for quite a treat. Mythology takes the foundation of Age of Empires but adds a mystical twist to it, allowing players to call upon various gods to help them in combat. Greek, Norse, Egyptian, and Atlantean pantheons are all options in Age of Mythology. 


As great as Age of Empires is, there has always been something special to me about Age of Mythology. Being able to summon Nidhogg or call in a massive thunderstorm not only felt fun but felt like it added a unique element to the RTS genre.


Age of Mythology: Retold is primarily a graphical upgrade to the original, mixing its classic gameplay elements with modernized visuals. It will include the 50-mission campaign as well as an all-new Arena of the Gods feature that allows you to complete all new trials either solo or co-op with friends as you take on challenges as the gods themselves battle it out.


While no specific release date was given, Microsoft Game Studios did indicate Age of Mythology: Retold will be released later this year on PC, Xbox Series X|S, and be available Day One on Game Pass.

                              <span>Can&#x27;t get enough Death Stranding? Well, you&#x27;re in luck. The documentary film Hideo Kojima: Connecting Worlds shows the creative process behind Hideo Kojima launching his independent studio Kojima Productions and the development of Death Stranding. Connecting Worlds is available to stream now on Disney+, Hulu, and Hotstar depending on region. 




If you are in the United States, Connecting Worlds is available to stream on Hulu. For most of the world, however, it can be streamed on Disney+. In South Africa and the Philippines, you will need Hotstar to stream the documentary. Here are all the regions in which you can watch Death Stranding: Connecting Worlds:



Disney+: Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Korea, Singapore, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Balkans EU (Bulgaria, Croatia, Solvenia), Non-EU (Albania, Boasnia/Herzegovina, Kosovo, Montenegro, Macedonia, Serbia), UK, Ireland, Gibraltar


Hulu: United States


Hotstar: South Africa, Philippines



At the time of this post, the documentary has a 8.3/10 rating on IMDB with a featured review calling the documentary &quot;Very much a Kojima tribute piece&quot;. Did we really expect anything different?


According to the promotional images for Connecting Worlds, the one-hour-long documentary features &quot;A visionary journey into the creation of Death Stranding.&quot;


 I&#x27;ve always been a fan of behind-the-scenes-style game-dev documentaries. It&#x27;s always fun to see the truly creative process of game development first-hand.  Based on the trailer it looks like a bit of Kojima praising mixed with some actual behind-the-scenes, so maybe I&#x27;ll give it a whirl.


Think Geoff Keighley will make an appearance?

                              <span>A solo developer from Moldova, Andrground, has announced their upcoming project, Troleu, a totally accurate work simulator about working as a trolleybus conductor.


Okay, I’m lying. While you do work as a trolleybus conductor, and your job is mostly to issue tickets and collect fare, you also spend much of your time engaging in mortal combat with rule breakers. To my knowledge, this isn’t something that conductors regularly do, but maybe things are different in Moldova.




Both the art style and the general concept of Troleu remind me of Night of the Consumers. Maybe that is the main influence, but the change of vocation completely alters the focus of the game. A big focus of its trailer is on kicking Soviets and misogynists screaming out the door.


The concept sounds like it will only support a short experience – which might be true, as that tends to be what the developer is known for – but the press release suggests that you’ll be visiting a number of locales. It says, “From bustling city streets to tranquil suburbs, every route presents its own set of challenges and surprises.”


Andrground is well known for their short horror work, Elevated Dread, which is, coincidentally, the state of mind I perpetually exist in.


Troleu doesn’t really have a release date, so you’ll have to survive by watching the trailer repeatedly, as I have.

                              <span>Hello. I gathered you all here to tell you that water is wet. In other – perhaps equally obvious – news, Palworld continues to attract more players than some countries have citizens. As of this week, more than 25 million people have played Pocketpair&#x27;s monster-catching survival game.


That&#x27;s according to developer Pocketpair, who posted about the milestone achievement on Twitter/X recently. A simple breakdown of the figures suggests that 15 million of these players are from Steam, while the remaining 10 million are Xbox users. While folks on Steam have to buy a copy to join in, Palworld&#x27;s Xbox figures include some combination of players hopping in via Game Pass or buying the game through the Xbox storefront. 




To put that into some perspective, Bethesda boasted that 13 million players …</span>

The MW3 level reset issue is being addressed





According to CODUpdates on Twitter, the level reset issue in Modern Warfare 3 &quot;appeared overnight.&quot; As such, it doesn&#x27;t seem like the cause is known just yet. However, the developers are already hard at work looking to address the problem and fix it as soon as possible. In short, please don&#x27;t panic about your level, it will likely be back to normal within a reasonable amount of time (hopefully).

                              <span>Since Bethesda announced the studio would be teaming up with AMD prior to Starfield&#x27;s release, the two have barely left each other&#x27;s sides. As well as optimizing the game for Team Red&#x27;s hardware, there&#x27;s now a chance to win some PC hardware from the tech giant that&#x27;s themed after the game.


In a post on Twitter, Starfield has announced a giveaway, in which one lucky winner can win an AMD bundle. The prizes up for grabs include a Radeon RX 7900 XTX graphics card and a Ryzen 7 78003D CPU. Total value of these items: around $1,500.




To be in with a chance of winning, well, you&#x27;ve seen these sweepstakes before. Simply follow the above on Twitter and retweet (or &quot;repost&quot; as we&#x27;re meant to say now) to be entered.


Put a rush on that


You don&#x27;t have a huge amount of time, though. The winner is being drawn at random on February 28, according to the giveaway rules. So you only have until next Wednesday. Not that there&#x27;s any major rush. It literally takes seconds to enter.


There is actually a second chance of winning. Another post under the main one says the giveaway is also being run on the Starfield Discord channel, specifically for Constellation members.


You can throw another hat into the ring by – according to the post – heading to the Discord channel (what else?) and entering the competition via the &quot;exclusive Constellation channels.&quot; As always with these things, make sure you check the rules before participating, blah blah blah*.


*No seriously. Make sure you do understand the terms and conditions of these things.

                              <span>It had gotten fairly hard to keep track of Destiny 2&#x27;s many ups and downs in the year of Lightfall. From catastrophic layoffs to Bungie&#x27;s emergency-button rollout of long-anticipated new features, there&#x27;s whiplash trying to parse it all for the average player.


Amidst the &quot;soul-crushing&quot; backend production atmosphere, Bungie&#x27;s talented team of developers has managed to eke out a few more wins for the Destiny 2 community regardless — one would think that warrants major change to protect employees at the studio. As per the latest This Week in Destiny blog post, players have got much to look forward to in the coming weeks and months, highlights including substantial PvP updates (including the new Trials Card) and a refresh of the Prophecy Dungeon.

                              <span>It almost feels like Dead by Daylight should be running out of ideas. Incorporating icons from numerous horror franchises, surely the developer would run out. Seemingly not. Along with some new content coming in March, the asymmetrical survival game is also throwing up the horns for heavy metal.


For all you metalheads out there (yo!), this one&#x27;s for you. Dead by Daylight just launched a special collection that takes cues from the legendary Iron Maiden. More specifically, there are a number of outfits inspired by the band&#x27;s Eddie mascot.




The above video has announced that the collection is out now via the in-game store. You can get such variations as the Dredge, the Doctor, the Deathslinger, and the Oni. There are also some rare tour shirts for the original Survivors.


The download of the beast


I suppose something like this was bound to happen eventually. Horror and heavy metal go hand-in-hand. There&#x27;s just something about the loud and rebellious sound of rockin&#x27; guitars and violent video games that makes them such good bedfellows. I mean, just look at Brutal Legend (disappointing though that was).


This isn&#x27;t even the first time Iron Maiden has graced the world of gaming, either. Back in 2016, Nodding Frog Ltd released Legacy Beast RPG, a fantasy, turn-based role-playing game for mobile. Then there was the video game/greatest hits album Ed Hunter, released in 1999.


In short, Bruce Dickinson and co are not exactly strangers to our world, and Eddie joining Dead by Daylight sounds like a pretty good match. If only Behaviour Interactive had released it a couple of minutes before midnight...

Unfortunately, Arrowhead&#x27;s servers weren&#x27;t prepared for just how popular the game was going to be, which has led to frustrating issues. 



To minimize problems, the studio temporarily capped the concurrent player count to 450,000 which is a plaster on a large wound, as there are far more players than that who are desperate to blast Automatons. The solution was what we tolerated as Arrowhead works on limiting annoying problems such as mission payout failings and players getting suddenly kicked out mid-session. 





The cap has now been raised to 700,000 which is an improvement but it&#x27;s not quite enough to meet the demand. The studio&#x27;s CEO admits this on Twitter, but he hopes it…</span>

                              <span>After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora&#x27;s Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora&#x27;s Mask&#x27;s unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 1 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved. Archived episodes will be uploaded each Saturday on our second YouTube channel Game Informer Shows, which you can watch both above and by clicking the links below.

                              <span>Developer Team Ninja has released a new behind-the-scenes video for the upcoming PlayStation 5 exclusive, Rise of the Rōnin, and it features new gameplay showing off the game&#x27;s tough and fast action combat. Unsurprisingly, the game continues to look great. 
This new look at the game&#x27;s action features conversation from game producer and director Fumihiko Yasuda and animation lead Kosuke Wakamatsu discussing how Team Ninja approached the combat. They say it started with determining the different ideologies within Rōnin history, why certain individuals fought the way they did, and how that translates to a game aiming to be authentic to the Bakumatsu history.

                              <span>Death Stranding hit PlayStation 4 exclusively back in 2019 before launching on PC with a Director&#x27;s Cut in 2020. As we await Death Stranding 2: On The Beach, which is due out on PlayStation 5 in 2025, Disney Plus has dropped a documentary that might tide fans over. Titled Hideo Kojima: Connecting Worlds, this film &quot;explores the creative process behind Hideo Kojima launching his independent studio up to the completion of Death Stranding.&quot;
It was announced last year before debuting at the 2023 Tribeca Film Festival but starting today, you can stream it on Disney Plus.

We haven&#x27;t yet watched it but given Kojima&#x27;s love of movies, we&#x27;re excited to see what a documentary about the man himself is like. The release of Hideo Kojima: Connecting Worlds follows the debut of Grounded II: The Making of the Last of Us Part II, which also provided a behind-the-scenes look at video game development. 
For more, read Game Informer&#x27;s Death Stranding review and then read about why Death Stranding Director&#x27;s Cut is worth another trek across America. After that, watch the latest trailer for Death Stranding 2: On The Beach, which is expectedly weird.

                              <span>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth hits PlayStation 5 exclusively on February 29, but reviews for Square Enix&#x27;s latest entry in its Final Fantasy VII remake trilogy dropped yesterday. We enjoyed the game a lot, and you can read about why in Game Informer&#x27;s Final Fantasy VII Rebirth review. It turns out, a lot of reviewers enjoyed the game too, because at the time of this writing, it&#x27;s the second-highest rated game in the Final Fantasy series on Metacritic, as noted by video game sales analyst Benji-Sales on X (formerly Twitter). 
Currently sitting at a 93 on Metacritic, which aggregates various reviews into a single Metacritic score, only one other Final Fantasy game has been rated higher: Final Fantasy IX on PlayStation 1. It has a 94 on Metacritic.
There’s only 6 Final Fantasy games that have gone above a 90 Metacritic score.

As you can see above, with a 93 on Metacritic, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth joins a prestigious list of games in the series with a Metacritic score of 90 or higher, as pointed out by AndSpaceY on X. Now, it&#x27;s important to note that some Final Fantasy games are not rated on Metacritic as the aggregate site was not around when they released. For example, Final Fantasy VI is one of the most beloved entries in the franchise and arguably the best – released in 1994 on the SNES, Metacritic was not around at the time so it does not have a rating on the site. 
Still, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth rating so high is another example of how Square Enix&#x27;s Final Fantasy VII remake project is landing with both critics and fans alike.

                              <span>Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League, the third-person live-service multiplayer shooter from Batman: Arkham series developer Rocksteady Studios, launched earlier this month. It received middling reviews – read Game Informer&#x27;s review here to find out why we gave it a 6 out of 10 – and fans have been less-than-impressed with the shooter. It seems Warner Bros. Discovery is less-than-impressed, too, as the company said in its latest financial call that Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League had &quot;fallen short of our expectations,&quot; as reported by IGN. 


More specifically, that&#x27;s Warner Bros. Discovery chief financial officer Gunnar Wiedenfels who said Rocksteady&#x27;s latest effort fell short of the company&#x27;s expectations. However, Wiedenfels did not mention a sales figure. According to IGN, the executive lamented that Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League&#x27;s missed expectations set Warner Bros.&#x27; games division up for a tough year when it comes to year-on-year comparisons.
Wiedenfels is likely alluding to Hogwarts Legacy, the company&#x27;s massive hit that launched last year and went on to become the best-selling game of 2023, beating out titles like The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III. The sales of Hogwarts Legacy was certainly a tough act for Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League to follow.

                              <span>Penny&#x27;s Big Breakaway, the momentum-based 3D platformer from developer Evening Star, surprise launched earlier this week after appearing in a Partner Showcase Nintendo Direct. During a livestream held by Evening Star on the game&#x27;s February 21 launch, one designer completed the first level with a single, two-minute combo, and it&#x27;s a feat to behold. 
If you haven&#x27;t yet checked out Penny&#x27;s Big Breakaway, it&#x27;s a 3D platformer modeled off the strange and weird platformers of the PlayStation 1 generation, rather than Nintendo&#x27;s popular platforming efforts. As such, the game features a unique moveset that feels similar to Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater, with a Devil May Cry combo meter to boot. 
Check out the Evening Star developer reach a massive 191-move combo in the first stage of Vanillatown, the first world in Penny&#x27;s Big Breakaway, below: 
Vanillatown 1-1 100% in just 1 combo!?

As you can see, this designer – Milena – completes the first level with one continuous combo. We&#x27;re not sure we&#x27;re quite up to the task but we wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if fans of the game spend time outcomboing this score. Only time will tell. 
Penny&#x27;s Big Breakaway is now available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC.

                              <span>It’s been a long time since Little Devil Inside, a promising survival action RPG from indie developer Neostream, has made any noise. The game’s last substantial update came in October 2021. But after over two years of silence, Neostream has come back with a new trailer and cryptic update hinting at what’s been going on with the team.
As reported by The Indie Informer, Neostream’s Kickstarter post, published yesterday, apologizes for the lack of updates and cryptically alludes to an internal conflict within the team, potentially due to clashing visions about the game, being one of the causes. It states in part,
The rest of Neostream&#x27;s update indicates the team has reduced in size but confirms that the founders and core members remain at the studio. The studio assures backers that Little Devil Inside still exists and that it is currently discussing publishing before it can give fans a more substantial update. Until then, the team has prepared a six-minute montage video showing off the game running in Unreal Engine 5.


Little Devil Inside was first revealed way back in 2015 with the launch of its Kickstarter campaign, but it gained its first mainstream recognition as part of the 2020 PlayStation 5 showcase prior to the console&#x27;s launch. You play as an explorer who embarks on research mission at the behest of a university professor to explore a large world filled with beasts both real and supernatural. You&#x27;ll visit different towns along the way to meet quirky citizens, defend yourself from threats with a sword, and engage in survival mechanics like camping and cooking. Despite how much time as past, we ultimately still know relatively little about Little Devil Inside but it has remained a charmer each time it resurfaces. 
Little Devil Inside has no release window but we&#x27;re hoping to learn more concrete details in the near future.</span>

American retailer Walmart has accidentally revealed the next Pokémon Squishmallow.
Spotted by u/Britzaaaa on the Squishmallow subreddit (via Siliconera), Dragonite will be one of the next Pokémon to feature in the collection. The listing has since been removed by Walmart, but it seems likely that we&#x27;ll be getting this one soon. And my goodness, it looks so adorable and so silly.

Nintendo usually follows up its presentations with one of these a few days after they air, and the company has delivered once again, creating a one-stop shop for every game we got to see on Wednesday 21st February 2024.

                              <span>A bountiful harvest.
Fans of Nintendo’s long-running Picross series are well aware that there’s no shortage of nonogram puzzlers on the Switch, with developer Jupiter and the Big N’s franchise alone accounting for over a dozen games and counting so far. Even so, there’s an addictive simplicity to the core concept that ensures that further entries will always be welcome, especially when they mix with popular IP like the Sega Genesis and, uh… Kemono Friends. Nintendo certainly doesn’t have a monopoly on the concept of a nonogram puzzle, either, leaving the door open for other publishers like Rainy Frog and developer Score Studio to introduce their own franchises that use the concept, such as Piczle Cross. The latest entry in the Piczle Cross series merges the timeless puzzling action with the chill vibes of the Story of Seasons franchise and though Piczle Cross: Story of Seasons isn’t exactly a revolutionary new entry in the genre, it still ticks all the boxes to provide a satisfying puzzle experience.
Gameplay in Piczle Cross could be most closely likened to a mixture of Minesweeper and sudoku puzzles, tasking the player with methodically deducing a solution by process of elimination. You’re presented with a grid that’s anywhere from 5x5 to 20x20 squares in size, with the edges of each row and column containing hint numbers that indicate how many squares you have to fill in. Which squares you need to fill in is always a mystery, however, so you need to use the hint numbers to carefully rule out which ones you can safely mark off and which need to be filled in. Puzzles can last anywhere from a few seconds to about 20 minutes apiece, with the final product always revealing some cute pixel art rendition of a random farm-related item or person.

After what felt like months of rumours, Microsoft and Nintendo finally put us out of our misery during the Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase by confirming that, yes, select Microsoft-published Xbox games will be making their way to the Nintendo Switch to join the likes of Banjo-Kazooie on NSO, and the Ori duo.
Heck, one of them — Obsidian&#x27;s Pentiment — is available to download right now (with a physical version also on the way), but Nintendo fans can also look forward to Grounded in the near future. We were expecting to see both Hi-Fi RUSH and Sea of Thieves, but alas, while both of those have been confirmed for release on the PS5, there is currently no sign of them on Nintendo&#x27;s platform.

                              <span>Starter for Eight.
Splatoon 3’s Side Order has been dangling just out of reach since it was revealed in 2023, but Wave 2 of the DLC has finally landed for Splatoon 3 Expansion Pass owners. Nearly five years after the release of Splatoon 2’s Octo Expansion, Agent Eight’s story continues in the drab and colourless world of the Memverse, but is it worth the train fare to reach this particular station?
Let’s be blunt, Side Order is a roguelite, meaning there’s a series of semi-random levels you must beat sequentially in order to triumph. The catch? If you run out of lives, you’re sent right back to the start. Note the ‘t’ in the genre name, though, as unlike a roguelike, you can unlock bonuses and boons to make each subsequent run up the tower that little bit easier.

                              <span>Ubisoft boss Yves Guillemot recently said Skull And Bones is a &quot;quadruple-A game&quot;, which I think is very accurate, actually. &quot;AAAA&quot; is the sound that escapes my lips as I embark on yet another hour-long sail to retrieve some logs, or when I&#x27;m doing my little deliveries and a brigantine starts on me. After 11 years in development, Ubisoft&#x27;s pirate game isn&#x27;t necessarily a disaster, I just think its live service model has transformed piracy from a roguish lark on the waves into a tremendously dull series of shipping tasks.

                              <span>When dramatic parents panicked over the satanic influence of Doom in the 90s, maybe they had a point. Doom has burned through people&#x27;s souls and minds, filling them with a desire to play Id Software&#x27;s seminal shooter on every device they can. The question &quot;Can it run Doom?&quot; has driven these demonic vassals to make it playable on everything from tractors to teletext. These hellbound hearts are even daring to corrupt the totemic device of American liberty: the lawnmower. Come April, you will be able to play Doom on the Husqvarna Nera line of robotic automowers. Is nothing sacred?

But that&#x27;s as it should be: if you want to appreciate what Arrowhead&#x27;s Starship Troop &#x27;em up shares with Konami&#x27;s open world stealth bonanza, it&#x27;s better to Helldive on your lonesome.

                              <span>Lil Guardsman is a game that wears its heart on its sleeve. In a victory for normative determinism, this is a fantasy adventure about a small girl named Lil who somehow becomes the first (and seemingly only) line of defence at a city’s border patrol as a guardsman. At various points, both Lil and those around her frequently call attention to the fact that, yes, you are merely a 12-year-old child who is massively underqualified for this task, and that if you’re going to continue filling in for your good for nothing father who’s down the pub gambling on the latest ball game, then really, what do your superiors expect? It’s very self-aware in that sense, and occasionally verges on breaking the fourth wall. This alone will probably be a fairly good indicator of whether you’ll gel with Lil Guardsman’s sense of humour or not, but for the most part, this is a sweet and jovial narrative adventure whose characterful animation and charming voice cast help bring this oddball tale of fate and consequence to life.
It&#x27;s also not shy about where it’s taken its main source of inspiration from either. This is fantasy Papers, Please through and though, albeit one that’s more about interrogating and probing would-be citygoers for information than checking documents and spotting inconsistencies. During the day you’ll be working your post, dealing with the increasingly large, but fixed queues of fantasy species all trying to enter the city gate to go about their business. When you&#x27;re off the clock, it&#x27;s time to pick up the game&#x27;s wider plotlines, with Lil able to travel around the city to set locations where she can chat with other townsfolk, sometimes partake in the odd mini-game or two, and visit the local shop before toddling off to bed. It’s admittedly quite a straightforward interpretation of Lucas Pope’s magnum opus, with star ratings denoting clear right and wrong answers for how you deal with each day’s horde, but you know what they say about first impressions. Good ones go a long way.

                              <span>I know this sort of thing has been said before around these parts, but in scanning through the endless reams of Steam Next Fest demos earlier this month and trying to work out what these games are and whether they&#x27;re worth downloading, I truly believe it&#x27;s a sentiment that&#x27;s worth repeating. When I first saw the name C.A.R.D.S RPG: The Misty Battlefield appear on the Next Fest landing page, I instantly thought, &#x27;Yes, here we go, now we&#x27;re talking&#x27;. 
Well, my first thought was actually, &#x27;Gee, if only there was an easy way to know what this game&#x27;s about based on just the title alone,&#x27; but that&#x27;s just me being facetious. Ultimately, I have a lot of respect for this kind of naming convention, and the fact it&#x27;s also being made by the Octopath Traveler developers Acquire is really just the icing on the cake.

                              <span>What happens when you combine two great puzzle games? You get one puzzle game which makes me, an accredited professional fool, feel dizzy with noncomprehension. That game is Sokobond Express, which launched yesterday and combines the atom-shoving chemistry of Sokobond with the route-planning puzzling of Cosmic Express. So you have to draw paths around a grid to gather atoms to correctly build a desired molecule. That&#x27;s all. Just molecular chemistry and pathing, at the same time. Oh, my poor foolish head.

                              <span>I&#x27;m not sure exactly what I was expecting from Graven, but it still feels like it wasn&#x27;t quite what I expected. That&#x27;s both good and bad. It has the look of a 90s throwback FPS, the cool atmosphere and action RPG (barely RPG, really, restricted to which weapons you upgrade) combat of something from the 2000s like Rune or Dark Messiah, with a hint of a modern immersive sim. There is, I think, a better game to be made with those parts in a different arrangement. This one is only kinda good.

                              <span>This week&#x27;s Nintendo Direct was stuffed full of games that will also be making their way to PC over the next few months, but the one I haven&#x27;t been able to stop thinking about is the newly-announced Arranger: A Role-Puzzling Adventure. It&#x27;s the debut game from a team of indie devs that include Braid artist David Hellman, Carto writer Nick Suttner and Ethereal designer Nicolás Recabarren, and they&#x27;ve also partnered with composer Tomás Batista, who did the music for both Ethereal and Martian colony builder Per Aspera. It&#x27;s a pretty stacked line-up as these things go, but it&#x27;s Arranger&#x27;s world of constantly shifting sliding tiles that&#x27;s really piqued my curiosity. Come and watch the lovely announcement trailer below and see what I mean.

                              <span>Credit to Nightingale, I’ve been enjoying the early access form of Inflexion’s gaslamp fantasy survival crafter a fair bit more than I did its older stress test build. The UI is cleaner and tighter, and I’ve had more space to explore (and enjoy) the mysterious nooks of its magic &#x27;n&#x27; moustaches world. There’s potential here, but it’s very much the raw kind, especially when performance needs as much work as it does.
Besides relying on upscalers like DLSS for truly smooth running, Nightingale currently has a serious stuttering problem, and bumping into an ugly graphical artefact or even a hard crash is worryingly common. I’ve pulled together an optimised settings guide (down below) so that you don’t need to drop the visual quality lower than is strictly necessary, but do keep in mind that this is early access with emphasis on the early.

                              <span>Yesterday I was off sick with a fever and, as I often do when I&#x27;m laid up ill, immediately set out to consume the most nihilistic and depressing entertainment media I could find. On the film front, I watched Session 9, in which some men hired to remove asbestos from a collapsing 19th century asylum do not have a very nice time. On the game front, I played The Tribe Must Survive, a colony management sim from Walking Tree Games GmbH and Starbreeze Publishing, which is now available in early access.

                              <span>After launching Nightingale into early access on Tuesday, developers Inflexion Games (led by former BioWare CEO Aaryn Flynn) have quickly realised a big miscalculation: lots of players want an offline mode. The gaslamp fantasy survival game requires you be online even if you want to play by yourself, which dovetailed poorly with server issues at launch to frustrate folks. Inflexion say that early in development they needed to make a choice between focusing on co-op or offline first, and now think they made the wrong call. They plan to remedy this, but it&#x27;s not yet clear when they&#x27;ll actually add an offline mode.

                              <span>From Software president Hidetaka Miyazaki has acknowledged that members of the Dark Souls studio had misgivings about Elden Ring&#x27;s shift to a full-blown open world format, while qualifying that Elden Ring&#x27;s vision for an open world was never &quot;traditional&quot;. Rather, Elden Ring is an &quot;open world&quot; game in the same way that Dark Souls is a &quot;hard&quot; game, Miyazaki feels. Confused? Well, this is the godfather of the notoriously unforthcoming Souls series we&#x27;re talking about. I&#x27;ve never interviewed the guy, but I suspect he composes his responses using the game&#x27;s soapstone messaging system.

                              <span>Intel&#x27;s Optane drives are legendary in PC tech circles, offering random performance and low latency that remains unmatched amongst PCIe 3.0 drives. This Intel Optane 905P drive is the biggest they ever made at 1.5TB, and now it&#x27;s reduced to $380 when you use code SYADP2Z384 at Newegg. 
For systems that accept PCIe 4.0 or PCIe 5.0 drives, I&#x27;d recommend sticking with our usual gaming SSD recommendations, but for PCIe 3.0 systems this is a fascinating option that emphasises random performance against sequential speeds. I recorded some of the very fastest game load times with this drive when I tested it against other PCIe 3.0 options, and its random write speeds are competitive even with later generation PCIe 4.0 alternatives.

                              <span>After a decade-long hiatus, EA Sports&#x27; College Football is coming back. Not only is it reviving a beloved series for football fans, but it&#x27;s also bringing all 134 FBS (formerly Division I-A) schools along for the ride.


It&#x27;s no Mutant Football League, but it&#x27;ll do


First released as Bill Walsh College Football in 1993, the series was renamed College Football USA in 1996, and NCAA Football in 1998. Then, the NCAA opted not to renew its licensing contract with EA in 2013 due to a legal dispute regarding player likenesses. Despite plans to continue under the College Football name, EA put a pause on the series after several conferences revoked their licenses with the publisher.


Screenshot via EASPORTSCollege on X


On February 2, 2021, the official EASPORTSCollege X account made a post stating &quot;College Football is coming back.&quot; Fast forward to this morning with the announcement that all 134 FBS schools would be in the next entry in the series, College Football 25.


Additionally, per The Athletic, players on any of the teams within the included 134 FBS schools can opt-in for inclusion in the title. In return, they&#x27;ll receive $600 and a copy of the game. Initial rosters will include up to 85 players and those who don&#x27;t opt-in will have a generic avatar as their stand-in. The Athletic anticipates at least 11,000 players to be represented, so EA would be shelling out $6.6M at minimum if they all opt in. With that kind of payout, EA needs to ship a massive number of copies to recoup costs.


Fortunately for the publisher, college football in the States is a huge business, with individual teams in the Big Ten generating upwards of $134M a year. After a 10-year absence, EA could be well-poised to strike, like an oilman in the Texas oil boom.

                              <span>A previously PC-only turn-based strategy game, Warhammer 40K: Chaos Gate - Daemonhunters is now available on Xbox and PlayStation consoles. PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Xbox One owners can now play the Warhammer universe-based adventure for the first time. I&#x27;ve spent some time playing it on PC already, so here&#x27;s what you&#x27;re getting, console players.


What console players should expect


Chaos Gate - Daemonhunters is a turn-based strategy game developed by Complex Games. It takes place in the Warhammer 40,000 universe, like Darktide, Space Marine, Rogue Trader, and Boltgun, for example. This simply means it uses characters, creatures, environments, and lore from the franchise.

                              <span>If roguelites, transforming robots, and tearing corrupt corporations down from within are all on your to-do list, Metal Mind might just be up your alley. Publisher 2P Games announced that the latest from developer WHIRLLAXY LIMITED is set to launch on Nintendo Switch and PC (via Epic Games Store) on March 7, 2024.


Any of the ideas here might not be novel on their own, but the trailer certainly has my interest piqued. I&#x27;ll admit, a lot of that has to do with the visuals. Yes, it&#x27;s another pixel art roguelite, but so far I&#x27;m digging the designs, effects, and how it all appears to work in tandem with the core customization mechanic. 


Throw in a plot to liberate your fellow robots and overthrow an organization full of crooked politicians, scientists, engineers, and secret agents and you have my attention.




The aforementioned nogoodniks at the corporation known as AWC are looking to remove sentience from robots and exercise total control over every single automaton. Naturally, that means you have to build your own transforming mecha with the help of more than 100 weapons and a variety of core component mods. The weapons can range from rapid-fire naval artillery to flaming chainsaws and laser cannons, and they can be augmented with mods that address overheating issues, raise your firing rate, and more. 


The level of randomization that comes along with weapon and mod pickups moves Metal Mind firmly into roguelite territory, hopefully keeping each run interesting Beyond that, it looks like the meat of the game lies in mixing and matching what you find and the top-down combat that follows. When Metal Mind makes its way to Switch and Epic Games Store it&#x27;ll be priced at $17.99 with a 15% discount at launch.

                              <span>Two years after Elden Ring was released, we finally got our first look at the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC. From cryptic teases to ghastly enemies, it had it all, and it sounds like there will still be some challenges in store for those seeking more of them.


Through interviews at IGN and Eurogamer with director Hidetaka Miyazaki and other places, including the trailer itself, we&#x27;ve got a clearer picture of what&#x27;s waiting for us in this new adventure.




01. There will be hardcore challenges


For those of you looking for a challenge, Miyazaki has good news, as he states to IGN: &quot;To our more hardcore players, they will find optional bosses who have been tuned in a similar way to the likes of Malenia, who I&#x27;m sure you remember from the base game, who are not crucial.&quot;

                              <span>D4 Enterprise is continuing the pace of PC-88 games releasing on Switch under their EggConsole label with 1987’s Hydlide3: The Space Memories. Like many of their recent releases, it has the caveat of being untranslated.


A couple months ago, we got the first Hydlide. Not having a translation was fine there since it didn’t have much text to begin with, but Hydlide3 has menus, stat windows, and dialogue that relies on knowledge of Japanese. It’s probably still doable without knowledge of the language, but it could be more comfortable.




The Hydlide series is sometimes thought of as a progenitor of the JRPG, predating Dragon Quest, though the combat is Ys-style bumping rather than turn-based. Hydlide 3, however, has an attack button, which does away with the bumping and makes it feel more akin to Zelda. There’s also a day/night system and even morality.


A port for the Genesis/Mega Drive actually made its way to North America under the title Super Hydlide. Whether it’s good or not depends on your tastes. Both contemporary and recent critics suggest that it’s a very difficult game, and some like its hardcore flavor while others are repulsed by it. Me? I haven’t played it, but I’m probably going to. I’ve said this before, but while rereleasing untranslated games from a Japanese home computer is catering to an extremely niche audience, it’s one that I fit into.


EggConsole Hydlide3 PC-8801mkIISR is out today on Switch.

                              <span>For those of you with conflicting feelings about making calamari of your fellow Octolings and Inklings, you can rejoice as Wave 2 of the Splatoon 3 Expansion Pass, Side Order, launched today. With none of that nasty PvP business, you can focus on ethically annihilating other species.


You got Nier: Automata in my Splatoon 3 DLC!


The Splatoon 3 Expansion Pass was announced during the February 2023 Nintendo Direct. Priced at $24.99 and divided into two waves, players were able to return to the original Splatoon hub, Inkopolis, in Wave 1. It didn&#x27;t feature a whole lot of new content aside from the Squid Sisters performing during Splatfests and thus, was underwhelming for those without a strong sense of nostalgia.




Side Order puts players in control of Agent 8 who must figure out why Inkopolis Square has been drained of color. Working with Pod, err... Pearl, Agent 8 works up each level of The Spire of Order, much like Aya Brea in Parasite Eve&#x27;s Chrysler Building back in 1998. 


Designed as a roguelite, players must ascend as far as possible, collecting Color Chip Enhancements along the way and completing objectives. On each floor, players choose one of three objectives to complete. Each choice gives a Color Chip Enhancement, which goes onto the overall palette and offers a wide range of buffs and modifiers. When you eventually fall, your Chips will be converted into Prlz which can be spent on permanent upgrades. It&#x27;s your standard roguelite and while it&#x27;s not Vampire Survivors, it&#x27;s no slouch either.


In the wake of other, arguably larger, Nintendo news, like practically everything announced yesterday during Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase, it&#x27;s understandable that Wave 2 of the Splatoon 3 Expansion Pass would slide under the radar. Regardless, if you&#x27;ve been looking for a reason to get back into Splatoon 3, this is it.

                              <span>Last Epoch left early access on February 21, resulting in a sudden influx of players checking out the full release. How many players? On the day Last Epoch officially launched, SteamDB recorded a peak of over 152,000 concurrent players. One day later, the figure has grown to more than 176,000 players, and it’s not even a weekend.


With so many gamers clamoring to play online, the Diablo-like’s servers have been stretched to their limits. I tried to play co-op with a friend on launch day, and while we were able to play together, we definitely felt the servers straining under the load. It took a couple of tries to form a party. The actual gameplay felt great, but transitioning to new areas was often a crapshoot. Scene transitions would sometimes take minutes, if not time out completely.

Sony has just announced that it is &quot;currently testing the ability for PS VR2 players to access additional games on PC.&quot; The launch window for this game-changing (pun intended) feature is planned for 2024, so you won&#x27;t have to wait too long to finally make the most of your pricy add-on. 


When it comes to VR headsets available, the PS VR2 is about as good as it gets with some specs that are nothing to scoff at. Compared to the Quest 3, PlayStation&#x27;s device surpasses it in almost every way. For instance, the VR2 has a gorgeous 2000 x 2040-pixel OLED screen while the Quest 3 sports a 206…</span>

                              <span>Just two days after launch, Inflexion Games announced that the developer is now prioritizing the development of an offline mode for Nightingale. In its current state, Nightingale requires a consistent online connection to the game servers. Having just released into Early Access, this is what every player hopes to see. A developer open to changing its game to fit community feedback, which it appears Inflexion is willing to do.




Adding online to a connected world


Without a doubt, the biggest hurdle for adding an offline mode to Nightingale is going to be at a fundamental design level. One of the core systems of Nightingale is that all of the Realms or worlds are connected via a portal network, creating an interconnected series of Realms. As such, Nightingale is more of a universe of con…</span>

                              <span>It&#x27;s a sad day in MOBA land as Paragon: The Overprime is being shut down...again. It would seem that a new developer and a slight name change weren&#x27;t enough to save the third-person MOBA from a second death.


Rule #2: Double Tap


The Netmarble team made the announcement on February 21 that Paragon: the Overprime would be shutting down on April 22, 2024. This is a little over a year since the title went into early access on December 8, 2022. The reasoning for the decision is the inability &quot;...to provide a stable and satisfying service moving forward.&quot;

This isn&#x27;t the first time that the Paragon franchise has heard the death knell. After launching in March 2016, the MOBA was shut down in March 2018, following an official Reddit post stating that a number of staff had been moved to Fortnite in the wake of its massive success. After being shut down, Epic Games released $17M worth of Paragon assets for free to all Unreal Engine 4 developers, including 29 characters and over 1,500 environment components.


Despite a few other studios making use of the Paragon assets, Epic Games ultimately granted Netmarble the full rights to the license in October 2022, which led to the studio&#x27;s title being rebranded Paragon: The Overprime. With the release of a new hero, Terra, less than a month ago, this end-of-service announcement seems abrupt. Either way, if you&#x27;re a long-time fan or were mildly curious, now is the time to jump in as the servers will go dark in April.

                              <span>PowerWash Simulator is no stranger to unusual collaborations. From Final Fantasy VII to SpongeBob SquarePants, this compelling cleaning sim is willing to tackle dirt no matter where it may be. Following a series of teasing posts on X by the PowerWash Simulator account, we finally have a release date for what might be the most ambitious crossover yet, Warhammer 40,000.


Use the might of the powerwasher to purge the unclean


PowerWash Simulator leaps to the 41st Millennium to clean the various instruments of death and destruction of the Warhammer 40,000 universe on February 27, 2024. Players will be able to clean everything from a Rogal Dorn battle tank to an Imperial Knight and even an entire Sacristan Forgeshrine. There isn&#x27;t a price listed yet, but I would expect it to be in line with other, non-Square Enix, collaborations at $7.99.




I&#x27;ll admit that I know next to nothing about Warhammer 40,000, but my love for powerwashing might lead me down a dangerous path of learning deep lore and using my savings account on minis. As I trade in my gills from Bikini Bottom for a sacred MKII Aqua-Santica Arquebus powerwasher, I step into a world filled with fanaticism, endless war, and utterly filthy machines.


Even if I ultimately don&#x27;t fall head over heels in love with Warhammer 40,000, I&#x27;ll take any excuse to boot up one of my favorite titles and zone out to the hum of a powerwasher. Still, I wouldn&#x27;t be opposed to seeing some of the masters in the Warhammer community fashioning powerwashers for their minis.

At the time, it launched to relative obscurity, and was mostly kept alive by dedicated play-by-email multiplayer groups. It was through one of these groups that Armello developers League Of Geeks first came into contact with it, and now, years later, have taken on the task of remaking Solium Infernum for a modern audience.
The original Solium was, by all accounts, an intensely knotty and dense affair, impenetrable to newcomers, or at least to those who were unprepared (or unwilling) to study and absorb all the countless variations and statistics involved in creating your own unique Archfiend. It was a bit like creating a D&amp;D character sheet, only about ten times more complicated, and whose strategic implications may or may not have made themselves apparent until it was far too late. You could biff yourself before you began, in other words, and League Of Geeks have made admirable attempts to tame and streamline this unruly hell beast, doing away with a lot of that initial fussiness. As is perhaps fitting for the theme here, there are unfortunately still a few pesky gremlins causing mayhem behind the scenes at time of writing (I&#x27;m pointing the finger at literal bug queen Beelzebub for this), but for the most part, there&#x27;s good fun to be had in this new incarnation of Solium Infernum - and particularly if you have some willing friends who you soon hope to call enemies.

                              <span>Every few years, gorgeous action adventure Little Devil Inside re-surfaces with another stunning, exciting trailer. We last saw it at a PlayStation State Of Play back in 2021, where it was seemingly on track for a 2022 release.

It&#x27;s been radio silence ever since, but it has now once again resurfaced, with another gorgeous trailer and a promise that the development team, now smaller, is back &quot;with the duty and conscience to fulfill what we set out to do.&quot;

                              <span>As Helldivers 2 continues to be struggling with its own success, suffering wildly overloaded servers that make it sometimes tricky to even log in, a new patch today has added a feature to help alleviate the pressure. Having previously capped the number of players to 450,000, developers Arrowhead have now added an auto-kick to stop people hogging those precious slots while not playing. After 15 minutes, AFK players will now get booted. It&#x27;s clearly not the big fix needed but hopefully fresh duct tape will help hold the co-op shooter together until more permanent solutions arrive.

We also reminisce about our other favourite gaming crossovers, and try to dream up some cross-universe mashups of our own.
Plus! We talk about what we’ve been playing this week, consider whether we would &quot;RoboCop ourselves,&quot; and I disgust Alice with a confectionary confession.

                              <span>Flintlock: The Siege Of Dawn is one of those third person action adventure games I&#x27;ve been quietly looking forward to ever since I first read about it in Edge in May 2022, even though we&#x27;ve seen and heard relatively little about it since. Thankfully, the Flintlock train does seem to be kicking into a gear a bit more now that it&#x27;s steaming toward its Summer 2024 release window, as yesterday developers A44 Games released a new gameplay teaser trailer for it, ahead of a wider reveal planned for next month. The trailer shows more of its melee and magical combat, though personally, I&#x27;m just glad to see that heroine Nor hasn&#x27;t been neglecting her leg days, as we get to see some meaty and powerful kicks in there, too. Love a big kick, me.

While developers Io Interactive did eventually start bringing back Elusive Targets due to popular demand/widespread frustration, some have proved more elusive than others. Four years since he last appeared, a target played by famous dier Sean Bean will return in March. Kill him, kill him while you can. It&#x27;s what he would want. It&#x27;s how he pays his rent. Craft services don&#x27;t even offer him a cuppa until he croaks.

                              <span>Yesterday&#x27;s Nintendo Direct got rather overshadowed by a certain trailer for Elden Ring: Shadow Of The Erdtree, but there were still plenty of good news nuggets to be had in there for us PC folks - which I&#x27;ve summarised for you below. The long and short of it is: more release dates! Loads of &#x27;em! And they&#x27;re all coming in the first half of 2024 as well. I love it when a schedule comes together.

                              <span>As expected, Microsoft yesterday confirmed that four of their games are headed to rival consoles: Pentiment to PlayStations 4 &amp; 5 and Nintendo Switch; Hi-Fi Rush to PS5; Grounded to PS4, PS5, and Switch; and Sea Of Thieves to PS5. It&#x27;s nice to see barriers between systems coming down and all, and it&#x27;ll likely have consequences of note to serious businessheads, but what relevance does this have for us as a PC gaming website? Well! Grounded and Sea Of Thieves will support cross-platform multiplayer, so we&#x27;ll be able to play them with our consolatory chums. That&#x27;s nice.

                              <span>There&#x27;s a little masochistic streak in me that croons with joy whenever I reach the moment of impending doom in turn-based strategy games. You know the moment I mean. The one where the world fills with enemies patiently bobbing and snarling while you try to conjure up an impossibly perfect set of moves that&#x27;ll keep things going for one more turn? Cobalt Core is great at this. I&#x27;ve only played a couple of runs so far, but boy, you&#x27;d better believe I know when the end is drawing near. It&#x27;s hard to miss, because the entire screen fills up with rows of damage numbers beaming down onto your hapless little spaceship.

                              <span>Shin Megami Tensei 5 is getting the Persona 5 Royal treatment, with an all-new Shin Megami Tensei 5: Vengeance edition that&#x27;s out in June. It features a new story path, an improved battle system, new areas, and more, as you&#x27;d expect from Atlus&#x27; history of definitive editions. What&#x27;s more, while SMT 5 was a Switch exclusive when it came out in 2021, the new Vengeance edition will be heading to PC and other consoles, too. Do I have time for another enormous JRPG? Probably not, but I&#x27;ll admit that it&#x27;s got me very interested indeed.

The music companies, including UMG and Sony, counter the statute of limitations argument. In addition, they stress that &quot;hisses, crackles, and pops&quot; on old records are flaws, not a license to copy and digitize the music.

At least five people were arrested on suspicion of various crimes including theft of telecommunications services, fraud, and money laundering. A key suspect targeted in an earlier operation was out of the country. The action follows a criminal complaint filed by companies including Bell, Videotron, and Rogers.

                              <span>PlayStation VR2 launched in February of last year and while its debut featured new first-party titles like Horizon Call of the Mountain, our favorites on the new platform featured previously released titles like Resident Evil Village. Since that launch, support for the platform has been sparse, to say the least, especially from PlayStation itself. However, Sony has revealed it is currently testing PC support for PS VR2, with hopes to make that support available this year. 
&quot;[We&#x27;re] pleased to share that we are currently testing the ability for PS VR2 players to access additional games on PC to offer even more game variety in addition to the PS VR2 titles available through PS5,&quot; a new PlayStation Blog post published today reads. &quot;We hope to make this support available in 2024, so stay tuned for more updates.&quot;


The rest of the blog goes on to detail new and upcoming titles coming to PS VR2, but those are going to be playable with PlayStation 5 consoles. However, it sounds like PC support, which could open up a flood gate for new VR content, might arrive later this year. 
For more about the hardware, read Game Informer&#x27;s PS VR2 review, and then read Game Informer&#x27;s Horizon Call of the Mountain review. After that, read about why Resident Evil Village is the PS VR2&#x27;s best exclusive, and then check out these 10 games to play using your VR headset.

                              <span>Riot Games has rechristened Project L, its upcoming League of Legends fighting game, to its official name of 2XKO. While we still don’t know when it’s coming, we do get another look at it in a new trailer.


The 2D 2v2 tag-team fighter looks very promising based on today’s footage. The game takes cues from Marvel vs Capcom in its assist-focused tag team play and utilizes more simplified inputs to lower the barrier for entry while maintaining strategic depth. Based on previous updates, online play features rollback netcode. Set in the world of Runterra, 2XKO features a roster of League of Legends champions, including Darius, Ekko, Ahri, and Yasuo. As Riot states on the game’s website, it’s still “heads down” working on updates to share, so a release window may not be coming in the near future. 
2XKO was first announced as Project L in 2019 alongside other League of Legends projects, including what would later become Valorant and LoL: Wild Rift. Hopefully, it will cross the finish line sooner than later. What do you think of the game&#x27;s official title and this fresh look at gameplay? Let us know in the comments.</span>

                              <span>Palworld first captured the attention of gamers (and their internet sphere) when it was revealed back in 2021. While that reveal included details about the survival aspects of the game, including multiplayer, crafting, and farming, viewers honed in on the idea of it being Pokémon but with guns. You can capture Pokémon-like monsters called Pals in special balls (and you can capture humans, too), but it&#x27;s smart to shoot them or hack at them with an axe first to lower their health. And then, once under your command, you can give them their own guns to use, of course. 
Following various trailers since that 2021 reveal, including this gameplay showcase and this one highlighting the different Pals you can find, we learned at Geoff Keighely&#x27;s Summer Game Fest last year that Palworld would finally…</span>

                              <span>Mortal Kombat 1 reset the fighting universe when it launched on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC last September. Now, it&#x27;s time for a new fighter from a different universe to join the roster. John Cena&#x27;s Peacemaker, the hero that first appeared in 2021&#x27;s The Suicide Squad and later in his epoynomous HBO Max series, joins the game next week on February 28. 
Ahead of his release, NetherRealm Studios has released the first look at Peacemaker&#x27;s gameplay in Mortal Kombat 1, and it features a lot of justice, a lot of peace, and, of course, a lot of blood. 
Check out the Peacemaker gameplay trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see in the trailer above, Peacemaker is voiced by Cena himself and features moves inspired by the character&#x27;s live-action counterpart. That includes the fatality, which starts with Peacemaker ripping Quan-Chi in half by way of jet pack before sonic booming the rest of his body into bits. 
Peacemaker hits the Mortal Kombat 1 roster on February 28 for those who own the Premium Edition of the game or the Kombat Pack. Peacemaker goes live for individual purchase on March 6. 
Elsewhere in this trailer, we learn that Janet Cage is joining the game as a new Kameo fighter in March – she&#x27;s an alternate version of Johnny Cage from a different reality. We also learn that crossplay (or Krossplay as NetherRealm calls it) will go live on February 28, allowing PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (via Steam and the Epic Games Store) players to fight against each other in-game. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer&#x27;s Mortal Kombat 1 review.

Final Fantasy VII Rebirth has quite the act to follow up – it must both live up to the sky-high expectations set by its predecessor, Final Fantasy VII Remake, and synthesize and modernize perhaps the most crucial chapter in our heroes&#x27; adventure across Gaia. While my 80 hours in Rebirth didn&#x27;t quite match the overall nirvana of Remake, it&#x27;s a game I struggled to put down. A few stumbling blocks, like a bloated and sometimes tedious open world and intermittently uneven pacing, threaten the highs of Rebirth. But an exciting and well-told story, with an a…</span>

Ochrana soukromí a umělá inteligence jsou podle Mozilly neoddělitelně spjaty. Závody ve zbrojení v oblasti umělé inteligence motivují společnosti k tomu, aby shromažďovaly co nejvíce dat pro získání konkurenční výhody, aniž by braly ohled na soukromí lidí. Abychom měli důvěryhodnou umělou inteligenci, musíme o soukromí přemýšlet z globální perspektivy. Data neznají hranice, vysvětluje Mozilla svou motivaci.</span>

Saying that X thing is the future is de rigueur for technology marketing. It&#x27;s something you hear repeatedly from videogames companies in particular, with their sequels and console generations and other chronological fixtures that form an endless staircase towards The New.

Actually stay sitting down, because it&#x27;s time to watch and think about the first trailer for Elden Ring: Shadow Of The Erdtree, which confirms that the Elden Ring DLC expansion will focus on Miquella, a rather tragic demigod character from the main game. Find the full video again below, together with my thoughts on just what the heck it all means.

                              <span>Last Epoch is, as has been observed many times, a kind of middle-ground ARPG. You hold down a button to evaporate hordes of enemies from a top down isometric perspective, but, in a step further than Diablo 4, it has more in-depth, any-time crafting for entry level percentage perverts to eke out incremental slivers of health regen vs. damage. At the same time, it&#x27;s less complex than Path Of Exile, which is where advanced percentage perverts go when they die. Last Epoch has been in early access for a while now, so there&#x27;s a decent chance that you already know what you think of it now it&#x27;s in 1.0. If you haven&#x27;t yet dipped your toe in, then I can tell you it&#x27;s very decent. It makes building an extremely overpowered mega-wizard very easy, and I liked it better than Diablo IV, I think.

Not just to foster some good old fashioned discussion among your good selves in the comments, but also as a way for those who aren&#x27;t able to join us for the end-of-month liveblog session to still take part in what everyone has to say about it. We&#x27;ll also try and stuff as many of your thoughts and observations into the liveblog discussion proper, too, to try and make it feel as communal as possible (and not just us waffling on about it for a full hour).  
So, folks, tell us what you think about the excellent Cobalt Core below. What you like, dislike, your favourite moments (or your most hated moments)... Anything goes.

                              <span>Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water, Microsoft are bringing Maneater back to Game Pass. Yesterday they unveiled the next batches of Game Pass additions and two are returnees, with the delightful fighty platformer Indivisible accompanying brutal shark &#x27;em up Maneater. What&#x27;s more important is that it&#x27;s adding the game with the cutest little Nurglings, grimdark retro-styled FPS Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun. The rhetoric of &#x27;purging xenos and heretics&#x27; surely doesn&#x27;t apply to these darling babies. Read on for all the games coming to (and going from) Game Pass over the next few weeks.

                              <span>Kemuri was first revealed at The Game Awards last December, a co-op parkour action game where you fight yokai and look cool from the creative and art director for Ghostwire: Tokyo, Ikumi Nakamura. The team at Unseen have done a seven minute video where talk a little bit about the content and vibes of the game, basically by just listing cool stuff. Think of something cool, and it&#x27;s probably in Kemuri somehow. The video both excited and frustrated me, as it seems like an exciting game, but I very much feel the video does not answer the question posed by its own title.

                              <span>Before founding Inflexion in 2021, Aaryn Flynn worked at BioWare. He&#x27;s got credits on some of the studio&#x27;s best-loved games, from Baldur&#x27;s Gate 2 through Star Wars: Knights Of The Old Republic to Dragon Age: Origins and the Mass Effect trilogy. He was BioWare&#x27;s general manager for several years, but left the company in 2017 following the release of the less-regarded Mass Effect: Andromeda. New survival sim Nightingale is his first early access project, and it&#x27;s certainly been a learning experience, with Flynn obliged to rethink many of the things he learned about gamedev during his BioWare days. Speaking to me ahead of Nightingale&#x27;s launch, Flynn talked about the difficulty of making headway as a new developer in an industry where the most successful competing live service titles have effectively become part of the landscape - indeed, a force of &quot;gravity&quot;.

I for one, hope the trailer includes a hint of gameplay and not just like, a long cinematic with some croaky fella explaining how there&#x27;s been another &quot;downfall&quot; or similar.

                              <span>Last night I tried to host a Helldivers 2 co-op mission and the &quot;ready up&quot; button froze up. I spammed it in a panic while the randos in my voice channel fumed at the delay. Then I popped us out of the drop pods, attempted to quit the game in embarrassment, and the PC promptly crashed. Another blow for managed democracy! 


I&#x27;m hoping that the ready up problem is one of the &quot;various UI issues [that] may appear when the game interacts with servers&quot; which Arrowhead are addressing in a future Helldivers 2 patch. Before that, there&#x27;s patch 1.000.10, which fixes PC quickplay match-making bugs, gets rid of a crash issue when displaying mission rewards, and tunes civilian extraction mission difficulty, amongst other things. It&#x27;s live now, and the full changelog is below.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been a long time coming, but the first trailer for Borderlands has finally arrived after the first images of the movie emerged this week. First announced in 2015, the live-action film brings Gearbox’s popular co-op loot shooter to life with some big-name stars, bigger explosions, and (hopefully) even bigger laughs. 


Directed by Eli Roth, the film stars Cate Blanchett (Lilith), Kevin Hart (Roland), Jack Black (Claptrap), Edgar Ramírez (Atlas), Ariana Greenblatt (Tiny Tina), Florian Munteanu (Krieg), Gina Gershon (Moxxi), and Jamie Lee Curtis (Tannis). Like the games, the film follows our group of Vault Hunters as they search for a valuable relic on the desert planet of Pandora. They also stumble upon a missing girl with a powerful secret that could endanger the universe. 
Borderlands hits theaters on August 9.</span>

                              <span>Sea of Thieves is the last Xbox first-party game officially confirmed for a new platform. Rare’s shared-world sea-faring pirate game is heading to PlayStation 5 on April 30.
Sea of Thieves joins Hi-Fi Rush, Grounded, and Pentiment as the four Xbox titles going multiplatform, each confirmed today. The PlayStation 5 version supports crossplay with Xbox and PC. “Something we’ve always been passionate about is that idea that we should remove barriers that prevent players from playing together,” says game director Mike Chapman in an announcement video below. 


As associate design director Shelly Preston points out in the video, this marks the first time in Rare’s nearly 40-year history that it’s released a game on PlayStation, which is a wild milestone. Since first launching to a tepid reaction in 2018, various updates and expansions have improved Sea of Thieves and fostered a dedicated community of players. PlayStation 5 players have the benefit of jumping into a now-content-rich game from the get-go.</span>

Like a ship that has changed tack countless times and delayed its arrival at port, Skull and Bones has launched far later than expected and faced trouble along the way. Even so, this pirate adventure surprised me with the breadth of its world, the richness of its commerce simulation, and an approachable and rewarding naval combat system. As a living game built around seasonal content and a growing universe, it has a ways to go to be at its best, but the bones of a quality experience are here.

                              <span>Following today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase, many were surprised the heavily rumored Hi-Fi Rush was absent. However, shortly after that presentation, which confirmed Pentiment and Grounded are both arriving on Switch, we learned that the next of the four previous Xbox exclusives Phil Spencer said last week are coming to additional platforms. Hi-Fi Rush, a rhythm-action title from the studio behind The Evil Within and Ghostwire: Tokyo, is joining the PlayStation 5 library, as confirmed by Xbox Wire.
Hi-Fi Rush surprise launched on Xbox Series X/S and PC in January 2023, quickly becoming a critical darling and fan favorite. While many were shocked the colorful game was created by the horror developers at Tango Gameworks, fans quickly fell in love with the stylish combat, beautiful presentation, and fun integration of music.
Hi-Fi Rush arrives on PS5 on March 19. According to reporting by The Verge, the final previously exclusive game jumping across the aisle is Sea of Thieves. Hi-Fi Rush took home Game Informer&#x27;s 2023 &quot;Best Microsoft Exclusive&quot; award and, as of this writing, has a spot on our Top 10 Xbox Series X Games list.

                              <span>During today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase, we learned Grounded is coming to Switch this April, but that&#x27;s not the only Obsidian-developed title fans can expect. Blending the adventure genre with a gorgeous storybook aesthetic, Pentiment was a critical darling when it launched on Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC in 2022. Now, a new stable of players will have the chance to experience the title, as it is coming to Switch tomorrow.
Pentiment puts you in control of Andreas Maler, a 16th-century artist from Nuremberg who finds himself in the middle of several murder mysteries. Taking place over the course of 25 years, you must investigate the murders, collect physical proof, interview townsfolk, and accuse who you think committed the crime based on the evidence you gather. 
When it launched on Xbox in PC, Pentiment earned an 86 on reviews aggregate sites Metacritic and OpenCritic. Game Informer&#x27;s Charles Harte felt similarly, awarding it an 8.5 out of 10, saying Pentiment is &quot;a perfect example of this, telling a deep, complex story about religion, truth, and history in the form of a book, which the player experiences as it’s being written. Despite a few sections with inconsistent pacing, it’s a must-play for fans of adventure games.&quot;
Pentiment arrives on Nintendo Switch tomorrow, February 22. For more on the title, be sure to check out our review here. Pentiment joins Grounded as previous Xbox exclusives to come to Switch. According to Xbox&#x27;s Phil Spencer, there are four games in total that will arrive on additional platforms in the near future. The other two are reportedly Sea of Thieves and Hi-Fi Rush, but neither was featured on today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase.</span>

                              <span>After a long wait, we finally have details about Elden Ring&#x27;s upcoming DLC, Shadow of the Erdtree. Publisher Bandai Namco and developer From Software released the add-on&#x27;s first official trailer this morning which revealed it is launching June 21. Bandai Namco is also releasing a physical version of the game, the Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree Collector&#x27;s Edition, which includes a statue and other goodies.
You can check out the trailer below.


The trailer begins by focusing on a setting where an optional boss appeared in the main game and where you can find Miquella&#x27;s egg. The trailer shows new monsters and bosses, like a lion creature with a rotating head and another made entirely of flames. There are also new abilities, items, and weapons, one of which appears to be a roaring bear&#x27;s head. There is also some kind a porcupine alligator creature and the player character sprouted angel wings in one fight. Those are just a few of the standout reveals.

The game&#x27;s official product page does confirm a few additional details, like the name of the main boss seems to be Mesmer the Impaler. Shadow of the Erdtree is also not standalone despite carrying a $39.99 price tag. The page refers to it as an expansion and it will require the base game. Here&#x27;s the official description.
The Shadow of the Erdtree expansion features an all-new story set in the Land of Shadow imbued with mystery, perilous dungeons, and new enemies, weapons and equipment.
Discover uncharted territories, face formidable adversaries, and revel in the satisfying triumph of victory. Dive into the riveting interplay of characters, where drama and intrigue intertwine, that create an immersive experience to savor and enjoy.

Snake Rattle &#x27;N&#x27; Roll for NES
R.C. Pro-Am for NES
Battletoads in Battlemaniacs for SNES
Killer Instinct for SNES
Blast Corps for N64

                              <span>Following last week&#x27;s Xbox podcast, where Phil Spencer said that four previous Xbox exclusives would be coming to additional platforms in the near future, today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase revealed the first of the four. Grounded, a four-player survival game where players assume the roles of children shrunken down to the size of bugs, is coming to Switch this April.
Grounded originally launched on Xbox One and PC in Early Access in June 2020, where it stayed until September 2022. This is in line with Spencer&#x27;s comments that the Xbox games coming to other platforms will have been exclusive on Xbox for at least a year. The other rumored Xbox titles to come to other platforms are Tango Gameworks&#x27; Hi-Fi Rush, Rare&#x27;s Sea of Thieves, and another Obsidian game, Pentiment. 
Grounded arrives on Switch on April 16 with cross-platform co-op, but you can also take on the miniaturized backyard challenges solo. For more on Grounded, check out our coverage hub right here.</span>

                              <span>Titled Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed, the Wii platformer is getting ported and somewhat upgraded for Switch. The game is apparently a &quot;faithful&quot; port of the game as the trailer didn&#x27;t highlight much in terms of new content or upgrades. But the game does look undeniably sharper.
If you&#x27;re unfamilair, Epic Mickey for Wii was a Wii game where a classic, mischievous Mickey finds a magic brush that lets him manipulate the world. Its legacy, however, is it marked the return of Walt Disney&#x27;s original creation, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit&#x27;s return to Disney canon.
Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed arrives this year.</span>

                              <span>The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals has vacated the $1 billion piracy damages award against Internet provider Cox Communications. While the ISP remains contributorily liable for pirating subscribers, a finding of vicarious copyright infringement was reversed. A new trial will determine the appropriate damages amount given these new conclusions.

                              <span>At the time of writing, at least dozens but most likely hundreds of pirate sites are effectively down due to a domain issue at a single registrar. The problem seems to be isolated to sites using .TV domains registered at Sarek Oy in Finland, a registrar well known for its pirate-friendly policies. As things stand, hundreds of domains are completely devoid of DNS, resulting in one of the biggest mass blackouts in recent history.

Around half the celestial sphere is given over to the dominions of the Automatons and Terminids, leaving ample room for another enemy faction to be inserted via free update or paid DLC. What could that next faction be? Surely it can&#x27;t be any worse than a horde of giant bugs or a legion of robots. Surely it can&#x27;t be, say, a highly advanced elder species of teleporting illusionists equipped with lightning guns and cloaking devices. Oh dear.

                              <span>Playing Pacific Drive reminds me of an army recruitment advert shown on British TV about 20 years ago. A group of soldiers are travelling along a road at night in a Land Rover, when suddenly they spot the enemy ahead. The front seat passenger starts barking orders at the driver: “Get off the road! Kill the lights! Through the trees!”. You sense the panic as the camera, inside the vehicle, jolts with the suspension on the rough ground, and the driver fights the steering wheel to stay in control. It’s a scene you reenact quite frequently in Ironwood’s survival game with roguelike trimmings. Well, except, instead of a Land Rover you’re behind the wheel of a rusty station wagon, and instead of military opposition, you’re scarpering from paranormal phenomena.

                              <span>Inflexion&#x27;s fantasy survival sim Nightingale releases into Steam early access today. Our pre-launch impressions? Well, the procedurally generated landscapes are engrossing, a blend of British fairytale influences with many a hushed forest, spidery swamp and tempting ruin. We&#x27;re also pretty keen as a team on the game&#x27;s Realm cards system, which lets you shape those fairytale worlds both before and after you portal into them. But we were less enthralled by HUD and user interface elements such as the crafting menus and hotbar, which we found ornate and circuitous to the point of confusing. 


Speaking to me after our co-op hands-on - in which guides writer Kiera made friends with a tree monster only for somebody to shoot it - Inflexion&#x27;s CEO Aaryn Flynn explained a bit about how the game will evolve during its early access period, which Inflexion estimate will last 9-12 months. Thankfully, it sounds like fine-tuning the UI is a priority, though Flynn is &quot;cautious&quot; about committing to a full-blown roadmap.

                              <span>Every year, there are a couple of game soundtracks I become properly obsessed with. In 2022, I more or less had the music of Tunic and Citizen Sleeper on repeat whenever I left the house. In 2021, it was Chicory. In 2020, it was Coffee Talk and Signs Of The Sojourner, and in 2019, it was all Mutazione, all the time. 2023 was a pretty great year for game music as well, as we not only got Alan Wake 2&#x27;s exquisite musical set-piece that&#x27;s honestly just been getting better and more insane as time&#x27;s gone on, frankly, but also the toe-tappingly brilliant soundtrack of Cobalt Core, which has somehow risen even higher on my forever playlist after revisiting it for this month&#x27;s RPS Game Club.  
Composed by Aaron Cherof, Cobalt Core&#x27;s music alternates between high-energy battle tracks and calmer, more relaxed ambience. It&#x27;s so dang good, and an absolutely perfect backdrop for sliding in and out of oncoming missile fire in its roguelike spaceship fights. So come along and jam to some of its best tracks with me below as I pick out some of my musical highlights.

                              <span>A colossal new update for Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader launched last night, hitting the grimdark space-aristocrat RPG with so many changes that the patch notes are almost 17,000 words long. Fitting for a game that our Rogue Trader review called &quot;engrossing, obscure and absolutely exhausting&quot;. It adds loads of new voiced lines, fixes everything from wonky abilities to broken quests, reworks balance, improves performance, and so much more. Enough is changed that developers Owlcat are giving everyone in your party a free respec to adjust to what the game has become.

And to celebrate, there&#x27;s a colossal 1.0 update that could take you an hour to read in its entirety. To spare you the time commitment, its highlights include new Acolyte and Rogue masteries, new Item Factions, a full offline mode, controller support, and plenty of visual tweaks.

                              <span>The latest Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage update is giving me flashbacks to that inglorious period in game design when every other action game had an insta-fail stealth segment to wind people up between cover-based shoot-outs and, I don&#x27;t know, three-part glyph puzzles or what-have-you. Out today for PC at 12pm UTC, 1pm GMT, 7am ET and 4am PT, the 1.07 patch adds Full Synchronization Challenge, a permadeath mode (originally teased last year) that not only permakills you when you&#x27;re slain by enemies, but also deletes your save file when you commit crimes such as slaughtering civilians, or going outside of &quot;authorised map locations&quot;.

                              <span>My experience with Warhams isn&#x27;t flat zero - I had some minifigs when I was a teenager and played a few of the Dawn Of War video games - but I haven&#x27;t actively checked in on it for a while. I know enough to make &quot;[x] for the [x] throne!&quot; jokes, basically. My experience with cleaning-stuff-sim PowerWash Simulator is extensive, though, and I was excited when the crossover with Warhammer 40K was teased a while back. Last night we got a full trailer and release date of Frebruary 27th - next week! - and I&#x27;m now earnestly very excited. The trailer is both very funny and shows off massive things to clean. Win win, innit.

What starts as a lovely evening visit to the Mushroom Kingdom’s Sparkle Theater turns into a hectic performance in Princess Peach: Showtime, in which Nintendo’s leading lady must help reclaim the playhouse from Grape and The Sour Bunch, a group of villains hellbent on stealing the spotlight. Peach must visit the theater’s many stages to assist the resident actors in getting the show back on track by transforming into special outfits to complete fun activities like cake decorating, ice skating, and sword fighting.

                              <span>Some may look at an early clip of Kingmakers and think they already know what to expect: tactical battles in which you command medieval armies across sweeping battlefields. And that’s partially true. But this new title by Redemption Road Games features an unexpected and absolutely absurd twist.
We’ll let the trailer speak for itself.


In Kingmakers, you control a soldier from a dying world in the future. To save your present, you must travel 500 years in the past to medieval England to change the course of a war to prevent a later apocalypse.
Since the protagonist evidently has no regard for blending in, he arrives fully strapped with modern weaponry such as assault rifles, shotguns, grenade launchers, armored vehicles, and even helicopters to blow these knights back to Camelot. You’ll command your own medieval army, with gameplay seamlessly switching between zoomed-out RTS-style view to issue commands to various units and more action-focused third-person shooting.  
Redemption Road Games states Kingmaker’s armies are fully simulated by a next-generation multithreaded A.I. This allows them to execute advanced pathfinding, decision-making, and even a loyalty system, with a procedurally generated animation system helping bring the mobs to life. Kingmakers also feature co-op with up to three other players. Each ally commands their own army to work together to topple enemy fortresses or defend friendly strongholds. 
Redemption Road Games states in an X post that it has been working on Kingmakers for the last five years. It looks wild and is certainly a refreshing concept. Hopefully, it’s as fun as it looks, and we&#x27;ll find out when it launches to PC via Steam sometime this year.</span>

                              <span>We&#x27;ve reached a point as a society where it feels like it&#x27;s only a matter of time before your favorite celebrity gets added to Fortnite. When I see Patrick Mahomes, Lewis Hamilton, and Eminem all dueling it out in Battle Royale mode, I have to wonder – who is even left to add? Today, we got an answer: Lady Gaga, who will be coming to the game in some kind of collaboration this Thursday, February 22. Notably, the image released specifically says &quot;Fortnite Festival,&quot; implying the crossover might be linked to the game&#x27;s musical mode, likely in the form of instrument skins and songs.
The funniest part about this announcement is the manner in which it was announced. In 2019, Lady Gaga tweeted, &quot;what is fortnight,&quot; either misspelling the popular video game or talking about something else entirely. Now, over four years later, she&#x27;s corrected that spelling mistake with an asterisk while simultaneously announcing her appearance in the game.

Fortnite is the biggest game in the world, and it&#x27;s getting even bigger in the future, thanks to a 1.5 billion-dollar investment from Disney. To learn more about its musical mode specifically, check out our interview with the head of Harmonix, the team behind Fortnite Festival.</span>

                              <span>Developer Abstraction Games aims to resurrect Gigantic, the 5v5 MOBA-hero-shooter hybrid that went offline in 2018 – only a year after its full release. I recently played the upcoming revival, called Gigantic: Rampage Edition, and wished my session didn’t have to end. As an ardent fan of the original, jumping back into Gigantic is invigorating. Explosive fights erupt across the map’s many paths and objectives as each team races to expose and defeat the opposing squad’s Guardian with stylish spells and ultimate abilities. Notably, Gearbox Publishing is leaving the original’s free-to-play structure in the rearview, ditching microtransactions altogether for a $19.99 premium version featuring two new heroes, additional maps, console and PC cross-play, and updated gameplay systems.

Notably, Game Informer&#x27;s original Gigantic review wasn&#x27;t as positive as I personally felt about the game. Did you play the original version? If so, what was your opinion? Do you think Gearbox can successfully find an audience this time around?</span>

                              <span>We&#x27;re in a bit of a live-action video game adaptation golden age right now. Not every project is a hit, but there have been enough success stories that learning about a new film or TV show in the works doesn&#x27;t instantly fill fans with dread. The latest example of that growing trend is the live-action Borderlands movie, which we just got our first official looks at, thanks to People.
This image shows the main line-up of the movie. Going clockwise, starting from the top left, Ariana Greenblatt is Tiny Tina, Florian Munteanu is Krieg, Jamie Lee Curtis is Tannis, Jack Black is the voice of Claptrap, Kevin Hart is Roland, and Cate Blanchett takes the lead role as Lilith. You can see a head-on image of her character below.
This film has been in the works for a while now, but outside of these images, there&#x27;s not much new information. If you haven&#x27;t seen it yet (or just need a refresher, since it&#x27;s been over two years), here&#x27;s the official synopsis from a 2021 press release:
IGN also shared the movie&#x27;s first official poster.
Here&#x27;s the exclusive new poster for the @BorderlandsFilm!

As for what to expect, no details were shared but if it&#x27;s like previous Pokémon Day celebration showcases, it could be an exciting day for trainers. 
This news was revealed today on the official Pokémon X (formerly Twitter) account with a quick video showing a 3D Pikachu rushing onto the screen to pose in front of the Pokémon Presents logo while a retro rendition of a classic song plays. Now, instincts might tell you to read into this model and song but experience learned from previous announcements says it&#x27;s not a tease – The Pokémon Company always does this kind of stuff and there&#x27;s almost no…</span>

While those details are unusual, the bigger picture is quite extraordinary. Four people arrested on suspicion of running the site include the suspected ringleader, a  professional racing driver in his late thirties. Events show how an arrest in January triggered a domino effect leading right to his door.

                              <span>Several film companies are continuing efforts to obtain piracy-related information in connection with Reddit users. While Reddit declined to comply with recent subpoenas for subscriber information, it handed over the personal details of one user last year. A new court filing sheds some light on the type of evidence being sought by the filmmakers, which includes BitTorrent activity and pirate site visits.

                              <span>Nintendo will air a Partner Showcase of its Direct videos this week on Wednesday, February 21. Unlike a traditional Direct, Partner Showcases are presentations that highlight upcoming third-party games for Switch.
The Direct will air at 6 a.m. Pacific/9 a.m. Eastern on YouTube and will run for 25 minutes. Nintendo states in a press release that it will showcase “Nintendo Switch games coming in the first half of 2024 from our publishing and development partners.”
Ignoring the faint voice in my head whispering, “Hollow Knight: Silksong”, these are some noteworthy games with actual confirmed release dates within that window that could appear:
Inkulinati
Unicorn Overlord
Gylt
Highwater
South Park: Snow Day!
Open Roads
Botany Manor
Tales of Kenzera: Zau
SaGa Emerald Beyond
Braid: Anniversary Collection
Numerous third-party games slated for 2024 lack release dates, so there’s always a chance some of those could get launch windows or new trailers, at least. Some big ones include Contra: Operation Galuga, Decapolice, the long-awaited Switch port of Kingdom Come: Deliverance, Little Nightmares III, Neva, Pepper Grinder, Star Wars: Hunters, Shantae Advance: Risky Revolution, and The Plucky Squire.
Or we could also find out which of those four mysterious first-party Xbox games now going multiplatform is heading to Switch. Just a thought. 
Of course, there’s likely to be at least a few brand-new game announcements. Hopefully, it will be a fruitful Direct, and we luckily don’t have too much longer to wait and find out. What do you hope to see in the Partner Direct? Let us know in the comments!</span>

                              <span>Warframe is making the jump to mobile devices, namely iOS, tomorrow, February 20. Now, fans of the popular sci-fi action MMO can continue playing anywhere.
The iOS version features 10 years&#x27; worth of content and supports cross-play and cross-progression, meaning players can bring their characters anywhere they go. Additionally, players who log in between February 20 and 27 receive a free day 1 award, including 3 Day Affinity Booster and Bombyx Syandana. Warframe is compatible with iPhones and iPads with the A12 bionic chip or later (12th generation iPhones/8th generation iPads and up). 


An Android version is also planned, but its release is currently unknown. You can, however, pre-register for that version on Warframe’s website. 
Will you be playing Warframe on iOS? Let us know in the comments! Be sure also to check out developer Digital Extreme’s upcoming fantasy game, Soulframe.</span>

Nearly 10 years on from 2015&#x27;s Helldivers, Helldivers 2 carefully adapts the simple yet exciting formula of bug-blasting with buddies for a modern audience. Arrowhead Game Studios has swapped the top-down perspective for third-person while maintaining the frenetic, ballistic loop of crash-landing on hostile planets, completing difficult missions, and extracting against all odds.

The question has been asked in the past, but it was most recently brought up at a panel at FanExpo Vancouver 2024, according to The Direct.
The question was posed to Cameron Monaghan, known for his roles on Gotham and Shameless as well as his starring role as Cal Kestis in the Star Wars Jedi series. For Monaghan, it&#x27;s not a question of whether he&#x27;s willing to reprise his role as the character, but a question of the circumstances in which that character would appear.

                              <span>It’s been eight years since Street Fighter V hit PC. As you might recall, the fighting game landed with the poise of someone shattering both kneecaps on impact, as complaints about a small roster of characters and barebones story mode - to be filled in later with DLC - were made more egregious by a number of technical issues, including bugs and online issues caused by its wobbly servers.

                              <span>There&#x27;s a particular boss encounter in Balatro that always feels like it&#x27;s cheating a bit. In this mesmerising poker roguelike, each stage is made up of three blinds - small, big and boss - with the blind essentially being a high score you have to hit by playing different kinds of poker hands - your traditional flushes, straights, pairs and so on. Each hand has its own number of chips and multiplier bonuses associated with it, and Balatro&#x27;s whole deal is about shuffling closer to victory by making the most of the cards you&#x27;re dealt. While some blinds are tiny, stretching to just 300 or 450 early on in a run, they quickly start ramping up into the tens of thousands as each successfully defeated boss blind ups the ante and the accompanying stakes. Reach an ante of eight, and bingo, you&#x27;ve won a run of Balatro.
The boss blind I keep coming a cropper with, though, is The Flint. This sucker not only halves a hand&#x27;s chip score, but it also cuts its multiplier in two as well, and I&#x27;ve yet to figure out exactly how to defeat it. Sometimes it appears with a blind of just 600, but other times it&#x27;s been an enormous 22,000. In fairness, all bosses have little tricks like this. Some will debuff certain card suites, making them useless in your overall score count. Others may only let you play one hand type the entire match, while the cheeky Tooth will deduct you $1 for every card used. But Balatro isn&#x27;t simply about beating the odds with smart and intelligent card plays. It&#x27;s about bending, twisting and abusing those odds to your will - also through smart and intelligent card plays. Cheating isn&#x27;t just encouraged in Balatro. It&#x27;s damn near mandatory, and it&#x27;s all thanks to the brilliantly conceived joker cards that give the game its Latin-based name.

                              <span>As time-travelling fantasy APRG Last Epoch gears up for its 1.0 release this week, developers Eleventh Hour Games have revealed the final crop of character classes that will be arriving in the game on February 21st. Technically, they&#x27;re the final pair of the 15 mastery classes that you&#x27;ll be able to unlock after working through one of Last Epoch&#x27;s five base classes, but listen, I don&#x27;t even need to look at the other 14 masteries to know what I&#x27;m going to be aiming for come release. The Falconer specialisation of Last Epoch&#x27;s Rogue class just sounds too good to pass up.

The patch adds a new Hidden Dwarf Double IPA bevvy to the space rig hub&#x27;s bar, and duly necking it will initiate a prop hunt minigame among your squad of dwarven miners.

                              <span>Helldivers 2 is turning out to be an absolute laugh riot of a co-op shooter; it may even have the potential to rival Deep Rock Galactic on good vibes and teammate deaths as accidental comedy masterstrokes. Even ongoing server connectivity issues haven’t done much to spoil the sense of fun, which incidentally, can also be shared on the Steam Deck.
Indeed, following a quick Proton update on Valve’s part, its previously SteamOS-incompatible anti-cheat will no longer put the kibosh on you dropping into Helldivers 2 via your Deck. I’ve been testing on both an original 512GB model and the newer Steam Deck OLED, and as long as you don’t mind dropping the quality settings, it can usually run tidily above 30fps.

It not only poked fun at the reverential distance enforced on us by stuffy old art galleries, but it also invited us to recreate abstract modern masterworks by clicking, tracing and generally getting up close and personal with them with our big, colourful in-game fingers. Now, solo developer Thomas Waterzooi is back with Please, Touch The Artwork 2, which takes us on a slightly different journey through the art world as a hidden object point and click game. It&#x27;s out today, is completely free, and was made to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the death of the Belgian expressionist and surrealist painter James Ensor.

The content of this mod, you ask? It adds a companion who looks like redoubtable nu-metal pioneer Fred Durst.

                              <span>Among the things I like bestest about Inflexion&#x27;s alt-Victorian fantasy survival game Nightingale is its Realm cards mechanic, whereby you generate and modify worlds by playing Major and Minor cards. Major cards are used at portals to conjure up a particular biome or world type and set the difficulty, including an approximate choice of resident NPC factions, local fauna and resources. Minor cards are played within worlds to mess with their workings. You can lower the gravity for optimal umbrella gliding conditions, alter the weather or summon a Blood Moon (sorry, Zelda) that reduces your max health.

                              <span>Another week of PC game releases is upon us and oh heck, slow down. There are an alarming number of games out this week that I want to play, from large-scale 3D productions to itty-bitty time-killers, each sinisterly appropriate to my Steam stats and wider research interests. Are videogame publishers and The Maw in cahoots to overwhelm me with impulse-buys and sabotage my attempts to Report the News? It’s possible. It’s possible. The Maw can be pretty cunning for an indiscriminate force of cosmic famine. The creature has been known to forge alliances with misguided mortals, seeking to flank and overwhelm harried news writers. How else to explain Phil Spencer’s T-shirts?

                              <span>Riot Forge’s last stab  at publishing smaller spin-offs from indie teams has resulted in Bandle Tale: A League Of Legends Story, which at first glance has all the things I love in self-proclaimed cosy games: gorgeous pixel art, laidback objectives and characters cute enough to trigger primal cheek-squishing instincts. But despite looking like an SNES classic and playing like a mix between Animal Crossing and Stardew Valley, Bandle Tale unfortunately ties itself in knots with overly grindy crafting that had me rubbing my temples in an effort not to combust.

Today you can find the 12600K for £167 at Amazon UK as a US import, versus £221 for the same CPU via Amazon UK itself. That £167 price includes an import fee deposit and shipping too!

A complaint filed at a California court claims the defendant believed he had enough time and space to dodge a cease-and-desist. Ultimately, the stars failed to align, rendering an inevitable copyright infringement lawsuit impossible to predict.

                              <span>BitTorrent is often characterized as a decentralized file-sharing technology. However, its reliance on centralized indexes runs contrary to this idea. Over the years, several &#x27;indestructible&#x27; alternatives have been proposed, including the relatively new Bitmagnet software. With Bitmagnet, people can run their own private BitTorrent index, relying on DHT and the BEP51 protocol.

Thanks to the reports made by many of you, we have already solved many of the issues. But there might still be a few issues lurking around in this release candidate. Please share your findings on our issue tracker. Thanks to our translators, about half of the translations are (nearly) up-to-date. For the other half, we might need your help with translating. If your language is missing or has more than a few dozen missing strings, please consider helping to finish your translation. Download Changelog Bug tracker</span>

It&#x27;s less good news for those players struggling to play at all due to login issues and server issues. 

Rocksteady say addressing these is their top priority, although they ask for patience as the problems are &quot;not an easy nut to crack.&quot;

                              <span>Jump King is a simple, brutal, bastard of a platformer in which you attempt to steer a king towards the top of a single tower using his chargeable jump. Misjudge a particular jump by over- or undercharging it, maybe bounce back off a wall, and you may find yourself tumbling all the way back to the beginning again.

It&#x27;s probably about to get a bunch of even harder levels, however, because nearly five years after release it has just got Steam Workshop support and a new set of modding tools.

                              <span>I have an extremely annoying neck and shoulder ache that I can&#x27;t get rid of, but on the other hand I found the backing to the right earring in my all-day black studs. On a third hand, I found this after I bought a replacement pair. Less ideal. But at least video games have never let me down. That&#x27;s an egregious lie, though. Games let me down all the time. Which ones are you pinning your hopes to this weekend? Here are ours.

                              <span>Skull and Bones is finally out today. Let&#x27;s play the opening hour and see if it is worth wait. Reportedly, the game began development as early as 2013 and spent a few years as an Assassin&#x27;s Creed IV: Black Flag spinoff before turning into Black Flag MMO, before finally emerging as a standalone game announcement in 2017. In the six years since its announcement we&#x27;ve seen teases of it here and there, had chances to play in various betas and alphas, and it even appeared on our cover in 2022. Skull and Bones has been a long time coming, but today everyone is finally able to play it. Our full review isn&#x27;t ready quite yet, but you can  read Matt Miller&#x27;s positive early impressions so far by heading here. You can also check out an hour of gameplay below.

                              <span>How do you update a 30-year old pixel font to make it more suitable for today? The pixel-art OpenTTD fonts are iconic, but were designed for 640x480 CRT monitors rather than today’s 4k monsters. Without the horizontal smoothing of CRT scanlines, modern pixel-perfect rendering and 2x or 4x upscaling of the old bitmap/sprite-based fonts makes the text jagged and hard to read.</span>

                              <span>The launch of 1997’s Final Fantasy VII on Playstation signaled a seismic shift in the video game landscape. The transition from pixel art to fully animated computer graphics was a massive enough leap ahead, but the beauty of this classic title was much more than skin deep. Featuring a stellar cast of beloved characters, a rock-solid combat system, and a story with the potential to instill emotions ranging from awe and joy to grief and anger, the legacy of Final Fantasy VII is well-established in the RPG genre and the games industry as a whole. Read more...</span>

It’s unclear what form those projects are taking, but according to one report, one of them may star a Mandalorian.
Insider Gaming reports that its sources have disclosed that Respawn is developing a first-person title in which players assume the mantle of a Mandalorian. For clarification, players do not play as the Mandalorian, as in Din Djarin from the hit Disney Plus series, but rather as a different bounty hunter. The game is reportedly set during the height of the Galactic Empire and will see players capturing or killing bounty targets.
Additionally, Insider Gaming’s sources claim the game is not an open-world title. Inst…</span>

                              <span>As an outgrowth of the naval combat experiences in the Assassin&#x27;s Creed series, I&#x27;ve been curious about Skull and Bones since its announcement as a standalone title in 2017. Since then, the game has seen numerous delays and fundamental reworks on the development side. Our cover story on the game captured one moment in the evolving project’s life in the summer of 2022, and it has continued to change in the months that followed. In recent weeks, some sentiments on the internet and in gaming communities have concluded that, by this point, the game that is releasing must be a mess.

                              <span>The 27th annual D.I.C.E. Awards took place yesterday.

The publishers have announced that they have cancelled “at least” five games in the works to help overcome a significant drop in income over the last year, adopting a new approach to development that will focus on quality.

                              <span>I promise I&#x27;m not trying to turn RPS into a Soggins the Frog fansite, but... If you have a) been enjoying Cobalt Core as part of RPS Game Club this month, and b) especially like it when Soggins turns up with his ship of malfunctioning missile launchers, then I implore you to make Sunshine Heavy Industries your next port of call in your Steam library. It&#x27;s what the Cobalt Core devs Rocket Rat Games made first, and you can immediately see a lot of shared DNA between the two games - not least its chunky, charming pixel visuals and some crossover between its cast of characters - including our pal Soggins. 
It is, I should stress, a very different game to Cobalt Core - it&#x27;s a sandboxy spaceship builder with zero combat involved, for starters - but I&#x27;ve been playing it again this week ahead of some other Game Club-themed articles I&#x27;ve got cooking, and I&#x27;ve been having a lovely time with it. Not least because I get to spend more time with Soggins the very smug frog, all while listening to even more excellent chill tunes from Cobalt Core composer Aaron Cherof.

                              <span>Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3&#x27;s latest update has, as per most of their updates, a colossal number of improvements. Notably, there are new animations for folks who hunker down in your camp and a speedier way to dismiss unwanted companions.

Wavve Americas, a coalition of Korean broadcasters, filed a complaint against Kokoa TV in 2023, alleging trademark infringement, cybersquatting, copyright infringement, and other business-related violations.

                              <span>As promised earlier this week, Microsoft and Xbox executives Phil Spencer (head of Xbox), Sarah Bond (president, Xbox) and Matt Booty (Head of Xbox Game Studios) got together today to share some important &quot;updates on the Xbox business.&quot; You can check out the full update below, but the headline is that four future formerly Xbox and PC exclusive games are coming to other consoles, but Spencer was not ready to reveal what those games are. They are games that are more than a year old that have been on Xbox and PC for awhile. A couple of the games, Spencer says, are community-driven and service-based games that have reached their full potential on Xbox and PC. They are franchises that Xbox wants to continue to invest in. Two are smaller games that were not built to be platform exclusives. Though he wasn&#x27;t ready to share the game titles, he did confirm that Starfield and Indiana Jones are not in that group.
According to sources reported by The Verge, it seems the four titles may be Hi-Fi Rush, Pentiment, Sea of Thieves, and Grounded.
Spencer cushioned everything he said, presumably in expectation of pushback from Xbox fans by saying, “We make every decision with the long term health of Xbox in mind.” He also made sure to remind everyone that Xbox already has games on other platforms, calling out Minecraft in particular. Spencer also briefly touched on the company&#x27;s decision to lay off over 1900 employees, though offered little in terms of reasonable rationalization.
Bond also mentioned that Xbox is looking forward to and making plans surrounding future hardware and vaguely promised a substantial leap in technical prowess, but offered little in terms of concrete details.


The podcast also confirmed Activision/Blizzard games are coming to Game Pass starting with Diablo IV on March 28 and that we can expect a new Xbox showcase in June.</span>

                              <span>It’s been three years since EA announced it was making a new college football game after a years-long hiatus. Dubbed EA Sports College Football 25, not much has materialized about the game since its reveal in the way of updates, but the publisher has broken its silence with a new trailer confirming a release window and promising a bigger look at the title in the near future.
The video heavily leans into the skepticism fans have expressed over College Football’s existence, proudly expressing, “Yes, the game is real” while showing off snippets of behind-the-scenes development footage. The snazzy video doesn’t do much besides that, but it ends with a promise of a full reveal in May and a summer launch window. 


EA Sports College Football 25 is being developed by EA Orlando (formerly known as Tiburon), the team behind the Madden games. This will be the first college football game from the publisher since the demise of its NCAA Football series, the last entry of which was released in 2013. The franchise was shelved due to a 2014 federal lawsuit in which the judge ruled that the NCAA’s long-standing rule prohibiting college athletes from being compensated for their in-game likenesses was unlawful. 
With Name, Image, Likeness (NIL) rules now in place in college sports, players can now be paid for appearing in advertisements or products. That would, of course, include video games. EA Sports struck a deal with OneTeam Partners to broker deals with players to include their NIL in the upcoming game. However, this was met with resistance from school/player licensing agency The Brandr Group last summer, which filed a lawsuit to prevent EA from conducting such deals with OneTeam Partners. Both entities eventually agreed to a settlement in November, dropping the lawsuit (thanks College Football HQ). 
We don’t know what platforms EA Sports College Football 25 will target, but that answer should hopefully come in May’s larger update.</span>

                              <span>A new trailer for Princess Peach: Showtime shows off some more outfits and abilities the Mushroom Kingdom’s pink monarch has up her royal sleeve. 
Princess Peach: Showtime pits Peach against the villainous Sour Bunch, who crashes a performance at the Sparkle Theater. Its guardian, Stella, grants Peach the ability to transform and gain powers based on the costumes she dons. Stages take the form of different theater plays with ever-changing sets. 
The video introduces Figure Skater Peach, which sees her gracefully skating across a winter-themed stage and performing spins to take out enemies. The Dashing Thief costume gives Peach a Carmen Sandiego-esque look and vibe as she uses a retractable grappling hook to zipline and swing across 2D levels while evading security bots. Mermaid Peach grants a siren-like singing voice used in what appears to be a type of musical mini-game. Mighty Peach basically turns the Princess into a Super Sentai-like hero battling aliens using super strength and a jetpack to take out foes mid-air.


Princess Peach: Showtime is coming to Switch on March 22. Nintendo is also launching pink rose-colored Joy-Cons for the occasion.</span>

A claim that cloud services provider Cloud4C has been rendered inaccessible appears to be credible.

Access real devices with Device Streaming in Android Studio

Device streaming in Android Studio lets you securely connect to remote physical Android devices hosted in Google&#x27;s secure data centers. Powered by Firebase, it&#x27;s the fastest and easiest way to test your app against real devices, including the Google Pixel 8 Pro, Pixel Fold, select Samsung devices, and more.

After connecting to a device, you can deploy your app, view the display, interact with the device (including rotating or unfolding the device), and anything else you might do with a device over a direct ADB over SSL connection—all without leaving Android Studio. When you&#x27;re done using the device, Google wipes all your data and factory resets the device before making it available to another developer.
During Open Alpha, you can use Device Streaming at no cost. To get started simply sign into your Developer account from Android Studio and select a Firebase project. If you don&#x27;t already have a Firebase project, it&#x27;s easy to create one. To learn more, go to Device Streaming in Android Studio.

                              <span>Well, third time’s the charm, or so they say. So let’s try this again, shall we? With beta 3, we’ve restored the cargo types that went missing in the sub-artic and tropical climates. We’ve also included fixes for various other issues which are listed in the full changelog linked below. Thanks to the reports made by many of you, we could solve the issues quickly. But never fear if you’ve missed out so far, there are still a lot of treasures to hunt for in this beta. Please share your findings on our issue tracker. And watch this space as we’ll soon start with our feature posts about the new things coming with OpenTTD 14. In the first installment, you’ll learn why buses don’t always come when they should and what you can do about it. Download Changelog Bug tracker</span>

                              <span>OpenTTD turns 20 this year, and to celebrate we are preparing for one of our largest ever releases. It’s packed with 40 new features, 80 changes, and almost 150 fixes. In the upcoming weeks we will share more posts explaining some of these features in depth. For now, we need your help testing our work. We need as many people as possible to test this beta version of the 14.X release series, so you can find and we can squash as many bugs as possible before the actual release. To guide you a bit towards what you should be looking for: Generic gameplay bugs and crashes. There is a new Ship Pathfinder; test it out. Buoys are optional to use. You can now automatically unbunch your vehicles at a depot. We added our own interpretation of daylength to the game. More on this soon in another blog post. There are many GUI improvements throughout the game. More consistent look, better GUI scaling. There are many more things worth talking about, and this will be made more clear when we approach the release of 14.0. But for now, play the game, and please report any issues you find. The usual titlegame competition has also been announced on the forums. See the page for the exact competition rules if you are interested. Download Changelog Bug tracker</span>
