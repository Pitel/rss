                              <span>The spring of 2023, specifically
So now that Pokemon Scarlet and Violet are in full swing, people are going to want to transfer all of their old characters in. Well, you&#x27;ll have to hold off on that! That functionality isn&#x27;t coming until roughly mid-2023.
Here&#x27;s the full confirmation of when Scarlet and Violet are getting Home support
So over on the game&#x27;s official site, The Pokemon Company says that support will be coming &quot;in spring 2023.&quot; It&#x27;s important to remember that this will only include &quot;select Pokemon from past games&quot; as well. Here&#x27;s the disclaimer: &quot;Note: The Pokemon you’ll be able transfer to each game via Pokemon HOME are limited to Pokemon that can appear in those games. Please look out for more information about which Pokemon will be available in Pokemon Scarlet and Pokemon Violet.&quot;
Before then, there is something coming sooner. That same post explains that in &quot;early 2023,&quot; the pair of games are getting &quot;Battle Stadium statistics&quot; support: &quot;From the app, you’ll be able to view information about Trainer rankings, frequently used Pokémon, Online Competitions, and more. You’ll also be able to see what moves, Abilities, and held items are being used in battles the most.&quot;
It&#x27;s unfortunate that the rollout is so far away, but it also allows for some time for the current generation to marinate and sink in, without tons of different metas emerging. Its also plenty of leeway to get a full living Pokedex in Scarlet and Violet.

Yuji Naka, the co-creator of Sonic the Hedgehog franchise, has reportedly been arrested in Japan as part of an investigation into an insider trading scheme at Square Enix. According to Japanese news site FNN Prime Online, Naka is one of a handful of individuals singled out by the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors’ Office Investigation Department.
Yesterday, Japanese officials detained two Square Enix employees, named as Taisuke Sazaki and Fumiaki Suzuki, for allegedly purchasing major stock shares in studio Aiming, right before the announcement of mobile title Dragon Quest: Tact. It is reported by FNN Prime that Sazaki and Fumiaki acquired around ¥47 million (roughly $336,300 USD) of shares in lieu of the announcement of the game&#x27;s develo…</span>

                              <span>Let the anime OVA take you away
Armello studio League of Geeks announced another new project today, this time turning to the stars for inspiration. Jumplight Odyssey is a new spaceship management sim, set to hit PC sometime in 2023.
Revealed during today&#x27;s PC Gaming Show 2023 Preview, the trailer has a vibe that will undoubtedly make some viewers nostalgic. As Princess Euphora watches the evil general annihilate the fleet, the crew jets off into space, seeking salvation at the Forever Star with a plucky crew, hanging by a thread.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;mitPu7bcDB8
If you&#x27;re reminded of the days of &#x27;70s anime, that&#x27;s not an accident. League of Geeks specifically cites Star Blazers, the animated adaptation of anime series Space Battleship Yamato, as an inspiration. And according to the Steam page, there may be some smooth &#x27;70s Tokyo disco in the mix, too.
Fly me to the moon
While the trailer gives a good look at the style, inspiration, and setting for this adventure, the Steam page holds some more info on the actual gameplay of this &quot;FTL-meets-Star Blazers&quot; hybrid.
As the captain escaping the warmongering Zutopans, you&#x27;ll have to keep the starship running while making your way to the Forever Star. This means managing needs, repairing damage, and keeping an eye on those aboard the ship.

Crewmates can act out a sort of &quot;floating melodrama&quot; thanks to their moods, allowing relationships and incidents to arise. Keep Hope alive, literally, and it&#x27;ll keep your boat afloat.
Different biomes and hazards, emergent disasters, and hostile ships all act to keep you from your goal. But this seems like a cool mix of spaceship sim and management, with an infectious nostalgia for the classics. Alongside League of Geeks&#x27; other project, a remake of Solium Infernum, the team is putting together some great-looking throwbacks. Here&#x27;s hoping they both stick the landing next year.

It&#x27;s that time of year again -- the Game Awards nominations are finally out. As expected, the year&#x27;s biggest AAA titles like God of War Ragnarok, Elden Ring, and Horizon Forbidden West dominate in a lot of the major categories, and while it&#x27;s not controversial to assume that one of those is going to take home the grand prize of Game of the Year, it&#x27;s the Best Narrative nominations that are stirring up the Discourse this time around.
The full list of Best Narrative nominees includes Ragnarok, Elden Ring, Forbidden West, A Plague Tale: Requiem, and Immortality. It&#x27;s a reasonable-yet-predictable list, but regardless, fans are up in arms about Elden Ring and God of War in particular. There are a lot of different takes going on here, so I&#x27;ll…</span>

Pentiment is out this week for PC and Xbox, and it sounds like that might not have happened if not for Xbox Game Pass. In a new interview with Waypoint, director Josh Sawyer says he wouldn&#x27;t have proposed the project without Game Pass as a factor.
&quot;I never would have proposed making Pentiment without Game Pass,&quot; said Sawyer. &quot;Like, I literally just wouldn&#x27;t have done it. I just don&#x27;t think it would have been possible.&quot;
Host Rob Zacny follows up, asking whether that was because it would have been shot down or akin to sending developers on a sure-to-fail mission. Sawyer elaborates, mentioning the &quot;old mentality&quot; of focusing on larger teams and larger investment for a higher ROI (return on investment). He says that&#x27;s not really the point, in this environment or ec…</span>

Last week saw the surprise announcement of Chill Season 2022, the newest update inking its way onto Splatoon 3. Of all of the new details revealed to be coming to the game including new stages, weapons and items, one of the biggest features to catch our eye was the introduction of X Battles with the update on 1st December.
We first heard of this game mode in the Splatoon 3 Direct showcase back in August, where it was announced that X Battles would be a variation on Anarchy Battles only for the most elite players. Though details have been scarce ever since, it looks like Nintendo is starting to drip feed us some information on what this new mode will entail and who can get involved.

Note: This Cloud Version of Resident Evil 2 was tested on 100MB UW Broadband over WiFi and wired ethernet cable, along with a 5G mobile connection.

Capcom is marching on with its plan to release its modern Resident Evil titles as cloud versions on Switch with Resident Evil 2, and while we approach every streaming-only version with a healthy dose of caution and scepticism due to the inherent caveats of the tech, we’re happy to say that this one is a fine new addition to the line-up that makes a strong case for the validity of cloud gaming.

We asked you lovely lot this very same question of the Generation IX starters back when they were first revealed (the results of which saw Fuecoco come out on top with 38% of the votes), and Japanese site Famitsu has now asked again closer to launch, though the results tell a very different story (thanks, Go Nintendo).

Remember the ongoing dispute between Cooking Mama: Cookstar publisher Planet Entertainment and the series&#x27; rights holder Office Create dating back to 2020? Well, in an update, Planet has now been sued by Office Create.
There was actually a fallout between the two parties before the game&#x27;s release in 2020, but Planet Entertainment still went ahead and released the game around the world in digital and physical form. The IP holder Office Create at the time published an official statement, calling it out as an &quot;unauthorized release&quot;.

Two years ago, a game called Ova Magica launched on Kickstarter, and just three hours later, it was fully funded. Over the course of the Kickstarter campaign, it raised a total of €258,188 ($356,700 / £225,750) with over 4,000 backers. Needless to say, people were very excited for what Ova Magica had to offer.
Ova Magica is a &quot;wholesome JRPG experience&quot;, according to the official PR, which combines farming, monster-taming, and life-sim elements to create a single-player campaign that&#x27;s all about raising blobs.

                              <span>An investigation into suspected insider trading by former Square Enix employees is underway, and Japanese news site Fuji News Network reports that Sonic The Hedgehog’s co-creator Yuji Naka has been arrested in connection. Naka is alleged to have bought around 10,000 shares in Dragon Quest Tact developers Aiming back in 2020 for ¥2.8 million (£16,800). At that point, Naka was still working with Square Enix on Balan Wonderworld.

It’s the first time we’ve got anything close to a glimpse of the remake, still in its early prototyping stage, could look like. The seven slices of concept art were shown as part of Splinter Cell’s 20th anniversary.

That drops it £73, a terrific deal on a PSU that can handle anything up to (and including) an RTX 4090. We actually covered this power supply last month, when I was surprised to learn it had dropped to £90 after weeks of costing more than £100 in the crypto-boom era. Now it&#x27;s even cheaper, and that makes our recommendation stronger than ever.

                              <span>This year&#x27;s Saints Row reboot met financial expectations, according to the interim report of mega-publisher Embracer. The same can&#x27;t be said of the critical response, however, so developers Volition &quot;will transition to become part of Gearbox.&quot;

Except, this isn&#x27;t turn-based strategy, but a proper CRPG from the makers of the recent, well-liked Pathfinder games. Its first gameplay trailer awaits below.

It&#x27;s an open world mystery game set in a city in which every resident is simulated with daily schedules and routines, and it&#x27;s developed largely by a single person. Shadows Of Doubt has also fought my skepticism so far with playable demos and, now, a new official trailer. It sure looks like it&#x27;s doing the thing.

                              <span>Hot on the heels of their Solium Infernum announcement at the end of September, the studio behind strategy RPG Armello have announced another new game they&#x27;re working on during tonight&#x27;s PC Gaming Show Preview stream. It&#x27;s called Jumplight Odyssey (or &quot;J-Lo&quot; for short, as League Of Geeks studio director and co-founder Trent Kusters affectionately referred to it during an early preview presentation I attended last week), and it&#x27;s a starship roguelite colony sim that has big 70s anime vibes. Specifically, Star Blazers, the English adaptation of Leiji Matsumoto&#x27;s seminal Space Battleship Yamato, with which Jumplight shares a lot of its core visual DNA. 
In it, you play as Princess Euphora, who&#x27;s on a mission to save her people from the space conquering Zutopans, jumping from planet to planet in search of their Forever Star. It&#x27;s not due to arrive in early access until sometime next year, but I&#x27;ve seen a sneak peek of it running in an early alpha build, and lemme tell ya. FTL, Rimworld and Two Point Hospital likers (bear with me on that last one) are going to want to take note of this.

                              <span>Ever had a real-life experience where you’re something like 90% sure you’re actually in a horror film? Answers in the comments, please. Now, imagine that, but also someone asks you to pop your phone in a lockbox, you know, for safekeeping. Also, they say something like “You won’t need it where we’re going” and then do a murder wink at an imaginary camera. Something quite similar to this happens to our ill-fated documentary crew early in The Devil In Me. &#x27;Aha!&#x27; I thought. Supermassive are being knowingly, playfully tropey again. Great. These games are best when they lean into the cheese like a drunk buffet guest, and I was pumped to watch it stumble around a schlocky murder party and get baked brie all over the elbows of its best tux.
For those yet to stick their snout into Supermassive’s truffle-trove of horror offerings, the basic premise of these narrative adventure games can best be summarised: What if shouting at the screen to try and stop idiot characters performing horror film no-nos actually worked? The formula was both invented and, miraculously, perfected in 2015’s Until Dawn. Since then, the studio have released three ‘episodic’ (although narratively independent) Dark Pictures titles, and The Quarry, all of which can best be summarised: Like Until Dawn, but not as good.

                              <span>Look, we can all agree that Spore is not quite the game it could have been. In terms of the different eras that you coach your little creature species through, the game peaks early on in the cell stage. After that, everything goes a little downhill. But I&#x27;ll tell you what: I&#x27;ve never, ever been so excited for a game to release, and I don&#x27;t think I ever will again. I was losing sleep over it. And there&#x27;s one simple reason: the Creature Creator.

                              <span>I’m always amazed by the Minecraft building community. We’ve seen the likes of Tolkien’s Middle-earth, Breath Of The Wild, Disneyland, Game of Thrones&#x27; Westeros, and the Star Wars universe all built block by block - and that’s only a short list of what you can find online. The creations you can find are honestly kind of amazing, and Minecraft builders are constantly putting out new masterpieces for fellow Minecrafters and non-crafters to oggle at all year round.

Upcoming hunting game Wild Hearts is packing plenty of what devs Omega Force are calling Karakuri, the magical flat-pack wooden kit the game’s warriors use to battle the various beasties in their fantasy take on medieval Japan. You can get a glimpse of some of the Karakuri battles that Wild Hearts contains in the trailer below, including a rather awesome looking monocycle and a furious monkey with a very nasty skin condition.

That&#x27;s the premise of The Banished Vault, an upcoming strategy game announced this week. You&#x27;ll flee from solar system to solar system in a mobile monastery megacity, trying desperately to scavenge what you can before an all-annihilating pursuer catches up. The Banished Vault is the first game on the new indie publishing label of Bithell Games, but more interesting to me is that it&#x27;s coming from the designer of Sun Dogs.

Treyarch Studios have tweeted to announce that the Call Of Duty League Moshpit playlist mode is delayed due to some recently discovered issues. The Black Ops Cold War devs did say it would only be a “slight delay”, though, and that they’d provide an update on when the mode would be active as soon as they could.

But not to worry, because The Electronic Wireless Show podcast has collected some of the best games for having a virtual stare, so you can do it from the comfort of your own home.
This does necessitate us defining wistful first, although honestly I think I nail it out of the gate. Nate also provides this week&#x27;s Cavern Of Lies mini-game, and a) he nearly beats me but b) he&#x27;d never heard of Thomas Was Alone, which is pretty funny.

Subaquatic sim Surviving The Abyss is diving straight into the human genepool when it enters early access on Steam on January 17th, though. The game’s coming from Rocket Flair Studios under the Paradox Arc label launched back in August.

The teaser video seems to have been taken from the end of an advance copy of its predecessor The Devil In Me, which is released tomorrow so keep your eyes peeled for our review. Supermassive will likely follow up with an official teaser after The Devil In Me&#x27;s out. You can watch the leaked teaser below, if you’re not spooked by the possibility of spoilers.

                              <span>The publishers of Doom Eternal have shared a strongly worded statement aimed at composer Mick Gordon, following Gordon’s recent outpouring on Medium. Bethesda tweeted their statement last night, calling Gordon’s lengthy post explaining his experience working on Doom Eternal’s soundtrack &quot;a one-sided and unjust account of an irreparable professional relationship”. Gordon had replied to an open letter published on Reddit by id Software executive producer Marty Stratton, more than two years after Stratton’s letter was posted online.

That&#x27;s the choice you&#x27;ll have to make between these two Dell monitor deals at Dell&#x27;s US outlet, with Black Friday prices on a 24-in 1080p 240Hz monitor ideal for competitive gaming or a 32-in 4K 144Hz model with HDMI 2.1 that would suit a high-end gaming PC, PS5 or Series X. Both are incredibly good value after today&#x27;s discounts, and well worth taking a look at if you&#x27;re in the market for a monitor upgrade!

From inside Teams, you can now play procrastination classics like Solitaire and Minesweeper as well as party games meant for oodles of people. You can even play co-op Minesweeper. And hey, if it happens inside Teams, no one can deny it&#x27;s work. If anything, you&#x27;re engaging with the business experience even harder. Be sure to mention that in your annual performance review.

Don&#x27;t you just love when someone applies scientific levels of study to something very un-scientific? It might sound a bit pointless, but that&#x27;s how we end up with beautiful pieces like 4-hour video essay deep dives into a non-existent theme park — and Xelshade&#x27;s wonderfully detailed examination on &quot;What Looks Like A Pokémon&quot;.
Posted to the Pokémon subreddit on November 15th, Xelshade&#x27;s analysis includes — like all good scientific theses should — a preface, experiments, data, and a summary. Honestly, our university essays never looked this good.

Blue eyes, sand, and big bitey worms. If you&#x27;re a fan of beloved, janky &#x27;80s movies or beloved, confusing &#x27;60s sci-fi epics, then you&#x27;ll recognise these as the elements of Frank Herbert&#x27;s Dune. But oh, what&#x27;s this? This isn&#x27;t Dune — this is Starsand, a Switch game that looks like Dune and sounds like Dune, but is not Dune. And that&#x27;s not a bad thing.
Starsand plops its azure-eyed protagonist down onto a desert planet (not Arrakis) and instructs him to survive. It will then throw sandstorms at you, have your camp invaded by horrible sand-centipedes, threaten you with searing heat, biting cold, thirst, and hunger — and you&#x27;ll have to figure out how to survive it all.

                              <span>A lesson in the importance of first impressions.
With the Wii U turning ten years old (crikey, we&#x27;re really starting to feel old now), it&#x27;s only natural that we&#x27;re finding ourselves looking back at the console that&#x27;s graciously gifted so much of its previously-exclusive software to its successor. Where did things really go wrong? What did we like about it? What did we dislike?
For many people, concerns really started with its debut trailer. Never has an official reveal left us so confused as to what Nintendo&#x27;s new console actually was. Gamers across the world were left a little baffled as to what exactly Nintendo was going for with Wii U. Was it a peripheral for its previous platform, or an entirely new console?

Black Friday is upon us once more, and this Canada-only deal on the Nintendo Switch is well worth a look if you&#x27;re hoping to get a new Switch or the OLED model in time for Christmas.
The deal is being held at the Real Canadian Superstore, a chain of supermarkets across Canada, with similar Switch deals held at other stores in the same chain, like the Atlantic Superstore.

                              <span>What do U reckon?
We have arrived at the eve of the 10th anniversary of Wii U&#x27;s launch. Yes, it was a decade ago when the hardcore Nintendo fans began queuing outside stores across North America at midnight (12 days later in Europe, and 8th December in Japan) to pick up and take home a shiny new piece of Nintendo hardware. It&#x27;s always a special moment — regardless of the platform and the ultimate commercial success of the system — and gamers had quite the selection of launch titles to choose from, too.
Compared to Switch, which launched with just 10 games to its name, Wii U arrived with 25 games right off the bat. Certainly, it lacked a Mario 64, Wii Sports, or Breath of the Wild-style &#x27;killer app&#x27;, and most of these third-party ports were old news for anyone with a PlayStation or Xbox, but there were some big names on the docket here.

After releasing a teaser at the end of last month, Netflix has now revealed its first full trailer for the upcoming Sonic Prime series which will debut on the streaming service on 15th December.
Ever the parameters for a writer&#x27;s get-out clause, the multiverse looks to play a big part in the upcoming series. The above trailer sees Sonic falling through a number of alternate realities and bumping into different versions of Knuckles, Tails, Amy and Eggman in each. There is even one moment in which SEGA&#x27;s blue blur says the line &quot;enough running&quot; before proceeding to... do more running.

It is unfortunately too often the case that pieces of video game history are lost over time. T-shirts are run through the tumble dryer, figures are swallowed by children or kicked under sofas, cartridges are filled with dust and controllers are snapped in rage. Fortunately there are people out there like @KeshiCorner who are determined to keep video game history alive.
Doing so requires getting their hands on classic video game figures - KeshiCorner&#x27;s current focus is on a range of &#x27;keshi gomu&#x27; rubber figures from the 1980s and 90s - and 3D scanning them so that they can be printed time and again in the future. Working their way through a series inspired by The Legend of Zelda, the scanner has recently come to scanning Link, and the results are seriously adorable.

Sometimes, when a new Pokémon game nears, questions loom. Pokémon are mysterious creatures. Where do they come from? What are their natures? Why do professors send children out into the world on unpaid scientific internships and have them participate in illicit, unethical animal fights?
Well, instead of doing that last part, here at Destructoid we usually turn to Occams for answers about Pokémon instead, via the encyclopedic Occamsdex. It&#x27;s better than getting arrested for unpaid child labor and/or creating a new Micheal Vick.
And thus, we asked the Destructoid community to submit Pokémon for his judgment once more!

                              <span>Take a trip down to the bayou
NORCO was one of my favorite games of 2022, with an eerie tone, surreal visuals, and a setting that has some of the most profound political commentary I&#x27;ve seen from a game of late. It&#x27;s a must-play if you like story-driven games or point and click adventures, and it&#x27;s honestly a crime that it wasn&#x27;t nominated for Best Narrative at the Game Awards, because the writing is absolutely gorgeous. NORCO has been out since March, but the game&#x27;s developer Geography of Robots just announced today via Twitter that the southern gothic adventure is now available to play on PlayStation and Xbox consoles.
Naturally, the game&#x27;s controls were entirely reworked for controller instead of mouse and keyboard, and the devs also confirmed in the Twitter thread that the PC version of the game also has controller support now. They even included a helpful graphic that breaks down how the control scheme will work on a PlayStation Dualshock. Basically, you can either use the left stick as a virtual mouse, or simply use the D-pad to select &quot;hotspots or other UI elements.&quot; Big win for controller simps like me.
https://twitter.com/roboticgeo/status/1593265507939098625
For those who may not know what to expect from NORCO&#x27;s gameplay, Geography of Robots describes it pretty well in yet another tweet:
&quot;Gameplay-wise, it resembles classic first-person text-based pixel adventures like Snatcher, Deja Vu, Policenauts, VA-11 HA-11 A, Read Only Memories, Circuit&#x27;s Edge, Rise of the Dragon, etc. There are also combat minigames. You can automate them if you want.&quot;
NORCO is one of those games that I enjoyed so much that I want to buy it on another platform, and I have to admit I&#x27;m enticed by the idea of playing it on a bigger screen. Regardless of any awards, it&#x27;s one of the most stylish, thoughtful indie games of recent memory, and I think in the long run, it&#x27;ll stick around.

                              <span>Speed Demons
Atlus has released a brand new update for its stylish Shin Megami Tensei spin-off, Soul Hackers 2 — Now available to download on all platforms, the new patch adds four new demons to the mix, and includes several new abilities to help slim down that all-consuming time-grind.
The new &quot;Dash&quot; toggle will although players to control Ringo at a much-accelerated rate, helping her to negotiate the monster-infested labyrinths with speed, and even performing her standard &quot;slash&quot; in double-quick time. This new speed increase can also be applied to battles themselves, with a &quot;Speed Up&quot; toggle allowing for quick and easy carvings in face-to-face encounters. Hopefully, these two new additions will make grinding for XP less of a chore.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;Vw5GhQxUiVg
Four new demons have been added to the Soul Hackers 2 roster via this new update. The demons are the fiery Aitvaras, the stoic priestess Isis, the frankly bizarre Neko Shotgun, and the hyper-iconic Pixie — depicted in her original Devil Summoner form. It should be noted that acquiring these new demons does not count toward the in-game Registration Percentage of the Demon Compendium, nor its associated achievements or trophies.
Finally, a small run of tweaks and bug fixes should improve loading times across the board, while other changes streamline the shop experience, and include new preventative measures to stop button mashers from accidentally selecting the wrong options while plowing through the game&#x27;s many menu screens. Huh, an update that asks you to take your time AND speed up.
Soul Hackers 2 is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

A headwind approaches, as Pokemon Scarlet and Violet arrive on the Nintendo Switch on Friday, November 18. It&#x27;s one of the last major releases of 2022, and in my mind, arguably the biggest last release of 2022.
Just Dance 2023 is going for a sort of counter-programming angle too, as it drops on November 22. Then there&#x27;s Bravery and Greed, as well as Finding Paradise, to round out the week. Oh, and a ton of other stuff too.

Sonic The Hedgehog. One of the most iconic video game characters ever created. He runs at the speed of sound, saves animals from robots, and best of all, he’s colored blue and has been in legitimately fantastic games. Though the blue blur is nowadays pretty synonymous with surreal internet memes, it’s important to remember the classic titles that made him the icon he is today.
For example, consider our list of the top 5 Sonic The Hedgehog games ever released.

Game studio Volition is about to fall under the umbrella of a new publisher, as Embracer Group has announced that the Saints Row developer is to make a side-step from being a subsidiary of Deep Silver to become a subsidiary of Gearbox Entertainment.
Embracer Group, (which owns all of the above), made the announcement in a quarterly financial report.
&quot;Going forward, Volition will transition to become part of Gearbox which has all the tools, including an experienced management team in the United States, to create future success at Volition,&quot; declared Embracer in the report. &quot;This is the first internal group transfer where we transfer a major studio between operative groups, but it is not necessarily the last.&quot;

                              <span>Glory to the button mashers
Capcom has given players their first in-depth look at the recently revealed &quot;Dynamic&quot; control option for upcoming sequel Street Fighter 6 — A new trailer demonstrates the ingenious new mechanic in action, which will open up the floor for both the casual and/or younger player.
As we have previously reported, the SF6 Dynamic controls use A.I. to gauge the situation and apply one-button combos as they best fit the situation. Thus, button mashes can land decent combos from jump-ins and at close range, while applying pressure with projectiles and other moves from range. The system will adjust to the opponent&#x27;s position, offering up attack strings as best fit the present state.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;1t_47kMYeu4
Obviously, such a system would be a bit of an advantage in online play, (although, frankly, a great player could probably still defend against it with ease), ad so Dynamic controls will be locked to offline play only. But for family feuds, drunken slap fights, or just getting together with friends for a quick mash fest, Dynamic controls represents one more way that Street Fighter 6 is going above and beyond to be one of the most accessible and playable series entries for every fighter who wants to step into the ring.
Now, can we please have a few more character trailers?.. Pretty please?

                              <span>We have a &quot;winter&quot; and &quot;spring&quot; update planned so far
Yesterday, Capcom unveiled some details for &quot;Title Update 3,&quot; which will be arriving in Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak later this month. There&#x27;s a lot of interesting stuff in there (that you can read about here!), but the publisher also managed to tease out future content as well.
At the end of their Title Update 3 video, Capcom gave us insight into what the future of Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak will entail. Following Free Title Update 3, we&#x27;re moving on to Free Title Update 4, which is in &quot;winter&quot; of 2023 (so before the end of Q1). It&#x27;s billed as &quot;version .14,&quot; and includes an Elder Dragon appearance, as well as a &quot;powered-up monster.&quot; No doubt there will be more paid DLC, tweaks, and quality of life changes too.
After that, we got a second tease for a &quot;spring&quot; 2023 update, which is predictably called Free Title Update 5 (version .15). No broad details were given about it, but it&#x27;ll likely include content similar to what we&#x27;ve seen in the past.
I&#x27;m glad that this model still exists, as live service games with paid season passes dominate the landscape. While the practice isn&#x27;t necessarily bad if done correctly: publishers can&#x27;t help themselves, and screw up decent games beyond recognition because of the monetiaztion model. Keeping Rise as a premium game with an expansion and free title updates has maintained its general quality.

Following on from this morning&#x27;s extraordinary news that Blizzard Entertainment is to suspend service of its games in China, the president of Chinese publishing partner NetEase has blasted the World of Warcraft developer for its role in the breakdown of contract negotiations.
Speaking very candidly on LinkedIn, Simon Zhu, spoke of his disappointment with the separation, stating that he himself had spent &quot;10,000 hours&quot; playing Blizzard games and claiming that he was &quot;heartbroken&quot; not only for himself, but for &quot;all of the players who lived in those worlds&quot;. Most pointedly, Zhu singles out an unnamed &quot;jerk&quot; at Activision Blizzard for, in Zhu&#x27;s opinion, causing damage to the relationship.
&quot;As a gamer who spent 10,000 hours in the world of Azeroth, Starcraft and Overwatch, I feel so heartbroken as I will no longer have the access to my account and memories next year,&quot; began Zhu. &quot;One day, when what has happened behind the scene could be told, developers and gamers will have a whole new level [of] understanding of how much damage a jerk can make.&quot;
&quot;Feel terrible for players who lived in those worlds.&quot;
As we reported earlier, Blizzard Entertainment will suspend service to its range of IPs in the China region, formerly distributed by NetEase. This includes hugely popular titles such as World of Warcraft, StarCraft, Diablo, Hearthstone, and Overwatch. It has since been confirmed that mobile title Diablo: Immortal falls under a separate contract and will continue to be distributed by NetEase.
Blizzard Entertainment is currently looking for a new partner to carry its products in the very financially lucrative territory in the future.

Tomorrow sees Supermassive Games launch The Devil in Me, the final &quot;season one&quot; episode of its celebrated Dark Pictures Anthology — And, in keeping with series tradition, the new title features a spooky teaser trailer for the series&#x27; next release, which has now been confirmed as sci-fi shocker Directive 8020.
The preview features a mission report from a lonely vessel in the vast reaches of the stars. Seemingly on a mission to find a new home for humanity, the team has apparently run afoul of some otherworldly intruder — with hints offered that it has the ability to replicate human beings. So, while it&#x27;s very cliche for me to say so, this would suggest a sort of &quot;Alien meets The Thing&quot; vibe. Sounds wicked.
You can check out the new teaser trailer below, as captured by GameTrailers.

As a cool bit of trivia &quot;Directive 8020&quot; is an actual NASA directive. It is a directive issued for &quot;Biological contamination control for outbound and inbound planetary spacecraft&quot;. This is all well and good on paper, but it will be interesting to see how it works out within the reality of some terrifying, shapeshifting monstrosity. Let&#x27;s just wait here for a while... See what happens.
The Dark Pictures: The Devil in Me launches tomorrow, November 18, on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox.

                              <span>NetEase license ends January 2023
Blizzard Entertainment has announced that it is preparing to suspend service for all of its gaming properties in China in 2023.
On January 23, Blizzard&#x27;s agreement with Chinese holding company NetEase, which handles regional publishing duties, will expire. The two companies have been unable to negotiate new terms for a contract extension, and thus Blizzard will be taking the severe step of suspending service for all of its online titles — including World of Warcraft, Warcraft III: Reforged, Hearthstone, Diablo III, Diablo: Immortal, StarCraft, Overwatch, and Heroes of the Storm.
According to an official statement by the publisher, the Chinese release of Overwatch 2, World of Warcraft: Dragonflight, and Hearthstone: March of the Lich King &quot;will proceed later this year&quot;. Blizzard Entertainment will continue to see a new publishing partner in the highly lucrative market.

NetEase has handled Blizzard Entertainment&#x27;s output in China since way back in 2008, so this decision is quite surprising. Additional reporting by Bloomberg suggests that the failed contract negotiations were not just a matter of money, but also disputes on how to handle player data and general IP management. No doubt the news will also come as a major shock to the many Chinese esports players/teams that have built their brand around Blizzard games.
&quot;We’re immensely grateful for the passion our Chinese community has shown throughout the nearly 20 years we’ve been bringing our games to China through NetEase and other partners,&quot; said Blizzard President Mike Ybarra. &quot;Their enthusiasm and creativity inspire us, and we are looking for alternatives to bring our games back to players in the future.&quot;
You can read Activision Blizzard&#x27;s official statement on the matter on the studio&#x27;s website.
NetEase president Simon Zhu made his candid thoughts very clear on LinkedIn.

                              <span>You couldn&#x27;t write it...
Publisher Deep Silver has announced that the long, long, loooooong late coming Dead Island 2 has been delayed and will not see its intended February 3 release date — The MIA zombie smasher will now arrive on PC and console platforms on April 28, 2023.
&quot;The irony of delaying Dead Island 2 is not lost on us, and we are as disappointed as you undoubtedly are,&quot; reads a short statement from Deep Silver. &quot;The delay is just 12 short weeks and development is on the final straight now; we’re going to take the time we need to make sure we can launch a game we’re proud to launch. For those of you who’ve been waiting for years, thank you for hanging in there with us.&quot;
&quot;In the meantime, we will be releasing an exciting new trailer and gameplay at The Dead Island 2 Showcase, which will premiere on December 6 on our Twitch and YouTube channels, as well as on the Dead Island website.&quot;
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;6Dv1cqr1npA
Whilst you undoubtedly do not need a refresher course, Dead Island 2 has had a long and arduous road to fruition, having first been teased way back at E3 2014. Over the following years, myriad reports of cancellation and delays — with no less than three studios working on the title, led many to believe that the open-world sequel was becoming something of an urban myth. However, a release date was finally announced in August of this year... A release date which has now been pushed just a little further backward.
The best things come to those who wait? We&#x27;ll soon see if this turns out to be an axiom supporter.
Dead Island 2 launches April 28, 2023, on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC (via Epic Games Store).

The game mode offerings in the Call of Duty franchise have really expanded over the years, and with the recent release of Modern Warfare II, there are more modes than ever before. Excluding Warzone as its own, separate thing, the base Call of Duty multiplayer experience has 11 different game types in the main MP playlist, not including the co-op campaign modes you can play with a buddy. You&#x27;ve got the classics in there like Team Deathmatch and Kill Confirmed, but there are also some new modes to try out like Headquarters and Prison Rescue.
While I&#x27;ve certainly had a ton of fun throwing myself into some games to try out modes I don&#x27;t usually play, I am very much a creature of habit -- Domination is by far my favorite mode, and a lot of the time I&#x27;ll load into the game wi…</span>

Last week, video game composer Mick Gordon issued a lengthy statement detailing his side of the behind-the-scenes details of Doom Eternal&#x27;s soundtrack. Today, Bethesda issued its response.
In Gordon&#x27;s post, the composer alleges that id Software failed to pay him for part of the game&#x27;s soundtrack. He also specifically cites executive producer Marty Stratton&#x27;s letter from 2020 as a statement full of &quot;lies, disinformation, and innuendo.&quot; Issues arose after fans noted sound mixing discrepancies in the Doom Eternal soundtrack.

                              <span>Ubisoft celebrated Spinter Cell’s 20th anniversary by releasing a new video reflecting on the series and discussing its upcoming remake. The video revealed some details on the project’s status as well as some early images. 


The Splinter Cell remake was first announced last December, but we’ve known very little about it other than it’s being rebuilt from scratch in Snowdrop Engine (used to make The Division, Mario + Rabbids games). In the video, the team states the experience will be identical to the 2002 title but it wants to implement improvements and features introduced in later Splinter Cell titles as well as smooth some rough edges. For example, the team wants to give players more opportunities to de-escalate situations when things go awry instead of getting an instant Game Over. 
The dev team also shares that the project is still in the early prototyping phase. As such, the studio will be going dark “for a while” to focus on making the game, so it will likely be a good while before we hear anything substantial about the remake again. In the meantime, you can take a look at the gallery of new concept images shared during the presentation below. 

Splinter Cell doesn’t have a release window or announced platforms. This remake is only one of many on the horizon, and you can keep up with all of them by checking our big list of upcoming video game remakes.</span>

                              <span>Trinity Fusion is an upcoming futuristic sci-fi action-roguelite that looks great, and its first closed beta begins today. 
Developer Angry Mob Games announced today that you can sign up for the beta right now, which will run through November 24. If you don&#x27;t make it into this round of playtesting, don&#x27;t worry – you might get an invite to access the second closed beta beginning December 6. It will run until December 13. Before signing up, though, check out the Trinity Fusion reveal trailer below: 


As you can see, Trinity Fusion looks like a fun and stylish take on the ever-growing roguelite genre, bringing some Strider vibes with a dash of Trine in there too. 
&quot;Set across three shattered versions of the game&#x27;s world, Trinity Fusion casts players in the role of the Hitchhiker, a cross-dim…</span>

                              <span>Update, 11/17/2022:
Earlier this year, Supermassive Games filed multiple trademarks for new games that many predicted were part of its Dark Pictures anthology series. One of those games was Directive 8020 and now, with the latest anthology game, The Devil In Me, out tomorrow, it&#x27;s been confirmed that Directive 8020 is up next. It will be the Season 2 premiere of The Dark Pictures series. 
This news comes by way of GameTrailers, who spotted the teaser trailer for Directive 8020 as part of The Devil In Me&#x27;s release, keeping in tradition with the latest game teasing the next game, as reported by Destructoid.
Check out the teaser trailer for The Dark Pictures: Directive 8020 for yourself below: 


As you can see, Directive 8020 will be the series&#x27; first forray into sci-fi horror, and it seems …</span>

                              <span>Saints Row, a reboot for the series, was released back in August and while some players were happy with the end result, others were not. And now, due to Saints Row failing to meet the full expectations of Embracer Group, developer Volition will become part of Gearbox Entertainment. 
This news comes by way of Video Games Chronicle, which reports that Embracer CEO Lars Wingefors discussed this transition in a statement released alongside the company&#x27;s second-quarter earning results. 


&quot;The reception of Saints Row did not meet the full expectations and left the fanbase partially polarized,&quot; Wingefores said in the statement. &quot;The game development studio, Volition, has been working hard to improve the player experience. Financially, Saints Row has performed in line with management expectations in the quarter. Going forward, Volition will transition to become part of Gearbox which has all the tools, including an experienced management team in the US, to create future success at Volition.&quot;
Wingefors notes that this is the first time the company has performed an &quot;internal group transfer where we transfer a major studio between operative groups,&quot; but says that &quot;it is not necessarily the last.&quot; 
Saints Row currently sits at 61 on Metacritic (for the PlayStation 5 version), with a user score of 2.1. Game Informer gave the game an 8.5 out of 10 in its review and you can read what we liked about Saints Row here.

                              <span>Dead Island 2 has been delayed to April. 
Originally due out on February 3, this upcoming zombie romp will now hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC on April 28. It&#x27;s a delay of roughly 12 weeks, which isn&#x27;t too much longer considering fans have been waiting close to a decade for this sequel. As for why developer Dambuster Studios and publisher Deep Silver have delayed Dead Island 2, the team wants more time to ensure the game is the best it can be at launch. 
Here&#x27;s the full statement on the delay: 
While waiting to learn more about the game next month, watch the Dead Island 2 re-reveal trailer from earlier this summer and then watch our exclusive interview with the devs about the game&#x27;s procedurally generated gore system.

                              <span>Pokémon Scarlet and Violet hit store shelves and the Switch eShop tomorrow. Chances are, you&#x27;re seeing some reviews pop up right about now. While we would love to be one of those reviews, we&#x27;re not quite ready to publish our final verdict for a couple of reasons. First, the online servers are not yet available, and with four-player co-op serving as a big addition to the series, we want to fully test it out before delivering our review. I also just want a tad more time with the game before slapping a score on it; I&#x27;ve finished most of the main story, but I haven&#x27;t fully explored the end and post-game content. 
However, now that the review embargo is up, I can provide my full impressions before publishing my final review. I&#x27;m generally positive about Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. These are goo…</span>

Komiks pojednává o tom, jakým vývojem prošel Google Chrome a jaká rizika přinesl a přináší pro nás jako jednotlivce ale i pro celou společnost. Dozvíte se všechno, co jste kdy chtěli vědět o Chrome, ale báli jste se zeptat. Těšit se můžete také na Shoshanu Zuboff nebo veganské piraně :).

Prosíme o šíření komiksu mezi uživatele. Obzvláště takové, co berou prohlížeč jako jednoduchou aplikaci pro zobrazování stránek. Vysvětlete jim, jak velkou roli dnes prohlížeč hraje a jaké to má důsledky.</span>

                              <span>Ragnarok and roll on to the next one
Sony&#x27;s Santa Monica Studios may have a few projects under its wing at the moment. In a new interview, Santa Monica Studios&#x27; Cory Barlog says the studio is currently spread out across a lot of different things.
Speaking to the Los Angeles Times, Barlog says Sony Santa Monica Studio is currently &quot;spread out on a lot of different things.&quot; The director declines to specify what those are. But as the LA Times points out, there were rumors of a sci-fi project at the studio that was cancelled. Sony Santa Monica has also helped publish games in the past, like Journey.
Santa Monica Studio just launched God of War Ragnarok. the follow-up to the 2018 God of War reboot. And as Ragnarok director Eric Williams puts it, being the God of War studio isn&#x27;t a bad thing.
“I remember talking to someone from another game company, where they were trying to get me to leave,&quot; Williams told the LA Times. &quot;They said, &#x27;Do you just want to be known as the God of War guy for the rest of your life?&#x27; That was your big pitch to dissuade me? Because yes, I kind of do.”

Ancient myths and new legends
Considering the studio just wrapped one big game, expecting something new right away wouldn&#x27;t make much sense. The studio has yet to announce its next project, but that&#x27;s kind of like asking someone who just finished a marathon about tomorrow&#x27;s run.
Meanwhile, studio has been clear that Ragnarok is the end of the Norse saga for Kratos and crew. Whatever&#x27;s next seems like it&#x27;ll be a new step forward in some way.

                              <span>Cyberpunk&#x27;s first DLC is right around the corner
Fans of CD Projekt Red&#x27;s most recent release, Cyberpunk 2077, have been waiting quite some time now to learn some more information about the game&#x27;s first official DLC: Phantom Liberty. News of the spy thriller expansion was first released back in September via a teaser trailer, and we know it&#x27;s scheduled to drop sometime in 2023 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S (Stadia is also listed as a platform for release in the official Cyberpunk website&#x27;s blog post from a few months ago, but I have a feeling that one is subject to change).
While news of a more specific release window is up in the air, we do have confirmation as of today that Phantom Liberty will be paid DLC expansion, but we don&#x27;t know how much it&#x27;ll be yet, either. Paying for DLC is something that CD Projekt fans know well (just look at The Witcher 3), and if I had to guess based on precedence, I&#x27;d say this new expansion should be somewhere around $20 depending on how big it is. In a comment to GamesRadar+, the global PR director for CDPR, Radek Grabowski, said that the expansions are &quot;traditionally cheaper than full-price games,&quot; so at the very least we know it won&#x27;t be $60. We&#x27;ll take what we can get at this point.

This likely won&#x27;t be the only DLC we see for Cyberpunk, either, but if you ask me a spy thriller theme is a great place to start. I imagine the adventure will have something to do with corporate espionage, and if we&#x27;re basing predictions on the past Witcher DLC, there&#x27;s a good chance we could see new maps and characters, and even get a whole new synth-style soundtrack. I for one will be excited to see what comes next for Night City, especially after the renewed hype for the game from the Cyberpunk: Edgerunners anime.

                              <span>I&#x27;m too edgy for the purple one
The Gamecube occupies a nice little corner of my personal history when hormones were sabotaging any chance I had for a normal adulthood. As such, I view it with quite a lot of fondness. It didn’t have the massive library of the PS2, nor the substantial beef of the Xbox, but it did have one thing that gave it an edge over its competitors: a handle.
Below are five games that I picked out of its library to represent its best. You don’t have to agree, but if you come in here making claims that Pikmin 2 was the best game in its library, you’re wrong and should leave.

F-zero GX
There were quite a few games that I was super into when I was a teenager, but I think F-Zero GX might be the big winner. It was just really slick and had a lot to do. Just when you think y…</span>

                              <span>So yeah, Mr. X, I&#x27;m thinking I&#x27;m back
The Streets of Rage are headed to the silver screen. Lionsgate has picked up the film adaptation of the beat &#x27;em up Streets of Rage, with John Wick writer Derek Kolstad writing.
This news was reported on earlier this year by Deadline. Today&#x27;s confirmation sees the Streets of Rage project finding a home at Lionsgate, with Kolstad producing alongside Toru Nakahara. Dj2 Entertainment&#x27;s Dmitri M. Johnson, Timothy I. Stevenson, and Dan Jevons are also on board, as well as Escape Artists&#x27; Todd Black, Jason Blumenthal, and Tony Shaw.
Dj2 Entertainment is important to note, as the company worked on the recent Sonic the Hedgehog film series and is also looking to adapt It Takes Two.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;nDXY1WRef0Q
Streets of Rage saw a bit of a revival, thanks to the 2020 release of Streets of Rage 4 that went over pretty well. It&#x27;s a classic in the beat &#x27;em up genre, and it&#x27;s easy to see how someone behind the John Wick series would gravitate to a property like this.
&quot;When Dmitri first mentioned the idea of cracking a Streets of Rage movie, I was so immediately freaking in,&quot; Kolstad said in a statement via Variety. “And to play with Sega? The 10-year-old me is still grinning.”
A new adaptation
This adds another video game to the long list of upcoming video game adaptations. It&#x27;s become a popular trend, as productions like Arcane and Sonic the Hedgehog have worked out pretty well. Even Cyberpunk: Edgerunners and The Witcher, based off media properties that existed before their game counterparts, saw boosts thanks to their series&#x27; successes.
For Streets of Rage? I&#x27;m just hoping for some brawling action with the series&#x27; best. I could easily see a found-family story about a rag-tag crew of fighters working here. And it&#x27;s a good excuse to play some more Streets of Rage, too.

Following on from this weekend&#x27;s leak, developer Firaxis has officially announced the Civilization VI Leader Pass, which will see the coming months roll out a who&#x27;s who of famed leaders, dictators, and visionaries to the grand strategy sequel.
The first DLC drop, &quot;The Great Negotiators&quot; will launch on November 21 and will bring with it diplomatic masters Abraham Lincoln (United States) Queen Nzinga Mbande (Kongo), and Sultan Saladin (Arabia). Each leader brings to the table bespoke skills and abilities to help players grow and expand their presence within their home territories as well as in the global political picture.

The remaining five packs, which are yet to be dated, contain the following DLC leaders. All packs will be released by spring 2023.
Great Commanders Pack: Tokugawa (Japan), Nader Shah (Persia), and Suleiman the Magnificent (Ottoman Empire).
Rulers of China Pack: Yongle, Qin Shi Huang the Unifier, and Wu Zetian (All China).
Rulers of the Sahara Pack: King Ramses (Egypt), Ptolemaic Cleopatra (Egypt), King Sundiata Keita (Mali).

Note that some of the included leaders will require their respective scenarios and expansions in order to play. (For example: Nader Shah requires the previously releases Persia &amp; Macedon Scenario Pack).
The Civilization VI: Leader Pass is included as part of the Civilization VI Anthology. It will also be available to purchase separately on Steam and Epic Game Store. A price was not revealed.

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 just launched Warzone 2.0 (read: battle royale) with the Al Mazrah map, on top of a beta for the DMZ mode. If you&#x27;re in the mood for more battle royales, it sounds exciting. But of course, it&#x27;s a AAA game release, so not everything is rolling out quite so smoothly for existing owners.
I went through this process today, and can save you a headache.

If you already own Modern Warfare 2, re-download these packs
So I had Modern Warfare 2 already installed on my PS5, and even though the icon was updated to show Warzone 2.0, it actually wasn&#x27;t integrated in the game yet.
To rectify this (after trying to frantically locate it via in-game menus), I deleted the entire game and re-installed it. You can also opt to re-install the &quot;Multiplayer and &quot;Warzone 2&quot; packs by managing your game on the home screen. After you re-install the packs, then load up the game, you&#x27;ll see a completely different launcher (like the one in the above second screenshot).

If you don&#x27;t, you can find Warzone 2.0 on the PSN or Xbox storefronts
Alternatively, there is a Warzone 2.0 direct download in the PSN/Xbox storefronts.
Search for Modern Warfare 2, and it&#x27;ll come up with the above icon in tow (the highlighted game). It&#x27;s simply called &quot;Call of Duty: Warzone 2.0.&quot;

There is increasing evidence that Ubisoft is getting set to make its return to PC&#x27;s popular digital retail platform, Steam. The publisher essentially left the platform in 2019, choosing to release all of its PC out via its in-house Uplay service and later on Epic Games Store.
The first sign that Ubisoft might be heading back to chez Valve came earlier in November, when a Steam port of Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla was found lurking in the Ubisoft Connect database. The epic Norse adventure, which first launched back in 2020, will be receiving its final update next month, and thus is a prime candidate for a &quot;complete edition&quot; debut on Steam in time for the holidays.
But Ubisoft&#x27;s comeback plans were practically confirmed yesterday, when then colorful wheelie racer Roller Champions made a brief appearance on the Steamdb. Initially spotted by known Ubisoft leaker YoobieRE, the free-to-play title swiftly had its status hidden shortly thereafter. But, given the clarity of these two leaks, it seems highly likely that we can expect an official announcement from Ubisoft soon. As a somewhat-struggling multiplayer-centric title, a new Steam port could only serve to widen the Roller Champions audience and benefit the game as a whole.
Ubisoft is currently working on Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage, which will launch for PC and consoles in 2023.

                              <span>God of War 2 is still the king, and I think a lot of you agree
God of War has been around for 17 long years, and with Ragnarok still fresh in everyone&#x27;s minds, we figured it was worth taking a look at a few of the best games in the series.
Here&#x27;s a list of the top three God of War games to date!

3 - God of War Ragnarok (2022)
I&#x27;ve had access to God of War Ragnarok for weeks at this point: which is solely a statement on how much I&#x27;ve been absorbed with it, and nothing more!
Ragnarok is a fantastic modern action game that builds upon a a lot of what the 2018 laid down, while adding its own twists, turns, and character moments. There are some points that feel rushed, and give credence to the suggestion that this Norse story should have been a trilogy: but it does stick the landing, and has a…</span>

                              <span>Take us back to 2016
I&#x27;ve been playing Overwatch on and off basically since day one, so I&#x27;ve seen the game through all of its changes, for better and for worse. With every nerf, rework, and new hero drop, the game has evolved so much since 2016, and to many fans, it&#x27;s not even worth playing anymore, especially after the Overwatch 2 relaunch. Despite my qualms with the series (of which I have many, including recently getting hit with a ban from the entirety of Season One after a series of unfortunate disconnections from competitive matches), it&#x27;s still one of my favorite and most-played games to date. That being said, the roster is filling out fast, and I don&#x27;t find myself too thrilled with the most recent additions.

A new, free title update is on its way to Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak. The expansion to Monster Hunter Rise picks up some more monsters, as well as new layered weapons, Follower potential, and more in Free Title Update 3.
Free Title Update 3 rolls out on November 24, for everyone who owns Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak. The expansion&#x27;s currently available, on both Nintendo Switch and Steam.
This update includes, of course, more monsters. Plenty of big new baddies will be available to hunt, including the giant Chaotic Gore Magala. They seem like a bad time.

If your friends are too intimidated by the hunt, you can always call on Followers. The AI companions had events like Follower Quests, which let the various NPCs of Monster Hunter Rise team up with you for a special trek.
Free Title Update 3 will let you bring Followers along on Master Rank and Anomaly Research quests as well. And hunters might need the help too, as new monsters are being added to the Anomaly Research quests.
Breaking dawn
Weekly event quests are in store too, which will have unique rewards for hunters who finish the quests. And if you want even more cosmetics, there&#x27;s some paid DLC in store for Sunbreak.
New layered weapons are on the way as paid DLC. Layered weapons are essentially weapon skins, which modify the appearance but not the stats of a given weapon. These particular layered weapons are stuffed versions of popular Monster Hunter monsters. Whoever turned the Khezu into a weapon is a creative and devilish mastermind.
Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak&#x27;s Free Title Update 3 goes live on November 24.

                              <span>The Splattershot Nova and Brinewater Springs are coming in the new season
Splatoon 3 is about to get a whole lot busier with its new &quot;Chill Season,&quot; unveiled this week. But thanks to some new tweets, we now have a better idea of what the patch will usher in.
Coming on December 1, we&#x27;re getting more stages (I stress more, because some are old), including the Brinewater Springs arena; as well as more weapons, like the Splattershot Nova. The latter is really interesting based on the description: &quot;Its power won&#x27;t blow up a planet or anything, but you can fire all day long without affecting your aim. Splat speed ahead!&quot; Both can be viewed in the tweets below.
While we knew another season was upon us, the high-energy Pokemon Splatfest and this new season are a great shot in the arm for Splatoon 3. While the game had a lot going for it at launch, a lot of folks were a bit tired of it a month in. For me, Big Run could be the crown jewel of the update/Chill Season: which allows players to swap the standard Salmon Run map for a rotating selection of core multiplayer levels (beginning with Wahoo World).
Hopefully more of these types of updates are on the way. The frequency likely won&#x27;t change, but at the very least, the team can supplement them with surgical quality of life changes and tweaks to build on the foundation that&#x27;s already there.
Here&#x27;s a look at the Splattershot Nova

                              <span>Mechanical keyboards are brilliant. If you agree, you probably have one on your desk right now - and we have just the deal for you. SteelSeries&#x27; PrismCaps are an awesome upgrade over your stock keycaps, offering high-quality PBT construction, backlit legends and a beautiful two-tone &#x27;pudding cup&#x27; design that looks great, especially with an RGB keyboard. 
Normally a full keycap set of PrismCaps will cost you $30, but as an early Black Friday deal you can find these keycaps for 50% off - just $15. At that price, these are in impulse buy territory for me, as they&#x27;ll provide an immediate uplift over your existing keycaps and last for decades.

                              <span>Do you ever feel like multiplayer games would be better if other players were less abusive? Ubisoft and Riot Games are looking into training artificial intelligence to tackle bad behaviours within in-game chat, a research collaboration they’re calling Zero Harm In Comms. Ahead of their announcement today, I put some questions to Ubisoft La Forge’s executive director Yves Jacquier and Riot’s head of technology research Wesley Kerr to get some more insight on the joint project, and ask them exactly how their proposal will work.

Nestling in among all the talk of Mother Crystals and summons is a comment from writer Kazutoyo Maehiro that players will get to control another character than just our boy Clive. It sounds like you’ll only get a short while to step into this other, as yet unnamed character’s shoes, however, as they’re only playable in the early game.

                              <span>Cyberpunk 2077 may not live up to largely impossible expectations and promises, but I genuinely believe it&#x27;s a great time. Now that Night City is playable, it&#x27;s one of the most transportive video game cities out there, where cold calls from unknown numbers play into the fantasy of transforming from an upstart to a big shot who&#x27;s name travels along its neon-lit back alleys.

                              <span>So. Funny thing about our RTX 4080 review: I sort of don’t have time for it. We are amidst the busiest few weeks in PC gaming hardware for at least four years, with major product launches all round (from its rival Radeon RX 7900 XT to Intel’s 13th Gen CPUs) and a neverending stream of other components and peripherals that still need appraising. Also, I get the impression that if I don’t do more Black Friday stuff, senior ReedPop figures will show up at my flat and start taking my fingers with chisels.


Still, there will no doubt be potential graphics card upgrade-makers looking at the RTX 4080 to see if it’s more of a palatable purchase than the RTX 4090. That vanguard of Nvidia’s next-gen Ada Lovelace architecture is by far the most powerful GPU I’ve ever tested, and introduced a very cool new feature in DLSS 3, but with prices starting £1679 / $1599 it’s just not a sensible option. And since I did have an RTX 4080 show up at the last minute – Asus’ customised ROG Strix GeForce RTX 4080 OC Edition – I can at least provide some quick benchmarks and initial thoughts as to whether it’s a better deal.

                              <span>Two years ago I asked whether anyone had played retro FPS Chasm: The Rift and admitted that I’d never made it past the first level because I was roughly eight years old at the time, and it terrified me. Twenty years later I’ve returned to its re-release - and beaten the first level! And in the process, I’ve developed a particular appreciation for the old-school boomer shooter and its interesting quirks.

                              <span>In the Tom Waits song The Piano Has Been Drinking, the gravel-voiced pianist imitates a pissed-up lounge singer, slurring his way through nonsense lyrics, pounding on the keyboard, and occasionally hitting all of the wrong notes. Drinking too much wine and playing the piano badly and getting chased out of a hotel lobby is easy — most of us could do it — but it takes a degree of talent to sound entertainingly rubbish.
Likewise, Goat Simulator 3 is an expertly janky game about being a silly little goat and running around causing mischief. It’s a dumb, open-world simulator in which bugs have been promoted to features. Your goat is a horrible little kooky guy who mostly interacts with the environment through the medium of headbutts and licking. They’ll occasionally be catapulted into the sky by a spasmodic police car, or have their head irreversibly enlarged by a special machine, or bleat so hard at a beanstalk that it vanishes into thin air, but even during the most chaotic moments things feel entirely under control. As though the invisible hand of a very, very tired QA tester is always on the tiller.

                              <span>A whole bunch of classic Civilization leaders are coming back for Civilization 6’s upcoming Leader Pass, devs Firaxis have confirmed. You can expect 18 more leaders spread out over six DLC pack releases between November 21st and March 2023, 12 of whom are new leaders. Another six will be “new takes” on existing leaders from previous games in the Civ series. The Leader Pass’ existence was leaked by accident last week when promo art for the DLC appeared on the mobile version of the Civ website, before it was removed.

Normally you&#x27;re looking at around $50 to $150 for the case itself, with a further $70 to $100 for a matching SFX power supply, but today there&#x27;s an excellent deal at Amazon US that offers a small form factor case and a 700W PSU for just $130 - after a sizeable $120 discount. 
The case is the HYTE Revolt 3, and it&#x27;s attracted rave reviews for its easy build qualities, great thermals and beautiful design, making it an easy recommendation at this discounted price.

The patch had been scheduled for November 15th, and is meant to include hero balance adjustments for Zarya, Genji, Sombra, Kiriko, and D.va. The mid-season update should also see Mei return to the hero shooter after her two-week stint on the bench, Blizzard’s statement said, following issues with her icewall ability last month. You can now expect the patch to arrive tomorrow, November 17th, at 7pm GMT / 9pm CET / 11am PST. Not too long to wait, then.

For one, it&#x27;s set in a science fiction  world in which post-apocalyptic South Korea, the 10th century Byzantine Empire, and a 23rd century future are all somehow colliding. For two, it was revealed yesterday not with a brief logo or a show-nothing cinematic trailer, but with a nine minute video comprehensively depicting the actual game. Watch it below.

Along with Cloudflare and the .to registry, hosting provider Zenlayer is also asked to hand over data. Meanwhile, the ACE coalition&#x27;s reach continues to expand.

                              <span>In August, an Indian court ordered domain registrars including NameCheap, Tucows, Dynadot, and Sarek Oy to disable several pirate site domains. They failed to comply so the judge has just ordered two government agencies to take immediate action. Among other things, they must determine if the domain companies should even be allowed to do business in India.

                              <span>The long-awaited Pokémon Trading Card Game Live app is now available in beta worldwide on PC and mobile devices after a staggered rollout last month. The successor to the now-defunct Pokémon Trading Card Game Online game has been in the works since its reveal last September. 
For fans of the previous mobile game, TCG Live aims to offer a more polished, robust digital card game experience. You can collect cards either by scanning code cards or purchasing booster packs with digital currency earned in-game by completing quests and working through battle passes.
Players represent themselves with a customizable avatar and can challenge players to matches across the globe. It also sports a much sleeker presentation. Essentially, TCG Live is positioned as the Pokémon equivalent of modern card game apps such as Magic: The Gathering Arena and Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel. Check out the original teaser trailer below.


Since the game is in beta, expect updates to roll out over the coming weeks/months. Pokémon TCG Live can be played on iOS, Android, and is downloadable on PC.</span>

Developer Player First Games has detailed what to expect in Season 2 of MultiVersus and it looks to be packing quite the punch. Following the inclusion of Rick Sanchez and Morty Smith from Rick and Morty near the end of Season 1, it seems classic cartoon character Marvin the Martian will be next to join the roster. 
&quot;New roster additions are incredibly exciting, so we figured we&#x27;d give you a bit of a tease of one of the new characters who will be joining the MVS roster in Season 2,&quot; a blog post about the new season reads. &quot;Hailing from planet Mars and sent to destroy Earth with his Illudium Q-36 Explosive Space Modulator, M…</span>

                              <span>Few gaming magazines are as beloved as Nintendo Power. In the NES era, it offered many young Nintendo fans their first glimpse of the upcoming games that fired their imaginations, and poring over the detailed maps and tantalizing bits of info was a ritual almost as enjoyable as playing the games themselves.…

                              <span>Thank God for the idiotic joy of McPixel. A much-overlooked game from 2012, far too many people failed to recognise the semiotic brilliance of its sophisticated puzzles, based on innovative solutions centred around kicking people in their groin and then peeing on stuff. A decade later, finally a sequel—McPixel 3—is…

No, it&#x27;s not the self-important fantasy Cristiano Ronaldo dreams every night, it&#x27;s the setup for adventure RPG Soccer Story. You need to travel around its colourful, Nintendo-inspired world, cajole people into kicking balls once more, and then defeat them on the pitch. Soccer Story also now has a release date: November 29th.

Earlier this month, Football Manager 2023 came to the service, a game so all-consuming it barely leaves time to sleep. Now Microsoft have announced the remaining games to arrive in November, and as expected it includes the year&#x27;s remaining big release, co-op shooter Warhammer 40K: Darktide, as well as several indie darlings.

                              <span>Like so many games buried deep within my Steam library, I am unsure when I bought Painkiller: Black Edition or my exact reasons for doing so. I expect it was cheap in some kind of daily sale. Perhaps I was hungover, and hoped a small treat would ease my aching head. I vaguely recall booting it up once, perhaps a decade ago, and getting no further than its main menu. Painkiller was destined to rot in a digital purgatory of my own design forever, an unassuming icon that I would scroll past on my way to reinstall Destiny 2 for the 12th time without giving it a single thought. That is, until Valve finally sent me my Steam Deck.

                              <span>Season 1 of Warner Bros. licensed brawler MultiVersus is over, and Season 2 has begun today with an update that adds more reward tiers to the battle pass. There’s also a new Big Head Mode for the game’s recently added Silly Queue, and an in-game store that brings all MultiVersus’ skins and characters into one place for the first time. Weirdly, but appropriately, the game now keeps score of baskets on the Space Jam map and tracks how far away you shoot from too, so have some fun netting three-pointers with that.

                              <span>Just when I thought I had my top 10 games of 2022 sorted, Obsidian release Pentiment, forcing me to shred my former list and grab my quill and ink for a rewrite. It’s an odd pairing on paper - a detective thriller about a string of grisly murders set in the quaint countryside of 16th-century Bavaria - but, surprisingly, this coupling is a match made in heaven. 
Its captivating story of conspiracy and murder is as rich and dense as its setting, and it&#x27;s clearly made by a passionate team who have a deep love for the period. Playing Pentiment feels like riffling through the painterly pages of a medieval manuscript, but instead of finding the written gospel of saints and sinners, there are tales of angry farmers, greedy landowners, church scandals, religious turmoil, and murder. Fundamentally though, it&#x27;s a historical tale about faith and truth, and the lengths that people are willing to go to preserve them.

                              <span>After finishing the full version of Vampire Survivors, my fingers are limbered up for a livelier arcade walk-o-shooter. I&#x27;ve turned to Brotato, a game whose demo I enjoyed in the Steam Next Fest, and which launched into early access in September. I say with great affection: it feels (and looks) like it could have been a Flash game on Newgrounds. Plus it&#x27;s only £4.

Will Twitter&#x27;s technical infrastructure collapse after the staff who know how to maintain it are fired, leaving the would-be God Emperor of mankind rotting upon his failing Cobalt Throne? Will Twitter shut down due to financial collapse? Will people simply leave Twitter? All I know is, I&#x27;ll miss the Twitter bots which go down to collateral damage, the automated machines which tirelessly post art, poetry, jokes, stories, and probably dog photos. Here are some of my favourites!

Some Call Of Duty players looking forward to getting their itchy trigger fingers on the free-to-play battle royale have been struggling to sort out their preloads, though. This confusion echoes what happened with Modern Warfare 2019 when Warzone 1.0 launched back in 2020. If you’re bemused by the current preload sitch then watch the Warzone 2.0 launch trailer below, and let Freebird chill you out.

A store page for the Oklahoma expansion has popped up on Steam, although there hasn’t been an official announcement just yet. That’s most likely because today sees the launch of American Truck Simulator’s Texas DLC, so you expect to hear more about Oklahoma after that&#x27;s out of the way.

                              <span>It’s late evening. A family is dozing in front of the TV, their dog at their feet. Suddenly the TV turns to static, the ground shakes. While the parents peacefully sleep on, the toddler stirs. Oh no. I instantly expect nothing but the worst for the toddler, seeing whose game I’m playing – developer Jumpship was co-founded by Dino Patti, himself co-founder of Playdead, the studio behind Limbo and Inside. Both aren’t exactly known for treating their child protagonists well.
Somerville has clear stylistic parallels to Playdead’s work. Its 3D sidescrolling and light puzzle mechanics are similar, and the beautiful lighting effects and minimalist environments have led a lot of people to initially confuse Somerville as a Playdead game.

                              <span>Last week for the AMD EPYC 4th Gen &quot;Genoa&quot; launch day I published initial AMD EPYC 9554 and EPYC 9654 Linux benchmarks as part of my review. Those 64-core and 96-core Zen 4 processors performed phenomenally with Genoa having AVX-512, twelve channels of DDR5-4800 system memory support, higher TDP allowance, and other improvements over prior Milan(X) server processors. The other SKU that AMD sent over for review is the EPYC 9374F as their new 32-core high frequency part. For less than $5k, the EPYC 9374F is a high frequency Zen 4 32-core part with a 320 Watt TDP. Today&#x27;s benchmarks are looking at the EPYC 9374F against the EPYC 9554/9654 and various other AMD EPYC and Intel Xeon Scalable processors under Linux.</span>

Recent actions regarding Iran already show that the U.S. is well aware of the value of VPNs.

New villains are always emerging and new heroes are always swooping in to stop them. Crystal Dynamics is taking this same approach with its game starring Earth&#x27;s Mightiest Heroes. Marvel&#x27;s Avengers launched with six playable characters, but that&#x27;s far from all the heroes we&#x27;ll be able to take control of when it&#x27;s all said and done. Crystal Dynamics has said that all playable characters will be added at no additional cost, but additional upgrades for those characters could cost money.
Check out all the characters you can play as in Marvel&#x27;s Avengers, as well as all the heroes still to come.

The best stories in video games manage to fuse narrative, art, and gameplay in a way that elevates all three. Pentiment, the latest from Obsidian Entertainment, is a perfect example of this, telling a deep, complex story about religion, truth, and history in the form of a book, which the player experiences as it’s being written. Despite a few sections with inconsistent pacing, it’s a must-play for fans of adventure games.
Pentiment tells the story of traveling artist Andreas Maler and his time spent in Tassing, a fictional town …</span>

                              <span>Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet have been officially announced, complete with a reveal trailer that includes a first look at the starters this time around. 
These two games represent the start of Generation 9, which will surely bring its own competitive meta, anime, and even Pokémon card series to the franchise, and we can&#x27;t wait. However, there&#x27;s still some time before we actually get to play these games, so for now, we&#x27;ll be scanning every second of the reveal trailer (and subsequent trailers) for new locales, features, and of course, Pokémon. 


As any Pokémon player knows, with each generation comes two games to choose from. This time around, it&#x27;s Scarlet and Violet (is this a callback to Red and Blue, perhaps?). With two different versions, there are always some differences between…</span>

                              <span>Nintendo and Game Freak have released an overview trailer for Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet, showcasing more than five minutes of new footage. 
Hot on the heels of the official release of Pokémon&#x27;s ninth gen this Friday, this overview trailer will get you prepared for your upcoming journey through Paldea. Veteran trainers will recognize a lot of what the trailer is breaking down, like how your journey begins by picking a starter, but this overview trailer also breaks down a lot of the new things happening in these games. This includes the fact that you can tackle the gyms in any order, freely explore Paldea, and infiltrate the Team Star bases scattered around the region. 
Check out the Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet overview trailer for yourself below:


As you can see, this trailer is packed with lots of new looks at characters we&#x27;ll meet in Paldea, new Pokémon to catch and party up with, and more. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer&#x27;s hands-on preview with Pokémon Scarlet or watch our video about it here. Check out these new details about the first Tera Raid battle, an early-purchase Pikachu, and more after that and then read about Greavard, a new ghost-type dog in the games.

More specifically, both this new hero and this endgame raid-like experience will be available when Update 2.7 goes live on November 29. This update will also include &quot;ongoing revisions and tuning to heroes that [the studio] started in 2.6.&quot; 


&quot;This Omega-Level Threat is a new endgame challenge headlined by a climactic confrontation with the deranged genius to end the danger once and for all,&quot; a blog post reads. &quot;The Lab is a challenging AIM base that players will navigate before facing off one last time against MODOK in a grand multiplayer fight.

He told The Verge this in a new interview where he also revealed that no part of Microsoft&#x27;s ongoing acquisition of Activision Blizzard is about pulling the rug from underneath PlayStation&#x27;s plans; it&#x27;s just that the two parties can&#x27;t write a contract that says explicitly Call of Duty will be on PlayStation &quot;forever.&quot;

Somerville begins with a peek into the life of a young family and their dog. Everyone fell asleep watching TV on the couch, but the curious toddler gets themselves into some inconsequential trouble, forcing the family into their routine. Both the child and dog need to be fed and the kitchen needs to be cleaned, but something feels off. In an explosive moment that truly caught me by surprise, the family is suddenly reckoning with an alien invasion. An intense, often scary adventure kicks off from there. When Somerville hits its highs and fires on…</span>

                              <span>MSI&#x27;s RX 6650 XT is a capable graphics card for 1440p gaming, and it&#x27;s down from £380 to £299.99 at Overclockers after a healthy discount. 
It also comes with AMD&#x27;s Raise the Game Bundle, which includes copies of two upcoming games: Dead Island 2 and The Callisto Protocol (confusingly titled &#x27;The Callisto Project&#x27; by a potentially short-sighted Overclockers staffer). This is a pretty solid deal for three hundred of your Great British Pounds, especially as GTX 16-series cards were selling for this much recently and offer far worse performance.

                              <span>It takes a very special game to give you so much to learn, so many ways to do everything, that even after 1000 hours of playtime you still feel like a beginner. Factorio is daunting in the extreme, and I remember bouncing off it the first time I tried. Thank goodness I gave it a second chance. Building up a gigantic world-spanning, atmosphere-destroying factory slowly and methodically over dozens of hours is probably my favourite singleplayer experience in games.

Their reasons for the delay have been detailed in a lengthy Steam post, but it&#x27;s mainly good news: after receiving tons of feedback from their recent demo, the devs are now looking to expand the game&#x27;s scope and spend more time working on its futuristic dirigibles and such. They also released a new teaser trailer showing some customisable airships from the game, too.

The game brings out the worst in me on the regular, as I turn into a spittle slinger who screams into their fist after hitting the tiniest ledge or fighting an awful, awful boss. Frontiers is a janky beast - a mess. Yet, it&#x27;s a lot of fun when you&#x27;re mindlessly collecting stuff and sliding on rails and listening to excellent drum and bass tracks. It&#x27;s a playground of the best and worst kind, so if you&#x27;d like a test of patience with your precious spare time, then you simply can&#x27;t get any better than this.

The update will also bring a number of other visual and technical improvements, as well as integrate a number of mods into the fantasy RPG, originally released in 2015. Gameplay from the Complete Edition of The Witcher 3 is due to be shown off in a REDstreams event on Twitch next week, along with some new stuff for the game based on Netflix’s version of Geralt Of Rivia’s adventures.

                              <span>Eagle-eyed Microsoft Flight Simulator players have uncovered a secret that lets you play the first four games in the long-running series inside the cockpit of one the game’s planes. The Easter egg was introduced along with the game’s 40th Anniversary update, which went live on Friday. Activating the secret games will let you play them in your aircraft’s cockpit, using the keys on the screen to control the plane-within-a-plane.

                              <span>Supporter posts mean I can talk about things that aren&#x27;t PC games - at least that aren&#x27;t PC games yet - and this weekend I used a giftcard to get God Of War Ragnarök, the hacktion-dadventure sequel to the God Of War soft reboot. So far I am finding it, you know, fine, by which I mean it is good and fun but also almost exactly the same as 2018 one, right down to the tension between Kratos and his son Atreus. Their dynamic seems to have largely pressed the reset button so they can do a character growth again, with the differences so far being that Atreus is now taller and his voice has broken, Kratos doesn&#x27;t call him &quot;Boy!&quot;, and also he won&#x27;t shut up under any circumstances.

To gear players up ahead of time, some more details about one of the game’s four classes have been revealed in a new gameplay video.

Modder PureDark is working together with a small team on the unofficial plugin, called Skyrim-Upscaler, and it should help bump up those frame rates somewhat. It&#x27;s available to download now from Github if you want to give it a go yourself, but there’s no plan to release the plugin publicly until the modders sort out VR compatibility.

                              <span>The future has arrived in Monkey Moon&#x27;s new narrative management game, and you can see it all the next time you go and fill up your car. At EyeLife&#x27;s Flat Eye stations, why stop at getting milk and snacks when you can also pick up a whole new stomach, liver and other assorted organs? You&#x27;ll find them on aisle five, right next to the surgery booths. Perhaps you&#x27;d prefer a quick medical checkup instead, though? After all, your tailored biometric predictions for the day looked a bit dodgy earlier, and goodness knows you&#x27;re not going to wait to see an actual doctor about it.
Afterwards, why not escape for a bit and treat yourself to an immersive VR experience? They&#x27;ve got everything from hour-long fantasies to ones that last days, or even weeks. Your choice. And if you&#x27;re short on time, you could always just give yourself those happy memories by sitting in their mind-altering MemoryMachines for a couple of minutes. Just don&#x27;t forget to steer clear of the big recycle chambers. I heard something terrible happened to a dog who wandered into one recently, and the owner went absolutely ballistic. And watch out for the GentleSleep pods, too. I&#x27;ve only ever seen the clerk take long black sacks out of there and stick them in the incinerator, and the smell was awful.

                              <span>Nvidia DLSS 3 is arguably the single most interesting thing to emerge from the RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 GPU launches. Even with, I’ll concede, some limits: whereas previous DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) versions have been available to any GeForce RTX graphics card, DLSS 3 is currently only usable on these RTX 40 series models. Or will be, once the RTX 4080 goes on sale on November 16th. Yet having tested it out on the RTX 4090, I’m convinced it could be as big a deal as the cards themselves, especially if you have a high-refresh-rate gaming monitor.

                              <span>Survival city-builders put the fear of God in me. There’s just something about managing an entire civilisation of people that just shreds my nerves. Managing the last group of people alive on whatever world they inhabit has me questioning my every decision like I’m cutting wires underneath a bomb.
It’s a relief then, that Floodland is a bit more chill than some of its city-building contemporaries. Gone are the humanity-ending threats like Frostpunk’s great Winter storm, forever bearing down on you and periodically tightening its grasp around your neck. Here you have a simple group of stranded civilians looking to pick up the pieces in the aftermath of an apocalyptic flood.

                              <span>Crucial&#x27;s rather excellent value SATA DRAM-less QLC SSD, the BX500, is down to £56 on Amazon UK from an RRP of £74. I feel that&#x27;s a decent savings on a drive ideal for upgrading an older machine or as media/game storage in a new one, where money spent per gigabyte is the primary measurement of a drive&#x27;s suitability. (If performance is the objective, then a faster NVMe SSD drive is the way to go.) And by that measure, this drive is almost off the scale, with a cost of just 5.6p per gigabyte.

Get the Crucial BX500 1TB for £56 (RRP £74)

This update will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, and it will be free to everyone who already owns the game.

                              <span>The end of Fortnite Chapter 3 is upon us as Epic Games has revealed that its finale event will take place next month. 
More specifically, the finale event will take place on December 3 at 1 p.m. PT/4 p.m. ET. This news was revealed through a title card teased at the end of the Fortnite Champion Series, which took place over the weekend, as reported by Eurogamer. You can see the title card at the top of this story, if you&#x27;re curious. 
Unfortunately, that&#x27;s all that Epic Games teased in terms of the end of Fortnite&#x27;s Fracture era. As for what&#x27;s in store for Chapter 4 or what this finale event might play like, that remains unknown. Fortunately, we don&#x27;t have to wait too much longer, though, because the event begins in just a few weeks. 
If it&#x27;s anything like previous Fortnite chapter finales, then expect huge PvE battles across the island, plenty of spectacle, an exciting conclusion, and of course, some downtime as the game prepares to launch the next chapter.

                              <span>Brazil says blocking measures to tackle the rise of pirate IPTV services and devices are coming soon. In the meantime, a new system of fines will apply to suppliers and users alike. The government has other plans which appear to render all TV boxes illegal by default, pending official approval. And if anyone modifies an approved device or &quot;uses it incorrectly&quot;, that&#x27;s an offense too.

                              <span>AMD&#x27;s Ryzen 5000 series CPUs are getting increasingly affordable, with this week bringing rather good prices on the lowest-tier Ryzen 5 5500. This is, to the best of my knowledge, the cheapest Ryzen CPU in the lineup, but still quite a capable chip with power that&#x27;s roughly equivalent to the old Ryzen 5 3600. This processor normally retails for £110, but today you can pick one up for £88 when you use code BAG20OFF.

                              <span>A federal court in Seattle has dismissed the hacking and DMCA circumvention claims filed by AimJunkies against game developer Bungie. The cheat seller filed the claim in a retaliatory move after it was sued for copyright infringement relating to Destiny 2 hacks. The order is a clear win for Bungie, but the legal dispute is not over yet.

The currently unnamed network reportedly serves 900,000 users and reportedly generates millions of euros in monthly profits. Video seems to confirm a raid on a location where Sky content was being captured for illegal redistribution.

                              <span>Standing here, I realize that this Super Replay will be a cut above the rest because we’ll be slicing and dicing in Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance! Join us today on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central to enjoy two hours of what will be a full playthrough of the cult favorite action game streaming weekly each Friday. You can also catch up on previous episodes by visiting our new Game Informer Shows YouTube channel or watching the embedded episode below. 
Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance serves as a sequel/spin-off to Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots that puts cyborg ninja Raiden at the helm. Instead of sneaking around in boxes, players eviscerate foes in fast-paced, stylish action courtesy of developer Platinum Games. Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look.

                              <span>Remedy Entertainment has announced a new deal with publisher 505 Games to co-develop and market Control 2. The news also provided insight into the sequel&#x27;s development status. 
According to a press release, Control 2 (once known as Codename Heron) is currently in the concept phase, being built in Remedy’s proprietary Northlight engine. The game will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. Remedy will publish the PC version while 505 will handle the game’s console releases. Control 2 has no release window, but Remedy did release a piece of concept art, posted below. 
The press release also states that Control 2’s development budget initially sat at 50 million euros. Remedy and 505 will equally split marketing and development costs, as well as revenue generated by its release. Remedy retains full ownership of the Control IP, however. The press release also reveals that the first Control has sold over 3 million copies since launching in 2019. 
“We are excited to deepen our cooperation with Remedy and continue the success story of Control together,” say Rami and Raffi Galante, co-CEOs of Digital Bros Group/505 Games. “... Control is the biggest investment 505 Games has ever made, so it has a special place in our hearts. We are grateful to the whole player community that has made Control such a long-lasting and loved game, and are even more excited to bring out Control 2.”
This announcement was first teased last June, when Remedy and 505 revealed plans for new triple-A Control experiences. That same update revealed an upcoming multiplayer spin-off title known as Project Condor. Earlier this year, Remedy also struck a deal with Rockstar to develop remakes of Max Payne 1 and 2.</span>

The news broke this morning with BTAS co-star Diane Pershing, who voiced Poison Ivy, posting on Facebook that Conroy had passed yesterday from an illness, later identified as cancer. Warner Bros. has since confirmed the news. 
&quot;Very sad news: our beloved voice of Batman, Kevin Conroy, died yesterday,&quot; Pershing writes. &quot;He&#x27;s been ill for a while but he really put in a lot of time at the cons, to the joy of all of his fans. He will be sorely missed not just by the cast of the series but by his legion of fans all over the world ... RIP, friend.&quot;

                              <span>Where the Water Tastes Like Wine is a pretty bleak game, but it’s also really good! It’s set in Depression-era America, a time when many folks were having their assess kicked by the economy and manifest destiny. The game is about these people, specifically travellers and nomads who wander the country in search of answers. Migrant workers, preachers, poets, folk healers, Dustbowl refugees, and even men with wolf’s heads make up this cast, and it’s your job to meet these strangers and collect their stories.

                              <span>Dave the Diver (character) is a bit out of practice, but he&#x27;s an easygoing sort and it doesn&#x27;t take much to convince him to get back in his flippers to look into the local anomaly at the behest of his arms dealer &quot;friend&quot;, who would be clearly bad news even if his name wasn&#x27;t Cobra.
Said anomaly fills with new sea creatures from all over the world every time it&#x27;s visited, and possibly building-sized terror beasts and ancient merfolk, but Cobra&#x27;s sure it&#x27;ll all be fine, so in you go, mate. It&#x27;s certainly pretty down there if nothing else, and Dave the Diver (game) is, if nothing else, a rare game that makes the usually tedious water level a bit of a treat to wander round in.

                              <span>Obviously, I wouldn’t be here if I didn’t believe in the pleasurable side of PC hardware. Building a PC (or even just swapping out a component) can be a series of lovely little tactile moments: the peeling-off of plastic wrapping, the K’nex-like click of a graphics card slotting into place, the soft whoosh of the fans on a first successful boot. Great stuff, and of course, that’s all before games start coming out of it. What’s not to like?
Oh, reader, so many things. So many, many things not to like. Gaming PCs are still only computers, after all, and computers break, often and for reasons that may be invisible to the most intensively trained eye. Introduce this volatility to a line of work that involves handling a lot of sometimes heavy, usually expensive equipment, and enjoying those little pleasures will eventually come at a cost. Namely, time spent dealing with arcane troubleshooting practices and the occasional spot of minor personal injury.

Until now, thanks to a Special Edition mod that slows down time when arrows are flying towards your mightily voiced fantasy warrior. Enabling the Projectile Sense – Incoming Arrow &amp; Magic Slows Time mod should give you just enough advance warning to hotfoot it out of the path of any pointy ended sticks that have been loosed and are heading your way.

And I was like, &quot;Sure!&quot; and toddled off to have a look. I was delighted! But I think Katharine was anticipating it would arouse a different emotional response in me to what it actually did, because she used the word &quot;horrifying&quot;.

                              <span>Harvestella is a JRPG. This may seem like an incredibly obvious thing to say about a role-playing game from Square-Enix, but it’s the most important thing to know going in. Billed as a life sim RPG, and with a title that evokes farming, you could be forgiven for expecting something along the lines of Harvest Moon or Stardew Valley, but with more monster biffing. Instead, Harvestella sits firmly in the epic quest camp, with your adventuring being supported by your rural activities.
Anyone looking to build a pastoral paradise is going to be sorely disappointed, as the farming elements are somewhat rudimentary. Even calling your property a farm is a bit of a stretch. Even after a few upgrades, my plot is more of a large garden, maybe an allotment, if I’m being generous.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been eagerly anticipating Pepper Grinder since I saw a series of tweets with GIFs several years ago. It&#x27;s a pixel platformer in which the protagonist, Pepper, has a drill which she uses to plow through scenery, and a grappling hook for all the moments when she&#x27;s not underground. It&#x27;s now been officially announced with Devolver as publisher and there&#x27;s a reveal trailer below.

                              <span>It&#x27;s easy to place Dark Souls 2 in your crosshairs and take aim at its differences. Its map doesn&#x27;t intertwine like Dark Souls 1 or 3. Lots of bosses do that thing where they summon in some mates and it&#x27;s quite annoying. The atmosphere lacked that magic glaze. And yet, its quirks and frustrations make it one of my favourites.

                              <span>I toyed around with this intro a lot, because I didn’t want to start with a super pessimistic bang. But, for lack of a nicer way to put it, I’ll simply say things are looking pretty scary out there, huh? Capitalism is failing, the economy is crumbling, and normal people have nothing left to give. It’s something I&#x27;ve been thinking about a lot lately, but I don’t really talk about it. I keep it all inside, like a microwave holding a ball of tin foil while it spins on full power.
At least, that was the case until I played Citizen Sleeper. It’s a rather simple RPG inspired by tabletop roleplaying games, giving you a limited number of action dice that you can spend each day to receive consequences. Mechanically, it doesn’t stretch much further than those actions and consequences, meaning I can instead focus on connecting with characters. In its simplicity, I found a cathartic way to process my thoughts on lots of scary stuff happening in our actual world. I also realised that Starfield, the big space game looming on the horizon which I was previously pretty excited about, just doesn’t seem appealing anymore.

                              <span>Lunistice is a 3D platformer inspired by the PSX/Sega Saturn era, but its high-speed movement reminds me of Sonic’s 3D adventures, in a good way. Out today on PC and Switch, it was originally developed by solo dev A Grumpy Fox as a small 30-day project, but it quickly ballooned into something larger. It&#x27;s now been over a year since A Grumpy Fox first started work on the game, but I think you can agree from the announcement trailer below, it&#x27;s been time well spent.

                              <span>You know who&#x27;s cool? You, obviously, for listening to the Electronic Wireless Show podcast. This week we&#x27;re talking about games that make us feel like proper cool people, just like you - who, I emphasise again, are a very cool person. Matthew is not cool enough to be here this week, but I am joined by Nate, who is the king of cool (and crabs).
There&#x27;s a Cavern Of Lies to test Nate&#x27;s coolness, and we check in with Henry &quot;The Vit&quot; Cavill, but first, of course, we must litigate the different kinds of cool we feel, what counts as cool, and which games make us feel the coolest.

Players have forged remakes of classic Halo maps and entirely new designs that give us a peek at what’s possible in the engine. If you’re unfamiliar, Forge is a long-time Halo feature that allows players to create and edit their own maps and modes, leading to some of the most fun experiences in the franchise. Let’s take a look at the community’s creativity.

All three games will take place in Earthlock’s fantasy universe, starting with Ikonei Island: An Earthlock Adventure, a crafting spin-off that&#x27;s currently in early access. Jagex will also support the existing Earthlock along with development of the previously announced sequel, Earthlock 2.

                              <span>I’m of the strong and perhaps completely nonsensical opinion that any game is better when it’s set on an island. School me in the comments, please do, but I suspect that Escape Academy: Escape From Anti-Escape Island, new DLC launching for the puzzle game today, might lend my claim some extra weight. That could always be the baggage plummeting from the sky over Anti-Escape Island though, where a summer vacation for the students of Escape Academy has gone very, very wrong. Check out the trailer below.

Chief among them was Storyteller, a narrative-puzzle game we first saw ten years ago, and has now confirmed a release date of March 23rd. The game’s comic-strip puzzles let you remix classic stories, like Dracula, using various props, verbs and nouns. A game for all the literary nerds out there.

Still, it’s one to take with a pinch of salt, which probably wards off the undead too. There’s been no word from devs Arkane on whether rumblings of a Redfall beta are legit yet, but The Game Awards are only a few weeks away so we might see something announced there.

                              <span>Dragon Age: Absolution is coming to Netflix on December 9. A new trailer provides a deeper look into the adult animated series&#x27; premise and new heroes. 
The story centers on Miriam, an elven mercenary and former slave tasked with stealing a powerful and dangerous artifact. When the heist goes awry, the situation escalates into a larger fight for survival for Miriam and her friends. Set in Tevinter, the show features an original cast of heroes and, potentially, some old favorites (the characters at 0:45 look a lot like Cassandra and Leliana). Check out the trailer below. 


First announced during Netflix Geeked Week in June, Dragon Age: Absolution’s cast includes Kimberly Brooks (Miriam), Matthew Mercer (Fairbanks), Ashly Burch (Qwydion), Phil Lamarr (Roland), and Josh Keaton (Rezaren). The series consists of six 30-minute episodes. 
Though steeped in Dragon Age lore, it remains to be seen if the show has any connection to the upcoming Dragon Age: Dreadwolf. Absolution is far from the only video game adaptation Netflix has in the works. The CG-animated Sonic Prime also premieres in December. The streaming giant also announced a live-action Gears of War movie and its own animated series.</span>

Beyond our coverage of Street Fighter 6 in the latest issue of Game Informer, issue 351 also includes a deep dive into Tchia, and the unusual trip where we learned more about the game.  
Tchia is created by the development studio known as Awaceb. Awaceb’s founders grew up in a small French territory east of Australia called New Caledonia, and this debut game from the studio is inspired by their childhood there. I visited New Caledonia in September, and joined the team from Awaceb to learn more about the culture, peoples, and geography that make it such a memorable place.  
Check out the new issue to discover more about the trip and the game.
Our video below features a small part of the lovely Tchia soundtrack alongside glimpses of video taken during the trip, as well as gameplay footage of Tchia.  


Tchia is set to release in early 2023 on PS5, PS4, and PC.

                              <span>We recently traveled to Osaka, Japan, for our Street Fighter 6 cover story. While we were in the city, Game Informer video editor Alex Van Aken and I thought it would be a great idea to take advantage of our proximity to Universal Studios Japan to visit Super Nintendo World. Like you, we saw the tour provided by the legendary Shigeru Miyamoto, but we needed to see it for ourselves. And to be quite frank, we are so glad that we did.
It&#x27;s impossible to fully convey how cool most of our time at Super Nintendo World was. From the moment we exited the giant warp pipe at the entrance, we felt transported into an actual Mario game. Check out the photos from our time at Super Nintendo World to get a sense of how incredible the experience is.
First, we had to reserve a time to enter that particular…</span>

                              <span>With Stadia’s impending shutdown in January, Google has begun fulfilling its promise of issuing refunds to its customers. The process started yesterday, and Google has posted an FAQ breaking down how it works. 
As previously announced, Google is refunding all software purchases through the Stadia Store (such as games, DLC, in-game currency, and current pre-orders) and hardware purchases made through the Google Store; physical store purchases cannot be refunded. Eligible hardware includes:
Stadia Controller
Founder&#x27;s Edition
Premiere Edition
Play and Watch with Google TV packages
Stadia Pro subscriptions will not be refunded, but members can play their Pro titles until the shutdown. However, those who purchased a subscription on or after September 29, 2022, and were charged for it will have that money returned. 
Refunds will be issued to the form of payment used to make the purchase. If that account is no longer available, Google will send an email with instructions for setting up an alternative method of receiving the refund.
Users may have already received an email notifying them of their refund status. Although payments are now being issued, that doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll get yours today or this week. This will be a gradual rollout that will continue up until January 18. There&#x27;s no way of knowing when you&#x27;ll receive your refund, so eligible users should keep an eye on their inbox and bank account over the coming days or weeks.</span>

The verdict comes after the court previously denied a broad injunction that required hosting and CDN providers to take action as well.

                              <span>IBM včera představilo 433qubitový kvantový počítač Osprey (orlovec říční). Je třikrát větší, než Eagle (orel) z loňského roku. Zvětšena také byla rychlost elektrických signálů CLOPS (Circuit Layer Operations Per Second) na 15 kCLOPS. Loňský model měl jen 1,4 kCLOPS.</span>

Ken Masters, one of the two original playable Street Fighter characters, steps back into the spotlight with an all-new backstory. As soon as his new look was unveiled, the Street Fighter community had a field day pondering what happened to put Ken in the rough state he appeared, with memes popping up deeming him &quot;Hobo Ken.&quot; While at Capcom&#x27;s headquarters in Osaka, Japan, we spoke with Street Fighter 6 director Takayuki Nakayama and art director Kaname Fujioka to get more details abou…</span>

                              <span>Eric Williams has been working on God of War since the first game, and his credits extend beyond Kratos&#x27; journey to titles like Darksiders and Insomniac&#x27;s Spider-Man, but he will always consider Sony Santa Monica home. For God of War Ragnarök, Williams put a pause on his video game consulting business to take on the director role for the highly anticipated sequel. We spoke with Williams about why God of War 2018&#x27;s director, Cory Barlog, had to convince him to take on the role, why nearly every God of War game has a new director, how he discovered he is not able to generate visuals in his mind&#x27;s eye, how the surprising casting of Richard Schiff as Odin came about, and plenty more.

                              <span>After a lengthy Street Fighter 6 hands-on session and a few interviews at Capcom&#x27;s headquarters in Osaka, Japan, I am in the back room of a small sandwich shop overlooking the Higashiyokobori River. As I eat my sandwich, I make conversation with Street Fighter 6 director Takayuki Nakayama, who is seated next to me, enjoying his own sandwich. After touching on topics of our respective histories with Street Fighter and other games we&#x27;ve been playing, he asks if I&#x27;ve enjoyed what I&#x27;ve played of Street Fighter 6 to this point.
I let him know the gameplay and art style are terrific and that I feel the Real-Time Commentary feature is a revolutionary addition to the fighting genre. The director nods along with a smile until I mention how I don&#x27;t feel the Modern Controls (which simplify the overal…</span>

That&#x27;s right: Our next issue proudly features Street Fighter 6 on the cover. The cover art, created by designer Goro Tokuda, features one of the original World Warriors, Ken, sporting his new look. Everyone (Capcom included) has seen your memes about Ken&#x27;s rougher appearance in this game, but we traveled to the studio in Osaka, Japan, to learn more about what&#x27;s happening with one of the franchise&#x27;s most iconic characters.
While there, we went hands-on with the game, had extensive conversations with the developers, chatted about the lessons the team took from Street Fighter V&#x27;s disappointing launch, and even learned about a new way to play Street Fig…</span>

This new look at Pokémon Scarlet and Violet was mostly focused on Ed Sheeran’s new Pokémon single “Celestial,” but it also included a few Big Nuggets of information we learned for the first time. The most significant reveal is a glimpse at two new creatures, called Great Tusk and Iron Treads. At first glance, they look a lot like Donphan (a Pokémon that has been confirmed for the new games), but it’s unclear how they’re related. They could be new regional forms, evolutions, or something entirely new.
The trailer also showed a sneak peek at the Scarlet Book and Violet Book, two tomes detailed further on Pokémon’s official website. They’re records from an old expedition and have notes and drawings of old Pokémon, including the new Donphan-esque creatures reve…</span>

                              <span>Sonic Frontiers is available now, marking a new era for the iconic Sonic the Hedgehog franchise. While much of the 3D action remains intact through Sonic Frontiers, the arena in which much of that action takes place is a massive departure. The open-zone setup gives players large areas in which to run, fight, and explore, but the game also presents players with linear Cyber Space stages that veer much closer to the action levels players are used to. With so much to do in Sonic Frontiers (I spent more than 30 hours clearing as much as I could off the map), I wanted to give players some tips to help them squeeze the most fun out of the Blue Blur&#x27;s enjoyment.

To try and develop some context, we spoke with the game&#x27;s director, Ebb Software&#x27;s Ljubomir Peklar, via e-mail to try and get some more insight into the bizarre experience. Unsurprisingly, much is meant to be left to the players&#x27; imagination, but Peklar did offer some details, like how it managed to create something so abstract, some of the incidental imagery that occurred, and the best movie from the Aliens franchise.
Game Informer: What happened in Scorn?
Peklar: Whatever you understood happened.
Was the ending in the game always the planned ending?

                              <span>The first Gear of War game was released 16 years ago today, and Netflix is celebrating by announcing plans to adapt the series into both a live-action film and an adult animated series. 
The streaming giant revealed the news in a tweet that&#x27;s light on details but states it&#x27;s partnering with Gears developer The Coalition. Based on the tweet&#x27;s wording, it sounds like the animated show will come after the movie&#x27;s release. It may not stop there, as Netflix also says there&#x27;s “potential for more stories to follow!”

The last NFL Blitz was released on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade in January 2012. Even then, it was considered a retro revival title developed by Madden studio EA Tiburon. Before that, we hadn&#x27;t received a proper NFL-licensed Blitz title since Midway&#x27;s NFL Blitz 20-03 on PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube, and Game Boy Advance. Despite EA Sports acquiring the license from Midway during its 2009 liquidation, the NFL has largely seemed averse to the hard-hitting arcade-style gameplay of the Blitz series.
In August, Arcade1Up, the company behind various arcade replicas, including other Midway classics like NBA Jam and Mortal Kombat, announced the franchise&#x27;s return through NFL Blitz Le…</span>

In Sonic Frontiers, Sega finds the intersection of the series’ linear past and its “open-zone” future, paying capable service to both eras of the franchise. The open Starfall Islands offer engaging exploration, while linear Cyber Space stages deliver the familiar speed-based Sonic experience. Though each side of the coin has faults, Frontiers is an overall positive experience that serves as a boost in the right direction for the franchise.
Running through the open zones is often a joyful experience. …</span>

                              <span>Escapism increases with yet another ScummVM release!
The ScummVM Team is thrilled to announce the immediate availability of ScummVM 2.6.1.
ScummVM 2.6.1 is a maintenance release mainly focused on improving the new features and engines we introduced in our previous release.
This update includes upgrades for the following engines:
AGS
AGOS
Asylum
Ultima
SCI
SCUMM
Tinsel
Toltecs
Toon
Other improvements include upgrading the icon-based grid view in the ScummVM launcher and fixing OpenGL render graphic corruptions.
Finally, Android users will be able to properly use a mouse on virtual screens, and Windows users will not have any duplicated icons folder issues.
You can find all of this goodness available for a number of platforms on our downloads page. If you are using Windows, macOS, the Ubuntu Snap package or the FlatHub repository, the auto-update robots will assist you in updating to ScummVM 2.6.1.
As always, the detailed list of improvements is available here.
Thank you for your continuous support — happy adventuring!

Luckily, I can offer you the first testing release of the 13.X release series. We collected whatever we could find on the cutting room floor to get you a Halloween release. Some of the higlights of this release include: Build NewGRF objects over an era with click-and-drag. Wider rivers on map generation. Improved handling of HiDPI and mixed-DPI screens. Some more GUI improvements like a cleaned up finance window. Many bug-fixes (over 50 of them), tweaks, changes, and other additions. (As ever, see the changelog for further details). The usual titlegame competition has been announced on the forums. See the page for the exact competition rules if you are interested. Download Changelog Bug tracker</span>
