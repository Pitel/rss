                    <span>Hot on the heels of yesterday’s news that Sony is acquiring Bungie, the studio has released a new Destiny 2: The Witch Queen trailer that’s all about the gear and weapons coming with the new expansion. 
With The Witch Queen, Destiny 2’s latest expansion launching Feburary 22, it’s not surprising that Bungie is ramping up its marketing for it. After a trailer a couple of weeks ago all about Savathun’s Throne World, today, the studio opted to reveal some of the weapons our Guardians will be using later this month.

As you can see in the trailer above, there are a handful of exotic weapons coming to the game, starting with the Grand Overture, a Slug Launcher that charges full auto missiles. There’s also the new Parasite weapon, which is a worm launcher wit…</span>

                    <span>If you consider yourself a diehard Pokémon fan, odds are you already own at least one replica Poké Ball. But there’s no such thing has having too many of them, right? The Pokémon Company and prop replica makers The Wand Company hope you agree because they&#x27;re introducing a new line of premium Poké Balls throughout 2022. 
The Wand Company has previously manufactured upscale replicas of the Poké Ball, Great Ball, Ultra Ball, Dusk Ball, and Premier Ball. This upcoming batch will feature four new balls starting with the Heal Ball. This to-scale replica measures 3.5 x 3.7 x 3.5 in diameter and is made of a die-cast metal shell with a high-gloss lacquer finish. Its coolest feature is its touch/proximity sensor that causes the front button to light up when someone is nearby, and pressing the button triggers the light sequence that occurs when Pokémon are caught. The Heal Ball comes with a matte black display case where it can sit atop a stainless steel display ring. It also includes a manual and three AAA batteries.

If you like what you see, you can pre-order it now from The Pokémon Center store for $99.99. Shipping begins in early April. Replicas of the Friend Ball, Quick Ball and Cherish Ball will launch during the year but have no release dates as of yet.

                    <span>Supermassive Games began its anthology horror series, The Dark Pictures, in 2019 with Man of Medan, and since then, it’s released a new entry every year. Little Hope was released in 2020, and last year, the studio put out House of Ashes. 
The Devil In Me is up to bat next, and that game will serve as the season finale of The Dark Pictures’ first season. The fifth game in the series, Switchback, was semi-revealed through a trademark filing by Supermassive Games. Now, the next five games have been revealed in the same manner. 
What’s interesting is that Supermassive Games has long referred to The Dark Pictures as an eight-game series. These five new trademarks bring the total up to 10. Perhaps Season 2 is a six-game season, or perhaps, a third season is in the works. Only Supermassive Games knows. For now, we have a pretty good idea of what the next five games after Switchback will be, thanks to a new trademark filing spotted by Twitter user The Marmolade, as reported by Gematsu:
The Dark Pictures: Directive 8020
The Dark Pictures: The Craven Man
The Dark Pictures: Intercession
The Dark Pictures: Winterfold
The Dark Pictures: O Death
And here’s a slideshow featuring images of each trademarked logo:

For most of these, it’s tough to piece together exactly what the game is about, which makes sense considering all we know is the possible names. However, some are easier than others. For example, Directive 8020 seems to hint towards a futuristic sci-fi horror game. The Craven Man might be similar to The Wicker Man, or maybe even Jeepers Creepers. 
It might be a while before we learn what each is, so in the meantime, check out our thoughts on the series thus far in Game Informer’s Man of Medan review, Little Hope review, and House of Ashes review.

                    <span>It’s time for the payoff. For years, Bungie has teased the potential of Destiny’s most devious villain. In recent months, that tease has escalated. The Hive queen named Savathûn has infiltrated all the major storylines, insinuating herself into the events shaping the story. Now, at long last, the Witch Queen’s trap is sprung, as she co-opts humanity’s most precious resource – the Light that gives power to its Guardians – and uses that power to make deathless warriors of her own. 
With The Witch Queen, Bungie is betting big on a narrative twist that’s been in the making for a long time and using that storytelling moment to push forward new twists on the long-established gameplay model, including a dramatic move toward playstyle customization for players. On the eve of the expansion’s releas…</span>

                    <span>Titan Comics just revealed the cover of a forthcoming Bloodborne comic book that will be released on May 7 for absolutely free. As comic book fans know, the first Saturday in May is Free Comic Book Day. All of the major publishers in the industry are giving away free comic books on this day, and you should be able to walk out of your local shop with a stack of things to read.
This free comic is the first part of a new Bloodborne limited series that will also launch in May. Titan Comics&#x27; official description doesn&#x27;t give us much of a hint of what we can expect from this series: &quot;Enter the city of Yharnam through the eyes of its citizens, when new hunters take to the streets to fight against the cruel and unusual epidemic that has gripped the city. In the black of night, families and faith will be tested.&quot;
This isn&#x27;t Titan&#x27;s first Bloodborne series. The publisher just this month released a box set collecting all of its limited Bloodborne comics. From Software, the developer of the Bloodborne game, is weeks away from releasing its next Souls-like game, Elden Ring. The game is on this month&#x27;s cover of Game Informer Magazine. This coverage extends online where we have nearly a dozen stories or looks at the game. Once this game releases and people see the credits roll, the drumbeat of wanting Bloodborne 2 will likely begin again.

                    <span>If you&#x27;ve been following Battlefield 2042 since its launch back in November, then you likely know that Dice is facing an uphill battle when it comes to improving the game. It launched with bugs galore – something touched on in the Game Informer Battlefield 2042 review – and post-launch updates and patches have been focused almost exclusively on squashing them and fixing other issues. 
Through all of it, Dice has recognized the shortfalls of 2042, promising to get the game up to shape and meet fan expectations for EA&#x27;s latest FPS. To do that, Dice is delaying the game&#x27;s first season.

                    <span>On this week&#x27;s From Panel to Podcast, we breakdown what we want from WB Games Montréal&#x27;s Gotham Knights, the successor to the beloved Batman Arkham series. With Batman supposedly dead at the outset of play, the Bat-family has a lot of weight on their shoulders to deliver a superhero experience that can live up to his legacy. We discuss the tone we want to see, gameplay direction, and also who should show up as villains.
For the comic readers out there, we go deep into two red-hot series: Something is Killing the Children and Saga. Yes, Saga is finally back after a three year break! We also talk about our favorite books from last week&#x27;s new releases rack, and highlight the books we hope to pick up this Wednesday.

                    <span>Potatomon Legumes: Artichoke.
&quot;It’s Pokémon, but not as you know it&quot; seems to be the tagline for Pokémon Legends: Arceus, which is a pretty good way of summing up our thoughts on it, too. But The Pokémon Company&#x27;s latest advert for the game, which is based on the idea that it&#x27;s new and different, is a little... strange.
A Muppet-like puppet of Munchlax is shown causing trouble on a cooking reality show by stealing potatoes and throwing vegetables everywhere, much to the annoyance of the head chef.

                    <span>I hear the Goron drums echoing tonight.
The best karaoke song of all time and the best Zelda game of all time have finally been united in this mashup, in which Bigfatfrown plays the entirety of Toto&#x27;s 1982 hit Africa on the Majora&#x27;s Mask instruments. Perhaps the original arrangement of the song was not entirely intended for a set of bongos, an electric guitar, an ocarina and whatever the hell Deku Pipes are, but it sounds bangin&#x27; nonetheless.
Now, if you&#x27;ll excuse us, we&#x27;ve got a karaoke booth to get to, and some lyrics to rewrite. I bless the stoooorms down in Ikanaaaaa...

Broken Rules is a development studio that has produced a number of intriguing games, quite a few of which have been on Nintendo platforms - it&#x27;s probably best known among Switch gamers for Old Man&#x27;s Journey. The studio has now confirmed its next release, Gibbon: Beyond the Trees, which will debut on Apple Arcade on 25th February before arriving on Switch and PC later this year.
It looks rather interesting, blending momentum-based gameplay with serious messages around deforestation and climate change. Some official details are below:

Not so long ago, we reported on the news that former Rare staffers Kev Bayliss and David Wise had formed &#x27;Salmandos&#x27;, an &quot;exciting new project&quot; that celebrates their careers in the industry. As part of this, the pair have created DK Creations, a YouTube channel that sees them sharing their secrets and generally looking back on some of the amazing games they&#x27;ve worked on.
If you haven&#x27;t checked out the channel already, you&#x27;re in for a bit of a treat. Bayliss – who worked on titles such as Killer Instinct and Donkey Kong Country during his time at Rare and now plies his trade at Playtonic Games – has not only been sharing drawing tutorials but also videos where he plays (and chats about) classic titles he&#x27;s worked on. He&#x27;s done the NES games Cobra Triangle, Anticipation, Hollywood Squares and California Games so far.

                    <span>Monopoly isn&#x27;t just for fun when it&#x27;s real money.
Back in September 2020 when Microsoft announced its acquisition of Bethesda for around $7.5 billion, it was a big move — one that some fans would have been excited by, and others less so. It was a huge deal at the time, with that purchase giving Microsoft Gaming / Xbox a number of new studios and creative teams, not to mention an influx of seminal gaming properties such as DOOM, The Elder Scrolls, and Fallout. The recent Activision Blizzard agreement — which is a long way from being finalised due to regulatory processes — felt like something different, however. The sheer sum of money involved ($68.7 billion), and the size of the company being acquired arguably represents a shift in policy. Microsoft isn&#x27;t aiming to just boost its Xbox offering, it seems intent to dominate with it while also notionally growing into &#x27;metaverse&#x27;, which is a conversation for another day.
Now we&#x27;ve had Sony acquire Bungie, the creator of the Halo series (though it departed the franchise years ago) and well known for its Destiny games and expansions. It&#x27;s another big sum, at $3.6 billion a little under half of what Microsoft paid for Bethesda. PlayStation CEO Jim Ryan has also made clear that the acquisitions aren&#x27;t finished yet.

Pokémon Legends: Arceus has scored the best debut of any Pokémon title, according to the boffins at Gamesight.
The firm compared the first 72 hours of engagement with similar timeframes for each of the series&#x27; recent launches, finding that Arceus &quot;significantly outpaced&quot; the debuts of Pokémon Sword &amp; Shield, Pokémon Let&#x27;s Go Pikachu &amp; Eevee!, and Pokémon Brilliant Diamond &amp; Shining Pearl.

The INDIE Live Expo has become another consistent part of the online streaming scene, especially for those passionate about smaller download-only games. Typically with a major Summer and Winter stream each year, it&#x27;s also been characterised by the sheer length of the streams (6 hours+) and often including a significant number of reveals.
One issue is that large parts of the show can focus on existing titles, which isn&#x27;t necessarily what everyone tunes in to see. The organisers seem to be reacting to that and expanding this year, confirming that the event will run online over two days on 21st and 22nd May.

It&#x27;s quite a mix, including some chill-out games and some more intense options, and also a blend of relatively high profile releases and some that may have passed you by.

The Nintendo Switch has proven to be a hit with gamers thanks to the fact that it can be played both on your TV and in portable mode, but despite this unique selling point, there&#x27;s still a market for super-slim mobile monitors that allow you to experience the big-screen effect while you&#x27;re on the move.
One of the biggest issues of using such a screen, however, is that you still need to hook up the Switch dock – and most of the monitors on the market also require their own power supply, which rather limits their usefulness. Carting around all those wires can be a drag, and you need to remain close to a wall socket at all times. When there&#x27;s that much fuss involved, most people will just settle for using the Switch&#x27;s built-in 720p display, which is far more convenient.

Cards for series one through four are available at the time of writing, and the store has also added the Series 5 Collector&#x27;s Album for good measure. These will undoubtedly sell out super fast, so get in there while you can.

                    <span>NFTs are branded a &quot;grift&quot;.
A host of Team17&#x27;s development partners have spoken out against the publisher&#x27;s plans to launch a series of NFTs based on its popular Worms franchise.
Going Under developer Aggro Crab Games has made the strongest statement, and has said that it will not be working with publisher Team17 on future titles following the news.

Luma is a new GBA puzzle title that&#x27;s coming out this year – and if you purchase a copy, you&#x27;ll be bringing a little bit of light to this dark and uncertain world.
How? Well, Mark Watkin, who has ported the C64 original to the GBA, is donating a portion of the sales to the Mid Cheshire Food Bank:

                    <span>With a retro theme, naturally.
Limited Run Games is a very familiar brand, one that has positioned itself at the top of the &#x27;limited edition&#x27; market for physical games (including many for Switch). What started out as an online store focused on limited run editions of previously download-only games has grown and morphed into a far bigger business.
It&#x27;s also a company happy to be subversive and surprising - as anyone who watched its E3 2021 show would conclude - and is now moving into opening an in-person store in North Carolina, US. More specifically it&#x27;s putting together a store in the MacGregor Village shopping center in Cary, with a goal of opening in April. It&#x27;ll have a retro theme and will apparently be 75% focused on LRG products, with 25% of space for third-party products. It&#x27;ll also have a trading card area and a section for trading and buying second-hand games.

The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time has aged gracefully enough (we think), but what would it look like running on a modern game engine - say something like Unreal Engine 5?
If you haven&#x27;t already seen RwanLink&#x27;s previous video - showcasing a stunning recreation of Kakariko Village at the end of last year, the self-taught artist Unreal artist has now released a &quot;next gen&quot; look at Lake Hylia running on the same engine.

As you&#x27;ve probably heard by now, Sony is acquiring the Destiny and former Halo studio Bungie for $3.6 billion. This surprise news comes just weeks after Microsoft announced it would acquire Activision Blizzard for close to $70 billion.
What else can we expect in the near future then? Even on the Nintendo front, it might be best to brace yourself for what&#x27;s to come - with Sony Interactive Entertainment boss Jim Ryan informing our friends over at GamesIndustry.biz to &quot;expect more&quot; in terms of PlayStation acquisitions.

With this in mind, the timeless classic is now 25 years old. To celebrate, the Japanese publisher and developer has revealed two brand new anniversary logos for the title. It includes artwork from Tetsuya Nomura - an artist on the original &#x27;97 PlayStation release.

                    <span>Even with the pandemic still ongoing, there were plenty of exciting Linux software advancements and new hardware that made for an exciting January. Here is a look at the past from our Linux / open-source perspective...</span>

                    <span>There&#x27;s no two ways about it: I&#x27;m a big old card-carrying Life Is Strange nerd. Seriously, I own some geeky merch to demonstrate my love for this series; up to and including, yes, the official Life Is Strange deck of playing cards. In other words, I am exactly the sort of fan the Life Is Strange: Remastered Collection is geared towards; so you may be surprised when I say that I&#x27;m not planning on picking it up anytime soon.
I&#x27;ll be honest, I&#x27;ve been wary of the remasters of the first Life Is Strange title and its prequel Before The Storm ever since the first stills were released. &quot;Look how much emotion their faces show now!&quot; was the boast, splashed across side-by-side images of Rachel frowning in the original vs Rachel smiling in the remaster, Chloe frowning in the original vs Chloe smiling in the remaster, Max smiling slightly in the original vs Max grinning widely in the remaster... perhaps you begin to see my issue.

                    <span>Hi, nice to meet you. Can I get you anything? A drink, a bite to eat, an acquisition maybe? There are apparently a lot of them to go around, after all. Hear that? It&#x27;s Sony buying Bungie. It&#x27;s Microsoft buying Activision Blizzard. It&#x27;s Tencent accidentally dropping £365 billion down a grate as they stroll down the street and unknowingly buy the Earth&#x27;s crust. They were on the phone to me at the time, putting an offer on my flat. I am tired of these big companies buying everything. Can we just slow down for a hot second and chill out a bit, please?

                    <span>Oh, this is classic Kingston. I don’t think any other SSD manufacturer so consistently goes quiet for months on end, then suddenly rocks up at your house, slams a world-beating NVMe drive on your desk and wordlessly disappears again. It happened with the A2000, it happened with the KC2500 and now it’s happened with the Fury Renegade.

                    <span>I keep trying to figure out how to describe The Waylanders’ unique blend of endearment and jank. Unfortunately I am cursed with chronic writer’s brain so all I can come up with is this: it feels like a really good first draft.


For every aspect of worldbuilding that I enjoyed, there was a bug that had to be overlooked. For every character that I found charming, there was some voiceover that was jarring. For every area that was absolutely gorgeous there was a part of the script that made me extremely grateful for having editors on all my writing. Over and over, I found these flaws didn’t stop me from enjoying the core that I could see underneath. At least, until the game (as far as I can tell) bugged so badly that I literally couldn’t continue.

                    <span>World Update 7 has landed in Microsoft Flight Simulator, continuing efforts to fancy up the globe with more-detailed terrain and handcrafted models for landmarks. This time Australia gets the polish, with scanned photogrammetry replacements for 11 cities, handcrafted models for 94 landmarks and points of interest, and new local missions. It looks pretty! Check out the trailer below.

                    <span>I often find myself intrigued by games where you have to manage a business - not the slow, thoughtful ones like Strange Horticulture (which I like for a different reason), but the surprisingly deep management ones that are like strategy games except for coffee production instead of war.
I am usually catastrophically bad at these games, as I lack the sheer nerve to commit all my assets to something at once, or take out loans to cover a product run, even in a fictional digital setting. Still, I was drawn to Startup Panic like a moth to a flame, and giggled to myself at the prospect of cosplaying as a Silicon Valley nerd trying to reinvent having a chicken coop. I called my founder Beth, and the company was therefore Betherium. But it turned out that the product I was tasked with making and selling was, basically, Facebook.

                    <span>Oh sure, Sony buying Bungie was big buyout business news yesterday, but the real mega-acquisition of the day was Wordle. The New York Times, a hardcopy blog, are buying the viral hit word puzzle game for &quot;an undisclosed price in the low-seven figures.&quot; They say it will be free when it moves under their banner, though it&#x27;s not clear if it will stay that way.

Změny jsou i v nastavení priority úloh, kdy Shotcut umí lépe pracovat s procesory Alder Lake s jejich hybridní architekturou zahrnující i úsporná „Atomová“ E-jádra.

                    <span>Evil Dead: The Game is no stranger to delays. The asymmetrical multiplayer title based on the cult horror franchise was originally scheduled for 2021. Then it got delayed to an unspecified February 2022 date. It has now been pushed back once again, though this time it has a concrete release date: May (Friday) 13. 
The game, developed by Saber Interactive, simply needs more time to come properly come together according to a message from the game’s official Twitter. The team does promise a new trailer to premiere in February.

Evil Dead: The Game was first revealed during The Game Awards 2020 and pits a team of players, taking on the role of Ash and other beloved characters, against a human-controlled monster. Last August, Saber announced a single-player mode for the game as well. Narratively, it features an amalgamation of elements from every mainline Evil Dead film (sans the 2013 reboot) and the Ash vs The Evil Dead TV series. 
Evil Dead: The Game is launching on PlayStation/Xbox consoles, Switch, and PC.</span>

                    <span>It is important to keep in mind what is going on within Activision Blizzard at this time regarding ongoing allegations about the work culture. The ongoing lawsuit from the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) against the company is over reported toxic workplace culture. The bulk of the suit focuses on &quot;violations of the state&#x27;s civil rights and equal pay laws,&quot; specifically regarding the treatment of women and other marginalized groups. To learn more about the proceedings thus far, including details listed in the lawsuit against Activision Blizzard, please check out our previous coverage here.

                    <span>Announced back in May of last year, Sony and Discord formed a partnership to bring the PlayStation and Discord ecosystems together. Today, we&#x27;re finally seeing some movement in bringing Discord integration to Sony&#x27;s consoles, or rather the other way around. 
As of today, you can now link your PlayStation account to your Discord ID. This lets your friends or other server mutuals see when and what you&#x27;re playing on PS5 or PS4. The service works like any others, such as Steam, Blizzard, Xbox, Spotify, etc. The setup is the same as well.
Here&#x27;s how Discord says to connect a PlayStation account:
&quot;To connect your Discord account to your PlayStation Network account, open up Discord and head into User Settings &gt; Connections on either desktop or web. On mobile, go to User Settings &gt; Connections.&quot; From there, you&#x27;ll enter your login information for your PlayStation account. Pretty easy. It also notes that you can toggle whether anyone can see your PlayStation status in case you need to keep something hidden for whatever reason.
The PlayStation functionality works on any platform Discord is on, so give it a go if you play on Sony&#x27;s consoles. Unfortunately, there wasn&#x27;t any update to the broader integration of the two, but this small step is a good start for now. 
In other Sony news today, the console maker picked up a huge studio with the acquisition of Destiny 2 developer Bungie. Read all about the big purchase and the future of Destiny here.</span>

The gaming IP arms race continued today as Sony bought vaunted developer Bungie for a whopping $3.6 billion. But what does that mean for Destiny fans and the industry at large? Join us on this discussion video as we talk about all of that and so much more.
Alex Stadnik is here with associate editor Jill Grodt and Magazine Content Director, and huge Bungie fan Matt Miller to break down today&#x27;s breaking news. We start by discussing the particulars of the deal as we know it now, including how Bungie is maintaining its independence. The studio has said that it still can self-publish and choose where its games can release. The studio&#x27;s blog post also outlined that the goal is to keep Destiny communities intact and not strip the game away from Xbox users now or in the future. 
While we may know the immediate plans for one of the biggest franchises in games, what about the future? Bungie is working on new projects, but will they be exclusive to PlayStation in the future? Bungie has said, in fact, &quot;We want the worlds we are creating to extend to anywhere people play games. We will continue to be self-published, creatively independent, and we will continue to drive one, unified Bungie community.&quot; Xbox fans can sleep soundly, at least tonight. 
We finally round out our video discussion by zooming out to the gaming landscape at large. This is the second impactful industry acquisition in the last month, but how will this change the landscape of games? Will this motivate the streaming giants also to start buying up IP? Is this good for the industry? We answer all those questions and more, and we hope you enjoy our talk.

                    <span>Shadow Warrior 3 has been a long-time coming for fans, but developer Flying Wild Hog finally confirmed the game is launching on March 1. A stylish (and self-aware) cinematic trailer celebrates the occasion in over-the-top fashion.
Hero Lo Wang returns and has some new traversal tricks up his sleeve such as a wall run, grapple hook, air dash, and double jump. You’ll still be slicing apart enemies with your katana or riddling them with bullets using a variety of firearms. He&#x27;ll need all the help he can get as he teams up with a powerful witch to slay a colossal dragon and hordes of demons.
Flying Wild Hog also announced a new voice cast consisting of Mike Moh (Lo Wang), Andromeda Dunker (Motoko), and SungWon Cho (Zilla). Alex Dobrenko reprises his role as Hoji. Shadow Warrior 3 was first announced in the summer of 2020 for a 2021 release, a window that obviously came and went. Fans have waited somewhat impatiently for an updated launch date, making this a good way to start the week.

Shadow Warrior 3 will be available on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Those who pre-order receive the exclusive Koromodako Katana in-game weapon. Purchasing early on consoles also rewards players with Shadow Warrior 1 and 2 for free.

                    <span>Hazelight Studios is looking to adapt its 2021 co-op romp It Takes Two to film or television thanks to a partnership with dj2 Entertainment. The news of this deal comes from an exclusive report from Variety. 
Outspoken Hazelight creative director Josef Fares sounds excited for the opportunity to bring It Takes Two to another medium. “Creating the world and story in ‘It Takes Two’ was so much fun for me and the team,” Fares said to Variety. “Since it has a strong narrative with many crazy characters and just as crazy co-op action moments, the potential is huge for a great adaption to film or television.” 
dj2 Entertainment is no stranger to producing adaptations of video games with 2020&#x27;s Sonic the Hedgehog movie and its sequel, the upcoming Tomb Raider anime series slated to be released on Netflix, and is attached to executive produce projects based on Disco Elysium and Life is Strange. dj2 CEO and founder Dmitri M. Johnson spoke to Variety about the potential project, saying, “dj2 is honored to partner with Josef, Oskar [Wolontis], and the incredible team at Hazelight Studios on the linear media adaptation of ‘It Takes Two.&#x27;” He continues, “Just like the rest of the gaming world, we fell head-over-heels in love with Cody, May, Rose, Dr. Hakim and the imaginative fantasy universe Hazelight have created, and can’t wait to bring these characters -and this world- to life on the big and small screen.”
According to Variety, the project doesn&#x27;t have any studios or networks attached as of yet. However, there does happen to be a &quot;multi-party bidding war&quot; ongoing for the rights to the It Takes Two adaptation. 
It Takes Two saw plenty of critical acclaim last year, and we here at Game Informer are quite fond of it ourselves! Check out our review of It Takes Two and why we ranked it number eight on our top 10 games of the year.</span>

The original Final Fantasy VII catapulted JRPGs into the limelight and established a new standard for expansive gameworlds and emotional stories. Final Fantasy VII Remake is an homage to and reimagining of its predecessor&#x27;s motifs: Eco-activism, classism, atonement, and companionship (among many other important themes). We demonstrate how Remake&#x27;s plot beats can be reevaluated with the themes of departure and reunion in mind.
Square Enix plans to tell Cloud’s extensive story in parts but, because the first entry solely focuses on Midgar, Final Fantasy VII veterans get to experience the original game’s introductory setting and characters in more nuanced ways. The high stakes remain the same: The fallout from the Mako Reactor 1 and 5 bombings, the eventual destruction of the slums, and Sephiroth’s sudden and terrifying return. Our video essay considers these emotional moments and looks to provide other interpretations surrounding Remake’s most important plot motivations.
There are many scenes that Square Enix will have to reveal and unpack in upcoming installments, but we’re excited to see what the future holds for Cloud and co. In other Final Fantasy VII news, today marks the 25th anniversary of the classic JRPG steampunk adventure. Apparently, there are &quot;even more new FFVII projects&quot; slated for the future.

                    <span>Sony Interactive Entertainment has announced it is purchasing Bungie for $3.6 Billion. That means the studio that created Halo and Destiny is coming under the PlayStation umbrella. Sony’s announcement caps off an acquisition-heavy January that saw Take-Two buy Zynga for $13 billion and Microsoft announce plans to acquire Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion. 
Bungie posted a blog post discussing the acquisition, saying that it will “continue to independently publish and creatively develop our games” and that SIE’s first, most immediate influence will be an acceleration in the studio’s hiring process. Bungie states that it’s staffing up for Destiny 2 as well as “all new worlds beyond&quot;, hinting at a new IP.

This news comes by way of a new interview with Inverse in which Anabuki said a sequel would be “even more mature.” He also said it would hone in on the “superpower” aspect of Scarlet Nexus, implementing these otherworldly powers into other elements of the game rather than just combat.

                    <span>One of 2021’s most eyebrow-raising stories was MLB The Show, the PlayStation published and exclusive series, launching on Xbox platforms, including Game Pass. If you thought seeing the PlayStation Studios logo appear on an Xbox title was strange, we’re about to see it happen in Nintendo’s ballpark too. 
That’s because the newly announced MLB The Show 22 is coming to Switch, marking the series’ first appearance on a Nintendo platform. The game is also heading to Xbox for the second year in a row, including launching day one on Game Pass. Of course, you’ll still be able to play it on PlayStation consoles. Los Angeles Angels superstar player and American League MVP Shohei Ohtani graces this year’s cover, and the game is set to launch on April 5.

This news comes by way of The Hollywood Reporter, which reports that Ted Field’s Radar Pictures now owns the rights to McGee’s Alice, which began as a 2000 third-person action-adventure series. A sequel, Alice: Madness Returns, was released by EA in 2011, and it featured the same Hot Topic-esque, third-person action-adventure gameplay. 
According to THR, the show will be a drama series and is the first small-screen adaptation for McGee’s Alice franchise. However, both McGee Alice games are based on Lewis Carroll’s Alice’s …</span>

While the video still presents the in-game action from a cinematic standpoint, it does provide looks at the models and animations on display. That’s important given that 2K22 runs on an entirely rebuilt gameplay engine, which 2K promises will be more intuitive than ever. The video also reveals previously unconfirmed superstars such as Asuka, Damien Priest, and Alexa Bliss. Cover star Rey Mysterio’s legendary career gets spotlighted in this year’s Showcase Mode and the trailer reveals one of the matches players can revisit: Rey vs Eddie Guerrero at WrestleMania 21.

To celebrate the 25th anniversary of what is considered by many to be the most popular Final Fantasy in the entire series, FF7 director Yoshinori Kitase and Final Fantasy 7 Remake director Tetsuya Nomura shared some words about what the series means to them. They also teased some exciting development in the universe of FF7-related games.

We learned about Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands’ Stabbomancer and Brr-Zerker classes back in October. Then, in December, we learned about the Spellshot and Clawbringer classes. Now, the final two classes, Spore Warden and Graveborn, have been revealed in a new trailer detailing how each works.

                    <span>CD Projekt Red is developing a single player, standalone Gwent game and it’s coming this year. 
Revealed by IGN, this Gwent game, which is based on the popular card game of the same name in the studio’s Witcher titles, is codenamed Project Golden Nekker. CDPR says Golden Nekker will be different from previous iterations of its Gwent titles, instead aiming to provide a “captivating single-player experience,” according to IGN. 
Because it’s a standalone game, players will not need to own other versions of CDPR’s Gwent games to play it. Once you boot up Golden Nekker, you’re all set to play. 
“It’s not another Witcher Tales game, but something different,” Gwent communications head Pawel Burza told IGN. “We’re aiming to provide a captivating single-player experience for players who prefer it over competitive multiplayer Gwent.” 
If you’re a fan of CDPR’s competitive multiplayer Gwent game, though, don’t fret – development is set to continue on that title at least through 2022, as the studio has released a 2022 roadmap that features new card drops in April, July, October, and December. When Golden Nekker is released, it will be the first CDPR game since the release of Cyberpunk 2077 back in 2020.
Be sure to check out IGN’s full report about this new Gwent game to see art for some of the cards. After that, read Game Informer’s Gwent: The Witcher Card Game review and then check out this opinion piece about why Assassin’s Creed Valhalla’s Orlog game is almost as good as Gwent.

                    <span>PlayStation has announced that it will air a State of Play this week all about Gran Turismo 7. 
The first State of Play of 2022, this one promises more than 30 minutes of new PlayStation 5 footage of the upcoming Polyphony Digital simulation racing game. It will also feature new details about GT7, which is slated to arrive on PS5 and PlayStation 4 on March 4. 
“The first 2022 State of Play arrives later this week, and we’re all revved up for just over 30 minutes of new PS5 footage and gameplay details for Gran Turismo 7,” a PlayStation Blog post reads. “Watch live February 2 on Twitch or YouTube starting 2 p.m. Pacific/ 5 p.m. Eastern/ 11 p.m. CET.” 
And that’s all that PlayStation had to say about the State of Play. Usually, PlayStation will mention that viewers shouldn’t expect this or that, but because it’s being dubbed a GT7 State of Play, there’s probably no reason for the company to give any caution in that regard. Basically, we don’t recommend going in this expecting PlayStation to surprise reveal a game or talk about Horizon Forbidden West in the showcase’s final few minutes. 
This State of Play will be the first in-depth look at GT7 in a while. It’s been a sure bet that we’ll see a trailer in recent PlayStation first-party showcases but beyond that, not much about GT7 is known. 
While waiting to learn more on Wednesday, read about GT7’s original announcement back in 2020 and then check out this GT7 trailer that shows off the game’s detailed customization and photo mode. Watch the latest GT7 trailer, which features a race around Daytona, after that.

                    <span>The Great Wind Waveker.
There&#x27;s a type of video game collectible that&#x27;s classy enough that your parents and non-gaming friends might not even notice that it&#x27;s a video game thing. On one end of the spectrum of &quot;nerdy to classy&quot;, you&#x27;ve got your Master Chief Funko Pops and your cardboard cutouts of Mario; on the other end, you&#x27;ve got classical orchestral covers of the Final Fantasy soundtrack and...this.
Adam, AKA North of the Border on YouTube, describes himself as someone who likes to &quot;make tiny nerdy things&quot;, and using a few points of inspiration, he decided to make a resin-and-clay model of Hokusai&#x27;s The Great Wave off Kanagawa, AKA &quot;that one painting that everyone really, really likes&quot;.

                    <span>It comes with a walkthrough!
You heard it here first: Pixels translate quite nicely into LEGO. Who&#x27;da thunk it? But we&#x27;ve not seen the likes of this LEGO map of The Legend of Zelda before. (Technically, we&#x27;ve seen a LEGO map of A Link to the Past, but that&#x27;s a different Zelda game, so it doesn&#x27;t count.)
This teeny-tiny recreation of the map from the original Zelda game isn&#x27;t just packed with details to notice — and lots and lots of LEGO cylinders and cones to represent trees — but the video comes with a full &quot;playthrough&quot; of the game, complete with sound effects. It was made by Ian Roosma, who spoke to Kotaku about the build, saying that it took four months to complete, and was driven by nostalgia.

While built on the current-generation RDNA2 architecture, this graphics card was widely panned for its price while only offering 4GB of video memory, limited to PCIe x4 bandwidth, and performance similar to the years-old Polaris GPUs. While all the major benchmarks online to this point have been under Windows, here is a look at how the AMD Radeon RX 6500 XT is performing under Linux.</span>

A small sum, perhaps, in the face of the $69 billion Microsoft are currently shelling out for Activision Blizzard, but rather than simply subsuming the Destiny developer into the PlayStation mothership, president and CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment Jim Ryan has said that Bungie will &quot;remain an independent and multi-platform studio and publisher.&quot; Well!

                    <span>Following Code Force&#x27;s recent demonstration, I was optimistic about the upcoming space 4X/simulation/strategy/forward slash game Distant Worlds 2. The original was a game I very nearly adored, but playing it always meant being a little too frustrated to talk about it without complaining a lot (which, granted, I do about everything, but still).
Code Force have since sent us a preview build, and I&#x27;ve been consumed with it for the better part of a week. I&#x27;m struggling to gauge exactly how much to reserve, because it&#x27;s had me positively cackling at my minor successes and howling in enjoyable despair at my setbacks. If they can do, ooh, two thirds of what I&#x27;m hoping in the six weeks before its release on March 10th, this could be every bit as brilliant as its predecessor, with fewer flaws.

It&#x27;s not another &#x27;Witcher Tales&#x27; like the previous singleplayer Gwent game, like Thronebreaker: The Witcher Tales, and it is confirmed to have at least two (2) monsters. Possibly three (3) if you consider that man is the real monster. Or four (4) if you hate libraries.

                    <span>Even with a bunch of post-launch performance improvements, Microsoft Flight Simulator is still the kind of game that can make most PCs sweat. Good news, then, for frequent flyers who happen to own an Nvidia GeForce RTX graphics card: Flight Sim is getting DLSS support this year.


Specifically, DLSS will be available when running the sim in DirectX 12, as part of a handful of upcoming DX12 enhancements that also include optimisations for playing on multiple monitors. Developers Asobo Studio confirmed the DLSS addition in a recent devstream, which you can watch in full below, though the feature is still being tested so there’s no specific date beyond 2022.

                    <span>Square Enix first launched Final Fantasy VII 25 years ago today, introducing a new generation to big-sword bishies. In celebration, both the director of the original JRPG and the creative director of the recent FF7 Remake have posted messages looking back and forward. Along with several FF7 mobile games kicking about, they tease that more new FF7 things we don&#x27;t know about are coming. Hopefully this means we&#x27;ll hear more about efforts to complete the remake, but I guess they could also be talking about merch or new movies.

                    <span>It wouldn’t work without the sounds. The thwop of your whip, the thwick of your dagger. The electronic twinkle of health-restoring chicken, which sounds uncannily like the shield’s up sound from 1999 classic 3D Astro Blaster. The ‘boo boo de boo, boo boo de boop’ of the chest-opening jingle, to which my shoulders cannot help but shimmy. Best of all: the plink of picking up an XP-granting gem - at first a sporadic treat, soon a near constant hum as the tide of enemies grows from a trickle into a flood. 
Vampire Survivors is a simple, early access, arcade-style game about dodging an ever-growing horde of monsters while acquiring spells that fire automatically. You can (and should) play it with one hand while eating a bag of crisps. It’s a very good way to spend £2.

                    <span>Intel’s Arc graphics cards are, despite apparent delays, likely to launch this year. And not just with the expectation of being good GPUs, but with the hope that they can fix one of the biggest vexations in PC gaming: a years-long component shortage that’s made all of the best graphics cards nearly impossible to buy at fair prices.


Intel graphics chief Raja Koduri is at least well aware of the pressure, tweeting that the company is “working hard to find a path towards the mission - getting millions of Arc GPUs into the hands of PC gamers every year.” Koduri was responding to an open letter from our friends at PC Gamer, calling on Intel to finally toss an escape rope down the hardware hellmouth we’ve all found ourselves trapped in. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger also responded, claiming “We’re on it.”

                    <span>As previously announced, a new trailer for Paramount’s Halo TV series premiered today, giving us an even better look at the much-anticipated adaptation and a premier date. 
The show starts from the beginning, with Dr. Halsey (played by Natascha McElhon) selling the UNSC on Master Chief’s exceptional combat prowess but, most importantly, his ability to be controlled. But when Chief encounters an ancient artifact, he uncovers a plot that may require him to act independently in a manner that may rub his superiors the wrong way. 
The new trailer provides the first looks at the Covenant, specifically Elites, who look pretty accurate in the brief clips of them battling Master Chief. We also get a glimpse of the show’s more human-toned (and slightly unsettling) Cortana, who is still voiced by Jen Taylor. The biggest adjustment will be getting used to Chief’s new voice, with actor Pablo Schreiber bringing him to life. Lastly, we found out that Halo premieres exclusively on Paramount + on March 24.

                    <span>If you repeatedly download and share pirated content you risk losing your Internet access in the United States. Faced with liability lawsuits, ISPs are more inclined to take this drastic action today, which can have grave consequences. For one subscriber, downloading a Skyrim mod appears to have been too much. But is this really what the game&#x27;s creators want?

                    <span>After tackling Metroid in Season 1, the second season of Game Informer&#x27;s Video Gameography podcast moves on to one of the biggest shooter franchises in existence: Halo. This week, we’re taking a look at the controversial Halo 5: Guardians, widely considered to be the most polarizing entry in the series. 
Halo 5: Guardians launched on the Xbox One on October 27, 2015, and was the tale of two Spartans. The campaign told a dual narrative centered on Master Chief and Jameson Locke, a soldier tasked with apprehending Chief after he goes AWOL to recover a rampant Cortana. Speaking of everyone’s favorite AI, her mission to subjugate the galaxy positions her as the main antagonist. Halo 5’s narrative didn’t universally land with fans and the game overall served as an unintentional poster child of the Xbox One’s flawed philosophy during its early years. How, you might ask? You’ll have to listen to find out.  
Join hosts Ben Reeves (@BenjaminReeves) and Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7) along with Wirecutter lead editor Arthur Gies (@aegies) as we unpack the history, impact, and lasting legacy of Halo 5: Guardians.

                    <span>This weekend I am looping the Assault On Precinct 13 theme to build the plodding determination I will need to survive the impending NFT bonanza. I do take some comfort in the fact that NFTs are so unpopular that Riot had scramble to cover after accidentally suggesting a Valorant character liked NFTs. And I especially enjoyed Yanis Varoufakis explaining why the metacryptofungiverse sucks. But more and more companies are talking about NFTs and things will get worse, and I&#x27;ll need the energy I can only get from Precinct 13 (and the amazing unused Jimmy Chambers song based on it).
But the terrible future can wait, what are you playing this weekend?

                    <span>In the closed network test, players explored a small slice of Limgrave and Stormveil. When I went hands-on with the game, all of Limgrave and Stormveil were open to me, including the haunting Weeping Penninsula to the south. But to the north of Stormveil lies another realm, a biome with a completely different aesthetic. Each realm in Elden Ring has its own signature set of creatures, flora, fauna, and more. The big boss of Stormveil, Godrick the Grafted, does not need to be beaten before moving on to the realm to the north, as a mildly hidden mountain path can lead players into this area without ever stepping foot inside the dangerous castle dungeon. 
This is the home of the magical academy of Raya Lucaria, and instead of the pastoral greens and rolling fields of Limgrave, it is draped in …</span>

Access to Elden Ring’s hub realm, known as the Roundtable Hold, does not come right away when starting the game, though it may be possible to speed access given the player fulfills the right conditions. Sometimes when you come across a site of lost grace (checkpoints similar to bonfires in the Souls games) and rest, Melina will appear and offer some interesting words of guidance or commentary on the Lands Between.

During my hands-on time with the game, I had the chance to face off with Godrick the Grafted himself, the current lord of Stormveil, and a serious challenge, especially for an “early game” boss. Granted, you don’t have to fight Godrick at all to get to other adjacent zones to continue exploring and powering up, so my path to the many-appendaged tyrant was brisk. I didn’t really do a whole lot of leveling up or gear optimization because the clock was ticking during my 10-hour play session, and I wanted to see and do as much as possible. It…</span>

                    <span>Boss battles in Elden Ring are frequent, ranging from small-scale affairs in coves, caves, and catacombs to incredibly intense boss battles in the legacy dungeons. However, there are also other boss battles located in both mid-tier dungeons and outside in the open world. While many players had a chance to take on a dragon in the Network Test, we encountered a new kind of open field boss in our time with Elden Ring, a ghostly mariner in the middle of a shallow lake. There’s no indication you will be entering a boss battle, other than fairly serious environmental clues. If you’re exploring organically, you may have also encountered the NPC “D” nearby, who hunts the undead and warns you that this small town has been beset by this ghostly fiend. Other than that, there’s just a big shallow lake…</span>

The footage showcased Castle Mourne, a never-before-seen area nestled in southern Limgrave on the Weeping Penninsula, featuring gargantuan armor-clad archers, grizzly chimeric monsters, and an optional boss fight.

                    <span>Elden Ring features numerous mini-dungeons like caves and catacombs to explore alongside giant sprawling dungeon crawls like Stormveil Castle. Castle Mourne, nestled in southern Limgrave on the Weeping Penninsula, is a place where horrors abound. Chimeric leonine creatures and other surprises await the player should they dare approach. While this locale would fall into the mini-dungeon classification, it&#x27;s substantially larger than any of the minor offerings that I experienced during my 10 hours of gameplay, with a dangerous approach and several checkpoints.

                    <span>Legendary writer George R.R. Martin collaborated with From Software and Hidetaka Miyazaki to essentially create the mythology of the world of Elden Ring before the catastrophic Shattering event. The characters involved were often crafted as humans, heroic but flawed in their journeys and adventures. However, as From Software took on the task of converting these characters to entities that would fit into Elden Ring, these mythic heroes and personalities got broken down into something twisted and more suited to occupying a “boss monster” role.
“When Martin wrote these characters, and when he provided that origin story that mythos for the world of Elden Ring, these demigods were much closer to their original form, and maybe closer to human form back then, before the Shattering, before it all …</span>

                    <span>Players that have been enjoying From Software’s last decade of action/RPG fare have discovered recurring characters, themes, and weaponry to be found in various forms across the games. While they don’t always make an explicit appearance, sometimes they’re found as shimmering surprises that delight (and terrify). This is the case during Ludwig’s phase two battle, where he decides to pull out the Moonlight Greatsword and attempt to dunk on the player with some incredibly flashy power moves. In Elden Ring, players will be able to interact with the duplicitous traitor Patches as well as acquire both the Storm Ruler and Moonlight Greatsword. 
“I can confidently say yes, this time. Elden Ring is the sort of game that forgives a massive sense of volume and bulk,” says game director Hidetaka Miyazaki. “And so I felt like I was entitled to include these things this time. So yes, you will find them if you look hard enough.”
Of course, with Elden Ring being a vast open-world full of secrets and exploration, it’s likely that some of these items will be tucked away and hidden behind mysteries. While we probably won’t be taking down a manta ray Storm King with the Storm Ruler this time around, since Patches will be there, it’s possible that some other pieces of King’s Field and From Software history will be around somewhere. Since we’ve seen multiple dragons as part of this world, it wouldn’t shock me to see something akin to Seath the Scaleless slithering around.

In the same conversion with Miyazaki, while we did get to see otherworldly areas like the Roundtable Hold, there won’t be any Painted Worlds in the game as he feels those are specifically a Dark Souls element. However, you can find paintings in the game all over – collectible objects that display a specific location in the world tied to the artist’s soul. While I didn’t get to track any of these locales down during my session, you can be sure that’s one of the first things on my list of things to do with the final game.</span>

                    <span>If you’ve played one of the From Software action/RPG titles from Souls to Bloodborne, chances are you’re used to coming face to face with an area where the environment itself can feel like a major boss encounter. These oppressive poisonous swamp areas really got their stride in the Valley of Defilement all the way back in Demon’s Souls, but have continued to plague players to various degrees through the notorious Blighttown to other poisonous pits, caves, and muck. Speaking with Elden Ring game director Hidetaka Miyazaki, he relays that in this game, he rekindled his love for creating these horrific environments.
“In terms of how the player feels when they encounter this area that is a different story,” says Miyazaki. “But when making the game I rediscovered my love for making poison swamp…</span>

                    <span>The digital edition of the Elden Ring issue goes live tomorrow at 2 PM CST. At the exact same time, I’ll be heading to the official Game Informer Twitch channel to do a live discussion about everything we saw and played during our nearly 10 hours of hands-on time with From Software’s upcoming dark action RPG. While this obviously comes with a spoiler warning, even with our extensive play session, there are many, many secrets left to discover in Elden Ring – even with the marathon session, I feel like I’ve barely begun to scratch the surface of what Elden Ring has to offer. 
We’ll be talking about mechanics, features, gameplay, environments, and some other big surprises, but From Software has always been quite reserved in what they choose to show off early compared to what’s available in the final game – remember Bloodborne? No one was ready for where that journey would take us! So come hang out, chat, and ask your questions about Elden Ring. While I won’t be able to answer every question, I’ll do my best to facilitate some great conversations about what you can expect diving into Elden Ring. 
In addition to the stream, look forward to a deluge of coverage to hit GameInformer.com soon, including some exclusive video.</span>

The Elder Scrolls Online has received multiple expansions since its launch years ago and its next one has been announced. Titled Legacy of the Bretons, ZeniMax Online says it’s a “year-long saga” that will begin with &quot;High Isle.&quot;

Revealed during the Sea of Thieves 2022 Preview Event, The Arena is officially coming to an end as it simply isn’t a mode played by most players. Rare says it was a tough decision to come to, but the right one for the future of the open-world pirate game. 
“Firstly, this was an extremely tough decision, but we firmly believe it’s the right one to allow us to focus on our plans for the central free-roaming Adventure mode,” Rare writes in a blog post. “Despite the efforts of a hugely talented team, The Arena unfortunately never met the goals we originally had for it – either in creating a genuine alternative way to play Sea of Thieves with a competitive spin, or a short session experience if you didn’t have the tim…</span>

                    <span>If you’ve been paying attention to Sega for the last couple of years, then you likely know that it has been slowly shuttering its massive Japan-based arcade centers. Now, Sega has announced that it is leaving the business of arcades entirely, ending a 50-year era defined by claw machines, fighters, and more. 
This news comes by way of Destructoid, which translated a statement released by Sega this morning. In it, the company reveals that it intends to sell the remaining 14.9% of shares it holds within its arcade division to another company named Genda Inc., which Destructoid reports is the same company that Sega has been selling its arcade centers to over the last few years. 
“Sega stores across the country will be switching their store names to GiGO, to express our gratitude for Sega’s 56 years of history and our desire to be an oasis that quenches people’s thirst for real entertainment,” Genda chairman Hisashi Kataoka said in regards to the news, according to Video Games Chronicle. “We will start with Ikebukuro, Akihabara, and Shinjuku. Then to the whole country.” 
The Sega branding on standing arcade centers will begin to be replaced by GiGO Entertainment branding. While Sega is leaving the business of owning and running arcade centers, don’t expect to see Sega arcade machines disappear. Destructoid reports that Sega still intends to produce arcade machines for worldwide distribution – you just won’t see them inside a large building with a massive Sega sign on it anymore. 
Of course, Sega is still in the business of making games, too, and this year, we’re expecting a new game starring everyone’s favorite blue blur in Sonic Frontiers. Check out the latest Sonic Frontiers trailer for a look at its open world and then read about how Sonic Frontiers was originally going to release in 2021 for the series’ 30th anniversary.

Join John Carson and Alex Stadnik as they traverse the realm of Hisui and show off all the new additions to the iconic series.

With Legends, Game Freak has taken the most significant series leap in quite some time, but did the risk pay off? Our own Brian Shea seems to think so. In his review, he said:
Catching as many Pokémon as you can, learning more about them, and training them to be stronger in battle are the very foundations of Game Freak&#x27;s iconic RPG series, but few titles exemplify those core concepts as powerfully as this latest outing. Pokémon Legends: Arceus tasks you with exploring a bygone era of the Sinnoh region, then known as Hisui, and gives you more ways than ever to complete your Pokédex. While some elements don&#x27;t feel like their final forms, I love where this new direction takes the Pokémon series.

We will be hopping into Alex&#x27;s current save during today&#x27;s stream and focusing on catching Pokémon and exploring the different biomes that make up Hisui. We will try to avoid story quests since he&#x27;s pretty far into the game unless you want to see a mission or two, of course. To let us know what you want to see, be sure to join us in the Twitch chat, kick your feet up, and send the week off with a bang.

                    <span>Ubisoft is shutting Hyper Scape down this year less than two years after its release. 
First revealed in the summer of 2020, and released shortly after its reveal as a free-to-play battle royale, Hyper Scape put players in a futuristic city to fight against 100 players in squads of three. To differentiate itself from just another battle royale, Hyper Scape attempted to do things a little differently. It kept loadouts small, traversal extremely fast-paced, and it even gave viewers on streaming platforms the ability to vote on in-game events that changed the ongoing match.

However, it wasn’t enough to keep the battle royale afloat and now, Ubisoft has announced that Hyper Space will be shutting down in a couple of months. 
blog post reads. “We set out to create a vertical, close-quarters, and fast-paced shooter experience and we are extremely grateful to our community for joining us on our journey. We will be taking key learnings from this game into future products.

To the Hyper Scape community, thank you for your passion and dedication to the world of Neo Arcadia both inside and outside the game. Your devotion to the game we built will always be cherished.” 

If you haven’t yet checked out Hyper Scape, maybe consider giving it a go before April 28. Regardless of how you might feel about the game, after April 28, it will be gone forever and an unplayable part of history.

                    <span>One of the biggest surprises of Fortnite Chapter 3 Season 1 is the inclusion of everyone’s favorite web-slinger, Spider-Man. Plus, everyone in the game can utilize his web-slinging abilities thanks to the web shooters item. Well, it seems Spider-Man’s existence in Fortnite has attracted one of his greatest foes to the battle royale because Green Goblin is now available in the Fortnite Item Shop. 
Now live, you can purchase the Green Goblin outfit to play as the infamous villain or you can purchase the entire Green Goblin set to be fully prepared to take down New York&#x27;s, err, Fortnite Island’s masked menace. If you’re looking to be fully decked out with Green Goblin bling, though, here’s what you’ll find in the set: 
Pumpkin Bomb Back Bling (included with the outfit)
Pumpkin P’axe
Goblin Glider
Arm the Pumpkin! Emote
“Players can purchase the Outfit (plus Back Bling), Pickaxe, Glider, and Emote individually or as part of the Green Goblin Bundle,” Epic Games writes in a press release. “This bundle additionally includes the Attack of the Goblin Loading Screen.” 
If you haven’t yet unlocked the Spider-Man outfit, you can earn it by leveling up through the Fortnite Chapter 3 Season 1 Battle Pass. If green is more your style, you can embrace the goblin serum right now in the Fortnite Item Shop. 
For more about Fortnite, read about the new Pizza Party item now in the game and then check out what Hawkeye and Kate Bishop from Disney’s Hawkeye show look like in the battle royale. Check out Game Informer’s ongoing list of all the Marvel and DC superheroes and villains in Fortnite after that.

The games I&#x27;ve collected this week for the first TFI Friday of the year are going to ease us gently out of the time loop that we&#x27;ve been stuck in the last umpteen months. Accordingly, the first one is a time loop puzzle game.

                    <span>Through an entirely unplanned sequence of events, I&#x27;m currently playing two big action adventure games that couldn&#x27;t be less alike. One is God Of War, a big, serious dadventure epic about an emotionally distant father trying his darnedest to connect with his (at times very irritating) son. The other is Kena: Bridge Of Spirits, an altogether more wholesome adventure about a young girl cleansing a lush, forested mountainside from a serious case of bad vibes and helping lost ghosts pass on to the other side. 
About the only thing they have in common is that they both have what one might call &#x27;cute&#x27; NPC companions. Dad Of War is joined by his eager archer &quot;BOY!&quot; Atreus, while Kena has her gaggle of black, fluffy Rot friends (above, right). According to the widely accepted law of big googly-eyes, I should find the Rot absolutely adorable and thus beyond reproach. Atreus does not have big googly-eyes (they are merely wide and naive), but he is certainly a lot cuter than God Of War&#x27;s other main companion, a talking disembodied head. And yet. Even though Atreus has now reached that stage where he&#x27;s doing all his adolescent whining and rebellion and &quot;I know you are, but what am I?&quot; nonsense in the space of about two hours, I would much rather have this sulky pre-teen by my side than the interminable Rot. Let me explain.

                    <span>In theory, I miss auto scrolling arcade shooters and would love it if they came back. In reality, they come back all the time and I never really click with them because what I really miss is being a child and feeling like almost every game I saw was magical.
I&#x27;m pretty bad at them as well, which doesn&#x27;t help. Mostly though, I became jaded and curmudgeonly at around nine years old, and will never know such naive wonder again.
Still, Hyper Echelon is fun.

                    <span>They say everything is bigger in Texas. It&#x27;s a statement I have only briefly put to the test during a rushed weeked in San Antonio, a trip I mostly remember for 1) seeing a roadside billboard that advertised Jesus on one side and massive tits on the other, and 2) making a joke about having a puffy taco &quot;so I guess I should see a doctor!&quot; [finger guns] that fell bone-chillingly flat to a dinner table of American business colleagues.
You know where everything actually is bigger? The past. Join us on this special supporter-funded bonus podcast episode where Nate is our gentle and enthusiastic guide for really massive historical monsters. A giant owl? Bigfoot is really an orangutan? A huge fish that might in fact just be well big, owing to a mistake with its skeleton? Yes, we have all these delights and more. A big thank you to our supporters for making The Nate Files happen.

                    <span>With NFTs in games proving unpopular with almost everyone who doesn&#x27;t plan to get rich by fleecing other players, even appearing to support them is controversial. This is a situation Riot Games found themselves in after a lighthearted tweet about one of the Valorant wizards visiting an art exhibition on a day out. Turns out, the picture seen by Killjoy is an NFT. Cue Riot scrambling to make clear it was unintentional and say, literally, &quot;Whoopsie!&quot;

                    <span>Anecdotally, the first records of modern golf date back to its banning in 15th century Scotland. “Nay Golf,” said parliament. “It’s turning the soldiers into fiendish, turf-snorting club-strokers who’d rather say shit like ‘Triple Bogey’ than batter the English, and we’re no having it.” RPGolf Legends is not set in 15th century Scotland, but it does take place in a world where golf has been banned. Only you - through the power of bare-bones ARPG combat and a fun but limited golf mini-game - can save the noble sport from ostensible nonexistence. 
I say ostensible because, in reality, golf is everywhere. Our heroine Aerin’s hometown is called Mulligandale. It has two shops, one of them dedicated entirely to golf. Folk shimmy about in golfwear, talking about golf. Many give out golf-related quests, the rewards for which are usually some form of golfing paraphernalia, often golf balls. The actual golf courses themselves have been sealed off by an ill-defined big villainous, but if you put a translucent barrier around the thing you’re trying to crush and still let the people you’re attempting to terrorise build their entire society as a monument to it, you’re basically asking for a plucky hero to restore the national passtime to glory. Highly questionable bit of villainy, this.

It might be that it&#x27;s the best example of its genre, or it contains a valuable lesson for future generations. This month, we&#x27;re travelling back to rescue eight games from 2010, and cor, what a good year that was. Too bad almost all of them will end up in the lava bin by the time we&#x27;re done.

                    <span>Hyper Scape was launched suddenly in July 2020. Initially accessible only via Twitch drops, early streams gathered half a million viewers before it opened up to everyone ten days later.

Unfortunately its drop in popularity was just as sudden, and almost as immediate. Eighteen months later, Ubisoft have announced they&#x27;re ending development and shutting the game down on April 28th.

Grappling hooks are the best thing in video games, and I am fully ready to swing through a colourful, cute platformer. To my infinite delight, Grapple Dog now has a release date: February 10th.

                    <span>When Death Stranding&#x27;s PC pubishers announced in January that the expanded Death Stranding Director&#x27;s Cut was indeed coming belatedly to PC, they neglected to mention whether they&#x27;d offer a cheaper upgrade. Seeing as the newness is very much not worth buying the game again, it was a weird omission. But, now they say they&#x27;ll offer a £9/$10 upgrade from the base game, and announced a release date of the 30th of March. Right-o!

                    <span>Back in the mists of time of 2013, a bunch of Japanese developers got together to make a series of short 3DS games called the Guild series. Headed up by Ni No Kuni makers Level-5, it had some pretty big-name contributors: Keiji Inafune, Goichi Suda, Yoot Saito and Yasumi Matsuno among others. But there was one game that stood out to me as something really quite special. It was the considerably less well-known Millennium Kitchen&#x27;s Attack Of The Friday Monsters, a sweet slice of life adventure that saw you play as ten-year-old Sohta walking the streets of his small Tokyo suburb on a hazy summer afternoon in 1971. It was a tender celebration of childhood nostalgia and imagination, with just an inkling of some menacing undertones, both from the people Sohta meets in his neighbourhood and the titular Friday kaiju monsters that may or may not exist in the real world. 
I mention all this because The Kids We Were is probably the only game I&#x27;ve played since then that&#x27;s even come close to capturing some of that Attack Of The Friday Monsters magic. You won&#x27;t find any kaiju here, but this is a similarly nostalgic portrait of pastoral Tokyo, as viewed through the eyes of young Minato on his summer holidays, first in the present day and then in the 1980s when he ends up travelling back in time Back To The Future-style to when his parents first met as kids. With three days to right past wrongs, this is one of those gentle, coming of age tales that leaves you feeling warm and fuzzy in all the right places, even when there&#x27;s no real &#x27;game&#x27; to speak of.

It&#x27;s called Perfect Storm and it adds &#x27;Calamities&#x27; to the game - disasters which can befall your prison that you need to build contingencies for and overcome. That includes weather such as lightning storms, heatwaves and snow storms, but also rat infestations.

                    <span>Hitman 3 had a rough launch on Steam last week, quickly gathering 50% negative user reviews. Many of the complaints related to price and confusion over the various editions on sale.
To make amends, Io Interactive are giving anyone who buys Hitman 3 on Steam before February 19th a free upgrade. If you buy the standard edition (£50/$60), you&#x27;ll be bumped up to the Deluxe Edition (£75/$90). If you bought the Deluxe Edition, you&#x27;ll get a free upgrade to the Seven Deadly Sins Collection (which on its own costs £23.73 with its 15% launch discount).

                    <span>Before No Man’s Sky, Hello Games made its name with Joe Danger. The series put players atop the motorcycle of the titular daredevil to perform death-defying stunts in the name of scoring points and having a good time. In addition to the mainline console games, Joe Danger had a couple of mobile entries, such as Joe Danger Infinity, which released in 2014 but was later rendered incompatible with modern Apple devices. However, it looks like Infinity is making a comeback thanks to a touching request by a concerned parent. 
Hello Games head Sean Murray took to Twitter to announce Joe Danger Infinity’s upcoming return, stating the reason is due to a letter he received from a fan. This person stated his child Jack, who has autism, adored the Joe Danger series and was particularly enamored with In…</span>

                    <span>It was revealed earlier this month that Kojima Productions’ Death Stranding Director’s Cut would be coming to PC sometime this Spring. Now, we know exactly when we can trek across North America once more with our BB on PC. 
505 Games, which is publishing the title on PC, has revealed that Death Stranding Director’s Cut will hit Steam and the Epic Games Store on Wednesday, March 30, 2022. It will cost $39.99, which is $10 more than it costs on PlayStation 5 where this edition of the game was first released. However, if you already own Death Stranding on PC, you’ll be able to upgrade for a much lower price. 
“Owners of Death Stranding can upgrade to the Director’s Cut for the discounted price of $9.99 by installing the current game and purchasing through the in-game storefront,” 505 Games writes in a press release. “Those who still need a copy of the base game can find it at a discounted rate of 70% off during Steam’s Lunar Sales (Thursday, January 27 through Thursday, February 3). 
As for what to expect, the Director’s Cut on PC brings higher frame rates, ultrawide monitor support, and a “feature-rich photo mode” to the game. 
“Death Stranding Director’s Cut on PC enhances the groundbreaking title with higher frame rates, ultrawide monitor support, and a stunning photo mode,” 505 Games says. “Thanks to the power of Intel’s new Xe Super Sampling (XeSS) graphics technology recently revealed at CES 2022, Death Stranding has never looked more hauntingly beautiful. Navigate a fractured world as Sam Bridges on a treacherous journey to reunite America, complete with an expanded storyline, new stealth missions, combat abilities, and more.” 
Death Stranding Director’s Cut will hit Steam and the Epic Games Store on March 30. While waiting for its release, read Game Informer’s original Death Stranding review and then read about why Death Stranding Director’s Cut is worth another trek across America.

                    <span>Star Wars 1313 is basically a relic of the past now. It was first announced way back in 2012, and at E3 that year, we got a glimpse of what to expect in the Uncharted-esque bounty hunter title. It looked great, too. 
However, anyone familiar with the history of 1313 knows that 2012 was also the last year that we officially saw the title. Of course, gameplay and details from it have continued to leak over the years and today is another one of those days where we learn something new about it. That’s because new and unseen 1313 footage has leaked online, just a day after the latest episode of The Book of Boba Fett, no less, which held a surprise for Star Wars video game fans.

This time, the footage features Boba Fett chasing after some people on the advanced Jedi headquarters city of Coruscant, and like previous 1313 footage that’s leaked online, it’s clearly a work-in-progress, or rather, a snapshot of what was once a work-in-progress. It looks great, though!
It begins with a much more detailed Coruscant marketplace before Boba Fett gives chase, and it’s during this chase sequence we see a much-less detailed exterior of a Coruscant building. You can also see the Uncharted inspiration all over it, too, which isn’t surprising given that Uncharted 2 director Amy Hennig was attached to the game at one point. 
While it’s neat to see this unseen footage of a game that will never be, it definitely hurts because it looks fun. The same can be said for the Darth Maul game we’ll never get to play. You can watch some footage from that Darth Maul title for a taste of what we were in for. 
What would you rather see resurrected – 1313 or the Darth Maul game? Let us know in the comments below!</span>

                    <span>Since Intel&#x27;s Alder Lake launch one of the test requests to come in a few times has been about the Intel P-State CPU frequency scaling driver and how its performance differs with the various governor choices available for altering the CPU frequency scaling behavior. Now that Linux 5.16 stable is out and running in good shape on Alder Lake, here are some Core i9 12900K benchmarks looking at various CPU frequency scaling choices and their impact on raw performance as well as CPU thermals and power consumption.</span>

                    <span>Mostly, I want people to shut up about NFTs and cryptocurrency and the metaverse and play-to-earn games. Maybe if we turn away and pretend they&#x27;re not there, it&#x27;ll all burn out when scammers grow tired of being scammed by other scammers. However, one of the few people I do want to hear talk about it all is Yanis Varoufakis, who was Valve&#x27;s in-house economist before becoming Greece&#x27;s finance minister then an MP. In a wonderfully long new interview, he is not impressed by much of the hype, and it is DELIGHTFUL.

Whether giving a quick thanks to a helpful teammate or settling into an hours-long Discord session, some games are just better with a bit of a chinwag going on – and adding one of the best gaming microphones to your setup will make sure you always come through loud and clear.

                    <span>Be honest with me: when you read the words &quot;Lovecraftian dating sim&quot;, did your mind go straight to a joke about tentacle porn? Horror-themed dating sims are not exactly new, but it&#x27;s rare to be given the opportunity to date the eldritch gods themselves, and taken at face value, it&#x27;s hard to imagine where else this could be going.
Well, allow me to dispel your illusions right away: Sucker For Love: First Date is not an H-game. It is, in fact, the most chaste dating sim I think I&#x27;ve ever played, while also managing to be the most obscenely graphic. You often hear games that straddle different genres accused of not knowing what they&#x27;re trying to be. Sucker For Love does not suffer from this issue: it knows exactly what it wants to be. The challenge is for you, the hapless player, to keep the hell up.

Now we know she&#x27;ll be emerging from the backstory and joining the playable Legend roster with Season 12 (Defiance), and a new trailer gives us our first look at her rather destructive set of abilities.

                    <span>This week the Electronic Wireless Show podcast discusses some of our favourite (and least favourite) inventory configurations. A humble beast, the inventory, yet a feature of many games - sometimes even a necessity. Often we only notice one if it&#x27;s terrible. But boy, a good inventory is worth a dozen mules. So lets talk about them today!
In other news this week, Nate thinks he has come up with an original premise for a Pixar film, only to discover he has invented Seth Rogan&#x27;s nightmare film Sausage Party, and we are officially starting our campaign to get Henry &#x27;Vitamin H&#x27; Cavill on the show. We will be mentioning him every week from now on. Plus: what we like doing on our birthdays, school plays, and pro-wrestling adaptations of Dickens.

                    <span>Boomerangs are cool as hell. The sleek wooden objects careen through the air in a perfect circle - in theory, at least - before returning right back to where they began in the palm of your hand. They’re something that fascinated me as a child, and 20-something years later I still don’t really know how or why they work.


Deflector is like someone taped two swords to a boomerang, Mad Max-style. How does the boomerang still operate with twin blades slashing back and forth on either end? Don’t know. How does it always circle its way back to where you’re standing after dashing around an arena filled with enemies? Not a clue.

The maps were some of the best things about it. Old-school mega-arenas adorned with portal-zappable walls that functioned as DIY shortcuts. As virtual coliseums of chaos go, they were pretty cool. Well, now you can make your own. Splitgate is launching into season 1 this week (the developers insist the last four months have been &quot;season 0&quot;) and alongside a couple of new game modes, there&#x27;s now a map creation tool.

                    <span>My personal top Twitter tip: add pleasant breaks to the nightmares of your feed by following a few good image accounts or bots which regularly post nice things. I like accounts which post rock formations or bots which generate landscapes. Perhaps you find comfort in violence? If so, you might enjoy interrupting your doomscrolling with the Doomscroll Doom Bot, a Twitter bot which is very slowly posting a complete playthrough of Ultimate Doom, one frame every hour.

                    <span>&quot;Just tell us about the crystals&quot;, demands Jack, Stranger Of Paradise Final Fantasy Origin&#x27;s prickly protagonist. He has no time for the posh dark elf who applauds him for something. Whatever it is, Jack doesn&#x27;t care. In fact, I don&#x27;t think he knows where he is. If he does, he wants nothing to with it.
This interaction is contained in a new trailer that I deem to be perfect. It sells me on this Final Fantasy action RPG, because it seems like I&#x27;ll get to control someone as impatient as I am. Jack lives for crashing and bashing. The story is an inconvenience for him, the fighting is not.

Today they confirmed they&#x27;re returning to their supersuit FPS with a new instalment they claim will be &quot;a truly next-gen shooter.&quot; They&#x27;re not clear about what next-gen means to them. Will Crysis 4: a) require a £1500 graphics card; b) be a battle royale; or c) sell NFT hats on the metaverse blockchain cryptonet? Answers on a postcard, reader dear.

The group calling themselves the Game Workers Alliance will now have to hit up the National Labor Relations Board and run elections, but say they&#x27;re still confident about unionising because, y&#x27;know, they have the support of a supermajority. &quot;Once again, when management is given a choice, they always seem to take the low road,&quot; the group said.

                    <span>Although announcing three games at once feels a bit much, I&#x27;m really happy about the Respawn feat. Star Wars news. Respawn Entertainment always felt like one of those development studios that should have been shut down by a bigger studio circa 2015 because the people loved Titanfall but it wasn&#x27;t, you know, Call Of Duty or anything. I turned my back for what seemed like but a moment, and suddenly Apex Legends exists and Respawn are one of the key players under EA, growing stronger from within. One day we&#x27;ll be watching Andrew Wilson at an E3 showcase and realise it&#x27;s actually Vince Zampella&#x27;s eyes looking out at us. Everyone coming on stage to present is just Vince Zampella doing a voice and wearing a different baseball cap.
Point is, I&#x27;m mostly just pleased that Respawn are still around to make games featuring robots that surprise and delight us. And if they&#x27;re not allowed to do Titanfall 3, Star Wars is at least a rich field to till said robots. Lousy with robots, is Star Wars. But honestly, if anyone is going to make Star Wars games (apart from BioWare, who have spent recent years making Dragon Age 4 and / or collapsing like a magnificent neutron star) then I&#x27;d root for Respawn. They may not make the Star Wars games you think you want, but they&#x27;ll make the ones you need right now.

                    <span>After moves to block access to the Tor network, last month Russian authorities ordered the blocking of TorProject.org, the main domain of the privacy-focused anti-censorship tool Tor. With assistance from digital rights activists at Roskomsvoboda, Tor has now mounted a legal challenge to have the blocking reversed.

                    <span>Vampire Survivors is an action RPG boiled down to its core. You walk around, you kill monsters, you level up, you get stronger, you kill more monsters. In place of story, an inventory, or even the need to fire and aim your own weapons, there is pixel art spectacle. 

On my last life, I killed around 24,000 monsters in 30 minutes. I am hooked.

                    <span>After six long weeks, Final Fantasy XIV is back on sale. That&#x27;s after Square Enix stopped selling the MMORPG after the critically acclaimed life-hog overwhelmed its servers, causing massive server queues and network errors. Thankfully, those days are behind the game now. So yes, if you&#x27;ve been longing to check out its excellent Endwalker expansion or famous smooth grapes, you can! And from a new Oceania server too, because Squeenix now have room for those down under to sample Eorzea&#x27;s delicacies.

                    <span>There was cause for joy and concern alike when Intel revealed the Core i5-12400F, alongside loads of other new 12th gen Alder Lake CPUs. Here was a much more affordable, still gaming focused-alternative to the Core i5-12600K, yet it would lack the signature hybrid of fast Performance cores and flexible Efficiency cores that made that chip one of the best gaming CPUs ever made. 


Turns out, the concern was for naught: the Core i5-12400F is a cracking slice of silicon, both for the money and for games specifically. Although the sole reliance on Performance cores (or P-cores) puts it behind the Core i5-12600K for desktop multitasking, if it’s just the frames per second you’re after, this cheaper chip can match and sometimes even surpass its big brother.

                    <span>Firework actually came out almost exactly a year ago, but the English language version (translated from the original Chinese) was released just before Christmas. Which is a good thing, because Firework is well worth checking out if you have an interest in either horror games or puzzle games. The horror isn&#x27;t blood-chilling, but rather twisted up with grief and sorrow in how inevitable it is. Similarly, the puzzles aren&#x27;t going to stump you for long, but they fit very well with the story. These two strands of the game weave together and create a nice, thoughtful experience that&#x27;s worth the four or so hours of having it.

Please make a game that is basically Strange Horticulture, but about a weird book shop. Possibly a book shop with a small coffee shop attached. I&#x27;m not going to be too strict about it, you know, I&#x27;m not a monster. It could, for example, be a library. Or maybe there isn&#x27;t another business attached, or the business attached to it is a bakery instead of a coffee shop. This isn&#x27;t just my personal hobby horse, either. I&#x27;m pretty sure loads of people would like that game. And please, for the love of God, tell me if the Mystery Book Shop Game already exists. I&#x27;d be disappointed if it does, because nobody has yet brought it to my attention.

The team at Blackbird Interactive has watched the recent return of the classic RTS games with interest - vested interest, in fact. Tasked by Korean developer Smilegate with transposing their Counter-Strike-style shooter Crossfire to the strategy genre, Blackbird believes it has identified a hole yet to be filled. A nostalgic need to be catered to.
“I argue that in the recent resurgence, we haven’t yet come across an RTS game that offers players an experience comparable to StarCraft or Red Alert,” says game designer Maurice Grela. “We’re hoping to fulfill that gap.”

                    <span>Everyone can agree that it is at least a little bit funny when scammers run fake NFT drops and cryptocurrencies to fleece idiots, but it&#x27;s less funny when innocent people get caught up in a scam. The publishers of Outerverse, a game about building automation and battling bosses, say scammers are pretending to run a blockchain version of the game and using this to sell cryptocurrency. It seems an obvious scam, which can&#x27;t be good for the game&#x27;s image.

                    <span>With the Steam Deck’s February rollout bearing down, Valve are still unveiling the portable PC’s new tricks. The latest, as per a Steamworks Development blog post, is Dynamic Cloud Sync: a variation of Steam’s existing cloud save feature that ensures save files can sync between a player’s Steam Deck and PC even when the former is only suspended, rather than fully powered down.

                    <span>Personal data and other records held by ISPs on their customers are highly sensitive and as such, can only be handed over to third parties when the law requires it. In movie piracy cases, judges often order this type of disclosure after consideration but in a new case involving CenturyLink customers, customer details could already be in the hands of some extremely litigious copyright holders.

The YouTube-rippers cited a letter where the EFF defends the non-infringing nature of the youtube-dl software. The RIAA, however, argues that this letter is irrelevant and suggests that the EFF is far from a neutral expert.

                    <span>Two months after announcing they&#x27;re buying Weta Digital, the CGI studio behind King Of The Hoops and that, Unity are now buying virtual skin. Today the makers of the Unity engine announced the acquisition of Ziva Dynamics, a company whose tech specialises in simulating skin and meat to make fancy facial animations and meaty muscle and such. Their tech powered the flappy flesh of the troll in a recent Hellblade 2 trailer, and has been seen on PlayStations in Spider-Man: Miles Morales.

                    <span>There were a lot of games I played last year that could have been on our Best Games You Missed list at the end of 2021. I ended up going with Studio Pixel Punk&#x27;s Unsighted in the end, but it was very nearly OPUS: Echo Of Starsong, a stunning visual novel adventure game from Taiwanese studio Sigono Inc. I&#x27;d seen a few other games journalists raving about it when it came out on Steam last September, and hey, over 3000 overwhelmingly positive Steam reviews can&#x27;t be wrong either, so I took the plunge, and golly, it sure is something special.

Unused cash raised for a strike fund will be saved for future efforts.

This time, it’s going right back to Codemasters&#x27; TOCA Race Driver roots and adding in a full-fat story mode, complete with real actors. No Scotty, mind, but we suppose they have to save something for the sequel. It’s this story mode we’ve been given early access to, so let’s jump in.

The Twitch Rivals tournament SquidCraft Games over the weekend included a number of players in Andorra, several of whom dropped out after their connections exploded. Trying to blast a whole country offline to ruin a Minecraft tournament sounds like the setup for a bad YA metaverse novel but may be a terrible vision of our future.

Here in the UK it’s only the RTX 3070 Ti Founders Edition that’s seen a hike, from £529 up to £549, but over in the lands of the Euro these graphics cards will set buyers back up to €100 more than before. That’s for the RTX 3090 FE, which now sits at a widowmaking €1,649, while the rest of the range has gained between €20 and €60 in wallet weight.

The requirement, signed off by a Colorado federal court, is part of the discovery process in an ongoing legal battle. The targeted accounts are limited to the IP addresses that were most frequently flagged for alleged copyright infringements.

He claimed that a third party was responsible for the sales but a local court found him guilty of copyright infringement offenses, also handing down a four-month suspended prison sentence.

It&#x27;s also, of course, an enormously popular trading card game, and its latest digital iteration, Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel, came to Steam this past week. It&#x27;s currently the fourth most popular game on the platform by concurrent players.

Hitman 3 frustrated players when it first launched on Epic, because their progress didn&#x27;t carry over; Hitman 1 frustrated players on GOG last year because its internet requirements constitute DRM; and now Hitman 3 is back at it again on Steam. It currently has &quot;Mixed&quot; reviews after arriving on the platform earlier this week, with players cross about its price, its umpteen editions, and - yes, again - progress not carrying over for some.

These moves come in the wake of several lawsuits alleging a culture of harassment and discrimination within the company. The post announcing the plans also comes days after Microsoft announced their intent to buy Activision Blizzard.

Activision Blizzard came in on Monday dragging a trail of lawsuits and scandal with allegations of widespread discrimination and harassment, on Tuesday were being bought by Microsoft for $69 billion (£50 billion), and now on Friday they&#x27;ve grown a union. 34 quality assurance testers at the Activision Blizzard studio Raven Software, who currently maintain Call Of Duty: Warzone, are forming a union named the Game Workers Alliance. They&#x27;re seeking better working conditions in the wake of Raven QA layoffs.

                    <span>I’ve always entertained the idea of an apocalypse. I mean, zombies are definitely scary, but it’d be a cool fantasy to play out. Over the years, I’ve even formed my own little plan. Loot some local houses and then set up a base in the fire station on my street. They’ve got electric gates and metal fences to guard the perimeter, a renewable power source thanks to a wind turbine on the roof, and a really handy watchtower. I thought 11 years of The Walking Dead would’ve prepared me fairly well and I fancied my chances. So, I made myself in Project Zomboid. It turns out, everything I learned from The Walking Dead was useless.

                    <span>Pupperazzi is a game about taking pictures of dogs. They are, as is traditional, very cute dogs. You go around several areas that increase in complexity and dog saturation, completing photo challenges and unlocking more and more complex areas. An extreme sports dog wants a picture of a dog riding a scooter. The old sea-dog at the beach would like a photo of any dog, as long as the lighthouse is in the background. In return for this you get golden bones as a form of currency to buy different kinds of film, or weird lenses, to kick your photography into the next gear.
It&#x27;s cute. It&#x27;s a really nice playground that facilitates the player&#x27;s own creativity. You can pet dogs to make them happy, or find toys to make them do different things: turn on a radio and any furry pals nearby bust out some truly astonishing moves; throw a stick to initiate a huge game of fetch. You post your photos to a kind of dog-centric Instagram for likes and comments (possibly from dogs; possibly from humans). The colourful, chunky art, combined with deliberately stiff animation where nobody can move their joints, really reminds me of Playmobil toys. Despite this carefree, playful tone, I also find it unaccountably sinister.

                    <span>If I ever achieve immortality, there might be time to sit down and work out exactly why some building games grab me and some don&#x27;t. I fear I am too often left with a page of notes that are just variations on the word &quot;vibes&quot;. 
Perhaps some taxonomy would help. Moons Of Ardan is a space colony building game that&#x27;s mostly about balancing production rates by placing buildings. Less dryly, you&#x27;re making a new home for mildly cute little space people on semi-cartoony worlds, where nothing ever really goes wrong and... the vibes. It&#x27;s the vibes, you see.

                    <span>Early access is a mixed bag. Sometimes it&#x27;s an exciting early glimpse, sometimes it feels like supporting a developer or game you care about, and sometimes it can feel more like paying to beta test. That last one won&#x27;t be a concern with Blood Bowl 3, not anymore. The latest adaptation of Games Workshop&#x27;s tabletop fantasy bloodsport was headed to early access but now, naw. The developers are focusing on closed beta testing instead, and will simply launch the game in full once it&#x27;s done.

                    <span>Of the many possibilities that Microsoft buying Activision Blizzard might enable, only one seems really clear: that Microsoft will put Actiblizz games on Game Pass. Beyond that, it&#x27;s all mights and maybes. Here&#x27;s another maybe: Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer says they&#x27;re hoping to dig into Actiblizz&#x27;s &quot;franchises that I love from my childhood,&quot; raising the likes of Hexen and King&#x27;s Quest. What better use for $69 billion than wallowing in nostalgia?

                    <span>Valve are gearing up for the first batch of Steam Decks to be shipped to players next month. Part of the preparation is rolling out their compatibility review program, which will let you know which games on Steam work best with Valve&#x27;s handheld PC. The verification status of the first set of games can now be found via SteamDB, though not yet the Steam interface itself.

                    <span>I missed the announcement in 2020 that among the many game-to-anime adaptations coming our way was Shenmue. Now there&#x27;s a proper trailer for what&#x27;s creatively titled Shenmue The Animation, which just like the original game sets Ryo on his path to avenging his father&#x27;s death.

                    <span>Which came first, the founding of Siemens or the reconstruction of the Palace Of Westminster? And was Finland established as an independent state before or after the birth of Mexican film actress Dolores del Rio?

The answers are &quot;Siemens&quot; and &quot;after&quot;, respectively. These are things I have learned today while playing WikiTrivia, a free browser game by Tom Watson which pulls historical dates from WikiData and challenges you to put them in the correct order.

At the same time as Warner Bros. announced the release date however, Polygon published a lengthy report on extensive crunch suffered by employees working on the game at developers TT Games.

                    <span>Amplitude Studios today released the first proper paid DLC for Humankind, adding new African cultures. Perhaps more importantly than that, they released another patch. A Civilization-esque strategy game from the makers of Endless Space and Endless Legend sounded great but some found it suffered issues with bugs, balance, and general polish. So sure, expanding the game with DLC, sure sure, tell me about making what&#x27;s already there better. Amplitude laid out some of their plans on that front, too.

                    <span>Panic. Panic at the museum reception desk, as the astronaut suit I have belatedly possessed is set upon by a four-strong team of ghost busters. We’re in the opening seconds of the round and only 20 minutes into my Midnight Ghost Hunt hands-on preview, which means I’ve yet to figure out important concepts like ‘where the hunters spawn in’, or nuances like ‘this button lets me hide in props’ as opposed to ‘this button telekinetically waggles props about like ectoplasmic dinner bells’. As ghosts we’re supposed to mostly stay schtum for the five minutes it takes to reach midnight, at which point we get to both metaphorically and literally flip the tables on the living. Instead: panic.

We open an estate agent to appraise the houses in games that would actually be good to live in. It turns out there aren&#x27;t that many. Not a lot of them would be convenient. 
There&#x27;s an excellent Cavern Of Lies this week, in which Nate hosts a game-themed episode of Through The Keyhole in character as Lloyd Grossman/a robot version of Matt Berry. We also have some great diversions and some opening chat about the time my friend was a real life suspect in a murder for a few days. Plus: Matthew had an unpleasant experience watching House Of Gucci.
