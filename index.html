Update : Did You Know Gaming has provided an update - revealing the video has now been restored. YouTube has also apparently confirmed Nintendo was responsible for the copyright takedown:

Did You Know Gaming: &quot;We won. The Heroes of Hyrule video is back up. Thank you to everyone who tweeted about this and the sites that reported on it. We have no doubt that the negative response played a part in Nintendo backing down. Also, YouTube confirmed to us that it was indeed Nintendo and not an imposter.&quot;

                              <span>The new NieR adaptation is right around the corner
NieR fans won&#x27;t have to wait too long into the new year for its anime adaptation to kick off. The NieR: Automata anime has locked in a premiere date for January 7, 2023 in Japan.
A few trailers have been dropping over the holidays for the upcoming anime adaptation of 2017&#x27;s NieR: Automata. The first features 2B and 9S fairly prominently, as two leads we&#x27;ll be following in the Ver. 1.1a anime.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;HGpskkA7vrw
Another new trailer today shows off some of the supporting cast, as well as the opening and ending tracks for the series. Both trailers have a January 7 premiere date set for the adaptation. We already knew it was arriving sometime in January, but it looks like the date is much sooner in the month than one might have expected.
Most of the adaptation is covering some familiar territory, given what we see in the trailers. There is one character, Lily, who appears in the lore but seems to be playing a larger role in the anime. It&#x27;ll be interesting to see how much this Ver 1.1a diverges from the game.
Become as gods
The series looks set to air on Crunchyroll as well as other platforms, though exact distribution plans and dates aren&#x27;t clear just yet. We&#x27;ll have to see just what the global rollout looks like as the series goes live.
NieR: Automata isn&#x27;t the only video game adaptation kicking off in January 2023, either. HBO&#x27;s The Last of Us is set to debut not too long after on January 15, 2023. And the animated Dragon Age: Absolution just recently went live on Netflix, too. It&#x27;s quite the time for video game adaptations, and there&#x27;s even more on the way. Hopefully they can turn out as well as shows like Arcane and Cyberpunk: Edgerunners have.

                              <span>Jedi, nukes, and an ominous future
The new year is almost upon us, and with it a new month of PlayStation Plus titles. Sony has revealed the three games headed to PlayStation Plus to kick off January 2023, including a good way to brush up ahead of a big 2023 release.
Headlining the January 2023 PS Plus offering is Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, the single-player action-adventure game from Respawn following runaway Jedi Cal Kestis. It&#x27;s a good grab for anyone who needs to catch up on the story, as its sequel Jedi: Survivor is due to arrive in March. It&#x27;s not a large window, but Fallen Order should be easy to blast through in that amount of time.
For a little more multiplayer, Fallout 76 heads onto PS4. Though there&#x27;s been an ongoing tussle over the Microsoft-Activision Blizzard acquisition, Bethesda&#x27;s multiplayer Fallout will be free to grab for PlayStation Plus users in the month of January 2023.
Closing out the month is Axiom Verge 2, the follow-up to the first Axiom Verge. While it takes a more action-platforming approach with fewer guns and more exploration, it&#x27;s still a solid experience worth checking out if you enjoy exploring a map and ticking off squares.

A new year of Plus
While those three games head to every category under PlayStation&#x27;s tiered Plus system, more is on the way for those at the higher tiers. The PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium lineup for January is set to be announced soon.
These PlayStation Plus games, meanwhile, go live on January 3, 2023. And if you haven&#x27;t yet, there&#x27;s still time to add Mass Effect: Legendary Edition and the other December PlayStation Plus games to your library before they go away.

                              <span>The Harry Potter books, and the universe they spawned, are beloved by millions. It’s so unfortunate, then, that the franchise’s creator, author J.K. Rowling, has repeatedly proven herself to be the worst kind of anti-transgender bigot. That bigotry is in the spotlight once again as the big-ticket Harry Potter game …

The horizons of my video game tastes have broadened pretty significantly over the past few years, but my undying love for narrative games first and foremost has never wavered. While 2022 has been a great year for games in general, from heavy hitters like Elden Ring and God of War Ragnarok to indie darlings like Cult of the Lamb and Vampire Survivors, I think this past year has been one of the best we&#x27;ve seen for narrative games in a good while due to the breadth of stories that were told both thematically and mechanically.
Whether those stories were rooted in lighthearted, optimistic sentimentality or a grounded, gritty introspection, I was reminded time and time again why I&#x27;m so excited for games to continue paving the way forward as our youngest and most dyna…</span>

                              <span>Retro compendium jettin&#x27; west via ININ Games
Veteran publisher Taito, in conjunction with developer M2, has released a teaser trailer for its upcoming shmup compilation Ray&#x27;z Arcade Chronology. The classic shmup series take to the stars once again when it launches in Japan on PS4 and Nintendo Switch in March 2023.
As we have previously reported, Ray’z Arcade Chronology compiles the three original titles from the franchise — namely RayForce (1994), RayStorm (1996) and RayCrisis (1998) — with a newly revamped edition of the 2013 remaster RayStorm HD, complete with brand new features including a classic 4:3 screen ratio and the original arcade dipswitch settings. The compendium is then rounded out with a brand new remaster of RayCrisis, titled RayCrisis HD, specifically developed for this new release.
Ray’z Arcade Chronology will launch in Japan March 9, 2023, on PS4 and Nintendo Switch. Western fans of the pew-pew persuasion need not fret, as publisher ININ Games has already confirmed that it will be localizing the collection for western release, although a specific launch date is yet to be announced.

I love dark winter nights. If it&#x27;s below freezing with snow piled on the window sills and wind whipping through frozen tree branches, then even better. I definitely don&#x27;t want to be out in those conditions, but late December evenings are the perfect backdrop to some of my favorite winter traditions. I&#x27;ve abandoned a lot of those tinsel-covered activities and replaced them with things that I like more.
While my list continues to grow, it currently includes playing Nick Offerman&#x27;s &quot;Yule Log&quot;, gifting new clothes to loved ones to protect them from the Yule Cat, and reading ghost stories on Christmas Eve. I&#x27;ve adopted these things over the years from my hobbies and from the stories people tell me. Now they bring me joy when I need joy the most.

                              <span>Could you be the next Original Starla?
The Guilty Gear franchise is renowned for its bizarre arsenal of stylish weaponry, from Faust&#x27;s 10-foot scalpel to Ino&#x27;s satanic shredder, but perhaps one of the most ingenious tools belongs to the delightful young bounty hunter Bridget, in the form of her trick-shot-tastic Bullet Yo-Yo.
And, if you fancy taking an eye or two out yourself, then hobby crafter SpinGear has you covered, as the Japanese yo-yo specialist is now taking pre-orders on an exceptionally cool-looking replica of Bridget&#x27;s weapon of choice. The &quot;Full Metal Bridget Mini Yo-Yo&quot; is an authentic (if smaller) replica of our girl&#x27;s face-flicker, faithfully recreating the six-shooter style of its casing and cast in solid metal.
Check out the ace toy/death dealer in action in this official video, complete with Bridget cosplay!

So if you fancy picking one up, hurting yourself, and realizing you&#x27;re just as terrible with the yo-yo now as you were with that Coca-Cola one in 1991, then head on over to the official YOYOSHOP SPINGEAR website, where you can pre-order the Full Metal Bridget Yo-Yo for ¥44,000 or... erm... $330 USD... Well, if that seems a little on the pricey side for you, then a far simpler design is also expected in January, priced at a somewhat cheaper ¥4,400, or $32.
&quot;We understand pre-order expensive yoyo feels little scary.&quot; explains the website. Yer-darn-tootin&#x27;. But, hey, you can&#x27;t put a price on knocking mum&#x27;s favorite vase off the mantle.
Guilty Gear Strive is available now on PlayStation and PC platforms. An Xbox port arrives spring 2023.
Oh, and don&#x27;t forget to check out our previous report on this cute Bridget fan animation.

                              <span>Slowly rolling backwards on the year
Another year has come to a close, and so we&#x27;re looking back at the breadth of games we saw throughout these last 12 months. Many came and went, and gradually, I&#x27;ve managed to whittle the crowd down to something resembling my ten favorite games of 2022.
It wasn&#x27;t an easy task, to be honest. Sure, this year saw the delay of multiple big-name projects into 2023. I&#x27;m a bit grateful for that though, as it at least gave me time to spend on some smaller indie releases. And wow, did they come out swinging.
This year was the year of small games, tactics games, story-driven and narrative titles, and more. I played a lot of games this year that felt like they were pushing forward, whether through new mechanics and ideas or just pushing hardware to its limits. Sitt…</span>

                              <span>Case proceeding against Sonic the Hedgehog co-creator
Former Sega veteran Yuji Naka has been formally indicted following their arrest earlier this month for suspected insider trading. The indictment was reported yesterday by Japan&#x27;s NHK news corporation.
Naka was first arrested in November as part of an investigation into insider trading at studio Square Enix, led by the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors’ Office Investigation Department. Naka, along with two further SE employees named as Taisuke Sazaki and Fumiaki Suzuki, was arrested under suspicion of purchasing stock in Japanese studio Aiming, right before Square announced that the developer was working on a new title in the Dragon Quest series, Dragon Quest: Tact.
At the start of December, Naka was re-arrested after the investigation uncovered further evidence suggesting that the Sonic the Hedgehog co-creator had purchased 120,000 shares in developer ATeam ahead of the announcement that said studio would be producing mobile release Final Fantasy VII: The First Soldier. The shares in question were valued at around ¥144.7 million yen ($834,000 USD).
&quot;We have been fully cooperating with requests from the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission,&quot; said Square Enix in a statement published in November. “As the investigation by the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office is underway, we will continue to fully cooperate with their investigation.&quot;
&quot;We deeply regret the great concern this has caused to all concerned. We have dealt with this incident strictly, including internal disciplinary actions taken against the suspected employees.&quot;
It is currently not known when or if Naka will stand trial for these charges. Yuji Naka left Square Enix in 2021, following the critical and commercial failure Balan Wonderworld. Naka would later file suit against Square Enix, arguing that they had removed him from development six months ahead of release.

As the year&#x27;s end shuffles into view, number-crunching firms are taking a look back at the last 12 months to recognize patterns, facts, and figures as they pertain to gaming, retail, prices, sales, and player behavior — And a new report from the statisticians at NewZoo offers up some interesting reading.
NewZoo places its estimate for the global games market value at a staggering $184.4 billion USD. This accounts for almost game sales, on PC, console, and mobile platforms. It should also be noted that this already impressive figure does not take into account Nintendo game sales, as the publisher has always been weirdly prudish when it comes to revealing its own bottom line.

Of this total market value, $51.8 billion manifested through console games, with a further $38.2 billion pulled in by downloaded/boxed PC titles, and $2.3 billion from browser-based PC games. Of course, mobile gaming takes the lion&#x27;s share, with a massive $92.2 billion in total revenue. This sector was led by the continued dominance of titles such as TiMi Studios&#x27; Honor of Kings, and PUBG Corporation&#x27;s PUBG Mobile, which continue to earn billions year-on-year from the global market.
When it comes specifically to console gaming, around 72% of all game sales were digital downloads, with only the remained 28% accounting for physical releases. This continues a trend we have witnessed for many years now, with each consecutive year seeing more and more customers opting for digital game purchases over boxed copies. Again, this figure does not include Nintendo Switch software, which represents perhaps the last real bastion of high-street retail gaming purchases.

                              <span>Zuh?
The jury is out on pretty much every detail regarding Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, but we might have another piece of the puzzle if this ad is legit. Reddit user Few_Working3350 has apparently located an ad, which showcases some form of Nintendo Switch Online functionality for the game.
The ad seems to be Dutch in origin, with the standard marketing phrase &quot;Haal meer uit je Nintendo Switch,&quot; which roughly translates to &quot;get more out of your Nintendo Switch!&quot; The ad then highlights some form of Switch Online functionality, with a big banner. If true, it could be anything; possibly even some form of asynchronous mechanic similar to the Souls series. It could also be an erroneous local ad that explains that you can connect online and download future DLC. We&#x27;ve reached out to Nintendo for clarification on the matter.

We&#x27;re still half a year away from Tears of the Kingdom
The next big entry in the Zelda franchise is due out on May 13, 2023, and you can bet we&#x27;ll be seeing some showcases for it: maybe as early as this January.
Nintendo has a lot of confidence going into this release given all the good will they&#x27;ve generated from Breath of the Wild, so this seems like it&#x27;ll be a pretty easy slam dunk. I mean, if they rework weapon durability and add real dungeons, this game will potentially soar even higher.

                              <span>But move swiftly and efficiently if you want it
As Epic Games Store continues its holiday tradition of offering up a free game every day, today give sits users the opportunity to bag the high-speed, stunt-mechanic action-fest Severed Steel, which is available to claim for the next few hours directly from the EGS dashboard.
Developed by Chicago-based Greylock Studio and released in the spring of last year, Severed Steel is a first-person shooter of the speed &#x27;n&#x27; style vernacular. That is to say, it occupies the same territory as games such as High Hell, Ghostrunner, and SuperHOT where the speed, accuracy, and efficiency of the player&#x27;s movement are equally as important as simply staying alive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;2Yr9olh1yqk&amp;ab_channel&#x3D;Digerati
Set in a future-noir world, players control the vengeance-fuelled protagonist Steel, who has lost an arm to an accident manufactured by the omnipotent corporation EdenSys. Outfitted with an energy cannon to replace the missing limb, Steel sets out on a one-woman-vendetta against EdenSys, eradicating its operations and liberating those crushed beneath its metal heels. This translates to a slickly designed, hugely destructible environments and highly stylized and explosive FPS action, all backed by a fantastic, adrenaline-pumping score.
So If you fancy ringing a few ears as you ring in the new year, then head on over to Epic Games Store right now and bag Severed Steel gratis, you have just a few more hours before it will be replaced by the next offering. Severed Steel is also available now on PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.

Before I delve into a game, I like to know roughly how long it&#x27;s going to take me to complete, so HowLongToBeat.com has been a staple of my gaming experience for years. While I usually use the website to get an estimate of how many hours I&#x27;m about to invest in a title, turns out you can glean a lot of information about how many people played a game, and how many actually finished it, too. One game&#x27;s HowLongToBeat page has been getting some attention, and that title shouldn&#x27;t come as a surprise to anyone who&#x27;s been even remotely connected to the gaming industry this year: Elden Ring.

You might already be familiar with one, and that&#x27;s Jacob, the Lenny Kravitz-inspired character featured in the re-reveal trailer for Dead Island 2. During my cover story trip, I played roughly seven hours of Dead Island 2, but I didn&#x27;t go hands-on with Jacob. I did, however, play a few hours with both Dani and Ryan, two very different survivors that add their own flair to the story of this zomb-pocalypse. 
I came out of this cover story trip convinced Dani is the survivor for me, but Ryan is great, too. And there are still the other four survivors I didn&#x27;t get to play. Nonetheless, I want to tell you about Ryan, and Dambuster Studios does, too (read about Dani here)

                              <span>Each mainline entry of the Street Fighter series is an important milestone in the fighting game genre. Though every numbered entry received critical acclaim, Street Fighter V sticks out among fans as the outlier of the series; the game experienced perhaps the most tumultuous launch of any Street Fighter game to date. But out of that trouble emerged something great. Thanks to the team’s persistence, post-launch roadmap, and an injection of new blood into the project&#x27;s leadership, Street Fighter V drastically improved its core gameplay, online play, content offerings, and more throughout its six-year lifespan.
With the benefit of those lessons learned, many team members that righted the ship are back to develop Street Fighter 6. The latest entry delivers myriad improvements, new features, and a sleek new aesthetic while simultaneously acknowledging and paying homage to each entry before it. Street Fighter 6 feels like yet another evolution of the fighting game genre ushered in by the franchise that pioneered it in the first place. Read more...</span>

                              <span>It’s the end of May, and I’m watching the credits roll in Elden Ring. After more than 150 hours roaming the Lands Between, I feel the familiar bittersweetness that occurs anytime I finish a game I love. I’d conquered unimaginable horrors and become Elden Lord in my own personalized adventure, all while cruising atop a cool double-jumping steed; now what? Recovering from this high would become a personal struggle for the remainder of the year.
Elden Ring dominated my life. When I wasn’t playing it, it was the only thing I wanted to do. When I chipped away at other games for work or pleasure, tasks like gaining access to Raya Lucaria Academy or conquering Malenia were in the back of my mind. I stopped eating Red Lobster because it caused me to suffer terrible flashbacks of getting relentless…</span>

                              <span>Just in time for the new year, Sony has revealed the next batch of free games coming to PlayStation Plus. Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, Fallout 76, and Axiom Verge 2 will be available to download for all tiers of PS Plus starting Tuesday, January 3. PlayStation has not announced the new titles coming to the Extra and Premium tiers, but says that they&#x27;ll be &quot;announced soon.&quot; You can read the full blog post here.
Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is a notable inclusion because its sequel, Jedi: Survivor, is set to come out in March. This PS Plus offering is an ideal opportunity for players to check out the first before visiting the second. If you played the game at launch, this is also a chance to check out the updates that introduced upgraded graphics and performance for PS5, as well as updates that added New Journey+ and challenge modes. You can read our original review here.
This is also a friendly reminder to claim December&#x27;s PS Plus titles: Divine Knockout, Biomutant, and Mass Effect: Legendary Edition. They&#x27;ll all be available until January 3, the day the new games are added, so be sure to grab them before that.</span>

                              <span>Mortal Kombat was not supposed to die. Many regard Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe as one of the lowest points of the series. Its minigame-centric fights and awkward movement were damning, but it also lacked the silly, over-the-top violence Mortal Kombat is known for – a sad reality for appeasing license holder Warner Bros. Batman can cripple impoverished criminals, but he can’t be cut in half by Tarkatan blades.
It would have been disappointing to end on an ill-fated crossover, but Midway’s untimely demise could have made that so. Layoffs, uncertainty, and publisher implosion aren’t how franchises live; it’s how they die. But the then-newly formed NetherRealm Studios reinvigorated the entire franchise after its darkest period with one of its most beloved entries: the 2011 reboot, Mortal Kombat 9. Read more...</span>

The Russian cinema business was hit hard by these restrictions but with some tricks and help from &quot;friendly&quot; neighbors, pirated copies of &quot;Avatar: The Way of Water&quot; have found their way onto the big screen.

Did something make these domains especially vulnerable or are seizures like this the new reality?

Early in 2022, we put out a list of 14 games we&#x27;d love to have on Switch. Since then, we&#x27;ve got at least five of them on Switch, so we&#x27;re either prescient or powerful. So, in hopes that 2023 will be similarly rewarding, we&#x27;re aiming this feature at you, Doug Bowser — we&#x27;d love to see the following games ported onto Nintendo&#x27;s hybrid console. You don&#x27;t even have to credit us, we&#x27;re just that nice.

Another year has come and gone and, as per tradition, it&#x27;s naturally got us thinking about which games struck a chord with us over the past twelve months.
We&#x27;ve already taken a good look at some of the best games according to the editorial staff, and we&#x27;ve also compiled a reader-ranked list of the top fifty Nintendo Switch games as voted for by you fine folks. If that wasn&#x27;t enough, we&#x27;ve also provided our very own &quot;alternative&quot; game awards for 2022, including the likes of &#x27;Best Soundtrack&#x27;, &#x27;Best Use of $5&#x27;, &#x27;Best DOOM Clone&#x27;, and more.

                              <span>Unsurprisingly, Splatoon and Pokémon dominate.
Nintendo has shared its annual Switch eShop sales rankings for Japan earlier today, and if you&#x27;ve been keeping an eye on the news over the last 12 months, then there will be no surprises here. Splatoon 3 is 2022&#x27;s best-selling game on the eShop, which shouldn&#x27;t be a shock given that it broke records in both physical and digital sales when it first launched.
Right behind Splatoon is January&#x27;s Pokémon Legends: Arceus, with Pokémon Violet taking the third spot (Scarlet is in fourth as both games are counted separately). Monster Hunter Rise, last year&#x27;s number one, rounds out the top five, likely thanks to Sunbreak&#x27;s launch over the summer. These rankings are based on sales on the eShop between January 1, 2022 and December 20, 2022.

In a world of annual releases and mandated sequels, The Punchuin, the latest release from Shin&#x27;en (Fast RMX, The Touryst), feels like a real passion project. It&#x27;s a charming love letter to puzzle game fans with an incredible amount of heart put into it. But despite that, once you start peeling back the layers, you’re left with a great core gameplay loop that is too lacking in content to feel like a finished project.
In The Punchuin, you take direct control of a penguin who is quite fond of punching and sets out to look for the treasure hidden in the depths of Punch Mountain. With the help of a giant sentient boxing glove, you tackle multiple challenges to collect diamonds from each level in order to pass the various gates blocking your path further down. The plot, while simple, serves its purpose quite well, and is helped tremendously by the wonderfully endearing and witty dialogue.

A severe vulnerability affecting several Nintendo consoles was found recently, with the potential to allow unauthorised access to Switch, 3DS, and Wii U via a host of online games. It&#x27;s reported that for some time Nintendo has been working to patch games to eliminate the exploit known as &#x27;ENLBufferPwn&#x27;, with several updates already live to address the situation (thanks, Nintendo Everything).
The vulnerability, which has been categorised as &#x27;Critical&#x27; on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) and detailed in full on GitHub by PabloMK7, Rambo6Glaz, and Fishguy6564, reportedly exposes a victim&#x27;s device to complete remote control by simply playing an online game with a potential attacker. This means that attackers may gain access to sensitive information or take audio and video recordings by remotely executing code.

The latest UK boxed charts are in and there is very little change in the wind this week, with FIFA 23, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II, and God of War Ragnarok all leading the market once again.
The only major change of note is the fresh inclusion of both Sonic Frontiers and Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope in the top ten, thanks to both titles being reduced in retail to prices hovering around the £30 mark. With Sonic Frontiers specifically, the Nintendo Switch version once again sold the most, accounting for 44% of the sales split across all available platforms.

                              <span>Fairy/Steel type Tinkaton takes out the top spot.
With more than 1,000 Pokémon in existence nowadays, it&#x27;s probably hard for a lot of trainers to narrow down a list of their favourites. Japan made it a little bit easier recently with a poll exclusively focused on the new releases Pokémon Scarlet and Violet.
In the top 10, there were old favourites like Lucario and Sylveon mixed in with some ninth-generation pocket monsters. In third was Meowscarada - the evolution of the new grass starter, in second place was Clodsire - evolving from the Paldea Wooper, and in first was the best girl, Tinkaton (see above).

In a recent interview with Denfaminicogamer, the legendary video game developer Masahiro Sakurai apparently confirmed he is now semi-retired.
He elaborated on this, mentioning how he worked on the Super Smash Bros. series for around nine years between the 3DS/Wii U and Switch release, along with the DLC updates. Sakurai feels he&#x27;s got to draw the line somewhere, or else he&#x27;ll simply run out of time to live his own life.

Japanese publication Famitsu has posted its usual end-of-year creator interviews with prominent local developers and once again, it&#x27;s provided some insight to the year ahead.
Koji Igarashi - known for his work on the Castlevania series and more recently the troubled Kickstarter project Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night - mentions how he wants to wrap up work on the &quot;remaining content&quot; for Bloodstained, which will apparently lead the team to &quot;the next step&quot; (translation via Gematsu).

The Switch Pro was heavily rumoured not so long ago as a mid-generation upgrade on the existing Switch console, which launched in 2017.
Reports suggested that Nintendo was planning to release a more powerful variant with an improved screen, but, despite numerous sources seemingly corroborating this - including developers who had apparently been told about it - no Switch Pro was forthcoming, and the arrival of the OLED edition seemed to indicate that another hardware update wouldn&#x27;t be on the way for a while.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been looking back over an entire year of RPS reviews and, well, we&#x27;ve written a lot. Over the past twelve months, the RPS treehouse and our merry band of freelancers have reviewed 168 games in total - and that includes early access reviews, PC-port reviews, group reviews, reviews-in-progresses, and your common or garden fully-fledged reviews. 168! Damn. Even though game releases are still suffering from pandemic pushbacks, 2022 has been a busy year for games. There wasn&#x27;t a huge number of big name releases - although the ones that did come out were plenty big enough - but, as always, we&#x27;ve had a wealth of wonderful indies releasing all year round, and we scooped up as many of them as we could.
Out of all the games we’ve given any kind of review treatment throughout the year, only a handful of them recieved RPS’s coveted Bestest Best badge; just 22, to be exact. I&#x27;ve gathered them all in one big round-up bundle below (there are round-ups of our favourite bits from other sections of the site, too), and they make a great collection of games. Have a scroll and click on any that take your fancy for the full review. Enjoy!

                              <span>It’s my first RPS Christmas Advent Calendar, whoooo! I feel so honored - and I’m pretty happy with how the GOTY 2022 Calendar turned out, as most of my top choices made it into the roster. However, great games are sure to fall by the wayside in any year - which is why we have our Selection Boxes of honorable mentions this year, right? For my picks I&#x27;ve swept up three quite different games, but I think they come together to give a very Rachel vibe.

                              <span>A little known fact is that all of the RPS staff are complex clockwork automata, designed and built by a little gnome with the kind of inch-thick glasses that make your eyes look comically large. We&#x27;re each powered by a spell that lasts but 12 months, so every Christmas we fall over like sad marionettes. The gnome has to spend a couple of weeks trekking up a mountain to see the fairy who can recast the spells on us. You can help fund his sled dogs and provisions by becoming a member of the RPS supporter program. While he&#x27;s away, we&#x27;ve prepared some Christmas Crackers for you.
Time to enjoy your lovely joke!

                              <span>Trombone Champ is a good joke. I played it once, chuckled along with its simulated tooting, and haven&#x27;t felt any compulsion to return. 

I will click on any Trombone Champ video I come across online, however. Armed with some community-made modding tools, creative players have added custom songs to the game, with custom models and backgrounds. At their best, these videos turn a good joke into a complete comedy sketch. And the person making them at their best is Gloomhonk.

                              <span>In late November we saw incredible prices on the Ryzen 7000 series, and now we&#x27;re getting even better deals on many of these processors. The one I&#x27;m highlighting today is the Ryzen 5 7600X, which is down to £249 at Amazon - significantly below its £350 RRP and £21 cheaper than it was for Black Friday.

                              <span>Portable SSDs are a brilliant way to ferry files around, but often they&#x27;re a bit overkill if you&#x27;re just copying a game directory to another PC, bringing a video file to watch on TV or backing up your schoolwork. 
In this case, a fast USB-C flash drive can be just the thing, with the newfangled connection allowing use on a wide range of devices like phones, tablets and games consoles too. Case in point is Samsung&#x27;s 128GB model, which is reduced to £12 today from its usual price of £20.

                              <span>Hello! VidBud Liam here. You may recognise me from those videos that autoplay on every page. Or not. It depends on how quickly you scroll past, I suppose. 


I joined team Arpus all the way back in February, and to say the last 11 months have been a whirlwind is a bit of an understatement. In less than a year I’ve made just under 90 videos covering a wide range of topics from major releases to international gaming events and brand-new hardware. My first year at RPS has been busy, basically. So when Katharine asked me to pull together a few of my personal highlights, I was kind of stumped. It&#x27;s hard to pick favourites! It&#x27;s even harder to celebrate my own achievements, but that&#x27;s beside the point.

                              <span>Don’t look at me, I’m just the hardware guy. But I do recommend looking at these, my favourite also-ran games that weren’t quite team-impressing enough to win a spot on the RPS Advent Calendar 2022. Out of everything I played this year, these are the avatars of adequacy, the sultans of satisfactory. The prime ministers of pretty good. 
I’d probably also tip a hat to Warhammer 40K: Darktide, but Alice0 already nabbed it for her honourable mentions, and frankly there’s enough shootybang stuff here as it is. But, also: toilet build quality testing, pushing Nazis into cement pits, and more than a hint of 70s funk. Check ‘em out.

                              <span>Listen, I don&#x27;t have much time. I enjoyed a lot of games this year, but Alice just told me that if I spend more than 1,500 words on this list then she&#x27;s going to murder my whole family*. And that includes some people I like.
So without ado: here&#x27;s a handful of the games I enjoyed the most this year which (crushingly) didn&#x27;t quite make their way into our soft &#x27;n&#x27; snuggly RPS Advent Calendar 2022.

                              <span>A little known fact is that all of the RPS staff are complex clockwork automata, designed and built by a little gnome with the kind of inch-thick glasses that make your eyes look comically large. We&#x27;re each powered by a spell that lasts but 12 months, so every Christmas we fall over like sad marionettes. The gnome has to spend a couple of weeks trekking up a mountain to see the fairy who can recast the spells on us. You can help fund his sled dogs and provisions by becoming a member of the RPS supporter program. While he&#x27;s away, we&#x27;ve prepared some Christmas Crackers for you.
Time to enjoy your lovely joke!

                              <span>A small problem
I have always had a bit of trouble playing older games.
This might not come as a surprise to some discerning Destructoid readers, who have, in the past, derided me for the recency bias seemingly on display in a handful of my ranked lists. It&#x27;s true — I do tend to play more new releases than older ones, and I tend to enjoy them more, as well. Call it an occupational hazard (it&#x27;s easier to write about new games when you&#x27;re playing them on release), chalk it up to my age (I am, as you might imagine, younger than many readers), but the fact stands: I prefer more modern titles.

Of course, this isn&#x27;t a moral failing, but it is a bit of a problem. See, I am the kind of person who takes a great interest in figuring out why things are the way they are. Anthropologically, I&#x27;m fascin…</span>

                              <span>The lizard&#x27;s glide gets an upgrade
The vast, open world of Paldea is open for exploring. And if fast travel is too slow for you, then this latest Pokemon Scarlet and Violet glitch may be more your speed.
Players have been utilizing a trick that essentially turns your legendary, either Koraidon or Miraidon, into a fighter jet. This speed glitch started gaining popularity recently thanks to Twitter user @yuudainano, though they note that others discovered it before their post gained traction.
Essentially, the idea is to dash and leap off a high point in Pokemon Scarlet / Violet. (I recommend the highest peak in Paldea, up in the snowy mountains.) Deploy the glider, then cut it and turn, then redeploy and whip Miraidon or Koraidon back around in the process.

You know those &quot;year in review&quot; tools, and how they&#x27;re all called something different? Well Steam just unleashed theirs out into the world, and it&#x27;s going to be a doozy for most Steam users: since, you know, there&#x27;s probably a lot of games lingering on your Steam accounts.
The &quot;Steam Replay&quot; feature showcases several aspects of your 2022 gaming habits:
Highlights of your most-played games/genres and how many games you played
Your percentage of keyboard + mouse use compared to a controller
How many achievements you unlocked
A full breakdown of your most-played games (with graphs!)
How you compare to the Steam average in terms of games played, achievements unlocked, and play streaks
The comparison data is interesting, as the average amount of achievements unlocked per Steam player in 2022 is 21, the average amount of games played was five, and the longest streak is nine days.

How to access your Steam Replay recap:
You can find it right here at this link.
Or, you can locate it in the Steam app itself.
There are a few provisos to keep in mind for your 2022 Steam Replay chart:
&quot;Steam Replay 2022 includes all of your play time between the first second of January 1 and the last second of December 14&quot;
&quot;Steam Replay does not include any playtime played in offline mode or when disconnected from internet&quot;
&quot;Steam Replay excludes time spent running tools and other types of non-game software. It also excludes games that are unreleased or disabled.&quot;

Here’s a thing that someone writing for a gaming website probably shouldn’t say: I didn’t play many new games in 2022.
It’s been a tough year. I’m sure I’m not the only person who had trouble getting back on their feet after that whole COVID thing threw the world into upheaval, and it certainly impacted my gaming habits. Had I known I’d be on the front page of Destructoid, I would have spent less time chipping away at my years-long backlog. Yet here I am, and regardless of the quantity of new games I played, I feel very strongly about the quality of the ones I did.
I’m playing fast and loose with what a &quot;Game of 2022&quot; is. Otherwise, I&#x27;d have to make up fake games in RPG Maker to fill out this list. Without further ado, here are my standout game…</span>

Waking up in the morning to the phrase &quot;help I&#x27;m stuck in an Applebee&#x27;s&quot; would normally be a terrifying prospect: but since it&#x27;s taking place in-game in High on Life, it&#x27;s a little less serious.
As pointed out by PCGamesN, some High on Life players seem to be having issues getting stuck in the Space Applebee&#x27;s location: one of the many absurd parodies the game offers. Normally you&#x27;re supposed to go inside the Applebee&#x27;s as part of the critical path storyline (which is normally closed/locked), then leave (with the option to pay your check). But some folks on Steam are reporting that they cannot exit the space, and are doomed to an eternity of eating digital jalapeno poppers and potato skins.
Here&#x27;s a great recap of one person&#x27;s predicament:
&quot;I had just paid the bill in applebees and rescued a human in a cage outside of the store in the slums. i jumped into the portal where the humans go and was jetpacking up the ledges above them when i was teleported into applebees with all closed doors and no way out. i have reloaded save, stuck in applebys [sic] still. Reinstalled, same deal any way to get out of here??&quot;

Not once did I expect to write anything remotely like this in 2022, especially since my nearest Applebee&#x27;s is abandoned.
This is one of many technical issues with High on Life
Jokes aside, I ran into many technical oddities in High on Life, both before the day one patch during the review period, and after. It really helps that it&#x27;s a Game Pass game, because spending $60 on this and having it glitch this badly for some folks wouldn&#x27;t be great! Hopefully there&#x27;s a patch on the way for the Applebee&#x27;s fiasco.

It might be the holidays, but there is still money to made, and as such the battle between Microsoft and various global regulators — butting heads over the former&#x27;s $68.7 billion purchase of Activision Blizzard — rages on, becoming more complex as the parties draw lines around the proposed merger.
Microsoft has filed its official response to the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC), one of the regulators that are currently holding the sale to scrutiny as part of its antitrust investigations. Microsoft&#x27;s statement displays frustration with ongoing accusations that the purchase would create a monopoly over the market, while reiterating that the publisher has no desire to withhold golden goose franchise Call of Duty from other gaming platforms.

Epic Games Store is continuing its Holiday campaign of rolling out a free game for each and every day of the season — And today&#x27;s offering is an unsung doozy, as users can bag themselves a free copy of TiGames dystopian metroidvania F.I.S.T. Forged in Shadow Torch.
Released on PlayStation and PC in the fall of 2021, before being ported to the Switch earlier this year, F.I.S.T. is an anthropomorphic adventure set against the backdrop of a miserable and repressed cityscape, battered and bruised by the hand of an omnipresent corporation known as &quot;Legion&quot;. The working class civilians and fallen soldiers of war do what they can to keep their heads down and eik out a meager existence beneath the polluted skies and clanking machinery that rules with a literal iron fist.

It&#x27;s the second Sunday in May, which means it&#x27;s Mother&#x27;s Day in a great many countries around the world (although not in the UK, where Mothering Sunday falls in March). We&#x27;re celebrating Mother&#x27;s Day this year in a very special way and looking back fondly on one particular Mother that Nintendo fans around the world are united in their adoration of — Shigesato Itoi&#x27;s MOTHER series.

The thing with Game of the Year awards is that it pre-supposes that we are all adults with lots of free time to keep up with the ever-increasing firehose of game releases. You would think that games journalists, of all the types of adult, would be more on top of this than most... and you would be wrong! Like any other person, we get waylaid, sidetracked, postponed, and backlogged, spending hours playing this hot new thing called Skyrim instead of checking out Elden Ring.
If you&#x27;re familiar with our semi-regular Backlog Club series, you&#x27;ll know we&#x27;ve spent a good chunk of this year playing non-2022 games. So, in honour of the games that dominated our 2022, but aren&#x27;t eligible for this year&#x27;s GOTY, we present to you the horribly-titled &quot;Best Non-2022 Switch Game We Played A Whole Bunch&quot; 2022 Game Of Not-This-Year Awards.

May is Mental Health Awareness Month, and as part of our mental health coverage, I spoke to two psychologists from Take This — a non-profit dedicated to reducing the stigma of mental health in the gaming community, as well as raising awareness of the areas in which games and mental health intersect — about all the good things video games can do for your mental health. You&#x27;ve probably heard all the bad ones already!

When I first heard about the &quot;Twin Peaks-meets-Winnie the Pooh&quot; cuddly adventure Beacon Pines, you could say that I was more than a little intrigued. I watched the trailer, read the synopsis, and looked at the key art. It all looked very cute, but what was this sense of mystery bubbling away under the surface? The idea that everything is perhaps not as cuddly as it seemed? It was this that pulled me into the world of Beacon Pines and didn&#x27;t let me go until I had rounded out every ounce of the story.

Looking back over nearly four decades of video game output from Nintendo in both hardware and software form, it&#x27;s easy to pick out highlights, both historical and personal. Super Mario Bros. was a seminal release in the history of the medium; A Link To The Past codified the design template that the Zelda series would use for the next two decades; GoldenEye 007 helped birth the competitive multiplayer shooter genre that would go on to dominate gaming for multiple generations; and so on and so forth.

                              <span>I am, admittedly, new to the world of Final Fantasy VII. I have vague memories of seeing a TV commercial for the original PlayStation game when I was young and remember playing the game’s first few hours in a friend’s attic between Mat Hoffman’s Pro BMX sessions. It wasn’t until much later, when I found an inexpensive green label copy at a Circuit City, that I gave it another shot, but, again, I only made it through the first few hours. When Square Enix released it in such a way that I could play it on my PlayStation 3 and move it over to my PSP, I made it the furthest. I left Midgar, saved my game, and turned off my PSP, fully lying to myself that I would pick it back up again soon. That was more than 10 years ago.
All of that is to say my understanding of the world of Final Fantasy VII i…</span>

                              <span>If you walked into an arcade in the 1990s, it undoubtedly had a Street Fighter II cabinet. If you went at the right time, you probably even saw a crowd gathered around it. As one of the most profitable games in arcade history, Street Fighter II drew more than its fair share of quarters and tokens during the arcade heyday. But the franchise transcends that one moment in time. To say that Street Fighter has sparked multiple revolutions in its genre throughout its history is not far-fetched.
Arcades aren’t omnipresent the way they once were, but the Street Fighter name has endured the ever-shifting grounds of the games industry. The fierce fistfights made the leap from mall game rooms to the living room, the internet, and even tournaments broadcast to massive, international audiences. As the franchise turns 35 years old, we met with the people involved to understand the series’ origins and how it remains relevant three-and-a-half decades later. Read more...</span>

                              <span>Microsoft’s road to acquire Activision Blizzard has been a rocky one, to say the least. The most recent (and significant) roadblock comes from the American Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which filed a lawsuit a few weeks ago to prevent the deal from going through. Now, Microsoft has fired back with a response, saying the FTC is violating their fifth amendment rights to due process. 
The full document (which you can read here) claims that the deal should be allowed to go through for several other reasons as well, stating that Xbox and Activision Blizzard are “just two of hundreds of game publishers.” The claims that the FTC violates the constitution are listed on page 34 and are just a handful of defenses against the lawsuit in a list of two dozen.

                              <span>The story of Cuphead is indie gaming legend. Brothers Chad and Jared Moldenhauer worked for years, risking their finances founding Studio MDHR and hiring a host of talented artists and animators to bring their tough-as-nails run ‘n’ gun game to life. The gamble paid off in spades. Inspired by both 1930s animation and classic games like Contra and Gunstar Heroes, Cuphead has sold more than six million copies, amassing critical acclaim, legions of fans, a TV show, and multiple world records along the way.
With Cuphead’s staggering success, it’s not too surprising the team at MDHR wanted to deliver one more serving of sharp shooting excitement and aggravation. Opting for DLC as opposed to a full-on sequel, the Cuphead developer set about outlining The Delicious Last Course, released in June 2022. Early in production, MDHR decided that a boss concept from the original game, one scrapped due to time constraints, would be the perfect starting point for this newest outing. Read more...</span>

                              <span>Dead Island 2 will feature six playable survivors right from the jump. You might already be familiar with one, and that&#x27;s Jacob, the Lenny Kravitz-esque character featured in the re-reveal trailer for Dead Island 2. During my cover story trip, I played roughly seven hours of Dead Island 2, but I didn&#x27;t go hands-on with Jacob. I did, however, play a few hours with both Dani and Ryan, two very different survivors that add their own flair to the story of this zomb-pocalypse. 
I came out of this cover story trip convinced Dani is the survivor for me, but Ryan was great, too. And there are still the other four survivors I didn&#x27;t get to play. Nonetheless, I want to tell you about Dani, and Dambuster Studios does, too (read about Ryan here).

                              <span>Even though it’s a remake of a game released in 2013 for the PlayStation 3, The Last of Us Part I is, in most respects, the same game as the original The Last of Us. Players first experiencing the game through the remake will understand the plot in much the same way. They follow the same story to the same conclusion, meeting the same characters and feeling many of the same feelings. They experience the same vision of a post-apocalyptic United States, where one traumatized man, Joel, reckons with his inability to part with his surrogate daughter, Ellie.
But even a remake sticking as close to the original script and general design of its original as Part I is, ultimately, a new game in its own right.

                              <span>Nier: Automata is coming to the small screen. Beginning next month, NieR:Automata Ver1.1a will begin airing in the United States on Crunchyroll.
You can check out a brand-new trailer for the show below: 


From the looks of it, Ver1.1a will stick close to the storyline from the video game, released in 2017 as a partnership between publisher Square Enix and developer Platinum Games. Series creator Yoko Taro is also involved with the project. 
The series is in production at A-1 Pictures, a subsidiary of Aniplex. In the past, the production house has worked on series such as Black Butler, Your Lie in April, Fate, and Sword Art Online. Ver1.1a is being directed by Ryoji Masuyama, who&#x27;s previously worked on KILL la KILL, Evangelion: 2.0 You Can (Not) Advance and Evangelion: 3.0+1.01 Thrice Upon a Time, as well as Gurren Lagann.
NieR:Automata Ver1.1a will begin airing in Japan on January 7, 2023. As of right now, it&#x27;s not entirely clear what day it will hit Crunchyroll. However, the streaming service does often have the right to begin showing anime in the west within 24 hours of their original airtimes, so time will tell if Nier gets the same treatment.</span>

Some game names are good only in that they use cool words, but the vibe screams, “I was created in a vat overseen by a focus group.” And…

While there are often discussions around the merits of gaming as an artform, we perhaps talk less about examples of games helping to inspire other contemporary art. Yet as years pass it&#x27;s an inevitability, as the role of games in the lives of millions has transformed since the mid- to late-&#x27;80s. We&#x27;re gradually seeing more creative work and art outside of gaming with those tell-tale signs, those nods and echoes that gamers of all ages and types can instinctively understand and appreciate.

Another year has gone by and we&#x27;ve seen a positive smorgasbord of new Switch eShop releases, with handfuls of games launching each and every week.
Naturally, we&#x27;ve been unable to cover everything that&#x27;s graced the Nintendo Switch in 2022; we are human after all (or are we..?), but we&#x27;ve done our level best to dig deep and surface games that might have gotten lost in the flood.

I reviewed a lot of games this year. More than 50. Then in between those games, I managed to cram in a bunch more extra-curricular titles and maybe something that qualifies as a life for a maladjusted introvert like myself. That’s probably why this year feels like it lasted forever and was a ceaseless cavalcade of failures. My brain is full.
So, allow me to spill my brain all over the page here, as I recount the games that left the most lasting scars in 2022. Fortunately, this also doubles as a list of developers who should be paying for the therapy that keeps me going as a borderline functional member of society.

                              <span>A scarce commodity
Do you own a jar of my toenail clippings? Not many people do. They’re a scarce commodity, but scarcity is a daft reason to own anything. It’s hardwired into our brain that if there are few of something, we want it more. We know it as the “fear of missing out,” and it’s one of the most annoying subsets of greed.
Video game collecting is a pretty innocuous embodiment of this. To my knowledge, no wars have been fought over a copy of Snatcher on the Sega CD. However, it’s still rather annoying. I collect games because they are a tangible representation of the game. I like to play them. Don’t give me a factory-sealed game, because I will open it. I don’t want to look down on anyone else’s reasoning for why they collect games, but I can’t help but find it ridiculous that some …</span>

                              <span>Guides work is a very strange beast, and one that we don&#x27;t talk about as often as we maybe should. By its nature, we here in guidestown can feel a bit isolated from the rest of RPS. Our guides aren&#x27;t very visible to our regular readers. No one hops onto a website like this and says to themselves, &quot;Well now! I wonder what guides have been written today that I can spend my time reading through!&quot;. The vast majority of people who read our guides come straight from a Google search into something specific like &quot;Can I romance Yennefer and Triss at the same time?&quot; (spoiler alert: you can, but it may not end well for you).
Because we operate so much behind the scenes, it&#x27;s easy to miss some of the amazing stuff that the team did in guidestown this year. It ain&#x27;t easy, writing a walkthrough or how-to that&#x27;s useful for the reader while simultaneously appeasing those nebulous and mercurial SEO gods. But 2022 has been a stonkingly good year for guides, and I&#x27;d love to take a little bit of time to shine a light on some of the things we&#x27;re most proud of having achieved this year - and to toast what will hopefully be another smashing year for guides in 2023!

All of my top picks made it into the Advent Calendar, so that&#x27;s good! But otherwise, I didn&#x27;t have to think too hard as to what I&#x27;d shout out here.

                              <span>A little known fact is that all of the RPS staff are complex clockwork automata, designed and built by a little gnome with the kind of inch-thick glasses that make your eyes look comically large. We&#x27;re each powered by a spell that lasts but 12 months, so every Christmas we fall over like sad marionettes. The gnome has to spend a couple of weeks trekking up a mountain to see the fairy who can recast the spells on us. You can help fund his sled dogs and provisions by becoming a member of the RPS supporter program. While he&#x27;s away, we&#x27;ve prepared some Christmas Crackers for you.
Time to enjoy your lovely joke!

                              <span>The Radeon RX 6700 XT is an excellent 1440p graphics card, offering strong rasterised performance, a good image upscaler in FSR 2 and relatively cool and quiet operation. The card is much stronger pound for pound than its closest Nvidia competition, the RTX 3060 Ti and RTX 3070, with the latter remaining at surprisingly high prices due to the ultrapremium RTX 4080 and 4090 Team Green has launched so far. 
Today, the best price we&#x27;ve spotted for the RX 6700 XT is for a Gigabyte Eagle model, selling on Amazon UK for £389.99. That&#x27;s nearly 40% below its RRP and an overall great value for this level of performance.

                              <span>A little known fact is that all of the RPS staff are complex clockwork automata, designed and built by a little gnome with the kind of inch-thick glasses that make your eyes look comically large. We&#x27;re each powered by a spell that lasts but 12 months, so every Christmas we fall over like sad marionettes. The gnome has to spend a couple of weeks trekking up a mountain to see the fairy who can recast the spells on us. You can help fund his sled dogs and provisions by becoming a member of the RPS supporter program. While he&#x27;s away, we&#x27;ve prepared some Christmas Crackers for you.
Time to enjoy your lovely joke!

                              <span>We hope it was a good one!
2022 was an exhausting year, and we could use a bit of respite before we head into the great unknown of 2023. As is our yearly tradition, we figured we&#x27;d check in with the community and see how everyone&#x27;s Christmas is going.
As for me, friends of the family picked us up the Super Nintendo Entertainment System ornament from Hallmark, which is going next to our Minecraft one. My wife grabbed me an accompanying Raccoon Mario ornament, as well as a few goodies for my ever-growing tabletop collection. The little bands on the bottom of the header image are for keeping open board game boxes shut, and the case at the top is a Quiver: for holding game cards. I gifted myself a red DualSense PS5 controller earlier this week on sale, since we could use a third one for our kid.
I&#x27;ve been playing a lot of Marvel Champions, Arkham Horror: The Card Game, and Lord of the Rings: The Card game this year, so both of those accessories will come in handy. Video game-wise we&#x27;ve been playing a lot of couples games lately, including the recently-released Escape Academy DLC, as well as Operation Tango.
There&#x27;s a lot of opportunities to clean up on some video game-related gifts this year, but the tabletop industry is adjacent enough to share if you want! Merry Christmas Destructoid!

It may be the holidays, but that isn&#x27;t going to stop the retro purveyors over at Hamster from keeping the ball rolling on its Arcade Archives ranger — Joining the huge range of shumps rereleased by the publisher on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, it&#x27;s Namco&#x27;s unique chopper blaster, Metal Hawk.
Hitting the arcade market in 1988, Metal Hawk initially looks like standard, vertically-scrolling blaster, which were a dime a dozen in the genre&#x27;s late-&#x27;80s boom period. However, Metal Hawk has a few cool features that helped it stand out from its contemporaries. Showcasing the power of Namco&#x27;s new R&amp;D division, (as well as its new Namco System 2 hardware), Metal Hawk features fast-paced, action-packed gameplay, multi-directional gameplay, and even altitude control, making the shmup a g…</span>

Good morning, good weekend, happy holidays, and welcome to Whatcha Been Playing? I hope that you&#x27;re all feeling suitably festive this Saturday morning, regardless of your disposition to The Most Wonderful Time of the Year. I must admit to not feeling particularly &quot;Christmassy&quot; in 2022, and I haven&#x27;t in some years. But, importantly, I never lose the love for life slowing down just a little, and delivering us all a little bit of holiday cheer, with the emphasis on &quot;Holiday&quot;.
So, I hope that this week has been kind to you and yours, and that this weekend will allow you to take your foot off the accelerator a little — regardless of whether you&#x27;re celebrating Santa Day or otherwise. I&#x27;m really grateful that you took a little time out to join us this morn…</span>

                              <span>A little known fact is that all of the RPS staff are complex clockwork automata, designed and built by a little gnome with the kind of inch-thick glasses that make your eyes look comically large. We&#x27;re each powered by a spell that lasts but 12 months, so every Christmas we fall over like sad marionettes. The gnome has to spend a couple of weeks trekking up a mountain to see the fairy who can recast the spells on us. You can help fund his sled dogs and provisions by becoming a member of the RPS supporter program. While he&#x27;s away, we&#x27;ve prepared some Christmas Crackers for you.
Time to enjoy your lovely joke!

Oh, and we&#x27;re all off work until the new year, bye. RPS won&#x27;t be barren, mind. We have quite a few bonus festive treats lined up between now and our official return on Tuesday the 3rd of January, 2023, so enjoy those (or enjoy the ones you can; the cracker jokes are... painful). Thanks for reading RPS for another year. Before we go, please do tell us what you&#x27;re playing this holiday. Here&#x27;s what we&#x27;re clicking on!

He&#x27;s one of several Christmas treats now stocked on the streets of Los Santos, which also pack snowmen to destroy, rooftop shootouts and, for some reason, superpowered beasts getting chased by serial killers.

                              <span>Merrrrry holidays, folks! The RPS Treehouse is now officially shutting up shop for the year as the team enters its annual hiberation phase. While we settle down into our mountain of games, sweet wrappers and warm blankets for a couple of weeks, we wish you a merry Christmas, a happy holiday and a general Festivus to all who celebrate. The site won&#x27;t be completely silent during the break - we&#x27;ve got a couple of fun things planned for you over the next week and a bit - but we&#x27;ll be back in full bright and early on Tuesday, January 3rd 2023.

His will be different, he says, because he&#x27;s &quot;taking the approach of changing and evolving the world of Death Stranding in a way that suits film well&quot;.
He also says there&#x27;s &quot;no real need&quot; to turn games into films, which is a true and enjoyable acknowledgement from someone who is doing that.

                              <span>The Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit is a playable teaser released to promote Life Is Strange 2, the first episode of which followed on three months after this surprise p.t. dropped during E3 2018. Not to be confused with Silent Hills P.T. (it&#x27;s like… the exact opposite of that), Captain Spirit is free to play, takes two to three hours to complete, and manages to perfectly encapsulate the Life Is Strange experience without giving anything away about the main (read: paid-for) games in the series. It also features possibly my favourite LIS protagonist in adorable wannabe superhero Chris, which is quite a high bar to clear, considering how much time I spend banging on about what great characters Chloe and Sean are.

                              <span>Legendarily complicated (and just generally legendary) colony sim Dwarf Fortress launched on Steam a few weeks ago, bringing sprite graphics, more players and millions of dollars for developers Bay 12 games. Brothers Tarn and Zach Adams have spent the past 16 years relying on donations, so actually selling their game has now allowed to expand their team and hire someone from their community to help with the programming. They say &quot;Putnam&quot; will be the first non-Adam to ever see the code behind the curtain. Cue the Indiana Jones face-melting gif.
An update yesterday also added Steam trading cards, as well as giving you the option to flick between classic and premium graphics.

                              <span>I find myself alone. I am the only person left in the treehouse right now. I think it&#x27;s the first time this has happened. It is interesting to consider that I could try to wipe the website, delete loads of articles, do something to burn down my job. I don&#x27;t particularly want to, but the coiled potential to do it exists, because I am unsupervised. There is no other member of staff between me and all of you. The great filter is removed. Any typos are on purpose. How you doin&#x27;?
This gives me a great opportunity, because I get to have, in a sense, the final word on RPS this year. There are a lot of posts coming up (if we include the Advent Calendar posts that have already gone, we have 50-ish bits of hashtag seasonal hashtag content this year, which I think is the most I&#x27;ve had to schedule for a Christmas break yet), but almost everything after this point is a scheduled post, made of time travel words written days or weeks ago. I&#x27;m live and uncensored, baby. I&#x27;m going to fire up Among Trees. Let&#x27;s go and be alone together. But don&#x27;t worry, I take my responisbility seriously, so I&#x27;ll make sure the final word is a joke.

                              <span>It&#x27;s a well known fact that there are &quot;Too Many Games&quot;(TM) these days. I have not done the maths, but I&#x27;ve seen enough graphs, tweets and analysis from people who have crunched the numbers to know there are more games coming out on Steam every day than a site like RPS could ever possibly hope to cover a single month, let alone every week. But gosh darn it if we don&#x27;t try our hardest all the same. 
Inevitably, though, time does get the better of us sometimes (or, in my case at least, maybe my eyes are just too big for my gaming stomach), and certain games end up slipping further and further down our to-do lists until they eventually fall away entirely. Not through any fault of their own, mind. Just... time. But as a final parting shoutout for 2022, I wanted to memorialise all the games that fell of my personal to-do list this year and say, &quot;I&#x27;M SORRY, I DIDN&#x27;T MEAN IT, I PROMISE!&quot; (For real, though, I still want to talk about all of these at some point. Maybe January...? Please don&#x27;t hate me)

                              <span>Serious racing games are not, as a rule, my thing. If the goal is to repeat a course 20 times to trim 0.2 seconds off a number, and not to cackle like a petty chaos gremlin as you slam someone off the track at a tight corner, I am probably not going to enjoy myself much.
Rush Rally 3 isn&#x27;t all that serious, but it&#x27;s still on the wrong side of the tracks for me, I thought, before accidentally playing it for 3 hours. This is an excellent bundle of rally trials, challenges, and simple circuit racing with a cheerfully mid-2000s feel. I might prefer the messy nonsense of Trail Out, but if you value actual driving skill more highly, this is well worth your time.

                              <span>Last week I spoke to Larian&#x27;s founder and director Swen Vincke about the latest big update to Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3, and the road to 1.0 release. But also it was December the 16th, so I saw fit to waste his time asking a bunch of fun seasonal questions that blended the love and goodwill of Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3, with the companion-wrangling and clutch strategy of Christmas. D&#x27;you see what I did there?
My questions are in bold, and Vincke&#x27;s answers are undeneath - and they are both amusing and instructive. I for one hope that Wyll&#x27;s romcom visit home becomes a future winter DLC.

                              <span>December always feels like a good month for VR gaming. Perhaps it&#x27;s because Christmas and VR headsets go together like mangers and Messiahs, or perhaps its because virtual reality is the only place I&#x27;m likely to see sunlight before March. In any case, if you&#x27;re giving or receiving a pair of magic goggles this festive season, I&#x27;ll be recommending a couple of stocking fillers to go with it at the end of this article.


First though, it&#x27;s time for a more general bit of stocktaking. 2022 was a big ol&#x27; shrug of a year for VR gaming. Which is not to say it was bad, plenty of fun and interesting games launched in the last twelve months, one of which I&#x27;d probably put in my personal top ten. But from both a hardware and software perspective, nothing released this year is likely to shift the needle.

Fans were excited about the sequel for several reasons – that original reveal trailer was great – but the question on many minds was this: Why is Dead Island 2 set somewhere that’s not an island? 
I traveled to Nottingham, England to visit Dambuster Studios, and this was one of the first questions I asked. Unsurprisingly, considering this is the team that&#x27;s been developing this game since 2018, lead narrative designer Khan had an in-depth answer. 
Simply put, Los Angeles has become an island, metaphorically speaking. 
Dead Island 2 begins in the final days of the evacuation of LA after the zombie outbreak has swept through…</span>

                              <span>Sports Story is available now, Nintendo and developer SideBar Games announced during a special Inside the House of Indies holiday video. The surprise launch comes a month and a half after the developer gave us a December 2022 release window for the long-awaited follow up to its 2017 smash hit, Golf Story.
Golf Story provided players a retro-styled RPG with a zany story centered around golf of all kinds: regular, disc, and more. Sports Story sees SideBar Games expand the formula to include various other athletic events, including BMX, tennis, cricket, soccer, volleyball, fishing, and more. If you loved the golf of Golf Story, don&#x27;t worry: That sport carries over to Sports Story, bringing with it eight unique golf courses. 
You can see the full video, which also provides updates for Sea of Stars, Undying, and Dust &amp; Neon, below.


Golf Story, SideBar Games&#x27; predecessor to Sports Story, arrived on Switch on September 28, 2017. In our review, we called it &quot;a breath of fresh air for sports, and another fun story to follow for role-playing fanatics,&quot; awarding it a 9 out of 10. Sports Story was initially announced by SideBar Games in December 2019, with long stretches of silence from the development team. Then, during last month&#x27;s Indie World Showcase from Nintendo, the developers finally announced that the game would arrive at some point in December 2022.
Sports Story is available now for Switch.</span>

                              <span>The Gran Turismo series has long been a favorite of sim-racing enthusiasts, and today marks a special milestone for the franchise. Gran Turismo: The Real Driving Simulator was released on PlayStation in Japan on December 23, 1997, meaning that the series has officially crossed the quarter-century mark. To celebrate 25 years of Gran Turismo, PlayStation released a special blog post and a retrospective video.
The blog post comes by way of Kazunori Yamauchi, creator and producer of the franchise and CEO of Polyphony Digital. In the post, Yamauchi recounts how the series came to be, with his original plans for the series stretching as far back as 1992.

                              <span>It&#x27;s a fun word to say
I don’t know how Steel Empire snuck up on me, but I had never heard tell of it until I held the Genesis clamshell case in my hands. A horizontal shoot-’em-up where you can pilot a blimp? Get out of my dreams and into my Genesis. However, I later learned that Steel Empire had been ported to 3DS and then to PC. Our boy, Chris Carter, even reviewed it back in the day. Since I was an avid reader of Destructoid at the time, I probably saw it, but it didn’t connect.
So, here I thought I discovered some lost gem of the Genesis library, and really it’s been in circulation this whole time. Ah well, it’s not some sort of competition. If it was, I would have so many participation trophies.

The wallet-troubling merchandisers over at Good Smile Co. have opened pre-orders on the next gaming superstar joining its enormous range of ridiculously adorable Nendoroid figurines — And this time around, it&#x27;s a true icon of the medium, with the coming of Street Fighter legend Chun-Li!

As with all Nendoroid releases, Chun-Li stands a dinky 100mm in height, (that&#x27;s just under four inches), and comes complete with a stand and several faceplates and accessories — allowing fans to stage The Strongest Woman in The World in all manner of dynamic poses. The additional Faceplates include a business face, a cute smile, and even a tearful expression, though why you&#x27;d use that is beyond me. Accessories include alternate hands, a Kikoken fireball, and Chunner&#x27;s famous Lightning Legs kick!

If you&#x27;d like your own pocket-sized Chun-Li to stand guard over your desk, then you can pre-order her right now over at the official Good Smile Co. store and other toy retailers. Nendoroid Chun-Li retails for ¥8,400, (or roughly $58 USD), not including shipping, handling, or any potential customs charges. Chun-Li is expected to ship in the summer of 2023. Surprisingly, this is only the first of the Street Fighter Nendoroids. Given the huge roster of characters on offer, one would think Good Smile would have tapped this market long before now.
YA-TA!

                              <span>Gods revel, lands tremble
Final Fantasy XIV isn&#x27;t waiting too long in the new year for its next update. Patch 6.3 for Final Fantasy XIV is due to arrive on January 10, 2023, bringing new story and raid content, as well as many other changes and additions.
The trailer shown off today during the Live Letter spotlights what the protagonist, or Warrior of Light, will be getting up to as the main story content continues. We see newer addition to the cast Zero a fair bit, but it also looks like Alisae and Alphinaud will be involved too.

We also see some of the new raid content coming to Final Fantasy XIV&#x27;s current 24-player raid series, Myths of the Realm. Seems the gods will continue to test players, and I&#x27;m really digging the bits we saw of their arenas.
Home sweet Island Sanctuary
Of course, a Final Fantasy XIV patch is a grand affair, and there&#x27;s much more on the way too. As outlined on the Patch 6.3 site, there are updates to Tataru&#x27;s Grand Endeavor, additional Duty support, and both a new Unreal Trial and Ultimate Raid. It seems like XIV players who like the high-end content will have their hands full with the new update.
But if you prefer a quiet life, in the sanctity of a peaceful island, there&#x27;s something for you too. The Island Sanctuary is getting an update, which will include a new landmark, and some big quality-of-life changes that Square Enix&#x27;s Naoki Yoshida outlines during the Live Letter. Picking up all leavings and yields in one fell swoop is going to be a game-changer.
While the holidays may just be getting started, Final Fantasy XIV looks poised to ring in the new year with a big patch. We&#x27;ll see where the MSQ goes, and maybe head back to our islands for a little maintenance, on January 10, 2023.

                              <span>What could I do (a thousand nights without you)
Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII has had a somewhat mythical status for me over the past half-decade or so. I didn’t get into the Final Fantasy VII compilation until just a few years ago when I finally played through the PlayStation original for a short-lived feature series here at Destructoid. I absolutely fell for the game and its world before I watched the credits roll on it. I wanted more, but by then, the PSP was already a dinosaur, and for whatever reason, Crisis Core never found its way onto PSN. Not wanting to drop the money on a handheld for just one game, I was left to admire what I perceived it to be from afar.
Last year, when Square Enix announced Final Fantasy VII: Ever Crisis, my first thought was how I’d finally be able to see Za…</span>

This news comes by way of a Steam blog post for the game that reveals this new update is available to download right now. It includes a new custom arcade mode, CRT and VCR filters, and additional fixes and changes to the game. 


&quot;The update implements Custom Game options, granting ninjas greater control over their tubular battle against the Foot Clan through 11 mix-and-match modifiers reminiscent of the dip switches found on old school arcade machines,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;Retro-themed filters and an extra large serving of refinements round out the surprise update, which reaches PC, PlayStation, Switch, and Xbox players today.&quot; 
Here is a look at the Custom Game options dip switch board: 
As you can see, it looks like there&#x27;s plenty to mix and match to make each custom arcade session feel unique. If you&#x27;re interested, be sure to boot the game up today and get the update downloading.

                              <span>Santa Monica Studio has announced that God of War Ragnarök, which hit PlayStation consoles last month, is getting a New Game Plus mode in spring. 
This news comes by way of a short and sweet tweet posted today by the studio that says Spring 2023 is when fans can expect the feature to hit Ragnarök. As for what to expect, though, that remains unknown – Santa Monica Studio says it&#x27;ll &quot;share more details once we get closer to the release.&quot; 


While many had hoped Ragnarök would launch with a New Game Plus mode built-in, its arrival after the game&#x27;s release isn&#x27;t surprising. God of War (2018) received its New Game Plus mode after launch as well. For now, we wait until next spring. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer&#x27;s God of War Ragnarök review and then read about how the game&#x27;s director fought to keep its most unexpected and cartoonish character in the game. Check out this story about how Kratos voice actor Christopher Judge originally quit when he learned someone else was directing Ragnarök after that and then read about how Amazon Prime Video has ordered a God of War TV series set during the Norse era.

                              <span>We’re approaching the end of 2022, and we’re concluding the year by going back to our Super Replay roots by tackling an old-school survival horror game. In this case, we’re replaying one of the greatest games of the PS1 era, Silent Hill! Join us live on Twitch today at 3 p.m. Central as we endure two hours of nostalgic, hair-raising scares. If you can’t catch us live, each episode will be available to watch on Saturdays on the Game Informer Shows YouTube channel. 
Episode 1 - The Harry Mason Shuffle
Episode 2- When Doves Cry
Episode 3 - Bible.
Episode 4 - Age Seven, Short, Black Hair


In 1999, Konami put the fear of fog in a generation of players with the release of Silent Hill. The eerie title eschewed the more bombastic horror of its main rival at the time, Resident Evil, in favor of more psychological frights. Protagonist Harry Mason must embark on a terrifying search for his missing daughter, Cheryl, within the eerie town of Silent Hill. What unfolds is a descent into madness that kickstarted a franchise that&#x27;s (finally) returning to the limelight after years of dormancy. Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Kyle Hilliard, as we survive Silent Hill’s debut adventure and see how its scares stack up 23 years later.

                              <span>Ubisoft stopped releasing their games via Steam back in 2019, starting with The Division 2. The Tom Clancy shoot-to-looter was instead released via Ubisoft&#x27;s own digital storefront and via the Epic Games Store. It&#x27;ll finally arrive on Steam next month on January 12th, as part of Ubisoft&#x27;s broader shift back to Valve&#x27;s storefront.

                              <span>Chained Echoes is a retro Japanese-inspired RPG set in a world of dragons and mech suits. It seemingly already has the scope of the 16-bit games that inspired it, but that doesn&#x27;t mean there aren&#x27;t post-release updates to come. Its developer is now working on a New Game Plus mode.

                              <span>A lot of games about ships seem dour to me, because the wind is a fickle method of propulsion and because slowly revolving around enemies during slow cannon-fire combat is dull. By contrast, Sail Forth looks more my speed, with its enormous sea creatures, secretive faction of frogs in submarines, and a wind system itd developers claim is &quot;deeply accessible&quot;. It&#x27;s out now and there&#x27;s a launch trailer below.

                              <span>Nope, you don&#x27;t need to get your eyes tested. Alt254 is a minimalist action adventure game that plays out on a small (albeit greatly enlarged) map that measures just 21x26 pixels. In this tiny space, you, a black dot, must venture forth, solving puzzles, deciphering the strange, colourful world around you and piecing together your broken memory along the way. It&#x27;s a very enigmatic little game, but one that&#x27;s instantly charming in its old-school vibes and artfully constructed world. Its soundtrack is a bit of a corker, too.

                              <span>Yesterday, I used my amazing arithmetical reasoning abilities to surmise that there were only eight free games left to come from the Epic Games Store’s Winter Sale giveaway. I was wrong. Don’t look shocked, it happens. Today sees three of the earliest Fallout games being offered up for nothing. They’re Fallout: A Post-Nuclear Role-Playing Game, Fallout 2, and Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood Of Steel. I already own all three elsewhere, as you might well too, but if you don’t then it’s a good way of picking up three classics of 90s PC gaming.

                              <span>I expect the life of the average person in ninth-century England was a lot tougher than the fantastical future full of video games we inhabit more than a millennium later. Well, Ubisoft and Capcom have teamed up to make the lives of digital peasants even harder, by shoving some Monster Hunter World themed gubbins into Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla. Have a watch of the trailer below to see just how bizarre this crossover is.

                              <span>Tradition is a transformative power. Often unintentionally, something happens during an event and, if people want, it becomes more than an occurrence, it becomes part of the event. They repeat it, and they share it with other people in their lives and hearts, and the tradition grows. Often the original food/game/gesture/saying/joke/whatever had nothing to do with the event&#x27;s core, and that doesn&#x27;t matter. Sometimes it simply brings joy and feels right. For example, the use of 1956 pop song Green Door in free festive indie game Dracula Cha Cha feels so right that to me, it is a Christmas song. Green Door has run through my head for weeks, and it is once again time for the annual go on Dracula Cha Cha.

                              <span>CD Projekt RED have pushed out another hotfix for The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt’s ever-so-slightly borked next-gen update that was released last week. You can expect some extra stability compared to the previous version of the update, something that’ll always be welcome on my PC. Along with Roach’s early Christmas present of some stabilisers, the hotfix also tackles the annoying bug that caused toxicity to be stuck at max level, along with some minor tweaks to photo mode, and unexplained improvements for The Witcher 3’s performance on Steam Deck.

As far as I can tell, their Sphynx Ampere toiletries do not smell like new graphics cards, so who cares? However! This does make me wonder: which PC gaming smells would you like as a shower gel, perfume, deodorant, aftershave, air freshener, or such? What are the good smells of PC gaming? Which would you eagerly accept as a boxed toiletry set from your aunt this Christmas? I&#x27;ll go first.

Blizzard have released a roadmap for the next year’s worth of shenanigans for the expansion, with new zones, raids, a megadungeon, and profession changes planned. Two major updates, one each scheduled for the first and second halves of the year, will kick off new seasons for Dragonflight.

But given the game&#x27;s subject centres on the depiction of women on film, and their exploitation in the film industry by male creators, it felt appropriate to examine it from the extremely talented femme members of the team. That means not just the star Marissa Marcel herself, played by the award-winning Manon Gage, but other women and non-binary creatives who played different roles in bringing this game to life.

With Gloomwood’s final update for this year, though, you can at least nip in the local tavern now. Only, it seems there’s something pretty nasty dwelling inside its presumably one-star walls. Have a watch of the trailer below, and get us a Guinness and a packet of Golden Wonder from the bar. Ready salted, please.

Maybe that’s why I’m not one – Portal with RTX is a gorgeous return to Aperture Science, a borderline must-play for anyone with a premium GeForce RTX GPU, and a mightily impressive demonstration of the Nvidia RTX Remix tools that built it.

                              <span>Sometimes, I like to daydream about what games could have been like if they’d taken another direction during development. Raising The Bar: Redux is exactly that, a reimagining of Half-Life 2 as though Valve never dropped their original concepts for the sci-fi shooter sequel. The next instalment in the modding project to bring that abandoned game to life, Division 2, is releasing soon. You can watch the fairly hefty trailer for Raising The Bar: Redux: Division 2 below.

                              <span>Super quick, very good card battler Marvel Snap rolls out a new location every week, then boosts it with a 40% likelihood to appear for 48 hours. New, temporarily common locations are a clever way of mixing things up, imposing restraints or possibilities depending on how much you tinker with your decks. 
The latest location, Vormir, is a bit borked. I just spent a minute or so swapping emotes with someone while the game tried to load our (unrelated) animations, which might not sound like much but constitutes a good third of a match&#x27;s normal running time.

That means the skies can be yours for just £10/$15, if you pay for a month. The trial&#x27;s only available until Jan 2nd, though, so best hop on it quick.

Reader, I am telling you this so that you don&#x27;t waste all of them pointlessly knocking on the door like I did, as you are in fact supposed to use them to knock out guards. 
It&#x27;s a procedurally generated game made for 7dfps 2022, a game jam that challenges folks to make an fps game in seven days. Your manor will be different to mine, but the toilets will probably still be silly.

Goat Sim developers Coffee Stain Studios knew this would happen, and they knew people would report on it when it did. I am facilitating shenanigans, and I can hear that damn goat laughing at me from within the black void of its copyright takedown notice.

                              <span>I’m a big fan of life-sim mini-games. Cooking, crafting, mining, gardening, and all those other videogame-y tasks make something that&#x27;s a bit mundane into a fun little treat. It looks like developers Niceplay Games agree, as they’ve taken the joy of tactile crafting and created an entire potion-brewing sim around it - and not only is their crafting system both creative and clever, it&#x27;s oh so satisfying.
We&#x27;ve written about it before, but Potion Craft is out now. You play as an alchemist who has set up shop in an old wizard’s hut, ready to sell your many bubbling brews and concoctions to the locals. People will come by the shop during the day banging on about their problems, so you need to listen to each customer&#x27;s issue, create an appropriate potion to help, and receive a lovely handful of gold in return. It’s essentially a shop management sim, since you make money, buy ingredients, and haggle to get a good deal. But the best part of Potion Craft is all in the title; it&#x27;s getting to grips with the art of potion brewing.

                              <span>Some point-and-click adventures prefer their heroes all comedic and wacky, your Guybrush types. Others are more stoic and action-orientated, such as Indy Jones or Graham of Daventry. Who fits better as an adventure game protagonist than Sherlock Holmes, consulting detective, though? The Lost Files Of Sherlock Holmes: The Case Of The Serrated Scalpel taught me that when I was about eight years old, trying to figure out its mysteries while sitting at my dad’s Amstrad 286 accompanied by my sister Gem. Okay, I was definitely the Watson of that duo.

Honestly, I did not immediately mistake this for Lego Bricktales, which I’m sure you didn’t either. Builder’s Journey tasks you with solving puzzles by, well, building with Lego. It’s also a bit of a looker, with some snazzy visual accoutrements such as ray tracing and global illumination. You can have a watch of the very pretty Builder’s Journey trailer below.

                              <span>Last time, you decided by a narrow margin that becoming overpowered is better than a chunky manual. With no chunky manual to teach you a game&#x27;s systems, I guess you&#x27;ll be busy experimenting with that for a while. This week, I&#x27;ve had a queer fancy to (for once) make you pick between things which have absolutely no connection. What&#x27;s better: seasonal events, or dynamic snow? I know, it&#x27;s a bit of a silly choice, but hey, it&#x27;s the last week of work before Christmas, let&#x27;s goof off.

The private consumer complaint from the 10 #gamers claims the deal would give Microsoft &quot;far-outsized market power in the video game industry&quot;. Power to &#x27;em. Power to the gamers.

                              <span>As you might have noticed, there’s just a few days until Christmas lands on us all like an overladen sleigh pulled by some very exhausted and confused reindeers. Overwatch 2’s marking the occasion by turning robotic damage hero Bastion into a gingerbread automaton with a new legendary skin. Seeing as it’s the holidays, Blizzard are charging just a single Overwatch Coin for the skin, which is way, way less than the thousands that legendaries usually cost. Bastion’s fresh look is also quite a bit more involved than some of the other legendary efforts Blizzard’s dreamt up for Overwatch 2 so far.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been playing Blacktail, ostensibly for review, but with all the seasonal nonsense going on I haven&#x27;t played enough to give you a big wot I think. It&#x27;s worth writing about though, so here I am, doing that. It&#x27;s a weirdo little first-person action-adventure game where you play as the 16-year-old Yaga, who has been run into the forest because the local villagers think she&#x27;s in league with the witch Baba. If you know any European folklore you may have reason to suspect they&#x27;re right.
Yaga&#x27;s childhood friends have all vanished, along with her sister, and the game sends you off to breadcrumb trails around a bright, unreal forest, to find the memories of what happened to the unfortunate kiddies. Along the way you grow in power and skill, using different types of arrows with your bow, as well as lures and spells. I like Blacktail because it&#x27;s a little bit janky in ways that don&#x27;t break the game, and is absolutely committed to its own particular flavour of odd. It&#x27;s the kind of game you used to see a lot in the early-mid 00s, and just don&#x27;t get much anymore.

The low-fi indie developers of the Haunted PS1 community have another Madvent Calendar this year, offering another 24 small horror games and oddities released daily. So far, these have ranged from an extreme snowboarding murder game to a pleasant little online social network where you leave messages for other people by decorating plants and plaques in a sunny courtyard. A lovely thing, and free!

It was surprisingly great. It&#x27;s also free to keep if you grab it from the Epic Games Store right now.

                              <span>Last month it was announced that the Risk Of Rain IP was now fully owned by Gearbox Publishing and that original developers Hopoo Games would not be working on future updates for Risk Of Rain 2. There was also the promise that Hopoo and Gearbox were working on one remaining Risk Of Rain project together, however.

It was announced today: Risk Of Rain Returns, a remaster of the 2013 2D roguelike with all new pixel art, new survivors and new everything else.

                              <span>Larian&#x27;s now-traditional Panel From Hell method of update delivery dumped some important Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 news last week. The weighty Dungeons &amp; Dragons fantasy RPG has been in early access for a couple of years, but it&#x27;s now scheduled for a 1.0 release in August next year. As well as that, BG3 got its ninth update, the last significant one before release, which raises the level cap to 5 and adds Paladin as a playable class. I caught up with Larian&#x27;s founder and director Swen Vincke (this time sans full suit of armour) and he told me that, despite Update 9 being a big one, there&#x27;s still a lot to come.

                              <span>If I were only allowed to give a single, solitary reason for trying Control, I’d probably settle on this: it has the most satisfying “throw desk at face” interaction I’ve experienced in a game. Yes, even more so than Half-Life 2. Maybe it’s the slower flying speed of the desk, giving you more time to anticipate the blow. Maybe it’s the recoil of the face. Or maybe it’s just how the desk, or whichever piece of office fixture you’re telekinetically hurling, impacts in a hilarious explosion of shards and scraps.

From the snippets Sloclap have shown, the update will have a new arenas mode that seems to be similar to combat challenge maps from the Arkham series. A new patch, 1.16, has also gone live for Sifu today to duff up some pesky crashes and bugs, although patch notes haven’t been released yet. You can watch the teaser for the arenas mode update below.

It’s the Director’s Cut too, which adds some more stuff for nosey American tourist George ‘Goat-wrangler’ Stobbart and French journalist Nico ‘Curtains’ Collard to investigate. Good grief, I can’t even remember the last time I played a Broken Sword. The first one is a classic adventure game from a time when they were beginning to fade from PC, goat puzzle notwithstanding.

COD now has its own Santa, too, and I wouldn’t want to tangle with him. You can see what I mean, and catch a glimpse of the holiday version of Shipment, by watching the trailer below.

Alone or with a party of pals, you head into dungeons to mash AI-controlled monsters and fill your pockets with loot. Other players are out there doing the same, and might come to claim your goodies, especially as you&#x27;re all competing for the limited escape portals that let you keep your shinies. It&#x27;s an interesting one, and doing well on both Steam and Twitch.

Don&#x27;t worry, you can just work more to pay it off.

                              <span>It’s okay everyone, call off the search. I’ve found my Christmas game. LucasArts shooter Star Wars: Dark Forces has been given a modern makeover by The Force Engine project, and they’ve just released version 1.0 to the public after three years&#x27; work. During that time, the team’s reverse engineered Dark Forces and added a whole bunch of mod-cons, such as support for modern high resolutions and mouse-look. The project even has a trailer, which you can watch below.

                              <span>Hello, yes, I know this is our fourth post on the subject but it’s mostly good news – The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt’s next-gen update is now considerably less of a technical muddle. After applying yesterday’s PC hotfix, performance with the new ray tracing settings is majorly improved, and if you don’t (or can’t) use those, The Witcher 3 no longer runs slower than it did before the next-gen update hobbled it. 


That’s judging by some tests I’ve run using the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070, on which overall stability seems to have improved as well. I’m still having trouble with AMD graphics cards, however, with FSR upscaling being a particularly reliable source of crashes.

                              <span>&quot;Do not be afraid to die.&quot; That&#x27;s the advice of Haemimont Games&#x27; CEO Bisser Dyankov when it comes to playing their new open world survival sim Stranded: Alien Dawn. Having launched into early access in mid-October, the latest game from the Surviving Mars devs has just recently doubled in size to include a brand-new desert biome in its Dunes And Moons update, adding harsh temperature extremes to deal with, new alien lifeforms to observe, and, you know, just the odd Chaos Moon to endure while you&#x27;re at it. 
The world of Desertum is certainly a marked change from Stranded&#x27;s initial mountainous forest planet, Sobrius, but after a few weeks of trying (and inevitably failing) to stay alive in them, I do feel like I&#x27;ve settled on a couple of vital dos and don&#x27;ts now. For example, Do: invest in defences early on. Don&#x27;t: eat that weird alien zebra camel until you know whether it&#x27;s going to give you gut rot. The list goes on, and has only grown larger with the addition of Desertum, which was deliberately designed to &quot;challenge players to plan better and not rely on their previous knowledge,&quot; Dyankov tells me. &quot;Our aim here has been to find a balance between the familiar and unfamiliar within the Desertum Biome, to ensure it&#x27;s a challenging place to build your base, but is also enjoyable.&quot; I&#x27;ll try to remember that the next time horned dinosaurs are gnawing my survivors&#x27; legs off.

Described as an “end of time adventure gacha puzzle apocalypse visual novel simulation horror trip”, Roman Sands RE:Build hails from the devs behind horror game Paratopic. It’s got a vaguely vaporwave sensibility that reminds me a smidge of Paradise Killer. Watch the trailer for Roman Sands RE:Build below, and please explain to me if you understand what’s going on.

                              <span>2013’s Risk of Rain is getting an enhanced remake, and it’s coming next year to celebrate its 10th birthday. Titled Risk of Rain Returns, it spruces up the original with improved art, new survivors, and more.
Announced during Nintendo’s House of Indies: Holiday Event Day 2 today, Risk of Rain Returns expands upon the first game while applying the lessons and improvements of Risk of Rain 2. Although Returns does not adopt the sequel&#x27;s 3D art direction, it features new HD pixel art, balancing tweaks, and new music tracks from composer Chris Christodoulou. It also has improved multiplayer, with other content updates to be shared in the future. Check out the animated announcement trailer below. 


In a press release, Hopoo Games co-founder Duncan Drummond says that, “As we chart our future as developers, it was important to us that we look back on our early work. Risk of Rain Returns is a small token of our appreciation to this incredible community.

                              <span>The tough-as-nails martial arts brawler Sifu is migrating to Xbox platforms and Steam sometime in March. Not only that, but the game is receiving a big content update free to all players.
This update is called Arenas, and as the name suggests, it adds nine new maps that feature combat challenges. Overcoming these missions unlocks new modifiers that introduce alternative combat moves, cheats, and outfits. Arenas also arrives in March and serves as the latest addition in a roadmap of seasonal post-launch updates that have bolstered the title with more cosmetics, cheats, difficulty settings, and even a replay editor. 


Sifu is now available on PlayStation consoles, Switch, and PC via the Epic Game Store. You can read our review of the game here.</span>

                              <span>Dead Island 2 was finally re-revealed earlier this summer, after nearly a decade of development across three different studios. Many have been anticipating this long-awaited sequel since its original reveal back in 2014, just a few years following the franchise&#x27;s start. That&#x27;s why I went to Nottingham, England, to go hands-on with the game for more than seven hours. And soon, you can read everything I learned because Dead Island 2 bloodies up this month&#x27;s cover of Game Informer. 
Game Informer video editor Alex Van Aken and I visited Dambuster Studios in Nottingham to play two extensive portions of Dead Island 2, talk with the game&#x27;s director about its development and why the team started with a blank slate, learn from the narrative lead about why a game with &quot;island&quot; in its name is set in…</span>

The sequel to Star Wars: Fallen Order, Star Wars: Jedi Survivor, was announced some time ago, but developer Respawn Entertainment has remained mostly silent on what to expect. That changed earlier this month when a new gameplay trailer pulled the veil back on several new gameplay features, not to mention an impending March release date. We followed up with game director Stig Asmussen to learn more details about the anticipated title.
One of the most notable additions is the arrival of several new fighting stances for Cal Kestis as he goes into battle. “We have five fully realized stanc…</span>

It&#x27;s a first-person factory-building game set in an alien cavern complex with pretty bioluminescent plants. I am excited to lose dozens or hundreds of hours to it when it launches on early access.

                              <span>Riot Games are attempting to get out of a silly sponsorship deal they made last year with now defunct crypto exchange company FTX. The deal involved FTX paying many millions of dollars to League Of Legends developers Riot, who have only received $6.25 million of the $12.5 million FTX were supposed to cough up in 2022. This is on account of FTX being a) bankrupt and b) formerly lead by Sam Bankman-Fried, who was arrested last week in The Bahamas. It is hard not to LoL.

                              <span>How was your year for PC hardware, reader? Pick up anything nice, or got any old favourite gear still going strong? I’m still very happy with the 4K gaming monitor I got for a pittance, and have spent the past twelve months becoming increasingly convinced that tenkeyless keyboards are, in fact, the best keyboards.


That’s just me, though. On an everyone’s-invited macro level, 2022 ended up being the most transformative year for PC gaming kit in recent memory. We’ve had it all: long overdue launches, bitter disappointments, and genuinely impactful performance innovations. Also, Valve made a handheld PC. That was cool.

Duelyst the first boasted a dead clever combination of card-battling and physical manoeuvring, a bit like Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns but better and multiplayer. I was sad when it died. This is by a different team of developers, and it&#x27;s more of a revival with a few tweaks than a true sequel. Who cares, I can play Duelyst again.

                              <span>I love a courtroom visual novel and after dealing with the wonderful nonsense of the Ace Attorney and Danganronpa series, I barely batted an eyelid at Aviary Attorney’s schtick of playing as a bird-brained lawyer (who is literally a bird). At first glance, it seems kinda gimmicky, but this short visual novel has a special flair for melodrama that can turn a boring, stuffy courtroom into a theatre of drama and spectacle (plus some lavish visuals to boot).
The setting is 1840s France, a time when Paris is on the brink of revolution against the (literal) fat cats. You play as the dapper defence attorney Jayjay Falcon who alongside his witty lackey Sparrowson take on four seemingly unrelated cases. Travelling around Paris, you collect evidence and interview witnesses then present your findings in the courtroom and bring justice to your client.

                              <span>Fortnite developer Epic Games is settling two complaints made to the US Federal Trade Commission by paying out a total of more than half a billion dollars. Wall Street Journal report that the FTC alleged Epic had violated protections intended to secure children’s privacy, and tactically drove players to make unintended purchases that amounted to hundreds of millions of dollars. The company are now settling for $520 million (£427 million).


A federal court case claimed that Epic breached the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) by collecting details about Fortnite players who were younger than 13 years old without getting parental consent or contacting their parents. That’s been settled for $275 million. The complaint also alleged Epic illegally enabled real-time voice and text chat for young players as Fortnite’s default, which the FTC said put them at risk from strangers.

                              <span>After all these years of going fast, it would appear that Sonic (T. Hedgehog) has finally arrived. He’s thrown off the shackles of individuality and joined the open-world herd with Sonic Frontiers, a game that sees the blue blur himself canter and gambol across primarily barren environments that closely resemble the default assets that ship with certain game engines. Do I seem embittered? Perish the thought. I’m happy for Sonic, honestly. He’s made it. He’s on top of the world right now, getting review scores he never could have dreamed of since the salad days of the Mega Drive. A Metacritic in the 70s! He may as well have been kissed on the nips by Jesus Christ himself.

Custom controller maker Super Louis 64’s done just that, crafting a Buster Sword that lets him play through Final Fantasy 7 Remake in true Cloud style. When he shared a clip of his antics on Twitter, Super Louis insisted the whole game is playable using the big knife. The honorary Soldier says he’s hoping to have a full video of his time spent pretending to be Cloud up on his YouTube channel today.

                              <span>Microsoft may be considering a lower-priced tier of their Game Pass service, with a few adjustments from the current standard options. A Spanish-language survey shared on ResetEra has allegedly shown the company asking current subscribers whether they’d be up for cheaper Game Pass for PC and console, if that reduction came with a delay for first-party games or running ads. It’s worth taking this with a heavy pinch of salt though, as there’s no confirmed source to the survey.

                              <span>Sandy hoverbike-riding climb ‘em up Sable’s being given away for free on the Epic Games Store up until 4pm GMT on December 19th. That’s today, if you’ve not checked your advent calendar yet. This one’s got my attention because I’m a sucker for a fishing minigame, something Sable added in a free update just last month. It’s also a relatively peaceful game to add to your pile ahead of the beckoning wintertide break, thanks to the complete lack of combat. John Lennon would be chuffed.

People who share their Netflix, Amazon Prime, or Disney+ passwords are violators of copyright law. And it gets worse. The IPO informs TorrentFreak that password sharing could also mean criminal liability for fraud.

Will it be Elden Ring? Or maybe God of War Ragnarök? What about the impressive indie underdog, Neon White? We also liked Tunic quite a lot. We will be sharing our picks for the game and games of the year in the next issue of Game Informer magazine with [redacted] on the cover, but we also want to hear from our readers and share your favorites of 2022.
To do that, we ask that you fill out the poll below. Send us your personal list of 2022&#x27;s five best games and we will gather everyone&#x27;s information and share the result early. You have until the end of the day on January 19 to submit your list. We can&#x27;t wait to see how your picks compare to ours!</span>

                              <span>Square Enix announced its Final Fantasy pixel remasters of the series&#x27; first six games in June of last year, and over the course of roughly eight months, each of those remasters hit PC platforms. Fans have been waiting since that announcement for the reveal of console versions of these remasters and finally, Square Enix has revealed that all six are coming to PlayStation and Switch next year. 
More specifically, these pixel remasters will hit PlayStation 4 and Switch sometime in the spring of 2023. Each of these games can be purchased individually or together as a bundle, and a limited physical edition will also be available on the same day. Here&#x27;s a look at what to expect in the Final Fantasy I-VI Pixel Remaster: FF 35th Anniversary Edition: 
Final Fantasy I-VI Collection - physical collection of all games for either PS4 or Nintendo Switch
Anniversary Edition goods box
A bonus lenticular sleeve for the game package
2-disc vinyl record set featuring newly arranged game music with exclusive cover artwork by Kazuko Shibuya
A specially compiled artbook showcasing beautiful character pixel art 
Eight stylized pixel art character figures in window packaging
This edition of the game is available exclusively on the Square Enix Store and its first batch is already sold out (although you can join a waiting list here)
The company says a &quot;small run of physical standard editions [of the collection] will also be available exclusively from the Square Enix Store from Spring 2023,&quot; but notes that quantities will be &quot;extremely limited&quot; so if you&#x27;re interested, you should preorder. 
For more information about each of these pixel remasters, head to Square Enix&#x27;s blog post. Check out our ranking of every mainline Final Fantasy game to find out where Final Fantasy I-VI land on our list after that.

                              <span>After 25 years, the latest season of the Pokémon anime saw protagonist Ash Ketchum finally achieve his dream of becoming Pokémon World Champion. Now that he’s reached the top of the mountain, the series is giving the perpetually young hero his last hurrah before kicking off a fresh adventure starring a new cast of characters.


The Pokémon Company announced that beginning January 13 (in Japan), Ash and Pikachu’s final chapter begins. It consists of 11 special episodes serving as a grand send-off celebrating the duo&#x27;s achievements. It also features some familiar faces from Ash’s past, including Misty and Brock.
Sometime later in the year, a new yet-to-be-titled animated series set in Scarlet/Violet’s Paldea region kicks offs. It stars two young trainers, Liko and Roy, joined by the three starters of that region: Sprigatito, Fuecoco, and Quaxly. The trailer also teases the appearance of a shiny Rayquaza.
So this is it. If you spent your childhood following Ash&#x27;s exploits or have stuck with him for his entire run, how does it feel to finally see the character get his flowers and ride off into the sunset? Are you looking forward to finally seeing a series starring new heroes and storylines? Let us know in the comments!</span>

                              <span>Fortnite is crossing over with another big anime. This time, the saviors of My Hero Academia join the fight. Beginning today, you can rack up victory royales as characters from the hit series, compete in a new game mode, and earn rewards by completing special challenges. 


You can purchase outfits for Izuka Midoriya, All Might, Katsuki Bakugo, and Ochaco Uraraka. Each comes with a matching back bling and pickaxe. New items include the Deku’s Smash item, which allows players to pummel opponents and structures by challenging the power of One for All. You can also pick up two new emotes: Symbol of Peace and Hero Analysis. All Might will also be showering the battlefield with loot-filled supply drops. 
You can sharpen your superhero skills at the Hero Training Gym. This new Creative mode lets players select one of three classes to face other players in team battles. You’ll earn Rescue Points for your squad by eliminating players or capturing Rescue Zones that pop up in the arena. The first team to earn 100 points wins the challenge. 
Completing limited-time My Hero Academia quests earns XP and special items in either battle royale mode or the Hero Training Gym. These missions are:
Complete the “Assist in Eliminating Opponents on the Hero Training Gym island” Quest to earn the Deku Spray.
Complete the “Secure Rescue Points on the Hero Training Gym island” Quest to earn the Plus Ultra Spray.
Complete a total of four My Hero Academia Quests to earn the Deku’s Glove Emoticon.
Complete a total of eight My Hero Academia Quests to earn the U.A. Cape Back Bling.
Fortnite&#x27;s My Hero Academia event runs until December 29.</span>

Soccer Story is a charming role-playing adventure that seamlessly builds a joyous and often goofy story around something as simple as kicking a ball. A cataclysmic event causes soccer to be banned unless sanctioned by the evil Soccer Inc. (with more than a few parallels to real-world FIFA), and our young hero’s father goes missing during the catastrophe. A year later, a magical soccer ball comes crashing into our hero’s life. What comes next is an often silly and fun story about bringing soccer back to the world, filled w…</span>

                              <span>PlayStation has revealed that Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2 will hit PlayStation 5 sometime next fall. 
This news comes after leaks from earlier this week indicating the game would be hitting the console in the fall of 2023. It seems those leaks were correct. While we do have this fall 2023 release window, PlayStation did not reveal a release date. 


&quot;What a year it&#x27;s been for PlayStation Studios; here at Insomniac Games we&#x27;ve been in absolute awe of the work of our peers,&quot; Insomniac Games creative director Bryan Intihar writes in a PlayStation Blog post. &quot;Congrats to everyone on a successful 2022... and here&#x27;s to next year being just as exciting as we continue to get Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2 ready for release next fall.&quot; 
Not much else was revealed about this upcoming sequel, but PlayStation says, &quot;Following the events of Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man and Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man: Miles Morales, the Spider-duo of Peter Parker and Miles Morales are back in the next blockbuster action chapter of the Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man series.&quot; 


The rest of the PlayStation Blog post details other upcoming titles, like Hogwarts Legacy, which had a gameplay showcase yesterday, Forspoken, which I previewed last week, and Final Fantasy XVI. Head there for additional details about these games and more. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer&#x27;s Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man review and then check out our review of Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man Miles Morales.

In April, Crystal Dynamics revealed that it was developing the next Tomb Raider game in its series that began with a reboot back in 2013. They did so during the State of Unreal 2022 presentation, revealing that this Tomb Raider sequel – the fourth in this rebooted series – will be built on Unreal Engine 5. Now, Crystal Dynamics has announced that Amazon Games will publish this sequel.

                              <span>Two months ago, Studio MDHR announced a physical retail edition of its smash hit Cuphead. The charming trailer features physical puppets of Cuphead and his friends out on the high seas, searching for sunken treasure. What they find is news of a physical and collector&#x27;s edition of Cuphead. The cute trailer runs at just around a minute long, but the set and puppet designs are intricate, making you wonder just how much work went into creating the trailer.
Today, the studio released a behind-the-scenes look at how its retail partner iam8bit created the sets and puppets of that trailer. You can get a look at the team building and shooting it in the video below.

                              <span>A new PlayStation Blog post highlights six new PlayStation VR2 titles coming from various Japanese developers, including a sequel to the 2000 PlayStation 2 rhythm game, Fantavision. 
Other games announced include action game Altair Breaker, rhythm game Kizuna AI – Touch the Beat!, and more. We&#x27;ll break down what PlayStation has to say about each of these six new titles below. 
Fantavision 202X
Fantavision is a puzzle-rhythm game released on the PS2 in 2000 and it&#x27;s somewhat of a cult classic. The series has remained dormant since that original release, but developer Cosmo Machia Inc. is bringing it to this decade with a brand new sequel called Fantavision 202X.

                              <span>Resident Evil Village&#x27;s VR mode will hit PlayStation VR2 the day it launches, February 22, and it will be available as free DLC to anyone who owns Village on PlayStation 5. Those who own the Gold Edition of Village will get it for free, as well. 
You will need, however, the $549.99 PSVR2 hardware in order to check out this new mode for Village, as its name suggests. The VR mode isn&#x27;t just a slice of Village; you can play through the entire campaign in this new (probably horrifying) way. And you can do so the day you bring home your PSVR2 system. 


&quot;A deeper and more captivating adventure awaits with PlayStation VR2, as Ethan Winters&#x27; journey takes full advantage of the headset&#x27;s advanced features,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;VR Mode utilizes the 4K HDR display, eye tracking, and 3D audio to make Resident Evil Village more realistic and intense than ever.&quot;
Capcom says the platform&#x27;s PSVR2 Sense controllers will add even more immersion to the new mode. 
&quot;These [controllers] represent Ethan&#x27;s famously resilient hands and allow intuitive actions to be performed in-game,&quot; Capcom writes in a press release. &quot;Players can hold up their arms to guard against enemies that get too close for comfort. Weapons all feel tangibly more realistic in VR Mode with new gameplay elements that dial up the immersion, such as dual wielding and natural motion controls for reloading firearms and brandishing knives.&quot;

                              <span>Driller aka Space Station Oblivion (in the US), the FIRST supported game of the Freescape engine, is ready for public testing!
Published in 1987 by Incentive Software Limited, this revolutionary new engine allowed players to explore a solid 3D graphic environment with complete freedom of movement for the very first time in videogame history. 
A new threat emerges after humanity abandoned a dying Earth to establish a new home on planet Evath. Evath&#x27;s moon Mitral has turned into a gigantic gas time bomb. A meteor is also due to impact Mitral in the next several hours. You were chosen to secure each of Mitral&#x27;s 18 sectors by positioning a drilling rig over the gas pockets in each sector before the meteor strikes.
Solve challenging riddles by relying on geological clues, intuition, or good old trial and error. To survive your mission, find Rubicon crystals to restore energy and destroy (or avoid) the Laser Beacons and Skanners left behind by the Ketars. Good luck!
Our reimplemented engine features graphics using software (TinyGL) or hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Driller support is limited to DOS (EGA mode), Amiga and AtariST releases, but we hope to be able to add more soon! Please contact us if you have some other release.
To play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.

The reason is the company wants to, in its own words, “move to solely support Epic Online Services with its unified friends system, voice chat features, parental controls, and parental verification features.” 
Epic states that by January 24, the following titles no longer be playable online (albeit with some caveats, which are noted). Epic has also started removing these titles from digital storefronts and will disable DLC purchases. Most of these games can still be played offline if you own them. The list of affected games are:

                              <span>Mega Man, Lan, and the whole NT crew are making their return via the Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection on April 4.


The bundle includes remastered ports of the 10 Game Boy Advance titles divided from the first six entries, such as:
Mega Man Battle Network
Mega Man Battle Network 2
Mega Man Battle Network 3 White
Mega Man Battle Network 3 Blue
Mega Man Battle Network 4 Red Sun
Mega Man Battle Network 4 Blue Moon
Mega Man Battle Network 5 Team Protoman
Mega Man Battle Network 5 Team Colonel
Mega Man Battle Network 6 Cybeast Gregar
Mega Man Battle Network 6 Cybeast Falzar
You can play these games solo or challenge other players in online matches. Legacy Collection even tosses in previously exclusive Battle Chips, such as those offered at Japanese promotional events. The collection also includes an optional high-resolution filter for each title, and museum features include over 1,000 pieces of artwork and nearly 200 music tracks. 
As an added bonus, Capcom announced plans to stream Seasons 1 and 2 of Mega Man NT Warrior, the anime that the Battle Network series is based on, on its Twitch channel early next year. The episodes will also be available to watch for free on Capcom’s YouTube page. 
Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection will be available on PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC.</span>

The pair show off everything the park offers, including Peach&#x27;s Castle, Bowser&#x27;s Castle, Toad&#x27;s Cafe, Yoshi&#x27;s Adventure, and a final battle against Bowser Junior. Universal Studios&#x27; rendition of the Mushroom Kingdom is magical and easily the best theme park we&#x27;ve experienced.
Earlier this morning, Nintendo announced that the first Super Nintendo World U.S. location is opening in February 2023.

At the time, PlayStation Productions said the Horizon series was happening at Netflix (read some details about that here) and the God of War series was being handled by Amazon. That was it, though. 
Now, we know a little bit more about this God of War series, courtesy of Amazon Prime Video, as reported by Deadline. Amazon Prime Video has officially given a series order to God of War and as the name suggests, it will be based on the hit PlayStation franchise (which just received a sequel last month). More specifically, it will take place during the Norse era of Kratos&#x27; adventures, seemingly bypassing his more gruesome and violent Greek history. God of War (2018) directo…</span>

                              <span>Developer Avalanche Software and publisher Warner Bros. Games has released a new gameplay showcase to highlight three different aspects of its upcoming wizarding RPG: the open world, combat, and the famed castle&#x27;s Room of Requirement. 
Hogwarts Legacy hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on February 10, with a recent delay pushing back the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions to April 4 and the Switch version to July 25. Perhaps as a way to soothe the news of yesterday&#x27;s delay, or as a way to get players excited about February, four new looks at Hogwarts Legacy gameplay have been released, and you can watch all four below: 
Each of these aired during today&#x27;s Hogwarts Legacy showcase.

                              <span>The first Super Nintendo World in the US will finally open in February. 
More specifically, the opening day will be February 17, 2023. This news comes by way of a new trailer showcasing what to expect in the new park within Universal Studios Hollywood. There&#x27;s a look at Mario Kart: Koopa&#x27;s Challenge, Yoshi&#x27;s Adventure, the decor of the park, and of course, Mario and Luigi. It looks fantastic, as expected, given how great Super Nintendo World in Japan turned out to be (check out our photo slideshow from our recent visit to the park).
Check out Universal Studios Hollywood&#x27;s video announcing the Super Nintendo World release date below: 


As you can see, the park is looking great. We can&#x27;t wait to visit one day! Universal Studios Japan opened its Super Nintendo World last year and back in June, Universal revealed that Hollywood&#x27;s Nintendo-themed land would be opening in &quot;early 2023.&quot; Now we know the opening day is February 17, 2023, so get your travel dates in order if you plan on visiting this new park next year.

Characters would ramble on as long as you stuck around to listen, and I would find myself standing in certain spots for upwards of five or six minutes, just listening to Roiland (who voiced many characters, Trover included) riff on one joke over and over again. While High on Life and Trover are two very different games, Roiland’s style of comedy is featured heavily in both. When I got a chance to talk to Roiland (an…</span>

                              <span>We are pleased to announce that ScummVM now supports Adibou 2, a popular educational game developed by Coktel Vision in 1996.
Designed for children from 4 to 7 years old, the world of Adibou is warm and full of surprises. It offers an intelligent and appealing introduction to essential knowledge like reading and math.
Whether you have young kids in your family, or are keen on reliving your childhood memories for a while, fetch the latest daily build of ScummVM, your own copy of Adibou 2, and start learning having fun with Adibou, Plop, Robitoc and Kicook!
You must copy the content of your Adibou “Environment” CD into the game directory added to ScummVM. Then, for any Adibou Application you want to add, just copy the content of their CD into a freely named subdirectory of the main game directory.
Only Read/Count 4-5 years, Read/Count 6-7 years applications are supported for now, but we hope Science, Music and English will come soon.
Currently ScummVM is aware of several Adibou versions in French, German and English, let us know if you own any language/version not yet registered. Please also report to the issue tracker any glitch you may encounter.
