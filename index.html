                    <span>A new Mystery Gift event for the latest Pokémon games, Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl (BDSP), is now live. 
This news comes by way of Serebii.net, which reported that the mystery gift event is now live for all players. Unfortunately, it doesn’t offer something like the shiny Zacia and Zamazenta recently distributed via Mystery Gift in Pokémon Sword and Shield. Instead of an actual Pokémon, this event is giving players some statues for their secret bases.

More specifically, the Mystery Gift code, MERRYCHR1STMAS, will give all players a jade-colored statue of Pacharisu, Lucario, Rhyperior, Electivire, and Glaceon. The smaller statues such as that of Pacharisu and Glaceon are quite cute, but if you’re looking for something more intimidating for your base, the Rhyperior and Electivire statues have you covered. The Rhyperior statue, in particular, is massive, standing nearly twice as tall as your player character. 
Players have until December 25 to redeem this Mystery Gift. 
Serebii.net also points out another Mystery Gift event that’s currently ongoing. From now until May 22, 2022, players can enter the code BDSPUNDERGROUND to get statues of Turtwig, Chimchar, and Piplup – the starters of BDSP.

                    <span>Deed-lightful.
Team Ladybug has something of a reputation of turning famous licensed properties into compelling Metroidvanias. After the opening PC-exclusive freebie Shin Megami Tensei: Synchronicity Prologue starring series mascot Jack Frost came Touhou Luna Nights, another ‘exploration action’ title featuring the endlessly popular Gensokyo gang. The team&#x27;s follow-up to that is the lovely-looking Record of Lodoss War: Deedlit in Wonder Labyrinth. Based on the novels/anime/manga/audio dramas/games of the same name. Helpfully for a game based on something that was mildly popular in the West 30 years ago, prior knowledge of titular heroine Deedlit’s high fantasy adventures isn’t required to enjoy the story here, with her generally learning things alongside the player and everything else either revealed with time or easily summed up as ‘someone/thing she used to know’.
More immediately recognisable than Deedlit&#x27;s past acquaintances are Wonder Labyrinth’s gaming influences. The spectacularly animated and cloaked 2D protagonist — sword in hand, double-jumping over gaps and smacking suspicious walls until they crumble — makes the game feel more Castlevania: Symphony of the Night than some of that trendsetting game’s own sequels. Unlike many other pretenders to Alucard’s crown, Team Ladybug’s latest effort is happy to see Konami’s classic as a springboard for its own ideas rather than something to be slavishly copied, and so for every expected feature (enemies dropping equippable weapons, warp rooms, and so on) there’ll be a major new mechanic to balance it out.

                    <span>&quot;Three new, experimental and winter themed levels&quot; coming soon.
Earlier in the year, Toree 3D was an utterly unexpected gem on Switch that we discovered by chance. A low-poly platformer with a PS1/Sega Saturn visual style, its breeziness and super-budget price were a breath of fresh air, with cheep (heh) and cheerful — but incredibly satisfying — gameplay that puts many a full-priced 3D platformer to shame.
A similarly super sequel, Toree 2, arrived back in October (indeed, it featured in the Nintendo Life Indie Spotlight) and developer Siactro has announced that a free update which includes a trio of new winter-themed levels is coming on Wednesday 22nd December at 10am PST.

                    <span>They&#x27;re typically focused on science fiction and fantasy works.
Slowly and surely, especially after a huge increase in attention in 2020, gaming is getting more attention in mainstream culture. In terms of sales and profits gaming has been at the forefront for many years, but the battle for acknowledgement as an artform has been a little slower, albeit the medium is starting to get similar critical attention as film, TV and literature.
The latest example came out of the 2021 Hugo Awards, which were hosted at &#x27;Discon III&#x27; in Washington DC over the weekend. A new game award was a one-off for that event, as The Hugo Awards typically focuses on science fiction and fantasy works; its origins were in literary works, but over recent years the awards have been gradually expanded and added additional categories.

                    <span>Those 160×144 pixels weren&#x27;t really made for the internet.
With its monochrome display and doorbell-style sound, the Game Boy could hardly have been described as cutting edge even back in 1989, so the idea of bringing it up to speed with WiFi connectivity sounds like the stuff of a madman&#x27;s dreams – but that&#x27;s exactly what hacker Sebastian Staacks has done.
Using his technological know-how and plenty of cool programming tricks, Staacks has created a special cartridge that bestows Nintendo&#x27;s classic handheld with the ability to browse the internet (well, Wikipedia, at least) wirelessly.

                    <span>A notable success for Innersloth and Maximum Games.
UK physical chart data is now in for the week ending 18th December, showcasing an Indie hit with a strong physical debut and a whole lot of the usual suspects.
Among Us is the big story of the week, with its Crewmate Edition making its debut in 5th place. Typically £3.89 on the eShop with relatively frequent (albeit modest) discounts, this physical version costs £27.99 but does have some rather nice physical and digital goodies included. It was released on multiple platforms, with Switch being the best performer with 39% of sales; for developer Innersloth and distributer Maximum Games it&#x27;s an impressive achievement to break into the top 10.

Yuji Naka was responsible for the cancellation of one of the Sega Dreamcast&#x27;s most promising exclusives, it has been revealed.

                    <span>If it works, it works.
Last week kicked off some tempting festive sales on the eShop, with all sorts of titles (mainly those that weren&#x27;t in the Cyber Deals extravaganza) having hefty discounts to help us part with our Holidays money. One that&#x27;s immediately shot to the top of the charts is Saints Row IV: Re-Elected, which is being shifted with a massive 93% discount.

Best Cheap Nintendo Switch Games - The Biggest Discounts On Switch eShop (Europe)

Normally $39.99USD / €39,99 / £34.99, it&#x27;s currently $2.79USD / €2,79 / £2.44, which for a sizeable open world game is rather bonkers. We&#x27;ve had multiple readers so befuddled by the discount that they assumed it to be some sort of mistake or glitch, but it&#x27;s just a big &#x27;ol official discount. It&#x27;s got another 10 days to run at the time of writing, which ties into the promotional window for a lot of titles that were in the official Holiday discounts that launched last week in Europe (this price cut is also in North America).

                    <span>As we enter the week of Christmas and get closer to the end of 2021, the release schedule has, as it always does this time of year, mostly evaporated. But that’s not a bad thing! In fact, this is often a great time to get caught up on some previous releases.

Now that Halo Infinite, the latest in a long lineage of stellar first-person shooters, has been out for a bit, two of Kotaku’s big series fans—staff writer Ari Notis and weekend editor Zack Zweizen—figured it as good a time as…

                    <span>Resident Evil Village is a great game! It’s easily one of my favorite games of 2021. But it’s also a game that can, at times, be scary or tricky to get through. So, I was surprised to see stats showing it as the most completed video game released in 2021.

                    <span>Yesterday, acclaimed writer George R.R. Martin (A Song of Ice and Fire) took to his blog to make a few comments about his role in the development of From Software’s upcoming Elden Ring. While the blog is short, the author is clear that his work on Elden Ring took place years ago, and focused on worldbuilding the fantastical realms that players will be investigating come February. In the blog, Martin comments that video games aren’t really his thing – but then goes on to say he played some old-school strategy games like Master of Orion, Romance of the Three Kingdoms, and Railroad Tycoon. Apparently Martin has some excellent taste with the games he chose to play back in the day!

Martin’s post is pretty clear, in that he worked on worldbuilding for the realms of Elden Ring. Exactly how this translates to the final game is unknown, but with what we saw in the network test, the world is full of discovery, even in that small slice. While the core foundational tale of the Tarnished and The Lands Between appear to have some significant similarities to the Dark Souls series right now, the world itself and much of that history is yet unknown, so we’ll have to wait and see exactly what happens. Martin also notes how video games have become bigger than films in the entertainment world these days. You can check out the entire post over on Martin’s official blog here. Martin also notes that Elden Ring looks “incredible.” On that final point, I’m inclined to agree.
Elden Ring is scheduled to arrive on February 25th on Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC. Are you looking forward to it?</span>

                    <span>That&#x27;s a lot of hours.

Just recently Nintendo gave us an insight into our gaming years on Switch; it provided a reminder that Mario is always watching when we play, and that we&#x27;ve devoted many days of the year to this lovely hobby of ours. Depending on region you get a neat page of information that covers your most played games, handheld / docked split, number of games played and more besides.

                    <span>Definitely not sugar, spice, and all things nice.
It turns out there can be such a thing as too much Christmas cheer, especially during the week before the big day when we’re sick of the sight of the cute snowmen shops have been hawking since October and rag-tag bands of singers are prowling the streets, vocally murdering every carol you thought you liked and having the gall to ask for money for doing so. It’s enough to make anyone turn to Home Alone’s Kevin McCallister for festive inspiration, rigging up red-hot irons and blowtorches to fend off anyone who dares to get too close.
Unfortunately in the real world his style of destructive improvisation is not seen as the ingenious work of a mischievous scamp trying to protect themselves from harm, so we’ll have to settle for the next best thing instead: Switch games that either allow us to be more than a little bit mean ourselves or give us the chance to escape for a short while into a world that’s more All Hallows’ Eve than Christmas Eve.

Samus&#x27; latest outing Metroid Dread has received a lot of praise since it arrived on the Nintendo Switch in October and now it&#x27;s been crowned #1 in TIME&#x27;s 10 best games of 2021.

Its online iteration is more popular than ever, yet if you look around Reddit and Twitter you’d assume it has no fans.

                    <span>After tackling Metroid in Season 1, the second season of Game Informer&#x27;s Video Gameography podcast moves on to one of the biggest shooter franchises in existence: Halo. Over the next several weeks, we&#x27;ll examine all of the mainline shooter entries up to Halo Infinite, so sit back and relax as we kick the season off with Halo: Combat Evolved.  
Developed by Bungie, Halo: Combat Evolved was positioned as the launch title for Microsoft&#x27;s promising but unproven Xbox. Released on November 15, 2001, Halo redefined the first-person shooter and immediately solidified the Xbox as a must-own console. It&#x27;s tough to imagine what Microsoft&#x27;s place in the game industry would be today without Halo&#x27;s success. Bungie became a household name, but the studio existed long before Halo and struggled financially prior to its launch. Twists and turns such as axing Halo&#x27;s original PC exclusivity and going through bizarre working titles such as The Santa Machine are just some of the fascinating topics we&#x27;ll unpack in this week&#x27;s episode. 
Join hosts Ben Reeves (@BenjaminReeves), Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), and Game Informer Editor-in-Chief Andrew Reiner (@Andrew_Reiner) as we unpack the history and impact of Master Chief&#x27;s video game debut.

                    <span>From Thanos to Batman, Fortnite is becoming a comic book fan&#x27;s dream come true. If Epic Games keeps adding Marvel and DC characters at a rapid-fire clip, there&#x27;s a chance we could have an awesome showdown of 100 heroes and villains years down the road. The latest addition is The Batman Who Laughs, a prominent character in the new Fortnite comic book published by DC Comics. Epic surprisingly didn&#x27;t create any skins for the recently released movie, Eternals.

                    <span>Handheld consoles are often home to a variety of niche games and genres, and the PlayStation Vita keeps that streak going. The system is a great buy for people who can&#x27;t get enough JRPGs and adventure games, but that&#x27;s not all it has to offer. We&#x27;ve compiled some of the top games for the system, including some fresh and familiar faces.
Sony doesn&#x27;t seem to be supporting the system as aggressively as it did when it launched, but it&#x27;s far from a barren wasteland. Japanese developers have taken advantage of its high-end portable specs to deliver gorgeous-looking RPGs, and indie developers have found a place to explore their comparatively smaller and quirkier ideas. There&#x27;s a wide variety of gameplay to be found on Vita, as our list highlights.

                    <span>Following its re-release earlier this year on consoles, Baldur&#x27;s Gate: Dark Alliance has finally released on PC today. No, not the sort-of-reboot from this summer. That&#x27;s Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Dark Alliance, a very different game. We&#x27;re talking about the OG! It&#x27;s been a 20-year journey for the action RPG, first released on PlayStation 2 in 2001, that saw ports on Xbox and Gamecube, but never Windows until now.
While its store description says it uses the 3rd Edition Dungeons &amp; Dragons rule set, Dark Alliance plays out more like Diablo than the more strategic-feeling Baldur&#x27;s Gate titles. You&#x27;ll play as one of three characters representing the archer, fighter, and sorceress classes, fighting hordes of mystical minions, and taking quests through Black Isle Studios&#x27; rendition of the Forgotten Realms. 
This updated release features higher resolutions (up to 4K!), solo or co-op play, and full controller support on PC. For those reading this, who prefer playing on console, you&#x27;re in luck. Baldur&#x27;s Gate: Dark Alliance is available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Switch, too. 
And now we wait patiently for Dark Alliance 2 to surface on current hardware. Once, again, we are not talking about a sequel to this summer&#x27;s game with a similar name.
Have you played the PC version of Dark Alliance yet, or even the console ports? How does the game hold up after all of these years? Conviene in the comments and chat with us about it!</span>

Update : Just months after a &#x27;Klonoa Encore&#x27; trademark popped up in Japan, a new trademark for &#x27;Klonoa Phantasy Reverie Series&#x27; has been registered in the UK this week. You can see the full listing over on the Intellectual Property Office.

Original story : Back in September 2019, word spread about the possibility of the classic Namco character Klonoa returning, after Bandai Namco filed some trademarks in Japan.

Originally marketed in Japan with bottles of tea labeled as “Windia’s Delicious Urine” — the ostensible excreta of Deathsmiles’ central protagonist — one has to wonder what exactly Cave’s aspirations were for this entry in their shoot-em-up canon.
A 2009 bullet hell shoot-em-up (or ‘shmup’), Deathsmiles is an eccentric pastiche of broomstick riding heroines battling the forces of darkness through fiery caverns and over Ye Olde English shipyards. Its roster of ‘Lolis’ (or ‘Lolitas’, for those less au fait with anime lexicon) are a group of female witches aged 11 to 17 that occupy Gilverado, a Halloween-themed world filled with dragons, wizards and giant, satanically possessed cows. Each character’s weapon and orbiting spirit familiar offer different advantages for survival and scoring, and shot types can be alternated between a faster (but weaker) laser, and a slower, more powerful cannon. Holding both buttons engages your familiar’s homing properties, allowing them to target anything within a specific range.

                    <span>&quot;people at Nintendo are very excited&quot;.
The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild sequel didn&#x27;t show up at The Game Awards and it left some fans concerned about the progress of its development. According to IGN&#x27;s boss Peer Schneider, there&#x27;s no need to worry.
In the latest episode of the IGN Games podcast (via a story on GamesRadar), Schneider mentioned how he spoke to &quot;some people in the industry&quot; who have supposedly assured him BOTW2 is still aiming for a 2022 release. Next year, in general, is also going to apparently be a very exciting one for Nintendo:

One day, bots will rule the earth. It is inevitable. Resistance is futile. Just like it was predicted in those Hollywood movies with the shiny skeleton robots and Austrian musclemen/politicians, in the not-too-distant future computers will become so smart that they won&#x27;t need us weak and feeble humans, and will probably wipe us out.
But it&#x27;s not all bad! Before we get to that stage, we can use these bots to create amusing content, such as news headlines, Ace Attorney cases or even Pokémon.

Another week finished as we get very close to the holidays. This week&#x27;s highlight was undoubtedly the latest Indie World showcase, the Analogue Pocket got some retro gamers very excited, Super Mario Bros. 3 still has some secrets, Commodore 64 games may be coming to Switch, and if you want insights into your gaming habits the Switch Year In Review is now available.
Now, though, it&#x27;s time to chill out and discuss our weekend gaming plans. A few members of the Nintendo Life team have done just that below, so feel free to give our entries a read and then join in with your own via our comment section. Enjoy!

Cruis&#x27;n Blast was released on the Switch in September, and since then fans have been asking for more. One common request seems to be for Nintendo to bring the classic entries to the recently announced Switch Online Expansion Pack.
It appears the creator of the series is just as eager. During a Reddit &#x27;Ask Me Anything&#x27; on the Nintendo Switch subreddit, Eugene Jarvis - the founder of Raw Thrills and creator of the Cruis’n series - was asked about the possibility of the N64 Cruis&#x27;n trilogy speeding onto the Switch. And while it appears to be up to Nintendo, he&#x27;d &quot;love to see it happen&quot;.

                    <span>I had some fun with the Wargame series of real-time strategy games, although past a certain point I couldn&#x27;t tell the difference between its umpteen historical tanks. Now developers Eugen Systems are making a spiritual successor called WARNO, which is coming to Steam Early Access next month.

For those of you more skilled than me, the trailer comes alongside the news that the DLC will launch January 6th.

Only kidding! I mean, statistically speaking I probably wouldn&#x27;t get on with all of you, but I actually really appreciate that you&#x27;re taking the time to read this and check out what games we&#x27;ll be playing this weekend. In fact, we&#x27;ll probably play loads of games over our breaks, but we&#x27;ll tell you about those later. Until I see you again, have a lovely time celebrating the end of the year, however you do it.

It&#x27;s not easy to release a kart racer in a world where Mario Kart 8 Deluxe continues to sell gangbusters on Switch, but alas, Nexon is bucking the trend and not only releasing their own kart racer, but it&#x27;s a free-to-play game, too. And it&#x27;s a fun time! 
Game Informer editor Wesley LeBlanc recently went hands-on with KartRider: Drift during the closed beta that ran from December 8 through December 15. During the beta, players were able to progress through 20 levels of both the free Battle Pass and Premium Battle Pass. Plus, two licenses of unique minigame-like challenges were available to play through, as were races in both the Item Mode and the Speed mode. 
In this New Gameplay Today, your hosts Wesley and Alex Stadnik will walk you through all that this beta had to offer. Thanks for watching, and be sure to let us know what you think of this upcoming free-to-play kart racer.</span>

                    <span>Halo Infinite is an epic return to form, a sequel that feels decades in the making. Within minutes of playing the campaign or multiplayer, nostalgia hits hard, and the title reminds us why Halo is one of gaming’s most important series. Infinite is easily developer 343 Industries’ best Halo game to date, an effort that honors the series’ 20-year legacy while blazing a new trail forward for Master Chief and the Spartans. No matter what mode you dive into, the gameplay delivers the iconic “feel” that made the series’ first entries hard to put down and expands upon it in a variety of excellent ways. Whether you are exploring a sprawling open world with Master Chief or are teaming up with friends for an intense battle in ranked play, Halo Infinite is a masterwork that pumps out excitement, maki…</span>

Henry Cavill has returned to reprise the role of the silvery-haired monster-slaying hunk Geralt of Rivia. Season two continues Geralt&#x27;s adventures, this time with his apprentice Ciri (played by Freya Alan) in tow. Also returning this season are Yennefer (Anya Chalotra), Vesimir (Kim Bodnia), Triss (Anna Shaffer), Lambert (Paul Bullion), and everyone&#x27;s favorite bard Jaskier (Joey Batey), among a bevy of newcomers.
Have no fear; this won&#x27;t be the last you&#x27;ll see of these characters! Season three has already been confirmed, so feel free to take in the show at your own pace – like me, who has yet to watch any of season one, though I&#x27;d like to very soon.
Catch eight brand new episodes of The Witcher streaming right now on Netflix, with at least one more season coming in the future. And remember, toss a coin to your Witcher, but not at your television. That probably won&#x27;t end well for the screen or your wallet.
Are you carving out time to catch this season of The Witcher? Which items and potions are needed to begin viewing Geralt&#x27;s live-action adventures? Let us know in the comments.</span>

                    <span>A not-so-long time ago in the same galaxy we all reside in, Respawn Entertainment deviated from its first-person shooter roots to create Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. This third-person action game was the studio’s first stab at tackling the coveted Star Wars license, crafting an original adventure set five years after Revenge of the Sith. It stars Cal Kestis, a padawan turned junker (played by Shameless star Cameron Monaghan) that managed to evade the Jedi purge of Order 66. After he’s outed by the Sith, he embarks on a quest to recover an artifact capable of locating force-sensitive children while also avoiding capture by the Inquisitors, who are elite Jedi hunters. 
The game features a blend of lightsaber combat and a suite of Force abilities. Borrowing inspiration from FromSoftware’s Soul series, encounters are challenging, requiring a strategic blend of blocks and parries to outduel opponents. Meanwhile, the various planets take on a Metroid-inspired progression with players unlocking abilities to backtrack to previously inaccessible areas.

Fallen Order was released November 15, 2019, and was a critical and financial success. It also served as a saving grace for single-player fans, providing proof to an increasingly multiplayer-focused EA that linear story-driven experiences can still make the big bucks. With a sequel reportedly in the works, we’re revisiting this gem of the Star Wars video game pantheon. 
Join Marcus Stewart, Daniel Tack, and Andrew Reiner on Twitch today at a special start time of 3 p.m. Central as we journey through the entirety of Cal Kestis’ adventure. Expect plenty of laughs, deaths, and general nerding out over all things Star Wars. We encourage you to hang out with us in chat.

                    <span>A new fighting game based on the Neople&#x27;s beat-em-up MMO Dungeon Fighter Online called DNF Duel starts its first beta test later today. The beta, which was announced on Sunday in the trailer below, will feature 10 characters from the roster, all of which are based on classes available in Dungeon Fighter Online.
Why should you care about a fighting game based on a Korean MMO you may not have heard of or played? DNF Duel is being developed in collaboration between Arc System Works, known for Guilty Gear and Dragon Ball Fighterz, and Eighting, the storied development team behind fighting games like Marvel Vs Capcom 3 and Bloody Roar. The pedigree behind DNF Duel is legit, and from the trailers released over the past few weeks, the characters look like they&#x27;re going to be really fun to fight w…</span>

                    <span>Tencent is making another big game development acquisition with the purchase of Turtle Rock Studios&#x27; parent company Slamfire, Inc, which includes Turtle Rock in the deal.
According to a press release shared with Game Informer, the Left 4 Dead and Evolve developers will remain an independent operation at its current Lake Forest, California office. It was also noted that despite the studio&#x27;s most recent release Back 4 Blood, which was published by Warner Bros. Games, the game and its continued development will not be affected. 
Steve Goldstein, president and general manager of Turtle Rock, had this to say about the acquisition, &quot;Tencent’s outstanding partners, global reach, deep knowledge of gaming and unprecedented support will help us create the kinds of ambitious games we dream of, while allowing us to retain our autonomy and independent spirit.”
Tencent, for the uninitiated, is a massive Chinese holdings company that has investments all over the video game landscape. Here are some other companies you may or may not know that Tencent has a stake in:
Riot Games
And many more. The above names represent anywhere from 100% ownership in the case of Riot Games to a small stake like Tencent&#x27;s 5% ownership in Ubisoft. With this newest acquisition of Turtle Rock and Slamfire, Tencent is bolstering its gaming portfolio even further with the veteran development talent.
No sale price was given at the time this story was written, nor were any details of any new games Turtle Rock may be working on past its current responsibilities regarding Back 4 Blood.

                    <span>Horizon Forbidden West, the much-anticipated sequel to 2017’s Horizon Zero Dawn, will finally hit PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 next February and it seems PlayStation is ramping up its marketing for the game. 
That’s because just over a week after a new trailer at The Game Awards 2021, Guerilla Games has released another trailer, this time giving us a better look at some of the new machines we’ll be fighting against in the game on February 18, 2022. Titled “Machines of the Forbidden West,” this trailer gives us a closer look at the armadillo-like Rollerback, the flying pterodactyl-like Sunwing, and the Slitherfang robot snake.

                    <span>Hot on the heels of Ghostbusters: Afterlife, it seems a new game based on everyone’s favorite busters could be on the way. 
That’s according to Winston Zeddemore actor, Ernie Hudson, at least. Hudson told YouTube channel Countdown City Geeks that a new one is on the way and that scheduling for recording voice-over is underway, as reported by Nintendo Life. Hudson also said fellow Ghostbuster Dan Aykroyd, who plays Ray Stantz in the films, is attached to the game as well.

“I just got an email because we’re doing another video game,” Hudson told Countdown City Geeks. “They’re scheduling it now to do the recording and I’m not too sure [who is] going to do it. I know me and [Dan Aykroyd], I think. I’m not sure [if Bill Murray] will do anything on it. So, there will be another video game…When they’ll bring it out, I don’t know, but it’s definitely happening.” 
Speaking further about the game, Hudson said whoever is developing it is sending him “prototypes of the character to get the image right.” He said the team seems to have a hard time creating his image, citing that while whoever is developing it is able to nail down Murray and Aykroyd’s likeness, he always ends up “looking like Eddie Murphy or somebody.” 
At the time of this writing, whatever Ghostbusters game Hudson is referring to has not been officially announced so it seems the actor let slip something he (probably) wasn’t supposed to. While waiting to learn more, check out our thoughts on the 2009 game in Game Informer’s Ghostbusters review and then read about how it was recently remastered and re-released in 2019.

It turns out I was miles behind the curve, as The Architect Colon Paris already exists.

It came out on PlayStation back in summer, alas they didn&#x27;t give a date for PC. But, surprise! It&#x27;s today! PC folks can finally try out the Baldur&#x27;s Gate that console users first experienced 20 years ago. I did a full playthrough this summer and had a lovely time, at the expense of my partner, who I made sit through one of the jankiest couch co-op games in existence.

We also get one final update on Imogen&#x27;s Apex Legends rank. I&#x27;d love to say it&#x27;s positive, but it&#x27;s actually quite crushing. Merry Christmas.

They didn&#x27;t have much to say about it at the time, but last night they announced it properly. Named Nine Sols, it&#x27;s an action platformer with combat inspired by Sekiro. Honestly, they still don&#x27;t have much to say about it beyond that, but they have released a gorgeous poster featuring a cat-like character that you can see in full below.

Five Nights At Freddy&#x27;s: Security Breach launched last night, inviting players to fend off a whole new crew of animatronics. This is the eighth mainline game in the long-running pizzeria-based horror series (I know, there are loads of spin-offs too), and for the first time it will let players properly roam free, rather than be tied to a desk monitoring cameras.

                    <span>Look outside. Is it snowing? Well, it&#x27;s snowing in video games, where it matters. The winter months are here to lay frosty waste to the Northern hemisphere, which is where list goblins like me originate. 
To celebrate the first flakes of glimmering ice wafting out of the sky like God&#x27;s own sub-zero dandruff, here&#x27;s a list of the best snow in PC games. Put on a hat, for heaven&#x27;s sake.

                    <span>They say the best things come in small packages, which is clearly nonsense in a world where giant novelty cheques exist but giant novelty bills don&#x27;t. When it comes to price tags, however, the smaller the better rings true, especially when it&#x27;s a full 50% off a quality gaming keyboard like the Corsair K65 RGB Mini.

                    <span>V úterý Steam vydal aktualizaci hry Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CSGO) s experimentální podporou Vulkan v Linuxu. Podpora funguje přes DXVK-Native, který překládá Direct3D do API Vulkan. Hru je potřeba spustit s parametrem -vulkan. Podobně již byly přetransformovány hry Portal 2, Left 4 Dead 2 a Half-Life 2 což je příprava na Steam Deck.</span>

                    <span>Transparent huge pages (THP) zrychlují práci s pamětí v Linuxu, protože umožňují pro aplikace transparentní použití velkých stránek paměti (na amd64 2 MB a u novějších procesorů 1 GB) místo výchozích stránek (u amd64 4 kB). THP je možné nastavit na never, always a madvise. Nastavení always může některé aplikace zpomalit, proto je často v distribucích výchozím nastavením madvise, tedy záleží na aplikaci, jestli při alokaci paměti použije madvise a tím dá najevo, že by použití velkých stránek mělo pomoci.</span>

                    <span>Today marks the 30th anniversary of the North American release of Nintendo&#x27;s first handheld gaming device, the Game Boy. Released in 1989, the Game Boy was a successor of sorts to the hugely successful NES, but was completely handheld. To commemorate the occasion we decided to debate our 10 favorite games released for the original handheld. You could argue the Game Boy and its successor the Game Boy Color were essentially the same system, but in order to keep this list as close to the original Game Boy as possible, we decided not to include great Game Boy Color games like Pokémon Gold &amp; Silver (which was playable on the original Game Boy, but released with the Game Boy Color logo on its spine) and Color-exclusive games like Metal Gear Solid (Metal Gear: Ghost Babel in Japan).

                    <span>Square Enix and Marvel have revealed a new collaboration with Adidas in the form of six new sneakers inspired by the universe’s most unlikely team. 
Announced today, this collection will launch in 2022 and feature six unique shoes, each inspired by one of the Guardians. There are two based on Eidos Montreal’s take on Star-Lord, and then one for Gamora, Drax, Groot, and Rocket. However, Square Enix did not reveal the price for any of these sneakers so we’ll likely learn more sometime next year. 
“A key starting point for the design of each sneaker was the unique visual cues from each of the characters – whether it’s the stitching details on Star-Lord’s leather jacket, Groot’s earthy color palette, or Drax’s unmistakeable tattoos,” Adidas senior designer James Liu said in a press release. “From there, we wanted to inlay various design discovery elements that helped further bring the story of reach character to life. Bringing it all together across the collection are unique signifiers for this original take on Guardians of the Galaxy as a Super Hero team – with matching sockliners, hang tags, labels, and packaging.” 
For more information about the collaboration and how the shoes came to be, you can read Square Enix’s full interview with Liu here. As for what the shoes are, here’s what you can expect: Star-Lord Forum Hi 84, Star-Lord Forum Mid, Gamora ZX 2K Boost 2.0, Drax Ozelia, Groot NMD R1, and Rocket ZX 1K Boost. Here’s what each looks like:

                    <span>It&#x27;s no secret Magic: The Gathering is returning to one of its most requested planes in Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty. Though a few years ago, Wizards of the Coast would have said it would be extremely unlikely we&#x27;d see the Japanese-inspired location represented in its own set again. Today, we&#x27;re getting our first good look at what Kamigawa is like in the present day, full of more bright lights and advanced technology than we&#x27;ve ever seen in Magic before.

The ongoing lawsuit from the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) against the company is over reported toxic workplace culture. The bulk of the suit focuses on &quot;violations of the state&#x27;s civil rights and equal pay laws,&quot; specifically regarding the treatment of women and other marginalized groups. To learn more about the proceedings thus far, including details listed in the lawsuit against Activision Blizzard, please check out our previous coverage here.

You&#x27;ll have to tune in to find out. At the helm will be editors and Video Gameography hosts Marcus Stewart and Ben Reeves and we may even have a familiar face or two pop in.

IGN spoke to 26 current and former employees of Bungie to create this report and, just under a week after its publishing, Bungie’s head of HR, Gayle d’Hondt, has stepped down. 
d’Hondt announced this to Bungie employees by email yesterday, and IGN saw said email in full. The former head of HR said she wants to do “everything in my power to make sure everyone who works here has a safe, welcoming, and supportive environment.” In doing so, d’Hondt said she feels Bungie’s leadership team needs to move forward with people new, or rather, people that haven’t…</span>

                    <span>The first event for Halo Infinite’s multiplayer, Fracture: Tenrai, wrapped up a couple of weeks ago and while it brought some new armor and game modes to the game, it was met with criticism largely surrounding the event-specific battle pass and its associated progression, store cosmetics, and more. 
It seems 343 Industries listened to feedback because yesterday, during a Halo Holiday 2021 livestream, the studio’s head of design, Jeff Hook, detailed various changes coming to Fracture: Tenrai when the event returns in January, as reported by Eurogamer.

Hook said during the livestream that the battle pass won’t have as many XP boosts and challenge swaps in it, as much of them will be removed and replaced with cosmetics. This addresses one of the main crit…</span>

                    <span>Red Candle Games is the team behind well-received horror games Devotion and Detention, but it teased a seemingly less spooky new project in March. The studio released a brief clip of a 2D action game labeled as a work in progress, and today we have a title and a hint at what the adventure entails.
The game is called Nine Sols, and Red Candle Games describes it on Twitter as a “hand-drawn 2D action platformer with Sekiro-inspired deflection-focused combat.” The game stars a vengeful hero on a journey to kill nine rulers, called Sols, of a forgotten realm inspired by Asian fantasy. This world was also home to an ancient alien race. The official art posted below reveals the protagonist’s cat-like appearance (which was obscured by a hat in the demo clip).
Nine Sols doesn’t have a release window or announced platforms, so it’s probably a ways off. Still, given the quality of Red Candle Games&#x27; horror titles, it’s exciting to see the team tackle something outside of what&#x27;s become their usual wheelhouse. 
In the meantime, check out our review of Red Candle Games&#x27; most recent release, Devotion.</span>

                    <span>Gearbox Software has released new details about its upcoming fantasy looter shooter, Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands, including word of two new classes, additional environments players will shoot through, and more. 
The team behind the game just released a new trailer during The Game Awards 2021 last week and today, it’s further detailing of what we can expect when the game is released on March 25, 2022, starting with two new classes.

The first new class joining the already-announced Stabbomancer and Brr-Zerker classes is the Spellshot. These are “gun-toting wizards who can unleash a constant barrage of spells and bullets and transform their enemies into harmless livestock with the snap of a finger.” The Spellshot can also weave gun and grimoire together to en…</span>

                    <span>The latest Back 4 Blood update, which goes live at 10 a.m. PST/1 p.m. EST, finally brings an offline campaign with progression to the multiplayer shooter. 
Since Turtle Rock Studios released Back 4 Blood back in October, players have been asking for a way to play the game offline and still be able to progress. That’s now possible thanks to the December 2021 update. This update also brings some other requested features to the shooter as well.

                    <span>Square Enix has temporarily halted sales of Final Fantasy XIV due to the ongoing Endwalker congestion issues. 
The company has also offered up additional free game-time to players who own the game or have an active subscription, adding another 14 days of time on top of the seven announced last week. This news comes by way of an FFXIV Lodestone blog post made yesterday by director and producer Naoki Yoshida. Yoshida originally issued warnings of expected Endwalker congestion in November and as predicted, the servers filled up immediately, with some players hitting queues with over 5000 people ahead of them.

It’s not surprising, though, considering the MMO added 1 million new players ahead of Endwalker’s launch.

More specifically, the MCU version of Spider-Man and MJ in Spider-Man: No Way Home will be hitting the Fortnite Item Shop today at 7 p.m. EST. That’s not all, though, as this Spider-Man will include Tom Holland’s “Integrated” No Way Home Suit and his Black and Gold Suit. Plus, it includes an emote that removes his mask. 
Those are just two of the new skins coming to Fortnite today. Now that the 2021 Winterfest is live, which runs until January 6, 2022, players can earn up to 14 presents from Sgt. Winter, including three outfits.

I began The Gunk with eager anticipation, blasting across the swirling clouds of the cosmos. The opening cinematic is beautiful and full of promise. Unfortunately, it is also the apex of the short game’s trajectory. In a game filled with alien worlds splashed with color and populated with extraterrestrial mysteries, The Gunk falls surprisingly flat. Fortunately, this spacecraft manages to stay afloat with likable characters, solid gameplay, and a serviceable story.  
The Gunk’s heroes, Rani and Becks, are a pair of plucky and impoverished space haulers. They touch dow…</span>

The event mode is free, but it arrives alongside a new battle pass that&#x27;ll cost money to enter.

More strangely, today&#x27;s update also introduces experimental gamepad support.

                    <span>The makers of Arma and DayZ have revealed Enfusion, the new cross-platform game engine they plan to build future games on. No, Bohemia Interactive haven&#x27;t announced Arma 4, but they do say they would use Enfusion for &quot;any potential new Arma game&quot;, so maybe that&#x27;s something to bear in mind while looking at its screenshots of vast landscapes. While they don&#x27;t have much more than screenshots and a wee video to show right now (sorry, engine enthusiasts), they do hint that they&#x27;ll release some sort of &quot;playable demonstration of its features&quot; at some point &quot;soon&quot;.

                    <span>The Epic Games Store Holiday Sale started today, with lots of discounts and that but more importantly: 15 days of free video games. They&#x27;re starting with one that I&#x27;m certainly curious enough to play for free but not buy: Shenmue 3. Yeah gwan, I&#x27;ll grab that. Epic are also going wild with coupons again, giving a £10 (or $10) coupon on every game you buy which costs at least £13.99 (or $14.99). Given Epic&#x27;s habit of paying for timed exclusives, they do have discounts on some games you&#x27;ll not get elsewhere, or at least not with those vouchers.

                    <span>Let me slap you with the caveat up front. Halo Infinite&#x27;s best place is its open world, through which you can swing like a honking metal Tarzan and do sweet Warthog jumps from cliffs. But its best level, the most satisfying A-to-B gun boulevard, comes late in the campaign (spoilers ahead). The House Of Reckoning is a series of rooms where contrived artificial battlefields have been constructed inside an alien fortress. They are abstractly human structures surrounded by sand, as if your extraterrestrial enemies have been playing house but believe a homo sapiens&#x27; house looked exactly like a chunk of Normandy beach circa 1944. The narrative reasoning behind this level is absurd. But the fights that occur within are excellent.

                    <span>God rest ye merry listener, let nothing you dismay - for today, for one night only, EWS stands for Electronic Wrestling Show. Yes, our podcast&#x27;s wrestling promotion has rolled into your town for a showstopping tag team match. Each of your pod hosts fields a three-game tag team of our favourite games of the year, and fields them in a spectacular(ly described) ladder match. The victor will claim the GOTY In The Bank briefcase and win the chance to compete next year as well.
Before we get to that, though, we must first discuss (at length) whether 200 t-shirts is a lot of t-shirts, what Nate is having for his Christmas dinner, what kind of cop duo would be named Halloumi &amp; Date, and also what our favourite Christmas songs are. Nate also does a really good Mankind pun. Plus: which wrestler would be the best hugger?

You can currently grab the WD Black P10 external hard drive in its vast 5TB configuration for a very reasonable £97 - it won&#x27;t be able to hold any wafer thin mints, but 5TB makes room for an awful lot of game installs.

In fact, I bet it attracts bad sleeps. Anyway, I’m considering the installation of a feathery net because DokeV’s music video from the latest Geoff Awards has infiltrated the darkest recesses of my brain again. I thought I’d shaken off the trailer song, but it’s back with full force and haunts me more than ever.

                    <span>Final Fantasy VII Remake certainly knows how to make a good first impression. The original&#x27;s bombing mission sequence, which sees Cloud and co. blow up a planet-killing mako reactor in the industrialised hellhole of Midgar&#x27;s city centre, was already one of the Final Fantasy series&#x27; best openers, but here we get to really luxuriate in every last detail of its twenty-four-year glow-up. Director Tetsuya Nomura may have a reputation for excess in JRPG circles (both in his tangled storylines and his passion for buckles and belts), but in FF7R that tendency toward indulgence has been applied with deadly, laser-like precision.

                    <span>CD Projekt have announced plans to pay out $1,850,000 (£1.4 million) to settle a class action lawsuit brought by investors over Cyberpunk 2077&#x27;s troubles. The suit started in December 2020 with investors primarily upset with the fact that the console version was in such a state, claiming that CDP hadn&#x27;t been honest about the game and its prospects. CDP say that the proposed settlement terms make clear that though they are paying out, this &quot;does not imply admission of any responsibility&quot;.

                    <span>It’s been nearly a year since Nvidia started reissuing older GPUs, like the GeForce RTX 2060 and GeForce GTX 1050 Ti, to help deal with the great worldwide graphics card shortage. More recently, Nvidia went a step further, quietly launching a brand new version of the RTX 2060 that doubles its VRAM to 12GB.


Emphasis on the “quietly”, mind – even if you’ve been regularly checking for available GPU stock or perusing our graphics cards deals guide, you probably won’t have even noticed there’s a 12GB RTX 2060 knocking around. So what’s the deal with this mysterious card, and should you even consider buying an RTX 20 series card in this day and age?

                    <span>The Gunk might not be the most sophisticated name in the universe for a gooey black jelly that pulses with an ominous red light, but goodness it sure is appropriate. As space haulers Rani and Becks touch down on a forgotten planet in search of a strange energy signal, the place is absolutely gummed up with the stuff. It oozes and throbs in the caves, plains and rivers of this once vibrant landscape, and the urge to suck it all up into Rani&#x27;s chunky power glove (a literal hand vac in this case) is overwhelmingly strong. After all, when it turns the ground black and saps the world of all its colour, this is one case of Extremely Bad Vibes you&#x27;ll want to remedy as soon as possible. 
Your reward for scooping up all the gunk in any given area is the kind of graphical wizardry video games do best. A burst of light, a shruum of sound, and the world is instantly transformed back to its former glory. Despite its gloopy namesake, The Gunk is frequently stunning, its soft pastels and coral-esque flora showing such an eye for jaw-dropping visuals that it&#x27;s hard to believe this is SteamWorld developer Image &amp; Form&#x27;s first ever 3D video game. If this is what they&#x27;ve been holding back on all these years, then their upcoming action adventure SteamWorld Headhunter should be a real treat for the old eyeballs. That said, while Image &amp; Form have clearly navigated their 2D to 3D transition from an art perspective, their typical flair for adding their own spin to different genres has been less successful. There&#x27;s a lot to like about this 3D action platformer, but it&#x27;s missing that spark to really make it sing.

This latest OlliOlli game swaps out the 2D style for a cel-shaded 3D world that looks absolutely lovely. Or radical. Or sick. Or other skater words. The action-platformer&#x27;s plot sounds great too, it drops you into Radlandia on a search for the skate gods. Skate gods! Don&#x27;t anger them, kiddos, they&#x27;ll break your collarbones.

Babble Royale is a new Scrabble-like battle royale where 16 players fight to be the last letters standing. You have to make words in such a way that you escape a zone that&#x27;s closing in, and attack other players by building words off of theirs. I honestly didn&#x27;t think it would work, but man, it absolutely does.

They&#x27;ve temporarily suspended sales of the game, as well as new registrations for the free trial version. Even adverts are being stopped for now.

The first full year of a new platform cycle is always exciting. Developers have new technologies to leverage in game releases, and players begin to glimpse the potential of new hardware. This particular new generation of gaming has had an unusual start. The global pandemic meant significant changes to development pipelines, causing production setbacks and global shipping delays. This resulted in games arriving later and new hardware that was difficult to find – even for the most diligent gaming enthusiasts.
Despite those challenges, 2021 came together as an excellent year for video games, filled with remarkable new experiences for players to enjoy. We’ve selected and ranked our picks for the 10 best releases of the year, detailing exactly why these particul…</span>

                    <span>In the year since its launch, Assassin’s Creed Valhalla has proven to be one of the more robust and popular installments of the long-running franchise. Recent entries like Odyssey received an impressive amount of post-release content in its first year. But even after releasing several successful, large-scope expansions in 2021, Valhalla is going strong and appears ready to outpace its predecessor by continuing its Viking voyage into a second year.
The Dawn of Ragnarök is the centerpiece of that ongoing rollout, a major new expansion set to be released in late winter, aiming to add a considerable chunk of new missions, environments to explore, and even gameplay-altering new character powers. That major expansion is steering toward launch in March, but you don’t need to wait that long to get…</span>

                    <span>Often overshadowed by the newest generation, games are still being built for and released on the PlayStation 4. After showing what Horizon Forbidden West looks and runs like on PS5, Guerrilla Games has given the world a glimpse at what Aloy&#x27;s next adventure looks like on the previous Sony console. 
In a tweet, Guerrilla offered a peek at four screenshots from Forbidden West running on PlayStation 4 hardware. While it doesn&#x27;t say whether the captures came from a PS4 amateur or a PS4 Pro, the vistas on display are still stunning to behold. Take a glance at the lush jungle flora with a mechanical bird hovering overhead, a desolate desert settlement, the Tallneck in all of its towering glory, and Aloy strolling through a pond riding atop what looks to be the horse-like Strider.

These images do look great, and yes, I&#x27;m sure if you put them next to their PS5 counterparts, you can nitpick which details may be missing, or how far the draw distance for LODs are. But instead, we&#x27;re going to take this preview of the rare PS4 visuals and celebrate how good they look on their own merits. If the performance side of the game pans out as well as these stills have, last-gen PlayStation owners may not feel as much pressure to find an elusive PS5 before Horizon Forbidden West&#x27;s February 18 release.</span>

Josef Fares referenced his infamous Oscars line while accepting It Takes Two’s Game of the Year award, Halo The Series got a first-look trailer, and Monolith is developing a new Wonder Woman game. But the festivities aren’t over just yet; Xbox is holding a demo event inspired by the awards that offers limited-time, hands-on looks at anticipated games. There are over 35 titles to check out, but not for long. The free celebration ends next week on December 21, leaving players a short window to comb through every experience. However, if you don’t have the time to sample them all, here are the demos you do not want to miss.

                    <span>A Plague Tale: Requiem was announced just six months ago during a Microsoft Xbox showcase and it was received quite well. Featuring the painterly and lush art style of A Plague Tale: Innocence, if one thing was clear with Requiem’s announcement, it’s that publisher Focus Entertainment and developer Asobo Studio are planning to up the ante. Today’s batch of in-game screenshots is proof of that. 
Released on Twitter earlier today, these four screenshots showcase some of what we can expect in Requiem. Based on what we know of the game so far, these screenshots show Amicia and Hugo in new cities south of France, which is the primary setting of the sequel.

Development duties are being headed by Ubisoft Toronto, and the game will be built on the company’s ever-present Snowdrop engine.
The reboot was announced after years of speculation regarding what the next step was for stealth icon Sam Fisher. In an article on the Ubisoft website, word of Splinter Cell’s resurrection comes alongside an interview with developers working on refreshing the series. Producer Matt West sheds some light on the team’s ideas for the project, saying, “To me, a remake takes what you’d do in a remaster and goes a little bit further with it.” He goes on to state the plan is to stick close t…</span>

A new narrative campaign for Terminator: Resistance just launched last week, and our war against the machines will bleed into 2022 with the newly announced RTS game, Terminator: Dark Fate – Defiance. Developer Cats Who Play and publisher Slitherine today released the first details and two short videos that give us glimpses at how this future war will unfold for PC players.
Set in the same universe as the Terminator: Dark Fate film from 2019, Defiance delivers a campaign experience that puts you in the role of the Founders faction&#x27;s commander and asks you to keep the last remnants of humanity alive. You may even have the chance to deal a devastating blow to the Legion&#x27;s machines. As you make progress, you&#x27;ll rally allies to your cause, but the choices you make could have consequences.

Cats Who Play revealed details that your weapons and vehicles will take on damage, meaning armor and hull integrity could wear thin over time and leave your troops vulnerable. If a building collapses, the physics-based debris could devastate your efforts. You can also use physics to your advantage to take out well-fortified enemy strongholds.
If you&#x27;d rather play as the machines, you&#x27;ll get the chance to do that in the multiplayer and skirmish modes. In these avenues of play, you can control the Founders, Legion, and Resistance. For multiplayer, the battles can be 1v1, 2v1, or 2v2.
Cats Who Play hopes to have Defiance out in 2022, although no specific date or season has been announced at this time.</span>

                    <span>Herschel “Guy” Beahm IV, known by most as Dr. Disrespect, has launched a “AAA game studio” with former Call of Duty and Halo developers. 
Beahm is one of the more well-known streamers out there, be it the audience numbers he pulls in when streaming or his public ban from Twitch after streaming inside of an E3 bathroom. He’ll still be streaming, but he’s now making the jump to the game development side of video games by way of new studio Midnight Society. 
Welcome to Midnight Society /// https://t.co/xuTZGJskyx pic.twitter.com/RWWQSaXcGY
December 14, 2021
“We flip the tables on the traditional video game development model and embrace the ‘Day Zero Community,’” the Midnight Society website reads. “That means including our players – yes, you – from the earliest most inception. That could be testing reload times and recoil patterns on a firing range or jumping in for the first-ever PVP sessions. No more ‘I hope this game will be good.’ Be there when your voice can actually make an impact because we want to hear it. Really.” 
As for what to expect from Midnight Society, the studio does not have a formal announcement for a game. However, all signs point to a multiplayer shooter. Be it Beahm’s involvement, former Call of Duty and Halo developers, the mention of “reload times and recoil patterns in a firing range” or the job listing description that urges possible employees to “step up, strap in, and start defining the next best competitive multiplayer experiences, period,” it seems Midnight Society’s first game will be a shooter.

The website features some images, too – seen above – that might hint at what the team’s first game could be. It might be concept art, but it could also be nothing related to whatever Midnight Society is working on as well. We&#x27;ll see sometime in the future.

                    <span>Sony Pictures Entertainment released the first official trailer for its upcoming Uncharted movie, starring Tom Holland as Nathan Drake and Mark Wahlberg as Victor “Sully” Sullivan, back in October and it featured plenty of iconic sequences from Naughty Dog’s action-adventure series. 
That trailer led many to speculate that while Uncharted takes place before the Naughty Dog games, opting to go with a much younger Nathan Drake, the movie would be touching on each of the games in some way. For example, we see the iconic cargo-plane-over-a-desert sequence from Uncharted 3: Drake’s Deception in the trailer. We also see Chloe Frazer in the trailer, a character who doesn’t appear in the games until Uncharted 2: Among Thieves, and the main antagonist seems pulled right out of Uncharted: Drake’s Fortune. 
If you were looking for a tie or connection to Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End, the newest poster released by Fandango today has you covered. 
As you can see in the poster, it’s quite reminiscent of Uncharted 4, or rather, one of the final settings in it. Near the end of Uncharted 4, our cast is swinging from pirate ship to pirate ship in search of pirate gold and an escape from a ruined pirate city. Nathan Drake eventually makes his way to what is basically a pirate ship graveyard and it looks a lot like what’s seen in the background of this new poster. 
As for how Uncharted will tackle this connection to Uncharted 4 – which mind you, is just speculation for now, but like, come on, look at it – alongside the nods to the other Uncharted games, we’ll have to wait and see when Uncharted is released in theaters on February 18. All that’s left now is to hint at The Lost Legacy and Golden Abyss. 
While waiting for this movie to release, check out the first official trailer and then check out this look at Nolan North, the voice actor of Nathan Drake, on set with Holland.  Are you excited about Uncharted? Let us know in the comments below!</span>

                    <span>A new trailer for Pokémon Legends: Arceus introduces players to the game’s two rival clans. The aptly named Diamond and Pearl factions (Arceus takes place in the Sinnoh region, after all) are factions you&#x27;ll interact with in addition to the previously revealed Galaxy Expedition Team. 
Both clans share a deep respect for Pokémon though they are divided by their opposing philosophies. The Diamond clan, led by the daring Adaman and his Leafeon partner, values living in the moment with your allies. The Pearl clan cherishes the land itself, and its leader Irida, along with her Glaceon, is suspicious of newcomers. The trailer also introduces Ginkgo Guild Merchants, a traveling guild you’ll purchase goods from.

                    <span>GTA Online’s new story update, The Contract, is now live, meaning players get to partner up with Franklin to help his new business succeed by helping Dr. Dre – yes that Dr. Dre – out of a jam. Before you head off on this wild adventure, Rockstar has shared new details about what The Contract entails. 
As previously revealed, you’ll be Franklin’s partner in his new business, F. Clinton and Partner, a fixer agency designed to solve celebrity problems. Your first client is Dr. Dre, who lost his phone containing unreleased music tracks. The Contract can be played entirely solo but you can also rope in friends/groups to play along should you choose. 
Music is central to The Contract, which introduces a new multi-genre radio station MOTOMAMI Los Santos. The station boasts exclusive new music fro…</span>

                    <span>Dead by Daylight just released its original story chapter, Portrait of a Murder, two weeks ago, but it seems Behaviour Interactive is already hard at work on what’s next for the asymmetrical horror game: Ringu. 
Ringu was first released in 1998 in Japan by director Hideo Nakata before it was remade as The Ring in the West by director Gore Verbinski, who would direct a trio of Pirates of the Caribbean movies for Disney (weird directorial jump, right?). Already a famous horror icon in Japan, Verbinski’s take further solidified the story of The Ring (and Ringu) as a classic in the genre. Now we’re all scared of videotapes, wells, and scary people emerging out of television screens. Behaviour Interactive will revive those fears with its newest chapter, due out in March of 2022.

                    <span>After eight years of radio silence, Ubisoft are finally bringing Sam Fisher in from the cold, as they&#x27;ve just announced a remake of the original Splinter Cell. In keeping with the series&#x27; stealth roots, the game was announced with little to no fanfare this evening via a blog post, with Ubisoft declaring its existence along with some developer chat before scampering back into the shadows. Typical.

                    <span>It&#x27;s not often those Nintendo Directs have PC-related news for us, but today&#x27;s announceathon had a little treat. Loco Motive is a train-based detective game published by Chucklefish (who also pubbed Stardew Valley and Starmancer), and is the debut game from developers Robust Games. There&#x27;s been a murder! And it&#x27;s your job to figure out who committed the crime. Classic whodunnit stuff that we&#x27;ll get to play next summer.

You can grab the excellent HTC Vive Cosmos Elite VR headset kit for £649. That&#x27;s £250 off the list price, as well as a return to the price that the full VR kit was going for on Black Friday. Surely, this is a sweeter deal than Tom Cruise&#x27;s Christmas cake.

                    <span>Nerves have been sufficiently jangled as of late, not least thanks to the slew of action packed games that have landed in recent months. I crave an altogether more sedate beginning to next year, and so my mind turns to games in which violence, reflex or any other kind of unblinking attentiveness takes a back seat. 
Looking for a broader mixture of games? Check out our regularly updated list of the best PC games you can play right now.
Primarily we&#x27;re talking violence-free games here, but I wanted to drill a little deeper than that - so nothing that generally requires a competitive streak. I&#x27;m chasing a certain feel rather than a certain category. Flying, walking, puzzling, driving, building, dreaming, climbing, stretching, swinging (not like that), swimming, wondering: these are just a few of the ways in which flashing pixels can make you feel a very different sort of accomplishment.

                    <span>I really don’t like gaming chairs. They’re expensive, often cumbersome, drastically over-designed things that lean way too heavily into the g4m3r aesthetic, and that’s coming from someone who’s built up something of a tolerance to it from years of unprotected RGB exposure. I’ve sat on them and have even shared homes with some of them, but have never, ever seen the appeal over a halfway decent office chair.


And then the Noblechairs Epic TX comes along, and it’s got me rethinking.

                    <span>Christmas is coming, PC gamers. The Untitled Goose is getting fat. Somewhere in the distant north, a scarlet priest works his elven minions into a frenzy as he prepares for the rite of the magic baby. Sprouts will be consumed in their millions, the Great Escape snoozed through by bloated grandparents far and wide. Most importantly, gifts of roughly equivalent financial value will be exchanged to demonstrate affection and prolong the reign of capitalism.

                    <span>I’ve been hands-on with Sifu, a beat ‘em up action-adventure game by Absolver developers Sloclap. My hands weren’t exactly “on”, but more “around”, actually. That’s one thing I learned from my time with this kung-fu caper. To keep my fists flowing, I needed to be patient, and not mash the buttons. Seriously, slap those buttons with zero thought and you’re dead.
Death in Sifu means you age, and if you die lots, you age faster. Hit 70 and you won’t be rising from the dirt again. Instead, you&#x27;ll have to start your quest for vengeance over from the beginning. While it can be tempting to cling onto your youth for this reason alone, I actually liked growing old, with my beard and my harder-hitting attacks. Not only do you develop a relationship with your body in Sifu, but your trips to the afterlife also help you master its myriad of moves. Sifu really does get better with age.

Ubisoft are giving the 2D side-scroller away as part of their 35th anniversary celebrations, which is wonderful news. It&#x27;s one of the best co-op games I&#x27;ve played, so it&#x27;s a perfectly timed freebie if you&#x27;re in need of something to keep friends and family entertained over the holiday period.

                    <span>Inscryption is, without a doubt, the best game I&#x27;ve played this year. It&#x27;s creepy, surprising, and superbly fun, and now you can play the best part for as long as you please. Developer Daniel Mullins has released a &quot;mini-expansion&quot; in beta on Steam, which (minor spoilers ahead!) makes its animal-based card game a standalone roguelike experience. Named Kaycee&#x27;s Mod, it&#x27;s slightly tougher than what you might have played already, and adds new challenges too, so you can keep going back in for more.

                    <span>When I finished watching The Game Awards reveal trailer for Rumbleverse, the new Epic-published battle royale game that looks a bit like Fortnite but with melee combat, I raised a practiced eyebrow of derision. &quot;Well, that looks terrible,&quot; chortled I, knowing full well that I&#x27;d still give it a go at the earliest opportunity because I am an absolute sucker for battle royales.
Two things happened later that day that I did not expect. First: I got the opportunity to dive into Rumbleverse&#x27;s action-packed 40-player matches far earlier than I&#x27;d anticipated, as part of a one day early look at the game. I downloaded and installed it in short order, and jumped right in. Two hours later, at 1am in the morning as the servers shut down, I happened across a second, far more unexpected thing. I found myself absolutely desperate to play more. I&#x27;ve sunk thousands of hours into Apex Legends, Fortnite, Plunkbat, Hunt: Showdown, Warzone, and various other behemoths of the genre. Yet those two hours I spent playing Rumbleverse might be the most fun I&#x27;ve ever had in a battle royale.

                    <span>Update, 12/14/21:
Slayer now has a dedicated playlist in Halo Infinite&#x27;s multiplayer. 
343 Industries announced yesterday that despite what the studio previously said, a Slayer playlist would be coming to Halo Infinite before the year&#x27;s end. In fact, the team announced that it would be coming December 14 and that&#x27;s today. As expected, a Slayer playlist can now be found in Halo Infinite after updating to the current build of the game. 
A Tactical Slayer (SWAT), Fiesta, and Free-For-All playlist have been added as well. For more information about these playlists, head to 343 Industries&#x27; full update breakdown.

                    <span>Nintendo showcased nearly 25 minutes of indie games during today’s Indie World Showcase, and if you weren’t able to catch it, or if you missed the name of the game you’re excited to check out, we’ve got you covered. 
Sea of Stars
Sea of Stars was announced in 2020 as a prequel to Sabotage Studio’s The Messenger, and while we saw it last year, which is where we also learned that Chrono Trigger composer Yasunori Mitsuda is helping compose the game’s score, today’s Indie World Showcase gave us another glimpse into its beautiful world. We saw a new trailer featuring some of its turn-based combat, stunning pixel art, and we heard a taste of what Mitsuda is cooking up. But perhaps the most exciting part was that we have a release window: Holiday 2022.

                    <span>Praey for the Gods has been in Steam Early Access since 2019, but it’s officially 1.0 as of…today! Furthermore, the game is also available on consoles. 
The game has been kicking around for some time, having first been revealed in 2015. It caught our attention thanks to its Shadow of the Colossus-inspired boss battles. Set in a frozen, open world, you play as a warrior outfitted with tools such as a glider and grapple hook used to scale titans as well as mountains and other structures. As a survival game, you’ll also have to catch food and craft items/equipment to survive the unforgiving landscape. If this is your first time hearing about the title, the launch trailer below offers a good idea of what the experience entails.

For those who have been playing the game in Early Access, the final version adds two final bosses, completes the narrative, and features a swath of quality of life updates/bug fixes.
You can play Praey for the Gods on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.</span>

                    <span>Praey Of The Gods initially looks too similar to Shadow Of The Colossus for comfort. And then you think: why wouldn&#x27;t someone make another game where you climb and bring low gigantic beasts? After almost three years in early access, Praey has reached v1.0, adding two new boss battles in the process.

                    <span>Stargate: Timekeepers was announced back in May with little more than a cinematic. Most of my initial interest was tied to its developer, Creative Forge Games, who made interesting-but-flawed stealth XCOMlike Phantom Doctrine.

Now there&#x27;s a soundless gameplay trailer of Stargate in action, and ooh, it looks a lot like Commandos.

The hope for crypto land barons is that they would be able to earn money back from other players through in-game business partnerships.

                    <span>Paralives Studio has given us all an early Christmas present, in the form of a look at Paralives&#x27; character creation tool. The video is pre-alpha footage and it emphasises that this is still a work in progress, but the character creator (called Paramaker, a name chosen by the game&#x27;s community) looks ridiculously detailed even so.
Paralives is a life sim game that may even have the chops to topple The Sims&#x27; supremacy when it launches. This video of the character creation is the beefiest look at Paralives we&#x27;ve had for a while. Marvel as the Paras change musculature, fat distribution and weight before your eyes. Importantly, you can give your Paras some sick tattoos and amazing patterned jackets, because what&#x27;s the point making a tiny puppet to play with if they&#x27;re not well cool?

Admittedly, the last two we&#x27;ve done (Darkest Dungeon and Wartales) have both been quite small with only limited numbers of codes available, but I&#x27;m pleased to say we&#x27;ve finally put together that long-awaited &#x27;big&#x27; free game drop that all premium supporters will be able to get involved with. 
That next free game is Plunder Panic, a swashbuckling pirate &#x27;em up in which teams of up to six players battle it out on the high seas. Here&#x27;s how to get your copy.

                    <span>Ever wanted to stick your pick deep into the centre of an octopus? How about a bug or a barnacle? If none of that tickles your pick(le)s you could try a keyhole which twists dimensions? Or perhaps one with a steampunk or frost-bitten feel? If literally any of that got your immersion senses tingling then three Skyrim modders have something for you. Creating a cache of realistic looking catches, they have brought the Dragonborn what they&#x27;ve been desperate for; a more riveting lockpicking experience.

                    <span>As someone with bipolar, I have often wondered why sinking several hours into something soothing such as Shovel Knight does so much for my soul. However I recently read that Geek Therapy, a non-profit advocating the use of video games for wellness, promote using world-building games such as Minecraft, Roblox, Animal Crossing, and Fortnite to help people deal with mental health issues. While play therapy has long promoted the therapeutic powers of escapism to imaginary worlds, it is more recently that thought has gone into how these online experiences can be used to combat my, I mean someone&#x27;s, anxiety and depression.

                    <span>Intel’s latest 12th Gen Alder Lake processors include some of the best gaming CPUs money can buy, and they’re not just a big step forward on pure power. They also add support for some new and up-and-coming technologies that that could form the bedrock for even better performance in the future, like PCIe 5.0 and DDR5 RAM. In fact, when buying a new, Alder Lake-compatible motherboard, you’ll have a choice to make: stick with DDR4 memory, or upgrade to DDR5?

                    <span>Activision Blizzard employees are becoming increasingly frustrated with the company, holding walkouts in the wake of damning reports and layoffs. It&#x27;s reached a point where ABK employees are organising a formal strike, and there&#x27;s been talk of unionisation - talk that ActiBlizz would like to stop. In an internal email, chief administrative officer Brian Bulatao discourages staff from signing an agreement with the Communications Workers of America union (CWA) - because &quot;active, transparent dialogue between leaders and employees&quot; is better than unionisation, apparently.

                    <span>Fights In Tight Spaces is about one specific trope that all the spy movies I’ve seen love to use: our main character’s got to a part in the story where they can relax a bit, inevitably they let their guard down, and on cue, a mystery assassin erupts from the shadows to take advantage of the opportunity. The hero’s got nothing but their brawn to make it out, but then, surprise! They actually use brains instead. Nobody ever saw it coming. The thing is, watching those movies, we all know the main character’s not really going to die. I mean, it’s called The Bourne Identity. There’d be no movie without a Bourne! (The Jeremy Renner one doesn’t count.)
Instead of non-stop fast and frenetic action, Fights In Tight Spaces goes for a different approach, and dissects those same action sequences into a turn-based battle. Rather than the scene being a choreographed piece of stunt and camera work that’s over in a matter of seconds, it’s a roguelike deckbuilder that puts the player in charge of every minute decision an action hero would have to make in one of those situations. Which means, if that untouchable main character dies at any point, it was because of what you did. Most of the time anyway.

                    <span>I usually don&#x27;t like comparing games when I review them, but I have a funny feeling I&#x27;m not the only one that was reminded of other moody puzzle-platformers when I first saw White Shadows. It&#x27;s a game that features a monotone colour pallette, a dystopian setting, an incredibly abstract story and the first few minutes had me pushing around boxes to get past obstacles, so yes, it will remind you of Playdead&#x27;s Limbo or Inside. White Shadows gets close to growing its own wings and taking off, thanks to an incredible emphasis on musical sections and cinematic presentation. Sadly, some uninspired puzzles and an incoherent final act clip its wings before it gets to soar.

                    <span>Update: Yup, it&#x27;s official.
Original story:
Later today, Ubisoft will announce something new for Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla. They&#x27;re not yet saying what it is but because Ubisoft either can&#x27;t or won&#x27;t keep a secret, leaks have sprung up. According to supposed screenshots and store info, it&#x27;s an expansion named Dawn Of Ragnarok with a lot of fantasy fanciness, journeying into Norse legend with Odin and dwarves and giants and that.

                    <span>While the Pacific map in Call Of Duty: Warzone ushered in a new WW2 era of beachside battle royale, it also added weapon bloom. Swings and roundabouts, or in this case, new islands and a frustrating feature that meant some of your shots wouldn&#x27;t hit their target. Thankfully Raven Software realised it wasn&#x27;t the most popular addition to the game and have begun the process of patching it out entirely. But it&#x27;ll take time to fully remove.

The next in the series was officially revealed during this week&#x27;s Game Awards, and you can find the first trailer below.

It&#x27;s simultaneously a bit Wind Waker, a bit Breath Of The Wild, and a bit Disney. This year&#x27;s trailer has all of the above, plus more of the animal and object possession and the ways you can use it in combat. Lovely stuff. Watch it below.

In the air: soap bubbles and excitement. One of my friends asks me whether Jinx is like that in-game. “It’s been a while, but I think so, yeah”, I reply.
I’m in the car on the way to badminton and I’m listening to the song Dynasties &amp; Dystopia from Arcane, the show based on League Of Legends. In the air: hip-hop and a bobbing head. Something significant has happened here. All of a sudden, I am obsessed with a game I shelved years ago, and yet I have no desire to go back. Is this next-gen? More than that, probably.

                    <span>While not as flashy as a new 4K monitor or one of the best graphics cards, an SSD can make a surprisingly big difference to your PC gaming experience. Storing their data in semiconductor cells rather than old-timey spinning plates, SSDs have considerably faster transfer speeds than traditional hard disks, and so can slash loading times right down. This also makes them generally more expensive, although prices are coming down all the time, this guide to the best SSD deals right now could help you find a particularly good bargain.

                    <span>I was wary of the possibility that White Shadows would be one of those platformers. You know the ones. The grim and depressing ones that despise you, with a child and a Stasi man, where the Stasi is actually memories of your daughter, and the child has to throw the puppy in a blender to get over a hedge.


With its stark monochrome look, ominous industrial environments, and dystopian themes, I can&#x27;t really deny that White Shadows is of that genre. But while I normally get bored of depressing platformers within half an hour, I enjoyed this whole thing and even the credits.

                    <span>When I heard that Quantic Dream are making a Star Wars game, I felt much as I did when I found out my home town Swindon had been twinned with Disney World: you&#x27;d have expected Disney to Google some stuff first.
Still, last night at The Game Awards we all got a first look at Star Wars Eclipse in the form of a cinematic trailer. And let&#x27;s be honest: that trailer is cracking. It&#x27;s really good. And it&#x27;s so good that I think we all need to remember that there is absolutely no way QD aren&#x27;t going to spectacularly boot this.

                    <span>Needs must, gentle friends, needs must, and in particular I need to once more head into the dank and dreary evidence basement of the RPS treehouse. Here, at the behest of our very kind supporters, I must navigate a strange maze of specimen tanks, suggestions of whiskers, tentacles and odd wings occasionally stirring behind the glass as I pass. Eventually I will reach a row of grey filing cabinets, locate the right drawer, and tug it open, the scream of rusted metal echoing through the dark room.
I will spend some time rifling through the papers within, growing more and more frantic as I hear the slow tread of heavy footsteps approaching. I must find the right file, but also I must escape in time! I haven&#x27;t been caught yet. Today I escaped with the fifth episode of The Nate Files supporters-only podcast. It&#x27;s about speculative biology. Oh no.
