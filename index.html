See, it’s like Thief but has guns. Oh, and Resident Evil 4’s inventory Tetris, which is possibly the best inventory system ever invented. Witness for yourself in the trailer below.

                              <span>There was a lot going on in the 19th and early 20th centuries, and Paradox&#x27;s grand strategy game Victoria III aims to simulate pretty much all of it, starting in 1836 and giving you a century to play with. A big selling point is that every inhabitant of your nation is simulated, from lowly farmer to high rolling capitalist, each having preferences and beliefs. Balancing the political needs of your state against diplomacy, economy and, you know, war, will take a lot of wrangling of lists, menus and percentages, which you can see in the new gameplay trailer debuted at the PC Gaming Show.

Come the 40th anniversary in November, they plan to release a big Microsoft Flight Simulator update with helicopters, gliders, iconic historical aircraft including the Wright Flyer, and more. But that&#x27;s the future. Right now, the game has received a taste of far future with the release of Halo Infinite&#x27;s Pelican aircraft as a real plane you can really fly in Flight Sim.

                              <span>The Xbox &amp; Bethesda Games Showcase for 2022 has now wrapped, bringing plenty of trailers and announcements for upcoming games on Xbox and PC. The rule for this showcase, as outlined early on, is that every game shown will launch within the next 12 months. What the future will actually hold remains to be seen, but Xbox certainly sound optimistic at least. With Starfield, Hollow Knight: Silksong, Diablo IV, and much more shown at the event, there’s plenty to cover. Let&#x27;s get started then, shall we? Here&#x27;s a reminder of every announcement and trailer from the Xbox &amp; Bethesda Games Showcase 2022.

                              <span>Cocoon is an insectoid puzzle adventure that’s being developed by Jeppe Carlsen, the lead gameplay designer of Playdead’s Inside and Limbo. The game was announced at today’s Xbox &amp; Bethesda Games Showcase, and its worlds-within-worlds reality hopping system has already blown my mind a little. Check it out for yourself in the trailer below.

Capcom has confirmed that its exciting new scrapper Street Fighter 6 will indeed have fully redesigned rollback netcode, and will not simply port the online infrastructure that powers previous entry Street Fighter V. The news was revealed by SF6 director Takayuki Nakayama in an interview with IGN. (Suspiciously, it appears that the interview has since been made private.)
&quot;SFV also had rollback netcode, but SF6 will have rollback netcode [but] it&#x27;s not going to be the same as what we had in SFV,&quot; said Nakayama (in dictation recorded by Eventhubs). &quot;This is something that they&#x27;re building from scratch. There&#x27;s a lot of effort being put into the development of the netcode.&quot;
Street Fighter V has had something of a rocky history with online play. Casting our minds …</span>

                              <span>You can probably tell what I picked already
We&#x27;ve been through a State of Play, Sonic Central, Summer Games Fest, Devolver Direct, a Netflix Gaming stream, the Epic Games Store Summer Showcase, a Microsoft event, and the PC Gaming Show together. It&#x27;s been a trip! &quot;E3 2022&quot; has been trying at times, but now is the time to share your favorite reveal of this past week.
For me, it was the Persona on Xbox announcement. The fact that this trio of killer games is coming to PC [beyond what we already got], Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and Game Pass, is pretty huge news. Although they&#x27;re older releases (well, Royal technically isn&#x27;t that old), it&#x27;s a trifecta announcement: so I&#x27;m kind of cheating here.
It&#x27;s just lovely to see this series live on, on as many platforms as possible. I can still recall the first time I played Persona 2 with my cousin; huddled away in my relative&#x27;s house: never realizing how big this series would one day get. I watched Persona 3 claw its way onto the PSP after a PS2 release, and now, it&#x27;s coming to Xbox consoles, potentially before PS5 and Switch. That&#x27;s wild!
A bit of housekeeping for what&#x27;s on the horizon. So to be clear, all the major showcases are done as of this afternoon. The next stream is the Capcom showcase at 6PM ET tomorrow, followed by the 10-minute FF7 celebration shindig on June 16. Oh and if Nintendo plans a surprise Direct next week, there&#x27;s that. You can find a list of confirmed streams here.
But again, as of today, what was your favorite reveal? As a reminder, here is what some of us wanted to see.

So another PC Gaming Show is in the bag! And as usual, it was a bit uneven. There was some cool stuff in there! And some not so cool stuff like ads for stuff no one wants and trailers of old games. We sifted through the bigger things so you didn&#x27;t have to.
Below you&#x27;ll find a collective of the main headlines, but the big takeaway: this showcase did not need to be two hours long on a US Sunday afternoon/European night. I know some things absolutely need to be done to pay the bills (where was Drake&#x27;s Cakes?!), but the PC Gaming Show has been around for seven years. At this point there are a lot of lessons learned to impart over the years that could be used to create a slicker show with less downtime.
It wasn&#x27;t the worst that PC Gaming Show had to offer, i…</span>

                              <span>Devilishly good.
Though the manga only started in 2016, Demon Slayer has gone on to become one of the most successful media franchises in existence—even passing up the likes of Sonic the Hedgehog and Minecraft in raw sales. Despite this, Demon Slayer has had shockingly little presence in video games; aside from a Japan-only mobile game that still has yet to release, the only other game is Demon Slayer: The Hinokami Chronicles. This release came to other platforms just this past fall, and now the Switch version has come with all the post-launch DLC from those releases. Though it has some flaws, we found Demon Slayer: The Hinokami Chronicles to be thoroughly enjoyable and we think you should consider giving it a shot.
The story of Demon Slayer follows Tanjiro, a young man with an axe to grind with demonkind. Prior to the events of the game, a demon attacked and killed his family while he was away—one sister survived, but she didn’t get much of a better deal given that she was turned into a ferocious demon. We take on the role of Tanjiro just as he’s about to complete the final step of his training to become a proper Demon Slayer. Once he’s done so, his goal is then to avenge his family’s death by killing the demon who murdered them and hopefully to find a cure for his sister somewhere along the way.

It&#x27;s pretty well known at this point that Toby Fox&#x27;s Undertale took quite a bit of inspiration from the Mother / Earthbound series. Heck, you only need to play Undertale for 5 minutes to see the similarities! Fox&#x27;s love for the Mother games goes all the way back to his high school days, during which he created ROM hacks such as Earthbound: The Halloween Hack.
Given his adoration of the Mother series, Fox naturally had aspirations of contributing to a potential new game, and even toyed with the idea of asking its creator, Shigesato Itoi, about whether or not he wanted to see a new game come to fruition. Ultimately, after hearing what Ito had to say on the success of Undertale, Fox chose not to bring the subject up.

The latest UK charts data is in and it&#x27;s another strong week for the Nintendo Switch, with a total of five exclusive titles making up the top ten.
At number one, unsurprisingly, is Mario Strikers: Battle League Football. Released just last Friday, the game has clearly resonated with Switch fans, despite some rather mixed reception. Nevertheless, we loved the game, and gave it a solid 9/10 in our own review.

With the Summer Game Fest now in full swing, rumours of a Nintendo Direct taking place during the month of June continue to gain traction. With no word from the Big N itself regarding an upcoming showcase, we&#x27;re unfortunately left to scrounge around for every scrap of information we can possibly find.
Thankfully, the latest rumour comes from a rather credible source and points to a Nintendo Direct occurring on Wednesday, June 29th - that&#x27;s a little over two weeks away! It comes courtesy of Alanah Pearce, former games journalist for the likes of IGN and Rooster Teeth and now writer for Sony Santa Monica, who mentioned the date at the end of a live-stream during which she reacted to the latest Xbox/Bethesda Games Showcase.

If you tuned into yesterday&#x27;s Xbox &amp; Bethesda Games Showcase then you were probably hoping to catch a glimpse of the GoldenEye 007 remaster – also known as gaming&#x27;s worst-kept secret.
We know the game exists, but it wasn&#x27;t announced during the show – but you needn&#x27;t be too downhearted because indie developer Replicant D6 lifted the lid on a homage to Rare&#x27;s classic FPS during the PC Gaming Show, which also took place yesterday.

It&#x27;s a very interesting laptop and well thought out for Linux use with an AMD Ryzen 7 PRO 5850U SoC and integrated Radeon graphics for satisfying the preferences of many Linux developers preferring a fully open-source driver stack. Thanks to the large scale manufacturing of HP, it&#x27;s also a competitively-priced Linux laptop compared to many of the Linux laptops from smaller vendors that are based on Clevo or other white box laptop designs.</span>

                              <span>An unexpected and fun surprise from the PC Gaming Show was the reveal of Klei Entertainment&#x27;s newest game. Rotwood is a multiplayer action game, and it&#x27;s expected to enter early access at some point, but that date is up in the air for now.


Thanks to the Steam description, we know a little more about Rotwood than what was revealed in the trailer. It&#x27;s a roguelike dungeon crawler designed to be played with up to four people. Each run will bring your cute animal avatars through a dangerous forest where the challenge amplifies the deeper you go in. New armor and weapons can be crafted from items scavenged, and a safe haven can be built up and fortified as well.
In typical Klei style, the hand-drawn look of the characters and enemies is unreal. Once again, the studio is pushing the boundaries of making it look like you&#x27;re controlling a cartoon character; Rotwood&#x27;s models are expressive, fluid, and bursting with personality. I can&#x27;t wait to see what Rotwood looks and plays like in action when I can eventually get my hands on it.
The trailer gave an early access date of &quot;202?&quot; which could be anytime in the next decade, though I&#x27;d expect us to play it well before 2030. Rotwood can be wishlisted on Steam, and it&#x27;s unknown whether Klei is planning for release on any additional platforms at this time.</span>

                              <span>If you stick your hand in the bone trunk, you deserve what you get. That&#x27;s my new motto, after watching the latest trailer for the first-person Giger-esque horror game Scorn. This trailer has the same world of bone and flesh as all those before it, but with the added twist of a release date: this October.

                              <span>I had just kind of assumed that if you sail a ship in Sea Of Thieves you&#x27;re a captain, you know? I know it doesn&#x27;t give anyone that title, but I figured whoever was hosting the game just kind of was it. But it turns out I am a FOOL and that nobody was a captain at all. All that is going to change when Season Seven of the MMO pirate &#x27;em up arrives next month, as confirmed in a jaunty song at the Xbox &amp; Bethesda Showcase. Players are getting a whole raft of &quot;Captaincy features&quot; - and these include being able to name your ship and customise the interior.

                              <span>Obsidian have announced that their co-op garden survival game Grounded will burst forth from early access into a full 1.0 release like a seed in your backyard this September. A story campaign playable in co-op or solo will explain how Grounded’s kids were shrunk by a mad scientist, and probably persuade me to finally give it a go. Watch out for colossal bugs in the trailer below.

Only, since it&#x27;s the new game from the developers of Frostpunk and This War Of Mine, I&#x27;m guessing the stakes are higher than whether Gywneth Paltrow gets it together with John Hannah. For one, you&#x27;re creating alternatve versions of yourself in order to survive on a rickety base rolling across an alien world.

Now the publishers Frozen Forge are back with The Constructors, revealed at the PC Gaming Show. The Constructors is a simulation game allowing you to climb up another rung on the parasite ladder (following on from last year&#x27;s landlord sim The Tenants, by the same devs Ancient Forge Studio) as you own a constuction company, and build and design housing estates.

Rotwood is its name, and cartoony dungeon-crawling is the game. Up to four players can join together for online hack &#x27;n&#x27; slash action, or you can play it on your lonesome if you&#x27;d rather. Here, check out the announcement trailer below.

Ravenlok is clearly channelling Alice In Wonderland a fair bit, and Cococucumber do refer to it as a “fairytale reimagining”. It’s due out sometime in 2023. Watch the mushroom-laden trailer below.

                              <span>We all remember 2019&#x27;s A Plague Tale: Innocence, the inspiration for the famous phrase &quot;rat&#x27;s entertainment!&quot; that you still hear shouted in music halls up and down the country. The blend of action-adventure, stealth and seething hordes of rats is getting a sequel later this year, taking our miserable medieval tots Amicia and Hugo to the south of France for A Plague Tale: Requiem. In a gameplay trailer shown at the Xthesda showcase tonight we saw that Amicia is struggling with whether or not she should kill the heck out of soldiers, or try to stealth on by.

                              <span>It must be a relief to ActiBlizz to have some good Diablo 4 news, given how everyone on Earth is ragging on Diablo Immortal 24/8 (when we are not open-mouthed at the stream of terrible news about the company, from numerous allegations of harrassment, misconduct and discrimination, to the company advising shareholders to not approve a proposal to report on harassment and discrimination). But at the Xbox &amp; Bethesda Showcase tonight they were able to share that Diablo 4 is coming out next year for some much anticipated ARPG antics. Why, that&#x27;s the Diablo game people keep saying they want!
Plus, the Necromancer is confirmed as the fifth playable class. There&#x27;s a moody trailer that tries to make being a Necromancer sound twisted and dangerous and a hard path to walk, but it mostly makes it sound like Necromancers are cool badasses with loads of skeleton best friends.

Those are free-to-play games, which means what you&#x27;ll really getting for your subscription is access to some of the bits that would normally be locked behind real money or the grind. In League Of Legends, for example, a Game Pass subscription will unlock all 160+ of the MOBA&#x27;s champions.

                              <span>Not-E3 2022 continues today with the Xbox and Bethesda Games Showcase, and we’ll be liveblogging it right here. Will we see more of Starfield that isn’t CGI target footage and concept art? Could we get a closer look at Playground Games’ mysterious new Fable? Will Redfall get its first major public appearance since, uh, the last the Xbox and Bethesda Games Showcase? Dunno, but you can watch the whole show via the stream embedded below, and follow along with commentary from myself and vid bud Liam. The curtain raises at 6pm BST / 7pm CEST / 1pm ET.

                              <span>The trailer for Morbid Metal from tonight&#x27;s Future Games Show had a lot of metal (the music genre) and metal (the stuff you make blades out of). Morbid Metal is a hack &#x27;n&#x27; slash, but the difference here is that you have four different mech lads at your disposal, and you can morph between them whenever you like. This real-time switching means Morbid Metal moves very quickly. You might think hyphenated phrases like &quot;high-octane&quot;, &quot;action-packed&quot;, and &quot;fast-paced&quot; are moving in the direction of this game, but buddy this is going at such speed that they&#x27;re already here.

The developers say they need more time to make the engine trails glow just right, and to make the derelict megastructures mega enough. We will apparently see more of the game in action this August, though.

If there&#x27;s one thing that the PC Gaming Show nailed this year, it was remembering not to forget to show New Blood&#x27;s Gothic first-person adventure Gloomwood, which previously had the misfortune of being left off of the show by accident, and uploaded to social media once the stream had finished. Oops.
Anyway, those who have been waiting to dive into its gory gaslit world will be pleased to hear that Gloomwood finally has an Early Access date, and will be opening its creaky wooden doors on Steam come August 16. Gloomwood&#x27;s stealth &#x27;n&#x27; slash action will come as snug entertainment to those who enjoyed that &#x27;90s Thief titles, which clearly presented a form of inspiration to the New Blood devs.
In between all the creeping and cranium-axing, players can also indulge in a spot of suitcase arranging, ala Resident Evil 4, which as fans know is almost a compelling game in and of itself. If this is your first time hearing about Gloomwood, then be sure to check out the trailer below to get yourself up to speed on New Blood&#x27;s latest old-school-cool release. Check out the trailer below, which features several titles from the New Blood catalog along with some e-e-edgy comedy.
Gloomwood goes live on Steam Early Access August 16.

Leikir Studio had premiered the first trailer for its upcoming ecological city-builder, Synergy. Making its world premiere at this year&#x27;s PC Gaming Show, the new title sees a struggling people efficiently utilize their surroundings in order to thrive and survive in a mysterious, fictional land.
As you can see from the trailer below, Synergy boasts a pleasant illustration style and holds tight to its themes of harmony, ecology, and community to sustain the homes, food, and resources of its civilians. Explore the surroundings for new food, minerals, and materials; research new forms of education and social evolution; and watch your community progress from the brink of oblivion to a harmonious, thriving, and self-sufficient settlement.
Synergy is now available to wishlist on Steam.

                              <span>A new adventure from some of the community&#x27;s best modders
Valve&#x27;s catalogue has been modded again and again, and has even given birth to iconic titles like Garry&#x27;s Mod and The Stanley Parable. Now the modding community is taking on the studio&#x27;s most recent release, Half-Life: Alyx, to build on the game&#x27;s world and characters and deliver a whole new narrative adventure. It&#x27;s called Half-Life Alyx: Leviathan, and we got a full eight minute gameplay demo during today&#x27;s PC Gaming Show.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;4WE1qf3Z_-s
We got a look at some close encounters, tense shootouts, and even a brief cameo by the ever-iconic Gordon Freeman. Leviathan looks indistinguishable from the real Half-Life: Alyx experience, and it looks like it&#x27;s shaping up to be a must play for anyone with a VR headset.
The project was created by modders FMPONE and Corey Laddo, and is set to release sometime in 2022 on Steam.

Backfirewall is one of the more interesting games shown off during the PC Gaming Show today: it&#x27;s about an OS that doesn&#x27;t want to update. That alone has me intrigued! PC Gamer, says that it&#x27;s a &quot;tragicomedy,&quot; and is a self-aware parody at points, with elements of Stanley Parable and Portal.
Described as a series of &quot;puzzles and gags,&quot; in Backfirewall you&#x27;ll explore various bits of the OS, including different types of apps, to swipe through the narrative. Apparently there are shades of Toy Story afoot, with the intent of having players ponder the inner workings and feelings of an OS. You&#x27;ll become attached to OS9, as the OS10 update arrives: and decide what to do from there.
Creative drector Julia Jean had this to say about the premise: &quot;We want players to feel like they&#x27;re playing inside a Pixar movie while also reflecting on the rather mindless way in which we interact with our everyday digital devices. If you think twice before you update your phone after playing Backfirewall, our job is done!&quot;
It&#x27;s also one of the few games shown today in the PC Gaming Show coming to Switch! It&#x27;ll arrive on PC, PS4, PS5, Switch, Xbox One, Xbox Series X later this year. A demo is available now until June 20.

Publisher Frontier Factory and developer KeokeN Interactive have offered up a new trailer for the atmospheric space adventure Deliver Us Mars, which is currently in development for PC and console platforms ahead of its September release date.
Set on The Red Planet itself, Deliver Us Mars follows a young explorer and her robotic drone pal as the duo embark upon a mission to locate and recover a selection of ARK colony ships from the sinister force, The Outward. KeokeN promises &quot;a suspense-filled, emotion-fuelled narrative alongside music from award-winning composer Sander Van Zanten, state-of-the-art motion capture, stunning graphics and real-time ray-traced shadows and reflections, powered by Unreal Engine.&quot;
Already this summer has been jam-packed with space adventures, but it seems that Deliver Us Mars might be dialing back a little on the horror, focusing more on its exploration, adaptation, and deep adventure — not that it won&#x27;t feature its own fair share of outer space peril, of course. It&#x27;s not looking too bad at all, as you can see for yourself in the new trailer below.
Deliver Us Mars launches September 27 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

The highly anticipated sequel to Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine is over a decade in the making, and fans are thrilled to finally be getting some more info about the game. It was officially announced at the start of this year with a thrilling new trailer, and today during the PC Gaming Show, we got to hear from the devs at Saber Interactive themselves about their experiences bring Space Marine 2 to life.
Saber&#x27;s chief creative officer Tim Willits is a developer with a ton of experience, going back to 1990&#x27;s id Software days when they were making influential titles like Hexen and the ever-iconic Quake. Willits let us in on the origins of the space marine trope, which is well known in games from the Doom series: &quot;I bet many people do not know that the original DoomGuy was …</span>

Roughly a year ago, our own Jordan Devore gave us a pretty in-depth look at Agent 64: a GoldenEye/Perfect Dark/TimeSplitters homage from studio Replicant D6. The PC Gaming Show today gave us another look at some Agent 64 gameplay via a new trailer.
While we didn&#x27;t get a ton of new info, we did get some kernels due to a new piece from PC Gamer. It&#x27;s &quot;out in early access later this year,&quot; and no multiplayer is re-confirmed, alongside of multiple difficulty modes. The game will feature a CRT visual filter, and some portions of the game have been shored up as a result of the 2021 alpha testing: including quicker firing control considerations, and a more arcadey feel with hip-firing. The team also reminds us that the demo is available now on Steam.
A lack of multiplayer could be seen as a missed opportunity, but it&#x27;s actually kind of refreshing in a way. I know I&#x27;ll be able to just dive into this, finish it up, and put it on the shelf. In an era of endless games as a service, it&#x27;s a welcome respite. &quot;Early access later this year&quot; doesn&#x27;t quite grab me though! I&#x27;m in when it&#x27;s done.

                              <span>What Happened to Marissa Marcel?
This afternoon, audiences for the PC Gaming Show got to see a new trailer for Sam Barlow&#x27;s upcoming FMV mystery, Immortality. The new title, leading on from hits Her Story and Telling Lies, will launch on PC and Xbox Game Pass on July 26.
Immortality tasks the player with uncovering the mystery behind the disappearance of failed actor Marissa Marcel, whose three uncompleted movies never saw the light of day. Utilizing groundbreaking linking mechanics, the player is tasked with finding links between scenes, using props, characters, and the scenery itself to uncover the answers hidden behind Marcel&#x27;s ultimate fate.
While FMV games are renowned for their limited appeal and slight player interaction, Barlow has won plaudits for finding ways to take the genre to a whole new level, bringing in interesting and novel ideas, quality performances, and compelling mysteries to hold the player&#x27;s interest throughout. No doubt that Immortality will see Barlow once again make something special out of the genre&#x27;s limited toolset.

Fans of both Shin Megami Tensei and its sister series Persona get to see the two combine in a new indie project. Necrosoft Games&#x27; Demonschool mixes school life, tactical RPGs, and horror cinema into a devilish blend coming next year.
Announced during today&#x27;s PC Gaming Show, Necrosoft&#x27;s new RPG is coming to PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch alongside the PC and Steam Deck.
Demonschool follows freshman Faye, the last in a line of demon hunters. During her time at school, she&#x27;ll have to juggle socializing with fighting possessed students and preventing summoning rituals. You know, an average school day at the college for supernatural investigators.

                              <span>Welcome to Eden
When I think post-apocalypse, I usually think dark, dull, and depressing. The upcoming farming simulator I Am Future is ready to change that narrative with a sunnier outlook on the end of the world. Taking place about six months after the event that supposedly ended it all, the game is full of vibrant blues and greens as nature has reclaimed the urban landscape in an area named Eden.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;9Fs1ACCUxgg
I Am Future&#x27;s protagonist is as optimistic as they come, too, as he is seemingly unperturbed that he&#x27;s the only human as far as the eye can see. He&#x27;s at least excited to get started on rebuilding, and I have to give him credit for being a man who knows what he wants. According to an article from PC Gamer, you can play I Am Future at your own pace -- there&#x27;s no one to answer to, no grinding to reach the top of the proverbial pile. It&#x27;s farming, building, and good vibes, and I honestly couldn&#x27;t be more here for it.
I Am Future is set to release for PC sometime in 2022.

During today&#x27;s PC Gaming Show, Shiro Games dropped a teaser trailer for an incredibly sinister-looking psychological horror, Decarnation, which is currently in development for PC.
While little detail pertaining to the adventure&#x27;s narrative was revealed, the short montage depicted what seemed to be a young woman who finds her days and nights invaded by her own inner turmoil made flesh. Combining body horror, nightmarish imagery, and the type of horrors that can only be crafted in the human brain.
Check out the nerve-jangling trailer below, along with several other updates coming to other titles in the Shiro Games catalog. Decarnation will launch at some point in 2023.

                              <span>Still no release date
Nightdive Studios&#x27; System Shock remake was shown today at the PC Gaming Show, with a surprise appearance from classic game designer Warren Spector. He mused on how primitive the old UI was for the original, and the &quot;unfortunate&quot; nature of the modern era not really seeing the influence of System Shock.
He also told PC Gamer the following:
&quot;I think of myself, as much as anything, as a relentless advocate for a particular kind of game, the genre we call immersive simulation. Games that are designed to let the player feel—basically force the player to feel—like it&#x27;s them in the world, with as few distractions and &#x27;game-y&#x27; things as possible. System Shock was really, at the time, the most advanced version of that, and I can&#x27;t tell you how much the team is responsible for that.&quot;

It&#x27;s still due out on PC, PS4/PS5, Xbox One/Xbox Series X. Keeping in time with every reveal so far, there is no release date in sight for it! If we eventually get a release date, or even a real window for this thing, it just wouldn&#x27;t be a System Shock remake trailer.

                              <span>Slay the Spire has eaten through a few hundred hours of my time, and ever since I&#x27;ve been scouring Steam for another great deckbuilding roguelike. While the crossover subgenre is relatively small, we&#x27;re seeing more and more of them these days, including the new cyberpunk kung fu-themed title Nitro Kid. The game was revealed today during the PC Gaming Showcase, and I&#x27;ve already added it to my wish list.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;Qsr3GPYa9I0
The trailer shows off bombastic action gameplay (or at least how bombastic card-based play can be) as the player climbs through the floors of a giant skyscraper that has been taken over by an evil megacorporation. The soundtrack features over thirty Synthwave tracks that have been composed specifically for Nitro Kid, which should add to the game&#x27;s exciting atmosphere as well.
We don&#x27;t have a release window for Nitro Kid just yet, but there is a demo currently available to download on its Steam page.

                              <span>Those are two things I&#x27;ll endlessly give the time of day
Mahokenshi may not have come out in &quot;Q1 of 2022&quot; as originally envisioned, but it&#x27;s coming, and will bring cards and hexes along with it.
The PC Gaming Show gave us some new gameplay, and also confirmed a &quot;2023&quot; date, showcasing the Steam version of the game, with a wishlist option. You can find that here on Steam.
Here&#x27;s what our own Zoey Handley had to say about the early access build:
&quot;I know I just said that I’m not one for Early Access, but I did check out the demo for Mahokenshi, and it was sublime. Taking surreal visuals derived from Japanese folklore and combining them with card-based hex-strategy proves to be a winning flavor. You build up your deck, dish pain to your opponents, and complete objectives. I already love what I see from Mahokenshi and am looking forward to the release of the full serving. I’m not necessarily a fan of deck-building games, but this one puts its cards to good use.&quot;

11 Bit Studios (of This War is Mine fame) has revealed its brand new title, The Alters, during the PC Gaming Show.
The intriguing-looking adventure sees a space builder, stranded far off on a distant planet, who is forced to, essentially, clone himself again and again in order to find a way back home. The protagonist must create versions of himself sporting new and unique skills, but might find himself losing a little of himself each and every time.
The developer promises drama, mystery, horror, and quirky ingenuity as our hero finds himself surrounded by alternative versions of himself. Frankly, I know a few folk who would be super happy with that scenario. The Alters is currently available to wishlist on Steam, GOG, and Epic Games Store.

                              <span>It&#x27;ll be made with player feedback in mind
We&#x27;ve seen a few games so far at the PC Gaming Show, and while a few were old, Endless Dungeon looks intriguing, as the name literally just tells us what we need to know about it: dungeons are the focus. Duh!
It&#x27;s from the development team Amplitude, published by Sega. Here&#x27;s a quick roundup of what to expect from PC Gamer:
&quot;Despite being known as a 4X developer, Humankind and Endless Space&#x27;s Amplitude Studios also knows its way around a tactical roguelite. 2014&#x27;s Dungeon of the Endless zoomed in on the Endless sci-fi universe, creating random adventures through monster-infested dungeons instead of tales of galactic-scale conquest and intrigue. And while Amplitude isn&#x27;t calling it a direct sequel [it] has that same spirit.&quot;

Yep! It seems to be a loose follow-up of sorts to Dungeon of the Endless, which some of you folks may have heard about. Note that this one is hero-based, and there&#x27;s a preview of Zed and Bunker now on the company&#x27;s YouTube channel. While &quot;open development&quot; is typically something I don&#x27;t really pay too much attention to until the thing is actually out: I can add this one to my endless list of &quot;things I will probably try eventually.&quot;

If there&#x27;s one thing I love, it&#x27;s a narrative adventure game, and I&#x27;m in luck with Starward Industries&#x27; upcoming title The Invincible. Based on the 1964 Polish novel of the same name, Stanisław Lem&#x27;s work of hard sci-fi was at the forefront of commentary on microrobots and swarm intelligence. It&#x27;s giving Firewatch meets Annihilation vibes, and that makes for a pretty cool video game premise if you ask me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;13nRHDoUz6s
The game was announced last year, but this is the first time we&#x27;ve gotten a good look at some gameplay -- what we saw today at the PC Gaming Showcase was an early beta build of the game. We saw scientist Yasna as she navigates an unknown planet in an attempt to recover the equipment from a previous expedition, and of course, things don&#x27;t quite go according to plan. This looks like a really chilling, grounded narrative experience, and this short gameplay clip alone is enough to send The Invincible to the top of my list of most anticipated games.
The Invincible will be coming to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X sometime in 2022.

                              <span>Vegetable Wars
During today&#x27;s PC Gaming Show, Klei Entertainment dropped a trailer for its animated wildlife brawler Rotwood.
Anthropomorphic critters will battle their way through killer vegetables, monsters, and other baddies in dungeon-crawling, brawling action with a Saturday Morning Show vibe. A fun-but-not-really joke saw the game get a release date of 2024, and that became 2023, and that became 202? So I guess we don&#x27;t know when it&#x27;s coming.
You&#x27;ll have to tide yourself over with this trailer.

                              <span>Slated for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S
Soulstice is due out later this year, and it has serious Good Action vibes if the development team can really deliver on it. It&#x27;s got style, that&#x27;s for sure! Here&#x27;s the new trailer from the PC Gaming Show today, which provides a more cinematic flair (though plenty of gameplay is available at this point, see below).
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;ncf202F8jfg
I&#x27;m a sucker for any stylish looking action project, though how that action actually ends up paying out drastically differs from game to game. A lot of similar titles attempt to marry an intriguing world and a technical action system, but fall short of either, or both. Hopefully Soulstice manages to sidestep those sins.
The folks over at Modus confirmed a PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X release for Soulstice, with a Deluxe Edition to boot. It&#x27;s out on September 20, 2022. The Deluxe version comes with a digital artbook, digital soundtrack, and the &quot;Ashen Blade item pack.&quot; The cover art is good enough to warrant a look in a local gaming store, too! I&#x27;ll be keeping an eye on Soulstice come September.

In case you missed it, the team provided a 10-minute look at the Soulstice combat system last month:

So that wasn&#x27;t bad! No weird ads from The Rock peddling energy drinks and comic book movies. No awkward or cringeworthy skits. Just an hour and a half-ish of pure games: here&#x27;s a Microsoft and Bethesda recap for the 2022 &quot;E3&quot; showcase stream.
We began with a new look at Redfall, which gave us an endearing showing of gameplay: noting its stark differences to other similar squad-based shooters. From there it shot into Hollow Knight: Silksong, and although we didn&#x27;t get any concrete info on the release date, we know that it exists! I&#x27;m glad someone finally showed that thing at some stream in any form (how many Nintendo Directs was it rumored to be at? All of them?).
Those two kind of defined the Microsoft and Bethesda 2022 Games Showcase as a whole. …</span>

The closer to today&#x27;s Xbox and Bethesda showcase was, of course, Starfield. The upcoming spacefaring RPG is hotly anticipated, and today Bethesda showed off a lengthy look at some Starfield gameplay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;zmb2FJGvnAw
The Starfield gameplay starts with the player and their robot companion venturing out onto a planet. After gawking at some local wildlife and mining some ore, they infilrate a base and take on some space pirates.
The gunplay looks surprisingly action-heavy, with futuristic but chunky versions of weapons ringing out as they blast their way through.

Then, once the action subsides, we get a look at New Atlantis and some of the social areas the player can explore. The narrative seems to cen…</span>

During today&#x27;s Xbox and Bethesda Game Studios showcase, Hideo Kojima of Kojima Productions mailed in a short video to announce that he was making a new title in collaboration with Xbox... And that&#x27;s it.
I guess for many that will be more than enough news, but I can&#x27;t help but admit it was pretty funny to just see Kojima basically say he was making a game, and then simply bail. No &quot;Overdose&quot; trailer? Nothing at all? I guess not. But, for fans of Kojima Productions, you can at least take heart that yer boy is once again back at the drawing board, preparing another undoubtedly odd tale in collaboration with the black and green brand.
We&#x27;ll no doubt be hearing more about the game in the coming months.

Here&#x27;s the full rundown: Persona 3 Portable, Persona 4 Golden, and Persona 5 Royal will be playable on Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, with P5R confirmed for October 21, 2022, and P3P and P4G coming sometime in 2023, according to an Xbox release calendar.

How many hours of JRPGing are we going to need to set aside?

There&#x27;s a new adventure on the horizon, and it looks absolutely gorgeous. Cococucumber, the creator of Echo Generation, have revealed its new game Ravenlok.
Ravenlok is a fairytale story about a young girl and her quest to fulfill a dangerous prophecy. It&#x27;s an action-oriented RPG, with an absolutely brilliant look. That&#x27;s not really a surprise, given how pretty Cococucumber&#x27;s particular style has looked in the past.
The adventure sets out in 2023, coming to Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. It&#x27;ll also be a day-one Xbox Game Pass title.

If you&#x27;re a fan of games like Inside and Limbo, you&#x27;re in luck, because the gameplay designer who worked on those titles is also heading up a new project called Cocoon. It&#x27;s a colorful puzzle game that&#x27;s also being published by Annapurna, which is a great seal of approval in my eyes The game&#x27;s puzzles have to deal with different colored orbs, which the player uses in different ways, like opening pathways, building bridges, and even controlling little robots.

Cocoon is still shrouded in a lot of mystery, but it&#x27;s easy to tell how much polish it has even from this premiere trailer alone. We don&#x27;t have a release window yet, but we do know that Cocoon will be coming to Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and Xbox Game Pass.

                              <span>&quot;A dark fantasy version of the Later Han Dynasty&quot;
Today during the Microsoft 2022 showcase, we got to see a reveal for Team Ninja&#x27;s latest action romp: Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty.
It&#x27;s described as a &quot;dramatic, action-packed story of a nameless militia soldier fighting for survival in a dark fantasy version of the Later Han Dynasty where demons plague the Three Kingdoms.&quot; Quite a mouthful! Even if this ends up being &quot;Three Kingdoms Nioh,&quot; I&#x27;m so here for it.
Xbox boss Phil Spencer says it was &quot;exciting to work with Team Ninja&quot; for this collaboration. It&#x27;s been exciting to see Team Ninja rise to the occasion in recent years, myself!  Following quite a few fumbles, most notably Yaiba: Ninja Gaiden Z, one of their lowest points, they knocked it out of the park with Nioh just three years later. After that they continued to assist in various Warriors games, and gave us Nioh 2, as well as Ultimate Alliance 3. The Ninja Gaiden: Master Collection reminded us of their storied history, and Stranger of Paradise, while polarizing, was interesting from an action perspective.
Now we have Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty next year. It&#x27;s out in early 2023 on PC, Xbox consoles, and cloud devices.

We got a glimpse of Ereban: Shadow Legacy at the Xbox &amp; Bethesda Games Showcase, and if you&#x27;re into faster-paced stealth games, it&#x27;s worth a look. Raw Fury and developer Baby Robot Games showed a new trailer with cool wall-climbing shadow abilities, and confirmed the PC and Xbox Series X/S title will be playable day one on Game Pass.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;sC9u7sM2RVk
As super dramatic as the trailer was, the footage looks pretty fluid and fun.
Story-wise, you&#x27;re playing as the &quot;last Ereban,&quot; so all of the sneaking around and shadow-morphing will be in service of figuring out &quot;who you are and what happened to your people.&quot; (And, presumably, getting lots of well-justified revenge along the way.)
&quot;Traverse the ruins of lifeless cities, infiltrate sci-fi facilities carved into ancient temples, and discover the remnants of your forgotten race,&quot; according to the team. &quot;Absorb echoes to learn more lethal and non-lethal shadow powers, craft high-tech gadgets, and combine all this with your agility to infiltrate Helios lines and investigate what they are hiding.&quot;
Ereban: Shadow Legacy will be out on Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and PC in 2023.

The very concept of Metal: Hellsinger appeals to me from the first note: Slay demons in a modern Doom-style first-person shooter to the beat of newly recorded tracks from some big names in rock and metal. As someone who grew up playing the original Doom and loves the modern iterations of the franchise, and has perhaps sunk more time into the Rock Band series than any other franchise, The Outsiders&#x27; upcoming game checks a lot of boxes. Still, coming into my hands-on time with the game, I was skeptical. Thankfully, the short demo I played at Summer Game Fest (which is also a…</span>

                              <span>After a long absence, Nightdive Studio&#x27;s remake of System Shock made an appearance at the PC Gaming Show, and it&#x27;s looking pretty cool. You can watch the trailer below for yourself, along with an interview with series creator and industry luminary Warren Spector.


This new trailer for System Shock gives a great look at the game&#x27;s visual style, which toes the line of using modern graphical techniques while paying homage to the low-res look of the original game. More specifically, some of the in-game panels and monitors are intentionally blocky and pixelated, as if they were textures from a 90s first-person shooter. SHODAN, the antagonistic AI who is ever-present in System Shock, is also a prominent feature in the trailer as she talks smack to the player as they explore the Citadel Station.
System Shock is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.</span>

                              <span>11 Bit Studios, the developer behind This War of Mine, Frostpunk, and Children of Morta, is making something new and a bit more surreal. The Alters is a sci-fi adventure where one man trying to survive and get home from a mission that&#x27;s gone wrong finds all the help he needs in himself. Or rather, himselves.


 
Jan Dolski, the main character, turns to The Alters, or alternate versions of himself that differ from him in ways that will help them all survive. The Alters each have different skills and character traits, so even though they all look like Jan, they&#x27;ll fill specific roles in the mission to get home. The trailer shows Jan and The Alters&#x27; ship, a giant wheel-like craft with a series of shipping container units held together at the center.
During the presentation, 11 Bit Studios&#x27; Lead Artist Tomasz Kisikewicz says the game has aspects of a psychological thriller, with a dash of horror, but also obviously deals with surrealism. He also says this lands in a &quot;classic sci-fi&quot; story by taking a relatable topic and applying these fictional science solutions like creating alternate selves, but the gameplay is contemporary with a focus on system design and non-linear gameplay. It&#x27;s designed for players to create their own stories.
 

It seems like it&#x27;s far too early for a release date, but we do know The Alters will be coming to PC whenever it does end up launching.</span>

                              <span>The PC Gaming Show debuted an extended look at gameplay for a Sci-fi thriller from Starward Industries, The Invincible. What was shown is compelling, and it may be an understatement to say, but this game looks stunning.


The demo begins from the perspective of Yasna, a hazmat-suited explorer as she ventures into a dusty and irradiated facility. Her cohort Novik supports her on comms as she delves deeper into the mysterious local. She soon comes across a deactivated Antimatter cannon and later a robot looping a task it&#x27;s been engaged in for who knows how long. The tech of The Invincible is retro-futuristic, which gives the rundown facility and gadgets Yasna uses a lot of character and charm. Yasna pulls out a handheld tracker with a field of tiny lights and uses it to discover a body buried in the sands beneath her feet, confirming this place isn&#x27;t at all safe. Then, the antimatter cannon surges to life, takes aim, and blows the robot worker away with a spectacular beam of particles before turning its sights dead on our protagonist.
I&#x27;m not usually one for slow-paced first-person narrative games, but this look at The Invincible had me on the edge of my seat, and I can&#x27;t wait to see more. The Invincible is coming sometime in 2023 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</span>

                              <span>Obsidian Entertainment, the studio behind 2019’s The Outer Worlds, has revealed Pentiment, a beautiful narrative journey through 16th Century Bavaria. It is coming to Xbox consoles and PC this November. 
Revealed during today’s Xbox &amp; Bethesda Games Showcase, Pentiment looks like quite the departure from what Obsidian has released over the past few years. Nonetheless, the project looks fascinating. The game features quite a unique visual style that looks reminiscent of an old medieval painting or book. This makes sense, too, because Pentiment is not an RPG like The Outer Worlds or a survival game like the studio’s Grounded, but rather, a narrative adventure game. 
Check out the trailer for yourself below: 


Here’s how Xbox describes Pentiment in the YouTube trailer description: 
“Set in 16th century Bavaria, Pentiment will take players on a narrative journey through the eyes of Journeyman Artist Andreas Maler during a time of great social unrest. Led by game director Josh Sawyer, this game is brought to life by a talented team inspired by illuminated manuscripts, woodcut prints, and history itself.” 
Pentiment hits Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC this November. 
While waiting for its release, read Game Informer’s review of The Outer Worlds and then read about Obsidian’s next RPG, Avowed.

                              <span>As Dusk Falls, an interactive drama where you make choices that impact the characters&#x27; lives, made an appearance at the Xbox Games Showcase. The trailer, which was captured in-game, not only looked intriguing but also revealed the game&#x27;s launch date. And it&#x27;s next month!
On July 19, you can gear up with friends or solo to experience a story of &quot;betrayal, sacrifice, and resilience.&quot; The trailer, which you can watch above, sheds light on some of the dilemmas and challenges you&#x27;ll have to navigate in a small town. It makes statements like, &quot;Sometimes doing the right thing is doing the wrong thing.&quot; The narrative-driven game will explore the entangled lives of two families across thirty years, and it looks like three characters, in particular, are at the forefront of the experience.
The multiplayer lets you have up to eight players, but it&#x27;s unclear how each person will actually be involved in the process. 
Guess we&#x27;ll know soon enough when As Dusk Falls launches on July 19 for Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC. The game is also a day-one title on Xbox Game Pass.</span>

                              <span>Game creator Hideo Kojima of Kojima Productions joined the Xbox Games Showcase presentation today for a quick but impactful announcement; he and his team are working on a new project in partnership with Xbox.
Unfortunately, he chose to share next to nothing about what the project will be, beyond sharing that it is a “game I have always wanted to make.”
Kojima also implied that it’s a new game, and thus likely not part of any existing franchise. He also spoke briefly about Microsoft’s cloud technology, suggesting that the project might leverage that capability as well.
It’s not much to go on, but it’s an interesting new direction for the studio and auteur, as Kojima has more recently been connected to Sony and its PlayStation brand.
It will be especially interesting to see what shape this new project will take as we learn more, but that may be quite a long way off from now.</span>

When Grounded releases in a few months, it&#x27;ll have every update that&#x27;s been included in its early access period thus far and something that hasn&#x27;t been available yet. The entire story campaign will be playable alone or with friends for the first time, completing the Grounded experience. Along with the whole story mode, new armor and weapon recipes and a fight against a giant Mantis await players when the update hits.
Grounded is available on Game Preview right now on Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC.</span>

In a variety of gameplay clips, creator Todd Howard walked us through various gameplay aspects, revealing that this science-fiction RPG features over 1,000 planets to explore. From barren moons to heavily populated worlds, you can go where you want to see what you discover.
The first locale we see is a moon called Kreet, which is stark in detail with rocky grain terrains and brief flares of color with red plants. In this regard, the color scheme is similar to Star Wars&#x27; Crait from The Last Jedi. Here, we are given our first taste of gameplay, which we see from bo…</span>

                              <span>Today&#x27;s Xbox Games Showcase featured many games – big and small – by a glut of different development teams. Baby Robot Games is a Barcelona-based studio that focuses on supernatural stealth and adventure games. Today, it revealed Ereban: Shadow Legacy, a game where you must harness mystical shadow powers and use high-tech gadgets to uncover the truth about your past to save the universe.
In the trailer, the main character, Ayana, who channels some serious Tron energy with her attire, confronts big mechs. Apparently, Ayana is the last descent of a forgotten race and is key to saving this dying, morally grey universe. The gameplay footage showed her stealthily outsmarting big machines and using an array of powers. She can also stab them through the head, so that&#x27;s pretty cool. She even takes some big falls from huge heights, reminiscent of Assassin&#x27;s Creed. Watch the trailer above to get the full scoop.
Ereban: Shadow Legacy will launch day one on Xbox Game Pass. No release date was revealed.</span>

                              <span>Xbox has a history of showing off some of our favorite indies during its big showcases, and it looks like it&#x27;s keeping that tradition alive and well. During the platform&#x27;s Summer Game Fest event today, we got our first glimpse at a new project from Limbo and Inside lead designer Jeppe Carlsen.
Cocoon, published by Annapurna Interactive, which has a showcase of its own next month, promises to be a mind-bending experience with an undeniably compelling art style. The creators promise to take players &quot;on an adventure across worlds within worlds,&quot; which are represented by a series of unusual glowing orbs in the trailer. The clip begins with a sweeping and stylized view of a desert landscape which is soon disturbed by a blinding beam of white light. Our hero pops out of a mechanical-looking cocoon energized by the laser and appears to be a kind of beetle. We mostly see it grabbing and distributing globes of various colors, which may allow it to jump to different locations.


 There&#x27;s not a lot to glean from this reveal trailer, but the game&#x27;s Steam page goes into a little more detail. 
Cocoon is set to release on Xbox consoles (via Game Pass), Switch, and PC sometime in 2023. The trailer&#x27;s description indicates fans should get ready to &quot;master world-leaping mechanics to unravel a cosmic mystery.&quot;</span>

                              <span>We still don&#x27;t have a firm Diablo IV release date yet (other than 2023), but we now know every class we can play when it eventually releases. The necromancer joins the previously announced barbarian, sorceress, rogue, and druid, all allowing for high levels of customization.
As you dive into dangerous open areas, you&#x27;ll be hunting the disciples of Lilith, the daughter of hatred. In new gameplay footage, developer Blizzard Entertainment says Diablo IV offers over 150 dungeons, along with territories to reclaim, and story sequences that occur as you explore. Some of these story moments could lead to massive boss battles that require numerous players.


Diablo IV offers cross-play between console and PC, and also two-player couch play for people in the same household. If you play a bunch and become incredibly powerful, the game will highlight you as a champion, which other players can see. Along with the high number of dungeons, Blizzard claims the endgame is deep and will continue to expand years after release.
Blizzard says they are close to completing development, but has only given an open 2023 timeframe for release.</span>

                              <span>Koei Tecmo Games and Team Ninja have revealed Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty and it’s coming to Xbox consoles and PC next year. 
Revealed during today’s Xbox &amp; Bethesda Games Showcase, Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty looks quite similar to Team Ninja’s Nioh series in that it features a ninja-like character fighting against not just humans, but monstrous and demonic monsters, too. The reveal trailer, which you can watch below, doesn’t feature any gameplay but it gave us quite the taste of Fallen Dynasty’s world.


As you can see in the trailer above, the character that appears to be the protagonist of Fallen Dynasty is fighting off barbarian enemies before consuming something that turns them into a massive demon dragon monster that looks terrifying. Here’s what the trailer description for Fallen Dynasty says about the game: 
It looks great, albeit a little scary, and fortunately, we don’t have to wait too long to check it out because Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty hits Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC in early 2023.

                              <span>Ebb Software showed a new trailer for Scorn at today’s Xbox Games Showcase, and the first-person horror adventure continues to look just as disturbing as ever.
Drawing clear lines of inspiration from the famous artist, H.R. Giger, Scorn features some of the same disconcerting imagery that is a part of the art from movies like Alien, in which biological and mechanical elements seem to merge.
The new trailer continues to embrace those elements, with more than a little bit of body horror mixed in for good measure. The video shows numerous instances of disconnected human appendages attached to strange, non-human machines and creatures. And the protagonist appears to be horribly mutilated in the brief glimpses we get of their arms and other body parts.
Ebb has stated in the past that Scorn is aiming for a cohesive “lived-in” world, in which players are thrown in the deep-end by arriving and having to try and grasp what is even happening in the spaces they explore. Environments are said to be maze-like and individual regions are open and exploreable, but interconnected with other distinct spaces.
The developers are also touting the game’s focus on full-body awareness. Rather than have items simply floating in the world and having them picked up by magic, every object is a real thing that your character must lift or move with their own hands, hopefully leading to a greater sense of immersion. And, given the subject matter, a likely greater sense of disquiet.
While the environment and creature design is certainly impressive, I continue to have a number of questions about the nature of gameplay in the project. I’m eager to understand more about the nature of the puzzles and characters that are part of the surreal game world, but this latest trailer does little to illuminate either.
Scorn is headed to Xbox Game Pass, but more generally will be available on Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC, and on the Cloud when it releases on October 21, 2022.</span>

                              <span>Lightyear Frontier, a farming and exploration game coming from indie studio Frame Break, is set to be released on Xbox consoles in Spring 2023, it was announced Sunday during the Xbox &amp; Bethesda Games showcase.
In the trailer, we see the pilotable mech farming around its new, strange world – growing crops, building structures, and generally exploring the surroundings. The trailer ends on a mysterious discovery, though as you might expect, does little to show what that may be. 
Check it out in the trailer below:


According to Lightyear Frontier&#x27;s Steam page:
&quot;Lightyear Frontier is a peaceful open-world farming adventure on a planet at the far edge of the galaxy. Start your new home on a distant planet with up to three friends as you farm alien crops, build your own homestead, and explore the untamed wilderness of the world.&quot;

Lightyear Frontier will be released into Early Access next spring on Xbox consoles and PC. According to the trailer, it&#x27;s a console launch exclusive.</span>

                              <span>6/12 UPDATE: 
As we previously reported below, a leak heavily hinted that Forza Horizon 5&#x27;s first expansion would be a Hot Wheels crossover. Today, at the Xbox Games Showcase, it was not only confirmed, but a high-speed trailer featuring the toy cars from our childhoods whizzed across the screen on the tracks and red loops we&#x27;ve come to know. You can watch the trailer above. The expansion hits on July 19. 
PREVIOUS STORY
According to Eurogamer, Forza Horizon 5’s first expansion – a Hot Wheels crossover – leaked on the Steam store listing and was immediately taken down. The listing was posted to Reddit, where it gained traction. You can see the image of the crossover below. 
This wouldn’t be the first time the two car-racing giants joined forces. Hot Wheels DLC packages sped onto the scenic tracks of Forza Motorsport 5 and Forza Horizon 3 and 4. What Playground Games has in store with its latest arcade racing simulator is anyone’s guess. 
Forza Horizon 5 cracked Game Informer’s Top 10 Games of 2021 list: 
“To merely say Forza Horizon 5 is among the most mechanically sound racing games ever created would be a disservice and overlook what makes the game worthy of praise. Yes, the foundational act of driving feels fantastic, but it’s the rest of the package that truly elevates this fifth entry in the series to the rarified air that demands a place on our list of the top 10 games of the year.”
Are you excited about the alleged crossover?

                              <span>Blizzard Entertainment showed up strong to the Xbox and Bethesda showcase with a new look at Overwatch 2. The publisher had plenty to show from the hero shooter, including a new character and the announcement of the day it&#x27;ll enter Early Access, October 4.


When it hits Early Access, Overwatch 2&#x27;s PvP content will be free-to-play, giving players who want to play matches with or against friends the chance to do so at no cost. It&#x27;ll also have a new character called The Junker Queen who got her own cinematic trailer, introducing her Mad-Max-meets-punk-rock persona in a handicap match against some nasty-looking fellas. The Junker Queen uses an ax and shotgun to tear through other heroes on the OW battlefield. We&#x27;ll learn more about her on June 16, when Blizzard holds an Overwatch 2 reveal event.
Blizzard promises regular content updates for Overwatch 2, including new maps, modes, heroes, and even more. Also, because this showed up on the Xbox showcase doesn&#x27;t mean the information above isn&#x27;t any less true for the other platforms OW2 is planned to launch on. Overwatch 2 will hit Early Access on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC at the same time.</span>

                              <span>In Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn, you take control of Nor Vanek and wage war against the gods. She isn&#x27;t alone in her pursuit and is joined by a blue, mystical fox named Enki. Today&#x27;s Xbox Games Showcase gave us an advanced look at this 2023 action/RPG, showing off traversal, combat, boss fights, and more. 
In many sequences, we see Nor and Enki in the middle of vast battlefields, using a variety of weapons and magics to dispose of any soldier or beast that stands in their way. The footage is impressive, both in scale and the level of detail in the worlds. Nor and Enki appear to have swift aerial traversal means to get across terrain quickly. Like most games in Xbox&#x27;s showcase, developer A44 Games and publisher Kepler Interactive are releasing Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn on Game Pass on day one.</span>

                              <span>Pete Hines took the stage at today&#x27;s Xbox Showcase to introduce a bevy of Bethesda projects. Among looks at Elder Scrolls Online and a recap on Redfall, which kicked the event off in style, the Bethesda exec revealed a new expansion for Fallout 76. The company&#x27;s online multiplayer game had a rough start, but Bethesda has continued to work on its title, with several story expansions and updates to the game&#x27;s world. However, this is the first update we&#x27;ve had for the title in a while, as the last major expansion came last year.
The Pitt&#x27;s story will take place in post-war Pittsburgh, a location we haven&#x27;t seen since Fallout 3. Described as &quot;a grim industrial wasteland crippled by conflict,&quot; players will be teaming up with the Union, a band of mechanically skilled fighters seeking to rid their home of raiders that have taken over called the Fanatics. This task will be made even harder by the fact that The Pitt&#x27;s toxic wasteland is warping the mind of its inhabitants. 


Fallout 76&#x27;s Expeditions: The Pitt is coming this September.</span>

                              <span>Microsoft and Mojang have revealed Minecraft Legends, an action strategy game coming to Xbox consoles and PC. 
This news comes from today’s Xbox &amp; Bethesda Games Showcase, where Mojang revealed the Legends trailer. The story shows the destruction of a village and the rebirth of a new land thanks to some heroic deeds of friendship, bravery, and more. According to the trailer, the game tells the story of a united overworld, and that overworld is to be united by none other than you, the player. 
Check out the reveal trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Legends is quite the departure from the typical Minecraft formula. Breaking away from the survival crafting mold the series has held for over a decade, similar to what Minecraft Dungeons did in 2020, Legends will be the first action strategy game in Mojang’s blocky world. It also features a unique spin on the traditional Minecraft visuals.
It retains the blockiness fans of Minecraft have come to know and love, but with a more distinct, almost comic book-ey style. It looks great, and fortunately, we don’t have to wait too long to play it because it hits Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC sometime next year. 
While waiting for Minecraft Legends, read Game Informer’s Minecraft Dungeons review.

                              <span>Amicia and Hugo want to start a new life, but they need to find somewhere safe where this dream can be realized. In a new trailer for Asobo Studio&#x27;s A Plague Tale: Requiem, we see them traveling south, across treacherous terrain and into thriving villages. These places look like they could be safe havens, but we quickly see guards expanding their search and are everywhere.
The new footage shows stealth maneuvers captured in striking detail. We see Amicia hiding under a table to evade a patrol and being surprisingly aggressive, using weapons to silently take out guards. We also see her use fire to create a blaze that will surely draw out every guard in the area.
Of course, Hugo&#x27;s curse doesn&#x27;t remain dormant for long and a flood of rats appears to keep him safe. A Plague Tale: Requiem still doesn&#x27;t have an official release date, but is still slated to release in 2022 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC. You&#x27;ll be able to play it on Xbox Game Pass on day one.</span>

                              <span>Early in today’s Xbox Game Showcase, Riot Games’ president, Marc Merrill, took a few minutes to announce a big new partnership with Xbox and its Game Pass program. A number of Riot’s biggest experiences are coming to Xbox Game Pass on mobile and PC, with relatively robust options unlocked for players to enjoy.
First, Riot’s flagship property, League of Legends, will see all champions unlocked on PC.
In League of Legends: Wild Rift, it’s a similar picture, with all champions unlocked on mobile gaming platforms.
In Legends of Runeterra, Game Pass players can expect to have the full Foundations set of cards unlocked. For those not in the know, as the name implies, that’s the foundational cards for the game, establishing the base mechanics. The card set will be available on both PC and mobile.
In Teamfight Tactics, players can expect select Little Legends to be unlocked, whether you play on PC or mobile.
And in Valorant, all agents will be unlocked on PC.
It’s a notable team-up that should give a boost to both Xbox and Riot. On the Riot side, the availability of so many characters and sets across the spectrum of their games means that a potentially huge audience of Xbox players could have a chance to experience a broad spectrum of what each of those games have to offer. To Xbox’s benefit, it offers a meaningful boost to the already potent draw of Xbox Games Pass as a service and experience, since players can gain access to a number of aspects of each of those Riot games without needing to pay additional costs.
While Riot’s expansion into Game Pass is big news, it’s worth noting that it won’t have much effect for players on Xbox consoles, as all the available options are coming to specific combinations of PC and mobile, depending on titles.
The availability of all of these options is said to be coming this winter for Game Pass subscribers.</span>

Announced back in 2019, Hollow Knight: Silksong takes place in a haunted kingdom swarming with bugs. As insectoid creature Hornet, your weapon of choice is a needle. The gameplay is said to be largely similar to its predecessor, but with an increased focus on speed. The latest trailer showed off more of what to expect, with an impressive showing of the striking art style, swift platforming, and unique baddies. You can watch the trailer above to see what I mean. 
No release date was revealed for the Xbox and PC versions.</span>

                              <span>Microsoft and Turn 10 Studios have revealed Forza Motorsport (that’s right – there’s no number attached to this entry in the franchise) with a beautiful trailer. 
Revealed during today’s Xbox &amp; Bethesda Games Showcase, Turn 10’s latest motorsport game will hit Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC in spring of next year. The studio calls it the “most technologically advanced racing game ever made.” To highlight these technological advances, the team showcased Maple Valley, a fan-favorite track alongside news that the game will have a dynamic day-and-night cycle, a first for the Motorsport series.
Check out the reveal trailer for yourself below: 


Not to be confused with Playground Games’ Forza Horizon series, Motorsport is closer to a racing sim than it is an arcade racer, making it an especially great time for people who really like to get under the hood of the vehicles they race. To go with that, there’s plenty of environment tech happening in Forza Motorsport to simulate not just how the cars would drive, but how the time of day, the temperature associated with it, and more can affect the race. 
Check out this demo trailer for more information about that: 


All of it looks great thanks to ray-tracing, photorealism techniques, and more. That includes the car damage your vehicle will endure when you hit other drivers or barriers on the track, too. 
 
While waiting for it to hit Xbox consoles and PC next year, read Game Informer’s Forza Horizon 5 review.

                              <span>Squanch Games has announced High On Life, a new first-person shooter from the mind of Rick and Morty creator Justin Roiland. 
Squanch Games revealed High On Life during today’s Xbox gaming showcase, and the first trailer for it highlights talking guns, alien cartels, and plenty of Roiland-style humor. It’s appropriately poppy and colorful, too, and it looks like a great time. Plus, we don’t have to wait too long to play it because it hits Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC (via Steam and the Epic Games Store) later this year. 
“After a cartel of aliens invades Earth, a freshly minted high-school graduate grabs the nearest talking gun and becomes the deadliest intergalactic bounty hunter across the cosmos,” a press release reads. “The alien invaders in High On Life are on a mission to dominate Earth, but with a particularly sinister twist: Garmantuous and his cartel goons are intent on enslaving humanity and using them as a new drug.
“[Defeating] powerful aliens isn’t going to be easy; bounty hunters will work with (or against) NPCs, collect upgrades, and acquire an arsenal of talking guns on their journey. Each of these guns has its own unique personality and special gameplay, and they provide their own narrative take on what’s going on.” 

Squanch Games’ studio director Mike Fridley says to expect Roiland’s comedic voice to tie this game together with all of the studio’s other outputs. He says the studio wants players to look at any of its games and immediately know it’s a Squanch game. 
“I wanted to make games that I wanted to play, and that was the spark that sort of lit the fire of Squanch Games,” Roiland writes in a press release. “Then we shipped Trover, we shipped Accounting+, and now we’re on this absolute dream game that we were kind of building towards this whole time.”

                              <span>The Pelican aircraft from the Halo series is coming as a free add-on to Microsoft Flight Simulator, Xbox announced today during this year&#x27;s Xbox &amp; Bethesda Games Showcase. Better yet, it&#x27;s available now. 
The reveal came at the tail-end of a trailer for the Microsoft Flight Simulator 40th Anniversary edition, which among other aircraft, adds the Wright Brothers&#x27; Wright Flyer airplane.
Our look at the Pelican was brief, though it did end with the aircraft hovering high above the Earth&#x27;s stratosphere.

                              <span>Arkane Studio’s Redfall kicked off the Xbox &amp; Bethesda Games Showcase with the first extended gameplay trailer.
The trailer sets the table for the adventure, which unfolds on the island of Redfall, Massachusetts. The idyllic town falls apart when residents disappear and, worse, become vampires. If that’s not enough, some survivors have taken to worshipping these night creatures as deranged cultists. Up to four players team up as a band of survivors who must fight back and escape Redfall with their lives intact. 


The crew consists of protagonist Layla, who wields telekinesis, the sniper Jacob, the engineer Remy (with a cute robot companion in tow), and cryptid hunter Devinder. The gameplay trailer shows how these four combine their abilities to combat hordes of undead, such as Layla creating a telekinetic elevator to launch an ally skyborne. 
Redfall releases in early 2023 for Xbox Series X/S and PC and will launch day one on Game Pass.</span>

I had a chance to sit in on a demo to learn the ins and outs of the new hub and play Halo Infinite and Flight Simulator to get a sense of how the new gaming hub works. 
Beginning with this update, 2022 Samsung TV owners can access distinct media and gaming hubs. The Media Hub has been re-optimized from its previous iterations to focus on video apps such as Hulu, Netflix, and Amazon. However, the big addition to the upcoming TV update is the Gaming Hub.

We now know a heck of a lot more about the upcoming 9th generation of Pokémon games. Pokémon Scarlet and Violet look to shake up the series&#x27; formula in a few different ways such as four-player co-op and a fully open world, but there&#x27;s one key thing that hasn&#x27;t changed with the upcoming mainline games.
Scarlet and Violet continue the tradition of releasing two different versions of the same game. Some people might think red is just a cool, bold colour, but there&#x27;s a certain mystical charm about that shade of purple.

First announced back in 2018 before dropping onto Steam Early Access in 2020 and later PS5, Temtem garnered a lot of well-deserved attention as a worthy challenger to Pokémon’s tried-and-true formula, with a focus on developing the online social and competitive elements of Game Freak&#x27;s series. Lucky for us Nintendo fans, Madrid-based developer Crema confirmed that the monster-battling MMO will also land on the Switch on 6th September with its 1.0 launch across all platforms.
“There were a lot of sacrifices and there were a lot of difficulties in bringing Temtem to Switch,” said Game Director Guillermo Andrades via email. The humble, ageing little Switch celebrated its fifth birthday back in March and hardcore Nintendo fans await some word — any word -- of a more powerful successor, we thought it prudent to ask how the game is stacking up on Switch compared to the more powerful hardware it was developed for.

Pokémon has always had two different versions, but before the original games were released on Game Boy in 1996, Game Freak had plans for something else.
In new translations of old Japanese interviews (via the YouTube channel Did You Know Gaming), it&#x27;s revealed how Game Freak wanted 65,535 different versions of the first generation Pokémon games.

After the VME subsystem was promoted out of staging a decade ago, the VME hardware drivers failed to ever leave staging and the code has fallen into disrepair and no maintenance now for the past half-decade. So the VME subsystem support is preparing to depart back to the land of the kernel&#x27;s staging area...</span>

                              <span>Sci-fi platformer Planet Of Lana seems like a sweet, scenic adventure with an alien monkey butler, and today’s Future Games Show had a little more gameplay to share. I mentioned Planet Of Lana earlier this week in my Day Of The Devs 2022 round-up, because it featured in that indie showcase too. Check out the trailer if you missed it on Thursday, it’s quite charming.

                              <span>Last year a couple of brothers posted a concept trailer for an FPS horror game that didn&#x27;t exist (named Project Ill). Well, those brothers are now Team Clout and that game now exists, albeit called simply Ill. I&#x27;ve not got much to point you towards - there&#x27;s no Steam Store page, no high-res press screens, no release window. Even calling the video from the Future Games Show a gameplay trailer is taking the biscuit, if not most of the factory floor at McVities. But the vibes, as they say, are immaculate: bare feet on a grubby floor, shambling horrors with many half-glimpsed appendages, and a gun that is surely too small to protect you from any of it. Resident Evil but injected with your most virulent 2022 strain.

                              <span>Palworld has a new trailer. If you&#x27;ve seen Palworld&#x27;s previous two trailers, those words alone should send you rushing below to see what new absurdity is on show. For the uninitiated: Palworld is a game in which you can catch off-brand Pokémon, put them to work in a sweatshop producing guns, and then do battle with these Nopémon by your side and and an assault rifle in your hands.

Watch the trailer, you&#x27;ll see.

                              <span>Back in January of this year RPS regular contributor Edwin Evans-Thirlwell interviewed Ami Y. Cai, developer of The Cartomancy Anthology, as part of his efforts to dig into the mystery of why tarot is such a popular inspiration for indie games at the moment. Happily, after today&#x27;s Future Of Play Direct, we can provide you with a little update on that story: Cai&#x27;s expansive collaborative project is due to release on Steam very soon: on August 9th, 2022.

The Entropy Centre’s due out this year. Although it could probably be out whenever it likes if it fires at a calendar of games releases. Have your ideas about physics turned upside down when you watch the trailer below. Or is it above?

                              <span>Tinykin is about an astronaut named Milo returning to earth after a long space voyage. Milo might reasonably fall to his knees and scream &quot;You blew it up, damn you!&quot; when he gets there, because the earth he lands upon has been blown up several times larger than normal - either that or he&#x27;s been made much smaller and is now the size of a penny. Milo must then have to navigate the abandoned world with a Pikmin-like army of aliens by his side, ready to solve puzzles. 

It looks great, and after being announced last year, Tinykin now has a release date of August 25th.

                              <span>If there&#x27;s anything I&#x27;ve learned from today&#x27;s Future Of Play event, it&#x27;s that stylish futuristic dystopian mysteries are where it&#x27;s at right now in the indie scene, and I for one am all in favour. One of the coolest announcements at the event was Hill Agency: PURITYdecay, described as an &quot;Indigenous cybernoir detective game&quot; and in the works at Achimostawinan Games. Although maybe &quot;in the works&quot; isn&#x27;t quite an accurate description, because the game is in fact out very soon: on August 31st this year, to be exact.
The trailer is a pitch-perfect hearkening back to the golden age hardboiled detective stories of the 1940s — complete with a black-and-white palette with just the occasional hint of colour to highlight the high-tech parts. High-tech because, despite its 20th century influences, this game is set quite far in the future, in 2262. It&#x27;s not exactly a nice vision of the world in 240 years&#x27; time, though, as the narrator is quick to point out that it&#x27;s riddled with &quot;crime, conflict, and propaganda&quot;. Truly holding up a mirror to our times, then.

Some more footage of the thwack ‘em up platformer was shown off at today’s Future Games Show. You can stroke your beard and make approving sounds at it, if you watch the trailer below.

                              <span>Sunday Gold, revealed at the Future Games Show tonight, has a lot going on under the hood, so bear with me. In Sunday Gold you play a team of three crims and... well, I can&#x27;t explain it better than the steam blurb, which says &quot;experience a unique hybrid of escape room style puzzles, turn-based combat, and RPG mechanics tied together with a dark and cinematic storyline.&quot; So, er, Blending a few things, here. Key takeaway is that everyone in this has a faced like a slapped Bulldog&#x27;s bum. Nobody is having a fun time.

It&#x27;s also seemingly a game where you&#x27;re a wee smout and can ride on the back of a friendly hedgehog. There&#x27;s a new trailer which covers both of these elements below.

                              <span>I adore Deadly Premonition, a game which shines despite substantial elements being janky or bad. The 2010 horror game about an oddball FBI agent investigating ritual murders in small-town America is not &quot;so bad it&#x27;s good&quot;, it&#x27;s so good it doesn&#x27;t matter that it&#x27;s bad (and maybe the badness even amplifies the good). Well, I&#x27;ve been playing Deadly Premonition 2 ahead of its PC release today, and I&#x27;m sorry to say the sequel does not shake out the same way. Despite some bright spots, enough of Deadly Premonition 2 is bad that I&#x27;ve given up.

                              <span>One of the most intriguing new announcements at today&#x27;s Future Of Play event had to be Psychroma, a cyberpunk horror adventure game in the works by indie developer/publisher Rocket Adrift Games. The devs describe their game as a narrative-driven side-scroller where you play as a digital medium. Imagine something halfway between Observer and Detention, then, and you&#x27;ll be on the right lines.
The trailer harks back to the point-and-click mysteries beloved of my misspent youth, which really fits in with Psychroma&#x27;s whole retro futuristic vibe. It&#x27;s got that clever pixel art style that looks exactly how you remember golden age adventure games looking in the &#x27;90s, which of course means that it&#x27;s much, much more polished and modern than those games ever were.

                              <span>Revealed at the Future Games Show tonight, Tray Racers is a game clearly derived from a dev accidentally doing a spoonerism in a meeting one time. This SEO nightmare is being developed by Bit Loom, the team behind colourful yet somehow unsettling puzzle game Phogs, and it&#x27;s about racing down sand dunes on trays. As the trailer says, &quot;the world ended... But the fun didn’t!&quot;, and I guess winning a dune race would take your mind off the unending horror for a bit.

                              <span>It&#x27;s hard not to view Kitfox Games as the stars of tonight&#x27;s Future Of Play event. Hot on the heels of the news that Boyfriend Dungeon will be receiving a substantial free update, they unveiled Mossfield Origins, the next game coming courtesy of their publishing arm.
Developed by Studio Any Percent, Mossfield Origins promises an extremely relaxing take on the sci-fi city builder genre. The announcement trailer, which you can check out below, opens with a serene disembodied voice setting the tone for what&#x27;s to come. &quot;We were sent here with a purpose,&quot; the voice murmurs soothingly, then adds: &quot;But we&#x27;re not doing that any more.&quot;

Consequently I&#x27;m a fan of horror anthologies in the vein of No Code&#x27;s Stories Untold. Upcoming freak &#x27;em up The Fridge Is Red (developed by 5Word Team) looks like r/nosleep having a story jam about the fridge you have to stare at off of Control, so I&#x27;m into it. Look out for it in 2022, but the trailer says there&#x27;s a free demo on Steam now.

So far, I&#x27;m most excited by Skate Story, which isn&#x27;t a huge endorsement for the marketing extravaganza considering we&#x27;ve known about that sk8 into Hell for years now. But, enough about the future and the past. What are you playing this weekend? Here&#x27;s what we&#x27;re clicking on!

                              <span>2017&#x27;s Serial Cleaner was all about stealthfully infiltrating a murder scene and cleaning up the mess before the cops got their hands on any evidence. Developer Draw Distance is taking that concept and expanding on it further with Serial Cleaners, offering more ways to play and even more gruesome crimes to cover up.


Unlike its 70s-inspired predecessor, Serial Cleaners pulls from pop culture of the 1990s, including Quinten Tarantino&#x27;s body of work and other classic action and crime thrillers of the era. Once again, stealth is core to the experience; you can&#x27;t let the authorities know what happened at each crime scene. Serial Cleaners brings four characters to mop up blood, bodies, and clues, each handling business in their own way. Players will utilize these new cleaners&#x27; street smarts, tech, brute force, or classic know-how to get the job done.
If you&#x27;re ready to aid and abet in some gnarly virtual killings, Serial Cleaners is set to release on September 22 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.</span>

                              <span>We got a new look today at Arctic Awakening, the upcoming first-person narrative game from GoldFire Studios. Players control Kai, a cargo pilot who was on a relatively routine supply delivery to a small Alaskan town with his partner, when their plane goes down in the middle of nowhere. Donovan, the co-pilot, is lost out in the cold and snowy wastes, and Kai sets out to find him.
As Kai, you must explore the freezing cold wilds, and the environment is a constant threat. The game is set in April of 2062, so there are a few things that are a bit different than one might expect to find in a modern-day setting, including a court-mandated therapy bot that is along with you on your journey. The AI drone has no shortage of pithy commentary to share with you as you navigate the wilderness, but has little in the way of helpful tools or weapons that might aid in your survival efforts.
Beyond the exploration elements, Arctic Awakening focuses on narrative choice, and the way those choices shift the relationships and situations of the characters around you. The decisions you make also affect the way the game ends.
Beyond narrative elements, GoldFire Studios is promising dynamic weather that shifts over time, meaning even areas you’ve visited already may be different when you return to them a second time.
As Kai explores, it becomes increasingly apparent that something more sinister is going on out there in the wilderness. High-tech facilities and mysterious technology is everywhere, providing a sense of mystery tinged with terror.
Arctic Awakening is targeting launch on consoles, PC, and Mac something in 2023. It will be released as a collection of five 60-90 minute chapters for players to take on at their own pace.</span>

                              <span>A dose of adorable is coming your way in just a few months! In this Pikmin-like game appropriately called Tinykin, you must catch tons of adorable little aliens and use their special powers to help get the main character Milo back to his home on Earth.
The newest trailer debuted at GamesRadar&#x27;s Future Game Show, giving us a better look at these little creatures and how they&#x27;ll help Milo in his journey. Milo can stack tinykin to reach higher places, toss them at enemies, and enlist them to carry objects. A blue tinykin allows Milo to produce a powerful electric current. A red tinykin can be thrown like a bomb to blow up enemies. 
Tinykin launches on August 30 for PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC.

                              <span>Today’s Future Games Show gave us a new look at Bramble: The Mountain King, a visually arresting upcoming game from Dimfrost Studio. Players control a young protagonist named Olle as he as he explores a world of misty Nordic fairy tales in a forbidding wilderness, and the strange and deadly creatures that crop up along the way. His journey is motivated by a hope to rescues his lost sister.
The studio is aiming to offer a compelling juxtaposition of beautiful natural environments and sudden, horrifying moments of danger – all reflected in high-quality visuals. That goal is clearly presented in the game’s footage, which has an attractive and lush art style that immediately captures the mood.
The studio describes a focus on “David vs. Goliath” bosses as you explore nature. As an illustration of the concept, the new trailer discusses the strange creature called the Näcken, perhaps inspired by the myth of the Nykr. In the game, the Näcken plays its magical violin from its watery home, and lures people to their deaths by drowning in the lake. He was once a normal man who was terribly bullied by those around him, who eventually snapped and killed everyone close to him – including the girl that he loved.
Based on the description explored in the trailer, it’s clear that Dimfrost is interested in exploring the backstories and foundational elements of each monster’s narratives as part of the unfolding game. The Näcken is just one of many strange creatures that players encounter in the game.
The footage reveals the young explorer navigating creepy 3D environments, often as imposing giant creatures lurk in the background. Gameplay is said to focus on puzzle-solving and platforming.
Dimfrost Studio is previously known for its work creating the 2017 release, A Writer And His Daughter, a VR exploration game.
Bramble: The Mountain King is on the way to PC and consoles later in 2022.</span>

                              <span>Kumi Souls Games has been rather quiet on social media about its upcoming gothic-horror action game The Last Faith, but as part of the Future Games Show presentation, we were able to see how it&#x27;s shaping up. The fresh footage shows Belmont-esque protagonist Eric as he brutalizes everything in his path, destroying plenty of beautifully drawn monsters, and faces off against a towering and salivating hydra beast.
The Last Faith borrows heavily from Castlevania and games like Dark souls, offering what looks to be a tough, violent affair. Eric has plenty of weapons and attacks in his arsenal including a fiery haymaker punch, a shocking electrified blade, and a shotgun to keep the enemies in check at mid-range. He also utilizes gruesome execution moves to take foes down for good; it&#x27;s strangely impressive how gross some details of these attacks come off in the pixel low-rez art.
Following a successful Kickstarter campaign in 2020, Kumi Souls Games have been hard at work on the 2D action game. Since then, publisher Playstack has picked up The Last Faith for distribution, and the final game is starting to come together.
We don&#x27;t have an exact release date for The Last Faith quite yet, but the trailer does solidify a 2022 launch target on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.</span>

                              <span>The summer showcases are going strong, and we&#x27;ve seen plenty of games that catch our eye. After the Future Games Show today, we&#x27;ll be adding one more to the list: Sunday Gold. 
Sunday Gold is a &quot;classic adventure&quot; game from developer BKOM Studios and publisher Team17. The point-and-click, turn-based title has serious Disco Elysium vibes, though its dystopian future London looks to be a little more over-the-top. The game&#x27;s leading characters, a group of scrappy criminals, are on a mission to reveal the truth behind the unethical business practices of corrupt billionaire, Keny Hogan. And today&#x27;s trailer showed the bombastic length&#x27;s they&#x27;re ready to go to achieve that goal. Check out the world premiere trailer below.


Fully voiced and filled with puzzles alongside the combat, Sunday Gold is set to launch on PC later this year.</span>

                              <span>Lost in Play, a cartoon narrative adventure in the vein of shows like Over The Garden Wall, got a new launch date today. It will now be released on August 10, as announced during GamesRadar&#x27;s Future Games Show livestream. 
The new trailer shows our protagonists – a brother and sister – on their whimsical journey through childhood animation. You can see it below:


Interestingly, per Lost in Play&#x27;s Steam page, the game has no dialogue; storytelling is told visually. That story will take the brother and sister to a &quot;goblin castle&quot; and &quot;ancient ruins,&quot; as well as letting them &quot;soar atop a giant stork.&quot;
Lost in Play will be released on Switch and PC.</span>

                              <span>Turbo Golf Racing turned heads when it was revealed in March thanks to its blend of golf with Rocket League-style racing. During today’s Future Game Show, we found out that the wacky sports game is coming this August. Can’t wait? Don’t despair; you can play the game in its second beta right now. 
For the unfamiliar, the game pits up to eight players against each other as they race giant golf balls down obstacle-filled courses to knock them into the finish cup. Vehicles can jump and glide, and collecting power-ups lets players hit the ball further, and perform ground stomps, among other abilities. 


Developer Secret Mode announced that Turbo Golf Racing launches on Xbox consoles and PC on August 4. Beginning today, Beta 2 kicks off on Steam Early Access and Xbox Game Preview. This larger test features 12 courses, eight-player online multiplayer (with crossplay), single-player time trials, and improvements based on feedback from Beta 1. Leveling up during Beta 2 unlocks exclusive cosmetic wheels, an avatar, and a spoiler for the final game. Beta 2 concludes on June 20. 
Turbo Golf Racing arrives to Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC on August 4 and will be available on Game Pass.</span>

                              <span>The Entropy Centre, a sci-fi first-person puzzle adventure game, was just showcased during today’s Future Games Show conference, and it’s coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC later this year. 
The gameplay trailer did not reveal a release date, but with only half a year left, you at least know you’ll be waiting no more than roughly six months for it. That’s great because The Entropy Centre looks like an intriguing and fun puzzle game. A new British indie studio called Stubby Games is developing it, and Playstack is publishing the title. It is built around a puzzle mechanic that “allows players to think in reverse and overcome seemingly impossible obstacles,” such as the game’s main obstacle: reversing time far enough back to stop Earth from imploding.

                              <span>Announced last year with a short trailer, Luto made an appearance as part of the Future Games Show presentation. This first-person horror experience is bound to scare the pants off of somebody, especially with its impressive cloth rendering, making a particular terror in the new footage a sight to behold.


Developer Broken Bird Games is looking to create an immersive and emotional experience with Luto. Players take control of a character attempting to escape from their house, but trying to do just that will take you to some wild and spooky places. The new footage is full of atmospheric locales, such as dilapidated rooms filled with mysterious chains, dark hallways populated by sheet-covered individuals, and a hollowed-out cave system. Much of the lighting and materials presented in the footage look great, especially the sheet physics and rendering of an entity that breaks into a hallway and rises to its feet in an unsettling way.
Luto is set to launch on PlayStation and PC in 2022.</span>

Boyfriend Dungeon: Secret Weapons 
This dungeon crawler and dating sim hybrid officially launched last year and came with the promise of a free update complete with a new dungeon and love interests. Well, we&#x27;re finally getting a look at it. The new trailer introduced us to Hammer Laleh, who has a special ability called &quot;the death spiral.&quot; Axe Johan, who we briefly met in the main game, is also returning to capture our hearts.

Lil Gator Game

As you might expect, gameplay consists of walking around a small open area, taking pictures of items in the environment, and then learning the Japanese word for said item. You can study learned words by looking at your in-game photo album. Shashingo also has reading and listening lessons and a &quot;Find Mode,&quot; which tests your knowledge of the words you&#x27;ve learned. 
Check it out in the trailer below: 


While we weren&#x27;t given a release date, Shashingo&#x27;s trailer said it&#x27;s &quot;coming soon.&quot; It will be available on Switch and PC.</span>

Star Trek: Resurgence lets players boldly guide an original crew where no man has gone before. By that, they get to determine the fate of a new team of space explorers and the stakes of an interspecies conflict in a choice-driven adventure. During Summer Game Fest Play Days, I got to navigate a particularly tense situation to get a taste of the sorts of decisions players will face and their potential consequences. 
Resurgence’s original story unfolds in the year 2380, shortly after the events of Star Trek: The Next Generation, specifically its feature films. Players control two central members of the Resolute. First up…</span>

                              <span>Guerilla Collective&#x27;s Summer Game Fest-adjacent live stream revealed a slew of new and upcoming indie games. But among the Braid-like puzzle platformers and narrative adventures were several horror games worth keeping an eye on. Here&#x27;s what stood out to us. 


The Fridge is Red
Easily the highlight of today&#x27;s stream, The Fridge is Red looks like what you might find if you went video game shopping in Hell. Heavily inspired by PlayStation 1 horror games – specifically Silent Hill – it tells the story of Frank, stuck in his basement staring for days at the titular red fridge. &quot;Not only the fear of a terrible death keeps him in place, but also the hope of getting his daughter back,&quot; the game&#x27;s Steam page reads. 
The Fridge is Red is a collection of different horror stories – or &quot;episodes.&quot; In …</span>

He earned millions of dollars and traveled the world, but also spent time in prison. Despite being wanted by the FBI for his alleged involvement with Nintendo hacking group Team Xecuter, Louarn doesn&#x27;t view himself as a criminal, but as a rebel instead.

Are you a fan of Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow? Are you a fan of Blasphemous? If you answered &quot;yes&quot; to both of those questions (heck, even just one), then you&#x27;ll definitely want to keep an eye out for The Last Faith, a Souls-like Metroidvania (or &#x27;soulsvania&#x27;, according to the publisher) making its way to Switch later in 2022.
From developer Kumi Souls Games, The Last Faith showcases gorgeous pixelated visuals along with challenging gameplay in a clear homage to Konami&#x27;s seminal Castlevania series. You&#x27;ll be navigating winding paths filled with deadly beasts before finding yourself toe-to-toe against huge boss creatures that will demand you make the most of your varied weaponry.

Another day, another Metroidvania! You love to see it, right? The latest title, 9 Years of Shadows, comes from developer Halberd Studios and is due for launch on Switch later this year.
Visually, the game looks spectacular, with some lovely use of colour and lighting throughout.

Hurrah for Sonic Origins! The upcoming compilation looks to be a fairly definitive take on the classic Mega Drive and Mega CD Sonic games, with widescreen presentation and various quality of life features.
It’s hardly the first time that Sonic has been collected, though, is it? In fact, he’s no stranger to the world of the compilation whatsoever. We’re taking a look back through the history of Sonic compilation packages, in order to see which ones got it right, which went wrong, and what Sonic Origins could possibly learn from them.

                              <span>Interplay’s formerly console-exclusive action RPG Baldur’s Gate: Dark Alliance 2 is being re-released this summer 18 years after it spawned, marking its first appearance on PC. It’s obviously the follow up to Baldur’s Gate: Dark Alliance, which was similarly late in coming to PC (and modern consoles) at the end of last year. Scout the next game’s trailer out below.

                              <span>Square Enix and People Can Fly have unveiled more details of the endgame for Worldslayer, the upcoming first paid expansion to their online co-op action RPG Outriders. Outriders’ creative director Bartek Kmita says there’s “hundreds of hours of meaningful progression” in Worldslayer’s endgame, which sounds like a lot, but the focus is mostly on the replayable big new Trial of Tarya Gratar dungeon. Check out the full broadcast below for some shooty footage.

The Lord Of The Rings: Return To Moria is a multiplayer action survival game about the Dwarves trying to reclaim the most cursed mine in all of fantasy canon. It&#x27;s due out in Spring 2023 and will, of course, be an Epic Games Store exclusive.

                              <span>Guns and swords are a useful combination, so imagine having a gat-toting frog riding on top of a blade-wielding robot. That’s essentially the cut and thrust of Moving Pictures Interactive’s roguelite co-op action adventure Shoulders Of Giants, coming to the Epic Games Store later this year. They’re not quite a 21st century Banjo-Kazooie, but they’ll do in a pinch.

Equally, what is building a jigsaw but piecing together an analogue cardboard PC you can&#x27;t do anything with after it&#x27;s finished? These similarities are why building a PC isn&#x27;t as strange a subject for a videogame as it first appears.

If you like your electric jigsaws, then good news: there&#x27;s now an open beta available for PC Building Simulator 2.

                              <span>Ever since Diablo Immortal launched amid a storm of controversy last week, people have been trying to work out how much it really costs to play this theoretically free game. I&#x27;ll be honest that maths has never been my strongest suit, but figuring out how games work under-the-hood is one of my favourite things to do. So I&#x27;ve spent most of this week chasing answers, and I&#x27;ve come up with a ballpark estimate of what it would cost to max out your character. The answer is: £46,000, or $51,000, to fully equip your character with the best gear as quickly as possible using premium currencies.

                              <span>One time in the office (so, a hundred years ago) a hypothetical was posed: if you were given the chance to go to the moon, with a guarantee that nothing would go wrong, would you take it? &quot;No,&quot; I said. &quot;No way. Not a chance. I wouldn&#x27;t like it.&quot; People were shocked at my refusal. &quot;But nothing will go wrong!&quot; they exclaimed. This misses the universal truth that even - and indeed, especially - when it is guaranteed nothing will go wrong, something will always go wrong in space.
Honestly, who can say that they&#x27;ve played a video game set on a space station and not encountered at least one deserted corridor plunged into darkness, but with one spotlight tipped over onto its side to cast ominous shadows? Raise your hands. Terror in space has never gone out of fashion, really, but the source of the terror does seem to go in cycles. In the 2010s a lot of the danger came from an AI gone a bit sinister and funny. As we saw at last night&#x27;s Summer Game Fest, though, the monsters are back, baby.

The stream will last for ten minutes and we’re asked to “Please be excited.” Okay then, I will. But only if it’s not about another Final Fantasy VII spin-off.

                              <span>No, not SHODAN or GLaDOS. I mean the other sort. The magic formulae of raw computer nonsense that runs under the cover of your favourite game and makes enemies flank you, or friendly NPCs toss a health kit just in time. Good AI is not an unbeatable genius. It is smartly stupid. It is both surprisingly clever and capable of wonderful carelessness. It can remind us of ourselves. Quick-witted on a good day, an absolute dunderhead on a bad one. Here&#x27;s a list of the 7 best AI in PC games.

                              <span>Staff who worked for Bethesda on post-apocalyptic multiplayer RPG Fallout 76 have come forward to share their stories from its development, and they don’t make for pleasant reading. Developers who spoke anonymously to Kotaku said they’d crunched in ten-hour shifts over six days a week prior to Fallout 76’s launch, with some saying they fantasised about being injured to avoid having to come into work the following day.

                              <span>Anger Foot. It’s angry and there are certainly plenty of feet. From Free Lives, the creators of Broforce and Genital Jousting, it’s so aggressively kicky that I don’t feel like going near doors anytime soon. They describe it as a “lightning fast hard bass blast of kicking down doors and kicking ass”. Good grief. Keep an eye on the threatening tootsies in the trailer below.

                              <span>Ubuntu 22.04 na desktopu má ve výchozím stavu aktivovaný systemd-oomd, který v případě nedostatku paměti ukončí některé procesy. Problémem je, že tak činí příliš brzy, bez jakýchkoliv známek, že se blíží OOM. A také podle skóre často zabije Chrome či gnome-shell.</span>

Ve středu však byl zveřejněn nový rekord výpočtu π, které bylo spočítáno na 100 biliónů cifer. Za výpočtem stojí  Emma Haruka Iwao z Google a k výpočtu byl použit Google Cloud se 128 virtuálními CPU a 864 GB RAM. Při výpočtu není až tak důležitá hrubá síla, jako spíše úložiště. K dispozici bylo 663 TB, z toho bylo použito 515 TB. Celkově bylo zapsáno 38,5 PB a přečteno 43,5 PB.</span>

                              <span>I rarely feel as conflicted about a game as I do about Honkai: Star Rail. It&#x27;s a turn-based RPG and I like those; but it&#x27;s a JRPG and I dislike those. It&#x27;s got a spacefaring train in it, which I always think is cute; but also it&#x27;s got anime waifus in it and those make me cringe. Its new trailer, which you&#x27;ll find below, is dynamic and exciting and well-edited; but... it&#x27;s got cringy anime waifus in it.

Watch it and make up your own mind.

This wasn&#x27;t part of anything, and was instead a random and unexpected announcement. Only kidding! It was one of many things shown at Summer Game Fest tonight.

Check out the new trailer below, which also delivers news of its release date and a playable demo.

                              <span>Day Of The Devs is probably my favourite part of the summer games jamboree every year because it does wonders for the visibility of indie games and their developers. Slotting in snugly right after Geoff regaled us with the Summer Game Fest stream, this year’s Day Of The Devs showcase marked the tenth anniversary. Tim Schafer and friends revealed more about some stonking looking indies from places as far apart as the Netherlands, Japan and Argentina. It was lovely to see some solo devs featured too, such as Madison Karrh with Birth, a point-and-click puzzler about loneliness, and Billy Basso’s beautiful pixel-art Metroidvania Animal Well.

                              <span>Revealed tonight at Summer Game Fest, you can whet your appetite for the new Saints Row game by making your boss character right now. Described as &quot;the ultimate body shop&quot;, Boss Factory is a free standalone demo you can access in The Epic Game Store (or by following a series of links through SaintsRow.com). In it you can have a ride on the character creator before the game comes out in August, and save your favourite and most bizarre looks. This was revealed with a trailer with all explosions and montages and that.

The good news is that our favoured platform will receive the same fancified version as is being developed for PlayStation 5; the bad news is that while the PlayStation 5 version has a September 2nd release date, there&#x27;s no confirmed date for the PC version yet.

And that&#x27;s fine. I&#x27;m good with that. That&#x27;s great, really. Vermintide is fun but I&#x27;ve no affinity for Warhammer Fantasy so yes, give me bolters and Inquisitors and Ogryns and sci-fi Gothic cathedrals. See for yourself below.

I&#x27;m afraid I am now of the opinion that &quot;dark fantasy first-person shooter&quot; is one of the most underwhelming word combinations in the English language. But hey, it&#x27;s a video, the game could be bananas good when it comes out, and I&#x27;m duty bound to tell you all about it in case you get really excited for it - and if you do, then good news, &#x27;cos the video confirms it&#x27;s coming to early access on the Epic Games Store soon (aiming for Q4 2022).

Then, earlier this year, they announced The Cub, a side-scrolling platformer telling a parallel story of one of the poor souls left behind on our home planet while the rest of humanity buggered off to Mars. Now, Demagog seem to be expanding their Wasteland-verse with a third entry: Highwater. It&#x27;s not clear how this one relates to the others just yet, but it does feature a rather lovely yellow lifeboat in a flooded cityscape. Check out the reveal trailer below.

The Seventies aesthetic and Milton Keynes-esque, city-of-the-future feel shown in previous looks at the game are still very much in evidence – those massive swan statues are boss, and nobody hates monorails, right? Take a Logan’s Run at it yourself by watching the new trailer.

                              <span>Goat Simulator 3 was announced this evening during Geoff Keigh-3&#x27;s Summer Game Fest. Yes, that&#x27;s 3, despite there never being a Goat Simulator 2. The announcement trailer doesn&#x27;t show anything in-game, but suggests it&#x27;ll still be about causing havoc as a goat, only now with co-op and Epic Games Store exclusivity.

                              <span>Summer Game Fest just got scary with the announcement of psychological horror Layers Of Fears, the next instalment in Bloober Team’s jump-fest series that might really be a remaster, sort of? Bloober say it&#x27;s the &quot;psychedelic experience fans know and love&quot; and has &quot;an expanded plotline&quot;, so this doesn&#x27;t sound like an entirely new game. The freshly revealed Layers Of Fears is being built in Unreal Engine 5. As such, the trailer makes for pleasantly unpleasant viewing.

                              <span>In a very short and technically not at all sweet teaser trailer at the Summer Game Fest this year, we saw that terrible things are afoot in isolated space station Fort Solis. Honestly, why does anyone bother building isolated space stations? It&#x27;s like getting married at Christmas in Albert Square at this point. Geoff was joined on stage by Roger Clark (who you will know from being Arthur Morgan in Red Dead Redemption) and Troy Baker (who you will know from, I dunno, throw a dart, you&#x27;ll hit one) to briefly talk more about their characters and what the hap is heckening in this horror adventure game.

It&#x27;s also getting another major patch in the form of the &quot;Bolivar Patch&quot;, that&#x27;s focused on community features. But first, the DLC. This will explore the heritage of Latin America, letting players progress from the ancient era Caralans through to the Nazca, Taíno, Inca and contemporary Argentinians and Cubans. You needn&#x27;t wait to dig in, either, as the Latin America pack is out right now on Steam and the Epic Games Store.

Flashback 2 is coming from long-established French studio Microids, developers of the Syberia series. It’s been 30 years now since the original game released on PC, and Geoff Keighley was very excited to re-announce the sequel. Check out the trailer below.

                              <span>Chance has always been an integral part of Firaxis’ turn-based tactics games. Just ask the many thousands of players who missed a shot with a 90% success chance in one of their XCOM reboots. Marvel’s Midnight Suns, however, could be the Civilization studio’s biggest gamble yet. Not only is it their first game to mix substantial RPG elements into its tactical combat, but there’s nary a hit percentage in sight. In the four hours I spent playing the opening of Midnight Suns last week, I saw precisely one scenario that had any kind of per cent number attached to it – and that was booting a goon (100%) or Venom, one of the newly confirmed villains of the game (0%), off a rooftop. All your other attacks, represented here as a deck of cards, are guaranteed hits.
It’s a strategic evolution I’ll talk about in a second, but this switch-up in approach isn’t the only part of Midnight Suns story that’s been subject to the whims of (mis)fortune. No sooner had Firaxis announced the game it was delayed in the snap of Thanos&#x27; fingers (from March to the second half of 2022, now confirmed as October 7th at tonight’s Summer Game Fest). But speaking to creative director Jake Solomon, the extra polishing time they set aside gave them an unexpected benefit. And it’s all down to a fish witch called Wanda.

Scarlet Witch, Hulk and Venom will repping the game&#x27;s big bad demon mother Lilith. Man, if there&#x27;s one Avenger I wouldn&#x27;t want going all evil on me, it&#x27;s Hulk. And Scarlet Witch, to be fair. Why have these heroes joined the dark side in Firaxis&#x27; new tactics RPG? Well, we&#x27;ll be able to find out when the game launches on October 7th. Here&#x27;s a new trailer to celebrate.

A US court previously issued orders for all ISPs to block the sites and instructed third-party service providers to cease doing business with them. The plaintiffs say that since Cloudflare is refusing to comply, the company should be held in contempt of court.

This request, unsurprisingly, comes from a company that offers a VPN detection service.

                              <span>Canada&#x27;s Federal Court has handed down a &#x27;dynamic&#x27; blocking order to prevent live NHL games from being viewed via pirate IPTV streams. The first of its kind in Canada, the flexible injunction was obtained by companies including Rogers, Bell, The Sports Network, and Groupe TVA. Unusually, it will be independently audited to assess over-blocking and any user circumvention via VPNs.

                              <span>Hosting provider LeaseWeb is being sued for copyright infringement at a federal court in California. The lawsuit was filed by photographer Barry Rosen who argues that Leaseweb failed to take action against &quot;infringing&quot; poster sites, despite receiving repeated DMCA notices. The owners of the infringing sites are unknown and listed as Doe defendants.

                              <span>A few months have passed since we released ScummVM 2.5.1.
No matter if you expect the scorching heat of the upcoming summer or freezing blizzards in winter (depending on your favorite hemisphere): it’s release time again!
Our lovely developers added support, yet again, for a bunch of new ancient games that require testing:
Sanitarium
Hades Challenge
Marvel Comics Spider-Man: The Sinister Six
The 11th Hour
Clandestiny
Tender Loving Care (CD-ROM Editions)
Uncle Henry&#x27;s Playhouse
Wetlands
Chewy: Esc from F5
Besides these games, we’d appreciate it if you could check our release testing list - maybe you’ll even find your favorite game on there that has been sitting on that shelf for way too long.
And since ScummVM is about playing games in general, we’ve seen quite a bunch of changes across many, many engines - so this is the perfect time for giving your favorites another go.
The AGOS, SCI and SCUMM engine received some really extensive modifications which make all games using those engines very good testing targets as well.
All testing must be done with stable builds, not development ones. Please report any bugs or oddities on our issue tracker.
A detailed list of all exciting new features and fixes is available in our NEWS file.
Thank you very much for your support!

                              <span>Jak jsme na tom s řízením kybernetické bezpečnosti. Broadcom převezme VMware za 61 miliard dolarů. Nový IT normál? Cloudové služby, edge computing a automatizace. Téměř polovina finančních ředitelů považuje samoobslužná data a analytiku za hnací sílu produktivity zaměstnanců. Elektroniku čeká další zdražování, zejména kvůli růstu cen čipů. Zdokonalovat lze i kvantové simulátory.</span>

                              <span>After an extended period of time, we&#x27;re finally ready to announce that the game Chewy: ESC From F5 is ready for testing. This quirky game features the protagonist Chewy as he tries to outwit the evil Borks. Escaping from their high security zone, F5, will just be the start of his adventure.
If any of you have the game and are willing to test it out, we&#x27;ll welcome any feedback. You will need a daily development build. As always, please submit the bug reports to our issue tracker. 
Please note that the ScummVM version does have one major outstanding issue: the music used by the game is in a custom format we&#x27;ve been unable to properly support yet. So only sound effects and speech currently work at this time.

                              <span>A few days ago, Google announced the list of students accepted for this year&#x27;s Google Summer of Code.
We are very proud to welcome 4 students this year who will be working on various parts of the project during the upcoming months.
Pragyansh Chaturvedi (aka Raikou) will work on improving our DIRECTOR engine. His effort will help us to allow support for many 90s-era adventure games made with the Macromedia Director authoring tools. By implementing more internal functions used by DIRECTOR, Pragyansh&#x27;s main objective is to extend support for Meet Mediaband and The Journeyman Project (Win and Mac), making them fully playable without any glitches.
Michael Hayman (aka Quote58) is about to implement support for The Immortal. The game (released in 1990) can be described as a mix of genres involving RPG elements with action and puzzles. Many changes across different game variants (written in pure assembly code!) will make this an interesting challenge. This project is a continuation of a GSoC task initially started by a former student back in 2018.
Emanuele Grisenti (aka grisenti) will be working on a new engine, HPL1. The original sources for this engine got recently released by the original developer Frictional Games under GPLv3. The purpose of this project is to achieve a full port of this engine to ScummVM, with the goal of supporting the 2007 survival game Penumbra: Overture.
Avijeet Maurya (aka StableSteady) will pick up several incomplete engines: MacVenture, Avalanche, Glk-Scott, Pink and WAGE. Some of these engines are very close to completion, but not quite there yet. The main objective of Avijeet&#x27;s task is to identify all missing features and fix existing bugs. The goal for his project is to bring the above engines to a stable state.
The team is very excited about the upcoming weeks – and we hope you are as well.
Please give a warm welcome to our new students! Let&#x27;s make GSoC 2022 a huge success – together!
