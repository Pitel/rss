                              <span>Oh look, it’s the end of the year. I’m very much not looking forward to those first few months where I must train myself to write out the year with a 3 at the end, but thanks to tonight’s much-awaited The Game Awards 2022, I’m left feeling about 33% more hyped for all the games we’re gonna get to play next year.
On the off-chance that you missed the live show, fear not. We’ve sacrificed our sleep to round up every little thing that was trailered or announced at this year’s Game Awards. Take a look at everything that’s on the games horizon, and let us know what you’re looking forward to the most in the comments below!

                              <span>The Geoffries tonight saw the announcement of a new cooperative heist FPS with set in the 90s, with an extremely 90s cast. 90s actors featuring in Crime Boss: Rockay City include Michael Madsen, Kim Basinger, Danny Glover, Danny Trejo, and even Vanilla Ice and Chuck Norris. The game looks a whole lot like Payday but honestly, I&#x27;m always up for more heists. Check out the trailer below.

It&#x27;s called Immortals of Aveum, and it&#x27;s being made by the recently-formed Ascendant Studios - which you might remember is Dead Space creative director Bret Robbins&#x27; new thing. Details about the first-person magic shoot &#x27;em up are slim, but the trailer shows off some flashy magical spells and a fantasy city in crisis. You can watch the teaser reveal below.

Good job you’re around to give it a jolly good thwacking in action-survival game Remnant 2, a sequel to Remnant: From The Ashes announced during The Game Awards tonight. Your do-gooder can play solo or team up to sort out some pretty unpleasant monstrosities with up to two pals. Have a glance at the trailer below to see some very creepy beasties, and hear someone absolutely wail on their axe.

Well, now FromSoft are returning to big stompy boys with Armored Core VI: Fires Of Rubicon, coming in 2023. Check out the cool mechs in the announcement trailer from tonight&#x27;s Geoffries, below.

                              <span>Final Fantasy 16 got a fiery new trailer tonight, as well as a final release date of June 22nd 2023. At least that&#x27;s the date for PS5 players. For us folks on PC, tonight&#x27;s Game Awards trailer confirmed in tiny small print that Square Enix&#x27;s next JRPG epic won&#x27;t be landing on &quot;other platforms&quot; until December 31st 2023 at the earliest. So, unless Squeenix are going to deliver us a belated Christmas New Year special next year, I think it&#x27;s safe to assume that FF16&#x27;s PC release won&#x27;t be available to summon until 2024. Still, based on what we&#x27;ve seen in its new &quot;Revenge&quot; trailer tonight, I reckon it will be well worth the wait.

                              <span>During The Game Awards, Behaviour Interactive announced that their new PvP raid game Meet Your Maker will debut next year on April 4th 2023. This is a wholly new IP from the studio, who you might know as the creators behind survival horror slasher, Dead By Daylight. Check out what Behaviour Interactive mean exactly by a &quot;building-and-raiding game&quot; by watching the trailer below.

                              <span>Right, here’s where I have to stay objective and professional. I’ve been a card-carrying Transformers fan since Generation 1, so I’m somewhat confused by the trailer shown at The Game Awards tonight for Gears studio Splash Damage’s upcoming co-op action game Transformers: Reactivate. Yes, theoretically any rather large robot that changes shape counts as a Transformer. Possibly a GoBot, I’m not going to judge anyone on their lifestyle. Just watch the trailer below and tell me what you think, go on.

                              <span>Man, I was never much of a Flash liker, but even I feel a bit sorry for him in tonight&#x27;s new trailer for Rocksteady&#x27;s Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League. He gets a right old beating in the new Game Awards footage, but thankfully it looks like The Batman will be on hand to deliver some much needed... justice (sorry) when it comes out on May 26th 2023. Maybe. Miss you, Kevin Conroy.

This &quot;gameplay reveal trailer&quot; only has a few wee snippets of the game being played, but they&#x27;re solid. As our boy Spice Maureen stomps through vast Gothic industrial ruins and cuts through hordes of aliens, it&#x27;s got that &#x27;Dynasty Warriors meets God Of War&#x27; look again. But I do already miss the Orks.

                              <span>Don&#x27;t Nod are still primarily associated with Life Is Strange and a handful of other narrative-focused adventure games. Back in 2018, however, they also made action RPG Vampyr, which mixed more substantial combat among their usual focus on story. 

It&#x27;s in this vein that Banishers: Ghosts Of New Eden seems to continue. It&#x27;s an action RPG about &quot;two proficient ghost hunters and lovers&quot; set in the haunted, frozen wilderness of 1695 North America. You can watch the reveal trailer below.

                              <span>The big Company Of Heroes 3 news from tonight&#x27;s Game Awards was that, in addition to launching on PC on February 23rd next year, the WW2 RTS will also be coming to PS5 and Xbox Series X and S consoles in 2023 at a later date. The exact timing of the Company Of Heroes 3 Console Edition is yet to be confirmed, but it will mark the first time Relic&#x27;s historical real-time strategy game will be available to play outside of PC. However, if you were hoping to get in on some PC / console crossplay action regarding the game&#x27;s multiplayer, you may be disappointed, as publisher Sega confirmed to me today that they have &quot;no plans to support crossplay between PC and consoles for multiplayer at launch&quot;.

                              <span>After six months of shambling around PlayStation 5 consoles, Naughty Dog&#x27;s first installment of The Last Of Us is heading to PC next year. Confirmed at tonight&#x27;s Game Awards, The Last Of Us Part 1 will be clicking onto PC on March 3rd 2023. Honestly, I just want to see the giraffes again, really. Those zombies can get stuffed.

                              <span>Anime is a Good Thing. There, I said it. Those cel-shaded visuals instantly got my attention when the new trailer for free-to-play MMORPG Blue Protocol popped up at The Game Awards this evening - and that Hiroyuki Sawano soundtrack ain&#x27;t bad either (that&#x27;s one for the Gundam Unicorn and Attack On Titan fans out there). It&#x27;s being developed by Bandai Namco, but for some reason New World and Lost Ark publisher Amazon Games will be the ones bringing the MMO to the west in the second half of 2023. Either way, you can watch the trailer below and repeat my own very succinct inner monologue, if you like. Repeat after me: “Ooh, cel-shading. Nice.”

And it shows! The game certainly looks like an ARPG, akin to say, Torchlight, with heroes battling against shadowy monsters to earn lots of rare and epic and legendary loot. It looks fine, good and dandy, so why not give the reveal trailer below a nice little watch?

                              <span>It&#x27;s been a full year since ex-BioWare boss Aaryn Flynn and his new studio Inflexion announced Nightingale at The Game Awards. In case you&#x27;ve forgotten, Nightingale is a PvE crafting survival game with a strong Victoriana vibe, but since our chat with them back at Summer Games Fest in June, and an early access delay into the first half of 2023 to accommodate the switch to Unreal Engine 5, we haven&#x27;t heard too much about the game.


I got to natter with Flynn, director of production Leah Summers, and art director Neil Thompson earlier this week, ahead of the debut of a new trailer for Nightingale at The Game Awards this evening. They filled me in on how the game&#x27;s blend of fairies and reality-hopping realmwalkers has progressed over the past year - and it turns out that players have had a lot to do with it.

Devs Larian Studios have shared a new trailer at The Game Awards, revealing that the RPG threequel will head out of early access in August 2023. Not only that, but some well-known heroes from the first two games are returning too. Watch the trailer below to see how old hands Jaheira and Minsc are faring these days, and get a peek at the city of Baldur’s Gate.

                              <span>Sci-fi shooter Judas is the latest game from Bioshock director Ken Levine&#x27;s studio Ghost Story Games. It shares a fair bit in common with Levine&#x27;s previous work too, judging by the trailer shown during The Game Awards tonight. You’re the unfortunately named Judas, a mysterious figure trapped on a starship that’s falling to bits. Our Judas is also surrounded by some not very nice folks. See for yourself by watching the trailer below.

                              <span>If you’ve ever opened an umbrella and wished you could take off into the air like a fussy Edwardian governess prone to breaking into song, then you’ll probably get a kick out of the latest trailer for Nightingale. We got another glimpse at Inflexion&#x27;s survival craft ‘em up during tonight&#x27;s Game Awards, which showed off some of the magical enchantments you’ll get to encounter. Case in point: flying brollies. Have a watch below and tell me this don’t look like a right lark, guv’nor. What? I’m British, I can talk like Dick Van Dyke if I want.

Neomuna, the neon capital megacity of Neptune, is very pretty. The new &#x27;Strand&#x27; powers of grappling hooks and rope darts look dead cool. Bungie always have good trailers. It doesn&#x27;t show any of the mindnumbing grind you&#x27;ll be forced through to play the best bits but hey, that&#x27;s trailers.

It&#x27;s Supergiant so of course we get a gorgeous animated trailer for it, too, which you can watch below.

A roguelite action adventure developed by Upstream Arcade and published by Good Shepherd Entertainment, Web Of Wyrd was revealed at tonight’s Game Awards. It&#x27;s the first game to star Hellboy since 2008&#x27;s Hellboy: The Science Of Evil. You can see Big Red in action by giving the trailer below the ol’ watcheroonie.

Of course, the most important thing about that trailer is the announcement of the release date. The Final Fantasy XVI release date is June 22, 2023. And remember, it&#x27;s coming exclusively to PlayStation 5.
Since the game was originally announced, we&#x27;ve learned quite a bit about the upcoming action RPG. For starters, the game will not be open-world and will instead use a collection of large, explorable areas. Yoshi-P has also taken to the press to talk about the overall direction of the series moving away from its turn-based origins to become arguably the premier action RPG series in the world.
Final Fantasy XVI will be the first mainline entry in the storied series in nearly seven years. That&#x27;s a long time to wait, but with Yoshi-P at the helm, I believe it will have been worth it.

                              <span>Medieval is out, mechs are back in
The studio behind the Souls series is returning to another part of its roots. FromSoftware has confirmed it&#x27;s working on Armored Core VI Fires of Rubicon.
Revealed tonight at The Game Awards 2022, Armored Core VI Fires of Rubicon sees the studio return to the mech series with some serious production value. Check out the trailer below to get an idea for yourself:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;kKO1s-CUZvY
The new Armored Core entry is currently set for a 2023 launch. The trailer splash shows both PlayStation 4 and Xbox One alongside PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Steam.
A return to a classic series
It&#x27;s been a while since FromSoftware went back to the Armored Core series. The mech action lineage started in 997 on the PlayStation, and carried on through Armored Core: Verdict Day in 2013.
The early entries of Armored Core are certainly well-remembered. But as sentiment waned on newer releases, the series took a backseat. With the Souls games taking off, FromSoftware followed their trajectory, leading up to games like this year&#x27;s Game Awards heavyweight Elden Ring.

FromSoftware has certainly earned enough goodwill from fans to revisit the series. I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing how those who jumped on with the Souls series take to the giant mechs and action of Armored Core. As someone who played a good few of them on his PlayStation 2 back in the era, I&#x27;m certainly keen to see what FromSoft does with this series years later.
Armored Core VI Fires of Rubicon is currently slated for 2023.

                              <span>Hopefully, it&#x27;s more than meets the eye
I&#x27;ve made it a rule to try and avoid writing about game announcements that are nothing but CGI trailers and I&#x27;m going to break that rule right now. One of the more curious announcements from The Game Awards was for a new Transformers game called Transformers: Reactivate. 
From developer Splash Damage, Reactivate will be a 1-4 player online action game planned for PC and consoles. In the game, a team of human survivors will Autobots to fight back against an extinction-level threat. The short blurb on the game&#x27;s website mentions &quot;salvage&quot; which leads me to believe you&#x27;ll be customizing your Autobot or Autobots.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;edBK2ZpYY_0
Sadly, it&#x27;s still just a CGI trailer. Hopefully, we&#x27;ll get a better look at what Splash Damage has in store before Transformers: Reactivate enters Early Access next year.

                              <span>A reimagined classic sets out next month
Ken and Roberta Williams&#x27; 3D interpretation of the classic Colossal Cave is set to launch next month. Colossal Cave will go live on January 19, 2023.
Announced tonight at The Game Awards 2022, the new version of this adventure is coming to Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Windows PC and Mac, and the Meta Quest 2. Previous generation consoles, the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, are expected to get Colossal Cave sometime in Q1 2023.
This 3D version of Colossal Cave is based on the original Colossal Cave Adventure, a classic text adventure game. Sierra On-Line co-founders Ken and Roberta Williams have taken that classic and made it 3D, moving from words and descriptions into full-on environments. There&#x27;s still a narrator though, to capture some of that original feel.
The goal is to traverse the cave, collect items, and return home safe and sound. Simple, it may seem, until you realize how much danger awaits in the cave.

Find the treasure and escape the cave
Getting a new version of a classic is something that happens quite often in games. But for both this particular game, and the developers behind it, Colossal Cave feels like a cool way to  honor the long legacy games have built up over the years.
I&#x27;m fascinated to dig into the cave for myself. This was a segment of PC gaming I never got around to, and it&#x27;s been re-imagined by developers who have a lot of respect for the era. And Colossal Cave being playable in virtual reality on the Meta Quest 2 is pretty neat, too. This is a neat convergence point of gaming history to kick off 2023.

The deepest dungeons and demon-infested catacombs are open for business again next year. Blizzard Entertainment will launch Diablo IV on June 6, 2023.
The latest dungeon-crawler from the Blizzard crew revealed the date at tonight&#x27;s Game Awards 2022. Tonight&#x27;s cinematic trailer includes a lot of evil demons, one shining warrior in particular, and plenty of doom and gloom.

Back into the dungeons
Ever since the reveal of Diablo IV at BlizzCon 2019, there has been speculation of when we might finally see the latest Diablo emerge. Rumors have bounced around, and Blizzard itself had to temper expectations as to when it might arrive. A sizable leak of the game dropped not too long ago though, adding more fuel to the fire.
It&#x27;s all happened as Activision Blizzard has been caught up in a storm of events. The lawsuits, the still-pending acquisition of Activision Blizzard by Microsoft, and unionization of the QA team at Blizzard Albany have all transpired between that 2019 reveal and now.
Adding on top of the pile is a report published today from The Washington Post. In it, employees at Activision Blizzard tell the Post that the June 6 date will be hard to meet without working significant overtime. Sources allege mismanagement, including crunch that&#x27;s incentivized by company stock shares and DoorDash credits. There are also details about a previous version of Diablo IV&#x27;s script that involved the rape of a female love interest, in order to have a grittier tone. Employees reportedly fought it, and eventually managed to get this version of the story revised.
Basically, a lot has gone down since that first reveal, and it sounds like development has been troubled, to say the least. We did get some recent hands-on impressions, and it seems like things are coming together. But there&#x27;s a lot of baggage hanging over this sequel now, headed into an actual launch.

Nintendo is planning to start 2023 off with a bang with the release of Fire Emblem Engage. The follow-up to the excellent Fire Emblem: Three Houses sees Alear, a Devine Dragon, awaken after 1,000 years of slumber to gather the Emblem Rings that have been spread across the continent of Elyos. Taking a page from Fire Emblem Heroes, Engage is leaning big into the franchise&#x27;s legacy with classic characters appearing in the game. That&#x27;ll continue with the season pass as well. As revealed at The Game Awards, the Fire Emblem Engage Season Pass will bring your classmates from Three Houses into the mix, as well as series staple Tiki.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;7lZFtCbP0uk
As revealed on Twitter, the Fire Emblem Engage season pass will consist of four waves of content. Starting on January 20, those who buy the DLC will get Edelgard, Dimitri, Claude, and Tiki, as well as support items, in-game accessories, and whatever the heck the silver card is. Hopefully, this is a good indicator of what fans can expect from the remaining waves of content.
Fire Emblem Engage also launches on January 20, 2023. So gives me about five weeks to finally make my way through the Cindered Shadows storyline in the Three Houses DLC.

                              <span>Don&#x27;t lose your way (finder)
Airship Syndicate is teaming up with the studio behind Warframe for a new multiplayer title. Wayfinder is a co-op action RPG that mixes fantasy and tech for some co-op action RPG adventures.
Revealed at tonight&#x27;s Game Awards 2022, Wayfinder is a new action RPG for PC and consoles, aiming for 2023. Creative director Joe &quot;Mad&quot; Madureira, of Battle Chasers fame, is at the helm with Airship Syndicate. Digital Extremes, the company behind Warframe, is publishing.
Wayfinder is set in the world of Evenor, which is gradually being consumed by Gloom. Wayfinders (the players) take up the mantle and fight the Gloom, working to fight back against its spread together.

Each Wayfinder has their own unique story to explore and play style to utilize. You can collect and craft gear to improve your loadout, while also boosting up your character themselves. Runs can be customized with unique modifiers and challenges to offer special hunting and gathering chances.

The draw is multiplayer, and it looks like you can set out with a pretty decently sized party. Alongside fighting the Gloom, there&#x27;s also an at-home customization element with the player&#x27;s Apartment.
Finding a way forward
While Airship Syndicate and Digital Extremes are aiming for 2023 on PC and console, you&#x27;ll potentially be able to play Wayfinder before the year&#x27;s out. A closed playtest is being held for Wayfinder starting on Tuesday, December 13. If you want to try it out, you can head over to the Wayfinder PC playtest sign-ups here. Meanwhile, PlayStation playtests will be held in January.
Then, in spring 2023, the duo of Airship and Extremes aims to launch Wayfinder into Early Access on PC and PlayStation. A free-to-play full launch is expected to follow in fall 2023, and embrace Digital Extremes&#x27; &quot;free-and-fair&quot; monetization policy, according to a press release.

                              <span>Larian charts a course for Baldur&#x27;s Gate next year
After several years in development and Early Access, Larian Studios is locking in a launch window for Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3. The next entry in the RPG series will arrive sometime in August 2023.
Revealed at The Game Awards 2022, tonight&#x27;s trailer showed off more of what&#x27;s to come in the next Baldur&#x27;s Gate. From old faces to new surprises, it seems like a lot.
Throughout the trailer, we see looks at what&#x27;s in store beyond the currently available Early Access version of Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3. While an excursion to the actual location of Baldur&#x27;s Gate is one thing, there are also some familiar faces in store too.
Both Jaheira and Minsc appear in the latest look at Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3. These two were companion characters in Baldur&#x27;s Gate II. Jaheira has aged thanks to the years since BG2, while Minsc has not, as he&#x27;s spent quite a chunk of time petrified up until now. Larian even teased this development on social media leading up to The Game Awards. No sign of Boo yet, though.

The party sets out in 2023
The team at Larian Studios took the reins on Baldur&#x27;s Gate years ago. Their successes with the Divinity series speak volumes, but in picking up where the BioWare of old left off with Baldur&#x27;s Gate, the Larian team has been tackling a lot.
So far, in the Early Access versions that we&#x27;ve played over the years, it&#x27;s felt like Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 is in a good place. That&#x27;s just the starting point, though. We&#x27;ve only seen what chunks of the first Act hold for our party of tadpole-infested adventurers. There&#x27;s still a lot of RPG to go.
Thankfully, Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 is aiming further into the year, past the spring rollout of new releases. Hopefully the August date holds true, and we&#x27;ll see the entirety of what Larian has in store in the new year.

                              <span>BB has come to
Another strand game is finally on the way. Kojima Productions officially unveiled Death Stranding 2 at The Game Awards 2022 tonight.
Studio head Hideo Kojima took to the stage tonight to introduce the project, a sequel to 2019&#x27;s Death Stranding. The trailer featured several familiar faces, including Norman Reedus as Sam Bridges and Léa Seydoux as Fragile.
As for what&#x27;s happening in the trailer? I couldn&#x27;t tell you if I tried. But really, that&#x27;s the appeal of Death Stranding to begin with, and Death Stranding 2 is carrying on the bizarre, vague trailer tradition.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;tp6fSjMb0MQ
Not many more details have been revealed just yet. As is the case with a Kojima trailer, I&#x27;m sure eagle-eyed viewers will pick the video apart for hints and clues about what&#x27;s going on, and what&#x27;s transpired in the dystopian American future of Death Stranding leading into Death Stranding 2.

                              <span>Kevin Conroy&#x27;s Batman will be in the new Rocksteady game
Rocksteady has locked in a release date for Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. Alongside seeing the DC anti-hero squad finally debut, we&#x27;ll also get to hear Kevin Conroy&#x27;s voice as Batman once again.
Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League will debut on May 26, 2023 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. We got a new trailer for it at tonight&#x27;s Game Awards 2022, spotlight the squad dealing with what looks like the aftermath of their rumble with The Flash.

As it soon becomes apparent, the Caped Crusader is hot on their heels. And he also seems to have dropped the &quot;not killing anyone&quot; thing, too.
Confirmed during tonight&#x27;s Game Awards, the late Kevin Conroy will still be the voice of Batman in the coming Rocksteady game. Conroy lent his voice to many iterations of Batman over the years, including voice acting for Rocksteady&#x27;s Arkham series. And in Suicide Squad, we&#x27;ll get one more portrayal. The Game Awards trailer closed with a tribute to the actor.

While Geoff Keighly tried to keep as many reveals under wraps as he could, it was inevitable that some titles would sneak their way on the internet beforehand. While Star Wars Jedi: Survivor was officially announced a few months ago, at The Game Awards we got our first look at how the game looks in action and I have to say it looks leaps and bounds better than its predecessor.
Or maybe it doesn&#x27;t. Fallen Order is still on my backlog. Anyway, Jedi: Survivor brings back Cal Kestis and is set five years after the events of Fallen Order. Hunted by the Empire, he&#x27;ll have to do what it takes to survive, even if it means making some alliances.

I&#x27;ve been more or less burned out on the whole Star Wars universe for a while now, but following the excellent Andor, I&#x27;m ready to get deeply back into a galaxy far, far away. And this looks fantastic and also like a lot of the 9.5/10 games that are building up in my backlog. Star Wars Jedi: Survivor will launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on March 17, 2023, which, following the new Bayonetta game announcement, is my most anticipated game release day of next year.

                              <span>Let&#x27;s begin at the beginning
With so many games releasing this fall eating up all of my time, I&#x27;m sad to admit I haven&#x27;t had more than an hour or so to dedicate to Bayonetta 3. After all the kerfuffle over the game in the weeks prior to its release, I&#x27;ve been trying to find the time to play it and see just about the ending is pissing so many people off. Turns out, I&#x27;ll need to play it asap because Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon is coming pretty soon.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;H5b3_gydc_0
Arguably the most surprising announcement of the first hour of The Game Awards (you know, aside from Al Pacino being there), Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon will take the Umbra Witch back to the very beginning. Sporting a new art style and camera perspective, players will control Cereza and her first demon Cheshire as they fight faeries and solve puzzles while trying to find her mother.
This is not the direction I thought the character would go in next, but given what I&#x27;m looking at the in Bayonetta Origins trailer, it definitely seems like something that is right up my alley. Also, there isn&#x27;t a Bayonetta game I haven&#x27;t bought yet, so yeah, I&#x27;m gonna get it. And dammit, this one needs an art book too.
Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon will release on March 17, 2023, just in time for my 38th birthday.

                              <span>I&#x27;m not Bio-shocked that this game looks so good
For a long time now, fans of the Bioshock series have been waiting to see what&#x27;s next from Ken Levine and his team at Ghost Story Games. Their project had been kept under tight wraps with plenty of whispers but nothing concrete until tonight. One of the first trailers in The Game Awards this year was the Judas reveal trailer and, yeah, it looks a lot like a spiritual successor to classic first-person shooter series.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;FoLJ4HgWqw4
Sadly, it&#x27;s one of those trailers you have to watch on YouTube. Guess all the blood and guts makes it inappropriate for younger viewers.
Anyway, there is a lot to take in with this trailer, and some of the imagery points to Levine once again diving into some controversial projects in the creation of this world. I&#x27;m definitely impressed by what&#x27;s here so far and can&#x27;t wait to see more in the weeks and months ahead. Hopefully, it&#x27;s able to overcome Levine&#x27;s storied perfectionism that often leads to tumultuous development cycles.
Judas does not have a set release date, but when it does release, it will arrive on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Steam, and the Epic Game Store.

                              <span>It&#x27;s time to deal with some more gods
Supergiant Games is working on its first-ever sequel. The studio announced today that Hades 2 is in development.
The sequel to 2020&#x27;s Hades debuted at The Game Awards 2022 tonight, spotlighting the new lead. It looks like the titular god of the underworld is in chains, and his daughter is embarking on a quest to take on Cronus.
See more of it in the trailer below:

We can spy some familiar mythological faces like Nemesis that seem set to appear in Hades 2. During the show, it was confirmed that Hades 2 will be using an Early Access model. More details are coming in 2023.

The final trailer of The Game Awards pre-show was a big one for fighting game fans. After retailer leaks earlier today pointed to a summer release for the highly anticipated fighter, Capcom confirmed it to be true with its latest trailer. Not only does it confirm that release date, but it also gives players their first look at Dee Jay, JP, Manon, and Marisa.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;ilw0xDkfk2Q
Yep, that still looks wonderful. The big draw for me with Street Fighter 6 has been its single-player mode and I think this trailer gives us the best look at it yet. I love the idea of fighting random on the street, which is looked down on for some reason in the real world.
Anyway, Dee Jay looks great here and I can&#x27;t wait to see more of Manon, Marisa, and JP.
Street Fighter 6  launches for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on June 2, 2023. The game is available for preorder now with some custom color outfits up for grabs.

                              <span>The impostor&#x27;s not hiding anymore
The social deduction and impostor game Among Us is doing away with pretenses through a new mode. Among Us adds a Hide n Seek mode this week, on December 9.
Rather than hiding in plain sight, it&#x27;ll be the crewmates&#x27; turn to hide from the monster. Hide n Seek will have the crew of Among Us fleeing a monster who&#x27;s trying to hunt them. No votes, no decision-making. Just flee, and try to finish tasks before you get found.

More is on the way for the update too, including new cosmetics and the ability to name pets. Also screaming? Not sure how that plays in. Either way, from VR to Hide n Seek, it&#x27;s been impressive to see how Innersloth keeps finding new ways to change up the social deduction and deception of Among Us.
For those looking to find new ways to play their favorite whodunnit game this holiday season though, an official Hide n Seek seems like a fun way to ring in a holiday party. Hide n Seek goes live for Among Us tomorrow, December 9.

                              <span>Return to Castlevania
The first announcement of The Game Awards pre-show just might end up being one of the best reveals of the night. Dead Cells, one of the best games of the past five years, is getting a new DLC campaign in 2023 that&#x27;ll bring some familiar faces. Dead Cells: Return to Castlevania looks like it&#x27;ll bring Simon, Richter, and Dracula to the world of Dead Cells.
Or is the Beheaded invading the world of Castlevania? Either way works for me as these are two excellent franchises that&#x27;ll likely go together like peanut butter and jelly. Or a brick wall and cooked chicken.

Return to Castlevania is the third DLC package for Dead Cells, following Rise of the Giant and The Queen and the Sea. The game is available on nearly every platform and was recently released for Apple Arcade as Dead Cells+. That&#x27;s how I&#x27;ve been playing it recently and I keep forgetting how much I love this game. Hopefully, I&#x27;ll be able to experience this DLC on the platform when it releases in Q1 2023.

[Update: Confirmed live on The Game Awards 2022 stream, yes, Vampire Survivors is officially out and free to play on mobile.]
Horde survival hit Vampire Survivors just landed on some new platforms. Vampire Survivors is now available on mobile, through the iOS App Store and Google Play Store for Android.
The indie bat-blasting survival game seemed to drop out of nowhere, indicating this might have been a planned reveal for tonight&#x27;s show at The Game Awards 2022. Vampire Survivors is nominated for Best Debut Indie Game at tonight&#x27;s awards.
The iOS and Android versions of the game are both free-to-play, and will take up a little over 470 MB to download.
Overall, this mobile version looks to be the legit, real Vampire Survivors that has sucked away hours and hours of time on PC. For phone, there is an option to play with different orientations, vertical or landscape.
Interestingly enough, one of the mechanics in this F2P version of Vampire Survivors is the option to view ads. It looks like the ad option lets you get a revive, at the cost of watching a mobile game ad. Truly nothing in the vampire afterlife is free, I guess.
Survive the night
Ever since Vampire Survivors dropped into Early Access last December, it&#x27;s been a popular time-killer. Poncle&#x27;s blend of pixel art and limited gameplay as your little survivor tries to not get overtaken by hordes of nocturnal monsters is incredibly compelling.
That&#x27;s not all the Vampire Survivors in store for 2022, either. Poncle is releasing its first DLC for Survivors next week. Dubbed Legacy of the Moonspell, it will add a new map, characters, weapons, and more.
Now that the vampire survival can live on my phone? Between this and Marvel Snap, I&#x27;m going to be spending a lot of time playing some mobile games during the holidays.

Where does the year go? It only seems 12 months ago that I was writing up a special watch post, inviting the Destructoid community to join us for The Game Awards 2021, and now I&#x27;m writing up a special watch post, inviting the Destructoid community to join us for The Game Awards 2022. Sunrise, sunset...
Yes, it&#x27;s that time of year again, as Geoff Keighley and pals, supported by an advisory board consisting of the most powerful company directors in gaming, take to the stage for a look back on mega hits that have been whirring in our HDDs (and SSDs) for the past year. And what a year it has been, populated with smash-hit sequels, epic adventure titles, the return of some M.I.A. IPs, and the debut of some entirely new worlds and characters. Sure, I know ever…</span>

                              <span>A generation of fans may love From Software for its litany of Souls games, but the studio was once primarily known for its other beloved series, Armored Core. Tonight at The Game Awards, the studio revealed a new entry in its mech shooter franchise: Armored Core IV: Fires of Rubicon. 
A cinematic trailer set the table, which begins on a rather gloomy (and lava-filled) note before the mechs emerge to kick up the tempo a few notches. Fires of Rubicon is the first entry in the series since 2013’s Armored Core: Verdict Day, so fans have waited a long time for tonight’s news. Check out the trailer below. 


Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon is launching in 2023 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.</span>

                              <span>While the new trailer for the upcoming expansion of Cyberpunk 2077 starts out with some voice lines from Keanu Reeves, the surprise appearance comes from a newly revealed character. Solomon Reed appears as a new figure played by Idris Elba.
Few concrete details are apparent from the trailer, but the spirit and visual styling of Cyberpunk 2077 remains in clear evidence. We know that Phantom Liberty is built as a spy-thriller set in a new district of Night City and that V somehow works together with the government of the New United States of America, and presumably alongside the newly revealed Solomon Reed.
Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty is set for release in 2023 on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</span>

                              <span>Publisher CI Games and developer Hexworks have released a new trailer for its upcoming sequel, The Lords of the Fallen, and it&#x27;s another dark and terrifying look at the Soulslike series. 
Lords of the Fallen was released back in 2014, and GI Games revealed its long-awaited sequel, The Lords of the Fallen, during Gamescom&#x27;s Opening Night Live back in August. A new trailer showcasing another look at the world of this sequel was released during The Game Awards 2022 tonight, and while it only featured a few glimpses of gameplay, it seems The Lords of the Fallen is shaping up to be a worthy successor. 
Watch The Lords of the Fallen gameplay teaser below: 


The Lords of the Fallen is set 1,000 years after the original Lords of the Fallen, and it&#x27;s been designed with cooperative play in mind, according to Hexworks. Two players can play together in uninterrupted online play and experience an &quot;expansive RPG experience filled with NPC quests, compelling characters, and rich narrative,&quot; according to a press release from earlier this year. 
The Lords of the Fallen will be released on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. A release date has not yet been revealed, but it&#x27;s due out sometime in 2023.

                              <span>Activision has announced Crash Team Rumble, a 4v4 team-based online multiplayer game starring Crash Bandicoot and his furry/scaly friends. The game sees Toys for Bob, the studio behind Crash Bandicoot 4: It&#x27;s About Time, step back into the developer role for the Crash Bandicoot series, but with a decidedly different approach in tow.
Crash Team Rumble puts players in the shoes of Crash, Dingodile, and the Bandicoot&#x27;s stable of friends and enemies. Each character has their own powers, personality, and playstyle as they duke it out in 4v4 competitions across a wide array of arenas. The teams compete in a variety of activities to bank the most Wumpa fruit in their drop-off zone while simultaneously defending it.
&quot;We&#x27;re so excited to unveil our fresh new take on multiplayer in the Crash universe with Crash Team Rumble,&quot; Paul Yan, co-studio head at Toys for Bob said in a press release. &quot;Crash Team Rumble has something for everyone – easy pick-up and play for those who just want to jump in, while also providing skilled gamers the opportunity to leverage and master their hero&#x27;s unique abilities.&quot;
You can see the reveal trailer below.


Crash Team Rumble comes to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One in 2023. The game features cross-platform play, so you thankfully won&#x27;t need to coordinate with friends or agonize over which version to pick up.</span>

                              <span>Dontnod Entertainment has revealed their next game: Banishers: Ghosts of a New Eden. While Dontnod is known best for its work on the Life is Strange series, Banishers is an action/RPG, and it might share more in common with the studio&#x27;s 2018 game Vampyr. For a better look at the game, check out the teaser below.


In the reveal trailer, a man sits across the table from a woman, holding her hand. Another person in the room calls the man a banisher, one who hunts ghosts. Then, the woman at the table dissolves away into a blue light, indicating that she was a ghost the whole time. Afterward, we get a glimpse at what gameplay might look like, with the man and his ghostly companion leaping into battle with an undead creature called a bonewalker.
Outside that brief trailer, we got a release window. Near the end of 2023, Banishers: Ghosts of a New Eden will come to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</span>

The long-in-development action/RPG is finally nearing release, and we got a confirmed release date this evening. You’ll be able to confront demons to your heart’s content beginning on June 6, 2023.
While the trailer didn’t offer a wealth of new details about the game, it did show off a pretty epic battle between the forces of Heaven and Hell. The forces seem to be led by Tyrael on one side and Lilith on the other side, and two massive armies clash over the course of the battle.
Check out the full trailer for a glimpse of Blizzard’s top-notch cinematic storytelling.</span>

                              <span>Bandai Namco Studios, Bandai Namco Online, and Amazon Games are teaming up to release Blue Protocol, an upcoming MMO action RPG with anime visuals to more territories and platforms, including North America.
Blue Protocol was not announced during the 2022 Game Awards, but up until now, it hasn&#x27;t been clear if the game would be making its way outside of Japan. During the show, a new trailer for the game was shared, alongside a confirmation that the game would be coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC in new regions the second half of 2023. Amazon Games also shared that Blue Protocol would be receiving a closed beta early next year.


Blue Protocol will be free-to-play, but will be playable in full for free. Monetization will come from character customizations and other cosmetics. Amazon Games also shared that the game can be played alone, or cooperatively with friends.</span>

                              <span>Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 launches in August 2023, developer Larian Studios announced during tonight&#x27;s The Game Awards. The announcement arrived alongside a new trailer and details surrounding the game&#x27;s Collector&#x27;s Edition.
The Collector&#x27;s Edition includes a 25-centimeter Mindflayer vs. Drow battle diorama made from high-quality PVC/ABS plastic, an approximately 160-page hardcover art book, character sheets, a cloth map, a tadpole keyring, 32 die-cut stickers, three Magic: The Gathering booster packs featuring characters from Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3, an oversized metal Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 D20 die, and a Collector&#x27;s Edition certificate. The Collector&#x27;s Edition will cost $270 and will be limited to 25,000 units worldwide.
On top of that news, we also received a trailer showing beloved characters Minsc and Jaheira&#x27;s return, as well as the gameplay debut of the City of Baldur&#x27;s Gate. You can see the trailer below.


Prior to the August 2023 1.0 launch, Larian will release Patch 9, which will include various improvements to the Early Access version, including a new playable class. Details of that will be revealed during a special streamed panel on December 14.
Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 has been in Early Access since 2020, so this August 2023 release window is a long time coming. Since that Early Access launch, Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 has achieved a &quot;very positive&quot; rating on Steam user reviews, with nearly 50,000 reviews logged as of this writing. According to the Steam page, version 1.0 will include all classes and races, and most spells from the Dungeons &amp; Dragons Player&#x27;s Handbook, plus Acts 2 and 3 of the Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 story.</span>

                              <span>Bandai Namco has released a new trailer for Tekken 8 and it features our first look at gameplay. 
The trailer showcases various Tekken 8 fighters, including series mainstay Jin Kazama. His mother, Jun Kazama, makes an appearance in the trailer as well to tell Jin that together, they&#x27;ll &quot;cleanse the world of its evil and corruption.&quot; 
Check out the Tekken 8 gameplay trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Tekken 8 is looking great. The trailer above is mostly focused on teasing details about the game&#x27;s story, which will seemingly feature Jin and the struggles of his family dynamic (thanks, Heihachi). There are also quick clips of Tekken 8 gameplay, although it&#x27;s void of the UI that showcases each fighter&#x27;s HP and other elements. 
Tekken 8 was revealed earlier this year during a PlayStation State of Play held in September. That reveal trailer focused on Kazuya and his son, Jin, and you can watch it here. 
Tekken 8 will be released on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC via Steam. It does not yet have a release date.

                              <span>Death Stranding 2 – the sequel to one of the best games of the previous console generation – was announced tonight during The Game Awards. As you might expect from director Hideo Kojima, it was baffling. 
The trailer begins with Fragile, played by Lea Seydoux (No Time to Die, Crimes of the Future), running from some kind of threat while carrying a BB (a baby in an artificial womb; it&#x27;s a whole thing) in tow. We then get a brief look at Sam Porter Bridges – the protagonist of the first game, played by Norman Reedus (The Walking Dead) – who Fragile tells, &quot;It&#x27;s time for you to hit the road and start a new journey.&quot; Then everything truly goes off the rails. 
Giant mecha vehicles (not too unlike the titular Metal Gears from Kojima&#x27;s previous series at Konami, Metal Gear Solid). Primary antagonist Higgs dressed like President Amelie Strand and playing an electric guitar. A BB pod full of tentacles. The ominous question, &quot;Should we have connected,&quot; casting doubts on the entire objective of the first game – connecting the United States – all quickly flashes onscreen. If it sounds like a lot, it is. Check it out for yourself below:


We&#x27;re calling it Death Stranding 2, but from the looks of it, the game is actually named DS2. Also, aside from the previously mentioned movie stars, it features Elle Fanning (The Neon Demon) and Shioli Kutsuna (Deadpool 2). 
During a brief interview after the trailer, Kojima revealed he and his company, Kojima Productions, are also working on another video game project and other &quot;visual&quot; works.
No real release information was given, though the game is once again being published by Sony. The trailer also said the footage was captured on a PS5. So, it might be safe to assume Death Stranding 2, like Death Stranding before it, will have some window of exclusivity on Sony platforms. Guerilla Games will also be acting as a support studio, and its proprietary engine, Decima, will once again be used for the game.</span>

From the trailer below, the game seems to adhere closly to the Metroidvania platforming action of Celeste, but there&#x27;s likely more than meets the eye. Unfortunatley, we won&#x27;t get to play Earthblade until 2024 and there are no announced platforms as of yet.</span>

                              <span>A new clip from Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League reveals that Kevin Conroy, who passed away earlier this year, will return to play Batman. Conroy made his first appearance as Batman in 1992’s Batman: The Animated Series and has continued to play the character in countless shows, movies, and games. He portrayed Batman in the Arkham games, the series Rocksteady is best known for.


Unlike the Arkham games, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League is a co-op shooter. Harley Quinn, Captain Boomerang, King Shark, and Deadshot are on a mission to stop the Justice League after supervillain Brainiac corrupts them and forces them to wreak havoc on humanity. While it sounds like a bleak premise, this trailer also gives a good look at the dark humor the Suicide Squad is known for.
Rocksteady also announced that the game would be coming out on May 26, 2023, just a few months from now. This news comes following years of delays and will set it eight years after the studio’s last game, Batman: Arkham Knight.</span>

That info was confirmed in this evening’s trailer at The Game Awards, so we now know with confidence that the game is targeting a launch on March 17.
The trailer was accompanied by a visit from Cal Kestis himself, Cameron Monaghan. The actor is returning to play the beleaguered Jedi in the sequel, and he was around to follow up after the trailer to discuss his enthusiasm for the game. 
For fans eagerly anticipating new details, the trailer offers a lot over which to muse. We see that Cal looks like a more grizzled and powerful Jedi than when we last saw him training to become a knight. That truth is denoted perhaps most po…</span>

                            <span class="media-object__text">
                              <span>Kratos voice actor Christopher Judge has revealed that he initially quit when he learned that someone other than God of War (2018) director Cory Barlog was directing God of War Ragnarök. Longtime Santa Monica Studios lead Eric Williams directed the sequel, which released last month. 
Fortunately for all of us, though, Barlog was able to convince Judge that quitting was not the right call. Judge touched on this during his lengthy speech at The Game Awards 2022 after accepting the award for best performance in a video game.


Here&#x27;s what he said: 
&quot;I think it&#x27;s kind of common knowledge that we were honored to go to Tribeca after 2018, and when Cory took me outside and said he wouldn&#x27;t be directing the next one, I literally did quit. I quit. And he said, &#x27;Nah, I vouch for Eric.&#x27; And I said, &#x27;Eric Williams better be a beast.&#x27; Eric Williams is a motherf---ing beast.&quot;
It&#x27;s unclear if Judge legitimately quit or if he was just using these words to express his initial disappointment that Barlog was not returning to direct Ragnarök. Nonetheless, Barlog vouched for Williams, and now we have Ragnarök, one of our highest-rated games of 2022 here at Game Informer.</span>

                              <span>Helping to ramp up an evening of world premieres at The Game Awards this evening, Supergiant Games revealed its newest game. Hot on the heels of the wild success of Hades, Supergiant is doing something it’s never done before: crafting a sequel.
After its previous work on titles like Bastion, Transistor, and Pyre, the studio’s new game takes us back to the roguelike playstyle of the original game, but with a new female lead fighting their way through hordes of enemies.
Instead of Zagreus’ attempted escape from Hades, Hades 2 sees players attempting to descend to fight against the titan named Kronos. The character is dubbed the “Princess of the Underworld” but given the previous game’s nod to Greek mythology, there’s a good bet that this new character has some interesting ties to the big players in that well-known pantheon.
Beyond the intriguing trailer, there’s no word on release date or console platform plans, but we do know to expect new details on Early Access in 2023, and that the game is coming to both Steam and Epic Game Store on PC.</span>

                              <span>Ghost Story Games, the team led by BioShock creator Ken Levine, finally unveiled its first project. It&#x27;s called Judas, and if you&#x27;re a BioShock fan, you&#x27;ll be happy with what you&#x27;re about to see. 
To say this title follows in BioShock&#x27;s footsteps would be an understatement. From its industrial sci-fi look to its first-person dual-wielding, superpowered action, Judas sports the familiar trappings of Levine&#x27;s work at Irrational Games. Ghost Story describes it as a single-player, narrative-driven shooter and provided this tantalizing synopsis:
&quot;You are the mysterious and troubled Judas. Your only hope for survival is to make or break alliances with your worst enemies. Will you work together to fix what you broke – or will you leave it to burn?&quot;


Levine formed Ghost Story games in 2014 after he closed Irrational, only taking on a small group of designers from the former studio. They&#x27;ve been working on its first title ever since, though whether that game has always been Judas remains to be seen. After years of mostly silence, many wondered if we&#x27;d see anything come out of the studio; it was reported earlier this year that the team&#x27;s first project had gone through a rocky patch. Thus, it&#x27;s nice to see the fruits of their labor finally.
Judas doesn&#x27;t have a release window, but it&#x27;s coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</span>

                              <span>At long last, Street Fighter 6 has a release date. Hot on the heels of a second beta test announcement (and retailer leaks earlier this morning), Capcom announced that the next entry arrives on June 2. On top of that, we received a new trailer and details on the Deluxe Edition.
When Street Fighter 6 launches, it will deliver new innovations like real-time commentary, multiple control schemes, and World Tour mode. The base game includes 18 characters ranging from iconic names like Ryu, Ken, Chun-Li, and Blanka to new faces like Luke, Jamie, and Kimberly. For the full list of characters coming to the base game, head here.
The new trailer showed off the World Tour mode, which lets you customize your avatar and travel the world to locations like the US, France, and more. We also got a new look at several previously announced but not-yet-revealed characters, including Dee Jay, Manon, Marisa, and JP.


An earlier leak on Amazon also revealed Street Fighter 6&#x27;s Deluxe Edition, which includes the base game, the Year 1 Character Pass featuring four characters, colors 3 through 10 of each Year 1 character, and a bonus 4,200 Drive Tickets for in-game purchases.
We recently flew to Osaka, Japan for our most recent cover story and came away impressed with the studio&#x27;s vision and our extended hands-on time with the game. For more on our trip to Capcom&#x27;s headquarters, including a fun Rapid-Fire interview and deep dives into the character designs, visit the cover hub by clicking on the banner below. Street Fighter 6 arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC on June 2, 2023.</span>

                              <span>Piccolo Studio, the makers of 2019&#x27;s Arise: A Simple Story, unveiled its next project, After Us, during The Game Awards.
Set on a dead Earth after the extinction of humans and wildlife, players control Gaia, the Spirit of Life, who must recover what’s left by restoring the souls of perished animals while learning how they met their fate. Unfortunately, the ravaged planet is now occupied by dangerous oil-drenched creatures called Devourers that Gaia must contend with as she clears the world of their corruption. After Us places a big emphasis on traversal, as Gaia can glide, jump, and dash across abstract environments, spreading beauty along the way.  


After Us will launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC next Spring.</span>

                              <span>Hot on the heels of Bayonetta 3&#x27;s release in October, tonight during The Game Awards, Platinum Games and Nintendo announced Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon. 
Stepping away from the series&#x27; traditional gameplay and visual style, Origins plays out in a cel-shaded art style and an isometric camera angle. It was hard to get too good a grasp on the gameplay from the trailer, though it does look akin to the Viola chapters from Bayonetta 3 – where the player character&#x27;s combat actions are deemphasized over summons instead. Additionally, it appears that the main summon is Cheshire, who indeed was Viola&#x27;s only summon in Bayonetta 3. Though time will tell if Origins fairs better. 
Narratively, you play as a young Bayonetta – or Cereza, as is her actual name. You can get a better idea of the overall story and see the game in action in the trailer below:


Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon will be released on Nintendo Switch on March 17, 2023.</span>

                              <span>Announced with a trailer at the Game Awards, Returnal, the formerly PS5-exclusive shooter, is coming to PC. Unfortunately, no release window was given.


Returnal is a roguelike third-person shooter developed by Housemarque, and was one of the first exclusives released on PS5 when it came out in April 2021. You play as Selene Vassos, an astronaut that finds herself stuck in a time loop on an alien planet. It made an appearance at last year&#x27;s game awards as well, where it was nominated for three awards and won Best Action Game. If you want to learn more about the game, you can read our review, where we called it &quot;a relentless nightmare that’s a dream to play.&quot;

                              <span>Developer Upstream Arcade and publisher Good Shepherd Entertainment have revealed Mike Mignola&#x27;s Hellboy Web of Wyrd, an upcoming roguelite action game with an art style reminiscent of classic Hellboy comics. 
This news was revealed during the pre-show segment of The Game Awards 2022 by way of a fancy trailer showcasing some of the game&#x27;s methodical but (literally) punchy combat. The game will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC sometime in the future, but a release date was not revealed. 


&quot;Hellboy Web of Wyrd is a roguelite action adventure with an original story created in partnership with Dark Horse Comics and creator Mike Mignola,&quot; the game&#x27;s Steam page reads. &quot;When an agent goes missing, Hellboy investigates. Prepare for monstrous toe-to-toe brawling.&quot; 
As you can see in the trailer above, it&#x27;s clear Upstream Arcade is aiming for Hellboy Web of Wyrd to feature a visual style reminiscent of Mike Mignola&#x27;s original Hellboy comics. It&#x27;s easy to see how characters, enemies, and more from those comics could be integrated into the game with such an art style as well.

Unfortunately, we&#x27;ll have to wait to learn more but Hellboy fans will want to keep Web of Wyrd on their radar (especially given how tragically few Hellboy games out there exist).

                              <span>Dead Cells is getting an official Castlevania DLC crossover sometime early next year, called Dead Cells: Return To Castlevania, as announced today during The Game Awards pre-show. The news was announced via a brief animated trailer. 
The trailer didn&#x27;t reveal too much about the DLC, nor did it show any looks at gameplay. Though, given Dead Cells is a Castlevania-inspired indie rogue-lite, we likely assume the core formula will remain roughly the same. The game&#x27;s Steam page offers a bit more info: A gateway to a striking castle has suddenly appeared, and an imposing warrior called Richter asks you to help him vanquish the great evil within. Enticed by the promise of new loot rather than a sense of moral duty, you strike out through the grounds and corridors of the gothic castle to find and kill this mysterious Dracula.


 Additionally, the Steam page boats 51 classic Castlevania songs, 12 newly reimagined tracks, and a brand-new storyline. Gameplay unfolds throughout a fully-explorable Dracula&#x27;s castle and will feature 14 Castlevania weapons, readapted into Dead Cell&#x27;s gameplay, three &quot;epic&quot; boss fights, and 20 outfits from &quot;Alucard, Richter Belmont, Simon Belmont, Maria Renard, Trevor Belmont, Sypha Belnades, or even Dracula himself.&quot;
No specific release date was given, but Return To Castlevania is expected to be released sometime during &quot;Q1&quot; 2023. It will be available on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC.</span>

                              <span>As a surprise ahead of The Game Awards, Vampire Survivors has been released for free on iOS and Android. Both versions are available now. You can find the iOS version here and the Android version here.


Vampire Survivors is an indie roguelike RPG where the player has to avoid hordes of monsters, undead, and (you guessed it) vampires. As you destroy enemies, you progress through a randomized skill tree to unlock new weapons and abilities. To get a better idea of the game, you can read our review, where we called it a “Single-Stick Masterpiece.”
In other Vampire Survivor news, earlier this week developer Poncle announced DLC called Legacy of the Moonspell. It comes with eight new survivors, thirteen new weapons, six new music tracks, new monsters, and a new stage, which they’ve called their biggest yet. It comes out soon, on December 15.</span>

                              <span>Yesterday morning, John Garvin, the creative director of underwhelming zombie biker drama Days Gone tweeted that its poor reception was due to &quot;woke reviewers&quot;. In a statement released this evening, Garvin&#x27;s former employers and Days Gone developers Bend Studio say they do &quot;not share his sentiment, nor does it reflect the views of our team.&quot;

                              <span>Many games make you think you&#x27;re going to have a grand old time building a cute village, then they trick you into managing supply chains, or fighting raiders, or eating your pals to survive. Not the case with Tiny Glade, a lovely looking upcoming game where you really do just build dioramas of cute villages, castles, meadows, and ruins using friendly tools that help you make it look good. Check out the rural Townscaper vibes in the trailer below.

Other games will have other perks on Game Pass, including Riot&#x27;s mobile games—a novelty for Game Pass. Sadly this offering does not include Riot&#x27;s paid games, like the League spin-off RPG Ruined King. Read on for more details on what Riot are bringing to Game Pass.

After months of review, during which Microsoft argued that the merger was fine because Activision Blizzard&#x27;s games aren&#x27;t that great really, the FTC have filed a complaint which argues that the acquisition &quot;would enable Microsoft to suppress competitors to its Xbox gaming consoles and its rapidly growing subscription content and cloud-gaming business.&quot;

                              <span>Rockstar have teased a new story update coming to GTA Online next week, which pits players against a ramshackle bunch of rival drug dealers. The Los Santos Drug Wars kick off on December 13th with the first part of the update. The short post on Rockstar’s Newswire blog isn&#x27;t exactly awash with details at the moment, but it does give an idea about the kind of dodgy characters and shenanigans you’ll get to encounter, including an angry looking luchador and the return of GTA 5’s Nervous Ron.

                              <span>There’s still so much we don’t know about the next stealth strategy game from the makers of Desperados 3 and Shadow Tactics: Blades Of The Shogun. Until yesterday, all we had was a codename (“Süßkartoffel”, or Sweet Potato), and a few other scant business facts developer Mimimi Games posted about on their blog last year. In fact, the only concrete thing we really know about it right now is that it’s not going to be Shadow Tactics 2. 
However, in chatting to Mimimi this week about leaving real-time tactics behind in favour of their new &quot;Stealth Strategy&quot; label, I’ve managed to glean a few more details. Alas, Mimimi still aren’t ready to reveal Süßkartoffel’s official name just yet, but head of design Moritz Wagner told me it’s not only going to be much more beginner-friendly than their previous games, but that it will also be much more like one big sandbox this time, resisting the urge to limit players by strict level constraints. To me, it all sounded a bit like they were aiming for something akin to Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain, so I asked him about whether that was an accurate assessment of it. “Yes and no,” he said.

                              <span>The makers of Shadow Tactics: Blades Of The Shogun and Desperados 3 have been thinking a lot about real-time tactics recently. Not just because they’re knee-deep in making their next tactics game at the moment, currently known as Codename Süßkartoffel (the word for &quot;Sweet Potato&quot; in their native German), but because they feel the genre as a whole doesn’t quite convey what’s so special about their catalogue of excellent stealth ‘em ups anymore. It’s a fair cop – despite appearing in our best strategy games list for many years, even I’ve struggled to come up with a succinct way of describing them. Thus, it’s time for a change, say the studio. 
In a blog post published today on Mimimi Games’ website, the studio announced they’re going to be referring to their work as “Stealth Strategy” games going forward, and they’re hoping this new genre label will help prospective players better understand their special blend of silent assassination tactics. This kind of shift isn’t without its challenges, though, so I caught up with the team at Mimimi to talk more about this newfound shift, and how it’s going to lay the foundations for what’s to come in Codename Süßkartoffel.

                              <span>Season: A Letter To The Future, a bike road trip adventure game with a very striking look to it, is coming out soon. Developers Scavengers Studio have announced a release date of January 31st, 2023. In Season you play as a young woman from a small village exploring the world by bike, and you meet people and record your journey, and discover traces of peoples past. It looks very nice. And I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s where Scavengers Studio would prefer we ended the discussion.

                              <span>Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is easily one of the best games I&#x27;ve played this year. Alas, I couldn&#x27;t vote for its rightful spot in the RPS Advent calendar because it&#x27;s only on Nintendo Switch, and would out me as somehow who quite enjoys the way anime south Londoners replace rude words with &quot;sparking&quot; or &quot;snuffing&quot;. Still, I will write about the game here! Sorry supporters.
Anyway, what I want to talk about is Xenoblade 3 – so far, at least – never losing sight of its inner tutorial. I&#x27;ve been hit with new, sometimes dizzying tutorials, tens of hours into the game&#x27;s story. Rather than being bummed out by this, I&#x27;m ecstatic. In fact, I&#x27;d argue it&#x27;s what makes the experience so special.

Put aside your search for an authentic former Prince Of Wales for a little while though, because the reigning monarch of search this year was puzzle game Wordle. Who would have guessed?

                              <span>Since release last Friday, The Callisto Protocol devs at Striking Distance Studio have been, I can only imagine, catastrophically hard at work on the PC build. The game was almost unplayable on PC because shader compilation was causing stuttering whenever anything new happened for the first time, which is not ideal in any game, but especially not an atmospheric horror game with jump scares. It&#x27;s hard to be terrified by something if the game pauses for over a second when it happens.
Anyway, the point is that a patch was released over the weekend, and another yesterday. I&#x27;m out of town right now, so I haven&#x27;t been able to install the second, but I did play test the first one, and whaddaya know? The Callisto Protocol ran smooth for me, using a PC with the recommended specs.

Although the tweet’s been deleted since, user Renka_schedule was able to take a screengrab. You’ll be able to tune in to the Game Awards-adjacent Forspoken stream at 6pm GMT/7pm CET/10am PT, and presumably find out more about the demo during it.

One of those could be the release date for Street Fighter 6, which appears to have crept onto the PlayStation Store ahead of any imminent reveal Capcom might have planned. Twitterer SurpriseBurn spotted a June 2nd, 2023 release date among pre-order listings for various editions of the latest in the long-running fighting game series.

Thus, a federal judge will weigh in and make a decision. Among other reasons, the FTC cites Microsoft’s record of using previous acquisitions to “suppress competition from rival consoles&quot; and points to the publisher&#x27;s purchase of ZeniMax in 2020 as an example, stating:

The colorful adventure game was first revealed at the same event in 2020. It stars a young woman who leaves her isolated village to explore the world for the first time on her bike. Unfortunately, the world is on the brink of suffering a mysterious catastrophe, and the woman collects memories of her experiences before everything falls apart. The bulk of the gameplay, naturally, consists of cycling to different locations and meeting the colorful personalities who inhabit them. You’ll document your adventures by taking photographs and making recordings. 


Season: A Letter to the Future will be available on PlayStation consoles and PC (both Steam and Epic). It&#x27;s worth noting that pricing differs by platform. The game costs $29.99 on console and $24.99 on PC with an additional 10% launch discount until February 7.</span>

We loved slaying Hell&#x27;s fiercest demons with the backdrop of crunchy guitar riffs, double-kick-pedal drum beats, and soaring vocals from some of metal&#x27;s most prolific artists. Today, developer The Outsiders and publisher Funcom have announced a wave of news, including a sales milestone, a new free title update, and the launch of the game on last-generation consoles.
Starting today, Metal: Hellsinger is available on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The game was originally announced for these platforms at its initial reveal in 2020, but the last-gen versions were eventually canceled.

The Game Awards is simultaneously the most anticipated and dreaded night of the year in games. It&#x27;s awkward, cringe-worthy, and the titles that are widely considered the best of the year don&#x27;t usually get credit where it&#x27;s due. Despite the annoyances, though, it&#x27;s still a night we all come together to watch, whether it&#x27;s for the new trailers and announcements, to see who actually won, or just to watch the trainwreck happen in slow motion. It can be either a miserable or somewhat enjoyable experience, and I choose the latter by making my own fun out of spite.
So, I brushed off my immaculate MS Paint skills and made a bingo card for this year&#x27;s 2022 Game Awards, because let&#x27;s be honest, it&#x27;s gotten pretty predictable at this point. New trailers, mispronunciations, a…</span>

Riot Games&#x27; library of competitive games is joining the ranks of Xbox Game Pass perks next week. League of Legends, Valorant, and more of Riot&#x27;s catalog are getting Xbox Game Pass benefits starting on December 12.
The collaboration was announced earlier this year, during the Xbox Bethesda Showcase in June. Riot Games, the studio behind big competitive titles like League and Valorant, would offer some benefits for Xbox Game Pass owners, and they&#x27;re pretty good ones too.
For League of Legends, a Game Pass subscription will net you all champions and access to new champions as they&#x27;re released. Valorant is similar, with all agents unlocked for Pass users. Same goes for Wild Rift, the mobile League version, whose benefits will arrive in January.
Legends of Runeterra will have all cards in the Foundations Set unlocked. And for Teamfight Tactics, there are some cosmetics. Additionally, everyone who links their accounts before January 1, 2023 will get some extra cosmetics.

Linking the Legends
Services go live on December 12, next week. To link it up, you&#x27;ll want to have the Xbox App installed and up-to-date on PC. There will be instructions to connect a Riot Account with an Xbox Game Pass account from there.
While a library of games to download or stream is already a big boon, this Riot x Game Pass collaboration is pretty big. Having access to every playable character in League of Legends and Valorant means a fair bit of either time or money.
With this, players wouldn&#x27;t need to worry about saving up currency or grinding for a new character to play. We&#x27;ll see what kind of effect it has. But as someone who&#x27;s played a fair bit of Riot&#x27;s games, I&#x27;m still surprised this deal is even happening.

                              <span>Pretty cute platformer
Hours before the main event of The Game Awards was the Wholesome Games&#x27; Snack Direct, a showcase of some upcoming wholesome titles from developers who dwell in the aesthetic of cozy cottagecore. Mail Time is one such game. From developer Kela Van Der Deijl and publisher Freedom Games, this adorable-looking platformer was previously announced for the Nintendo Switch, PC, and Mac. Today, Freedom Games confirmed the game will also launch on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;IydcIxSpoCA
I&#x27;m not one for the wholesome game scene as it&#x27;s burned me in the past and collect-a-thon platformers aren&#x27;t exactly my cup of tea, but the art direction for Mail Time is doing a lot of heavy lifting in getting me interested. Taking place in the warm and inviting Grumblewood Grove, the game puts players in control of a Mail Scout as they explore eight different locations delivering mail, listening to stories, and collecting bottle caps. The developer is promising an inclusive experience with this one, letting players choose their Mail Scout&#x27;s pronouns in addition to the standard character customization options.
With the 2023 release schedule up in the air right now–we&#x27;ll see how that changes after tonight–Mail Time won&#x27;t have much competition when it launches for Switch, PS4, PS5, PC, and Mac in April.

The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is suing to block Microsoft from acquiring Activision Blizzard. The regulatory agency issued a complaint today, saying the deal would enable Microsoft to &quot;suppress competitors&quot; to Xbox&#x27;s console, cloud gaming, and subscription content.
In a press release from the FTC, the agency argues that Starfield and Redfall&#x27;s Xbox console exclusivity runs counter to assurances given to European anti-trust authorities. The FTC also argues that Activision is one of a &quot;only a very small number&quot; of top video game developers in the world that create and publish games for multiple devices.

Chris Pratt&#x27;s casting of the voice of Mario in Illumination&#x27;s upcoming Super Mario Bros. Movie has been one of the most talked about events of the year in the gaming sphere. Most fans (like me) have been pretty skeptical that he&#x27;ll be able to pull off a fitting tribute to our favorite plumber, and every time a new trailer drops, we scrutinize and discuss, scrutinize and discuss. While I&#x27;m still excited for the movie as a whole, I&#x27;ll admit that seeing an amazing fan project has reignited my enthusiasm a bit. Enter a meticulously made realistic version of Super Mario Bros. with a realistic art style, featuring a lifelike character model of the one and only Chris Pratt.

Scavengers Studio&#x27;s life-recording adventure game Season is almost ready to set off. Season: A letter to the future will launch on January 31, 2023 for PlayStation 4, PS5, and PC via Steam and Epic.
The project will go live digitally on January 31 for $24.99, but before then, a demo will be available on Steam and PS5 until December 12.

Season: A letter to the future follows a young woman on a journey across the world. With trusty bike and recording equipment in tow, the goal is to catalog and record the world as it is now, before it all goes away in a coming cataclysm.
Different recording tools offer different ways to capture things. Whether it&#x27;s a journal or a recording, or even just some memories, it&#x27;s all a set of markers, remembering the world before it goes away.
A game for every season
This new game from Scavengers, the team behind battle royale The Darwin Project, is certainly a bit different. It&#x27;s a serene adventure about examining the world around you, rather than an explosive shooter. Its trailers so far have emphasized a beautiful, somber journey in store.
Scavengers was at the center of some allegations in early 2021, including accusations of high-level studio runners mistreating their employees. Following the report, Scavengers addressed the claims and made an update later on in the year, saying the team has worked to investigate and address the issues.
With a release right around the corner, I&#x27;m a bit keen to see what Scavengers has put together for Season. Tonight is The Game Awards 2022, a show sure to be full of blasts, explosions, and combat. So something a bit more meditative and mindful to balance all that out, right at the start of the new year? That sounds pretty nice.

Bandai Namco has announced that it has begun work on a new project based on Akira Toriyama&#x27;s short-lived manga series, Sand Land. Very little was revealed about the project and its form, but the publisher offered a short teaser trailer and promised to reveal further details on December 17.
First published in the summer of 2000, Sand Land was a short manga series written and illustrated by the Dragon Ball creator that appeared in the popular Japanese manga magazine Weekly Shonen Jump. Set in a dystopian world that has become almost entirely desert, with water in incredibly short supply. Our &quot;heroes&quot; are a small-town sheriff named Rao, and *checks notes* Beelzebub, prince of demons, who embark upon a quest to find the fabled Phantom Lake and return hydration to the planet. Also along for the ride is Beelzebub&#x27;s mischievous friend, Thief.
This setup could form the basis for a fun RPG or action-adventure, and given the military coup themes and tank-based weaponry of the manga, there&#x27;s much opportunity for antagonism, action, and adventure. Given Bandai Namco&#x27;s excellent treatment of Toriyama&#x27;s Dragon Ball franchise in recent years, we can assume that they have something authentic and faithful to the source material in the works.
Either way, we&#x27;ll find out more on Sand Land come December 17. Stay hydrated until then.

                              <span>Scream for me, Cleveland!
The devil really does have all of the best tunes — And anybody who doubts this would do well to check out Funcom&#x27;s sleeper hit of 2022 Metal: Hellsinger, which is not only celebrating hitting the one million sales mark, (and a Golden Joystick Award), but has also launched brand new ports on last-gen platforms PS4 and Xbox One!
Developed by Swedish studio The Outsiders and released in September of this year, Metal: Hellsinger is a frenetic first-person-shooter that combines the explosive and chaotic action of the genre with the guitar-styled wailings of some of the metal scene&#x27;s finest. Portraying a lost soul monikered &quot;The Unknown&quot;, players guide our hero through the bowels of the underworld in an effort to regain her lost voice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;jFAFzl_Tr7s
Metal: Hellsinger&#x27;s hook lies in its encouragement of the player to fight to the &quot;natural rhythm of the universe&quot; — shooting, dashing, melee attacking, and reloading to the beat of the game&#x27;s soundtrack. Power-ups and bonus points are awarded for extended synchronization of soundtrack and action, with soundtrack vocals performed by such screechers as Alissa White-Gluz (Arch Enemy), Mikael Stanne (Dark Tranquility), Matt Heafy (Trivium), Randy Blythe (Lamb of God), and Dennis Lyxzen (the Refused).
Launching on PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X, it was thought that the PS4 and Xbox One ports of Metal: Hellsinger had been canceled. But it would appear that The Outsiders has managed to complete its work on the last-gen editions, bringing the boom-boom to the wide audience that the game deserves. In addition, a new update has launched on all platforms, offering a new &quot;Archdevil&quot; difficulty setting and adding a new Elite Seraph demon to the armies of the damned.
Metal: Hellsinger is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

                              <span>Also, Dragon Quest Treasures
Crisis Core Reunion, arguably one of the last big games of 2022, is out on December 13. Before that, there&#x27;s Dragon Quest Treasures on December 9. These are really two of the finishing touches on 2022, a really strange year for gaming. Everything started out really strong with Elden Ring, then it kind of waxed and waned as the year went on.
In terms of what&#x27;s left to scrape out of the jar of 2022, it&#x27;s High on Life on December 13 (not on Switch), the Witcher 3 Xbox Series X/PS5 upgrade, River City Girls 2 (that&#x27;s on Switch!), and Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth (not on Switch).
There&#x27;s also a few odds and ends hitting the eShop this week, as well as Front Mission 1st: Remake. Check out the full list below and enjoy it! The rest of the year will be relatively relaxing.

                              <span>Lea upon layer
Kojima Productions has dropped another character teaser for its unannounced new project, ahead of whispers that tonight&#x27;s Game Awards will offer up a full reveal of the next title coming out of the esoteric developer.
Much like its previous teasers, the new image depicts the shadowed face of one of the game&#x27;s cast, emblazoned with a simple question &quot;How Come?&quot;. The mysterious image follows on from the previous reveals of actors Elle Fanning (The Neon Demon, Maleficent) and Shiloli Kutsuna (Deadpool 2). While the identity of the new face is yet to be confirmed, fans are strongly convinced that it is that of Lea Seydoux, (No Time to Die, The French Dispatch) who has previously portrayed &quot;Fragile&quot; in Kojima Productions&#x27; Death Stranding.
https://twitter.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1600596136632279040?s&#x3D;20&amp;t&#x3D;DRErVG6METsZbv8ZMDBkqw
Does this latest teaser confirm that the new Kojima title is a Death Stranding sequel? Ehh... Hardly. I know we live in an era where people seem to recognize Characters and not Actors, but it&#x27;s just as likely that, if it is indeed Seydoux, Hideo Kojima simply wished to work alongside her again. Either way, it probably won&#x27;t be too much longer before we hear a little more about the project, as Kojima himself has been seen in Los Angeles, all but confirming the scampster&#x27;s appearance at The Game Awards.
You can watch along with us tonight right here on Destructoid. The Game Awards 2022 kicks off at 17:00 PST / 20:00 ET / 01:00 BST, and promises an evening of live performances, awards ceremonies, and lots, and lots, and lots of advertising.

                              <span>A &quot;post-pandemic&quot; sequel to Five Dates.
Wales Interactive, known for its extensive work in the FMV genre, has announced Ten Dates, a sequel to the lockdown dating sim Five Dates, which was released back in November 2020.
Due for release on February 14th, 2023 (yep, Valentine&#x27;s Day), the game doubles the number of potential dating matches from its predecessor and stars two core protagonists, Misha and Ryan, who both attend a Speed Dating event in search of love. Obviously, the key difference here is that the game will feature in-person interactions in contrast to the previous title&#x27;s focus on webcam interactions.

                              <span>Taking the JRPG formula back to basics.
The Dragon Quest series is a staple in the JRPG community, continually churning out games of varying quality for more than 35 years. The latest entry in this seminal franchise is Dragon Quest Treasures, a spin-off from the mainline series, with many of the standard Dragon Quest tropes packaged into one of the most accessible JRPG experiences out there. While that translates into this game being a good starting point for fans new to the genre and the series, it won’t pose much of a challenge for seasoned treasure hunters.
Dragon Quest Treasures features a pair of familiar faces from the outset. Erik, who served as a party member in Dragon Quest XI, and his younger sister Mia toil away onboard a Viking ship searching for treasurers to plunder. Here is the first hint that this game is aimed at a younger audience, as the Vikings are presented as far more friendly and jolly than they were in Dragon Quest XI. Erik and Mia are aged down as well, with younger features and a more enthusiastic attitude befitting this cheerier adventure.

                              <span>There&#x27;s just no stopping them.
We&#x27;ve got the latest Japanese charts for you and it&#x27;s another strong week for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, with the latest generation bringing in another 310,235 sales, contributing to a running total of 3,424,806. This puts it just behind Splatoon 3&#x27;s current total of 3,446,339, though it&#x27;s probably safe to say that this has now been surpassed as of the time of writing.
There are only two new entries this week, including Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope and Yu-Gi-Oh! Rush Duel: Dawn of the Battle Royale!! Let&#x27;s Go! Go Rush!!, with the latter surely in the running for the most ridiculous game title of all time. Sparks of Hope saw decent sales to kickstart its tenure in Japan at 17,647.

                              <span>Big Fish.
Despite its title being ostensibly plucked from the 1983 Francis Ford Coppola movie of the same name, publisher Sammy’s The Rumble Fish series bears zero resemblance bar the odd bout of fisticuffs. Or, in this case, bout upon bout of fisticuffs, with a cast of colourful and interestingly designed characters.
The Rumble Fish series’ distinct hallmark is in its graphical style, once poised to catch the arcade goer’s eye and stir up interest in Sammy’s Atomiswave hardware. Rather than using standard hand-drawn sprites, it instead uses a routine where limbs are independently animated using sleek Flash-like animation. Although this gives the characters a certain marionette look, it’s a far cry from the likes of Earnest Evans, a Mega Drive and Mega-CD title that applied the same idea to unintended comical effect. Here, the Rumble Fish cast look great, blessed with a dreamy colour palette that really pops off the screen.

If you are even remotely interested in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, then you probably saw the whole heap of goodies that came our way yesterday in the ver. 2.2.0 update. Alongside the new tracks and item customisation tool, there were a couple of big in-game changes that have been somewhat pushed to the side.
One such change is all to do with the game&#x27;s infamous Lightning item and the effect (or lack thereof) that is has on your kart when gliding between platforms. While an unfortunately-timed strike used to see all those using gliders plummet to the ground below, the latest update no longer cancels your glider when hit.

When it comes to stone-cold classics like A Link to the Past, we have to ask how much content can there really be that we don&#x27;t already know about? The answer, so it seems, is quite a lot actually.
For the past little while now, a Zelda fan by the name of @Dark_Linkael has been working their way through the prototype data for this classic series entry and the project has thrown up a lot of interesting discoveries from original sprites to a collectable Triforce. But perhaps the biggest find (at least physically) has been their work on pulling together all of the game&#x27;s original interior room designs - dungeons and all.

The Game Awards has announced that Super Mario Bros. Movie voice actor Keegan-Michael Key will be making an appearance at the event on Thursday, December 8th.
The news, which comes via a Twitter post from The Game Awards, confirms the appearance of the actor alongside a partial image of his Super Mario Bros. Movie character, Toad, and a hashtag for the movie title. It&#x27;s unknown at this stage whether his appearance will come with some fresh footage of the new movie, but it&#x27;s certainly a possibility.

                              <span>An internal affair.
There have been enough Pokémon Scarlet and Violet glitches posted to the internet in the past few weeks to fill a Pokédex three times over. But no matter how hard we try to look away, another one comes along that we can&#x27;t help but go... &quot;what??&quot;
One such glitch was documented on a stream by @RyanWasTakenToo who, while on the hunt for some shiny &#x27;mon, came across one hiding in the most infuriating of places. With a pest control-level of searching required, it turns out that we all might have missed shinies in the walls.

Did You Know Gaming is apparently the latest victim of a &quot;Nintendo of America&quot; copyright takedown. According to the popular YouTube channel (best known for documenting long-lost video game history), its recent Heroes of Hyrule video received a copyright strike.

&quot;Nintendo has removed our Heroes of Hyrule video from YouTube. This was a journalistic video documenting a game that Retro Studios pitched to Nintendo nearly 20 years ago. This is an attempt by a large corporation to silence whatever journalism they don&#x27;t like, and a slap in the face for video game history preservation. We are exploring all available options to restore the video.&quot;

                              <span>The Ryzen 7 5800X3D is one of AMD&#x27;s fastest gaming CPUs - and the only one on that list that runs on cheap, widely available AM4 motherboards with better value DDR4 RAM. That&#x27;s probably why the 5800X3D is reportedly AMD&#x27;s most popular CPU by sales - and it&#x27;s also why this deal is coming to the fore. Right now, you can pick up this fast AF CPU for $300 thanks to an Ebay code (JOLLY15), a hefty reduction from its launch price of $450.

Also chickens! You can raise chickens now! They&#x27;ll give you eggs, which give you more chickens. There&#x27;s the real magic.

                              <span>The Crucial P5 Plus is one of those drives that turn up in these deals articles a lot. That&#x27;s because it&#x27;s designed to undercut the likes of the WD SN850, Seagate Firecuda 530 and Samsung 980 Pro, offering slightly slower sequential speeds at a lower price point. That tradeoff is one that I&#x27;d make in almost every situation, as you&#x27;ll definitely notice the extra money in your wallet more than you&#x27;ll notice a fractional difference in game load times!
The P5 Plus&#x27;s 1TB model is the one discounted today, with a drop to £90.86 - that&#x27;s the lowest price we&#x27;ve ever recorded for this model and a good value for a high-end SSD suitable for PC and PS5.

Chumps who want to fight alongside their summonable Spirit Ashes have to go to their own special colosseum, for nerds.

You can now once again scurry around underground death mazes in Rundown 2.0 Infection, the first Rundown shakeup added by developers 10 Chambers after the game&#x27;s March 2020 release. They plan to re-release all the others, too.
New Rundowns used to entirely replace GTFO&#x27;s levels every few months, but nowadays each new set is here to stay. How nice of the awful mutant zombie horrors to stick around.

                              <span>If you haven&#x27;t heard, Microsoft are currently trying to buy Activision Blizzard. Competition regulators from the UK, the EU and the US have been questioning the deal, so in an attempt to reassure them last month Microsoft apparently offered Sony a ten-year commitment to keep selling Call Of Duty on Playstation. Today, Xbox Head Phill Spencer announced that they&#x27;ve made a similar 10-year CoD commitment to Steam and, uh, Nintendo, on which no CoD games currently exist. 
Nintendo have signed, while Valve CEO Gabe Newell says his company won&#x27;t bother with a legal agreement, in part because they don&#x27;t believe in &quot;requiring any partner to have an agreement that locks them to shipping games on Steam into the distant future&quot;.

                              <span>2023 is shaping up to be a great time for wartime RTS games. If Men Of War 2 and Company Of Heroes 3 weren&#x27;t enough to keep you busy on the WW2 side of global historical conflicts, Petroglyph Games&#x27; The Great War: The Western Front will also be stepping into the trenches of WW1 at some point next year as well – literally, in this case, as planning, digging and capturing these muddy lines of defence will play a vital role in both its pre-combat Theatre Commander mode and busy real-time strategy battles. Recently, I got to play through one of its RTS battles, but what I found was a strategy game quite unlike its WW2 rivals. 
In some ways, this shouldn’t be surprising. As Petroglyph Games’ lead designer Chris Becker tells me over email, “WW1 is known for being a war of attrition and a battle of inches,” leading to fewer sweeping power plays when it comes to securing a victory. Indeed, your main concern here isn’t so much the winning of each individual battle, but maintaining your side’s National Will, which Becker says will be &quot;in constant fluctuation&quot; throughout the campaign – and with both the Allies and Central Powers to pick from here, that could mean very different things depending on who you choose. &quot;It’s essential that players continue to monitor this, as the relentless toll that the war will take on National Will can result in overall victory or defeat,&quot; says Becker. &quot;Authenticity is at the heart of this, we wanted to truly represent what &#x27;victory&#x27; meant in the war - even with success, there is cost.&quot;

                              <span>How the heck do you review Dwarf Fortress? Much like the procedurally generated world spat out at the start of every game, there’s already a huge pile of established lore and history out there from the 16 years it’s been around. It’s like being asked to review Lord of the Rings. It&#x27;s a vast undertaking, and there aren&#x27;t any friendly eagles on hand to cut through its dense mythos. Prior to releasing on Steam, I had put a few dozen hours into what is now known as Dwarf Fortress Classic (which is still available for free from Bay 12&#x27;s website), split over several different periods of time. Thing is, I never really got very far. I’d find a good tutorial, lose a few fortresses to horrible mistakes and then really get established. But then I’d be distracted by the realities of everyday life and by the time I got back to it, I’d forgotten everything and all my resources were hopelessly out of date because of all the wonderful, lovingly detailed updates. Then the cycle would start again. 

The good news is that this new version of Dwarf Fortress released on Steam does an admirable job of making the game considerably more approachable. I was apprehensive at first, but then something clicked and I lost the first of what would be many afternoons over the past fortnight, safe in the knowledge that when I eventually stepped away from this goliath, I’d be able to come back without feeling overwhelmed and have to start all over again. It’s still good ol’ Dwarf Fortress, but this is the most accessible the game has ever been while still being deep, demanding and a legend worthy of being inscribed on a mudstone goblet.

                              <span>Ixion starts by asking the question &quot;What if Homeworld was a management sim?&quot;. It then proceeds to answer that question in a comprehensive and convincing manner. Bulwark Studios&#x27; star hopping epic takes the operatic, elegiac grandeur of Relic&#x27;s RTS classic, but replaces the space battles with a chewy mixture of stellar logistics.
Also like Homeworld, it&#x27;s a darned stylish thing. The game commences with a spectacular intro cutscene wherein a futuristic space-shuttle launches from Earth, breaking through the atmosphere to dock with a gigantic, revolving space-station like a chromed hubcap off some petrolhead&#x27;s pride &amp; joy. The cutscene neatly transitions into the play-perspective, where you see that same shuttle slide into the docking bay from the cold void outside. Welcome to the Tiqqun, Administrator. Your long journey starts here.

                              <span>Earlier this year, I flew to Los Angeles to learn about the making of Mina The Hollower, Yacht Club Games’ new Game Boy Color-inspired follow-up to its wildly popular series, Shovel Knight. But Mina The Hollower was never meant to be the studio’s next game. It was a side project of Yacht Club Games designer Alec Faulkner - one that no one but him knew existed.
After raising over $1.2M on Kickstarter in February, I wanted to learn more about Alec’s journey from intern to game director, how he pitched his “Gothic Prototype” to the Yacht Club, and ultimately, how the team rallied behind him in hopes of delivering another series as prolific as Shovel Knight. The result is a 36-minute documentary covering the making of Mina The Hollower, which you can watch below.

Final Fantasy VII is experiencing a strange identity shift. The ongoing remake is changing the original canon in bold ways while spin-offs like the 2006 PlayStation 2 game Dirge of Cerberus are being folded in for larger roles in the main story. And then there are new spin-offs, like First Soldier, the online mobile battle royale shutting down early next year, and also plans for another remake called Ever Crisis, a mobile game that will reexamine Final Fantasy VII’s timeline. With all that swirling …</span>

                              <span>Update, 12/7/2022: Balan Wonderworld director Yuji Naka has been re-arrested on a second charge of insider trading, this time involving the mobile battle royale title Final Fantasy VII: The First Soldier. 
Last month, Naka and former Square Enix employee Taisuke Sazaki were arrested on suspicion of buying shares in developer Aiming after learning in advance about the team’s announcement of its mobile game Dragon Quest Tact (see the full original story below). Japanese outlet Asashi (thanks Video Games Chronicle) now reports that Naka and Sazaki are believed to have tried a similar scheme for the reveal of Final Fantasy VII: The First Soldier.
Ashai notes that in February 2021, developer Ateam and Square Enix announced a partnership to develop the mobile battle royale title. Naka and Sazaki…</span>

Xbox head Phil Spencer has repeatedly promised that the juggernaut franchise will still appear on its main rival’s platforms, but that hasn’t stopped Sony from touting the loss of the series as anti-competitive to stop the deal from going through. After saying he had no problem keeping Call of Duty on Sony hardware for the long term, Spencer has now extended and formalized that promise to Nintendo and Valve. 
Last night, Spencer announced on Twitter that Microsoft has entered a 10-year commitment to bring Call of Duty back to Nintendo. In a follow-up tweet, Spencer states the series will remain on Steam …</span>

The action has the ultimate goal of blocking access to a quartet of file-hosting platforms - Fembed, Uqload, Upvid, &amp; Uvideo. This is the first attempt to have so-called cyberlockers blocked in France but if successful, could undermine operations at dozens of other sites.

                              <span>Normally when we see discounted SSDs, it&#x27;s often on the cheapest models with loads of storage but the cheapest type of NAND flash, QLC, and with no DRAM caches. 
The Kioxia Exceria is one of those discounted SSDs, dropping to £55, but it&#x27;s actually a fairly high-end SSD with TLC NAND and a DRAM cache. This ensures that performance remains high even in scenarios where you&#x27;re writing data fairly continuously.

Bay 12 Games&#x27;s hugely ambitious colony sim, which is notionally a game about building a fortress for small, bearded humanoids, but is really an engine for generating elaborate fantasy histories and player-driven stories within them, has been in active development since 2003, with an initial launch in 2006. Since then, it has been continually developed by brothers Tarn and Zach Adams, who have added a truly wild amount of stuff over the last two decades. It&#x27;s also famously as impenetrable as its title suggests, mainly due to its ASCII visuals and unwieldy, keyboard-exclusive control scheme.

As part of that, the company is giving away one of its most notable games – Aliens versus Predator Classic 2000. This is the updated version of Rebellion&#x27;s best stab at AvP, which originally released in 1999, and was published by Fox Interactive.
You can grab the game by heading over to Rebellion&#x27;s storefront, where the offer is displayed proudly on the front page. There is a minor catch. You have to sign up to Rebellion&#x27;s newsletter, after which a Steam key for the game will be sent to you.

That&#x27;s probably why this ultra-premium option launched at an eye-watering $149.99 when it debuted three years ago. Now though, Amazon are offering the Viper Ultimate for its lowest ever price, just $59.99, fancy charging dock included. This is an awesome deal - and I&#x27;m not just saying that because I use this mouse every day (and have done for years).

                              <span>Dragon Quest Treasures is a prequel to Dragon Quest 11. It follows the exploits of Erik and his sister, Mia, well before they met up with The Luminary and follows them on their adventure to find treasure, escape vikings, and jump on top of the heads of monsters in order to reach higher platforms. Unlike Dragon Quest 11, Treasures is an action game with open environments and a focus on collecting valuables. It releases December 9 on Nintendo Switch and we will have a review for the game on gameinformer.com soon.

On June 27, 1972, Atari, as we know it today, was born. Well, technically, it was born a few months earlier under the name Syzygy Engineering, but the name Atari started life in 1972. I know this and many more interesting facts about the company because of Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration, Digital Eclipse&#x27;s love letter to the gaming giant.
Atari 50 is essentially a playable documentary, walking you through 50 years of Atari&#x27;s games, home consoles, handhelds, and PCs split into five different timelines. …</span>

                              <span>Hey Elden Ring fans, remember those colosseums you haven’t been able to enter since launch? Those doors finally open today, thanks to the arrival of a free PvP update.
Aptly dubbed Colosseum Update 1.08, the previously locked arenas in Limgrave, Caelid, and Leyndell become accessible, hosting competitive one-on-one duels, team battles, and free-for-all fights between players. It’s unclear what you’ll earn for winning other than personal glory, but it’s nice to see the fog finally lift on these mysterious locations. Check out the trailer below. 


This might be the start of a big week for Elden Ring, as it could walk away with the Game of the Year trophy during this week&#x27;s Game Awards. You can read our review of Elden Ring here.</span>

                              <span>Microsoft has announced that it’s raising the price of first-party Xbox Series X/S games to $70 beginning in 2023. 
IGN first confirmed the news, with a Microsoft spokesperson telling the outlet that &quot;This price reflects the content, scale, and technical complexity of these titles.&quot; First-party Xbox Series X/S games such as Starfield, Redfall, and Forza Motorsport will be among the first titles to have the $70 price tag when they arrive next year. The price of Xbox Game Pass appears unaffected, and the Microsoft spokesperson continued by saying, “As with all games developed by our teams at Xbox, they will also be available with Game Pass the same day they launch.” 
Given the increasingly exorbitant cost of triple-A game development, the price rise was only a matter of time. In an October live interview with The Wall Street Journal, Xbox head Phil Spencer said as much when he stated that the company couldn’t keep its products at the same price forever. &quot;I do think at some point we&#x27;ll have to raise the prices on certain things, but going into this holiday we thought it was important to maintain the prices.&quot; 
Sony was the first console maker to charge $70 for its PlayStation 5 first-party offerings at the start of this generation. In August, Sony raised the price of the PS5 itself in multiple international territories, citing inflation as the primary reason; Microsoft immediately responded by saying it had “no plans to raise the price of the Xbox Series X/S consoles.” Of course, that statement was made before Spencer’s comments to the WSJ, and Microsoft declined to comment when IGN asked about the potential of a hardware price raise.
As a reminder, the $70 tag only applies to current-gen titles. PS4 and Xbox One games have and will remain $60, the former standard established during the PS3/Xbox 360 generation.

The game was originally announced in 2020 (before Pentiment) and we took a look at it earlier this year. Now, however, we had a chance to go hands-on. Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard for a look at this unique game that is surprisingly reliant on the tactical power of farts.

OpenIndiana Hipster 2022.10 přináší zejména aktualizace mikrokódu CPU AMD i Intel, nejnovější změny v časových zónách, různá vylepšení pro BHyVe a interní SMB server. Celkově bylo začleněno dva a půl tisíce aktualizací kódu, nicméně i tak nadále platí, že vývoj OpenIndiany je ve srovnání s hektickou linuxovou lavinou spíše pozvolný.</span>

That means it produces little waste heat, and allows your laptop to stretch its legs in terms of battery life too. It&#x27;s normally over $200 for 2TB, but for Prime members it&#x27;s now available for $146 - an almighty deal for this drive.

Today is one of those days, as it turns out The Lord Of The Rings: The Return of The King was built using the modified engine of an undisclosed Tiger Woods title. 
&quot;Lord Of The Rings is about large areas, then a castle at the end or a fortress - what&#x27;s like that?&quot;, asks Callisto Protocol director Glen Schofield in the video below. &quot;Tiger Woods&quot;, he answers. 

Huh.

The Pokemon-like MMO&#x27;s 1.2 update introduces Showdown, a ranked competitive ladder where players are free to twiddle with their line-up using simulated Temtems. 
The update also tweaks how PvP ranking works, adds new PvP battle zones, and a beauty centre where you can tweak your character&#x27;s appearance. There&#x27;s a new season of cosmetic doodads, too.

                              <span>Season 2 of Overwatch 2 arrives tomorrow, and it&#x27;s a bigger deal than it may sound. Overwatch 2 may have marked the beginning of a slightly jarring shift towards the free-to-play model for Blizzard&#x27;s venerable hero shooter, but it&#x27;s the release of Season 2 where players will get their first taste of the pace and quality at which future content will be released under the new regime.
I got to spend a few days exploring the new changes that Overwatch 2&#x27;s second season will bring around this time tomorrow, and I&#x27;ve come away feeling a little torn. On the one hand, the brand new additions - the new Tank, Ramattra, and the new Shambali Monastery map - are gorgeous, intriguing, and enjoyable. On the other, the balance changes to existing heroes really don&#x27;t seem to have done much to rebalance the most overpowered heroes in the game, which has left me feeling a bit frustrated.

                              <span>Sad news, card pals: CD Project Red are pulling back from Gwent, with no new cards to be added after 2023. Beyond that the servers will stay online but the devs don&#x27;t intend to release updates themselves, instead handing responsibility for balance changes over to the community via in-game tools. 
Six years of active development seems like a pretty good run, to be fair.

BioWare have now revealed a sneak peek at an early cutscene, in which chirpy dwarf Varric muses about his old companion/possible ancient Elven god Solas. He&#x27;s the big bad, you see. The Dreadwolf himself.
BioWare have also released a few bits and bobs in celebration of Dragon Age day, including posters for upcoming Netflix show Dragon Age: Absolution, which is out on Friday. I hope it doesn&#x27;t do a Dota.

Delightfully, its soundtrack is built from loops tied to the animations of people doing things around the world: xylophone plings from little guys tossing coins into a fountain; drum beats from jesters dancing or goblins smashing dead gnomes; barbershop mutterings from pipe-smoking fishermen; long horns from passing ships; organ notes from giant seabirds stretching their necks; and so many more. A bit like Proteus meets Bernband and Alien Caseno with the added ability to make annoying noises by slamming on your lute.

                              <span>Microsoft&#x27;s proposed buyout of Activision-Blizzard is currently being scrutinized by competition regulators in various countries, but despite previous (and existing) objections the American Federal Trade Commision now looks likely to approve the deal. The news comes from the New York Post, who quote former FTC chairman William Kovacic as saying the deal is 70% likely to proceed. 
There&#x27;s a web of politics involved, but the short version is that insider sources say Microsoft have won over another member of the four person FTC panel, meaning any vote on whether to launch a lawsuit would result in an even split that would effectively OK the deal. That would reduce current FTC Chair Lina Khan&#x27;s authority over the body, so to avoid that she might just let Microsoft have at it.

I will report back. But there&#x27;s another issue that I was still working out my feelings about when I wrote the review, and is a complext thing to explain. It is this:
The Callisto Protocol wants you to learn and experiment with its systems, but it strongly disincentivises this at the same time.

                              <span>Playing Kynseed is kind of like being allowed too much freedom at the pick-n-mix. It’s not that all the separate parts go badly together, having chocolate jazzies and cola bottles all jumbled in together is exactly what I want. The problem is that it can’t possibly live up to what you hoped for when you’re scooping treats into that weighty paper bag. There’s a surprise chalkiness in the chocolates, some of the gummies are glued together, and in your haste, you’ve nabbed two lookalike sweets and mismanaged your expectations. At a glance, it’s precisely the rainbow-coloured jumble you wanted, but often it just leaves a bad taste in your mouth.
Kynseed is an RPG, and a life sim, and a sandbox. It is also Cooking Mama, and Moonlighter, and a dungeon crawler. It is gentle vibes ASMR relax-and-watch-the-seasons-change, and also crass and knowingly subversive. It does some of these things excellently, while other parts just don’t hold up.

                              <span>Palworld, AKA “That bizarre Pokémon-ish game with guns”, has a new trailer that puts names to the many cuddly faces that star in this over-the-top adventure.
Meet the Pal, the monsters that roam Palworld’s colorful yet kind of messed up world. These cuddly though often dangerous critters include the seemingly love-obsessed Lovander, grass panda Mossanda, and Tanzee, which is basically Grookey if it possessed a love for the AK-47. Sure, some of them boldly walk the line of being outright copies of existing Pokémon, but these can carry guns, which we imagine is enough of a separation to repel any lawyers. Check out the latest trailer below. 


Palworld first gained attention in June 2021. Developer Pocketpair bills the experience as a multiplayer open-world survival game as opposed to a turn-based RPG like Pokémon. As a human character, you can capture, befriend, train, battle, and breed Pal. If you consider yourself a bigger monster than what you&#x27;re catching, you even sell, eat, and outright exploit Pal for labor. On top of that, you can build houses, battle poachers, and construct factories to put your critters to work. Palworld looks nuts, and we&#x27;re still not entirely convinced it&#x27;s a real video game, but we certainly want it to be. 
Thankfully, Pocketpair plans to release Palworld in Steam Early Access sometime next year, so we&#x27;ll hopefully get a chance to try it out sooner than later. The game is currently slated for PC.</span>

                              <span>Since its reveal in 2016, Lost Soul Aside has been one of the most promising and mysterious projects on the horizon. Today, the upcoming action game made its first peep since its last showing in 2021, showing off its frenetic combat and stylish flair. 
Lost Soul Aside began life as a solo project by developer Yang Bing. Its 2016 proof-of-concept trailer impressed many with its triple-A caliber presentation and Devil May Cry-inspired action, including Sony, who scooped up the project as a third-party PS4 exclusive. Bing is now working with a full team, Ultizero Games. Sony announced last year that Lost Soul Aside will come to PS5 as well. The adventure stars protagonist Kazar and his shapeshifting dragon companion, who transforms into various weapons for Kazar to wield. 


Despite being officially announced for years, today’s video is billed as an “announcement trailer” presumably reintroducing the game to newcomers while reminding everyone else that it still, in fact, exists. The gameplay looks as polished as it ever has, though sadly, we still have no idea when we’ll get to play it. 
Lost Soul Aside will be available on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4. Be sure also to check out our related series on video games in development hell.</span>

Following the Fracture live event on December 3rd, the Herald and her chrome army obliterated The Island, sending chunks flying in all directions across space. Then, the island began repairing itself, forming an entirely new world filled with new locations, weapons, and mechanics. Blindly jumping into an all-new map can be a bit overwhelming, so here’s a list of every change introduced in Fortnite Chapter 4.
  



      
												
A New Island
Chapter 4’s most obvious change is the new map. Mainly split between an icy mountain, an autumnal forest, and a series of farmlands, this area has loads of secrets yet to be discovered. Players that log in now will have the opportunity to complete Explorer Quests, which allows them to get XP by visiting parts of the isl…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m a sucker for strategy games which boil their mechanics down until they almost become puzzle games, particularly if they also involve building rather than war. I&#x27;m thinking of games like Concrete Jungle, Slipways, Terra Nil and now, maybe, Farlanders.

That last game may be less familiar. Farlanders is a turn-based strategy game about terraforming Mars via building placement and adjacency bonuses, and it&#x27;s due for release next month.

                              <span>There are so many games released each year that I sometimes only notice a couple of years after the fact. Unfortunately that&#x27;s sometimes long enough for a game to be unreleased again. So it is with Fuser, Harmonix&#x27;s 2020 music game in which players create new works by mashing up other people&#x27;s songs. It&#x27;s being delisted from sale later this month and its &quot;live services&quot; are being switched off.

                              <span>With Cyber Monday behind us, it is now time for Christmastime. I mean, I did watch 25 Christmas movies in November. But now it&#x27;s super Christmastime. Top movie tips so far, by the way: The Noel Diary and Christmas Under Wraps. I just wish the Hallmark Channel&#x27;s rubbish UK service had all the new American movies—it doesn&#x27;t even have 2021&#x27;s yet! Anyway, what you playing this weekend? Here&#x27;s what we&#x27;re clicking on.

                              <span>Fortnite Chapter 3 has officially come to a close. 
Chapter 3 began last December and now, we officially know Chapter 4 begins tomorrow, December 4. Like with previous chapter launches, Chapter 4 brings with it an all-new map to play on that will be filled with new locations and returning favorites. There&#x27;s a glimpse of this new map at the end of the Chapter 4 &quot;A New Beginning&quot; trailer, which you can watch below: 


Here&#x27;s another look at the Chapter 4 map: 
Elsewhere in the trailer, you can catch a glimpse of new skins that will likely be in the Season 1 battle pass such as Geralt of Rivia from The Witcher series, the Incredible Hulk, the Doom Slayer from Doom, and even YouTuber Mr. Beast. 
Before all of that, though, players got the chance to experience the Chapter 3 &quot;Fracture&quot; finale event today at 4 p.m. ET (if you missed it, unfortunately you cannot go back to play it as of now). In it, we saw the battle island essentially implode with bits and pieces of it scattered across the stars. 
Players were tasked with collecting zero point fragments scattered about a small section of this map floating in space. The more players collected, the more pieces were added to the playable area. Players could complete quests such as throwing snowballs at enemies or bouncing players off into space as beach balls. You could also complete races, match island props, and more. Everything you did rewarded you with a zero point fragment. After about 30 to 40 minutes of this, the Chapter 4 trailer began. In it, we saw what appeared to be the creation of the Chapter 4 map, with the zero point dragging in pieces from space to create it. 

Fortnite Chapter 4 officially begins tomorrow, December 4, but a start time has not yet been revealed.

                              <span>HBO has released a new trailer for The Last of Us, its upcoming TV series based on the hit Naughty Dog game of the same name. And it looks awesome (and sad...very, very sad). 
The show&#x27;s first bit of footage was released back in August and slowly, HBO has been revealing more and more about The Last of Us. We&#x27;ve seen Pedro Pascal&#x27;s Joel and Bella Ramsey&#x27;s Ellie in previous footage, but today&#x27;s trailer gives us our longest look yet at the duo. Both continue to embody the spirit of Joel and Ellie in the games well and you can watch new footage of their scenes in the newest trailer below: 


As you can see, the trailer features a lot more of Joel and Ellie, but it also gives us new looks at clickers, a bloater, and possibly even David (although it could be someone else, like one of David&#x27;s henchmen). We also see Bill and Frank, and this trailer seems to tease that we&#x27;ll be getting a lot more of their relationship in the show than we did in the game. In a blink-and-you&#x27;ll-miss-it couple of moments, we even see Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson, who voiced Joel and Ellie in the games (shout-out to SlashFilm for catching that):

                              <span>Google have started issuing refunds for their recently canned game streaming service, Stadia. Those who&#x27;d bought any games, hardware or add-ons have already been told they&#x27;ll get their money back by January 18th, which is when the lights go out and all access to Stadia games shuts off.
The situation sucks for the Stadia team, and the numerous developers who were caught short by Google&#x27;s failure to communicate Stadia&#x27;s imminent demise. If you&#x27;ve spent the past three years mostly buying games through Stadia though then crikey, that&#x27;s a nice windfall.

                              <span>Within the joyful depths of tabletop board gaming lies a genre known as &#x27;take-that&#x27; style card games. They revolve around people pulling out cards that suddenly give them extra power or abilities, with counterplays almost entirely dependent on whether you happen to draw the right card in response. Munchkin is the king of these, at least in terms of popularity, having sent millions of players all over the world into dungeons where they competitively slay goofy horrors. 

I cannot stand it, but it is now on Steam in early access, and statistically speaking a lot of people will be very happy about that.

                              <span>If you want to get spooked in space, you&#x27;re probably best off avoiding The Callisto Protocol for now - unless you want to face the horror of stuttering framerates. Hordes of people on Steam are reporting the same issues that Alice Bee did in her review, plonking Callisto&#x27;s rating into Mostly Negative. Developers Striking Distance Studios have acknowledged the issue and say they&#x27;ll drop a patch later today to fix it, but we&#x27;ll see.
They&#x27;ve also revealed their post-launch roadmap, so hopefully it&#x27;ll run well enough by February for you to enjoy the New Game+ and Hardcore modes.

                              <span>Unlike buses, Valve games do not come in threes. That isn&#x27;t about to change anytime soon, but one of the main writers behind both Portal games has revealed that they&#x27;ve got a &quot;pretty awesome&quot; idea for Portal 3. Erik Wolpaw say he and fellow Portal 2 penner Jay Pinkerton have even floated that idea around Valve, to a positive response. It&#x27;s totes on the cards, is what it sounds like.  
The news comes from Wolpaw&#x27;s recent interview with YouTuber DidYouKnowGaming, which is also worth a watch to learn about all the ideas Valve didn&#x27;t wind up using in Portal 2. At one point it had bullet time.

Fortunately, a few of the little turn based tactics games I&#x27;d had on the backburner for a while was Immortal Tactics Colon War of the Eternals, an excellent little fantasy combat game set on miniature hex grids. On paper, it&#x27;s a stock fantasy game with a himbo, edgelord, and nerd fighting to kill monsters and unlock new characters. But what does paper know?

                              <span>Warhammer 40,000: Darktide launched on November 30th following several weeks of pre-order beta, but some players are already rather ticked off that the full-price game includes microtransactions. In particular, Darktide players are miffed that the co-op action game offers bundles of its Aquila premium currency that fall just short of the cost of some items in the store, meaning you’d have to stump up for several bundles to afford those. Taking to Darktide’s Discord to ask why you can’t just buy a specific amount of Aquilas for the items you want, one player was told by a spokesperson for Fatshark that adding such a feature would be “immeasurably complex”.

                              <span>I was dismissive of my first few games of Marvel Snap, intrigued by the next few, then hooked within ten. Second Dinner&#x27;s lightning-fast CCG manages to pack a surprising amount of nuance and strategy within six turns, while cleverly leaning on that brevity to play around with ideas that wouldn&#x27;t work elsewhere. It&#x27;s neat! And free! You should try it. 
All the more so, now that the latest update has added Collector Tokens that let you buy specific cards rather than leaving you solely at the mercy of booster packs. There are also 16 new cards, nerfs to some old ones, and a smattering of other improvements.

                              <span>Earlier this year, I flew to Los Angeles to learn about the making of Mina The Hollower, Yacht Club Games’ new Game Boy Color-inspired follow-up to Shovel Knight. Following the studio’s successful Kickstarter earlier this year, Game Informer sheds light on Mina The Hollower’s origins as developer Alec Faulkner’s side project, how he pitched the game to the Yacht Club, and ultimately, how the team hopes to deliver a game as prolific as Shovel Knight.

                              <span>Game developer Bungie is showing patience and determination in its pursuit of cheat creators and distributors. A lawsuit targeting people behind the &#x27;Wallhax&#x27; operation has already produced a $13.5m settlement  and in an amended complaint filed this week, Bungie identifies several people who previously enjoyed relative anonymity. It&#x27;s a chase that now spans three continents.

The company reiterates this stance after rival platforms Hellshare and Hellspy signed piracy filtering agreements with local rightsholders. According to Uloz, these measures will likely result in overblocking, something that should be avoided according to EU law.

                              <span>Bell, Rogers, and other copyright holders have obtained a new piracy-blocking order at Canada&#x27;s Federal Court. The &#x27;dynamic&#x27; injunction requires Internet providers to block access to unauthorized IPTV streams during the current NHL season. It&#x27;s the second order of its kind and, if effective, it won&#x27;t be the last either.

In brief emails to customers, Uploaded owner Cyando blames &quot;the situation&quot; for the site&#x27;s closure, but provides no other details. It seems likely that Uploaded is being pushed off a cliff before a quagmire of legal action suffocates it to death.

                              <span>Multiple beta releases often indicate lots of bugs to be fixed, but in this case we got carried away adding features and thought more testing was needed. New features since beta1 include: Variable interface scaling at whatever size you want (not just 2x and 4x), with optional chunky bevels for that retro feel. Multi-track level crossings to keep road vehicles from stopping in the middle of the crossing. A new Generate World menu which now includes NewGRF, AI, and Game Script configuration menus. Cargo filters for vehicle lists (such as at stations) to allow better visualization of traffic. Optional cargo names above vehicles in vehicle lists, to show at a glance what they carry. The ability to clone or share orders with vehicles grouped by shared orders. An improved local authority action window which now shows you actions you can’t afford, instead of hiding them. In addition, some new tools are available to AI and Game Script authors: Scriptable league tables which can replace the default scoring system AI and Game Scripts can now be modified in Scenario Editor for existing scenarios (although not savegames) (As ever, see the changelog for further details).
