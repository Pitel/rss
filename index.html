                    <span>V pátek 28. ledna začíná 14. ročník konference DevConf.CZ.  Jde o každoroční komunitní konferenci pro vývojáře, administrátory,  DevOps inženýry, testery, autory dokumentace a další přispěvatele či  uživatele technologií open source. Konference proběhne podruhé online, a  to v termínu 28. - 29. ledna.
Letošní program nabídne více než 100 přednášek v podání 150 přednášejících z celého  světa. Každý den se se můžete těšit na minimálně 6 souběžných streamů s  přednáškami, workshopy a meetupy. Kromě toho si pro vás organizátoři  připravili hromadu dalších interaktivních aktivit: protáhněte se během  online jógy nebo lekce tance; naučte se, jak správně připravit kávu  během živé ochutnávky pod vedením profesionálního baristy z pražírny Doubleshot; nebo se zapojte do simulované bezpečnostní výzvy Capture the Flag. Také pracujeme na vlastní 8-bitové mapě na platformě  WorkAdventure, která bude sloužit k socializaci s ostatními účastníky, přednášejícími a organizátory.
Na konferenci je potřeba se zaregistrovat: https://hopin.com/events/devconf-cz-2022</span>

These seemingly harmless bits are automatically targeted by the storage platform&#x27;s filtering algorithm, apparently for a terms of service violation. As if that&#x27;s not drastic enough, there is no option to challenge this arbitrary decision.

The ongoing lawsuit from the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) against the company is over reported toxic workplace culture. The bulk of the suit focuses on &quot;violations of the state&#x27;s civil rights and equal pay laws,&quot; specifically regarding the treatment of women and other marginalized groups. To learn more about the proceedings thus far, including details listed in the lawsuit against Activision Blizzard, please check out our previous coverage here.

Jack Garland and his conquest to destroy Chaos has had us talking since we learned of it last June. We&#x27;re less than two months from release, and after two betas and multiple trailers, I still don&#x27;t know what is going on in Stranger of Paradise Final Fantasy Origin.
There&#x27;s plenty of action shown off in the latest and apparently last trailer for the game, with Jack and Co. using various classes in battle to destroy hordes of enemies, including the multi-headed Tiamat, which apparently gets crystallized and shattered in the footage. We&#x27;re also introduced to more big baddies like Lich and Kraken and the Final Fantasy 1 boss known as Marilith brandishing some fiery blades. 
We catch glimpses at Jack dressed in regal garb, speaking with Sarah, and gifting her a pitch-black egg-like object, while promising not to forget. Memory is brought up a few times, with one early mention from Jack expressing the opinion that &quot;it&#x27;s a mercy to forget.&quot; The trailer clocks in at almost five minutes and goes all over the place. From dark castles to bright virtual-looking rooms, and camera sweeps over golden fields set to Frank Sinatra&#x27;s &quot;My Way&quot;. I never thought I&#x27;d be hearing Ol&#x27; Blue Eyes on a Final Fantasy soundtrack alongside Limp Bizkit, but here we are. 
Whether you like it or not, Stranger of Paradise Final Fantasy Origin is set for release on March 18 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.</span>

The game&#x27;s online functionalities will be inaccessible from 4:30pm to 9pm PT today, 25th January (that&#x27;s 7:30pm to midnight ET, and the following morning at 12:30am to 5am GMT). Nintendo notes that this is &quot;expected and standard&quot; maintenance, clearly intending to quell any thoughts that new content could be arriving in-game.

                    <span>&quot;we’ve talked about the possibility of working together&quot;.
We&#x27;ve heard previously how Goichi &#x27;Suda51&#x27; Suda is a Marvel fan and would &quot;love&quot; to work on one of the company&#x27;s video game projects, and it seems there have been some developments.
In a recent interview with Japanese publication Automaton, the director of No More Heroes III was asked about Grasshopper Manufacture&#x27;s plans for the next 10 years and revealed the studio had been in talks with Marvel.

It was discovered earlier this month that the upcoming Switch release Kirby and the Forgotten Land would support amiibo functionality, and now in an update, it seems reprints of existing Kirby amiibo have been confirmed.

It seems another digital game has gone missing - this time it&#x27;s the 2018 3DS eShop title, Dodge Club Pocket.
Not long after this was discovered, James Montagna - one of the individuals who worked on the series (who is also a director and game designer at WayForward), explained how the game had been delisted due to &quot;boring contractual paperwork stuff&quot; - rather than anything &quot;scandalous or exciting&quot;.

                    <span>&quot;emulation on the Switch is getting better&quot;.
Last week, Nintendo added Banjo-Kazooie to the Switch Online Expansion Pack tier. In addition to this, it seems N64 emulation has received an update - and one of the fixes spotted was tied to water and fog in The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time.
Game developer and YouTuber &#x27;MVG&#x27; has now taken a look in his latest video. Here&#x27;s his thoughts in brief:

                    <span>The Pokémon Company is now targeting leakers.
Well, it was bound to happen - after Pokémon Legends: Arceus was leaked, datamined and streamed last week, a handful of Pokémon-themed accounts on social media have now spent enough time playing the new entry to complete the entire game.
Nintendo and The Pokémon Company have apparently been going after these accounts and suspending them. While we can&#x27;t obviously share anything about the game just yet, here&#x27;s some of the dialogue from one of the accounts that have already finished Pokémon Legends: Arceus. Some of the more daring ones are even running &quot;Q&amp;As&quot;.

These impossible-to-reach areas that exist outside the borders of the map sometimes contain random items, like treasure chests that were likely forgotten or…

                    <span>Since its launch in November, much hooplah has been made about Halo Infinite’s customization options. Between the dearth of variety in free options (too many grays) and the sticker prices of paid options (too many $$$s), there’s a sense that looking great in 343 Industries’ popular multiplayer shooter costs money. But…

The Lantern Rite Festival is running again this year, which means that every player will be able to earn a free four-star character in the Fleeting Colors in Flight event.

                    <span>Clearly someone hasn’t learned about the Curse Of Wordle. A grade-A prick has created a Twitter bot that looks for those tweeting their score for that day’s word puzzle, and replies with a spoiler for the following day’s word. The bot’s goal, apparently, is “to terminate Wordle bragging.”

                    <span>Personal data and other records held by ISPs on their customers are highly sensitive and as such, can only be handed over to third parties when the law requires it. In movie piracy cases, judges often order this type of disclosure after consideration but in a new case involving CenturyLink customers, customer details could already be in the hands of some extremely litigious copyright holders.

The YouTube-rippers cited a letter where the EFF defends the non-infringing nature of the youtube-dl software. The RIAA, however, argues that this letter is irrelevant and suggests that the EFF is far from a neutral expert.

                    <span>Pokémon Legends: Arceus is out later this week, and in honor of its release, we&#x27;ve collected this list of Pokemon confirmed to be roaming the wilds in the Hisui region. This list does not include any leaked information and is based on Pokémon shown in official art, screenshots, or footage for Pokémon Legends: Arceus. However, there are quite a few Pokémon we can assume are in the game if their final evolution has been revealed or there is enough evidence for us to say we strongly think they will be included like the Sinnoh Gen 1 evolution cycle (Magmortar, Tangrowth, etc.). While we haven&#x27;t laid eyes on them, we&#x27;ve included their names along with an asterisk. We will try to update this list as more information becomes officially available.

                    <span>Behaviour Interactive has announced that in collaboration with Lionsgate Films, it is bringing more Saw content to the Dead by Daylight universe, including Jigsaw. 
This news comes by way of IGN, which revealed that Jigsaw will be featured in Dead by Daylight’s new Archives Tome 10: Saw event. This Tome will go live on all platforms where you can play Dead by Daylight on January 26. 
According to IGN, players will explore the memories of Amanda Young and Detective Tapp from Lionsgate’s Saw movies to unlock the “Book of Saw Collection.” Plus, players will be able to unlock new rewards in the form of outfits for Young and Tapp, and 60 new cosmetics for their own character. 
“Over and above our primary objective of providing our fans with fun and continuously renewed content, one of our goals when integrating a powerful movie franchise such as Saw is to invite a larger community into the Dead by Daylight universe,” director Mathieu Côté told IGN. “We’re truly grateful to our partner Lionsgate for offering us this opportunity.” 
What’s interesting about this is that Saw-related content has already been featured in the multiplayer horror game by way of the Pig killer. Perhaps this means Behaviour Interactive is going to double-dip into other horror franchises it’s collaborated with in the past. 
While waiting for Jigsaw to join the game on January 26, read about the most recent DLC, Portrait of a Murder, that hit Dead by Daylight back in November, and then check out the teaser for the upcoming chapter based on The Ring. Read our thoughts on the game in Game Informer’s Dead by Daylight review after that.

                    <span>Respawn Entertainment released another Apex Legends: Stories from the Outlands short today called Judgement, and it’s all about Mad Maggie, who also happens to be the new Legend joining the battle royale. 
The story begins with what appears to be a court case for Mad Maggie. Of course, she wasn’t really doing anything too wrong – she just did some things the Syndicate is not happy about, like getting food to the starving and more.

We then see Maggie outside, cuffed and surrounded by security. Seconds away from death by way of a firing squad, Maggie is spared by the Apex Games, which is where she’ll be competing as a form of punishment. Maggie is quite alright with this, though, and it’ll be up to players to determine how she plays in the battle royale. 
The official launch trailer for Mad Maggie and the Defiance season that kicks off with her joining the game will go live on January 27. Respawn also revealed a new limited-time mode called Control that will launch with the start of the Defiance season. 
“For the first three weeks of Defiance, see whether you can handle the madness in the new Control mode,” the Apex Legends website reads. “Select your loadout and drop into a 9v9 experience where teams battle to hold control points with infinite respawn.” 
We’ll learn more about Control and Mad Maggie later this week when the Defiance season trailer is released on January 27. While waiting for that, check out our thoughts on the game in Game Informer’s Apex Legends review and then find out why it’s on our list of the top 10 shooters to play right now. Be sure to watch this Apex Legends Bangalore short after that.

                    <span>A Memoir Blue seized our attention during last summer’s Annapurna Showcase thanks to its dazzling visuals and emotional storytelling. Today, we found out that March 24 will be the day we can dive into this surreal aquatic adventure. 
The game stars Miriam, a champion swimmer who embarks on a dream-like journey through her rocky childhood, reflecting on her complicated relationship with her mother. Developer Cloisters Interactive bills A Memoir Blue as an interactive poem that unfolds through a series of vignettes that come to life through a blend of traditional 3D art and 2D animated visuals. It’s one of those games that’s best seen in motion, which you can do by watching the latest trailer below.

A Memoir Blue will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. It’s also coming to Xbox Game Pass.</span>

                    <span>Skydance Interactive has announced The Walking Dead: Saints &amp; Sinners – Chapter 2: Retribution, the sequel to the 2020 VR game. 
The game’s reveal came via a small teaser video of the logo on Twitter. Skydance states that Retribution is a full-fledged sequel that continues the story of the Tourist from the first game. However, Skydance also bills this as a standalone tale that newcomers can jump right into. Unfortunately, no gameplay details, release window, or platforms are known at this time.
It wouldn’t be our second anniversary without a surprise. Hold on to your heads, tourists, The Walking Dead: Saints &amp; Sinners - Chapter 2: Retribution is coming. 😈 #TWDSS #secondanniversary #Chapter2 #Retribution pic.twitter.com/ajibDagmKP
January 24, 2022
The Walking Dead: Saints &amp; Sinners unfolds in a zombie-infected New Orleans. Players control the Tourist, who must fight their way through hordes of undead to reach a military bunker. Gameplay blends action and survival elements and the narrative can change gears depending on your choices. We recently included it on our list of the Top 10 Meta Quest games you should play right now. Last fall, it received the free Aftershocks content update that added new story missions and other goodies.

                    <span>Watch Dogs: Legion has seen its fair share of content rollouts. From an Aiden Pearce-focused DLC expansion to a zombie-based “Legion of the Dead” game mode, Ubisoft’s experimental player-controls-all adventure romp has seen a steady influx of exciting modes and missions since its Fall 2020 launch. However, a recent blog post on the official Ubisoft website has announced that there will be no more content updates. Additionally, the development team penned a thank you letter to the DedSec operatives around the world that continue to roam London&#x27;s sleek, futuristic streets.
The letter opens with the designers reminiscing about the Watch Dogs: Legion content roadmap, highlighting the inclusion of multiplayer modes like Tactical Ops and the Spiderbot PvP arena as well as a bevy of new characters like Mina, Helen, and Darcy. Quality of life improvements also made the gameplay more streamlined and accessible for new and veteran players. Ultimately, the developers were proud of their accomplishments and the positive reception from fans. 
The 5.6 update that dropped last Fall is the last of its kind as Watch Dogs: Legion begins to transition to a Season cycle:
“...you can look forward to reward tracks in the Online Mode, containing both new and returning rewards. The current season 4 Rebels track, containing 80 ranks, will run until January 22, 2022, followed by Season 5 Stripes. After that, Seasons 3-5 will continue to cycle and return to the game, giving you the opportunity to acquire rewards you might have missed out on in the past. Some rewards to look forward to is a modified version of Aiden Pearce&#x27;s jacket, and Jackson&#x27;s mask and clothing set.”
The team ended the note directly referencing players and their past (and future) contributions to Legion: “We couldn&#x27;t be prouder of the game we&#x27;ve created, and we appreciate all of you who&#x27;ve joined us on this journey in London over the year.”

                    <span>Ubisoft’s Rabbids franchise essentially serves as the publisher’s version of Illumination&#x27;s Minions. The weird bunnies are equal parts cute and zany and have a tendency to screw up everything they touch, despite their best intentions. Now they have a chance to take their antics off-world in a new animated film coming to Netflix next month. 
Rabbids Invasion: Mission to Mars is a new movie that stars Beardie, a misunderstood Rabbid possessing genius intellect who dreams of traveling to Mars. Thankfully, his smarts land him a seat aboard a mission to Mars. The bad news: his sillier brethren also tag along. But when a sinister plot causes the mission to go awry, leading to the Rabbids being stranded on the red planet, Beardie will have to rely on his wits, his fellow Rabbids, and even aliens to save the day.

If the trailer looks like a good time for you and/or a tyke, look for Rabbids Invasion: Mission to Mars to hit Netflix on February 18. If Rabbids aren’t your thing, it’s far from the only video game property getting a Netflix series. In fact, The Cuphead Show premieres the same day as Rabbids Invasion and plenty of other video game series await on the horizon. Those who prefer to enjoy their Rabbids in games can look forward to Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope coming to Switch sometime this year.</span>

                    <span>Platinum Games, the studio behind Nier Automata and Astral Chain, revealed back in August that it was resurrecting a 30-year-old series with Sol Cresta. It was initially set to release back in December, but in November, Platinum’s chief game designer, Hideki Kamiya, revealed in a “Very Sorry Stream” that Sol Cresta had been delayed. At the time, a new release date was not announced, but now we know when we’ll be able to play this arcade-style shoot-em-up: February 22. 
Platinum confirmed the new release date in a “Sol Cresta Release Date Forum Live Stream” held over this past weekend, as reported by Eurogamer. Platinum said Sol Cresta will hit PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC next month on February 22. The game is priced at $40. 
When Sol Cresta was announced last year, it was revealed to be a successor to Moon Cresta and Terra Cresta, both vertical-scrolling arcade games developed by Nichibutsu. Like previous Cresta games, Sol Cresta will feature spaceships flying through galaxies, taking out enemies, and more classic, vertical-shooter arcade fashion. Like the original games allowed players to do nearly 40 years ago, Sol Cresta will enable players to to dock with allies. 
When Sol Cresta was first unveiled, Kamiya said, “we want to make all kinds of games…not just action games.” Kamiya likely said this because Platinum is best known for its action titles like Nier Automata, Astral Chain, and Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance, to name a few, but it seems the studio is using Sol Cresta to prove it can do other genres, like vertical shooters, too. 
Sol Cresta will hit PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC on February 22, 2022, and it will cost $40.

                    <span>Yakuza creator Toshihiro Nagoshi announced last October that he was departing from Sega, and today, his new NetEase studio, aptly called Nagoshi Studio, has been revealed. 
Twitter user Nibellion (perhaps more well-known as Nibel) posted a link to the Nagoshi Studio website, where they learned that Nagoshi is its CEO. It’s also where Nibel discovered that eight of the founding Nagoshi Studio members previously worked at Sega or Yakuza developer Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio. This is where Nagoshi previously worked before taking an executive role within Sega. 
Nibel notes that in an interview with Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu, Nagoshi explains that he left Sega because he didn’t want to do the same thing repeatedly. At NetEase, there are fewer creative constraints on him. Plus, it allows him to be closer to actual game development again. 
In that same interview, Nagoshi said the studio hopes to announce its first game as soon as possible and that said game will have a “large” scale. The CEO also says the studio is focused on quality and appealing to both core fans and a larger audience while doing things he and the other developers there couldn’t do before (perhaps at RGG or Sega).
While waiting to learn more about Nagoshi Studio’s first title, read about how RGG has confirmed that a sequel to Yakuza: Like A Dragon is in the works, and then check out this interview with Nagoshi, where he reveals why Sega should have fired him in the 1990s. Read about why one Game Informer editor believes you should play more Yakuza right now after that.

                    <span>Dark Souls 3 might not have garnered the same popularity totals as its two predecessors or the GOTY spin-off(s) that followed. Nevertheless, it showcases the same level of epic storytelling and mechanical depth and polish that FromSoftware is widely known for. Unfortunately, a dangerous exploit is making the rounds, leading to players losing complete control of their PCs. As of right now, the Dark Souls 3 servers are offline as the dev team works to maintain multiplayer security. 
PvP servers for Dark Souls 3, Dark Souls 2, and Dark Souls: Remastered have been temporarily deactivated to allow the team to investigate recent reports of an issue with online services.

                    <span>The coffee is NOT too hot.
Brewster, Animal Crossing: New Horizons&#x27; resident coffee pigeon, is a man bird of very specific tastes. And if you insult those tastes... by refusing to drink your coffee at the correct temperature, or turning down his generous offer of pigeon milk... well, you might just get what&#x27;s coming to you.
In Evil Imp&#x27;s impeccably directed trailer for a movie which (sadly) does not exist, Brewster hunts down the ungrateful villager who snubbed him and his barista knowledge, with the help of his Brewster-shaped Gyroids.

You can&#x27;t keep the Game Boy down, with the humble handheld still getting used for various projects while its game library also grows. A small number of dedicated developers and publishers embrace the challenge of working with the system, and now you can sample one particular upcoming release - The Machine.
Announced last year, it&#x27;s a dystopian tale in which an early aptitude test determines your fate and career prospects, kind of like the 11+ test in some British schools but turned up to... well, 11.

Bad news for those hoping to weep their way through February: The Annapurna-published tear-jerker that was due to come out on February 10th, A Memoir Blue, has been pushed back to March 24th. Although, you could cry about the delay instead, maybe?
A Memoir Blue is an &quot;interactive poem&quot; that tells the story of a champion swimmer reminiscing about her complicated relationship with her mother, as seen through vignettes about her life and her feelings.

In an exclusive interview with VGC, the developers — a group calling themselves &quot;Harbour Masters&quot; — spoke about their efforts to re-release the game on PC in February:

                    <span>It&#x27;s not quite 4K, though.
We&#x27;ve seen the Game Boy do some pretty incredible things at the hands of creative fans in the past – remember that time someone managed to photograph the moon using the Game Boy Camera? – but we never thought we&#x27;d see one being used to play Grand Theft Auto V. Actually, who are we kidding, GTA V&#x27;s on so many platforms at this point it was bound to happen eventually.
Anyway, this seemingly impossible turn of events is all thanks to the hard work of Sebastian Staacks, who&#x27;s managed to create a WiFi Game Boy cartridge. The device originally allowed Sebastian to use an unoriginal, unmodified Game Boy to view and send text messages and access a custom version of Wikipedia, but it&#x27;s evolved quite dramatically since then.

Here&#x27;s some news: We are not infallible human beings here at Nintendo Life. Hard to believe, but true.
We don&#x27;t all sit on a throne of priceless Spice Orange GameCubes and rare SNES games, although a fair few of us have been known to collect a few odd trinkets here and there. But life wasn&#x27;t always mint-in-box... In fact, we&#x27;ve all had our share of mistakes and woes that we look back on with shame and sorrow. Sometimes, we miss out on great deals, lend a prized gaming possession to a less-than-trustworthy pal, or sell a game that would later become priceless (monetarily, or emotionally). These are the stories that keep us up at night.

The game&#x27;s had a great start to 2022 in the UK, only losing out on that number one spot once so far when Minecraft took the honours last week. Minecraft&#x27;s down to sixth this time around, with titles like Animal Crossing: New Horizons climbing up the pecking order in its place.

                    <span>Nintendo DS + heavy metal fans + open mic &#x3D; amusing results.
Nintendo has always has a reputation of being a family-friendly brand, right from the days of the NES when the firm would painstakingly censor many of its games to ensure there was zero chance of them causing offence. While the company&#x27;s stance arguably softened during the GameCube years, by the time the DS came along, Nintendo was ready to enter a new period of family-friendly marketing – and the results speak for themselves, with the DS selling over 150 million units worldwide.
However, Slopes Game Room has unearthed one piece of promotion from this period which was unashamedly mature in tone and very much at odds with Nintendo&#x27;s typical stance. At the UK&#x27;s &#x27;Download&#x27; heavy metal festival in 2005 – which showcased acts such as Black Sabbath, My Chemical Romance, Billy Idol, Motörhead, Slipknot and Megadeth – Nintendo erected a tent as part of its &#x27;Touch Me&#x27; Tour to promote the touchscreen-ready DS console.

                    <span>Campaign expansion and new weapons added.
Severed Steel is an FPS that has garnered plenty of positive user reviews on Steam since its release last year, and is eye catching with its use of destructible environments and stunt-driven play. It continues to get major updates ahead of a release on consoles - including Switch - later this year, which bodes well as it adds more refinements and content.
Version 3.0 is focused on the campaign, adding new levels and weapons. There&#x27;s also a lot of balancing tweaks as the developers respond to feedback, along with further improvements to the game&#x27;s level editor. Another update planned for March will add the ability for players to create campaigns in the level editor, though time will tell whether this set of user-generation features makes it to the console versions.

                    <span>Monsters and skeletons and traps, oh my!
RedDeer.Games has announced its upcoming retro effort, Swords &amp; Bones, will make its way onto Nintendo Switch - although no firm release date has been set as of yet.
The game, which is very obviously inspired by &#x27;80s and &#x27;90s classics such as Ghosts &#x27;n Goblins, sees you battle demon hordes across some quite lovely looking old-school environments in what the dev describes as an &quot;epic adventure&quot;.

Atari has announced that Breakout: Recharged will be blasting onto the Switch eShop on 10th February.
A modern take on the &#x27;70s arcade classic, Breakout: Recharged has players smashing their way through each neon-coloured brick across a variety of modes. An Endless option will put you through your paces, while Challenge mode will have you taking part in 50 increasingly challenging levels – oh, and you can even jump into a local co-op mode, too.

                    <span>Here comes the judgement.
M-KAI began his game development life on the MSX with RPG Izumic Ballade, before moving into the shoot-em-up arena with Kanzen Kouryaku Kyokugen and Pleasure Hearts. The distinct design hallmarks of these early works — leaning toward lightweight, unpretentious fun — have remained present throughout his commitment to the genre.
Qute Corporation released the Wonderwitch in 2000, a game development device for Bandai’s Japan-only WonderSwan handheld. To encourage sales, a software coding competition was held with a 500,000 Yen cash prize and the promise of a commercially published game. M-KAI’s Judgement Silversword — a vertical scrolling shoot-em-up — took the crown, thus beginning a long-term collaboration with Qute to produce his future games.

                    <span>...but it paved the way to the inclusion of the original Metroid.
A few years back, it was reported that Super Metroid almost made it into Metroid Prime but Nintendo decided against it because the emulator used was an unofficial third-party one.
In a conversation with Kiwi Talkz, Metroid Prime developer David Kirsch – AKA Zoid – has confirmed that this rumour is actually true. Kirsch reveals that he only actually played Super Metroid after being assigned to Metroid Prime, but loved it so much he completed it twice in 3 days.

As had been suspected following his departure from Sega last year, Super Monkey Ball and Yakuza creator Toshihiro Nagoshi has teamed up with Chinese gaming giant NetEase to form a brand new development studio.
NetEase has today announced the establishment of Nagoshi Studio Inc., where Nagoshi himself will take on the role of Representative Director and CEO. He&#x27;s joined by eight other ex-members of Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio: Daisuke Sato (producer), Kazuki Hosokawa (artist), Koji Tokieda (programmer), Masao Shirosaki (game designer), Mitsunori Fujimoto (engineer), Naoki Someya (artist), Taichi Ushioda (director), and Toshihiro Ando (artist).

Ubisoft has announced that those pesky Rabbids will soon be hitting the big screen in Rabbids Invasion: Mission To Mars, a new animation headed to Netflix.
The film, which will be roughly one hour and ten minutes long, sees a group of Rabbids setting off on a madcap mission to Mars – except, as you can probably imagine, everything goes wrong. Make sure to catch the trailer (up above) and read up on what you can expect to see:

                    <span>There were a lot of games I played last year that could have been on our Best Games You Missed list at the end of 2021. I ended up going with Studio Pixel Punk&#x27;s Unsighted in the end, but it was very nearly OPUS: Echo Of Starsong, a stunning visual novel adventure game from Taiwanese studio Sigono Inc. I&#x27;d seen a few other games journalists raving about it when it came out on Steam last September, and hey, over 3000 overwhelmingly positive Steam reviews can&#x27;t be wrong either, so I took the plunge, and golly, it sure is something special.

                    <span>As if Dark Souls wasn&#x27;t dangerous enough already, Bandai Namco have temporarily taken every Dark Souls PC server offline following the discovery of a Dark Souls 3 security vulnerability that could harm anyone playing in online mode. A malevolent string of code threatens the many kingdoms of ash, so to speak.

                    <span>With quality assurance workers at Raven Software preparing to unionise, the Activision Blizzard staff who have gone on strike to help secure better treatment for the team are looking to end the strike. The strike started on December 9th following surprise layoffs at the Call Of Duty: Warzone studio&#x27;s QA department, with some other teams and Actiblizz people supporting them. Unused cash raised for a strike fund will be saved for future efforts.

                    <span>Codemasters’ Grid series continues its resurgence after 2019’s decent-but-slightly-neutered reboot. This time, it’s going right back to Codemasters&#x27; TOCA Race Driver roots and adding in a full-fat story mode, complete with real actors. No Scotty, mind, but we suppose they have to save something for the sequel. It’s this story mode we’ve been given early access to, so let’s jump in.

                    <span>Andorra Telecom, the only Internet service provider in the tiny European principality, has suffered a series of cyber attacks disrupting Internet access nationwide—and supposedly it&#x27;s all over a Minecraft tournament. The Twitch Rivals tournament SquidCraft Games over the weekend included a number of players in Andorra, several of whom dropped out after their connections exploded. Trying to blast a whole country offline to ruin a Minecraft tournament sounds like the setup for a bad YA metaverse novel but may be a terrible vision of our future.

Now we know for sure it&#x27;s real. Nagoshi Studio has officially launched and they&#x27;ve already begun work on their first game.

Here in the UK it’s only the RTX 3070 Ti Founders Edition that’s seen a hike, from £529 up to £549, but over in the lands of the Euro these graphics cards will set buyers back up to €100 more than before. That’s for the RTX 3090 FE, which now sits at a widowmaking €1,649, while the rest of the range has gained between €20 and €60 in wallet weight.

Zakladatel Armbianu Igor Pečovnik se totiž opakovaně v minulosti negativně vyjadřoval o možné podpoře Armbianu pro Raspberry Pi hlavně kvůli uzavřenosti bootloaderu.</span>

                    <span>Half-Life: Alyx is great. One of the best virtual reality games I’ve ever played and one of my favorite games of 2020. Hard to improve on that. Yet, a new let’s play series has found one way to make Valve’s VR hit even better: Add a really weird and annoying self-aware gnome to the adventure.

                    <span>Back in 2001, one of the key creators behind the original Xbox console, Seamus Blackley, compared gaming to masturbating. Apparently, this didn’t go over well with Bill Gates and other high-ranking Microsoft execs. According to Blackley, he nearly got fired for the quote.

                    <span>A 58-year-old man has been ordered to pay four Swedish TV companies more than $164,000 in damages after being found guilty of selling illegal IPTV service subscriptions. He claimed that a third party was responsible for the sales but a local court found him guilty of copyright infringement offenses, also handing down a four-month suspended prison sentence.

                    <span>After tackling Metroid in Season 1, the second season of Game Informer&#x27;s Video Gameography podcast moves on to one of the biggest shooter franchises in existence: Halo. This week, we examine 343 Industries&#x27; first stab at the series with Halo 4.
Halo 4 was released on the Xbox 360 on November 6, 2012, and was a big return for Master Chief, who hadn&#x27;t been seen since 2007&#x27;s Halo 3. Development of the game wasn&#x27;t perfectly smooth as Ryan Payton, of Metal Gear Solid 4 fame, initially pushed the team to experiment with Halo&#x27;s sandbox. However, the game was still a massive hit. Join us as we talk about Halo 4&#x27;s powerful story, the new Prometheans enemy types, Halo&#x27;s obsession with the number seven, and what made the Spartan Ops multiplayer mode so disappointing.  
Join hosts Ben Reeves (@BenjaminReeves) and Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7) and IGN executive editor Ryan McCaffrey (@DMC_Ryan) as we unpack the history and impact of the first Halo game from 343 Industries. And for more Halo, be sure to check out our definitive ranking of every Halo game.

                    <span>I mostly associate Yu-Gi-Oh! with its manga and anime and all its hairstyles you could cut your hand on. It&#x27;s also, of course, an enormously popular trading card game, and its latest digital iteration, Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel, came to Steam this past week. It&#x27;s currently the fourth most popular game on the platform by concurrent players.

                    <span>Hitman 1-3 is a fantastic trilogy and, also, a curse upon digital storefronts. Hitman 3 frustrated players when it first launched on Epic, because their progress didn&#x27;t carry over; Hitman 1 frustrated players on GOG last year because its internet requirements constitute DRM; and now Hitman 3 is back at it again on Steam. It currently has &quot;Mixed&quot; reviews after arriving on the platform earlier this week, with players cross about its price, its umpteen editions, and - yes, again - progress not carrying over for some.

                    <span>Blizzard Entertainment head Mike Ybarra says their top priority is to &quot;rebuild your trust in Blizzard.&quot; In a new blog post, Ybarra outlines the steps the company is taking, including new senior positions dedicated to improving their culture.

These moves come in the wake of several lawsuits alleging a culture of harassment and discrimination within the company. The post announcing the plans also comes days after Microsoft announced their intent to buy Activision Blizzard.

Palworld has now returned with a second trailer, which continues in kind. The pals are again seen crafting machineguns in a sweatshop - but also crafting space rockets, being strapped to beds in nightmare hospitals, and dragged while tethered to the backs of moving trucks.

Microsoft buying Activision Blizzard for $69 billion is so weird that it&#x27;s easy to lose your head and forget to say &quot;Nice.&quot; Alice Bee has considered some of the implications while I&#x27;m also groaning hard about nostalgic navel-gazing reviving old Activision series. But it was nice to close out the week with news that Raven QA are unionising. Sheesh! Settle down, Actiblizz. Tell me gang, what are you playing this weekend?

                    <span>Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga got an April 5 release date this week after spending years in development limbo. For a while, it seemed like the project was in peril, and, according to a new report by Polygon, those fears appear to have merit. The outlet talked to 30 current and former employees of TT Games (speaking anonymously out of fear of retaliation) who revealed TT’s lifetime history of crunch, a negative workplace atmosphere, and how The Skywalker Saga’s development suffered from it. 
The report highlights that after TT struck gold with its early Lego titles during the mid-2000s, it became a victim of its own success. The studio’s annual release cadence meant that overtime and crunch became not only normal but expected. Polygon’s sources described instances of studio leadership …</span>

Windjammers 2 gives fans of the popular arcade game exactly what they want: more Windjammers. Outside of a sharp graphical facelift and some new competitors and arenas, don’t expect to find much to gnaw on after you’ve batted around the disc a few times. The sport remains a reflex-demanding delight, but the fun wanes after a few rounds on the court. 
Windjammers pits two players against each other in an over-the-top frisbee version of air hockey. You shoot the disc at each other, attempting to nail it through the goal on your opponent’s side; you can also earn points if the disc touches…</span>

                    <span>Resident Evil is a classic video game franchise that’s been around for decades. And for good reason, too – whether you prefer the more hardened survival horror seen in the first few Resident Evil games (and the recent ones) or the more over-the-top action camp seen in later entries, the series has you covered. That’s probably what makes it such a beloved series: there’s a little something for everyone in it. 
You might be wondering what has us pondering the Resident Evil series today. Well, 24 years ago, Resident Evil 2 hit PlayStation 1 on January 21, 1998. You read that right: the classic Resident Evil 2 is 24 years old! One year short of being old enough to rent a car!
Happy 24th anniversary to Resident Evil 2, that shambled its way onto PlayStation 1 in January 21st, 1998.

                    <span>Talk of NFTs, blockchain gaming, and play-to-earn models seem nigh unescapable these days, but it seems developers are still largely against them. 
That’s because in a newly-released 2022 State of the Industry report from the Game Developers Conference (GDC), 70% of developers surveyed said they and their studio are not interested in NFTs. Seventy-two percent of those that answered said they and their studio aren’t interested in cryptocurrencies either, which are often used to purchase NFTs. 
However 28% said they “are at least somewhat interested in cryptocurrency at their studio and 28% are at least somewhat interested in NFTs.” Only 1% of those surveyed said that their studio already uses cryptocurrency or NFTs in their development and game models. None of this is especially surprising,…</span>

Announced in a press release, this union is called the Game Workers Alliance Union and is a part of the larger Communications Workers of America collective. This new union is asking Activision Blizzard, which will be acquired by Microsoft by the end of fiscal year 2023, to voluntarily recognize the union without hesitation.

                    <span>Techland has released a new trailer detailing the gameplay modes in the PlayStation 5 version of Dying Light 2 Stay Human. 
As is usual for PS5 games as of late, there are three modes: performance, quality, and resolution. Each option gives players a different type of game presentation, but all three look great based on the trailer released today.

The Quality Mode with Ray Tracing, as it’s called, gives you exactly what you’d expect in that it’s a high-resolution mode that prioritizes Ray Tracing capabilities over performance. While there’s no official word, this mode looks 60 FPS to us, or at least higher than 30 FPS. 
As the name implies, the Resolution mode maintains 4K visuals above all else. It’s the most visually stunning mode based on the traile…</span>

                    <span>A not-so-long time ago in the same galaxy we all reside in, Respawn Entertainment deviated from its first-person shooter roots to create Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. This third-person action game was the studio’s first stab at tackling the coveted Star Wars license, crafting an original adventure set five years after Revenge of the Sith. It stars Cal Kestis, a padawan turned junker (played by Shameless star Cameron Monaghan) that managed to evade the Jedi purge of Order 66. After he’s outed by the Sith, he embarks on a quest to recover an artifact capable of locating force-sensitive children while also avoiding capture by the Inquisitors, who are elite Jedi hunters. 
The game features a blend of lightsaber combat and a suite of Force abilities. Borrowing inspiration from FromSoftware’s Soul series, encounters are challenging, requiring a strategic blend of blocks and parries to outduel opponents. Meanwhile, the various planets take on a Metroid-inspired progression with players unlocking abilities to backtrack to previously inaccessible areas.

Fallen Order was released November 15, 2019, and was a critical and financial success. It also served as a saving grace for single-player fans, providing proof to an increasingly multiplayer-focused EA that linear story-driven experiences can still make the big bucks. With a sequel reportedly in the works, we’re revisiting this gem of the Star Wars video game pantheon. 
Join Marcus Stewart, Daniel Tack, and Andrew Reiner on Twitch today at 2 p.m. Central as we journey through the entirety of Cal Kestis’ adventure.

                    <span>As we slowly near the November 11 release date of Starfield, we are just as slowly learning more and more about the upcoming Bethesda RPG. While we still haven’t received much by way of concrete info or even a look at gameplay or in-game imagery, the team behind the game has released a handful of concept art introducing us to locations we’ll all be visiting.
This includes New Atlantis, the United Colonies capital showcased in a developer commentary video released last August. You can watch that here, but today, the official Starfield Twitter account released an in-motion concept art (concept video?) of New Atlantis, and it looks great. 
Welcome to New Atlantis, capital of the United Colonies.https://t.co/7NH12Dr4y9 pic.twitter.com/SK91SEZBGe
January 20, 2022
As you can see above, it very much still resembles the concept art imagery we’ve seen in the past, but it features a little bit of motion with a ship soaring through, some birds slowly flying by, and more. We can see a planet or a large moon up in the sky, and as for New Atlantis, it looks like a sci-fi metropolis complete with plenty of grays, yellows, and red. It’s also seemingly surrounded by some jagged, upward-facing cliffs. 
Here’s what Bethesda said about New Atlantis back in August: “The United Colonies capital city, New Atlantis; the pleasure city of Neon; and the capital of the Freestar Collective, Akila.” 
For more about Starfield, take a look at this behind-the-scenes trailer for it, and then check out this trailer that details bloody wars, violent space pirates, and more. Read about how The Elder Scrolls 6 will use Starfield’s Creation Engine 2 after that.

                    <span>Ken Kutaragi, the inventor of the PlayStation and former CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment, recently spoke to Bloomberg and gave his opinion on the metaverse, the nebulous virtual world concept that has several tech companies embroiled in an arms race to capitalize on it first. While industry giants such as Facebook and Microsoft have visions for what the metaverse can/will be, Kutaragi doesn’t subscribe to the concept.
Kutaragi believes staying rooted in the real world is “very important” and doesn’t understand why someone would want to jack into an artificial reality. “You would rather be a polished avatar instead of your real self? That’s essentially no different from anonymous messageboard sites,” says Kutaragi. 
He’s not a fan of wearing VR headsets to interact with the metaverse either, saying, “Headsets would isolate you from the real world, and I can’t agree with that. Headsets are simply annoying.”
Kutaragi is regarded as the “Father of the PlayStation” as he persuaded Sony to enter the video game market in the early ‘90s and engineered the original PlayStation. Thanks to the console’s massive success, he became CEO of Sony Computer Entertainment America in 1997 and led the development of the PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, and PlayStation 3. Kutaragi was succeeded as CEO by Kaz Hirai in 2006; he then retired and took the role of honorary chairman and later became a tech advisor.
The 71-year old currently serves as CEO of The Ascent, a start-up robotics company whose goal is to blend the real world with the digital one in a less virtual fashion. Instead of chasing a wholly artificial world, The Ascent aims to create intelligent robots, built with chips and sensors designed by Kutaragi’s team, that can perform various human tasks and produce a wide range of products. Creating robots that can project digital scenes, such as holograms, is another goal of Kutaragi’s.

                    <span>Just days after the news that Microsoft and Xbox are acquiring Activision Blizzard, Xbox head and the new CEO of Microsoft Gaming, Phil Spencer, has commented on the possibility of Activision Blizzard games coming to PlayStation in the future. 
In short, his comments are somewhat vague, following similar messaging to his thoughts on exclusivity regarding Bethesda games after Microsoft acquired Bethesda back in 2020. Here’s what he had to say: 
Had good calls this week with leaders at Sony. I confirmed our intent to honor all existing agreements upon acquisition of Activision Blizzard and our desire to keep Call of Duty on PlayStation. Sony is an important part of our industry, and we value our relationship.

                    <span>Nintendo has revealed that The Legend of Zelda: Majora’s Mask is coming to its Nintendo Switch Online subscription service next month. 
As usual, because Majora’s Mask is a Nintendo 64 game, you won’t be able to play it if you’re just a standard Nintendo Switch Online subscriber – you must be subscribed to the pricier Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack tier to play it and other Nintendo 64 games that hit the service. This news comes just a day after Banjo Kazooie, the classic Rare-developed Nintendo 64 platformer, hit the Expansion Pack and it seems that Majora’s Mask is the next major addition.

                    <span>Fortnite&#x27;s item shop was updated today with two more Marvel heroes – both going by the name Hawkeye. Players can now purchase skins for Kate Bishop and Clint Barton, two comic book staples who were recently together in the Disney+ Hawkeye series. Both characters are decked out in purple and black gear, with familiar elements here and there, but look distinctly Fortnite in their facial features.
You can buy each of them individually for 1,500 V-Bucks – both are equipped with a unique quiver back bling. If you desire both characters, you can purchase them together in a bundle for the reduced price of 2,400. This collection comes with the back blings of note and also Hawkeye-themed harvesting tools, a glider, and a loading screen. The glider can be purchased separately for 800 V-Bucks.

In addition to the Marvel content, Epic has once again made Cuddle Team Leader available for purchase for 2,000 V-Bucks. The store is currently flush with dance emotes and a wide variety of Fortnite game character skins. Like all Marvel heroes who join this fight, the Hawkeyes likely won&#x27;t be around for long.</span>

Thankfully, a week and change later, that seems to be fixed—though a little extra fiddling is required if you did suffer this bug.

                    <span>What a ridiculous week. Activision Blizzard came in on Monday dragging a trail of lawsuits and scandal with allegations of widespread discrimination and harassment, on Tuesday were being bought by Microsoft for $69 billion (£50 billion), and now on Friday they&#x27;ve grown a union. 34 quality assurance testers at the Activision Blizzard studio Raven Software, who currently maintain Call Of Duty: Warzone, are forming a union named the Game Workers Alliance. They&#x27;re seeking better working conditions in the wake of Raven QA layoffs.

                    <span>I’ve always entertained the idea of an apocalypse. I mean, zombies are definitely scary, but it’d be a cool fantasy to play out. Over the years, I’ve even formed my own little plan. Loot some local houses and then set up a base in the fire station on my street. They’ve got electric gates and metal fences to guard the perimeter, a renewable power source thanks to a wind turbine on the roof, and a really handy watchtower. I thought 11 years of The Walking Dead would’ve prepared me fairly well and I fancied my chances. So, I made myself in Project Zomboid. It turns out, everything I learned from The Walking Dead was useless.

                    <span>Pupperazzi is a game about taking pictures of dogs. They are, as is traditional, very cute dogs. You go around several areas that increase in complexity and dog saturation, completing photo challenges and unlocking more and more complex areas. An extreme sports dog wants a picture of a dog riding a scooter. The old sea-dog at the beach would like a photo of any dog, as long as the lighthouse is in the background. In return for this you get golden bones as a form of currency to buy different kinds of film, or weird lenses, to kick your photography into the next gear.
It&#x27;s cute. It&#x27;s a really nice playground that facilitates the player&#x27;s own creativity. You can pet dogs to make them happy, or find toys to make them do different things: turn on a radio and any furry pals nearby bust out some truly astonishing moves; throw a stick to initiate a huge game of fetch. You post your photos to a kind of dog-centric Instagram for likes and comments (possibly from dogs; possibly from humans). The colourful, chunky art, combined with deliberately stiff animation where nobody can move their joints, really reminds me of Playmobil toys. Despite this carefree, playful tone, I also find it unaccountably sinister.

                    <span>If I ever achieve immortality, there might be time to sit down and work out exactly why some building games grab me and some don&#x27;t. I fear I am too often left with a page of notes that are just variations on the word &quot;vibes&quot;. 
Perhaps some taxonomy would help. Moons Of Ardan is a space colony building game that&#x27;s mostly about balancing production rates by placing buildings. Less dryly, you&#x27;re making a new home for mildly cute little space people on semi-cartoony worlds, where nothing ever really goes wrong and... the vibes. It&#x27;s the vibes, you see.

                    <span>Early access is a mixed bag. Sometimes it&#x27;s an exciting early glimpse, sometimes it feels like supporting a developer or game you care about, and sometimes it can feel more like paying to beta test. That last one won&#x27;t be a concern with Blood Bowl 3, not anymore. The latest adaptation of Games Workshop&#x27;s tabletop fantasy bloodsport was headed to early access but now, naw. The developers are focusing on closed beta testing instead, and will simply launch the game in full once it&#x27;s done.

                    <span>V úterý Microsoft oznámil záměr koupit herní společnost Activision Blizzard za téměř 69 miliard dolarů. Activision Blizzard vlastní hry jako Warcraft, Diablo, Starcraft, Overwatch, Call of Duty a Candy Crash. Patrně se nedočkáme linuxových portů (ale můžeme se nechat překvapit). Mohlo by však dojít k většímu prodeji her přes Steam, který doposud prodává asi jen Call of Duty. Na Steamu je pak pohodlně možné použít Proton a hrát hry pro Windows v Linuxu.</span>

In addition to sanctions, the ISP also wants the option to inform the jury about the missing evidence, while testimony based on that information should be precluded from trial.

The ongoing lawsuit from the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) against the company is over reported toxic workplace culture. The bulk of the suit focuses on &quot;violations of the state&#x27;s civil rights and equal pay laws,&quot; specifically regarding the treatment of women and other marginalized groups. To learn more about the proceedings thus far, including details listed in the lawsuit against Activision Blizzard, please check out our previous coverage here.

                    <span>Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer, who doubles as the head of Xbox, has revealed that Xbox is going to talk to Activision Blizzard developers about working on dormant franchises. 
This news comes by way of a new interview with Spencer from The Washington Post, where he reveals his excitement about the IP Microsoft can now tap into after its acquisition of Activision Blizzard is complete. He specifically mentions King’s Quest, Guitar Hero, and even HeXen, a long-dormant Activision Blizzard franchise that’s basically a first-person spellcasting game.

Spencer told The Washington Post, “We’re hoping that we’ll be able to work with them [Activision Blizzard developers] when the deal closes to make sure we have resources to work on franchises that I love from my childhood and that the teams really want to get.” 
“I’m looking forward to these conversations,” he said. “I really think it’s about adding resources and increasing capability.” 
Spencer also touched on a worry he has about tech companies not traditionally associated with gaming coming into the space. 
For more, be sure to read the entire interview from The Washington Post. After that, read about Microsoft’s staggering $68.7 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard and then check out how that price tag stacks up against other video game acquisitions.

The first is that Gunsmith Reputation is getting changed next month, with the launch of The Witch Queen expansion on February 22, to match other vendors in the Tower. Specifically, Gunsmith Materials and Weapon Telemetries are being removed from the game. 
“Banshee-44 is getting a new reputation system that matches the other vendors in the Tower, such as Zavala and Shaxx,” the blog post reads. “This means we are removing some of the items that were previously associated with Gunsmith Reputation, namely Gunsmith Materials …</span>

Following a reboot and three exceptional expansions, Final Fantasy XIV’s fourth add-on, Endwalker, has a lot to live up to, especially as it’s billed as the conclusion to the storyline that’s been brewing since the defunct 1.0 release. I’m happy to report Endwalker masterfully delivers a dense narrative full of exciting twists, wonderful character moments, and well-designed battles. Its culmination offers a satisfying conclusion to the conflict between deities Hydaelyn and Zodiark and other threads that have been unfolding for well over a decade.

The deal was worth a whopping $68.7 billion, exceeding the price tag of any other developer/publisher acquisition. Of course, it&#x27;s safe to assume that exclusivity rights could be in the works for some of the most successful IPs in recent memory, like Call of Duty. However, a spokesperson from Sony chimed in on the current chain of events, confident that several of Activision Blizzard&#x27;s games will continue to remain multiplatform experiences.

                    <span>We may be pushing towards the end of January, but you can still reminisce about your favorite PlayStation memories of 2021. Sony has launched the PlayStation Wrap-Up Report, giving players a chance to view their biggest and brightest gaming highlights from the last year. 
From now until February 20 visiting the PlayStation Wrap-Up page displays stats such as the number of games played, total hours spent gaming, trophies earned, and other factoids. The only prerequisite is that you’ll have needed to spend at least 10 hours playing a PS5/PS4 in 2021. 
The report also displays the collective accomplishments of players around the world including specific in-game metrics such as the most popular weapon in Returnal. Those who access the Wrap-Up receive a download code to get four free avatars (for PS5 and PS4). 
Sony may be a wee late to the party after Nintendo and Microsoft released similar player reports a few weeks ago, but it&#x27;s still fun to look back and remember, &quot;wow, I really did play a lot of Deathloop last year.&quot; PlayStation currently has Horizon Forbidden West, God of War: Ragnarok, and Gran Turismo 7 slated for this year along with no shortage of exciting third-party titles. Odds are the 2022 Wrap-Up is going to be one for the books.

It begins with an introduction to protagonist Aloy’s voice actor, Ashly Burch, who explains that Aloy had to step into a new role as the hero of the world. She also touches on the more adversarial aspect of Aloy and Sylens’ relationship. And speaking of Sylens, Lance Reddick is returning to voice the character last seen in the post-credits scene at the end of Horizon Zero Dawn.

The upcoming story-driven DLC for cyberpunk action-platformer, Ghostrunner, has been delayed. 
Originally set to release some time this month, Ghostrunner&#x27;s Project_Hel DLC will now release on March 3. This means players will have to wait a little bit longer to play the DLC, which puts you behind the blade of Hel, a boss from the base game. 
According to 505 Games, the delay is to give the team more time to improve the DLC while also ensuring the health and safety of the studio and its partners are maintained. 
The global release of the Project_Hel DLC will be delayed to March 3rd. We appreciate your understanding and want all our fans to know that we will use this bonus time to make even more worthwhile improvements while ensuring the health &amp; safety of our team and globa…</span>

                    <span>Have A Nice Death caught our attention when it burst onto the scene during the 2021 Game Awards thanks to its stylish hand-drawn presentation and equally slick-looking action. Thankfully, developer Magic Design Studios is ready to let players take Death for a whirl by annoucing the game will launch in Steam Early Access on March 8.
The game stars a very stressed-out Death whose underworld office has fallen into chaos thanks to his rambunctious employees running amok on Earth. Besides spoiling his vacation plans, this mayhem also upsets the balance of souls and that’s a big problem. Armed with your trusty scythe, you’ll have to keep your underlings in line the old-fashioned way.

The 2D game sports fast-paced hack n’ slash action where Death can wield over 30 different weapons. Since Death can’t die, success depends on completing stages repeatedly to earn better performance reviews to unlock new items. Death can also outfit itself with beneficial curses, though doing comes with a cost such as increasing enemy strength. 
Magic Design Studios plans to keep Have A Nice Death in Early Access for roughly one year, so we probably shouldn’t expect the full launch until 2023. The game will launch with several worlds and bosses available to conquer and the team will continue to add more content and fine-tune systems over the coming months.</span>

                    <span>Warner Bros. Games and Traveller’s Tales have revealed that the long-anticipated Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga will finally be released this April. 
More specifically, the blocky take on the nine mainline Star Wars films will hit PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on April 5. To celebrate the announcement, a new six-minute gameplay overview trailer gives us an extensive look at the title.

Pupperazzi is the gaming equivalent of cotton candy. It’s sweet and makes the day feel more festive, but it’s not going to tide you over if you’re looking for something with real substance. Smartly, the game doesn’t take itself too seriously, leaning into the playfully absurd concept of becoming a leading member of the puppy paparazzi with chuckle-inducing tasks, lively levels, and plenty of chances to pet virtual pooches.
Developer Sundae Month doesn’t try to explain Pupperazzi’s conceit. You are a humanoid camera (whose stretchy arms and ungainly shadow are either silly or the stuff of nightmares depe…</span>

                    <span>WWE 2K22 has found its cover star and release date. Gracing the front of the box this year will be the legendary Rey Mysterio, whose career will be highlighted in the game’s Showcase mode. Check him out in all his high-flying glory. 
As for when you’ll get to step into the masked wrestler’s shoes along with many others, you can circle March 11 on your calendar.
We previously detailed some of the features, gameplay modes, and confirmed superstars in last November’s update (which you can read here), but 2K22 features a new engine built from scratch to allow for smoother animations and simplified yet strategic grappling.

                    <span>Windjammers 2 launched today, giving ‘90s arcade fans or those who discovered the game via the 2018 remaster a new arena to lob discs at each other. My review is currently in progress, but since the online mode didn’t go live until today, I’ll need time to test that out in a live environment before giving my complete assessment. In the meantime, here are my impressions so far. 
The good news: playing Windjammers is still very fun. For those unfamiliar, two players face off in what’s essentially a hybrid of tennis and air hockey. You try to toss the disc past your opponent to score in their goal, but you can also earn points if the disc touches their court. The game sports a fighting game caliber of depth thanks to many variations of disc throws. The best matches are fast-paced, back-and-fo…</span>

Rainbow Six Extraction is a spin-off of Ubisoft’s flagship competitive multiplayer hit, Rainbow Six Siege, set in an alien-infested depiction of the United States. This three-player cooperative shooter borrows its predecessor’s roster of operators and weapons and recontextualizes them inside a more approachable player-versus-environment setting – often to fun results. The operator advancements offer exciting rewards for players willing to invest the time, though the climb to unlock the best rewards is steep. Additionally, a persistent health system creates meaningful c…</span>

The answers are &quot;Siemens&quot; and &quot;after&quot;, respectively. These are things I have learned today while playing WikiTrivia, a free browser game by Tom Watson which pulls historical dates from WikiData and challenges you to put them in the correct order.

We’re in the opening seconds of the round and only 20 minutes into my Midnight Ghost Hunt hands-on preview, which means I’ve yet to figure out important concepts like ‘where the hunters spawn in’, or nuances like ‘this button lets me hide in props’ as opposed to ‘this button telekinetically waggles props about like ectoplasmic dinner bells’. As ghosts we’re supposed to mostly stay schtum for the five minutes it takes to reach midnight, at which point we get to both metaphorically and literally flip the tables on the living. Instead: panic.

There&#x27;s an excellent Cavern Of Lies this week, in which Nate hosts a game-themed episode of Through The Keyhole in character as Lloyd Grossman/a robot version of Matt Berry. We also have some great diversions and some opening chat about the time my friend was a real life suspect in a murder for a few days.

                    <span>Dunno if you’ve noticed, but there’s been a whole lot of news lately. Too much news in fact. Growing up, we barely had any news. There was just one bit of news that we’d all have to share. A man would drive around our village with the news in the back of his van, and we’d all come out of our houses to watch as he slid open the doors and pointed at it, saying “well, here is the news”. And it was the same news, every day. The news about the hole in the ozone layer. And it was all the news we needed.


Not For Broadcast puts you in charge of all of the news. Set in an alternate timeline 1980s Britain in which an authoritarian far-left party has swept to power on a wave of populist policies, it casts the player as the lens through which the nation will view its new government. Seated in front of a bank of glowing screens, sliders and controls, you have the enviable power to switch between four live camera feeds, bleep out naughty words (and later subversive opinion), choose which ads to run during the break, and select which images are highlighted on screen during each news story.

                    <span>Ah, to be good with plants. Apparently it was a thing, wasn&#x27;t it, that my generation all got into house plants, especially during lockdown. A friend of mine has a positively ebullient front room full of lush, green darlings that have names like Hercules. My brother-in-law, absent any real space, has mounted glass spheres of water on his wall and grows little flowers and trailing vines from them. I, on the other hand, am a plant killer. Apart from in Strange Horticulture, when I run a spooky and ethereal plant shop in a town called Undermere, in an alternate-universe version of The Lake District. There, my plants are happy and weird, and with them I can save the world.

                    <span>Strategy games set in space are almost innately ambitious. The very concept of doing anything meaningful in an infinite void, let alone making it playable and entertaining, is a challenging one, and for every game that reaches for the stars there are countless kinds of... spiraling chaos orbitals.
Between its design flaws and unique ideas with semi-brilliant execution, the 2010 4X/wargame/economic/management simulation Distant Worlds: Universe has straddled those two experiences for a decade. It&#x27;s needed a sequel for a long time. Distant Worlds 2 is that sequel, and it&#x27;s almost upon us. Last week I attended a live demo and Q&amp;A session with its producer and co-designer Erik Rutins. With only a hands-off demo to go on I obviously can&#x27;t say for sure how it plays yet, but it&#x27;s already looking very promising.

                    <span>A small group of former Firaxis developers who worked on the XCOM games, led by the series&#x27; art director, have opened a new studio dedicated to making turn-based tactics games. Bit Reactor is their name, and turn-based tactics really is their only type of game. They haven&#x27;t announced any specific game yet but say they have several titles in development.

                    <span>Dice are continuing their efforts to fix up Battlefield 2042, with today bringing a patch fixing issues including some wonky hit registration, some crashes, and a bit of rubberbanding. Looking ahead, they&#x27;ve also revealed the much-requested new scoreboard which will arrive in February. After a few months, maybe the game will get to the state it should have been in when it launch in November.

                    <span>We’re in a bit of a “love letter” media period right now. Some old things come back with new things to say, like The Matrix Resurrections, and some old things come back simply to enjoy themselves, and remind yesteryear fans what they loved about the original in the first place, like Scream. 


Windjammers 2 falls firmly into the latter category. After successfully resurrecting Streets Of Rage for another bout in 2020, developer Dotemu are up to the same old tricks, bringing Windjammers all the way back from 1994 (before I was even born) with a fresh coat of paint and some brand new ultimate frisbee-style action in this sequel.

                    <span>The EU is planning to develop its own government-run DNS resolver. The project dubbed DNS4EU is meant to offer a counterweight to the popular resolvers that are mostly based in the U.S. Aside from offering privacy and security to users, the DNS solution will also be able to block &quot;illegal&quot; websites, including pirate sites.

                    <span>Amazon’s Lord of the Rings series has a name and it’s a touch on the nose, if not overly redundant – The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power. 
The Lord of the Rings is already a great title. The Rings of Power isn’t bad, either, but putting the two side by side is an odd choice, but you know what, it’s the one Amazon is going with. Fortunately, the teaser released today announcing that title is much more interesting than the actual title it reveals.

                    <span>It is important to keep in mind what is going on within Activision Blizzard at this time regarding ongoing allegations about the work culture. The ongoing lawsuit from the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) against the company is over reported toxic workplace culture. The bulk of the suit focuses on &quot;violations of the state&#x27;s civil rights and equal pay laws,&quot; specifically regarding the treatment of women and other marginalized groups. To learn more about the proceedings thus far, including details listed in the lawsuit against Activision Blizzard, please check out our previous coverage here.

Season 2 of Call of Duty: Vanguard and Warzone Pacific has been delayed. 
Originally set to land February 1, Season 2 will now begin two weeks later on February 14. As for why…</span>

                    <span>Blue Isle Studios is bringing its new shooter, Leap, to PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 along with a PC release. Check out the trailer below showing its wild, fast-paced action ... in action.

Leap features 60-player matches where players take on roles determined by which exosuit they choose to utilize. The four currently available are the Pathfinder, Titan, Wraith, and Tech Ops, each with different playstyles, armor types, and skills. Some let you fly in the air with a jetpack, while others let you stealth or play the support role. Personal vehicles or PVs let players mount up on their preferred ride, including a mechanical moose, what looks like a snow tube, or my favorite: the hoverboard. I definitely prefer cruising into battle like a gun-toating Silver Surfer.
Check out the Leap site to sign up for a chance to play in its beta which begins on January 19.</span>

                    <span>Dying Light 2 Stay Human is slated to parkour its way to PlayStation and Xbox consoles as well as PC on February 4. It was also supposed to come to Switch via cloud streaming that day, but that will no longer be the case.
Techland has delayed the Switch version to an unspecified later date. The team’s reasoning is simply to, in their words via a press release, “provide fans with the gaming experience at the level they deserve and Techland wants to provide.” Techland promises the game will arrive on Switch within six months of Dying Light 2’s release, so (hopefully) expect it no later than July. 
Dying Light 2 is a massive and ambitious game and getting it to perform well on Switch is likely no small feat, even if they’re utilizing cloud streaming instead of cramming it onto a traditional cartridge (which Techland did accomplish with the first game). That&#x27;s a bummer for those hoping to enjoy the adventure on a handheld, but at least Dying Light 2 is only a couple of weeks from hitting other platforms. To get prepped, check out the final episode of Dying 2 Know centered on its four-player co-op and the full list of PC requirements.</span>

                    <span>Microsoft swallowed up all of Tuesday&#x27;s attention with their plan to buy Activision Blizzard for $69 billion, drowning out even good news of their own. Along with surprise, concern, and bafflement, yesterday brought Game Pass news. Yes yes they do plan to add Actiblizz games to Game Pass while they can, but there&#x27;s more: 1) the service now has over 25 million subscribers across PC and Xbox; 2) cult classic Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc is now on Game Pass. You know, the one with the weird bear and the murdergames.

                    <span>Hello folks. I would say Happy New Year, but it&#x27;s already the 19th January and we&#x27;ve had two of the biggest news stories of the year in the space of a week, so I think that means it&#x27;s officially too late to keep banging the old New Year drum, isn&#x27;t it? The sentiment remains, of course, even if I do now feel a thousand years old in the process.
Rather than reaching for the annual reset button, though, today I wanted to talk about some of the new and exciting things that are coming up on RPS this year. For starters, our tech team&#x27;s just handed us a brand-new liveblogging feature, and we&#x27;d like you, our RPS supporters, to help us test it out tomorrow at 4pm GMT.

                    <span>Announced at last year’s The Game Awards, Have A Nice Death is a roguelike platformer developed by Magic Design Studios where you play as Death, CEO of the underworld. Your employees have gone berserk and thrown your vacation plans into disarray, so must wield your trusty scythe and travel into the depths of your company to hack them all back to their stations. It looks good! And it’s coming to Steam early access in March.

                    <span>If you&#x27;re after a way to make your magic system seem cutesy yet different at the same time, music is a good one to go for. Sure, it&#x27;s been done before, but it feels inherently charming. At least, it does in the trailer for newly-revealed Songs Of Glimmerwick, a new game from Eastshade Studios that promises to blend RPG, adventure, and gardening.
No specific release date is confirmed, aside from &quot;next year&quot;. I have to give them credit for the name Songs Of Glimmerwick, which immediately lets you know that this will be about music and magic, and probably have an amount of tweeness. Specific tweeness levels unconfirmed but they&#x27;re looking good from the trailer, where you can also clap eyes on some pretty cool-looking gardening, a tree telling you to stfu, and a man earnestly giving you a wooden flute as you head off to magic university.

                    <span>Sometimes you have no choice but to admire hard graft, even if it&#x27;s illegal graft. In this case, it&#x27;s a Russian bootleg copy of The Simpsons Hit &amp; Run which we&#x27;re admiring, mainly because the bootlegger has dubbed every character in every cutscene. The result is magnificent and just really funny, to be honest.

The Wall Street Journal claim someone told them that Actiblizz CEO Bobby Kotick wanted to &#x27;change the narrative&#x27; around the company following many allegations of discrimination and harassment, and he thought that one way to do that was buying some of the video games media, such as Kotaku or cheery RPS fanzine PC Gamer. Oh that would change the narrative alright!

There’s a joke there about him stepping down but the Chaos having remained, but I can’t figure it out. Anyway, what I’m trying to say is this: it’s been almost seven years since then. SEVEN! And I’m still head over heels in love with these games even now. Somehow, impossibly, that seems to be holding true for Warhammer 3 as well.
In a recent hands-on event, I was able to play something like eight hours worth of this final game in the trilogy from the comfort of my own spare room. Having not done a “digital preview” before now, this was something of a revelation to me. Wearing my comfortable clothes and with a steady supply of big mugs of tea, I booted up the game, hit ‘New Campaign’ and was greeted with the following screen.

                    <span>Microsoft yesterday announced plans to buy Activision Blizzard for $69 billion (£50 billion), a staggering and un-nice quantity of money for the video games company behind Call Of Duty and Warcraft. They&#x27;re buying the company at a troubled time, with multiple lawsuits alleging widespread sexual discrimination and harassment, an ongoing strike over QA layoffs, and employees publicly calling for the removal of the CEO, Bobby Kotick. A campaign group of employees known as the ABK Workers Alliance say the acquisition doesn&#x27;t change their goals and there&#x27;s still work to do.

                    <span>It turns out Rainbow Six Extraction is more cerebral and stealthy than the co-op shooters I’m used to; the other day I accompanied Hayden and Ed on a few missions for the latter’s review, and spent most of them either accidentally summoning hordes of parasite monsters or being hauled to medevac while encased in protective foam. Between my cocoon-muffled cries for help, however, I did manage to get a good look into how Extraction runs on PC, as well as the best settings to tweak if you want better performance.

                    <span>Rainbow Six Extraction is a spin-off from Rainbow Six Siege&#x27;s popular Outbreak mode, which saw Tom Clancy&#x27;s operators fending off aliens instead of each other. Well, Extraction is a tactical FPS that builds on what made Outbreak great by repurposing Siege&#x27;s PvP prowess into a moreish Left 4 Dead-like. Unpicking an alien hivemind with your mates is a real thrill, as is simply coming back from a mission alive. While it doesn&#x27;t do anything to blow you away, it does more than enough to keep you coming back for a quick alien-busting session here and there.

                    <span>I used to think that big, intricate character customisation systems were pretty much mandatory for decent CRPGs. As I saw it, the ability to conjure up a hideous goblin man with a chin curving back up into his face, if you wanted to, was a sign that you were playing something in the big leagues. Now, however, I am not so sure.  

Expeditions: Rome, a historical CRPG blending turn-based combat, strategic army management, and lots of dialogue, has a pretty rubbish character creation system. There’s bugger all you can really do to customise your Roman. and after the mammoth character forge of Pathfinder: Wrath Of The Righteous, for example, it all just feels very sparse and shoestringy. And that is a damned shame, because when it gets down to business, this is a seriously good - and lovingly detailed - romp through centurion times.

                    <span>To perform an ollie is to commune with gods. Or maybe just look cool. OlliOlli World is shaping up to be a good-spirited renovation of the 2D skateboarding series that has traditionally been quite punishing. This one&#x27;s got a flashy third dimension, moon-faced cartoon characters, and a plucky story to match. We&#x27;re told of Skate Godz who once appointed a human representative on earth. But she&#x27;s about to retire and needs a prodigy to step forward to fill her Vans. The player is that potential new conduit between holy half-pipers and humanity. In other words, this is a quest to become Skate Pope. Caliph of kickflips. Dalai Slama. Having both popped and shoved-it through a heap of levels in preview, I&#x27;m happy to report you can all sit down. I&#x27;m the chosen one. It&#x27;s me.

                    <span>A group of Foxhole players are going on strike to pressure the developers into address issues they feel ruin their chosen role in the war, logistics. The World War 2 sandbox MMO is a persistent battle where weapons, vehicle, and building rely on resources gathered, processed, and delivered by other players, without whom the war machine slows down. Our boy Brendy called logistics &quot;the real heroes&quot; when he rode with them a few years back. But many are unhappy with the current state of their role, so they&#x27;ve formed a union.

                    <span>Something is missing from Nobody Saves The World, a new action RPG from Guacamelee devs DrinkBox Studios. This is a dungeon-crawler that lets you shapeshift into horses, bodybuilders, and ghosts in your bid to save the world, but it&#x27;s a quest blighted not only by a Calamity, but by repetition too. Charming characters and clever mighty-morphin&#x27; combat succumb to numbers, which reduces what could&#x27;ve been a rich world to a rather hollow dash between dungeons.

                    <span>Can I get a ‘woop woop’, or at least a ‘wololo’, for the spin-off strategy game? The Ensemble Studios swansong that was Halo Wars, an RTS so streamlined it was aerodynamic. The ballistic ballet of Gears Tactics, which piled extra biceps atop XCOM’s shoulders. Even when money has moved through the membrane in the opposite direction, it has resulted in projects that were - let’s not overstate this - endearingly experimental. Can I get an understanding nod for Command &amp; Conquer: Renegade?
The strangeness of Crossfire: Legion’s situation is that you might not recognise it as a spin-off at all. That’s because the series is a big old blind spot for the Western world. Crossfire is an enormously successful Korean FPS that bears more than a passing resemblance to Counter-Strike - all right angles, assault weapons, and de_dust2 - but dwarfs even Steam’s most popular game for player numbers. With 690 million participants across 80 countries, it’s the biggest online FPS in the world. In China, where the game is a major cultural force, a coming-of-age television drama about two young Crossfire players has been watched 1.8 billion times. Bridger-what? Geralt of Where? The upshot of all that success is that Crossfire radiates money, and some of it is now funding new games from prestigious Western developers. Remedy is working on a campaign FPS in the classic COD style. And Blackbird Interactive is building an RTS named Legion.

                    <span>When I first heard about Wordle, I assumed it was an app, and went looking for it on various app stores. I didn&#x27;t find it - Wordle is instead a website, and completely free.

It turns out I&#x27;m not alone. App developer Steven Cravotta explained on Twitter that a completely unrelated game he released five years ago, also called Wordle, has had a major increase in downloads over the past few weeks. And now he&#x27;s donating the money he&#x27;s made to charity.

There&#x27;s a little combat, but not mu-- Oh, wow. Waitaminute. There&#x27;s a moment in this trailer where it suddenly looks like one of those adverts for fake mobile games. The hordes. Seemingly thousands of enemies on screen, and the physics to simulate them being hurled about.

You can watch said trailer below, released alongside the news that the game has slipped into next month.

Enjoy the heck out of this Monday. Have your favourite thing for dinner. Watch your favourite movie. Have a bath and put on a cool playlist of songs and sing really loud to annoy your neighbour.
Alternatively, play some cool video games! Here are the ones that make me smile when I&#x27;m feeling blue.

It’s essentially an AI-fuelled upgrade to Nvidia’s DSR downsampling tool, aiming to more intelligently render the frames of your games so that they appear more detailed – without the same performance loss that comes with standard DSR. It’s an intriguing new feature that could make some of the best graphics cards even better, and I’ve been trying it out to see if it performs as effectively as Nvidia claims.

On one hand, thank god it was only £119,000 because if it was the millions that some ugly Twitter avatars have sold for, every other mercenary games company would ramp up their own NFT initiatives. On the other, oh god £119,000 is still so much money for basically nothing.

More than that, the runner known as &quot;Mitchriz&quot; was blindfolded from start to finish, guided by a combination of memory and feeling-out environments. In two hours! Ludicrious.

                    <span>I enjoy the sub-genre of meme about Sad Murder Dads as much as the next gal. Heck, I enjoy those lads themselves. From Kratos in God Of War, to Joel in The Last Of Us, and even less story-focused murder dads like Soldier 76, dudes rock. Successfully rehabilitated and reimagined as father figures struggling to inhabit that role and accept their emotions, in some very good games to boot. Developers who were hot young guns in the 00s are now tired middle-aged dads themselves, and as a result the art they consume and, more to the point, the art they want to make looks radically different. I&#x27;m not having a go at that; that&#x27;s just life, is what that is.
But what I&#x27;m asking is, what&#x27;s the mum equivalent? Because I really want to see someone give a mum story the same big budget, fun epic treatment that Kratos got in God Of War. At the same time, I also dread this coming to pass.

                    <span>Friday&#x27;s long-awaited PC launch of God Of War was mostly received by people nodding their heads and muttering &quot;Boy&quot;—the highest praise a heavy heart can offer. A few would-be players, however, found themselves unable to play, with the game throwing up &quot;out of memory&quot; error messages when they really shouldn&#x27;t be out of memory. The devs have been looking into the issue, and released a potential fix on an opt-in experimental branch on Steam. It sounds like it fixes the problem for some people, but not all.

                    <span>Popularity, I have learned from American teen television shows, isn&#x27;t all it&#x27;s cracked up to be. While Square Enix haven&#x27;t been bombed by the local mafioso, joined a murderous D&amp;D cult, or discovered their dad is a serial killer and they too have the serial killer genes (thanks, Riverdale!), they did find such overwhelming success with Final Fantasy XIV that they temporarily stopped selling the MMORPG. They couldn&#x27;t expand servers quickly enough to meet demand, see, leading to login queues and frustration. But now things are settling enough to to start selling it again, and they have big plans to expand servers.

                    <span>I&#x27;m not sure I trust the Page of Cups. As imagined by Pamela Colman Smith and A.E. Waite in the 1909 Rider-Waite Tarot, he&#x27;s a cocky young man in a floral tunic, standing by the seashore hefting a goblet. There&#x27;s a fish peeking out of the goblet and the Page appears to be gossiping with it, perhaps sharing a joke about the artist, because honestly, what kind of artist paints a guy talking to fish. Or is he thinking about offering us the cup? The set of his jaw is ambiguous.
When drawn in an upright position, the Page suggests a flash of inspiration reeled from the mind&#x27;s ocean, or a dazzling opportunity. In this guise, he&#x27;s been a good friend to Ami Y. Cai, a game creator and illustrator from Kentucky - though in her first Tarot deck, Stephanie Pui-Mun Law&#x27;s Shadowscapes Tarot, the symbolism has been flipped around a little, the Page depicted as a mermaid peering into a steaming bowl. “Sometimes sparks come to me through conversations, or while I&#x27;m doing something else,” Cai tells me over Zoom. “So when I see the Page of Cups, I know that a creative opportunity is coming my way.”

                    <span>Puzzle games don&#x27;t need a plot, or even a theme or setting. When very abstracted ones throw one in it&#x27;s often an indulgence, or just an excuse to hang the aesthetics around something the devs happen to like. Blink Planets seemed like this at first, and that was fine! A little sexy hexy is all you really need if it&#x27;s done right, after all. I cannot believe I just said that.


Partway through though, I realised Blink Planets isn&#x27;t just about connecting things with lines of tiles. It really is about the urban planning its setting suggests.

It aims to improve image sharpness and quality on GeForce RTX graphics cards, using AI to reduce the performance loss of Nvidia’s existing DSR feature, and it’s now available to install and enable through GeForce Game Ready Driver 511.23.

                    <span>Over the holidays, I decided to treat myself to the gift of funk, and bought myself a neat little acoustic bass. The guitar arrived as promised; I am still waiting on the funk. Any day now. In the meantime, I’ve taught myself the riff for Valley Of The Fallen Star, better known as the Cosmo Canyon theme from Final Fantasy VII. I’m not sure if I can adequately put into words how the original composition of the track makes me feel, but I am certain I’m not the only one.It is sonic nostalgia for a simpler time, where following a talking dog’s weeble uncle to the projection of the cosmos he kept in his loft did nothing to shatter my emotional investment in a story.

So hey, look, here&#x27;s Democracy 4, the latest in the government simulator series from Positech Games.

                    <span>Fear not the fate of the Steam Deck, Valve’s ambitious, SteamOS-based handheld gaming PC. While the Deck’s release date was originally planned for sometime in December 2021, a Steam Community update from Valve has assured that they’re on track for the rescheduled launch next month.


“First and foremost, we’re on track to ship Steam Deck on time. Global pandemic, supply issues, and shipping issues notwithstanding, it looks like we&#x27;ll be able to start getting these out the door by the end of February”, so says the post.

The post also acknowledges Riot Games&#x27; recent history, including their settlement last month of a gender discrimination lawsuit stretching back to 2018.

When future generations wish to understand what England was like in the early 21st century, they&#x27;ll simply need to play a Duke Nukem 3D level. Since June 2021, Dan Douglas has been making a DN3D level which captures facets of the real England: town centres, Wetherspoons, Greggs, a sausage roll nativity, Michael Gove dancing, lads, absolute madmen, life under Covid, performative patriotism, the Brexit bus, and so much more.

                    <span>It&#x27;s been over a decade since a core game in The Settlers series last made landfall on PC, and during that time the real-time management landscape has arguably changed quite a bit. There have been some great building games that have risen up, and even developer Blue Byte (now Ubisoft Dusseldorf)&#x27;s own Anno series has staked a powerful claim to the city-building throne. But this incarnation of The Settlers isn&#x27;t so much about connecting to the series&#x27; past as it is about laying down foundations for the future. It&#x27;s had a slightly rocky road to launch, suffering several delays and refunded pre-orders after being postponed indefinitely back in 2020, but at long last this reboot of the classic city-building conquest-me-do is finally ready to beat down our door and come barrelling in. It&#x27;s launching in full on March 17th, and I&#x27;ve been hands on with an early version of the upcoming closed beta build that will be running from January 20th-24th. So settle in, folks. Here&#x27;s how it&#x27;s shaping up.

For our first episode of the new year we&#x27;re doing the traditional &quot;what games are we most looking forwards to&quot; episode. Yes, our most anticipated games. There is very little crossover, and lots of orc chat.
Before that, though, we&#x27;re lucky enough to have scored an interview with the &quot;It&#x27;s me, Blorko&quot; guy. Yes, we have the man who came up with this winter&#x27;s most fashionable Marvel-based viral tweet, live and on the podcast (I mean, technically he is on the podcast every week but this week we ask him about the Blorko thing for like 20 minutes).

                    <span>I wouldn’t call it a new year’s resolution – mine for 2022 are learning piano and using fewer dashes – but generally I want to try new things with my PC. And one such opportunity recently presented itself via the new Turtle Beach VelocityOne Flight yoke controller: I was going to learn how to fly.


In Microsoft Flight Simulator, obviously, but this honking great console of handles, buttons, joysticks and levers definitely looked like the right tool for the job. A simple flight stick this is not: there’s a full 180-degree yoke handle, an integrated display that can data like flight times, and a modular (but included as standard) throttle quadrant. The kind of thing you might own if your PC resembles a bisected turbine.

                    <span>On a stretch of futuristic tarmac, something clicked. Yellow quest markers hadn&#x27;t built my relationships in Cyberpunk 2077. When a job needed doing, then they&#x27;d steer me in the right direction. But for those initial sparks of story, my cellphone had been key. Chats and texts buzzed into my brain at all hours. &quot;Hey V&quot;, &quot;V, got a minute?&quot;, &quot;V!&quot;
Characters would get in contact with me, not the other way around. And I liked that. In fact, I&#x27;d say it helped build a living, breathing world more than Night City&#x27;s towering skyscrapers and moving billboards. More than, perhaps, any other big RPG I&#x27;ve played over the last couple of years.

                    <span>A new map, a new roguelikelike mode, PC VR, and a new take on one of Hitman&#x27;s more controversial elements are all coming in Hitman 3&#x27;s Year 2, developers Io Interactive detailed today. They&#x27;ve just held a stream revealing plans for the second year of support and content, giving a look at the new Elusive Target Arcade mode (this time, the murders are permanent, not ephemeral) and announcing Freelancer mode. That will give Ian Hitman a safe house again, and send him out to take down organisations through chains of missions with randomised elements. Plus, the whole trilogy is coming to Game Pass. Lots of news.

                    <span>In an industry known for grinding workers to dust even when not subjecting them to institutional discrimination, good news is always welcome. Armor Games, a browser gaming titan of yore and more recently a conventional PC publisher too, have announced they&#x27;re switching permanently to a four-day working week of 32 hours. They join a small but growing group of companies in switching, most notably Eidos Montreal who announced last year that they were going to four-day workweeks. Alright, who&#x27;s next?

                    <span>Splendid spaceship-dismantling sim Hardspace: Shipbreaker is winding up to leave early access this spring, with the developers saying the next major update will see the game blast off to a full launch. After entering early access in June 2020, they&#x27;re getting ready to wrap up the story campaign with its final act. Who knows, maybe we&#x27;ll actually make enough money from salvaging spaceships to escape our crippling debt?

                    <span>It&#x27;s probably more trouble than it&#x27;s worth to sidestep around comparisons to Mount &amp; Blade with Sands Of Salzaar. It&#x27;s mostly the structure. Sands Of Salzaar drops you into a world of dynamically warring factions. You can join or compete with them by founding your own, or ignore them to beat up roving bandits, clear out combined dungeon/random encounter sites, and do odd jobs for named NPCs. Some of those figures are powerful, unkillable, and recruitable, although you may have to win them over with favours or gifts. You&#x27;ll likely do a bit of everything, but mostly you&#x27;ll be smashing armies into each other in 2D skirmishes.
It&#x27;s no clone, though. While its component parts are familiar, Salzaar does enough of its own thing to win my affection, and its odd but sincere personality shines despite some muddy edges.

                    <span>The studio co-founded by former Valve writer Chet Faliszek and former Riot designer Kimberly Voll have released The Anacrusis into early access today, a Left 4 Dead-like set in 70s space. Much like its undead predecessor, this is a game where four players team up and pew pew through waves of alien nasties. But it’s not as despairing as its zombified brethren. This is upbeat and colourful and at times, really quite silly.
Yes, it&#x27;s still pretty similar to Left 4 Dead, but is home to a few things that help separate it from its zombified brethren. To test this stuff out, we had a full team of four in our hands-on preview session at the very end of last year – myself, Imogen (RPS in peace), Katharine, and Chet himself, who steered us through encounters with supreme patience. All in all, we sampled a ‘full run’, so a total of four levels, each with lots of, “Oh god, oh no,” moments. And it’s safe to say we had a lot of fun with it.

                    <span>Nine months after its debut on Nintendo Switch, Monster Hunter Rise today launched on PC. Capcom&#x27;s latest lizard-skinning simulator is a good&#x27;un, and what we played of it pre-release seemed like a solid PC port. However, now the game is out in the world, some would-be players are being blocked out by a bug which doesn&#x27;t let them even start a new save. Still, the majority of folks seem to be quite happily hollowing out dogs to make slippers.

                    <span>Watching the trailer for upcoming craft-o-survival game Forever Skies, I now understand how people who fear the ocean must feel about Subnautica. While I&#x27;m at my happiest in water, I know depths and strange sealife give many others the heebie-jeebies. However, heights make me pray for death. So a game about exploring the skies and skyscrapers above the ruins of human civilisation in a customisable airship, ah yes, I would like to die now, thank you very much.

                    <span>Valorant Episode 4 has kicked off, bringing with it new agent Neon who - like that famous blue hedgehog - goes fast. They&#x27;re able to sprint and slide around maps at blistering speeds, which might seem at odds with the game&#x27;s tactical pace, but they fit into the roster nicely. Thing is, you&#x27;ve got to be brave enough to get the most out of their move set, which rewards ballsy plays over careful corner turns. It&#x27;s safe to say I struggled to break out of my tentative shell, but when I did? Hoo boy, what a thrill.

                    <span>Given that we&#x27;ve still only seen scraps of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 after years of development and with launch supposedly mere months away, I suppose it&#x27;s not a surprise to hear the game is delayed. The developers, GSC Game World today announced that they&#x27;ve pushed the launch back by seven months, giving the first-person explore-o-shooter a new release date of the 8th of December. It&#x27;s the usual perfectly sensible reason: they want it to be good, and they think it needs more time to be good.
