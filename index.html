                              <span>In his recent Steam blog post about the current state of Mewgenics, the upcoming cat-breeding turn-based RPG, Edward McMillen spoke frankly on why it&#x27;s taking so long for it to come out: he&#x27;s trying to avoid another Bumbo and Binding of Isaac: Afterbirth+ situation, given their rough day one state.


&quot;Two of my worst launches,&quot; McMillen claims, explaining that &quot;both launches went wrong because we locked a release date too early then crunched too hard to hit it.&quot; This will not be the case with Mewgenics, he says, as he feels the game is near and dear to him, and wants it to release in as good and polished of a state as possible. Further, even though McMillen says the game is now &quot;roughly 11 months away from being content complete,&quot; this does not mean it&#x27;s bound to release in just over a yea…</span>

                              <span>My experiments with VR have led to some strange experiences, as well as a few action-packed titles. Titanic: A Space Between falls more in the strange category, though it manages to capture my attention thanks to its gorgeous visuals, compelling tale, and a runtime that is just long enough to leave you wanting more.


The Titanic ship and its terrible fate have always been a magnet for macabre myths and mysteries, and Globiss Interactive&#x27;s game plays on this concept while grappling with the morality of turning a real deadly disaster into a thing of amusement. The terror and tragedy are all present, and it&#x27;s up to you to decide whether you want to engage with it or get sucked into a sightseeing adventure instead.

                              <span>A few months ago, Gearbox Publishing turned the servers back on for classic MOBA Hero Shooter Gigantic, which had been turned off for over five years. They were only live for a couple of days, but it was enough to get people talking on the Gigantic Subreddit. What was the point of this two-day event? Is Gigantic coming back in some way? Well, the answer is yes, and it&#x27;s looking to come back in a big way with Gigantic: Rampage Edition on April 9, 2024.




Gigantic: Rampage Edition is how a game revival should be done


Typically game revivals have not been too kind to gamers. Often times revivals are simply just rereleases, with little to no changes at a premium price point. But Gigantic: Rampage Edition appears to be more than I could have hoped for with a revival. Not only is the MOBA re…</span>

                              <span>Bandai Namco&#x27;s epic RPG Tales of Arise is now available on Xbox Game Pass. It will be joined this month by the adorable Bluey: The Videogame, Indivisible, and Space Engineers among other titles, according to Xbox Wire.


Tales of Arise can now be played by Game Pass subscribers on Xbox One, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and PC. It also works on the cloud through the Xbox app on your phone. It&#x27;s a well-regarded JRPG marked as a return to form for the long-running Tales of series.


In our review, Eric Van Allen wrote: &quot;Whether this is the big Tales breakthrough or not is a matter that history will decide. This is a Tales game that hits the right spots for me, puts a lot of love into its cast and its action, and somehow manages to strike a balance between the old and the new. It’s not without a few shortcomings, but it’s also got a lot of improvements that at least shore those up a bit.&quot;

If you&#x27;re not a big JRPG fan, you&#x27;re in luck because there are many February and March Xbox Game Pass titles to look forward to. They include Return to Grace, Bluey: The Videogame on February 22, Maneater (which is returning on February 27), Madden NFL 24 for cloud services on February 27, underrated RPG Indivisible on February 28, and Space Engineers on February 29.


The Doom-like FPS game Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun also demolishes its way to Xbox Game Pass on March 5. Another huge game Diablo IV slithers its way to Xbox Game Pass on March 28. If you get fed up with Tales of Arise on Xbox Game Pass, you can always get into Blizzard&#x27;s action RPG madness.

It&#x27;s a bad time for everyone, and that&#x27;s why Activision developed Ricochet Anti-Cheat, which was supposed to be the answer to the CoD community&#x27;s problems. 


After years of holding off on using an anti-cheat to create their own, Ricochet has been better, but not great. Now, cheating seems to be on the uptick again across Modern Warfare 3 multiplayer and Warzone.


New Call of Duty cheats are getting out of hand


Cheating in Call of Duty is bad right now. Especially if you&#x27;re a highly-ranked player, it feels like the killjoys are in nearly every multiplayer or Warzone match. And it isn&#x27;t just aim botters and wallhackers anymore, either. Cheaters have created new and outrageo…</span>

Originally, I thought that was just because the game gave me the chance to pick between a respectfully improved version of the old, and a beautiful new vision for the classic, but there was more to it than just that. Now I have the full picture.


It turns out that the remaster had long-time fan Xproger at the helm, the person responsible for OpenLara, a multiplatform open-source engine of the OG games. Instead of sending this Xproger a cease-and-desist letter, Saber—the owner of Aspyr, the company behind the remaster—decided t…</span>

Instead, 2014&#x27;s Xenonauts was a more true-to-form re-envisioning, and its Early Access sequel just got a big new update.


Xenonauts 2 released via Steam Early Access in July 2023, almost a full decade after its predecessor first came out, and it&#x27;s been trucking along ever since. Its latest update, Milestone 3 (version 3.0.8) is substantial indeed, introducing an all-new Cruiser UFO encounter, Fusion-tier weapons for the invaders and Xenonaut forces, and a variety of other bits and bobs, such as the upgraded ARES combat drone. Another huge improvement is the switch over to the Unity 2022 version of the engine, though the addition of a new mobile weapons …</span>

                              <span>Tinybuild has announced Road Redemption developer Redemption Road Games’ Kingmakers, which takes medieval battle simulation and perverts it with modern firepower. I can dig it.


The trailer’s pretty awesome, misdirecting with some shots of gameplay that could be torn out of any number of medieval RTS. Then, it cuts to someone driving a pickup truck through the battle, and it gets weirder from there.




You play as someone from the future who gets sent back in time to intervene in a war. You’re trying to prevent the apocalypse and simultaneously confuse archeologists by leaving bullet casings on battlefields. But beyond just enjoying a vast technological advantage, you also get to lead your troops, popping out of third-person combat to an overhead RTS viewpoint. You also plop down buildings, but judging by the guys running around during this sequence in the trailer, it looks more like Command &amp; Conquer basebuilding than metagame citybuilding.


Blasting knights with modern firepower isn’t really anything new, but somehow, it isn’t very pervasive (yet). It’s an appealing concept. It was always very satisfying in the Civilization series to have a vast technological superiority and roll tanks over their archers.


Kingmakers also features co-op for anyone who has friends. It can be played with four people, each commanding their own army. I have to wonder what a co-op campaign would look like for the game.


For that matter, I’m curious about the single-player campaign. The trailer shows the player jumping back and forth between the medieval setting and the future. The footage focuses more on the core gameplay without really revealing what will tie it together. However, I really enjoyed Road Redemption and appreciate the developer&#x27;s approach, so I’m totally on board.


Kingmakers is planned to launch into Steam Early Access sometime in 2024.

Times &amp; Galaxy was first revealed last year. It’s an adventure game where you play as a robot and the brand new intern at the titular news outlet. You’re sent to scenes of happenings and must gather information to create your articles. The great twist here is that crafting your article is actually a part of gameplay. The flow has you first checking out the scene and interviewing witnesses and gossips about what happened.

                              <span>The ballooning popularity of Helldivers 2 has been both a blessing and a curse for Arrowhead. 


On the one hand, it has allowed the game to sell over a million copies already. Unfortunately, it has also put the studio&#x27;s servers under intense stress. 



Arrowhead has taken a rather honest and commendable approach to the problem. On Twitter, the CEO suggests that players who are strapped for cash shouldn&#x27;t buy the game just yet. Instead, he advises them to wait for server issues to be resolved and the game can handle the large capacity of folks itching to jump into the action.

                              <span>The TV adaptation of Fallout is due to air on April 12. To celebrate this – and because you need more Fallout in your life – Bethesda is launching an anthology of all the games in the series.


The S.P.E.C.I.A.L. (my word, is that a pain to type out!) Anthology set is launching April 11 and comes with a total of seven games. You&#x27;ll get Fallouts 1-4, New Vegas, 76, and even the 2001 release Tactics.




To cap it off, the set will arrive in a mini-nuke that makes an &quot;audible bomb&quot; sound when you open it. I can&#x27;t see how that could possibly go wrong in a public setting! You&#x27;ll also get S.P.E.C.I.A.L. cards, each with a PC code for the games. Pre-orders are being taken now, but the anthology isn&#x27;t available on console from what I can tell.


The &quot;S&quot; stands for Steam...


We&#x27;re not quite done with Fallout just yet. As well as the classic games becoming available on Epic Games Store for free at some point this year (after Epic changed its mind initially), we&#x27;re also still waiting for the next-gen upgrade of F4.


Bethesda told us late last year that we need to wait a little bit longer for that. Not to mention the fifth entry in the series, which is said to be in the pipeline. But who knows when we&#x27;ll see either of those...


Some may prefer the older, non-Bethesda games, while others are happier with the direction the series has gone in since Fallout 3. It doesn&#x27;t really matter which side you fall on. At least with this anthology set, you get to play them all.

                              <span>A number of people would have been disappointed to learn that Epic changed its mind about offering the retro Fallout games for free via its store. However, some good news is on the horizon, as the company will launch them as part of its storefront giveaways. Just not yet.


According to a recent report from IGN, Epic has been in touch with the publication to say the classic Fallout releases will be up for grabs &quot;later this year.&quot; A spokesperson confirmed that the first two games plus Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel will be included.

The original plan was to have all three available on Epic Games Store between February 22 and February 29. However, it was quietly pulled, being replaced by Super Meat Boy.


Some love is needed for these cult hits


It&#x27;s a bit of a shame we don&#x27;t exactly know when they&#x27;ll be available for free. All we know is that it&#x27;ll be sometime this year. At least it&#x27;s happening at all, given that fans had the rug pulled out from underneath them recently.


There&#x27;s a good chance a lot of people reading this have only experienced Fallout 3 and beyond. When Bethesda took over the franchise for the 2008 installment, the series went from having more of a cult status on PC to being a mainstream, AAA release.


As and when the older games do become free on Epic Games Store, I would urge you to try them out. They&#x27;re a different beast to the Bethesda entries, but it will give you a greater appreciation of just what Fallout used to be like.

You can watch the event at 06:00 AM PST on the official Pokemon YouTube channel (which I recommend keeping an eye on for all Pokemon-related news whether it be for the video games or TCG). The event is being held to celebrate Pokemon Day which commemorates the launch of the first games in Japan in 1996. Hence, it&#x27;s not unusual for the franchise to have a Pokemon Presents come our way on this date.

2022&#x27;s indie darling Cult of the Lamb has seen a good level of post-launch support over the past two years covering everything from content updates to crossovers. Today, developer Massive Monster has shared a new batch of newness, and while it might not be quite as exciting as some of those we have seen in the past, it&#x27;s good to know that the team is working to combat some of those pesky bugs.
The patch brings the game up to ver. 1.3.5 and it is all about delivering better stability while addressing some notable crash and softlock issues along the way. This one is available on Switch right now, so make sure that your game is running the latest version to try out some of the smoother sailing yourself.

                              <span>Show must go on.
Princess Peach: Showtime! is a game that isn’t going to immediately appeal to many of the fans of big shooty bang-bang games like DOOM Eternal, but there’s a place for it still with an audience as sizeable as that of the Switch. Nintendo invited us to come along and give the game a go for ourselves ahead of its release on 22nd March, and so we did that.
Let’s be very upfront about a very important factor which was probably already made blisteringly apparent in the original reveal trailer: Princess Peach: Showtime! is not a difficult game. Deep breaths, everyone.

Publisher and developer Burst2Flame has today announced that it will be bringing the fantasy turn-based RPG Stolen Realm to Switch on 8th March.
This takes everything that we are used to seeing in fantasy RPGs — a huge class system, strategic combat, dragons — and adds in a new &#x27;simultaneous&#x27; twist where your whole party takes their turn at once. In principle, this means that there should be something for everyone: turn-based tactics for fans of the genre, and fast-paced encounters for those after a bit more action.

In games, we often talk about ‘levels’ and ‘levelling up’. Promenade takes that to the – ahem – next level. France-based Holy Cap Studios and Red Art Games bring us this 2D puzzle-platformer collectathon that connects a mix of lands via a Great Elevator. Inspired by other titles, it may not be the most original, but true to its name (French for ‘ride’), it’s a pleasure to play — for the most part.
Promenade opens with your character, Nemo, getting lost (don’t). He’s less the Pixar fish and more Finn the Human. You fall from a great height to somewhere underground, where a little ‘poulp’ (which we just learned is another word for octopus, from the French poulpe) saves your life. A wholesome montage shows you making a home, before the day you decide to embark on the big wide world together.

It has been 25 years since Pokémon Red and Blue was released in North America. In fact, it has been 25 years and five months, but in the spirit of &#x27;better late than never,&#x27; TIME has decided to get in on the action with a new special edition of the magazine.
Ahead of Pokémon Day 2024 (and the Pokémon Presents showcase therein) on 27th February, the iconic magazine company has unleashed four special edition covers, each depicting a different one of the OG starters or Pikachu — because Pikachu has to be there, right?

Mario Kart 8 Deluxe has some superb music; that much is certain. We&#x27;ve spent many hours bopping our heads along to the jazz-inspired tracks with our headphones on, but what if you could experience the music with a live jazz band instead?
Well, you can! If you&#x27;re willing to travel to Oklahoma City, that is. As highlighted by The Guardian, a five-piece band simply called Mario Kart 8 Live has been hosting Mario Kart tournaments with accompanying live music to simulate both sound effects and the games&#x27; backing tracks.

This time around it&#x27;s EA Sports FC 24 and it&#x27;s accessible to subscribers from now until 26th February 2024 in North America. The same trial started in Europe last week and runs until 21st February 2024 in this region. The catch with this particular trial is it requires a download of &quot;at least 31GB&quot; to play.

                              <span>Get ready to return to the Pokémon Resort.
After a delightful introduction last December, the new stop-motion Netflix series Pokémon Concierge is now getting more episodes.
Netflix and The Pokémon Company have confirmed &quot;new episodes&quot; are &quot;now in production&quot;. It&#x27;s not been revealed just yet how many episodes we&#x27;ll be getting or when they&#x27;ll arrive, so be on the lookout for a future update.

                              <span>Another &quot;rebootless&quot; update has gone live.
After a system update in December last year, bumping the Switch&#x27;s firmware up to Version 17.0.1, Nintendo has now quietly released another &quot;rebootless&quot; update.
This was once again highlighted by dataminer &#x27;OatmealDome&#x27; on social media, who shares a brief reminder that &quot;rebootless updates&quot; do not require you to restart your console or take any other action, and often just contain some &quot;minor changes&quot;.

Around half the celestial sphere is given over to the dominions of the Automatons and Terminids, leaving ample room for another enemy faction to be inserted via free update or paid DLC. What could that next faction be? Surely it can&#x27;t be any worse than a horde of giant bugs or a legion of robots. Surely it can&#x27;t be, say, a highly advanced elder species of teleporting illusionists equipped with lightning guns and cloaking devices. Oh dear.

                              <span>Playing Pacific Drive reminds me of an army recruitment advert shown on British TV about 20 years ago. A group of soldiers are travelling along a road at night in a Land Rover, when suddenly they spot the enemy ahead. The front seat passenger starts barking orders at the driver: “Get off the road! Kill the lights! Through the trees!”. You sense the panic as the camera, inside the vehicle, jolts with the suspension on the rough ground, and the driver fights the steering wheel to stay in control. It’s a scene you reenact quite frequently in Ironwood’s survival game with roguelike trimmings. Well, except, instead of a Land Rover you’re behind the wheel of a rusty station wagon, and instead of military opposition, you’re scarpering from paranormal phenomena.

                              <span>Inflexion&#x27;s fantasy survival sim Nightingale releases into Steam early access today. Our pre-launch impressions? Well, the procedurally generated landscapes are engrossing, a blend of British fairytale influences with many a hushed forest, spidery swamp and tempting ruin. We&#x27;re also pretty keen as a team on the game&#x27;s Realm cards system, which lets you shape those fairytale worlds both before and after you portal into them. But we were less enthralled by HUD and user interface elements such as the crafting menus and hotbar, which we found ornate and circuitous to the point of confusing. 


Speaking to me after our co-op hands-on - in which guides writer Kiera made friends with a tree monster only for somebody to shoot it - Inflexion&#x27;s CEO Aaryn Flynn explained a bit about how the game will evolve during its early access period, which Inflexion estimate will last 9-12 months. Thankfully, it sounds like fine-tuning the UI is a priority, though Flynn is &quot;cautious&quot; about committing to a full-blown roadmap.

                              <span>Every year, there are a couple of game soundtracks I become properly obsessed with. In 2022, I more or less had the music of Tunic and Citizen Sleeper on repeat whenever I left the house. In 2021, it was Chicory. In 2020, it was Coffee Talk and Signs Of The Sojourner, and in 2019, it was all Mutazione, all the time. 2023 was a pretty great year for game music as well, as we not only got Alan Wake 2&#x27;s exquisite musical set-piece that&#x27;s honestly just been getting better and more insane as time&#x27;s gone on, frankly, but also the toe-tappingly brilliant soundtrack of Cobalt Core, which has somehow risen even higher on my forever playlist after revisiting it for this month&#x27;s RPS Game Club.  
Composed by Aaron Cherof, Cobalt Core&#x27;s music alternates between high-energy battle tracks and calmer, more relaxed ambience. It&#x27;s so dang good, and an absolutely perfect backdrop for sliding in and out of oncoming missile fire in its roguelike spaceship fights. So come along and jam to some of its best tracks with me below as I pick out some of my musical highlights.

                              <span>A colossal new update for Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader launched last night, hitting the grimdark space-aristocrat RPG with so many changes that the patch notes are almost 17,000 words long. Fitting for a game that our Rogue Trader review called &quot;engrossing, obscure and absolutely exhausting&quot;. It adds loads of new voiced lines, fixes everything from wonky abilities to broken quests, reworks balance, improves performance, and so much more. Enough is changed that developers Owlcat are giving everyone in your party a free respec to adjust to what the game has become.

To spare you the time commitment, its highlights include new Acolyte and Rogue masteries, new Item Factions, a full offline mode, controller support, and plenty of visual tweaks.

                              <span>The latest Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage update is giving me flashbacks to that inglorious period in game design when every other action game had an insta-fail stealth segment to wind people up between cover-based shoot-outs and, I don&#x27;t know, three-part glyph puzzles or what-have-you. Out today for PC at 12pm UTC, 1pm GMT, 7am ET and 4am PT, the 1.07 patch adds Full Synchronization Challenge, a permadeath mode (originally teased last year) that not only permakills you when you&#x27;re slain by enemies, but also deletes your save file when you commit crimes such as slaughtering civilians, or going outside of &quot;authorised map locations&quot;.

I know enough to make &quot;[x] for the [x] throne!&quot; jokes, basically. My experience with cleaning-stuff-sim PowerWash Simulator is extensive, though, and I was excited when the crossover with Warhammer 40K was teased a while back. Last night we got a full trailer and release date of Frebruary 27th - next week! - and I&#x27;m now earnestly very excited. The trailer is both very funny and shows off massive things to clean. Win win, innit.

                              <span>Developer Abstraction Games aims to resurrect Gigantic, the 5v5 MOBA-hero-shooter hybrid that went offline in 2018 – only a year after its full release. I recently played the upcoming revival, called Gigantic: Rampage Edition, and wished my session didn’t have to end. As an ardent fan of the original, jumping back into Gigantic is invigorating. Explosive fights erupt across the map’s many paths and objectives as each team races to expose and defeat the opposing squad’s Guardian with stylish spells and ultimate abilities. Notably, Gearbox Publishing is leaving the original’s free-to-play structure in the rearview, ditching microtransactions altogether for a $19.99 premium version featuring two new heroes, additional maps, console and PC cross-play, and updated gameplay systems.
Watch The Gigantic: Rampage Edition Announcement Trailer:


Notably, Game Informer&#x27;s original Gigantic review wasn&#x27;t as positive as I personally felt about the game. Did you play the original version? If so, what was your opinion? Do you think Gearbox can successfully find an audience this time around?</span>

                              <span>We&#x27;re in a bit of a live-action video game adaptation golden age right now. Not every project is a hit, but there have been enough success stories that learning about a new film or TV show in the works doesn&#x27;t instantly fill fans with dread. The latest example of that growing trend is the live-action Borderlands movie, which we just got our first official looks at, thanks to People.
This image shows the main line-up of the movie. Going clockwise, starting from the top left, Ariana Greenblatt is Tiny Tina, Florian Munteanu is Krieg, Jamie Lee Curtis is Tannis, Jack Black is the voice of Claptrap, Kevin Hart is Roland, and Cate Blanchett takes the lead role as Lilith. You can see a head-on image of her character below.
This film has been in the works for a while now, but outside of these images, there&#x27;s not much new information. If you haven&#x27;t seen it yet (or just need a refresher, since it&#x27;s been over two years), here&#x27;s the official synopsis from a 2021 press release:
IGN also shared the movie&#x27;s first official poster.
Here&#x27;s the exclusive new poster for the @BorderlandsFilm!

The Pokémon Company has announced that the annual showcase for the franchise will return next week on February 27. As for what to expect, no details were shared but if it&#x27;s like previous Pokémon Day celebration showcases, it could be an exciting day for trainers. 
This news was revealed today on the official Pokémon X (formerly Twitter) account with a quick video showing a 3D Pikachu rushing onto the screen to pose in front of the Pokémon Presents logo while a retro rendition of a classic song plays. Now, instincts might tell you to read into this model and song but experience learned from previous announcements says it&#x27;s not a tease – The Pokémon Company always does this kind of stuff and there&#x27;s almost no…</span>

That was a very interesting battle and showed the interesting capabilities of the 72 Arm Neoverse-V2 cores paired with HBM3 memory.

                              <span>Nintendo will air a Partner Showcase of its Direct videos this week on Wednesday, February 21. Unlike a traditional Direct, Partner Showcases are presentations that highlight upcoming third-party games for Switch.
The Direct will air at 6 a.m. Pacific/9 a.m. Eastern on YouTube and will run for 25 minutes. Nintendo states in a press release that it will showcase “Nintendo Switch games coming in the first half of 2024 from our publishing and development partners.”
Ignoring the faint voice in my head whispering, “Hollow Knight: Silksong”, these are some noteworthy games with actual confirmed release dates within that window that could appear:
Inkulinati
Unicorn Overlord
Gylt
Highwater
South Park: Snow Day!
Open Roads
Botany Manor
Tales of Kenzera: Zau
SaGa Emerald Beyond
Braid: Anniversary Collection
Numerous third-party games slated for 2024 lack release dates, so there’s always a chance some of those could get launch windows or new trailers, at least. Some big ones include Contra: Operation Galuga, Decapolice, the long-awaited Switch port of Kingdom Come: Deliverance, Little Nightmares III, Neva, Pepper Grinder, Star Wars: Hunters, Shantae Advance: Risky Revolution, and The Plucky Squire.
Or we could also find out which of those four mysterious first-party Xbox games now going multiplatform is heading to Switch. Just a thought. 
Of course, there’s likely to be at least a few brand-new game announcements. Hopefully, it will be a fruitful Direct, and we luckily don’t have too much longer to wait and find out. What do you hope to see in the Partner Direct? Let us know in the comments!</span>

                              <span>Warframe is making the jump to mobile devices, namely iOS, tomorrow, February 20. Now, fans of the popular sci-fi action MMO can continue playing anywhere.
The iOS version features 10 years&#x27; worth of content and supports cross-play and cross-progression, meaning players can bring their characters anywhere they go. Additionally, players who log in between February 20 and 27 receive a free day 1 award, including 3 Day Affinity Booster and Bombyx Syandana. Warframe is compatible with iPhones and iPads with the A12 bionic chip or later (12th generation iPhones/8th generation iPads and up). 


An Android version is also planned, but its release is currently unknown. You can, however, pre-register for that version on Warframe’s website.

Nearly 10 years on from 2015&#x27;s Helldivers, Helldivers 2 carefully adapts the simple yet exciting formula of bug-blasting with buddies for a modern audience. Arrowhead Game Studios has swapped the top-down perspective for third-person while maintaining the frenetic, ballistic loop of crash-landing on hostile planets, completing difficult missions, and extracting against all odds.
In a galaxy torn apart by war, you and your friends are Helldivers, the brainwashed protectors of Super Earth, invigorated by humorous trite …</span>

                              <span>Respawn&#x27;s work creating the Star Wars Jedi series is a hit among gamers and Star Wars fans alike, so it&#x27;s no wonder people have wondered whether the characters in the game might ascend from cutscenes to the silver screens. The question has been asked in the past, but it was most recently brought up at a panel at FanExpo Vancouver 2024, according to The Direct.
The question was posed to Cameron Monaghan, known for his roles on Gotham and Shameless as well as his starring role as Cal Kestis in the Star Wars Jedi series. For Monaghan, it&#x27;s not a question of whether he&#x27;s willing to reprise his role as the character, but a question of the circumstances in which that character would appear.
&quot;It would have to be right. By that I mean, it has to continue the story or the character in some way.&quot; Mo…</span>

                              <span>The rumor mill can slow to a halt, as Nintendo has finally announced a Direct, albeit through its external partners. On Wednesday, Nintendo will host a Partner Showcase Direct on its channels.


Nintendo&#x27;s Partner Showcase will air on February 21 at 6 a.m. PT / 9 a.m. ET on its YouTube channel. The company says to expect around 25 minutes of info, focused on Nintendo Switch games arriving in the first half of 2024 from publishing and developing partners.




No switch-up


So yes, let&#x27;s just get this out of the way now: with the words &quot;Partner&quot; and explicit emphasis on the external side of publishing and developing, I would not expect any sort of big Switch 2 reveal or anything. Heck, even a reveal of something like Metroid Prime 4 is likely out of the cards.


If you&#x27;re looking for the regular reason to over-hype yourself, though, there&#x27;s always Hollow Knight: Silksong. More realistically, studios like Level-5 have been making regular appearances at shows like these, and that company in particular pushed a big batch of games into 2024. I&#x27;d put some good odds on Level-5 showing up, though to be clear, that&#x27;s just speculation on my part.


Otherwise, expect a lot of non-Nintendo games coming to Switch. It&#x27;s an interesting choice, seeing as this is Nintendo&#x27;s first Direct of the year, and the same time as they&#x27;d usually host a big Direct to kick it off. It&#x27;s a shame the company isn&#x27;t putting any of its own stuff into the mix, and at 25 minutes compared to a hopeful 40 or so, I imagine we&#x27;ll still hear speculation about a full Nintendo Direct long after.


At least for now, we can spin down the rumors and look forward to seeing what&#x27;s hitting Switch soon, as it enters its seventh year of life. We&#x27;ll see what&#x27;s in store at 6 a.m. PT / 9 a.m. ET on February 21, 2024.

                              <span>The long-anticipated 1.0 release of Last Epoch is coming in very short order, on February 21, and one of the update&#x27;s most important additions are the Warlock and Rogue Falconer class masteries. In a pre-launch blog, the developer explained what makes these build options such a big deal.


On Steam, developer Eleventh Hour Games detailed the upcoming Warlock and Falconer, adding to Last Epoch&#x27;s whopping 13 unique class masteries. These are, more specifically, not character classes as such, but sub-masteries belonging to specific classes. And while they technically slot into existing combat paradigms in a broad sense, they also open up interesting niches, such as the Falconer&#x27;s pet-focused ambusher approach.

The Game


DESTRUCTOID: Hello everyone! I had the opportunity to spend some time hands-on with Nightingale both solo and co-op, with each realm I experienced having a completely different overall layout. However, I was the overall size between realms seemed to be rather similar. Is it possible for realms to generate smaller or bigger than usual?

                              <span>Last year, a leak showed that a remaster of Beyond Good and Evil is in the works for the 20th anniversary. At the time, the alleged game had been rated by the ESRB, and now the Ubisoft title has shown up on the Korean ratings board.


The Game Rating and Administration Committee (or GRAC for short) has listed the project on its website, and has given it a 12+. While the site is in Korean, the actual title is right there in plain English, referring to it as Beyond Good and Evil Remaster. The listing was added on February 16, so this is pretty fresh.

Granted, we already knew that this was happening, as Ubisoft itself confirmed it. Still, we&#x27;ve yet to see anything beyond the confirmation. The original came out in November 2003, so it&#x27;s a little late if this is going to be a special 20th year special.


Still no sequel, though


A remaster is great, of course, but what a lot of people are ideally wanting is a sequel. As I say, the game came out at the start of the new millennium. While a sequel has been in the works for some time, it&#x27;s pretty much in development hell at this stage. Who knows whether it will ever see the light of day.


In any case, we may still get a modern take on the first (and only) game. Remastering it will likely mean a tweak to the controls to make them more modern (a lot has changed these past two decades) and, of course, sleeker visuals.


We&#x27;ve been promised a Beyond Good and Evil 2 for years. At the very least, it&#x27;s nice to know we get some Beyond Good and Evil, sometime hopefully soon.

                              <span>While it may be overshadowed at the moment by its RPG counterpart, Granblue Fantasy: Relink, the formidable fighter Granblue Fantasy Versus: Rising is not one to sit back. Two months after the announcement trailer, Nier: Automata&#x27;s 2B is back with a new trailer showcasing some devastating fighting and a killer version of Weight of the World.


Another reminder of Nier: Automata&#x27;s greatness


2B is set to become available on February 20, 2024, as the second DLC fighter. Her pack will cost $7.99 individually. Alternatively, players who have purchased the Deluxe Character Pass 1 will receive the android alongside five other DLC fighters. Aside from her iconic swords, Virtuous Contract and Virtuous Treaty, 2B (and 2P) can wield a large number of weapons from the YoRHa armory.

At this point, 2B is a safe bet for just about any game. The character is overwhelmingly loved by gamers, no matter their preferred genre. It&#x27;s to the point that even if she&#x27;s not a legitimate addition to a title, you can almost guarantee there&#x27;s a mod that adds her in some way, shape, or form.




While she doesn&#x27;t exactly mesh with the world of Granblue, 2B is immune from much criticism due to the &quot;rule of cool.&quot; Be it Final Fantasy XIV, Soulcalibur VI, and more, Square Enix knows that she prints money and will license the character for just about anything. That&#x27;s a huge win if you&#x27;re a fan, and even if you&#x27;re not, you get to beat the white-haired war machine into the ground.

                              <span>A recent SteamDB listing seems to indicate that Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2, the much-anticipated sequel to the best &quot;recent&quot; IP in Capcom&#x27;s catalog, might be getting a demo soon. 


The hype started when u/CannedBeanofDeath on Reddit noticed a telltale piece of intel below:




It merely lists the addition of an &quot;Unknown App&quot; to the Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 backend on Steam. Still, there are only so many things that this unknown app can turn out to be, namely, the Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 demo. The smoking gun here seems to be that the &quot;Unknown App&quot; is listed as &quot;free on demand&quot;, a status that usually applies to demos.


As of the time of this writing, there&#x27;s no confirmation from Capcom that this will be the demo, but we know that Capcom sure loves their demos, and we also know that the release of DD2 will take place about one month from now. This would be a great time to get a demo out.


The original Dragon&#x27;s Dogma wasn&#x27;t exactly a massive hit when it first came out, possibly due to it not featuring the most amazing graphics of its era. Luckily, players quickly realized the game was filled with ultra-fresh gameplay ideas, such as having to climb huge enemies to kill them. You won&#x27;t be getting much giant-slaying done here by hitting monsters in their feet until they inexplicably die.


Ever since its release back in 2012, Dragon&#x27;s Dogma name has been growing in the hearts of the gaming community. It&#x27;s only natural that a lot of people are already revving up the engine of the sequel&#x27;s hype train.


Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 will come out on March 22 for the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.

                              <span>The Bloodborne-esque Lies of P has quietly removed the anti-tamper DRM Denuvo, as indicated by the changelog on SteamDB. The reasons for the change are currently unknown, though there probably won&#x27;t be any complaints about it. 


The DRM was added on September 15, just a few days before the game&#x27;s official release which resulted in a bit of controversy. Fingers have often been pointed at Denuvo for affecting the performance of games that implement it, though the company itself has repeatedly denied these allegations. At the very least, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be the case with Lies of P which runs smoothly on PC.

                              <span>It looks like the rumors from last year of a &quot;Complete Edition&quot; of Shin Megami Tensei V might have been accurate after all. According to Gematsu, an official rating popped up from the Game Rating and Administration Committee of Korea for Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance. The description for the rating indicated it was a complete edition of Shin Megami Tensei V with improvements and additional content. The rating was later removed.




No platforms or any other information was provided, but it would be par for the course for Atlus to be porting Shin Megami Tensei V to other consoles. Even though SMTV is the best-selling entree in the franchise, as of now it&#x27;s been a Switch exclusive. With the massive Persona fanbase that has grown on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC over the last few years, surely there are some fans on those consoles looking for a chance to play. Even though the two franchises are different, there&#x27;s some pretty big overlaps in terms of gameplay.


Honestly, I&#x27;d be included in that bunch. Shin Megami Tensei V looks amazing and I&#x27;ve heard the story is top-notch. But for me, there&#x27;s certain types of game I&#x27;d prefer to play on ms Switch and others I&#x27;d prefer to play on PS5. SMTV is one of those games. I&#x27;d be happy for a 1:1 port, but with the description mentioning improvements and additional content this will probably be a no-brainer for me.

                              <span>Last Epoch is rapidly approaching its 1.0 release date, slated for February 21, and the developer Eleventh Hour Games is revealing more and more information about it. The game&#x27;s been in Early Access since April 2019, and 1.0 marks a huge step forward with loads of new gear.


As per Eleventh Hour Games&#x27; recent itemization blog post on Steam, Last Epoch&#x27;s already substantial roster of items will be substantially expanded upon on February 21. Broadly, players can look forward to new armor, weapons, Unique-rarity gear, item affixes, and Armor Sets, which should make things very interesting both in the early and late game progression stages. What&#x27;s particularly exciting is that some of the new Uniques alter certain classes&#x27; skills in meaningful ways, suggesting some very promising synergies.

                              <span>Salary negotiations between Ubisoft workers and the gaming giant have gone sour, leading to a strike day organized by the French game workers union STJV (Syndicat des Travailleurs et Travailleuses du Jeu Vidéo). 


The mass strike took place on Valentine&#x27;s Day, February 14, and involved almost 700 employees from several of Ubisoft&#x27;s divisions, including the Paris, Montpellier, Annecy, Lyon, and Bordeaux studios. The conflict lies primarily with the alleged imbalance between management profits and the below inflation increases in employee salaries for the second consecutive year. According to STJV, Ubisoft continues to enjoy making a profit despite deficits in management, and workers are being exploited to increase profits. 




Though the strike was a large one that sent a message, it is w…</span>

                              <span>There&#x27;s no shortage of games out there inspired by FromSoftware&#x27;s Souls games, but Enotria: The Last Song is drawing water from a unique well. Developer Jyamma Games throws Italian folklore into the Soulslike mix for their ambitious attempt, and it&#x27;s officially launching on June 21, 2024.


Epic Games Store pre-orders are now live for Enotria: The Last Song, which is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Steam. PS5 and Steam pre-orders will arrive later, and for now, you can see a cinematic preview in the new release date trailer below.




In the world of Enotria, players can don role-changing masks and unveil the land&#x27;s secrets through the power of Ardore. The land is apparently stuck &quot;in an endless play,&quot; and as the Mask of Change it&#x27;s up to you to take on enemies and free all the actors who find themselves unwillingly living out roles in an endless script. 


Combat sounds like it might favor a more aggressive playstyle a la Bloodborne, with the ability to chain parries and implement quicksteps to swiftly avoid attacks. There&#x27;s also a posture-breaking system that opens enemies up for a counterattack, triggering an &quot;Awakened&quot; buff.

Pay to play (early)


Pre-order bonuses for the Standard Edition include the original soundtrack extract and a single weapon material upgrade. Deluxe Edition pre-orders pack in that plus a digital art book extract and more in-game content, from exclusive weapon skins to bonus DLC. Beyond that, folks who opt to pre-order the Deluxe Edition will get to play Enotria: The Last Song 72 hours earlier than everyone else. Hopefully, there will be impressions floating around before that to better determine just how enticing an incentive that is.

                              <span>You can take the Fallout: New Vegas out of the silly, but you can&#x27;t take the silly out of Fallout: New Vegas. Or something like that. At any rate, someone has managed to make modding history by finding an old file that was thought to have been lost to the annals of time.


This one is very much for you late &#x27;90s/early 2000s nu-metal fans. As spotted by PC Gamer, Twitch streamer Micky D (via Twitter user UsagiCola) has re-uploaded a mod for NV that adds Fred Durst of Limp Bizkit fame as a companion. Whenever you interact with him, he can only reply in snippets from some of the band&#x27;s music.




Neither Micky D nor UsagiCola are the original creators of the mod. The story goes that modder lb8068 created and uploaded it around seven years ago. However, after formatting their computer, they lost the files.


It&#x27;s my way, my way or the (abandoned) highway


The person who has brought it back from the dead said they just happened to have it on their hard drive. As such, we can once again enjoy the stylings of Durst as he accompanies us across the Mojave Desert. You can download the mod from here.


Ah, I remember the nu-metal days. Spiky hair, baggy JNCOs, no deodorant. Good times. Limp Bizkit was definitely at the forefront of the genre, even if Durst himself was pretty much the embodiment of a skater douche.


Personally, I wouldn&#x27;t really want him singing and rapping at me while I play Fallout, but it&#x27;s nice to know that the mod has found a new home. We should all celebrate video game preservation. Whatever form it comes in.

                              <span>A week and a half ago, Helldivers 2 dropped on PC and PS5, and it&#x27;s been gaining quite a reputation. 


While studio Arrowhead Games recently said it needed to cap servers at 450,000 players, it looks as though the game is close to reaching that limit. According to the latest figures from SteamDB, the game reached 409,367 concurrent players yesterday, with around 180,000 playing at the time of writing. To put that into perspective, Starfield reached 330,723 when it was released a few months back, so Helldivers 2 is already doing better than Bethesda&#x27;s newest IP.

We&#x27;re also seeing the Helldivers sequel at the number one spot on Steam&#x27;s Top Sellers list, once again knocking the Steam Deck down one place (as of this article being published). Even the Super Citizen Edition of the game is doing well, currently sitting pretty at the fifth spot, ahead of Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 and Palworld.


It&#x27;s all a numbers game


The fact that it&#x27;s still pretty new probably attests to this continued popularity. It could also be because the developer recently announced that – until the end of yesterday – players could earn &quot;XP and Requisition at a 50% multiplier&quot; on top of base mission scores. 


Of course, many people are still reeling from the unbelievable success of Palworld. With a peak concurrent player record of over 2.1 million, it made the game a tough act to follow for any studio (&quot;Only 400,000 players? A pittance, I say!&quot;)


As with a lot of new releases these days, Arrowhead has been putting out a few Helldivers 2 fires. Patch after patch has been sent out, with the team also wanting to improve server stability to prevent further issues. I guess this is just the world we live in now.

                              <span>With Link&#x27;s Ultrahand, your creativity is tested in fun ways. Some players have spent enough time with the sequel to find as many glitches as possible and make the most of their exploration of Hyrule. Luckily for us, they have all been compiled in a handy document. 


There are several reasons why you might want to rely on glitches and unintended ways of playing Tears of the Kingdom. These tricks can be used for speedruns, which is something players have consistently gotten better at. With the right glitch, you can have Link sprinting without depleting his stamina and needing a breather. This also eliminates the need to find shrines and upgrade his stamina wheel. 



For a little fun, try the Recall Launch glitch that can send Link flying. Not particularly useful, but it&#x27;s entertaining to …</span>

As reported by @TheRealJTV4K60 and shown on the PS Store, the PvE game has managed to overtake both Fortnite and Call of Duty to become the bestselling game on PSN in the USA as of February 18, which is nothing to scoff at. It has achieved similar feats on Steam where it&#x27;s enjoyed being the bestselling title, surpassing even the Steam Deck&#x27;s sales. The current success the game is enjoying can, in part, be attributed to the fact that for this weekend, extra XP is being served out. 


If you want to join in on the fun, it&#x27;s going to be a little harder for a while, as Arrowhead has had to cap the number of concurrent players to fix server failure issues. According …</span>

                              <span>MojeFedora.cz informuje, že ovladač Nvidia už není v GNOME Software. Před 7 lety se zjednodušil způsob, jak nainstalovat proprietární ovladače Nvidia do Fedory. Pokud jste po instalaci souhlasili s repozitáři třetích stran, přidal se speciální repozitář z RPMFusion, který balíčky s ovladačem obsahoval. Zároveň byla přidána integrace s GNOME Software, takže stačilo dát hledat v katalogu softwaru &quot;nvidia&quot; a ovladač šlo nainstalovat několika kliknutími.

Nyní se od tohoto řešení ustoupilo. Ovladač v RPMFusion totiž není podepsaný klíčem Fedory a tudíž nefunguje se SecureBootem, který má dnes zapnutý většina počítačů. Zmizela pouze integrace s GNOME Software, kde už nyní ovladač nenajdete. Repozitář s ovladačem je stále k dispozici a lze ho doinstalovat přes DNF. Uživatelů, kteří ovladač už nainstalovaný mají, by se to nemělo nijak dotknout. Momentálně se hledá nové řešení, které by bylo jednoduché a zároveň fungovalo se SecureBootem.</span>

Mario vs. Donkey Kong is finally here on Switch. This remake gives the original GBA puzzle platformer a fresh lick of paint and throws in a handful of new features too — including a fully revamped score. The composers for the GBA original, DigiPen Music Department, were brought back on this time around and a new interview from the department&#x27;s website provides an interesting look into the process of updating a 20-year-old soundtrack.
As it turns out, recreating the GBA music was not a case of downloading it onto a computer and hitting a button that says &quot;modernise&quot;. Aside from writing tunes for the remaster&#x27;s two new worlds, the team also composed and arranged acoustic performances to complement the virtual soundscape of the original soundtrack. As the game&#x27;s production, engineering and mastering lead Tacket Brown states:

After a brief delay, we have got our first look at this week&#x27;s UK boxed charts and it has been a good one for Nintendo&#x27;s newest remaster.
Yes, Mario vs. Donkey Kong has climbed the ladder in its debut week, beating the rest of the competition to grab the gold. The Nintendo mascot appears another two times in the top ten, in fact, with Super Mario Bros. Wonder and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe taking fifth and sixth respectively. Wahoo indeed.

Reports that Nintendo&#x27;s unannounced Switch successor may be subject to a behind-the-scenes delay suggest that the current console might have yet another Holiday season all to itself.
In March, Nintendo Switch will enter its eighth year, and scuttlebutt from industry sources had previously pegged 2024 as the year the long-rumoured successor — which we&#x27;ve all dubbed &#x27;Switch 2&#x27; — might finally poke its head above the parapet. Now, though, rumours suggest Nintendo might need to pad things out longer than previously planned. March&#x27;s Princess Peach: Showtime! is the only wholly new first-party Switch offering announced for 2024 so far.

It&#x27;s been a minute since we last covered Warhammer 40,000: Dakka Squadron (August 2023, specifically), but we can now exclusively reveal that the game is heading to Switch on 8 March, 2024.
The accompanying trailer from publisher RedDeearGames showcases some direct Switch footage, and while there&#x27;s certainly been a noticable downgrade in visuals, it looks like this is the Dakka Squadron experience through and through, with high-octane aerial battles front and centre.

Last week, Mario and Donkey Kong&#x27;s decade-old dispute bubbled back to the surface in the appropriately titled Mario vs. Donkey Kong, a Switch remake of the identically titled GBA original from 2004.
NL&#x27;s stalwart PJ O&#x27;Reilly enjoyed his time with it, awarding it a &#x27;Good&#x27; 7/10 in his review and highlighting the new co-op mode as a highlight in a game that lacks teeth: &quot;If you&#x27;re a more seasoned player looking for platforming challenges, this game finds its strengths as an experience for younger gamers or as a co-op title.

The cult hit EarthBound (Mother 2) is celebrating its 30th anniversary this year, so naturally, that means that Japan is getting another collaboration between Mother and watch manufacturer Casio.
Due for launch on 14 March, 2024 via a lottery purchase system, the &#x27;Mother Red&#x27;s GW-6900&#x27; follows a previous collaboration back in 2021. This time, however, the watch is red... Like, really red. You&#x27;ve got the Mother logo at the top of the display, while the word &#x27;Potential&#x27; is nestled in at the bottom.

In this mesmerising poker roguelike, each stage is made up of three blinds - small, big and boss - with the blind essentially being a high score you have to hit by playing different kinds of poker hands - your traditional flushes, straights, pairs and so on. Each hand has its own number of chips and multiplier bonuses associated with it, and Balatro&#x27;s whole deal is about shuffling closer to victory by making the most of the cards you&#x27;re dealt. While some blinds are tiny, stretching to just 300 or 450 early on in a run, they quickly start ramping up into the tens of thousands as each successfully defeated boss blind ups the ante and the accompanying stakes. Reach an ante of eight, and bingo, you&#x27;ve won a run of Balatro.
The boss blind I keep coming a cropper with, though, is The Flint. This sucker not only halves a hand&#x27;s chip score, but it also cuts its multiplier in two as well, and I&#x27;ve yet to figure out exactly how to defeat it. Sometimes it appears with a blind of just 600, but other times it&#x27;s been an enormous 22,000. In fairness, all bosses have little tricks like this. Some will debuff certain card suites, making them useless in your overall score count. Others may only let you play one hand type the entire match, while the cheeky Tooth will deduct you $1 for every card used. But Balatro isn&#x27;t simply about beating the odds with smart and intelligent card plays. It&#x27;s about bending, twisting and abusing those odds to your will - also through smart and intelligent card plays. Cheating isn&#x27;t just encouraged in Balatro. It&#x27;s damn near mandatory, and it&#x27;s all thanks to the brilliantly conceived joker cards that give the game its Latin-based name.

                              <span>As time-travelling fantasy APRG Last Epoch gears up for its 1.0 release this week, developers Eleventh Hour Games have revealed the final crop of character classes that will be arriving in the game on February 21st. Technically, they&#x27;re the final pair of the 15 mastery classes that you&#x27;ll be able to unlock after working through one of Last Epoch&#x27;s five base classes, but listen, I don&#x27;t even need to look at the other 14 masteries to know what I&#x27;m going to be aiming for come release. The Falconer specialisation of Last Epoch&#x27;s Rogue class just sounds too good to pass up.

The patch adds a new Hidden Dwarf Double IPA bevvy to the space rig hub&#x27;s bar, and duly necking it will initiate a prop hunt minigame among your squad of dwarven miners.

                              <span>Helldivers 2 is turning out to be an absolute laugh riot of a co-op shooter; it may even have the potential to rival Deep Rock Galactic on good vibes and teammate deaths as accidental comedy masterstrokes. Even ongoing server connectivity issues haven’t done much to spoil the sense of fun, which incidentally, can also be shared on the Steam Deck.
Indeed, following a quick Proton update on Valve’s part, its previously SteamOS-incompatible anti-cheat will no longer put the kibosh on you dropping into Helldivers 2 via your Deck. I’ve been testing on both an original 512GB model and the newer Steam Deck OLED, and as long as you don’t mind dropping the quality settings, it can usually run tidily above 30fps.

It not only poked fun at the reverential distance enforced on us by stuffy old art galleries, but it also invited us to recreate abstract modern masterworks by clicking, tracing and generally getting up close and personal with them with our big, colourful in-game fingers. Now, solo developer Thomas Waterzooi is back with Please, Touch The Artwork 2, which takes us on a slightly different journey through the art world as a hidden object point and click game. It&#x27;s out today, is completely free, and was made to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the death of the Belgian expressionist and surrealist painter James Ensor.

The content of this mod, you ask? It adds a companion who looks like redoubtable nu-metal pioneer Fred Durst. I was trying to come up with a pun to do with &quot;nookie&quot; or that modders will &quot;keep rollin&#x27;&quot;, but I respect you too much for that (also it&#x27;s Monday and I&#x27;m very tired - give me something to break, am I right?).

                              <span>Among the things I like bestest about Inflexion&#x27;s alt-Victorian fantasy survival game Nightingale is its Realm cards mechanic, whereby you generate and modify worlds by playing Major and Minor cards. Major cards are used at portals to conjure up a particular biome or world type and set the difficulty, including an approximate choice of resident NPC factions, local fauna and resources. Minor cards are played within worlds to mess with their workings. You can lower the gravity for optimal umbrella gliding conditions, alter the weather or summon a Blood Moon (sorry, Zelda) that reduces your max health.

                              <span>Another week of PC game releases is upon us and oh heck, slow down. There are an alarming number of games out this week that I want to play, from large-scale 3D productions to itty-bitty time-killers, each sinisterly appropriate to my Steam stats and wider research interests. Are videogame publishers and The Maw in cahoots to overwhelm me with impulse-buys and sabotage my attempts to Report the News? It’s possible. It’s possible. The Maw can be pretty cunning for an indiscriminate force of cosmic famine. The creature has been known to forge alliances with misguided mortals, seeking to flank and overwhelm harried news writers. How else to explain Phil Spencer’s T-shirts?

                              <span>Riot Forge’s last stab  at publishing smaller spin-offs from indie teams has resulted in Bandle Tale: A League Of Legends Story, which at first glance has all the things I love in self-proclaimed cosy games: gorgeous pixel art, laidback objectives and characters cute enough to trigger primal cheek-squishing instincts. But despite looking like an SNES classic and playing like a mix between Animal Crossing and Stardew Valley, Bandle Tale unfortunately ties itself in knots with overly grindy crafting that had me rubbing my temples in an effort not to combust.

Today you can find the 12600K for £167 at Amazon UK as a US import, versus £221 for the same CPU via Amazon UK itself. That £167 price includes an import fee deposit and shipping too!

A complaint filed at a California court claims the defendant believed he had enough time and space to dodge a cease-and-desist. Ultimately, the stars failed to align, rendering an inevitable copyright infringement lawsuit impossible to predict.

Thanks to the reports made by many of you, we have already solved many of the issues. But there might still be a few issues lurking around in this release candidate. Please share your findings on our issue tracker. Thanks to our translators, about half of the translations are (nearly) up-to-date. For the other half, we might need your help with translating. If your language is missing or has more than a few dozen missing strings, please consider helping to finish your translation. Download Changelog Bug tracker</span>

It&#x27;s less good news for those players struggling to play at all due to login issues and server issues. 

Rocksteady say addressing these is their top priority, although they ask for patience as the problems are &quot;not an easy nut to crack.&quot;

                              <span>Jump King is a simple, brutal, bastard of a platformer in which you attempt to steer a king towards the top of a single tower using his chargeable jump. Misjudge a particular jump by over- or undercharging it, maybe bounce back off a wall, and you may find yourself tumbling all the way back to the beginning again.

It&#x27;s probably about to get a bunch of even harder levels, however, because nearly five years after release it has just got Steam Workshop support and a new set of modding tools.

                              <span>This week, after days of swirling rumors and fan speculation, Phil Spencer and other Xbox bigwigs finally pulled back the curtain (a little bit, at least) on what the future holds for the console and the Xbox brand. Sony also hinted at what 2025 will bring for the PlayStation 5 (or at least what it won’t) while Helldiv…

Americký Federální úřad pro vyšetřování (FBI) byl autorizován k zásahu vůči kompromitovaným zařízením a zamezení dalším škodlivým aktivitám. Dotčeným routerům bylo upraveno nastavení firewallu, které omezilo možnost jejich vzdálené správy, a tím i možnost komunikace s infrastrukturou útočníka.

Aktualizované linuxové jádro totiž změnilo inline funkci na volání dvou symbolů, které jsou k dispozici pouze pod GPL, čímž se tato funkce stala nepřístupnou pro nesvobodné jaderné moduly. Jako dočasné řešení bylo uživatelům doporučováno vrátit se ke staršímu jádru.</span>

                              <span>Skull and Bones is finally out today. Let&#x27;s play the opening hour and see if it is worth wait. Reportedly, the game began development as early as 2013 and spent a few years as an Assassin&#x27;s Creed IV: Black Flag spinoff before turning into Black Flag MMO, before finally emerging as a standalone game announcement in 2017. In the six years since its announcement we&#x27;ve seen teases of it here and there, had chances to play in various betas and alphas, and it even appeared on our cover in 2022. Skull and Bones has been a long time coming, but today everyone is finally able to play it. Our full review isn&#x27;t ready quite yet, but you can  read Matt Miller&#x27;s positive early impressions so far by heading here. You can also check out an hour of gameplay below.

                              <span>How do you update a 30-year old pixel font to make it more suitable for today? The pixel-art OpenTTD fonts are iconic, but were designed for 640x480 CRT monitors rather than today’s 4k monsters. Without the horizontal smoothing of CRT scanlines, modern pixel-perfect rendering and 2x or 4x upscaling of the old bitmap/sprite-based fonts makes the text jagged and hard to read.</span>

                              <span>Longtime Linux kernel developer Thomas Gleixner with Intel-owned Linutronix has been spending much time over the past several months reworking the Linux kernel&#x27;s x86 CPU topology evaluation code. This is to clean-up a mess of aging kernel code as well as some areas of the code being incorrect in today&#x27;s era of hybrid Intel Core processors with a mix of P / E cores with the E cores lacking SMT/HT and thus throwing off prior kernel assumptions. With the code now queued up in a TIP branch today, it looks like that CPU topology rework could be good to go with Linux 6.9...</span>

Insider Gaming reports that its sources have disclosed that Respawn is developing a first-person title in which players assume the mantle of a Mandalorian. For clarification, players do not play as the Mandalorian, as in Din Djarin from the hit Disney Plus series, but rather as a different bounty hunter. The game is reportedly set during the height of the Galactic Empire and will see players capturing or killing bounty targets.

Our cover story on the game captured one moment in the evolving project’s life in the summer of 2022, and it has continued to change in the months that followed. In recent weeks, some sentiments on the internet and in gaming communities have concluded that, by this point, the game that is releasing must be a mess.

                              <span>The 27th annual D.I.C.E. Awards took place yesterday.

You can view the full list of nominees here. The big winners were Baldur’s Gate 3, which won Game of the Year among other accolades, and Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, which walked away with six awards.

The publishers have announced that they have cancelled “at least” five games in the works to help overcome a significant drop in income over the last year, adopting a new approach to development that will focus on quality.

                              <span>I promise I&#x27;m not trying to turn RPS into a Soggins the Frog fansite, but... If you have a) been enjoying Cobalt Core as part of RPS Game Club this month, and b) especially like it when Soggins turns up with his ship of malfunctioning missile launchers, then I implore you to make Sunshine Heavy Industries your next port of call in your Steam library. It&#x27;s what the Cobalt Core devs Rocket Rat Games made first, and you can immediately see a lot of shared DNA between the two games - not least its chunky, charming pixel visuals and some crossover between its cast of characters - including our pal Soggins. 
It is, I should stress, a very different game to Cobalt Core - it&#x27;s a sandboxy spaceship builder with zero combat involved, for starters - but I&#x27;ve been playing it again this week ahead of some other Game Club-themed articles I&#x27;ve got cooking, and I&#x27;ve been having a lovely time with it. Not least because I get to spend more time with Soggins the very smug frog, all while listening to even more excellent chill tunes from Cobalt Core composer Aaron Cherof.

                              <span>I&#x27;m kind of fascinated by what happened to Hello Neighbor. The original, a stealth horror game against a creepy AI that learned your likely movements, was hugely popular in alpha in 2016. The series was acquired by TinyBuild in 2020, and since then there has been a heroic number of spin-offs. There&#x27;s one set in an amusement park, a multiplayer game called Secret Neighbor in which one small child is actually a large adult man in disguise, a direct sequel called Hello Neighbor 2, and a VR game called Search And Rescue. I think everyone got a bit of Neighbor fatigue there, lads.
This might include the original creator Nikita Kolesnikov, as (still under the auspices of TinyBuild) he&#x27;s made a new thing. Currently on Steam for playtesting, the project currently known as RBO isn&#x27;t falling far from the home invasion tree, as players will either be a home-owning Protector - a McCallister, if you will - or an Intruder, or Wet Bandit.

                              <span>Because it’s somehow my job to worry about the technical fidelity of electronic toys, I’ve been eyeing the long-overdue arrival of Skull and Bones with some nervousness. After nearly a decade of delays, you’d probably just want to get it out the door, right? Skip straight to the open-world pirate adventuring, none of that &#x27;making it work on a range of graphics cards&#x27; nonsense.
But nope. For all its other shortcomings, Skull and Bones performs alright on PC, very often more smoothly than its system requirements suggest. Though I’d still recommend abiding by its SSD storage requirement – following the rules might not be very piratey, but installing on a hard drive will curse you to some pretty tedious load screen waits. Geoffrey Rush would hate it, honestly.
While Edwin sequesters himself in the starting area, let’s head below deck for a closer look at Skull and Bones’ PC particulars. That includes a full rundown of its graphics options – which include ray tracing and DLSS – and a quick guide to the best settings for an ideal prettiness-to-performance ratio.

                              <span>The first Streets Of Rogue was an RPS favourite when it launched back in 2019 (we literally couldn&#x27;t stop playing it), and we&#x27;ve known for a while now that its sequel, Streets Of Rogue 2, is due to arrive later this year. Ahead of the game&#x27;s launch, developer Matt Dabrowski has started releasing a series of dev diary videos detailing his design process and how it&#x27;s all coming together. The latest is about how he creates the game&#x27;s proc-gen open worlds and biomes, and it&#x27;s a fascinating watch if you&#x27;ve ever wondered how its particular blend of randomised chaos works behind the scenes.

Wavve Americas, a coalition of Korean broadcasters, filed a complaint against Kokoa TV in 2023, alleging trademark infringement, cybersquatting, copyright infringement, and other business-related violations. Kokoa TV had been receiving tens of millions of visits each month.

                              <span>A new study has found that pirate site blocking in Brazil and India boosted legal consumption. The non-peer-reviewed research confirms previously published findings that were limited to the UK. The effects on unblocked pirate sites are mixed, however, and whether the increased interest in legal content lasts over longer periods has yet to be researched.

That&#x27;s a huge, nearly 50% saving, and well worth it - even for a factory refurb unit with a 12-month warranty.

We talk a bit about how long it has been coming out, why it&#x27;s been in development this long, and why they didn&#x27;t just release the sucker the two or three previous times they got close to doing so. Honestly, I hope it does okay. We also talk about the games we&#x27;ve been playing this week, and Nate challenges us with a game of Palworld Pal: real or fake? PLUS the giant game dildo and our recommendations this week.

                              <span>I respect a game with wild ambition. Declaring your game &quot;the spiritual successor to Freelancer&quot; is bold and ambitious, considering how the spaceship sim is still so beloved after 20 years that our readers voted it your 16th favourite space game of all time. This ambition is wild when the tiny development team is led by someone best known for replacing Skyrim&#x27;s dragons with Thomas The Tank Engine. So while I&#x27;m not much of a spaceship sort, I had to check out the demo for Underspace, which aims to combine Freelancer shoot-o-trading space action with a dash of Lovecraftian horror.

                              <span>Tracking technology isn&#x27;t perfect. Actually, that&#x27;s an understatement. Tracking technology has many pitfalls, including how Google Maps can be accidentally used to track people, and the fact that if you systematically turn off cookies, your internet browsing experience becomes increasingly bizarre. I am offered adverts for afro hair care products and huge bags of puppy kibble, because the algorithms no longer have any idea who I am or how many small dogs I have. And yet.
Surely this technology has reached the point where, if I open a game for the first time in several weeks, it should be able to tell I haven&#x27;t played for a long time, and ask if I would like a small refresher of the controls.

                              <span>Last night I spent an hour in Ubisoft Singapore&#x27;s Skull And Bones, the much-reconceived, nigh-mythical open world pirate game that has been in development since 2013. Taking a leaf from the book of feared intergalactic corsair Samus Aran, the prologue starts you off at the height of your bucanneering powers, with a mighty gold-and-scarlet galleon at your disposal that is shortly blown to bits by the English Navy.

                              <span>I have never enjoyed those grid-based dungeon-crawling games. I dislike the very notion of dungeon-crawling in general, frankly, but the awkward juddery squareskipping rat-toucher games have always left me absolutely cold.
You will be shocked and aroused to learn that I preface with all this just so I can make an exception of Islands Of The Caliph. Does this mean she&#x27;s becoming more open minded, or just that she&#x27;s found a way to gripe and complain even within a recommendation? Who can say, readers.
What I can say is that I don&#x27;t merely hate it less than its genremates. I think it&#x27;s a bloody great little RPG, full of charm and detail that never drags it down.

                              <span>If you&#x27;ve been enjoying the excellent Cobalt Core as part of this month&#x27;s RPS Game Club, you may well have stumbled into Soggins the frog along your travels. Running into this hapless buffoon is always a delight in Cobalt Core, as he&#x27;s one of the few special characters who doesn&#x27;t instantly attack you on sight. Rather, the task here is always to try and save him from his own idiocy - namely, his malfunctioning ship that keeps firing his missiles right back toward him. He&#x27;s an ungrateful little sod if you do rescue him from certain doom, but I kinda love him for it anyway - and thanks to an industrious pair of modders, you can now have Soggins join your crew to inflict his own special brand of personal chaos on you.

But here we are, with the survival game exceeding 19 million players and Pocketpair probably wondering how they managed such a feat. With its success has come the inevitable slew of impatient people saying the game&#x27;s dead because it&#x27;s not received updates fast enough, or folks saying it&#x27;s lost a hefty percentage of its player base, and others saying its viewership numbers over on streaming services have plummeted. Palworld&#x27;s community manager Bucky has gently reminded folks that not only is this discourse &quot;lazy&quot;, but to play other games instead.

                              <span>Embracer have released their interim financial results for Q3, October-December 2023, in which they share details of the conglomerate&#x27;s on-going efforts to &quot;restructure&quot; and reduce their massive debts, to the tune of hundreds of layoffs over the past year. 


Amid the talk of revenues, profits and losses, we learn that Embracer have laid off 8% of their global workforce since announcing their restructuring program in June 2023. According to the report, Embracer&#x27;s total headcount has fallen from 16,243 in the period October-December 2022 to 15,218 in the period October-December 2023. The number of Embracer studio game projects in development, meanwhile, has fallen from 224 to 179.

                              <span>The studio behind Homeworld 3, Homeworld: Deserts Of Kharak, and Hardspace: Shipbreaker have cut a number of jobs, explaining this is &quot;part of a realignment plan that&#x27;s necessary because of new projects that were shelved by some of our partners&quot;. Blackbird Interactive haven&#x27;t confirmed the number of people who lost their jobs, nor have they said what the mystery projects were. It&#x27;s been a grim year for people working in the video games industry, with thousands losing their jobs, and we&#x27;re only halfway through February.

                              <span>Readers, consider this is a public service announcement for (deep breath) Tomb Raider I-III Remastered Trilogy Starring Lara Croft. Do not, for the love of all that&#x27;s ancient and holy, play this game with its newly-added modern control scheme. The original tank controls are by far and away the best (and only real) option for going back and experiencing Lara&#x27;s OG adventures from the late 90s, and I&#x27;m not just saying that out of nostalgia. The modern controls are bad, plain and simple, and are as much an enemy to Tomb Raider&#x27;s incredibly precise mode of 3D platforming as the tigers and wolves that stalk its trap-filled catacombs. They are utterly maddening, and the antithesis of everything Tomb Raider stands for. I implore you, do not go anywhere near them, for your own sake as well as Lara&#x27;s.

Helldivers 2 will &quot;never&quot; get a PvP mode, according to Arrowhead&#x27;s CEO Johan Pilestedt. The reason? They want to avoid encouraging any toxic behaviour in the new shooter&#x27;s multiplayer community.
Given that Helldivers 2 is a game with mandatory friendly fire in which you can kill team-mates by respawning right on top of them, I fear the Good Ship Camaraderie may already have sailed, but I&#x27;m very early on in my Helldiver career, and I&#x27;m... intrigued by how Arrowhead&#x27;s efforts at community curation sit alongside/within the game&#x27;s premise of playing a dirty space fascist locked in an endless xenophobic crusade.

                              <span>As promised earlier this week, Microsoft and Xbox executives Phil Spencer (head of Xbox), Sarah Bond (president, Xbox) and Matt Booty (Head of Xbox Game Studios) got together today to share some important &quot;updates on the Xbox business.&quot; You can check out the full update below, but the headline is that four future formerly Xbox and PC exclusive games are coming to other consoles, but Spencer was not ready to reveal what those games are. They are games that are more than a year old that have been on Xbox and PC for awhile. A couple of the games, Spencer says, are community-driven and service-based games that have reached their full potential on Xbox and PC. They are franchises that Xbox wants to continue to invest in. Two are smaller games that were not built to be platform exclusives. Though he wasn&#x27;t ready to share the game titles, he did confirm that Starfield and Indiana Jones are not in that group.
According to sources reported by The Verge, it seems the four titles may be Hi-Fi Rush, Pentiment, Sea of Thieves, and Grounded.
Spencer cushioned everything he said, presumably in expectation of pushback from Xbox fans by saying, “We make every decision with the long term health of Xbox in mind.” He also made sure to remind everyone that Xbox already has games on other platforms, calling out Minecraft in particular. Spencer also briefly touched on the company&#x27;s decision to lay off over 1900 employees, though offered little in terms of reasonable rationalization.
Bond also mentioned that Xbox is looking forward to and making plans surrounding future hardware and vaguely promised a substantial leap in technical prowess, but offered little in terms of concrete details.


The podcast also confirmed Activision/Blizzard games are coming to Game Pass starting with Diablo IV on March 28 and that we can expect a new Xbox showcase in June.</span>

                              <span>It’s been three years since EA announced it was making a new college football game after a years-long hiatus. Dubbed EA Sports College Football 25, not much has materialized about the game since its reveal in the way of updates, but the publisher has broken its silence with a new trailer confirming a release window and promising a bigger look at the title in the near future.
The video heavily leans into the skepticism fans have expressed over College Football’s existence, proudly expressing, “Yes, the game is real” while showing off snippets of behind-the-scenes development footage. The snazzy video doesn’t do much besides that, but it ends with a promise of a full reveal in May and a summer launch window. 


EA Sports College Football 25 is being developed by EA Orlando (formerly known as Tiburon), the team behind the Madden games. This will be the first college football game from the publisher since the demise of its NCAA Football series, the last entry of which was released in 2013. The franchise was shelved due to a 2014 federal lawsuit in which the judge ruled that the NCAA’s long-standing rule prohibiting college athletes from being compensated for their in-game likenesses was unlawful. 
With Name, Image, Likeness (NIL) rules now in place in college sports, players can now be paid for appearing in advertisements or products. That would, of course, include video games. EA Sports struck a deal with OneTeam Partners to broker deals with players to include their NIL in the upcoming game. However, this was met with resistance from school/player licensing agency The Brandr Group last summer, which filed a lawsuit to prevent EA from conducting such deals with OneTeam Partners. Both entities eventually agreed to a settlement in November, dropping the lawsuit (thanks College Football HQ). 
We don’t know what platforms EA Sports College Football 25 will target, but that answer should hopefully come in May’s larger update.</span>

                              <span>A new trailer for Princess Peach: Showtime shows off some more outfits and abilities the Mushroom Kingdom’s pink monarch has up her royal sleeve. 
Princess Peach: Showtime pits Peach against the villainous Sour Bunch, who crashes a performance at the Sparkle Theater. Its guardian, Stella, grants Peach the ability to transform and gain powers based on the costumes she dons. Stages take the form of different theater plays with ever-changing sets. 
The video introduces Figure Skater Peach, which sees her gracefully skating across a winter-themed stage and performing spins to take out enemies. The Dashing Thief costume gives Peach a Carmen Sandiego-esque look and vibe as she uses a retractable grappling hook to zipline and swing across 2D levels while evading security bots. Mermaid Peach grants a siren-like singing voice used in what appears to be a type of musical mini-game. Mighty Peach basically turns the Princess into a Super Sentai-like hero battling aliens using super strength and a jetpack to take out foes mid-air.


Princess Peach: Showtime is coming to Switch on March 22. Nintendo is also launching pink rose-colored Joy-Cons for the occasion.</span>

A claim that cloud services provider Cloud4C has been rendered inaccessible appears to be credible.

Rightsholders insisted that, without a license, TVkaista was an illegal service. In subsequent legal action, the operators of the service faced allegations of criminal copyright infringement and fraud. Seventeen years after TVkaista&#x27;s launch, its former CEO has just been sentenced to three years in prison and ordered to pay $505,000 in compensation.

                              <span>The AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D is my current go-to high-end gaming CPU recommendation, on account of its brilliant top-tier performance at a mid-tier price. The CPU normally costs around £375, but today it&#x27;s down to £350 at Amazon UK. This isn&#x27;t the cheapest we&#x27;ve ever seen this model, but it&#x27;s the best price recorded in 2024 so far and a solid £25 below the going rate.

                              <span>The RTX 4070 Super is a rather good deal, offering a significant boost in gaming performance over the earlier RTX 4070 - in fact, it&#x27;s closer to the 4070 Ti than the vanilla 4070. That makes it a great choice for gaming up to 4K, while costing just a bit over the £500 mark - £539 to be accurate after a £50 discount that puts it below the UK RRP of £579. 
That price is for a relatively modest Zotac Twin Edge model which fits easily even into small form factor PC, but thanks to the efficiency of the Ada Lovelace architecture the card should still run quite cool and quiet.

                              <span>A new update for The Sims 4 has added options to give characters vitiligo, the autoimmune disorder which causes patches of skin to lose pigmentation. Rather than a handful of preset full-body patterns, The Sims 4&#x27;s vitiligo impressively comes as loads of patterns for separate bodyparts, so you can create a wide range of effects. And no, you don&#x27;t need to buy an expansion for it.

                              <span>We&#x27;ve eschewed any Valentine&#x27;s theming this year, but Edwin put this in our news queue last night as a sort of dare for our evening shift, and let the record show I am less of a coward than Graham Smith. The Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood, a visual novel Tarot-themed card game from perennial (perhaps perineal, in this case) favourites Deconstructeam, was praised by Edwin in his review, and I was going to use the same strapline for this news post had he not got there first. Because now, in time for the season of romance, they&#x27;ve teamed up with sex toy purveyors Uberrime to create a frankly prohibitively massive dildo as an official tie-in for the game, which can be won in a free competition by three lucky people living in either the UK, EU, US or Canada (as in, they each win their own dildo; they don&#x27;t have to time share).
I mean I say &quot;prohibitively&quot;, but I don&#x27;t know your life.

                              <span>A number of Ubisoft France employees are on strike today after the collapse of union negotiations with Ubisoft management, who have reportedly proposed a budget for wages &quot;that would be lower than inflation for the second year in a row&quot;. The strikers are calling it a &quot;badly balanced rewards system&quot;. Cheeky devils!
The news comes care of a post from Le Syndicat des Travailleurs et Travailleuses du Jeu Vidéo, who have evidently been doing their homework on videogame humour. That research has paid off, for here I am writing about the strikes, though I think I probably would have written about them anyway.

                              <span>When it comes to co-op shooters and most other multiplayer games, it&#x27;s often the case that friendly fire is switched off by default or there are endless systems in place to make it a punishable offence. In Helldivers 2 it isn&#x27;t actively encouraged, nor is it punished. Accidentally vaporising your teammate with an air strike is all a part of the campaign for democracy and freedom, a hilarious byproduct of human error. I gushed about it in my review, and cheery RPS fanzine PC Gamer wrote up a quick piece on the specific ways it eeks out silliness.
But comedy isn&#x27;t just accidental in Helldivers 2, oh no. I think it encourages playground behaviour of the worst order: smacking your mates into things.

                              <span>Granblue Fantasy: Relink is a JRPG that is ticking off many of the action RPG tropes. It would be in danger of becoming workmanlike, such are the number of things you can tick off on your fingers like a plumber ordering parts: boss fights against improbably huge glowing monsters, an evil god, catboys, numbers popping off enemies, women who appreciate the combat applications of a thigh-high split skirt, anachronistic sunglasses, horned giants carrying halberds of the same approximate size as a caravan.
In practice, though, you sort of can&#x27;t be mad at Granblue Fantasy: Relink. It&#x27;s built around a layered combat system that seems impenetrable if you don&#x27;t take some time to understand it. But really, Granblue Fantasy: Relink is just a game so committed to the rule of cool that the entire setting is physically impossible, and every battle is a disorientating Panic! At The Firework Factory that flirts with being a photosensitivity nightmare. I&#x27;m not selling it as such, but it&#x27;s actually charming.

If you missed it, the trailer in question focuses on the &quot;modernised&quot; combat. It shows alleged &quot;everyman&quot; protagonist James Sunderland getting all Gears of Warry with some maggoty marionettes and rancid demon nurses.

                              <span>February&#x27;s Steam Next Fest demo bonanza officially concluded on Monday, and Valve have now revealed the 50 most played games you all tucked into across the week-long event. Ordered by the number of unique players that spent time with them during Next Fest proper (meaning all those early demo plays from earlier in the month haven&#x27;t been counted), the most popular game of the lot was one that was only formally announced right at the end of January. So congratulations Dungeonborne - your blend of PvPvE dungeon crawling and fantasy skelly monsters clearly struck a chord with this year&#x27;s Next Festers.

                              <span>By now you&#x27;ll probably have read quite a bit about our preview adventures in Inflexion Games&#x27; upcoming fantasy survival adventure Nightingale - including our slightly raucous attempts to interview CEO Aaryn Flynn while instant KO-ing tree monsters and abusing our supplies of ice bullets. But outside this guided co-op session, several members of the RPS Treehouse were playing it on their lonesome last week, too, getting to grips with Nightingale&#x27;s particular flavour of sticks-and-stones crafting, cooking up meat and berry wraps to keep ourselves fed, and generally being cajoled and maybe even lightly seduced by our fae Shakespearean guide, Puck.
With so many folks playing it - some diehard survival heads and others who are mostly just glad to be having a break from Palworld for a spell - it quickly became apparent that lots of us had quite different takes on how Nightingale worked as a craft &#x27;em up. I swear, I don&#x27;t think our RPS Slack chat has ever seen such passionate discussions about UI layouts and hotkey assignments, so we thought it might be fun (and useful) to try and distil some of those thoughts for you. Will Nightingale succeed in capturing survival newcomers with its peculiar blend of gaslamp tea leaves, or will it chaff like a Victorian corset for the survival hardcore? Join us as we discuss some of its finer points below.

                              <span>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor is a delicious piece of mad science: what if you spliced the ale-sodden DNA of Deep Rock Galactic’s dwarven miners with tissue samples from a Vampire Survivors-like autoshooter?
It shouldn’t work, surely. It would be easy to look at this spin-off and question why it takes the co-op out of one of the best co-op games on PC, or to shovel it aside as a cynical attempt at latching onto the popularity of autoshooters/Survivors-likes/bullet heavens (delete as preferred). But you’d be a smooth-handed leaf lover, my friend, as not only does DRG’s mix of horde shooting and rock smashing translate remarkably well to the format, even this early access version is heaps of subterranean fun.

                              <span>Helldivers 2 might be a co-op shooter mixed with comedy genius, but its launch has been blighted by bugs and crashes. Over the past week the devs have deployed server hotfixes and matchmaking tweaks, although one server and rewards patch had to be rolled back to fix &quot;significant&quot; performance issues. Still, they&#x27;re doing their utmost as the game becomes PlayStation&#x27;s biggest PC release to date. And the latest patch brings with it a slew of crash fixes, reductions to disconnects, further tweaks to matchmaking, and preps things for future server improvements.

                              <span>In the event that I walk in front of a particle accelerator, get converted into digital data and am promptly isekai-ed into a gameworld, I hope that gameworld is the opening port town from the original Grandia, released on PS1 way back in 1997 (and ported to PC in 2019). There&#x27;s something about that game&#x27;s isometricky vantage point and precise combination of 2D pixel characters and 3D environments. The last sentence describes many virtual worlds of the late 90s, but none have stuck in my mind like Port Parm: that hodgepodge of green and rusty roofs, the canals cutting through the cobblestones, the smoky chimneys and people filling the alleyways. Bliss. I can still hear the seagulls blowing around the screen. 


Oh sorry, I rhetorically lost myself for a minute there! I&#x27;m supposed to be telling you about Terra Memoria, a new RPG featuring time travel, magic crystals and animal wizards. Here&#x27;s a trailer.

Since researching and documenting them all has become all but impossible, a broader statement will suffice. Give or take, MPA/ACE appear to have amassed over 3,000 pirate site domains but the potential for that to expand exponentially isn&#x27;t as outrageous as it might sound.

                              <span>Apple is relatively good at banning piracy-related software from its App Store. Now and then, a pirate app may slip through the cracks, as happened this week. These are typically dealt with right away, but not always. Just as intriguing is the fact that the App Store is riddled with apps that use pirate brands, presumably to attract users.

                              <span>Ys X: Nordics, the latest entry in the long-running Ys series, is making its way to the West. Nordics stars a younger version of series hero Adol Christin embarking on an adventure in the Obelia Gulf, a collection of northern islands.
He finds himself thrown in the middle of a conflict between the islands’ residents and a seafaring tribe, as well as mysterious immortal monsters called the Griegers. Adol joins a Norman warrior named Karja to sail the seas aboard a ship, including exploring an open ocean and engaging in naval combat. 


Ys X: Nordics was first released in Japan last September and will come stateside this fall. It will be available for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC.

A developer can take many different approaches when remaking a game, but its primary goal always remains the same: to create a new experience that honors the spirit of the original. With Mario vs Donkey Kong, a remake of the 2004 Game Boy Advance title of the same name, Nintendo succeeds in this goal. By combining new worlds and modern quality-of-life features with the game&#x27;s classic, delightful puzzle design, Mario vs. Donkey Kong is a strong start to Nintendo&#x27;s 2024.

                              <span>If you’d been gazing at the present glut of new survival games  and bellowing for more, as though engaged in a drinking competition with some kind of cartoon Viking, then rest easy. Gord developers Covenant.dev have announced To The Star, a &quot;whimsical&quot; survival adventure that takes heavy inspiration from Alice In Wonderland, and features a cooking system that lets you combine monster parts with &quot;suppressed emotions&quot;, so as to produce both consumable foodstuffs and weapons.

                              <span>Helldivers 2 is a third-person co-op shooter that&#x27;s centred as much around action as it is comedy. Gigantic insects and red-eyed robots threaten the sanctity of Super Earth and, frankly, this isn&#x27;t on. As a Helldiver, you must team up with your compatriots and pulverise these menaces for freedom (a shoulder-mounted laser cannon) and democracy (an aerial bombardment). Seriousness is reserved for the act of extermination, which adds tactility to the familiar motions of a shooter, making for horde management that promotes efficiency and frequent lapses of judgement in equal measure. Helldivers 2 is a slapstick masterpiece.

Writer and narrative designer Rhianna Pratchett has kindled a little frail hope that we might one day play another brand new Discworld videogame, while responding to earlier comments from Perfect Entertainment co-founder Gregg Barnett about who exactly owns the intellectual property rights to Perfect&#x27;s old Discworld adventure titles from the 90s.

                              <span>I love the idea of cosy living, which is why it was that Tiny Living update that dragged me back into The Sims 4 for a few years there. The issue of course, is that in real life, if forced to live in a space the size of the interior of a camper van, I would pile things on every surface within about 12 hours. Chaos would reign. I would hate it. But I don&#x27;t hate the idea of it, which is why i enjoy things like Outbound, which is a game about living in a camper van.

                              <span>One of the best things in games is the freeform ability to type commands for another character, then having them respond with voiced dialogue recognising your weird directions. That&#x27;s one of the joys of Cryptmaster, an upcoming typing-driven dungeon crawler where one of the first things you can do in the demo is get your disembodied necromancer pal to lick a mysterious metal object to help identify it (it&#x27;s a helmet). He&#x27;s like if Hand Of Fate&#x27;s dastardly dealer was a bit of a dingus and also your only hope of escaping the underworld. I love this guy.

Wolves have broken into your home and murdered all your friends, but you play as the one sheep who got away - or rather, a sheep that&#x27;s been fused with a surprisingly powerful robot capable of producing a honking great greatsword to make their escape with. Thus begins the wolves&#x27; hot pursuit - not least because this robot also seems to be kind of sleeper agent for them - and your roguelike-shaped quest to avenge your fallen friends.

Right now on Steam you can grab a free copy of RPG Maker XP, an older version of the wildly popular (and quite accessible) game-making tool. It might be fun to kick around an idea or—who knows—maybe you&#x27;ve even got the next To The Moon (made in RPG Maker XP, don&#x27;t you know?) rattling around up there, waiting to manifest.

                              <span>Former Dead Cells lead designer Sébastien Benard is none too chuffed about publisher Motion Twin&#x27;s decision to end development of the well-regarded roguelike Metroidvania. A few days ago, Motion Twin announced that the 35th major Dead Cells update, aptly titled The End Is Near, would be its last. Benard feels this is a betrayal of both the game&#x27;s community and its current development team, Evil Empire, a spin-off studio who took the reins in 2019.

                              <span>DC Universe Online developer Dimensional Ink Games and its publisher Daybreak Game Company have been hit with layoffs. 
According to Kotaku, Dimensional Ink lost an unknown number of senior staff, with Game Developer reporting reductions in the art, community, and narrative departments. The team is best known for developing the superhero MMO DC Universe Online. Daybreak Games (formerly Sony Online Entertainment) has worked on several multiplayer games, including EverQuest II, H1Z1, Star Wars Galaxies, and Planetside 2. The exact number of affected employees from both studios is currently unknown. 
This is, unfortunately, the latest of an alarming trend of game industry layoffs that plagued 2023 and have only intensified in 2024. Over 5,500 jobs have been cut within January alone. Last year, over 10,000 employees in the games industry or game-adjacent industries were laid off. 
Among others this year, Embracer laid off 97 employees at Deux Ex developer Eidos-Montréal, Destroy All Humans remake developer Black Forest Games reportedly laid off 50 employees, Microsoft laid off 1,900 employees across its Xbox, Activision Blizzard, and ZeniMax, Outriders studio People Can Fly laid off more than 30 employees, and League of Legends company Riot Games laid off 530 employees.</span>

                              <span>MG Premium has won its bizarre lawsuit against pirate site Goodporn. In the early stages of the case, the Pornhub.com domain was &#x27;virtually&#x27; at stake, but Pornhub&#x27;s sister company was eventually awarded over $2.1 million in damages. The court denied injunctive relief, however, which means that there are no domain seizures or site-blocking orders.

                              <span>SSD prices have been on the uptick recently, following a record-breaking 2023 where oversupply caused the best deals on high-capacity SSDs we&#x27;ve ever seen. That means that current prices aren&#x27;t going to beat out last year&#x27;s Black Friday deals, but there are still some decent options that carve out a better value proposition than their peers. One example is the Kingston NV2, a 1TB PCIe 4.0 SSD going for just £50 on Amazon UK at the moment - some £14 below its UK RRP.

If you’re still reading, congratulations, you’ve either got a dangerously high tolerance for bad literary jokes or you’re really eager to hear about Nightingale, the new survival sim from Inflexion, which launches into early access on 20th February. A quick recap on Nightingale, in case you missed our early access preview today: it&#x27;s a strongly British-influenced &quot;gaslamp fantasy&quot; experience in which players travel alone or in groups between procedurally generated fairy realms using magic portals. You can build bases in each Realm, go on story quests and hunt the wildlife for crafting materials.
Last week, RPS adventurers Edders, Kiera, Jeremy, Ollie and myself had a chance to play co-op with Aaryn Flynn, Inflexion’s CEO and former general manager at BioWare, while chatting to him about the game over Discord. The resulting, not entirely planned group interview lasted two hours and consisted mostly of people yelling at each other about ice ammo and tree monsters, but we did find time for some proper Q&amp;A. Please find below an abbreviated transcript.

                              <span>When I first saw Never Grave: The Witch And The Curse rising up the Steam Next Fest charts at the end of last week, I thought, &quot;Oh! That&#x27;s a neat Hollow Knight-looking Metroivanida roguelike, I&#x27;ll definitely give that a go.&quot; And having played its demo over the weekend, I can confirm: it&#x27;s certainly an intriguing little thing that I&#x27;ll be keen to keep an eye on when it launches into early access, possibly sometime next month. 
The biggest surprise was that, despite its very Hollow Knight-looking visuals, it actually plays more like Dead Cells in practice. Instead of being a sentient lump of flesh able to inhabit infinite bodies, you&#x27;re a magical witch&#x27;s hat that can possess, discard and rematerialise your chosen sack of limbs at the touch of a button. The second thing that surprised me was that it also has quite a substantial base/village building aspect to it on the side, and the third - well, perhaps this isn&#x27;t so much of a surprise given everything I&#x27;ve just said, because it also turns out this is the next game from Palworld developers Pocketpair. Yep, it all makes a bit more sense now.

                              <span>We’ve all been there. You see a chair in a game. It prompts you to sit. Curious, you oblige. 
Your digital butt meets the seat, and…nothing. You just sit and stare for a few seconds before rising and continuing your adventure. More often than not, sitting does not result in a cutscene, reward, character dialogue, or, in some cases, even a good view of your surroundings. You just sit. 
You could be slaying a mighty dragon.
You could be rescuing your captive friends.
You could be discovering the true meaning behind your existence and your place in the cosmos.
But instead, you sit. 
With some exceptions, taking a seat in games equates to a whole lot of nothing. And yet, it remains a regularly recurring mechanic. So why do we sit? Do you like to sit? How long do you sit? Should sitting still be a thing in games? Please take a seat and discuss your stance in the comments below.</span>

                              <span>Last week, amid rumors about Xbox exclusives coming to other platforms, Phil Spencer announced an event that would detail the future of Xbox. While we&#x27;re no closer to knowing the exact details of the event, we now know the &quot;where&quot; and &quot;when&quot;: the announcement will happen on the official Xbox podcast this Thursday, February 15. The episode will be posted at 12 PM Pacific/3 PM Eastern

The podcast in question will feature more than just Xbox head Phil Spencer, however. Sarah Bond and Matt Booty, the Presidents of Xbox and Xbox Game studios, respectively, will also give updates on the future of the brand. 
There are a few likely candidates for discussion. The most recent is the report that Xbox exclusives would begin coming to other platforms, including Hi-Fi Rush, Starfield, and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. Speculation around this news has taken many different directions, with some even theorizing that the loss of exclusivity implies Xbox might stop making consoles altogether. A report from earlier today, however, says that this isn&#x27;t the case.
The other topic on the table is the company&#x27;s most recent round of mass layoffs, where over 1900 employees were let go from the company, and a Blizzard survival game years into development was canceled. While Blizzard and Microsoft have since asserted that the layoffs would have happened with or without their notorious merger, the FTC filed a complaint. Either for gamers, employees, or the regulatory bodies of the world, it&#x27;s a viable point of discussion.
When the podcast is posted on Thursday, you&#x27;ll be able to listen to it on Xbox&#x27;s YouTube channel right here.

Speculation has run rampant about what the event entails amid rumors that several first-party Xbox title are making their way to other platforms, with some believing this event will confirm those reports. On the extreme end, others believe Spencer may announce the end of Xbox as a console platform altogether. According to one report, that may not be the case.
Inverse journalist Shannon Liao reported in her weekly gaming newsletter that Spencer held a company town hall last Tuesday and told employees there are no plans to stop making Xbox consoles. Furthermore, it was stated that “Xboxes would continue to be part of a strategy that involves multiple kinds of devi…</span>

                              <span>The first Tomb Raider was released in 1996, nearly 30 years ago, and in a few days, developer/publisher Aspyr is bringing the original trilogy back with some much-needed upgrades. The controls have been modernized and the games look better, but thankfully, the original versions of the three games are available as part of the package as well. Join Brian Shea and me as we check out the first levels of the three games, discuss what works about them, and where there are some shortcomings.
Tomb Raider I-III Remastered releases for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC, and Switch on February 14.

                              <span>As the creator of the Weight Lifting Simulator series, among others, Christopher Boomer is one of the most successful game developers on Roblox. His games have been played billions of times and there&#x27;s no shortage of copycats demanding a piece of the action. After being hit with a takedown notice, the developer of a similar game responded with a DMCA counter-notice. Boomer&#x27;s follow-up lawsuit shows that the strategy is not without risk.

                              <span>Pirate site-blocking schemes have become more common around the world but there are some notable regional differences. In Egypt, not all rightsholders are happy with the local implementation. According to sports broadcaster beIN, pirate site blocking is privatized in Egypt with the &#x27;licensed&#x27; party requesting a blocking fee that&#x27;s not proportional to what&#x27;s being offered.

                              <span>With the recent Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Volume 1 and the upcoming Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, Hideo Kojima&#x27;s iconic tactical espionage action franchise has been on our minds. And miraculously, somehow, across approximately 588 episodes of Replay, we have never revisited Metal Gear Solid. This week I am happy to correct that monumental mistake.
We will get back to Majora&#x27;s Mask soon (Marcus is out on assignment this week) but we took that opportunity to revisit one of, if not the, best PlayStation games with Metal Gear Solid. It just so happens that Alex Van Aken is playing through the game for fun, so I asked him if we could just jump into his save for an hour. And you know what? It just so happened to be one of the best hours of the whole game. Alex takes out Liquid Snake in the HIND, meets the invisible overweight soldiers, and defeats Sniper Wolf. It&#x27;s a fantastic snapshot of a fantastic game.

                              <span>Whenever a Mario Kart entry arrives, it immediately becomes a must-have on its respective platform, thanks to its universal appeal to gamers of all experience and ability levels. That widespread appeal has translated to sales, as nearly every Mario Kart game ranks near the top of its platform&#x27;s sales chart. But it goes beyond mainstream success; Mario Kart is fun whether you&#x27;re spending the evening alone perfecting a drift around a corner or gathering your closest friends for a marathon session. 
Sure, the rubberband A.I. and the randomization elements are enough to make us want to jump up and down in frustration, but it&#x27;s never quite enough to deter us from driving up to the next starting line.

                              <span>In the first four decades of the Super Mario series, Mario and his friends appeared in hundreds of titles, but in the core &quot;Super Mario&quot; series, the plumber was present in just 22 titles (if you include Lost Levels, Bowser&#x27;s Fury, and Super Mario Run). While the series has some entries that are stronger than others, the Super Mario series doesn’t have a bad entry to date, so this list proved difficult to put together in an order we all felt comfortable with.
In 2018, we ranked the top 300 games of all time in our 300th issue. While that list was more about ranking games in terms of quality, importance to the industry, and cultural relevance, this list is just about our favorite games. So check out our rankings of the 22 core Super Mario games below!

                              <span>Every RPG faithful has that formative experience that turned them into a lifelong fan. But what if you could experience it again for the first time? Or if you could recommend it to those who haven’t played it without needing to explain away the parts that haven’t aged well? In today’s gaming landscape, remasters are common, but we’ve seen an influx of full-on remakes of classic role-playing games in recent years.
While 1990’s Ys I &amp; II is likely the earliest example of remade role-playing games, perhaps the most prominent early examples came in the form of the Pokémon franchise. Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen, 2004 remakes of the series’ debut titles less than a decade after their initial release, showcased the technological leap from original Game Boy to Game Boy Advance. However, when tho…</span>

                              <span>Helskate is a rogue game where you are trying to escape Hell on a skateboard. The game is heavily inspired by the Tony Hawk series, which makes sense as its game director, Steve Swink, worked on Tony Hawk&#x27;s Underground. Join me and Game Informer&#x27;s resident Tony Hawk expert, Blake Hester, as we play a bit of the game, discuss its Tony Hawk overlap, and what sets it apart.
Helskate is entering early access on February 15.

                              <span>Dead Cells was developed and released by Motion Twin in 2018, and in an atypical move in the world of game development, members of that team branched off to form Evil Empire, which in turn supported Dead Cells with new content for many years. Arguably its biggest and most notable expansion was the Return to Castlevania DLC, which added all kinds of Castlevania content to the game.
The developer announced this morning, however, that it is officially time to move on. You can see the developer&#x27;s full statement below.
After 5 years of service, we&#x27;re hanging up the Dead Cells coat. We&#x27;re extremely proud of our work on countless updates &amp; DLC, but now it&#x27;s time for something shiny and new, or maybe more than one thing 😏 More on that very soon...

Along with issuing apologies for any broken controllers related to the Derelict Distillery addition, Evil Empire also shared its appreciation for being able to add so much to Dead Cells. It also wrote, &quot;The good news is that our Dead Cells team have been unleashed to pump their talent into our secret projects, and we&#x27;ll be revealing what their crazy minds have been coming up with very soon!&quot; while also wishing luck to Motion Twin&#x27;s next announced project, Windblown, and teasing perhaps more than one project.

                              <span>Mapleton, Utah, is one of the most idyllic cities imaginable. Its crime rate is 80% below average, and its council operates with complete transparency. Public meetings are streamed live on YouTube, and details of every meeting appear on the city&#x27;s website. That&#x27;s also how we know that the council inexplicably approved a pirate IPTV scheme for residents and local businesses, that would unwittingly render itself an illegal subscription reseller set to profit from them all.

Last year, the district court dismissed the case in favor of the music group, before getting properly started. The dispute is now at the Court of Appeals where YouTube&#x27;s absence in this &quot;big stakes&quot; matter was repeatedly mentioned.

Access real devices with Device Streaming in Android Studio

Device streaming in Android Studio lets you securely connect to remote physical Android devices hosted in Google&#x27;s secure data centers. Powered by Firebase, it&#x27;s the fastest and easiest way to test your app against real devices, including the Google Pixel 8 Pro, Pixel Fold, select Samsung devices, and more.

After connecting to a device, you can deploy your app, view the display, interact with the device (including rotating or unfolding the device), and anything else you might do with a device over a direct ADB over SSL connection—all without leaving Android Studio. When you&#x27;re done using the device, Google wipes all your data and factory resets the device before making it available to another developer.
During Open Alpha, you can use Device Streaming at no cost. To get started simply sign into your Developer account from Android Studio and select a Firebase project. If you don&#x27;t already have a Firebase project, it&#x27;s easy to create one. To learn more, go to Device Streaming in Android Studio.

                              <span>Overwatch 2 has had a rough road following the early success of the first game. That game, which easily earned Game Informer&#x27;s Game of the Year in 2016, started with such promise and a massive, enthusiastic audience, but following the 2019 announcement of Overwatch 2, support for the original Overwatch floundered, and so, too, did the community. Last year&#x27;s release of Overwatch 2&#x27;s PvE elements in its Invasion update pushed the hero shooter back in the right direction, but it didn&#x27;t make the splash Blizzard had hoped for. With Overwatch 2 Season 9, which kicks off next week, Blizzard is making a ton of sweeping behind-the-scenes changes to make the game more approachable for players.

Originally released on the PlayStation 2, Persona 3 was the first game in its series to define its modern formula, combining social responsibilities with dungeon crawling and a lengthy, emotional story. It&#x27;s been re-released multiple times and was even ported to modern consoles last year, but even the upgraded versions don&#x27;t hold a candle to the mind-bending masterpiece that is Persona 5 Royal. Persona 3 Reload closes that gap, however, introducing overhauled visuals and mechanics to bring the game that started it all up to the level of quality fans of the series have come to expect. If the sales numbers and our glowing review are any indication, the upgrade has been well worth the wait.
To put these numbers in context, here are some other games that have recently reached comparable significant milestones: Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth shipped 1 million copies as of Feb 1, Nintendo&#x27;s quarterly report revealed Tears of the Kingdom has sold 20 million copies, and viral hit Palworld continues to smash record after record.

                              <span>Funimation and Crunchyroll, two competing anime streaming services, merged in 2021 and announced in 2022 that all of the content would eventually combine under the Crunchyroll banner. That event officially has a date, and it&#x27;s April 2.
For Funimation subscribers, you will have to go through the process of merging your account before the April 2 date, and, frustratingly, any shows that were outright purchased through Funimation will not transfer to Crunchyroll. Just another reminder that when you purchase digital content, true ownership does not technically exist and you will always be at the mercy of the platform holders when it comes to access.
Crunchyroll subscribers do not need to make any changes, but the price of the subscription will rise to $100 a year soon. The merger officially going through does mean Crunchyroll will feature more content, but a price increase will always be frustrating.
Alongside this merger finally completing, Crunchyroll is also entering the video game space as a publisher. It remains to be seen what kind of video tames the anime company will help produce, but you can check out this package it sent over on Game Informer&#x27;s TikTok account.
As a subscriber to both services who somehow has managed to continue to have a need for both (Outlaw Star is curiously currently only available on Funimation) the merger is bittersweet. I embrace the simplicity of one anime streaming service but don&#x27;t look forward to paying more, and will forever be wary of mergers being a good thing.</span>

                              <span>The Sonic the Hedgehog Movie spinoff series, Knuckles, is premiering April 26, and ahead of its streaming debut, Paramount has released a trailer. The series officially takes place between the second and third movie and will apparently follow Knuckles (Idris Elba) has he helps Wade (Adam Pally), Tom Wachowski&#x27;s (James Marsden) bumbling police partner, become a true warrior. The trailer also reveals the antagonist will be played by Rory McCann, who is best known for playing Sandor &#x27;The Hound&#x27; Clegane in Game of Thrones, and features a two-thirds Human Giant reunion cameo with Rob Huebel and Paul Scheer. Curiously, they&#x27;re sitting at an ESPN8 The Ocho desk, a gag born from the 2004 film Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story that eventually became a real thing.
Other interesting details from the trailer? Jim Carrey does not appear, nor does James Marsden, but both Sonic and Tails appear and are played by film voice actors, Ben Schwarz and Colleen O&#x27;Shaughnessey.


The series, simply titled Knuckles, will be six episodes long and begins streaming on April 26 on Paramount+. For more on the Sonic the Hedgehog Movie universe, you can read our review of the second film here.</span>

The first teaser trailer for Harold Halibut was released seven years ago and was only a minute and a half long, but it immediately grabbed my attention. The footage showed a stop-animated Harold (or what looked stop-animated) cleaning up graffiti in an underwater facility. The striking visuals inspired a thought I don’t often have – how did they do that? It was my first question for game director Ole Tillmann and art director Onat Hekimoglu when I recently spoke with them.

The game continues to impress with each passing look, earning its spot as the &quot;Most Anticipated Game&quot; at The Game Awards 2023.
The world of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is broken into various regions, which seamlessly blend into one another. After the intro sequence, players enter into the Grasslands, a grassy area south of Midgar. From there, you travel to Junon, a vast open area in the shadow of Shinra&#x27;s military; this area also features chocobos that can climb up cliffsides. The game also includes Corel, which features the touristy beach town of Costa del Sol, the massive playground known as Gold Saucer, and the dusty portion of the region to…</span>

It&#x27;s no secret that I&#x27;ve spent a lot of time playing, seeing, talking about, and writing about Final Fantasy VII Rebirth. Having traveled to Japan to spend two days in Square Enix&#x27;s Tokyo headquarters with demos and interviews, then reporting on it through our previous issue&#x27;s cover story and subsequent exclusive coverage hub, I already had an idea that I would be a fan of what Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, the second entry in the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy, brings to the table. However, after coming out of the hours-long gameplay session and another conversation with director Naoki Hamag…</span>

                              <span>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth continues to look fantastic. During today&#x27;s PlayStation State of Play devoted to the upcoming exclusive title, we got a new look at various impactful scenes set to take place in this retelling of the middle portion of the Final Fantasy VII Remake series. 
The footage in this trailer shows off various scenes we haven&#x27;t yet witnessed and characters we&#x27;ve seen very little of. The main thrust is Sephiroth&#x27;s quest for the Black Materia and the party&#x27;s efforts to save the world. As you might imagine, it&#x27;s all set to the amazing soundtrack fans have come to expect from the game.
You can check out this cinematic trailer below.


Final Fantasy VII Rebirth arrives on February 29 exclusively for PlayStation 5. For more, be sure to check out our in-depth coverage hub here.</span>

                              <span>Project Orion is still a deeply mysterious game. We know it is a follow-up to Cyberpunk 2077, we know CD Projekt Red is developing the game in North America (Boston, specifically) as opposed to Poland where the main studio is based, and eventually development will expand to Vancouver, with support from the main Polish headquarters. Beyond those details, we don&#x27;t know much. Implications from CD Projekt point to it being a sequel, but it could be a spin-off, or something entirely different. Of note, Project Orion was a study from the 50s and 60s about the viability of nuclear power for space travel. Maybe that&#x27;s what CD Projekt&#x27;s Cyberpunk 2077 follow-up will be about.
We may not know much about the game, but based on a press release from CD Projekt this morning, we now know some of the folks who will be working on it. Dan Hernberg is now a Project Orion executive producer who was head of production at Amazon Games, and also has history at Panic Button and Blizzard Entertainment.  Ryan Barnard was a game director at Massive Entertainment and Ubisoft, but perhaps most notably, was the gameplay director at Hitman for developer IO Interactive. Barnard is joining Project Orion as a design director. Alan Villani is now an engineering director on Project Orion and worked on several Mortal Kombat titles. Anna Megill is a Project Orion lead writer with history on titles like Control, Dishonored: Death of The Outsider, Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, Guild Wars 2, and the upcoming Fable from Playground Games. Alexander Freed is an additional writer on Project Orion and is a New York Times bestselling novelist and comic book writer who previously worked at Bioware on Star Wars: The Old Republic and more.
We&#x27;re eager to learn more about Project Orion, but suspect it will be some time before we do. For more on Cyberpunk 2077, follow the link to read Game Informer&#x27;s review of Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty. You can also read about how CD Projekt has no interest in being acquired here.</span>

                              <span>Nintendo has released its latest quarterly sales numbers, and they are overall expectedly impressive considering 2023 saw the releases of new mainline Zelda and Mario games. But Pikmin 4 and Super Mario RPG, the remake of the 1996 Super Nintendo game, also delivered some notable sales numbers.
You can find the full report here, but here are the notable highlights:
The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom has sold 20.28 million copies since its launch on May 12, 2023
Pikmin 4 has sold 3.33 million copies since its launch on July 21, 2023
Super Mario Bros Wonder has sold 11.96 million copies since its launch on October 20, 2023
Super Mario RPG has sold 3.14 million copies since its launch on November 17, 2023
Other highlights, found here, include Switch hardware sales, which have reached 139.36 million units. It&#x27;s also always interesting to watch the list of best-selling Switch games, which you can find here. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is still king, now boasting 60.58 million units sold. Animal Crossing: New Horizons is in a distant second with 44.79 million units sold and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is in third with 33.67 million units sold. The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Super Mario Odyssey take fourth and fifth place, respectively.
Nintendo also confirmed what we all suspected, writing in its report, &quot;The Super Mario Bros. Movie, released in April, had a positive impact on sales of Mario related titles. As a result, there were 24 titles that sold over a million copies during the period, including titles from other software publishers.&quot; It also mentions in the report that Super Mario Bros. Wonder is the fastest-selling Super Mario title to date.

Years ago, when I first heard about the provocative title for Rocksteady’s follow-up to the Arkham games, I recall wondering what mental gymnastics were in store to not actually murder the well-liked central characters of the DC mythos, including the version of Batman the studio had so expertly developed over prior titles. Credit where it’s due: Rocksteady followed through, and Kill the Justice League does just that. Unfortunately, it also killed my interest or enthusiasm through a story that feels juvenile and…</span>

                              <span>Microsoft had a strong start to 2024 thanks to their Developer Direct Showcase, but it sounds like we&#x27;ll get even more information on what the gaming giant is up to very soon. Head of Xbox Phil Spencer gathered the attention of gamers everywhere this afternoon with a post announcing an upcoming &quot;business update event.&quot; You can see the post for yourself below.
We&#x27;re listening and we hear you. We&#x27;ve been planning a business update event for next week, where we look forward to sharing more details with you about our vision for the future of Xbox. Stay tuned.
February 5, 2024
The post itself doesn&#x27;t have any concrete details on what to expect, but there&#x27;s a likely subject. Just this morning, The Verge reported that Indiana Jones and The Great Circle, one of Xbox&#x27;s biggest first-party games of the year, might be headed to PlayStation after a short exclusivity window. Combined with other recent rumors, like Hi-Fi Rush and Starfield coming to other platforms, it seems like Xbox might be loosening its grip on its exclusive games. That said, Spencer didn&#x27;t give us any idea as to what the announcement would be about, so we&#x27;ll have to wait until next week to know for sure.
For more on Xbox&#x27;s plans for the coming year, check out some of the reveals from the Developer Direct, like Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Visions of Mana, and Avowed.

                              <span>OpenTTD turns 20 this year, and to celebrate we are preparing for one of our largest ever releases. It’s packed with 40 new features, 80 changes, and almost 150 fixes. In the upcoming weeks we will share more posts explaining some of these features in depth. For now, we need your help testing our work. We need as many people as possible to test this beta version of the 14.X release series, so you can find and we can squash as many bugs as possible before the actual release. To guide you a bit towards what you should be looking for: Generic gameplay bugs and crashes. There is a new Ship Pathfinder; test it out. Buoys are optional to use. You can now automatically unbunch your vehicles at a depot. We added our own interpretation of daylength to the game. More on this soon in another blog post. There are many GUI improvements throughout the game. More consistent look, better GUI scaling. There are many more things worth talking about, and this will be made more clear when we approach the release of 14.0. But for now, play the game, and please report any issues you find. The usual titlegame competition has also been announced on the forums. See the page for the exact competition rules if you are interested. Download Changelog Bug tracker</span>
