                              <span>When I zoom the camera on Alex&#x27;s momentarily untensed face while he&#x27;s dozing by the pool, it&#x27;s not because I&#x27;m a creep. When I pursue Ayo and Dija around the garden, keeping their feet and butts in shot as they belittle each other, it&#x27;s not because I&#x27;m a busybody and a lech. And when I pan to the lighthouse piercing the sunset beyond the security spikes, it&#x27;s not out of any feeling of wonder, or even curiosity about possible escape routes. Please understand: I do not see these people, these objects at all, just the boneless, faceless traces they leave upon my own servitude to the lens.

                              <span>The first Splitgate was a cracker mash-up of Halo multiplayer gunfights and Portal&#x27;s nifty spacetime windows. It was a gimmick that made flanking fun again, at least until you died to a distant rifle that was right next to you all along. Its sequel, Splitgate 2 is continuing that gimmick but is also sprucing up the free-to-play arena shooter with a few modern additions, like bum-sliding around corners and big deployable bubbles called &quot;time domes&quot; that slow down your enemies yet speed up your allies. All this and more comes from a gameplay trailer that went up yesterday.

                              <span>The new God Of War duology has my favourite snow in gaming. I can take or leave about 60% of everything else in them, but lawdy, that snow! In God Of War Ragnarok, the action kicks off a during the apocalyptic fimbulwinter, which is probably bad for some characters I don’t care about, but it is good for me personally, because there’s a lot of snow to play with.
How much snow, you ask? 190 flippin’ gigs worth, apparently, according to Sony’s system requirements.

                              <span>Yesterday, Nic took James and I on a tour of Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2&#x27;s co-op campaign. A merry old time was had, romping through fortress cities like a small herd of crusader buffalo, using the game&#x27;s absurd jetpack functionality to pancake invading Tyranids, and getting our screens so slathered in gore we couldn&#x27;t work out who was killing what.
It looks like the gargantuan action game&#x27;s PvP multiplayer will be even messier. Saber and Focus Home have released an extended trailer that walks you through two major modes - the PvE boss and wave-slaying frenzy of Operations, and the 12-player PvP carnage of Eternal War, which spans a range of match types. The ecstasy of dying for the Emperor aside, both give me frightful flashbacks to the early days of Gears Of War.

                              <span>It is a Thursday morning, and I&#x27;m prepping myself for the TV production equivalent of a triathlon. I will be running, leaping, squatting, and all other manner of athletically maneuvering around the small reality TV set of The Crush House, following four would-be stars as they fight and fall in love. Maybe a bit of both.


My goal, as intrepid producer Jae, is to film it all. But really, I&#x27;m not looking for the specific moments you might normally seek out; I&#x27;m looking for the right framing, the proper angles, and the perfect shots to appease my audience. It&#x27;s this aspect that makes The Crush House fascinating, and also a bit frustrating.

Before you can get some Underseaweed, you’ll need to do a couple of things:



Unlock the Mines and reach floor 20


Break through the Water Seal to get to floor 21



Once you’ve done these two things, you’ll have access to Tide Caverns, which make up floors 21 to 40 of the Mines. Down here, you’ll be able to get Underseaweed, which is a green leafy plant that can be found in the water pools on these levels.

Underseaweed is, first and foremost, an item which should be donated to the Museum as part of the Tide Caverns collection in the Flora Wing. After you’ve done this, you’ll unlock a unique conversational moment with Terithia. 


Secondly, you should keep some Underseaweed as a gift for Valen. While her loved gifts mostly consist of meals which require multiple ingredients, Underseaweed is one of her liked gifts, so is an easy option if you’re trying to get more hearts with her. 


Other than these two primary uses, you can also use Underseaweed in the following recipes, which you’ll unlock upon shipping one of the ingredients included in the recipe:

God of War Ragnarok minimum PC specs


To get God of War Ragnarok running at 1080p (30 FPS) on Low settings, you&#x27;ll need the following:

It&#x27;s a hefty step up from the last game, which required a 4GB graphics card and recommended a 6GB one. The game also needs an additional 110GB …</span>

The bow, Fortunate Star, can roll with perks that make it uniquely suited for Void players as one example. Given that other legendary bows are good for both Solar and Arc, they help complete the set. 


One other weapon can make for a great budget version of the solar rocket launcher Apex Predator. Here&#x27;s the god roll for the Crowning Duologue rocket launcher in Destiny 2.

Whether you&#x27;re spending big on the AWP or managing your money with an MP9, there&#x27;s a way to win every single round of Counter-Strike. Valve very rarely shakes up the CS2 weapon meta, meaning it&#x27;s unlikely you&#x27;ll see too much change in this Tier List in the future.


We&#x27;ve divided our Counter-Strike 2 weapons Tier List into two separate lists: primaries and secondaries. The nature of the game means it&#x27;s impossible to directly compare the two. Sure, players using an AK-47 or a Desert Eagle can both win a round all by themselves, but those with the sidearm have much less of a chance of actually making it happen.

While the actual content of the event has mostly stayed the same over the last six years, the main prize, a cosmetic set of Solstice armor, has only gotten more convoluted to earn.

                              <span>Riot Games has begun inviting players to participate in its 2XKO Alpha Lab test. If you&#x27;re interested and want to join the action, here&#x27;s how you can secure your spot in the test.


How to join the 2XKO Alpha Lab


For now, there are only two methods to join the ongoing 2XKO Alpha Lab test, and unfortunately, both rely on a degree of luck.


Receive an Invitation


The simplest way is to have Riot Games directly invite you. To be considered, though, you must have a Riot Account and sign up for the test on the official 2XKO website, if you haven&#x27;t already. Make sure your account is using a verified e-mail, otherwise you won&#x27;t be able to complete the next step.

Once you register for the 2XKO Alpha Lab test, you&#x27;ll receive an interest survey in the e-mail you used. This survey must be completed to be considered for the test. When you&#x27;re done, the final step is to wait for Riot to invite you. Should you receive an invite, it will also come in the registered e-mail, providing you the opportunity to choose your preferred platform to participate. 


Recieve a Friend Referral 


The other way you can join the 2XKO test is by friend referral. Some of those who were invited to the 2XKO test also received a referral invite they could use to bring someone else into the test. If one of these players sends you a referral, you can play in the 2XKO Alpha Lab test without a Riot invitation. To be clear, this referral is not a key. It is a literal link you must click on. Only those with a Riot Account can use it to download and play in the test.


Unfortunately, there are no other known methods for joining the 2XKO Alpha Lab test, so you&#x27;ll probably need to wait for an invite from Riot to get a chance to play it. The Alpha Lab test officially began on August 8 and will run until August 19. Currently, the test is only available on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and Windows PC.

                              <span>While wandering around in Fields of Mistria, you’ve likely noticed the Chicken Statue close to Hayden’s house on Sweetwater Farm. This statue is mysterious and, for the most part, appears to be decorative, but it’s actually really useful. 


I can’t tell you the things I tried in order to interact with this Chicken Statue. I love chickens in general, so of course, I was drawn to the statue from day one. It couldn’t be merely decorative, it was too conspicuous! In the end, I discovered its use by accident one day when my chickens got into my crops, ate my Brocolli, and produced some Shiny Beads from an unknown orifice.

                              <span>Through Valorant Night Market, you can get certain cosmetics or even melee weapons for a discounted price. We have the dates for Episode 9 Act 1, and here&#x27;s everything you need to know.


Night Market arrives towards the end of every Valorant Act and is the ideal time to get your favorite skins. Although luck plays a major role in what skins you actually get as the drops are Random Number Generator-based (RNG), which means it&#x27;s totally random.


Next Valorant Night Market date and schedule


The next Valorant Night Market (for Episode 9 Act 1) will commence on August 15 and ends on August 28, 2024. The current Act also ends on the same day.


Historically, they have gone live at 8 PM ET / 2 AM CET / 1 AM BST / 5:30 AM IST, and you can expect it to be the same this time around. This gives you 13 days in total to get your desired skins at a discounted price.




How many skins do you get and can you reroll them?


You get six skins for different weapons in total, and the discounts range from 10% to 49%. As we mentioned earlier, the occurrences are completely random.


You also can&#x27;t reroll these skins and will remain the same as long as the Market is live for this Act. So, in case you didn&#x27;t get your desired cosmetics this time, unfortunately, you&#x27;ll need to wait for the next one to arrive with the hope of better skins.


When was the first Night Market in Valorant?


The first Night Market took place when Episode 1 Act 3 went live, back in December 2020. The one we are getting in Episode 9 Act 1 will be the 23rd iteration of the Night Market in the game.


Now that you know about the next Night Market date, take a look at all the maps you can play in the current competitive rotation.

                              <span>If you&#x27;re wondering whether your PC is powerful enough to take part in the Delta Force: Hawk Ops alpha test, we&#x27;ve listed its minimum and recommended system requirements for you.


Delta Force: Hawk Ops is the latest free-to-play game in the franchise that&#x27;s having an Alpha test right now that started on August 6, 2024.

Delta Force: Hawk Ops minimum system requirements


Here are the minimum specs you must have to play the game at 1080p30fps:



OS: Windows 10 64-bit


CPU: Intel Core i3-4150 / AMD FX-6300


Memory: 12 GB RAM


GPU/Graphics Card: NVIDIA Geforce GTX 960 / AMD R9 380 / Intel Arc A380


DirectX: Version 12


Storage: 50 GB available space



Delta Force: Hawk Ops recommended specs


If you want to gain all the competitive advantage and want to push to 1080p144fps perhaps, you must have these specs in your system:



OS: Windows 10 64-bit


CPU: Intel Core i5-6500 / AMD Ryzen 5 1500x


Memory: 16 GB RAM


GPU/Graphics Card: NVIDIA Geforce GTX 1060 5G / AMD RX5500 XT / Intel Arc A580


DirectX: Version 12


Storage: 50 GB available space



It goes without saying, but if your PC has better specifications than these, you&#x27;ll get much better frames at higher resolutions. But looking at the specs provided by the devs, it&#x27;s not as demanding as some other new games in the market.


These system requirements are listed on the game&#x27;s Steam page. Since Delta Force: Hawk Ops is still in the alpha phase, the final PC requirements may change upon full release. In case that happens, we&#x27;ll update this page with the updated info.

                              <span>If you&#x27;ve been trotting around the lands of Mistria, you&#x27;ve likely stumbled across a peculiar insect inside the water. Then, once you try to approach it, the bug hastily runs away to avoid you at all costs. It&#x27;s tricky to do, but fortunately, a specific technique can guarantee its capture. So, let&#x27;s dive into how to catch Pond Skater in Fields of Mistria.


How to get Pond Skater in Fields of Mistria


To get Pond Skater in Fields of Mistria, stand by the water&#x27;s edge and patiently wait for it to come to you. No matter how many times you attempt to approach, the insect will always scuttle away when too near. Therefore, it&#x27;s best to remain in the same spot, where it will eventually come to you.

The first Pond Skater I caught bounced around like a maniac for a minute or so until it finally got close enough for the capture. Though, it&#x27;s easier said than done, considering that you must time your bug net swing at the opportune moment. Don&#x27;t worry if you miss it the first time or even the second time around. The process takes a while to master, but it should eventually work in your favor.


Be aware that the Pond Skater is not present during the Winter season. Luckily, it can be found during all the other seasons, providing you with ample time to practice and prepare for its capture.


There&#x27;s not a whole lot you can do with the Pond Skater in Fields of Mistria. The insect won&#x27;t be needed for museum donations, nor does it sell for much profit (only 15 T). However, it does come up as a villager&#x27;s request for extra Tesserae and gifts.

Coinciding with their locales, the fantastical sport will also have two stadiums based on the magical regions. 


The PlayStation Blog revealed the inclusion of the schools in Quidditch Champions, and this is the first time we&#x27;re seeing their Quidditch pitches. 


&quot;Of course, a large part of the inspiration came directly from the Goblet of Fire film, which gives us the only visual glimpse into the students and cultures of two of the greatest magical schools in Europe,&quot; said creative director Farren Fox. &quot;It left us wondering, how would students from these schools approach Quidditch?&quot;

Note also that this list excludes dice-adjacent systems, such as replacing dice with special decks of cards that provide the exact same feature. These games are for those who want to be in control of their turns throughout the game for maximum strategic capabilities.

                              <span>It didn&#x27;t take long at all for Raphael Colantonio&#x27;s WolfEye Games to show off a bit more about their upcoming immersive sim, as promised mere days ago. Now, while we don&#x27;t have the title just yet, we do have a wealth of other information, and the alpha is coming.


In a recent interview with Eurogamer, Colantonio talked about the game at some length, revealing that it&#x27;s set in an alternative 1900s America, and it&#x27;s using the Wild West backdrop to create something new and essentially unrecognizable: 


&quot;I think the big distinction we&#x27;re making here is, as far as genre literature goes, this is more like sci-fi literature than it is Wild West or whatever,&quot; Colantonio told Eurogamer. &quot;I think the Western is a genre of literature that people associate with certain types of scenarios like reveng…</span>

                              <span>Prior to the release of Dawntrail, Final Fantasy XIV implemented a new European probationary Data Center called Shadow. Apparently, this Data Center has served its purpose and is now set to be shut down on August 27. 


The Data Center was introduced in order to ease congestion during the early access period and official launch of Dawntrail and it definitely seems to have done just that. Dawntrail had an incredibly smooth launch with little existence of long queue times, something which was unexpected though very welcome for anyone who was around for the release of Endwalker.


If you’ve been using the Shadow Data Center to play since Dawntrail released, Square Enix are urging you to return back to your home world before August 27, and travel to the Data Center will no longer be possible after August 16.

Don’t worry if you don’t manage to login and return to your home world prior to the removal of Shadow, your character won’t be lost to the Aether. All characters still on any of the following worlds will automatically be returned to their home world once the Data Center is shut down:



Innocence


Pixie


Titania


Tycoon



There will be a short maintenance period on August 27 in order to remove the Shadow Data Center, so the game will be inaccessible for all players during this time. More information about this maintenance will be released closer to the time via the Lodestone.

I didn&#x27;t mind it personally, but according to director Glen Schofield, the team was under pressure to deliver ahead of schedule.


In a recent video from Dan Allen Gaming, the titular host sits down with Schofield to discuss his pretty lengthy career in the industry. One thing that did crop up in conversation was the development problems of The Callisto Protocol. That specific topic begins around the 12:32 mark in the below video.




Without mincing words, when asked whether more time was needed to complete the game, Schofield replies – with slightly tired eyes – &quot;yes, I did.&quot; He goes on to then say he wanted another three and a half m…</span>

Notably, the creator of the widely acclaimed Sim Settlements mod for Fallout 4 is creating a Doom-themed quest for Starfield.


Kinggath made a name for themselves when Sim Settlements became a bit of a must-have for any settlement-focused Fallout 4 player. The majority of their mods for Fallout 4 since have been at least somewhat oriented toward making settlements better, too, but their first Starfield mod is going in a wholly different direction, porting some of the key content from the recent Doom games. Specifically, what little material Kinggath has already made available shows off a bevy of iconic goodies fro…</span>

                              <span>Taking down the Rocket Leaders each month is the joy of being a trainer. Here’s how to defeat Cliff in Pokémon  Go in August 2024. 


How to defeat Cliff in Pokémon GO 


Cliff is essentially a slab of muscle, and so are his Pokémon with their high defense. But don’t think you won’t need a strategy to bring him down. To find Cliff in Pokémon Go, you must use a Rocket Radar to narrow down his location. Defeat Team Rocket Grunts, who will be marked with a TR balloon, and collect six Mysterious Components for the device.  


You can then use the Rocket Radar to show Cliff&#x27;s whereabouts on the map. Like other bosses, he can appear at PokéStops or Team Rocket balloons. Sometimes, you can run into other enemies while there, so Cliff isn&#x27;t always guaranteed. 


Although Cliff&#x27;s Pokémon lineup has…</span>

The next Splatfest is only hours away, and in this humble writer&#x27;s opinion, it&#x27;s one of the hardest ones to pick a team for. Like, how dare someone put carbs against carbs?

If you’re a puzzle fan who wants something unique to add to your library, you’re in for a treat. The Lullaby of Life is a sound-based puzzle experience which places you in the blobby shoes of a particle with the ability to create music, exploring the origins of the universe.
At first glance, this game is striking. The aesthetic is vibrant and psychedelic, with seven different chapters, each revolving around a new celestial body and all with their own unique visuals, quirks, and styles of puzzle. Some may require you to work on timing, while others may test your ability to spot hidden paths.

                              <span>Here&#x27;s how to save £26!
The very first Legend of Zelda LEGO set is just weeks away from release, with the Great Deku Tree 2-in-1 shipping from 1st September. After initially selling out rather quickly, pre-orders are once again available with some new options appearing courtesy of the My Nintendo Store UK &amp; Ireland.
The set – which contains 2,500 pieces and four brand-new Minifigures – can be bought on its own from the My Nintendo Store at its regular retail price of £259.99 / $299.99. However, should you also want a copy of the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, which we imagine most Zelda fans probably do, you can order both to take 10% off the Great Deku Tree&#x27;s cost.

                              <span>Serie A&#x27;s bid to force Cloudflare to participate in Piracy Shield, Italy&#x27;s pirate IPTV blocking system, has failed. The Italian football league filed a legal complaint in April, claiming that Cloudflare assists and protects pirate services. In a decision handed down this week, the Court of Milan said that it has no legal authority to compel Cloudflare to join the program. The Court also denied Serie A&#x27;s application for an injunction, for reasons that suggest this battle may not be over.

                              <span>Video games offer some spectacular narrative experiences, but every once in a while, a game&#x27;s story needs a little bit more room to breathe, and some stories find that through novelizations. 


Some of my favorite video game franchises hide their coolest story moments in tie-in novels and short stories. Because of that, I long ago started exploring literature attached to my favorite games. Changing mediums is always a risk, but it turns out that some video game novels are actually pretty spectacular in and of themselves.

                              <span>When fighting against the anti-democratic tyranny from Terminids and Automatons, it&#x27;s important to know how difficulties work in Helldivers 2. The early missions ease you into the game as you learn how to face your foes. But things can get hairy the higher you go.


There are ten difficulties in Helldivers 2. You begin at Difficulty 1 - Trivial when you graduate the tutorial with your first cape. Trivial missions are often straightforward, teaching you the basics and pitting you against only small groups of foes. It&#x27;s a stark contrast to Difficulty 9, in which most divers learn the true meaning of diving into Hell.

All Roblox The Games event quests and how to complete them 


Most Roblox The Games quests require exchanging Shines via the Event Tracker section. That means you must grind a bit to collect enough currency for certain items. For a quick overview of how to complete all Roblox The Games quests, here&#x27;s what you can do:

Boosters are passive buffs you can get and equip in Helldivers 2, and they&#x27;re worth the price.


Boosters can be unlocked in Helldivers 2 via Warbonds (the game&#x27;s version of seasonal content). They&#x27;re not exactly cheap, with some appearing as exclusive Premium Warbond unlocks. But you should consider unlocking them as soon as you can, as they can be a great boon for you and your team. As mentioned, Boosters are passive buffs you can equip. They range from boosting your radar range to improving health or stamina.

Bare Butt Boxing from publisher and developer Tuatara Games makes a good first impression with its quirky character avatars, colorful maps, and cheeky premise. Though the title delivers knockabout fun and floaty arena combat chaos, the overall experience is a rather shallow one and not exactly the ‘Punch-Out!! With Your Arse Out’ concept we were primed for.
Players choose from one of six alien fighters to control and pummel each other across a variety of maps. You’ll find no traditional boxing rings here, but rather some uniquely designed environments containing portals that swallow anybody knocked into them as well as holes and gaps that send you hurling off the stage only to respawn a moment later.

Square Enix has revealed more details on Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake, which include the new story sections that are being introduced in the remake and an overview of the world.
Shared on Famitsu (via Gematsu), Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake will feature &quot;several new scenes&quot; that will focus on Ortega, who is the protagonist&#x27;s father. Ortega is a hero in his own right and the one who attempted to slay the archfiend Baramos before your character. The intro of the NES and Game Boy versions of the game show Ortega&#x27;s battle atop a volcano, where he meets his end.

Rainbow Arts&#x27; Rendering Ranger: R² is one of the rarest Super Famicom games in existence, but thanks to a partnership between Ziggurat Interactive and Limited Run Games, it&#x27;s now heading to the Switch and will launch this Winter.
Although initially announced back in 2022, Ziggurat and Limited Run have been fairly quiet on the release since then, but fans can finally get their hands on either a digital version or physical edition later this year, bringing a swift end to the title&#x27;s long-running scarcity. Originally released in Japan in 1995, only 10,000 copies were made and it quickly became one of the most sought-after console games of all time.

Powerful Pro Baseball 2024-25 once again finds itself at the top, but One Piece Odyssey suffers a significant drop in sales to land at number nine this week, leaving the likes of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Animal Crossing: New Horizons, and Luigi&#x27;s Mansion 2 HD to enjoy higher positions in the top ten.

Switch eShop - Highlights
SteamWorld Heist II (Thunderful, 8th Aug, $29.99) - Get ready for an epic adventure on the high seas in this sequel to the critically-acclaimed SteamWorld Heist game! All is not well on the waves of the Great Sea – the waters are turning corrosive and eating away at the metal bodies of its robotic denizens. As the captain of a rag-tag crew of Steambots, you’ll lead the way through intense turn-based gunfights, where bullets can ricochet with deadly precision. This time around, there’s a world-map to explore, but be careful – there are no turns to take on the Great Sea, so you’ll have to engage in real-time naval combat against enemy vessels. Also new for this sequel is a job system with in-depth character customization options. With more than 150 weapons, utility items and ship equipment pieces, you can strategically craft your crew to best fit the mission at hand.

Radical Fish Games, the German developer behind the excellent Zelda-style action RPG CrossCode, has officially revealed its next project — Alabaster Dawn.
Previously known as Project Terra and teased multiple times on Twitter, the developer confirmed that its follow-up to its 2018 debut will be coming to Steam Early Access in 2025. Console releases are planned, but unspecified; however, given that CrossCode eventually hit all platforms, including Switch, we&#x27;re pretty hopeful we&#x27;ll be playing this on the Switch successor.

We love it when classic NES / Famicom games just seem to prance onto the Switch eShop with no prior warning (though we just happened to miss the warning for this one - cheers, Time Extension). This time, two classic Jaleco games have made their way onto the hybrid console courtesy of publisher City Connection: Pinball Quest and Yokai Club, both developed by Tose.
For those unfamiliar, Jaleco was a prominent force in the days of the Famicom, putting out dozens of console and arcade titles as far back as 1982. It would eventually go on to file bankruptcy in 2014 and its assets subsequently transfered over to City Connection. And now here we are!

                              <span>Across the multiverse.
We had high hopes for Trinity Fusion after playing it at PAX East two years ago, and we’re happy to say, it doesn’t disappoint. The concept is great. A human-made multiverse — made up of Prime, the Overworld, the Underworld, and the Hyperworld — is collapsing, and the only way to fix it is to merge all of the different worlds back together.
You play as three different versions, called counterselves, of a woman named Maya: Altara, Kera, and Naira. Each comes from a different world and has different abilities. Altara has access to unique ranged weapons thanks to her prosthetic arm and a double jump. Naira can wall jump. And Kera can launch enemies into the air and perform air combos. Everything’s better with air combos.

                              <span>Be super duper quick.
A little while back, Retro Game Books offered up an unofficial Metroid pixel art eBook for absolutely nothing. The deal was valid for an exceptionally limited time, so if you happened to miss out, then you&#x27;re in luck. As announced by creator Brian Riggsbee on social media, the Pixel Art Metroid eBook is free once again.
You&#x27;ll need to be pretty quick, though, as the offer, which is to coincide with the 38th anniversary of the original NES title, is only applicable until 9th August at 11:59pm PT (so that&#x27;s 10th August at 07:59am BST for those in the UK).

Last month, we reported on the rather sad news that Mushihimesama, the wonderful bullet-hell shmup from developer Cave, would soon be delisted from the Switch eShop.
Well folks, there isn&#x27;t much time left. Mushihimesama will disappear from the digital storefront later this week on 10th August 2024. If you&#x27;re on the fence about whether to pick it up before it vanishes into the ether, then perhaps a cool 50% discount will push you over the edge.

                              <span>Here&#x27;s what the critics had to say.
The live-action Borderlands movie arrives in cinemas this week and the first impressions are now being shared online. We&#x27;ve rounded up some of these posts to see how it&#x27;s being received so far.
Admittedly, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be going down very well, with some suggesting it could be the &quot;worst movie&quot; of 2024, but there are some more positive reactions floating about. This new adventure features an all-star cast made up of Cate Blanchett, Jamie Lee Curtis, Kevin Hart, and Jack Black as Claptrap.

Or was &quot;Purr-ibean&quot; the initiating pun? I feel that the action-RPG sequel had to begin with one of wordplay or another, given that its Steam page boasts that it also has &quot;furr-ocious spells&quot; and &quot;gla-meow-rous costumes&quot;.

It&#x27;s also claws-out now on Steam, which has me feline fine.

                              <span>You&#x27;re a long time undead. 7 Days To Die was shuffling along in early access for 11 years, until version 1.0 finally burst through the windows. In that time, many other survival games have sprouted, blossomed, and gently faded away. I first visited the burnt-out ruins of this zombie-infested world a decade ago and I returned to it this week to find a tree-puncher that, despite bearing the pockmarks of early access, retains much of what made it enjoyable back when the survival genre was still wearing its baby onesie. Instead of a review, I figured I&#x27;d scribble together a mini starter guide for new (or returning) players. Partly because the game is a proper time sink and it was taking me so long to get through everything. But mostly because I wanted to use that numberful headline. So, here you go: 7 dos and 7 don&#x27;ts in 7 Days To (7) Die.

                              <span>I was partial to a scrappy little strategy game even before idiot billionaires doomed the planet, and the UK to brain-steaming heat just when you thought we&#x27;d escape it this year. Khaligrad is plenty scrappy. Its edges are rough and you have to figure it out yourself, but it&#x27;s more intuitive than it appears, and easy to operate once you discern some basics. It&#x27;s scrappy too in that it&#x27;s, well. It&#x27;s Stalingrad. Not really: its world is so fictional it&#x27;s their 15th century. But the invaders are explicitly fascists and the defenders communists embroiled in a long and brutal semi-guerrilla city war with World War 2 technology. Thankfully, it&#x27;s stripped of any actual fashy or genocidal play-acting beyond each side doing &quot;hail the empire/union&quot; bits as a sign off.
I think that&#x27;s why, despite its brutal and difficult setting, it&#x27;s this year&#x27;s entry in the long tradition of Low-Intensity Strategy Games For When Hot Why Hot Please Stop You Cannot See My Begging Tears For They Evaporate.

                              <span>WolfEye&#x27;s debut game Weird West attempted to pack a little of Dishonored&#x27;s immersive sim sorcery into a top-down action-RPG. For the studio&#x27;s next game, co-founders Raphaël Colantonio and Julien Roby are leaning into comparisons with their old endeavours at Arkane more earnestly. The new game - currently untitled and without a release date - is a first-person sci-fi RPG set in an alternate-1900s North America, which ostensibly combines the ingenuity and gadgetry of Dishonored and Prey with a &quot;real RPG&quot; experience redolent of Skyrim and modern-day Fallout.

Reduced score means I can squeeze in another card for more healing. If I can pull my Tarot card, I&#x27;ll deal damage with each heal, and I’ve already pulled two scratch cards for yet more quick damage. Now, if I can just pull a Jack, I can plonk down the King Of Space And Time for a brutal finisher. That’ll transfer everything on my side over to my opponent’s, forcing a bust for a nice final chunk of hurt and…

                              <span>Spaceship likers, come hither. Long-running space sim Elite Dangerous has just unloaded a new interstellar vessel into its universe, and she&#x27;s a beaut. The new Type-8 Transporter is a medium freighter capable of hauling a maximum of 406 tons of cargo. It&#x27;s got a default jump range of 17.55 light years and two big prongs sticking out of its face like a sci-fi forklift. Cool. The catch is that this ship can only be bought with real money for now, say the developers. This is part of Frontier&#x27;s new strategy of having paid-for ships in the game. I don&#x27;t really play Elite Dangerous anymore, so I don&#x27;t have strong feelings about that. But I do have strong feelings about the space trucker advertisement the developer has put together for the new ship. Come watch it with me.

                              <span>I’d initially assumed that puzzle game Sliding Hero counts was a Sokoban-like, until I realised that it’s actually you, not endless boxes, that do the sliding here. Still, I wasn’t entirely convinced. The only thing that’s fun to slide back-and-forth indefinitely is a lounging cat on a smooth kitchen worktop. Still, after messing around with Sliding Hero’s Steam demo, I think this one might have much longer legs than its restrictive-sounding concept suggests. All the better to endlessly slide with.

Do I let it spin on forever, a gleaming machine of prosperity bathed in an eternal twilight, or do I, as the case may be, unleash a horde of voluptuous hellwomen to gather spirit energy for the resurrection of my tragically slain beloved? If you picked option B you should probably play My Lovely Empress, a plush empire management sim with a dastardly twist, from Indonesian team GameChanger Studio. Find a trailer below.

                              <span>It is I, the wound salter. The injury insult adder. Life By You, the simulation life-em-up from Paradox, was canceled in June after being delayed indefinitely. The day after the cancellation - which Paradox CEO Fredrik Wester implied was down to a “lacking”, unfixable development state - designer Willem Delventhal spoke about his time at the subsequently shuttered Paradox Tectonic. He claimed the team spent a month “in purgatory” prior to being told of the game’s cancelation and studio shuttering two weeks before launch, despite being told by higher-ups that work was “exceeding expectations.”
We’ve now got another look at a game we’ll likely never get, thanks to a thread by Twxbbly user SimMattically collating unseen screenshots from portfolios by several artists who worked on Life By You.

                              <span>The IIPA, which represents the MPA, RIAA, and other entertainment industry groups, believes that Canada could and should do more to tackle online piracy. The association argues that anti-piracy efforts, in the broadest sense, should be prioritized. In addition, copyright exceptions that, by IIPA&#x27;s standards, grant the public too much freedom, should be scrapped.

                              <span>ODDADA is a music maker where every level looks like a colourful toy, some shaped like towers, or landscapes, or old factories. By stacking blocks, twisting knobs and clicking chunky buttons, you create your own track - then record it to a cassette tape you can keep.

It now has a release date: August 15th.

                              <span>There seems to be a wave of retro racers around recently, and each one seems to pick a particular target to shoot with its nostalgia gun, whether Wipeout or Lotus or Micro Machines or whatever else. 

Maybe I&#x27;m forgetting some classic arcade racer, but Victory Heat Rally feels less laser targeted and more a modern take on the spirit of the genre. It&#x27;s a 2.5D, &quot;neo super scaler&quot; arcade racer with split screen, drifting, car tuning and a lot of pep.

                              <span>UK arts and entertainment union Equity have unveiled a raft of &quot;best practice guidelines&quot; for video game developers hiring voice actors, including some suggested minimum rates that are designed to address &quot;systemic low pay&quot; for performers. Other measures are designed to improve voice actor working conditions, and stop companies using their voices and likeness as fuel for generative AI tools without their consent. It&#x27;s both a praiseworthy endeavour and an interesting breakdown of the voice-actor&#x27;s trade.

                              <span>What if the company that sold your cheese also sold your PC gaming hardware? This is not the murmuring of some poor sod on a nineteen-hour Dota 2 binge who’s started thinking that the crumbs in his keyboard resemble a viable snack, but a bold new reality, one I recently found myself staring down during a trip to Asda. The supermarket chain – third biggest in the UK by turnover and purveyors of ill-fitting clothes and surprisingly good doughnuts alike – has added light-up gaming mice, keyboards, and headsets to its mountain of own-brand wares.
Asda being what it is (Americans, if you’re unfamiliar, think Walmart with less gun violence), it’s all dirt cheap as well. £17 for a full-size keyboard. £16 for an FPS mouse. Overwhelmed with curiosity, I ended up taking home a complete starter set (keeb, different mouse, headset, and mousemat) for £45, or about a third of the price of the Logitech G515 Lightspeed TKL that I’d shortly kick off my desk. Could this be a new frontier in affordable PC hardware, bringing tech to the masses in a way no specialist retailer ever could, or should supermarkets stick to cereal and meal deals? Surely the Asda Tech (real name) 4-in-1 Gaming Kit would have the answers.

The blockbuster JRPG isn&#x27;t out on PC yet, and developers Square Enix have not given a concrete release date for it, but this does seem to be prep work for the inevitable. And with Squeenix in attendance at Gamescom, it&#x27;s possible we&#x27;ll know more soon.

                              <span>Back in June, strategy bods Creative Assembly put out a chunky, chatty video discussing the next expansion for Total War: Warhammer 3. Aside from a not-so-subtle hint that the orcs, ogres, and Khorne pack would feature at least one colossal squig, it also ended with a tease at smaller bits of new content coming alongside regular patches. As of the game’s latest hotfix blog, we’ve now got a better idea when we’ll start seeing some of these “smaller bits and pieces.” Bits and pieces? In this economy? Yes, and this month in fact. “Late August” to be precise by quoting a vague statement precisely.

                              <span>This could quite well be my simplest review in the past twenty years of Phoronix. The AMD Ryzen 9000 series starting with the Ryzen 5 9600X and Ryzen 7 9700X launching tomorrow are some truly great desktop processors. The generational uplift is very compelling, even in single-threaded Linux workloads shooting ahead of Intel&#x27;s 14th Gen Core competition, across nearly 400 benchmarks these new Zen 5 desktop CPUs impress, and these new Zen 5 desktop processors are priced competitively. I was already loving the Ryzen 7000 series performance on Linux with its AVX-512 implementation and performing so well across hundreds of different Linux workloads but now with the AMD Ryzen 9000 series, AMD is hitting it out of the ball park. That paired with the issues Intel is currently experiencing for the Intel Core 13th/14th Gen CPUs and the ~400 benchmark results makes this a home run for AMD on the desktop side with only some minor Linux caveats.</span>

                              <span>Uruguay&#x27;s Ministry of Industry issued a decree in October 2022 which heralded the country&#x27;s first pirate site blocking program. Since then the country has blocked over 300 pirate domains following requests from various broadcasters. Some other figures of interest; in December 2022, there were around 573,000 pay TV subscribers in Uruguay. A year later that figure had fallen to 496,000. Pay TV revenues were less affected than one might expect.

                              <span>Internet provider Cox Communications wants a do-over of the piracy liability trial, where it was ordered to pay $1 billion in damages to the record label plaintiffs. The ISP previously argued that &#x27;concealed&#x27; evidence warrants a new look at the case. According to the music companies, however, Cox is grasping at straws, relying on speculation in the hope of getting a do-over.

                              <span>In the grim darkness of the far future, there is only War, unless you don&#x27;t have a 64-bit PC with an Intel Core i5-8600K equivalent and at least eight gigs of RAM, in which case you&#x27;ll have to, I don&#x27;t know, live in everlasting peace, or something. I&#x27;m pretty sure not having eight gigs of RAM is heretical, but never fear, you can probably compensate by taking a leaf from the God-Emperor&#x27;s book and arrange for a host of dying psykers to pour their brain energy into your motherboard.
All of which is to say that Focus Home have released the system requirements for huge-shouldered action game Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2. Find them proudly emblazoned across the header image above, and written out for easier copy-pasting in the blockquote, below.

                              <span>As the wait lengthens for Hollow Knight: Silksong, other Soulsy creature features are scurrying to fill the breach. We had Deviator last week - now, it&#x27;s time for a bumper helping of the heebie-jeebies in the shape of Perennial Order. The title makes it sound like an eBay delivery of potted geraniums. The game festering beneath is actually a &quot;plant horror&quot; boss rusher with twin stick melee controls, unlockable &quot;Instinct&quot; abilities and one-hit deaths.
In a gift to headline writers everywhere, the developers, four-person Gardenfiend Games, are calling it &quot;Hollow Knight meets Titan Souls&quot;, and who am I to deny them? It&#x27;s got one of those &quot;painterly&quot; art styles, too, though other words come to mind, such as &quot;rotted&quot; and &quot;unhallowed&quot; and &quot;manky&quot;. It&#x27;s out on 6th September. Find a trailer nested below this paragraph like a venus flytrap poised to clamp around your fingers.

                              <span>Okay, listen. The Roads To Power expansion coming to Crusader Kings III is focusing on the Byzantine Empire. But forget that. Because today developers Paradox revealed the ins and outs of another feature from the DLC that is way more exciting than some fusty old Greeks. It&#x27;s called &quot;landless adventurers&quot; and it&#x27;ll let you play as disgraced dirtbag travelling the world in a sort of medieval gig economy. You&#x27;ll be making camp, gathering followers, taking random jobs from local rulers, and catching infectious diseases as you try to travel safely through war-torn regions. It sounds amazing.

                              <span>I don&#x27;t play much Call Of Duty any more. My feelings about the series have settled back from self-righteous fury over its Pentagon-sponsored war-fellating to a quieter, regretful sense that there have maybe been enough Call Of Duty games now, and that it would be nice if we could fill that infamous late October/early November release slot with, I don&#x27;t know, games about witches instead, or maybe just turn it into a public holiday and spend the week lying on a mattress regarding the ceiling. Still: I&#x27;ve skinned and filleted enough COD in my time to know that Black Ops 6&#x27;s new &quot;omnimovement&quot; system is going to ruffle as many feathers as it smooths. The short version is that it turns you into Max Payne.

                              <span>In his Vampire Survivors review, Matt Cox described the game as something he could play with &quot;one hand in a packet of crisps&quot;. I think about this quite often, actually, as someone whose largely offline friends (or Fortnite/FIFA pals) ask me to recommend them a game that&#x27;s good or interesting. Show them something popular like Elden Ring and, despite its grandeur, it might prove too much in all facets. But Vampire Survivors? It&#x27;s an easy sell: simple, digestible, ridiculous value.
All of this is to say, One BTN Bosses is from the same school of the easy sell. You can fight bosses with one hand in a packet of pickled onion Space Raiders, after all.

                              <span>You’re dead at the start of rhythm-combat  RPG Nocturne, just arrived in some sort of afterlife waiting room after the apparent extinction of humanity. You get your bearings, and you soon meet up with another, only slightly irritating, small child. His name is Kimothy, which sounds like something you’d only say as a joke to annoy friends named Kim, and then only once because it would be stupid to say it again. It’s fine! Leaves flutter, rays of sun cavort through trees, and the music is utterly gorgeous. The game opens on twinkly piano and mournful strings, infused with a good dose of stirring JRPG whimsy, and soon transforms into whatever the genre of music is called that makes you want to immediately go on a massive adventure. Potion-punk. Slime-swing. Limit breakcore etc.

                              <span>Is early adoption a chump’s game? I dunno about that, though between the Asus ROG Ally X and the Steam Deck OLED, those who stayed their hand on their earlier handheld gaming PC counterparts do have a couple of quality second-genners to choose from. Valve’s effort manages to wring multiple performance, design, and battery life improvements out of its new display, while the ROG Ally X makes similar upgrades with a bigger-yet-better take on the original ROG Ally.
The only thing to do, clearly, is make them fight. It’s probably in the Irish Code Duello or something: &quot;Should one portable games box impugn another’s honour by releasing shortly after it, satisfaction must be claimed through a comparison article.&quot; My hands are bound here, folks, though if you yourself have been playing the waiting game on a handheld purchase, perhaps this little head-to-head can help you pick the right one.

                              <span>Cinematic platformer Bionic Bay opens on a scene of a very large egg doing very bad things - easily my third favourite genre of speculative fiction. You awake to a world of tree trunks that twist like viscera and corroded contraptions powered by luminous goop that’s stored in the balls, uh, big glass orbs. A beam of light soon fills your character with newfound vigour, which is a nice moment of triumph in what otherwise feels like a deeply oppressive rust pit, all unsteady platforms and jagged pipes.
It doesn’t take long before you start spotting examples of the reason Bionic Bay went viral earlier this week. Above your head hangs a painstakingly detailed mass of vents and cables, looming lifelike with dust and shadow and history. I stood and stared because I’d seen how the sausage was made, but I like to think I would have lingered longer than usual anyway. It really is just that impressive.

                              <span>This week sees the release of a new Steam edition of Type-Moon and Kinoko Nasu&#x27;s dark fantasy visual novel and dating sim Fate Stay/Night. I randomly watched one of Stay/Night&#x27;s many anime spin-offs, Fate Zero, during the pandemic lockdowns. It triggered a short-lived obsession with the Fate series - I even dipped a toe in the long-lived mobile gacha game Fate/Grand Order. As such, I think I&#x27;m the nearest thing RPS has to a Fate &quot;expert&quot;. Join me for a brief and sporadically informed tour of a universe that has Shaped The Culture like few others.

                              <span>Star Wars Outlaws is out relatively soon and looks relatively exciting, if you&#x27;re into Ubisoft open worlds and pseudo-Uncharted mechanics with pewpews and dribbly aliens. And if you&#x27;re excited, prepare to get more excited-er - or more exhausted-er - as Ubi have just unveiled Outlaws&#x27; DLC plans for season pass holders. Those DLCs will let you meet &quot;notorious gambler&quot; Lando Calrissian and &quot;veteran pirate&quot; Hondo Ohnaka, who I am definitely familiar with.

                              <span>The mayor of a small municipality in Brazil recently hosted a public screening of the blockbuster hit &quot;Inside Out 2&quot;. The open-air town square event was a great success, but not without critique. Watermarks on the meters-high screen showed that the public was watching a pirated copy of the film.  When the press got wind of it, the major countered that &quot;everyone was happy&quot;, which is hard to argue with, especially since there are no official cinemas nearby.

As a result, telecoms regulator AGCOM has summoned Google and Cloudflare to an official meeting to hear all about their plans to defeat piracy. The Italian Competition and Market Authority recently launched an antitrust investigation against Google, so the meeting in September will take place under dark clouds.

                              <span>What is it with monstrous eating mechanics in games of late? Last week it was carnivorous post-Soviet elevators, now it’s retro fantasy RPGs that devour themselves. In Super Dungeon Muncher, you are a teeny-tiny hero navigating a corridor-shaped map full of fireball traps and crumbling platforms, spinning coins and patrolling critters. That’s the “Super Dungeon” part. The “Muncher” part refers to the corpulent red monster guzzling the whole level in your wake.

For example: it&#x27;s thanks to Resetera member AstralSphere that I know about Alistair Aitcheson&#x27;s Magic Box and BizHawk retro emulation tools, which - amongst other things - allow you to play old Sonic the Hedgehog games in giddy parallel, shuffling between them whenever you collect a ring.

                              <span>One of the neat things about Norland&#x27;s fantasy medievalism is that specialist knowledge is tied to characters. So if there&#x27;s only one person in your village who knows how to brew tastier beer, and they die after being freakishly savaged by a passing wolf (it happens), suddenly your village will have no artisanal lager master. The results may be devastating. Luckily, you can share knowledge in a number of ways - by copying books, or having &quot;wise conversations&quot;. The exception to this is child characters, whose pea-sized brains can&#x27;t learn specialist knowledge, only soaking up basic attributes like &quot;manners&quot; from the teachers you assign to them. Well, until now. The developers for the Rimworld-meets-Crusader Kings catastrophe simulator have made kids a little smarter. They&#x27;ll now learn more important things from their adult teachers.

It seems just yesterday I was getting very jealous at Matthew Castle (RPS in peace) for getting to preview the sequel to my beloved Shadows Of Amn. Fast forward several turns, Larian’s RPG banger is officially one year old since release, and there’s now a much higher chance that strangers at pubs will understand why my failed romance with Jaheira as a youth was such a deeply heartbreaking experience. Baldur’s Gate 3 itself looks to be done and dusted following the upcoming patch, but Larian now seem to be gearing up for their next charm offensive with a new “community focused” YouTube channel, as well as further teasing their two games currently in development.

Does the motion detector on the light over the apartment block door need fixing? There is no time to enquire and certainly no time to flee, for there are video games we must discuss.

Schedutil také používá dlouhou dobu LATENCY_MULTIPLIER 1000. To bylo dříve potřeba, aby se zamezilo příliš častým změnám frekvence procesoru.</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve never learned to drive, but every so often a well-meaning friend tells me I&#x27;d be good at it, because &#x27;look, Edwin, you play all those driving games, surely they&#x27;ve taught you the basics&#x27;. Friend, here is what driving games have taught me: traffic lights are there for regional flavour; drifting is the same thing as cornering; other cars exist to serve as bumper cushions when overshooting a turn. Certainly, nobody wants a guy whose ideas about automobiles come from 2018&#x27;s Wreckfest to be involved in the school run. On which note: THQ Nordic have just announced Wreckfest 2 - a fresh helping of destruction derby with fancified visuals and newly animate drivers who flinch and gesticulate when other drivers smash into them. Witness the carnage in the announcement trailer below.

                              <span>It&#x27;s a hell of a thing to showcase a remake weeks after kiboshing the developers of the original game. In early July, Gothic creators Piranha Bytes were reportedly shuttered as part of Embracer Group&#x27;s mad race to trim costs, following their decade-long acquisition binge. Watching THQ Nordic&#x27;s new Gothic Remake trailer, below, feels a little like watching a vivisectionist parade about in somebody else&#x27;s skin. Still, the remake&#x27;s developers Alkimia Interactive aren&#x27;t to blame for Embracer&#x27;s fuck-ups, and I am selfishly happy to see Gothic return as an Unreal Engine 5 production - even if I didn&#x27;t play the original back in 2001.


Sin did play the original game, and in her 2016 retrospective, she paints an absorbing picture of a dark fantasy &quot;microsociety&quot; in which every community &quot;has a reason to exist, a means of providing for itself, a social order, and a long term goal&quot;. It&#x27;s a setup that reminds me of my beloved Roadwarden, even as the sight of grumpy lizards slinking through undergrowth has me silently mouthing &quot;fus roh dah&quot;.

                              <span>Titan Quest 2! Now there&#x27;s a name you can set your watch by. No colons, no bespoke jargon, no tortuous subtitles like &quot;Gaia&#x27;s B.O.U.N.T.Y.&quot; or &quot;Hyperion&#x27;s Wild Rumpus&quot; - just the steadying prospect of a titanic quest that, who knows, may involve actual titans. The action-RPG beneath the moniker appears similarly straightforward: it&#x27;s about following a plot thread through a mythological world in top-down view, smashing Ancient Greek giga-crabs and the like to obtain shinier, pointier varieties of gear. I&#x27;m sure I don&#x27;t need to tell you that there&#x27;s an endgame in which you farm monsters for crafting materials.


Like Pandora opening her box, but without the accompanying tidal wave of sickness, curses and death, THQ Nordic have released a new trailer that talks you though all of this in detail. Here it is...

                              <span>Bungie have reportedly cancelled Payback, an unannounced project in the Destiny universe from former Destiny 2 game director Luke Smith and project lead Mark Noseworthy. Both Noseworthy and Smith appear to have lost their jobs in the course of Bungie&#x27;s brutal cost-cutting this week, but Payback&#x27;s cancellation pre-dates the layoffs. Envisaged as a Destiny spin-off, rather than Destiny 3, it was apparently dropped &quot;a while ago&quot;.

                              <span>The first World Of Goo was a cheerful parade of goopy engineering with a sense of never-ending novelty (well, never-ending for about four hours). Every level would introduce a new goo type or a twist on the basic bridge-building puzzle that challenged you to get a gaggle of gurgling balls to the nearest pipe. World Of Goo 2 pursues that sense of novelty with just as much twitchy eagerness as its predecessor, throwing new toys and goos at the player in an effort to keep you on your sludge-coated toes. That pursuit doesn&#x27;t always result in pleasing new levels, though. There is a &quot;hit and miss&quot; feeling to things this time around. But those hits are hits. For anyone who has spent the last 16 years yearning for more sticky structure-building: I hope you like comically unpredictable fluids.

Now that Valve have shown it’s possible to quickly turn around an upgraded handheld without enraging owners of the original, Lenovo have hinted at a new Legion Go, MSI have revealed an improved Claw, and Asus have released this here ROG Ally X. A ROG Ally, again – but better? Yes, it is, in almost every way except the speed at which it’ll plunge you into financial destitution.

                              <span>Toonsouls, which you can find on Steam here, doesn’t appear to screenshot especially well. Don’t get me wrong, I’m a big fan of those perpetually disgruntled ghosts and charming goofskulls, but I might not be writing about the platform game at all if I hadn’t seen it in motion, where the vision comes together a lot more. The Cuphead influence runneth so overly that it feels trite to even point it out, and I do think maybe opting for different music would have served it far better in this case, but you can’t deny that Ghosts n’ Goblins lance throw. Get stuck in.

                              <span>Jail shake-and-breaker management sim Prison Architect 2 has been delayed indefinitely, a couple of months after publishers Paradox parted ways with original developers Double Eleven. Current developers Kokku will use the additional time &quot;to improve both the game&#x27;s performance and its content&quot;. Additionally, Paradox are removing the option to preorder the game until they have a &quot;robust&quot; release timeline. Existing preorders on all platforms will be refunded, and all preorder-exclusive items will be added into the base game.

                              <span>With Valorant, Riot set out to integrate a bit of hero shooter into the Counter Strike template and made it a little more accessible than CS in the process. Now Mountaintop Studios, a new studio whose ranks include ex-Bungie and Respawn devs, have chucked themselves into the tactical FPS gauntlet with Spectre Divide. Made with input from former CS pro and streamer Shroud, it looks a bit like a mix of CS and Valorant, but has a big gimmick that sets it apart from the two: you can swap between two bodies. I… am cautiously optimistic? I think?

                              <span>This week&#x27;s mass layoffs at Destiny studio Bungie were planned out months ago, former employees have told journalist Stephen Totilo at Game File (paywalled). According to Totilo, Bungie leadership &quot;overstated their studio’s financial prospects to Sony&quot; after the latter bought Bungie in 2022 for $3.6 billion. The latest cuts were necessary to prevent continued losses, says the report, after Bungie missed Sony’s targets following the release of last year’s Lightfall.

                              <span>THQ Nordic have announced The Eternal Life Of Goldman, a hand-drawn platformer from This Is The Police and Hollywood Animal devs Weappy. I caught a brief presentation earlier in the week and yeah, this seems promising. On the one hand, it reminds me of cheery 16-bit hop &#x27;n&#x27; boppers like, say, the Mega Drive adaptation of Disney&#x27;s Aladdin. On the other, it makes me think of side-scrolling Soulslikes (Scroulslikes?) such as Blasphemous and the frantic worldbuilding of Rick &amp; Morty.

Penned by the same law firm, the answers have much in common and, even at this early stage, show that the RIAA has a fight on its hands. Suno and Udio are welcoming discovery, noting that the law has always permitted comparable uses of copyrighted works.

After most of the requests were transferred to the Attorney General&#x27;s office, Dotcom demanded damages for breaching his privacy. After nine years of courts handing down decisions and Dotcom filing appeal after appeal, the Court of Appeal has now denied Dotcom&#x27;s request for special leave to appeal the High Court&#x27;s dismissal of another appeal, against a Human Rights Tribunal&#x27;s decision not to award damages.

                              <span>According to certain Terran lore, God created the universe in seven days. Well, I got up this morning and made a small suburban village with a hospital, school, police station and a cafe in the space of 20 minutes. This is the backwater burg of Edwitherington. Population: 8 - one for every non-residential building in town. Major imports: ornamental lampposts, because I like to cultivate an old-timey mood. Major exports: traffic jams, because I&#x27;ve laid out my village in the form of a small crescent leading back to the freeway, which means that there are two traffic light junctions about 100 metres apart.

Yes or no, Kitsune Games have put out some good stuff in the past, and now they&#x27;re back with a Super Bernie World followup: Kitsune Tails. Again, it&#x27;s a Super Mario-inspired platformer, but this time it&#x27;s a wonderfully queer rescue mission inspired by Japanese mythology in a way that&#x27;s cutesy and colourful.

                              <span>Hardened battle royalists will remember Caldera, the sandy island map of bunkers and palm trees in Call Of Duty: Warzone. It got shut down last year as Activision focused their efforts elsewhere, making the map unplayable. But you can now revisit those bullet-strewn beaches. In theory, anyway. Activision have released it as a 4GB open-source project that can be explored in a 3D model-viewing tool. That&#x27;s cool. But among their reasons for doing so, there lies a predictably grubby logic: they want people to use the data to train AI.

In my brief time with massive Fallout 4 mod Fallout London, I’ve read a delightful terminal entry about a scientist who named his favourite radiated shrew “Big Dave,” thwacked several of said Radshrews with a walking stick, gulped down some expired pink wafers, and been informed of train delays due to “leaves on the track.”
“A British transport joke!” I said to myself, marinating in the sufficient amount of crown-mandated mild amusement. “Our organ-floggingly expensive yet vital public services are crap!” I was having a good time. Then the game public transported me straight to my desktop, and continued to do so at regular intervals over the next few hours, ranging from “just as this conversation was getting good” to “just as my save was about to load.” My upper lip almost quivered, I tell you.

                              <span>Well, would you look at that! I just got done pining for the merest whiff of Dungeon Keeper when what should appear on Steam but a free prologue for delightful voxel-arty management sim Dungeon Tycoon. I’m using the word ‘appear’ because, following yet more industry layoffs yesterday, I’m choosing to adopt the brain of an idiot as to shield myself from the crushing reality of material conditions. So, anyway, the magical game goblins whacked the demo on Steam, and I’ve been having a lot of fun with it. Thanks, adequately compensated and unionised gobbos!

                              <span>Having a list of Suffolk amusement park mascots one desperately wishes to outlive out of an innate desire for revenge is, I imagine, not a universal experience. Still, on the day Pleasurewood Hills mascot Woody Bear is taken by the soil, I will jig and whoop under the moon. I actually cannot remember when the beef started, but my mum reliably informs me that I was terrified to tears by this bear as a child. He yet survives, but mark my words: when the Woody Copters finally fall from their rusted hinges, I will salt the earth.
Happily, I didn’t spot any bear mascots in Planet Coaster 2’s new deep dive trailer.

                              <span>After years of plain sailing followed by several years of bad luck, two convicted IPTV operators in Sweden were sentenced to prison and ordered to pay rightsholders $18m in damages. On appeal, the men successfully argued that the amount was excessive and based on incorrect information. A dispute over an admin panel photograph led to damages being slashed by $7m.

Bungie are also transferring a further 155 roles to parent company Sony Interactive Entertainment, and are spinning out an untitled incubation project - an &quot;action game set in a brand-new science-fantasy universe&quot; - to form a new PlayStation studio.

The developers have just released a nine-minute explainer video, which teems with scenes of gimp suits, winged vans, rocket-propelled pinkies, vicious card battles against small excited dogs, and a surprisingly in-depth management component. There are bits that make me think of Batman: Arkham City, and bits that make me think of Pathologic, and bits that make me think of Yakuza - a combination fit to burst the brain. Quick, before your brain bursts, watch the video for yourself below.

Don&#x27;t laugh: I know you do this too. Kletka isn&#x27;t helping: created by in404, it&#x27;s a horror scavenging game reminiscent of Lethal Company and Golden Light, in which you ponderously plummet through the layers of an &quot;endless&quot; post-Soviet Gigastructure, scrounging fuel, parts and provender for an elevator that wants to eat you.

                              <span>While he&#x27;s &quot;blown away&quot; by the beach scenes in the first GTA 6 trailer, former Rockstar North technical director Obbe Vermeij thinks the forthcoming open worlder might underwhelm players hoping for a palpable technological update on GTA 5, which has been reworked and re-released extensively since its 2013 launch. This has less to do with GTA in itself, Vermeij says, than with the fact that changes in computing capacity today simply aren&#x27;t as dramatic as in the days of the very first PlayStation. It&#x27;s becoming rare, he suggests, that you see a &quot;jump&quot; akin to GTA going 3D.

                              <span>Katharine (RPS in peace) thought Dome Keeper&#x27;s blend of tower defence and mining was both &quot;meditative&quot; and &quot;perfectly formed&quot; in her review. So it comes as great news, then, that the devs have somehow taken that perfect dome, expanded it and polished it to an even greater sheen. We&#x27;re talking about new guild assignments, new gadgets, better world generation, a new world, new monsters. The list is enormous and designed expressly around improved replayability - take that, Las Vegas Dome.

                              <span>In case you skipped the headline, I’ll repeat myself. Among the wonderful sights contained in space-poking adventure game The Great Fluctus are: beans, slug milk, alien volleyball, egg arguments, and massive frog. Additional screenshots suggest this frog later acquires wings. Like a captive Generation Game host, I am helpless but to shout out more incredible sights as they flutter past on the conveyor belt of pure flippin&#x27; videogame before me. It’s got dance parties with horrible gorilla aliens. It’s got building, namely the Statue Of Liberty out of goop, just as George Washington’s goop clone intended. It’s also got just sitting on a bench, enjoying some lovely serene space scenery.  Feast your famished face on the trailer.

                              <span>Once upon a time, my favourite place to write was on trains. Specifically, laidback intercity services with nobody else in the quiet car and certainly, none of those screeching smaller bipeds, or &quot;children&quot; as they are scientifically known. That idyll is now lost to me thanks to Covid: I have vulnerable family members and continue to be careful about social distancing. As such I spend most train journeys these days lurking between carriages, trolling the door sensors and scowling furiously at anybody who visits the loo. But now, thanks to the obscene magic of video games, I can get my fill of authorial locomotivation once again.

                              <span>Few acts in games feel quite as gleefully gratifying as removing a knight’s shiny dome with a halberd swing in medieval multiplayer melee Chivalry 2. In a pastime that’s had several decades to perfect the art of hitting men with sharp objects, that’s quite the accomplishment. Since releasing in 2022, Torn Banner have lavished the player base with free horses, angry peasants, and most recently, the Regicide update - hosting a climatic tete-a-tete between two angry crownmen. With work on No More Room In Hell 2 well underway though, Torn Banner have decided to call it on Chiv 2, which they now consider “feature complete.”

                              <span>For the past couple of decades, the official Olympics video games have starred Mario and Sonic and been exclusive to Nintendo devices. Not so, this year. Olympics Go! Paris 2024 is free-to-play and available for PC via the Epic Games Store.

Hear the curl of the monkey&#x27;s paw? Yeah, it&#x27;s a mobile game port with the touchscreen prompts seemingly still intact, and its publisher is also pushing a &quot;commemorative Paris 2024 NFT Digital Pin collection&quot;.

                              <span>Update: Garry Newman has confirmed that the DMCA notice was sent last year, and has since been &quot;all resolved&quot;, in an email to IGN.
Original story:
Earlier this month it was reported that Skibidi Toilet, the YouTube phenomenon, may be heading to film and television via director Michael Bay. Now Invisible Narratives, a production company co-owned by Bay, has apparently sent a DMCA takedown notice to Garry Newman, citing the large number of Skibidi Toilet games and assets advertised within Garry&#x27;s Mod.

Skibidi Toilet uses assets derived from Half-Life 2, however, and owes a lot to the Garry&#x27;s Mod machinima scene. And the animation&#x27;s original creator, best known as DaFuqBoom, is claiming innocence over the DMCA.

Real-time movement and exploration? Rotatable polygons? Pfff. These are firmly pre-rendered worlds, just like Grandpappy Atrus used to bake.

                              <span>There’s a new version of AMD Fluid Motion Frames (AFMF) available to try, and good news for Radeon GPU owners: it is drastically, almost comically better than the original version. Whereas AMD’s first take on driver-level frame generation – the same kind of framerate-roiding image generation trickery that FSR 3 and DLSS 3 are based around – came yoked to a barrel of jittering, stuttering, and visual artefacting issues, Fluid Motion Frames 2 is as smooth and you’d like. Without compromising on the ability to deploy it in theoretically any DirectX 11- or 12-based game, too.

                              <span>British comedy is too often defined by its relationship to America: either as merely irony and sarcasm, which we&#x27;re told Americans don&#x27;t understand, or as a sprightly ideas factory for works such as The Office, which Americans can bless by re-making at scale.

Peel back the curtains of American cultural hegemony however and you may find the true pulsing core of British comedy that lies beneath: innuendo. No American network is in a bidding war to import Vic and Bob or remake Bottom, and Carry On and Benny Hill are assumed to be anachronisms in our modern times, but Thank Goodness You&#x27;re Here! enters the conversation with a nudge and a wink. It&#x27;s a cheeky 2-3 hour adventure through a small northern town, and it&#x27;s here to educate the entire world of our nation&#x27;s obsession with sausages and bare bottoms.

It&#x27;s being developed by Rotoscope Studios and it&#x27;s a low-poly, 90s-inspired mix of dystopian RPG, survival, third and first-person shooter, with some roguelike bits slapped in there, as well. Whew, that&#x27;s a lot. Potentially too much. But hey, I am here for something ambitious and interesting, of which it ticks both boxes.

Well, funnel all that anticipation into your mouse-clicking finger, because developers Square Enix have just put up a playable demo of the bright JRPG on Steam. I&#x27;m not sure how much the demo offers, as we&#x27;re only told it includes &quot;a section of the story, battles and exploration.&quot; But that&#x27;s better than nothing, and with a full month before release, you have plenty of time to scope it out.

                              <span>In Cleanfall you essentially play a Roomba that is trying to reverse the apocalypse because the apocalypse is messy. A Roomba capable of tunnelling through miles of procedurally generated, monster-infested crust so as to reorganise the Earth&#x27;s core and bring about its ultimate objective - a sparkling living room. I enjoy the militant reductiveness of this character motivation. There are sprawling underground ecosystems to discover, yes, weird plants to harvest, fractious clumps of tentacles to appraise, avoid or slaughter. But all of these things are contemptible details to be swept up and bagged and thrown in the dumpster.

                              <span>In Behaviour Interactive&#x27;s post-apocalyptic multiplayer FPS Meet Your Maker, you raise grim forts of rusty blocks, pop-out manglers and robot ambushers from the desert sands. Each base harbours a cannister of genetic material and other resources, and the idea is to fiendishly arrange traps and defences to stop people taking your precious genmat while doing your best to clean out their bases. Sound like good wholesome fun? You might want to check out the current free trial on Steam.

                              <span>Karaoke may not scale the heights of popularity it once did in the West, but after more than 50 years the format may still be generating around $5 billion a year for rightsholders. That may explain why Hong Kong Customs carried out a month-long crackdown, arrested 18 people, and for the very first time, seized hardware and remote servers powering an online karaoke streaming system.

Stumbling parched through a desert as a bed of scorpions prick your ankles with deadly venom? Well, Enshrouded may provide some or none of these experiences, but what its latest update does is capture their spirit. You&#x27;ll now be able to choose from several difficulty presets to dampen or spice up the game&#x27;s challenge. Otherwise, there&#x27;s new customisation options and some quality of life tweaks, too.

                              <span>Overwatch 2 director Aaron Keller has posted a lengthy blog on Steam about the transition from 6v6 player matches in the first Overwatch to 5v5 in the poorly received free-to-play sequel. It&#x27;s a juicy read for armchair designers and lapsed Overwatchers like myself, packing in analysis of class roles and the shift from the free choice of heroes to single hero picks and enforced team compositions.
In broad strokes, Keller summarises how the Overwatch experience has drifted away from &quot;player freedom and creativity in order to create a more balanced, consistent and competitive experience for players&quot;. It&#x27;s possible, however, that Overwatch 2 will swing back in the other direction, as Blizzard are now &quot;exploring how we can test different forms of 6v6 in the game to gauge the results&quot;, with a view to restoring some of the joyful chaos that saw entire teams of Reinhardts charging the objective in formation.

                              <span>A time capsule is a boxful of objects from today&#x27;s world, buried or otherwise hidden away so that people from the future can rediscover and understand current Hot Trends such as wearing mismatched socks or electing washed-up businessmen with fascist tendencies. Unless, that is, it&#x27;s a time capsule in sci-fi ocean survival game Subnautica, in which case it contains: THE FUTURE. Developers Unknown Worlds have been sneaking pictures of the forthcoming Subnautica 2 into the original game&#x27;s time capsules, offering glimpses of its flora and fauna.

                              <span>The story of Mortal Kombat games in recent years has been a mish-mash of double-crosses, weird friendships, and alternate dimension wobbles. They often feel like a casualty of Marvel movie bloat. Mortal Kombat 1 was marketed as a &quot;reboot&quot;, for example, but is really just a continuation of previous nonsense, with developers NetherRealm saying &quot;I don&#x27;t know, stick a multiverse in it.&quot; Yet from that multiverse now arrives another bad guy, bringing new story chapters for the fighting game&#x27;s first big expansion, as well as extra characters like the liquid metal murderer from Terminator 2, a Conan of the barbarian persuasion, and the masked killer of the Scream movies.

                              <span>Happy this week! I return from holiday to find that Nic, James and the others have been experimenting with the use of Maw-shaped sock puppets to feed the Maw, in the hope that the Maw might form a filial bond with our news-wranglers. Unfortunately, we&#x27;ve learned in the process that anything that resembles the Maw behaves like the Maw. The sockpuppets were last seen tunnelling towards Los Angeles, like the sandworms in Dune. Sorry, America! Anyway, let&#x27;s have a looksie at the PC game release sheets.
