It&#x27;s a new year and sure enough new rumours are already popping up about what games could be made available to Nintendo users in the future.
The latest story doing the rounds suggests a Microsoft game &quot;met with high critical acclaim&quot; and well-received by fans will be released on a &quot;competitor system&quot; in the calendar year of 2024. This claim comes from the host of the &#x27;Nate the Hate Podcast&#x27;, who goes on to mention how the same title was in the &quot;game of the year conversation&quot; during the year of its release.

                              <span>After being revealed at the Las Vegas Final Fantasy Fest in July, and then detailed at the London Fan Fest in October, the Final Fantasy XVI crossover event is scheduled to hit the popular MMORPG Final Fantasy XIV in Early April. We&#x27;ve known the event was in the works for a while now, but this is the first time we&#x27;re seeing an actual release timeframe. The event will launch with the current expansion, Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker, ahead of the release of the new one Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail.




Players will team up with Final Fantasy XVI protagonist Clive Rosfield in an exclusive event called The Path Infernal. The questline will task players to enlist the help of Clive to take on various Eikons from FF16. For doing so, players can receive unique rewards including Clive glamours and even a Torgal mount.


It&#x27;s important to note that producer Naoki Yoshida made it clear that Early April is the current planned release for the collaboration event, and that it may change as things get a little closer.

If you were hoping to discover when exactly during Fan Fest, sorry — you&#x27;ll have to wait a bit. However, FFXIV Patch 6.55 launches this month, on January 16. 


During this year&#x27;s Tokyo Fan Festival, director and producer Naoki Yoshida took to the stage to show off Dawntrail&#x27;s Dawntrailer in its entirety. The new, lengthier footage features Krile joining the Scions as the vibrant casting Job, Pictomancer, and a request to hang tight on a specific release date. It&#x27;s coming, but the best he can do for now is still that summer window.

Season 29 marked the last season that would receive completely new content.


All about Soul Shards


The big feature in Diablo 3 Season 30: The Lords of Hell is Soul Shards. Players can use these shards to infuse the demonic essences into themselves to embody new Prime and Lesser Evil powers. In total, there are seven unique Soul Shards—based on the seven Lords of Hell—each with a new power. One of the three Prime Evil Soul Shards are able to be equipped into your helmet, and one of the four Lesser Evil Shards ca…</span>

                              <span>Persona is one of the most stylish video game series around, which means it&#x27;s a pleasure just to watch the games in action whether in one of its lushly animated cutscenes or during its in-game combat and dialogue. Persona 3 was no exception and its imminent remake Persona 3 Reload seems only to be pushing it into the modern era. 

As proof, Atlus have released the opening movie for Reload - that is, the two-minute intro sequence that&#x27;ll play at the start of the game.

From that basic interaction, it spins enjoyable yarns with some strategic underpinnings.

It&#x27;s had several followups and spin-offs since, and it&#x27;s about to get another. Reigns: Three Kingdoms, which lets you swipe your way through anccient China, will launch on January 11th.

Jools loves his boogie woogie. I can&#x27;t say for sure the two things - the angs and the boogie woogie - are related, but I wouldn&#x27;t rule it out. You know what definitely soothes anxiety? Staring at a screen for hours and hours and not going outside or regulating your breathing! Here&#x27;s what we&#x27;re playing this weekend.

                              <span>VR isn’t in the best place at present, and studios like First Contact Entertainment have closed due to a lack of support in the industry. If you’re looking for something to pull you back into the VR world, Tiger Blade might be the most action-packed way to do it.


Released on December 20 last year, it was developed by Ikimasho Games. It has beautiful, colorful visuals and a hip soundtrack that&#x27;ll have you bobbing your head. It&#x27;s not the main draw, but its overall presentation is worth appreciating. 


The main excitement comes from the gameplay which has you slicing foes, speeding on motorbikes, and deflecting bullets with your blade. This isn&#x27;t the type of game that&#x27;ll have you running and ducking for cover. Instead, it features an atypical approach to gameplay that raises excitement wit…</span>

                              <span>Showing just how much the development team cares for and supports their players in times of crisis, Final Fantasy XIV has temporarily suspended the auto-demolition of player housing on Japanese Servers after a massive magnitude 7.6 Earthquake that hit the Noto Peninsula on January 1.


In a post uploaded to the Lodestone on January 4, developers acknowledged the tragedy and said their “hearts go out to those who were effected” by the natural disaster, which has left over 100 dead and many more still missing. The team goes on to say that “due to the damages and other factors, we have decided to temporarily suspend the automatic demolition of estates”.


Housing auto-demolition paused on Japanese Final Fantasy XIV servers


It’s not the first time that the FFXIV team has offered their support to players during tough times. Housing auto-demolition was canceled indefinitely for all servers during the COVID outbreak in 2020 and, in a haunting reflection of current events, the same happened after the Kumamoto Earthquakes in 2016.


In a documentary by Noclip, Yoshi P discussed the 2016 tragedy and told a heart-touching story of how logging into the game was the only way for players across Japan to find out if their online friends were safe. 


No date has been set for auto-demolition to return to Japanese servers. To find out more, head over to the Lodestone or keep an eye on FFXIV’s Twitter posts.

                              <span>Netflix&#x27;s hit League of Legends show, Arcane, is expected to release its second season this November. To bide the time until then, Riot Games and Netflix released a small yet intriguing Arcane Season 2 teaser as part of League of Legends&#x27; 2024 roadmap that may tease a fan-favorite arrival.




In this 45-second teaser, we&#x27;re treated to a haunting look at what appears to be a blood transfusion. Giving his blood seems to be Silco&#x27;s doctor acquaintance, Singed. While it isn&#x27;t said who or what is being given blood outside of the gigantic beast, some fans are quick to speculate. In fact, one of the main theories from last season may help decipher who that hanging abomination may be.

                              <span>The Hammerin’ Harry/Daiku no Gen-San series continued from 1990 to the last game, Hammerin’ Hero, in 2009. However, only the first game was released in arcades. After the original Hammerin’ Harry, the series shifted entirely to home platforms.


Whether or not a game in the series would be released in the West, however, was another matter. In fact, only the arcade original and the aforementioned Hammerin’ Hero would reach North America, though two other titles would at least find their way to Europe. The second Famicom/NES title, 1993&#x27;s Daiku no Gen-san 2: Akage no Dan no Gyakushō was not one of them.


That is until Retro-Bit translated and reissued it. It was given to me as part of the Hammerin’ Harry Concrete Collection, which I was rather excited to try. I covered the first Hammerin’ H…</span>

Since his outstanding work on The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, director and producer Eiji Aonuma has cemented himself as the driving force behind one of Nintendo’s most celebrated, enduring, and lucrative franchises. For many Zelda fans, he holds just about as much prestige in the ranks of Nintendo as Shigeru Miyamoto, Takashi Tezuka, and the late, great Satoru Iwata.
Yet for as vital as Aonuma has proven himself to be for the growth of The Legend of Zelda, there’s another creator who has arguably taken even more of a crucial role in the franchise’s development in recent years: Hidemaro Fujibayashi. In fact, as of 2023, Fujibayashi holds the most directorial credits for the Zelda franchise, helming Oracle of Ages and Seasons, Four Swords, The Minish Cap, Skyward Sword, Breath of the Wild, and Tears of the Kingdom. He also served as story writer and sub-director on Phantom Hourglass.

We laid out our gaming predictions for the year ahead, ran through some of the discounted delights in yet another eShop sale (will it ever end?) and restarted the &#x27;Switch 2&#x27; chatter with the predictions of an industry analyst.

This title was originally confirmed to be arriving on 22nd March 2024 during last year&#x27;s September Direct and in the latest update, an ESRB rating for the game has now been spotted online. This seemingly confirms its release is still on track.

                              <span>All good Metroidvanias must eventually make their way to Nintendo Switch, and that&#x27;s the next stop for GRIME. Publisher Akupara Games and developer Clover Bite announced that the side-scrolling action-RPG is coming to Switch on January 25. 




This version of GRIME is now being billed as the Definitive Edition, offering &quot;the complete GRIME experience&quot; on Switch. In addition to the main game, the Switch port comes with all free pieces of DLC, including the third and final offering in Parting Shade. The latest addition follows the act of previous DLC Colors of Rot and Tinge of Terror, all evocatively named in a way that suits GRIME&#x27;s, uh, grimy style. 


The devs describe Parting Shade as their &quot;parting gift to you, our players.&quot; According to an earlier tease, you&#x27;ll need to use every ability you have at your disposal to survive their own personal take on the Path of Pain, presumably referring to Hollow Knight&#x27;s absurdly challenging sub-area. The DLC was first announced in September as the last thing they needed to work on before switching their attention to the Switch port and GRIME 2. 


GRIME first made its way to PC via Steam in August 2021, and is also available through Epic Games Store and GOG, as well as on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S. Back when the demo was on the way to Steam, we spoke with director Yarden Weissbrot about the surreal creature-absorbing game&#x27;s unique progression style, difficulty level, and more. With this and the sequel on the way, it&#x27;s a good time to be into GRIME.

                              <span>Persona 3 Reload, a remake of 2006&#x27;s Persona 3, just released its animated opening ahead of its February release. Not only does it look fantastic, but it pays homage to the game&#x27;s original theme &quot;Burn My Dread&quot; in a pretty inventive way.




Mixing in the blue/white palette of the original, Persona 3 Reload’s opening movie gives us a taste of what to expect come February 2nd. The two-minute animation introduces us fully to the new song “Full Moon Full Life” sung by Azumi Takahashi and Lotus Juice. There are some subtle nods to the original 2006 phenomenon that long-time fans will adore.


A Way of Life


If you’re like me and watched the opening more times than Akihiko says “I’ve been waiting for this!” (spoiler alert: it’s a ton), you’ll pick up on an audio Easter egg. Sure, there&#x27;s the not-so-subtle usage of “Burn My Dread” and “Want to be Close” when the protagonist is flipping through his songs. However, the reference is in “Full Moon Full Life” itself. The beat of the song has a striking resemblance to the beginning notes of “Burn My Dread”. It’s a cool homage to the original banger of an opening. 


Persona 3 Reload’s opening visuals look phenomenal. I was a bit scared of how it would translate given the abstract tone of the original openings. However, it worked great and crafted some beautiful shots. It might just be me, but seeing Mitsuru riding her motorcycle like a badass got me 10x more hyped. Plus, the Akihiko/Shinjiro/Ken transitions were super smooth. A favorite shot of mine was with Thanatos and the moon, as it felt pretty iconic given the symbolism behind the two.


Our very own Timothy Monbleau got to play Persona 3 Reload in August and said the game felt “polished to an absolute shine.” As one of my personal RPGs to look out for, Persona 3 Reload looks to be a force to be reckoned with. P3 Reload launches on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox Game Pass, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S on February 2, 2024.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been a funny old time for Cyberpunk 2077. Upon launching at the tail end of 2020, it went down as one of the most negatively received games due to its unfinished state. Now, with Phantom Liberty&#x27;s launch and being one of the top-selling Steam releases of 2023, CD Projekt Red&#x27;s dystopian RPG has finally arrived.


Speaking of top-selling, a recent post on the Cyberpunk Twitter page shows that a lot of people have downloaded the expansion. In fact, since it launched in September, Phantom Liberty has shifted more than five million units, according to the developer.




As user KAMI says in a response below the tweet, that&#x27;s a mighty achievement for DLC. Entire games can only dream of achieving such lofty figures, especially in such a short span of time.


Can we say it&#x27;s fully redeemed now?


The memory of that initial launch is fast becoming faded, I reckon. Sure, folks like me felt massively let down by a product that was by no means ready for release. I was only really able to play it more than a year later.


However, these days, it&#x27;s a different story. The work CDPR put into rectifying as many errors and issues as possible has rendered the game worthy of praise. The fact that Phantom Liberty has been bought so many times is further evidence of this.


As we move forward, the studio is going to be busy, especially now that there are no more plans to release big updates for Cyberpunk 2077. We can only imagine what we&#x27;ll experience when the follow-up arrives, not to mention the new Witcher saga that&#x27;s currently in development.

                              <span>Publisher Game Source Entertainment updated plans on a handful of titles, including deck-building roguelite Lost in Fantaland (via Gematsu). The isometric strategy game is currently in Early Access on PC, and it&#x27;s coming to PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch this June. 


Developer Supernature Games first kicked off the Early Access run on Steam back in September 2022, and it has since garnered very positive reviews. You can see a sample of its pixel art style and card-based tactics in the previously-revealed trailer below.




Lost in Fantaland lets players explore its randomly-generated world as a Warrior, Mage, or Deceiver. Battles take place on an eight-by-eight isometric checkerboard, and Supernature promises a ton of cards, items, and secret treasures to help keep those strategic showdowns interesting. For those who want to check it out while it&#x27;s still in Early Access, Lost in Fantaland is currently 20 percent off on Steam. 


Beyond Fantaland


In addition to Lost in Fantaland, Game Source Entertainment provided some more info on games spanning a few different genres. Yasha: Legends of the Demon Blade is a roguelite fantasy action-RPG set during Japan&#x27;s Edo period, and it&#x27;s coming to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC this October. 


On the boys&#x27; love visual novel end, there&#x27;s Voice Love on Air, which developer Noisy Fish has lined up for a spring launch on Switch and PC. Finally, horror fans will get to soak in the frights of Softstar Entertainment&#x27;s The Bridge Curse 2: The Extrication when it hits consoles, along with the previously-planned PC version, sometime this year.

                              <span>With the release of the Steam Deck OLED last year, Valve keeps its place as the head honcho of modern handheld PC technology. However, the market is starting to become crowded with alternatives, and one more tech firm is throwing its hat into the ring.


As spotted by The Verge, it looks as though multinational IT corporation MSI will be releasing its own Steam Deck competitor. That&#x27;s according to leaked images, at least. In recent social media posts (originally reported by Videocardz), the company uploaded a teaser clip, showing something is certainly inbound from the laptop manufacturer.




There&#x27;s also a message saying that a &quot;whole new breed of MSI dragon is coming,&quot; as well as instructions for us to &quot;get a grip and stay tuned.&quot; That last definitely hints at a handheld. In any case, details will be revealed at CES 2024 – judging by the hashtags – which begins next week.


Deck the halls with - hmm, bit late for that pun


It looks as though this device – said to be called &quot;Claw&quot; – will run with an Intel Meteor Lake processor. Whether this is accurate or not can&#x27;t be said at this stage, but the fact that Intel commented under MSI&#x27;s Twitter tease hints that the tech giant is involved.


We&#x27;ve already seen the release of the Lenovo Legion GO, which came out last November, plus, the ASUS ROG Ally before that. Both of these have evidently been wanting to muscle in on the portable gaming market. Oh, also there&#x27;s Sony&#x27;s Project Q, which came out recently, but that&#x27;s more in-line with console gaming than with PC.


Whatever MSI has up its sleeve, it&#x27;s clearly worth dropping hints about just before CES. And this recent leak seems to only cement the rumor. We&#x27;ll know more about it sometime next week, but it&#x27;s almost certain that that Valve will have another rival to contend with.

                              <img src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/portal-64.jpg" loading="lazy" class="media-object__media article-image" />

                              <span>Let&#x27;s just get this out of the way: Valve is probably not going to make Portal 3 (boy is my face going to be red if I turn out to be wrong years from now). However, we can enjoy the fruits of the modding community that are keeping the franchise alive.


One such example comes from James Lambert, a coder who&#x27;s just declared that their Portal 64 project is now out of beta. Or at least the first 13 chambers are, which is being referred to as the &quot;First Slice.&quot; You can download the project (in ROM form) in its current form here.




In the above video, Lambert goes over some of the things that have changed since the previous iterations. One of the more obvious ones is the higher polygon count for the portals themselves. There&#x27;s also a lot of talk about Z-buffering, if you&#x27;re into that sort of thing.


The flour-based sweet treat is most certainly not an untruth


For those who don&#x27;t know, Portal 64 is essentially a remake of the first Portal game that Lambert has been working on for some time. It&#x27;s essentially an attempt to recreate Valve&#x27;s classic from the ground up to make it run on the Nintendo 64 hardware. A console that came out in the mid-90s.


In that regard, it&#x27;s more of a &quot;demake.&quot; But the result is something pretty astounding, given the processing power that&#x27;s being worked with.


Along the way, Lambert has built up quite a following. We get shown an N64 cartridge/game box combo that one fan has made, while another has customized a console with a Portal theme. Lambert also promises that more chambers will be added, so the project could end up being a full recreation of the entire game. With nostalgia a-plenty.

                              <span>A lot of people have been quite keen to know when they can get their hands on the remake of Silent Hill 2. So much so that developer Bloober Team urged for a bit more patience, and we still have no idea when it&#x27;s releasing. But we&#x27;re getting closer.


In a recent video on the PlayStation YouTube channel, we&#x27;re treated to a brief teaser showing what we can expect to launch this year on Sony&#x27;s system. Among other things (something called &quot;Tek-en,&quot; not sure if you&#x27;ve heard of it), we&#x27;re now told that Silent Hill 2 will be available this year.




Of course, we could probably have ascertained that 2024 was likely the release window. But it&#x27;s comforting to see PlayStation officially acknowledge this. However, we don&#x27;t have an actual date yet, so that&#x27;s surely the next port of call.


We must be nearly there, then


Many of us had been hoping to see the remake by the end of 2023 at the latest. For some time, it&#x27;s been suggested that Bloober was just putting the finishing touches to the game, and this teaser sort of confirms that the team must be at the final hurdle now.


After the disappointment that was the interactive experience Silent Hill: Ascension, the legendary series could do with a win. Konami&#x27;s horror franchise has been dormant for far too long, some might say. Me. I would say that.


However, there&#x27;s a lot to live up to. Bloober Team has its critics, and bringing back Silent Hill 2 – with the original being largely considered one of the most influential horror games of all time – is a tall order, indeed.

                              <span>The VR gaming realm appears to be struggling to gain its footing as yet another studio experiences problems. This time around it&#x27;s Archiact which has announced it is going through layoffs. 


Archiact describes itself as &quot;one of the largest independent VR studios&quot; and it is behind VR titles like Doom 3: VR Edition, Freedriver: Triton Down, and Marvel Dimension of Heroes.  One of the latest titles it has released is Journey to Foundation which is inspired by Isaac Asimov&#x27;s series. 




A reason for the layoffs was not given in the announcement, though it&#x27;s stated that it wasn&#x27;t an easy process. Archiact also asks for any fellow studios to reach out if they are hiring in numerous fields, which offers a glimpse at how many departments the layoffs affected, from Art and Animation to Engineering. 


Archiact doesn&#x27;t struggle alone, as First Contact Entertainment has announced its closure. According to the developer, the closure was a product of a lack of &quot;lack of support for VR within the industry.&quot; This is a notable event for VR players, as the studio was one of the leaders when it comes to AAA VR experiences, as seen in titles such as Firewall Ultra. 


VR continues to be a tricky platform to master, even for companies as massive as Sony. Fortunately, those who enjoy the gaming experience aren&#x27;t left without any new titles, as games like RE 4 Remake&#x27;s VR mode and Tiger Blade continue to ensure VR libraries are never entirely empty.

                              <span>When Final Fantasy VII launched on PlayStation in 1997, it revolutionized the RPG genre and gaming as a whole. The transition from pixel art to fully animated computer graphics was a massive enough leap ahead, but the beauty of this classic title was much more than skin deep. Final Fantasy VII features an incredible cast of characters, an outstanding battle system, and a story that evokes joy, awe, anger, and grief. Final Fantasy VII is well-established as one of the most iconic and beloved video games of all time, but for Square Enix, the legacy is somewhat more important. 
For the team behind the Final Fantasy franchise, Final Fantasy VII was the entry that made the developers realize they needed to adapt to the times. &quot;Even within the mainline Final Fantasy titles as a series, we can co…</span>

                              <span>Netflix has released the first teaser trailer for season 2 of its hit animated series, Arcane. The next chapter of the League of Legends adaptation is scheduled to premiere this November. 
Since it’s a teaser, the trailer doesn’t reveal much about what’s in store other than an ominous look at a sinister laboratory cooking up experiments that will likely pose a threat to Jinx and Co. We&#x27;re curious to see how the series follows up Season 1&#x27;s dramatic conclusion. Season 2&#x27;s cast includes returning stars Hailee Steinfeld, Ella Purnell, Kevin Alejandro, and Katie Leung. Check out the teaser below:


Arcane has been critically acclaimed by both League of Legends fans and general viewers. Here’s hoping Netflix can keep that momentum rolling into Season 2 this fall.</span>

                              <span>After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora&#x27;s Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora&#x27;s Mask&#x27;s unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 2 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved. Archived episodes will be uploaded each Saturday on our second YouTube channel Game Informer Shows.

                              <span>Persona 3 Reload is right around the corner – it hits PlayStation, Xbox, and PC on February 2. If you&#x27;ve ever played a Persona game, you&#x27;re likely familiar with the &quot;opening movie,&quot; which is the awesome animated opening to the game set to what is typically the main theme song. Ahead of Persona 3 Reload&#x27;s release next month, Atlus has released its opening movie, debuting a brand new track called &quot;Full Moon Full Life.&quot; 
In it, we get a look at the main character and the rest of the cast, as well as Persona, Igor, and more. As you might expect, the opening movie retains the flashy and stylish animation Persona has become known for over the years, and no surprise, it looks great. Atlus notes the trailer contains violent and sensitive content, however, so be wary of that before pressing play. 
Check out the Persona 3 Reload opening movie for yourself below:

At least one of those stories extends far beyond the Forgotten Realms into the real world too, as a fan has revealed the heartfelt tribute that developers Larian included to their father - a long-time CRPG player - diagnosed with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

The update will continue what developers Facepunch Studios say will be even more updates and improvements throughout 2024, even as other long-requested additions slide back to 2025 or later.

                              <span>Over the Christmas holidays, I had very good intentions to finally tackle some of the big games from 2023. I still haven&#x27;t played Resident Evil 4, System Shock, very much of Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 or Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage, and I really wanted to play a bit of Avatar: Frontiers Of Pandora. You know, just for a little look after the quite interesting preview I did back in October. Admittedly, I wasn&#x27;t anywhere near my PC for at least one of the two weeks I had off, as I was away doing the inevitable family roulette of Christmas visiting. I also knew that, even if I had spent the whole time at home, there would be no way I&#x27;d finish or get through all of them. I knew I was sort of setting myself up to fail, but as I said. Good intentions. I did have my Steam Deck with me, after all, and even went to the trouble of loading it up with around 50 games, including some of those biggies that I have on Steam. 
What did I actually end up playing though? Teeny games. Six of &#x27;em, which were all four to six hours long. And some of them I didn&#x27;t even enjoy very much! Why? Why do I do this? In some respects I&#x27;m pleased I managed to clear a bit more of my backlog, but man alive, I always fall into exactly the same trap. I play the shorties, and always leave the biggies, like I&#x27;m allergic to anything over four hours - and I don&#x27;t like it.

                              <span>This past Christmas marked the anniversary of me playing Overwatch 2. 7 years of my partner and I swearing at seemingly impenetrable enemy teams, then whooping in victory when we finally pull together a plan that cracks them apart - or just as our chill W+M1 game while we chat about our days.
For the uninitiated, Overwatch is a bright, colorful, and very funny team v team FPS that ditches the dour gunmen for a cast that doesn’t all require raw aim skill. Spider-themed snipers and six-gun slinging cowboys share space with winged angelic healers and a talking gorilla with a Tesla cannon -  characters who reward positioning and timely ability usage just as much as one’s ability to click on heads. When the game went free to play and slapped a 2 on the end in 2022, it got a more muted reception, but the dev team have displayed a great willingness to experiment. In fact, there&#x27;s never been a better time to give Overwatch 2 a go.

                              <span>Did we put the Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater and Silent Hill 2 remakes on that list of our most anticipated games of 2024? The article is so voluminous I’m not sure I have the energy to check. I get halfway down the page and feel like I need to pitch camp below one of the paragraph breaks, like a mountaineer sleeping beneath a crag in one of those dangling tents. Assuming we didn’t, both have been slated for 2024 release by the PlayStation blog.

                              <span>The first week of January is always one of my favourite times of the year. It&#x27;s a time for making plans, setting goals, thinking about all the cool new games I&#x27;ll be playing over the next 12 months (while also looking nervously at the pile of games I missed over the last 12 months and placing them very, very gingerly on the teetering and totteringly tall pile of my backlog). And, of course, making some new year&#x27;s resolutions. Traditionally, I don&#x27;t often set myself too many resolutions - I always give myself a reading goal (35 books is what I&#x27;m aiming for this year), for example, but the rest I usually play pretty fast and loose with - more &#x27;nice to haves&#x27; rather than &#x27;musts&#x27;, I&#x27;d say. 
This year, though, I do have a few gaming-related resolutions on my list, and in discussing them with the rest of the RPS Treehouse, it turns out we all have some games-themed goals this year. So I thought it would be fun to share them with you all below. And if you&#x27;ve also made some gaming resolutions for 2024, tell us about them in the comments. We can hold ourselves accountable together, like that big curtain of eldritch eyeballs up there in the header from good game Norco.

                              <span>Much as I enjoyed Spellcaster University, I was surprised it was so successful. Its dependency on randomly assigning you buildings differentiated it from the kind of full management game I&#x27;d expected, and which I assumed most people would want.
Happily, I was wrong: it did fine. Happilyer still, Mind Over Magic is here (though in early access) to provide a somewhat more traditional design, and it&#x27;s already compelling enough to turn my quick test into a seven hour delve.

                              <span>I watched Studio Ghibli&#x27;s latest film The Boy And The Heron the other day, having gone in basically blind. I knew it would be the case, but I left the cinema and said to my mate, &quot;I don&#x27;t really know what just happened but what happened was great&quot;. It was a lot of things! A visual feast. Surprisingly goofy. Unsettling. But above all, a challenge. We walked back to our cars and tried - my mate was thrilled to have identified who Dave Bautista likely voiced in the dub (we watched sub) - to unpack what we saw.
Since then, we&#x27;ve listened to podcasts, read interviews, and engaged in some back and forth. It&#x27;s all brought me back to my uni days, where Dark Souls made me get my shovel out for the first time and mine the internet for meaning. Much like Souls, Ghibli&#x27;s latest only expands as you reflect on it.

                              <span>Surgeon Simulator and I Am Bread creators Bossa Studios have laid off around a third of their staff, with 19 people departing the London, UK-based independent in December due to what co-founder Henrique Olifiers has called &quot;a perfect storm of events&quot; - heavy competition from blockbuster games at the backend of last year, increased operating costs, and delayed funding decisions across the industry.

                              <span>Hideo Kojima&#x27;s new Xbox Game Studios project OD is a horror game that is &quot;also a movie, and at the same time a new form of media&quot; and who knows, perhaps it also runs on solar power. That&#x27;s the extremely direct and literal reading of Kojima&#x27;s latest social media tease, in which he compares his latest endeavour to Boktai: The Sun Is In Your Hand, an isometric vampire-hunting game for Game Boy Advance, which Kojima worked on while at Konami in the early noughties. Boktai stands apart to this day for making use of solar energy. There&#x27;s a sun sensor built into the cartridge, which allows you to re-energise your weapon by using the console in sunlight, though this isn&#x27;t outright necessary to prevail.
I doubt OD employs a similar peripheral, though a Steam Deck verified horror game that can only be played outdoors in pleasant weather would be an... interestingly contrary experience. But it&#x27;s an opportunity, at least, to jump aboard one of my personal hobby horses and give you a scrappy rundown of older and recent games that employ similar functionality.

The copyright complaints were filed at Facebook by anti-piracy outfit Markscan, acting on behalf of Plex.

                              <span>The original Outcast was a PC-exclusive, 3D open-world action game that predated Grand Theft Auto III by two years. It was an innovative, well-regarded, but underplayed game about landing on an alien planet and trying to survive in the face of its dangerous fauna. A remake of that game, called Outcast: Second Contact, was released in 2017, but Outcast: A New Beginning is the long overdue, proper sequel to the cult classic.
Join Marcus Stewart and me as we check out what the game has to offer, which is primarily impressive jetpack mechanics that let you literally fly around the alien world at high speeds. Outcast: A New Beginning is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on March 15.

                              <span>PlayStation has released a promotional video highlighting some of the biggest games coming to its console this year. The video hypes both first and third-party releases, many of which already had release dates/windows, but it also casually confirms 2024 launches for two previously un-dated projects.
Specifically, the video labels Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater and Silent Hill 2 as 2024 games. Both games, each a remake of their respective titles, had no launch window prior to today. But the video and the accompanying PlayStation Blog post confirm as much, which is a little surprising to see happen with relatively limited fanfare instead of Konami rolling out individual red carpets for each game&#x27;s launch update. But if you&#x27;re looking forward to playing either title, this is welcomed news nonetheless.


Silent Hill 2 was announced in 2022 as a remake of the 2001 classic and is being developed by Bloober Team. The studio recently shared that work on the game was “progressing smoothly”, and it is a PlayStation 5 console exclusive (but will also launch on PC). 
Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is a Unreal Engine 5 remake of Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. It was announced during a PlayStation Showcase last May, and Konami released its first in-engine gameplay footage last October. Despite its inclusion in today’s PlayStation video, Snake Eater is also coming to Xbox Series X/S and PC.</span>

                              <span>First, there was the Xbox Series X mini-fridge, and now the Series S gets its own appliance in the form of a toaster. Bread will never be the same again. 
Feast your eyes on the officially licensed Series S toaster, which is on sale now at Walmart. The novelty appliance boasts a wide slot to toast thick slices of bread, bagels, waffles, English muffins, and probably most PlayStation discs for the truly devoted. In a neat twist, the oven roasts the Xbox logo on the food itself to add a flavorful touch of corporate branding to your carb intake. 

The toaster also sports a digital LED countdown timer, a six-setting shade selector dial for browning customization, a removable crumb tray, automatic temperature control, and a cool-touch exterior, among other perks. Though a cool appliance, I can’t help but wonder how many people will request a Series S as a gift from friends/family and receive this elaborately disguised kitchen accessory instead. 
Those interested can purchase the Xbox Series S toaster for $39.99.</span>

                              <span>When I was 13 years old, I struggled to beat Cynthia, the Pokémon League champion in Pokémon Platinum. U.S.-based 13-year-old Willis Gibson just beat an unbeatable Tetris game that players have been attempting to complete since its release on the NES in 1989. 
On January 1, Gibson reached level 157 of Tetris, a feat previously thought impossible. New techniques, like the &quot;hypertapping&quot; one discovered in 2010 by Thor Aackerlund (thanks, BBC), and &quot;rolling,&quot; discovered in 2021 according to IGN, allowed players to reach never before seen levels. Before that, getting past the thirties was all but impossible and now, Gibson has made it to level 157. As you can see in the video below, upon reaching that level, Tetris serves Gibson a kill screen – meaning it has crashed – ending his impossible run. 


It took Gibson, who goes by Blue Scuti on YouTube, 38 minutes to reach this new kill screen. BBC reports that Gibson has been playing Tetris for about two years, or since he was 11. Alongside his achievement of reaching level 157, Gibson also obtained the new highest score for Tetris. 
IGN writes that players can theoretically make it to level 255, and players are already trying; they just have to get lucky and avoid the crash points from level 157 onward. Upon beating level 255, players are brought back to the first level. 
For more, be sure to watch Gibson beat the record here, and then read about these Game Informer editors who beat six gaming world records.

                              <span>Super-powered MMO City Of Heroes closed down in November 2012, but in recent years it has been revived by industrious fans via privately-hosted servers. While those servers allowed caped crusaders to continue roleplaying, the caveat was that they could be shut down at any moment by the most dastardly supervillains of all: lawyers.

That should be less of an issue in future. One of those community-hosted servers, Homecoming, has been granted an official license to operate by City Of Heroes&#x27; IP owners NCSoft.

Apex Legends is the latest live service game to take the plunge with its first crossover event. It&#x27;s with Final Fantasy VII Rebirth and it&#x27;ll bring the Buster Sword, Aerith, and other elements from the JRPG to the battle royale on January 9th.

Alas, it didn&#x27;t meet Square Enix&#x27;s sales expectations.

Now it&#x27;s free via the Epic Games Store.

                              <span>I have been bouncing off Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, partly because the new protagonist design leaves me cold, and partly because it being a 2D affair has me yearning for something closer to the 1989 Apple II original, with its finicky platforming and sword-fighting. Katharine says it&#x27;s decent, however, and the latest trailers are intriguing. One is an overview of the new metroidvania&#x27;s locations, of which you can read much more in Katharine&#x27;s last preview. The other is a quick dive into the game&#x27;s approach to accessibility, which appears to be a lot more holistic than you&#x27;ll find in many games.

                              <span>Russian Roulette is just an edgy version of Snakes &amp; Ladders. It&#x27;s pure luck gussied up with high stakes and the cool aesthetic of spinning a six-shooter. A grizzled mafioso whose cheeks glitter with fragments of other people&#x27;s teeth has as much chance of winning Russian Roulette as a sleepy five-year-old in SpongeBob pyjamas. But take Russian Roulette, swap the revolver for a pump-action shotgun, mix up live and dud rounds, and add Inscryption-esque items which let you change the rules, and now you have a more skillful game. That&#x27;s Buckshot Roulette, the latest from Mike Klubnika, the dev behind those excellent horror games about operating machinery. Great weird machines here too.

                              <span>Happy New Year, folks! Have you recovered from the all the 100+ hour RPGs that came out last year? Well, I have good news and bad news for you. The good news is that everyone seems to be taking a bit of a breather in 2024, because (at time of writing at least) the official &quot;big&#x27;uns&quot; calendar is looking remarkably slim at the moment. There are still some heavy-hitters coming our way this year, such as , Star Wars Outlaws and Path Of Exile 2, but 2024 looks like another year where it will be the smaller, independent games that shine the brightest. They certainly make up the bulk of our most anticipated games list for 2024, which the RPS Treehouse has been feverishly putting together over the last few days. The bad news is that there are still loads of great games coming out. So come, join us, and see what&#x27;s on our personal wishlists for 2024.

                              <span>Rockfish have announced that they&#x27;re updating arcade dogfighter Everspace 2 to run on Unreal Engine 5. The engine rollover will arrive as part of or alongside the game&#x27;s Incursions update in spring 2024, which includes tweaks and bugfixes as well as extra legendary items and a new game feature of some description. The idea is less to take advantage of UE5&#x27;s various whizbangs and bellwhistles, like the new Nanite geometry system, than to grease the launch chutes for future Everspace 2 updates and expansions.

                              <span>Having spent some time in Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth&#x27;s Hawaii, I&#x27;ve come to realise that it&#x27;s a wonderful place, home to trams that&#x27;ll let you see the sights and soak in the warm breeze. But moreso than that, it&#x27;s home to the previous game&#x27;s Pokémon parody, Sujimon, which has now kicked into overdrive. From what I can tell, Infinite Wealth is as much a Pokémon trainers paradise as it is a game about the Japanese criminal underworld. I&#x27;m sold.

                              <span>We got our first look at Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth&#x27;s Dondoko Island at last year&#x27;s Xbox Partner showcase. Right as it dropped, I was in New York giving the Animal Crossing-esque minigame a go myself, albeit for a quickfire half hour of bashing rubbish bags with a baseball bat and plonking a urinal on the dirt to satisfy a tutorial. Still, in that brief time I&#x27;ve come away thinking I could lose much of my life to the promise of converting a polluted island into an idyll with the power of abs and friendship. There is the strong possibility of a grind. But hey, it&#x27;s optional!

                              <span>Well, well, well. Of all the detectives in all the world, she came to me. She was a dame with hair red as communion wine spilled by a bishop looking at a nun&#x27;s cleava- oh what, wait, she&#x27;s how old? Christ, Philip, get your head out of the gutter for once, this is a family website. I was previously a snob about the Nancy Drew point and click puzzle games, and then came to regret it when a fan of them (very nicely) emailed me explaining they&#x27;re actually really good. We&#x27;re going to find out for ourselves by playing them. There are north of 30 in total, and I will update the rankings at the end of each article.
The first is 1998&#x27;s Nancy Drew: Secrets Can Kill, in which Nancy solves the murder of a Floridian highschooler named Jake Roberts, and there&#x27;s a lot to love about it right away. There&#x27;s a restrained cast, three locations in total, and the school sports team is called the Fighting Manatees. Thus the icon for the game is a lil&#x27; cartoon manatee - and to be absolutely accurate, this is the remastered version of the game from 2010, not the original 90s version. I&#x27;m as disappointed as you.

Twitch have updated their attire policies to stop an outbreak of &quot;implied nudity&quot; among thirstier streamers, who have taken to filming themselves nude with black censor bars, or positioning the camera to suggest that they&#x27;re fully or partially naked outside the frame.

                              <span>&quot;Accessible design is good design&quot;.
One of the first major releases this year is Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, the first brand-new console game in the series since 2010&#x27;s The Forgotten Sands (yes, really!). And recently, developer Ubisoft has unveiled the upcoming release&#x27;s frame rate, resolution and accessibility options on Switch.
And it&#x27;s good news for Switch owners for this upcoming Metroidvania-style take on the legendary franchise. Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown will run at 60fps on the Switch, both handheld and docked. This was stated by The Game Awards&#x27; host Geoff Keighley way back in the summer of 2023, but it&#x27;s good to get the official word. Handheld, the resolution will be at 720p while docked it&#x27;ll be 1080p — standard stuff, then.

                              <span>Step away from the stereotype.
For anybody who plays video games on a regular basis, it&#x27;s long been a joke that when the mainstream media discusses gaming in any capacity, they&#x27;ll inevitably bring up how games are surprisingly popular, how it&#x27;s not just socially-challenged dweebs in their bedrooms anymore, and how video games are big business. Did you know that the gaming industry is bigger than Hollywood? Yes, Steve. Everyone knows that.
Despite this, the mainstream stereotype is largely still that gamers are socially-challenged dweebs who need to get out more. You&#x27;d think that people would know better by now — and in some cases, it&#x27;s difficult to imagine how they don&#x27;t know better — but here we are; still being told to take a shower, leave the house, touch grass, and expand our horizons beyond a high score and a flagpole.

After being revealed last October, publisher QUByte Interactive has today announced that the Top Racer Collection will no longer be coming to Switch later this month, but will instead be returning to the pit lane until 7th March 2024.
The collection comprises the three SNES titles in the Top Gear series (albeit with the licence-free &#x27;Top Racer&#x27; title) — Top Gear, Top Gear 2 and Top Gear 3000 — and also includes a series crossover with Horizon Chase, Top Gear Crossroads.

The Trails / Kiseki series might be one of the biggest RPG franchises around right now — at least, in terms of size and scope.
This storied JRPG saga takes place on the continent of Zemuria and follows different interlinking arcs, characters, and stories. Everything is carefully interconnected, with events affecting other storylines and characters frequently reappearing in future games. And with a staggering 12 mainline games to follow — with a 13th coming out in Japan later this year — its reputation is nothing short of prolific.

The former Team-Xecuter member, who was previously jailed and fined $10 million in damages, rejected these latest allegations doing the rounds online, claiming he&#x27;s &quot;not involved&quot; with this new device known as &#x27;MIG Switch&#x27;.

City of Heroes was taken offline back in 2012 despite still having a reportedly healthy player base. Fans were able to put up private servers for the game a few years ago. This was an extremely secretive thing a few years ago, but eventually it became more widely available as City of Heroes: Homecoming. The team behind it went as far as providing content updates to the game, integrating previously paid content into the base game for free and expanding the classes and abilities within the game.


However, there was always the threat that NCSoft would come along and force City of Heroes: Homecoming to shut down. Regardless of whether or not th…</span>

                              <span>Destiny 2 and developer Bungie don&#x27;t have the best reputation with the MMO&#x27;s community right now, and that sentiment continues to pop up even in smaller ways. That rings true for this year&#x27;s Dawning event, too, as it seems Destiny&#x27;s snowball feature remains broken.


More specifically, special throwable snowballs are a unique feature of Destiny 2&#x27;s seasonal Dawning celebrations. Only appearing for a limited time, snowballs have an entire series of upgrades dedicated to them as part of the Dawning progression system, as they allow players to take down enemies and apply crowd control via Stasis effects. Further, snowballs also spice up the regular gameplay loop, as they appear in Patrol Zones and playlist activities while the Dawning is active.

                              <span>The developer of 2021’s Buck Up and Drive, Fábio Fontes, has been showing off his work on the upcoming sequel. While it’s still early in development, things look to be progressing well on the title.


If you’re unfamiliar, Buck Up and Drive, it’s similar to Out Run if it was taken to its furthest extremes. You not only race against time, but you also flip the hell out, performing absurd stunts that look like your car got stuck in the level geometry, and the physics don&#x27;t know how to cope. There’s also drifting and rail-grinding, the normal sort of thing you’d expect from a racing game. It was part of my list of 2021 games you might have missed, which is what I did before just making the usual top 10 list every year.




Buck Up and Drive 2 looks to be expanding on that. I’m not sure how that’s possible, but Fábio Fontes obviously has the answer: driving on walls. Do you remember the Spider-Mobile from the 1970’s Spider-Man comics? It’s a lot like that but less dumb. Also shown off is character customization. I’m not sure why, but I’ll take it.


Buck Up and Drive 2 is built in the Godot Engine, probably because Fontes had a falling out with the GameMaker Engine following their move to a subscription model. Thankfully, the billboards have returned for the sequel. Some players complained about the original game’s common use of pride flags as billboards, so in response, Fontes added a “Pride Flag Billboard Toggle.” When toggled, it simply adds more pride flags. Respect.


Buck Up and Drive 2 is coming to PC. There is no stated release window, as it is still early in development.

The Tokyo Fan Festival is happening this weekend, and, in celebration, Square Enix is holding a massive 50% off sale on some Final Fantasy XIV editions, including Endwalker. This is the biggest discount you&#x27;ll likely see for a while, so if there’s someone in your life who you know would love Eorzea as much as you do, or even if you simply want another copy for a different platform, now’s the time to bite.

                              <span>QUByte Interactive has announced that their upcoming collection of the Top Racer series has been pushed back from its January 11 release date, to the new target of March 7. In the meantime, a demo that includes three tracks will be available on Steam starting January 11.




I knew these games as Top Gear. It was hard not to look at it as a kid since the cover features a car (possibly) driving away from an explosion. It was similar to Race Drivin’ in terms of its eye-catching cover, but unlike Race Drivin’, Top Gear is actually a decent series.


Created by Gremlin Games Studios, the series started out on 16-bit consoles as racing games that use a raster effect to depict a 3D-like road. It distinguishes itself from games like Out Run by having tracks that actually circle back on themselves, which was uncommon for the particular sub-genre. It also had more of a tournament racing feel with pitstops and ongoing rankings. It also had split-screen multi-player, kind of like Outrunners on Genesis, but not as terrible.


Though Top Gear 2 was ported to other platforms, the series stayed faithful to Nintendo platforms for a long time. After three games on the SNES, the series shifted to N64, with Boss Studios and Midway handling Top Gear Rally.


Top Racer Collection assembles Top Racer (Gear), Top Racer 2, and Top Racer 3000 into one package. On top of that, they’re including Top Racer Crossroads, which is a new title that features four new cars, including one that is plainly the Ferrari Testarossa featured in Out Run. I can dig it.


Top Racer Collection launches March 7, 2024 for PC, Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S.

                              <span>For those who want to engage in more adult-orientated streaming, it seems like Twitch is not the best place for it. However, the Amazon-owned platform clearly has to deal with it, and a new policy update aims to clamp down on broadcasters casting their broads, so to speak.




Over on the Twitch website, the company says that, as of yesterday, it&#x27;ll be cracking down on any &#x27;implied nudity.&#x27; As the post itself says:



This update is in response to a recent meta on Twitch in which streamers use black censor bars or other items to block their bodies or clothing, or position the camera frame such that the viewer is led to believe that the streamer is fully or partially nude.




As of January 3, streamers will be required to make sure there is no suggestion that they may be hiding obvious nudity. The update specifies that, where required, &quot;coverage must be fully opaque,&quot; adding that &quot;sheer or partially see-through clothing does not constitute coverage.&quot;


Adults only...kind of


Given that Twitch is largely a place where people go to watch content creators play games or engage in creative activities, it stands to reason that sexual or adult content would not be encouraged.


However, the site recently updated another policy, which introduced a new label for streams classed as having &quot;sexual content.&quot; This means content such as &quot;erotic dances&quot; and &quot;fictionalized&quot; nudity are allowed, providing they are correctly labeled. Full nudity...still a massive no-no, however. Also, streams of this nature are not present on the homepage.


As for the update to the attire policy, Twitch has made it clear that it does not want streamers to be presenting themselves with &quot;implied nudity.&quot; The post states that such content will have its label changed to a more appropriate one, while repeat offenses will &quot;lead to an enforcement action.&quot;

                              <span>Yuzo Koshiro and Ancient Corp have stated via Twitter that their modern Genesis/Mega Drive game, Earthion is aiming for release this summer at the earliest. The composer has also announced that plans to bring it to modern consoles are underway.




Earthion is a scrolling shoot-’em-up in development for the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive. While that is not entirely unique in these days of homebrew development, what makes Earthion special is that it’s being helmed by Yuzo Koshiro, the legendary composer behind games such as Streets of Rage and Revenge of Shinobi. While he did compositions for SNES games like Actraiser, Robotrek, and Super Adventure Island, he’s perhaps best known for his Genesis contributions. His company, Ancient Corp, beyond collaborating with other developers, also created Beyond Oasis for the console.


The company has been tinkering with Earthion as far back as 2022, with its big reveal happening at Tokyo Game Show 2023. There, Ancient demonstrated the game’s tremendous bosses and fancy scaling effects.


While Koshiro has moved on to composing for modern platforms with games such as the Etrian Odyssey series, he hasn’t lost his appreciation for old hardware. For Ancient’s recent game, Gotta Protectors: Cart of Darkness, there’s a suite of DLC available that changes the soundtrack to versions arranged for various consoles. This includes not only PC-88 and Mega Drive platforms but even less common consoles such as the Wonderswan. It feels very fitting that his company would eventually go back and create and new game for an old console.


Earthion is aiming for a Summer 2024 release (at the earliest) on Genesis/Mega Drive. Modern console versions are planned, but none have been confirmed. Physical distribution in the West will be handled by Limited Run Games.

                              <span>Originally launched in 2014, the mobile app Kim Kardashian: Hollywood is shutting down. 


Players logging in will be met with a message informing them that the game no longer accepts in-app purchases and has been removed from mobile stores. In-game currency will be usable until April 2024, at which point the game will become inaccessible. 


In a statement to TMZ, Kim stated that she realized that &quot;it’s time to focus that energy into other passions&quot; though she does give thanks to &quot;the Glu team and the many people behind the scenes who have worked diligently on making it a success.&quot; 


Glu has plenty to be grateful for too, as in Q3 2014, the game generated 54% of its revenue, according to Games Industry. As Forbes reports, by 2016, the mobile title had been downloaded 45 million times and generated $160 million in revenue. 


Although highly successful, it doesn&#x27;t leave the mobile gaming industry with a dearth of titles. Plenty of companies have recognized the profit potential and want a slice of it, including Xbox.

                              <span>Microsoft hasn&#x27;t been afraid to have fun with its consoles and feature them as various appliances, including a fridge. One of the latest Xbox redesigns comes in the form of a Series S toaster that you can pick up at Walmart. 


We got our first glimpses last year when a French Twitter account posted images of the toaster along with its specs. It&#x27;s now finally available for purchase, and it does everything you would want from a two-slice toaster, including a six-setting shade selector dial to get your toast just right. 


With a wide slot, it can sort out your artisan loaf bread slices, &quot;bagels, frozen waffles, Texas toast, or English muffins.&quot; It also has an anti-jam function and as an attractive bonus, it also can imprint the Xbox sphere logo on your bread. To keep things from getting messy, you&#x27;ll also get a removable crumb tray and non-stick-coated plates. 


Some high-tech features include a digital LED countdown timer as well as the ability to keep a list of the different preferred settings of household members. At $39.99, it&#x27;s not out of reach for the sufficiently motivated Xbox fan. 


To complete the Xboxification of your life, throw in the Xbox Mastercard as well as the Wonka-inspired console and controller.

                              <span>In 2020, the Yakuza series took a bit of a leap with its seventh entry, Yakuza: Like a Dragon. The lens shifted away from longtime series protagonist Kazuma Kiryu to newcomer Kasuga Ichiban, swapping out its real-time action for turn-based RPG combat in the process. It was, by most accounts, a rousing success. But there was still room to grow.


Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, then, seems like even more like a passing of the torch than its predecessor. And it was this shared custody of the spotlight that made me a bit nervous, going into a preview session way back in October. How would the focus manage both Kiryu and Ichiban? Why, after seeing one character hand the reins to the next, did we need to retread that ground?




After playing a hefty amount of Infinite Wealth, it seems like Ryu…</span>

Many people have fond memories of managing a rising business or running a cabaret club in previous entries. But Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth is going somewhere new with Dondoko Island.


In the upcoming Infinite Wealth, Ichiban can wash up on a run-down version of Dondoko Island. And, with the help of some locals, he can start to rebuild it too. Whether picking up trash, farming resources, or placing down new decorations, the island can go from deserted to a real tourist attraction.





I got to play a slice of the earliest portions of Dondoko Island at a recent preview event, seeing just how Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio’s approach to island living worked. And I have to sa…</span>

                              <span>It&#x27;s been a weird trajectory for Starfield. It went from being the most anticipated game of this generation to boring the pants off players to winning a Steam Award (though some are curious as to how that came to be). In any case, it hasn&#x27;t quite gone away yet, and the modding community is still engaging with it.


One such example comes from user Korodic, who&#x27;s attempting to put something into Starfield that Bethesda never did. It&#x27;s mechs. I&#x27;m talking about being able to control giant mechs. To be honest, the title of this article sort of gave it away.




The above video shows the current work-in-progress, in which the player can pilot one of these huge machines, rather than them being stationary models, as the developer intended. At the moment, there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any release date for the mod, but it&#x27;s worth keeping an eye on if you are still playing the game.


So much potential seemingly wasted


I can&#x27;t in all good conscience say that Starfield is a bad game. It&#x27;s just not what people were hoping for. More fool us, perhaps? But the fact that it currently has a &quot;Mostly Negative&quot; score on Steam shows just how far it&#x27;s fallen since it was released last September.


Of course, the story&#x27;s not over yet. Bethesda has plans to bring some new elements to Skyrim-in-space. An end-of-year update on the official website suggests 2024 will be Starfield&#x27;s year.


With updates inbound &quot;roughly every six weeks&quot; starting next month and some intriguing implementations being teased, Todd Howard seems determined to make sure you enjoy the game he&#x27;s been dying to make for two and a half decades. Come hell or high water.

                              <span>If you&#x27;ve never tried a Skyrim mod before – either on PC or console – you are truly missing out. The vanilla release just doesn&#x27;t seem to cut it these days for a lot of fans, so the modding community has dedicated itself to making TES5 as brilliant, everlasting, and immersive as all get out.


With that in mind, Nexus Mods user JaySerpa is back once more with further Skyrim improvements. This time, they&#x27;ve made it so NPCs react to being attacked by one of their friends. The video below shows it in action.




Essentially, when you use a Frenzy spell – which temporarily turns enemies against each other – there&#x27;s no vocal reaction to what&#x27;s happening. This mod, however, uses spliced and vanilla dialogue from the game to make NPCs actually care an ally has turned against them. You can download it here (as the creator says, it&#x27;s a measly 7MB, so you may as well).


&quot;No! We&#x27;ve been betrayed!&quot;


Some of you who are very familiar with the Skyrim modding scene will likely know JaySerpa&#x27;s work. Fresh off their recent Christmas mod, this latest effort is yet another way of injecting that extra bit of immersion into the aging RPG.


It&#x27;s also one of the reasons TES5 is still going strong after all these years. It&#x27;s highly unlikely the game would enjoy such longevity without the community tweaking the base release, keeping things fresh for who knows how long.


Whether The Elder Scrolls 6 will get the same modding treatment remains to be seen, but let&#x27;s not get ahead of ourselves just yet. Bethesda still hasn&#x27;t given us an update on its whereabouts or development stage.

Final Fantasy VII Remake gave fans of the original game quite a shock as Cloud and the party exited Midgar. Zack, the protagonist of Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII and a key figure in Cloud, Aerith, and Sephiroth&#x27;s past, appears to be alive, and helped an injured Cloud reach Midgar. This stands in stark contrast to his fate in the original continuity, where he was killed and his Buster Sword was handed over to Cloud. 
Zack&#x27;s changed fate is emblematic of how the Final Fantasy VII Remake and Rebirth teams approached the source material. &quot;If we trace the original and stay exactly loyal to it a…</span>

                              <span>On January 1, Steamboat Willie, the cartoon that introduced the world to Mickey Mouse, entered the public domain, meaning the first version of Disney’s iconic mascot is (mostly) free to use by anyone. And just like when the film Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey took advantage of that whimsical character entering the public domain, someone has already started making a twisted, horrifying version of Mickey. In this case, it’s a video game.
It’s called Infestation: Origins, and it’s the debut title by Nightmare Forge Games. The game is an episodic four-player co-op survival adventure in which players control exterminators tasked with killing mutated vermin – and one of them happens to be a terrifying, person-sized monster modeled after Mickey. Similar to games like Phasmophobia and Lethal Com…</span>

You&#x27;ll need to log in to your GI account and click &quot;okay to print&quot; for your letter or question to go through.

For each issue, we ask our community a question for our SoundOff section. This time around, we want to know...
&quot;Which gaming platform do you see yourself using the most in 2024 and why?&quot;
You can answer this question and/or include any other feedback/questions you want. Thank you again for your support throughout the years, and we hope many of you get the chance to have your letter printed in an upcoming issue!

                              <span>Jack Black has joined the cast of the in-development live-action Minecraft movie. Rumors about this casting popped up yesterday, January 2, with Deadline reporting that Black would play Steve (the Minecraft guy with the teal shirt and blue pants). Notably, Black starred as the villainous Bowser in The Super Mario Bros. Movie last year, giving us the instant-classic &quot;Peaches,&quot; too. 
Following that report, other outlets, like Variety, further confirmed that Black would be starring in Minecraft alongside previously announced cast members like Jason Momoa (Aquaman, Game of Thrones), Danielle Brooks (The Color Purple), and Emma Myers (Wednesday). Black himself even nodded to the news in an Instagram post that showed him reading a Minecraft Basics for Dummies book. However, neither he nor the fi…</span>

                              <span>Dave the Diver has surpassed 3 million units sold, developer Mintrocket has revealed. The studio announced this achievement on X today, alongside some new art from the game to celebrate the milestone. Selling 3 million units is no small feat, especially considering Dave the Diver is Mintrocket&#x27;s first game. 
In Dave the Diver, players control Dave as he dives during the day to find treasure, fish, complete quests, and more. At night, Dave runs a sushi restaurant, and the game mixes its adventure gameplay with its simulation gameplay really well – read more about that in Game Informer&#x27;s Dave the Diver review.

Dave the Diver received great word-of-mouth at the time of its PC release in June, bolstered further by a Switch release later in October. It also crossed over with indie hit Dredge last month. Shortly before that crossover, Dave the Diver picked up a nomination for Best Independent Game at The Game Awards 2023.

Ta připomeňme zahrnuje mimo jiné nutnost instrukčních sad jako AVX / AVX2, podporu FMA či VEX. Bylo-li by toto schváleno, RHEL by už neběžel na Xeonech rodin Sandy Bridge a Ivy Bridge ani na čemkoli od AMD před jádry Excavator.</span>

That&#x27;s 50% off its original price and a solid $10 off its usual going price, making it well worth picking up.

                              <span>Montech&#x27;s King 95 Pro was chosen as TechPowerUp&#x27;s runner-up PC case of the year, and now it&#x27;s discounted to a historic low in the UK: £114, a solid price for a full-size dual-chamber design with six RGB fans included, tonnes of useful features and excellent thermal performance.
That deal price is for the blue version, but the white version (shown below) is also relatively affordable at £125 if you&#x27;d prefer a trendy gleaming design.

                              <span>Xbox have revealed their first haul of games headed to PC Game Pass in 2024, and there are some corkers. Among the selection is one of - if not the - best horror games ever made, a whopping Assassin’s Creed that ranks as one of the better entries in the series and some other interesting picks, too. Let’s get stuck in.

                              <span>In 2024, I am learning to do cryptic crosswords. Last year I complained about Puzzmo&#x27;s crossword clues being very US-centric and Excors commented that US and UK puzzles seem very different, both in their form and in the fact that UK crosswords are often crytpic. Which is true! Often if you see a &quot;quick crossword&quot; in a UK paper that means &quot;crossword with clues that are general knowledge questions and not an archaic set of riddles - you know, for if you&#x27;re waiting for the kettle to boil, or are an idiot&quot;. So I decided to look into how you actually do cryptics. It&#x27;s way harder than I thought, but at the same time I did not realise it&#x27;s just smug puns.

                              <span>I greet news of the completion of a Unity remaster for The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall with equal parts excitement and horror. Excitement because I have never played Daggerfall and it is one of the weirder, more fantastical Elder Scrolls RPGs - the one with multiple endings which sequels have explained away as somehow all being canon thanks to a metaphysical event called a Dragon Break, whereby timelines branch and reconnect. And horror because I have never played Daggerfall, which is said to be 620,000 square miles in size, and I&#x27;m getting to that point in life where I seriously ask myself whether I can finish certain games before I perish.
Still the journey is more important than reaching the destination, right? Perhaps I can treat it like an occasional walking sim.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a sucker for games where swords are the pointy death delivery devices they truly are, rather than the big, blunt sticks so many turn them into. First Cut: Samurai Duel seems to be aiming its blades at my heart, then. It&#x27;s a 2D sidescrolling swordfighter in which each connecting blow means instant death, and it has a January 17th release date.

                              <span>OpenTrackr is a content-neutral torrent tracker that facilitates millions of BitTorrent transfers. The service doesn&#x27;t store any files and is not privy to what people share. However, when asked to, it will block &#x27;infringing&#x27; hashes that may lead people to pirated files. To prevent abuse, several thousand hashes were banned over the past year.

In parallel, the Vietnamese government has just published a list of sites subject to an advertising ban, which includes some of the most resilient football piracy sites.

                              <span>Update: Earlier today, a Disney Parks blog pointed to Star Wars Outlaws releasing in late 2024, but the term &quot;late&quot; has now been removed from the post so that is now reads just 2024. Ubisoft also confirmed to Kotaku that, &quot;the timing was incorrect and has since been amended.&quot; So, Star Wars Outlaws&#x27; release window has moved from late 2024 back to some general time this year.
Original story:
Star Wars Outlaws, Ubisoft&#x27;s upcoming open-world Star Wars game, has enjoyed a vague 2024 release window since it was revealed at an Xbox Showcase last year. However, a recent post on Disney&#x27;s official park blog has given the game a more specific window. According to the blog, Star Wars Outlaws is releasing late 2024. The blog post, which is a collection of 24 exciting Disney-things happening in 2024 reads, &quot;And for Star Wars fans – Star Wars Outlaws, the open-world Star Wars game is set to release late this year.&quot;
Star Wars Outlaws follows an original Star Wars character named Kay Vess and seeks to explore a character archetype of the Star Wars universe we haven&#x27;t spent much time with in video games: the Han Solo-inspired scoundrel. In the game, Vess (who has no Jedi abilities as far as we know) must survive by her wits and her ability to talk (or blast) her way through difficult situations.
For more on Star Wars Outlaws, you can read our interview with the game&#x27;s narrative director, Navid Khavari, where we covered topics like whether or not the game will have an overlap with Shadows of the Empire and if the team has been communicating with Respawn regarding its Jedi series of games. The game is planned for release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</span>

                              <span>Scaring players has helped put the small team at Red Candle Games on the map. Its first two titles, Detention and Devotion, impressed and terrified fans with frighteningly strong horror chops, but the team is leaving that behind to tackle something completely different in Nine Sols. This side-scrolling action platformer blends sci-fi with Chinese mythology and is Red Candle’s most ambitious project yet. This significant step forward affords an opportunity to look back on the studio’s young history, so we spoke with co-founder Vincent Yang to learn about how a small band of gamers in Taiwan formed one of the industry’s most promising – and, at one time, controversial – indie studios.
Red Candle Games began in 2014 when designer Coffee Yao was developing a prototype for Detention. The side-s…</span>

                              <span>Beginning in 1989, the Prince of Persia series enjoyed consistent attention, with its longest break between releases being six years between Prince of Persia 2: The Shadow and the Flame and the better-left forgotten Prince of Persia 3D. 2003’s Sands of Time and its two sequels marked a new era for Prince and, in many ways, laid the foundation for Ubisoft’s most successful franchise, Assassin’s Creed. The 2008 Prince of Persia reboot didn’t reignite the series as Ubisoft had hoped, and 2010’s Forgotten Sands felt closer to a movie tie-in than a new, proper entry.
That game’s subtitle would end up being a portend of the future as the series seemed inexplicably lost to time. Though not completely ignored, thanks to the occasional cameo in other Ubisoft games and underplayed mobile releases, w…</span>

The Mexica journey to central Mexico; Moses leading the Jewish people across the desert; the founding of Rome – as told by Virgil – by those that fled the fall of Troy. Unsurprisingly, then, video games also tell stories of migration. On August 8, 2013, game designer Lucas Pope, the man behind the studio 3909, released Papers, Please, a game about managing migration.
Papers, Please, subtitled “A Dystopian Document Thriller,” was for some the first time they played a game whose core design ethos challenged their worldviews and understanding. Other games have placed the topic of migration front and center. Path Out (Causa Creations, 2014), an adventure game that retells the journe…</span>

This brings to an end several years of uncertainty and litigation, which saw the Lovecraftian RPG delisted from Steam several times and at one point restored by its publisher via an allegedly pirated version of the game. 

The downside is that an updated version of the game is coming to all storefronts in the coming weeks and it won&#x27;t be compatible with old save files.

                              <span>The player-voted Steam Awards have reached their conclusion, and the results are about as weird as the nominees. In fact, I&#x27;d go so far as to say that the weirdest game possible won in several categories, such as Red Dead Redemption 2 for the Labor Of Love award and Starfield for &quot;Most Innovative Gameplay&quot;.

                              <span>Tim Cain wrote what is perhaps gaming’s most famous and influential monologue: the introduction to Fallout. “War never changes,” he says. “People loved it. I’m like, ‘I must be a writer.’” Yet much more recently, when Cain sat down to write his memoirs, nobody really liked what came out on the page. “I was really, really bad at it,” he says. “I had half a dozen people read it, and they all pretty much said that the stories were good, but my writing wasn’t.”


Cain’s writing strengths, as fellow Fallout originator Leonard Boyarsky has suggested, lie in shortform. Which was bad news for anyone who wanted to read the definitive account of his four decades at the heart of Interplay, Troika and Obsidian, three of the most important RPG studios of all time. Thankfully, though, it turns out Cain is a natural raconteur. The same anecdotes that appeared flat and toneless in his memoirs go down a storm on YouTube. There, for the past seven months, Cain has been delivering his stories straight to camera, as if at a dinner party with 73,500 other people. “When I started the channel, I would effectively just look at something in the book and be like, ‘I’ll tell that story today,’” he says. “Now I spend as much time answering questions and doing videos based on things people ask about.”

Announced via a Disney Parks blog post of all things, Star Wars Outlaws ranks as the No.22 most &quot;Ooooh-Worthy Thing&quot; out of the 2024 Disney Experiences line-up - which, considering the list only stretches to 24 entries is a bit of an unfair burn on the game, if you ask me, especially when No.21 is... *checks notes* new Disney Eats and Stitch clothes collections.

                              <span>Listen, I know we&#x27;ve spent the better part of the holidays harping on about all our favourite games of 2023 (and many more besides as part of our bonus Selection Boxes), but here&#x27;s another one for you that I mainlined in a single day over Christmas and absolutely loved. It&#x27;s Makoto Wakaido&#x27;s Case Files Trilogy Deluxe - a collection of not three, but four detective stories in which you go about solving grizzly murders across different towns and villages in Japan. In short: if you like the investigation bits of Ace Attorney and need something to whet your appetite before the Apollo Justice Trilogy comes out on January 25th, this will be 100% up your street. It&#x27;s currently just over a fiver in the Steam Winter Sale, and there&#x27;s a free demo you can try as well for good measure.

                              <span>Square Enix representative director and president Takashi Kiryu has written a new year&#x27;s letter outlining the Final Fantasy publisher&#x27;s plans for 2024, while offering a few reflections on the year that was. The topline: they want to do more with generative &quot;AI&quot; machine learning tools,  and they&#x27;re still dead keen on metaversy VR/AR stuff. The blockchain remains a &quot;focus&quot;, too, though it gets much less of a billing than in 2023&#x27;s new year letter from Square Enix’s previous president Yosuke Matsuda.

                              <span>Happy new year all. What&#x27;s the weather like where you are? We&#x27;ve got Amber and Yellow warnings in London - I do not understand what these terms mean, but I&#x27;m going to add a Sapphire warning for escalating Maw activity. The creature was pretty lively over the Xmas weekend, but Graham managed to soothe it with posts about gaming-related new year resolutions and, of all things, the Spike Video Game Awards. We can expect the Maw&#x27;s petulance to mount during January, a lean month for announcements and revelations, but there are a few tasty morsels in the offing - a new Prince of Persia and Tekken 8, for instance. Fingers crossed we can build up some kind of momentum.
Some new game releases we are pointing our telescopes at this week: Skeleton Rebellion (4th Jan), a scrappy offbeat RPG with claymation elements in which you are a skeleton trying to overthrow some mages, and The Night Is Grey (5th Jan), a point-and-click adventure about a beardy bloke and a little girl stuck in the woods with some weirdo wolves. If you like, you can also play a free drinking game I&#x27;ve just invented in which you do a shot for every time I accidentally write 2023 instead of 2024.

Screen Media Ventures previously tried to join a related suit but filed its own when a federal court denied the request.

Final Fantasy VII is full of iconic scenes. Whether you&#x27;re talking about the well-known sequences already depicted in Remake or the upcoming gut-punch at the Forgotten Capital, the Remake trilogy allows fans to experience these moments in their most fully realized forms. While this middle portion of Final Fantasy VII, which Rebirth depicts, focuses on Aerith and the looming specter of Sephiroth, so much of Rebirth&#x27;s depiction emphasizes the deepening of relationships.
This is true with how the developers approached both the main story and side content in Rebirth, and it&#x27;s sure to make it so …</span>

                              <span>Happy New Year! Now that 2024 is here, it’s time to push it the hell out of the way and look ahead to 2025. At least, that’s what it feels like the game industry is increasingly saying I should do. A number of recently revealed titles have been slapped with 2025 release windows, so I can’t help but wonder how next year will shape up and, most importantly, what the awards seasons will look like.  
There are still hundreds of games yet to fill the 2025 release calendar, but let’s pretend they won’t exist. Let’s say 95% of the game industry collectively decided to take a year off. Making games is obscenely hard, and to avoid crunch, everyone decided to take some well-deserved (and well-compensated) R&amp;R, so these seven titles are the only ones to launch in 2025.

                              <span>As 1983 came into focus, the future of video games in North America looked bleak. Store shelves were crowded with poorly made games, and consumer interest waned substantially. Developers that ushered in the “golden age” of arcades and the first two generations of home consoles began to crash and burn at an alarming pace. In no time, the once billion-dollar industry was reduced to rubble.
In the summer of that same year, in Japan, gaming giant Nintendo released its first-ever home console with swappable cartridges. With its striking red and gold design, the Family Computer, better known as the Famicom, brought arcade hits like Donkey Kong and Mario Bros. into Japanese homes.
While the Famicom would go on to revitalize the North American gaming market as the VHS-inspired Nintendo Entertainme…</span>

                              <span>Fallout: London has been in the works for five years now, culminating in a seriously impressive mod for Fallout 4 that’s essentially a brand new game set in a radiated England rather than North America. After missing its planned release window in 2023, it now has a full release date - and it’s only a few months away.

I&#x27;m writing this in the distant past of mid-December, a period of total spiritual desolation. If all has gone to plan, I am currently waving a goblet over my head like some kind of hipster barbarian, and trying to finish all the dodgy vegan Xmas food I&#x27;ve cooked which the rest of my family won’t eat, the savages.
I have now read our so-called RPS 2023 Advent Calendar and found it to be woefully deficient in flirty rebels, lunar deities and stage coaches packed with damned adventurers. Never fear, however, because by happy coincidence I have also now written an end-of-year/start-of-year round-up article about these very things.

Each year the Sugar Plum Fairy has to collect more wishes to power the spells every year (you can help to make the spells more powerful by joining the RPS supporter program). While she&#x27;s out wish-hunting, here are some Christmas Crackers to distract you.
Time to enjoy your lovely joke!

                              <span>With refreshed SUPER cards expected in the month ahead, mid-range RTX 40-series graphics cards are seeing heavy discounts at many retailers. One deal that caught our eye this morning is this deal on a Gigabyte RTX 4070 Windforce 3X OC model, which is down to £530.58 when bought from Amazon US via Amazon UK. 
The deal price, which includes shipping and import duty, is significantly cheaper than UK-based options from major GPU makers which are in the £560 to £600 range. However, there are cheaper UK options if you&#x27;re happy with a smaller, non-overclocked Palit card. Palit is more of a budget brand, but is built around the same Nvidia GPU and therefore offers the same performance.

At the start of 2023, the main culprits managed less than three weeks while others were still sending them two days ago.

                              <span>Everyone&#x27;s saying 2023 has been a stonking year for video games. To be honest dear reader, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s been my year. That might be because I&#x27;ve not had a huge amount of time to play loads outside of review duties and general life things, but there&#x27;s only been, like, less than a handful of games that have truly commanded my attention.
One of said games comes backflipping in right at the tailend of this year: Astral Ascent. It&#x27;s a 2D roguelike in the vein of Dead Cells, where you battle through stages, power-up, try and get as far as you can, inevitably die, reinvest your winnings, power-up permanently, then go again. It saddens me that I&#x27;ve not seen much excitement for the game elsewhere, so here I am with a little pudding for you. A little treat. Here comes the plane, nyaaaooownnn.

                              <span>Greetings all! Hope you&#x27;re enjoying a Christmas with an appropriate degree of merriment. Me, I&#x27;m not. I&#x27;m angry. I&#x27;m fuming. Why? Because the RPS 2023 Advent Calendar is wrong. It&#x27;s wrong, I tell you!
If all were just and right in the world, then it wouldn&#x27;t have left out the following list of excellent games that came out this year! Plus a couple others that came out of early access in 2023 but which I sadly don&#x27;t have time to write about in full. Trust me, The Last Spell and Against The Storm are both phenomenal games as well.
Anyway: in this handsomely decorated selection box, you&#x27;ll find four of my honourable mentions for games I&#x27;ve enjoyed playing the most this year. If you have a hole in your Steam library, maybe these will help fill it over the Christmas break!

Each year the Sugar Plum Fairy has to collect more wishes to power the spells every year (you can help to make the spells more powerful by joining the RPS supporter program). While she&#x27;s out wish-hunting, here are some Christmas Crackers to distract you.
Time to enjoy your lovely joke!

RARBG can&#x27;t be forgotten either, and we certainly have to make a pause at the Flawless prosecution too.

                              <span>I’m going to level with you, readers. Probably something like 70% of my 2023 games time was spent on precisely two co-op shooters, neither of which I’ve written about much, nor were new enough to be eligible for the most recent Advent Calendar. I apparently have a type. I’m sorry.
Still, while the man’s rules prevent me from recommending Deep Rock Galactic or Darktide, I do have a few picks that fell short of full Advent Calendar glory. And they’re all... colourful, quite short indie platformers? Hmm, maybe I have two types.

In anticipation of your judgment incoming, I&#x27;d like to preface this list by saying I didn&#x27;t play nearly as many games as I should have this year (something echoed by other RPS staffers). My pile of shame is ever-growing, but here are a few games I did play and actually liked.

Each year the Sugar Plum Fairy has to collect more wishes to power the spells every year (you can help to make the spells more powerful by joining the RPS supporter program). While she&#x27;s out wish-hunting, here are some Christmas Crackers to distract you.
Time to enjoy your lovely joke!

In response, some users switched to third-party DNS providers, a hole that Canal+ now wants to plug. Through a lawsuit filed at a Paris court, the broadcaster hopes to compel Cloudflare, Google, and Cisco to implement similar DNS blocking measures.

Just as Final Fantasy VII Remake featured a predetermined endpoint – the escape from Midgar – Final Fantasy VII Rebirth players also know when their adventure will culminate in this game. The Forgotten Capital, the location that plays host to one of the most impactful moments in any video game, is the destination for the story contained within Final Fantasy VII Rebirth.

                              <span>At the end of every year, gamers are faced with an undeniable fact: far too many video games are released in a 12-month span for anyone to reasonably play them all. It&#x27;s literally my job to play video games and I bet someone could fill a reasonable top ten this year of titles I didn&#x27;t even get time to touch. But even as it&#x27;s a universal, undeniable truth, the revelation that you missed out on something popular is always met with the same incredulous statement.
“You&#x27;ve never played this?”
I understand the impulse. For instance, Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 took up so many hours of my 2023 that it&#x27;s hard to fathom what the year would be like without it. This sentiment extends well beyond GOTY talks, though – some games are so fundamental to our taste or upbringing that it can be hard to process that peop…</span>

                              <span>With the year almost behind us, it&#x27;s hard not to look back at 2023 with conflicted feelings. It was a fantastic year for gamers at home with great tentpole releases from PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo, and some excellent indies, too. For years to come, we will all likely argue that 2023 was one of the best – if not the best – year for games. But it was also a terrible year for the people who make games, with more than 10,000 developers laid off, studios closed, and more. 
Between big video game releases, a heartbreaking amount of layoffs, record-breaking acquisitions and box office reports, and more, 2023 contained plenty of news stories that had us talking for weeks, speculating on the future of the industry, and reshaping how we view game development.

                              <span>And thus, we arrive at the end of another year. A year filled with some very excellent games, and some very not excellent games. And through it all, the RPS guides team has been quietly toiling away, appeasing The Beast That Is Google with medium-rare slabs of SEO meat, and providing the answers to oft-asked gaming questions.
It&#x27;s important to me to have a moment in the year where we can step into the light for a little bit and celebrate everything the guides team has accomplished this year. Usually we stay well out of the spotlight, because people only like seeing guides if they&#x27;re actively searching for it. But today, we&#x27;re staging a coup. We&#x27;re taking centre stage, and threatening the lighting technician with all manner of disagreeable bodily experiences unless they keep the spotlight fixed firmly on us for the duration of this post.
2023 has been an amazing standout year for guides. Let&#x27;s take a look at the games that have defined the year for us, and celebrate some of the fantastic work our team has published.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve mentioned elsewhere that I played a lot of huge games this year, both literally referring to their size, and metaphorically referring to their brand name awareness (I had great intentions of doing a long-running Starfield diary, where I visited every planet I could until I got demoralised by the project, but unfortunately that turned out to be the length of one entry). I didn&#x27;t play quite as many small, odd things as I would have liked in 2023. I am very pleased with the shape of our Advent Calendar this year, though, especially the mid-table, which has some good weirdo entries and some surprises there.
So I thought I&#x27;d struggle to come up with three reminders for you for the Selection Box. And yet I didn&#x27;t! They&#x27;re also very on brand. Words and murder you say? Maybe in 2024 I should make a resolution to switch things up a bit. Gotta keep you guessing, dear readers...

Each year the Sugar Plum Fairy has to collect more wishes to power the spells every year (you can help to make the spells more powerful by joining the RPS supporter program). While she&#x27;s out wish-hunting, here are some Christmas Crackers to distract you.
Time to enjoy your lovely joke!

                              <span>A decade ago, nearly all screener copies of all Oscar-nominated films leaked online. Today, these types of screener leaks are non-existent. Changes in the movie industry contributed to this change but the bust of piracy group EVO a year ago had a big impact too. The group&#x27;s suspected leader was arrested in Portugal and others are still under investigation.

Today, six years later, Microsoft owns more than 50 studios, thanks to various acquisitions over the years.
Microsoft announced in January of 2022 that it was acquiring Call of Duty and Diablo maker Activision Blizzard for a colossal $68.7 billion, the largest video game acquisition ever. After nearly two years of Stateside court cases with the federal government, appeals and appeasements across the pond, unprecedented document leaks, direct arguments from rivals like PlayStation, and more, the deal is complete: Xbox is home to all 19 of Activision Blizzard’s studios (and King’s 11 mobile game development st…</span>

                              <span>More than six years after the original Persona 5 arrived on U.S. store shelves, the RPG is still spitting out successors and spin-offs that capitalize on how beloved that title is to this day. The 2020 update, Persona 5 Royal, is the best-received successor, but both 2021 Musou hybrid Persona 5 Strikers and the recently released turn-based strategy RPG Persona 5 Tactica gave players plenty to love.
Among the reasons players love those games are the new additions to the cast. Each of those aforementioned titles gives the core Phantom Thieves new characters with whom to interact. Royal gave us Kasumi and Maruki, Strikers gave us Sophia and Zenkichi, and most recently, Tactica gave us Erina and Toshiro.

                              <span>The quality of video game releases in 2023 has been discussed in detail by many, and it will absolutely go down as one of the best years the medium has experienced, strictly in terms of the excellent games that were released. The larger industry and its members will always look back on 2023 with justified frustration.
Patterns in any year are always a given. Trends inspire entire genres to be prevalent, and we also have events like 2009, where there were two high-profile open-world games about super-powered humans: Infamous and Prototype. This year will certainly be remembered for games like The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Baldur’s Gate 3, among others, but I can’t help but notice that RPGs citing a specific era of the genre were also, inexplicably, hugely popular.

                              <span>2024 is right around the corner, and what better way to kick it off than to get some complimentary games from your PlayStation Plus subscription? As announced in the PS Blog, this month&#x27;s selection of games is headlined by A Plague Tale: Requiem, Asobo Studio&#x27;s 2022 tale of sickness and siblings. While he thought it dragged on a bit in the second half, our reviewer said, &quot;Calling Requiem a standard sequel is a disservice; Asobo has created a Plague Tale epic.&quot; You can read that full review here and take a look at the other two offerings below.
The other two games are Evil West and Nobody Saves the World, each also released in 2022. Evil West is a third-person shooter set in a world that&#x27;s a fusion between a classic Wild West and gothic horror and one that reminded one of our editors of his time as a kid playing Darkwatch. Meanwhile, Nobody Saves the World is about a shapeshifting Nobody (yeah, that&#x27;s his name) on a quest to find the wizard who can stop a fungal infection from overtaking the world. Written by John Carson, the Game Informer review reads, &quot;Despite its minor shortcomings, Nobody Saves the World kept me enthralled from start to finish.&quot;D All three games will be available to download on January 2.
And as always, as the new comes in, the old must go; subscribers will have until January 1 to download the current crop of PS Plus games, which includes Lego 2K Drive, Powerwash Simulator, and Sable.

                              <span>Valve have put together their &quot;Best Of 2023&quot; lists on Steam. This is different from the Steam Awards, voting for which is ongoing, and instead is built from Steam data like revenue, peak concurrent players, and so on. It&#x27;s interesting every year as older games or indie obscurities do better than you expect.

                              <span>I keep an eye out for games I can use to introduce my young son to new genres. Cat Quest fit the bill last year. It&#x27;s a straightforward action RPG with cute, clean art about a cat slicing up a world of hedgehogs, foxes and, of course, dogs.

It&#x27;s currently free to keep from the Epic Games Store.

                              <span>This year&#x27;s Game Awards ceremony garnered a lot of justified criticism for the way it rushed winning developers off stage in favour of adverts, rambling conversations with Hideo Kojima, and celebrity cameos from the likes of Timothée Chalamet. 

Obsidian&#x27;s Josh Sawyer was right when he called it an &quot;embarrassing indictment of a segment of the industry desperate for validation via star power&quot;. Yet I still can&#x27;t help but also see the Game Awards as something else: a sign of progress. That&#x27;s because I remember the Spike Video Game Awards from 2007, which remains the nadir of both the games industry specifically and popular culture in general.

                              <span>Cor, there&#x27;s been a lot of games this year, haven&#x27;t there? While I&#x27;ve only slapped one Bestest Best badge down in 2023 (woe is me), our lovely freelancers, current RPSers, and former RPSers have done a whole lot more badge-slapping. A grand total of 26 Bestest Bests have graced our monitors this year, which makes it three more than last year&#x27;s Bestest Best round-up. And I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a nice mixture of big budget open worlders, puzzle gems, and indie delights that make up our roster for 2023, too.
So yeah, I&#x27;d encourage you to have a flick through the list below and see if there&#x27;s anything you can add to the wishlist. Even as the person with &quot;Reviews&quot; in their job title, I can confirm I literally have loads of these Bestest Bests in my backlog. I will endeavour to play a handful over this Christmas break on my Steam Deck, maybe combining the experience with a nibble on a mince pie. Anyway, enjoy! And Merry Reviewsmas!

                              <span>I didn&#x27;t have much time to play new games this year, honestly. Prior to joining the RPS Treehouse in late October, I spent much of the year organising a massive international move with my family from the US to the UK, which meant that many of 2023&#x27;s fresh releases - aside from the few that I&#x27;ve highlighted in this year&#x27;s advent calendar - remained in the unplayed depths of my Steam list. Now that it&#x27;s December and life has settled somewhat, I had to wrack my brain to come up with three entries for this Selection Box. After much deliberation, I realised that there were a few indie gems that I managed to crack open amidst all the chaos of arranging 60+ boxes for shipment across the Atlantic.

                              <span>Promise you won&#x27;t tell the other children, but the RPS staff are actually complex magical spells cast by the Sugar Plum Fairy, as part of an age old pact with the ents of the forest where the RPS treehouse was built hundreds of years ago. Each year the Sugar Plum Fairy has to collect more wishes to power the spells every year (you can help to make the spells more powerful by joining the RPS supporter program). While she&#x27;s out wish-hunting, here are some Christmas Crackers to distract you.
Time to enjoy your lovely joke!

By the end of his journey through Silent Hill, everything will be chaos – his mind and even the world around him, a violent cacophony of anguish.
But in the beginning, it’s silent. The kind of quiet that’s deafening, where you hear your pulse in your ears, and every tiny sound becomes the worst thing you can imagine.
Includes spoilers for Silent Hill 2
The opening hour of Silent Hill 2 is – without question – the scariest thing I have ever played. Which, taken at face value, might seem a bit ridiculous. Your goal is simply to navigate James through a dilapidated apartment building. At most, you’ll face 10 enemies throughout the building’s three floors, but they hardly pose a threat; they’re easily avoided or killed. Gameplay primarily consists…</span>

                              <span>Valve has released its annual &quot;Best Of&quot; list highlighting the top-performing games on Steam measured by gross revenue and player engagement.
The categories are top sellers, best-selling new releases, most-played games on PC, most-played games on Steam Deck, highest-grossing early access games, most-played using a controller, and best-selling VR titles. The top 12 games in each category earn Platinum status, while everything below them is grouped into a descending ranking of Gold, Silver, and Bronze. It&#x27;s a fun snapshot of the games Steam users dug into most this year and a reminder that games seemingly on the downtrend or long in the tooth (like, say, Destiny 2) clearly have a lot of players still logging in to play.

Back in 1997, Final Fantasy VII established Sephiroth as one of the most iconic antagonists in gaming history. In 2020, Final Fantasy VII Remake greatly expanded his role in the first act of the beloved RPG, and in 2024, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth hopes to give us even more context for the One-Winged Angel. We played a portion of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth and spoke with several members of the development team to learn how Sephiroth is depicted in the upcoming second act of the Remake trilogy.
While Sephiroth&#x27;s role in this middle portion of the original Final Fantasy VII is more understated, …</span>

When you think of pirates, history mainstays like Blackbeard might come to mind alongside the fictional Jack Sparrow. An important but often forgotten name, however, is Cheng Shih. Not only is Cheng Shih one of history&#x27;s most successful pirates, but she&#x27;s also the woman who took over her late husband Zheng Yi Sao&#x27;s pirate armada after his death, putting her in indirect control of 40,000-plus pirates for a nearly decade-long stint in Chinese waters in the early 19th Century. While Cheng Shih&#x27;s story can be found on pages of books and elsewhere, Singer Studios aims to bring her story to life in VR.

                              <span>Now that Tekken 8’s 32-character launch roster has been unveiled, Bandai Namco has been releasing gameplay trailers for the fighters that didn’t get one the first time around. It&#x27;s Kuma&#x27;s turn now, and the fighting bear is embearrassing challengers left and right.
Sporting a sweet headband and rugged gi, Kuma looks to be an unbearably challenging opponent. His furious paw swipes show he has no problem bearing arms, even against his perennial crush, Panda. In fact, she could bearly stand up to him! But don’t take my word for it. Bear witness to Kuma’s grizzly carnage by watching the trailer below. 


Tekken 8 launches on January 26 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. Check out our recent hands-on preview of the game&#x27;s story mode here.</span>

Sick of your family, sick of leftovers, wondering if the day after Boxing Day is still excuse enough to eat two dozen After Eights for dinner, your mind might start to slip towards the future. 2024! What all could you achieve with a whole twelve months stretched out before you? 

You could finally learn piano, you could re-commit yourself to bouldering, you could finally scratch out that novel. Or maybe you could just play a lot of video games. That&#x27;s no less noble a pursuit. So what is your video game resolution for 2024?

                              <span>It has once again fallen to me to pick out my favourite features, this time from 2023. This is a terrible task, because there are always a lot I like. I&#x27;ve tried to cut it down a bit from last year, for both our sakes, dear reader, and decided that previews don&#x27;t count (because as a format previews do a lot of the work for you, to be honest). Even reducing my task this way made it tough to whittle things down, and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ve missed some excellent articles and writers - and that I will be corrected in the comments!
Still, read on for a place to start if you want to look back at the year that was on RPS. We&#x27;ve got interviews, community nonsense, and even more interviews for you to enjoy here. I think in 2024 I&#x27;m going to advocate for more horseposting.

                              <span>This year, I&#x27;ve mostly played smaller games, mostly from small or solo developers. Playing a giant timesink game all day hasn&#x27;t appealed as I&#x27;ve sought to spend more time in forests and up hills and down rivers, and Destiny 2 burned me out so hard on live service games that I still can&#x27;t face those. But a year of little games has been great fun, short bursts of play and ideas explored concisely, so here are some of my other favourites.

                              <span>Promise you won&#x27;t tell the other children, but the RPS staff are actually complex magical spells cast by the Sugar Plum Fairy, as part of an age old pact with the ents of the forest where the RPS treehouse was built hundreds of years ago. Each year the Sugar Plum Fairy has to collect more wishes to power the spells every year (you can help to make the spells more powerful by joining the RPS supporter program). While she&#x27;s out wish-hunting, here are some Christmas Crackers to distract you.
Time to enjoy your lovely joke!

                              <span>WD&#x27;s SN850x NVMe SSD is an RPS mainstay, having been named the best PCIe 4.0 SSD in our evergreen gaming SSD recommendations, thanks to its extremely quick game loads and generally excellent performance. 
It&#x27;s also frequently discounted, but not normally to the extremes of today - where a 4TB drive is available for just $230 at Amazon US, versus the $286 it normally costs and the $449 (!) it cost at the start of the year.

The Legion Go retails for £700, but today you can pick one up with a screen protector for £648 from Lenovo direct. To get this price, you need to use the code UKIFLASHSALE at the checkout.

                              <span>In a year as stuffed with great games as this one, it was always inevitable that lots of very good ones would be left on the cutting room floor of our Advent Calendar this year. It&#x27;s also perhaps no surprise that in the big spreadsheet of games I&#x27;ve played this year, I&#x27;ve set yet another new record for things I&#x27;ve played to completion. At time of writing, my list stands at 58 games for 2023, and by the time you&#x27;re reading this in your post-Christmas lunch coma, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if it had risen further. 58! That&#x27;s more than one a week! Honestly, what was past Katharine thinking? No wonder I&#x27;m so chuffing tired right now.
In any case, my list of honourable mentions is so long this year I&#x27;ve taken the cheeky liberty of cramming some extra entries into my 2023 Selection Box, bringing you five more personal picks that I think are just smashing and that you should absolutely play when you get a spare moment or three.

Each year the Sugar Plum Fairy has to collect more wishes to power the spells every year (you can help to make the spells more powerful by joining the RPS supporter program). While she&#x27;s out wish-hunting, here are some Christmas Crackers to distract you.
Time to enjoy your lovely joke!

For over three years, Attila Kardos was one of the quality assurance testers at PlayStation Liverpool, one of the testing centers of Sony Interactive Entertainment Europe. During his tenure, he worked on first-party behemoths like God of War, Horizon: Zero Dawn, and Detroit: Become Human. But today, heʼs talking about a different type of testing involving a headset and physically mimicking movements for multiple hours at your office desk.
In games like Blood &amp; Truth, where you take a starring role in action movie-esque setpieces, the fun factor of virtual reality quickly makes itself apparent. However, experiences like this can be taxing. A player can stop at any time. A tester doesnʼt have that…</span>

                              <span>When Final Fantasy X exploded onto the PlayStation 2 in 2001, it revolutionized not just the Final Fantasy series but the role-playing genre as a whole. The tuned-to-perfection turn-based combat, the beautiful soundtrack, the heartfelt story, and the eye-popping-for-the-time visuals created one of the most important entries of one of the most important franchises in video game history. However, one element was absent from Final Fantasy X that several of the key developers involved with the project lamented: an explorable world map.
For Yoshinori Kitase, a producer on Final Fantasy VII Rebirth who also served as a director on Final Fantasy VI, VII, VIII, and X, the world map&#x27;s disappearance was a sore spot as someone who has been involved with the series since 1990. &quot;We started off expressi…</span>

Everyone knows that the days between your winter holiday and New Year&#x27;s Eve are for gaming, right? At least, we hope you&#x27;re doing some gaming today, tomorrow, and the day after! Or maybe you&#x27;re kicking back with a good book, or watching a new movie?


We don&#x27;t know what it is you&#x27;re doing but we want to! In fact, we want to know what video game presents you found under the tree or in a beautifully wrapped gift box this year, too.
Did you get a new console? Did you get some games to add to your never-ending backlog – we&#x27;re all still catching up on 2023&#x27;s frankly absurd gauntlet of releases, right? Did you get some cool shirts, some Fortnite V-bucks, or a new coffee cup with Clive from Final Fantasy XVI on it?
Whatever it is you got, we want to know so drop a line in the comments below! And if this year&#x27;s gifts weren&#x27;t video game-themed, tell us what your favorite gift was anyway! 
On behalf of everyone here at Game Informer, we hope the holidays are treating you well (and we hope you&#x27;re getting through that backlog for the sake of 2024&#x27;s release schedule).</span>

                              <span>A few weeks ago, I went to a Fortnite event where developer-publisher Epic Games unveiled its plan for the near future of its game: a Lego survival game, a racing game, and a music game à la Rock Band and Fuser. This is on top of the toolset allowing anyone to make and publish their own games within Fortnite.
The whole thing was kind of weird.
Not that any of the experiences are bad – the Lego thing is super not for me, but I really like the racing game (made by Psyonix, developer of Rocket League), and I think the music element has the potential to become something interesting down the road. 
I&#x27;m just not so sure Epic&#x27;s utopian vision of Fortnite as this everything app makes sense. I agree with the idea that Fortnite is a great social tool – but only in the way most online video games can…</span>

                              <span>Armored Core VI Fires of Rubicon hit PlayStation, Xbox, and PC back in August – read Game Informer&#x27;s review here – and if you&#x27;ve been looking for another reason to dip into its mech-action combat, look no further than the latest update for the game. Developer From Software released a new update last week that adds ranked online matchmaking, a ranked leaderboard, and more to the game. 
The update is free on all platforms where you can play Armored Core VI, and features new parts to enhance Armored Core loadouts as well as new PvP maps to face off against other players in and nameplate personalization. 
Check out the Armored Core VI ranked matchmaking update trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, this new update adds a heaping dose of mech action to Armored Core VI, giving players who have already beaten the game a new reason to jump into its multiplayer suite.

                              <span>Before the year concluded, discussions were already percolating about whether 2023 was the best year for video game releases ever. It was a challenging year for the industry as a whole, but in terms of artistic output, 2023 is absolutely a contender. Whittling the year&#x27;s releases to a mere 10 games was challenging, but we did it (you can read our top 10 right here).
However, the year&#x27;s game release calendar was so much more than just those 10 games. Below, you&#x27;ll see our winners for various categories, allowing us to celebrate a wide range of games, moments, characters, and elements from the extremely strong year for game releases.

                              <span>Team FOLON revealed Fallout: London, its DLC-sized mod for Fallout 4, back in 2021, and it captured the interest of players quickly. We got a 2023 release window alongside a new trailer back in 2022, but the mod needed more time, missing a release this year. Now, Team FOLON has revealed Fallout: London will be released in April, as reported by Eurogamer. 
More specifically, it will be available on April 23, 2024. The team announced this date in a new developer update released on December 23. In it, the team shows off more of the work it&#x27;s done since its last trailer, highlighting well-worn and lesser-known locales of London alongside enemies, weapons, and more. It ends with the April 23, 2024, release date announcement.
