                              <span>If you&#x27;ve been playing XDefiant since its May 21 release date, then there&#x27;s a decent chance you&#x27;ve encountered an unkillable enemy who looks like they aren&#x27;t even moving. While this may look like a hack, it&#x27;s actually a glitch —one the devs are aware of. 


This glitch has been noted on numerous occasions throughout the first week of release, with players posting videos of XDefiant characters floating across the ground, arms and legs welded to their sides, eating bullets, and killing enemies. 




There are other variations of this glitch too, as former Call of Duty pro player Scump discovered when he saw a player running around as normal but was unable to deal any damage to them. 




These definitely look like cheats we&#x27;ve seen in Warzone and CoD multiplayer in the past, but surprisingly, XDefiant developer and former Call of Duty World Champion Patrick &quot;ACHES&quot; Price confirmed that these are actually bugs affecting the game. 


The good news is that clearly the developer is aware of these problems, which should hopefully mean that Ubisoft will drop a fix soon. While we won&#x27;t explain the process here, the glitch is fairly easy to replicate, which is a big concern and could drive players away if it isn&#x27;t fixed quickly enough. 


At least the positive note is that the BattlEye anti-cheat system appears to be working, with hacking not a huge issue so far. With EngineOwning now paying $14m in damages to Activision, let&#x27;s hope that cheat providers have been scared away by the possible ramifications.

That&#x27;s why I&#x27;ve put together the best F1 24 controller settings to improve your handling and bring your lap times down. 


While some fans of the series use a racing wheel and pedals to race, not everyone has the time, space, or desire to set up a full sim-racing rig. That&#x27;s why many stick to using their controller, which can still provide good control over your car. 


While the basic setup for controllers is adequate, tinkering with the settings can make your car even faster, and an advantage over those who haven&#x27;t gone in-depth into the options. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;ve got all the controller settings that I use to get a leg-up on my online opponents.

If you&#x27;re like me and struggled to do it, here&#x27;s how to change the difficulty level in F1 24. 


Selecting the right difficulty in F1 24 is super important, and may take a little bit of tweaking to get right. Pick one too easy and you&#x27;ll be lapping five seconds faster than your rivals, driving at the front of the pack with no challengers near you. Too hard, and you&#x27;ll be watching the F1 drivers zoom off into the distance. 


When I first opened F1 24, the difficulty was set in the low 30s, which is way too low for me. When I went to settings on the main menu, however, I couldn&#x27;t find where to change it. After some fiddling arou…</span>

                              <span>As Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 leaks start to come thick and fast, rumors suggest that the Locus sniper rifle, Saug 9mm SMG, and Gobblegums could all be returning from previous Black Ops series entries. 


Call of Duty leaker Soup leaked images of bonuses that players get from pre-ordering the Black Ops 6 vault edition. In the first image, one of the rewards is what appears to be a collection of Gobblegums. And in the second picture, two of the weapons resemble the Saug 9mm from Black Ops 4, and the Locus from Black Ops 3 and 4. 




Gobblegums were a controversial feature in Black Ops 3 Zombies that gave players special abilities such as instantly teleporting to a random location or having zombies chase you instead of your teammates. The temporary consumables added an extra layer of strategy to the game mode, as teams could save up money and take a chance at the machine. 


Despite providing unique benefits, Gobblegum also drew criticism as the machine was expensive in Black Ops 3, and forced players to spend hours and in-game currency spinning in an effort to get the ability they wanted. This could be an issue in Black Ops 6, if they put the temporary power ups behind a pay wall and make players pull out their wallets if they want to use the fun abilities in Zombies. 


The weapon designs resemble the Locus and Saug 9mm, but it&#x27;s hard to tell for sure with the zombie-themed camos on them. Modern Warfare 3 has regularly added old weapons back such as the MORS, BAl-27, and Kar98k, so it wouldn&#x27;t be too much of a surprise to see classic Black Ops weapons return in the next title.

It even has weapon-specific mods that give it a more unique playstyle. Not to mention, it has an Incarnon Genesis adapter waiting to be used if you choose. But with that said, here’s how to get the Gorgon Wraith in Warframe.


How to get the Gorgon Wraith


To get the Gorgon Wraith, you must farm the Razorback Armada Assassination mission. Each successful run of the mission gives you a chance of giving you the Blueprint, Barrel, Receiver, and Stock.

Developer Badass Mongoose has today revealed a first look at Helix: Descent N Ascent — a gorgeous-looking puzzle adventure that will make its way to Switch in 2025.
This is a non-linear adventure that will see you exploring a long-forgotten world, unlocking skills and abilities along the way — including the power to remove and control your own head, it seems. Sounds a little Hollow Knight-y, no? Well, don&#x27;t expect that kind of intensity. It seems that Helix is all about the vibes, with &quot;non-violent gameplay&quot; putting the focus on puzzle-solving and storytelling as you try to work out what happened to the abandoned world.

After being incarcerated for six years for his involvement in one of America&#x27;s most infamous car heists, it seemed that Anthony Curcio had successfully turned his life around. He began speaking at middle schools, high schools, and universities regarding the importance of drug abuse prevention and how making positive choices can lead to a more fulfilled life. So wholesome, right?
Unfortunately, it seems like Curcio is up to his old tricks. According to a report from Fox 13 Seattle (thanks, Nintendo Wire), he and an accomplice, Iosif Bondarchuk, were recently arrested over their potential involvement in scamming up to $2 million from buyers of rare Pokémon and sports cards.

The boy can go anywhere, but is frequently blocked by environmental puzzles. The frog has the means to solve such puzzles, by hopping between shadows naturally cast by the environment. They act like little inky puddles, and simply jumping from one to the other is a rare joy.

Last week, players of the character action gacha asked for more freedom to skip story scenes and dialogue. Having sunk a bunch of hours into the game, I can see why. The combat may be swish and the traversal across its rolling landscape flowing and carefree, but the lore-obsessed babble of its characters is mind-numbing.

                              <span>Readers, I appear to have locked myself in self-referential language matrix trying to describe the feeling of playing top-down action shooter Kickback. You can only move through the recoil from shooting, you see, which means facing the opposite way to where you want to go. It’s both  very counterintuitive and very fun. To call something both counterintuitive and fun seems, well, counterintuitive. But also: fun. Which, as a concept is very fun to think about. But, also, quite counterintuitive. Writing such a incredibly redundant paragraph is quite fun, even though I’m just repeating myself. Counterintuitive, right? I’m going to try to escape this paragraph now. If I manage it, I’ll see you in the one below.

The FBI just carried out a new round of seizures affecting several of the site&#x27;s key domain names, including Z-Library.se. These efforts have also taken out the shadow library&#x27;s main email domain but, thus far, its servers appear to be unaffected.

We also chatted about our love of Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga and reminisced about the 2015 Mad Max game, kicking off a discussion about the future of movie tie-in titles.

Best Superi 46 loadout for MW3


Whether you play MW3 Multiplayer or Warzone, Superi 46 can thrive on almost any map. But if you want the best experience for Modern Warfare 3, equip these attachments:



Magazine: 40 Round Mag


Ammunition: 4.6MM Overpressured +P


Underbarrel: DR-6 Handstop


Rear Grip: Sakin ZX Grip


Stock: Rescue-9 Stock

Previously, the MORS was considered the best sniper rifle in Modern Warfare 3 and Warzone because of its incredible mobility, aim-down sight speed, and ability to one-shot kill from any range. However, the Kar98k boasts better characteristics across the board and has all the makings of being the new best weapon in both titles. Let&#x27;s jump right into everything you need to know.

In the Critical Countdown event, the key to unlocking rewards lies in obtaining DNA samples from fallen enemies in MW3 Multiplayer and Zombies. Loot caches in Warzone also hold these valuable samples, so it&#x27;s crucial to scavenge as much as possible. There are two types of DNA samples: Ade and Cyto. However, Operators must amass a specific quantity to unlock the following rewards in the MW3 and Warzone Critical Countdown event:

The free trial of Final Fantasy XIV is great when it comes to telling whether the game is worth purchasing, but it comes with limitations. While on the free trial, players cannot:

                              <span>The quote, &quot;the oldest and strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown,&quot; can be attributed to either H.P. Lovecraft or an evil cosmic entity posing as him. There&#x27;s truth to it, and one of the best ways for horror aficionados who no longer get a kick from cookie-cutter American horror movies to rekindle their love for the genre is by watching movies made in different countries.


These movies teach us that there are different techniques and approaches to filmmaking that will catch us off guard, and also that the language of horror is universal and will cross any frontier to get you.

                              <span>Covert Sneakers are widely considered the best Boots in Modern Warfare 3, so Sledgehammer Games responded in Season 4 by decreasing the volume of enemy footsteps to devalue using the perk. 


As part of the Season 4 update, all enemies have quieter footsteps. Since Covert Sneakers eliminates footstep audio, it&#x27;s rendered redundant, considering everyone makes less noise. This comes after Sledgehammer Games already attempted to overhaul the Boots category in Season 3 Reloaded. 


The developer removed Climbing Boots and introduced All-Terrain Boots, which offer significantly increased movement speed at the cost of tactical sprinting. In addition, Running Sneakers received a buff to improve sprint to fire time by 25 percent while tactical sprinting, and Stalker Boots were buffed to increase strafe speed and decreased the bounciness of aiming down sight. Those changes didn&#x27;t do enough to satisfy the development team.

&quot;Last season, we made several adjustments to Perks to distribute usage in the Boots category more evenly,&quot; Sledgehammer Games said. &quot;Despite these changes, the pick rate of Covert Sneakers remains far ahead of other Boots.&quot; 


After this Season 4 change and the buffs from a previous update, there are plenty of compelling options worth considering. Taking everything into consideration, the best Boots option is now Stalker Boots as they give you faster strafing and ADS speed. Running Sneakers are also a viable choice as they increase tactical sprinting duration and reduce the refresh time.


The indirect nerf to Covert Sneakers will also impact the Call of Duty League. Reports suggest that Major 4 will be played on the latest patch, meaning we could see pro players experiment with other perks. Either way, the next time you load into a match, don&#x27;t be afraid to try out a new Boots option.

                              <span>Players have yet to come around fully, but the MK 20 SSR is not only the best marksman rifle, but also one of the most powerful weapons in XDefiant. 


According to stats provided by TrueGameData, the MK 20 SSR has a faster time-to-kill speed up to 35 meters away than the ACR 6.8, AK-47, M16A4, and M60. You must consider that the MK 20 SSR is a single-shot rifle with only a 10-bullet magazine. However, if you are accurate with your aim, it&#x27;s possible to take down an enemy in two shots, or even one on an already weakened enemy. This marksman rifle requires a bit of a learning curve, as you will get punished with missed shots. 


Despite being a marksman rifle, the MK 20 SSR does not thrive in long-range engagements. A massive damage dropoff after 40 meters means you should prioritize shorte…</span>

Sony has retracted the entire interview, and if you try to pull it up, you’ll instead find a message that says:

The ongoing promo features special cards for the best footballers from Serie A. Some of these items are extremely strong on the in-game meta, but they can only be obtained from the packs (or from the market). While normal packs don&#x27;t guarantee a Team of the Season card, this special SBC reward will only feature items from the Serie A TOTS. 


What are EA FC 24 Serie A TOTS Upgrade SBC tasks?


The latest TOTS SBC has two separate tasks. Both of them have their own conditions. To earn the special pack, you&#x27;ll need to complete both tasks as per their stated conditions. 


Task 1 - 85-Rated Squad



Min. Team Rating: 85



Task 2 - 86-Rated Squad



Min. 1 Players: Any TOTS (Except UT Champions)


Min. Team Rating: 86

                              <span>Jianxin is one of Wuthering Wave&#x27;s most interesting characters for several reasons. If you&#x27;re interested in building her from the ground up, here&#x27;s a guide to inform you of everything you need to know about her.


Strongest Jianxin Build in Wuthering Waves


Jianxin is an Aero character who doesn&#x27;t have a clear-cut role like most characters do. Thanks to her incredibly versatile kit, Jianxin can play any role in any given team comp, most of which can be done with one set of gear. You&#x27;ll still want to build her with a focus on DPS though, as she is capable of putting out a considerable amount while playing any given role. 


If you read any of the descriptions of her abilities, Jianxin looks like one of the most complicated characters in the whole game. However, she is relatively simple to …</span>

                              <span>The Sofia Huerta TOTS SBC is the latest special challenge in EA FC 24 Ultimate Team. It&#x27;s another with lower requirements and a single, easy task. 


For tonight&#x27;s content, EA Sports has decided to release a TOTS item from the NWSL. She can be a great fit with other items like Alex Morgan and Sophia Smith, who are available in different packs. To get this card, you&#x27;ll have to complete Huerta&#x27;s SBC before it expires from Ultimate Team. 


What are the EA FC 24 Sofia Huerta TOTS SBC tasks?


The latest TOTS SBC is extremely easy to complete, as it has only one task. The solo task does have certain conditions, but this is a perfect challenge to complete for beginners. 


Task 1 - Sofia Huerta



Min. 1 Players: Any TOTS or TOTW


Min. Team Rating: 83



You&#x27;ll need to use at least one TOTS or TOTW item, and my suggestion will be to use the latter. The 83+ TOTW Pick SBC allows players to craft as many items as they want in exchange for lower-rated fodder. TOTS items have higher ratings, and are far more expensive to get. It&#x27;s best to save them for SBCs that require higher-rated squads.

EA FC 24 Sofia Huerta TOTS SBC Cheapest Solutions


While there&#x27;s just one task, always go for the cheapest solution. This will help you to preserve in-game resources, or use them in other content like the Henrikh Mkhitaryan TOTS SBC. 


Task 1 - Sofia Huerta



Melvine Malard 82


Jadon Sancho 82


Leah Galton 83


Alana Cook 82


Klara Buhl 83


Mathilde Bourdieu 83


Joao Palhinha 83


Sophie Schmidt 83


Gaetan Laborde 82


Jorginho 83


Nicolas Otamendi TOTW 84



The Sofia Huerta TOTS SBC certainly offers a lot of value in EA FC 24, and the 92-rated RB item can play in several positions. It also has the Whipped Cross+ and Intercept+ playstyles, along with H/H work-rates. This item, in many ways, is a cheap beast like last evening&#x27;s Albert Gudmundsson Serie A TOTS card.

                              <span>It&#x27;s finally here. After three weeks, Destiny 2 players can finish crafting the reprised Outbreak Perfected. Outbreak Refined III is a short chain of missions with the most difficult part being locating two switches in the labryinthe Zero Hour mission and completing the run within 20 minutes. Here&#x27;s how to beat it with no wasted time searching.


Where to find the final pair of switches in Destiny 2 Zero Hour


Just like the previous two quests in this chain, you&#x27;ll need to speak with Ada-1 in the Tower&#x27;s Annex to acquire the Outbreak Refined III quest. Should you be skipping ahead or planning on rushing through them before The Final Shape is released, here are the other two guides.



Outbreak Refined I


Outbreak Refined II



The first step in Outbreak Refined III requires defeating Fallen in The Devils&#x27; Lair strike to collect Inert SIVA Clusters. This can be launched by selecting it from the Cosmodrome map in the Director. I had this complete by the time my fireteam reached Sepiks Prime, so you shouldn&#x27;t have to worry about multiple runs.

As for the switches themselves, they&#x27;re on the wall section. Instead of jumping left like you normally would, go right to find the first switch. From there, head left as you normally would. Once you reach the final drain, there will be a series of small pipes with grates on them, stacked three high. Jump all the way to the top for the second switch.


From there, it&#x27;s just a matter of completing Zero Hour on Legend. Since this final pair of switches isn&#x27;t out of the way, your fireteam shouldn&#x27;t have too much difficulty hitting them and then taking down the boss.

                              <span>Of the five SMGs currently in XDefiant, the MP5A2 is the least exciting on paper when you look underneath the hood and stack it against other options. However, something must be said about a well-balanced weapon that is easy to use. 


Time-to-kill speed is not a strength of the MP5A2. According to TrueGameData, the Vector, MP7, and P90 kill faster than the MP5A2 from most ranges, and it&#x27;s not particularly close in short-range engagements. Thankfully, a class-leading ADS time and impressive sprint-to-fire time make up for that shortcoming. In addition, the versatile SMG performs better than other weapons in the class in longer-ranged gun fights thanks to an incredibly easy-to-control recoil pattern.

Farming for this resource is helpful if you want to rack up some items, especially after you finish a specific quest line.


Where to find Lampylumen Ore in Wuthering Waves


Lampylumen Ore spawns almost exclusively around Tiger&#x27;s Maw, the region directly south of Jinzhou. While you&#x27;ll occasionally spot this resource in other areas, Tiger&#x27;s Maw is your best bet for farming this material, as it spawns in abundance around the facility and the surrounding landscape.

How to evolve Skull Warrior into Skull Paladin


You can evolve your Skull Warrior unit into a Skull Paladin by using a Skull Mask. Once you have crafted the Skull Mask item, simply combine it with your Skull Warrior unit to evolve it into the Skull Paladin. The Skull Paladin is a more powerful evolution of the Skull Warrior, and is also a Mythical rarity unit. You can evolve the Skull Warrior by visiting the Evolving circle inside of the Summon shop in the main hub.


The Skull Paladin is a Gound type unit that starts with full AoE capability and upgrades to have added Circle and Line attacks. Here are all the stats for a Skull Paladin:

The defendants, all linked to Germany-based EngineOwning UG, initially put up a spirited defense against alleged violations of the DMCA, Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and civil RICO, among others. By last summer, all defendants had disengaged from the legal process. At the time of writing, EngineOwning is selling its latest MWIII and Warzone cheat.

Last December, CCTV footage revealed a figure in black spray-painting the words &quot;free movie&quot; time and again.

                              <span>It’s been a little while since we last heard about the untitled open-world driving game from Maverick Games, the studio opened a couple of years back by ex-Playground Games veterans including former Forza Horizon 5 creative director Mike Brown. We still don’t know what the team’s new game is called or when it might hit the road, but we have been given a few more snippets of what to expect and news on who’ll be helping pump up its tires and fill it with fuel as publisher.

Each harvest, one villager must don the ceremonial, mildly magical mask, and enter the fields alone, to gather the precious life-giving ambrosia before the beast can befoul it. For five nights you must do battle, or evade its ravenous clutches.
Those of you who have known your own Devourer are surely thinking: Only five nights per year? Luxury. Harvest Hunt is good, though.

                              <span>Many moons ago, premiere wordsman Nate Crowley reviewed shark ‘em up Maneater, decrying its incurious perpetuation of anti-shark propaganda, and calling it “an ecstatically violent simulation of being a fool&#x27;s idea of a shark.” My own frothing penchant for the plan-schemes of Warhammer’s Skaven ratboys has been documented in these pages to the point of rabidity, but I do feel broadly similarly about media that sullies rats - clean, smart and good folk that they are. Lively tactics Trash Of The Titans does not aim to emancipate its villainous vermin. But, like Warhammer, it gets a pass for its evident affection towards its antagonistic dumpster diving scuttlers. Also, it&#x27;s just plain fun.

                              <span>A producer on Kerbal Space Program 2 has confirmed that those working on the space flight sim are being laid off en masse. We already knew that the developers at Intercept Games would be losing their jobs thanks to a closure announcement from Washington State. Until remarks from Strauss Zelnick, the CEO of Take-Two Interactive, muddied the waters. Zelnick refused to acknowledge that the studio was being closed when asked by a reporter, even going so far as to claim the opposite. &quot;We didn&#x27;t shutter those studios,&quot; he told IGN. But it seems clear from one producer&#x27;s testimony that Zelnick&#x27;s remarks are inaccurate.

                              <span>Mortal Kombat 1’s next superpowered guest fighter, The Boys’ Homelander, shows off his dominance in a new gameplay trailer. The less-than-heroic superhero becomes available for Kombat Pack owners on June 4 and for everyone else on June 11.
The patriotic and maniacal leader of The Seven shows no quarter to his new MK adversaries, obliterating them with an offensive style that is very reminiscent of Superman’s playstyle in the Injustice series. The trailer also shows off the new DLC Kameo fighter Ferra, the smaller, more feral half of the Ferra &amp; Torr team from Mortal Kombat X, who also joins the game sometime in June. 


Homelander joins Peacemaker, Invincible’s Omni-Man, Ermac, Quan-Chi, and the upcoming Takeda in the Year 1 DLC roster. Mortal Kombat 1 also has a story expansion on the way, but there’s still no word on what that will entail or when it will arrive.

XDefiant’s core modes offer temporarily fun stabs at the competitive multiplayer arena shooter, but Ubisoft’s latest attempt at carving out a slice of the lucrative esports pie feels half-baked. Core modes like its practice mode and ranked queue are gated off by construction tape at the time of writing. This leaves a bland battle pass with head-scratching progression decisions and standard weapon-based leveling systems as the only tangible means of rewarding you for playing the game or doing well beyond an individual match. And …</span>

                              <span>Hive Jump 2: Survivors arrives in Steam Early Access today. To celebrate, publisher Midwest Games and developer Graphite Lab have shared an exclusive trailer for the Survivors-like sequel. The first Hive Jump caught our eye way back in 2015 when we named it one of the most promising indie titles on display at PAX West that year before its launch in 2017. The original Hive Jump served as a four-player co-op homage to Super Metroid, but Hive Jump 2: Survivors takes inspiration from a different title: Vampire Survivors.
The genre, called &quot;bullet heaven,&quot; puts players in the shoes of a single character who eventually builds up to become extremely powerful as the waves of enemies grow more intense. Hive Jump 2: Survivors carries forward the look of its Metroidvania predecessor but from the genre-standard top-down perspective. You take control of a lone survivor of an alien attack who must now face seemingly insurmountable odds to survive. You can customize your loadout and upgrade your jetpack to destroy enemies and escape tough situations.
The jetpack also allows you to traverse the levels in ways not available in Vampire Survivors. The Jumpers have specific builds that allow you to cater to your play style, which combines with the upgrades you select before each run. You can play with auto-assist aiming or switch to manual controls. If you can survive 14 rounds, you can challenge big boss battles. As you collect goo from fallen enemies, you can earn better weapons, upgrades, and relics to improve your odds. Meanwhile, amber you find in the field can be traded for permanent upgrades to stats, magnets for auto-scavenging, or even screen-wiping nukes.
You can see an exclusive look at the Early Access launch trailer below.

Sony has no additional details, but Some PlayStation Studios developers we have not heard from in awhile include Asobi (Astro&#x27;s Playroom), Bend Studio (Days Gone), Bluepoint (Demon&#x27;s Souls remake) , Guerrilla (Horizon Zero Dawn), Housemarque (Returnal), Insomniac Games (Spider-Man), Naughty Dog (The Last of Us), Santa Monica Studio (God of War), and Sucker Punch (Ghost of Tsushima). There are more, but those are arguably the developers gamers would be most excited to receive updates from.
At the very, very least, I am hoping for an Astro Bot: Rescue Mission PlayStation VR2 port.</span>

With an art direction and gameplay heavily inspired by A Link to the Past, this fun homage is now available in Steam Early Access and gives players the tools to craft dungeons as clever or devious as they desire. Best of all, you can upload creations for other players to enjoy and experience the works of the community. Editors Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard do just that, exploring Marcus&#x27; custom dungeon to show off some of the game&#x27;s toolset before playing a (far superior) community creation.

Last month, Bandai Namco unveiled a first look at That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime ISEKAI Chronicles, an upcoming RPG based on the popular anime series. The game isn&#x27;t set to come our way until 8th August, but to keep us going until then, the publisher has revealed the opening movie in all its animated glory.
If you were wondering how closely the game will stick to its anime source material, we&#x27;d wager that this opening movie will give you a hint. Fans of the anime will see more than a few familiar faces here, but the game promises new storylines and characters from author Fuse so there will still be a few surprises along the way.

To celebrate the 10th anniversary of Mario Kart 8, George recently enlisted a troupe of willing racers (at least that&#x27;s what he told us) to tackle every single track in the upgraded, DLC-laden Deluxe version in a local four-player blowout to end them all.
What follows is a twisting tale of glory and grief, friendship and failure — a fittingly epic Mario Kart marathon to commemorate a decade of both Wii U and Switch&#x27;s best-selling game.

Hello Games is preparing to launch the third large No Man&#x27;s Sky update of the year, &#x27;Adrift&#x27;. While previous patches have all been about adding more, this one strips things back.
In &#x27;Adrift,&#x27; the universe has been abandoned. There are no other lifeforms — say goodbye to shopping, trading and shortcuts — and only echoes of a long-gone civilisation remain. Oh, and we should also mention that Sandworm numbers have increased, so be careful when taking a stroll across desert planets.

                              <span>A nest of Namco nonograms.
It’s been rough out there for poor Picross fans during this generation, as they’ve been cruelly starved for content with only 23 game releases on Switch (if you count the &#x27;e&#x27; series) that offer up a paltry sum of over 5,000 puzzles to solve. Those puzzles aren’t even all original either—if you really want to be pedantic, the Mega Picross puzzles are usually repeats.
But it’s all going to be okay now. After the success of a Sega-themed Picross S Genesis &amp; Master System Edition release a few years ago, Jupiter has now committed to another crossover, this time borrowing from Namco’s extensive arcade history with Picross S Namco Legendary Edition. What does this mean for you? Well, it’s another few hundred puzzles to complete, but this time some of them might have Pac-Man characters.

Celeste composer and game developer Lena Raine has revealed her latest project ANOTHEREAL, a shmup RPG that combines exploration, puzzle-solving, and tense combat encounters.
Though a Switch release has not been confirmed at the time of writing, we remain hopeful that the eventual Steam release will pave the way for more platform launches (and maybe our enthusiasm will give publisher Radical Dreamland a bit of a nudge!). Similarly, a release date has not yet been set, so we could be in for a bit of a wait.

When Paper Mario: The Origami King was released on the Switch, news began to circulate about the development team no longer being able to &quot;modify&quot; characters in the series. Now that the GameCube title Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door has officially returned, it seems Nintendo could be reconsidering its stance.
As highlighted by Nintenduo, a new player survey doing the rounds in select regions is reportedly asking Paper Mario fans about unique character designs in the series.

                              <span>Kubernetes je spíše spjat s provozem aplikací, které nevyžadují úložiště, tzv. stateless. Jejich provoz je jednodušší, snáze se škálují a obecně rychleji startují. Nicméně, občas je úložiště potřeba a přesně o tom bude další Cloud Native Prague meetup s tématem zvaným Stateful Kubernetes.</span>

AlmaLinux 8.10 tak víceméně dělá pro systémové správce strojů s těmito řadiči zhruba totéž, co AlmaLinux 9.4 oproti RHELu 9.4, navíc s tím bonusem, že se mohou nadále držet „osmičkové“ řady.

In anticipation of Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance&#x27;s release, Atlus has teamed up with heavy metal band Slipknot in one of the most unusual and ingenious collaborations we&#x27;ve ever seen.
In a new promotional video, make-up and creature FX artist Jim Ojala — who has been creating and working on masks for Slipknot for over five years — shows us the extremely detailed process of creating masks. The difference is, rather than making masks for the Iowa band, he&#x27;s making masks based on demons you&#x27;ll get to meet in SMTV: Vengeance.

Soapbox features enable our individual writers and contributors to voice their opinions on hot topics and random stuff they&#x27;ve been chewing over. And with Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake — or whatever it&#x27;s meant to be now — finally re-emerging after three years, Alana&#x27;s here to make a case as to why this is the RPG remake we need right now.

Square Enix&#x27;s back catalogue is full to bursting. Think of a classic RPG from the &#x27;90s that you&#x27;d love to see on a modern system — ported, remastered, remade, you know it — and there&#x27;s a good chance Square, Enix, or Chunsoft made it.

Team 17 and Catchweight Studio have revealed Conscript, a new survival horror set in World War 1 (or The Great War), heading to the Switch later this year.
No specific release date has been set at the time of writing, but if you want a taste of the action, a Steam demo will be made available from 10th June 2024. Judging from the trailer, however, it looks like the title takes a bit of inspiration from the critically acclaimed Signalis, which hit the Switch back in 2022.

Thanks to the release of Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door on Switch, we have been quickly reminded of just how much we love the hand-crafted aesthetic. The paper sprites, the craft backdrops, the theatre battle setting — it&#x27;s all just wonderful, isn&#x27;t it?
We&#x27;re hardly alone in this opinion, of course, but YouTuber and crafting wizard JoPro has taken the admiration a step further, recreating the iconic boss battle against Hooktail the dragon in eye-popping stop-motion. And in case you hadn&#x27;t guessed it, it looks awesome.

                              <span>I have played many a creepy throwback game that takes inspiration from the ever inadequately named &quot;Golden&quot; (Grimy and Diseased? Cadaverous, perhaps) Age of survival horror on PS1, but it&#x27;s rare you play one that invokes the N64, and even less often that you stumble on something horror-adjacent that riffs on Star Fox 64. Ah, Star Fox! The natural companion piece for, say, Eternal Darkness or The Suffering. In fairness, I did always find those Pez dispenser dialogue animations pretty eerie.

                              <span>To kick off with some extremely half-arsed mytho-geometry, the original Frostpunk was a testament to both the design utility and the inexhaustible political symbolism of circles. When people wish to found a community of equals they commonly form a circle, with each participant visible and audible to the rest. A circle is also the best shape for defending against an engulfing ambient threat such as a global ice age, because it has no weak points, and it makes a great centrepiece for a videogame interface, a symmetrical motif that can be tuned and adorned to either suck your attention into the screen or distribute it evenly in all directions.
Created by Polish developers 11 bit, Frostpunk takes place in the middle of a circle, an Arctic crater with a huge coal generator at its heart. Your city rises in rings around that generator, each additional layer of dwellings corresponding intuitively to decreasing temperature, and the result is one of the most focused and thematically consistent specimens of its genre - a building game that feels as intimate and urgent as tending a campfire. Frostpunk 2&#x27;s new campaign mode breaks the circle open. It starts where you (hopefully) ended, with the crater now fully colonised and evolved into a glaring, blue-orange geode of high-density housing and clustered chimneys. But the view has been pulled back, and construction now unfolds along the plains and canyons beyond the crater, which consist not of circles but of hexagons - another UI designer&#x27;s favourite - on which you&#x27;ll plot out upgradeable districts rather than assembling individual buildings.

                              <span>The first scene in RPS Game Club pick Deathbulge: Battle Of The Bands - a genuinely funny and innovative riff on turn-based RPGs -  sees candyfloss n’ superglue-haired guitarist Faye frantically search for her missing guitar as the crowd for the titular battle grow impatient. You’ll quickly realise this a school-with-no-trousers-esque dream sequence, but the matted mess of thick black cables that carpet this dingy side-stage is painfully accurate. Pissing around with gear is roughly 70% of the band experience, in my limited experience of being in bands. This probably changes when you’ve got roadies or dedicated tech people, but we did not, because we were skint. And also terrible. Several hours of Deathbulge has brought me more joy than several years of being in actual bands. I had some isolated good times in some of those bands, but I’m having a very good time with Deathbulge.

                              <span>A whopping 1000 corpses have been found in our ongoing investigation into Anthology of the Killer, Rock Paper Shotgun can reveal. The bodies were discovered in the aforementioned murder mystery &quot;video game&quot;, which is out now on itch.io. Following our previous reports we can confirm that exposure to the game&#x27;s crime-infested city can cause severe disorientation, confusion, uncontrolled fits of laughter, and moderate enlightenment. The streets here are so dense with crime that entire apartment blocks must shutter at night. When Rock Paper Shotgun reported the 1000 corpses to detectives, we were told this was &quot;normal&quot; and &quot;appropriate&quot;.

                              <span>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will be the first Call Of Duty to launch on Microsoft Game Pass, according to a notification that went out this morning via the Xbox Game Pass app for iPhone and Android. &quot;Just announced: Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is coming to Game Pass on day one later this year!&quot; it reads. Sounds like a solid confirmation from me, though Microsoft and Activision have yet to start bellowing the news from any of Call of Duty’s official pulpits.

The studio&#x27;s follow-up Zenless Zone Zero is now set to release on July 4th. For anyone who hasn&#x27;t yet heard of the bright cyberpunk character action game, I guess now&#x27;s your chance to look at the slick anime visuals in the new trailer below and go &quot;hmmm&quot;, with either a songful note of eye-widening interest or the suspicious rumble of a free-to-play skeptic.

The claim was casually corroborated by trustworthy sort Andy Robinson of VGC. Note the wording here, which suggests a bundle package of sorts, similar to the rumoured original plan for the remakes of Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil 3.

Sometimes, it&#x27;s because those people have succeeded in levelling up out of games journalism, or found their way into another echelon of the craft. Other times, the losses are more abrupt and arbitrary. In each case, one short term response is intensification. Those of us who remain must be rockier, paperier and more shotgun than ever before. With that in mind, here are this (four-day) week&#x27;s new PC games of note.

It’s only a matter of time before IllFonic perfects the asymmetrical multiplayer experience. Say what you will about its previous games; each one offered entertaining tweaks to the formula, small yet clever innovations, and a seemingly better understanding of what makes this genre so compelling. Killer Klowns From Outer Space: The Game embodies all these aspects, making it one of IllFonic’s best asymmetric games yet.
Killer Klowns From Outer Space: The Game offers a familiar gameplay loop for the genre. Seven human players must quick…</span>

                              <span>Tekken 8’s second DLC fighter, Lidia Sobieska, returns to action in her first gameplay trailer. The Polish politician and karate master will bolster the roster this summer.
First introduced as a DLC fighter in Tekken 7: Fated Retribution, Lidia is the prime minister of Poland and a practitioner of traditional karate. The formal and proud fighter clashes with fellow karate practisioner Jin Kazama in the trailer and humbles the arrogant Reina by dishing out her new Rage Art. 


Lidia follows on the heels of Eddy Gordo as the two revealed Year 1 season pass fighters. Owners of Tekken 8’s Deluxe, Ultimate, or Collector&#x27;s Editions automatically receive these fighters. Each can also be purchased individually for $7.99. Two more fighters remain in the Year 1 pass, who will be added during the fall and winter

                              <span>One of the biggest reasons Xbox acquired Activision Blizzard was for the Call of Duty series, a first-person shooter that has dominated the best-selling games list for decades. This would make it the perfect candidate to launch on Xbox Game Pass, Microsoft&#x27;s gaming subscription service, in order to bring new subscribers in. Black Ops 6 was officially revealed last week, and while it was reported to be in consideration for a Game Pass launch, today, the news was confirmed from Xbox itself. Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will launch on Game Pass day one.
We don&#x27;t know much about the game yet, but two live-action teasers have been released so far. The first features a group of people covering the faces of Mount Rushmore with blindfolds that say, &quot;The truth lies.&quot; The second, released today, can be seen below.


It features world leaders&#x27; black and white camera footage speaking in hushed tones about a grand conspiracy about manufactured wars and the elusive nature of the truth. The trailer ends with the game&#x27;s full title, along with a reminder that the full reveal will come on June 9, after Xbox&#x27;s summer showcase.

                              <span>Lego has pulled the curtain back on its new playset based on The Legend of Zelda. The 2-in-1 aims to satisfy both old-school and new-school fans and is set to go on sale in January.
The 2,500-piece set lets owners build two scenes modeled after the Great Deku Tree from Ocarina of Time and Breath of the Wild. In terms of characters, it includes both games&#x27; versions of Link, BOTW Zelda, and the maraca-shaking Hestu. Smaller details include the cooking pot, a Skulltula, treasure chests, and a Korok tucked away on the treetop.

The Great Deku Tree 2-in-1 costs $299.99 and can be pre-ordered now on Lego&#x27;s website. It will arrive in stores on January 9, 2025. It joins other sets based on Nintendo properties such as Animal Crossing, Donkey Kong, and Mario.</span>

                              <span>Konami revealed it is holding another Silent Hill Transmission event on May 30 at 4 P.M. PDT. The last Silent Hill Transmission happened in 2022 and revealed a surprising amount of Silent Hill news including the reveal of the remake of Silent Hill 2, Silent Hill f, a new Silent Hill movie, and more.
The post announcing the event reads, &quot;Consider this your invitation letter to Silent Hill. ✉️ Tune in May 30 at 4 p.m. PDT to our SILENT HILL YouTube channel for the second installment of the #SILENTHILL Transmission where we&#x27;ll share game updates, a deeper look at the film, and new merch.&quot;
The safe bet is a teaser trailer for the movie and hopefully new details about the Silent Hill 2 remake and Silent Hill f, the latter of which seems like the franchise&#x27;s next big original entry. Silent Hill Ascension, the online mobile narrative game where players dictated the story choices, also finished up its first season (though the developer may have a different term for it), so it&#x27;s possible we may learn what&#x27;s next for that game.</span>

If you haven’t seen the trailer for Kingmakers, I encourage you to watch it now before continuing. If you have, or perhaps you are reading this magazine in an effort to limit screen time (you’re doing great, and we appreciate your support), I can’t continue to talk about the game without spoiling its major twist. The trailer teases what appears to be a medieval strategy game with base-building elements before a contemporary, but admittedly junky truck screams through time to arrive in the middle of a battlefield brimming with horses, suits of armor, and presumably the shouting of old English phrases, but it’s difficult to hear through the chaos.

                              <span>In 2009, a video game called Canabalt was published on the iOS App Store. It had a simple premise: Your character flees through a crumbling urban landscape, making great leaps across rooftops at the touch of your phone screen. It met great success and charted in what was then only a burgeoning mobile game ecosystem. Canabalt popularized the infinite runner genre and would ultimately put its designer, Adam Saltsman, on the map.
Now working under the name of Finji as its creative director, Adam’s rise as a designer as well as his partner’s, Bekah Saltsman, as both a publisher and CEO, has been stunning to watch, especially considering the simplicity of that first big hit. Whether you’re playing the bass guitar as Mae Borowski in Night In The Woods, organizing patchwork-colored boxes in Wilmo…</span>

But shirts like this used to be made by humans. While making coffee, I ask Siri on my iPhone what the weather will be like today and what my day’s schedule looks like, and a few seconds later, an artificial intelligence-powered voice gives me the answers I’m looking for. After sitting down at my work computer to write this, I opened Spotify and checked out my Discover Weekly playlist, hyper-curated to my tastes based on the other music I’ve listened to over the past week.
On Instagram, my ads feel uncannily targeted to me, and on X (formerly Twitter), I see a new batch of posters for Amazon’s upcoming Fallout streaming series called out for using A.I. N…</span>

                              <span>The final character of Street Fighter 6&#x27;s Year 1 DLC plans, Akuma, finally hit the game earlier this week. I had the chance to catch up with director Takayuki Nakayama about the importance of the Great Demon. However, in February, I sat down with Nakayama and producer Shuhei Matsumoto to discuss the addition of Ed to Street Fighter 6. During that conversation, Nakayama shared an intriguing anecdote about how important Ed was to the development of Street Fighter 6.
When the team sits down to decide on the characters, they think of balancing out the roster not only in style, but through the regions and countries the characters represent. However, the story of the game –in Street Fighter 6&#x27;s case, World Tour – also plays a big role.

                              <span>Adam Douglas has a ghastly secret. He shared the recipe for a Cuban dish – the Arroz con Pollo – in an in-game radio station in Oxenfree II: Lost Signals, and it’s one that he describes as “very controversial.” The trick, according to Douglas, a senior writer at Night School Studio, is to use boneless, skinless chicken thighs for the dish instead of bone-in, skin-on thighs and drumsticks.
“My family’s from Cuba,” says Douglas. “It was my mom’s recipe that I have transformed into my recipe. And so, the version in the game is my version, which in the Cuban community is a very controversial version, and I stand by it. I still haven’t told my mom about any of this, by the way. I’m genuinely afraid of telling her this.”

The 2018 release of Frostpunk delivered a unique twist on the city-builder genre, putting you in control of a band of humans trying to survive the new ice age. Players assumed the role of The Captain as they built up their small colony of workers to a flourishing city in the post-apocalypse. Along the way, players needed to make hard decisions, like restricting food, enforcing strict authoritarian laws, putting children to work, or worse. Frostpunk 2 picks up the story 30 years later and, in the process, looks to impr…</span>

However, NVIDIA denies all copyright infringement allegations and also rejects the use of the term &quot;shadow library&quot;, which is often used for pirated book repositories.

It would be another nine years before Expend4bles shook things up with a new title format but little else had changed. Expendables movies come with a three-point guarantee: lots of explosions, a solid 6/10 aggregate score on the Internet Movie Database, and thousands of people being monitored on BitTorrent so they can be sued at a later date. Almost 3,000 now face action in Canada&#x27;s Federal Court.

                              <span>It’s been three years to the day since we learned that Square Enix planned to remake Dragon Quest 3, unveiling a revamping of the seminal 1988 JRPG in Octopath Traveler’s HD-2D engine.

According to a new report, it’s subtitled The Dark Ages and we’ll get an official reveal next week.

While Swen Vincke admitted that “it would be a lie to say that we didn&#x27;t [crunch]”, he insisted that it was less than on past Larian games such as Divinity, staff were paid for the overtime and it seemingly didn’t go as far as working late nights or weekends (for the most part, anyway).

                              <span>A Seattle jury has issued a landmark verdict following the legal battle between &#x27;Destiny 2&#x27; creator Bungie and cheat seller AimJunkies. The &#x27;cheat&#x27; company and its three owners are liable for copyright infringement and must pay damages to Bungie. The same applies to an independent cheat developer whose counterclaim, alleging that Bungie &#x27;hacked&#x27; his computer, was denied.

But don&#x27;t fight back, it&#x27;s time to team up.

                              <span>Senua&#x27;s Saga: Hellblade II is out this week, but the starting line for developer Ninja Theory&#x27;s foray into the world of action games with a focus on performance capture began with Heavenly Sword. Released in 2007 for the PlayStation 3, the game featured Andy Serkis just a few years removed from his work on the Lord of the Rings films, and is a weird action game that has incredible moments of action that doesn&#x27;t last quite as long as you&#x27;d like. It&#x27;s a special game to me, however, and one I am always happy to revisit. I am pessimistic, but I would love to play a version of the game at 60 FPS.

The Infringing Website List (IWL) isn&#x27;t made public but since there was no celebration of its recent 10-year anniversary, here&#x27;s what the decade-old list has been getting up to lately.

The Taskmasters themselves, Greg Davies and Alex Horne, will be represented in-game, and Horne, who created the concept of the show and is technically its sole writer (see below) was available to chat about it. We learned about the upcoming VR game (releasing June 13 on Quest), why the American Comedy Central version of the show didn&#x27;t work, whether or not it is time to give an American version another shot, and what it is like to meet yourself in VR. So without further ado... it&#x27;s little Alex Horne!

                              <span>HBO and PlayStation have found their Isaac for The Last of Us Season 2, and it&#x27;s Jeffrey Wright, the actor behind the voice of Isaac in The Last of Us Part II. Perhaps best known for roles like The Watcher in Marvel&#x27;s What If...?, Commissioner Gordon in The Batman, and Bernard in HBO&#x27;s Westworld series, as well as his role as Thelonious &quot;Monk&quot; Ellison in 2023&#x27;s American Fiction, which earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor, Wright will return to Naughty Dog&#x27;s post-apocalyptic world to give Isaac another go. 
HBO announced this today with a quick post on X (formerly Twitter) that you can see below: 
We&#x27;re beyond thrilled that Jeffrey Wright is joining the cast of The Last of Us Season 2, reprising his role as Isaac! 🐺 https://t.co/g7tlLBrHWe

                              <span>A new season of Fortnite is now live, and it brings Fallout, Magneto, plenty of nitrous oxide, and some Mad Max-esque flair to the battle royale. Titled &quot;Wrecked,&quot; Fortnite Chapter 5: Season 3 follows last season&#x27;s Greek Gods-themed season with a new battle pass, new weapons and skins, and more. 
&quot;A ferocious sandstorm recently moved over the Island, creating a new biome in the south dubbed the wasteland,&quot; an Epic Games blog post reads. &quot;The &#x27;Wasteland Warriors&#x27; have already called shotgun on owning the place (they did ride in with the sandstorm, after all). This crew moves as fast as their decked-out cars, proven by the places they&#x27;ve already established.&quot; 
We&#x27;ll break down those new locations and more below.

Every so often, I see a premise for a game that really grabs me. The Alters is the latest with its unique take on the &quot;what if&quot; questions and multiverses. What starts as seemingly a standard survival game set on a hostile alien planet quickly introduces enticing base-building mechanics and a fun premise of escaping an ever-encroaching deadly sunrise. But it&#x27;s the unique idea of the main character not only learning how different his life would have been had he made different choices at pivotal moments in his past but also being able to meet and work alongside those versions of hi…</span>

That near-decade has brought a whole heap of additions, expansions, packs and updates to the enduring life sim game, to the degree that the underlying tech serving as the foundation for dozens of later mechanical and visual elements can sometimes look a bit wobbly these days.

The captivating, combat-free Metroidvania is rich with a delectable buffet of challenges, puzzles and secrets to find even once you’ve seen the credits roll. Still, players have chewed their way through its more-ish platforming and puzzle-solving much faster than its solo developer intended, it turns out. Luckily for us all, creator Billy Basso is already looking ahead to a new game set in the moody zoo-niverse - even if that’s not a complete sequel.

                              <span>We&#x27;ve known for some time that Fallout was coming to Fortnite, we just weren&#x27;t entirely sure in what capacity. Well, now we know that this season&#x27;s wasteland offerings take the form of a sort of Mad Max meets Fallout meets Borderlands- battle royale affair. There&#x27;s a big emphasis on deserts and vehicles, basically, with highlights including: mechanical fists, turrets on cars, and the possibility of manning one of two War Buses that patrol the reworked map.

                              <span>Calling it now: this is the least intriguing article you will read about 11 bit&#x27;s The Alters, a blend of Danny Boyle&#x27;s Sunshine and Duncan Jones&#x27;s Moon in which (deep breath) you are a marooned space engineer who must spawn different versions of himself by means of backstory-branching gadgetry in order to operate an enormous, rolling base and escape the apocalyptic rays of the local sun. 


We&#x27;re not going to talk about any of that hoity-toity quantum wheeling-and-dealing in this piece, however. We&#x27;re going to talk about the fact that the opening stretch reminded me of Gears Of War and the many over-the-shoulder adventures it has influenced. I&#x27;m sorry. It&#x27;s been a complicated week involving minimal sleep, and I no longer have the grey cells for branching timelines, though they are certainly the more fascinating aspect of this game.

                              <span>In one of the better gaming trends of the last few years, we appear to have entered a golden age for booting the crud out of doors. There’s Deathbulge of course, but also the upcoming Anger Foot, Abiotic Factor, and a load more I’m sure. There was also literally Door Kickers, but that was ages ago. Anyway, the latest game to put a hinge-disrespecting protagonist front and center is also my current obsession: the excellent Post Void/Hotline Miami-type beat, Mullet Mad Jack. It’s a very fast, very silly FPS about shooting robot billionaires that takes its aesthetic from 80’s anime and PC-98 games. I’m not sure what else you need, honestly.

                              <span>I cannot compare my experience of writing a review for The Splintered Sea, the first paid expansion for dastardly clever physics puzzle builder Besiege, to that of a journaling sailor facing lethal storms on the horizon. Still, if we take for granted the idea that a review is only really valuable as an insight into the experience of the player: I haven’t been feeling especially great this week. That in mind: Splintered Sea is more Besiege, thoughtfully applied to its already expansive toolkit. More importantly, it&#x27;s currently bringing me deep and deeply needed moments of untainted, childlike, vaguely-Orkish joy.

I’m usually a lot more suspicious of hardware leaks, which are often just out-of-date or otherwise inaccurate info, but I’ve also sat through enough mic-muted prebriefings to know an official slideshow when I see one, and that appears to be exactly what Videocardz got its hands on. Besides, these specs include a gigantic 80Whr battery upgrade (doubling the ROG Ally’s 40Whr capacity), so we can at least file this under &quot;News James wants to be true.&quot;

There’s usually at least a few game announcements in there, and this year was a bumper. The headline announcement being an upcoming sequel to well-loved space-pope turn-based strategy Warhammer 40,000: Mechanicus. Yes, yes. I’m getting to the dog.

                              <span>Videogames and especially role-playing games are chock-full of sheltered upbringings that go tits up. Innocent times and places like the prologue for Baldur&#x27;s Gate, which unfolds in the vast, fortified monastery of Candlekeep (beware spoilers from this point on).
BioWare&#x27;s first ever RPG opens with your unsuspecting Chosen One learning the ropes from the old sage Gorion. There are fetchquests that take you around the enormous citadel, bits of combat training to do, cosy formative chinwags to have with characters like your childhood friend Imoen. But it&#x27;s not to last, of course: Gorion is murdered, and you must rove the Sword Coast in pursuit of his killer. When you return to Candlekeep later in the game, this once-proud bastion of learning has been filled with doppelgangers of Gorion and other acquaintances, a parade of chatbots waiting to stab you in the back.

The High Court of New Delhi issued a dynamic+ blocking order targeting several pirate sites, mostly streaming portals. The order also requires domain registrars to suspend the associated domains and Namecheap appears to have already taken swift action in response.

                              <span>Earlier this year, Game Informer revealed the exclusive first details and screenshots of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed, the video game set after the events of 2023 film, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem. Following that March reveal, developer A Heartful of Games and publisher Outright Games has largely gone quiet. Today, the publisher revealed what players can expect from the Deluxe and Collector&#x27;s Editions of Mutants Unleashed if they want to splurge on the game when it arrives later this year.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed allows you to take control of the four turtles in a 3D brawler/platformer for up to two players. The premium editions of the game will provide additional physical goodies for fans of the franchise. The Deluxe Edition includes the game, an exclusive steelbook, four pin badges, four keychains, and an artbook. Meanwhile, the Collector&#x27;s Edition includes the game, Season Pass, pizza van statue, LED sign, five pin badges, four patches, a mouse mat, notebook, pen, artbook, poster, stickers, and a collector&#x27;s box. The Deluxe Edition retails for $60, while the Collector&#x27;s Edition will set you back $200.
Oddly enough, both the Deluxe and Collector&#x27;s Editions are exclusive to the PlayStation 5 and Switch versions of the game. If you&#x27;re not planning to experience this title on those systems, but still want to at least play through the game, you&#x27;re in luck, as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleahsed arrives on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC later this year.

                              <span>Acquisitions have been rampant in the games industry recently. While the prime example on everyone&#x27;s mind is likely Xbox&#x27;s recent acquisition of Activision Blizzard, several have already occurred in 2024. The latest was announced today by Atari, which confirmed it is acquiring its longtime rival, Intellivision.
Atari announced it has purchased the Intellivision brand and more than 200 games from Intellvision Entertainment. As part of the deal, Intellivision Entertainment will rebrand and continue developing and distributing the Amico game console with a license from Atari to distribute new versions of Intellivision games on the console. Atari will also look to expand digital and physical distribution of legacy Intellivision games, potentially create new games, and explore licensing opportunities. 
&quot;This was a very rare opportunity to unite former competitors and bring together fans of Atari, Intellivision, and the golden age of gaming,&quot; chairman and CEO of Atari Wade Rosen said in a press release. 
&quot;Atari has been a valuable partner and we have every confidence they will be a responsible steward of the storied Intellvision brand,&quot; CEO of Intellivision Entertainment Phil Adam said. &quot;We look forward to our expanded collaboration and bringing a broad array of new Atari and Intellivision titles to the Amico and Amico Home family gaming platforms.&quot;
Atari has been experiencing a bit of a re-emergence in the public consciousness lately. In addition to other acquisitions, such as Nightdive Studios and Digital Eclipse, Atari has also published well-received games like Mr. Run and Jump and Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration. For more on Atari&#x27;s outlook and current strategy, be sure to listen to a 2023 episode of All Things Nintendo, which featured an in-depth conversation with Wade Rosen right here.</span>

                              <span>When Xbox revealed the date of its summer showcase, it included a mysterious teaser. Immediately following the presentation, there will be a second livestream to highlight an upcoming game in a &quot;beloved&quot; series. Today, the subject of that showcase has been revealed, and surprising no one, it&#x27;s a new Call of Duty game.
Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is a title that might confuse some, seeing as there technically isn&#x27;t a game titled Black Ops 5. This is because the fifth entry of the sub-series, which launched in 2021, was Black Ops Cold War, temporarily removing the numbered naming convention. The news was announced on social media, but was accompanied by a teaser on YouTube that seems to hint at the events of the game&#x27;s campaign.


The 40-second clip follows a group of people sneaking onto the top of Mount Rushmore, where they place blindfolds over the eyes of the presidents carved into the mountainside. The first three blindfolds read, &quot;The truth lies,&quot; while the fourth features a three-headed wolf logo that was used in the initial redacted teaser of the game.
The game will be revealed in full during a presentation on Saturday, June 9, immediately following the Xbox showcase that will start at 10 AM PT/ 1 PM ET. Microsoft is reportedly debating on whether or not the launch the game on Game Pass.

                              <span>Jason, alongside Agent Smith from The Matrix, had a cameo in the last MultiVersus trailer, but now he is the star. The footage shows off his moveset, like hitting opponents with a machete, collapsing them in a camp bunk bed, and hitting them with a sleeping bag stuffed with the body of another player. You also get a look at at least one of his alternate costumes.


MultiVersus is a free-to-play game and will launch on May 28 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

                              <span>While I’ve always thought the race towards graphical hyperrealism isn’t as pervasive as it&#x27;s often perceived, Senua&#x27;s Saga: Hellblade 2 is definitely one of those games. The kind that probably has twelve artists dedicated to the recreation of visible pores, that sort of thing. It’s so focused on looking pretty that it hasn’t even noticed the title and subtitle got mixed up.
Sure enough, Hellblade 2 is a harsh test for older hardware, with a heavy reliance on DLSS or FSR upscaling to keep performance sweet. That said, it’s no Dragons Dogma 2-style technical horrorshow either. A happy balance of visuals and smoothness is attainable on plush PCs and low-end laptops alike, while DLSS 3 frame generation can deliver an effective kick in the framerate pants on RTX 40 series GPUs.

                              <span>In Anthology of the Killer you do not exit the game using a pause menu. You exit it by walking down a back alley into the quavering arms of two hungry bears. This is just one of many laughs your diaphragm will endure as you navigate &quot;the escalating adventures of a girl trying to make zines in a town of giallo-style masked serial murderers&quot;. The horror comedy already won its creators the Nuovo Award at the Independent Games Festival this year, recognition that has been a long time coming for prolific game maker Stephen &quot;thecatamites&quot; Gillmurphy. If you&#x27;re unfamiliar with his work, you can get acquainted next week, when Anthology of the Killer gets its full release on Itch.io on May 28th.  At which point you can explore its unsettling urban hell of shady corporations and cops who think they&#x27;re cool. There&#x27;s a trailer below.

While its Epic Games Store release can be worked around, and Proton GE will get the game’s own launcher running, no combination of software, compatibility tools, or installation folder deep-diving seems capable of actually booting the game proper.
As such, I’m accepting defeat. Obviously with apologies to any studious Steam Deck Academy readers.

Lorelei and the Laser Eyes’ setup is bland compared to the others in the puzzle genre. You are a bespectacled woman carrying a clutch who walks with incredible poise into a mansion with little understanding of why you are there or what you are doing. The lack of context doesn’t matter, though, because the game immediately showers you with an incredible sense of mood. You may not know why you are petting the dog in the courtyard, checking every door, or reading every scrap of paper you come across initially, but you want to be there and see everything the game has to offer. And i…</span>

                              <span>We’ve known since October 2022 that Season 3 of Netflix’s The Witcher would be actor Henry Cavill’s last as Geralt of Rivia and that Liam Hemsworth would don the silvery mane going forward. Today, Netflix released the first teaser trailer for Season 4 giving fans their first look at Hemsworth in the role.


Unfortunately, Hemsworth doesn’t speak in the brief clip, so we still don’t know how his Geralt voice compares to Cavill’s (or the games, for that matter). But he definitely doesn’t look out of place as the White Wolf and, hopefully, won’t be too much of a distraction in this new season.
Season 4 is currently in production in the UK and will be filmed back-to-back with Season 5, which will also be the show&#x27;s finale. It has no release date but is speculated to premiere in 2025. These last two seasons will cover the three remaining Witcher books: Baptism of Fire, The Tower of the Swallow, and Lady of the Lake. The returning cast includes Anya Chalotra (Yennifer) and Freya Allan (Ciri).

                              <span>Crytek has announced the release date for Hunt: Showdown’s new-gen update, which will also conclude support for the current console versions. This update was first announced last September and will essentially force last-gen players to migrate to current consoles to continue playing the popular shooter. 
In a developer update, general manager David Fifield announced that the CryEngine 5.11 Update will go live on August 15. This update is treated as a “significant relaunch” that brings native PS5/Xbox Series X/S support along with a host of technical improvements. However, it also means the PS4 and Xbox One versions will become unplayable.
That means these players must upgrade to current hardware to continue playing their copies of the game. Crytek assures these players that if they decide to upgrade, player accounts, entitlements, and all owned DLC will transfer to the new-gen version for no extra cost. 


In addition to technical improvements, the 5.11 Update also introduces a new map and biome. In the months leading to 5.11’s launch, Crytek plans to address community and survey feedback. That includes improved reporting systems to address cheating and toxic player behavior, design reworks tackling hunter revival, health chunks, restorations, burning down hunters, and reducing stalemates. The game is also getting a new user interface, and Crytek will continue evolving the game&#x27;s recruitment and prestige progression requirements. 
Hunt: Showdown first launched for Xbox and PC in 2019, with the PS4 version arriving in 2020. The PvPvE first-person shooter is set in 1865 Louisiana as players, either alone or with two or three friends, hunt supernatural bounties in the bayou while fending off other player-controlled bounty hunters.

                              <span>Most people agree that cheating is an unfair way to win at online video games, but do cheating tools actually break the law? This question is at the center of a landmark trial currently underway between cheat maker AimJunkies and Destiny 2 creator Bungie.  Among other things, the jury must decide whether the cheat maker infringed the game&#x27;s copyrights.

After years spent representing movie rightsholders, the law firm felt copyright law should be interpreted as granting it rightsholder-like powers to obtain names, addresses, and similar information, without the rightsholders themselves having to be part of the action.

                              <span>Everything And Then The Licensed Kitchen Sink fighting game MultiVersus returns next week after an almost year-long self-imposed post-beta exile. With the decision to pull the game from sale and turn off its servers for months on end after allowing people to sink their real-life money into unlocking costumes and such (with no refunds), its developers are now looking to seemingly give something back in return.

                              <span>The classic anime series Gundam examines the traumatic experience of war, particularly the unalterable effect it has on those young soldiers forced to participate in the horrors of fighting for their life while taking the lives of others using weapons of inhuman strength and devastation. Which clearly makes it the perfect fit for a bit of upcoming DLC for military-fetishising interactive gun range Call of Duty.

                              <span>In a twist of fate I&#x27;ve mentioned in some recent Destiny 2 news posts, I am fully back into Destiny. Former vidbud Liam and I used it, initially, as something we could do while catching up on life. But now? Now we&#x27;re all in. Liam has created a spreadsheet of things we&#x27;re ticking off to prepare for the upcoming expansion, and I think it&#x27;s the perfect summation of what the game is to us: something that makes no sense at all and yet something that makes our brains hum with happiness.
And what we&#x27;ve found with Destiny, in all of its bloat, is that we haven&#x27;t explored for a single second since our return. Everything is accomplished through menus, making it quite Starfield-esque, which is terrible… but also good. We can&#x27;t make sense of it and we don&#x27;t think we ever will.

                              <span>Hauntii sets the scene with a rather magical opening sequence. A beam of light shoots out of a mysterious planet and a zoom in reveals the beam to be an asteroid, but not just any asteroid: a crystal shaped like a teardrop, with a little ghost nestled inside. You awaken as this little ghost, who it turns out, has crash landed in Eternity (and who, it turns out, is called Hauntii). Soon you bump into a ghostly girl, who guides you to a tower that thrusts you both up to a higher plane - but though she ascends, you&#x27;re dragged back to the bottom at the last moment by some netherworldly chains. And so, as Hauntii you travel through Eternity to discover who that girl was and, ultimately, how to ascend to those heavenly skies yourself.

                              <span>At RPS we like Alices. When somebody comes along with the name &quot;Alice&quot; you don&#x27;t just say &quot;oh hi&quot; like some insolent rube. You nod with solemn respect and you say, &quot;Alice&quot;. An Alice is someone you should not take lightly, nor take for granted, nor leave unmonitored. For they will destroy worlds and build better ones while you are not looking. This is dangerous and exciting. Alices are a force to be reckoned with. To treat an Alice poorly is to invite shame, dishonour, and contempt. Here are some of the best Alices in video games!

                              <span>We just got a new Elden Ring: Shadow Of The Erdtree story trailer yesterday. As is their druthers, FromSoft have at once made the events it depicts feel of earth-shattering importance while providing basically no concrete information. A lot of people will be putting out gargantuan theory posts right now, rambling on about Miquella, the Crucible, the Golden Order blah blah. This is all a distraction. Anyone with eyes can tell you that the primary movers and shakers of this final chapter in the Lands Between are a secret faction of hitherto secret spear people. You&#x27;re likely confused, and that&#x27;s understandable. As the foremost authority on ephemeral nonsense in Elden Ring, I’m the only one who has your back here.

                              <span>Internet provider Cox Communication has fought several piracy-related claims in court over the past decade. In one of the lawsuits, against music rights group BMG, it chose to settle, presumably for millions of dollars. The company hoped that its insurers would help cover the costs, but after the companies declined, Cox is now back in court after suing them both.

High-flying dunks, flaming basketballs, and the biggest names from the hardwood served as trademarks for the classic quarter-munching cabinet. Though the series has been absent for years now, with the last entry arriving in 2011 under the EA Sports umbrella, Play Mechanix and Raw Thrills have partnered with the NBA and the NBA Players Association to bring that same arcade-style basketball action to arcades with NBA Superstars.
NBA Superstars brings 3v3 arcade-style basketball action, featuring all 30 teams consisting of 120 of the biggest stars in the NBA. Players can take the court as LeBron James, Stephen Curry, Nikola Jokic, Kevin Durant, Luka Doncic, Giannis Antetokounmpo, and more in the first NBA-br…</span>

This new version of what&#x27;s arguably Kingdom Hearts’ de facto theme song is part of Utada’s greatest hits album, Science Fiction, which was released last month and features multiple re-recordings of their hit songs. Last month, Utada released the re-recorded version of “Hikaru”, the Japanese version of “Simple and Clean”.

The footage hints at a location around the Lands Between that you and others will presumably visit.


Elden Ring&#x27;s Shadow of the Erdtree DLC will be released on June 21 and will not be a standalone expansion. It requires ownership of the original game and will cost $39.99. A physical collector&#x27;s Edition of the DLC package will also be available for $249.99 and will include a statue.

                              <span>Square Enix has announced that several Kingdom Hearts games are coming to Steam next month. Three compilations, and a compilation of those compilations, will bring the entire “Dark Seeker Saga” to Valve’s storefront.
On June 13, you can purchase the following titles on Steam:
Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 + 2.5 ReMIX
Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue
Kingdom Hearts III + Re Mind DLC
Kingdom Hearts Integrum Masterpiece (bundle that includes all the above compilations)
If you’re jumping into the series for the first time or returning from a long absence and have no idea how to decipher the bizarre names of these titles, here’s what each game includes:
Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 +2.5 ReMIX
Kingdom Hearts Final Mix
Kingdom Hearts Re:Chain of Memories
Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days (HD remastered cinematics)
Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix
Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep Final Mix
Kingdom Hearts: Re:Coded (HD remastered cinematics)
Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue
Kingdom Hearts Dream Drop Distance HD
Kingdom Hearts 0.2 Birth by Sleep -A Fragmentary Passage-
Kingdom Hearts χ Back Cover (movie)
Kingdom Hearts III + Re Mind
Kingdom Hearts III
Re Mind DLC
This isn’t the first time the Kingdom Hearts series has come to PC. These games have been available on the Epic Game Store since 2021. But it’s always nice to see another audience experience a beloved franchise. Now everyone can get up to speed and join the wait for more news on the upcoming Kingdom Hearts IV.
The franchise’s move to Steam also comes shortly after Square Enix announced it would “aggressively” pursue a multi-platform strategy after Final Fantasy VII Rebirth and Final Fantasy XVI fell short of sales expectations. The publisher is in the midst of a structural reform that led to a swath of layoffs across its California and UK offices last week.</span>

The Mario brand of RPG represents some of my favorite adventures in the genre. The comedic tone, inviting art, and active battle systems have always been highlights for me, but Thousand-Year Door was a personal blind spot. I played prior and subsequent Mario RPGs, but I skipped it when the original was released in 2004, and notably was not yet employed at Game Informer at the time. With Nintendo remastering the acclaimed RPG for Switch, I welcomed the excuse to finally play it. I am impressed by how improved the…</span>

Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice didn’t need a sequel. It had a clear story to tell, and it told it well with an artful (and tactful) execution of its mental health themes and a strong conclusion. But Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II builds a great case for itself by using the titular warrior’s growth to help not only herself but, for the first time, others around her, shining her in a fascinating new light. Refined gameplay and a jaw-dropping presentation make for a more wholly satisfying sophomore outing.
Since the first game’s conclusion, Senua’s …</span>

                              <span>I could pretend I understand Square Enix&#x27;s action-RPG series Kingdom Hearts, but I don&#x27;t need to, &#x27;cos what I do understand is how popular it is. Until fairly recently the nearly 15-game-strong series, where Disney characters cross over with Final Fantasy and go to war alongside a child wielding a key (I said I don&#x27;t properly understand it), wasn&#x27;t on PC. After some games arrived on the Epic Games Store in 2021, Squeenix have confirmed that multiple Kingdom Hearts games are coming to Steam next month, on June 13th. Unlucky for some, maybe, but not Donald Duck and Goofy, two of the main characters. Long has Goofy been seen as just a joke character in the minds of people people who didn&#x27;t watch A Goofy Movie. Hopefully this brings his heroism to a wider audience.

For the benefit of people who’ve discovered the one weird trick that therapists hate and improved their mental health tenfold by deleting the bad place, here’s an incredibly cool thread I stumbled upon this morning where indie developers share non-game influences on their projects.

Street Fighter 6 is poised to wrap up its Year 1 character offerings with one of the franchise&#x27;s most iconic fighters. Akuma brings his Satsui no Hado mastery to the renowned title this week. Introduced in 1994&#x27;s Super Street Fighter II Turbo, Akuma represents the most classic post-launch character added to Street Fighter 6 during its first year of post-launch content, following Rashid (Street Fighter V), A.K.I. (Street Fighter 6), and Ed (Street Fighter IV/V).
In preparation for Akuma&#x27;s arrival, we interviewed Street Fighter 6 director Takayuki Nakayama about bringing t…</span>

                              <span>Developer Player First Games and publisher Warner Bros. Games have released the launch trailer for its upcoming platform fighter, MultiVersus, seemingly revealing Friday the 13th&#x27;s Jason Voorhees and The Matrix&#x27;s Agent Smith as new roster additions. This trailer arrives just a few weeks after we learned MultiVersus finally (re)launches next week. 
After roughly two minutes of MultiVersus hijinks with various characters from the game, the Joker, which we recently learned is joining the game with a voice by Mark Hamill, is seen sitting on the Iron Throne of Game of Thrones fame. Then, mysteriously, Jason and Agent Smith appear beside him, likely alluding to them joining the launch day roster. 
Check it out for yourself in the MultiVersus launch trailer below: 


MultiVersus is a free-to-play game and will launch on May 28 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

                              <span>Larian Studios, the team behind last year&#x27;s Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3, has opened a new studio in Warsaw, Poland. Larian Studios Warsaw is the developer-publisher&#x27;s seventh studio worldwide, and joins others in Barcelona, Dublin, Gent, Guildford, Kuala Lumpur, and Quebec. 
&quot;With two very ambitious RPGs now starting development, what better way to see our visions realized than by growing our team and opening a 7th studio in the heart of Poland&#x27;s lively gaming scene,&quot; the company&#x27;s announcement post on X (formerly) Twitter reads. 


As for what those two RPGs are, don&#x27;t expect a sequel to Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3. Despite winning countless awards last year, including Game of the Year at The Game Awards 2023, Larian&#x27;s CEO revealed back in March that the studio is done with both Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 – so no expansions – and the Baldur&#x27;s Gate series in general. 
Over on a separate blog post about Larian Studios Warsaw, the company talks about its plans with seven worldwide studios open now. 
&quot;Larian Studios set up base in one of the greatest RPG development hubs in the world – Poland, where we opened our doors in the historic city of Warsaw,&quot; the blog post reads. &quot;Like its sister studios across the globe, Larian Studios Warsaw is dedicated to fostering an environment where developers can thrive creatively and reclaim their agency. Systems-heavy RPGs need best-in-class developers; that&#x27;s why we&#x27;ve put the people who build those systems at the center of our culture.&quot;

                              <span>Internet provider WOW has asked a Colorado federal court to dismiss an expanded piracy liability complaint filed by several film companies earlier this year. The ISP says there is no evidence to show that it received any piracy notices for the 300 new works added to the lawsuit. In addition, it believes that recent court verdicts support a dismissal of at least some of the claims in the multimillion dollar lawsuit.

And you know what? It&#x27;s great! From early reveals and previews I thought it might veer into being too wacky, but it nails its tone, has some really striking levels, and bugs in earlier builds have been squashed (much as you can manually splat small parasites that make their way into your hospital). I can see this becoming a go-to comfort game for me.

                              <span>I may have winced a bit, initially, at Alice Bee’s choice of RPS Game Club game for this month. Deathbulge: Battle of the Bands looked funny and all, but it’s a turn-based RPG, a subgenre that usually elicits the same amount of enthusiasm from me as the phrase &quot;by Ernest Cline&quot; does from Alice. Deathbulge, however, is a clever little sod of a game, managing to devise not only a turn-based combat system that avoids the usual waiting-around tedium but one that’s outright good fun in itself.

                              <span>There are management games and there are micro-management games. Prison Architect 2 is the latter. I don&#x27;t mean this as an annoying thing, like when Harold from corporate starts commenting all over your document at 4.30pm on a Friday. I mean it as a distinction between those games that let you plop down a house, and others that need you to stack the bricks, install the plumbing, fit the lights, and select the wallpaper. The first Prison Architect allowed you to finesse every detail of a secure correctional facility, down to each cell and dog kennel. Unsurprisingly for a sim about prison, it encouraged obsessive control. The 3D-ified sequel isn&#x27;t finished yet, but it&#x27;s taking a similar approach. Maybe a little too similar.

A big man kills another big man with a gun but then - then! - a third big man kills that first big man with a rope. It&#x27;s dramatic stuff. Well, a data-diving enthusiast of the CoDwars has discovered a cut ending from the original trilogy&#x27;s closing chapter. It&#x27;s a more downbeat and mysterious finale, featuring a shadowy figure whose identity is never revealed. Also, Captain Price, the hero of the franchise and aforementioned big man number three, drops his cigar with possibly mortal implications.

That’s even more hands on deck to a) keep Swen Vincke’s armour polished to a fine sheen and b) ensure smooth sailing for the two new games that Larian currently have in the works.

All very upbeat. Well, hold that thought, because on the 21st, it&#x27;s time for Senua&#x27;s Saga: Hellblade 2, another slice of Celtic sort-of-psychosis from Ninja Theory, which is as grim as the accompanying Paper Trail is *checks Nic&#x27;s review* incredibly annoying?

                              <span>Redfall is getting a final update which will add an offline mode and singleplayer pausing, among other changes. The news was announced via the Redfall account on X, which also thanked players for their &quot;supportive messages&quot; in light of developer Arkane Austin&#x27;s imminent closure by Microsoft.

                              <span>This weekend is a big one for me. My brand new fancy shmancy ottoman bed is arriving in my new flat, after two weeks of curling up on the sofa with a weighted blanket. I&#x27;ll also be topping it with my brand new ultra-thick memory foam mattress topper, raising me off the floor another crucial few inches. Think of the view I&#x27;ll get from up there! To imagine there&#x27;ll be any time for games! Pah!
I kid. Plenty of time for games for us all, even while reclining on gloriously beds with ungodly amounts of storage space. We love playing games here at Rock Paper Shotgun. Even Alice, who has routinely told me that actually there are no good games. Here&#x27;s what we&#x27;ll be clicking on this weekend.

                              <span>Five Nights At Freddy’s 2, the sequel to the 2023 film adaptation of the popular horror game, has a premiere date. Freddy Fazbear and friends will return to the big screen on December 5, 2025.
As reported by Variety, Blumhouse Productions announced the date alongside a slate of other upcoming films, including M3GAN 2.0 and The Black Phone 2. It&#x27;s not surprising to see Five Nights At Freddy’s getting a follow-up. It simultaneously premiered in theaters and on Peacock on October 27, 2023, and still managed to be a massive box office success. Grossing $297 million globally, it became the year&#x27;s highest-grossing horror film, Blumhouse’s highest-grossing film ever, and the most-watched movie on Peacock for five straight days. 
The tagline for Five Nights At Freddy&#x27;s 2 reads, &quot;Anyone can survive five nights. This time, there will be no second chances.&quot; The sequel’s cast has not been announced, but the original starred Josh Hutchinson and included Matthew Lillard, Elizabeth Lail, Mary Stuart Masterson, and Piper Rubio. Director Emma Tammi is returning to direct the sequel, with FNAF creator Scott Cawthorn and Blumhouse founder Jason Blum once again assuming producer roles. 
FNAF 2 won&#x27;t be the only video game film arriving in 2025. Mortal Kombat 2, the sequel to the 2021 reboot film, was recently confirmed to release in October of that year.</span>

                              <span>After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora&#x27;s Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora&#x27;s Mask&#x27;s unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 2:00 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved.

                              <span>It&#x27;s a great time to be a Fallout fan, thanks to its excellent Amazon Prime series and the next-gen update for Fallout 4. But it seems like the fallout from this recent boom in popularity hasn&#x27;t died down quite yet. Thanks to a teaser shared on Fortnite&#x27;s official social media pages, we know that Fallout will be coming to Fortnite pretty soon

May 17, 2024
The teaser image shows power armor in a cloud of orange dust, accompanied by what appears to be some sort of industrial building. Other than that, there&#x27;s not much to go on, but we can make educated guesses. For one, Fortnite&#x27;s current season will end on May 24, so this is the perfect time to tease the skins that might be coming in the next battle pass. And if it&#x27;s anything like the recent Avatar: The Last Airbender and Star Wars crossovers, we might see Fallout-themed mechanics or areas appear on the battle royale map itself.
It will almost certainly involve some sort of cosmetic pack as well, which could include characters from the games, the Amazon Prime show, or both. Thanks to the teaser, we know power armor will be making an appearance, but it&#x27;s unclear whether it will be an item to equip in-game or a skin that can be unlocked or purchased.
For more Fortnite news, read about its recent crossover with Billie Eilish, its decision to allow players to block certain emotes, and its huge and mysterious collaboration with Disney.

                              <span>Yesterday, EA Sports College Football 25’s cover athletes and release date were revealed. Today, the game’s first full trailer provides the look at it in action. 
The trailer shows that EA is seemingly going all out to replicate the pomp and passion of college football, with over-the-top team entrances, marching band performances, and mascots galore. It remains to be seen how fun or different the on-field action is compared to its Madden counterpart, but the game at least seems to capture the school spirit. 


EA also released a batch of new screenshots, which you can view in this gallery. 

EA Sports College Football 25 launches on July 19 for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. You can learn more about its various editions, pricing, and features here.</span>

                              <span>Hades II has taken the gaming world by storm, and I&#x27;m not just saying that because it&#x27;s the subject of our current cover story. But while many have been surprised by the sheer volume of content available so far, it&#x27;s still in Early Access, so the team at Supergiant will be updating and patching it for the foreseeable future. The first of those patches came today, and it adds a few small quality-of-life improvements.
Our first Early Access patch for Hades II is out now on Steam and the Epic Games Store!! We&#x27;re very grateful for all the feedback so far, which inspired this first set of targeted improvements and fixes.

                              <span>Microsoft is reportedly planning to launch this year&#x27;s Call of Duty on its Xbox Game Pass subscription service, according to The Wall Stree Journal. This follows reports in previous weeks indicating Microsoft and Xbox were mulling over whether or not to launch the next iteration in the franchise on Game Pass, out of fear it might hurt sales. 
After acquiring Activision Blizzard for a colossal $69 billion last year, fans and analysts have speculated about how Microsoft will handle the Call of Duty franchise moving forward. It will obviously be a big draw for Xbox Game Pass, pulling in new subscribers, but most every year, the new Call of Duty is the best-selling game of the year – save for last year, where Hogwarts Legacy took that crown – and a Game Pass launch could affect those sales numbers. 


However, this new report from The Wall Street Journal seemingly clears the air around that topic. 
&quot;Microsoft plans a major shake up of its video game sales strategy by releasing the coming installment of Call of Duty to its subscription service instead of the longtime, lucrative approach of only selling it a la carte,&quot; the story reads. 
Of course, things could change so we&#x27;ll see what happens. It&#x27;s likely we&#x27;ll be learning what the next Call of Duty game is next month as part of the gaming showcase summer that includes Summer Game Fest, Ubisoft Forward, and an Xbox Games Showcase followed by a secret direct that is probably focused on Call of Duty.

Though the sheer amount of polish and Stuff in even its pre-release form might have you thinking that a full 1.0 release can’t be too far down the line, the game’s creative director reckons we’ve still got around a year to wait before it’s considered all finished up.

It quietly does several things in a modest little way, that are all the more impressive for its lack of fanfare. The core one though, is that it takes the kind of simulationist foundation normally reserved for the punishing Dwarf Fortress derivatives or gnarly logistics games, and builds on them an approachable, gentle, even philosophical game instead. In a word: it&#x27;s lovely.

The same requirement, you might recall, that Helldivers 2 players recently lobbied Sony into abandoning. No such luck here, and as previously warned, the need for said PSN sign-in to happen over Windows means that Ghost of Tsushima is essentially missing a chunk of itself on the Steam Deck.

                              <span>“In one of Nero’s many manifests,” reads a books in surreal puzzle-box Lorelei And The Laser Eyes, referring to its eccentric (read: tastefully deranged) antag-artist, “there is a satirical proposal claiming that only dictators should be allowed to direct films.” Developers Simogo - of well-deserved Sayonara Wild Hearts and Device 6 acclaim - seem to agree that’s a position worth satirising. Lorelei, despite its single-solution puzzles, is not dictatorial. It’s far too interested in collaborating with you for that. It wants you to observe, consider, and interpret its many mysteries. What’s really hooked me here is how those puzzles are kept coherent and logical, despite you getting delivered a letter by dog and occasionally visiting a floppy disk bizzaro world where you converse with a magician who manifests from his own discarded hat.

I bring it up because, as is often your way, the readership commented me into thinking about something I’ve been wanting to cover: the outdated relic that is the easy/normal/hard difficulty trifecta. &quot;Ohoho,&quot; I warbled chuckilishly. &quot;I shall craft a blistering manifesto, sharper than the apex of a Toblerone on the roof of your mouth when you try to eat it as god intended. I will solve this problem.&quot; And then I thought, &quot;Actually, no. That sounds hard.&quot; So, instead, here are some wazzock-tier ramblings.

                              <span>Creative Assembly, the studio best known for their strategy Total War series, are rumoured to be working on a licensed Star Wars title. ‘Rumoured’ is the key word here, mind. Dualshockers credit “a reliable source” with the information that “three new Total War games are currently in development,” and that “one of the three new projects is expected to be a Star Wars-themed Total War game.” There’s currently no further information beyond that, I’m afraid, although I’ve reached out to Creative Assembly for comment.

                              <span>You might remember Enotria: The Last Song as the Italian-inspired Soulslike that shifted its release date from June to August to avoid Elden Ring: Shadow Of The Erdtree... but found itself nestled next to Black Myth: Wukong. Well, scratch that August release, as now it&#x27;s been shifted back to September instead! But hey, there&#x27;s a demo coming out real soon that&#x27;ll hopefully give us a better sense of what the game&#x27;s like. I imagine it&#x27;ll involve a lot of fighting spindly monsters, dying, and resurrecting at whatever object they&#x27;ve decided will be the equivalent of Dark Souls&#x27; bonfires. Likely something Leonardo da Vinci made or drew or invented. That man&#x27;s stats were specced high.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve clocked up nearly 400 hours playing BioWare&#x27;s big fantasy RPG Dragon Age: Inquisition, which is not a stat I&#x27;m particularly proud of. I&#x27;m not ashamed either, partly because, as has been identified by artist Corey Brickley, via the Maw, there&#x27;s a lot of filler. Brickley has collated a list of suggested mods to slim down Dragon Age: Inquisition from a potentially 80 hours-long epic to a trim 40 hour story-focused romp, which means you might be able to play through it again in time for the launch of Dragon Age: Dreadwolf - which is a direct sequel to Inquisition.
I find this list of mods interesting! It&#x27;s a way to change the game quite substantially without exactly transforming it, and it&#x27;s very in-keeping with my campaign to make games 60% smaller. Still, there&#x27;s at least one item on there I&#x27;d push back on, but also this isn&#x27;t really a new problem for Dragon Age as a series.

You now sprint faster and, significantly, you can gather more than one type of crafting resource per run (as long you&#x27;ve unlocked the tool that lets you gather that resource). This  means Melinoë can now go fishing, dig up seeds, mine silver, and gain the trust of errant shades, all in a single night&#x27;s work. There is a catch though.

Maybe an empire that only covers the distance between your desk and your fridge. But an empire nonetheless. Go on, pronounce yourself God-Tyrant of your bedroom while you download Amplitude’s Endless Legend, which is 100% off on Steam  till 10am PDT, 1pm EDT and 6pm BST on May 23rd.

                              <span>There are exactly one million metroidy rogueishy action platform games and that is okay. There&#x27;s no such thing as too many of an entertaining thing in a world with, god I dunno, at least thousand humans in? Maybe more? Who knows.
They are rarely my thing, though. I try more than I really want to, for you, and games like Biomorph give me the energy to keep going through the many that leave me indifferent. This isn&#x27;t one of my grudging admissions that a subgenre isn&#x27;t all bad; it&#x27;s a game that I can&#x27;t even think of a way to complain about.

                              <span>Fans of odd games with multiple endings and themes of identity and oppression, rejoice! Or, maybe, not rejoice. Time will tell. In the latest issue of Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu, Yosuke Saito, the series producer for Nier, teased that he might be working on something new with Yoko Taro and Keiichi Okabe, the director and composer for the Nier series, respectively.
Via Gematsu and PCGamer, Saito said, “I’ve been talking about wanting to do something with Yoko and Okabe for some time now. I’ll have something a bit more put-together to say in the not-too-distant future, so please stay tuned. It might be NieR, it might not be NieR. (Laughs.) That’s about all I can say for now.” Thanks for the clarity, Saito.

Enter player ‘dremskiy’, whose tragic booting from a private game in which they just wanted to make friends has resulted in so many friend requests that their Steam account won’t accept any more.

That&#x27;s according to recent job listings on Absurd&#x27;s website (cheers Gamesradar for the spot), which mention such a thing. And to be honest, are any of us surprised? Not really. Will the finished product resemble GTA to some degree? I imagine yes. Am I happy about this? Yeah, go on then.

Buried among the chatter of &quot;profitable growth trajectories&quot; and &quot;B2B partnerships&quot; was a brief note about looter shooter The Division Heartland. &quot;Ubisoft has decided to stop development on The Division Heartland,&quot; it reads, &quot;and has redeployed resources to bigger opportunities such as XDefiant and Rainbow Six.&quot; Ah, so this is the games industry equivalent of being summarily dumped by text.

                              <span>We’re just a couple of days away from Ghost of Tsushima’s PC release date, as the former PlayStation exclusive prepares to drop its Director&#x27;s Cut - including its expansion and multiplayer DLC - on Steam. Having recently cleared up the question around whether you’ll need to sign in with a PSN account after the Helldivers 2 debacle - yes, if you want to play the co-op mode - developers Nixxes and Sucker Punch have now revealed that the login requirement will mean multiplayer won’t work on Steam Deck.

                              <span>Our players have played a lot of OpenTTD 14 since it was released a few weeks ago – in last week alone those who opted into our survey played 34,700 hours across 17,219 games. In all those hours, you’ve found some bugs, and we’ve done our best to fix them. The first maintenance release for OpenTTD 14 fixes a multiplayer desync bug and cleans up a few rough edges with the new ship pathfinder and the unbunching feature. As always, there are plenty of other bugfixes, which you can find in the changelog. Download Changelog Bug tracker</span>
