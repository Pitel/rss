                    <span>Developer Q-Games has announced that it has acquired the rights to its 2016 free-to-play multiplayer indie, The Tomorrow Children, and will be bringing it back sometime in the future. 
The Tomorrow Children was released five years ago as a free-to-play game set in a unique world that tasked players with building villages and stocking up on supplies to stop incoming attackers. It features a flair of Soviet Union-influenced post-apocalypse dystopia to it, too. According to Q-Games, a “large number of fans worldwide [clocked] up hundreds of hours each,” but The Tomorrow Children was taken offline just one year after its launch.

                    <span>Back-to-school days have never been this weird.
There are few joys in life greater than a good mystery, but a mystery surrounding cute anime girls? That is even better. Blue Reflection: Second Light is the sequel to 2017’s Blue Reflection from developer Gust and publisher Koei Tecmo. This game sees a fresh cast of characters thrust into a new world, trying to unravel the mystery of where they are and how they got there.
Blue Reflection: Second Light is a largely standalone sequel, so you don’t need to know much about Blue Reflection to dive in and enjoy yourself. There are some elements that will spark the memory of returning fans but none of it is necessary to follow the story. This game focuses on a group of young women who find themselves trapped in a school over the summer term. The world beyond the school grounds is nothing but a vast, blue ocean. As if that wasn’t bad enough, they have also lost their memories of the outside world and must delve into the dangerous world that they call The Faraway in order to find supplies.

Online play is there from day one in this latest release after its belated arrival in Super Mario Party, and a trailer posted by Nintendo UK (above) highlights that nicely with four charming individuals playing online before meeting up for a rematch in person. It&#x27;s standard fare for a Nintendo game advert, and that&#x27;s ok.

                    <span>We had to Google Washi Tape.
My Nintendo varies a great deal between regions, but we&#x27;d suggest that it&#x27;s well worth regular logins in Europe. You can get regular freebie Platinum Points on the website, and there&#x27;s a steady flow of charming physical rewards up for grabs (often only with postage to pay).
The latest addition is a WarioWare: Get It Together! Washi Tape Set, which you can see below.

With Sora being the final fighter to arrive in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, the huge ever-growing mural featuring every fighter in the game is now, finally, complete. Smash Bros boss Masahiro Sakurai recently displayed a print of the finished piece on his wall, and we here at Nintendo Life Towers have the same image as our wallpaper, proudly spread across two monitors. It&#x27;s large enough to handle many more than a measly two displays we&#x27;ve got, and it has been a non-insignificant factor in our wanting one of those fancy ultra-wide monitors.
One artistic fan of the crossover brawler to end all crossover brawlers has taken it upon themselves to 3D print the finalised mural as a lithophane and display the artwork wrapped around a lamp as a mightily impressive shade featuring every single one of the Smash brothers.

Future Publishing&#x27;s Golden Joystick awards have been a mainstay of the UK games industry for a while now (the awards first began in 1983), and this year we&#x27;re being offered the chance to vote for the &#x27;Ultimate Game Of All Time&#x27; to mark 50 years of gaming.
To get to this stage, The Golden Joystick Awards assembled a judging panel of industry experts and legends, including Katsuhiro Harada (Tekken series), Debbie Bestwick MBE (Team17), Gary Penn (DMA Design, Grand Theft Auto), Keith Stuart, Keza MacDonald (both from The Guardian), Shahid Ahmad (former lead of Sony’s Strategic Content Division) and a wide range of journalists from Future&#x27;s gaming brands – such as Edge magazine, Retro Gamer and GamesRadar.

                    <span>If Nintendo&#x27;s not going to do it...
It&#x27;s been almost two decades since we got a new F-Zero game, which really should be a crime, or something. Still, if Nintendo isn&#x27;t going to make a new F-Zero, then perhaps we should be looking elsewhere – for example, solo developer Aaron McDevitt is currently putting together an F-Zero-style racer by the name of Aero GPX, and it certainly looks like it could build on the good work seen in the franchise&#x27;s N64 iteration, F-Zero X.
Keen to learn a little more about the game, we sat down with McDevitt for a quick chat.

You don&#x27;t have to be a genius or an &#x27;insider&#x27; to figure out that Nintendo is planning more movie-style content beyond the Illumination-developed Super Mario film due in late 2022. From appointing Illumination founder Chris Meledandri to Nintendo&#x27;s board as an Outside Director, to persistant rumours that more projects are in development - most recently with Donkey Kong - it&#x27;s clear that a strategy is in place to further enhance key brands.
Throughout Nintendo&#x27;s recent investor Q&amp;A certain phrases are repeated a lot, one of which is &#x27;visual content&#x27; to reference the upcoming movie and more. Asked about the company&#x27;s plans to go further in this area, Shigeru Miyamoto was understandably careful to avoid detail but did highlight that it&#x27;s an important area for the company.

As is common these days, the next big release on many a gamer&#x27;s calendar, Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, has reportedly leaked ahead of time, with some people having already captured the game&#x27;s legendary Pocket Monsters. For spoiler-sensitive players looking forward to these DS remakes, it&#x27;s a dangerous time on the internet, but rest assured we&#x27;ll be avoiding any gameplay spoilers around these parts.

How long is a console lifecycle? It really depends on the system, but conventional wisdom seems to suggest that it&#x27;s around five years – although there are exceptions, of course, such as the original Game Boy.
Going by that accepted wisdom, the Switch should be entering the twilight years of its lifespan as it will be five years old in February 2022 – but Nintendo has repeatedly stated that it sees the machine at the mid-point of its commercial existence.

                    <span>Could this be the rumoured open-world game?
Sega has filed a trademark for the name &#x27;Sonic Frontiers&#x27;, which has triggered speculation that this is the final name of the upcoming 2022 Sonic title.
The new game – which was teased in May this year and is coming to Switch – is rumoured to be an open-world adventure in the same style as Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Sega had previously used the name &#x27;Sonic Rangers&#x27; for this outing, which may (or may not) be a placeholder title.

                    <span>Want to build the best Type 100 loadout in Call Of Duty: Vanguard? The Type 100 is currently overlooked a bit in favour of the higher-damage MP-40, but I&#x27;m here to strongly recommend you give it a go. Don&#x27;t be dissuaded by the Type 100&#x27;s low damage-per-shot: with the sright attachments, this gun&#x27;s one real downside can be turned into its greatest strength.
Below we&#x27;ll walk you through how to put together the very best Type 100 loadout in Vanguard, going into detail about what each attachment does for you and how everything works together to turn the Type 100 into one of the most formidable weapons in the game. We&#x27;ll also talk about great weapons to pair it with, and the ideal perks and equipment to use in the perfect Type 100 loadout.

                    <span>Want to know the best Automaton loadout in Call Of Duty: Vanguard? The Automaton has an effective damage range that rivals the BAR, but its overall damage is much lower. However, to make up for the lower damage, it has a fast fire rate that makes it a strong Assault Rifle at any range. This Call Of Duty: Vanguard Automaton loadout will sacrifice some of that speed to increase the damage range, accuracy, and control, making it more effective at medium-long range.

By the time you get off, it’s all blurred into one forgettable experience. How could you emerge shellshocked, when you’ve seen it all before?

                    <span>Playground Games will add sign language interpreters to Forza Horizon 5&#x27;s cinematics, adding to an already long list of accessibility features. The devs are currently working American Sign Language (ASL) and British Sign Language (BSL) support, which will come to the game sometime soon. They&#x27;ved also detailed a number of accessibility options the game has from launch today, including screen reading, game speed modification and more.

                    <span>Want to know the best Volk loadout in Call Of Duty: Vanguard? The Volk is one of the best Assault Rifles in Call Of Duty: Vanguard, but you’ll need some attachments to unlock its full potential. At first, the recoil is sharp and it is only effective at short range. With this loadout, we drastically improve the accuracy and recoil control of the Volk, whilst also slightly increasing its effective damage range and fire rate to make it capable of ripping through enemies at short-medium range. Of course, as Call Of Duty: Vanguard season 1 draws closer, we expect the meta to change significantly, so this guide will receive regular updates with any new info about the Volk.

                    <span>You could argue Playground Games have just made essentially the same game at least three times in a row with Forza Horizon now, but while every previous edition had a few things you could point at to show how it was imperfect, you can’t do that here. Forza Horizon 5 is as close to flawless as any racer has ever come. For this level of quality to successfully cover such a massive and ambitious game world is a monumental achievement and should be celebrated with some kind of festival. A festival of driv… OK, yes, you should celebrate by playing it. That’ll do just fine.

                    <span>Niantic is rolling out a series of special events in Pokémon Go to celebrate the releases of Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl. The events detailed on the Pokémon Go website begin next week and feature catchable Sinnoh starters with new hats, collectible Trainer costumes, and more!
Starting on November 16, Trainers can find the Sinnoh starters Turtwig, Chimchar, and Piplup out in the wild wearing either a Lucas hat or a Dawn hat (both sets pictured above). Any of these Pokémon can be found in their shiny variants as well! The event will also halve the number of steps needed to hatch Pokémon eggs in incubators and lower the Super Incubator steps to one-third of the usual step count required.

Battlefield 2042 will throw players into massive skirmishes set in a tumultuous world ravaged by one of our current greatest existential threats: climate change. What does Dice have in store for Battlefield’s grand return to the modern era? Here’s everything you need to know about this much-anticipated shooter.
What’s changing from previous Battlefield games?
Unlike the last handful of entries in the series, Battlefield 2042 is returning to the franchise&#x27;s roots with an entirely multiplayer experience. DICE has forgone the single-player campaign and is opting to deliver all of its narrative threads through the various multiplayer components, like the maps and in…</span>

                    <span>Update, 11/08/21:
After speculation over a Quality and Performance mode discovered via an Elden Ring purchase listing, FromSoftware has revealed the official specs and compatibility details for the upcoming RPG.
The PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X versions will be identical – both have a Resolution mode that prioritizes a 4K resolution with a 30 FPS lock, and a Performance mode that will prioritize 60 FPS gameplay with a dynamic resolution that adjusts while playing to ensure the 60 FPS frame rate remains stable. Both new-gen consoles will support raytracing (via patch) and HDR as well. 
The Xbox Series S will support resolutions up to 1440p and a 60FPS framerate (via the Performance mode). It also supports HDR, but it won&#x27;t include raytracing. 
On the PlayStation 4 Pro, expect an 1800p re…</span>

                    <span>Xbox Game Pass is Microsoft&#x27;s Netflix-like video game subscription service and its library continues to grow with each passing month. This November alone, the service is gaining Forza Horizon 5, It Takes Two, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas – The Definitive Edition, and more. However, the usual monthly announcement of Xbox Game Pass titles isn&#x27;t always the only slew of games we learn are coming to the service. 
Every now and then, Xbox likes to tease some surprise additions and today, the Xbox Game Pass Twitter account began to tease...something. 
Things are going to get a bit...orange this week
November 8, 2021
This immediately got our minds racing: what could this game be? Our first thought was Valve Corporation&#x27;s game collection, The Orange Box. Originally released in 2007, The Orange Box included Half-Life 2 and its two episodes, Team Fortress 2, and Portal. This collection was first released on PC and Xbox 360 before making its way to the PlayStation 3 two months later. While it&#x27;s playable on Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One consoles today via backward compatibility, it&#x27;s not currently on Xbox Game Pass. Today&#x27;s tease seems to indicate it might be joining the lineup soon, though. 
But what if it&#x27;s not that? Well, we have some other ideas in mind too. Maybe it&#x27;s the newly-released Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl, a Smash Bros.-like fighter starring characters from Nickelodeon TV series. If Nickelodeon is known for one thing (other than slime, of course), it&#x27;s the color orange. It joining Xbox Game Pass would be a great way to beef up the player count and grow the excitement around the fighter. 
Another famous &quot;orange&quot; in video games is Crash Bandicoot. Perhaps  Crash Bandicoot 4: It&#x27;s About Time is coming to Xbox Game Pass. 
That&#x27;s enough from us, though. We want to hear what you think this bit of orange coming to Xbox Game Pass sometime this week is. Do you also think it&#x27;s The Orange Box? What do you hope it is? Did we miss a classic orange in the world of video games? Let us know in the comments below!</span>

                    <span>Hideo Kojima’s revolutionary franchise, Metal Gear Solid, remains one of the most beloved tactical espionage (and wacky military dramatizations) of all time. Sons of Liberty and Snake Eater have served as compelling examples of definitive stealth mechanics based on weather, smell, temperature, and outfitted camouflage (among many other features) coupled with resounding narrative themes delve into philosophy and morality. Unfortunately, fans might have a hard time playing the classics, albeit for a limited time.  Metal Gear Solid 2, 3, and the HD collections containing them are being temporarily removed from digital storefronts. 
According to the Metal Gear portal on Konami’s official website, a long list of Metal Gear games will be inaccessible. The info reads as follows:

                    <span>Final Fantasy XIV’s 24 million registered players weave a tale of hard-fought success considering the original game’s shaky release before the reupholstered A Realm Reborn launch. Since then, Eorzea has grown with multiple expansions: Heavensward, Stormblood, and Shadowbringers, each introducing new areas to explore, more character jobs, and exciting story beats to bolster the already compelling central narrative. Endwalker is the next large-scale addition. The pandemic affected the fourth expansion’s production, and now producer and director Naoki Yoshida has announced a short two-week delay alongside a new Endwalker launch trailer (seen below).

                    <span>Marvel Studios and Sony Pictures Entertainment have released the first official poster for Spider-Man: No Way Home. 
The multiverse Spider-Man threequel is set directly after the events of Spider-Man: Far From Home, with Tom Holland turning to Benedict Cumberbatch’s Dr. Strange for help with the whole “the entire world knows I’m Spider-Man and that’s affecting not just me, but my friends and family too” dilemma, as seen in the first trailer released. Dr. Strange uses a special spell to re-conceal Peter’s identity, but this is an MCU movie, so things don’t go according to plan, and the multiverse opens.

                    <span>The Wii sequel is darn good, too.
Sin &amp; Punishment is a Nintendo 64 game well known among Nintendo enthusiasts, but there are also likely to be a number of Switch owners that see the logo for the game in the N64 app (for those that opt to get the Expansion Pass) and won&#x27;t have that flash of familiarity. It&#x27;s no wonder, too, as despite Nintendo co-developing it with Treasure it remained a Japan-only title when it launched in 2000.
It would be 2007 before players outside of Japan (and non-importers) could officially enjoy the game via the Wii Virtual Console, and later on the Wii U Virtual Console. The VC version drew in plenty of curious players, and then we had the brilliant Wii sequel Sin &amp; Punishment: Star Successor in 2009. Sadly the series is now seemingly dormant, with Treasure&#x27;s only recent output being the port of Ikaruga that was published by Nicalis on Switch.

Recently Nintendo of Europe confirmed that Story of Seasons: Pioneers of Olive Town is the next game trial heading to the region for Switch Online subscribers. Nintendo of America has now joined in and, arguably, is offering the better promotion this time around.
In North America Switch Online subscribers will be able to play the full version of The World Ends With You: Final Remix, with the trial available from 10th November to 16/17th November depending on time zone. In an extra bonus both that game and its sequel, the excellent NEO: The World Ends With You, will be 30% off on the eShop until 19/20th November.

You might consider yourself to be a really serious Pokémon fan because you own all of the games, as well as a few plush toys and a (totally unironic) Ash Ketchum cap, but if you&#x27;re truly dedicated to the brand then you&#x27;ll have to up your game to the tune of $25,000 because The Pokémon Company has teamed up with the French crystal manufacturer Baccarat to present a trio of special collectable items to mark the 25th anniversary of the monster-catching series.
At the lower end of the scale, there&#x27;s a 5.7 inch Pikachu figure for $440, as well as a crystal Poké Ball which is 2.7 inches tall and will set you back a cool $410.

Are you looking for a fight, mate? Are you looking for a fight? Sounds like the threatening enquiry of a ne&#x27;er-do-well, but it’s the height of decorum compared to the typical inhabitant of a scrolling beat &#x27;em up. Tunche is no different, as its assorted jungle pests don’t stop to ask how you feel about being licked, whomped, or banana-targeted – they just dive straight in and gnaw the HP off you.
The whole game doesn’t hang around to onboard the player either. There is a lot happening from the get-go, with Andrex-length scrolls of lore and instructions, a home camp screen that soon fills up with playable and non-playable characters, multiple collectible currencies, and stalls where you shop calculatedly through skill trees for multiple character profiles. That’s not to mention the in-play pick-ups and the constantly expanding movesets of each of five playable characters. For better or worse, it’s a far cry from the pick-up-and-play roots of the genre like Streets of Rage or Ninja Warriors (both excellently modernised for Switch in recent years).

Freedom Games has announced that Clouzy!, a farming sim from indie developer Tinymoon, will launch on Switch on 17th February 2022.
Billed as a &quot;cute and wholesome farming game&quot;, Clouzy! has you exploring a brightly-coloured world alongside your very own flying pet, collecting fruit, cooking up meals and more as you go. You&#x27;ll also be looking after a cloud daycare, where you can feed and play with your pet clouds in peace – if only that was real life.

                    <span>Still no sign of Yo-kai Watch 4.
A newly spotted trademark suggests that Level-5 could be planning to bring Y School Heroes: Bustlin&#x27; School Life to Switch in the west.
The game is an RPG that&#x27;s part of the Yo-kai Watch&#x27;s &#x27;Jam&#x27; spin-off series; it launched for Switch in Japan last August, and eventually showed up on PS4 in the region later that year. No official word on a western port has been shared by Level-5 at the time of writing, but a multi-region release could make sense as fans wait patiently for a western localisation of Yo-kai Watch 4.

UK physical chart data is now in for the week ending 6th November, revealing that Mario Party Superstars has remained in third place for a second consecutive week.
Still sitting comfortably as Switch&#x27;s highest-charting game for now, the latest entry in the Mario Party franchise couldn&#x27;t compete with new multiplatform release, Call of Duty: Vanguard; Activision&#x27;s title managed to knock FIFA 22 off top spot for the first time, earning itself a debut number one.

                    <span>A tough job under difficult circumstances.
There’s one magic word that gets trotted out all the time in this hobby, a handy term used to describe all digital ills — lazy. ‘How did this bleh of a game end up on the eShop?’ ‘Who couldn’t be bothered to finish this puzzle / minigame / character’s face properly?’ ‘How much more effort would it have taken to add feature X / Y / Z?’
A new release that isn’t different enough from the last game in the series? Lazy. Reusing assets, which could be anything from handy 3D props of mundane objects to pre-existing (and expensive) motion captured animations? Lazy. QA staff — those people with the outwardly desirable job of testing games all day long — are another frequent target of this generic ire, often accused of being lazy for somehow ‘missing’ obvious bugs and other game-breaking issues. The truth is that QA staff find these issues, raise them, and then someone else — another lazy person, no doubt — decides what to address given the cost, complexity and available time.

The company behind the likes of Final Fantasy and Tomb Raider has actually dipped its toes into NFT waters previously. It recently collaborated with Double Jump Tokyo – a blockchain tech company – to create a series of digital assets for its Million Arthur franchise.

                    <span>A royal flush.
Especially in more recent years, the eccentric Yoko Taro of Nier fame has made quite a name for himself as a game designer simply without an equal. Any project he works on is sure to be interesting and experimental in certain ways, and this trend has continued with his latest release: Voice of Cards: The Isle Dragon Roars. Though this card-based RPG proves itself to be more traditional than it first appear to be, it nonetheless delivers a satisfying and enjoyable take on the RPG genre that you won’t want to miss out on.
Voice of Cards has an extremely traditional narrative, but it also stands as a fantastic example of how delivery is just as important as content. This is a story that’s ‘just’ about a fellowship of adventurers who travel across the continent to slay a dragon threatening the land. Along their journey, they stop in various towns and get caught up in whatever subplot the chapter calls for. Sometimes a new party member even joins afterward. This kind of story is likely nothing you haven’t seen before, but it’s elevated to something much more special by the narration.

Actraiser Renaissance certainly came out of the blue when it was announced earlier this year. An update of the legendary SNES title, it mixes action platforming with world-building to excellent effect – so much so that we gave it a high recommendation in our review.
The game&#x27;s director, Hideo Iwasaki, has been speaking on the Square Enix blog about the game and reveals that a system was almost included where you could &#x27;be the bad guy&#x27; and earn a special title based on your in-game actions.

                    <span>New Pokémon arrive, plus bug fixes.
Pokémon&#x27;s had its fair share of quirky spin-offs over time – remember the surprisingly decent Learn With Pokémon: Typing Adventure on Nintendo DS? – but none find themselves quite as high on the &#x27;we didn&#x27;t expect that&#x27; scale than Pokémon Smile.
Released last year, Pokémon Smile is a smartphone app designed to encourage kids to regularly and correctly brush their teeth with the incentive of catching Pokémon for doing so. Being the big, serious games media outlet that we are, we actually shared a review of the app upon release, praising its adorable design and fun activities, but criticising its rather harsh tracking tech.

There is a twist, at least: the battle pass is 100% free, and there&#x27;s a new robot-battling mode included in the update, too.

Version 1.1.46, released this Saturday, makes several changes which should reduce multiplayer latency.

Before paid expansions start rolling in 2022, this year we should expect to see new free stuff including a solo offline mode with progression, a new card type, new cards, and more.

The festivities are carrying on this week in League Of Legends and Legends Of Runeterra as well, with new &quot;interactive experiences&quot;, game modes and more.

                    <span>Well, here’s a bit of a bum note in the otherwise upbeat tune of Intel’s 12th Gen Alder Lake CPUs: the new chips are apparently tripping up games that use Denuvo DRM. Not all of them, fortunately, but Intel has listed over 50 games that might suffer compatibility issues across Windows 10 and Windows 11 when using an Alder Lake processor. These include big names like Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order and Total War: Three Kingdoms. (Update - Fallen Order has now removed Denuvo completely, so should be fine.)

Running and gunning with a shotgun is an iconic Call Of Duty activity, and there are plenty of good shotguns to try in Call Of Duty: Vanguard. The Combat Shotgun is the best shotgun in Vanguard, so it’s an ideal weapon to use when sliding around corners to obliterate the enemy team. We expect the Call Of Duty: Vanguard meta to change frequently, so expect this guide to be updated often as the Combat Shotgun receives tweaks and moves around in the meta.

                    <span>Looking to find the best Shotgun in Call Of Duty: Vanguard? Combining the stopping power of a sniper rifle and the close-range dominance of an SMG, Shotguns in any FPS are mostly ranked based on their capacity to one-shot-kill enemies. In Call Of Duty: Vanguard, every Shotgun has the ability to one-shot-kill, so the key thing to consider is the effective range at which you can do so.
Below we&#x27;ll walk you through the very best Shotguns in Call Of Duty: Vanguard and what makes them so great compared to the competition. We&#x27;ll also reveal a secret combination of attachments you can use on certain Shotguns to turn them into some of the most ridiculously overpowered guns available in the game.

                    <span>How can you enable or disable crossplay in Call Of Duty: Vanguard? Call Of Duty: Vanguard is the latest entry into the long-running FPS franchise. A lot has changed in the 18 years since COD first entered our lives, but at least one thing remains consistent: players&#x27; desire to team up with their friends in multiplayer, regardless of which platform they&#x27;re playing on.

                    <span>If you feel like you might at any point want a copy of Metal Gear Solid 2 on PC, you should probably buy it today. Konami have announced that starting today, they plan to temporarily remove MGS2 (and 3, though that&#x27;s not on PC) from digital stores while they renew licenses for historical footage used in the game. They plan to start selling them again once the licenses are renewed, but that would require Konami successfully accomplishing something, and do you really trust them to do that?

                    <span>Comedian Dara Ó Briain has an old bit where he talks about video games, and the difficulty barrier that games have compared to other kinds of media. &quot;You cannot be bad at watching a movie. You cannot be bad at listening to an album. But you can be at playing a video game. And the video game will punish you, and deny you access to the rest of the video game.&quot;
Don&#x27;t worry; I&#x27;m not about to take out a cane and start hammering away at the skeletal, equine remains of the &quot;difficulty in games&quot; debate. But I always remember that joke. I like him miming a book quizzing you on what the major themes of the text are so far, and then woomp-ing closed if you can&#x27;t answer, and I thought of it again recently while playing Inscryption.

                    <span>Want to level up fast in Call Of Duty: Vanguard? Keeping up with the competition is key to success in multiplayer games, and Call Of Duty: Vanguard isn&#x27;t about to break the mould. You&#x27;ll want to earn XP fast in order to rank up as often as possible, of course. However, multiple parallel XP paths are all the rage these days, and Vanguard complicates things a bit by having three completely separate XP systems active in the game.

                    <span>With less than three weeks to go before the launch of Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker, Square Enix announced a two-week delay for the MMORPG&#x27;s fourth expansion. Previously due on the 23rd of November, it&#x27;s now expected on the 7th of December. Sounds like they need more time to work on stability, though game director Naoki Yoshida&#x27;s explanation was a little more dramatic, offering his &quot;sincerest apologies for the inconvenience caused to our players and colleagues due to my own shortomings.&quot;

                    <span>Romuald Capron left Arkane Studios in October, just under a month after the release of their time-looping stealth &#x27;em up, Deathloop. But after 16 years at the company, the studio director wanted to try something new, and is currently working on a free educational game named PowerZ. I spoke to Capron about what this new project will entail, and how it felt to leave Arkane after such a long career there.

It will take a bit of work with the BAR in order to unlock its full potential, but let me tell you now: it&#x27;s worth the effort. With the right setup, the BAR is capable of killing an enemy with two shots to the body, and with the right attachments landing those two shots is incredibly easy to do.
Below we&#x27;ve detailed the exact attachments you need to unlock and equip in order to make the best possible BAR loadout in Call Of Duty: Vanguard. We&#x27;ll also go over some great secondary weapons to use alongside the BAR, along with our recommended picks for Perks and equipment.

                    <span>Yesterday was N7 Day, an annual celebration of all things Mass Effect, and this year was a little quieter than the last. In 2020, BioWare revealed they were working on a brand new game in the series, but this year they looked back on the Mass Effect trilogy remasters that came out in May. I thought that was all they had in store until the very end of the day when they tweeted a new teaser poster for the next game, featuring a crater shaped like a giant geth head. Geth! Mass Effect trilogy villains! Get your goggles on, reader, it&#x27;s time to investigate this pic.

                    <span>Looking for up-to-date Call Of Duty: Vanguard weapon stats? Call Of Duty: Vanguard launched with a total of 32 different guns, each of which has the potential to be kitted out with up to 10 attachments at once. That&#x27;s an awful lot to learn, and the game&#x27;s charts on Firepower, Speed, and so on don&#x27;t give you the best idea of how each weapon compares to its rivals.
Below you&#x27;ll find in-depth Call Of Duty: Vanguard weapon stats tables for all the different gun classes, so you can easily and quickly compare two different guns&#x27; damage profiles, fire rates, time-to-kills, recoil, handling stats, and more.

Nevýhodou mutter je, že musí vykreslit celou obrazovku do paměti a tím vzrostla paměťová náročnost. Proto se mutter použije jen na modelech s 2 GB RAM a více. Na ostatních bude stále openbox.</span>

                    <span>November 7 continues to be the gaming holiday where BioWare fans celebrate their favorite space-faring RPG franchise, Mass Effect. This year, BioWare released a blog post full of looking back at the series impact and this year&#x27;s release of the Mass Effect Legendary Edition.
The blog also details new products fans can buy, sales on the games, and even new Mass Effect-themed Steam emotes. A giant infographic runs down the numbers on big choices Mass Effect Legendary Edition players went with, revealing 15% of people did not recruit Garrus, an option 85% of us can&#x27;t calibrate our brains or our hearts to leave that precious boy behind. However, there&#x27;s nary a mention about the future until the end of the post, which says, &quot;We are, of course, hard at work on the next adventure in the Mass Effect universe.&quot; We knew that, though, after a teaser trailer premiered at The Game Awards last year.
It looked like that&#x27;s all there was to this year&#x27;s N7 Day. That is until the image below was posted on Twitter:
Speculations are flying left and right, with thoughts and theories about every detail in the picture, from the type of ship parked at the lower half to the crew walking away from it (one looks Krogan, while the rest are humanoid, like most playable Mass Effect species). The crater located at the top of the image looks suspiciously like the head of a Geth, the synthetic beings potentially wiped out by one of the endings in Mass Effect 3. Now, I&#x27;m no expert on the series, but the similarities are certainly there.
We&#x27;ll have to wait a little longer for confirmation on what exactly we&#x27;re looking at here, but until then, we&#x27;ll have fun watching ecstatic fans comb for any bits of information.
What do you see in the teaser image? Are the Geth for sure back in the ME universe? Does the art have any hints of how BioWare will tie together the original trilogy with Andromeda? Are there other space races you can pick out of the starship lineup? Please give us your best guesses in the comments!</span>

                    <span>While it was initially communicated by Intel that Alder Lake&#x27;s Golden Cove P-Cores has AVX-512 &quot;fused off&quot;, that has turned out not to be the case at least with the initial batch of processors and current BIOS/firmware configurations. If disabling the power-efficient Gracemont E-Cores, it&#x27;s possible to enable AVX-512 and make use of it. Here are some initial AVX-512 benchmarks in such a configuration under Linux with the Core i9 12900K.</span>

                    <span>The first season of Game Informer&#x27;s Video Gameography explores the history of the Metroid series. This week we&#x27;re tackling Samus&#x27; acclaimed Game Boy Advance outing, Metroid Fusion.
Metroid Fusion launched on November 17, 2002 – the same day as Metroid Prime. Developed by Nintendo R&amp;D1, it stars Samus as she explores a space station overrun by shapeshifting parasites called X. Worst of all, Samus is hunted by an X parasite that has mimicked her appearance and abilities: the SA-X. Metroid Fusion served as a return to the 2D gameplay of Super Metroid with modern improvements such as faster movement and traversal and a ledge grab. Fusion was critically acclaimed as one of the best GBA games ever made; some fans even consider it a rival to Super Metroid as the best entry in the series. Chronologically, Fusion served as the final chapter in the Metroid saga for decades until 2021&#x27;s Metroid Dread. 
Join hosts Ben Reeves (@BenjaminReeves), Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), and special guest Digital Eclipse editorial director Chris Kohler (@kobunheat) as we explore Metroid Fusion&#x27;s lore, development history, and lasting impact.

While the initial Steam on Linux excitement phased out a bit after Steam Machines didn&#x27;t materialize, as we approach a decade with Steam on Linux it&#x27;s easily as exciting as ever thanks to Steam Play / Proton for allowing massive amounts of Windows games to run on Linux and the imminent release of the Steam Deck that has fueled renewed interest around Linux gaming...</span>

                    <span>What makes a good shooter? Immediate answers might include punchy phrases/words like “gun feel” or “kit customization.” Even so, it’s hard to define the gratification that comes with securing that coveted victory in ranked multiplayer or surviving a seemingly never-ending onslaught in single-player horde mode. A good shooter tends to contain a smorgasbord of enticing components – gripping atmosphere, weapon/ability balancing, enjoyable arenas, etc. Regardless of style (e.g., FPS, third-person, top-down), the aforementioned features tend to mesh well with polished gameplay, sweeping narratives, and new or improved mechanics. If you feel at home sprinting through multilayered environments, mowing down adversaries with precision and cunning, then the ten games on this list are definitely wort…</span>

                    <span>Animated adaptations of video games generally receive more faith from players than their live-action counterparts. That’s understandable; most games are animated in one form or another, so it’s easier to replicate an aesthetic than to find actors and build sets that match the source material exactly. On top of the myriad of live-action shows based on games, there’s an equally sizable, if not larger, slate of animated series on the horizon. If you’re a fan of animated takes on the medium, here’s a snapshot of every upcoming TV series to keep an eye on with trailer links where applicable.

                    <span>Skyrim’s 10th anniversary is upon us and Bethesda is re-releasing it, yet again – this time packaged as the Anniversary Edition. 
This new edition includes every piece of Creation Club content ever released, including additional quests, armor, and gameplay modes. It also comes with a new-gen patch for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S players. When the Anniversary Edition was announced back in August, Bethesda revealed that the new-gen update would be free to all who own the Special Edition of Skyrim, which was released during the previous generation of consoles. 
However, those Special Edition players would need to pay in order to get the Creation Club content. A price for both this upgrade to get the new content and the actual Anniversary Edition was not announced at that time, though. Thanks to a new Anniversary Edition FAQ released today, we know the price to both, as reported by IGN. 
“The MSRP for the Skyrim Anniversary Edition on digital storefronts will be USD $49.00… at launch,” the FAQ reads. “If you already own Skyrim Special Edition, the MSRP for the Anniversary Upgarde on digital storefronts will be USD $19.99… at launch.” 
Physical editions of it will be available for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One systems, according to Bethesda, and prices and availability may vary from retailer to retailer. In terms of what to expect with the new-gen upgrade, Bethesda says “the upgrade will be free and optimize the game with enhanced graphics, faster loading times, and more.” 
All trophies and achievements will transfer over from the Special Edition to the Anniversary Edition, as well, except when upgrading from the PS4 version to the PS5 version. The Anniversary Edition will be released on November 11.

                    <span>343 Industries has released new information about the Halo Infinite Battle Pass system, including how players will be able to switch between passes. 
In a new interview with IGN, Infinite Head of Design Jerry Hook and Lead Progression Designer Chris Blohm discussed how the game’s approach to battle passes will work in the free-to-play multiplayer. They said it&#x27;s aimed at keeping all kinds of players returning to it.

“We wanted to be able to say, ‘Hey, look, when you put 10 bucks in, you keep that 10 bucks’,” Hooks told IGN. 
That’s alluding to the fact that battle passes in Infinite never expire, meaning if you don’t finish a given battle pass before its associated season is up, you can still work on it in the next season. According to Hook and Blohm, …</span>

                    <span>Microsoft has proven itself to be a leader in video game accessibility, and the features available in Forza Horizon 5 support reaffirm that status. In a blog post yesterday, Playground Games’ Mike Brown detailed a large swath of toggles and settings that make Horizon 5 playable for those who may be hearing or visually impaired or have other accessibility needs.
Highlighting the importance of these features in his post, Brown wrote, “We want everyone in the world to be able to experience our game, and with more than an estimated 400 million gamers with disabilities across the globe, it is vital that all players be able to tailor their gameplay in a way that works best for them.” Many of the features present come from conversations with the Gaming &amp; Disability community, which detailed vario…</span>

                    <span>EA CEO Andrew Wilson recently said non-fungible tokens and blockchain games are the future of the video game industry during a recent company earnings call. He also said he’s unsure of how. 
This news comes by way of PC Gamer, which reported on Wilson’s NFT-related statement during the earnings call. In a bit of a cart before the horse situation, Wilson made the bold claim that NFTs and “play-to-earn” games, aka blockchain games, are the “future of our industry” before adding that “it’s still too early to figure out how that’s going to work.” With that being said, it’s unclear what makes him so sure. 
“I think that in the context of games we create and the live services that we offer, collectible digital content is going to play a meaningful part in our future,” Wilson said, according to P…</span>

Dr. Wu is Jurassic World&#x27;s Dr. Frankenstein – a mad scientist who creates new life by sewing together the DNA of different dinosaurs. His hybrids are more capable hunters, better suited to handle harsh climates, and are far more terrifying than the Tyrannosaurs rex. In Jurassic World Evolution 2, we see Frontier Developments taking a cue from Dr. Wu. The dinosaurs players interact with are more aware of their surroundings, can find their own food, and even learn to hunt in packs.

                    <span>Nintendo is reportedly happy with the upcoming CG Mario movie being made by Despicable Me and Minions studio Illumination, and according to Shigeru Miyamoto, more movies based on Nintendo properties could be on the way. 
This news comes by way of Video Games Chronicle, which reported on the latest Q&amp;A session section of Nintendo’s recent financial results briefing. In it, Miyamoto told investors that the upcoming Mario movie is basically done and that Nintendo is feeling very positive about it. 
Don’t get too excited just yet, though – Nintendo doesn’t plan on releasing the movie early despite it being essentially done. It’s still planned for Holiday 2022. Miyamoto reportedly said that Nintendo really wants to meet fans’ expectations with this Mario movie and that as a result, it will use the extra time to continue polishing the film ahead of its release next year. 
Elsewhere in Miyamoto’s discussions about the movie, he said that Nintendo is planning ot make more movies based on its other properties, citing a desire for people to experience said properties in a variety of ways (rather than just video games). He said Nintendo will make each movie one by one, though, so as not to have multiple in production, which could affect each’s quality. 
These comments come just days after rumors of a Donkey Kong movie headed by Seth Rogen, who is voicing Donkey Kong in the Mario movie, began to swirl around, as noted by VGC. Only time will tell what the next Nintendo movie is, but considering Donkey Kong and Cranky Kong, who will be voiced by Fred Armisen, have already been cast, a Donkey Kong movie sounds like a safe bet. 
While waiting to learn more about Nintendo’s movie plans, check out the full cast list for the upcoming Mario movie.

                    <span>Final Fantasy VII: The First Soldier, a mobile battle royale set in Midgar, will be released this month. 
Square Enix had previously stated The First Soldier would be released in November, as reported by IGN, but thanks to the new opening cinematic that debuted on YouTube today, we know the exact release date: November 17. That’s less than two weeks away and what better way to get excited about the dubs you’ll hopefully be getting in the battle royale than by watching the new opening movie for The First Soldier.

Set 30 years before the events of Final Fantasy VII, The First Soldier is about, well, the first soldiers that the Shinra electric Company began using on the outskirt battlefields of Midgar. As expected, the opening movie is completely CG and it doesn’t really feature anything to do with the actual battle royale aspect of The First Soldier, save for the last few seconds that show some characters jumping out of a helicopter in a very battle royale fashion. 
You can pre-register for the battle royale now and doing so could get you some pre-registration rewards, determined by how many people actually pre-register: 
300,000: Chocobo Egg
500,000: Shinra Mask Skin
770,000: Shinra Bike Skin
1,000,000: Shinra Utility Vehicle Skin
2,000,000: Shinra Helicopter Skin
The 75-player Final Fantasy VII battle royale will be released in 12 days on iOS and Android devices on November 17. 
While waiting for that, check out the latest details we learned about Final Fantasy VII: The First Soldier and then read about Final Fantasy VII Ever Crisis, the other Final Fantasy VII-centric mobile game Square Enix announced earlier this year.

                    <span>Konami’s eFootball 1.0 launch has been delayed to next year, and the mobile versions of it have seemingly been delayed indefinitely. 
This news comes from a new blog post from Konami that details what’s going on with this iteration of eFootball. The team needs more time to develop the 1.0 update and squash bugs currently present in the current “demo” version of the game, which is what Konami refers to it at this point in time, as noted by IGN. 
“We would like to inform you that the v1.0.0 update for eFootball 2022, scheduled to be released on November 11, 2021, has been postponed until Spring 2022,” the blog post reads. “Also, we would like to announce the cancellation and automatic refunds of eFootball 2022 Premium Player Pack, which includes items that can only be used in-game after the v1.0.0 update.”
Konami says it has been working diligently towards distributing an update that will bring new content to the game, including a mode new to the series where players can “strengthen and play with an original team” and the mobile versions to the market. However, those mobile versions have seemingly been delayed indefinitely. 
“Unfortunately, we have concluded that more time is needed to deliver the product in the quality that will meet the expectations of our users and have decided to postpone the delivery,” the blog post reads. 
In the meantime, Konami ways it will release v0.9.1 to “fix numerous bugs sequentially on each platform” starting today, and that over time it will continue to improve and update eFootball 2022. Further updates and details about the mobile versions will come at a later date.

Call of Duty: Vanguard is a tale of three games. As is sometimes the case, several of the pillars lift up the package – and one brings it down. Vanguard’s campaign is weak, but multiplayer and zombies carry the title to victory. Let’s break down each experience.

One of the areas only talked about briefly in yesterday&#x27;s article were the UHD Graphics 770 found with these new desktop processors, due to time constraints with only having a few days so far for carrying out tests. Today the initial batch of UHD Graphics 770 / ADL-S GT1 Linux graphics/gaming benchmarks have wrapped up to show how the Intel graphics performance compares to prior generation Rocket Lake as well as AMD&#x27;s Ryzen 7 5700G.</span>

The reboot seems to have more of that good stuff, and this time around will be hosted by Robert Florence.

                    <span>Dnes Intel vydal již 12. generaci svých procesorů Core a názvem Alder Lake. Server Phoronix otestoval výkon procesorů Core i5 12600K a Core i9 12900K v Linuxu. Procesory mají hybridní architekturu s malými a velkými jádry. Velká jádra Golden Cove mají HT, kdežto malá jádra Gracemont ne. Procesor 12600K má 6 velkých a 4 malá jádra, dohromady 16 vláken a procesor 12900K má 8 velkých a 8 malých jader, dohromady 24 vláken. Nejzajímavější je porovnání s vlajkovou lodí AMD Ryzen 9 5950X, která má 16 HT jader a 32 vláken.</span>

Video games can elevate these head-scratching problems to new heights and complexities by immersing you in a setting, messing with concepts like the tenants of time and space, or by simply giving you endless access to your favorite brainteasers.

Gold-foil covers. Uniquely numbered issues. High-gloss pages. This is Game Informer Gold: The same video game magazine you know and love printed on ridiculously high-quality paper. We&#x27;ve been working on making this high-end variant for over a year and are finally ready to reveal it.
Each edition of Game Informer Gold is limited with a small print run. Much like prized comic books, each copy is bagged and boarded. You may even get a hand-written note from me in the box it&#x27;s shipped in.
We are auctioning off the first copy of Game Informer Gold during our 25-hour Extra Life Livestream on November 6. The auction begins at 4 p.m. CT and all money goes to Children&#x27;s Miracle Network Hospitals.
Want to get your hands on a copy? We plan to reveal more details about Game Informer Gold&#x27;s availability in the weeks and months ahead. Stay tuned to Game Informer&#x27;s social channels for that information.
I know you hear this often, but you need to get your hands on Game Informer Gold to truly understand how big of an upgrade it is. From its increased thickness to the gold shine on the cover, this is as high-end as magazines get.

In the months ahead, we plan on creating limited Gold editions for each issue. We may also reprint back issues with the Gold treatment. Here&#x27;s a cool twist: Some of these issues (new and old) could feature never-before-seen alternate artwork on the covers, perhaps from some of the world&#x27;s most celebrated artists.
We&#x27;re going to have some fun with Game Informer Gold, and we can&#x27;t wait for you to get your hands on an issue!</span>

                    <span>Spider-Man is finally arriving in Marvel’s Avengers later this month. Specifically, he&#x27;s coming to the PlayStation versions of the game – he’s an exclusive character, after all. But even non-PlayStation owners will be treated to a substantial update that adds a new Raid, power cap increase, and a perhaps friendlier method of unlocking cosmetics. 
November 30 is the big day that patch 2.2 hits the game. Spider-Man arrives in the Great Power Hero Event. The story centers on Peter Parker uncovering a mysterious threat and joining up with the Avengers to prevent AIM from procuring powerful technology. Although Spidey struggles with working as part of a team, he manages to form bonds with Ms. Marvel and Black Widow (despite insisting on maintaining his secret identity). The crux of the campaign…</span>

                    <span>Adorable 2009 platformer A Boy And His Blob hops over to Switch today. 
First released for the Wii, the game is a remake of the NES cult classic A Boy and His Blob: Trouble on Blobolonia. Players control the titular boy, with the help of his shape-shifting blob companion, to solve 2D platforming puzzles. Feeding the Blob jellybeans turns it into 15 different objects ranging from a parachute, anvil, or cannon. The game’s best feature: you can hug the Blob anytime.

A Boy and His Blob has since become a cult favorite in its own right. We scored the original Wii release an 8 out of 10. In her review, former GI editor Meagan Marie wrote that “...there is something undeniably magnetic about the game. The lush environments, charming characters, and the infinite power of the hug button make it impossible to stay upset for too long.” Over the last decade, it’s been ported to PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC, and mobile devices. 
You can purchase A Boy and His Blob for $14.99 on the Switch eShop. The port is being handled by Ziggurat Interactive, which is also gearing up to release enhanced versions of the BloodRayne games on consoles.</span>

                    <span>Take-Two Interactive has reportedly canceled a $53 million game that was being developed by Hangar 13. 
This news comes by way of Bloomberg, which reports that “people familiar with the decision” have learned that “further development of an unannounced title in its pipeline” has ended. Codenamed Volt, this game had reportedly gone through multiple iterations since first being conceived but ultimately, what led to its cancellation was the repeated “reboots, technological hiccups, and challenges caused by COVID-19,” Bloomberg reports. 
Volt’s development began in 2017, and it was set to be centered around various superheroes competing against each other. It would have featured an emphasis on online gameplay. 
“It was set to be a new intellectual property for Hangar 13, but 2K executives didn’t see it as a worthwhile investment because of the amount of time needed in development before it became a finished product,” Bloomberg’s report reads. 
There have been no layoffs as a result of this at the time of this writing, and Bloomberg reports that Hangar 13 employees will meet Thursday in Novata, California, where the studio is based, to discuss what happens next. 
Bloomberg writer Jason Schreier, who wrote this report, tweeted out additional details about the canceled project and those affected. He said Hangar 13 staff in California learned today via email that Volt was canceled, and he also noted that some non-US staff members learned of this news from his report. 
Schreier also said this canceled game was not Mafia 4, which some thought Hangar 13 was developing according to rumors. He said Mafia 4 rumors “were always false, aside from their early attempts in 2016-2017.”

                    <span>Halo has always had some great collector’s editions with each new release – looking at you, Master Chief helmet that came with Halo 3 – and Walmart sort of surprise announced a new one for Halo Infinite overnight. As expected, it sold out immediately. 
As far as special editions of Halo Infinite goes, there’s the Halo Infinite Xbox Series X bundle, the special steelbook that comes with preorders in select locations, and that’s about it. Before today, we hadn’t yet seen a special Halo Infinite edition that comes with what’s usually expected i.e. a statue of some kind, maybe some patches or stickers, and an art book. 
It seems Walmart had the lock on that because overnight, it released the Halo Infinite Collector’s Edition for $169.99. It sold out near immediately. It features the game, of course, a steelbook case (the same one being sold by other retailers), a set of five patches, a Plasma Pistol replica bottle opener, an Energy Sword desk lamp, two lanyards, a mini art book, a desktop portfolio, and a special developer note. 
According to Walmart, this edition was limited to just 10,000 units and now, it’s sold out. It’s unclear if more Collector’s Editions will be released. It’s also important to note that oddly enough, neither Microsoft nor Xbox have mentioned this edition yet. 
Perhaps it’s an unofficial one made by Walmart, although that would be odd considering it comes with some very official-looking merchandise. Maybe Walmart jumped the gun and released it early. All we know is that we’re very sad we were sleeping while this went live. 
For more about Halo Infinite, check out this story about Craig the Brute’s glow-up of the year and then read about how 343 Industries used Halo 3 and Halo Reach as inspiration for Infinite’s character and enemy design. Check out Game Informer’s breakdown of everything we know about Halo Infinite after that.

                    <span>FromSoftware showed off 15 minutes of Elden Ring gameplay this morning, and also revealed a pair of snazzy special editions at the presentation&#x27;s conclusion. Those who want more swag for their buck can pre-order these bad boys now. 
First up is the Collector’s Edition, which includes the following goodies:
Elden Ring game
Malenia – Blade of Miquella statue (23 cm)
Exclusive steelbook
40-page hardback artbook
Digital soundtrack
The Premium Collector’s Edition includes everything in the Collector’s Edition but tosses in a 1:1 replica of Malenia’s helmet, which may or may not be big enough to wear. Check it out below. 
The Collector’s Edition will set you back $189.99. The Premium Edition briefly appeared for $229.99 on Bandai Namco&#x27;s website but is a bit tough to track down right now. You&#x27;ll have to pre-order from retailers fast to grab one before they&#x27;re just a memory. You can try your luck at Best Buy, Target, and GameStop (disclaimer: GameStop is the parent company of Game Informer). 
Elden Ring releases February 25 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

                    <span>FromSoftware has released 15 minutes of Elden Ring gameplay and it features some of its open-world traversal in The Land Between, Souls-like combat, a healthy amount of death, and a look at some of the dungeons that await players within. 
The entire showcase heavily emphasizes player choice when navigating the world of Elden Ring. Unlike previous FromSoftware games which are more akin to wide-open, interconnected areas rather than a full-on open-world, Elden Ring’s world is completely open, allowing players to tackle objectives how they see fit.

                    <span>More Than 5 million copies of Grand Theft Auto V – you know, the game released nearly a decade ago – were sold just last quarter, bringing its total units sold up to a whopping 155 million units. 
This news comes by way of VentureBeat, which reports that the Rockstar-developed open-world game has generated more than $6 billion in revenue since its 2013 release. GTAV became the most profitable entertainment product of all time three years ago in 2018, as reported by GamesIndustry.biz, and it seems like the game has no plans to give up that title anytime soon. 
These new GTAV numbers come from Take-Two Interactive’s latest financial report, which details the second fiscal quarter’s earnings. That quarter ended on September 30. According to VentureBeat, the company beat not only Wall Street’s…</span>

                    <span>The classic and punishing Shin Megami Tensei franchise is back with a new mainline entry, and it’s full of everything we’ve come to expect from the series: challenging battles, intense demon negotiations, and philosophical conundrums about the state of the world. I’ve been playing Shin Megami Tensei V, already clocking close to 40 hours, but I haven’t reached the end to deliver my final verdict. Until then, I’ll say: Shin Megami Tensei sticks close to its roots – for better or worse. This means common series complaints, such as poor navigation and obtuse instructions, remain, but Atlus has also enhanced certain aspects, with more expansive areas, more skill customization, and stellar demon designs. If you’re an SMT fan, you should feel at home with the long, hard-fought journey that awaits…</span>

This news comes by way of Nintendo, which announced that Version 1.1.1 is out for Super Mario 3D All-Stars, which is the collection released last year that features Super Mario 64, Super Mario Sunshine, and Super Mario Galaxy. Before this new update, you could only play these three games using Joy-Con or the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller.

That’s still the case for Super Mario Sunshine and Super Mario Galaxy, but thanks to Version 1.1.1., you can now play Super Mario 64 with Nintendo’s recently-released 64 controller. Joy-Con and the Pro controller work fine in Super Mario 64, but for those looking for a more classic and nostalgic feel, using the 64 controller while playing is sure to fit their fancy. 
While waiting for the 64 controllers to be in stock again, check out why one of Game Informer’s editors thinks Super Mario 3D All-Stars is a great collection of remasters that doesn’t quite go far enough and then read about how Nintendo stopped selling this collection after March 31, 2021.

Dig was announced way back in August of 2019 as a new take on the massively popular Shovel Knight character. It still features the Shovel Knight millions have come to love over the years, but Dig drops the classic 2D platformer feel for a more unique style of gameplay that draws on titles like Mr. Driller and Dig Dug.

It’s no surprise the Switch is doing well – its sales haven’t really let up since the hybrid console hit the market in March of 2017. Still, it’s already one of Nintendo’s best-selling consoles and currently in fourth place in the company’s entire platform lineup. The latest numbers released by Nintendo today take all sales through September 30, 2021, into account and the Switch sits at 92.87 million units sold.

That number places the Switch far ahead of the NES, SNES, Nintendo 64, GameCube, Game Boy Advance, the 3DS, and the Wii U. In fact, the only four consoles ahead of it are the Wii at 101.63 million units sold…</span>

                    <span>Previous generations worried that humanity would be hurried towards its demise by nuclear war. My fear is that our destruction will be brought about by FIFA players opening Ultimate Team packs to &quot;earn&quot; NFTs. 

Yes, EA CEO Andrew Wilson followed in Ubisoft&#x27;s footsteps by saying that he thought NFTs and play-to-earn would be &quot;an important part of the future of our industry.&quot;

                    <span>Like many people, I became a plant guy during the pandemic. I don&#x27;t know the names of the plants, I don&#x27;t know what they need except sporadic watering and moderate light, but they&#x27;re green and I like them.

The Sims 4&#x27;s Blooming Rooms kit feels designed for me. It&#x27;s one of Maxis&#x27;s new micro-DLCs, and it lets you pack rooms with flora without the need to keep the alive through knowledge or effort.

That&#x27;s all of Riot&#x27;s games, in case you were wondering, which have previously been solely available on PC via their own launcher. At the same time, League Of Legends hero Jinx is hopping into Fortnite.

                    <span>Hey podcast fans. Mum’s away this week, which means the inmates have taken over the asylum once again. The temptation was to play another round of Sweeten The Deal, but instead Nate and I were good little podcast boys and delivered a surprisingly on point discussion of our favourite videogame adaptations of literary works. Well, I say ‘on point’; there’s a fair amount of discussion of new Dune, too, which is what got us thinking about successful book to screen journeys. Sadly, the House Atreides bagpipe band were not available for a rousing rendition of the podcast theme.
There’s also a micro Cavern of Lies in which things get biblical.

                    <span>A new update hit New World today, aimed partially at cracking down on gold sellers and exploits used to duplicate items and cash. Amazon say they&#x27;ve banned many players who were spamming chat advertising their illicit services. They also blasted a blog post talking about many of the issues concerning players, explaining things, detailing plans for fixes, and other welcome news.

                    <span>Want to know which are the best guns in Call Of Duty: Vanguard? Recent Call Of Duty games have among the most complex weapon meta of any FPS games, thanks both to the sheer number of weapons and the absurd number of attachments you can use to customise each gun. Call Of Duty: Vanguard continues this trend in a big way, with 27 primary and 9 secondary weapons that you can unlock, customise, and experiment with.
We fully expect Call Of Duty: Vanguard&#x27;s weapon meta to evolve quickly with future updates and balance patches, but at the moment there is definitely a top tier of guns which have risen above the rest in effectiveness. Below we&#x27;ll walk you through the very best guns in the game and how to get the most power out of each one.

                    <span>I’ll admit I misjudged Forza Horizon 5 – not just the extent to which I’d enjoy it, but how much its searingly shiny visuals could justify the significantly heightened PC requirements. Well, lock me in one of this game’s hundreds of boots and take me away, because it’s both tonnes of fun and genuinely, magnificently gorgeous. Here’s how Forza Horizon 5 runs on PC, and which settings to tweak if you want a performance boost without cutting too deep into that top-notch fidelity.

                    <span>From Software and Bandai Namco have treated us to a new Elden Ring gameplay trailer, which showed off 15 glorious minutes of exploration. All I wanted was one laugh and I got it, from a rotund POT-BOY at that. Plus, it was narrated by a guy who sounded suspiciously like SoulsTuber VaatiVidya as the Tarnished trotted and fought and summoned and stealthed. Undoubtedly a showstopper of a trailer, but the higlight for me was how good the action sounded. And boy, it sounded good didn&#x27;t it?

Bloodborne PSX turns FromSoft&#x27;s gothic action-RPG into a low-poly spookfest, complete with crackly old sound effects and 16-bit music.

                    <span>Darkest Dungeon 2, the sequel to Red Hook Studio&#x27;s gothic roguelike, is a somewhat familiar affair. It&#x27;s dark, it&#x27;s tough, and a narrator likes to remind you of those things frequently. But this time around, we&#x27;re leaving the Ancestor&#x27;s squalid hamlet behind, and swapping it out for a stress-fueled stagecoach. Heroes are no longer cannon-fodder to send out on doomed expeditions, but vital team members who have stories to share and relationships to forge. 


I recently talked with creative director Chris Bourassa and design director Tyler Sigman about why they decided to take the game in this new direction, the difficulties of switching to a relationship-based affliction system, and why they&#x27;re excited to be working in early access again.

Trade Skills are non-combat skills in New World — just about any activity your character takes part in that isn&#x27;t tied to their weapons is linked to a Trade Skill. There are 17 of these skills in all, separated into three sub-categories: Gathering, Refining, and Crafting.

                    <span>Lost Ark is a free-to-play action RPG-inspired MMO that came out to great acclaim in Korea back in 2018. Now, Amazon Games are bringing its flashy, Diablo-like combat to the west in the form of a closed beta later today, and we&#x27;ve had an early sneak peek at it. Of course, what with Amazon&#x27;s own MMO New World now settling into its third month, not to mention Final Fantasy 14&#x27;s Endwalker expansion looming on the horizon, Lost Ark arrives at a busy time for fervent EXP grinders. The big question, then, is whether Lost Ark’s Diablo-y formula can do enough to compete with the already well-established MMO juggernauts. Judging by my few hours of hands-on time, I’m thinking it might, but only if you’re able to embrace its slow burn.

For main course, folks who buy it within a week of launch will get the Ogre Kingdoms DLC for free. And for dessert, it will be in Xbox Game Pass For PC. A fair meal, there.

It will present you with some of your fave maps from the likes of Bad Company 2 and the Battlefields of old, then let you tweak them as much as you please by adding various vehicles, rules and more. I&#x27;m personally hoping to see plenty of oldies with 2042&#x27;s sweet new grappling hook thrown in. Every map could be improved by a grappling hook.

                    <span>By now you’ve probably heard about how Intel’s 12th Gen Alder Lake CPUs shake up the previously stagnant Core line. Led by this, the Intel Core i9-12900K, Alder Lake sees the adoption of a hybrid architecture that combines high-power Performance cores (P-cores) with Efficiency cores (E-cores) that can free up headroom by taking on background tasks. The Core i9-12900K takes this opportunity to bulk up, combining eight P-cores and E-cores apiece for a total of 16 cores and 24 threads.

                    <span>The Intel Core i5-12600K is, in some ways, the CPU that Intel should have made three or four years ago. Ever since AMD’s Ryzen chips appeared with an alluring balance of gaming speed, desktop multitasking performance, efficiency, and affordability, Intel seemed to sink into a comfort zone of simply raising clock speeds and maybe adding a few cores. 


This was often enough to earn some half-throated recommendations for gaming builds specifically, but this past year proved that something needed to change, with the AMD Ryzen 5 5600X claiming the best gaming CPU title and 11th Gen Rocket Lake Intel chips – like the 5600X’s rival Core i5-11600K – looking thoroughly skippable. For those who did decide to wait until the 12th Gen Alder Lake launch, consider yourselves vindicated, as the Core i5-12600K is a great all-rounder: both a Ryzen-beater in games and, thanks to a long-overdue architecture revamp, a drastically better general purpose processor.

                    <span>Last night, Take-Two Interactive&#x27;s quarterly earnings report mentioned a $53 million (£39 million) &quot;impairment charge&quot;, related to their decision to cease development on an unannounced project. According to a number of reports, that project was a third-person action game from Mafia 3 developers Hangar 13 that would&#x27;ve featured superheroes and online play.

After talking to the Worldmind in chapter 9, you will have the option to pay the Nova Corps fine that you incurred after escaping the Quarantine Zone and running into the Hala’s Hope in Chapter 2. Some decisions can have large and unexpected consequences in Guardians Of The Galaxy, so a bit of foresight is worth having if you want the best outcome when deciding whether to pay the Nova Corps fine or not.

                    <span>XCOM studio Firaxis have announced a delay for Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns, their turn-based tactics game in the BAM! BIF! POW! world of Marvel superheroes. Previously due in March 2022, it&#x27;s now pushed back into the second half of 2022. I say &quot;previously&quot;; the game was only announced two months ago. Sounds like someone had a serious rethink about the state of the project. But if it needs the time, it&#x27;s good that it&#x27;s getting the time.

After a rather disappointing attempt to capture a monster from the Quarantine Zone, the Guardians Of The Galaxy will incur a large fine from the Nova Corps. In a dire attempt to scrape together some units, you must travel to Seknarf Nine to meet Lady Hellbender, the Monster Queen. When you arrive, you must choose whether to sell Rocket or Groot. The choice you make majorly impacts the next mission of your adventure, so we’ll walk you through the differences between the two.

                    <span>EA Sports PGA Tour won’t be hitting the green next Spring as promised. EA has announced its upcoming return to golf will arrive at a later date. 
When exactly? That’s not entirely clear. EA Sports PGA Tour never had a concrete release date, but EA’s statement simply states its shifting the launch to a later time and that it will tell us more about it later. The full statement reads as follows:
Hey golf fans, we wanted to let you know that we are shifting the launch date of EA Sports PGA Tour. We’re excited to bring championship golf to you and will be providing more information on our launch plans in the coming months.

EA Sports PGA Tour represents the publisher’s comeback to golf after a years-long hiatus. The game already boasts exclusive rights to the Master’s Tournament and features the PGA Championship, U.S. Open Championship, and The Open Championship. The game will also highlight the Ladies Professional Golf Association (LPGA) and feature one of their respective tournaments, the Amundi Evian Championship.
In other recent delay news, Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns was pushed to the back half of 2022, Platinum Games&#x27; arcade shooter Sol Cresta will now launch next year, and both Overwatch 2 and Diablo IV may not arrive until 2023 at the earliest.

                    <span>One of the most exciting things that can happen in gaming is the announcement of that sequel or spiritual successor you’ve been begging for. There’s no shortage of those kinds of announcements these days, but sometimes those announcements can feel like mistakes, particularly when a game is nowhere near ready. 
Sure, the hype is exciting, but there’s no real purpose to announcing a game years and years ahead of time other than marketing, of course. If a game enters what’s informally known as development hell, that announcement can sting a lot, both for the studio behind it and the fans excited about it.

                    <span>Square Enix has released its annual report for its 2021 fiscal year, which reflected on the games released during the initial months of the COVID pandemic. Marvel&#x27;s Avengers is revealed in the report to be considered &quot;not proven successful,&quot; though lessons were learned from the project.
Taking on a Games as a Service (or GaaS) model, Marvel&#x27;s Avengers was described as an &quot;ambitious title&quot; for Square Enix. The complications that come with planning for the long tail of a service-focused title with the shift to developers working from home compounded the challenges. &quot;We were able to surmount these challenges and release the game, but it has unfortunately not proven as successful as we would have liked,&quot; says Square Enix President Yosuke Matsuda in the report.

                    <span>Firaxis has announced that its superhero strategy game, Marvel’s Midnight Suns, won’t make its March release window. The game requires some more polish, so it will instead launch during the back half of 2022. A more exact date was not provided.
The studio tweeted a statement by creative director Jake Solomon explaining the delay. Simply put, the game needs more time in the oven to come together, and four months from now won’t be enough. “These extra months will be used to add more story, cinematics, and overall polish and will be essential in helping us make our vision a reality,” reads Solomon’s statement. You can read the full announcement in the tweet below.
We have an important development update to share with our fans pic.twitter.com/ycNDCVtbwD
November 3, 2021
Marvel’s Midnight Suns blends turn-based and deck-building gameplay with a story based on the ‘90s Midnight Sons story and team. Players control The Hunter, an original hero created by Marvel and Firaxis, who leads a team consisting of Doctor Strange, Blade, Captain America, Wolverine, Magik, and others against the evil Lilith. We recently featured it on the cover of Game Informer, and you can read deep-dive articles breaking down every facet of the game’s features and development in our coverage hub.
When it does launch, Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.</span>

                    <span>Want to know whether you should buy the Disabler in Guardians Of The Galaxy? Whilst on Knowhere during Chapter 6, you can look around and partake in a bit of shopping. Whilst looking between the various stalls, you will find a merchant who offers to sell you a disabler that will supposedly remove the Nova Corps tracker from your ship. This would mean you don’t need to pay the Nova Corps fine that you incurred earlier in Chapter 2. However, Knowhere is a seedy place, and it’s hard to be certain whether you might get conned.
This guide will explain whether you should buy the disabler on Knowhere in Guardians Of The Galaxy, so that you can avoid any scams.

                    <span>Inscryption is good, very good. I mean, we&#x27;ve slapped a Bestest Best badge on it, like one of its in-game sigils. What effect does it have? Play the game and you&#x27;ll quickly realise it does things games aren&#x27;t supposed to do. Most notably, for me at least, Inscryption makes me feel like I&#x27;m actually playing a proper card game; that feeling of being present at a table, slapping cards down on its hard surface. I hadn&#x27;t realised how crucial this was to my enjoyment of CCGs, until now.

                    <span>Reader dear, I have to ask: do you try to get 100% collectables in games? Someone must, because games still have them. But I certainly don&#x27;t, and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve spoken about the subject with anyone who does. So, seeing as Psychonauts 2 has now released a patch with new features to help players collect every little doodad and tick off achievements, I want to ask: do you do this? Will you? Please tell me about it!

                    <span>Want to learn how to create the best Thoma build in Genshin Impact? As the chief retainer of Inazuma’s Kamisato Clan, Mondstadt native Thoma is always down to lend a helping hand, even aiding the player in their arrival to Inazuma. It makes sense, then, that he’s a support and sub-DPS character similar to Zhongli.

Despite her timid personality, Anemo Catalyst user Sucrose is definitely not afraid to use her alchemical abilities in battle and serves as a 4-star substitute for 5-star Anemo characters like Venti and Kazuha — essentially, she’s a sub-DPS great at crowd control and applying the Swirl reaction.

                    <span>You&#x27;d think being 1000 years old would earn you some respect, but in Demon Turf, that means you&#x27;re still a child. Admittedly, it makes for an intriguing premise in this tale of conquest and demonic shakedowns, but don&#x27;t be fooled. While its core systems take inspiration from 3D platformers of the N64 era, Demon Turf isn’t another Banjo Kazooie successor like publisher Playtonic&#x27;s Yooka-Laylee. You’ll find those familiar cliches, sure, but there’s something great about Fabraz’s latest effort that goes beyond its unique visuals.

Blizzard had never stated a release date for either game anyway, we only had a vague hint that they didn&#x27;t expect to launch them in 2021. Now, maybe 2023 at earliest?

                    <span>Jen Oneal is stepping down as co-lead of Blizzard Entertainment, just three months after she took the position. Since J. Allen Brack left the company in August, Oneal had been in charge of the studio with Mike Ybarra, who&#x27;ll now take the lead on his own. Oneal claims she&#x27;s not leaving because she&#x27;s &quot;without hope for Blizzard&quot;, but wants to &quot;do more to have games and diversity intersect, and hopefully make a broader industry impact that will benefit Blizzard (and other studios) as well.&quot;

                    <span>Card games are all the rage these days, so much so that even Yoko Taro of Nier: Automata fame is getting in on the action. Alas, if you’re expecting a similarly galaxy brain take on tabletop RPGs here, you’re going to be disappointed. Despite the creative minds behind it (Automata’s producer Yosuke Saito and composer Keiichi Okabe are also on board), Voice Of Cards: The Isle Dragon Roars is a decidedly simple role playing affair where its titular cards are nothing more than a fancy visual layer papering over a by-the-book tale of dungeons and, yes, a dragon. Inscryption this ain’t.

It was the &quot;Puppy Channel&quot;. A 24/7 broadcast of nothing but puppies. 

At the time, no cable provider liked the idea enough to make it happen, but I think about the story a lot. I think about it on days like today, on which Twitch has just introduced a new &quot;Animals, Aquariums, and Zoos&quot; category to the livestreaming platform.

                    <span>&quot;Storm Point. It&#x27;s a place where dreams come true,&quot; says a character at the end of Apex Legends&#x27; Escape mode trailer. Given the two preceding minutes, presumably the dreams have to involve being fired into the sky and then stabbing a bunch of dudes.

Apex Legends&#x27; new season, including Storm Point map and new character Ash, are all live now.

                    <span>Marvel&#x27;s Avengers came to Xbox Game Pass at the end of September. A week later, Square Enix added paid, consumable XP boosters to its in-game store, to much predictable uproar from its players.

Today, Square Enix announced that they were removing the boosters, while apologising &quot;for not responding sooner&quot; to players&#x27; concerns.

                    <span>Activision have squirted out another Call Of Duty: Vanguard trailer, but the drippings are more specifically relevant to us this time. It&#x27;s the game&#x27;s &quot;PC trailer&quot;, and it appears alongside a blog post offering more detail on download sizes, specs and so on.

Finally, the big&#x27;un has arrived: Minecraft. Both the original Java and cross-platform Bedrock versions of Minecraft arrived on Microsoft&#x27;s subscription service today, packaged into a unified launcher. This comes ahead of plans to give all PC Minecrafters access to both versions next year.

                    <span>In true Shadow Tactics fashion, here’s an expansion no one saw coming. Aiko’s Choice is a miniature campaign extension to 2016’s real-time tactics wonder. A standalone title, but one that slots into the original game’s main story. It feels like a DLC package that should have been released closer to the original, but I’m not going to drag developers Mimimi for tardiness - after all, this is a game where it takes me upwards of three hours to creep around a single map. Nothing about Shadow Tactics is rushed.

                    <span>Riders Republic is a multiplayer open world sports game developed by Ubisoft Annecy, in which every single character talks like they’re your mum’s new boyfriend after they find a bong in your sock drawer. And, hey, like, we get it, y’know, we all like to “hang loose” on Tik Tok sometimes, but – at this point Gareth the 43-year-old divorcé grabs a chair, spins it 180 degrees and sits on it in one smooth motion – dope just isn’t on fleek, fam.
Insufferable cutscenes aside, this is a thrilling downhill racing simulator in which you, a new arrival to a vast landscape of snowy peaks, scorched desert badlands, towering forests and rain-lashed mud flats, must repeatedly hurl yourself down the side of a mountain faster or more stylishly than your opponents. The world is a compressed version of California with all of the San Franciscos taken out, leaving just a bizarre population of baggy jeans wearing Urban Dictionary acolytes, and a vast interconnected series of freely roamable tracks and wilderness littered with activities to complete and landmarks to discover.

                    <span>When I first heard about it, I didn&#x27;t think Unpacking would appeal to me. Released today, it&#x27;s a chill game about unpacking moving boxes, unloading all the items from someone&#x27;s life into their new home. I&#x27;ve never liked unpacking in real life, it feels stressful and annoying trying to find space for all my stuff. But I&#x27;m starting to think that Unpacking (the game) might make me feel better about it. Perhaps next time I move house, I should go into it with the energy of this relaxed puzzler.

                    <span>While Crusader Kings 3 is a great simulation of medieval political jostling, when this degenerate into war, it lacks a little pizzaz. Enter Crusader Blade, a new mod which lets you fight CK3 battles inside Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord. When it&#x27;s time to rumble in CK3, it&#x27;ll generate a Bannerlord battle based on your armies for you to fight in-person, then transfer the results back into CK3. Immensely impressive.

It&#x27;s about opening a chocolate shop staffed by ghosts, and you&#x27;ll be able to venture out into fantastical places to collect ingredients. Honestly, it&#x27;s exactly what I&#x27;d want from a Stardew follow-up. Barone says Haunted Chocolatier will have &quot;a greater focus on combat&quot; than Stardew, and has provided some detail on how the chocolate game&#x27;s battles will work.

                    <span>Like anyone, I went into Echo Generation knowing it would be riding on Stranger Things’ coattails. With its young cast and retro, small town setting, this is a game that definitely falls into that familiar “gang of boys plus maybe someone’s girlfriend going on an occult adventure” vein of 80s nostalgia fests like The Goonies and It. But the question was, would it be an inspired homage to the Upside Down, or a cash grab with a voxel paint job designed to lure in &#x27;the youth&#x27;? The answer, sadly, is neither.

This guide will cover where to get every outfit in Guardians Of The Galaxy, so that you can relax and enjoy the story whilst knowing that you won&#x27;t miss any costumes. You won&#x27;t find outfits in every chapter, so don&#x27;t panic when you notice some are missing. Below, we&#x27;ve listed every chapter in which you can find outfits.
