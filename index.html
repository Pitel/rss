                              <span>The Kraken Pool might be the last location you can access on Fisch&#x27;s Atlantis Island, but it can be the most valuable one to visit.


You&#x27;ll have to gain access to all other regions of Atlantis before you can enter the Kraken Pool. Like all other regions, you&#x27;ll need to solve certain puzzles to enter the Pool. Doing so is pretty important if you want to get the Kraken Rod, and catch the Kraken.


How to unlock Kraken Pool in Fisch


To gain access to Kraken Pool, you&#x27;ll have to solve the Mythological Clock Wheel puzzle across different regions. You&#x27;ll find the clocks in different locations, including one at Kraken Pool, and each has a unique solution.


All Mythological Clock Wheel solutions in Fisch


You&#x27;ll find the Mythological Clocks at the following locations: Sunken Depths, Ethereal Abyss, Poseidon Temple, and Zeus Trial (before coming across the final one at Kraken Pool). Here&#x27;s the solution for all the puzzles. You&#x27;ll have to select the correct choice at every region to solve the complete Clock Wheel puzzle.



Sunken Depths (-4606, -594, 1843): Blue Harp


Ethereal Abyss (-4107, -603, 1823): Orange Helmet


Poseidon Temple (-4299, -604, 1587): Black Scythe


Zeus Trial (-4295, -583, 2021): Purple Moon


Kraken Pool (-4295, -991, 1792): Red Spear



Once you solve the final Clock Wheel puzzle, the door will open, giving you access to Kraken Pool.




How to get the Kraken Rod in Fisch


Once you gain access, you&#x27;ll find the fishing location, which is the only place you can find the Kraken. You can also purchase the Kraken Rod from this location. It&#x27;s certainly one of the best rods that have been added to Fisch, and you can buy it for C$1,333,333. Credits-wise, it&#x27;s the third-most expensive rod to get as part of the Atlantis update.

                              <span>The Atlantis update has introduced a brand new location in Fisch, and it&#x27;s slightly tricky to enter in the first place.


For starters, the new location is blocked by Atlantis&#x27; door, which has to be blown up with TNT. You&#x27;ll need to use the TNT to reach Zeus&#x27; Heart, which is required to enter Atlantis. Let&#x27;s take a look at all five Forsaken Shore locations, which will allow you to spawn TNT and essentially grant you access to Atlantis.


All Forsaken Shore Lever locations in Fisch


The Forsaken Shore Island is host to all five levers, but they&#x27;re spread across different locations. Here&#x27;s how you can find all of them on the island.


Lever
GPS
Location




Lever 1
-2252, 140, 1591
The first one can be found next to the Merchant. The lever is located on the wall to the right of where the Merchant is standing.


Lever 2
-2568, 149, 1644
This lever can be found near the Forsaken Skin merchant. There&#x27;s a stone wall located behind him, and the lever is attached to it. 


Lever 3
-2837, 132, 1508
The third one is located at the Waterfall. Go through it, and you&#x27;ll find the lever. 


Lever 4
-2729, 169, 1730
The fourth one is attached to a wooden bridge on top of the Forsaken Shores mountains. 


Lever 5
-2282, 316, 1607
To find the fifth one, you&#x27;ll have to go to the leaderboard next to the river. 






After you pull all five levers, go to the Atlantis area in the Grand Reef location. The location is close to where the Pirate NPC is located. Once you blast the door using TNT, you&#x27;ll be able to teleport to the new Atlantis Island.


You&#x27;ll have 59 different fishes to catch in this region. Additionally, you can also add up to seven new rods to add to your collection. The place is also home to several puzzles like the Clock Wheel puzzle, which will test your wits thoroughly.

McCarthy&#x27;s unique prose, often described as sparse and lyrical, combined with his natural aptitude for immersive worldbuilding and nuanced characterization, have turned him into one of the greatest novelists of all time. But, of course, you probably already knew that, so let&#x27;s get into the gritty, blood-soaked world of unlikely protagonists and unlikely places, overviewing the man&#x27;s bibliography and trying to rank these unforgiving, timeless fictional tales; tales where man and nature collide in their most stripped down form.

What does that mean for the Steam Deck and its ilk, though?


At face value, it shouldn&#x27;t mean diddly squat. The Deck, the ROG Ally, the Legion Go... these devices aren&#x27;t consoles as such: they&#x27;re handheld gaming PCs and laptops from a mechanical and functional point of view. Even the most popular of them all, the Steam Deck, doesn&#x27;t come even close to competing with Nintendo&#x27;s flagship device.

The US has had three presidents (four if you count the current returning one), the UK has had six leaders take up the mantel of Prime Minster, and Marvel has released about 30 films in its MCU money printing franchise. Also, Skyrim has been launched and relaunched many times, depending on if you count each individual console port.

As reported by PCGamesN, Tom Warren over on The Verge says 2025 looks like it could be a great year for Xbox. After the recent Developer Direct announcements – chief among them being Doom: The Dark Ages&#x27; release date – it&#x27;s been suggested that an official remaster of The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion could arrive &quot;late spring or early summer&quot; of this year.




It should be noted that Warren specifically refers to it as a remaster rather than a remake. Of course, exp…</span>

Whether those books are set in locations that don’t interest them or in a genre that doesn’t float their boat, not every book can please every reader. However, some books are widely hated more than others, and for good reason. 


I’m talking about those books that instantly spring to mind as something you should never recommend to anyone looking for something to read. Books that, sure, stick with you, but for all the wrong reasons. Whether it’s terrible writing, a plot that borders and sometimes crosses over into nonsensical, or simply a focus on something terrible. These books are at the bottom of the reading pile for a lot of people.

The first was written by Cressida Cowell back in 2004, and the world she created has since spawned an entire franchise. 


So far, there are:



12 mainline books


3 related companion books


1 children&#x27;s picture book


12 graphic novels


3 animated movies


5 animated TV series


6 animated shorts



And all of that is without counting the upcoming live action adaptation of How to Train Your Dragon that’s coming in June 2025. I know, it&#x27;s a lot.

At its core, Project Pantheon mashes together two popular genres: Action RPG and PvPvE Extraction. Or, as the team liked to put it, ExtrAction RPG. Players will have their own Sanctuary, essentially a base of operations that they can customize and upgrade as well as manage their loadout, akin to that in other Extraction-base games like Escape from Tarkov.

                              <span>Fortnite is no stranger to anime crossover events, with the likes of Dragon Ball Super, Attack on Titan, and Jujutsu Kaisen. Now, we&#x27;re getting yet another anime debut with the Kaiju No. 8 x Fortnite collab. 


Here&#x27;s what you can expect with this crossover, including when it will discontinue, skins, and weapons.


How long will the Kaiju No. 8 bundle be available in Fortnite?


The Kaiju No. 8 bundle is available for 3,800 V-Bucks. You&#x27;ll likely spend $36.99 to gain the 5,000 V-Bucks bundle in the store, which should be more than enough to cover the pack. You can also get them individually if you favor a particular item or character. According to the shop page, the bundle will be available to purchase until Jan. 31, 2025, at 4 p.m. local time.

                              <span>Regarding Call of Duty, it&#x27;s easy to argue that Black Ops is perhaps the most beloved and popular series in the franchise&#x27;s history. Now that Black Ops 6 has been released, I&#x27;ve looked through the last 17 years to rank every Treyarch-developed game from worst to best. 


It&#x27;s a testament to the quality of the Black Ops series that Treyarch is widely viewed as the best Call of Duty developer, which made ranking the seven mainline entries difficult. A dev team rarely has no absolute stinkers in their library, but Treyarch has never made a bad CoD game, at least in my opinion. 


However, this is an article to rank them all, so I couldn&#x27;t sit on the fence and say that they&#x27;re all great, which is why we&#x27;re ranking all Black Ops games in order. For this list, we&#x27;ve included Call of Duty: World …</span>

If you&#x27;ve played a handful of video games, chances are you&#x27;ve lost yourself in the side content more often than the main game.
Sidequests are a procrastinator&#x27;s dream. Don&#x27;t want to finish the main story? Worried about missing some fantastic rewards or lore dumps? Well, thank goodness there are tons of people across the world that need help rescuing their pets, doing their shopping, or trying to tell their neighbour that they&#x27;re in love with them.

Stardew Valley is perhaps one of the best-supported indie games of all-time with Eric &#x27;ConcernedApe&#x27; Barone now working on the title for over 12 years. While there have been questions raised about the farming and lifestyle sim&#x27;s future now that the creator&#x27;s attention has (mostly) shifted to his new project, what is the actual plan?
Speaking to NPR, Barone mentioned how he doesn&#x27;t want to &quot;definitively say that the book is ever closed&quot; on Stardew because he might one day &quot;have a desire to come back and maybe add a thing or two&quot;:

The Taito Milestones series has already witnessed two collections (the &#x27;3&#x27; at the end of the Taito Milestones 3 is a bit of a giveaway), but the odd thing with this series is that the quality has arguably improved with each offering, rather than diminishing as the best games are featured early on.
As we noted with the first Taito Milestones, the selection was somewhat disappointing, but it improved with the second release, which boasts the likes of The NewZealand Story, Metal Black, and Darius II.

This week might not have brought us the Switch 2 bonanza that dominated the last, but there was still plenty to talk about in the world of Nintendo.
We got a teeny, tiny development update from the Silksong team (turns out, the game is still real) and chatted all things space with Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector developer Jump Over The Age. We also wrapped up the Switch 2 aftershocks with reactions to the new Donkey Kong design and various companies&#x27; expected launch windows, and got all excited about next week&#x27;s Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket updates.

Při spouštění hry se na obrazovce zobrazil &quot;rozsypaný čaj&quot; a pro pokračování jej uživatel musel dekódovat, tj. musel se na něj podívat přes čočky LENSLOKu, přečíst dvě písmena a ty napsat na klávesnici.</span>

Poppy


Poppy is a balanced character that is immediately available when you start Dandy&#x27;s World. She does not have any clear specialization, but due to her stats, we would recommend using Poppy mainly as a survivalist.

Attributes in Arknights: Endfield function similarly to stats in other RPGs, but they come with added complexity. There are four of them in total, each offering unique benefits to your characters.



Strength – Increases a character&#x27;s Maximum Health pool. 


Agility – Increases a character&#x27;s Physical Damage Reduction, meaning non-elemental attacks will deal less damage.


Intellect – Increases a character&#x27;s Arts Damage Reduction, meaning special abilities will deal less damage.

First, it was added to the game and now it is not working. Why is the Hex of Whispers not working in season 7? Let&#x27;s find out what&#x27;s going on and what you can do to fix it.


Why is Hex of Whispers not working?


This new Witchcraft power that made its debut just a few weeks ago, launched along with the original Season 7 drop, has been indeed deactivated. With the 2.0.1 hotfix, released the day after the launch of the new Season, on January 22, Blizzard confirmed that the power has been removed because it is &quot;causing stability issues&quot;. Naturally, the development team is working to bring it back and fix any of the issues it was causing.

                              <span>If you&#x27;ve played any other gacha games or JRPGs, there&#x27;s a high chance you&#x27;ve seen the Trust system in some variety before. Even so, Arknights: Endfield puts its own unique spin on the mechanic, so here&#x27;s everything you need to take advantage of it.


How does Trust work in Arknights: Endfield?


In Arknights: Endfield, Trust is a unique leveling mechanic, separate from the standard one, that applies to all playable characters except for the main character, the Endminstrator. It serves as the chief mechanic for unlocking information about the personalities and backstories of your characters, offering insight into who they are as individuals. If you enjoy exploring the lore and backend info about the characters you own, then leveling up Trust is already a worthwhile venture for you.

Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition is coming to Switch on 20th March and its release marks the arrival of one of the most anticipated Wii U ports on Nintendo&#x27;s hybrid console.
The series has gone from strength to strength on Switch, with XC2 and XC3 bringing new fans into the Xenoblade fold as well as wowing critics. The arrival of this one completes the set on Switch, but this is so much more than an also-ran - we&#x27;re incredibly excited to see XCX get the Definitive Edition treatment!

Late last year, it was reported that several PlatinumGames veterans had seemingly left the studio. While only Bayonetta Origins&#x27; Abebe Tinari confirmed this news, it looks increasingly likely that Astral Chain director Takahisa Taura has followed suit, potentially forming a new company in the process (thanks, Nintendo Everything).
Initial rumours about Taura&#x27;s PlatinumGames departure arose after the director (alongside several other Platinum vets) removed all mention of the studio from his social media bios. Adding fuel to the fire, one fan on Twitter noted that Taura&#x27;s Facebook profile has been updated with a new place of work: Eel Game Studio.

Every so often a game comes along that makes you take your thumb off the fire button and don your thinking cap. But who wants to have to spend a lot of time thinking just to get through a game, you say?

EA&#x27;s share price has taken a bit of a tumble after the publisher announced it woud be revising its financial outlook following disappointing sales of EA Sports FC 25 and Dragon Age: The Veilguard.
In just a single day, the company&#x27;s share price dropped by more than 16% from 142.35 USD to 118.58 USD. Things are levelling out somewhat at the time of writing, but it certainly marks one of the most volatile downturns in the company&#x27;s history.

It has been roughly three months since Sonic X Shadow Generations arrived on Switch, and while the release was (fittingly) quick out the gate, shifting one million copies in its opening weekend, SEGA&#x27;s latest sales update shows that it&#x27;s still got some life left in it.
Shared in a press release on the SEGA website, the company announced that Sonic X Shadow Generations has since sped past two million sales — accounting for both physical and digital downloads. This total combines unit sales across all platforms, though we&#x27;d assume that Switch players have made up a healthy portion of the updated total if the UK charts breakdowns are anything to go by.

Nintendo has released its first Switch Online game update for 2025 and it adds three more titles to the SNES library including a Super Famicom release.
These titles include the SNK fighting game Fatal Fury 2 (1993/94), Culture Brain&#x27;s action RPG Super Ninja Boy (1992), and the action-puzzle title Sutte Hakkun (1997) - a Nintendo title originally released on the Super Famicom add-on, the Satellaview.

As we enter 2025, Koei Tecmo’s Team Ninja (known for its work on series like Ninja Gaiden and Dead or Alive) has acknowledged its 30th anniversary.
In 4Gamer.net’s round up on Japanese developer’s 2025 ambitions, Team Ninja’s Fumihiko Yasuda mentioned how the team hoped to release titles “fitting for the occasion”. Here’s exactly what he had to say:

Doom: The Dark Ages launches on May 15 for PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5—unless you’re eyeing one of the pricier editions, which grant early access starting May 13. Naturally, our attention is on the PC edition and, of course, where to get it for the best price.

                              <span>My favourite genre of YouTuber is: &quot;person who hyperfixates on one mundane detail of a blockbuster video game and gets strangely poetic about it&quot;.  When you offer me a five-hour video essay about an obscure adventure game from 1998, I will hide in the closet. But if you idly wonder where the rivers in Skyrim go, I will follow along dutifully like a baby elephant. This is how I ended up spending much of my afternoon watching David Cage characters pissing. One video creator decided to painstakingly count every instance of playable pee time in cinematic adventure game Heavy Rain. This is vital work. This is important work.

                              <span>A performance and settings guide for a ropey PC port of a Final Fantasy game? Sweet, I haven’t done one of these in four whole months. In fairness to Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, which Nic says can be great as a game per se, it does make some effort at settling into Windows. It has rebindable M+K controls. It has DLSS. It has generally more consistent framerates than FFXVI, which could bait you in with silky visuals before grabbing your head and shoving it into the cold ice bath of sub-30fps.
Yet it also steps back from that game on its supported tech, while raising its hardware requirements so far above Final Fantasy 7 Remake that it won’t even launch on a lot of older graphics cards. Even so, hitching and microstuttering issues from FF7 Remake return once more, along with plenty of other signs that this PC version didn’t get the love that a lot of other erstwhile PlayStation exclusives – like Horizon Forbidden West or God of War Ragnarök – did for their ports.

                              <span>If you turn 33 years old in the next couple of months then, sorry, you are dead. I don&#x27;t make the rules, that&#x27;s just how Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 explains the lack of elders in its very French yet very JRPG world. The fantasy game will see you journey across a dangerous landscape to stop the mad &quot;paintress&quot; who&#x27;s magically culling humanity at younger and younger ages every year. We&#x27;ve been keeping a weary middle-aged eye on its development, and yesterday it got a release date. It&#x27;s too late for most of us in the RPS treehouse. But watch the trailer for yourself, maybe you&#x27;ll make it.

                              <span>How many times can video games riff on that one Dr Who episode with the weeping statues? At least once more. Surgeon Simulator devs Bossa have just announced Don&#x27;t Get Got, in which you and up to seven of your so-called friends are trapped in a large school with randomised objectives and safe rooms. Also in the school: a bunch of horrifying little boys in shorts and braces.


It&#x27;s out in early access today. Yes, they&#x27;ve sprung this one on us like a ghastly Jack-in-the-box. Steady your nerves and watch the trailer.

                              <span>Good news for anyone eager to meet a big talking catfish. A new trailer for action adventure game South Of Midnight sees players battering monsters from the folklore of the US&#x27; Deep South. It shows hero Hazel arguing with her mum before a supernatural hurricane cuts off the family drama and sends Hazel wandering the swamps to encounter giant alligators, giant fish, giant dolls, and giant people. Maybe Hazel is just very small. Either way, it also dangles an important morsel in front of our snapping jaws: a release date. Come see.

                              <span>City of London Police formed the Police Intellectual Property Crime Unit over a decade ago. Since then, the specialist anti-piracy unit has targeted pirates of all kinds. The Intellectual Property Office&#x27;s latest Report and Accounts states that PIPCU is funded using millions of pounds from &#x27;IPO surpluses.&#x27; That money appears to have been put to work; PIPCU reports reveal successes against large-scale IPTV pirates and in one case, a record-breaking restraint of ill-gotten gains.

It&#x27;s out right now on Steam and Microsoft&#x27;s Game Pass service. I&#x27;d say it has materialised from the darkness like a ninja, but there are a lot of ninjas in circulation at the minute, and my analogy-jitsu gauge is running dry. So instead, I&#x27;m going to say that it has materialised from the darkness like a resurfacing duck, its beak stuffed with pond vegetation. The pond vegetation, here, stands for &quot;tweaks to the weapons upgrade system&quot;. Here&#x27;s a trailer.

                              <span>We called Amplitude&#x27;s fiendish and fanciful strategy game Endless Legend the best 4X of 2014, and its hexcellence hasn&#x27;t dimmed with age. &quot;The music, the amazing variety in terrain and units, the sheer quantity of words bringing to life every last quest, minor faction, creature, and environmental anomaly,&quot; breathed a reverential Ollie in 2023. &quot;It&#x27;s a simply splendid game.&quot; Like somebody commenting on the sturdiness of an original Picasso&#x27;s frame, I will only add that it now runs pretty comfortably on the current least expensive Dell Thinkpad.
Why in Meier&#x27;s name would Sega choose to sell off the studio behind such a worldly wonder? The answer is lost in time (it&#x27;s through that link, there), but fortunately, Amplitude endure as an independent - and they&#x27;ve just announced Endless Legend 2 with no less than Hooded Horse as publisher. Here&#x27;s the announcement trailer.

I get all excited about sharing details from a preview event for upcoming FPS Doom: The Dark Ages, then it turns out the gameplay reveal video is going public before the embargo anyway. Then the alleged release date allegedly leaks, allegedly. How am I supposed to present myself as a font of knowledge now, Id? Fortunately, we had a roundtable interview afterward with executive producer Marty Stratton and game director Hugo Martin. Sweet, job-justifying details!
Writing up the interview in full would involve typing out the words &quot;awesome&quot;, &quot;slaughter&quot;, &quot;core pillars&quot;, and &quot;iPod&quot; more times than anyone realistically needs to read. Instead, here&#x27;s a list of every detail I found interesting that isn&#x27;t already covered in the showcase.

It was an &quot;I&#x27;m Spartacus&quot;-ass day of press releases, culminating in the announcement of a project from former ZA/UM writers Argo Tuulik and Olga Moskvina.
Before that came sci-fi RPG XXX Nightshift, and before that was an unnamed &quot;psychogeographic RPG&quot; from newly formed Longdue.

                              <span>Assassin&#x27;s Creed Shadows has a lot riding on it. Between its multiple release date delays in response to Star Wars Outlaws not selling as well as Ubisoft would&#x27;ve liked, and Ubi potentially being bought by Tencent as they clamour for help, there&#x27;s a sense that Shadows needs to deliver not only a great game, but corporate redemption.
I&#x27;ve now played Shadows for four hours, having dipped into a bit of prologue action, some open world exploration, and a questline as both the hulking Yasuke and the lithe Naoe. Have Ubi delivered? I think there&#x27;s a strong chance. What I played was a lot of comforting Creeding, carried along by a gorgeous interpretation of Edo Japan, and some subtle tweaks to up stealth stakes. Although I do think the two protagonists are a split personality that doesn&#x27;t quite work for me.

                              <span>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is billed as a faithful recreation of 15th century Bohemia, with an open world setting derived from primary sources and historical consultancy that seeks to &quot;challenge misconceptions&quot;, but I&#x27;m enjoying it partly for the inconsistencies. As I amble into a random village, my eye is caught by what feel like carefully observed period flourishes: a particular arrangement of crops in a sloping field, a woman praying at a shrine by the gate. Some of these sights and sounds unlock codex entries, layering up the pedagogic texture.

                              <span>Few games place me so betwixt the yin and yang of frustration and flow state as Snow Riders. Here is a compact selection of ski slopes, each one yodeling the promise of my smooth and exhilarating descent over fresh powder. But wait, someone has littered this Ski Sunday with obstacles, forcing me to run a gauntlet of trees, rocks and rivers. I am thrust headlong into each of these obstacles a dozen times before my withered synapses and tired bones internalise these arboreal teachings and I make it safely to the bottom.

As in life, there is joy to be found in this journey precisely because it is hard. Unlike in life, the camera is often facing backwards while you do it.

The game represents perhaps the most cavernous, yawping blind spot in my entire pile of shame. I do own it, but I&#x27;m yet to play. I&#x27;ve already read a great deal of extended wordery on its merits - please, sell it to me in the comments in seven words or less. Here&#x27;s a trailer:

                              <span>Readers, I have spent two full days in the benchmark pits to tell you what you&#x27;ve already guessed: the GeForce RTX 5090 is very fast, too expensive, and laden with more AI tech than Philip K. Dick’s cheese dreams. At least two of those points will, I’m sure, send the average graphics card shopper running, especially at a time when even game developers are growing suspicious of generative AI and its many-thumbed, robot-voiced nostrums.
Yet while there’s not much to be done about the RTX 5090 costing at minimum £1939 / $1999, hundreds more than the infamously spenny RTX 4090, its suite of more purely performance-focused artificial intelligence tools is – dare I say it – quite neat. These range from Multi Frame Generation (MFG), which is basically DLSS 3 frame gen but up to twice as fast, to DLSS 4’s general upscaling enhancements and even the ability to apply newer DLSS versions to older games. All this will come to the rest of the RTX 50 series as well, with some trickling down to the enter RTX range, so maybe the RTX 5090 is best understood not as a practical GPU purchase in itself but as a Picadilly Square-filling advert for its more affordable siblings can do.

                              <span>In a dramatic turn of events, the Royal Shakespeare Company have finally acknowledged that video games are cool and theatre simply does not have enough buttons. They are partnering with a game studio to create a playable adaptation of Macbeth from the point of view of someone examining Lady Macbeth&#x27;s computer for dirt. Lili looks a lot like the interactive drama popularised by Sam Barlow&#x27;s Her Story and Telling Lies. Except this has the added twist of being set in contemporary Iran. The game &quot;will see Macbeth’s witches reimagined as hackers, with surveillance cameras and cyber-infiltration putting the player at the heart of the story...&quot; Witchy hackers? I&#x27;m in.

Nvidia reckon that won’t be an issue with for the imminent RTX 5090 and RTX 5080, though, even with the former’s drastically increased 575W power limit.

Have a trailer. It&#x27;s got robots in it.

                              <span>Back in December, a bunch of cool games had the extreme impoliteness to sneak onto digital shelves while we were losing our hair, souls and marbles covering various gaming award shows. One of those games was Escape From Castle Matsumoto - which can be excused, admittedly, because it&#x27;s a game about ninjas, and we expect ninjas to be sneaky.

If you encounter them in the street, you should jerk away with a muttered oath, making a sign to avert evil spirits - for these are the scumbags who&#x27;ve decided to develop a city-building game in which all the buildings and building materials are subject to realworld physics. A city-building game that takes place on small, post-apocalyptic islands, where the only way to expand is upward.
&quot;Playing Jenga with human lives&quot; is how they summarise it, the wastrels. Here&#x27;s a trailer.

The decision to call it quits follows a bust-up within the development team, though this isn&#x27;t, apparently, why they pulled the plug. Thorson and programmer Noel Berry have found making something &quot;bigger and better&quot; than Celeste exhausting, and have decided to work on smaller projects in future.

It must have been tough for chocolate lovers to get any chocolate when Willy Wonka was hiding golden tickets inside the wrappers.
Joking aside, that&#x27;s more or less been the vibe from Prismatic Evolutions, the just-released, mega-hyped Pokémon card set that’s memorable for its heavy representation of the fan-favourite Pokémon Eevee, and all its evolutionary forms. The 180+ card set was smoke-signaled by The Pokémon Company a little under four months out from its January 2025 release, and fans have anticipated it as the de facto set to look out for, largely due to its similarity to the most popular TCG expansion from the company’s previous card generation, Evolving Skies.

After first catching our eye at the 2023 Gamescom Future Games Show, musical platformer Symphonia has finally finished tuning up and is ready to make some noise on Switch today.
Developed by Sunny Peak and published by Headup, Symphonia is a non-violent platformer where you play as an adorable little violinist, determined to bring life to the musical machinery of the realm. Looking at the above launch trailer, the musical themes go deep, with instruments being integral to your exploration and puzzle-solving.

We&#x27;ve got an updated look at the Japanese software charts courtesy of Famitsu and, given the arrival of a new Nintendo joint, there was never any doubt about who was going to be in first place.
Yes, much like in the UK, Donkey Kong Country Returns HD has swung its way to gold in its debut week after shifting an impressive 107,093 copies. But just look at all the other newbies that DK had to beat to nab the gold! Dynasty Warriors: Origins on PS5 posted a less impressive debut but still managed 63,805 copies to land in second, and Switch took the lion&#x27;s share of Tales of Graces f Remastered&#x27;s sales, which arrived in third.

                              <span>I can&#x27;t get out. I&#x27;m trapped in a tractor full of beer and spare tires. I haven&#x27;t taken a shower in days and a fly has gotten into the cab, buzzing around my ears, anticipating the feast that will come from my sweaty summer death. I just spent nearly an hour driving this tractor to the shop, buying car parts, and rumbling back in the dark. I took my eyes off the road for two seconds to turn on the headlights. It was a mistake. The road curved sharply and I went off a steep bank, tipping my tractor on its side. The door is stuck, the tractor&#x27;s wheels spin helplessly. There is no recovering from this. I restart the game for the third or fourth time, not knowing whether to laugh or sob.
My Summer Car is as hardcore as they come. It does not simply throw you in at the deep end. It ties you up in a cloth sack with 50 kg of lug nuts and dumps you in the Baltic sea. &quot;Sink or swim!&quot; yells this game at you, but in Finnish, so even that you cannot understand. To a certain kind of person, this is an act of love.

                              <span>The high-end prebuilt PC market is a battleground for premium prices, but catching a solid deal can save you a significant chunk of change. Case in point: Dell is offering the Alienware Aurora R16 GeForce RTX 4090 gaming PC for $2,899.99, a full $1,000 off the usual price. It&#x27;s a rare sight to see an RTX 4090 gaming rig dip below the $3,000 mark, especially given the recent uptick in standalone GPU prices.

                              <span>This review contains some story spoilers for the original FF7 and subsequently some elements of Rebirth, but doesn&#x27;t spoil how Rebirth ultimately reinterprets these elements. 
I argued with myself for several weeks in university about whether to go to a seminar discussing T.S. Eliot&#x27;s The Love Song Of J. Alfred Prufrock. The poem meant enough to me that I didn&#x27;t want to dissect it with a class. I wanted to keep for myself. I went in the end, and though I hesitated, I talked because I had things to say. It didn&#x27;t kill the poem for me, but it does have a slightly awkward gait now, having never quite recovered from the incisions.
I now have to etherise Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth. Cait Sith is splayed upon a table. It&#x27;s all scalpels, forceps, and oversized novelty dice. It&#x27;s a strange way to treat art you love. The feeling I remember most from Rebirth on release is how grateful I felt to be alive to play it. Acute, active awareness of my own mortality with thoughts like &quot;it would be properly shit if I died right now because I&#x27;d really like to see how this pans out&quot;. A personal &#x27;never kill yourself&#x27; moment months before the meme gave voice, as the best often do, to an obscure and precious feeling.
An RPG where your character sometimes knocks on doors before opening them? What a time to be alive.

                              <span>In the UK, May has hitherto been a month of innocent delight and sacred observance, with no less than two bank holidays. On May Day - a festival of ancient origins that shares a date with International Workers&#x27; Day - the youths of the village garb themselves in daisies, erect huge candy-striped maypoles, and dance around them in an effort to get all entangled and possibly end up kissing. NO MORE. For May is now the month of DOOM. It marks the coming of a new Dark Age.
Which is to say, it&#x27;s when we&#x27;ll get to play id Software&#x27;s cacodemon-booping FPS Doom: The Dark Ages, going by a leaked release date ahead of tomorrow&#x27;s Xbox Developer Direct.

It first appeared in Halo 3 as a rotating set of modes that would see you quickly cycling through various deadly minigames, from chaotic rockets-only nukefests to panicky punch-ups with ammoless pistols. This time, the playlist includes a familiar geometric hazard that has seen the death of many a bean: the &quot;hex-a-gone&quot; level from Fall Guys.

I wrote about it last year, but that was an older demo build. Things were different then, but the core of this minimalist city builder strategy remains: you&#x27;ll need to actively train your kingly eyes on your feckless underlings if you want them to do any work. Don&#x27;t watch the wheat fields, no food. Don&#x27;t watch the barracks, no knights. You&#x27;ll need those knights to defend from attacks too. Do you see how it all connects?! Do you?! Please, do your research. Here&#x27;s a trailer to help:

                              <span>Debate continues to rage on the internetworks about whether premium video games, and especially the ones with the largest budgets, need to have higher price tags. This time, the culprit is Matthew Ball of analyst firm Epyllion, who remarks in a sprawling State Of Videogaming 2025 report that &quot;some gamemakers hope GTA 6 will be priced at $80-$100 [in the USA], breaking the $70 barrier and helping $50 titles to move up to $60, $60 to $70, $70 to $80, etc.&quot;
Picked up by VGC, these comments have now been circulated on social media, and have attracted the extremely polarised mixture of responses you&#x27;re probably expecting. Among those chipping in is Larian&#x27;s director of publishing Michael Douse, who makes the familiar argument that overall prices for games like GTA aren&#x27;t necessarily higher today when you factor in economic inflation, while also acknowledging that up-front price alone doesn&#x27;t explain the industry&#x27;s recent mass livelihood devastation, and that few people would happily pay that much for a video game - not even Our Lord In Open Worlding GTA.

So it makes sense at least one other developer is looking to apply the same lo-fi principles to their own &quot;hangout game&quot;. The simply titled Sledding Game looks like a chill afternoon of standing around on mountains with your mates and going for a big slide downhill every now and again. It&#x27;s still early in development, as you can tell from the trailer below. But you&#x27;ll be able to embody penguins, frogs, and polar bears as they drink hot cocoa in log cabins and ragdoll into one another willy-nilly. Other cute animals are to be confirmed, but I am putting my money on an dopey-faced ermine.

                              <span>Steam are throwing a Real-Time Strategy Fest this week, encompassing discounts and demos, and people who like clicking on Orc-emitting huts are eating well. Of the new strategy game demos I&#x27;ve spotted so far, the one that interests me most is Calyx, in which you are at war with a mass of alien vegetation, which expands toward your base in a blossoming, suffocating avalanche of green moss and purple tendril. It seems a bit raw at the level of controls and performance, but the concept is very promising: basically, imagine if Creeper World 4 were a bit more like Ground Control. Here&#x27;s a trailer.

                              <span>Capcom have declared that they hope to bring down the recommended PC specs for open world dinosaur-tipping simulator Monster Hunter Wilds, just a month before release day on 28th February, and a few weeks ahead of the final open beta. Much like an exhausted hunter applying a carving knife to the flanks of a steaming heap of Rathalos, they shall trim and whittle their prize to its essential organs - hmm, actually we never see the concluding butchery in Monster Hunter games, now that I think of it. You just waft your knife around dramatically while the slaughtered quarry peacefully disappears and chunks of dino component materialise in your inventory.

The case is a rare example of a seller sourcing their own content but may have been slightly overhyped. Following raids in 2021, &quot;hundreds of thousands&quot; were said to use the service, a figure quietly rounded down to just 2,000.

                              <span>Cyclopean: The Great Abyss appears to have glorious dungeon graphics but I can&#x27;t say for sure because I can&#x27;t get torches to work. I think your character is supposed to kindle them automatically when you venture into a dungeon - at which point the view switches, classic Ultima-style, from top-down into first-person. My character never deigns to light a torch, however. Possibly this is because, no matter how many torches I loot or buy from the underworld&#x27;s infrequent traders, my character page always tells me I have none. Is my character eating them? Are they too afraid to light them and expose what those dungeons contain? Do I need to read the manual properly? Or is it just a bug?

                              <span>An unannounced &quot;PvE Action RPG&quot; set in one of Games Workshop&#x27;s fantasy properties was apparently in development until being cancelled late last year, according to a new report from mp1st.
News of the project was pieced together by mp1st from several LinkedIn profiles belonging to former employees of studio Thought Pennies. Different sources alternately describe the project as a “multiplatform, social role-playing game&quot; and a &quot;fantasy live-service RPG&quot;, although it&#x27;s possible these refer to different projects from the same time period.

I&#x27;ve just got done tearing my face away from the screen it was attached to by the glitter and amphetamine-infused superglue secreted by Mindwave&#x27;s minigame barrage. The current Steam demo is a generous slice of a wonderful thing its developers describe as a &quot;cerebral microgame frenzy&quot;. It&#x27;s the sort of thing you play for five minutes before realising, not unpleasantly, that you are most definitely inside of it now. It has wrapped you all up, and it&#x27;s going to be quite difficult to escape. Trailer below:

The bite-sized two-player shooter was one of our favourite games of last year, summoning the fast-paced killthrills of ancient Quake servers as much as the quickfire 1v1 scraps of the gulag in Call of Duty: Warzone. And now it has a bunch of new maps. Not content with making the powerful pew-pew &#x27;em up completely free (WHAT), the developers have added new weapons, features and a further 30 bullet-pocked arenas. And look, an icy and divisive fan-made map of ye olde Counter-Strike appears among them.

Lumon by Mark Gomersall is a free number clicker based the fourth best television show ever made (Succession, Hannibal, Scavenger&#x27;s Reign, discuss). It&#x27;s not a rip-roaring videogame time or anything, but it is cute. More importantly, it&#x27;s topical. More importantly, it means I get to write &quot;Severance is back!&quot; a bunch. It&#x27;s back! It is!

Simply pour over molten ichor and leave to stand - you&#x27;ll know they&#x27;re ready to eat when you can no longer hear yourself weeping. &quot;Ready to eat&quot; is a phrase that cuts two ways, of course - and what better way to accompany being eaten by Mawflakes than by reading about this week&#x27;s new PC games.

Remember the Electronic Wireless Show? Two of its hosts, Alice Bell and Nate Crowley, have started a new podcast &quot;about video games (mostly)&quot;. It&#x27;s called Total Playtime and an introductory episode 0 and a Patreon are live now. The third host is Jon Hicks, with whom you may be less familiar, but he used to be my boss and thus may be considered the 5th Beatle of RPS. Anyway, go give it a listen.

It&#x27;s a blend of tactical stealth and frenetic Hotline Miami spraying, and it just got a major update to add Steam Workshop support and a map editor.

This revelation appears in data provided by telecoms regulator AGCOM, which oversees the blocking regime. It adds fuel to the already heated discussions, which divide stakeholders and copyright representatives.

Mělo to mít nějakou jinou &quot;message&quot; než &quot;když jsi psychopatický gangster, špatně dopadneš&quot;? Ale docela to uteklo. Jednoznačné mínus a nechtěný (zřejmě?) humor tkví ve skutečnosti, že hlavní hrdinka (t.j. žena) pořád vypadá jako nabušený chlap v paruce a během celého filmu to žádné jiné postavě nepřijde divné.

                              <span>Those capable of quickly bypassing video game copy protection are revered by impatient pirate players. On average, games protected by anti-tamper tech Denuvo enjoy 68 days crack-free before succumbing to piracy. Yet new research focused on MAME (Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator) and video game preservation, reveals that a sample of 712 protected games, released as far back as 1979, took an average of 10.6 months each to crack. Total cracking time: 628 years.

                              <span>In 2024, legal action taken by Spain&#x27;s top-tier football league led to telecoms giant Telefonica disclosing the identities of alleged pirates among its own subscribers. Telefonica&#x27;s cooperation was to be expected, as it just obtained the rights to broadcast LaLiga matches for 1.2 billion euros. In contrast, details of an anti-piracy agreement between the two companies, one that seems to operate in the opposite direction, wasn&#x27;t expected at all.

                              <span>This week, several domain names of the Japanese adult pirate website MissAV were redirected to seizure banners. The legal basis for these confiscations wasn&#x27;t initially clear, but new information ties the action to a U.S. court order. In addition to losing their domain names, the MissAV defendants must pay $4.5 million in damages.

The standard practice when writing up such fan theorising is to walk you through it step by step, peeling back the layers like Inspector Clouseau. But I know that you are a busy person, so I will jam it all into a single sentence: a Twitter account purporting to be a Silksong developer has posted a tweet that seemingly predicts the Switch 2 announcement while using a profile picture of some cake taken from a recipe book that was published on 2nd April 2024 which is exactly a year before 2nd April 2025 which is the date of the Nintendo Direct teased in the Switch 2 announcement.

                              <span>There’s a lot you can do with a third dimension. Texture. Nativity dioramas. Spheres. Hyper Light Breaker, in expanding from the 2D action of Hyper Light Drifter, chooses to almost entirely remake itself as a free-roaming roguelike, trading post-apocalyptic pixel art for big proc-gen vistas and even more acrobatic swordplay.
Its technical ambition, sadly, ends up undermined by the emptiness of its world, the lack of exploratory pleasure that Drifter nurtured so well, and combat that’s more faithful to the original yet doesn’t quite adapt well enough to 3D. Not to mention it has more than its fair share of early access bugs and, especially in the early stages, balancing missteps.

You play a mother, Ro, whose son has been claimed by the Grim Reaper, or whatever they had instead of the Grim Reaper back then - this was, I think, prior to the invention of scythes? And cards? Anyway, while searching for Ro&#x27;s son, you&#x27;ll take part in grid- and turn-based battles against a regular cauldron of unspeakables, including disembodied raven heads and what appears to be a huge pair of subterranean lungs. Here&#x27;s a trailer.

                              <span>Looks like Sony have caught the live service jitters. The company have cancelled two online multiplayer games, including one based on God Of War, according to a report by Bloomberg journalist Jason Schreier. Two different Sony-owned studios were recently told to stop development on their projects. One of those studios is Bluepoint, known for their work on the Demon&#x27;s Souls remake. They were making the unannounced live service God Of War game, according to Schreier. The other studio is Bend, developers of open world zombie &#x27;em up Days Gone. We don&#x27;t know what they were working on, aside from the fact it was also to have a live service business model. In any case, both have been canned.

You have been furtively playing superhero shooter Marvel Rivals with a keyboard and mouse adapter, which makes it look as though you&#x27;re playing with a controller, so that you can take advantage of controller features such as high-sensitivity aim-assist in competitive play.

                              <span>The wallpaper on my phone is of a nondescript street in Shibuya. If I hold my thumb down on the photo in my phone&#x27;s gallery, it actually springs to life for a few seconds and rewinds time in the process. It shows me wobble the phone into position and take the snap: a giant crab clings to a restaurant, a lady totters towards us with a white plastic bag looped around her arm, colourful signs stacked like Legos jut out of grey, &quot;The Body Shop&quot; lies in the distance because of course it does.
It means a lot to me, this photo. It&#x27;s the precise moment I felt excitement shoot through my chest, a pang of &quot;I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m back&quot;.

Both 2016&#x27;s Tales Of Berseria and 2021&#x27;s Tales Of Arise had charming worlds and flashy combat, and the latter has found a home on our picks for the best of the genre.

Now the series is adopting the other dominant JRPG trend of late: remakes and remasters. Tales Of Graces f Remastered, a revision of the 2009 entry in the series, is out now.

                              <span>Blade Chimera is a cyberpunk metroidvania from Team Ladybug, the team behind the really very good Touhou Luna Nights and Deedlit in Wonder Labyrinth. As with Deedlit - one of our favourite &#x27;vanias - I’m drawn to it partly for the opulent real-time RPG combat, and partly because, to be very superficial, the protagonist is taller than I’m used to in games like this. Sometimes he feels too tall for the levels.

                              <span>Following the Republican victory in the US 2024 elections, several US companies have experimented with &quot;pivoting away&quot; from Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, a collection of employment practices aimed at challenging bias and prejudice in the workplace. Facebook owners Meta, Amazon, Walmart, McDonalds and others are reportedly scaling back their DEI initiatives to stave off backlash or litigation from conservative pundits and politicians, who regard DEI guidance about discrimination as a form of discrimination in itself. Following the election, I&#x27;ve also noticed a couple of video game company executives express misgivings about DEI - misgivings that, amongst other things, illustrate that &quot;DEI&quot; has come to mean a lot more than just annual training about micro-aggressions.

                              <span>I have an on-and-off-again relationship with boardgaming based mostly on the fact that I have nobody to play boardgames with. I used to be part of a boardgaming circle, but then I missed a fateful opening round of Twilight Imperium, and then the pandemic started, and then everybody lost patience with Tabletop Game Simulator.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been on a journey. About an hour into Minishoot&#x27; Adventures, I was ready to call this straightforward mix of 2D shmup and 2D Zelda mediocre. My mind had been changed long before I beat the final boss, by which point I thought it was good, but I still felt that all the people praising it at the end of 2024 were singing so loudly only because it was good and short and obscure, three things which in combination are easily mistaken for greatness.
Then I pushed past that final boss, mopping up the remainder of the map, and in that last 25% I think I fell in love. Minishoot&#x27; Adventures is straightforward in concept, but its execution is a masterclass of craftsmanship.

                              <span>In what has become fine tradition, I have learned of an amazing mod on the same day I have learned that the mod has been kiboshed by publishers. The mod in question is the GTA 5 Liberty City Preservation Project, a six year project that rebuilds GTA 4&#x27;s Liberty City in GTA 5&#x27;s world. It launched earlier this month - and now it is no more, for Rockstar have descended like briefcase-wielding peregrine falcons and performed what is being called a &quot;friendly takedown&quot; on modding team World Travel. My brother did a &quot;friendly takedown&quot; on me once, and my elbow still doesn&#x27;t bend the right way.

                              <span>The world looked upon the Nintendo Switch 2, and saw that it was good. Or is it? Observe its enlarged, bezel-shaved screen. Its all-black colour scheme. Its redesigned, more sculpted controllers. Clearly, this is a naked attempt at ripping off and cashing in on the real best gaming handheld of 2025, the Steam Deck.
I, for one, won’t stand for it. Here are five reasons why everyone excited about the Switch 2 is wrong, and should buy a Steam Deck instead. Or maybe the Steam Deck OLED, that one’s better.

I don&#x27;t know if I should be glad that a trading standards agency has done its job, or depressed that over 6,700 people thought this mask looked good enough to buy in the first place.

                              <span>Last year&#x27;s defining indie smash hit, Balatro? Not nominated for the IGF grand prize. Animal Well, which turned damn near every games journalist into a tiresome obsessive? Not nominated for anything. UFO 50, an impressive, important, big boy achievement snubbed by our own 2024 list? It did get a Grand Prize nomination. 

I don&#x27;t disagree with any of the nominees or absences in this year&#x27;s Independent Games Festival Awards, so I don&#x27;t mention any of the above to stir up trouble. Instead I look at this list and think: wow, video games are more varied than ever, so much so that there&#x27;s no longer a dominant cultural narrative even within the specific niche of indie gaming.

A similarly knockabout outdoor adventure with a cast of vibrant characters. Now it&#x27;s getting a new &quot;game-sized&quot; expansion called Lil Gator Game: In The Dark.

                              <span>Lonely Mountain: Snow Riders was one of the best demos I played last year, because it felt so good to gracefully slide down its white-powdered mountains (and clumsily crash into a tree). It might have been one of the best games I played last year, who knows, but it was delayed into 2025. Now it&#x27;s got a fixed release date again: January 21st.

                              <span>Making a game about emotionally wayward 20-somethings in a band? You have my sympathies. Night In The Woods nailed the assignment so thoroughly, and is so beloved, that you&#x27;re in for some tough comparisons. Afterlove EP has plenty going for it that makes it seem like it might be able to hold its own, however. It&#x27;s set in the city of Jakarta, Indonesia, for one. It was conceived of by the creator of Coffee Talk, another beloved game, for another. 

It&#x27;s now got a release date: February 14th.

                              <span>Poppy Playtime is a massively popular horror game released by the indie studio Mob Entertainment. The game is available across various platforms, including the Google Play Store, where copyright-infringing versions are also available. Despite several complaints, Google allegedly failed to remove these unauthorized apps, which prompted the game developers to take legal action.

While these websites offer infringing content, both were cautious to avoid copyright troubles on Telegram.

                              <span>With considerable encouragement from Hollywood and affiliated anti-piracy groups, in 2021 the Malaysian government stepped up its site blocking measures. An official statement published this week reveals that between 2021 and November 2024, a total of 3,682 pirate sites were blocked to prevent exploitation of local content. Interesting, perhaps, but after 15 years of effort, did site-blocking actually work and, if so, who benefited, and how?

                              <span>My feelings about Forest Reigns are equal parts enthusiasm and disappointment, inflation and deflation, straight off the back of the announcement trailer. On the one hand, as a fan of weird forests, which is to say all forests, I&#x27;m keen on the prospect of an FPS set in a post-apocalyptic Paris that has been overrun by sentient, pissed-off trees. It&#x27;s from a team led by a former S.T.A.L.K.E.R. developer, too, and those S.T.A.L.K.E.R. alumni certainly know how to post a good apocalypse. On the other hand, the announcement video suggests a game in which you will mostly treat the frenzied flora as a source of &quot;emergent&quot; cover and terrain traps. Have a look.

                              <span>Stray Kite Studios, a studio that includes former developers of Age Of Empires, Borderlands and Bioshock, have revealed Wartorn, a real-time tactics roguelite in which two elven sisters pit spells and minions against a brace of fantasy opponents, including ogres. It&#x27;s a smaller-scale, squad-managerial affair reminiscent of the ancient Myth: Fallen Lords, though the &quot;painterly&quot; art direction reminds me more of the impressionistic World War 1 fable 11-11: Memories Retold.

                              <span>The current sole creator of immersive sim-shooter Fortune&#x27;s Run has abruptly announced that the project will be going on hiatus, because they are going to jail. Team Fortune&#x27;s lead developer, Dizzie, has been handed a three year sentence for a &quot;violent crime&quot;, following around five years of legal proceedings. The other developer, Arachne, recently left game development after recovering from a mishandled surgical procedure last year. According to Dizzie, her departure doesn&#x27;t have anything to do with the aforesaid violent crime, which pre-dates their relationship.

                              <span>There are currently 35 heroes in Marvel Rivals, split between the roles of Vanguard (tanks), Duellists (DPS) and Strategists (support). That&#x27;s plenty to get your head around, and the roster is expanding rapidly. NetEase have announced that they plan to introduce a new hero approximately every six weeks - in other words, twice per three-month season. I wonder how long it&#x27;ll take them to probe beyond the obvious Marvel headliners and start seriously abrading the bottom of the Connected Universe barrel. Nagneto, for example. Or how about J. Pennington Pennypacker, who shoots coins out of his wrists?

                              <span>You know when you drop your nice, shiny pen and it rolls under your bed, and you look under there and see it winking from the depths of a stygian expanse of superannuated dust bunnies, lakes of mildew and anomalous debris that absorbs far too much light? Just me? I need to get out the mould spray more often.


OK, how about when you were a kid and you lifted up a nice, round stone and the damp, fertile soil beneath writhed away from you in a fervent knotting of pellucid, boneless bodies and the tickling of a thousand little legs? Right. Anoxia Station is that and also, a turn-based strategy game about drilling for oil. The recently released Itch.io demo is rough around the edges, but I do adore the vibe.

                              <span>A quick one: Firaxis have confirmed that Civilization 7 will be Steam Deck verified at launch. It&#x27;s a pleasant surprise, given that 2016&#x27;s Civ 6 is still only listed as &quot;playable&quot; on Valve&#x27;s oversized Switch. I like this news about as much as I&#x27;m terrified to realise that Civ 7 is just under a month away. I do not need that much strategy game, this early in the year. But hey, at least I&#x27;ll be able to play the new 4X in bed as Sid Meier intended.

As reported by 404 Media, this follows several reports on the game&#x27;s forums and social media from players who&#x27;d had their inventories emptied of rare items.

                              <span>A new report has thrown fuel on the fire labelled &quot;Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion remake&quot;. Don&#x27;t ask me why people have started labelling fires. It&#x27;s probably a rite to summon a Daedra, or something. Anyway, a new version of Bethesda&#x27;s somewhat scorned 2006 RPG is allegedly in the works at Singapore-based Virtuos. If rumour speak true, it&#x27;s being made in Unreal Engine 5, and will feature changes to core systems like blocking, stamina, and sneaking.

                              <span>&quot;Coming off Turbo Overkill has been great,&quot; Trigger Happy&#x27;s Sam Prebble tells me over call. &quot;That game&#x27;s development... I mean, it worked out. But it was very messy because it was my first game and I didn&#x27;t know what the hell I was doing. So I found myself, when it came to pumping content out, I was like: oh, shit. This code base is fucking awful. Like, I can&#x27;t put stuff together easily. I&#x27;m running into bugs everywhere. But now shit just works!&quot;
You might know Sam Prebble as Trigger Happy Interactive, the solo developer behind frenetic FPS Turbo Overkill. Before that he went by a different name, attached to a very different project. Total Chaos, first released in 2018 under the moniker Wadaholic, is a total conversion mod for Doom 2. With its focus on a thick survival horror atmosphere of tension and disempowerment, it&#x27;s about as far removed from Turbo Overkill&#x27;s manic, Doom Eternal-inspired action as a game can get. As Prebble puts it, the only thing the two projects have in common is the first person perspective. Even so, he found himself returning to Total Chaos after wrapping development on Turbo Overkill, resulting in the standalone remake.

                              <span>Ah Starfield, the game that left the collective consciousness long ago. In her review, Alice Bee (RPS in peace) said that it was such a large thing it ultimately felt &quot;small, cold and unlived in&quot;. I remember thinking the same. Would I have thought differently if it had copious amounts of gore? No. But would I have had a better time? Probably yes. Well, a former senior artist at Bethesda has revealed in an interview with Kiwi Talkz podcast (cheers VGC for the spot) that they&#x27;d originally planned for it to have decapitations but decided against them in the end.

                              <span>We often get sent so many games from publishers and developers that we simply don&#x27;t have the time or capacity to play. But &#x27;tis the start of the year and I felt like I had a duty to give some of them a proper whirl and see what&#x27;s what. Thus I was lured once again into the roguelike genre, for which I am an eternal sucker.
Developed by Wave Game, Magicraft sees you play as a kid who&#x27;s isekai&#x27;d into another dimension (or at least, I think he is, because I chose the option to &quot;skip the story&quot; when I selected new game and only later deduced the situation) and tasked to mince all the demons within it. It&#x27;s typical fantasy fare with an interesting twist: you can combine any number of spells within your inventory, which made me feel very clever, even if I had no idea what I was doing.

                              <span>Like it or not, horror gaming is often built on jump scares. Deriding a good cheap scare ignores the endorphin rush that draws so many players to the genre, in the same way that the &quot;elevated horror&quot; trend forfeits some of the soul of schlocky slasher flicks and ghost movies. Don’t get me wrong, Silent Hill and Alan Wake deserve their flowers - but even those games would wither on the screen if Pyramid Head didn’t bust through a wall from time to time.
One unsung jump scare game in particular pioneered horror in the internet age, blazing everywhere from nascent social media to major television networks. In fact, if you had an internet connection circa 2005, there’s a good chance you played it. Alas, it was too ahead of its time, too successful at leveraging virality before viral horror was sought after. Next time you see a streamer throw their headphones across the room in fright, beware: the spirit of Scary Maze Game is right behind you.

                              <span>Here be your first moving-picture look at The Blood of Dawnwalker, the dark fantasy RPG in the works at Rebel Wolves – the studio founded by a bunch of former The Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk 2077 devs. As hinted at a couple of times over previous years, when it was known simply as Dawnwalker, you’ll be playing as a vampire, employing various spooky powers to fight militiamen (and, it seems, at least one giant mechanical spider-thing) amidst a deadly plague outbreak.
Unsurprisingly, in retrospect, the trailer also has big The Witcher vibes. The stringy orchestral music? The dramatic monologues? The horrible things happening to armoured grunts? This thing’s really playing the Polish fantasy hits.

                              <span>The &quot;spance&quot; of Annihilate The Spance is apparently “an ancient, roiling storm of matter and energy” that harbours both “extreme and inexplicable phenomena” and “unfathomable riches”. I’m happy to discover this explanation, because at first I thought that “spance” was just a litigation-avoiding, supermarket rebrand of “space”. I was bracing to send the good news to developers Skyglow Softworks that, so far, nobody has managed to copyright “space”, though I’m sure somebody’s tried. Maybe, um, God? 


It’s a relief to know that God won’t be suing Skyglow Softworks for breach of copyright, because off the back of two demo missions, Annihilate The Spance is worryingly compelling. It’s a mixture of space RTS and autobattler, wherein you construct bases that produce spanceships who autopilot towards the nearest and largest concentration of enemies. According to the developers, it’s inspired by the 2011 Flash game Obliterate Everything by CWWallis (RIP), which I dimly recall playing while I was running a browser game blog for AOL. Anyway, here’s a trailer.

                              <span>In its annual report published last week, the U.S. Government listed MagisTV as one of the most notorious piracy services. The mention comes after the IPTV provider, which is mainly popular in Latin America, boldly applied for a U.S. trademark. This trademark is unlikely to be granted without protest, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to be a major issue; the service has already rebranded itself as FlujoTV.

For the owner of the 3 Little Piggies café in Cork, Ireland, providing free Wi-Fi led to an allegation of music piracy from his ISP and advance notice of potential disconnection. What followed was an extremely rare apology, for reasons deserving of a much closer look.

This article collects all those wonderful games and our writings about them in one place, for a post-New Year reading experience that requires you to click less.

                              <span>In 2020&#x27;s Airborne Kingdom, you cobbled together a flying city from sailcloth, smokestacks, wings and flippers, striving to meet a growing population&#x27;s need for food and shelter while dealing with the more exotic problem of levelling your streets out and generating enough lift. In the process, you explored a beautiful, Orientalist world map of faded mosaic tiles and dusty gold fittings. 
In Airborne Empire, out in early access today, you do much the same again, but this time the world is trying to murder you. A bit. You are no longer alone in the skies: there are merchant dirigibles you can barter with, and pirate airships who&#x27;ll strafe your suburbs and set your bazaars on fire. As such, the sequel&#x27;s new city technologies include a choice of offensive and defensive weapons. Here&#x27;s a launch trailer.

Toadman - who also developed soulslike Immortal: Unchained and provided support work for Helldivers 2   - employed 69 people at the time of closure.

                              <span>EEK3 is the alternative showcase of small horror game creators that amalgamates every year like a shell of flies around the corpse of E3. It&#x27;s a lot of fun for people who enjoy ye olde PS1 aesthetics and foggy throwback horror. The 2024 showcase was supposed to happen in time for Halloween, the night when the spirits of old platformer mascots rise from their graves to gift polygons to small children. But it was postponed due to technical problems. Only now has the 2-hour showcase of game trailers emerged, culminating in a new Haunted PS1 demo disc packed with upcoming games. &quot;The curse,&quot; say the organisers, &quot;is lifted.&quot;

                              <span>I&#x27;ve always wished there was a game workers equivalent of gobbing in an especially rude customer&#x27;s cheeseburger. Not that anyone should need the lingering threat of getting served a McLungButter to be polite to service workers, but it seems good to have the option. Possibly spurred on by reality-challenged goblins hounding Final Fantasy 7 Remake Aerith actor Brianna White, Square Enix have shared a new policy outlining how they plan to respond to harassment from customers toward their staff and partners. It&#x27;s obviously a vastly more proper and legally sound approach than the aforementioned sandwich tampering, but I support it nonetheless.

                              <span>Dynasty Warriors: Origins. Finally, a game brave enough to ask: &quot;what if everything cool that went down in Romance Of The Three Kingdoms was thanks to you, a magical, beautiful boy that no-one&#x27;s ever heard of?&quot;.
It&#x27;s a great premise, honestly. The slate wiped clean, what if you got to be mates with everyone from all sides in this grand ensemble tale of warring states? A battle might take eight minutes. The three consecutive bonding cutscenes before the next might take ten. Origins is just as much about fighting thousands at a time as it is about eating lunch with Zhang Fei or discussing the meaning of heroism with Zhou Yu. There&#x27;s a parallel story about your character and his role in a magical order of destiny godlings I didn&#x27;t find the least bit interesting, but the rest is thrilling because Romance is already thrilling. The parts that Origins bogs down with its wordier take on already wordy source material are enlivened again by anime vibrance, hijinks, and melodrama.

For example, my fridge has started bleeding an iridescent fluid. Peering into the oily green depths, I see a much older, cyborg version of myself dressed in spiked leather against a background of burning oceans. The other Edwin mouths and gesticulates urgently, but I have no time for his dire warnings of global calamity. There are new entertainment products to discuss!

                              <span>Hello reader who is also a reader, and welcome back to Booked For The Week - our regular Sunday chat with a selection of cool industry folks about books! I once read in a book that you shouldn&#x27;t really believe anything you read in a book until you&#x27;ve checked at least two other books. Unfortunately, those two books both said the same thing, meaning I had to check four more. If anyone knows what every book ever written says on the subject, do let me know. I&#x27;m trapped now.

                              <span>Welcome back to The Sunday Papers. It&#x27;s 2025, which means that this column has been running for eighteen years. What might change here as we move into adulthood? Very little, I suspect. We here are like the chalk cliffs of the South Downs: bright and imposing and subject to inevitable but slow erosion by the sea. Or put another way: I&#x27;m thinking about bringing back the bulletpoints to separate different links. How are you?

Felipe Pepe wrote about the gentrification of video game history, arguing that American video game history overwrites more local experiences. &quot;We’re not all suburban kids who got a Nintendo 64 for Christmas.&quot;

                              <span>Pure Rock Crawling is about steering off road vehicles across rocky terrain. It&#x27;s about pumping the gas pedal and wrenching the steering wheel just so, such that you lurch forward and over the obstacles, rather than tumbling backwards. It&#x27;s MudRunner without the mud, with a knockabout simplicity presumably as a result of its apparently one-man development team. It launched last October but I hadn&#x27;t heard of it until today, when a new map was added, and now I want to play it.

                              <span>Minecraft is the best PC game, according to me and the RPS staff who dare not cross me. I played it for three hours today and, among the many build challenges and adventures, a small story formed around a baby pig. We named him Porky, we caged him as our pet, and in an unfortunate accident, we watched as he fell to his death from the sky island that was our home. RPS in peace, Porky.

How many befriended pigs like Porky have there been across the last several hundred hours of play? I&#x27;m not sure - dozens, hundreds - but soon such pigs might have a new form. After 15 years, Mojang are adding new types of pig to Minecraft.
