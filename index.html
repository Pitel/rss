                              <span>It was recently revealed that Return to Silent Hill - a new movie based on Silent Hill 2 - has finished filming. Yeah, even though it has flown a bit under the radar, a new Silent Hill movie based on the events of Silent Hill 2 has been in the works for a while, and I&#x27;m cautiously optimistic about it.


I know that getting two re-tellings of Silent Hill 2 in such a short timespan will probably strike many as weird, but the good news here is that they&#x27;ve brought back Christophe Gans, the French director responsible for the original Silent Hill film — the one that kinda owns, not the awful 3D one.




On top of my belief that Gans is a talented director with a strong artistic vision, I also trust him to helm the project because, well, he&#x27;s had a good influence on gaming even without knowing …</span>

Dragon’s Dogma 2 (PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC)

Release Date: March 22
Trailer


This cult classic 360/PS3 era RPG is finally getting a sequel on March 21. The trailers make it look like more of the same, but the graphics have been vastly improved, and the AI of your companions is more effective. This game is like a mix of Elder Scrolls and Shadow of the Colossus. You&#x27;re climbing on top of enemies, fighting them with swords and magic, and exploring a vast fantasy world. You can also enlist the help of pawns from other online players. Hopeful…</span>

                              <span>If you ask people, “What’s your go-to nuclear post-apocalyptic story?” Most will probably say Fallout; the action role-playing franchise that has been around for more than two decades and is now considered one of the most influential game series of all time.


Fallout is one of those massively successful and recognizable names that had very humble beginnings. It may not be as dramatic a tale as two broke programmers grinding in sweat and tears, day and night, to come up with an era-defining masterpiece, but that first game in 1997 is very different from the Bethesda shooter you know and adore today.


In many ways, Fallout was the brainchild of Tim Cain (Pillars of Eternity, The Outer Worlds) who worked on the initial concept for six months before getting the go-ahead from Interplay. By th…</span>

Apparently, the UK rating board PEGI changed the rating from 3+ to 18+ overnight due to &quot;prominent gambling imagery&quot; which prompted the sudden delistings. The problem here is that there is literally no gambling in Balatro.




According to Playstack, they specifically addressed this topic with PEGI back in October after it was originally rated 18+. And, after some communication, PEGI changed the rating to 3+. PEGI even went as far as to assure Playstack that &quot;we have reviewed your product and determined that the disclosure of gambling themes was unwarranted.&quot; Playstack says that the content in Balatro …</span>

                              <span>Space Crew is superficially similar to FTL: you manage a crew in space as you deal with peril, put out fires and fight off aliens. It&#x27;s set apart by between-mission management, during which you get the steady dopamine drip of ship, crew and equipment upgrades and customisation.

It&#x27;s free to keep from Steam for the next two weeks.

                              <span>The two Ori games were gorgeous platformers that challenged your dexterity while tugging on your heartstrings. The next game from developers Moon Studios seems more likely to do the former than the latter. No Rest For The Wicked is a Souls-ish action RPG that apparently thinks you&#x27;re extremely wicked. 

It also got a release date today during a showcase stream: April 18th.

                              <span>It&#x27;s looking increasingly likely that Gearbox Entertainment is going to be sold by Embracer. In a town hall with staff earlier this week, CEO and co-founder Randy Pitchford reportedly told staff that a decision had been made regarding the studio&#x27;s future, with more details to be shared in March.

Embracer bought Gearbox for $1.3 billion (around £1.02 billion) in 2021, but it was reported that they were looking to sell last year as part of ongoing layoffs, closures and divestments.

                              <span>I come to you with an important question today, readers. Has there ever been an actually good sewer level in a video game before? I propose to you that there has not. Sewer levels are the worst. They have always been the worst, and will always be the worst. There is no redeeming feature that can make sewer levels good, fun or enjoyable, and I come to you today saying they must stop. No more sewer levels, developers. Please. I beg you. Especially you, Star Wars: Dark Forces Remaster. You&#x27;re the chief offender in this whole mess, and both my nostrils and my sanity simply cannot take it anymore.

                              <span>When Ori And The Blind Forest developers Moon Studios announced that their next game would be a top-down, online action RPG, my initial reaction was, &#x27;Heck yes, sign me the hell up for this Souls-y, Diablo-y hack and slash.&#x27; Having now played the opening 90 minutes of the game ahead of tonight&#x27;s Wicked Inside showcase, that initial excitement has settled into more of a &#x27;Hoo boy, this thing is hard as nails. Folks who like Elden Ring and Dark Souls are going to go absolutely bananas for it.&#x27; It&#x27;s definitely verging on the edge of being just a teensy bit too punishing for my personal taste, but even though my arse got thoroughly whomped time and time again during this initial prologue section, there&#x27;s still something about No Rest For The Wicked that&#x27;s left me quietly captivated.

The latest victim is Helldivers 2, with scammers putting up two separate fake pages for it on Steam over the last 24 hours. Each page listed Arrowhead as the developer, and PlayStation as the publisher, along with big discounts of 50-75% off to tempt players into buying the cheap version instead of the real one.

What surprises me is that I&#x27;m playing in a way I rarely play roguelikelike games: launching enthusiastically into Endless mode. Turns out, what I want from Endless modes is an end. A brutal and hilariously sudden end.

                              <span>Your most commonly visible bones are your teeth, so what better way to worship at the fleshy altar of Doom than by polishing those bones with an electric toothbrush whose little LCD screen is running Id Software&#x27;s seminal satanic shooter? The latest delightfully weird device rising to the eternal question &quot;Can it run Doom?&quot; is a WiFi-enabled &#x27;smart toothbrush&#x27;, which is juuust powerful enough to run a version of Doom. You can even control it with your mouse. Here, check this out.

                              <span>There are moments where Sons Of The Forest matches the sublime paranoia of Subnautica. There’s that same lurching, exquisite tension as you delve deeper and deeper into darkness where you are not welcome, supplies dwindling, footfall echoing, monstrosities skittering about in the black. On my most intense plunge into one cave, I groaned aloud as the path I was praying must be the exit twisted back on itself, sending me first down a rope, and then into a long slide down, down into the earth, back into the spindly clutches of pale, bifurcated mutants. When I finally saw the sun again, I could have cried.
It’s still a bit wonky, but the full 1.0 release makes the Forest a fuller, livelier and more inviting (or else alluringly off-putting) prospect for a wander - even, as in my case, a wholly solo one. Consider this your cue to peel open some skin pouches.

                              <span>As the video games industry violently contracts to ensure shareholder satisfaction at the cost of making thousands upon thousands of people unemployed, Skylanders studio Toys For Bob have announced they&#x27;re splitting from Activision Blizzard and Microsoft to go independent. Good for them, but maybe too late for some. Earlier this month, the San Francisco Chronicle reported that it seemed Activision Blizzard were closing Toys For Bob&#x27;s California headquarters and laying off 86 people. Still, the new independent Toys For Bob say they&#x27;re working on something new and &quot;exploring a possible partnership&quot; with Microsoft.

                              <span>After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora&#x27;s Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora&#x27;s Mask&#x27;s unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 2 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved. Archived episodes will be uploaded each Saturday on our second YouTube channel Game Informer Shows, which you can watch both above and by clicking the links below.

                              <span>Moon Studios, makers of the acclaimed Ori and the Blind Forest/Will of the Wisps, is tackling a dramatically different project in its first action RPG, No Rest for the Wicked. First revealed during last year’s Game Awards, the studio held a special livestream presentation where it revealed the game’s early access release date: April 18.
No Rest for the Wicked takes place in a dark medieval fantasy world where a deadly plague has befallen an island community, transforming citizens into monsters. You play a chosen warrior to fight against this blight. Combing elements of Diablo, Dark Souls, and even Animal Crossing, you’ll fight for survival while restoring the town of Sacrament. No Rest for the Wicked also happens to be Game Informer’s latest cover story.
Although No Rest for the Wicked will be on Steam via Early Access for the foreseeable future, the game will come to consoles when it eventually launches into 1.0. Our digital cover story launches on March 5, and you can keep an eye out for exclusive features and videos in our cover story hub.</span>

It&#x27;s the game adorning our upcoming issue of Game Informer, but before our exclusive details for that drop, hosts Wesley LeBlanc and Marcus Stewart previewed a pre-Early Access build of the game&#x27;s opening hour or so. 
In it, Wesley explores a medieval coast, gets slaughtered a few times by some tough opponents, saves a blacksmith in trouble, and takes on the game&#x27;s first boss, all while the two discuss their overall thoughts on Moon&#x27;s pivot to this new genre.

Last month, I traveled to Vienna, Austria, with Game Informer editor Marcus Stewart to visit Ori series developer Moon Studios. It was here that Marcus spoke to Mahler and his fellow Moon co-founder and technical director Gennadiy Korol about No Rest For The Wicked, the action RPG adorning Issue 365 of Game Informer magazine, as you might have just learned if you watched Wicked Inside today. 
I watched Marcus play the game for a couple of hours, and while I was there to film for cover story purposes, I&#x27;d be lying if I said I didn’t watch with…</span>

                              <span>Moon Studios cemented itself as a premier upstart studio thanks to its stellar work on Ori and the Blind Forest and Ori and the Will of the Wisps. The team is parlaying that success and experience to craft a dramatically different project it&#x27;s been dreaming about for years: No Rest for the Wicked. This dark fantasy action RPG combines influences from a variety of genres, from ARPGs like Diablo to the difficulty and thoughtful combat of Dark Souls, to the town-building of Animal Crossing, and more.
We traveled to Vienna, Austria, to visit the home (and Moon&#x27;s de facto headquarters) of co-founder Thomas Mahler.

                              <span>Crash Team Rumble, the 4v4 competitive multiplayer game, is getting its final content update next week, less than a year after its launch. However, the game will still be available to play. 
Players who boot up the game have been greeted with a message, posted below, announcing that on March 4, Crash Team Rumble will get its last content drop. The game is not shutting down, though. The base experience will remain live and players will have access to a free 500-tier battle pass. This includes 104 new items from all content across Seasons 1 through 3 and all available event rewards. Developer Toys for Bob has also disabled Crash Coin purchases, and players can use any remaining coins to buy battle pass tier skips.
Crash Team Rumble launched last year on June 20, meaning the game&#x27;s support only lasted for roughly seven months. While it&#x27;s nice that the game won&#x27;t be disappearing for the time being (especially since it&#x27;s quite fun), it&#x27;s a bummer to see its support dry up so quickly. 
We quite enjoyed Crash Team Rumble, scoring it an 8 out of 10 in our review. Writer Aron Garst writes, &quot;Crash Team Rumble&#x27;s take on multiplayer platforming madness is unique, with enough depth to keep you on your toes after hours of gameplay. Those searching for a fresh take on the long-running series should give it a try.&quot;

                              <span>Ahhhh love is in the air. Or maybe it&#x27;s the Mako...regardless, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is finally out on PlayStation 5 and that&#x27;s something we can all celebrate. We had a great time with it – read Game Informer&#x27;s Final Fantasy VII Rebirth review here – and one of the many reasons we enjoyed our 80-plus hours playing is because of the various relationships within the game and Cloud&#x27;s party. Whether you&#x27;re Team Clerith or Team Clifa, or maybe Team Cloud XIII (is that a thing?), there&#x27;s plenty that will leave you satisfied. 
Chief among those things is the special date night that happens within the Gold Saucer. We won&#x27;t spoil when it happens in the game, and we won&#x27;t discuss it in detail here, but we do want to let you know that we spent dozens of hours maxing out our relationships with each party member. That means we were able to take part in all possible dates at the Gold Saucer, and we captured each for you to watch below. 
Here&#x27;s Every Gold Saucer Date In Final Fantasy VII Rebirth

                              <span>Do you remember Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora? The open-world ARPG by Ubisoft saw its last update in early December. Now, after more than two months of radio silence, Avatar&#x27;s got a new update that includes some surprising improvements. Some aren&#x27;t anything to write home about, but other bits from the latest patch notes are worth your attention. 


Title Update 3 goes live with bug fixes galore


The new Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora Title Update 3 patch notes highlight many quest-related bugs, from minor annoyances to soft locks, have been addressed. Teleporting away after a death in certain situations no longer prevents you from completing a quest, and NPCs no longer stand on furniture at certain points during the story. Various graphical issues have been fixed or improved, too.

Visiting the eShop page for Octopath Traveler, at the time of this writing, will display a greyed-out &quot;Not available&quot; icon where the purchase button should be. We reached out to Nintendo to inquire about this, and were directed to a support page that explains some of the situation:



Octopath Traveler is temporarily unavailable for purchase on the Nintendo Switch eShop and My Nintendo Store as of March 1, 2024. The game will be available to purchase again soon.


If you previously purchased this game, it can still be re-downloaded from the Nintendo eShop.

The February 29 This Week in Destiny communication discussed what players could expect from this year&#x27;s event, with a few surprises for good measure. In addition to a stylish new hoverboard to get around, Guardian Games participants can try their luck at new challenges and rake in some unique rewards.


The Guardian Games is a yearly event in Destiny 2 framed as a friendly competition between the three playable classes. It&#x27;s the one time of year when players are encouraged to compete against each other to help their favored class reign supreme. While that&#x27;s still largely the case, a few alterations have been made to spice up 2024&#x27;s Games.

                              <span>A new Terminator game has been in development for some time, and you&#x27;ll be able to play it later this year. Well, in Early Access at least, as Terminator: Survivor will be hitting Steam on October 24. Check out the &quot;Aftermath&quot; trailer below.


If you haven&#x27;t heard of this – and I must admit I was a bit ignorant of it – Survivors is an open-world game that&#x27;s set after Judgment Day in James Cameron&#x27;s sci-fi universe. 




The above trailer doesn&#x27;t give a huge amount away. We see two scavengers, nervously seeking out supplies. With the world in such turmoil, the threat of a Terminator is ever-present. We then get to see the reflection of one of the skeletal robots as it scans the two fuel-seeking humans.


100% rustproof


Terminator: Survivors is being developed by Nacon, and is pretty hot off the heels of the publisher&#x27;s previous game based on a popular sci-fi franchise: RoboCop: Rogue City. Much like the latter, Rogue City offers a new lease on life for the iconic film series.


Whether Survivors will be as well received remains to be seen at this stage. An open-world game where you&#x27;re fighting and surviving against killer robots? Sign me the heck up.


Nacon describes the upcoming game – which is also getting a release on Xbox Series X|S and PS5 – thus:



It’s been four years since the day humanity nearly perished. The truth of the event is still muddied in half-truths as you emerge from a shelter to attempt [to] reestablish some semblance of society in a world that seems hell-bent on eliminating you and the last vestiges of mankind. You are tasked with scouring the surrounding land for materials, information, other survivors and key resources in order to establish a base of operations for your fledgling group.




Fun!

According to a post from The Gamer a couple of days ago, fans began to notice that Tomb Raider I-III Remastered was different on EGS than on Steam. For starters, the Epic Games version had different skyboxes in places like the Colosseum, and the Greece levels had &quot;new light holes.&quot;




Since then, a post on the Steam page has noted that EGS had a build of the remaster that had &quot;incomplete assets,&quot; and the download contained &quot;some work-in-progress materials&quot; that weren&#x27;t meant for public consumption.


Update also imminent


Aspyr has now fixed the problem, uploading the correct version to Epic. However, some – such as a reporter from Eurogamer and the aforementioned The Gamer article – have noted this incomplete build had better-looking assets than the Steam version. This could suggest that the two downloads are not evenly matched, for whatever reason.


That aside, Tomb Raider I-III Remastered is also getting its first update soon. In the same Steam post, the developer thanked fans for their &quot;continued support, shares, and feedback&quot; on the games, with an update said to be in the works.


We don&#x27;t exactly know what&#x27;s coming, but the studio says it anticipates sending this update out &quot;in the next few weeks.&quot;

Hopefully the Gauntlet provides new end-game goals


Diablo 4 has a pretty big end-game content problem right now. There&#x27;s not really much to do and hardly a reason to level all the way up to 100 other than just to say you did the grind. However, that might change with the introduction of the Gauntlet.


Accessible for both Normal and Hardcore characters, the Gauntlet unlocks for players on the Seasonal Realm once they&#x27;ve gained access to World Tier IV. However, the monsters in the Gauntlet are over Level 1…</span>

A good month because of Sifu alone


If you haven&#x27;t had the opportunity to play Sifu, this is your chance. Our very own Eric &quot;Queen&#x27;s Blood Master&quot; Van Allen gave it a solid 9/10 when it was released two years ago, praising Slowcap&#x27;s ability to tread the line between challenge and reward.

LocalThunk&#x27;s excellent roguelike deckbuilder Balatro has been removed from various Switch eShops &quot;without any advance warning&quot; following an apparent age rating change from 3+ to 18+ by European ratings board PEGI.
Publisher Playstack issued a statement via Twitter saying the publisher is &quot;especially disappointed in the actions of the ratings board&quot; following post-appeal assurances in October 2023 that the game did not contain gambling themes after they had presumably been flagged in the certification process.

You can read the publisher&#x27;s statement in our story below. Until this ratings issue is resolved, European Switch gamers will have to sit tight on this one. If you&#x27;ve previously purchased the game on any of the affected Switch eShops, you should still be able to access the game.

There are five different sets for you to choose between, each of varying sizes (and prices). The one that is going to set you back the most Bells is the Nook&#x27;s Cranny &amp; Rosie&#x27;s House set, which is available for £64.99 and contains 535 bricks across the two builds.

The Simpsons is, somehow, still a thing in 2024. Regardless of what we might think of its overall quality, however, there&#x27;s no denying that the cartoon is able to pull off some truly weird and wacky crossovers.
While presumably not an official crossover by any means, the show has recently strayed into the realm of Mario Kart with a bizarre dream sequence in which Lisa, Homer, Milhouse, and more partake in a race on what appears to be a take on the racing franchise&#x27;s Rainbow Road (thanks, Eurogamer).

                              <span>The hunt begins (soon).
If you can believe it, the Monster Hunter series has been around for a whopping 20 years. To mark the occasion, Capcom has today announced the long-awaited anniversary ‘Special Program,’ which is set to kick off on 12th March at 11am GMT / 4am PDT.

Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth is out this week and while many PlayStation 5 owners will be likely diving into the highly anticipated release, the game&#x27;s producer Yoshinori Kitase is actually planning to return to The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.
Speaking to BAFTA, Kitase mentioned how he had been a lifelong fan of the series since the original game Legend of Zelda on NES and while he was enjoying Tears of the Kingdom, unfortunately, life got in the way (like it probably has for so many other Zelda fans).

This information comes from Gamereactor via Eurogamer, and it&#x27;s reportedly part of the previously announced &quot;business review&quot; last year by parent company Digital Bros, with plans in place to lay off 30 percent of employees.

It&#x27;s been another wild week for the video game industry and it seems we&#x27;re not done just yet. After mass layoffs at companies like PlayStation and Electronic Arts, we&#x27;ve now got developers splitting from their owner groups.
Adding to this is the Crash Bandicoot and Spyro developer Toys for Bob, which has now announced it&#x27;s leaving Activision and the Xbox team to become an independent studio. This follows reports of its facility closing down, with reportedly 86 workers impacted at the time of Microsoft&#x27;s mass layoffs.

The site&#x27;s staff doesn&#x27;t explain the latest brand switch but a recent &#x27;dynamic+&#x27; site blocking order in India may have factored into their decision.

Contrary to some reports, today&#x27;s changes don&#x27;t amount to a total ban on VPNs. Use of state approved VPNs, which do everything except the useful stuff, remain legal. The new law criminalizes the promotion of VPNs for site-blocking circumvention. But Russia also wants citizen&#x27;s to stay safe, warning that VPNs in the U.S. are prone to government spying.

                              <span>Every so often, a bug or glitch is accidentally included within a game that players use to their advantage. Palworld had one such exploit from day one, which allowed players to capture Tower Boss Duos and add them to their typically Pal-filled party.


However, thanks to the recent implementation of patch 0.1.5.1, this ability has been removed, and players are feeling mixed emotions about it. On one hand, the community is upset that they can no longer capture Lily or Victor, but there’s widespread amusement due to Pocketpair’s public apology on the matter.




It’s not very often that a development team apologises for doing what they do - namely fixing bugs - in such a public manner. Commenters on the post are in agreement on one thing, though: The Pocketpair team is damned if they do and …</span>

                              <span>Google has a long history of easter eggs, from HTML trickery to paying homage to Bletchley Park with a very apt decoding animation. I can say with certainty that I wasn’t expecting to see a stampede of Chocobos on my screen today, though.


But that’s what happens if you do a search for “Chocobo” or “Final Fantasy”, in celebration of the release of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth. Along with the adorable retro Chocobos, you’ll also see a few Cloud Strifes, complete with Buster Sword aplenty and some (slightly disorienting) shaking visuals for the links underneath.


With the excitement surrounding the long awaited release of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, it makes sense that Google would add this feature as they’ve done for popular titles in the past, such as the Last of Us mushroom easter egg.


How to get a Chocobo stampede on Google


Screenshot by Destructoid


It’s super simple to see this easter egg for yourself. All you need to do is head to Google and search “Chocobo” or “Final Fantasy”. All of the usual results will appear, but there will be a small yellow button in the middle of your browser window, toward the bottom, complete with a Chocobo silhouette. 


Clicking on this button once will result in one or two Chocobos and the accompanying shakes of the search results beneath, but the fun really starts when you repeatedly spam click. Doing so will result in a stampede of multicolored Chocobos, as well as Cloud making an appearance. 


Be careful though, maybe it’s just me being a little too over eager, but pressing the button too much may result in slowing your browser down to a standstill, at least for a little while. 


Still, it’s fun. Give it a try!

The Closed Beta will run from April 15 through April 21, with sign-ups open now through April 5.




Players can embark on a Viking expedition solo or with up to three friends as they work together to build a Viking empire. Collecting resources, building a thriving settlement, and summoning intelligent NPC villages are some of the tasks required to do so. Players will also need to automate, manage, and defend their tribe especially to survive the bitter cold winter.



&quot;ASKA stands as a testament to what a dream-team of just 10 people can achieve over the course of 4 years: an ambitious co-op survival tribe builder where you&#x27;re never alone, where you work alongside lively AI villagers that are almost indistinguishable from players, all woven into a deep city builder-like economy system. We’re entering the final phase of our beta testing period and we can&#x27;t wait to give players the power to build their very own truly functional Viking village, who knows what they&#x27;ll build.&quot;
- Cristian Diaconescu, Creative Director at Sand Sailor Studio



We&#x27;ve seen quite a few survival builders released recently. But honestly, all you had to say was Viking and I&#x27;m in. Based on the trailer it looks like you can get pretty creative with actually building out your settlement. And hopefully, they mean it when they say intelligent NPC villagers. I&#x27;ve seen several games in the genre recently add NPCs to help players with tasks like gathering, building, and even fighting. But none of them have quite gotten it right.


Those interested in participating in the Closed Beta that runs from April 15 through April 21 can ASKA Discord server before April 5.

                              <span>News Tower, from four-person developer Sparrow Night, tasks you with saving a sinking 1930s newspaper. The game’s early access release feels more like an extended demo, but it’s one that definitely has me intrigued about the future. 


The game begins with you inheriting a small newspaper business from your uncle. The paper publishes each Sunday, so you need to start sending out your small team of reporters to find stories immediately. Every story is marked by tags – like crime, politics, or sports – that correspond to the interests of various readers. The tags you choose to print each week, particularly the ones that make it to your front page, affect how much money you earn. 


That money can be spent on anything from workplace necessities like bathrooms for your employees to printing pr…</span>

                              <span>Despite mostly going under the radar before it came out, Helldivers 2 proved that it&#x27;s got what it takes to reach the top charts. With a concurrent player cap of 700,000 players, Helldivers 2 has now revealed that it&#x27;s got a veritable &quot;Game Master&quot; coordinating its war efforts.


Notably, it&#x27;s plain as day that Helldivers 2&#x27;s galactic war efforts are not just a randomized series of combat scenarios thrown together by an algorithm. A prime example of this being the case was the rapid onslaught of Automaton forces after Super Earth won its first clash against the Terminid. Not only can Arrowhead Studios thus create a custom &quot;campaign&quot; for the entire community to participate in, though, but there&#x27;s a developer whose job is specifically to spice things up in the live game.

                              <span>CD Projekt Red just dropped the latest update for Cyberpunk 2077, and it makes a handful of visual updates to the game while also addressing some glitches that range from harmless to game-breaking. 


Officially, Cyberpunk 2077 is finished, and CDPR planned for patch 2.0 to be the last big update to the game, but things didn’t shake out that way. Ahead of the game’s Ultimate Edition release, patch 2.1 added a ton of new content, including a functional metro system and new companion side activities. After that CDPR shifted its focus to the Cyberpunk sequel, but the developer is still ironing out some details in 2077. 


The latest update is patch 2.12, and while it brings a number of welcome changes, it isn’t adding any new content to the game. Instead, 2.12 is aimed at making small adjustm…</span>

                              <span>February 29 is a rare day, a perfect date to celebrate with a session of the Final Fantasy-themed musical game Theatrhythm Final Bar Line. However, I&#x27;ve got sad news for anyone attempting to celebrate today with a little Theathrythm as the rhythm game just won&#x27;t load on this day, specifically. 


The situation is a bummer, yes, but worry not as a solution already exists, and the cause for the whole thing is rather hilarious.




It seems like what&#x27;s preventing players from joining the servers is that we&#x27;re currently existing in the most cursed day of a glitched period in time, the one our calendar lords call &quot;leap year&quot;. Look, I admit that don&#x27;t know the complex math behind this cosmic event, but I believe Destructoid&#x27;s own Zoey Handley perfectly described it as &quot;a little Y2K that comes &#x27;round every four years&quot;.


This Y2K ordeal becomes twice as hilarious once you remember that Theatrhythm is a mostly offline game. It doesn&#x27;t need the Internet, hell, it doesn&#x27;t even need to know what time it is. In fact, the good people at Vooks report having tried it on their consoles, and the fix they found was to just change the console&#x27;s date to any other date of the year. Thank you, Mr Kojima, you&#x27;ve taught us well.


Here&#x27;s hoping Square Enix solves this problem soon, or the Theatrhythm fans who are too wise to mess with the authorities of time will have to abruptly find new plans for February 29, 2028.


This is such an interesting failure — or maybe, just maybe, Square Enix is bottlenecking Theatrhythm on purpose to prevent it from completely overshadowing the release of Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth, the real competition here all along. There&#x27;s just no way of knowing.


Theatrhythm Final Bar Line is usually available on the PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch, just not today. 


Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth comes out today on the PlayStation 5 and will likely stay available until the great global collapse.

                              <span>Hot skippidy Nimbus, it&#x27;s actually happening. Destiny 2 is getting hoverboards. Announced in one of Bungie&#x27;s This Week in Destiny communications, and alongside a snazzy-looking trailer, the new vehicle type will be a part of 2024&#x27;s Guardian Games event.


Players have asked for hoverboards in Destiny 2 for years, often citing desires to see changes or improvements to the long-standing Sparrows. Naturally, when Nimbus and Rohan showed up on their pseudo-hoverboards in Lightfall, players only wanted them more. 


Now, Guardians will finally be able to see their dreams come true and give grinding in Destiny a whole new meaning.




Bungie is officially calling the hoverboard the &#x27;Skimmer.&#x27; And the TWID notes that they&#x27;ll function a lot like Sparrows, albeit with a couple of notable differences. Namely, Skimmers can grind rails in the environment and look to sport some stylish new trick animations.


The Skimmer coming to the Guardian Games is Allstar Vector, a flat, vaguely spork-shaped silver board adorned with event decals. Everyone can use the Skimmer throughout the free three-week event, and it&#x27;s possible to earn it for good via Guardian Games&#x27; Drop In quest. 


In addition to Allstar Vector, Bungie noted that another Skimmer would also be available through the Eververse Store. While the details weren&#x27;t fully shared, the TWID hinted that it&#x27;s inspired by a &quot;beloved&quot; Destiny weapon. Here&#x27;s hoping Guardians will soon find themselves hovering around on the old G-horn.


Destiny 2&#x27;s 2024 Guardian Games, and the chance to grab the game&#x27;s first hoverboard, start on March 5.

Embracer had purchased Gearbox for $1.3 billion in 2021. However, after purchasing studios from around the world, the Swedish company released an open letter explaining that it is aiming to become a “heavy-investment-mode to a highly cash-flow generative business,&quot; and this will require “closing or divestments of some studios and the termination or pausing of some ongoing game development projects.”

                              <span>On the company’s website, Toys for Bob, the developer behind Skylanders and Crash Bandicoot 4, has announced that it&#x27;s diverging from Activision Blizzard to become independent.


The post doesn’t really give much more in the way of details. It states that the company will return to being a “small and nimble studio.” They also state that, while they’re separating, they are looking into a “possible partnership” with Microsoft. Explaining, “Our friends at Activision and Microsoft have been extremely supportive of our new direction, and we’re confident that we will continue to work closely together as part of our future.”


That’s somewhat surprising, considering Toys for Bob was reportedly among those hit by the massive wave of Microsoft layoffs in the wake of the Activision Blizzard acquisition. Don’t burn any bridges, I suppose.


Toys for Bob says it&#x27;s in the early days of developing its next game and is looking forward to providing more updates.


This news comes shortly after the news that Saber Interactive and Gearbox are being sold off by Embracer Group. Throughout the coronavirus pandemic and even following that, we say a period of rapid acquisitions from companies like Sony, Microsoft, and Embracer. In the fallout of that, there have been a dizzying number of layoffs and studio closures, so seeing a developer spin-off on their own is almost refreshing.

                              <span>Bloomberg is reporting that Saber Interactive, the developers reportedly working on a remake of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, is being sold by Embracer Group to a private investment group.


Embracer Group has been going through a massive restructuring that has seen hundreds of employees laid off and the shuttering of studios. This latest deal appears to be another part of that ongoing effort.


While the state of the Knights of the Old Republic remake is currently in question, Saber Interactive is slated to release a few games this year, including Warhammer 40000: Space Marine 2, Toxic Commando, and Expeditions: A Mudrunner Game. It’s currently not known how the sale will affect their current projects, which also include Jurassic Park: Survival. 


According to Bloomberg’s source, the deal is worth $500 million. Saber was part of Embracer’s big buying spree. They purchased the company back in 2020 at a reported price of $525 million, which means a bit of a loss. Furthermore, Bloomberg is reporting that the price also “includes an option for Saber to bring along multiple Embracer subsidiaries.” While this might just be referring to Saber’s branches in other countries, there are other studios listed under them, such as 3DRealms and Tripwire.


It’s possible that more of these sales will happen as Embracer continues its efforts to restructure. During their previous fiscal reports, the corporation has stated that they are in “the final stretch” of their restructuring, but it’s currently unknown what else is planned.

                              <span>Naughty Dog is one of the big players when it comes to gaming studios. It has given us timeless titles from Jak and Daxter to The Last of Us. The President of Naughty Dog, Neil Druckmann, recently sat down for an interview with the rapper Logic to discuss their career trajectories and their plans for the future. 


It&#x27;s an hour-and-a-half-long interview worth watching if you&#x27;re interested in learning how Druckmann found his way into the gaming industry and moved up the ranks in Naughty Dog. It also offers insight into how things have changed in the studio over the years and how expectations have sharply risen as it has delivered critical hits.

                              <span>At the time of writing, the GTA 6 trailer is sitting pretty at 178 million views on YouTube. But that&#x27;s not what most people are interested in. What we want to know is exactly when it&#x27;s coming out. Well, the end may be in sight for the long-awaited Grand Theft Auto game.


According to a report from Bloomberg&#x27;s Jason Schreier, Rockstar is asking all staff to return to the office for &quot;five days a week starting in April.&quot; This is for &quot;security and productivity reasons,&quot; according to Rockstar Head of Publishing Jenn Kolbe.




The report goes on to say GTA 6 is about to &quot;enter the final stretch of development.&quot; This means we&#x27;re getting ever closer to its release, though we obviously still don&#x27;t know when that&#x27;s likely to happen.


Employees &quot;not thrilled,&quot; it seems


The fact that Rockstar Games is putting out the clarion call for employees shows the company is looking to end hybrid working conditions. It&#x27;s a topic that&#x27;s been quite prevalent in the working world, and Rockstar asking staff to return to the office is likely due to security breaches, such as the great GTA 6 leak of 2022.


Companies asking people to shift to on-site working on a more permeant basis is becoming more common as the memories of the pandemic begin to fade for a lot of people. However, such a move may prove unpopular with those in the gaming industry who have adjusted to working remotely.


That aside, we don&#x27;t exactly know when the game itself will actually be launching, even if it is heading towards the finish line. We&#x27;re being told it&#x27;s aiming for a 2025 release, so we&#x27;re still looking at nearly another year yet, give or take.


No doubt it&#x27;s going to be one of the biggest releases of all time. Given the legacy of Grand Theft Auto 5 – which came out over 10 years ago, don&#x27;t forget – there&#x27;s no way the follow-up is going to be anything other than a money-printing license for Rockstar.

                              <span>Nintendo has filed a lawsuit against the creators of Yuzu, an open-source Switch emulator. As first reported by Game File&#x27;s Stephen Totilo, the full legal document is available online, and it features a plethora of accusations against Yuzu and its creators. 


As the lawsuit alleges, Yuzu allows players to play pirated games. The Switch maker has invested a lot to prevent piracy via multiple means, and at least two or three technological measures are always implemented to protect its games, including &quot;encryption that scrambles the audiovisual content in the game file to make it unusable without the use of proprietary use of cryptographic keys.&quot; Additional layers of encryption are also included to prevent the modification of its consoles.

                              <span>Amid the Electronic Art layoffs, Respawn has announced the cancellation of their Star Wars first-person-shooter. The decision comes from the company&#x27;s examination of the player community, and their interests apparently lying more in Jedi and Respawn&#x27;s brands.


According to EA president Laura Miele, Respawn&#x27;s primary focus will now be new projects based on &quot;owned brands,&quot; while providing ongoing support for existing games.


&quot;It&#x27;s always hard to walk away from a project, and this decision is not a reflection of the team’s talent, tenacity, or passion they have for the game,&quot; said Miele. &quot;Giving fans the next installments of the iconic franchises they want is the definition of blockbuster storytelling and the right place to focus.&quot;

                              <span>Poncle has abruptly dropped a new update for Vampire Survivors with a trailer that includes some well-timed Final Fantasy references. Just a few. The Space54 update is available today.


Is the update at all related to Final Fantasy? Hmmm, no. It doesn’t look like it. However, for some reason, the team decided to release a trailer alongside it that is a shot-for-shot remake of the 1997 Final Fantasy VII trailer. Well, as shot-for-shot as they can manage with Vampire Survivors.




What? Well, according to the press release I received, an insides says, “Because we had the original trailer on a PlayStation demo disk and watched it on loop so now it’s scored into our brains. Plus the team is extremely hyped for Rebirth. What better way to celebrate than with a trailer of our own?”


As for the actual update, I don’t think you’re going to be seeing any buster swords. It looks to be more sci-fi-themed. This is what Poncle has highlighted for the Space54 update:


7 New Achievements


2 New Characters:



Bat Robbert – When falling below 20% health, he gains +16 MaxHP (max +400) and recovers 30% health. This ability recharges every time the character is fully healed.


Space Dude – Every few seconds fires all weapons regardless of their Cooldown. The cooldown of this ability is affected by the Cooldown stat.



New Weapons:



Pako Battiliar – May retaliate when losing health.


Phas3r – Pew Pew! Generates thin damaging zones. High Amount scaling.



New Stage



Space54 – A cosmic trek through horrors and delights.



New Relic



Allows to enable random level up choices.



Vampire Survivors is available on basically everything at this point. The Space54 update is free and will be arriving today.

                              <span>Derceto Manor is where we return for our scene, in the upcoming reboot (again) of Alone in the Dark. In the latest teaser shown by publisher THQ Nordic, we get some hints of plot, some talking points from Emily and Edward&#x27;s respective voice actors, and we now have the hardware specs for PC.


The new trailer once again leave survival horror fanatics hungry for more, as we take a quick peek at the reimagining of this classic. Actor David Harbour – who voices Edward – talks about his love of games that let you &quot;choose your own adventure,&quot; while Jodie Comer – AKA Emily Hartwood – is impressed by how &quot;fully fleshed out&quot; the characters are.

                              <span>Embracer Group, the company behind the closure of Saints Row studio Volition Games and layoffs at companies like Eidos-Montréal and Black Forest Games, is set to sell Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic remake developer Saber Interactive, according to a new Bloomberg report. Embracer is selling the developer to a group of private investors in a deal worth $500 million, a source told the publication. 
Once the deal goes through, Saber Interactive will be a privately owned company and free from Embracer, which is behind layoffs spread throughout the past couple of years. Following the transaction, the studio will continue work on its Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic remake, which it took over as the developer after Aspyr Media was removed from it in 2022. 


Bloomberg reports this sale is another effort of Embracer to cut costs alongside studio closures and layoffs after a planned $2 billion deal with Saudi Arabia-backed Savvy Games Group fell through in 2023. The publication writes one of its sources says the $500 million deal comes with the option for Saber Interactive to bring with it multiple Embracer subsidiaries as well. 
Saber Interactive is also working on the recently announced first-person Jurassic Park: Survival.

As you navigate a reality-bending doomsday loop, your vehicle is the only thing keeping you from impending death – if you&#x27;re good enough at driving it. I&#x27;ve had fun in this world speeding through the forest and grabbing glowing yellow orbs, but the car is one of the most interesting parts to me for one reason: I don&#x27;t have a driver&#x27;s license yet.
After years of procrastination and two expired temporary permits, I&#x27;ve finally started learning to drive in earnest. I spent years of adulthood in the dark, and it&#x27;s been fascinating to open my eyes to something that is an everyday experience for millions of people. And as much as it&#x27;s opened my eyes to a new side of the real world, it&#x27;s making me see video game driving in a differen…</span>

                              <span>Toys for Bob, the studio behind games like Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy, Spyro Reignited Trilogy, and Crash Bandicoot 4: It&#x27;s About Time, has announced it is splitting from its owner Activision Blizzard to go independent. It is also exploring a partnership with Microsoft. 
Toys for Bob announced this in a statement released today, which explains why now is &quot;the time to take the studio and our future games to the next level.&quot; 


Here&#x27;s Toys for Bob&#x27;s statement, in full: 
Toys for Bob did not disclose a price (if there is one) associated with its split from Activision Blizzard, which arrives just a few months after Microsoft purchased the company for a colossal $69 billion.
Toys for Bob joins another studio leaving the hands of its owner today: With a $500 million deal, Embracer Group has sold Saber Interactive to a group of private investors, as reported by Bloomberg. Kotaku is also reporting today that Gearbox, the makers of the Borderlands series, is looking to break away from Embracer Group as well.

Now that we&#x27;ve spent a cumulative hundreds of hours in the vast, dense world created by Square Enix, we can confirm that they were not misleading us in the slightest; Final Fantasy VII Rebirth has a diverse and impressive list of minigames for players to spend time with during their playthrough of this second act of the Remake trilogy. 
While each minigame is fun in its own way, some elevate above the rest to give players something exciting to look forward to each time the diversion presents itself. We&#x27;ve ranked each major minigame in Final Fantasy VII Rebirth below. If you&#x27;ve had a chance to experience all the minigames that F…</span>

We don&#x27;t know why this happened, or if developers at Square Enix and Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio were in communication, or if scooters happen to be really popular in Japan right now – we don&#x27;t know. One question we can answer, however, is which one is better?
Join Marcus Stewart and me as we put the two Segway-inspired scooters to the test side-by-side across a series of competitions and stunts to see which two-wheeled balancing vehicle is the best.

                              <span>Electronic Arts is laying off 5 percent of its workforce, which accounts for roughly 670 employees. CEO Andrew Wilson issued a company-wide letter informing staff of the publisher&#x27;s restructuring, which will mean sunsetting some live service titles and ceasing the development of certain projects.
In his letter, Wilson states that EA is restructuring to become more streamlined in order to deliver &quot;deeper, more connected experiences for fans everywhere that build community, shape culture, and grow fandom.&quot; To that end, the company will be moving away from licensed IPs and shutting down certain titles to shift its development resources. 
&quot;We are also sunsetting games and moving away from the development of future licensed IP that we do not believe will be successful in our changing industry,&quot;…</span>

                              <span>YouTube has released a dedicated website for its copyright transparency report. The latest data show that automated copyright claims remain in favor and are rising rapidly. In the first half of 2023, YouTube processed 980 million Content ID claims, a 25% increase compared to a year earlier. By claiming videos this way, rightsholders generate billions in additional revenue.

                              <span>The Trustworthy Accountability Group aims to increase trust in the digital advertising industry, in part by limiting pirate sites&#x27; access to advertising. A new initiative will see the development of a new blocklist containing pirate site domains to be avoided. The idea isn&#x27;t new but here, pirate site data will be combined with data originally obtained by anti-malware vendors, meaning that pirate sites with malicious ads could make themselves even more of a target.

This mechanical keyboard is more humble than its peers too, with a $30 asking price that is absolutely exceptional for a name-brand keyboard that gets rave reviews: the Keychron C3 Pro.

                              <span>You may have noticed that SSDs got extremely cheap towards the end of 2023, and then they rebounded somewhat in 2024. We normally expect better deals at Black Friday than during the rest of the year, but this is something a bit different, with oversupply in 2023 leading to significant reductions that aren&#x27;t likely to be repeated in 2024. However, there are still some better deals than others, and unless you can hop in a time machine they&#x27;re still well worth covering. 
The subject of today&#x27;s deals post is the Kingston KC3000, an SSD that I use in my own testing PC thanks to its high capacity, impressive PCIe 4.0 speeds and generally aggressive pricing. Today you can pick up the 2TB KC3000 for £123, a fair price for a drive that cost more than £150 at the start of 2024.

                              <span>Almost two years after announcing a survival game based on the Terminator movies, Nacon today revealed the game is named Terminator: Survivors and will enter early access in October. It&#x27;s set in 2009 after the end of the world, and will see us scavenging to get by as a fledging resistance begins to form. Expect cooperative multiplayer, solo play, base management, and a trailer which doesn&#x27;t show much of anything.

It will be coming first to Steam early access later this summer, a new cinematic trailer from tonight&#x27;s Nacon Connect stream has revealed, but don&#x27;t worry if you haven&#x27;t played the first game yet. This sequel is actually set three years before the events of 2019&#x27;s Greedfall, and stars a completely separate protagonist.

This is a huge 45-incher, offering what is essentially two 1440p 165Hz screens side-by-side. It normally retails for £799, but today Very are offering it for £100 off - £699. That&#x27;s a good price for what is essentially two mid-range gaming monitors seamlessly joined into one.

                              <span>GTA 6 developer Rockstar Games are reportedly ending hybrid working and requiring employees to return to the office full-time, with a view to being in &quot;the best position to deliver the next Grand Theft Auto at the level of quality and polish we know it requires, along with a publishing roadmap that matches the scale and ambition of the game.&quot; That&#x27;s allegedly from an email to staff sent by head of publishing Jenn Kolbe.

                              <span>As with all headlines that are phrased as a question, the answer is &quot;probably not&quot;, but in any case, Miyazaki has mysteriously hinted at there being at least one secret thing in Elden Ring that players haven&#x27;t found yet. On this week&#x27;s Electronic Wireless Show podcast we discuss this, as well as some of our favourite and least favourite deployments of the video game Easter egg. We also talk about what we&#x27;ve been playing this week (Nightingale; PowerWash Sim, natch) and visiting Scotland. Sadly neither of us got to go to the Glasgow Willy Wonka experience. But we both wish we could have.

                              <span>Rocket Rat Games co-founder John Guerra remembers the exact day he started working on Cobalt Core&#x27;s first prototype. He and his fellow co-founder Ben Driscoll had just spent a week playing Daniel Mullins&#x27; mysterious roguelike deckbuilder Inscryption at the end of October 2021, but the combination of a bad storm and a power outage ended up forcing Guerra to decamp from his home in Massachusetts and stay with some family until it all blew over. &quot;I got back late on Halloween, just in time to put out a bowl of candy for some kids, and then the next morning we started Cobalt Core,&quot; he tells me.
The pair had been working on a range of different prototypes in the months leading up to this lightbulb moment. As development on their debut game, the spaceship building puzzler Sunshine Heavy Industries, began winding down, &quot;we were throwing all kinds of stuff at the wall,&quot; he says, including games in 3D, a platformer, with Driscoll revealing they even had &quot;a Terraria-like one for a couple of weeks&quot; with a grid-based world that characters bounced around in. But it was playing Inscryption that brought everything to a head. Both had spent hundreds of hours with Slay The Spire, but &quot;Inscryption proved to us that there was still a lot of space to explore in the genre,&quot; says Guerra. And with increasing calls from Sunshine Heavy Industries players begging them to let them fly the ships they were creating in its shipyard sandbox, &quot;you can kind of see how that went from A to B&quot;.

                              <span>In Shakespeare&#x27;s Anthony And Cleopatra, said famous woman says &quot;Give to a gracious message an host of tongues, but let ill tidings tell themselves when they be felt.&quot; I.e., when you have good news you can go round the houses, but if you have bad news - like sending an all-hands email to the staff at EA to let them know that, less than a year after the last round of layoffs, a further 5% of them are getting booted - then you should just come out and say it as quickly and simply as possible.
This is, apparently, not a sentiment ever internalised by Andrew Wilson, EA&#x27;s CEO. Yesterday, when he announced to everyone at EA that a bunch of them were losing their jobs (again), he first spent three paragraphs talking about how EA is doing great, leading the industry, getting increasing engagement from fans, optimising their global footprint and sunsetting games oh yep, there it is, that&#x27;s the &quot;you&#x27;re about to be unemployed&quot; language right there. The company is moving away from &quot;the development of future licensed IP&quot; and toward &quot;our owned IP, sports, and massive online communities&quot;. Therefore: 670 ish devs (by Eurogamer&#x27;s count) must go.

But we weren&#x27;t expecting to see new additions quite so quickly, as rideable mechs have been spotted in the wilds. When are they actually being added to the game? No idea. Do they look cool as heck? Yes, absolutely.

Fly the plane through the field using its propeller as a scythe, with hardier types of wheat requiring tougher propeller blades. Need to haul up scavenge from the ocean floor? Use the plane&#x27;s sea anchor as a rudimentary fishing claw. Need to open a box you found on the beach? The plane&#x27;s the thing, etcetera.

WarioWare: Move It! came to Switch in 2023 and threw us back into the wild world of wacky minigames. Those who enjoyed the experience might want to check out SUPER 56, which launches on Switch later this year and looks to be just as bonkers.
From indie development team Onion Soup Interactive and publisher WhisperGames, SUPER 56 offers a collection of one-button minigames (56 of them, would you believe) for you to drive, fish, date, catch and generally laugh your way through. It doesn&#x27;t seem to quite match the &#x27;Act like a chicken&#x27; level of humiliation in the WarioWare series, but is that really such a bad thing?

Today, 29th February, is Leap Day. It&#x27;s the special occasion that only rolls around once every four years and leaves plenty of room for an extra 24 hours of surprises. Well, it looks like the surprises are coming thick and fast for Theatrhythm Final Bar Line players. Namely, the game won&#x27;t work.
This phenomenon was first spotted by Vooks, which reported that Square Enix&#x27;s latest rhythm game simply would not connect to the relevant servers when booting up, getting stuck on a &quot;Connecting...&quot; message and leaving the game unplayable.

                              <span>Retro revival.
For many younger gamers, the idea that Atari was once the undisputed king of console gaming might seem somewhat farfetched. Yet in the late &#x27;70s and early &#x27;80s, the gaming giant dominated the market with the Atari 2600, introducing audiences to the likes of Adventure, Yars&#x27; Revenge, and Haunted House. However, after a wave of shovelware and some poor management decisions, the video game market crashed in 1983 and was seemingly done for. Until a little company called Nintendo stepped in, that is.
Since then, the Atari brand has struggled to regain its footing in the industry, but with the appointment of Wade Rosen as its CEO in 2021, the company is heading in a decidedly focused direction, leveraging its broad history and expertise in retro gaming to tap into an increasingly growing interest in older games amongst the community.

Embracer Group is continuing to cull its catalogue of developers, but this time it sounds like it might be good news, as Saber Interactive will reportedly be splitting from Embracer in a deal worth $500 million.
As reported by Bloomberg (thanks, Gematsu), the deal will result in Saber Interactive becoming a privately owned company with around 3500 employees. It&#x27;s reported that Saber itself will continue to work on the remake of STAR WARS: Knights of the Old Republic, which changes hands from its own subsidiary, Aspyr.

THQ Nordic has finally unveiled the release date for its open-world RPG Biomutant on Switch. It&#x27;s only a few months away, too, launching on 14th May, 2024.
Originally released for the PS4, Xbox One, and Windows in 2021, the game was subsequently ported to the PS5 and Seriex X/S the following year, making this release on the Nintendo Switch a little late to the party, but a welcome addition nonetheless.

Developed by Misty Mountain Studio, Death Trick will see you playing from two different perspectives — a magician and a detective — as you attempt to crack the case of the circus&#x27; missing star. You&#x27;ll be interviewing other performers, poking holes in their stories and looking for clues to get to the bottom of what really happened.

                              <span>A Penny for your thoughts.
It’s now been nearly seven years (yes, really) since the release of Sonic Mania, which indisputably marked a high point for Sega’s troubled blue mascot. Much of the game&#x27;s success could be attributed to the team of passionate and talented fans (led by Christian Whitehead) that came together to develop it, but rather than coast on their success by producing the Sonic Mania 2 that many fans expected, this team instead rebranded themselves as a boutique studio called Evening Star and set out to launch their own IP with a new 3D platformer called Penny’s Big Breakaway.
Though the influence of the Blue Blur is immediately apparent in Penny&#x27;s Big Breakaway&#x27;s design, Evening Star&#x27;s debut adventure very much feels like it asserts its own identity. Some minor performance quirks aside, this is a spectacular, creative, unique, and deeply enjoyable new entry in the 3D platforming genre that no fan will want to miss.

CachyOS takes to leveraging compiler optimizations like Link-Time Optimizations (LTO), the BORE scheduler, and also offering package archives compiled for x86-64-v3 and x86-64-v4 in allowing the distribution&#x27;s packages to be catered toward newer Intel and AMD processors. In this article is a comparison of CachyOS packages from their main archive, the x86-64-v3 optimized packages, and then the x86-64-v4 wares that can be beneficial for modern Intel Xeon and AMD EPYC / AMD Ryzen systems.</span>

HDMI je uzavřené, licenčními poplatky a armádou právníků chráněné, ale bez problémů koupíte 20metrový kabel, co protlačí 8k video za 1300Kč (používá optický přenos), či za pár stovek 5metrovou metalickou variantu, též pro 8k/60Hz – jde právě o HDMI 2.1.</span>

Taking place over multiple continents on the Planet (or Gaia as it was retroacively called) with various party members, a bunch of open-world areas, and lots of side activities and minigames to partake in, you&#x27;re going to be playing this game for at least 50 to 60 hours before you roll credits (I reached the ending at 80 hours). 
When you&#x27;ve seen the story through, you might not be ready to hang up the ole&#x27; Buster Sword. Fortunately, Rebirth has New Game Plus. Well, kinda – it&#x27;s complicated.

However, regardless of whether you&#x27;re a long-time fan or not, one thing new to everyone playing Rebirth is Queen&#x27;s Blood. 
Introduced early in Rebirth, Queen&#x27;s Blood is an in-universe card game that seemingly everyone around Gaia&#x27;s various continents plays, from Junon to Nibelheim and elsewhere. And after spending dozens of hours playing it, I can understand why - it rules. It&#x27;s easily my favorite game-within-a-game ever, and one I hope spins out into its own thing in some form, be it a digital card game, a physical one, or something else. 
It can be a difficult game, thou…</span>

                              <span>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is chock full of activities to do when you aren&#x27;t controlling Cloud, chasing after Sephiroth, and trying to save the planet. With multiple open world zones to explore, there are dozens of objectives to complete ranging from Queen&#x27;s Blood matches to treasure caches to combat challenges and more. It&#x27;s safe to say completing everything Rebirth offers will take 100 or more hours, and that&#x27;s before you add in dozens of minigames to the game&#x27;s slew of offerings. 
With so much stuff to do, though, not everything sticks the landing and that goes for side quests too, which range from fine and forgettable to great. If you&#x27;re looking to get the Platinum trophy, you&#x27;ll need to complete every side quest, but if you&#x27;re just trying to play through the game&#x27;s best offerings, we h…</span>

                              <span>Remedy Entertainment, which released Alan Wake 2 to critical acclaim in October, has acquired the full rights to the Control franchise from publisher 505 Games. Released in 2019, Remedy developed Control but it was published by 505 Games, which also had a stake in the franchise&#x27;s rights at the time. Now, after a roughly $18.4 million purchase, the entirety of the Control franchise belongs to Remedy. 
This includes the original Control game, its in-development sequel Control 2, the multiplayer spin-off Project Condor, and all future Control products. 


&quot;The Control franchise is in the core of Remedy,&quot; the studio writes in a statement released today. &quot;Having acquired the full rights to Control, Condor, and Control 2, Remedy is now in a position to make the right product and business decisio…</span>

I’m not a poker player. I’ve never learned the game, and my limited knowledge of it largely stems from pop culture osmosis, such as James Bond films and referential quips from X-Men’s Gambit. I couldn’t tell you what makes a Royal Flush, but I know it’s good to have it. Despite its premise and appearance, Balatro technically isn’t poker. It is, however, the first title to make me understand and enjoy the core premise of the card game. It also happens to be one of the most engrossing games of the year.

                              <span>Life is Strange: True Colors developer Deck Nine has announced it is laying off 20 percent of its staff. In the statement announcing this news, Deck Nine didn&#x27;t name a specific reason for the layoffs, instead stating the studio has been affected by the industry&#x27;s worsening conditions. Twenty percent of Deck Nine&#x27;s staff is equal to roughly 30 employees, according to a report from Eurogamer. 
Here&#x27;s Deck Nine&#x27;s statement, in full: 


Deck Nine game director Stephan Frost said on X (formerly Twitter) that leadership within the studio took pay cuts to keep the number of layoffs down as much as possible. &quot;This is the strongest team [Deck Nine] has ever been and it absolutely sucks that the industry is in the state that it is presently,&quot; Frost adds.

                              <span>NetEase Games has pulled back the curtains on its newest studio, BulletFarm. Led by David Vonderhaar, whose experience includes leading the teams behind the Call of Duty: Black Ops series, BulletFarm aims to develop a new triple-A game that utilizes first-person gameplay with an emphasis on co-op in Unreal Engine 5. It will be set in an original universe. 
This unannounced and untitled game will &quot;craft a more intimate and relatable experience while offering a fresh take on first-person gameplay,&quot; according to a press release. 
BulletFarm is taking a remote-first approach to game development but considers itself a triple-A studio headquartered in Los Angeles, California. Joining Vonderhaar is the studio&#x27;s creative director Chris Cowell. The studio is currently looking to hire in various roles to fill out the founding team. 

&quot;Starting this new studio has given me a chance to step out of my comfort zone and try my hand at making something entirely new and different,&quot; Vonderhaar writes in a press release. &quot;This is a departure from the games I&#x27;ve worked on, but one that showcases my passion for rich characters, precise mechanics, more intimate storytelling, and plenty of action. NetEase has provided us an incredible support structure to explore these new avenues and allow true freedom to begin building the concept and ideas for our game.&quot; 
NetEase president of global investments and partnerships Simon Zhu says the company is fully dedicated to giving BulletFarm the resources and support it requires to build its new first-person experience. &quot;David&#x27;s leadership and the early collection of game development talent assembled at the studio is set to offer something truly unique for his existing fans along with a new audience.&quot; 
BulletFarm is currently developing its first title, but there&#x27;s no word on when to expect to see it.

                              <span>Could there be a more than universally relatable quote shared by indie developers than: &quot;We really just wanted to make a small game&quot;? Of course, there&#x27;s little to complain about when games like Cuphead or Owlboy finally see the light of the day, demonstrating what wonders growing ambition can often bring.
Having said that, I’m not entirely surprised that Vladimir Semenets, the lead game designer of Militsioner, sits in front of me on Zoom and tells me how they initially envisioned a six-month project, &quot;something very fast&quot;. Yet, here we are, three years and more than a dozen developer vlogs since TallBoys&#x27; surreal runaway sim first captured everyone&#x27;s attention (including one state-owned Russian news channel). If not for its Kafkaesque premise, which pits players against a ten-story tall looming policeman in a quest to escape a small town, then definitely because of the game’s ambitious voice recognition feature that promised real-time conversation instead of pre-written dialogue.

                              <span>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve fully recovered from my time with Skull And Bones, having suffered tremendously as a result of the review. There might be fun in some of its slower moments, but some of the generally positive, &quot;It&#x27;s actually quite a good game!&quot; takes that I&#x27;ve seen honestly baffle me. The game is a series of long, annoying journeys, during which the most fun I had was turning my head to watch Catfish on my other monitor. MTV&#x27;s show about people getting duped online was the perfect sailing companion, and perhaps, one of the only reasons I survived my brush with the live service seas.

                              <span>If you were to buy every Stellaris expansion and content pack separately at full price, it would run you £227.62. To make that perhaps a little less daunting, Paradox have launched an optional monthly subscription service that gives you access to all the expansions. They&#x27;ve done this for several of their other grand strategy games before. It starts at £8.50 for one month then offers discounts for longer terms. While I can see niche uses for the option, I certainly wouldn&#x27;t want to pay for this regularly. Would you?

                              <span>A long time ago on a desktop far, far away, my family once owned a demo disc for the original Star Wars: Dark Forces. I cannot remember for the life of me which level(s) it contained. My only surviving memory of it is having quite a good time blasting Stormtroopers and the chaps in black with the swoopy, knock-off Vader helmets, but also getting terribly lost and not really knowing what the heck I was meant to be doing. Now, playing Nightdive Studio&#x27;s Star Wars: Dark Forces Remaster as an adult probably close to three decades later, both these feelings have come roaring back, as this is very much a Star Wars FPS in the vein of Doom and other early 90s shooters (thumbs up). But it&#x27;s one that leans so hard into its maze-like level design that it can regularly feel like a little bit of a tough hang in the cold hard light of 2024 (thumbs down).
Crucially, though, not to the point where it&#x27;s best left consigned to the history books. This is still an enjoyable and worthwhile artefact in Star Wars&#x27; PC gaming history, and if your eyes (and general patience levels) can&#x27;t quite stomach the &#x27;Classic&#x27; and still available 1995 original, then this remaster is a pin-sharp glow-up for modern hardware.

A first step on the path to buying a bunch of miniatures. It&#x27;s out now, for £6.50/$8/€8 on Steam, and it&#x27;s very fun.

Expect bug fixes and quality-of-live improvements soon, then new challenging fights later. The developers, Eleventh Hour Games say they&#x27;re &quot;going to have a heavy emphasis on expanding end-game content&quot;. But first, yes, more fixes and improvements to the servers which suffered and stumbled.

Patch 1.2 is the latest of the bunch, and when it arrives next week it&#x27;s bringing with it a &quot;consumption/production&quot; window, upgrades to the Blight Post, and lots of balance changes.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been a hot minute since we last wrote about UFO 50, the 50-games-in-1 8-bit retro collection from the makers of Spelunky, Downwell and friends. It&#x27;s been MIA for several years now (and no wonder, given these are 50 full-sized games being made by several different, and likely very busy, developers), but at long last, Spelunky creator Derek Yu has posted an update on Steam saying the project is finally nearing completion. &quot;We should have a complete game in a few months but are planning for a release in the second half of the year to give us time to do more testing and then marketing,&quot; he said.

                              <span>DarkStone Digital, solo developer of The Mortary Assistant, is making a new horror game based on Paramount&#x27;s Paranormal Activity films. Titled Paranormal Activity: Found Footage, it&#x27;s being published by DreadXP and features some kind of reactive haunt system, with scares dialling up and down based on your actions. DreadXP have shared a teaser consisting of some crackly logos against a backdrop of radio chatter. Given that this is a Paranormal Activity adaptation, it&#x27;s possible the trailer harbours spooky secrets. You may wish to experiment with turning the brightness up and down, playing the video backwards, or watching it again at the next full moon, perhaps while standing in a cemetery loudly declaring that ghosts aren&#x27;t real.

                              <span>Given its zero-tolerance approach to piracy, Nintendo&#x27;s copyright lawsuit targeting the company behind Switch emulator &#x27;Yuzu&#x27; isn&#x27;t a big surprise. While the 41-page complaint throws almost everything at the hugely popular Switch emulation project, Nintendo&#x27;s focus on specific functionality plus knowledge, conduct, and intent, seems to avoid a direct assault on general emulation. It could cover the entire scene with banana peels, however.

The video track of the eighth episode, which is scheduled to be released next week, showed up on pirate sites as the latest release of another Apple series, &quot;The New Look&quot;. Pirate release groups were swift to fix the &#x27;mistake&#x27; but, now that it&#x27;s out, the leak can&#x27;t be unseen.

It&#x27;s probably a symptom of my failings as an astronomer, but I have to say that at no point have I noticed any gigantic, depressed clowns. In new platformer Clown Meat, one such gigantic, depressed clown has swum through Jupiter&#x27;s atmosphere, drifted to Earth and kicked off some kind of meatpunk apocalypse, saturating the surrounding countryside with circus-themed abominations.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve had to look up.... goddamn it, hang on. I&#x27;ve had to look up Wrath Colon Aeon Of Ruin every day to remember its utter nothing of a name. Such a weak title deserves a much worse game, but this captures the feeling of its late 90s FPS influences as they actually were, and ends up just familiar enough to work, and just original enough to refresh the formula. At times, it&#x27;s a little too accurate, but even with its annoyances dialled up by the pressure of playing it too hard for the sake of review, I&#x27;m impressed with the balancing act it&#x27;s struck.

                              <span>Since I’m apparently on survival game duty for the rest of my days, and we’ve just had a firm reminder of how wobbly an early access launch can be, it seems like a good time to check in on that there Sons Of The Forest 1.0 release and see whether it’s felt the effects of its own early access polishing process.

The PC version - the one we care about - is arriving on the 19th of March, and consoles and mobile as soon as possible after that. The actual content of update 1.6 is largely a mystery, but Barone has teased a few things here and there, including that it&#x27;s &quot;mostly changers for modders&quot; that&#x27;ll make it &quot;easier and more powerful to mod&quot;.

                              <span>I seem to be on a highly irritating &quot;refuse to play games as they were intended to be played&quot; spree lately. A couple of weeks ago, it was &quot;I refuse to leave the prologue area in Skull And Bones&quot;, a decision that has sadly been born out by Ed&#x27;s review. Then it was &quot;I refuse to play Helldivers 2 as a co-op shooter&quot;, which again, is a stance I am sticking with, even as I am overrun and sat on by Terminid Chargers. And now it&#x27;s &quot;I refuse to play Cobalt Core as a roguelike deck-builder, because it secretly isn&#x27;t one&quot;. Come now, squint at the header image so that the text and numbers fade away, and all you can see are coloured shapes. Pay attention to certain underlying rhythms while playing. Need I say any more?

Today it&#x27;s Sony&#x27;s turn with the axe: the PlayStation publisher have announced plans to reduce their global workforce by about 8% or 900 people, so as &quot;to future ready ourselves to set the business up for what lies ahead&quot;, in the words of outgoing president and CEO Jim Ryan.
Several well-known PlayStation studios are affected, including The Last Of Us developer Naughty Dog, Ratchet &amp; Clank developer Insomniac Games, Horizon developer Guerilla Games and PlayStation VR specialists Firesprite. It&#x27;s also proposed that PlayStation close Sony London in their entirety, though the exact scale of the reductions remains to be seen.

                              <span>While players have scoured and stained every inch of the Lands Between in the two years since Elden Ring launched, they might not have uncovered every secret just yet. With a June release now confirmed for Shadow Of The Erdtree, the long-awaited expansion, director Hidetaka Miyazaki has now hinted that we Tarnished may have missed something. One small secret may yet remain, assuming he&#x27;s not pulling another prank, or maybe not. Honestly, Miyazaki should say it has hundreds of undiscovered things. Keep everyone guessing. Communal Internet knowledge has ruined the mystique of video games.

                              <span>Last night I dreamt I had to review a Dragon Age DLC. I reviewed it poorly. I thought that it should not have been marketed as main game DLC instalment when it pivoted to being a magical girl dating sim. This serves to show how unrealistic dreams can be; in my waking hours I am, of course, of the clear-eyed awareness that a magical girl dating sim is entirely in-keeping with the rest of the Dragon Age oeuvre.
I&#x27;m worried about Dragon Age. I&#x27;m worried that so much cost has been sunk, team members changed and redrafting did that it&#x27;ll end up kind of a mess. But that&#x27;s the pessimism talking. What I&#x27;d like to propose is that all the big game companies have a crack at something similar to Amazon&#x27;s (hiliarious and abortive) attempt to officially license fan fiction, which was called Kindle Worlds.

Textbooks, flashcards, even watching Japanese media can all feel a bit too close to being back in a classroom. Shashingo, a game that helps you learn Japanese through taking cute photos, may be the study companion I&#x27;ve craved. And having covered it two years ago when it was first properly shown off, I&#x27;m very happy to see it&#x27;s finally arriving later today.

                              <span>Out of all the Nintendo Direct announcements last week, the one I was most sad to see not get a PC release date was the sequel to the much beloved Metroidvania Ender Lilies. The announcement came as a bit of a surprise, all told, and I was worried I&#x27;d have to consign it to what I&#x27;ve now dubbed my Unicorn Overlord pile of games that are never coming to PC. Happily, publishers Binary Haze Interactive have now confirmed that Ender Magnolia: Bloom In The Mist is, in fact, coming to PC (and other consoles) after all, and that it&#x27;s coming real soon, as its PC early access release has been set for just weeks away on March 25th. Result.

                              <span>Just when you thought it was safe to go back into the Palwoods, Pocketpair have revealed a new Palworld update - Steam and Xbox patch v0.1.5.0. This is a larger overhaul, encompassing a juicy mixture of balance and technical tweaks that together make this spring&#x27;s breakout survival game easier to play, less buggy and, dare I say, a little kinder, with various tweaks aimed at making life more liveable both for trainers and Pals. I have run my eye over the changelog at the bottom of this page and picked out a few highlights, like somebody fishing a stray banknote from the laundry.

                              <span>“Ever since the very first Yakuza on PS2, the Like A Dragon series has always tried to capture the cultural zeitgeist of Japan, reflecting and satirising whatever’s trending around when the game comes out. This means that the way people speak in Like A Dragon is constantly evolving to match the times,” says Dan Sunstrum, senior translator at Ryu Ga Gotoku’s localisation team. Keeping things current is, says Sunstrum, “a challenge in some ways but also means we’re justified in using modern English slang to match, whereas such modernisms might feel out of place in a game set in a completely fictional world.”
Sunstrum uses an example from the studio’s latest, RPS Bestest Best winning RPG Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth, where permed protagonist Ichiban Kasuga meets a dating app designer. “The app’s creator goes on a mini-rant about ungrateful, entitled users, complaining how when anything goes wrong they’re quick to demand wabi-ishi,” slang for free premium currency. “This would have been a tricky word to localise, but it was made easy by the fact that fans of gacha games had already done it for us: they refer to them as ‘apologems’, and that’s what we ended up using in the game.”

                              <span>A massive sweep of layoffs has rocked various Sony first-party studios today, including Naughty Dog, Guerilla Games, and Insomniac. Another victim is Firesprite Games, the UK studio behind The Playroom games and The Persistence, and an additional casualty from that studio is reportedly a new Twisted Metal title.
According to Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier, Firesprite had a Twisted Metal game in the works that has now been canceled. He reports that the game was a live-service title and very early in development, so it was not yet officially greenlit. You can read his full report here. 
NEW: As part of today&#x27;s mass layoff, Sony has canceled a Twisted Metal live-service game that was in development at UK-based studio Firesprite, Bloomberg has learned.

February 27, 2024
Twisted Metal was PlayStation’s original flagship series, launching a couple of months after the PS1 was released in North America in the fall of 1995. The series includes eight sequels/spin-offs, the last of which remains the 2012 reboot for PS3. Peacock’s well-received live-action series has at least kept the series alive and is getting a second season. 
The number of layoffs to hit Firespirte is currently unknown. Sony acquired Firesprite in 2021, where it helped co-develop Horizon Call of the Mountain with Guerrilla Games. 900 employees have been laid off across several Sony 1st-party studios in various department. Blood &amp; Truth creators London Studio has been shut down entirely. PlayStation Studios Hermen Hulst has cited overgrowth as the reason for the layoffs, and that the publisher has examined its portfolio of upcoming projects to determine which ones will cease production. It would appear that whatever this Twisted Metal project would have been, it&#x27;s among several titles getting the axe.

                              <span>A video game based on the Paranormal Activity film franchise has been announced. Developed by Darkstone Digital, makers of the 2022 horror game The Mortuary Assistant, along with publisher DreadXP and Paramount Pictures, the upcoming game is slated to release in 2026. 
Like the films, Paranormal Activity will feature found-footage-style gameplay as well as a “Haunt System,” which dynamically changes the types of scares that unfold based on players’ actions. Unfortunately, a brief teaser trailer doesn’t do much but show some logos, so we may be waiting a while to see the game in action. 


“We are thrilled to work with Paramount Game Studios and to have the opportunity to bring the world of Paranormal Activity to gamers everywhere,” said Epic Pictures CEO and DreadXP producer Patrick Ewald in a press release. “The films are steeped in rich lore and creative scares, and under the stewardship of creative director Brian Clarke, DreadXP’s Paranormal Activity video game will honor those core tenets and offer horror fans one of our most terrifying games yet.”
Paranormal Activity has no announced platforms. It’s not the franchise’s first foray into video games. A 2017 game called Paranormal Activity: The Lost Soul was released for PS4 and PC and was playable in VR.</span>

                              <span>After recently revealing the full launch roster for WWE 2K24, we now know the superstars arriving post-launch. 2K has revealed the five DLC packs rolling out throughout the year, and they include the Best in the World, one of the biggest female superstar signings in recent memory, and even a Grammy-nominated recording artist. 
CM Punk headlines this DLC roster, marking his first appearance in a WWE game since WWE 2K15 in 2014 (the year he walked out of the company). It would appear the Voice of the Voiceless’ recent social media campaign to be included in the 2K24’s DLC plans paid off faster than expected, and he’s part of the first pack, no less. I smell a work, but it’s good to have him back in an official in-game capacity, regardless.
Other big highlights include Jade Cargill, Pat McAfee, and 2K24 soundtrack curator and award-winning music artist Post Malone. Check out the full list of superstars in each pack below.

                              <span>While the main headline event from today&#x27;s Pokémon Presents showcase was the announcement of Pokémon Legends: Z-A, it wasn&#x27;t the only new game that got announced. It shares that status with Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket, a new mobile game that allows players to collect, trade, and battle with the franchise&#x27;s signature trading cards.
Check out the reveal trailer below:


While there are several features available in the game, Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket seems to focus the most on the collection aspect, which is fitting given the renaissance of physical card games in recent years. While no details on microtransactions are given, the end of the trailer notes that players will get two free packs a day – implying that more than that might come at a cost.
You&#x27;ll also be able to trade cards with other players and battle them online as well. The trailer also shows off immersive cards, which seem to feature a 3D cinematic inside the cards.
The app is being developed by DeNA (best known for their work on Pokémon Masters) and is due out sometime later this year. For more Pokémon cards, check out our Trading Card hub, which features some of our favorite pulls from the game&#x27;s big releases.</span>

                              <span>Sony Interactive Entertainment has announced layoffs at various PlayStation first-party studios, including Insomniac Games (Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man), Naughty Dog (The Last of Us Part II), Guerrilla Games (Horizon Forbidden West), and Firesprite. It is also closing London Studio, the team behind PlayStation VR&#x27;s Blood &amp; Truth and VR Worlds. In a statement released by head of PlayStation Studios Hermen Hulst, he seems to cite overgrowth as the reason for the layoffs. 
PlayStation&#x27;s Technology, Creative, and Support teams are also affected by these layoffs, according to Hulst. He writes, &quot;These are in addition to some smaller reductions in other teams across PlayStation Studios.&quot; These layoffs will result in an 8 percent reduction of staff, or around 900 people losing their jobs.

                              <span>During today&#x27;s Pokémon Presents stream celebrating Pokémon Day, we got our first look at the next major title coming to the Nintendo Switch. Called Pokémon Legends: Z-A, the teaser suggests the game will be set in Lumiose City, a Paris-inspired area first seen in Pokémon X and Y. It&#x27;s not just a long-awaited follow up to Pokémon Legends: Arceus – it&#x27;s an overdue return to the world of Pokémon X and Y.
Check out some images from the trailer below:

The teaser, which does not contain any actual gameplay footage, shows a Pikachu hopping around a city made of glowing blue lines. While it&#x27;s not immediately clear that the city is Lumiose, eagle-eyed fans will notice many familiar friends from that generation of games, including Pyroar, Flabébé, Klefki, and Hawlucha. These images are juxtaposed with architectural sketches and the words &quot;urban redevelopment plan.&quot; This would suggest that Pokémon Legends Z might take place during the construction of Lumiose City, putting it in line with the historical setting we experienced with Pokémon Legends: Arceus.
Other than the teaser, details are scarce. We&#x27;ll have to wait until 2025 to see more. Speaking of 2025, we also recently heard reports that Nintendo&#x27;s Switch successor will come out no sooner than March of that year. For more Pokémon Legends, check out our review of Legends: Arceus, which we called &quot;a worthwhile spin-off adventure.&quot;

Now, the companies have unveiled a new way to experience Lego in Fortnite: Lego Islands. Available today, Lego Islands is a family-friendly, all-ages play experience that sits alongside (and separate) from Lego Fortnite, and it&#x27;s kicking off with two islands. 
The first is Lego Raft Survival. Created in Unreal Editor for Fortnite, Raft Survival &quot;combines frenetic multiplayer problem solving with the classic Lego Pirates theme, as the infamous Blackbeard challenges players and their friends to stay afloat on a raft in unfriendly waters,&quot; a press release reads.

The order requires ISPs to block dozens of pirate sites and also applies to domain name registrars, including the American company Namecheap.

On Saturday, at least one Cloudflare IP address was added to the Piracy Shield anti-piracy system. According to an expert, that ended up blocking a large number of websites, including a charity, a telecoms company, and several schools. It&#x27;s the outcome many people predicted but one that could&#x27;ve been easily avoided.

However, it wasn’t until its 2019 release, 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim, that the developer’s name became synonymous with “you should play this team’s games.” It’s hard to tell what, exactly, made 13 Sentinels the breakout title for Vanillaware, shipping more than 1 million copies worldwide as of August last year, making it the studio’s best-selling title. The easy answer is probably its beloved story, both in how it plays out and how it’s infused into the game’s real-time strategy mech combat.
Publisher Atlus and Vanillaware released it in 2019, so when the team announced its latest title, Unicorn Overlord, last September, it was easy to conclude that this was the studio’s next big focus. And it is, but curi…</span>

                              <span>During last week’s Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase, it was revealed that the 2021 action Metroidvania Ender Lilies: Quietus of the Knight is getting a sequel in the form of Ender Magnolia: Bloom of the Mist. The initial trailer provided a vague 2024 launch window, but we now know it&#x27;s hitting Steam Early Access first on March 26. 
Ender Magnolia: Bloom in the Mist is set within the same universe as Ender Lilies but takes place in the magically saturated Land of Fumes. A mind-warping toxin has been unleashed from the magic-infused soil and dangerous Homunguli ravages the land. It’s up to protagonist Lilac, an “Attunder” capable of cleansing Homunguli, to save the day. You can check out the game&#x27;s new trailer below.


Like Ender Lilies, Ender Magnolia is a dark fantasy Metroidvania in which Lilac is paired with another entity who actually handles the killing: a Spirit Reaper capable of killing Homunguli, which, in turn, adds their abilities to your arsenal. The sprawling 2D adventure tasks players with discovering hidden collectibles, gear, and items to bolster their ability to tackle a variety of bosses.
While it’s unknown exactly how long Ender Magnolia will be in Early Access, Ender Lilies also went through an Early Access phase that wound up working to the game&#x27;s benefit. Ender Magnolia: Bloom in the Mist is slated to launch for PlayStation and Xbox platforms as well as Switch later this year. In the meantime, you can read our positive review of the Ender Lilies: Quietus of the Knight here.</span>

                              <span>Supermassive Games, the developer behind Until Dawn, The Quarry, and the upcoming Little Nightmares III, is laying off roughly 90 employees, according to a new report from Bloomberg. The publication reports that 150 staff members at the British studio were informed today they are &quot;at risk&quot; of being laid off in accordance with U.K. labor laws that require companies to give notice ahead of layoffs. 
Shortly after Bloomberg&#x27;s report went live, the studio tweeted the following statement:

Bloomberg reports that Supermassive is made up of 300 employees, meaning laying off 90 people would equal a roughly 30 percent reduction in staff. Despite developing PlayStation exclusives like Until Dawn, Supermassive is part o…</span>

You can check out our full rundown of everything announced during the Partner Showcase here. However, Reynatis, a really cool-looking action game set in a modern-day Tokyo, was not shown. 
It appeared during the Japanese version of the Partner Showcase, though, and the game quickly picked up steam online, thanks to its cool visual style, over-the-top action, and music by Final Fantasy XV composer Yoko Shimomura. Despite its absence on the English version of the Partner Showcase, we now know Reynatis is coming West later this year.

                              <span>Nier series creator Yoko Taro reportedly teased a third Nier game during the Nier: Orchestra Concert earlier this month. As reported by Eurogamer, during the concert, which celebrated the Nier series&#x27; music in London, Taro apparently made a surprise appearance and asked for people to clap and cheer as loudly as they could so that Square Enix president Takashi Kiryu – in attendance – could hear the demand for more Nier, according to one fan at the event. 
However, the biggest tease of the night came from an on-screen word that appeared multiple times throughout &quot;the story of the show,&quot; SanTheSly, the fan in attendance, writes on ResetEra. 


&quot;[The] word REPENT was shown repeatedly as part of some dialogue,&quot; SanTheSly writes. &quot;The final instance was spelled as R3PENT. Both me and the person I&#x27;d gone with picked up on it and wondered if this was a tease.&quot; 
That sounds like a tease to us; otherwise, why else change the word &quot;repent&quot; to randomly feature a &quot;3.&quot; However, some fans of the series already consider Nier Reincarnataion, a mobile gacha game shutting down in April, to be the third game in the series. On that timeline, Nier (and its remastered Nier: Replicant counterpart) is the first in the franchise and Nier: Automata the second. If Nier Reincarnation isn&#x27;t the true third Nier game, perhaps Taro was teasing that could be on the way – Nier Repent does have a nice ring to it.

                              <span>Japanese outlet Nikkei is reporting that the Switch successor, or &quot;Switch 2&quot; as it&#x27;s been dubbed colloquially within the games industry, is targeting a March 2025 launch, according to VideoGamesChronicle. This report follows earlier reporting from VGC and other outlets like Eurogamer that Nintendo&#x27;s next console was originally targeting a 2024 launch before being pushed internally to the first quarter of 2025, which lines up with Nikkei&#x27;s latest reporting. 


VGC reports that Nikkei writes, &quot;Priority was given to ensure the initial inventory of the successor console and a lineup of software titles at the time of its launch&quot; to curb the possibility of a stock shortage similar to what the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S experienced back in 2020. Following previous reports, Nikkei also writes that Nintendo&#x27;s next console will be a hybrid home console-portable device like the Switch with a larger screen. 
Finally, Nikkei writes the internal target is March 2025 but that the Switch 2 could slip beyond that depending on manufacturing and the software available for the console&#x27;s launch at that time, according to VGC. If it does launch in March of next year, it&#x27;d follow in the Switch&#x27;s footsteps, which launched in March of 2017.
It&#x27;s important to note that all of this should be taken with a grain of salt as these delays remain internal for the time being. The Switch&#x27;s successor hasn&#x27;t even been publicly revealed yet, so there&#x27;s no telling when to expect it officially. In the meantime, though, read about how Nintendo reportedly demoed the Switch successor to developers at Gamescom last year.

                              <span>When it launched last June, Street Fighter 6  immediately earned critical acclaim, differentiating itself from its predecessor. With 18 fighters and a wealth of single-player content on offer, Street Fighter 6 gave players plenty to enjoy in its earliest days, but that’s not stopping the team from pursuing a post-launch content plan similar to the one that eventually righted the ship with Street Fighter V. Last July, the SFV debutant Rashid joined the roster, followed by new challenger AKI in September. During Capcom Cup X, we went hands on with Ed, the latest Street Fighter 6 DLC character, before he joins the fight this week.
Ed first appeared as a non-playable character in Street Fighter IV before joining the actual roster in the second wave of Street Fighter V’s DLC. Raised by Shadaloo…</span>

                              <span>What the Car? is a zany racing game in which you are a car with legs that must race around various courses to get the best time possible. Except sometimes you’re not just a car with legs, you’re also a car with a jetpack. Or with wings. Or swimming. Or singing. It’s from the folks behind the similarly absurd What the Golf?, and it’s coming to Steam this year.

While Uematsu didn’t rule out creating the main themes for future games, he said that his days of scoring an entire game are likely over - leaving his last complete soundtrack as the OST for mobile-exclusive RPG Fantasian.

                              <span>The roguelikelike deck-building poker game Balatro is frankly the only game I care for right now. My head fizzes with ideas for fiendish combos and deeply illegal hands. I&#x27;m delighted by its deserved success, with the makers boasting that it sold enough to become profitable within one hour then sold 250,000 copies in 72 hours. In a recent interview, the developer claims that part of why it&#x27;s so damn successful is because they&#x27;ve barely played other roguelikelike deckbuilders so it&#x27;s free to do its own thing outside genre conventions. What&#x27;s interesting to me in this is how Balatro has built on a game which did influence it, the slot machine-building game Luck Be A Landlord.

                              <span>Sometimes I wonder whether every genre fantasy RPG or RPG-inflected game is essentially a journey towards the Big City. Most such games start you off on the periphery of the world, out in the sleepy and/or brutish hamlets of FirstActShire, Chosen One County, and send you on a loose quest towards the cosmopolitan centre, where you&#x27;ll typically learn about the ultimate villain of the piece, gain access to the juiciest concentration of shops, crafting facilities and quest-givers, and glean some hint at the location of the endgame dungeon. Sometimes the quest takes days of playtime, as in Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3. Sometimes it takes less than an hour, as in the original Destiny. It&#x27;s a common-enough device that when an RPG starts you off in the Big City, like Dragon Age 2, or creatively &quot;provincialises&quot; the Big City, like Roadwarden, I feel slightly unnerved.

                              <span>2024 continues its efforts to be the worst year in my memory, as delightful indie development studio Die Gute Fabrik have halted work. The studio, notable for its lovely story-driven games about forging personal connections in strange or difficult worlds - e.g. Mutazione and the more recent Saltsea Chronicles - was unable to find funding for its new project, after a year of searching, so is shutting up work. All of the staff, including the leadership team, will be looking for new work come mid-march.

                              <span>Nightingale’s dapper cast of cross-dimensional pathfinders are right about one thing: realmwalking is dangerous business. Attempt to tele-portal between realities on the Steam Deck, for instance, and you may find yourself trapped in the Stygian void, naught but a frozen loading screen tip for company and suspended hopelessly for all eternity. Or until you hold down the power button.
This crashing tendency alone means that while Nightingale can technically run on the Steam Deck, even without resorting to rock-bottom graphics settings, the current early access build isn’t yet ready for regular handheld play. That’s nothing developers Inflexion Games won’t tell you themselves – they’re &quot;not considering [the Deck] officially supported at launch,&quot; after all – but if you were thinking of giving this gaslamp fantasy survival sim a portable whirl, you might want to let that call to adventure go unanswered.

                              <span>Austrian developers Microbird released a new trailer for their upcoming Alpine dungeon-crawler Dungeons Of Hinterberg over the weekend, giving us a closer look at some of the eponymous dungeon environments we&#x27;ll be biffing monsters in come its release later this summer. In addition to the previously revealed mountainsides and glacial snow peaks, it looks like Hinterberg will have a big green swamp to travel to as well. Question is: will it be a poison FromSoft variety of swamp? Or something more innocuous? Hard to tell with that searingly green water on display, but one thing is certain: with Elden Ring: Shadow Of The Erdtree and its confirmed poison swamp launching on June 21st, this summer won&#x27;t be short on big bog energy.

                              <span>When I did my undergrad degree in the nowadays-blissful-seeming early noughties, I swore off videogames entirely. I sternly and sorrowfully turned my back on such hit releases as Shadow of the Colossus, Far Cry and yes, even, that PC gaming essential Half-Life 2, so as to spend 11-hour days boning up on Aeschylus and Samuel Johnson. Then, two weeks before my final exams, I somehow went out and bought Ensemble&#x27;s Age Of Mythology.
I&#x27;m not sure why - blame the devil on my shoulder, I guess. It wasn&#x27;t even a new release at that point. I managed to get good marks in the exams despite several nights of binge-playing, but what direction, in general, would my life have taken if I hadn&#x27;t bought Age Of Mythology at such a fateful hour? Better or worse? Could I have been some kind of billionaire don with a Pulitzer by now, if it weren&#x27;t for Age Of Mythology? These things keep me awake at night. Anyway, here&#x27;s a little more info about the forthcoming reboot Age of Mythology: Retold, which broadly aims to turn this wrinkled titan of the strategy genre into a proper modern esport.

                              <span>New week, yet more videogames! Gosh, those developers are incorrigible. I would characterise this week&#x27;s new game releases as a gentle blend of cosy simulation and nostalgia, served on a bed of fantasy roguelikes. If I had to pick a most-anticipated, it&#x27;d be a toss-up between the remaster of a shooter I adored in my teens and the breezy amateur photography game that teaches you the kanji for &quot;flower&quot;.

Při použití CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE&#x3D;Release se nyní použije přepínač -O2 místo -O3. Jednak není -O3 v případě XZ rychlejší a také výsledná binárka je větší.</span>

                              <span>It&#x27;s been four days since at least 200 .TV domains, many of them linked to pirate sites, suddenly went dark with no explanation. The domains affected by the unprecedented event were all registered at Finland-based registrar Sarek Oy and until late Friday the situation remained grim. However, information provided by Peter Sunde&#x27;s Njalla suggests cause for optimism, potentially in the next few hours or within the next few days.

                              <span>Just three weeks after launch, Italy&#x27;s Piracy Shield blocking system is set for expansion. The news was revealed by the head of AGCOM and local anti-piracy group FAPAV, who also addressed media reports that overblocking is already affecting innocent parties. Those media reports, published by reputable outlets, were dismissed as &quot;fake news.&quot; In reality, the claim that Piracy Shield is &quot;working perfectly&quot; isn&#x27;t just fake, it&#x27;s pure propaganda.

In this post, I’m going to explain how the new pathfinder works and some of the challenges we had to overcome.</span>

                              <span>Developer Team Ninja has released a new behind-the-scenes video for the upcoming PlayStation 5 exclusive, Rise of the Rōnin, and it features new gameplay showing off the game&#x27;s tough and fast action combat. Unsurprisingly, the game continues to look great. 
This new look at the game&#x27;s action features conversation from game producer and director Fumihiko Yasuda and animation lead Kosuke Wakamatsu discussing how Team Ninja approached the combat. They say it started with determining the different ideologies within Rōnin history, why certain individuals fought the way they did, and how that translates to a game aiming to be authentic to the Bakumatsu history. 
Check it the new Rise of the Rōnin gameplay for yourself below:

As we await Death Stranding 2: On The Beach, which is due out on PlayStation 5 in 2025, Disney Plus has dropped a documentary that might tide fans over. Titled Hideo Kojima: Connecting Worlds, this film &quot;explores the creative process behind Hideo Kojima launching his independent studio up to the completion of Death Stranding.&quot;
It was announced last year before debuting at the 2023 Tribeca Film Festival but starting today, you can stream it on Disney Plus.

We haven&#x27;t yet watched it but given Kojima&#x27;s love of movies, we&#x27;re excited to see what a documentary about the man himself is like. The release of Hideo Kojima: Connecting Worlds follows the debut of Grounded II: The Making of the Last of Us Part II, which also provided a behind-the-scenes look at video game development. 
For more, read Game Informer&#x27;s Death Stranding review and then read about why Death Stranding Director&#x27;s Cut is worth another trek across America. After that, watch the latest trailer for Death Stranding 2: On The Beach, which is expectedly weird.

                              <span>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth hits PlayStation 5 exclusively on February 29, but reviews for Square Enix&#x27;s latest entry in its Final Fantasy VII remake trilogy dropped yesterday. We enjoyed the game a lot, and you can read about why in Game Informer&#x27;s Final Fantasy VII Rebirth review. It turns out, a lot of reviewers enjoyed the game too, because at the time of this writing, it&#x27;s the second-highest rated game in the Final Fantasy series on Metacritic, as noted by video game sales analyst Benji-Sales on X (formerly Twitter). 
Currently sitting at a 93 on Metacritic, which aggregates various reviews into a single Metacritic score, only one other Final Fantasy game has been rated higher: Final Fantasy IX on PlayStation 1. It has a 94 on Metacritic.
There’s only 6 Final Fantasy games that have gone above a 90 Metacritic score.

As you can see above, with a 93 on Metacritic, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth joins a prestigious list of games in the series with a Metacritic score of 90 or higher, as pointed out by AndSpaceY on X. Now, it&#x27;s important to note that some Final Fantasy games are not rated on Metacritic as the aggregate site was not around when they released. For example, Final Fantasy VI is one of the most beloved entries in the franchise and arguably the best – released in 1994 on the SNES, Metacritic was not around at the time so it does not have a rating on the site. 
Still, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth rating so high is another example of how Square Enix&#x27;s Final Fantasy VII remake project is landing with both critics and fans alike.

                              <span>Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League, the third-person live-service multiplayer shooter from Batman: Arkham series developer Rocksteady Studios, launched earlier this month. It received middling reviews – read Game Informer&#x27;s review here to find out why we gave it a 6 out of 10 – and fans have been less-than-impressed with the shooter. It seems Warner Bros. Discovery is less-than-impressed, too, as the company said in its latest financial call that Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League had &quot;fallen short of our expectations,&quot; as reported by IGN. 


More specifically, that&#x27;s Warner Bros. Discovery chief financial officer Gunnar Wiedenfels who said Rocksteady&#x27;s latest effort fell short of the company&#x27;s expectations. However, Wiedenfels did not mention a sales figure. According to IGN, the executive lamented that Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League&#x27;s missed expectations set Warner Bros.&#x27; games division up for a tough year when it comes to year-on-year comparisons.
Wiedenfels is likely alluding to Hogwarts Legacy, the company&#x27;s massive hit that launched last year and went on to become the best-selling game of 2023, beating out titles like The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III. The sales of Hogwarts Legacy was certainly a tough act for Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League to follow.

                              <span>Penny&#x27;s Big Breakaway, the momentum-based 3D platformer from developer Evening Star, surprise launched earlier this week after appearing in a Partner Showcase Nintendo Direct. During a livestream held by Evening Star on the game&#x27;s February 21 launch, one designer completed the first level with a single, two-minute combo, and it&#x27;s a feat to behold. 
If you haven&#x27;t yet checked out Penny&#x27;s Big Breakaway, it&#x27;s a 3D platformer modeled off the strange and weird platformers of the PlayStation 1 generation, rather than Nintendo&#x27;s popular platforming efforts. As such, the game features a unique moveset that feels similar to Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater, with a Devil May Cry combo meter to boot. 
Check out the Evening Star developer reach a massive 191-move combo in the first stage of Vanillatown, the first world in Penny&#x27;s Big Breakaway, below: 
Vanillatown 1-1 100% in just 1 combo!?

As you can see, this designer – Milena – completes the first level with one continuous combo. We&#x27;re not sure we&#x27;re quite up to the task but we wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if fans of the game spend time outcomboing this score. Only time will tell. 
Penny&#x27;s Big Breakaway is now available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC.

                              <span>It’s been a long time since Little Devil Inside, a promising survival action RPG from indie developer Neostream, has made any noise. The game’s last substantial update came in October 2021. But after over two years of silence, Neostream has come back with a new trailer and cryptic update hinting at what’s been going on with the team.
As reported by The Indie Informer, Neostream’s Kickstarter post, published yesterday, apologizes for the lack of updates and cryptically alludes to an internal conflict within the team, potentially due to clashing visions about the game, being one of the causes. It states in part,
The rest of Neostream&#x27;s update indicates the team has reduced in size but confirms that the founders and core members remain at the studio. The studio assures backers that Little Devil Inside still exists and that it is currently discussing publishing before it can give fans a more substantial update. Until then, the team has prepared a six-minute montage video showing off the game running in Unreal Engine 5.


Little Devil Inside was first revealed way back in 2015 with the launch of its Kickstarter campaign, but it gained its first mainstream recognition as part of the 2020 PlayStation 5 showcase prior to the console&#x27;s launch. You play as an explorer who embarks on research mission at the behest of a university professor to explore a large world filled with beasts both real and supernatural. You&#x27;ll visit different towns along the way to meet quirky citizens, defend yourself from threats with a sword, and engage in survival mechanics like camping and cooking. Despite how much time as past, we ultimately still know relatively little about Little Devil Inside but it has remained a charmer each time it resurfaces. 
Little Devil Inside has no release window but we&#x27;re hoping to learn more concrete details in the near future.</span>

                              <span>Ubisoft boss Yves Guillemot recently said Skull And Bones is a &quot;quadruple-A game&quot;, which I think is very accurate, actually. &quot;AAAA&quot; is the sound that escapes my lips as I embark on yet another hour-long sail to retrieve some logs, or when I&#x27;m doing my little deliveries and a brigantine starts on me. After 11 years in development, Ubisoft&#x27;s pirate game isn&#x27;t necessarily a disaster, I just think its live service model has transformed piracy from a roguish lark on the waves into a tremendously dull series of shipping tasks.

                              <span>When dramatic parents panicked over the satanic influence of Doom in the 90s, maybe they had a point. Doom has burned through people&#x27;s souls and minds, filling them with a desire to play Id Software&#x27;s seminal shooter on every device they can. The question &quot;Can it run Doom?&quot; has driven these demonic vassals to make it playable on everything from tractors to teletext. These hellbound hearts are even daring to corrupt the totemic device of American liberty: the lawnmower. Come April, you will be able to play Doom on the Husqvarna Nera line of robotic automowers. Is nothing sacred?

But that&#x27;s as it should be: if you want to appreciate what Arrowhead&#x27;s Starship Troop &#x27;em up shares with Konami&#x27;s open world stealth bonanza, it&#x27;s better to Helldive on your lonesome.

                              <span>Lil Guardsman is a game that wears its heart on its sleeve. In a victory for normative determinism, this is a fantasy adventure about a small girl named Lil who somehow becomes the first (and seemingly only) line of defence at a city’s border patrol as a guardsman. At various points, both Lil and those around her frequently call attention to the fact that, yes, you are merely a 12-year-old child who is massively underqualified for this task, and that if you’re going to continue filling in for your good for nothing father who’s down the pub gambling on the latest ball game, then really, what do your superiors expect? It’s very self-aware in that sense, and occasionally verges on breaking the fourth wall. This alone will probably be a fairly good indicator of whether you’ll gel with Lil Guardsman’s sense of humour or not, but for the most part, this is a sweet and jovial narrative adventure whose characterful animation and charming voice cast help bring this oddball tale of fate and consequence to life.
It&#x27;s also not shy about where it’s taken its main source of inspiration from either. This is fantasy Papers, Please through and though, albeit one that’s more about interrogating and probing would-be citygoers for information than checking documents and spotting inconsistencies. During the day you’ll be working your post, dealing with the increasingly large, but fixed queues of fantasy species all trying to enter the city gate to go about their business. When you&#x27;re off the clock, it&#x27;s time to pick up the game&#x27;s wider plotlines, with Lil able to travel around the city to set locations where she can chat with other townsfolk, sometimes partake in the odd mini-game or two, and visit the local shop before toddling off to bed. It’s admittedly quite a straightforward interpretation of Lucas Pope’s magnum opus, with star ratings denoting clear right and wrong answers for how you deal with each day’s horde, but you know what they say about first impressions. Good ones go a long way.

                              <span>I know this sort of thing has been said before around these parts, but in scanning through the endless reams of Steam Next Fest demos earlier this month and trying to work out what these games are and whether they&#x27;re worth downloading, I truly believe it&#x27;s a sentiment that&#x27;s worth repeating. When I first saw the name C.A.R.D.S RPG: The Misty Battlefield appear on the Next Fest landing page, I instantly thought, &#x27;Yes, here we go, now we&#x27;re talking&#x27;. 
Well, my first thought was actually, &#x27;Gee, if only there was an easy way to know what this game&#x27;s about based on just the title alone,&#x27; but that&#x27;s just me being facetious. Ultimately, I have a lot of respect for this kind of naming convention, and the fact it&#x27;s also being made by the Octopath Traveler developers Acquire is really just the icing on the cake.

                              <span>What happens when you combine two great puzzle games? You get one puzzle game which makes me, an accredited professional fool, feel dizzy with noncomprehension. That game is Sokobond Express, which launched yesterday and combines the atom-shoving chemistry of Sokobond with the route-planning puzzling of Cosmic Express. So you have to draw paths around a grid to gather atoms to correctly build a desired molecule. That&#x27;s all. Just molecular chemistry and pathing, at the same time. Oh, my poor foolish head.

                              <span>I&#x27;m not sure exactly what I was expecting from Graven, but it still feels like it wasn&#x27;t quite what I expected. That&#x27;s both good and bad. It has the look of a 90s throwback FPS, the cool atmosphere and action RPG (barely RPG, really, restricted to which weapons you upgrade) combat of something from the 2000s like Rune or Dark Messiah, with a hint of a modern immersive sim. There is, I think, a better game to be made with those parts in a different arrangement. This one is only kinda good.

                              <span>This week&#x27;s Nintendo Direct was stuffed full of games that will also be making their way to PC over the next few months, but the one I haven&#x27;t been able to stop thinking about is the newly-announced Arranger: A Role-Puzzling Adventure. It&#x27;s the debut game from a team of indie devs that include Braid artist David Hellman, Carto writer Nick Suttner and Ethereal designer Nicolás Recabarren, and they&#x27;ve also partnered with composer Tomás Batista, who did the music for both Ethereal and Martian colony builder Per Aspera. It&#x27;s a pretty stacked line-up as these things go, but it&#x27;s Arranger&#x27;s world of constantly shifting sliding tiles that&#x27;s really piqued my curiosity. Come and watch the lovely announcement trailer below and see what I mean.

                              <span>Credit to Nightingale, I’ve been enjoying the early access form of Inflexion’s gaslamp fantasy survival crafter a fair bit more than I did its older stress test build. The UI is cleaner and tighter, and I’ve had more space to explore (and enjoy) the mysterious nooks of its magic &#x27;n&#x27; moustaches world. There’s potential here, but it’s very much the raw kind, especially when performance needs as much work as it does.
Besides relying on upscalers like DLSS for truly smooth running, Nightingale currently has a serious stuttering problem, and bumping into an ugly graphical artefact or even a hard crash is worryingly common. I’ve pulled together an optimised settings guide (down below) so that you don’t need to drop the visual quality lower than is strictly necessary, but do keep in mind that this is early access with emphasis on the early.

                              <span>Yesterday I was off sick with a fever and, as I often do when I&#x27;m laid up ill, immediately set out to consume the most nihilistic and depressing entertainment media I could find. On the film front, I watched Session 9, in which some men hired to remove asbestos from a collapsing 19th century asylum do not have a very nice time. On the game front, I played The Tribe Must Survive, a colony management sim from Walking Tree Games GmbH and Starbreeze Publishing, which is now available in early access.

                              <span>After launching Nightingale into early access on Tuesday, developers Inflexion Games (led by former BioWare CEO Aaryn Flynn) have quickly realised a big miscalculation: lots of players want an offline mode. The gaslamp fantasy survival game requires you be online even if you want to play by yourself, which dovetailed poorly with server issues at launch to frustrate folks. Inflexion say that early in development they needed to make a choice between focusing on co-op or offline first, and now think they made the wrong call. They plan to remedy this, but it&#x27;s not yet clear when they&#x27;ll actually add an offline mode.

                              <span>From Software president Hidetaka Miyazaki has acknowledged that members of the Dark Souls studio had misgivings about Elden Ring&#x27;s shift to a full-blown open world format, while qualifying that Elden Ring&#x27;s vision for an open world was never &quot;traditional&quot;. Rather, Elden Ring is an &quot;open world&quot; game in the same way that Dark Souls is a &quot;hard&quot; game, Miyazaki feels. Confused? Well, this is the godfather of the notoriously unforthcoming Souls series we&#x27;re talking about. I&#x27;ve never interviewed the guy, but I suspect he composes his responses using the game&#x27;s soapstone messaging system.

                              <span>PlayStation VR2 launched in February of last year and while its debut featured new first-party titles like Horizon Call of the Mountain, our favorites on the new platform featured previously released titles like Resident Evil Village. Since that launch, support for the platform has been sparse, to say the least, especially from PlayStation itself. However, Sony has revealed it is currently testing PC support for PS VR2, with hopes to make that support available this year. 
&quot;[We&#x27;re] pleased to share that we are currently testing the ability for PS VR2 players to access additional games on PC to offer even more game variety in addition to the PS VR2 titles available through PS5,&quot; a new PlayStation Blog post published today reads. &quot;We hope to make this support available in 2024, so stay tuned for more updates.&quot;


The rest of the blog goes on to detail new and upcoming titles coming to PS VR2, but those are going to be playable with PlayStation 5 consoles. However, it sounds like PC support, which could open up a flood gate for new VR content, might arrive later this year. 
For more about the hardware, read Game Informer&#x27;s PS VR2 review, and then read Game Informer&#x27;s Horizon Call of the Mountain review. After that, read about why Resident Evil Village is the PS VR2&#x27;s best exclusive, and then check out these 10 games to play using your VR headset.

A new trial will determine the appropriate damages amount given these new conclusions.

Thanks to the reports made by many of you, we have already solved many of the issues. But there might still be a few issues lurking around in this release candidate. Please share your findings on our issue tracker. Thanks to our translators, about half of the translations are (nearly) up-to-date. For the other half, we might need your help with translating. If your language is missing or has more than a few dozen missing strings, please consider helping to finish your translation. Download Changelog Bug tracker</span>

Access real devices with Device Streaming in Android Studio

Device streaming in Android Studio lets you securely connect to remote physical Android devices hosted in Google&#x27;s secure data centers. Powered by Firebase, it&#x27;s the fastest and easiest way to test your app against real devices, including the Google Pixel 8 Pro, Pixel Fold, select Samsung devices, and more.

After connecting to a device, you can deploy your app, view the display, interact with the device (including rotating or unfolding the device), and anything else you might do with a device over a direct ADB over SSL connection—all without leaving Android Studio. When you&#x27;re done using the device, Google wipes all your data and factory resets the device before making it available to another developer.
During Open Alpha, you can use Device Streaming at no cost. To get started simply sign into your Developer account from Android Studio and select a Firebase project. If you don&#x27;t already have a Firebase project, it&#x27;s easy to create one. To learn more, go to Device Streaming in Android Studio.

With beta 3, we’ve restored the cargo types that went missing in the sub-artic and tropical climates. We’ve also included fixes for various other issues which are listed in the full changelog linked below. Thanks to the reports made by many of you, we could solve the issues quickly. But never fear if you’ve missed out so far, there are still a lot of treasures to hunt for in this beta. Please share your findings on our issue tracker. And watch this space as we’ll soon start with our feature posts about the new things coming with OpenTTD 14. In the first installment, you’ll learn why buses don’t always come when they should and what you can do about it. Download Changelog Bug tracker</span>

                              <span>OpenTTD turns 20 this year, and to celebrate we are preparing for one of our largest ever releases. It’s packed with 40 new features, 80 changes, and almost 150 fixes. In the upcoming weeks we will share more posts explaining some of these features in depth. For now, we need your help testing our work. We need as many people as possible to test this beta version of the 14.X release series, so you can find and we can squash as many bugs as possible before the actual release. To guide you a bit towards what you should be looking for: Generic gameplay bugs and crashes. There is a new Ship Pathfinder; test it out. Buoys are optional to use. You can now automatically unbunch your vehicles at a depot. We added our own interpretation of daylength to the game. More on this soon in another blog post. There are many GUI improvements throughout the game. More consistent look, better GUI scaling. There are many more things worth talking about, and this will be made more clear when we approach the release of 14.0. But for now, play the game, and please report any issues you find. The usual titlegame competition has also been announced on the forums. See the page for the exact competition rules if you are interested. Download Changelog Bug tracker</span>
