                    <span>Shooters! A staple of gaming, with more variety than ever today. Whether you&#x27;re looking for a co-op or competitive experience, 2022 is likely to have something for you. While mainstays out there such as Fortnite and Apex Legends will undoubtedly get awesome updates over the course of this year, let&#x27;s take a look at some of the new titles and major expansions coming down the line.
  



      
												
Destiny 2: The Witch Queen
Release: February 22 - Platforms: Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, PC, Stadia

                    <span>Microsoft&#x27;s recent acquisition of Activision Blizzard sent large-scale ripples throughout the industry. The deal was worth a whopping $68.7 billion, exceeding the price tag of any other developer/publisher acquisition. Of course, it&#x27;s safe to assume that exclusivity rights could be in the works for some of the most successful IPs in recent memory, like Call of Duty. However, a spokesperson from Sony chimed in on the current chain of events, confident that several of Activision Blizzard&#x27;s games will continue to remain multiplatform experiences.
It is important to keep in mind what is going on within Activision Blizzard at this time regarding ongoing allegations about the work culture. The ongoing lawsuit from the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) against the compan…</span>

                    <span>We may be pushing towards the end of January, but you can still reminisce about your favorite PlayStation memories of 2021. Sony has launched the PlayStation Wrap-Up Report, giving players a chance to view their biggest and brightest gaming highlights from the last year. 
From now until February 20 visiting the PlayStation Wrap-Up page displays stats such as the number of games played, total hours spent gaming, trophies earned, and other factoids. The only prerequisite is that you’ll have needed to spend at least 10 hours playing a PS5/PS4 in 2021. 
The report also displays the collective accomplishments of players around the world including specific in-game metrics such as the most popular weapon in Returnal. Those who access the Wrap-Up receive a download code to get four free avatars (for PS5 and PS4). 
Sony may be a wee late to the party after Nintendo and Microsoft released similar player reports a few weeks ago, but it&#x27;s still fun to look back and remember, &quot;wow, I really did play a lot of Deathloop last year.&quot; PlayStation currently has Horizon Forbidden West, God of War: Ragnarok, and Gran Turismo 7 slated for this year along with no shortage of exciting third-party titles. Odds are the 2022 Wrap-Up is going to be one for the books.

Yesterday, Guerrilla Games released a new Forbidden West story trailer, and you can check out some exclusive details we learned about it after talking to the team, and now the studio has released a special “meet the cast” trailer.
It begins with an introduction to protagonist Aloy’s voice actor, Ashly Burch, who explains that Aloy had to step into a new role as the hero of the world. She also touches on the more adversarial aspect of Aloy and Sylens’ relationship. And speaking of Sylens, Lance Reddick is returning to voice the character last seen in the post-credits scene at the end of Horizon Zero Dawn. He talks about Sylens’ egomaniac personality and how that shapes his re…</span>

Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel is billed by Konami as the definitive video game adaptation of the popular card game. The free-to-play title is available on consoles and PC and lets players enjoy a highly produced simulation of the TCG with over 10,000 cards at their disposal. In addition to a solo mode, players can duke it out online across any platform thanks to cross-play. Cross-progression also allows players to enjoy the game anywhere, whether in front of a monitor, TV, or Switch screen.

Game Informer’s elite duelists Marcus Stewart, Dan Tack, and John Carson will battle it out to decide who reigns as GI’s King of Games. Expect plenty of trash talk and anime-inspired buffoonery as we show off Master Duel’s features, modes, and maybe open some card packs to boot.

                    <span>Update, 1/20/21:
The upcoming story-driven DLC for cyberpunk action-platformer, Ghostrunner, has been delayed. 
Originally set to release some time this month, Ghostrunner&#x27;s Project_Hel DLC will now release on March 3. This means players will have to wait a little bit longer to play the DLC, which puts you behind the blade of Hel, a boss from the base game. 
According to 505 Games, the delay is to give the team more time to improve the DLC while also ensuring the health and safety of the studio and its partners are maintained. 
The global release of the Project_Hel DLC will be delayed to March 3rd. We appreciate your understanding and want all our fans to know that we will use this bonus time to make even more worthwhile improvements while ensuring the health &amp; safety of our team and globa…</span>

                    <span>Have A Nice Death caught our attention when it burst onto the scene during the 2021 Game Awards thanks to its stylish hand-drawn presentation and equally slick-looking action. Thankfully, developer Magic Design Studios is ready to let players take Death for a whirl by annoucing the game will launch in Steam Early Access on March 8.
The game stars a very stressed-out Death whose underworld office has fallen into chaos thanks to his rambunctious employees running amok on Earth. Besides spoiling his vacation plans, this mayhem also upsets the balance of souls and that’s a big problem. Armed with your trusty scythe, you’ll have to keep your underlings in line the old-fashioned way.

The 2D game sports fast-paced hack n’ slash action where Death can wield over 30 different weapons. Since Death can’t die, success depends on completing stages repeatedly to earn better performance reviews to unlock new items. Death can also outfit itself with beneficial curses, though doing comes with a cost such as increasing enemy strength. 
Magic Design Studios plans to keep Have A Nice Death in Early Access for roughly one year, so we probably shouldn’t expect the full launch until 2023. The game will launch with several worlds and bosses available to conquer and the team will continue to add more content and fine-tune systems over the coming months.</span>

Pupperazzi is the gaming equivalent of cotton candy. It’s sweet and makes the day feel more festive, but it’s not going to tide you over if you’re looking for something with real substance. Smartly, the game doesn’t take itself too seriously, leaning into the playfully absurd concept of becoming a leading member of the puppy paparazzi with chuckle-inducing tasks, lively levels, and plenty of chances to pet virtual pooches.
Developer Sundae Month doesn’t try to explain Pupperazzi’s conceit. You are a humanoid camera (whose stretchy arms and ungainly shadow are either silly or the stuff of nightmares depending on how you loo…</span>

As for when you’ll get to step into the masked wrestler’s shoes along with many others, you can circle March 11 on your calendar.
We previously detailed some of the features, gameplay modes, and confirmed superstars in last November’s update (which you can read here), but 2K22 features a new engine built from scratch to allow for smoother animations and simplified yet strategic grappling.

                    <span>Windjammers 2 launched today, giving ‘90s arcade fans or those who discovered the game via the 2018 remaster a new arena to lob discs at each other. My review is currently in progress, but since the online mode didn’t go live until today, I’ll need time to test that out in a live environment before giving my complete assessment. In the meantime, here are my impressions so far. 
The good news: playing Windjammers is still very fun. For those unfamiliar, two players face off in what’s essentially a hybrid of tennis and air hockey. You try to toss the disc past your opponent to score in their goal, but you can also earn points if the disc touches their court. The game sports a fighting game caliber of depth thanks to many variations of disc throws. The best matches are fast-paced, back-and-fo…</span>

Rainbow Six Extraction is a spin-off of Ubisoft’s flagship competitive multiplayer hit, Rainbow Six Siege, set in an alien-infested depiction of the United States. This three-player cooperative shooter borrows its predecessor’s roster of operators and weapons and recontextualizes them inside a more approachable player-versus-environment setting – often to fun results. The operator advancements offer exciting rewards for players willing to invest the time, though the climb to unlock the best rewards is steep.

                    <span>Wahoo.
Super Mario Sunshine gets a pretty bad rep these days, largely for its insistence that players have to clean up an entire island of gunk. The innovative FLUDD mechanics, which involve using water jets to upgrade Mario&#x27;s platforming skills, were not for everyone — and they were sometimes pretty hard to use.
Imagine a Super Mario Sunshine with more traditional platforming — in the style of Super Mario Galaxy, perhaps — and you have Super Mario Starshine, a fan-made project that takes away all of the goo-based gameplay from the former, and adds in elements from the latter in kind. Luigi, Captain Toad, and jumping without the use of liquid turn Super Mario Sunshine&#x27;s levels into something new. Have a look at the prologue to get an idea of what it&#x27;s like:

Journeying through the Kant– sorry, Velua region, you&#x27;ll be catching creatures of different elemental types, battling other trainers, and stopping a shady organisation from using legendary Coromon for evil purposes.

This review originally went live in 2009, and we&#x27;re updating and republishing it to mark the long-awaited return of Banjo-Kazooie to a Nintendo console, available as part of the Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack N64 library.

Back in the days of the N64’s prime, there was one firm that managed to stand out from the rest: Rare. The UK-based outfit was responsible for some of the greatest games the world has ever seen – GoldenEye 007, Diddy Kong Racing, Perfect Dark, Blast Corps, Jet Force Gemini, Donkey Kong 64... it&#x27;s no exaggeration to say that Rare rivalled Nintendo itself when it came to mastering the 64-bit system. However, of all of the amazing titles the studio produced for the console, it is perhaps Banjo-Kazooie that attracts the most adoration and acclaim, even after all this time.

After all, the game — which includes playable levels and scenarios from all nine films in the mainline Star Wars saga — has been delayed three times in total.
However, according to a report from Polygon, it&#x27;s not a time to celebrate for the people who worked on the game, who have been reportedly suffering under the effects of crunch at developer TT Games the last five years on this project — and others since the company&#x27;s founding in 2005.

&quot;Super Rare Games is historically best known for our line-up of physical Switch games, which we release one of roughly every 3 weeks exclusively through our online store,&quot; they said in a press release. &quot;Our mission statement has always been about supporting talented indies of all scales, which we see this as the natural expansion of.&quot;

                    <span>The Financial Times thinks EA is a target.
Microsoft has just splashed $70 billion to buy Activision Blizzard following its 2020 acquisition of Bethesda, which seems to suggest that we&#x27;re entering a period of serious consolidation, the likes of which haven&#x27;t been seen since the &#x27;90s.
Given this backdrop, The Financial Times (paywall) is tipping FIFA publisher Electronic Arts as the next target. With franchises such as Madden, The Sims and Apex Legends under its belt, EA is undoubtably one of the industry&#x27;s heavyweights, but, with an enterprise value of $38 billion – less than what Microsoft just paid for Activision – you&#x27;d imagine that it could become the target of a takeover bid.

                    <span>Before it&#x27;s reborn as a hotel.

Back in early 2020 it was announced that Nintendo&#x27;s iconic previous headquarters in Kyoto would be converted into a hotel. Owned now by the Yamauchi family, it&#x27;s the HQ from the period of Nintendo&#x27;s extensive growth in selling playing cards, and was also its home as it started to explore moves into children&#x27;s toys and gadgets. That progression would eventually lead the company into arcade development and releasing the original Famicom; the rest is history.

Famitsu&#x27;s Japanese chart figures are now in for the week ending 16th January, revealing that Mario Party Superstars has once again taken top spot.

While we already have a few Zelda-related products from First 4 Figures in our office, we&#x27;ve just welcomed a statue from Dark Souls – but, unlike FromSoftware&#x27;s famously brutal series, this particular product is as cute as they come.
Great Grey Wold Sif is part of First 4 Figures&#x27; &#x27;Super Deformed&#x27; range for Dark Souls, and renders the fearsome boss as an adorable puppy.

Railway Empire has been out on Switch for a good while, allowing us to design, plan and build railway networks while on a train. That&#x27;s immersion, right there.
The core package offers quite a bit of content, such as the main North American campaign and a range of previous DLCs - the Switch already has 5 paid DLCs as well, covering different parts of Europe and Australia.

                    <span>According to Take-Two&#x27;s CEO.
Last year, Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition arrived on Switch and other platforms in what Digital Foundry – and many others, let&#x27;s be honest – described as &quot;a big mess&quot;. Despite its troubled launch, however, the CEO of Take-Two, which is the parent company of GTA developer Rockstar, claims that the game has &quot;done just great&quot;.
The disappointing initial release, which caused Rockstar to be flooded with refund requests at the time, was plagued with bugs, glitches, frame rate issues and more that certainly made fans question the &#x27;Definitive&#x27; title. These issues were brought up during a CNBC interview with Take-Two&#x27;s Strauss Zelnick, where it was suggested that the game may have been released too early, but the company CEO brushed the comment aside, describing the game&#x27;s many problems as &quot;a glitch&quot;.

Update: After some not-so-subtle clues back in December, a Switch eShop listing has confirmed that a Switch port of Frogwares&#x27; well-received detective adventure Sherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishments is releasing on 3rd February.
It&#x27;ll set you back $29.99, although it&#x27;s currently available for 15% off ($25.49, offer runs until 9th February), and anyone who already owns The Sinking City on Switch will save another 10%. The game will clock in at a meaty 8.2GB according to the listing. We&#x27;ve also now received details that the game runs at 720p undocked, 1080p docked, with a locked 30FPS.

Mario Kart Tour keeps its players interested with a couple of updates each month, but it&#x27;s next event is one that matters. Yes, it&#x27;s going to be Team Wario vs Team Waluigi.
If you&#x27;re unfamiliar with the &#x27;versus&#x27; aspect of Mario Kart Tour, it&#x27;s really just a fun way to add some colour themes into the game and freshen up races. Two teams are trying to collect themed tokens and win, though everyone who takes part gets limited time items. It&#x27;s all about having a good time and proving that Waluigi is better and should have had his own spin-off series.

It&#x27;s not an easy task, to take a game as mechanically perfect as 1994&#x27;s Neo Geo classic Windjammers and put your own spin on it. How do you modernise such a wonderfully simple and addictive thing? What do you change about it to give it a lift, to add even more in the way of strategy for fans to sink their teeth into without ruining the streamlined ebb and flow that makes the original so endlessly endearing?
Well, somehow, Dotemu has managed to find a way. Windjammers 2 is everything we love about the original game reimagined, emboldened and delightfully expanded by a slick new art style and a bunch of new mechanics that make the core gameplay loop here even more alluring than ever.

                    <span>&quot;Never forget what they took from us&quot;.
As you might recall, Nintendo released a &quot;limited-time&quot; battle royale title called Super Mario Bros. 35 on the Switch eShop in 2020. Although the game could still be active, the company decided to take it offline when Mario&#x27;s anniversary celebrations ended.
If it wasn&#x27;t already hard enough for fans of this short-lived release, Nintendo has now used the same title in a Japanese customer support tweet about how to delete games you no longer play (or in this case, can no longer access) on the Switch. Here&#x27;s the tweet, as highlighted by Twitter user Kyle McLain:

                    <span>Amplitude Studios today released the first proper paid DLC for Humankind, adding new African cultures. Perhaps more importantly than that, they released another patch. A Civilization-esque strategy game from the makers of Endless Space and Endless Legend sounded great but some found it suffered issues with bugs, balance, and general polish. So sure, expanding the game with DLC, sure sure, tell me about making what&#x27;s already there better. Amplitude laid out some of their plans on that front, too.

                    <span>Panic. Panic at the museum reception desk, as the astronaut suit I have belatedly possessed is set upon by a four-strong team of ghost busters. We’re in the opening seconds of the round and only 20 minutes into my Midnight Ghost Hunt hands-on preview, which means I’ve yet to figure out important concepts like ‘where the hunters spawn in’, or nuances like ‘this button lets me hide in props’ as opposed to ‘this button telekinetically waggles props about like ectoplasmic dinner bells’. As ghosts we’re supposed to mostly stay schtum for the five minutes it takes to reach midnight, at which point we get to both metaphorically and literally flip the tables on the living. Instead: panic.

We open an estate agent to appraise the houses in games that would actually be good to live in. It turns out there aren&#x27;t that many. Not a lot of them would be convenient. 
There&#x27;s an excellent Cavern Of Lies this week, in which Nate hosts a game-themed episode of Through The Keyhole in character as Lloyd Grossman/a robot version of Matt Berry. We also have some great diversions and some opening chat about the time my friend was a real life suspect in a murder for a few days. Plus: Matthew had an unpleasant experience watching House Of Gucci.

                    <span>Dunno if you’ve noticed, but there’s been a whole lot of news lately. Too much news in fact. Growing up, we barely had any news. There was just one bit of news that we’d all have to share. A man would drive around our village with the news in the back of his van, and we’d all come out of our houses to watch as he slid open the doors and pointed at it, saying “well, here is the news”. And it was the same news, every day. The news about the hole in the ozone layer. And it was all the news we needed.


Not For Broadcast puts you in charge of all of the news. Set in an alternate timeline 1980s Britain in which an authoritarian far-left party has swept to power on a wave of populist policies, it casts the player as the lens through which the nation will view its new government. Seated in front of a bank of glowing screens, sliders and controls, you have the enviable power to switch between four live camera feeds, bleep out naughty words (and later subversive opinion), choose which ads to run during the break, and select which images are highlighted on screen during each news story.

                    <span>Ah, to be good with plants. Apparently it was a thing, wasn&#x27;t it, that my generation all got into house plants, especially during lockdown. A friend of mine has a positively ebullient front room full of lush, green darlings that have names like Hercules. My brother-in-law, absent any real space, has mounted glass spheres of water on his wall and grows little flowers and trailing vines from them. I, on the other hand, am a plant killer. Apart from in Strange Horticulture, when I run a spooky and ethereal plant shop in a town called Undermere, in an alternate-universe version of The Lake District. There, my plants are happy and weird, and with them I can save the world.

                    <span>Strategy games set in space are almost innately ambitious. The very concept of doing anything meaningful in an infinite void, let alone making it playable and entertaining, is a challenging one, and for every game that reaches for the stars there are countless kinds of... spiraling chaos orbitals.
Between its design flaws and unique ideas with semi-brilliant execution, the 2010 4X/wargame/economic/management simulation Distant Worlds: Universe has straddled those two experiences for a decade. It&#x27;s needed a sequel for a long time. Distant Worlds 2 is that sequel, and it&#x27;s almost upon us. Last week I attended a live demo and Q&amp;A session with its producer and co-designer Erik Rutkins. With only a hands-off demo to go on I obviously can&#x27;t say for sure how it plays yet, but it&#x27;s already looking very promising.

Looking ahead, they&#x27;ve also revealed the much-requested new scoreboard which will arrive in February. After a few months, maybe the game will get to the state it should have been in when it launch in November.

                    <span>We’re in a bit of a “love letter” media period right now. Some old things come back with new things to say, like The Matrix Resurrections, and some old things come back simply to enjoy themselves, and remind yesteryear fans what they loved about the original in the first place, like Scream. 


Windjammers 2 falls firmly into the latter category. After successfully resurrecting Streets Of Rage for another bout in 2020, developer Dotemu are up to the same old tricks, bringing Windjammers all the way back from 1994 (before I was even born) with a fresh coat of paint and some brand new ultimate frisbee-style action in this sequel.

                    <span>Amazon’s Lord of the Rings series has a name and it’s a touch on the nose, if not overly redundant – The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power. 
The Lord of the Rings is already a great title. The Rings of Power isn’t bad, either, but putting the two side by side is an odd choice, but you know what, it’s the one Amazon is going with. Fortunately, the teaser released today announcing that title is much more interesting than the actual title it reveals.

                    <span>It is important to keep in mind what is going on within Activision Blizzard at this time regarding ongoing allegations about the work culture. The ongoing lawsuit from the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) against the company is over reported toxic workplace culture. The bulk of the suit focuses on &quot;violations of the state&#x27;s civil rights and equal pay laws,&quot; specifically regarding the treatment of women and other marginalized groups. To learn more about the proceedings thus far, including details listed in the lawsuit against Activision Blizzard, please check out our previous coverage here.

Season 2 of Call of Duty: Vanguard and Warzone Pacific has been delayed.

                    <span>Blue Isle Studios is bringing its new shooter, Leap, to PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 along with a PC release. Check out the trailer below showing its wild, fast-paced action ... in action.

Leap features 60-player matches where players take on roles determined by which exosuit they choose to utilize. The four currently available are the Pathfinder, Titan, Wraith, and Tech Ops, each with different playstyles, armor types, and skills. Some let you fly in the air with a jetpack, while others let you stealth or play the support role. Personal vehicles or PVs let players mount up on their preferred ride, including a mechanical moose, what looks like a snow tube, or my favorite: the hoverboard. I definitely prefer cruising into battle like a gun-toating Silver Surfer.

                    <span>Dying Light 2 Stay Human is slated to parkour its way to PlayStation and Xbox consoles as well as PC on February 4. It was also supposed to come to Switch via cloud streaming that day, but that will no longer be the case.
Techland has delayed the Switch version to an unspecified later date. The team’s reasoning is simply to, in their words via a press release, “provide fans with the gaming experience at the level they deserve and Techland wants to provide.” Techland promises the game will arrive on Switch within six months of Dying Light 2’s release, so (hopefully) expect it no later than July. 
Dying Light 2 is a massive and ambitious game and getting it to perform well on Switch is likely no small feat, even if they’re utilizing cloud streaming instead of cramming it onto a traditional cartridge (which Techland did accomplish with the first game). That&#x27;s a bummer for those hoping to enjoy the adventure on a handheld, but at least Dying Light 2 is only a couple of weeks from hitting other platforms. To get prepped, check out the final episode of Dying 2 Know centered on its four-player co-op and the full list of PC requirements.</span>

                    <span>My uncle bought me Final Fantasy XII for my birthday in 2006. At 10 years old, a lot of the combat mechanics and branching plotlines were confusing. Regardless, I was enamored with the game’s vibrancy: I specifically recall marveling at hair and garments fluttering in desert winds as well as azure sparks flashing from clanging swords and shields. To this day, it remains my favorite Final Fantasy.
The game was originally released as a PlayStation 2 exclusive, but in the past few years, a remaster called, Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age launched on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch and PC with performance enhancements, deeper job customization, and various quality-of-life changes. More recently, Square Enix released the remaster on PlayStation Now. If you’ve never experienced Final Fantasy X…</span>

                    <span>Pokémon Legends: Arceus is out next Tuesday and if you’ve managed to stay away from spoilers this long, you might want to consider muting some terms on Twitter and staying away from Reddit. That’s because copies of Pokémon Legends: Arceus are out in the wild in the hands of some fans and as expected, screenshots, story details, and more from the upcoming RPG are being shared online.

We won’t spoil any of that here, but just to contextualize the kind of leaked information that’s now floating out there, we’ve seen the title screen, multiple characters, different cosmetics, a small snippet of an earlier cutscene, story details about the Hisui region, and we’ve even seen two recordings of songs from the game. As people with copies already continue to play, we expect even more spoilers to pop up online, too. 
If you’re active on Twitter or video game-centric subreddits, you’ve no doubt already seen that copies of Pokémon Legends: Arceus are out in the wild and based on what we’ve seen leaked, you really don’t want to accidentally stumble upon some of these. Doubly so if you’re someone who doesn’t want to know a thing about the new take on Pokémon before it hits shelves next week. 
All of this is to say: Be careful out there.
In the meantime, why not check out some officially released things about the game? Last week, Nintendo released a 13-minute trailer for Pokémon Legends: Arceus that gave us our best look yet at the upcoming game and it’s worth a watch if you’re still wondering what gameplay is actually like. Read about how Hisuian Voltorb is still a Pokéball somehow after that and then check out the Hisuian forms for Zorua and Zoroark in Pokémon Legends: Arceus.

                    <span>The Battlefield franchise is no stranger to bugs and post-launch fixes. However, 2042’s launch was marred by an abundance of game-breaking issues that left many fans questioning the staying power of their favorite FPS franchise. In past months, DICE responded to the widespread scrutiny, promising a batch of upcoming updates to remedy an assortment of issues while implementing fan-favorite, currently-absent features. The details surrounding these promises were unpacked in an extensive Twitter thread posted by the official Battlefield Direct Communication account. An upcoming batch of Battlefield 2042 updates will refresh the in-game scoreboard, address cross-platform VOIP, and amplify/stabilize overall performance.

We&#x27;re inching closer to Horizon Forbidden West&#x27;s February 18 release date. Up until now, Guerrilla Games has kept much about the narrative under lock and key, but the latest trailer (which you can view above) is full of teases for Aloy&#x27;s next adventure. It provided glimpses at some returning characters alongside new faces who are sure to shake up Aloy&#x27;s journey – for better or worse. 
Guerrilla left fans with a lot to dissect and unpack in this new showing. Thankfully, we chatted with narrative director Benjamin McCaw and senior writer Annie Kitain to gain more clarity and context about what we saw. 
A Brief Recap
The trailer reiterated the tremendous plight in front of Aloy. &quot;The land is dying, people are suffering, and soon they&#x27;ll starve,&quot; Aloy says…</span>

Nintendo announced last month that Banjo-Kazooie would be joining its Nintendo 64 library lineup by way of the company&#x27;s Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription service. However, Nintendo merely said it would be coming in January at the time. Now, we know when. 
Revealed on Twitter, Nintendo says Banjo-Kazooie will hit Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack on January 20, or in other words, you can play this classic Nintendo 64 game starting tomorrow! Here&#x27;s a trailer released by Nintendo to celebrate the news:

The original story continues below...
Original Story, December 10, 2021:
The Nintendo 64 library of the Switch Online Expansion Pack gets a dose of Rare next month when Banjo-Kazooie joins the service.
The game joins the service sometime in January, but there&#x27;s no exact date as of yet. The 1998 platformer is widely remembered as a standout game for the N64 (especially for third-party games) and among the most beloved games of the era overall. While the emulation of the Expansion Pack hasn&#x27;t been universally loved, it&#x27;s cool to see Banjo-Kazooie making its way back to the house of N. Given that Microsoft owns Rare, the only way to play Banjo was on Xbox, such as in the Rare Replay collection.

                    <span>With Microsoft’s bombshell acquisition of Activision Blizzard announced this morning, on top of its other big purchases in recent years, the Xbox family is well beyond stacked. With its competition’s first-party lineup growing and subsequently shrinking selection of big third-party partners, Sony has a challenge ahead of it, to say the least. However, instead of staying toe-to-toe with Xbox by acquiring studios to keep up, it’s more important right now for Sony to develop a rival to Microsoft’s biggest boon this generation: Xbox Game Pass.
On paper, Microsoft has the option to wall off franchises like Warcraft, Diablo, and Call of Duty as Xbox console exclusives. Instead, in reality, every existing game from those massive names is up for grabs to use in Game Pass, as demonstrated by the Be…</span>

                    <span>Microsoft announced today that it is buying Activision Blizzard for a colossal $68.7 billion, and in doing so, it quickly launched itself to the higher end of expensive acquisitions. This brings franchises almost as big as that price tag, such as Call of Duty, Overwatch, Diablo, and World of Warcraft into the Xbox family. The future of these franchises and whether or not they become exclusive to Xbox consoles remains uncertain and is just one of the many unanswered questions following today’s news. 
What’s to become of Bobby Kotick, the CEO of Activision Blizzard who reportedly knew for years of the company’s history of sexual misconduct and harassment? Which Activision Blizzard franchises might Xbox revive? Which games will remain multiplatform, and which will become Xbox exclusives? For …</span>

                    <span>Microsoft swallowed up all of Tuesday&#x27;s attention with their plan to buy Activision Blizzard for $69 billion, drowning out even good news of their own. Along with surprise, concern, and bafflement, yesterday brought Game Pass news. Yes yes they do plan to add Actiblizz games to Game Pass while they can, but there&#x27;s more: 1) the service now has over 25 million subscribers across PC and Xbox; 2) cult classic Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc is now on Game Pass. You know, the one with the weird bear and the murdergames.

                    <span>Hello folks. I would say Happy New Year, but it&#x27;s already the 19th January and we&#x27;ve had two of the biggest news stories of the year in the space of a week, so I think that means it&#x27;s officially too late to keep banging the old New Year drum, isn&#x27;t it? The sentiment remains, of course, even if I do now feel a thousand years old in the process.
Rather than reaching for the annual reset button, though, today I wanted to talk about some of the new and exciting things that are coming up on RPS this year. For starters, our tech team&#x27;s just handed us a brand-new liveblogging feature, and we&#x27;d like you, our RPS supporters, to help us test it out tomorrow at 4pm GMT.

                    <span>Announced at last year’s The Game Awards, Have A Nice Death is a roguelike platformer developed by Magic Design Studios where you play as Death, CEO of the underworld. Your employees have gone berserk and thrown your vacation plans into disarray, so must wield your trusty scythe and travel into the depths of your company to hack them all back to their stations. It looks good! And it’s coming to Steam early access in March.

                    <span>If you&#x27;re after a way to make your magic system seem cutesy yet different at the same time, music is a good one to go for. Sure, it&#x27;s been done before, but it feels inherently charming. At least, it does in the trailer for newly-revealed Songs Of Glimmerwick, a new game from Eastshade Studios that promises to blend RPG, adventure, and gardening.
No specific release date is confirmed, aside from &quot;next year&quot;. I have to give them credit for the name Songs Of Glimmerwick, which immediately lets you know that this will be about music and magic, and probably have an amount of tweeness. Specific tweeness levels unconfirmed but they&#x27;re looking good from the trailer, where you can also clap eyes on some pretty cool-looking gardening, a tree telling you to stfu, and a man earnestly giving you a wooden flute as you head off to magic university.

                    <span>Sometimes you have no choice but to admire hard graft, even if it&#x27;s illegal graft. In this case, it&#x27;s a Russian bootleg copy of The Simpsons Hit &amp; Run which we&#x27;re admiring, mainly because the bootlegger has dubbed every character in every cutscene. The result is magnificent and just really funny, to be honest.

Even before you consider the serious and unresolved allegations of workplace misconduct at ActiBlizz, there&#x27;s no easy &quot;this is good, actually&quot; point of view to have here.

The Wall Street Journal claim someone told them that Actiblizz CEO Bobby Kotick wanted to &#x27;change the narrative&#x27; around the company following many allegations of discrimination and harassment, and he thought that one way to do that was buying some of the video games media, such as Kotaku or cheery RPS fanzine PC Gamer. Oh that would change the narrative alright!

                    <span>The first time I wrote about Total War: Warhammer, Ed Milliband had just lost a general election because of a sandwich. There’s a joke there about him stepping down but the Chaos having remained, but I can’t figure it out. Anyway, what I’m trying to say is this: it’s been almost seven years since then. SEVEN! And I’m still head over heels in love with these games even now. Somehow, impossibly, that seems to be holding true for Warhammer 3 as well.
In a recent hands-on event, I was able to play something like eight hours worth of this final game in the trilogy from the comfort of my own spare room. Having not done a “digital preview” before now, this was something of a revelation to me. Wearing my comfortable clothes and with a steady supply of big mugs of tea, I booted up the game, hit ‘New Campaign’ and was greeted with the following screen.

                    <span>Microsoft yesterday announced plans to buy Activision Blizzard for $69 billion (£50 billion), a staggering and un-nice quantity of money for the video games company behind Call Of Duty and Warcraft. They&#x27;re buying the company at a troubled time, with multiple lawsuits alleging widespread sexual discrimination and harassment, an ongoing strike over QA layoffs, and employees publicly calling for the removal of the CEO, Bobby Kotick. A campaign group of employees known as the ABK Workers Alliance say the acquisition doesn&#x27;t change their goals and there&#x27;s still work to do.

                    <span>It turns out Rainbow Six Extraction is more cerebral and stealthy than the co-op shooters I’m used to; the other day I accompanied Hayden and Ed on a few missions for the latter’s review, and spent most of them either accidentally summoning hordes of parasite monsters or being hauled to medevac while encased in protective foam. Between my cocoon-muffled cries for help, however, I did manage to get a good look into how Extraction runs on PC, as well as the best settings to tweak if you want better performance.

                    <span>Rainbow Six Extraction is a spin-off from Rainbow Six Siege&#x27;s popular Outbreak mode, which saw Tom Clancy&#x27;s operators fending off aliens instead of each other. Well, Extraction is a tactical FPS that builds on what made Outbreak great by repurposing Siege&#x27;s PvP prowess into a moreish Left 4 Dead-like. Unpicking an alien hivemind with your mates is a real thrill, as is simply coming back from a mission alive. While it doesn&#x27;t do anything to blow you away, it does more than enough to keep you coming back for a quick alien-busting session here and there.

At the very least, Microsoft could make use of Activision Blizzard’s wealth of underutilized intellectual property. Here are some of our favorite Activision/Blizzard franchises that we’d love to see Microsoft resurrect in the near future.
    
                  
              
              
                  

  


      
Blackthorne
It&#x27;s time to bring back Blizzard&#x27;s classic cinematic platformer. While there&#x27;s a lot of &quot;you had to be there when the original title was relevant back in the ‘90s,” Blackthorne is a brand ready to get back into the game with some fresh perspective and the benefits of plenty of…</span>

                    <span>The Artful Escape is a trippy and profound musical romp that emerged as one of our favorite indies of 2021. It’s been Xbox console exclusive since launch (and available on PC), but the ballad of Francis Vendetti will soon find a new audience.
That’s because the game is launching on PlayStation consoles and Switch on January 25. If you’re unfamiliar, The Artful Escape spins the yarn of Francis Vendetti, a musician and the nephew of a famous folksinger who finds himself pigeonholed to expectations of following in his uncle’s stylistic footsteps. It’s not until an alien ship arrives and whisks Francis off to an intergalactic space odyssey does he begin to discover his true voice. The gameplay itself consists of simple side-scrolling platforming, but the real stars are the killer soundtrack, gorgeous visuals, and top-notch performances from names like Carl Weathers and Lena Headey. There’s a reason it earned an 8.5 review score from us.

                    <span>Yesterday, 343 Industries announced that starting this week, it would be making some changes to the Halo Infinite price store. Specifically, the studio was going to make changes to how it packages and prices items in the store. The store was updated today, just like it is every Tuesday, and as promised, those price changes are evident. 
The most notable change is the general decrease in price, especially for large bundles that feature cosmetic coatings for armor, weapons, and vehicles. That’s evident with the 1200 credit-priced Neon Superfly bundle, which will cost roughly $10. In weeks past, a bundle like that would have cost roughly $17.
The vehicle coating bundle called Zodiac River, which gives warthogs and more a rainbow-esque coating and adds new tires to roll in the battlefield, is also available for what appears to be a cheaper-than-usual price at just 500 credits. 
That same type of bundle might have cost a couple of hundred credits more in previous weeks. The boost and swap pack, which gives players Double XP boosts and Challenge Swaps for 200 credits, is the same price as usual. 
There’s also a Neon Beat bundle that includes an Epic Mythic Effect set, a purple visor, and more for 1000 credits. Plus, the Keep It Clean bundle that costs 500 credits is available and it includes a nameplate, an AI, and more.
Both it and the Neon Beat bundle appear to be priced similarly to weeks past, but the bigger Neon Superfly bundle is undoubtedly cheaper than it might have been had it gone live on the Halo Infinite store in a previous week. 
For more about the game, check out the Game Informer Halo Infinite hub and then keep an eye on our story about what’s available in the Halo Infinite shop, which is updated weekly.

But somehow, this year is just as ridiculously stuffed with awesome-looking experiences. Independent creators are bringing their triple-I-games with titles that range from an action-packed Kung Fu epic to an unsettlingly cute community builder. Presented in chronological release order, here’s our list of the indie games we are most looking forward to in 2022.

                    <span>Cuphead and his trusty drink-holding brother will hit Netflix next month. 
This news was announced today with the first official trailer for the series, which is called The Cuphead Show. This new trailer comes seven months after our first sneak peek at the show and as that peek indicated, The Cuphead Show will be about the titular character and his brother, Mugman, traversing the Inkwell Isles.

Unlike the game, which tasks players with wiping some debt owed to the Devil, it seems that the show is less about a central story such as that and more about episode-to-episode adventures that may or may not be hijacked by some devilish deeds from the Devil. However, the trailer reveals quite a few of the locales visited in Cuphead as well as many of the bosses…</span>

                    <span>The everchanging world of Fortnite received a significant update today. As the weather heats up and spring approaches, frozen sections of the game&#x27;s map are thawing. One such area has melted to reveal the return of Titled Towers, a popular location filled with towers that was a part of Fortnite&#x27;s first battle royale map.
The great thaw also has awakened new life in the form of giant dinosaurs called Klombos. These peaceful beasts are roughly the size of a bus and are roaming the world looking for things to eat, especially Klomberries. When they consume something, their color changes. You can interact with these beasts. Try running up a Klombos tail and see what happens when you reach the blowhole on its head. If you shoot a Klombo, it will attack you. That blowhole is also a weapon. So far, you can find two Klombos on the map – one to the northwest of the Daily Bugle and another to the west of Titled Towers.
In a few matches I played this morning, Titled Towers proved to be a popular destination with what seemed to be half of players descending upon it to see what has changed. You may want to arm yourself and shield up before landing at this fun spot. If you collect characters, you&#x27;ll find two have been added to the game in slots 21 and 22.
More significant changes will likely be on the way to Fortnite in a few weeks, as The Foundation and Haven Masks battle pass rewards unlock in 16 days. The item shop also updates daily at 6 p.m. CT. It&#x27;ll be interesting to see if Epic Games ties in any character skins and items with the return of Titled Towers. Maybe a Klombo trainer? We&#x27;ll find out later today.</span>

Nobody Saves the World is as charming and funny as Drinkbox Studios’ Guacamelee series. Bolstered by wonderfully challenging dungeons, Nobody’s core pillars of body swapping and ability customization go a long way to making this a memorable adventure, though a paper-thin world and underwhelming rewards keep this Nobody from being the best Somebody possible.
Within the amusing story, only one wizard has the power to shut down the disgusting fungal calamity that’s devastating the kingdom. Unfortunately, that guy is nowhere to be found. Instead, a pale, featureless wim…</span>

                    <span>I used to think that big, intricate character customisation systems were pretty much mandatory for decent CRPGs. As I saw it, the ability to conjure up a hideous goblin man with a chin curving back up into his face, if you wanted to, was a sign that you were playing something in the big leagues. Now, however, I am not so sure.  

Expeditions: Rome, a historical CRPG blending turn-based combat, strategic army management, and lots of dialogue, has a pretty rubbish character creation system. There’s bugger all you can really do to customise your Roman. and after the mammoth character forge of Pathfinder: Wrath Of The Righteous, for example, it all just feels very sparse and shoestringy. And that is a damned shame, because when it gets down to business, this is a seriously good - and lovingly detailed - romp through centurion times.

                    <span>To perform an ollie is to commune with gods. Or maybe just look cool. OlliOlli World is shaping up to be a good-spirited renovation of the 2D skateboarding series that has traditionally been quite punishing. This one&#x27;s got a flashy third dimension, moon-faced cartoon characters, and a plucky story to match. We&#x27;re told of Skate Godz who once appointed a human representative on earth. But she&#x27;s about to retire and needs a prodigy to step forward to fill her Vans. The player is that potential new conduit between holy half-pipers and humanity. In other words, this is a quest to become Skate Pope. Caliph of kickflips. Dalai Slama. Having both popped and shoved-it through a heap of levels in preview, I&#x27;m happy to report you can all sit down. I&#x27;m the chosen one. It&#x27;s me.

The World War 2 sandbox MMO is a persistent battle where weapons, vehicle, and building rely on resources gathered, processed, and delivered by other players, without whom the war machine slows down. Our boy Brendy called logistics &quot;the real heroes&quot; when he rode with them a few years back. But many are unhappy with the current state of their role, so they&#x27;ve formed a union.

                    <span>Something is missing from Nobody Saves The World, a new action RPG from Guacamelee devs DrinkBox Studios. This is a dungeon-crawler that lets you shapeshift into horses, bodybuilders, and ghosts in your bid to save the world, but it&#x27;s a quest blighted not only by a Calamity, but by repetition too. Charming characters and clever mighty-morphin&#x27; combat succumb to numbers, which reduces what could&#x27;ve been a rich world to a rather hollow dash between dungeons.

                    <span>Can I get a ‘woop woop’, or at least a ‘wololo’, for the spin-off strategy game? The Ensemble Studios swansong that was Halo Wars, an RTS so streamlined it was aerodynamic. The ballistic ballet of Gears Tactics, which piled extra biceps atop XCOM’s shoulders. Even when money has moved through the membrane in the opposite direction, it has resulted in projects that were - let’s not overstate this - endearingly experimental. Can I get an understanding nod for Command &amp; Conquer: Renegade?
The strangeness of Crossfire: Legion’s situation is that you might not recognise it as a spin-off at all. That’s because the series is a big old blind spot for the Western world. Crossfire is an enormously successful Korean FPS that bears more than a passing resemblance to Counter-Strike - all right angles, assault weapons, and de_dust2 - but dwarfs even Steam’s most popular game for player numbers. With 690 million participants across 80 countries, it’s the biggest online FPS in the world. In China, where the game is a major cultural force, a coming-of-age television drama about two young Crossfire players has been watched 1.8 billion times. Bridger-what? Geralt of Where? The upshot of all that success is that Crossfire radiates money, and some of it is now funding new games from prestigious Western developers. Remedy is working on a campaign FPS in the classic COD style. And Blackbird Interactive is building an RTS named Legion.

                    <span>When I first heard about Wordle, I assumed it was an app, and went looking for it on various app stores. I didn&#x27;t find it - Wordle is instead a website, and completely free.

It turns out I&#x27;m not alone. App developer Steven Cravotta explained on Twitter that a completely unrelated game he released five years ago, also called Wordle, has had a major increase in downloads over the past few weeks. And now he&#x27;s donating the money he&#x27;s made to charity.

Those out there who are looking for a reason to buy and play Ys IX: Monstrum Nox have a few new features to look forward to when you finally pull the trigger. Seriously, though. Play Ys VIII and IX!
Coming in a major update to the Steam version of the game is local co-op. In the trailer above you can see the feature in action, which lets a second player take control of someone as long as multiple playable characters are present in the scene. In the Steam post announcing the update, it talks about the changes from co-op in the previous Ys title, saying, &quot;the second player is largely equivalent to the primary player in terms of capabilities in Ys IX, including movement and combat abilities, using Monstrum Gifts, discovering and triggering landmarks, enemies and events, opening chests, picking up collectibles, and initiating dialogue. Only interacting with menus and the map is restricted to player one.&quot; Pretty impressive for shoehorning multiplayer into a decidedly single-player experience.
Also joining the game is 16:10 support, which allows for slightly narrower displays to be supported. One of those displays sporting that aspect ratio is the upcoming Steam Deck handheld device, which the developers luckily had on hand to snap a picture of the game running on it. 
Topping off the update are some bug fixes to clean up some issues from launch. You can check out the full developer post right here. 
Have you played Ys IX and does multiplayer sound like a way you&#x27;d want to play it? Let us know in the comments!</span>

                    <span>Deck builders are played with cards, but all too often, they’re lumped into core card games like Magic: The Gathering, Hearthstone, Legends of Runeterra, Yu-Gi-Oh!, or others. While certainly there are some awesome competitive tabletop deck builders to check out (Dominion rules, folks), in games today they’re often roguelike dungeon crawls, allowing players to unlock new options, distill their decks down to only the best cards, and try out a wealth of strategies. In fact, you don’t have to like card games at all to enjoy a good deck builder, as they’re more akin to a mechanics-focused turn-based RPG in style and spirit. Anyway, do yourself a favor and check out one of these titles for a great look at what the genre has to offer.

While the internet may be more familiar with fantasy sports such as football or baseball, that doesn&#x27;t mean the gamers of the world can&#x27;t have a little fun too. From God of War to Red Dead Redemption II and everything in between, join Game Informer as we pick the best games of 2018 and form the ultimate fantasy teams.
But how does the process work? The panel of Ben Reeves, John Carson, Kim Wallace, Alex Stadnik, and Alex Van Aken have assembled to select five games apiece from 2018 to create the most robust roster possible. After randomizing the draft order, each person will have time to decide. At the end of the round, the order reverses, and the fun continues from the fifth person back to the first.
Sounds pretty standard, right? You can fill your list with as many great games as possible and create the video game equivalent of the 1990s Chicago Bulls. That&#x27;s where you&#x27;re wrong. If you&#x27;ve played fantasy sports before, you&#x27;re well aware that picking players in the late rounds can get rough. In that spirit, each panel member in today&#x27;s video must select one title off Metacritic&#x27;s list of the worst games of 2018. In a year of such high highs, it&#x27;s incredible how low the lows can get.
But why are we drafting games like this? Just for fun? Why no, for the community validation, of course! That&#x27;s right, folks. You get to vote on who has the strongest list. Be sure to head over to our Discord to select the editor with the strongest list, and we&#x27;ll read the results on this week&#x27;s episode of The GI Show! Thank you so much for your participation and please let us know what you thought of the segment in the comments below!</span>

While fans were hopeful about Halo Infinite, not many could have predicted the dominant return Master Chief would make at the end of 2021. The multiplayer suite blew players away with a joyous amalgamation of pitch-perfect combat and some of the best multiplayer maps the series had seen in a long time. The campaign refocused in scale and featured some of the most emotional character moments we’ve seen from Master Chief and Cortana. Not only that, but 343 Industries opened Zeta Halo to players in ways unheard of in a Halo game, creating a delightful semi-open-world experience that features some of the greatest movement the series has ever seen.
But it wasn’t all perfect. Multiplayer staples such as Slayer and Free For All weren’t included at launch. Forge an…</span>

                    <span>Changes are coming to Halo Infinite&#x27;s store starting this week, according to a series of tweets from Jerry Hook, the head of design at 343 Industries. 
Users have had concerns about the pricing in Infinite&#x27;s shop since it launched in late November, and it looks like this week will finally see a change in course for what is offered and for how much. Jerry Hook starts his mini-thread announcing the impending update, saying, &quot;We’ve been monitoring the discussions on the Shop, bundles, and pricing closely since launch. Using data and community feedback, we’re going to begin rolling out changes to how we package and price items in Halo Infinite – and it all starts next week.&quot; His thread continues, &quot;Starting Tuesday, the Shop experience will vary week-to-week. We are focused on reducing pricing across the board, providing stronger values in our bundles, starting to put individual items outside of bundles, and more.&quot; 
We’ve been monitoring the discussions on the Shop, bundles, and pricing closely since launch. Using data and community feedback, we’re going to begin rolling out changes to how we package and price items in @Halo Infinite – and it all starts next week.
January 15, 2022
With the week-to-week adjustments being made, it seems like the in-game store will be evolving and changing based on trends over the coming months. Hook speaks to that in his third tweet, saying, &quot;We will be trying new things throughout the rest of the season so that we can continue to learn and improve for the future. Please keep the feedback coming during this process and I hope to see you all next week for the Cyber Showdown event!&quot; 
What the changes are, we&#x27;ll just have to wait and see. Hopefully you can get your Spartan Cat ears or space pickle charms on the cheap going forward. If there are any interesting developments in the Halo Infinite shop, we have a story that we keep updated just about every week to reflect the deals on offer. Check there tomorrow afternoon to see if anything substantial has taken place.</span>

                    <span>When titles like The Secret of Monkey Island became rarer, so too did Jamie Ottilie’s time with the adventure genre, and, like many, he moved on to other increasingly popular types of games. But then, Telltale Games was formed – roughly a decade after the golden age of adventure games – built from the ashes of LucasArts by a number of former employees, piquing Ottilie’s interest immediately.
Ottilie enjoyed the studio’s first handful of games, but his interest reached new heights following the first season of Telltale’s The Walking Dead, the game that most agree put the studio on the map. And from there, the Telltale of old was born – a studio seemingly destined to create excellent stories in pre-existing universes such as The Walking Dead, and later Game of Thrones and Batman.

                    <span>Ubisoft isn&#x27;t the only publisher with its hands on the Avatar franchise. This weekend, Disney and Tencent unveiled plans to release Avatar: Reckoning, an MMO role-playing shooter slated for iOS and Android. Development duties are for Reckoning are being handled by Archosaur Games.
The press release announcing the title gives us some info on what to expect. &quot;Avatar: Reckoning will transport players to never-before-seen parts of Pandora where they will meet new Na’vi clans fighting to defend their home, battle powerful RDA troops seeking to exploit the resources of the moon, and encounter spectacular alien creatures.&quot; Players will be able to take on challenges solo, co-op, or in &quot;dynamic multiplayer matches.&quot; You&#x27;ll level up and equip your Na&#x27;vi with weaponry throughout the story mode experience.
Avatar: Reckoning is being developed on Unreal Engine 4 and is set to release sometime this year.
The other adventure taking place on James Cameron&#x27;s Pandora is Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, developed by Ubisoft&#x27;s Massive Entertainment. Using the Snowdrop Engine that powers The Division 2, its debut trailer from last summer is a stunner. Go check out that footage to see how Ubi is translating the film franchise onto consoles and PC.</span>

                    <span>Never judge a book by its cover. That’s a great lesson in general, especially for video games, but even more so for a select batch of games that are far more than they appear on the surface. While many games feature narrative and mechanical twists, these particular titles go the extra mile to hide their true natures, intentionally so, to surprise players. 
I love games that subvert expectations like this, but they can be hard to seek out or suggest to others. For one, they may initially appear out of your wheelhouse. If you don’t play visual novels, then Doki Doki Literature Club, for example, may pass you by even if the things it’s really going for would be up your alley. That also makes these sorts of games hard to pitch to skeptical friends without giving away what truly makes them spec…</span>

                    <span>Over the weekend, the yearly Awesome Games Done Quick speedrunning marathon concluded, breaking records along the way, including the amount of money the event has ever collected for charity during one event. 
🏁TIME 🏁
#AGDQ2022 has raised a total amount of $3,416,729 for @preventcancer! This is officially the most we&#x27;ve ever raised in the history of @GamesDoneQuick - ANOTHER WR🏆
January 16, 2022
Taking the top spot in donation totals for any Games Done Quick event, at the time of the marathon ended the grand donation sum clocked in at $3,416,729 with even more money sent in after the fact. The prior record sat around $3.1 million, with the new total handily surpassing that number.
Awesome Games Done Quick and its aptly-named summer event sibling Summer Games Done Quick are week-long stream marathons where speedrunners show off their quickest times to complete games and collect funds for a deserving charity. This year&#x27;s AGDQ featured some very fun exhibitions of games like Yu-Gi-Oh! Forbidden Memories, a blindfolded run of Sekiro, Eternal Darkness (played for the first time at AGDQ), and Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade. Capping off the show was a 1 hour 21 minute &quot;All Bosses&quot; playthrough of Metal Gear Solid. Check out any of the runs from this past week at the Games Done Quick YouTube page.
Congratulations to the Prevent Cancer Foundation, the staff of Games Done Quick and runners involved in ADGQ, and those who donated for a great cause. If you&#x27;re interested in bolstering the donation total even more, it looks like the AGDQ page is still accepting submissions.</span>

                    <span>Imagine waking up to find the little-known passion project you have been working on for years has rapidly become popular beyond your wildest expectations. It&#x27;s the kind of success developers dream of, but so few achieve. Even if a game has a fantastic story, inventive mechanics, and a unique style, there is no guarantee it will prosper. The competition is fierce, with tons of games releasing every day, and it’s a struggle to catch people’s attention. And yet, there are success stories of developers who managed to overcome all these hurdles and make unexpected sensations, like Darkest Dungeon, Stardew Valley, and Valheim. These games&#x27; creators are unanimously grateful to their fans for giving them a shot, and they acknowledge the creative freedom their success provides. However, they also s…</span>

Turtle Rock Studios helped define the cooperative squad-based genre with Left 4 Dead and its recently released spiritual successor, Back 4 Blood. 10 Chamber Collective, a small group of ex-Payday developers, was undoubtedly inspired by the acclaimed zombie-slaying franchise. In truth, the studio’s debut project, GTFO, is Payday meets Left 4 Dead, but with a deliciously dangerous learning curve. GTFO’s satisfying mix of tactical action and all-encompassing uneasiness will likely appeal to FPS fanatics yearning for an electrifying challenge. And now that its two-year Early Access period has ended, 10 Chamber Collective’s survival…</span>

                    <span>Mario Kart is a fantastic franchise – one of Nintendo’s best, easily – but it’s time for it to come to an end. Now, that’s a bit of a loaded phrase, but I wholeheartedly mean it: we don’t need another Mario Kart game. What we do need, however, is a brand new exciting kart game from Nintendo. It should feature not just Mario (can’t leave behind the Kart King like that) and the gang, but Link, Zelda, and other Hyrulian characters, too. We should still be able to race with the Inklings from Splatoon, but if I want, let me race as Protagonist from Astral Chain or even Lappy. 
What I’m proposing is the end of Mario Kart and the beginning of Nintendo Kart.

Seemingly thousands of enemies on screen, and the physics to simulate them being hurled about.

You can watch said trailer below, released alongside the news that the game has slipped into next month.

Is indie developer Daniel Linssen&#x27;s new free game Tumbledown Drive a Jump King and Getting Over It With Bennett Foddy-inspired platformer in which you are a car hopping up a mountain, or is this another hallucination?

A good way to share info in an abstract, but not the prettiest. So after some Wordle players started recreating their solutions inside the pretty town-building toy Townscaper, someone went ahead and made a tool which automatically does the work for you. The result, your solution built as a colourful building, for you to view in your browser.

Or is this the one where we&#x27;ve had a while to realise that the promise of hope in the new year is, once again, a terrible lie? Perhaps. Either way, I refuse to submit. Enjoy the heck out of this Monday. Have your favourite thing for dinner. Watch your favourite movie. Have a bath and put on a cool playlist of songs and sing really loud to annoy your neighbour.
Alternatively, play some cool video games! Here are the ones that make me smile when I&#x27;m feeling blue.

It’s essentially an AI-fuelled upgrade to Nvidia’s DSR downsampling tool, aiming to more intelligently render the frames of your games so that they appear more detailed – without the same performance loss that comes with standard DSR. It’s an intriguing new feature that could make some of the best graphics cards even better, and I’ve been trying it out to see if it performs as effectively as Nvidia claims.

On one hand, thank god it was only £119,000 because if it was the millions that some ugly Twitter avatars have sold for, every other mercenary games company would ramp up their own NFT initiatives.

More than that, the runner known as &quot;Mitchriz&quot; was blindfolded from start to finish, guided by a combination of memory and feeling-out environments. In two hours! Ludicrious.

                    <span>I enjoy the sub-genre of meme about Sad Murder Dads as much as the next gal. Heck, I enjoy those lads themselves. From Kratos in God Of War, to Joel in The Last Of Us, and even less story-focused murder dads like Soldier 76, dudes rock. Successfully rehabilitated and reimagined as father figures struggling to inhabit that role and accept their emotions, in some very good games to boot. Developers who were hot young guns in the 00s are now tired middle-aged dads themselves, and as a result the art they consume and, more to the point, the art they want to make looks radically different. I&#x27;m not having a go at that; that&#x27;s just life, is what that is.
But what I&#x27;m asking is, what&#x27;s the mum equivalent? Because I really want to see someone give a mum story the same big budget, fun epic treatment that Kratos got in God Of War. At the same time, I also dread this coming to pass.

A few would-be players, however, found themselves unable to play, with the game throwing up &quot;out of memory&quot; error messages when they really shouldn&#x27;t be out of memory. The devs have been looking into the issue, and released a potential fix on an opt-in experimental branch on Steam. It sounds like it fixes the problem for some people, but not all.

                    <span>Šifrování disku je užitečná věc a Linux ji má v základu zabudovanou. Co když ale chceme šifrovat disk na serveru a zároveň nechceme přijít o možnost automatického startu. Řešení nabízí duo Tang a Clevis.</span>

                    <span>Milan Brož, správce cryptsetup, objevil zranitelnost CVE-2021–4122 v LUKS 2.2.0 a novějších. Jde o zneužití reencryption, tedy přešifrování za běhu. Útočník s přístupem k disku a bez znalosti hesla může pozměnit metadata LUKS2, aby to vypadalo, že reencryption bylo v průběhu přerušeno. Zařízení se bude tvářit normálně a po zadání platného hesla skutečným uživatelem se zařízení bez varování rozšifruje. Změna bude vidět pouze v luksDump.</span>

                    <span>God Of War is out now, as of Friday at 5pm. This gives PC gamers their first chance to experience 2018&#x27;s hottest memes, yelling &quot;Boy!&quot; at one another, and writing thinkpieces about videogame dads. It also gives them the chance to satisfyingly throw an axe through a lot of skeletons.

                    <span>Following a wee technical hiccup on my part, ladies and gentlemen, The Weeknd. I&#x27;m already thinking ahead to E3 2022 because a friend&#x27;s planning part of their wedding celebrations for mid-June and I don&#x27;t know if... how strange to be missing the steadfast, certain, reliability of E3. Anyway. What are you playing this weekend? Here&#x27;s what we&#x27;re clicking on.

                    <span>Popularity, I have learned from American teen television shows, isn&#x27;t all it&#x27;s cracked up to be. While Square Enix haven&#x27;t been bombed by the local mafioso, joined a murderous D&amp;D cult, or discovered their dad is a serial killer and they too have the serial killer genes (thanks, Riverdale!), they did find such overwhelming success with Final Fantasy XIV that they temporarily stopped selling the MMORPG. They couldn&#x27;t expand servers quickly enough to meet demand, see, leading to login queues and frustration. But now things are settling enough to to start selling it again, and they have big plans to expand servers.

                    <span>I&#x27;m not sure I trust the Page of Cups. As imagined by Pamela Colman Smith and A.E. Waite in the 1909 Rider-Waite Tarot, he&#x27;s a cocky young man in a floral tunic, standing by the seashore hefting a goblet. There&#x27;s a fish peeking out of the goblet and the Page appears to be gossiping with it, perhaps sharing a joke about the artist, because honestly, what kind of artist paints a guy talking to fish. Or is he thinking about offering us the cup? The set of his jaw is ambiguous.
When drawn in an upright position, the Page suggests a flash of inspiration reeled from the mind&#x27;s ocean, or a dazzling opportunity. In this guise, he&#x27;s been a good friend to Ami Y. Cai, a game creator and illustrator from Kentucky - though in her first Tarot deck, Stephanie Pui-Mun Law&#x27;s Shadowscapes Tarot, the symbolism has been flipped around a little, the Page depicted as a mermaid peering into a steaming bowl. “Sometimes sparks come to me through conversations, or while I&#x27;m doing something else,” Cai tells me over Zoom. “So when I see the Page of Cups, I know that a creative opportunity is coming my way.”

                    <span>Puzzle games don&#x27;t need a plot, or even a theme or setting. When very abstracted ones throw one in it&#x27;s often an indulgence, or just an excuse to hang the aesthetics around something the devs happen to like. Blink Planets seemed like this at first, and that was fine! A little sexy hexy is all you really need if it&#x27;s done right, after all. I cannot believe I just said that.


Partway through though, I realised Blink Planets isn&#x27;t just about connecting things with lines of tiles. It really is about the urban planning its setting suggests.

                    <span>Earlier this week, Nvidia quietly announced a kind of DLSS-adjacent downsampling tech: Deep Learning Dynamic Super Resolution (DLDSR). It aims to improve image sharpness and quality on GeForce RTX graphics cards, using AI to reduce the performance loss of Nvidia’s existing DSR feature, and it’s now available to install and enable through GeForce Game Ready Driver 511.23.

                    <span>Over the holidays, I decided to treat myself to the gift of funk, and bought myself a neat little acoustic bass. The guitar arrived as promised; I am still waiting on the funk. Any day now. In the meantime, I’ve taught myself the riff for Valley Of The Fallen Star, better known as the Cosmo Canyon theme from Final Fantasy VII. I’m not sure if I can adequately put into words how the original composition of the track makes me feel, but I am certain I’m not the only one.It is sonic nostalgia for a simpler time, where following a talking dog’s weeble uncle to the projection of the cosmos he kept in his loft did nothing to shatter my emotional investment in a story.

So hey, look, here&#x27;s Democracy 4, the latest in the government simulator series from Positech Games. After 15 months in early access, it&#x27;s now out in full: a detailed model of how Positech think politics works, for you to try to gain and keep power.

                    <span>Fear not the fate of the Steam Deck, Valve’s ambitious, SteamOS-based handheld gaming PC. While the Deck’s release date was originally planned for sometime in December 2021, a Steam Community update from Valve has assured that they’re on track for the rescheduled launch next month.


“First and foremost, we’re on track to ship Steam Deck on time. Global pandemic, supply issues, and shipping issues notwithstanding, it looks like we&#x27;ll be able to start getting these out the door by the end of February”, so says the post.

                    <span>Správa specializovaných zásad webového aplikačního firewallu (WAF), které zajišťují trvale robustní zabezpečení aplikací, je práce na plný úvazek. Organizace, které si nemohou dovolit plně spravované podnikové řešení nebo zaměstnávat potřebné zdroje, mají problém udržet si přehled o nejnovějších útocích a ochranných opatřeních potřebných k zajištění konzistentního zabezpečení a shody s předpisy. Podle Johna Breedena II, Barracuda CSO Online, Barracuda WAF as-a-Service rozhodně není jen obyčejný firewall. Toto cloudové zabezpečení aplikací ochrání firemní data, její reputaci a pomáhá zajistit shodu s předpisy.</span>

                    <span>Riot Games have outlined their strategy for their next five years, saying they think of themselves &quot;not as a games company but as a gamer’s company.&quot; The lengthy post, credited to Riot CEO Nicolo Laurent, outlines not what they specifically intend to make, but the kinds of things they want to make and the internal changes designed to make it happen.

The post also acknowledges Riot Games&#x27; recent history, including their settlement last month of a gender discrimination lawsuit stretching back to 2018.

                    <span>Lockpicking is a frequently maligned component of many games, but as FPS minigames go I&#x27;ve always had a soft spot for it. I&#x27;d rather pick a thousand more locks in Oblivion than hack another Pipemania computer terminal in BioShock. 

Enter Museum Of Mechanics: Lockpicking, a curated, playable exhibition of lockpicking minigames throughout the history of videogames. It&#x27;s now available via Steam, with a bunch of new additions since we last wrote about it.

                    <span>The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. The diary of Samuel Pepys. The movie Mary Poppins. For years, people have sought to understand English culture and history by consulting such artifacts. When future generations wish to understand what England was like in the early 21st century, they&#x27;ll simply need to play a Duke Nukem 3D level. Since June 2021, Dan Douglas has been making a DN3D level which captures facets of the real England: town centres, Wetherspoons, Greggs, a sausage roll nativity, Michael Gove dancing, lads, absolute madmen, life under Covid, performative patriotism, the Brexit bus, and so much more. It&#x27;s astonishing.

                    <span>Roguelike platformer Spelunky 2 is out now on PC Game Pass. I&#x27;m less excited and more angry, actually. This is because it&#x27;s my nemesis, a game I know is good but I&#x27;m absolutely shocking at. Alongside it, the new Left 4 Dead-like co-op shooter The Anacrusis enters early access later today and will be on Game Pass from the start. Can&#x27;t wait to fall into a pit of spikes with one, then blub about my misfortunes in the other as I pew pew aliens.

                    <span>It&#x27;s been over a decade since a core game in The Settlers series last made landfall on PC, and during that time the real-time management landscape has arguably changed quite a bit. There have been some great building games that have risen up, and even developer Blue Byte (now Ubisoft Dusseldorf)&#x27;s own Anno series has staked a powerful claim to the city-building throne. But this incarnation of The Settlers isn&#x27;t so much about connecting to the series&#x27; past as it is about laying down foundations for the future. It&#x27;s had a slightly rocky road to launch, suffering several delays and refunded pre-orders after being postponed indefinitely back in 2020, but at long last this reboot of the classic city-building conquest-me-do is finally ready to beat down our door and come barrelling in. It&#x27;s launching in full on March 17th, and I&#x27;ve been hands on with an early version of the upcoming closed beta build that will be running from January 20th-24th. So settle in, folks. Here&#x27;s how it&#x27;s shaping up.

                    <span>Happy 2022! New year, same old us. The Electronic Wireless Show Podcast will make no effort to change or better ourselves; this is our promise to you, listener. For our first episode of the new year we&#x27;re doing the traditional &quot;what games are we most looking forwards to&quot; episode. Yes, our most anticipated games. There is very little crossover, and lots of orc chat.
Before that, though, we&#x27;re lucky enough to have scored an interview with the &quot;It&#x27;s me, Blorko&quot; guy. Yes, we have the man who came up with this winter&#x27;s most fashionable Marvel-based viral tweet, live and on the podcast (I mean, technically he is on the podcast every week but this week we ask him about the Blorko thing for like 20 minutes).

                    <span>I wouldn’t call it a new year’s resolution – mine for 2022 are learning piano and using fewer dashes – but generally I want to try new things with my PC. And one such opportunity recently presented itself via the new Turtle Beach VelocityOne Flight yoke controller: I was going to learn how to fly.


In Microsoft Flight Simulator, obviously, but this honking great console of handles, buttons, joysticks and levers definitely looked like the right tool for the job. A simple flight stick this is not: there’s a full 180-degree yoke handle, an integrated display that can data like flight times, and a modular (but included as standard) throttle quadrant. The kind of thing you might own if your PC resembles a bisected turbine.

                    <span>On a stretch of futuristic tarmac, something clicked. Yellow quest markers hadn&#x27;t built my relationships in Cyberpunk 2077. When a job needed doing, then they&#x27;d steer me in the right direction. But for those initial sparks of story, my cellphone had been key. Chats and texts buzzed into my brain at all hours. &quot;Hey V&quot;, &quot;V, got a minute?&quot;, &quot;V!&quot;
Characters would get in contact with me, not the other way around. And I liked that. In fact, I&#x27;d say it helped build a living, breathing world more than Night City&#x27;s towering skyscrapers and moving billboards. More than, perhaps, any other big RPG I&#x27;ve played over the last couple of years.

They&#x27;ve just held a stream revealing plans for the second year of support and content, giving a look at the new Elusive Target Arcade mode (this time, the murders are permanent, not ephemeral) and announcing Freelancer mode. That will give Ian Hitman a safe house again, and send him out to take down organisations through chains of missions with randomised elements. Plus, the whole trilogy is coming to Game Pass.

Armor Games, a browser gaming titan of yore and more recently a conventional PC publisher too, have announced they&#x27;re switching permanently to a four-day working week of 32 hours. They join a small but growing group of companies in switching, most notably Eidos Montreal who announced last year that they were going to four-day workweeks. Alright, who&#x27;s next?

                    <span>It&#x27;s probably more trouble than it&#x27;s worth to sidestep around comparisons to Mount &amp; Blade with Sands Of Salzaar. It&#x27;s mostly the structure. Sands Of Salzaar drops you into a world of dynamically warring factions. You can join or compete with them by founding your own, or ignore them to beat up roving bandits, clear out combined dungeon/random encounter sites, and do odd jobs for named NPCs. Some of those figures are powerful, unkillable, and recruitable, although you may have to win them over with favours or gifts. You&#x27;ll likely do a bit of everything, but mostly you&#x27;ll be smashing armies into each other in 2D skirmishes.
It&#x27;s no clone, though. While its component parts are familiar, Salzaar does enough of its own thing to win my affection, and its odd but sincere personality shines despite some muddy edges.

                    <span>The studio co-founded by former Valve writer Chet Faliszek and former Riot designer Kimberly Voll have released The Anacrusis into early access today, a Left 4 Dead-like set in 70s space. Much like its undead predecessor, this is a game where four players team up and pew pew through waves of alien nasties. But it’s not as despairing as its zombified brethren. This is upbeat and colourful and at times, really quite silly.
Yes, it&#x27;s still pretty similar to Left 4 Dead, but is home to a few things that help separate it from its zombified brethren. To test this stuff out, we had a full team of four in our hands-on preview session at the very end of last year – myself, Imogen (RPS in peace), Katharine, and Chet himself, who steered us through encounters with supreme patience. All in all, we sampled a ‘full run’, so a total of four levels, each with lots of, “Oh god, oh no,” moments. And it’s safe to say we had a lot of fun with it.

                    <span>Nine months after its debut on Nintendo Switch, Monster Hunter Rise today launched on PC. Capcom&#x27;s latest lizard-skinning simulator is a good&#x27;un, and what we played of it pre-release seemed like a solid PC port. However, now the game is out in the world, some would-be players are being blocked out by a bug which doesn&#x27;t let them even start a new save. Still, the majority of folks seem to be quite happily hollowing out dogs to make slippers.

                    <span>Watching the trailer for upcoming craft-o-survival game Forever Skies, I now understand how people who fear the ocean must feel about Subnautica. While I&#x27;m at my happiest in water, I know depths and strange sealife give many others the heebie-jeebies. However, heights make me pray for death. So a game about exploring the skies and skyscrapers above the ruins of human civilisation in a customisable airship, ah yes, I would like to die now, thank you very much.

                    <span>Valorant Episode 4 has kicked off, bringing with it new agent Neon who - like that famous blue hedgehog - goes fast. They&#x27;re able to sprint and slide around maps at blistering speeds, which might seem at odds with the game&#x27;s tactical pace, but they fit into the roster nicely. Thing is, you&#x27;ve got to be brave enough to get the most out of their move set, which rewards ballsy plays over careful corner turns. It&#x27;s safe to say I struggled to break out of my tentative shell, but when I did? Hoo boy, what a thrill.

                    <span>Given that we&#x27;ve still only seen scraps of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 after years of development and with launch supposedly mere months away, I suppose it&#x27;s not a surprise to hear the game is delayed. The developers, GSC Game World today announced that they&#x27;ve pushed the launch back by seven months, giving the first-person explore-o-shooter a new release date of the 8th of December. It&#x27;s the usual perfectly sensible reason: they want it to be good, and they think it needs more time to be good.

                    <span>Fatherly axe-‘em-up God of War is out on PC this week, and I’ve been dragging my disappointing son around the Nine Realms to see how it copes with the jump from PlayStation to Windows. The answer: pretty well! Like previous marquee Sony port Horizon Zero Dawn, this is a game that already looked lovely on console, and the extra muscle of even a modest PC rig can deliver sizeable boosts to both visual quality and frames-per-second.

                    <span>In the eight year gap between 2010&#x27;s more conventional sexy gore fest God Of War 3 and this new and improved action-dadventure God Of War, the angry Ancient Greek warboy Kratos handed in his god-killing badge and gun to live in Norse mythology&#x27;s woods with his wife Faye and their son Atreus. When Faye dies, Kratos &amp; Son go on a journey to scatter her ashes from the top of a mountain. This becomes a micro rumination on familial relationships, a macro world-saving epic of legendary proportions, and a hack and slash fest that&#x27;ll have you grinning from ear to ear. On balance, then, I am Team Fridge Faye.
I played this God Of War on its previously exclusive release on PlayStation in 2018, and it lived in my memory as a 70 hour poetic battle between gods and monsters. Revisiting it again on PC, it turns out that it&#x27;s actually only about 20 hours long, but it looms so large as an experience that turning it off at the end feels like stumbling into daylight, having spent many weeks in a firelit, sweaty hunting lodge in a Norwegian pine forest, slamming mead and singing songs about warriors tearing goats in two. There are a lot of big warriors in God Of War. There are a lot of very big things in it in general: statues, dragons, big angry rocks. And a big man, because the titular Kratos, as a yardstick to measure size, is already incongruously big, just so many sacks of salted beef held together by leather armour.

                    <span>Much has been made of how long games take to complete this week. After Dying Light 2 developers Techland boasted that it would take 500 hours to fully complete the game over the weekend, the internet&#x27;s collective groan over the revelation was reportedly heard from the far reaches of space. Personally, I think it&#x27;s a preposterous figure for a single-player game, but as someone who also maintains an active spreadsheet of all my various playtime stats (yes, really), it also got me thinking. Is 500 hours really so nonsensical in the grand scheme of things? I asked the team what their most played game on Steam is to find out. 
And as it turns out, Dying Light 2&#x27;s 500 hour completion time ain&#x27;t got nothing on some of our favourite time hogs...

Soon, Call Of Duty: Vanguard and Warzone will play host to a cursed set of Attack On Titan cosmetics, including gun bits and an Operator skin. They are frightening and confusing.

                    <span>Wordle has engrossed me for a couple of weeks, along with much of the rest of the internet. It&#x27;s also a free, simple word game, meaning it&#x27;s relatively easy to recreate. Naturally, other developers are building their own twists on its core.

Among them, Absurdle is my favourite, an &quot;adversarial version&quot; of the game where the winning word changes as you guess. I&#x27;m also fond of Sweardle, however, a version designed for four-letter words.

                    <span>After trundling across the desert with a wee sandskiff in the delightful Far: Lone Sails, developers Okomotive will soon invite us to sail above and below a strange ocean in the sequel. They announced today that Far: Changing Tides will launch on the 1st of March and oh goodness me, it&#x27;s another anticipated indie that will be available through Game Pass from the start. (Anticipated by us, anyway—it&#x27;s one of our most anticipated games of 2022.)

                    <span>Ever since Alice Bee first played Strange Horticulture, she&#x27;s raved about the mysteries and merchandising of running a weird plant shop. Lots of studying and cataloguing plants, serving customers, and feeling proud of your wee business. Plus solving mysteries in ways only an occult plant shop owner can. Not long to wait now, as the makers announced today that the game will launch on the 21st of January.

                    <span>Over the weekend, Dying Light 2 developers Techland boasted that it would take &quot;500 hours to complete the game&quot;. This turned out not to be the exciting selling point they expected for the open-world zombie-mashing parkour-o-shooter. Many found this claim exhausting because oh my god 500 hours is over 20 days, what do you think we do with our lives, and how much of that is busywork? After initially backtracking to clarify that 500 hours is how long it&#x27;d take to do absolutely everything, Techland have now explained that you can finish the game&#x27;s main story in 20 hours, or 80 if you hit every side quest too.

                    <span>The director of Moon and Warcraft is still dreaming of making a movie version of Full Throttle, the classic LucasArts adventure game about rough &#x27;n&#x27; tough bikers and lovers. A year ago Duncan Jones released a tentative script he banged out in a fit of procrastination, and in 2022 he&#x27;s still thinking of the smell of asphalt. In a cheeky wee tweet over the weekend, he asked fans to bug LucasOwners Disney to let him do it.

                    <span>These days, you can&#x27;t shake a stick without bouncing brown beams around the room. Raytracing has been a hot high-end graphics trend for a few years, with new games boasting support for the complex lighting simulators and old games being retrofitted with shine. This year, a new Half-Life mod will add raytracing support to Valve&#x27;s seminal shooter, and even as someone usually perfectly happy with old games looking old, I think it doesn&#x27;t look half-bad. See for yourself in the new video, below.

                    <span>As we’ve already seen from the demo, the PC version of Monster Hunter Rise spruces itself up considerably from the Nintendo Switch original. It’s not a match for Monster Hunter World on overall visual fidelity and detail, but the upside is that it’s easy to go a-huntin’ at high frame rates even if you’re on low end hardware. To whit, Monster Hunter Rise’s PC requirements go even lower than World’s, only asking for a GT 1030 or Radeon RX 550 at minimum.

                    <span>After the roaring success of Monster Hunter: World back in 2018, the idea that the next big PC entry in Capcom&#x27;s dino pants craft &#x27;em up is a game that originally started life on the Nintendo Switch is bound to ruffle a few feathers. But far from being a step down from World, Monster Hunter Rise is every bit its equal - and Capcom&#x27;s stellar work with this PC port has given it a much-needed buff and polish to really make it shine. Not only does Rise offer the same seamless and expansive environments as World, but it also adds a few new twists to make tracking down its titular titans even more enjoyable.

                    <span>Zynga, the company whose games made being Facebook friends with your family even more annoying, are selling to Take-Two. The owners of Rockstar and 2K plan to buy up Zynga shares in a deal that&#x27;ll value the company at $12.7 billion (£9.4b). Take-Two hope to use Zynga&#x27;s social and mobile expertise to make more games based on their games. Sure sure, #business and all, but I&#x27;d rather spend that much money on 9.8 billion Greggs sausage rolls instead of Grand Theft Autoville or something.

                    <span>One of the presents I got for Christmas this year was a copy of PS5 exclusive Spider-Man: Miles Morales. I had about a week where I was completely by myself this year, and I spent it being Spidey and self-yeeting around New York. It&#x27;s a great game on many levels, and I especially liked that one of the outfits you can unlock through story missions is a scarf and ear warmers. Mostly though, it&#x27;s just made me think that web-swinging is the most fun way to get around in games, and more games should do it. By &quot;more games&quot;, I mean &quot;every game&quot;.

                    <span>I briefly posted before the new year about WorldBox - God Simulator, and Graham wrote about it over the weekend, too. It is a world simulation game that has no resource costs or goals, just simulated events. You make a world, plop some animals and fantasy races into it (and if you want, a bunch of dragons and wizards) and see what happens. I cannot stop playing it. And I wanted to give some more detailed examples of how the simulation works, especially if you just leave it running with little intervention.
I am a WorldBox scientist, you see (though merely a BSc at the moment), and my first experiments suggest that every civilisation, along a long enough time scale, is basically doomed. Big 2022 energy. In the case of WorldBox, this may be because at some stage the scientist running the experiment will get bored and drop in e.g. a tornado. That&#x27;s okay, because there are almost infinite experiments to run. I hope that isn&#x27;t how the simulation I am living in is being run. Oh no. Don&#x27;t think about it.

                    <span>Techland have achieved something incredible. With a single Dying Light 2 marketing Tweet, they caused the greatest mass exhalation seen, perhaps, ever. Thousands of adults were informed that to &quot;fully complete Dying 2: Stay Human, you&#x27;ll need at least 500 hours&quot; and collectively sighed at their desks, heads in hands. Even some hurried backtracking from Techland&#x27;s marketing team couldn&#x27;t save us from exhaustion.

                    <span>To me, Mass Effect ends about six hours into Mass Effect 1, when I get bored and wander off to play something else. I&#x27;ve had ears and eyes long enough to know that people were upset about the ending of Mass Effect 3 however, even after BioWare tweaked it. The original Mass Effect 3 had various &quot;Happy Ending Mods&quot; to change the close of Commander Shepard&#x27;s story, and now Mass Effect Legendary Edition does, too.

                    <span>Time moves so fast now that I remain convinced Games Done Quick happens once a fortnight. True or not, it&#x27;s definitely happening this week, beginning tomorrow, Sunday January 9th, and running through until Sunday January 16th.
