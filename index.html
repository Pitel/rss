                              <span>2024 will see the launch of Magic: The Gathering Universes Beyond Assassin&#x27;s Creed, a set that combines a historical TCG with one of the best video game universes ever made. 


Wizards of the Coast loves a good crossover with Magic: The Gathering, and it&#x27;s already had a banger in 2024 with the Fallout set. However, the year&#x27;s got so much more in store with yet another big collaboration, this time with the Assassin&#x27;s Creed universe. There&#x27;s a wealth of real and fictional history to draw upon from the universe, so much so that it must be hard to distill into a single set. Below, I&#x27;ve outlined everything you need to know about this set before it hits your local game store. 


When is the release date for the Magic: The Gathering Universes Beyond Assassin&#x27;s Creed set?

                              <span>The Nintendo Switch, much like the Game Boy and Nintendo DS before it, carries with it the idea that it&#x27;s a great console for kids. That&#x27;s undeniably true, because it&#x27;s Nintendo&#x27;s bread and butter, with characters such as Mario and Princess Peach starring in fantastic games appealing to a younger audience. 


However, the Switch is far from a console exclusively for kids. In fact, there are some amazing games for adults on it that regularly stop us from putting it down for far too many hours. With that in mind, I wanted to build a list of the best Nintendo Switch games for adults to show anyone on the fence about the console that there&#x27;s plenty for you to get stuck into the outside of the more powerful home consoles.

Meet the Ashiga Clan in Star Wars Outlaws


We learned more about one of the four main factions in the upcoming Star Wars Outlaws game, from an interview between Game Informer and some of the devs at Massive Entertainment. The Ashiga are a clan of Melitto – an insectoid species that’s been introduced in the Disney era – based on the planet Kijimi. “”It&#x27;s taking that principle of, &#x27;What would a crime syndicate that is essentially operating like an…</span>

                              <span>One of the most wish-listed Steam releases of all time, Manor Lords, was released on April 26. Despite being an Early Access release, Manor Lords is relatively bug-free. However, there is one pesky bug some players are encountering in regards to how homelessness and housing work. Thankfully, we&#x27;ve managed to figure out a Manor Lords homelessness bug fix.

How to fix the homelessness bug in Manor Lords


If you are having a problem getting homelessness to go away in Manor Lords, despite having an available house for them to move into, here is how to fix the homelessness bug:



Make sure you have an available home without an existing family for the homeless family to move into.


Do not upgrade your homeless camp into a worker&#x27;s camp until the homeless move into the home.


Save your game and then close Manor Lords and relaunch it. Load the save.


Wait a few minutes and the homeless should now move into a home.


Once all of the homeless have moved into homes, delete the homeless camp to prevent the bug from happening again.



This bug seems to resolve on its own after restarting the game client. However, it can still take some time for the actual Homelessness debuff to completely disappear. It should slowly go away over time, so keep checking on it.


If you&#x27;ve progressed a year since restarting and the homelessness still exists and yet they are all in homes, your actual save may be bugged. In this case, the only option is to start a completely new game from scratch. Make sure if you do this that you do not upgrade the homeless camp into a worker&#x27;s camp until you have made sure that all of the homeless have moved into a proper home that is connected to a road to prevent the homelessness bug from happening.

Other times, we want to know which one has a more fun factor to them. So, if you are looking for the most fun class to play in Diablo 4, check our rankings down below.

The following classes are going to be put in an unusual order. We all have our different playstyles, but the order of the five current classes in the game may wildly differ from power levels in the current state of the meta.

Sorcerer


The Sorcerer isn’t the strongest of the bunch, but their mobbing potential mixed with the visual effects of their abilities make them perhaps the most fun in the game. Chain lightning, fire…</span>

                              <span>The Gray Zone Warfare devs opened up about their plans to add the upcoming FPS to consoles, but it might not be the news everyone would have liked. 


Without an official release date, there isn&#x27;t much information about when players can finally play an official build of Gray Zone Warfare. Thankfully, Mindfinger Games finally confirmed that the early access release date will be revealed on Monday, April 29. Additionally, we now know what each edition of the title will come with, including cosmetic items, in-game currency, and larger locker sizes. But that all aside, players want to know which platforms the title will be available on.

Madfinger Games confirmed that the team&#x27;s goal is to eventually make Gray Zone Warfare available for consoles and add controller support to PC. But before players get too excited, players should temper their expectations. 


&quot;Consoles could be years out,&quot; Madfinger Games confirmed. &quot;We want to build the ultimate experience and make sure our vision truly comes into fruition first.&quot; 


This news will disappoint players hoping for an earlier release date, but users can at least rest assured that the devs eventually plan to add the title on consoles. As for everyone else, there is no way to pre-order Gray Zone Warfare without an official release date. However, players can add the title to their Steam wishlist, in order to get a notification when pre-orders go live.

                              <span>When a game&#x27;s visual style becomes such a distinct aspect of its personality, it can go one of two ways. You could net a stylish gem like MadWorld, or you could end up with another Drawn to Death. Thankfully, Death of a Wish — the hypnotic follow-up to melessthanthree&#x27;s Lucah: Born of a Dream — falls firmly into the former category.

There are a ton of classics being revisited this time around, and there&#x27;s also the typical mix of new games getting their very first run in the spotlight. Chief among them is the PlayStation 5 version of Alan Wake 2.

                              <span>Passcodes and puzzles are often required for Stellar Blade&#x27;s many doorways. One of the earliest ones is the Club Bpemr entryway during the Scavenger Adam quest. So, if you can&#x27;t find a way in, here&#x27;s how to solve the clock tower puzzle in Stellar Blade.


Stellar Blade Club Bpemr passcode in Scavenger Adam quest


While on the Scavenger Adam mission, Adam mentions that Club Bpemr&#x27;s password is related to time. To solve this, start by examining the clock tower. Notice that the hour hand is pointing at 12 and the minute hand is at 5. Combine these numbers to get the passcode, which is 1225. This is the answer to Stellar Blade&#x27;s clock tower puzzle.

The locked entryway and the clock are relatively close in range, so you can check back on the tower for confirmation. Given that the tower is broken, the answer will not change as time remains at a standstill (at least for this puzzle.)


Now that the doors have unlocked, it&#x27;s time to progress to the next area for the Scavenger Adam mission. The nearby fallen corpse harnesses some of Stellar Blade&#x27;s secrets. Also, remember to sit on the chair to replenish your health. Then, climb the ladder to get closer to the Hall of Records. Use the yellow paint as a guide, and Adam should confirm you&#x27;re on the right track. 


There&#x27;s a camp conveniently located on this pathway. It&#x27;s a safe spot where you can access more upgrades and save your game, ensuring your progress is secure.

To even start trade you need two things: A Trading Post and Regional Wealth.


A Trading Post is straightforward. You find it under the Trade tab in the construction menu. It costs four timber to build. Shouldn’t be a problem.


Regional wealth can be gained in a couple of ways. The first is by setting Land Tax at your manor. Careful: Being taxed makes people upset and lowers your approval. Understandable.


The second way is by trade, conveniently. If you’re overproducing absolutely anything, you can export it for wealth that you can then use to import some…</span>

As the harsh winter approaches, the need for Food and Fuel becomes even more crucial. While you&#x27;ll start with a few supplies, they won&#x27;t last forever. To avoid the threat of starvation and freezing, here&#x27;s how to get Food and Fuel in Manor Lords. 


Where to find Food in Manor Lords


To stock up on food in Manor Lords, start by constructing a Hunting Camp for meat and a Forager Hut for berries. You&#x27;ll find these structures in the Construction&#x27;s Gathering Section. The Hunting Camp can be set up without any construction costs, but the Forager Hut necessitates at least one. This strategic setup will ensure a steady supply of food for your growing population.

                              <span>Cloths are necessary for any peasant with modesty in Manor Lords, and it’s up to you to provide it to them. Using fleece from sheep is one such source for garb, and here’s how you can gain and keep sheep.


To farm sheep, you need only two things:



A Sheep Farm


A Livestock Trading Post



A pasture can be important too, but the farm itself is capable of holding 5 sheep. Not a lot, but it’s a start.


Once you have these established and have at least one family assigned to each one, click on your Livestock Trading Post, click the trading tab, and you can then set the number of sheep you want. Remember to select Import from the drop-down menu or Full Trade if you want to maintain a consistent population.


At that point, it’s a matter of waiting. Eventually, a sheep will arrive at your p…</span>

Most players are available in packs and on the transfer market, but there is a star striker who doesn&#x27;t require relying on pack luck. 


All eyes were on Erling Haaland in the Manchester City attack this season, and understandably so. In 26 Premier League matches, the Norwegian striker has 20 goals and five assists. However, there is another potential world-class player in blue who quietly had a great season when his name was called upon. Julian Alvarez contributed nine goals and nine assists and has appeared in 32 out of 33 Manchester City matches this season.

Manor Lords best settings for FPS


Once you&#x27;ve launched Manor Lords, immediately on the Main Menu you want to choose Settings. From here, click the Graphics tab at the top. This will list all the different graphical settings you can change for Manor Lords, which is what you will need to do. Here are the best settings to boost FPS in Manor Lords:



Display mode: Fullscreen


Resolution: Your native monitor resolution (Probably 1920x1080)


Anti-aliasing: FSR


FSR quality: Performance


VSync: Off


Max framerate: Your native monitor refresh rate (Probably 60)


Sharpening: Off


Shader quality: Low


Shadow quality: Low


Postprocess quality: Off


Bounced light approximation: Off


Volumetric clouds: Off


Terrain texture resolution: Low


View distance: Low


Grass density: Low


Grass distance: Low


Foliage quality: Low



After essentially putting all settings on Low, Manor Lords may look a bit less appealing. However, your FPS should be increased by a lot, which is the purpose of doing this. If you&#x27;re now getting more FPS but want to improve the graphical quality, increase these settings one-by-one then check your FPS to make sure they haven&#x27;t gone back down:



FSR quality


Terrain texture resolution


Sharpening


Shader quality


Foliage quality



For starters, switch FSR quality to Quality, which should provide a big boost in graphics while also keeping FPS boosted. Then try the rest of the options above, increasing them by just one setting at a time. For example, change Terrain texture resolution to Medium, check for proper FPS, then up again for High. As long as your FPS is still solid, move on to the next one.

The world of Pokemon products is fraught with a vast array of options. It&#x27;s difficult to know what that Pokemon fan in your life already owns and what they&#x27;d even want. You&#x27;d think buying for yourself would be easier, but no, Pokemon fans are the worst at figuring out what they want and distilling it into just one gift. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;ve listed out the best Pokemon gifts you should check out this year.

                              <span>Earlier on in Stellar Blade, you&#x27;ll progress through the first city of Eidos 7. Eventually, to progress further into the city, you&#x27;ll need to power up and use the Monorail. This is how to power up the Monorail in Stellar Blade so you can continue progressing through Eidos 7.


How to activate the Monorail


In order to activate the Monorail, you must head under the Monorail platform and solve a puzzle to power up the systems controlling the Monorail. Jump across the Monorail track and head left down the stairs. You should see a terminal that you can interact with.


Interacting with the terminal will present you with a puzzle of sorts that needs to be solved in order to turn on the Monorail. You can activate the rail by supplying power correctly via this terminal. Here is how to activate the Monorail:

Stellar Blade monorail puzzle solution


At a glance, the Stellar Blade monorail puzzle can be quite confusing. You need to insert the four sources of power you have (8, 6, 3, and 1) into four of the six holes at the bottom in order to fill up all the squares with power. The lines at the bottom connecting the holes to the square bars indicate that the power placed in that hole will be split amongst the bars it connects to. Therefore, the hole on the left will only power the bar on the left, while the hole on the right only powers the bar on the right.


Here is the Stellar Blade monorail puzzle solution:



3 Power in the left-most hole.


8 Power in the second hole.


Leave third hole empty.


6 Power in the fourth hole.


Leave fifth hole empty.


1 Power in the right-most hole.



This will properly supply power to each of the bars, which in turn will power up the Monorail in Stellar Blade!

While most maps only have one fire escape, and a couple of them are tricky to get to, one moon has up to three. The doors inside the interior building of each map are randomized, but outside on the surface, a Fire Exit is always in the same place.

                              <span>Do you also randomly find yourself craving a new fantasy book series to lose yourself in, on the off-chance that it might turn into your next big obsession? Because we certainly do!


Fantasy, as a subgenre of literary fiction, has been around for quite a while now. The better part of a century, to be precise. But suppose you’re not particularly inclined to echo what snobs say about speculative storytelling and extend that definition to cover the real breadth of the subject matter. In that case, fantasy has existed for as long as people have. 


Where once we would call on The Epic of Gilgamesh, or Homer’s Iliad, or The Poetic Edda to read humanity’s collective chronicle, this tradition is now being carried forward by authors who tap into the wellspring of their imagination to speak of wor…</span>

                              <span>Once you hit the end game of Warframe, min-maxing your build is the name of the game. While improving your builds is always important, those end-game items and mods push your builds over the edge. Take Primed mods for example, which improve your stats far more than the basic versions of said mods ever could. One such type of mod requires a special (and rare) Forma to use effectively. Here&#x27;s how to get Umbra Forma in Warframe.


Where to find Umbra Forma in Warframe


Image via Destructoid.


Umbra Forma is one of the most difficult items to get in Warframe, with the methods of getting one being limited and very specific. Those methods are as follows:



One is sometimes available within the reward track of Nora&#x27;s Nightwave, usually at Tier 29/30.


Completing the Mastery Rank 30 rankup test awards three Umbra Forma.


Acquiring a blueprint through The Steel Path Honors Shop, found by speaking with Teshin in any relay. This shop rotates weekly, with Umbra Forma available every 6-8 weeks.



You&#x27;re most likely to acquire one through the Steel Path Honors shop since 6-8 weeks and 150 Steel Essence isn&#x27;t much if you&#x27;re at the point of needing Umbra Forma to progress. However, that Nightwave reward can be another great way to acquire some early on. You just need to play Warframe consistently, and hitting Rank 29 shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.


When should you use an Umbra Forma?


While you may be excited once you acquire one, you should be cautious about where you slot in an Umbra Forma. Since they&#x27;re so rare, you need to use one on gear you&#x27;re certain you&#x27;ll be using consistently in the end-game. When I used two of mine, I used them for my Wisp Prime build, since I&#x27;m confident I&#x27;ll be using her as my main frame for the foreseeable future. Keep in mind that Archwings, Archguns, K-Drives, Necramechs, companions, and non-melee weapons can&#x27;t use Umbral Forma, since the mods don&#x27;t apply to them.

                              <span>As if mods in Warframe weren&#x27;t confusing enough, there are several groups that mods can belong to. Take Umbral mods for example, which are acquired through completing The Sacrifice main story quest. These mods are fine on their own, but when used in the same frame or melee weapon, are utterly devastating. One such group of mods can be just as confusing. Here&#x27;s what Augur mods are in Warframe.


What do Augur mods do in Warframe?


Augur mods are mods exclusively acquired from Plains of Eidolon bounties on a random chance. These mods are rather weak on the surface, with the max rank of something like Augur Secrets only providing 24% Ability Strength. 


However, they come into play when you have multiple Augur mods on the same piece of equipment. Each Augur mod on a frame will cause 40% of Energy spent on abilities to convert into Shields. This maxes out at six mods, with 240% Energy being converted to Shields. You can stack this with the mod Brief Respite to hit a maximum of 390% Energy converted to Shields if you want a gigantic shield for one reason or another.


All Augur mods and their effects (at max rank) are as follows:



Augur Pact - 90% Damage


Augur Message - 24% Ability Duration


Augur Reach - 30% Ability Range


Augur Accord - 70% Shield Capacity


Augur Seeker - 90% Status Duration


Augur Secrets - 24% Ability Strength



Are the Augur mods worth using?


With all that said, there are only a few cases where multiple Augur mods can make sense. The increased Shields are nice, but you lose a lot of power by having the mods in the first place. The main reason to take Augur mods is to further a particular stat you&#x27;re going for. While not in my current build, Augur Secrets was quite useful on Wisp for me, due to adding that little bonus to Wisp&#x27;s motes.

While Escape From Tarkov players have turned against the devs after locking PvE behind a new $250 edition, it&#x27;s opened the door for Gray Zone Warfare to take a stranglehold on the immersive tactical FPS fan base. The new title challenges players to explore an island in Southeast Asia and bring back anything worthwhile, fighting against AI-controlled enemies and other users. 


The devs have yet to confirm an official release date for Gray Zone Warfare, but we finally know what each edition has to offer.

The Charger can be described as a Terminid skill check, mowing down novice divers. Here&#x27;s how to kill a Charger in Helldivers 2, the fast and Democratic way.


The best way to kill a Charger in Helldivers 2 is to aim for its weak points: its legs and head. You may be now asking, &quot;But what about its big, fleshy butt?&quot; Well, that&#x27;s also an option and an obvious one. For many facing the Charger for the first time, dodging and blasting is a good strat. But it&#x27;s surprisingly not the quickest way to put the beast to bed.

                              <span>There are many useful crafting components to farm in Granblue Fantasy: Relink, with the Vitality Hoof being one of them. However, it can be a bit tricking knowing exactly how to get the valuable hoof. This is how to get the Vitality hoof in Granblue Fantasy: Relink and the best way to farm it.





How to get the Vitality Hoof


In order to get the Granblue Fantasy: Relink Vitality Hoof, you need to farm the mission titled The Saga Continues: Wind at Halewind Altar. The encounter will have you fight the Maniac version of Furycane which is the boss that actually drops the Vitality Hoof. You can continuously farm this mission once you unlock it later in the game.


To unlock the Mania Furycane encounter, you need to complete the Maniac missions available to you, which will eventually unlock the Maniac form of Furycane in The Saga Continues: Wind mission.


It&#x27;s important to note that once you start leveling up your weapons to higher levels or are looking to Awaken your Ascension weapon, you will need to farm Vitality Hoof and other crafting materials specifically from Maniac versions of bosses.


Vitality Hoof is not dropping


If the Vitality Hoof is not dropping for you in Granblue Fantasy: Relink, chances are you are fighting the Extreme version of Furycane, not the Maniac version. This does not drop the Vitality Hoof; only Maniac version does. Make sure you are actually on the Maniac version of The Saga Continues: Wind.


The actual drop rate on the Vitality Hoof from Maniac Furycane is 40%, so it&#x27;s not a guaranteed drop. Still, the drop rate is not too bad, and you should be getting one every 2-4 attempts.


Once you&#x27;ve unlocked Mania Furycane, you can also purchase a Vitality Hoof from Siero for 5 Gold Badges. However, this is incredibly inefficient compared to just farming the Vitality Hoof from Maniac Furycane kills.

How to see soil fertility in Manor Lords


Seeing soil fertility is easy but a bit unintuitive in Manor Lords at the time of writing. You may have glimpsed it while building, but getting back to it might be a little out of memory.


To see your soil fertility, click on the construction tab on your quick bar. Without clicking any further, you can see a list of data views on the right-hand side of the screen. These include your soil’s suitability for …</span>

Countries such as Argentina and China are listed as priority threats, while Vietnam is labeled a leading source of online piracy. The USTR urges the Asian country to tackle the problem and take criminal prosecutions seriously.

In the heyday of the tennis-sim video game genre, Top Spin and Virtua Tennis were the best players in the crowded space. However, in the time since the genre’s boom settled, the offerings have fallen off considerably, with both franchises going more than a decade without a new release. TopSpin 2K25 signals the reemergence of the critically acclaimed series, and though it’s been a while since it stepped on the court, it’s evident the franchise hasn’t lost its stroke.

                              <span>Blizzard has decided to cancel this year’s BlizzCon. The company states the event will return in the future, but it plans to showcase upcoming games in a different manner over the coming months. 
First announced in a blog post, Blizzard plans to share details on upcoming games like World of Warcraft: The War Within and Diablo IV’s Vessel of Hatred expansion at other trade shows, such as Gamescom. The company also plans to launch “multiple, global, in-person events” for Warcraft’s 30th anniversary, which are described as being “distinct” from BlizzCon. 
“Our hope is that these experiences – alongside several live-streamed industry events where we’ll keep you up to date with what’s happening in our game universes – will capture the essence of what makes the Blizzard community so special,” Blizzard states in the blog post.
A Blizzard representative tells Windows Central that Blizzard made the call to cancel BlizzCon and not Microsoft, which completed its acquisition of the company last year. In a statement to the outlet, the representative says, “This is a Blizzard decision. We have explored different event formats in the past, and this isn&#x27;t the first time we&#x27;re skipping BlizzCon or trying something new. While we have great things to share in 2024, the timing just doesn’t line up for one single event at the end of the year.”
BlizzCon began in 2005 as an annual convention celebrating all things Blizzard. Last year&#x27;s show saw the reveal of World of Warcraft’s next expansion, The War Within, as well as two other expansions coming after it. It&#x27;s good that event is only taking a year off as opposed to being canned for good, and we&#x27;re curious to see how the alternative events shape up over the coming months.</span>

You can read our full review for more details about how it turned out, or read our interview with the game&#x27;s creative director to learn more about how the game came together.

That’s the bad news. The good news is you’ve got a month’s notice - and it’s on sale for the next week or so.

That’s how I feel about getting to tell you about Oyster Wars, a platforming game that melds the fluid movement of Celeste with the puzzle dungeons and hookshot traversal of Zelda.

A helicopter will soon join the fray. Many things will soon explode, and you will take a short break from the minigunning to calmly physics some boxes into a set of steps with a crane. This FPS is not so much writing a love letter to a bygone era of noughties shooters, as it is standing underneath the window of its respected elders earnestly serenading them with a busted old keytar from the attic. There are bum notes and the singing voice is not exactly boy-band beautiful, but the love is unmistakably there. And, hey, singing is hard.

                              <span>Although Corsair isn&#x27;t included in our current best gaming SSDs guide, their compact form factor SSDs, including the MP600 Mini, are probably some of the best M.2 2230 SSDs on the market to pair with your Steam Deck gaming console.
The 1TB Corsair MP600 Mini SSD has already seen quite a few discounts since its release in late 2023, including during this year&#x27;s Amazon Spring Sale. In the UK, Amazon has once again shaved some money off, knocking its price down to just £69.98. That&#x27;s a saving of £28.54.
It&#x27;s also on sale in the US, but not for its cheapest price. If you urgently wanted to grab one though, you can do so for a still fairly reasonable price of $84.99  from Amazon&#x27;s US storefront (was $114.99). But just know it has reached low prices of $70 in the past so it may be worth waiting for a big sale like Amazon Prime Day to get it for even cheaper.

                              <span>While playing Manor Lords for review, I kept making mental notes to spend time watching the individual routes its villagers and beasts take each day. It’s one of those interestingly granular games that actually becomes more so by remaining a bit mysterious in ways I’m sure will annoy some, so I reasoned some people-watching would be illuminating. And by people, I mean oxen.

That game was Aikode, the work of Spanish solo developer Ace.

I’m starting to fear, actually, that this one icon of a behatted japester may have been widely adopted as an oddly hostile way to single out dissenting opinions, rapidly accelerating the Steam reviews’ grisly metamorphosis into something that more resembles a clout-farming social app than anything with pretensions towards facilitating helpfulness or self expression.

                              <span>Lethal Company is a fun game but I know what you&#x27;re thinking: it lacks feline energy. Whilst the simplistic game loop of collecting scrap on monster-infested moons and selling it to an equally monstrous company is enjoyable at first, it can get old pretty fast. As both Alice and James have attested with their experiences of this month&#x27;s RPS Game Club pick, Lethal Company is a game that lacks a certain direction the more you play. I soon found myself settling into an existential crisis, reminiscent of my tumultuous stint in retail. A recurring thought back then was why bother stacking shelves, only to have someone buy the products and make me re-stack them again?
In the vain hopes of gaining a higher purpose in Lethal Company, I stumbled across the &#x27;Needy Cats&#x27; mod. Essentially this mod adds a variety of cats to your game that will wander around the facilities and yelp for attention.
Perhaps I&#x27;m just a glutton for heartbreak, but I decided that the game needed a galactic sanctuary full of adorable balls of floof. I hearkened back to my time playing Stray, the adorable cat adventure set in a post-apocalypse where humanity was all but wiped out. Could this be the prequel to Lethal Company? What if all Apocalypse games share the same universe, all orchestrated by The Company secretly pulling the strings of fate? Or maybe I just wanted to look at cute cats instead of terrifying mannequin monsters. Either way, the cats needed help. What follows is a diary log of my adventures which soon lead to increasing madness and ultimately, disaster.

Whilst some of us have enjoyed the nonsensical hijinks Lethal Company can offer, others have been less enthused with the progression system and prefer the shiny newbie experience. 
We&#x27;ve had some good chat on the matter. Although, I&#x27;ve mostly been preoccupied by the various hardworking monsters in the game. Now, it&#x27;s your turn to hit us with your questions (or your shovels). Let&#x27;s chat about all things Lethal Company, today (April 26th) at 4pm BST.

                              <span>Great was the consternation of singleplayer horror likers at the popularity of Lethal Company, a landmark creepfest and satire of corporate piecework that is best enjoyed in groups of four. When will developer Zeekerss give us a proper singleplayer campaign mode, the loners of the gaming community wondered, peering from their boltholes and eyries. A Lethal Sole Trader, as it were - or failing that, how about some bot support? Well, this particular monkeypaw finger has curled. It curled about four years ago, actually, when Zeekerss released singleplayer-only horror compilation It Steals. 


I&#x27;ve been playing It Steals (available on Itch and Steam for £4 or $5) as part of our latest Lethal Company-dedicated Game Club, and let me tell you, it makes Lethal Company look positively, er, Nonlethal. There are many points of comparison between games, but while Lethal Company is geared more obviously for laughs, with its whoopie cushions and ReactionTube-friendly co-op mechanics, It Creeps just wants to scare you shitless. It&#x27;s also brilliant.

                              <span>James made the observation that Lethal Company, a co-op game about being haunted space binmen, and this month&#x27;s pick for the RPS Game Club, gets less fun the better you are at it. This is true! It&#x27;s also janky, and the RNG on the weird, warren-like buildings prompted me to ask &quot;Who designed this? What is this for? What kind of office is this??&quot; out loud, as I faced yet another dead end full of pipes. And yet! There&#x27;s something about it that endears me to it far more than other similar games like Phasmophobia. Games like this all largely rely on you making your own fun with the tools they provide, but I think we should give the Lethal Company devs props for their tools, because they are weird and make no sense, and allow for some fantastic slapstick.

                              <span>Mayors in RPG games are rarely given the spotlight. They&#x27;re mostly just there to give you an early quest involving goat banditry or windmill rats or some such other domestic drudgery. Or, in the case of Tristram’s mayor in Diablo, to fret behind the scenes about how to properly fit considerable cathedral repairs into this month’s budget. Well, no more must this valuable civil servant hide behind balance sheets, occasionally popping out to cut a big ribbon in celebration of a nearby mausoleum being turned into a Wetherspoons. Tristam is a 72 hour Ludum Dare project where you play as said town’s mayor. And this time: It’s ceremonial!

In the game&#x27;s latest update, Valve have added the ability to swap from the default right-handed viewmodel to a left-handed one. There&#x27;s also an update to the buy menu, making it easier to track your bank account and grab weapons your mates have dropped. Alongside further UI improvements for grenade line-ups, and a tweak to the Active Duty map pool.

Well, the wholesome city-builder now lets you feed villagers to the creature and start a cult in the great devourer&#x27;s name. Okay. Why not?

                              <span>Escape From Tarkov, the extraction FPS from developer Battlestate, recently put up a new Unheard edition of the game for pre-order, and tarkov escapers aren&#x27;t happy about it. The price for this bundle - which includes a new mode, a bigger stash, and assorted gubbins - comes in at $250, or around two actual hundred actual pounds, but the price alone isn’t necessarily what’s got a section of the player base so tarked-off that a few of them are even loudly considering a lawsuit. 

The actual issue is twofold: the edition is being called pay-to-win, and is also the only way to access said new PvE co-op mode, despite players previously shelling out notable nuggets for what was pitched as access to &quot;all subsequent DLCs&quot; as part of the now-delisted Edge of Darkness edition.

                              <span>Zau do you do?
The best thing we can say about Tales of Kenzera: ZAU is that it’s a decent gateway game into the Metroidvania genre. The Switch is so chock full of incredible titles at this point that it can often be difficult to know where to start (we can help with that too, by the way), but Kenzera provides a relatively breezy 6-7-hour experience that should give you an indication as to whether or not to dip your toes in a bit further. For genre veterans, however, while the gameplay is certainly good enough to see you through to the end, there’s little here that hasn’t already been done elsewhere… and better, too.
What elevates the game, however, is its setting and story. If you’ve been following Tales of Kenzera&#x27;s development at all, you’ll know that a great deal of the plot takes inspiration from Sugent Studio’s creative lead, Abubakar Salim, and his personal experience dealing with parental loss. Incidentally, Salim (a stage and screen actor and the voice of Bayek in Assassin&#x27;s Creed Origins) also provides the voice for protagonist Zau, and we have to commend the voiceover work as a whole; it’s brilliantly done throughout and helps the plot resonate a lot more than if we were merely reading lines of dialogue.

                              <span>Hint: it&#x27;s teeny tiny.
If you&#x27;ve ever wondered what was actually inside a Nintendo Switch cart, then wonder no more, dear reader. Over on YouTube, Tinker Man Mick has uploaded a Short (okay, it was uploaded in July 2023, so we&#x27;re a bit late, but who cares) to demonstrate that some Switch carts actually have quite a bit of empty space.
Cracking open a copy of Let&#x27;s Sing 2021, you can see that the board within does indeed fill the entire casing, while a copy of Super Mario Odyssey actually has quite a bit of unused space. Now, the video is titled &#x27;Why Does Nintendo Do This?&#x27;, but we think it&#x27;s fairly obvious. Switch carts are pretty small to begin with, so making it even smaller would no doubt make it more difficult to handle while leaving much less space for publishers to attach their printed game labels.

                              <span>Current Pro Controller may be compatible.
According to a new report from Spanish outlet Vandal (thanks, VGC), the upcoming Switch successor - affectionately dubbed the &#x27;Switch 2&#x27; - will ditch the rail system for the current Joy-Con controllers and replace it with a magnetic set up.
As such, whether the current Joy-Con controllers will actually work with the new system is unknown, as it&#x27;s reported that the new console will be bigger than the current models, but it&#x27;s also claimed that the Switch Pro Controller will work just fine.

It feels like only yesterday that we first locked eyes on Tales of Kenzera: ZAU at last year&#x27;s Game Awards show, but now this original Metroidvania is finally here!
While we at Nintendo Life will have our full written review with you soon, our video team has been good enough to first capture some gameplay footage so that you can see how all of the action plays out on Switch.

Hot off the back of the first collection, LEGO has today announced that it will be expanding its range of Animal Crossing sets with at least two new builds heading our way on 1st August.
Revealed in a rather adorable video of a K.K. Slider minifigure blasting his tunes (the vid very kindly points out the minifig &quot;does not actually sing or move&quot;), we get our first peek at a duo of sets which appear to be modelled on the New Horizons Town Hall and Dodo Airlines dock respectively.

El Shaddai is an artistic endeavour in the same vein as Rez or Thatgamecompany’s Journey, taking action genre norms and weaving them into an avant-garde, visual tour de force. Anyone familiar with the ill-fated Clover Studio, a Capcom subsidiary that started out in 2004 developing for the GameCube, will likely have encountered the work of Sawaki Takeyasu; a body including Devil May Cry, Okami, and Gravity Rush 2. In 2006, Shinji Mikami and Hideki Kamiya left Clover to establish Seeds Inc., which would become PlatinumGames through a merger the following year, while Takeyasu formed the freelance studio, Crim.
El Shaddai: Ascension of the Metatron’s origins actually lie with the then head of UTV Ignition Games, Vijay Chadha. Although Ignition was a publisher based out of Hammersmith, London, Chadha was a fan of Takeyasu’s work, and, aware of his departure from Clover, pitched him an idea for an action game based on the apocryphal Book of Enoch, featuring parables on fallen angels displaced from heaven and the &#x27;Thousand Year Reign of the Messiah&#x27;. It’s heavy stuff, and beautifully imagined as video game material by Takeyasu’s team.

The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is no stranger to a tasty bit of merchandise (just check out that new Uniqlo range, for crying out loud) and it looks like a whole lot more is now available. The catch? It&#x27;s only available in Japan.
Yes, a fresh batch of Hyrule-inspired goodies is fresh out of the oven on the Japanese My Nintendo Store and wow do they smell good! Highlights of this new range include a Zonai patterned shirt, a Wing device rug, Sacred Stone pins, a Bomb Flower drawstring purse, Zelda&#x27;s earrings and much more. We&#x27;d be lying if we said that we weren&#x27;t in love with quite a lot of what we&#x27;re seeing here.

                              <span>This week saw the first (small) look at the new and upcoming Hobbit-themed cosy life sim Tales Of The Shire, plus the news that Embracer group is splitting into three, including a Middle-earth And Friends group. We thus use this as an excuse to spend some time talking about The Lord Of The Rings games we&#x27;d like to see, plus our favourite Rings games from days gone by (and also Gollum, and also we do impressions of Gollum).
Nate has been playing an impressive number of games, including one that did not allow him to invent the stick and therefore hampered his progress. We also talk about AI NPCs again, because one of them tried to get James drunk. Plus: some lovely recommendations to round off your weekly pod (one of them is a long life meat product).

                              <span>The announcement trailer for Lost Legions opens with a Roman Emperor bellowing “GIVE ME BACK MY LEGIONS” like a kid who’s just had his pudding taken away. I&#x27;d just had a big swig of coffee before watching, and was instantly swept off by visions of an apoplectic Roman bigwig rampaging through the forests of darkest Germania, gluing abducted legionnaires together into a sort of Octavian katamari... and then they revealed that it’s another open world survival game, with no less than two trailer beats dedicated to the act of hacking down a tree. 


I mean no disrespect to developers Tarock Interactive - they&#x27;re not to blame for my addled imagination - but there are many open world survival games and as a weary Ed Thorn recently noted, the majority are heavily frontloaded with wilderness carpentry. I don’t think survival games should emphasise wood-chopping in their announcement footage. It&#x27;s like doing a Call of Duty montage of people getting shot three seconds from spawn. Still, if there&#x27;s no katamari mechanic, the idea of raising a small army of mostly AI-controlled Roman soldiers behind enemy lines has a certain charm. Without further ado, here’s the trailer.

                              <span>I think the stronger your interest in white goods becomes, that&#x27;s how you know you&#x27;re transitioning from a youngster to a slightly oldster. The first thing I did recently when I stepped into my friend&#x27;s house was compliment him on his new washing machine. &quot;A Samsung! Nice dials on this, eh?&quot;, I said as I twisted the dial and it pleasantly bumped from mixed to delicate wash. What can I say? I appreciate the mundane and the useful.
And from the times I&#x27;ve played Lethal Company, I&#x27;ve come to think it&#x27;s also a game about appreciating the mundane, too.

                              <span>Pine: A Story Of Loss, which stars a bereaved woodworker and thus may be a play on the double meaning of ‘pine’, is a gorgeously animated interactive fiction game that sees you performing farming chores and wordlessly reminiscing upon cherished memories. It’s short - designed to be played in a couple of sittings - and while the fiction is the focus here, you’ll spend time gardening and whittling in bespoke minigames as you find out more about the woodworker’s relationship. The publisher describes it thusly:

By now, I can confidently say that the RPS team are scrap collecting experts and can easily meet the quota set by the enigmatic Company. Much to James&#x27; chagrin, who prefers the chaos of being objectively &#x27;bad&#x27; at the game. So confident was I in our abilities after our co-op sesh, that I dove into a solo game. Cue immediate death by a vengeful face-hugging bug. I&#x27;m expecting my first round of xenomorph child maintenance fees any day now.
With our blog chat scheduled for Friday 26th April, 4 PM GMT, here are a few conversation prompts we&#x27;ve gathered ahead of time. Tell us your thoughts in the comments and shoot any questions our way too. We hope to see you there!

                              <span>Fallout 4&#x27;s &quot;next generation&quot; update goes live today. Timed to capitalise on the Fallout TV show&#x27;s mad popularity, it&#x27;ll encumber the 2015-released open world wasteland RPG with widescreen and ultra-widescreen support, Creation Kit fixes, and a &quot;variety of quest updates&quot; across Steam, Microsoft Store and GOG. There will be new items for the Creation Club, including the Makeshift Weapon Pack, which lets you blast people with a piggy bank like Elon Musk, and a new quest, Echoes Of The Past, in which you try to &quot;stop The Enclave from spreading their dangerous ideology and gaining a foothold in the Commonwealth&quot;.
They&#x27;re also bringing the game to the Epic Games Store and upgrading it to Steam Deck Verified status. Such days of bounty we do live through, but beware - it&#x27;s possible the update will break existing Fallout 4 mods, which will be a problem for the very large numbers of you who&#x27;ve been downloading mods after watching the show. Indeed, the possibility of today&#x27;s update messing with mods has already seen the creators of the promising Fallout: London delay release to assess the damage. If you&#x27;re similarly concerned, you might want to disable auto-updates right now.

                              <span>Most of my time in Lethal Company is full of tomfoolery, panicking, and ultimately letting the quota down. As I run back and forth from the ship, only able to carry four things at a time in my puny arms, I frequently see the various monster inhabitants of the game excelling at pretty much everything. The Forest Keeper has brawny strength and can travel across the map in a blink of an eye, the Eyeless Dogs can sniff out an intruder in next to no time and The Butler has dedicated his life to maintaining a mansion even after the owners have long since gone.
This had me thinking - surely the various monster inhabitants of Lethal Company would make for a much better worker than myself?
Sure, most of them are ravenous killing machines - but that fits with the core values of The Company. After all, most of your time spent in the game will be collecting scrap on distant moons to meet an arbitrary quota set by The Company. You&#x27;ll then feed your pilfered belongings to the insatiable maw of a tentacled horror (otherwise known as the boss). You may be able to sympathise depending on your occupation.
So, if the monsters in Lethal Company were given the chance to work for said company, which of them would make it as an employee of the month and which would crash and burn harder than me getting thrown from the airlock five times in a row?
Join me as I peruse the CV&#x27;s of my favourite monsters in Lethal Company (as far as I know only half of them have opposable thumbs) and advocate for which of them should be my replacement as The Company&#x27;s new hire. After all, once this month&#x27;s Games Club is finished I&#x27;m not sure they&#x27;ll even let me back on the ship.

                              <span>The closest I have come to having any interest in sport is when I got really into reading about football hooligans, or like, Blood Bowl, but I do absolutely recognise the romance of it all. SUDDEN DEATH is a delicious free slice of playable art-pie that celebrates that romance. It is - says dev Cécile, who co-made the project with Nat Pussy and MOTHER GOOSE for collective Domino Club - “a game about love and sports. it&#x27;s gay, it&#x27;s very australian, and it&#x27;s great.” You can tell it’s Australian quickly, because people call chips ‘chippies’, which makes me chuffed.

                              <span>Alien-infested submarine sim Barotrauma has received a chunky update, bringing two new-ish monsters into its lethal aquatic world. The shrimp-looking Mantis may be recognisable to veterans (it once appeared in pre-Steam builds). And the Viperling is a venomous variant of the existing Spineling (a thorny seaworm with hull-piercing porcupine-like spikes). But don&#x27;t worry, the medical systems have also seen a &quot;mini-rework&quot;, which means drugs like morphine are &quot;less of a &#x27;solution for everything&#x27;&quot;. Wait. What?


Submariners in the game can still use morphine, opium and fentanyl to ease the pain of a monster attack, broken bones, wrecked organs, or be-bulleted body. However, the developers feel these drugs have been over-used. So they&#x27;ve rebalanced the opiates as part of their Blood in the Water update. Now the drugs have &quot;a much higher risk of causing addiction and overdoses, and morphine heals much more slowly, making it less viable for combat-heavy situations.&quot; Well. Guess I&#x27;ll just die.

Yesterday creative director Stéphane Boudon and art director Jeal-Luc Sala took to Reddit for an AMA, and in response to a question about plans for Mirage DLC, Boudon said no - but that they have ideas for more stories for Basim.

                              <span>My experience with actual flight simulators typically amounts to approaching the runway far, far too quickly at far, far too perpendicular an angle, so perhaps I’m better off just flying folded-up bits of A4. Happily, that’s exactly what Paper Sky, a &quot;semi-open world paper plane adventure&quot; from solo indie dev Brute Force, is offering.

                              <span>I can feel some kind of sore throat bug coming on. It must be the baleful influence of Creative Assembly&#x27;s latest free update for bellowing strategy bonanza Total War: Warhammer 3. Out 30th April, the update introduces Epidemius, Proctor of Pestilence - a new Nurgle Legendary Lord who gains rewards based on how many ickle diseases you’ve spread to other factions (already my favourite aspect of playing Nurgle in the game). Does Epidemius also get buffs if the player is infected by something? I hope so. It would be a consolation to know that my ailing trachea is contributing to the Nurgle cause.


That’s not the only new addition in TWW3 patch 5. They’re also bringing a Gold Wizard hero, who is sort of Magneto but blingier, and a cursed crown that will make everybody hate you. Let’s dig in.

In Star Wars Outlaws, protagonists Kay Vess and Nix must navigate the criminal underworld by interacting with the various crime syndicates thriving in this period between the events of The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. Kay&#x27;s standing with these syndicates is primarily represented by the Reputation System, an ambitious mechanic that tracks her relationship with these criminal organizations. In the recently released story trailer, we hear the names of three of the syndicates present in Star Wars Outlaws: the Hutt Cartel, the Pyke Syndicate, and Crimson Dawn. During our tr…</span>

                              <span>The Fallout franchise is in the midst of a resurgence lately, thanks to the live-action series adaptation on Amazon Prime (which is good, by the way). Even though it&#x27;s been almost a decade since its release, Fallout 4 has rocketed to the top of sales charts like a mushroom cloud into the atmosphere, which makes today&#x27;s update perfectly timed: Fallout 4 is finally getting a proper next-gen update.

                              <span>Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 launched a little over a month ago and has already managed to sell 2.5 million copies, but Capcom is still releasing updates to patch minor issues with the game. While a large volume of complaints have been about the lack of a performance mode, this update (like the last update) does not address that issue. However, it does aim to clean up a number of irritating errors involving the behavior of pawns, the player&#x27;s AI companions.
An update for Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 is now live on all platforms!

April 25, 2024
For starters, this update makes it easier to detect dragonsplague, an affliction that, if untreated, can lead to devastating consequences for your pawns and your world. It&#x27;s also contagious, so it&#x27;s a good idea to nip it in the bud as soon as you first encounter it. When afflicted, pawns&#x27; eyes will glow red – after this update, they&#x27;ll glow more noticeably. The update also causes the disease to infect pawns less frequently.
Pawns should also be a lot less annoying now, thanks to a whole slate of minor refinements to their behavior. They&#x27;ll jump off cliffs less often (which is hilarious but a wild inconvenience), say some lines less often, say other lines at more appropriate times and become less likely to offer to be hired while passing by on the street. They&#x27;re one of the highlights of the game, so anything done to make their constant presence more consistent is always welcome.
There are also smaller adjustments, like adding the ability to zoom in on a character&#x27;s face in shops, preventing monster attacks in town from leading to the player&#x27;s arrest, and other miscellaneous bug fixes. You can read the full list of updates, as well as all past updates, here.</span>

As we learned with Deathbound&#x27;s reveal last year, the game wears its Soulslike inspiration on its sleeve. However, it aims to differentiate itself within the ever-growing genre with what Trialforge calls a single-player party-based system. Players will control a single vessel that channels various heroes known as the fallen. These are individual characters, each with unique skill sets, combat styles, and lore, that share the player-controlled vessel. As such, players ca…</span>

Bandai Namco has today revealed that the anime and manga series That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime will be heading to Switch as a side-scrolling RPG on 8th August.
The catchily titled That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime ISEKAI Chronicles will mark the first game adaptation of the series and it promises to hit many of the same story beats as its source material including Rimuru Tempest and co.&#x27;s encounters with the Kijin, battles against Falmuth and many more. But that&#x27;s not to say that this will all be familiar territory for fans of the series, as the game will also contain new storylines and characters from the OG author Fuse.

                              <span>How are things stacking up?
We are still a little way off the release of Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door on Switch on 23rd May, but today we have had our first indication of how things are stacking up as the game&#x27;s previews have begun to appear online.
Here at Nintendo Life, our experience with the game so far has been joyous. From what we have played, The Thousand-Year Door brings all of the wit and charm of the GameCube original and throws in some handy tweaks to iron out any of its small problems:

                              <span>My library&#x27;s in ruins.
Library of Ruina is less than the sum of its parts. While this visual novel&#x27;s dialog sets up a well-established, deep world with interesting characters, its talky repetitiveness eschews plenty of opportunities to make the most of what it&#x27;s trying to set up. And even with a compelling, card-based battle system that rewards clever play and a measured approach, both story and gameplay move too slowly to lend a tangible sense of progress thanks to poorly optimized menus, which ensure that any momentum falls through the cracks. We can see its charm for fans of a very specific type of visual novel, but coming in as fans of the snappy, tactical, and luck-driven satisfaction of other deckbuilders, this didn&#x27;t scratch the itch we&#x27;d hoped it would.
You play as Roland, a street thug in Library of Ruina&#x27;s cyberpunk dystopia who&#x27;s been magically teleported to a mysterious library. Library of Ruina follows Roland and his custodian Angela as they attempt to build out the library and uncover its secrets. In order to fill the library&#x27;s seemingly infinite credenza, Roland must defeat and kill other humans in battle to gain possession of their books which in turn earns him new cards to experiment with.

The proposal boils down to a &#x27;Know Your Customer&#x27; regime for companies operating cloud services, with the goal of countering the activities of &quot;foreign malicious actors.&quot; Yet, despite an overseas focus, Americans won&#x27;t be able to avoid the proposal&#x27;s requirements, which covers CDNs, virtual private servers, proxies, and domain name resolution services, among others.

A new demo shows that generative AI models make it possible to search for content in novel ways, without restriction. The ultimate goal of the research project is to shift the Internet&#x27;s power balance from governments and large corporations back to consumers.

                              <span>One of the leading-edge benefits of Fedora Linux is that it always ships with the most up-to-date open-source compiler toolchains at release. For their spring releases each year, it typically means shipping with a GCC compiler that isn&#x27;t even officially released as stable yet. With this week&#x27;s release of Fedora 40, it&#x27;s shipping with GCC 14.0.1 as the development version that will culminate with the inaugural GCC 14 stable release in the coming weeks. Plus Fedora 40 has all of the other latest GNU toolchain components and then over on the LLVM side is with the current LLVM 18 stable series. For those curious how GCC 14 vs. LLVM Clang 18 performance is looking, here is a wide range of C/C++ benchmarks carried out on Fedora Workstation 40 using a System76 Thelio Major workstation powered by the Zen 4 AMD Ryzen Threadripper 7980X.</span>

                              <span>In a joint press release on Monday, the Premier League and Alliance for Creativity and Entertainment revealed the first-ever online piracy conviction in Vietnam. The news came as a surprise, as did comment published in local media attributed to a government official. It may seem like a small step, but admitting that Vietnam has a manga piracy problem, one that causes &quot;hundreds of millions of dollars in damage to copyright owners,&quot; is a big step forward.

                              <span>A new survey confirms that the high cost of online streaming services keeps piracy relevant. The findings suggest that one in three Americans have pirated a movie or TV series over the past year. Costs are a key motivator for these self-proclaimed pirates, with the number of legal subscription services and their price tags a key trigger.

                              <span>As a somewhat deflating example of the money-churning might of GTA Online becoming the sole focus of Rockstar’s Grand Theft Auto 5 efforts over the last decade, the actor who played Trevor in the ridiculously well-selling crime epic has teased some details of planned story DLC that would have turned the controversial protagonist into a James Bond-style spy. The pack supposedly got as far as shooting with the actors, only to end up cancelled and folded into a GTA Online heist.

                              <span>Dark Souls, one of the most widely acclaimed video games of the last two decades - perhaps all time - and progenitor of one of modern video gaming’s most influential and oft-copied-rarely-bettered genres, the Soulslike, would’ve been a better game had it launched into early access. That’s the suggestion from the head of Ori and the Blind Forest developers Moon Studios in the wake of launching their own early access Soulslike, No Rest For The Wicked.

This time: Hall effect keyboards, a relatively fresh flavour of desktop peripheral that’s been gaining traction with manufacturers for the switch design’s supposed durability and reliability benefits. These represent perhaps the first major challenge to mechanical keyboard hegemony, but you may be wondering: who’s Hall? What’s their effect? And does it actually make for a better gaming keyboard? Time to found out.

                              <span>Lots of Soulslikes have about as much joy, and the same colour palette, as a burning cowpat. They are grim and dark and often have gimmicks that are a bit middling: mechanical arms that spew gunk, or turning to stone. Or they stand out with incredibly deep combat, with dense menus and rainbow loot. So, Another Crab&#x27;s Treasure comes as a refreshing surprise, what with it&#x27;s crustacean theme, platforming, and shell gimmick that actually complements fights in clever ways. Not only that, but it&#x27;s colourful and funny, with plenty of challenge for veterans and plenty of difficulty tweaks for those who just want a good time. Trade cowpat for coral, I&#x27;d say.

                              <span>Sand Land is like a sanitised manga-ish Mad Max Fury Road, where there are fewer explosions and nobody huffs paint and screams &quot;Witness me!&quot;. So, arguably, a less cool Mad Max. In this incarnation it&#x27;s an open world action game with light RPG elements; in previous incarnations it is a manga and anime by the creator of Dragon Ball. My takeaway from playing Sand Land the game is that it is a tremendous advert for the manga and anime, in the sense that everything good about Sand Land the game is from those, and I would rather be reading or watching them instead.

                              <span>I went to see Civil War this weekend. I liked a bunch of it, didn&#x27;t like a bunch of it. One thing I thought was very obvious is that it sanitises its titular conflict of any political context. On the one hand, I understand this as part of the theming, said almost directly into the camera by Kirsten Dunst&#x27;s photojournalist character: as journalists they&#x27;re there to observe, so other people ask questions. On the other hand, the civil war being between the government and the Western Forces, an alliance between California and Texas feels extremely &quot;Republicans buy sneakers too&quot;, if you ask me.
It made me think about the Fallout TV show. One of the things I like about it is that it doesn&#x27;t pretend The Brotherhood Of Steel aren&#x27;t absolute mad lads (pejorative). Like, they&#x27;re clearly not good news, and there isn&#x27;t any attempt to make them seem like they are - just that they might seem that way from the point of view of a traumatised child being rescued from a fridge like a tiny Indiana Jones. Many of the video games I like pride themselves on offering choice to the player, but in reality they smooth over any bumps in the road to make the choices appear equal - rather than telling the player they are choosing between bad and good.

                              <span>When, in town building simulation Manor Lords, you erect your first manor, it feels natural to place it in the center of your humble 14th century European settlement. It presents as a locus of power, where your character avatar resides. Also, it’s right there in the title. I built mine down a side road, between oxen posts and granaries, for no real reason but free space. The more I play, the more it feels a fitting place. Not sidelined, exactly, just not especially loud. I need the taxes it brings to pay mercenaries to see off bandits, but lords - their whims and ambitions - don’t set the tone here. Parchment and seals aren’t as important as tilled earth; as winter snow, spring thaws and autumn harvests. So, despite the title, this sedate, curious, and intricate sim isn’t really about lords, nor manors. Not half as much, anyway, as it is about manure.

                              <span>Lords Of The Fallen, an action RPG that was a mixture of fun and infuriating when it first launched, has received its final free update. It introduces the &quot;Advanced Game Modifier System&quot;, which sounds like something creepy bachelors would pay an extraordinary monthly fee for. No, it doesn&#x27;t provide terrible advice on how to talk to women. Instead, it allows you to customise LOTF with modifiers to turn it into a roguelike.

As spotted by the Verge, this change is intended to combat a loophole where filthy time criminals could fill their stolen boots with ill-gotten fun pre-release, then get their money back.

We liked the game and were impressed by the depth of its action and world-building. Ahead of its release, but after spending some time with the game, we had a chance to reconnect with Shift Up CEO and Stellar Blade director Hyung-Tae Kim after speaking with him earlier this year. This time we spoke to him (through a translator) about inspirations for the game beyond Nier Automata (like the Bible and The Matrix), the approach to costumes and how they fit in the lore, and why having no minimaps in the game was a purposeful decision.


Game Informer: There are multiple endings?
Hyung-Tae Kim: There are multiple endings and actually, if you complete certain quests, there is a post-credits clip, as well.

Another Crab&#x27;s Treasure, as the name suggests, is a humorous and pun-filled world where the sea is your Soulslike oyster. A fork acts as your defacto sword, while various other remnants from above, like shot glasses, soda cans, and more, serve as your shield. With fork in hand and can on back, Kril, a shy but easygoing hermit crab, sets out into the aquatic kingdom to find his favorite shell, stolen from him by a loan shark tax collector. What follows is an adventure that excels at being an amusing and bright reprieve from the otherwise dark an…</span>

Sand Land is experiencing an oddly timed resurgence. Its creator, Akira Toriyama (Dragon Ball), recently passed away unexpectedly, effectively pointing a spotlight on his 24-year-old creation just as it was being adapted to film, anime, and video game. The video game has been my entry point into this world with characters, vehicles, and architecture that all resemble Dragon Ball beyond even just an art style, and I enjoyed the opportunity to live in a brand new Toriyama world and story. Other elements of the game, like its …</span>

After a long absence, the Super Monkey Ball series returned in 2019 and 2021 with remasters and remakes of previous games, but it&#x27;s been over a decade since fans received an all-new Super Monkey Ball title. That changes in June, as Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble is poised to deliver the continuation longtime players pine for. But with some recent mixed results, massive changes in game design best practices in the time since the series&#x27; heyday, and likely a whole lot of cobwebs to shake off for developer Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio, I was skeptical about the viability of a new Super Monkey Ball in 2024.…</span>

It&#x27;s now got a May 20th release date.

So, Reedpop&#x27;s EGX expo and MCM Comic Con are joining forces. They&#x27;ll both take place side-by-side in the ExCel London this year, on 25th-27th October.


EGX, of course, will feature a bunch of classic and upcoming games, while Comic Con is laser-targeted at our respected allies in the world of on-paper image-based storytelling with speech bubbles. EGX&#x27;s headline partner is TikTok this year, which makes this a perfect nexus of entertainment artforms. All we need is a puppetshow now and possibly a semaphore stand, and the ritual will be complete.

                              <span>I&#x27;m the kind of awful person who looks at the background actors in TV shows and wonders what life is like for e.g. the old woman who sells birdfeed in Trafalgar Square in Mary Poppins when said upper-middle class domestic isn&#x27;t singing about her. What fate the Warcraft grunt when he is too old to work work? It&#x27;s probably pretty bad, right? Now let me slop Innkeep down in front of you like a big bowl of rat stew. Developer Daniel Burke furnished me with a little playable slice, and boy, Innkeep is a grim old time. I mean that as a compliment.
In it you run a big pub with room for a lot of grizzled adventurers, in a dog-eat-dog dark fantasy RPG sort of a world - think a roadside pub in one of the early seasons of Game Of Thrones, before everyone hated it. You do a lot of plate-spinning drudgery like cooking, cleaning, and serving, but also eavesdropping, rumourmongering, and knowing when to slip in a ribald joke as a distraction while you size up a mercenary&#x27;s sword.

                              <span>Afternoon, conveyor belt fans! Good news, I think I may have discovered the first genuinely cosy automation game. Attempts have been made at cosy automation and automated cosiness in the past – Satisfactory is on the sunnier side, providing you enable the right settings, and Shapez 2 has lots of rounded edges. But IDK, there’s something about the ravages of mass industry that doesn’t quite gel with zoomorphic raccoon baristas and other such wholesome trappings. Have you ever encountered a cuddly smokestack? How about a cuddly just-in-time network?
Combine cosiness with automation, and a lot of the time, you end up with some kind of macabre joke, like Palworld. Or at least so I thought before I discovered Sweet Transit, out now, which seemingly resolves everything by means of a hearty injection of trains.

                              <span>Sometimes, I hear critics describe something as ‘actively hostile’ to the act of playing it, but with something close to admiration in their voices. I&#x27;ve always felt that I, too, would like to one day find an artwork that I could describe in the same way. Partly because it sounds like an interesting experience, but mainly so I could steal that line and feel like one of those elite, urbanely perceptive, multiple trouser-owning critics.
Well, today is not that day, because indie horror IRIS isn&#x27;t, in fact, actively hostile towards the act of playing it. It&#x27;s more a case of passive disdain. Is it a ‘good’ game? Probably not. Ah, but is it enjoyable? Buddy, not even slightly. But it is intriguing. I am intrigued, reader.

But I have been given strict editorial directions not to kill any more small creatures for gambling purposes. So let us instead use the semi-public &quot;technical test&quot; as a portentous looking glass from which to discern whether this hell-hopping sequel seems promising. Fine by me, the approach is no less stabby.

I’m more efficient at clearing up scrap, less prone to fear-spasming inside out when a monster attacks, and have become wise to most of the haunted houses’ deadliest tricks. All of these, it turns out, make Lethal Company a worse game.

                              <span>Last week, a government hearing took place between representatives of the Video Game History Foundation, the Rhizome project, and the Software Preservation Network among others, with legal representation for the Entertainment Software Association (ESA) and the AACS among those in opposition. The hearing was a follow-up to the SPN petitioning the US copyright office, last year, for a DMCA exemption that would allow researchers to access games in libraries and archives. As reported by Game Developer, ESA legal representative Steve Englund said in the hearing that, currently, there’s “[no] combination of limitations [ESA members] would support to provide remote access.&quot;

                              <span>As one of the Treehouse&#x27;s resident Atlus sickos, I was incredibly happy to wake up to 25-minutes of Metaphor: ReFantazio&#x27;s director Katsura Hashino talking us through some new footage. We get a look at a new rural town and the activities you can get up to, like bounty hunting. Travel on your magic mech is compared to &quot;camping&quot;, which I wasn&#x27;t expecting. And there&#x27;s lots of combat on show, with transitions from real-time to turn-based battles outlined in a bit more detail. Oh and it&#x27;s coming out in October, which gives me plenty of time to clear my JRPG backlog before this inevitably takes over my entire existence for the foreseeable.

                              <span>What’s it like to watch a smash hit TV show set in the backyard of a game you’ve made? It’s a question which Fallout: New Vegas project director Josh Sawyer is uniquely qualified to answer.
“The show really does capture the aesthetic of Fallout 4 and 76, while also feeling like it is set on the West Coast,” he says. “If you’re a fan, then you can see where the plot elements have been pulled from in previous entries. And if you’re new to it, thankfully, those plot elements are fairly straightforward. So I think it’s a good show for fans and a good show if you’re new to it, even though there’s a lot of stuff going on. I’m certainly interested to see where they’re going in the second season.”

                              <span>I often regret that I didn&#x27;t get into football as a kid (note for people across the pond: football is what we call soccer in these here accursed, eternally post-imperial isles). The trouble was, all my friends liked football and I have an abiding hatred of popular things, a hatred that has obviously served me well during my later career as an online news journalist. I played hockey instead, which is the superior sport in that you get a big nasty stick, but also relatively niche because you need more equipment.
Still, I&#x27;ve enjoyed rediscovering football in videogames, and especially videogames that don&#x27;t treat football with much respect. You may have played or at least heard of Behold The Kickmen - now, here&#x27;s free downloadable Itch.io offering Cereballers to stick the boot in.

The June 2023 reveal of Star Wars Outlaws gave us our first glimpse of Kay Vess and Nix, the two protagonists of the game. From talking with Massive Entertainment during our recent trip out to Sweden to get our hands on Star Wars Outlaws, it sounds as though their bond will be special. However, they aren&#x27;t on this journey alone, as they are joined by a trenchcoat-wearing BX-commando droid named ND-5. Though Kay and Nix were greater points of emphasis during our studio visit, we had to ask the developers about the internet-popular droid that joins the Star Wars Outlaws adventure.

                              <span>Taming a wolf in Minecraft is one of the game&#x27;s simplest joys, and no matter how many times I start a new world, I always hoard bones in case I encounter one. But once you&#x27;ve adopted a canine companion, you probably hide them away in a house for safe-keeping, shielding them from the horrors of the game&#x27;s hostile mobs. Today, Minecraft is adding a way to make them a little stronger – wolf armor.


Like leather armor, wolf armor can be colored using dyes in-game, so if you&#x27;ve got multiple adopted animals, it&#x27;ll still be easy to tell them apart. This variation is separate from the collar colors as well, creating plenty of possibilities. Even better, the game is also adding wolf fur variants for the first time, bringing eight new patterns for a total of nine. Each variant (Pale, Woods, Ashen, Black, chestnut, Rusty, Spotted, Striped, and Snowy) spawns in a specific biome. You can take a look at all the new breeds in the gallery below.

Of course, players will need to be able to craft this wolf armor as well, which is where the new mob, the armadillo, comes in. These armored relatives of anteaters can be found in savannah or badland biomes, where they can be seen strolling around and curling into a defensive ball when certain enemies come near. Armadillos drop armadillo scutes, which are used to make the wolf armor, but the developers have reassured players that they can be brushed rather than defeated, so you won&#x27;t have to go on an armadillo massacre to protect your pets. Armadillos can also be used to scare away spiders since they eat insects and arachnids in real life, and spider eyes can be used to breed them if you want to make your own armadillo farm.

                              <span>Epic Games has revealed a new setting for Fortnite that allows players to hide emotes the company considers &quot;confrontational.&quot; This doesn&#x27;t outright ban these emotes from the game and those with them can still use them, but if someone has this new setting turned off, they won&#x27;t see others use them. 
Called &quot;See Confrontational Emotes,&quot; players can choose whether they want to see emotes like &quot;Laugh It Up,&quot; &quot;Take the L,&quot; &quot;Whipcrack,&quot; and &quot;Make It Plantain&quot; from anyone, from friends in a party, or never. Epic says players who have these emotes hidden with this new setting will see a player using the emote standing still, with no emote sound. 
This new setting can be found under &quot;Social Privacy&quot; in the Fortnite settings and it defaults to only show these confrontational emotes from friends in your party. Epic stresses that this setting does not change a player&#x27;s ability to use any emotes. It is now live in-game.

                              <span>Publisher Atlus and developer Studio Zero have released a new trailer for the upcoming fantasy RPG, Metaphor: ReFantazio, and it features plenty of new gameplay. It also reveals Metaphor: ReFantazio will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on October 11. 
Dubbed &quot;The King&#x27;s Trial,&quot; this new trailer sets up a bit of the Metaphor: ReFantazio&#x27;s world more, highlighting a tournament for the king&#x27;s throne at the center of the narrative. It seems our protagonist and the friends and allies they encounter along the way are vying for a crown that others are also after. In order to claim it, players must complete trials across the lands, proving their worth. 
Check it out for yourself in the Metaphor: ReFantazio gameplay trailer below: 


As you can see, Metaphor: ReFantazio continues to look excellent, with its Persona inspirations on full display. That&#x27;s not surprising, though, considering Studio Zero is composed of various leads from Atlus&#x27; popular Persona series, including the latest in the franchise, Persona 5. 
If you&#x27;ve played Persona 5 Royal, or even the recently released Persona 3 Reload, then you know we&#x27;re likely in for a treat when it comes to a few things: combat, narrative, and art. And if this new look at the game&#x27;s menu are any indication, the Persona team has been cooking something special for Metaphor: ReFantazio. 
The trailer also reveals Metaphor: ReFantazio will get a special Collector&#x27;s Edition for $149.99. The game&#x27;s standard release will cost $69.99.
Here&#x27;s what the Collector&#x27;s Edition looks like: 
Metaphor: ReFantazio hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on October 11, 2024.

Major publishers assert that digitizing books without appropriate licensing amounts to infringement but IA counters that the practice is in the public interest. It also fits copyright&#x27;s ultimate purpose; to promote the broad public availability of literature and other arts.

                              <span>Well, that didn’t take long. After tech demos from the likes of Nvidia inviting us to chat with NPCs whose entire conversations are generated by AI, it looks like the first game built wholly on that controversial idea is due to arrive this year. Uncover the Smoking Gun puts its ChatGPT-powered dialogue front and centre, as the player’s detective interviews robot suspects to solve a murder case.

Maybe you yearn for a simple life of bucolic betterment to recover from your addiction to spicy wedding bands but still fear to stray too far from your beloved fantasy franchise. Oh look, it&#x27;s Tales of the Shire, a game set in Middle-earth which features not a single ounce of stabbing nor - as far as I can tell - any gigantic spiders at all. It&#x27;s a life sim about building a home in Hobbiton and keeping up with the Proudfeet. Maybe you will also get to lie around getting totally blazed on halfling reefer. Although I did not spot that in this hearthful new trailer.

                              <span>At the end of last year I played the demo for An English Haunting and got very excited. I like horror that has a generally spooky, creeping dread vibe rather than being wall-to-wall cheap jumpscares and gore, and that sort of stuff is thin on the ground. But it&#x27;ll be less so from May the 15th, cos that&#x27;s when this ghosty point and click puzzle adventure is out! Hooray! The demo is still on Steam if you want a taste before then. In the meantime, the release date announcement comes with a new trailer to enjoy.

                              <span>Until I played Tales Of Kenzera: Zau I figured people had run out of ways to make original platformers, but an Afrofuturist story-in-a-story framing for a mythological platformer about healthy ways to deal with grief sure did teach me to not underestimate human creativity. I really liked a lot about Tales Of Kenzera, and got annoyed by a bunch of stuff too - and the division seems to be that a lot of the former falls on the story and design side, and the latter on the mechanical side, which I guess isn&#x27;t ideal for a platformer. But still, I think it&#x27;s worth persevering.

                              <span>Famed mass-layoff-manufacturing corporation Embracer Group are dividing into three companies, which will be listed separately on Sweden’s stock exchange. Those companies are: Asmodee Group, which comprises Embracer’s tabletop games biz; Coffee Stain &amp; Friends, an evolution of the existing Coffee Stain publisher, who will pursue &quot;a dual focus on indie and A/AA premium and free-to-play games for PC/console and mobile&quot;; and Middle-earth Enterprises &amp; Friends, “a creative powerhouse in AAA game development and publishing for PC and console, as well as the stewards of The Lord of the Rings and Tomb Raider intellectual properties, among many others”. 

After writing roughly 100,000 posts about Embracer’s butchering of vast swathes of the games industry, this is surely my chance to raise a cheer and celebrate the conglomerate’s unglomming with a cool glass of turnip juice, but it is Monday, the man next door is shouting again, and I am tired - so tired that only ill-suited Simpsons references come to mind.

                              <span>Rising Up is a free, sub-fifteen minute browser game that’s a bit like Streets of Rage, where you play a balding office worker and beat a giant scanner to death within the first 30 seconds. This, I believe, should be enough to tempt you into dunking it enthusiastically into your next break coffee, but if you need more convincing, let’s do it.
Created by E.H Jørgensen, whose credits include Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak, Rising Up is a relatively simple 3 button side scroller that has you make your way up an office building, destroying everything in your path. First, irate co-workers wield swivel chairs. Then, security join the fray. Then some sort of G-men get involved. You can punch, block, jump, and air-kick. The brawling is simple but satisfying enough, and the way office equipment violently degrades when hit is better, but this isn’t why I’m recommending the game.

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently trying to find a new flat in London. This is not much fun, though it&#x27;s a great opportunity to meet and bond with other would-be tenants over a shared, grinding resentment of landlords who will literally stuff a bed in a toilet and call it a &quot;studio apartment&quot;. It&#x27;s also left me powerfully invested in the premise of Blue Prince, a first-person puzzler which looks like a graphic novel and starts with your character inheriting a huge, weird, isolated mansion, Mt. Holly, from an eccentric great-uncle. 


Lucky you! There&#x27;s a catch, though: according to your great-uncle&#x27;s will, you only get to keep the place if you can find its 46th room. The catch hanging off that catch is that going by its flatplan, the mansion only has 45 rooms. And the catch hanging off that catch is that the mansion changes shape between visits. Every time you open one of its many doors, you must choose from three cards to decide which room is on the other side. To find the elusive 46th room, you must &quot;draft&quot; rooms in certain combinations to unfold the mystery of the place and wiggle your way to its heart.

                              <span>Ugh, I do not have the energy to feed the Maw this week. Sometimes the creature manifests as a proper monstrosity, with B-movie prosthetics and sound effects, and sometimes, it&#x27;s more of an... unfathomable annoyance, like a nose that won&#x27;t stop running, or a single player game that requires an internet connection. In either case, the Maw must be sated, and fortunately, there are quite a few appetising video-or-computer games out in the next seven days, with at least one behemoth landing on Friday.

                              <span>With the introduction of Fortnite Festival, Epic&#x27;s rhythm game within the chart-topping Battle Royale, there&#x27;s more incentive than ever for musicians to have their likenesses added to the game. The latest of these artists is Billie Eilish, who announced her collaboration with the game on social media earlier today.

Eilish is not just getting a skin added to the game (like Eminem, for example), she&#x27;s the next headliner for Fortnite Festival&#x27;s main stage event, which will start tomorrow, April 23. This includes a set of artist-specific rotating songs players can compete for high scores in, as well as unlockable skins, songs, instruments, and other cosmetics, though unlocking all of these requires the purchase of the pricey 1,800 V-Buck Festival Pass. Previous headliners were The Weeknd and Lady Gaga.
Eilish recently made headlines for winning a Grammy, Golden Globe, and Oscar for &quot;What Was I Made For&quot; from the Barbie movie, which is a task she&#x27;s now accomplished twice. Even more recently, she announced her upcoming album Hit Me Hard And Soft, which is likely her main marketing incentive for appearing in the game. For more Fortnite, check out the current Avatar: The Last Airbender crossover and read about the upcoming Star Wars event.

This trailer arrives after the companies teased releasing the first Tales of the Shire trailer this month, following the game&#x27;s reveal last year. 
In Tales of the Shire, players will create their own Hobbit before setting forth into Bywater, the shire setting of the game. Here, players can forage fruits and herbs, tend to gardens, fish, trade with townsfolk, and more, all while working to help Bywater, which has not yet been established as an official village in Hobbiton, flourish.

Partnering with IGN, the ID@Xbox Digital Showcase will air live next Monday, April 29, at 10 AM PT/ 1 PM ET. The event will feature &quot;epic trailers, fresh gameplay, and new reveals,&quot; according to the announcement blog.

They&#x27;ve also given a heads-up on some games we can expect to see. Vampire Survivors, which cracked our top ten games of the year back in 2022, has been on the platform for some time now, but recently announced a new expansion featuring weapons and characters from the Contra series. Dungeons of Hinterberg is an action-adventure title announced at SGF last year that we got a chance to preview. The showcase will also spotlight co-op roguelike 33 Immortals and Don&#x27;t Nod&#x27;s upcoming adventure title, Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage.
For more context, last year&#x27;s version of this event included over 20 games, including Sea of Stars, Karateka, and Vampire Survivors again, somehow. Regardless of whether or not it appears, you can bet the comment section will be flooded with Hollow Knight: Silksong fans clamoring for the game, which we haven&#x27;t seen since the Xbox summer showcase in 2022 when it was announced the game would come to Game Pass on day one.
You can watch the showcase next week on IGN&#x27;s YouTube channel. The showcase will also be available in American Sign Language.
What are you hoping to see from the showcase? Let us know in the comments!</span>

In Tales of Kenzera: Zau, the debut game from Surgent Studios, the use of the word &quot;Tales&quot; is more literal than it initially seems. To kick off the events of the game, protagonist Zuberi reads a book written by his late father about a place called Kenzera. He uses fiction to cope with his grief, just as the player might do with the plot of the game, and as the studio founder, who lost his father as well, did when creating the story to begin with.

                              <span>Embracer Group, the company that recently sold Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic remake developer Saber Interactive for $500 million, has announced its plans to split into three individual, publicly traded companies. As such, Embracer Group as we know it will be no more; instead, it will largely consist of Asmodee, Coffee Stain &amp; Friends, and Middle-earth Enterprises &amp; Friends. 
Each of these companies will be run individually and traded publicly in the market, with IP and franchises under the Embracer Group umbrella spread across them. This separation follows a rocky period for Embracer Group, which is behind layoffs at companies like Black Forest Games and Eidos-Montréal after a planned $2 billion deal with Saudi Arabia-backed Savvy Games Group fell through in 2023.

One of the highlights of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 was Knuckles, voiced by Idris Elba. The fish-out-of-water gags and his strict adherence to the echidna warrior code, which is in stark contrast to Sonic&#x27;s fun-loving personality, made for an enjoyable dynamic within the cast of characters. Knuckles, the new six-episode streaming show on Paramount Plus, tries to carry forward that dynamic. However, thanks to low stakes, a palpable disconnect from the larger Sonic story, and too much emphasis on the human characters in the world, it falls short of the heights reached by the two theatrical films.

The prosecution followed criminal referrals from the Premier League and ACE, who note that this is the country&#x27;s first-ever piracy conviction. While this is significant, the BestBuyIPTV brand isn&#x27;t gone.

                              <span>Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes is the spiritual successor to a classic JRPG called Suikoden, and it came to be thanks to a very successful Kickstarter campaign. As someone with little knowledge of Suikoden, I went into Hundred Heroes thinking it was going to be a dense, old-fashioned, and slightly impenetrable time. And yes, some of it is annoying and obtuse and will almost certainly suit veterans who enjoy those quirks, but it has a surprisingly easy going nature. Hundred Heroes accomodates new players like me with combat that&#x27;s simple to grasp and a story that&#x27;s emotional and sprawling and absolutely worth your time.

I have felt tremendously guilty about deceiving you across the 353 previous WAWAPTW posts. The weight of that is honestly why I&#x27;ve left. It feels good to finally come clean. Whew!

As its name suggests, it can be directly installed on smart TVs, thanks to listings on the official LG and Samsung app stores. In Spain, ISPs have just started blocking access to Smart IPTV&#x27;s official site on copyright grounds. For an app that contains no streams, period, a cynical move like this gains perfect cover under an administrative blocking scheme.

Serving a German audience, the streaming portal shut down in 2013, but that wasn&#x27;t the end of the story. This week, a suspected operator of the site and an accomplice were charged by German authorities. The long delay is noteworthy but also lucrative; a Bitcoin haul with a current value of €3 billion was seized recently.

While visiting Massive Entertainment to be among the first to get my hands on Star Wars Outlaws, I enjoyed playing through stealth sequences, shootouts, conversations, and open-world speeder gameplay. However, one piece of the Star Wars Outlaws puzzle I did not get a chance to experience firsthand is the space gameplay. Thankfully, in addition to playing a chunk of Star Wars Outlaws during my time in Malmö, Sweden, I also had a chance to ask the developers how the game works once you jump into your ship and leave the planet or moon.
In Star Wars Outlaws, you play Kay Vess and her com…</span>

                              <span>After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora&#x27;s Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora&#x27;s Mask&#x27;s unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 2 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved.

This update, which reveals the studio is still hard at work on the game, arrives after an unspecified number of layoffs hit Telltale Games last October. 
&quot;We&#x27;ve been quiet because we&#x27;ve been heads down, focusing on the promise of [The Wolf Among Us 2],&quot; the update reads. &quot;While we can&#x27;t give a big update yet, here&#x27;s a little something for you: in-progress shots from the current build. The work continues. The Fabletown gang will be back. Thanks for being fans.&quot; 
The four in-progress shots from the current build of The Wolf Among Us 2 can be viewed below: 

The Wolf Among Us 2 was originally due out last year but was delayed out of 2023 in a March update from the studio. 
For more about the game, watch The Wolf Among Us 2&#x27;s official trailer, and then read about how the game&#x27;s first episode will catch you up on what happened in the first game.

                              <span>PlayStation and K-Pop singer NakedBibi, or Bibi for short, have teamed up to create a new song and music video inspired by Stellar Blade, the upcoming action game from developer ShiftUp. Stellar Blade hits PlayStation 5 exclusively next week on April 26 so this new track, appropriately titled &quot;Eve,&quot; is coming at a perfect time to keep excitement for the game going. 
The song itself is pretty great, too, and the music video visuals are very reminiscent of Stellar Blade itself. If you&#x27;re excited about the game, or a fan of NakedBibi, it&#x27;s definitely worth your time. 
Check out the &quot;Eve&quot; Stellar Blade music video by NakedBibi for yourself below: 


If you haven&#x27;t yet checked it out, there&#x27;s a free Stellar Blade demo available right now on PS5 to give you a taste of what&#x27;s in the final release. For more about the game, read Game Informer&#x27;s exclusive interview with Stellar Blade&#x27;s director for behind-the-scene details and more. After that, read about how Stellar Blade will have no microtransactions, with one exception. 
Stellar Blade hits PS5 on April 26, 2024.

                              <span>Amazon Prime Video has renewed its Fallout television show for another season, confirming that Season 2 is in the works following an earlier report. This news arrives just over a week after the series&#x27; release on April 10, which premiered two days earlier than expected to rave reviews from both fans and critics. 
We loved Fallout Season 1, and you can read about why in Game Informer&#x27;s Fallout review, so we&#x27;re excited to revisit the wasteland with Lucy, Ghoul, Maximus, and others. As for when to expect Season 2 of Fallout, that remains unknown. The announcement simply confirms another season is coming with no details on Season 2&#x27;s production.

Dawntrail’s benchmark is especially noteworthy as it’s the first time we’ve really been able to put the MMO’s much-anticipated graphical update arriving with 7.0 into practice and see what sort of demands it might make on our hardware by overhauling the 10-year-old game’s visuals.

                              <span>It seems that Prison Architect 2 is going method in its approach to launching the 3D sequel to the jailhouse management game, as - like its inmates - it just can’t seem to secure a solid release. Originally due to arrive in March, before being pushed into May, developers Double Eleven have now shunted it all the way back to September.

Long-term readers might have discerned that I haven&#x27;t been well for a very long time. I have various ailments, of which we all suffer, and it turns out that a mere five years of clinging on by your fingernails sometimes leads to some actual treatment for... all of them. Wild.
So while there&#x27;ve been a lot of interesting looking games in the shortlist lately, these last few weeks have been entirely too interesting for me personally. Piecing It Together is nothing more or less than 3D jigsaw puzzles. I&#x27;ve never even liked jigsaws, but it turns out that was exactly the kind of game I needed.

                              <span>What I like about browser games is that clicking on a word in this mundane piece of software could take you anywhere, to anything. For example, if you click on this link to the domain corru.observer, you&#x27;ll find yourself in a dark room before a strange glowing device. Apparently it&#x27;s your job to do... something with it? So begins one of the most surprising and delightful games I&#x27;ve played all year, a sprawling, shape-shifting sci-fi story which is still unfolding through updates. I didn&#x27;t even know all this was possible with HTML and CSS.

                              <span>Capcom are working on another Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 patch, and this one takes as its target the dreaded dragonsplague, which causes the game&#x27;s AI-controlled pawns to go nuts and murder everybody, including story-critical NPCs, if you allow it to go untreated for long enough. It&#x27;ll reduce the infection frequency of dragonsplague, which is spread when pawns mingle with other pawns online, and make the symptoms more obvious. Pawns already get glowing eyes when they&#x27;re dragonsplagued - I guess they&#x27;ll be all the glowier in future.

                              <span>While trying to keep vaguely up on both games discourse and terminology over long periods of time, I frequently find myself noticing terms enter common usage, get used a bunch, then fall out of favour again. I think this is partly because games discourse is cyclical, and partly because writing and talking about the same things a lot means that when a neater phrase for something complicated pops up, it gets assimilated quickly. Mostly, though, I think it’s because of my brain doing the thing where, say, you notice a yellow car on a walk and then see dozens of them. I was going to write a car make there but I don’t know any. Uh, (looks at monitor), Asus? Do Asus do cars? The 1994 Asus Gremlin. What a ride!

                              <span>I don&#x27;t remember much about my grandfathers anymore, only that they were once there and they loved me, and now they are gone. So if I were a small child with quarreling parents and I stumbled across a hidden abandoned lab housing a horrifying shapeshifting psychic lifeform, perhaps I would also try to want this maybe-a-demon to be my grandpa. That&#x27;s the premise of Growing My Grandpa!, a delightful little indie horror game about feeding, teaching, and caring for &quot;a grandpa-like entity&quot;. It came out in 2022 and I kept forgetting to post about it, but it&#x27;s still great so I&#x27;m telling you now, okay.

                              <span>It&#x27;s starting to feel like ConcernedApe (aka Eric Barone) may in fact be a modern day Sisiphus, destined to work on Stardew Valley forever. Following on from the mega update of 1.6 a month ago, and 1.6.3 soon after that, the hardy perennial farming game has a new 1.6.4 mini update. The key addition this time is more new layouts that will appear after you reach the bottom of the mines, and more layouts for the volcano mines too. If you&#x27;ve not played Stardew Valley you might wonder why there are deep mines and volcanos, and to you I say &quot;Pah! You should play Stardew Valley.&quot;
1.6.4 also has a lot of bug fixes (including fixing disappearing pets, new pets being a key feature of 1.6) and some balance changes, as well as a host of fixes for modders and modded players. ConcernedApe said early on that 1.6 would be an update for modders, so it&#x27;s nice to see that being supported. You can read the full patch notes here.

                              <span>Neverlooted Dungeon is an rpg game in which you can shoot a crossbow from a first person perspective. This, I imagine, was the pitch it used when trying to blag its way past the thermodynamically powered golem wearing a Daikatana t-shirt that guards the gates of Steam’s currently-running FPS fest. Whatever the excuse, this silver tongued rascal succeeded, and is now nestled comfortably between umpteen boomer shooter revivals, trying to squeeze Ultima factoids into the conversation.

Kingdom Come: Deliverance faced a rocky launch in 2018, with outlets (including Game Informer) criticizing its widespread bugs and general lack of polish, but it found success regardless, going on to sell two million copies and release a slate of DLC and updates. Six years later, Warhorse Studios is getting ready to launch a sequel and invited Game Informer to take a look at some early footage and trailers. While it&#x27;s too early to speak to any performance issues, it&#x27;s clear Warhorse has greatly expanded its work on the first game, and fans of the medieval ages may be in for a t…</span>

                              <span>Jack Black seems to have more or less confirmed his rumored role as Steve in the upcoming Minecraft movie. 
The actor took to Instagram on Tuesday to post a short video of himself on a film lot observing a rainbow before entering a trailer labeled “Steve, Minecraft.” The interior features promotional art of Steve as the actor smiles at the camera. 
A report in January stated Black would be voicing Minecraft’s mascot but had not been officially confirmed by the film’s production companies, Warner Bros. and Legendary. Although this technically isn’t an official announcement either, I&#x27;d say there&#x27;s roughly a 99.99 percent chance that Black is involved.
The Minecraft movie, which has been in development in some form or another since 2014, is directed by Nacho Libre director Jared Hess. The cast includes Jason Momoa (Aquaman, Game of Thrones), Danielle Brooks (The Color Purple), Jennifer Coolidge (The White Lotus, American Pie), and Emma Myers (Wednesday). Minecraft is scheduled to hit theaters on April 4, 2025. 
Jack Black is obviously no stranger to video game movies. He voiced Bowser in The Super Mario Bros. Movie and portrays Claptrap in the upcoming Borderlands.</span>

                              <span>A court in Japan has ordered the former operator of pirate site Mangamura to pay 1.7 billion yen ($11m) in damages to manga publishers Shogakukan, Kadokawa, and Shueisha. In 2021, Romi Hoshino received a three-year prison sentence after a criminal prosecution but in a subsequent civil action, the publishers hoped to recoup millions in damages. Commenting outside the Tokyo District Court on Thursday, Hoshino was clear: &quot;I have no intention of paying anything.&quot;

It soon became apparent that several major Hollywood studios, StudioCanal, Apple and Amazon, had obtained a court order to seize Uptobox servers hosted at two cloud hosting companies. Seven months later, Uptobox&#x27;s Dubai-based owner has just tried to convince a court that Uptobox should be resurrected.

Still, camcorder piracy remains a threat; data just released by the Film Content Protection Agency reveals that exhibitors reported 155 piracy-related security incidents in 2023. The end result was the worst year for pirates in the UK since 2012.

As Kay Vess, the main protagonist in Star Wars Outlaws, you must work within the thriving underworld to accomplish your goals. Because Kay&#x27;s adventure takes place between The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, the underworld is thriving. The Empire is focusing its efforts on finishing off the retreating Rebel Alliance. While many of the moons and planets are under Imperial occupation, its primary focus is finding Rebels. Kay must take advantage of the criminal underworld, which led developer Massive Entertainment to create the Reputation System, a reflection of her standing …</span>

Children of the Sun is hellbent on occupying your mind. During the six hours it took me to hit credits, I was engrossed in mastering its simple, yet wonderfully executed central mechanic.

Little Kitty, Big City - May 9 


As the title suggests, you control a small cat in a mini-open world set within a bustling, Japanese-inspired metropolis. Your goal is to find a way home, but plenty of distractions and opportunities to help fellow animal friends or cause chaos will likely delay your departure.

Wayforward and Atari are teaming up for a 2D Metroidvania spin-off of the 1982 classic Yars’ Revenge. This side-scrolling platformer stars Emi Kimura, a young hacker (using the handle of Yar) who gets embroiled in an intergalactic conspiracy cente…</span>

As a longtime Spider-Man and Marvel fan, I&#x27;ve delighted in watching my favorite villains – and those I rarely think of – pop up throughout the multi-game journey. Check out all the villains in Insomniac&#x27;s Spider-Man universe below, and…</span>

                              <span>With huge winter game releases behind us and huge summer announcements right around the corner, the games industry is set for a relatively quiet month or two. Luckily, Nintendo plans to briefly step in to fill that void. Today, it announced the next Indie World Showcase, a live stream event focused on the latest indie titles to come to the Switch, for tomorrow, April 17. The showcase will air at 7 AM PT/10 AM ET and last for around 20 minutes.
New #IndieWorld Showcase incoming! 💡

Tune in tomorrow, 4/17 at 7am PT for roughly 20 minutes of announcements and updates on indie games headed to #NintendoSwitch in 2024.

It&#x27;s in the name so it might be obvious to some, but don&#x27;t expect any first-party games or hardware announcements out of this event. An Indie World Showcase is also not the same thing as a Nintendo Partner Showcase, which is just a show about third party games. This can include indie titles (the last one had a trailer for Another Crab&#x27;s Treasure, for example) but also includes larger developers, like Sega or Atlus.
If that&#x27;s confusing, you can get a sense of the games that have been showcased in this type of presentation in the past by visiting the official Indie World site. Fans will most likely be clamoring for a trailer or release date for Hollow Knight: Silksong, the sequel to the 2017 bug-themed Metroidvania. But while it&#x27;s (hopefully) right around the corner, there&#x27;s no specific reason to believe it will appear at this event other than the fact that it&#x27;s an indie game coming to the Switch.
We won&#x27;t know until the Indie World Showcase properly airs tomorrow. When it does, you can watch it right here.</span>

                              <span>Keanu Reeves is joining the cast of Sonic the Hedgehog 3, according to a report by The Hollywood Reporter (and first broken by The John Campea Show). The outlet’s sources report that the John Wick and Matrix star is voicing Shadow the Hedgehog.
Sonic the Hedgehog 3 is set to premiere on December 20 and will pit Shadow alongside a returning Dr. Robotnik (played by Jim Carrey) against Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles. The returning cast includes Ben Schwartz, Idris Elba, James Marsden, and Colleen O&#x27;Shaughnessey. The film&#x27;s first trailer premiered in front of a select audience at Cinemacon in Las Vegas last week and it provided the first real look at Shadow. Unfortunately, the trailer has yet to be publically released. 
Paramount has yet to officially confirm Reeves&#x27; casting, but if this is true, he will join fellow new cast members, including Krysten Ritter, Alyla Browne, James Wolk, Sofia Pernas, Cristo Fernández, and Jorma Taccone. Shadow&#x27;s debut was teased at the end of Sonic the Hedgehog 2, but his voice performer has been a tantalizing mystery since the third film was announced in August 2022. 
Meanwhile, the standalone Knuckles series premieres on Paramount Plus on April 26. You can watch the first full-length trailer for that here.

                              <span>Final Fantasy XIV’s next expansion, Dawntrail, arrives this summer alongside the game’s first graphical update. As such, Square Enix has released a new benchmark software to let PC players test how well their machines will handle these new bells and whistles while getting a small head start on Dawntrail.
Available as a free download for Windows, the benchmark software uses playable characters and actual maps to assign a performance score to your PC. This will provide a peek at the new graphical update, which spruces up the game with enhanced textures, shadows, material qualities, and other elements. You can download the benchmark here. 
The benchmark includes a character creator for players to craft a fresh hero ahead of Dawntrail’s launch. It also includes access to the new female Hrothgar race. Existing characters can also be imported into the benchmark, and the appearance data from these characters can be imported into the full release of Dawntrail on Windows. 
Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail launches on July 2. You can learn more about the expansion here. The game currently has a crossover event with Final Fantasy XVI that runs until May 8</span>

As you navigate the galaxy in Star Wars Outlaws, you do so as Kay Vess, a pickpocket-turned-thief who gets in over her head and winds up with a bounty on her head. Early in conversations, Lucasfilm Games and developer Massive Entertainment agreed that telling a scoundrel story was the way to go. Through these discussions, Massive decided it wanted to portray a &quot;resourceful underdog&quot; for its main character rather than the trained soldiers that star in The Division.
In the various meetings with Lucasfilm Games, Massive Entertainment looked at the various archetypes available to players…</span>

                              <span>Despite currently being in the midst of a crossover event with Avatar: The Last Airbender, Fortnite is teasing an upcoming event with a returning collaborator: Star Wars. The details have yet to be disclosed, but attentive fans of the science fiction juggernaut will notice something about the start date right away. The event is set to take place on Friday, May 3. The following day, May 4th, is known to many as Star Wars Day.
We have a good feeling about this...Star Wars is returning to #Fortnite. pic.twitter.com/6MCkDkolNb
April 15, 2024
The most newsworthy piece of info here, however, is the fact that the teaser indicates collaborations across several of Fortnite&#x27;s new modes. This includes the classic battle Royale mode, the survival/crafting Lego mode, and the rhythm Festival mode, though Rocket Racing was notably excluded. Crossovers between Fortnite and other IPs usually just include cosmetic bundles, but this seems to imply that it will provide content for three different areas of the game.
The current Elements event pass technically includes a Lego variant skin as well as a guitar for Festival mode, so this Star Wars event could be as simple as that, but it&#x27;s not unreasonable to speculate that Star Wars is a big enough property to warrant a larger scale crossover event. That said, this is just speculation.
Previous Star Wars crossovers included a Darth Vader boss battle, lightsabers, blasters, and force abilities, as well as a huge roster of skins spanning the movies and shows. Most recently, Ahsoka joined the fray as a part of the Chapter 4 Season 4 battle pass. 
If you&#x27;re interested in more Star Wars video games, you&#x27;re in luck – we just launched our latest cover story, which features an exclusive look at Star Wars Outlaws. We&#x27;ve also got a hands-on preview, a video interview with the developers, and an entire hub devoted to this month&#x27;s coverage of the game.

                              <span>The 2017 low-gravity hero shooter LawBreakers is coming back from the dead. However, this isn’t an official revival but rather due to the work of a dedicated group of fans.
LawBreakers was created by Boss Key Productions, a team led by Gears of War lead designer Cliff Bleszinski. Upon launching for PlayStation 4 and PC in August 2017, it garnered a generally positive critical impression (read our review here). However, it failed to find its place in the competitive multiplayer shooter market of the time, resulting in poor sales and low player engagement that eventually led to its early demise in September 2018. 
Now, a team of passionate fans has worked to bring LawBreakers back. Dubbed The RELB Project, the project has been in the works since at least 2020. Its FAQ states that “This is a project to bring back the game LawBreakers, it&#x27;s done by creating &#x27;fake&#x27; servers that the original game client uses. You can join by downloading the launcher, patching your game and playing like normal.”
RELB’s website allows you to download the launcher. Despite this revival being an unofficial project, Cliff Bleszinki (who has been vocal about wanting to see LawBreakers come back) has given it his blessing and enthusiastically shared RELB’s Discord on Saturday. 
Somehow LawBreakers is coming back, see below!!!

April 13, 2024
The RELB Project is still very much a work in progress, but the team held its first series of public playtests this past weekend. Although several modes and features from the game were disabled, these sessions appear to have been largely successful. The next playtest has not been scheduled, and the team is currently seeking more developers.

                              <span>The rogue-lite and roguelike genres have been growing in popularity over the years They’re challenging games where players attempt runs with different abilities and random elements that generally force the player to restart from zero or near-zero for each attempt. They are born from the 1980 game Rogue which established many of the mechanics now considered staples of the genre.
But the difference between rogue-lite and -like has always been confusing, so we asked an expert from Evil Empire, the co-developer of Dead Cells, to explain it to us. Lucie Dewagnier is the game director of the upcoming The Rogue: Prince of Persia (a rogue-lite) and defines the subgenres like this.
“Roguelike is – like the game Rogue – a game where you play, you die, you hit replay, but nothing is kept between your attempts. You will always replay the game from a blank slate. 
Rogue-lite may add some things like permanent upgrades and enhancements that make your future runs – your future tries – easier and has progression systems that do not exist in roguelikes.”
My hope, and I presented this plan to Dewagnier, is we drop the -lite and -like suffixes from the genre name and just refer to all games as existing within the Rogue genre. Dead Cells, Hades, Undermine, Returnal, etc. are no longer variations of rogue-lites and roguelikes – they’re all Rogue games.
“Yeah, even now there are games like Spelunky that are part of Rogulikes, but they have progression systems with new content you can get, so maybe it’s rogue-lite? Maybe it’s Roguelike? They’re Rogues.”
To read more about Evil Empire and Dewagnier’s next game, The Rogue: Prince of Persia (which is a rogue-lite, “With a ‘T’,” Dewagnier says), head here.</span>

                              <span>The Pokémon Trading Card Game: Scarlet &amp; Violet series rolls on with the latest expansion. This newest set, Temporal Forces, continues the Ancient and Future conventions introduced in Paradox Rift, giving players new strategies featuring a variety of easily playable Basic Pokémon. 
The Pokémon Company sent along a bunch of booster packs for us to open to see what we could pull. The set is one of the smaller recent expansions, but still large by the long-established standard of Pokémon TCG. Players picking up Temporal Forces can expect to pull from a pool of more than 160 cards. In addition to the additional Ancient and Future Pokémon, Temporal Forces reintroduces Ace Spec cards, first implemented during the Black &amp; White series of cards. Those Ace Spec cards were some of the more unique cards I pulled, but the full-art Pokémon and ex cards most wowed me; I particularly love the Arbok and Minccio full-arts I grabbed. 
Check out my favorites I pulled from Pokémon Trading Card Game&#x27;s Scarlet &amp; Violet – Temporal Forces expansion below!

                              <span>Nintendo Switch Online’s Super Nintendo catalog is three games larger today thanks to the additions of Super R-Type, Wrecking Crew ‘98, and Amazing Hebereke.


Super R-Type is a side-scrolling sci-fi shooter launched in 1991, and it’s essentially an enhanced port of the arcade game R-Type II. It includes elements from that game while featuring new stages and enemies of its own.  
Wrecking Crew ‘98 is the Japan-only sequel to the NES classic Wrecking Crew. First released in 1998 for Nintendo Power’s download service before getting its own cartridge, this marks the game’s first release in the West.
Amazing Hebereke is a 1994 fighting game by Sunsoft that pits up to four players battling to knock each other out. The game is a spin-off of the Hebereke series (known here as Uforia: The Saga, of which its long-awaited sequel recently launched).

                              <span>At the Triple-i Initiative earlier this week, Gearbox Publishing and developer Wabisabi Games unveiled RKGK. Sporting an eye-popping art direction that blends anime and graffiti art influences, this promising-looking action platformer is coming this year.
RKGK (pronounced “Rakugaki”) unfolds in a Cap City, a futuristic metropolis caught in a vice grip by the oppressive B Corp led by the villainous Mr. Buff. The plot centers on rebellious graffiti artist Valah, who rages against this machine by using her art to bring life back to the city and inspire its citizens to stand up and rebel.


Valah gets around by using her graffiti paint to stylishly grind on rails while chaining jumps, dashes, and glides. She also has appears to have her own drone to soar across the cityscape. High-speed platforming is the name of the game, and maintaining a smooth flow state sends her into Defacer mode, transforming the world into a dreamy animated version of itself. Although the trailer doesn’t show off gameplay, it depicts Valah spraying paint to destroy B Corps’ robotic minions. You’ll also be able to create graffiti art using an array of paint and cosmetic tools. Check out the screenshots below for an in-game look at RKGK. 

RKGK is Wabisabi Games’ debut title and looks to follow in the graffiti-soaked dystopian future footsteps of games like Jet Set Radio and Marc Ecko’s Getting Up (remember that?). It’s coming to PC later this year.</span>

                              <span>Total Eclipse, a real-time, curse-breaking, 3D adventure (with a dash of Indiana Jones flair), is ready for public testing!
Originally unleashed by Incentive Software Ltd. in 1988, Total Eclipse added yet another groundbreaking title to their repertoire of revolutionary games.
Step into the shoes of a heroic archeologist on October 26, 1930, as a total solar eclipse akin to the one happening today over North America looms over Cairo. Knowing of the Ardognus prophecy, created by the powerful high priest Hahmid III, you must find and destroy the hidden shrine devoted to Ra before the eclipse occurs.
Embark on this exciting journey packed with a trusty gun for blasting through doors or dispatching undead mummies; a compass to guide you through a treacherous pyramid; a wristwatch to track the precious time left; and a water bottle to fight dehydration (you’re only human after all). 
Can you solve this ancient mystery within 120 minutes and avert catastrophe, or will Rah&#x27;s wrath obliterate the moon?
Our modern reimplementation of the Freescape engine features graphics using hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Total Eclipse support includes DOS (EGA/CGA modes), ZX Spectrum, and Amstrad CPC. More releases are coming at a later date. Additionally, there are three playable demos if you want to test the game. Please contact us if you have some other release or demo.
To play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.

                              <span>Oh MMy — a new ScummVM release!
Please welcome the first ScummVM release of the year: ScummVM 2.8.1.
ScummVM 2.8.1 is a maintenance release mainly focused on fixing bugs that were uncovered since our last stable release.
This update includes upgrades for the following engines: AGI, AGS, GRIM, SWORD2, MM (which is now enabled — yes, we really skipped it in 2.8.0 by accident), mTropolis, NANCY, SCUMM, TWINE, Ultima, and V-Cruise.
The Android, Atari and macOS ports received multiple bug fixes, mostly for improving overall stability and preventing some crashes we’ve seen under certain circumstances.
The detailed list of improvements is available here.
As always, you can find the latest release on our Downloads page.
Go grab it while it&#x27;s hot — enjoy!
