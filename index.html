Sonic Colors Ultimate had quite a rough launch when it arrived on the Nintendo Switch in September - with players reportedly encountering all sorts of issues. We investigated it ourselves at the time and were also able to replicate these issues by following certain steps.
Since then, the Switch version has received some patches, and now we&#x27;re up to Version 1.0.6 (also referred to as 2.6 across multiple other platforms). Here are the full patch notes via the official Sonic the Hedgehog Twitter account:

Reggie Fils-Aimé has done all sorts of things since he retired from his role as Nintendo of America&#x27;s president in 2019, and his latest temporary gig is well worth watching if you love learning about the history of the video game industry.
The man who made a name for himself during Nintendo&#x27;s DS and Wii generation has been given the job of moderating - or should we say hosting - a special 20th anniversary Xbox panel focused on the past, present and future. The panel itself includes stories from Reggie&#x27;s industry friends and competitors Robbie Bach, Peter Moore, Bonnie Ross, and Ed Fries.

The video features executive producer Tom Cannon and technical lead Tony Cannon unveiling a verticle slice of what Project L will eventually offer. The title will remain a 2D fighting game set in the world of Runeterra, as was initially hinted towards when the game was revealed, but now we know it&#x27;ll feature 2-on-2 battles, and character assists will factor into the gameplay. &quot;We feel this is the right foundation to build a game that rewards strategic team building and on-the-fly decision making on top of strong fighting fundamentals,&quot; says the ex…</span>

                    <span>Dead Cells’ 26th update is assembling the best and brightest of the indie action adventure genre. The aptly named Everyone Is Here patch adds familiar faces from games like Hollow Knight and Guacamelee, along with their respective weapons, to use in-game.

The free update, which is now available on PC and comes consoles later this year, lets players don the costumes of the protagonists from Hollow Knight, Hyper Light Drifter, Blasphemous, Guacamelee!, Skul: The Hero Slayer, and Curse of the Dead Gods. Better yet, you’ll wield the weapons/ability of each character. They control largely as you’ll remember them but have a Dead Cells twist.

You wake up in a dark cabin, chained to a worn table. A mysterious man sits on the other side of the room. You can&#x27;t see the details of his face through the darkness, but his crazed eyes pierce the shadows. Something under your belly lurches as he invites you to play a card game. The rules seem simple; you summon creatures to attack your opponent&#x27;s army of foes, and you easily win the first few hands. Still, you can&#x27;t shake the anxiety of what might happen if – no – when you lose. You play on, the eyes on the other side of the table slowly burning a hole in your stomach.

Not only is Aloy more dynamic and realistic-looking in this new chapter, she’ll also be exploring an immense map with its fair share of cutting-edge qualities. According to lead living world designer Espen Sogn, the dev team hopes that players will “encounter a world that feels more alive and more real than ever.” And knowing the impressive pedigree of Guerrilla Games, this will likely be the case.
The latest blog post states that designing Horizon Forbidden West’s sandbox was all about maintaining authenticity. This is primarily reflected in the cultural norms of the tribes that Aloy meets. Espen mentions two tribes and juxtaposes their customs to showcase the player’s posit…</span>

                    <span>Geoff Keighley’s annual Game Awards show is right around the corner – December 9 to be exact – and a new podcast leading up to the show will dive deep into all that goes into it. 
The Game Awards announced today that it is teaming up with music streaming service, Spotify, which will be its “exclusive audio streaming partner” for the show. It also revealed that leading up to it, a limited four-episode podcast called Inside The Game Awards will be released. 
“As part of the partnership, The Game Awards creator, executive producer, and host Geoff Keighley is hosting a special 4-episode Inside The Game Awards podcast, exclusively on Spotify beginning today, highlighting the latest news on the awards ceremony, including the incredible nominees for this year’s show, and a look at the musical elements of the show, including the return of The Game Awards Orchestra.” 
Spotify will also announce the “most listened to Spotify artists and songs” on gaming platforms globally in 2021 during the show. 
The first episode of Inside The Game Awards is now live, and the other three episodes are expected to drop leading up to the actual show on December 9. While waiting for those, read through the nominations for the Game Awards 2021. Check out Game Informer&#x27;s interview with Keighley about this year&#x27;s awards show after that.

                    <span>Hitman 3 has been out for nearly a year, and while its first year of content was expansive, Year 2 is shaping up to be just as big, if not bigger. 
IO Interactive, the developer behind Hitman 3 and the two Hitman games that came out before it, released a new blog post today detailing the game’s first year. IO revealed that Hitman 3 is the most successful Hitman game of all time and that its World of Assassination Trilogy has reached the milestone of 50 million players. It also revealed that Year 2 is starting in less than two months.

“Hitman 3 – Year 2 will start on [January 20, 2022] with post-launch support confirmed for another 12 months,” IO writes in the blog. “New maps, storylines, modes, and ways to play are all lined up for 2022, which is set to be another exciting year.” 
Also, coming to Hitman 3 next year is ray tracing on PC. Plus, PC VR support is coming in January, as is a new Elusive Target Arcade mode. 
“A new way to play Elusive Targets arrives in Hitman 3 in a brand new game mode that we’re calling Elusive Target Arcade,” the blog post reads. “Prepare to take on the ultimate Elusive Target challenge in a change to the established formula in this fan-favourite game mode. All Elusive Target Arcade content will be a permanent addition to the game. Full details on how this game mode works will be shared in early January 2022.”
The blog post ends with a “[REDACTED] update that states that IO has a “major update to the game planned” for Spring 2022. No other details were given, but the image below was included with it.

                    <span>Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition continues to be stuck between a rock and a hard place. Just one week after the highly-anticipated remasters released everywhere, Rockstar Games promised the originals would eventually be available on PC in an effort to calm angry fans. The Red Dead Redemption developer released a statement acknowledging that “the updated versions of these classic games did not launch in a state that meets our own standards of quality, or the standards our fans have come to expect.” Some players, however, are taking matters into their own hands. GTA Trilogy modders are working together to fix the game.

                    <span>The Game Boy-like device known as the Analogue Pocket will finally ship out in three weeks. 
More specifically, the first batch of devices will begin shipping on December 13 and orders are expected to reach customers sometime between December 14 and December 30. This news comes after multiple delays for the Pocket, most of which occurred due to ongoing shipping struggles and chip shortages due to the global COVID-19 pandemic. 
If you preordered the Pocket, you should have received an email already from Analogue that states the Pocket will ship in three weeks. That email also includes information about delaying your order should you be out of town for the holidays when it’s delivered. 
“We understand that some of you will be away during the holiday season and would prefer delivery in the new year,” Analogue’s announcement reads. “With this in mind, we are offering to hold your package over the holiday period and start shipping on January 3. If you cannot accept delivery between December 14 and December 30, you should request a hold for your order.”
The final date to change your order is November 28, and Analogue says no changes can be made following that. The email you’ve received includes more instructions on how to go about those changes, if necessary. While waiting for your Pocket to ship, check out the various features it includes and the accessories that go with it.

                    <span>Kojima Productions is opening a new California-based business division that will focus on movies and television. 
It’s no secret that Kojima, the famed game director behind the Metal Gear Solid series and Death Stranding, is a fan of movies and TV. All it takes is one glance at his Instagram feed to realize that. His primary focus has always been games, but it seems his studio, Kojima Productions, is preparing for a shift to other entertainment mediums. 
“Today, I can finally confirm that Kojima Productions will be opening a new business division in California, USA,” division lead Riley Russell writes in a press release. “The new division will be tasked with working with creative and talented professionals in television, music, and film, as well as the more familiar games industry. The team has as its charter, the goal of expanding the reach and awareness of the properties now under development at Kojima Productions, and to make them even more a part of our popular culture.” 
Kojima Productions business development manager, Yoshiko Fukuda, says this new division will take the studio into new sectors to develop narratives beyond video games. 
As for what to expect first from this business division, that’s unclear, although Russell does mention that it will focus on expanding narratives outside of games based on games currently in development at the studio. Perhaps it’s cooking up a Death Stranding TV series, or maybe a film based on some game the studio is working on that hasn’t even been announced yet. Only time will tell. 
While waiting to learn more, check out Game Informer’s thoughts on Death Stranding and then read this story about why Death Stranding Director’s Cut is worth another trek across America.

Game Update 2 (about as big as Game Update 1) brings a slew of changes to many of the game’s systems alongside bug squashes and fixes, too. The two most notable changes coming to Deathloop by way of this update are that NPCs are a lot smarter now, and Colt will have a harder time avoiding Julianna during an invasion, as reported by Digital Trends.

                    <span>Update: 11/22/21 7:20 a.m. Central: As per the Wall Street Journal via GamesIndustry.biz, Bobby Kotick held a meeting with top executives to discuss the state of Activision Blizzard in the face of recent controversy and allegations. The CEO told his colleagues he’d consider resigning if the countermeasures in place to combat the developers’ criminally-toxic workplace culture didn’t fix issues “with speed.” This news comes days after company shareholders called on Kotick to resign. Consequently, some of the executives that Kotick conferenced with last week emphasized that a number of staff members want him gone. A “workplace excellence committee” is being implemented, but whether or not the Activision Blizzard work conditions will change for the better, or if Kotick will be true to his word…</span>

                    <span>Kanto collection, more like.
Zavvi has launched many an exclusive Nintendo-related clothing line over the years, some featuring incredibly colourful designs, others relatively understated. The online retailer&#x27;s latest line — the Pokémon Kanji Clothing Collection — looks to be one of the &#x27;quietest&#x27; we&#x27;ve seen in some time, which might suit the more casual Pokéfan. You know, someone who wants to advertise their affection for the &#x27;mons, but without inadvertently causing traffic accidents or blinding onlookers with the eye-searing radiance of their garments.
As you can see, this monochrome collection features the evergreen Gen 1 starters — Charmander, Squirtle, and Bulbasaur — on black and white T-shirt and hoodies, with designs featuring kanji and manga-style illustrations of the fire-, water- and grass-type Pokémon. Not a primary colour to be seen, though.

It&#x27;s been about two weeks since the release of Animal Crossing: New Horizons&#x27; massive 2.0 update, as well as the Happy Home Paradise DLC, so hopefully most of you have had a good crack at it so far!
With two weeks of Brewster, Gyroids, home designs, and even the return of one Mr Resetti, we&#x27;ve all had the opportunity to settle in to a post-2.0 world, and so now we can ask you: What&#x27;s been your favourite bit so far?

                    <span>Attempts to recreate the three &#x27;tours&#x27; of the original demo.
Nintendo&#x27;s history is full of moments that have taken on a near mythological status, ranging from stories of game and hardware development to various demos and builds that are either rare or long lost. One such example is a demo for The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time that appeared at Space World &#x27;97 in Japan, a unique build that showcased elements and scenarios different from the final game. If you don&#x27;t know, Space World was an annual expo hosted by Nintendo in Japan to showcase games and hardware, running from 1989 to 2001.
A group of enthusiastic developers and modders have now recreated, as closely as possible, that Space World OoT demo from 1997. There are two main sources of the code and information that informed the development - parts of the Space World ROM that were found on a development cartridge of F-Zero X, and then from the now infamous &#x27;gigaleak&#x27;. A lot of the textures and content are from the dev cartridge source, while the gigaleak contributed a &#x27;significant amount of insight and assets that were used within this project&#x27;.

Ubisoft&#x27;s free-to-play brawler has had some notable IP crossovers in recent months, and today&#x27;s update brings a few classic characters from Capcom&#x27;s Street Fighter series. Ryu, Chun-Li and Akuma are all joining in, along with a tweaked mode, new stage and more.

                    <span>Jessie and James would be so proud.
Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl is finally here, and generally, people seem to be enjoying it... but there are some interesting bugs in the game that have been amusing players since its release last week — and one of them features Team Galactic finally doing what Team Rocket never could.
In a clip from Reddit user u/mikeloud, a Team Galactic Grunt can be seen &quot;accidentally&quot; stealing the player&#x27;s Ponyta, just by simply... scooting it off the screen. The Ponyta is, of course, outside of its Pokéball, using the Amity Square feature that lets you have your Pokémon follow you around.

We&#x27;re doing our best to highlight the best Nintendo-related Black Friday deals so you don&#x27;t have to trawl the retailer&#x27;s websites, and one of the very finest deals we&#x27;ve seen so far (for US readers, at least) comes from GameStop.

Chrono Trigger is held up as a truly iconic RPG, critically acclaimed and with an ardent fanbase even today. Its soundtrack is held in equally high regard, so an announcement out of Square Enix Japan has certainly got our attention.
As reported by Siliconera, Square Enix is releasing a Chrono Trigger jazz arrangement album, the fifth in that particular series. At present it&#x27;s opened up for pre-orders in Japan ahead of its release on 26th January.

                    <span>Let&#x27;s spell out the details.
The Switch is an ideal system for a little bit of mind exercise, with Nintendo&#x27;s own Dr. Kawashima&#x27;s Brain Training for Nintendo Switch (which has weirdly never made it to North America) and the upcoming Big Brain Academy: Brain vs. Brain, along with smaller download-only efforts focused on particular puzzle types. Another is arriving soon for those who enjoy a bit of word puzzling.
It&#x27;s Word Forward, coming to Switch via Thalamus Digital having originally been created for mobile and PC/Mac by Rocketship Park. It&#x27;s racked up millions of players through platforms like Itch.io, Android and iOS, and looks like an interesting take on the genre - some of its official blurb is below.

It might seem obvious, but the Switch is going to be in high demand as 2021 draws to a close – and a new study by technology site Trusted Reviews reveals just how popular the console is going to be during the Black Friday madness.
A team of boffins at Trusted Reviews &quot;analysed the number of online searches for technology products people look forward to going on sale on the big day,&quot; with the data revealing that Switch is the &quot;most searched technology associated with Black Friday deals, with nearly 26,000 searches for the product&quot;.

With the increasingly long and dark nights (at least for those of us in the Northern Hemisphere) the prospect of going on a relaxing walk is a little less appealing right now. If seeking a chilled and contemplative few hours of gaming &#x27;walking simulators&#x27; can be the way to go, then, and another is arriving on the Switch eShop this week.
Drizzlepath: Deja Vu arrives on 24th November priced at $6.99USD / €6.99, with a 20% launch discount also on the cards. It&#x27;s a game from Tonguç Bodur, a prolific developer that focuses on this genre and storytelling. It&#x27;s been quite well received on Steam, and below is part of the official description.

                    <span>&quot;We all have our own story with Arkanoid&quot;.
French company Microids is collaborating with Japanese veteran Taito to release a new instalment in the Arkanoid series: Arkanoid: Eternal Battle. It&#x27;s expected to launch next year, with French studio Pastagames (Rayman Mini, Pix the Cat) in charge of development. No platforms have been confirmed so far, but Microids has been a solid supporter of the Switch for a long time now.
The original Arkanoid launched in arcades in 1986 and is part of the &#x27;block breaker&#x27; genre popularised by Atari&#x27;s Breakout. It was ported to various home systems at the time, and a sequel, Arkanoid: Revenge of Doh, arrived in 1987, while the SNES sequel Arkanoid: Doh It Again and arcade entry Arkanoid Returns both hit the market 10 years later in &#x27;97. After another 10 years, Arkanoid DS was published in 2007.

                    <span>The final countdown.
Sometimes a great idea needs time to mature. Just because a smart concept isn’t executed all that well, it doesn’t mean there isn’t an excellent game coming a sequel or two down the line. What’s incredible about Unsighted is that first-time indie dev Studio Pixel Punk has created the refined experience of a longstanding franchise in a single hit. It feels like the fan-favourite entry in a series running since 1995, but is also fresh and slick, free from overgrown lore or old-fashioned legacy mechanics. With its 16-bit looks, it’s the game you wanted to play as a kid, and it’s ready to bear the weight of that expectation.
Studio Pixel Punk has ticked some helpful boxes when in comes to describing Unsighted: it’s a roguelite Metroidvania; it’s in a top-down, pixel-art world;Thanks for the offer but we&#x27;ll pass on the samples. it has RPG character progression. The scenario is sci-fi and the story follows post-apocalyptic robots suffering at the hands of humanity. With so many good old boxes ticked, a been-there-done-that response would be understandable, but the core ideas are delivered excellently across the board, and the result is something that feels new.

Activision Blizzard boss Bobby Kotick has said he would be open to quitting his role at the head of the company if the firm&#x27;s ongoing issues cannot be solved &quot;with speed&quot;.
Kotick&#x27;s comments came during a meeting with Activision Blizzard executives late last week, the Wall St Journal reports. Kotick was involved with more than one management meeting last week and was told in no uncertain terms that some employees of the company would only be satisfied when he left. Last week saw walkouts at the firm.

                    <span>&quot;The less that&#x27;s said about the Switch version, the better&quot;.
It&#x27;s fair to say that the launch of Grant Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition has been problematic, and a relatively rare example of Rockstar Games (and developer of the remaster Grove Street Games) being hit with extensive criticism. The visual style, performance and bugs have all been areas that have underwhelmed, and the Switch version is arguably among the worst of the ports.
A week after its launch Rockstar apologised for the release and confirmed there&#x27;d be a roadmap of patches and updates to improve GTA Trilogy; the first update rolled out shortly after. It&#x27;s only an initial (and likely rushed) patch, though, and the feeling is there&#x27;s still a long way to go.

                    <span>A hugely revealing look by &quot;Critical Kate&quot; Willært.
With Metroid Dread arriving to much acclaim in October, and by Nintendo&#x27;s own description bringing an end to the original saga of the series, plenty of eager fans have been poring over the lore and detail of the franchise. A recent video by &quot;Critical Kate&quot; Willært (above) gives a fascinating and detailed look at the potential influences and sources of inspiration for Metroid, in particular the earlier entries in the series.
Some are familiar references, such as the oft-repeated influence of Alien, but Willært dives far deeper and looks at media of varying kinds. There are fascinating potential ties between early work from the Stamper brothers (who founded Rareware) and design ideas in the original Metroid. We&#x27;re shown potential visual ideas that influenced other games, that in turn may have provided a basis for Nintendo&#x27;s ideas.

                    <span>Black Friday deals ahoy!
My Nintendo Store UK&#x27;s Black Friday 2021 offers are now live, with a host of deals and discounts on Switch hardware bundles, physical Switch games, Switch accessories and Pokémon merchandise. Gotta love a Snorlax mug!
The headline deal is a standard Neon Blue/Red Switch bundle which includes a download code for Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and a 3-month subscription to Nintendo Switch Online for £259.99. That works out as a saving of £56.98, if you bought the items individually at their normal price. There are various other hardware bundles which add another game and a Switch carry case for an extra £50 (including the recently-released Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl and Super Mario 3D World + Bowser&#x27;s Fury).

                    <span>And Nintendo gets plenty of screen-time, too.
&quot;I&#x27;m not alone in this attempt to destroy the nostalgic memories of middle-aged men,&quot; quips Robert &quot;Rab&quot; Florence as he introduces the presenting team that fronts E4&#x27;s GamesMaster reboot. It&#x27;s the first of many lines from the Scotsman that will raise a wry smile during the subsequent 45 minutes, but it hints at the tremendous difficulty this new venture has; the original GamesMaster, hosted by the legendary Dominik Diamond, was as close as you could get to being a semi-religious experience for many gamers in their mid-30s, so it&#x27;s easy to see why Florence has reason to poke fun at the reboot&#x27;s chances of pleasing those same veteran players. It turns out that he needn&#x27;t have been so pessimistic – at least, that&#x27;s our opinion, based on the entertaining opening episode.
While this new GamesMaster comes from a different production team and retains little in the way of connective tissue with the original run (with one exception, which we&#x27;ll come to shortly), it&#x27;s striking how well the tone is struck. Florence deserves the most praise here; a self-confessed fan of the Diamond-led series, he effortlessly slides into the role that his fellow countryman made his own all those years ago, injecting just the right amount of playful humour while allowing his equally likeable co-hosts – Frankie Ward and Ty Logan – room to establish their own identities within the show.

                    <span>The second biggest boxed launch of the year.
The UK physical chart data is now in for the week ending 20th November, and you get one guess for the biggest arrival(s).
Yep, Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl have gone straight in at number 1 and 2 in the UK charts, and the bundle pack of both is even in the top 10. GamesIndustry.biz has a couple of interesting details about the scale of the initial sales, too - Brilliant Diamond alone is the biggest Switch game launch of the year, and combined the games are the second biggest UK launch of the year across all platforms, only behind FIFA 22. Compared to other &#x27;mainline&#x27; Pokemon releases on Switch the new titles are down 26% on Sword &amp; Shield, but up 13% over Pokémon: Let&#x27;s Go, Pikachu! or Let&#x27;s Go, Eevee!.

In a new “Year 2” trailer, IO producer Hakan Abrak has teased some fresh additions coming in 2022, from new modes to PC-specific upgrades like ray tracing and VR support.

                    <span>It&#x27;s that time of year again, folks. It&#x27;s the week in November when the sky grows dark, the ground trembles underfoot, and wallets are busted open in the never-ending search for the biggest and best Black Friday deals. You will likely be seeing a lot of these deals posts appearing on RPS over the coming week, but I promise you this one&#x27;s properly good - because it&#x27;s us that&#x27;s on sale rather than a fancy mouse, keyboard or headset.  
From now until November 30th, yearly subscriptions to RPS are 35% off for new subscribers - and all you need to do is head over to our sign up page to get started. No codes or secret password at the Treehouse door required.

                    <span>Rockstar have apologised for &quot;the unexpected technical issues&quot; in Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - Definitive Edition, saying the remastered versions of GTA 3, Vice City, and San Andreas did not launch in a state with meets their standards of quality. Probably shouldn&#x27;t have released them in that state, then. They say they plan to improve them, and did release a bug-fixing patch over the weekend. They will also put the original versions back on sale, and will give them to people who buy the remastered trilogy.

                    <span>The first season of Game Informer’s Video Gameography explores the history of the Metroid series. We&#x27;re knee-deep in the Prime era now, and we&#x27;re tackling Samus&#x27; sophomore 3D outing, Metroid Prime 2: Echoes. 
This sequel to the acclaimed Metroid Prime was released November 15, 2004 in the U.S. and upped the ante with Zelda-style dark world/light world exploration. Players traverse two versions of a labyrinthine map, solving puzzles that opened paths in the opposite dimension and enduring the damaging effects of the dark world. Samus faces off against Dark Samus for the first time, one of a series of challenging boss encounters that cemented Echoes as the most challenging entry in the Prime series – for better or worse. 
Join hosts Ben Reeves (@BenjaminReeves), Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), and Nintendo Ambassadors/Metroid fanatics Ky and Kyle Parker (@CaptDangerous64, @admiralboogaloo) for the next hour as we explore Metroid Prime 2&#x27;s lore, development history, and lasting impact.

                    <span>Last year’s The Game Awards show was the biggest yet in terms of viewership. Growing more than 84 percent year-over-year to the tune of a staggering 83 million livestream views, The Game Awards has become one of the video game industry’s biggest events. But we aren’t just tuning in to find out which title will be crowned Game of the Year; we are also there for the World Premieres, which shine the spotlight on new games we’ll be playing in the years ahead. Some publishers save their biggest surprises for The Game Awards, a show that almost didn’t exist.
For a decade, Keighley was the producer and host of Spike TV’s Video Game Awards, a show that started strong in the early 2000s, but fizzled out in 2013 due to poor viewership numbers and criticism over the show’s format. For the 2014 show, …</span>

                    <span>Radiohead&#x27;s surprising collaboration with Epic Games is out now. The Kid A Mnesia Exhibition is a virtual environment designed to accompany and celebrate Radiohead&#x27;s classic Kid A and Amnesiac albums. It&#x27;s an odd project, but it&#x27;s one that makes sense for a band that are often experimental and technologically progressive.

Then they&#x27;ve also made items and costumes available for Rocket League, Fall Guys and Fortnite, turning Radiohead into just another brand to be engaged with in Epic&#x27;s dull metaversal future.

Starting tonight at 7 p.m. Pacific and running until 7 a.m. Pacific on November 22, PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 owners will have the opportunity to go hands-on with eight characters out of the final roster of 39 that will be available at launch. The primary function of this beta will be to test out the online multiplayer before the game releases in a couple of months. For the first time ever, KOF will feature rollback netcode from day one in an effort to improve the general online experience when connecting to individuals over a long distance.

                    <span>Having released half of the game earlier this week (albeit in beta), 343 Industries has announced Halo Infinite is ready to make preparations for release in a few weeks.
#HaloInfinite has officially gone gold!

November 19, 2021
In a tweet this afternoon on the Halo account, the message sent was very clear, saying, &quot;#HaloInfinite has officially gone gold! We&#x27;ll see you on December 8, Spartans.&quot; The tweet was followed by a map of release times for regions across the world. Well, specifically when the campaign releases.
Forgoing the typical midnight release, Halo Infinite&#x27;s single-player campaign will see the light of day (literally), landing at 10 a.m. Pacific on December 8. Other release times for various time zones can be seen below, although note that New York should say EST and has not moved into the Central time zone.
Of course, if you want to play Halo Infinite right now, you can! The multiplayer section of the game is available right now on Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC, and is free to play. After a somewhat surprise launch on Monday as part of Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox 20th anniversary celebration, 343 Industries unleashed an open beta of Halo Infinite on the gaming public.
We discuss our time with the multiplayer beta on this week&#x27;s Game Informer Show, but that&#x27;s not all! Halo Infinite is gracing the current cover of Game Informer, where we have pages upon pages of information about the game. It&#x27;s technically also the first place Halo Infinite went gold. Game Informer Gold, that is. Check out that incredible ultra-rare print variant here. Also, check out the trifecta of New Gameplay Today videos released today, showing off that now-golden campaign.</span>

                    <span>Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl are out now. However, if you listened to episode two of All Things Nintendo, we already extensively covered what these remakes bring to the table. Instead of retreading old ground, this episode shifts the focus to the Pokémon series&#x27; long-standing tradition of bringing remade versions of its older games to modern platforms. Host Brian Shea invites fellow Game Informer editor John Carson back to retrace the history of Pokémon remakes before getting some final thoughts on Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl.

                    <span>Double Fine Productions, the developer behind the Psychonauts series, Broken Age, and many more, recently celebrated its 20th anniversary. To celebrate this milestone, Double Fine partnered with Indie By Design to release a comprehensive art book that details the visual history of every single game the developer has released over the years – including insights from developers, in-depth interviews, and never-before-seen concept art. 
Read down below for an exclusive excerpt from the book, titled 20 Double Fine Years, giving a brief look at the design decisions behind Psychonauts 2&#x27;s Aquato family and the game&#x27;s many, many brains. We&#x27;ve also collected a handful of pages so you can see how the entire book is laid out.

                    <span>A week after Rockstar Games released Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition, the company is returning the original versions of those games to PC.
The PC versions of GTA III, Vice City, and San Andreas were removed from digital storefronts in preparation for the remastered editions. However, poor reception from consumers has spurred Rockstar to make the originals available through the Rockstar Store.
In an announcement on its website, the developer explained the decision saying, &quot;The updated versions of these classic games did not launch in a state that meets our own standards of quality, or the standards our fans have come to expect.&quot; Owners of the PC edition of the remaster through the Rockstar Store are being taken care of. Rockstar says, &quot;We will be adding the classic PC versions of Grand Theft Auto III, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, and Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas back to the Rockstar Store shortly as a bundle. Additionally, everyone who has purchased Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition for PC from the Rockstar Store through June 30, 2022, will receive these classic versions in their Rockstar Games Launcher library at no additional cost.&quot;
While this make-good takes care of specific PC gamers, there&#x27;s no word on those who own the package on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, or other PC storefronts. Rockstar does say it&#x27;s committed to fixing the issues with GTA: The Trilogy stating, &quot;We have ongoing plans to address the technical issues and to improve each game going forward,&quot; and, &quot;A new Title Update is on the way in the coming days for all versions of Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition that will address a number of issues.&quot;
Last week on Twitch, Andrew Reiner and I explored GTA: The Trilogy for a few hours, and while I had a pretty good time waxing nostalgic with the series, I was fairly put off by some of the graphical changes. Especially the sheets of nightmarish rain plaguing Grand Theft Auto III.</span>

Originally released in 2006, Pokémon Diamond and Pearl ushered in a new generation of Pokémon games onto the Nintendo DS. With the themes of evolution and creation woven throughout the story, the upgraded designs of the new Pokémon found throughout the Sinnoh region, as well as newly discovered evolutionary lines of fan-favorite monsters, these games felt like a notable step forward for the franchise. In remaking these classics new Pokémon developer ILCA proves it can handle recreating the crucial tenants of the franchise.

                    <span>Star Citizen, the ever-in-development interstellar flight sim about piloting impressive spaceships you can buy with your real hard-earned money, is holding the Intergalactic Aerospace Expo 2951 (IAE 2951) from today until December 1. 
Typically, to get yourself behind the yoke of a space cruiser in Star Citizen, you&#x27;d have to cough up at least $45 for access to one of the game&#x27;s more basic ships. However, like a real-life car show (or a trip to almost any vehicle dealership), IAE 2951 will let intrepid pilots test out over 120 different flyable ships from various fictional manufacturers. Each day of the event will shift focus to specific ship companies and their wares.

While not the first Museum style collection (it&#x27;s a follow-up to 2014&#x27;s Pac-Man Museum), this newest iteration includes popular modern titles such as Pac-Man Championship Edition and Pac-Man 256 and oddities like the Wii-exclusive Pac-Motos. The full list of titles is as follows:
Pac-Man
Super Pac-Man
Pac &amp; Pal
Pac-Land
Pac-Mania
Pac-Attack
Pac-In-Time
Pac-Man Arrangement (Arcade Version)
Pac-Man Arrangement (Console Version)
Pac-Man Championship Edition
Pac-Motos
Pac ‘N Roll Remix
Pac-Man Battle Royale
Pac-Man 256
To access each game, you’ll explore an actual arcade as Pac-Man himself, which is pretty meta. This arcade can be customized to your liking Animal Crossing-style by purchasing decor using coins earned by completing in-game missions. 
Pac-Man Museum + gobbles its way to Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC in early 2022.</span>

Battlefield has always been the largest and loudest multiplayer experience in the business. It’s the video game equivalent of Texas, and its bombast cannot be overstated. Battlefield 2042 offers a variety of ways to participate in simulated near-future warfare. Whether you prefer to fight via land or sky, you can experience dizzying on-screen explosions, tense firefights, and more vehicles than teammates who know how to drive them. Unfortunately, Battlefield 2042 is full of almost as many bugs as bad pilots, dragging down an otherwise solid online shooter.

                    <span>Black Friday is a time of excess, kicking off a season of even more excess. In that spirit, I’ve been thinking about buying four more of my current monitor and lashing them together into a makeshift array using rope fashioned from my corgi’s shed hair. There’s no way that I could achieve such an impressive display in any other way, certainly not with a single monitor. At least that’s what I thought, until hardware ed James reminded me that the humongous Samsung Odyssey G9 exists.

                    <span>Chums, I have a confession to make. For someone writing about Black Friday PC hardware deals, I don’t know all that much about PC hardware. Oh, I’ve been building my own PCs for 20-odd years, I just sort of ran out of storage in my brain around 2011 and now I have to spend ages reading up on the latest developments every time I need to buy a new component. If only I could just slot one of these Samsung 980 Pro SSDs into my brain, I would no longer have that problem.

                    <span>The holiday season, heralded by Black Friday, is often a time for reminiscing about the past. For instance, I remember a time, a few years either side of 2000/Y2K/The Willenium, when really big pockets were a thing. Particularly if you were a bit nu-metal or a bit goth. They were great. There’s nothing like walking down the street with your Gameboy banging against your knee. Sadly, as technology shrank faster and faster, so did trousers, until everyone was stuck with skinny jeans that you can’t even squeeze a bit of change into. It’s especially frustrating as I reckon you could happily fit the lovely Logitech G915 TKL Lightspeed Wireless into one of those big pockets.

                    <span>While New World seems mostly to be occupied in a war against exploits like duping, forever firing off fixes or disabling features, this week brings an update focused on adding newness. That&#x27;s nice. The &#x27;Into The Void&#x27; update introduces the magical new Void Gauntlet, a weapon which can be used to heal or harm. You can perform violence upon new enemies too, because various Varangian forces have arrived to plunder the island.

                    <span>There&#x27;s no time to explain: the Intel Core i5-12600K has a Black Friday deal. I mean that&#x27;s weird, right? It only came out scant weeks ago and it&#x27;s already on the sharp end of a meaningful discount. Not that I&#x27;m complaining, mind, as this Intel 12th Gen Alder Lake mid-ranger proved itself the best CPU for gaming immediately upon arrival.

                    <span>Slipping into a military-controlled ‘dark zone’ to plunder some high-end electrical equipment sounded like an easy job. You could be in and out in minutes, in theory, slinking through the locked-down multi-storey car park with a nice sequence of slides and skids to grab your treasure before vaulting a fence and scampering off. But there’s a problem: the lights are out, down in these concrete depths. The zombies are strong here. Special banshee-like screechers are primed to alert their undead brethren to the presence of any would-be intruders, prompting an unending wave of decaying meat to fling itself at you, all teeth and claws.


So this mission requires more finesse. You need to use all that agility and poise you’ve mastered in Dying Light 2’s impressive parkour &#x27;n&#x27; puching open-world city, sure, but you also need to layer more skills on top of that, cherry-picked from the new toolkit Techland has provided.

                    <span>For all the loathsome talk of the metaverse from companies like Facebook and Epic as the future of reality, many facets of the concept already exist in sandboxes like Roblox. The problem with Roblox for them is that it&#x27;s a lawless frontier town, one they don&#x27;t control. Still, Roblox is obscenely popular, so it&#x27;s popular with brands who don&#x27;t need control, they just want to advertise products. Enter Nikeland, an official Roblox game from the cobblers at Nike.

                    <span>I’ve spent some more time with FPS Battlefield 2042, having freed myself from EA’s vice grip. And it’s safe to say the fields of battle have taken on a vastly different complexion now it’s largely in the hands of many more players. Compared to my three-night imprisonment alongside other journos and influencers, my feelings have definitely levelled out.
The honeymoon period is over, basically. My relationship with the game in the real world, outside of EAs strict boundaries has lessened. I’m sorry to say it, but we’ve grown apart. Things are average between us, and perhaps only Portal, the game’s custom mode creator, can salvage things.

                    <span>Arkane&#x27;s sneak-o-shooter Deathloop is a good game, but maybe not quite as stealthy as you might expect from the studio behind Dishonored. Even our Deathloop review said &quot;stealth is just the thing that goes wrong before a good fight&quot;. Well, you might want to be a bit sneakier now, as the game&#x27;s second major update has arrived and it makes NPCs a fair bit smarter. The patch addresses some common complaints about the PvP Invasion mode too.

There are savings of up to £250 to be had here across all of their Vive headsets, including the full Vive Cosmos and Cosmos Elite kits, and their eye-tracking Vive Pro Eye.

                    <span>Within 60 seconds I was dead and laughing. Halo Infinite&#x27;s multiplayer is a finely tuned mechanism for delivering explosions and dopamine. Developers 343 Industries did whatever the opposite of a jumpscare is this week, delighting deathmatch dilly-dalliers with a surprise release of their classical arena shooter. It&#x27;s a beta, they insist. But we all know it&#x27;s the proper game because they&#x27;ve had their betas already (excuse me, &quot;flights&quot;). 
Also, look, this thing is impeccable. Clean, powerful shots trace across immaculate skyboxes, straight into the shining dome of your armoured clunkperson, with a frightening thud that is satisfying even in death. There are problems, of course, but most reside outside the actual shootouts, which are frenetic, zappy confrontations longtime Halo players will savour.

                    <span>During Battlefield 2042&#x27;s week of early access for people who paid extra, players were more forgiving of bugs and wonk with the expectation that it would be fixed by a launch patch. Well, the game is out today, the launch patch has hit, and the game is still in a bit of a state. 78% of the 5500-odd player reviews on Steam are negative right now, with many complaining about crashes, poor performance, and more. Dice have said they plan to launch two patches in the next month.

                    <span>Back when Black Friday was only just revving up its deals engines, I asked you – the lovely RPS readership – to tell us about your hardware. And it turns out that just like in 2019, your collective favourite gaming mouse is the Logitech G502. Truly, a timeless classic of clicks and scrolls.


Of course, the G502 has come in a few different flavours, but you can now get one of the most recent models at the lowest price it’s ever been (at least in the UK). Amazon has the Logitech G502 SE Hero for £34: an entire pound less than the standard G502 Hero has ever dipped to, most recently during Prime Day 2021. 


US denizens aren’t missing out either, as the G502 SE Hero is $33 at Best Buy in their own Black Friday sale. That’s not quite as cheap as its all-time low of $28, but its still a very good price on a very good mouse. The G502 SE Hero is essentially the classic G502 Hero with some white go-faster stripes – there’s been no funny business making adverse changes to keep the costs down.

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(2 min)</span>
                    <span>Thymesia is an upcoming action-adventure game that puts you in the shoes of the world&#x27;s toughest plague doctor who uses diseases-turned-weapons to battle enemies. The fast-paced action RPG sports heavy Dark Souls vibes and was slated to launch on December 7. Unfortunately, that will no longer be the case because Thymesia is now arriving sometime in 2022.
Developer OverBorder Studio states it wants to make sure Thymesia is razor-sharp for its big debut, so it&#x27;s leaving it in the oven for a while longer. On the bright side, it announced the game is headed to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S after only confirming PC in the past.
Thymesia stars Corvus, a plague doctor who’s half-man, half-raven. He’s on a mission to regain his lost memories while also slaying abominations lurking within his gloomy kingdom. Combat is fast-paced and punishing, emphasizing aggression and mobility thanks to a swift dodge maneuver. Corvus can extract diseases from foes, then transform them into weapons such as a scythe or sword. He can also utilize his raven form to unleash dagger-like feathers. You can mold Corvus to your liking thanks to multiple character builds, as well as different endings to encourage replayability. Check out the original announcement trailer below.

                    <span>Following Sony Interactive Entertainment’s purchase of Evolution Championship Series, more commonly known as EVO, Smash Bros. fans were left wondering what could come of the usual Smash Bros. tournaments featured at the annual EVO showcases. The global COVID-19 pandemic threw its own wrench in EVO’s in-person showcases, but it seems Nintendo is ready to officially support the Smash tournament scene. 
“Confirmed. Ready your A-game, Super Smash Bros competitors. We’ve partnered with Panda Global to launch the first officially licenses Super Smash Bros. championship circuit in North America, coming 2022.”

November 18, 2021
As you can see in the tweet above, Nintendo has partnered with Panda Global to bring “the first officially licensed circuit for Super Smash Bros. Ultimate and Super Smash Bros. Melee to North America.” This is especially unprecedented as Nintendo has often remained quite mum on support for the Melee tournament scene. 
It’s unclear exactly what these tournaments will look like – we’ll find out next year – but Panda says they’ll feature cash prizes. 
While waiting for more information, read about Sony’s purchase of EVO and then check out this story about the final fighter in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. Read about Masahiro Sakurai’s journey to get Sora added to the game after that.

                    <span>Few genres provide the simple pleasure of a good old-fashioned beat ‘em up. After all, these arcade-style games let you and your buddies punch and kick dozens of often colorful enemies in the face. What’s not to love? Double-teaming mobs of enemies or a sturdy boss strengthens bonds. Conversely, repeatedly grabbing health pick-ups “on accident” with a full health bar while your friend hangs on by a thread can reveal cracks in a relationship. Whatever side of the fence you’re on, we’ve all likely played these sorts of games, and the last decade has seen modernized takes on the winning formula. Here are 10 of the best contemporary beat ‘em ups (in no particular order) that you can play right now. No quarters necessary.

                    <span>Sifu, the upcoming Kung Fu action game from developer Sloclap, has moved its release date by exactly two weeks. 
After it was delayed to 2022, we learned that its release date was February 22. Now, Sifu will launch on February 8 in a rare move that sees it coming earlier than expected. To accompany the news, Sloclap has released a new trailer showcasing more of the bone-breaking combat featured in Sifu, which you can watch below:

The studio also released additional information about the combat and progression featured within Sifu.

                    <span>After announcing yesterday that the team is looking into Battle Pass progression in Halo Infinite’s free-to-play multiplayer, which surprise dropped on Monday, 343 Industries has detailed some of the changes we can expect to go live later this week. 
While still technically in beta, players have criticized the Battle Pass progression featured within Halo Infinite’s multiplayer. More specifically, players have lamented how leveling up works. Right now, you only earn experience by completing specific weekly and daily challenges. These aren’t necessarily difficult to complete, but if you play a match without completing one, you essentially get nothing for the time spent in that match.

                    <span>Tencent has acquired a minority stake in Playtonic, the developer behind Yooka-Laylee and its 2D sequel, Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair. 
This news comes by way of Playtonic, which announced the news in a blog post made today. The studio says it will retain “full creative control over its IP” and will use Tencent’s investment funding to scale from its current structure to a bigger one.

“Playtonic...will use the investment to scale from their current one team structure to multiple teams, with an emphasis on hiring diverse talent from near and afar, improving their HQ, as well as looking to expand in new locations,” Playtonic’s blog post reads. 
Playtonic founder Gavin Price says Tencent’s investment will help the studio scale-up and fast-track the “super-exciting, super-secret projects we’ve been keeping close to our treasure chests.” The expansion of the studio has already begun, too, with Playtonic hiring Danny Spiteri, formerly of Raw Fury and Team 17, as its new Head of Publishing.

Ahead of the release of Resident Evil: Welcome To Raccoon City next week, we have an exclusive new featurette that briefly dives into the relationship between the movie&#x27;s production team and the video game series&#x27; development team at Capcom. Check it out in full above. 
One fun tidbit detailed in the trailer is director Johannes Roberts sneaking in nods to his favorite games in the series: 
&quot;Director Johannes [Roberts] really loves the games, so there are a lot of Easter eggs in the movie,&quot; Capcom producer Hiroyuki Kobayashi says in the video. &quot;One of my personal favorites is, though the movie is based on games 1 and 2, director Johannes snuck in some of his favorite elements from a later game. Hope you can find it.&quot; 
For more on Welcome To Raccoon City, check our interview with two of the film&#x27;s leads, Tom Hopper and Avan Jogia, who play Albert Wesker and Leon Kennedy, respectively, where we talk about co-leading this new Resident Evil film series, their favorite moments from filming, and where they found inspiration for their characters. 
Resident Evil: Welcome To Raccoon City will be released in theaters on November 24, 2021.</span>

Resident Evil: Welcome To Raccoon City will be released in theaters next week on November 24. It&#x27;s perhaps one of the more interesting video game movies ever released. Not narratively or stylistically, but rather in the shoes it has to fill. Welcome To Raccoon City is a complete reimagining of the Resident Evil world for the big screen, coming off the heels of Paul W.S. Anderson&#x27;s Resident Evil film series, which ran for six movies, netting more than a billion dollars in box office revenue. 
Where Anderson took the Resident Evil source material and made his own science fiction universe, Welcome To Raccoon City – directed by Johannes Roberts (47 Meters Down, The Strangers: Prey At Night) – sticks far closer to the first two games in the series. It results in a far more grounded story, focusing on characters fans have known for decades. 
Ahead of the movie&#x27;s release next week, we sat down with two of its stars, Tom Hopper and Avan Jogia, who play Albert Wesker and Leon Kennedy, respectively, to talk about co-leading this new Resident Evil film series, their favorite moments from filming, and where they found inspiration for their characters. 
Resident Evil: Welcome To Raccoon City will be released in theaters on November 24, 2021.</span>

                    <span>Loop Hero ranks among the year’s best PC exclusives, and we found out it was making its move to consoles, namely Switch, during August’s Nintendo Indie World Showcase. If you’ve been waiting to try your hand at the looping adventure or simply want to take it on the go, December 9 is the date to look out for.
For those unfamiliar with Loop Hero, it has a unique premise. To save the world from destruction, a hero roams a looping track filled with monsters and other hazards. However, you don’t control your hero directly; instead, you create the world in which he’ll explore. By strategically placing a variety of creatures, terrain types, and obstacles, your auto-moving hero grows stronger with every baddie slain. The key is to throw just enough at the hero to increase its strength without accidentally overwhelming them and causing their demise. In between runs, you&#x27;ll build up a settlement with different shops to unlock equipment and buffs to increase your odds for the next loop.

Loop Hero is one of those titles best played yourself to truly understand its hooks. In our review of the PC version, we scored the game an 8.5 out of 10. Reviewer Dan Tack noted that “Loop Hero is a creative and clever little game that should be on your radar if you enjoy strategy, RPGs, deckbuilders, roguelikes, or all of the above. While its novelty begins to wither the further you get away from your opening hours, the journey is worthwhile and engaging.”
Loop Hero is priced at $14.99 but you can pre-order it on the eShop now for a 10% discount ($13.49).</span>

                    <span>Publisher: 2K Games
		
Developer: Visual Concepts
		

WWE fans know that the company has been in a chaotic state as of late. Dozens of roster cuts this year have not only put fans on edge about the long-term fates of their favorite Superstars, but they&#x27;ve also brought into question the status of WWE 2K22. It&#x27;s the first wrestling sim since 2019&#x27;s ill-received 2K20, and the game is forgoing the series&#x27; usual fall release window for a March 2022 launch. That extra time seemingly gives Visual Concepts time to polish up a few holds, so what can fans expect? While Visual Concepts is still withholding most information until its previously announced January unveiling, it did provide a sneak peek into the features and improvements its concocted so far.

                    <span>Victura and Highwire Games have announced that Six Days in Fallujah, a controversial shooter based on the real-life Battle of Fallujah that occurred during the Iraq War, has been delayed to 2022. 
More specifically, the shooter has been delayed to Q4 of 2022, citing that the team behind it needs more people to hit the level of quality the studio is striving for. It also requires more capital and time, hence the delay. 
“It became clear that recreating these true stories at a high quality was going to require more people, capital, and time than we had,” Victura CEO Peter Tamte said in the delay announcement. “Doubling our team is just one of the many things we’re doing to make sure Six Days in Fallujah brings new kinds of tactical and emotional depth to military shooters.” 
Atomic Games attempted to release a game set during the Battle of Fallujah way back in 2009. However, the project was rightfully criticized for the developer’s decision to alongside the CIA to publish the game, with many calling it propaganda. Ultimately, Atomic Games’ project was re-revealed back in February with news that Victura and Highwire Games were helming the Fallujah-centric game instead. 
The studio said around the announcement that the team had spent over three years building unique technology to overhaul the game and its mechanics. It also revealed that it hopes to go beyond simply presenting another shooter and instead show the realities of war and its consequences. However, the re-reveal was criticized much in the same way the first attempt at this game was. 
Only time will tell what the final product turns out to be, but now we know it’s not coming until at least Q4 of next year. 
While waiting for that, check out Game Informer’s coverage of the original 2009 reveal and then read about the Six Days in Fallujah revival after that.</span>

Perhaps one of the year’s worst-kept secrets, MultiVersus had been heavily rumored as of late, with apparent leaks appearing on social media and elsewhere. However, today’s announcement makes it official: you’ll finally be able to destroy Batman by throwing Jerry at him while playing as Tom (dreams really do come true).

                    <span>Capcom’s upcoming sci-fi title, Pragmata, has been delayed to 2023. 
Pragmata was first announced during the PlayStation 5 reveal event way back in June 2020. It featured an astronaut walking through New York who stumbles upon a little girl. A strange glitch-in-the-matrix happens and all of a sudden, a satellite crashes through the sky and then the duo ends up in space after using some weird 3D printer-like device. It’s as strange as it sounds, as you can see from the Pragmata announcement trailer. 
However, when it was first revealed, Capcom said the game would release in 2022. Now, it’s been delayed to 2023, which isn’t all that surprising considering that 2020 look at the title was the last we heard about Pragmata. 
An update on #PRAGMATA:

As you can see in the tweet above, Capcom released a new video alongside news of this delay. It features Pragmata’s young heroine holding a piece of paper with “2022” scratched out and “2023” written beside it. The company also released new artwork, which you can see below:

                    <span>Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit has received a new 2.0 update, and it brings split-screen multiplayer, a new four-player Relay Race mode, additional tracks, and more customization to the racer. 
This update was revealed on Nintendo’s YouTube yesterday in a new video showcasing all you can expect in 2.0. In it, Nintendo reveals the new split-screen multiplayer mode coming to Mario Kart Live, which is the company’s toys-to-life-esque kart racer that tasks players with building a track in their own house and then racing a real Mario Kart RC car around it.

The new Split-Screen mode is exactly what you’d expect in a Mario Kart game: place two karts onto the track, round up two controllers, and race your friend or foe on-screen. It looks pretty identical to a standard Mario Kart split-screen mode, except it’s your living room on the screen rather than Bowser’s Castle. 
If two players aren’t enough, you can bring in two more thanks to Mario Kart Live’s new Relay Race mode. In this mode, two players will be on one kart, and they can swap control of the wheel back and forth, meaning up to four people can play at once. Three new courses have been added: Windmill Meadows, Music Broadway, and King Boo’s Courtyard. Plus, Luigi’s Poltergust is now a customization item available for use alongside the Spooky Horn. You must complete the Luigi Cup under certain conditions in the Grand Prix to unlock them, though.
If you haven’t yet checked out Mario Kart Live, be sure to read Game Informer’s Mario Kart Live review and then check out this New Gameplay Today featuring some Game Informer editors playing Mario Kart Live.

                    <span>I had my first eggnog latte of the year yesterday, which means that like Black Friday, the actual holiday season is officially upon us. I’m sorry, I don’t make the rules. For many of us, me included, that means stuffing our faces with delicious treats like we’re in training for Fat Bear Week. What&#x27;s your favourite? Mine&#x27;s the 
lebkuchen hearts with apricot filling, plus anything with marzipan.
The point I’m trying to get to is that this isn’t really a slim and sexy time of year for me. More of a fat and cuddly (but still sexy) season. On the other hand, this Alienware m15 R4 gaming laptop is both slim and sexy, as well as a full $500 off in Dell&#x27;s early Black Friday sales.

                    <span>It&#x27;s been a few weeks since I came down on the side of basically liking Age Of Empires 4. Lukewarm praise, perhaps, but it seems to be doing well, and that makes me glad. We&#x27;ve needed an RTS revival for ages, right? And this one is good, if a bit safe.
For the last few weeks I&#x27;ve been puzzling over the lingering feeling that it could have been more ambitious. Why do I think it could have pushed the trireme out further? Is it possible to make a modern RTS that captures the best of the classics without simply rehashing them? Has it even been done already and gone unrecognised?

They say the company need a new CEO &quot;with the expertise, skill set and conviction to truly change the company&#x27;s culture&quot;.

                    <span>At long last, we have a date for Minecraft&#x27;s Caves &amp; Cliffs Part 2 update. On November 30th, Mojang will give the game&#x27;s mountains and caves a makeover, adding new sub-biomes and letting folks explore deeper than before. I&#x27;m very much looking forward to the new Lush Cave biomes, which are gonna be full of vines, moss and pretty blossoms. I reckon that would make a lovely location for an underground home.

                    <span>Warner Bros. today announced a Smash Bros-style platformer fighter of their own, throwing characters from across their many series and franchises into one big rumble. In MultiVersus, you can expect to see Shaggy from Scooby Doo teaming up with Steven Universe to battle actual killers like Harley Quinn and Arya Stark, and more. It&#x27;s due to launch in 2022, and will be free-to-play. Check out the trailer below.

                    <span>I can&#x27;t remember why I picked this theme, but for this episode of The Electronic Wireless Show podcast I wanted to talk about AI characters - as in, characters that are, in game, an artificial intelligence of some kind. This definition does cause some trouble. After all, is not every character in a game that isn&#x27;t player controlled an AI character, fn fn fn?
No, because you all know what I mean and so does Nate. Matthew doesn&#x27;t, know, and had prepared a list of just, companion characters. Don&#x27;t worry, he actually pulls out some really good examples. We talk about a lot of games this week, not least because I didn&#x27;t prepare a Cavern Of Lies again. Sorry. There is also a lot of talk about clones, and what Matthew would do with clones of himself (e.g. shove them out of an airlock).

                    <span>Supercars are boring. That one on Forza Horizon 5’s front cover? Don’t care how fast it goes, mate. Oh, goes from 1 to 60 in 2.7 seconds does it? Yeah, well, that&#x27;s how long it takes to prepare this knuckle sandwich. No, but seriously, they’re all the same to me: just wedges of carbon fibre with wheels. I’m sure the engineering is marvelous and the innovation groundbreaking. But let’s be honest, in videogames they’re virtually all the same.
My Forza Horizon 5 fantasy doesn’t involve Lamborghinis or Ferraris. In fact, it’s the complete opposite of opulence. Mexico’s roads are for me and my mundane companions. The Volvo Estate, the Ford Focus, the Honda Civic. The everyday vehicles that make up for their lack of speed with heaps of character. I just wish there were more to choose from.

                    <span>Undungeon is a peculiar action RPG set at the end of the universe, in which you play an immortal herald called Void who has been pieced together by God themselves using a primordial stew of hot organs, conscious essence and wet rib cages. Something very complicated has happened to reality, and you’re here to fix it with your swooshing Freddy Kreuger claws and clever dialogue choices. 


I’m still not entirely sure what Undungeon is about. The characters, a cast of hovering orbs, corrupted flesh angels and crystal beings, repeatedly try to explain what’s going on, but it never quite sinks in. Collapsing dimensions are causing no end of trouble, that’s pretty clear, shattering into an infinite number of spinning shards that rain like an exotic meteor shower over a scorched wasteland inhabited by nomadic technomancers and acid-spitting scorpions. You’re sent down to the dusty mortal plane to plug everything back in again and reset the multiverse, like an interdimensional BT engineer.

                    <span>If you&#x27;ve been struggling with crashes or online stability in Forza Horizon 5, it&#x27;s probably worth updating your game. Last night, Playground Games released a patch for the new open-world race &#x27;em up, fixing a number of crashes that can occur when upgrading cars or spawning traffic, and improving stability for Horizon Life (the game&#x27;s online component). This hotfix was supposed to arrive last week, but better late than never.

Our very own Ed Thorn played for four hours, only to reach battle pass level 3 the other night. Thankfully, the developers have already detailed a handful of changes coming this week that should improve things - from adding new, easier challenges, to removing some of the rubbish weeklies players don&#x27;t like.

It&#x27;s not just its excellent ocean that I want to enjoy without pointless random murder. It&#x27;s the sailing. The thrill of moving around and operating this vehicle, hearing it creak as you turn a wheel, and whoosh as you catch the wind.
Sailwind is all about that. You sail a boat. Nobody will attack you. There are no monsters to fight, or guilds to appease. It&#x27;s just you, the sea, and the skills that will take your boat across it well enough that you don&#x27;t starve on the way.

It&#x27;s a demo Halo fans will never forget. In 2020, developer 343 Industries brought its latest take on the Halo franchise to the masses during one of Microsoft&#x27;s digital events. Halo Infinite&#x27;s gameplay debut was met with some positivity but spawned an online firestorm and popularized conversation around Craig The Brute, among other discussions. It&#x27;s been over a year since fans were shown that demo, and a lot has changed ahead of Halo Infinite&#x27;s campaign release on December 8. Before that long-awaited day, join us for a unique updated look at the campaign in all its new shining glory.
Today&#x27;s video isn&#x27;t a complete one-to-one recreation of the 2020 footage, but rather a potent illustration of how the team has improved upon that earlier foundation, including …</span>

                    <span>Update, 11/17/21:
The physical deluxe edition of Kena: Bridge of Spirits will be out this Friday. 
Detailed today in a new press release from Kena dev Ember Lab and Maximum Games, this deluxe edition of the PlayStation-exclusive game will cost $49.99. It will include a digital soundtrack, a retail exclusive physical sticker sheet, a unique digital in-game silver staff for Kena to use, a golden Rot character skin, and “unique celebration hats for the Rot.” 
Maximum Games says the deluxe edition will be sold in “popular retailers” and can be purchased directly from its website. The game will continue to be sold as a standard digital edition release for $39.99 and a digital deluxe edition for $49.99 on PSN, too.

                    <span>Released on the Nintendo DS in 2006 in Japan and 2007 everywhere else, Pokémon Diamond and Pearl started the fourth generation of games, with the third entry, Platinum, coming three years later. This introduction to the region of Sinnoh ushered in a whopping 107 new monsters for trainers to collect, befriend, and battle. 
With the Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl remakes releasing this week (here&#x27;s our review), we thought it would be fun to do a casual ranking of the top 25 Pokémon introduced in the fourth generation games.
Here are a few things to keep in mind while perusing this list: 
These rankings are based on factors ranging from power to popularity, rarity, memorability, or just because I happen to think they are neat.
Your favorites may differ, and that&#x27;s more than okay.

                    <span>343 community director Brian Jarrard took to Twitter yesterday to address something that&#x27;s getting a lot of chatter as players begin to jump into the free-to-play Halo Infinite multiplayer experience. The topic might surprise you, as it&#x27;s not about any weapon being overpowered or a map being weak but rather something else entirely. So what is all the discourse about? The battle pass, of course!
Thank you to everyone who has jumped into the #HaloInfintie beta so far! FYI the team is looking at Battle Pass progression and gathering data from yesterday&#x27;s sessions and we&#x27;ll share updates as we have them. Please continue to share feedback and raise flags as you see them. 1/3

                    <span>Eidos Montreal dropped an update for Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy today that makes the space-faring comic book adventure look and run even better. 
On PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, the game now features ray-tracing, meaning the lighting is more realistic than ever. You can activate the feature in the Video Settings menu.
On Xbox Series S, players have the option to uncap the framerate to run between 30 and 60 frames-per-second. Eidos recommends this feature to users with a VRR (variable refresh rate) display and warns that some framerates may be unstable in certain areas. 
Meanwhile, base PlayStation 4 players can enjoy an overall performance boost. Eidos even tweaked the sensitivity for the visor to register inputs from older, more worn-down controllers. 
The patch also adds the following improvement across all versions of the game:
Save Rollback: A hidden Save Rollback feature was added to allow users who have encountered blocking issues to rollback to the start of the chapter of their choice
General stability improvement on all platforms
Multiple stability improvements with Ray Tracing enabled
General improvements to objective markers
Additional improvements to world boundaries
PC players can expect the patch as early as Friday, November 19. Furthermore, Eidos has also squashed several bugs, the full list of which you can view on the developer&#x27;s Reddit post. 
For more on Marvel&#x27;s Guardians of the Galaxy, be sure to check out our full review of the game here. The title is nominated in a few categories for The Game Awards 2021.</span>

                    <span>Newcomer Luke will be the focus of Street Fighter V&#x27;s Fall Update next week, which is also being branded as the final event for the long-supported game.
In a tweet this morning on the Street Fighter Twitter account, the streaming event is set for Tuesday, November 23, and promises a gameplay showcase for Luke and a behind-the-scenes look at the character. In previous updates, Capcom has shown footage of mocap sessions, shared design insights, and music/merch collaborations, along with the gameplay breakdowns.

Luke was revealed in August to be the last addition of the Season 5 character pass and Street Fighter V as a whole, following a parade of returning favorites from Street Fighter and adjacent series Rival Schools. In the event where he was revealed, Street Fighter V&#x27;s developers described Luke as a glimpse at the future of the series. He&#x27;s dressed for a fight with MMA gear, including lightweight gloves and sponsor-laden trunks. His move set featured quick strikes and speedy, impactful projectiles, though we&#x27;ll have to see how this has changed in the time since the reveal. Hopefully, we&#x27;ll also get more hints at what to expect in an upcoming Street Fighter game.

                    <span>If you’ve ever wanted your palico or palamute in Monster Hunter Rise to look like Sonic and Tails, now’s your chance. 
That’s because Sonic and Tails are (kinda) coming to Monster Hunter Rise in a new collaboration that goes live on November 26. The official Monster Hunter Twitter account posted a one-minute video today featuring the groovy basslines you’ve come to expect from Sonic music alongside footage of palico Sonic and palamute Tails in-game. 
OH YEAH! @Sonic_Hedgehog collaboration coming in FAST!

Look, I’m not Sonic expert but I have to be honest: palico Sonic works so much better than palamute Tails. The palico actually looks like the blue dude who likes to go fast – you could convince me that’s just actually him. The palamute, however, looks like a dog that someone’s dressed up to be like Tails. I don’t know if any of this matters to players – it probably doesn’t – but if I’m going for the full gold rings experience, I’m rolling with Sonic. 
It’s cool regardless that both are in-game; it&#x27;s even cooler that the palico can seemingly turn into Super (Saiyan) Sonic too. 
As noted in the announcement video, this Monster Hunter Rise x Sonic The Hedgehog collaboration will go live on November 26. That day, an event quest will go live and it yields not just the palico and palamute armor pieces as rewards, but some Hunter armor as well. Complete this quest and your entire squad can roll out at the speed of sound in style. This collaboration will hit the PC version when it launches in January. 
While waiting for this collaboration to go live, check out Game Informer’s Monster Hunter Rise review and then read where Monster Hunter Rise ended up on this year’s Game Awards nomination list. Read about how Monster Hunter Rise won’t have cross-save or crossplay with Switch when it hits PC this coming January.

                    <span>The studio behind the Yakuza series and the Judgment series, Ryu Ga Gotoku, is working on a new franchise, but it won’t be connected to either of their beloved crime-related series. 
This news comes from Video Games Chronicle, which reports that studio director Masayoshi Yokohama told Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu that RGG is planning a new game separate from the Yakuza or Judgment series. 
“We’re also working on unannounced titled outside of [Yakuza and Judgment],” Yokoyama told Famitsu. 
If you’re worried about not getting more Yakuza as a result, though, don’t fret – RGG has already confirmed that a sequel to Yakuza: Like a Dragon is in the works, even though series creator Toshihiro Nagoshi has departed from Sega. The future of the Judgment series, however, is not so guaranteed. As noted by VGC, after an alleged dispute between Sega and lead actor Takuya Kimura’s talent agency, it’s unclear if the series even has its leading actor to rely on for the role of Takayuki Yagami. 
Yokoyama said RGG “will continue to cherish the Judgment series” when talking to Famitsu, so that’s something. Only time will tell what comes of it, but now we know a new franchise is in the works at the studio.
While waiting to learn more about it, check out Game Informer’s Lost Judgment review and then read Game Informer’s Yakuza: Like a Dragon review. Check out this story about Yakuza series creator Toshihiro Nagoshi’s departure from Sega after that.

                    <span>Saints Row graced the cover of Game Informer magazine last month and looks to be a modern reboot of the GTA-inspired and wildly/hilariously inappropriate franchise from over a decade ago. And with Deep Silver Volition developing the title, the nostalgia factor is at an all-time high. Saints Row was originally slated for a February 25 release, but a new statement from Volition chief creative officer Jim Boone weaves a different, more deflating story. Sadly, the Saints Row reboot is being delayed to summer 2022.

                    <span>If you haven’t heard, we&#x27;re in the middle of an indiepocalypse. It’s probably not the kind you’re thinking of; it doesn’t spell doom for the independent games scene. This one is a monthly compilation of games all in one conveniently packaged digital zine, from a variety of diverse creators. That Indiepocalypse. 


Indiepocalypse is composed of 10 games every month, one of which has been commissioned by Editor in Chief Andrew Baillie personally. Started in February 2020, the zine has already managed to rack up 22 issues, as well as one bonus issue. You never know what you’re going to get from one issue to the next, each one platforming small games that likely wouldn’t succeed elsewhere. There’s no exclusivity clause either, meaning developers are free to do what they want with their games outside of the zine. Most importantly, every developer included is paid. Baillie spoke to me about how and why Indiepocalypse started.

But a lot of players have one major grievance: the battle pass is a massive grind. Complaints about challenges that award very little XP are all over the game&#x27;s subreddit. Fortunately, the devs have seen this feedback, and are already looking into the slow progression.

                    <span>There’s something about Call Of Duty: Vanguard and its multiplayer modes that feels thin. Much like my time with the game’s campaign, I’m left wanting. This is a World War II veneer glossed over a Modern Warfare canvas, with familiar pacing and shooting, but ultimately lacking the weight of Infinity Ward’s reboot.
As a Call Of Duty multiplayer experience, Vanguard delivers. But what it delivers is a stop-gap. An FPS experience that isn’t concerned with pushing the series forwards, or taking risks. Fans will have fun, sure, but its deathmatches and dominations are stuck in the past. Not to mention Zombies, which is too eager to turn back the clock.

                    <span>Over 150 Activision Blizzard employees held a walkout yesterday demanding the removal of CEO Bobby Kotick, after a new report unearthed more allegations of sexual harassment and misconduct. The Wall Street Journal even claim that Kotick himself had allegedly threatened to have someone killed. This is the second walkout workers have held this year following the first lawsuit that made allegations of widespread discrimination and harassment.

                    <span>Less than three months after announcing the reboot Saints Row, the makers have announced they&#x27;re delaying its launch by six months. Previously due on February 25th, 2022, it&#x27;s now due on August 23rd. It&#x27;s the usual sensible reason: the pandemic has messed with anyone attempting to do anything, and they want more time to make it good. Please do!

                    <span>New World, Amazon Games&#x27; opening move into game dev, was not always an MMORPG. It used to be a survival horror game. According to Katy Kaszynski, senior producer at Amazon Games, the team got really far down that road. &quot;They created it. That was before my time, but that game was almost done,&quot; Kaszynski tells me, just after delivering a presentation on New World&#x27;s development at this year&#x27;s Develop Conference in Brighton. &quot;They really thought it was going to go alpha, launch, and they were going to ship that out.&quot;
A survival horror is pretty different from the jaunty, vaguely piratical, magical fantasy RPG that New World is today: lush forests, sunny grassy plains, and factions engaged in an endless war for territory. So what happened? According to Kaszynski, it&#x27;s all down to Amazon&#x27;s first &#x27;Leadership Principle&#x27;: Customer Obsession.

The report also highlights several instances where Activision CEO Bobby Kotick was reportedly aware of the allegations but did not inform the company&#x27;s board of directors and, in one instance, intervened to prevent an alleged harasser from being fired.

In response to the report, employee group A Better ABK have called for Kotick to be replaced as CEO and are organising a staff walkout.

At first we got ports years after their Xbox debut, then Microsoft just stopped releasing Windows versions for their flagship first-person shooter series. Well, that&#x27;s changing with Halo Infinite, which is coming to PC at the same time as Xbox—including the Halo Infinite multiplayer beta launched last night. So I ask you, an audience with less exposure to the sci-fi shooter: how are you liking it, PC gamers?

Truthfully, when I first watched the trailer I was convinced they&#x27;d just put Cell in Dead By Daylight. Like, why not?

                    <span>I didn&#x27;t really have the luxury of devoting a cool 500 words to a single character in my Sherlock Holmes Chapter One review, firstly because I&#x27;m a believer in word economy, but secondly because what I wanted to talk about is a bit of a spoiler. It&#x27;s integral to the plot of the game and it&#x27;s revealed very quickly once you start playing, but it&#x27;s also not mentioned in any of the promo blurbs or marketing, so I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s meant to be a fun little &quot;Oh!&quot; moment. On the other hand, I do really want to talk about how cool Sherlock&#x27;s best mate Jon is...
So if you want to go into Frogwares&#x27; new detect &#x27;em up cold, then save this and come back to it after you&#x27;ve played about, ooh, 45 minutes? I think that&#x27;s long enough to get clear of spoiler territory.

It&#x27;s not a huge drama for us in PC land, Microsoft already offer most of their new stuff to us and the Xbox lot. But for PlayStation owners, the drama has arrived. Phil Spencer says he sees The Elder Scrolls 6 as a PC and Xbox exclusive, the same as Starfield.

                    <span>Dying Light 2, like its predecessor, knows that its setting is as much of a sell as its gameplay. The development team at Techland has moved on from Dying Light’s setting of Harran in a nuclear-powered ‘salt the earth’ parting blow, and has shifted focus to Villedor. You play as a stranger, Aiden, travelling to this once-majestic capital to locate his missing sister, and the second you step foot into its guarded walls you’re faced with a city kitbashed together from pieces of Paris, Berlin, Hamburg, Ostrow and other European landmarks. In Villedor proper – a city that’s been designed by actual town planners and urban designers – you see the scope of what Techland is going for. This is a big game, with some big ideas. It’s not just more of the same Dying Light.

                    <span>Windows has contributed two iconic images to the public consciousness: the default Windows XP wallpaper; and the blue screen of death. But they cut Bliss decades ago, and Windows 11 put the final nail in the coffin of Windows&#x27; pop culture relevancy by turning the blue screen of death into a black screen of death. A tragedy. Thankfully, Microsoft have now seen the cerulean light, and are planning to restore the azure annihilator in a future patch.

                    <span>Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition launched last week, and so far it&#x27;s been a pretty messy affair. And I don&#x27;t mean the whole removing it from sale fiasco, I mean the game itself is a mess. But fortunately, modders have stepped in, making improvements to the game&#x27;s rain, fixing typos, adding in lots of nice graphics options and more. One modder has even fixed the nut on the Tuff Nut Donuts sign, which, for some baffling reason, had been rounded out.

                    <span>After entering early access in September and intending to launch this year, Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodhunt has delayed its full launch and is preparing to shut down the servers until it&#x27;s done. The developers, Sharkomob say they want to focus on improving the battle royale game following feedback, including fighting cheats. While the Vampire: The Masquerade game people really want is mired in unknown development hell, I know some have found comfort in sucking drops of satisfaction from Bloodhunt—what say you, gang?

                    <span>Barry Hattrick has just signed a two-year contract with Stockport County FC. The 36-year-old former full-back, a Stockport native and lifelong fan of the Vanarama National League club, has a tactical style best described as &#x27;my dad after three pints&#x27;. Route-one, 4-4-2, and no &#x27;larking about&#x27;. He thinks a gegenpress is something you use to get the creases out of your trousers.
Hattrick is a quintessentially English anachronism, whose ignorance of the modern game represents my own unfamiliarity with modern Football Manager. It&#x27;s been quite some time since I last sported the greying temples and Fray-Bentos paunch of football&#x27;s favourite scapegoat, and returning to Football Manager is a bit like meeting up with an old girlfriend after they&#x27;ve had their consciousness uploaded into an all-knowing AI. I vaguely recognise the face behind all the ones and zeroes, but that person I once snuggled up with on winter evenings has ascended into something vast, intimidating, and utterly obsessed with data.

                    <span>Moncage is one of those puzzle games of intermittent lightbulb moments. One minute you see solutions with perfect clarity. The next you&#x27;re left scratching your head and wondering how the heck you&#x27;re meant to proceed. It wouldn&#x27;t be much of a puzzle game if there weren&#x27;t a few moments like this, of course, but when you&#x27;re playing out mechanical riddles across five possible surfaces - in this case, the sides and top of a rotatable cube - Moncage can sometimes veer into giving you a complete cerebral blackout, leaving you at an impasse until you consult its series of timed hints (or, if you&#x27;re really desperate, an in-game video solution). 
When the lightbulb pings into bright, brilliant existence, though, Moncage can be truly illuminating. As you rotate, prod and investigate its five little vignettes to line-up matching bits of scenery in one tile to affect the corresponding bit in another, Optillusion&#x27;s debut game harks back to the best bits from Fireproof Studios&#x27; The Room series. It&#x27;s a beautifully crafted little thing, and it builds on its ideas to create some genuinely standout moments of optical wizardry. If only the story it was trying to tell was half so elegant.

                    <span>The simple explanation of Sherlock Holmes Chapter One is a game where you embody the nascent consulting detective, aged 21, returning to Cordona, the Mediterranean island where he spent time as a child. It&#x27;s a third-person puzzle adventure. You gather the evidence, cross reference it all, and then come to a conclusion on the case. Young Holmes returned to Cordona to find out how his mum died a decade ago, and is helped by his best mate Jon, this season&#x27;s Creepy Watson. Boy, do they get in some scrapes along the way! Bingo, bango, there&#x27;s yer preamble.
But the complex explanation is that this game, ironically, defies explanation. As I played, I oscillated wildly between thinking, &quot;This is Frogwares&#x27; world and we&#x27;re all just living in it!&quot; and, &quot;What is even happening, what is this, I need a ten-part documentary series that just follows the developers around because they really have a lot of explaining to do.&quot;

                    <span>Morse, the strategy game that teaches you real morse code to win a war, has come a long way since we first wrote about it in 2015. What started out as a free flash game (and a makeshift telegraph key made out of a clothes peg) now has proper 3D graphics and quite possibly the most impressive custom controller setup I&#x27;ve ever seen. When I played the demo at EGX 2021 last month, not only had creator AlexVSCoding made an entire telegraph machine for the occasion, but he&#x27;d also managed to source a pair of headphones from the 1930s to really hammer home the idea of being a wartime telegraph operator. 
Obviously, you don&#x27;t need a pair of 90-year-old headphones to enjoy playing Morse. A modern headset will do just as well. You also don&#x27;t technically need the telegraph machine either, as there&#x27;s an onscreen button interface you can click with your mouse. But let me tell you, pressing those morse code buttons in-game wasn&#x27;t half as immersive as tapping out the commands on a proper dedicated machine, and I wish there was some way Morse could give everyone that experience when it finally launches in full.

                    <span>Last year, Wales Interactive released Maid Of Sker, a first-person survival horror set in a creepy hotel. It&#x27;s your typical kinda horror experience - a singleplayer romp making you solve puzzles and linger in horrible places while trying to avoid spooks. You might expect that a second Sker-y game would follow a similar formula. Nope. This weekend, the developers announced Sker Ritual, a co-op shooter in which you&#x27;ll need to survive an onslaught of ghouls.

                    <span>Wartales, the next game from Northgard developers Shiro Games, is coming to early access on December 1st. It&#x27;s an open-world RPG set in a plague-ravaged medieval world, where you&#x27;ll lead a pack of mercenaries as you all try to survive. I played the demo this summer, and it&#x27;s good! It&#x27;s a simple ye olde setting, no magic or wizards, but also has no main quests to bog you down. You&#x27;re free to follow little story threads as you please, or just exist in the harsh world with your merc pals.

                    <span>&quot;Sometimes a bit of difficulty can add a lot of replayability, but as of right now there are issues and bugs we&#x27;ve encountered in development that are making it far more difficult than intended,&quot; Back 4 Blood developers Turtle Rock Studios have said. The Left 4 Dead-style monster-mashing has become notably more difficult following the big November update, with undesireable consequences, and they laid out plans to remedy it.

                    <span>Did you know that Black Friday isn’t, as any reasonable person would assume, a celebration of West Midlands coal mining country? It’s actually a big annual sales event that Americans love so much they spend a whole day giving thanks for it. They have shiny buckle hats and go on pilgrimages to the shops. With so many deals flying about on both sides of the Atlantic, some guidance is called for, so I’m here to be your canary in the coalmine of bargains and help you avoid any turkeys.

                    <span>Server transfers were introduced to New World last month, letting players boot their characters to a new world. It was implemented as a way to ease queue times in the popular MMORPG, but didn&#x27;t work completely to plan - it caused a gold duping glitch, and some players have been blocked from transferring altogether. Amazon Games say they&#x27;re currently working on resolving these blockages, and are planning a second round of server transfers before the year&#x27;s end, so everyone has a chance to jump worlds.

                    <span>After pulling Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition&#x27;s PC edition from sale soon after its Thursday launch, Rockstar returned it to their store overnight. The remastered collection of GTA 3, Vice City, and San Andreas looks a right mess but apparently the reason for its vanishing was they had accidentally left in files they shouldn&#x27;t have, which include songs that weren&#x27;t meant to be in the game. Well, it&#x27;s back on sale now, and it still looks a mess. Hey Rockstar, maybe now consider putting the original versions back on sale too.

                    <span>Yesterday, Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition disappeared from sale on PC less than 24 hours after launch. At the same time, the Rockstar Games launcher also fell offline - the only place the PC version was available. 

Now, the launcher is back, but the Definitive Edition remains unavaiable to buy or play while Rockstar &quot;remove files unintentionally included in these versions.&quot;

                    <span>I think I&#x27;ve figured out a way to improve efficiency of heating and cooling my flat across the year by making my choices of games seasonal. In summer, I should be playing vintage games, games which a modern PC can run without even noticing, my silicon frigid. As autumn sets in, I should be playing progressively more demanding games, games that stress my CPU and GPU, pump out more heat. Then in the depths of winter, I&#x27;ll break out the ugliest ReShade presets and &quot;HD&quot; texture packs I can find, light this tower on fire. But anyway, what are you playing this weekend?

                    <span>Elden Ring is on my mind. When I go to bed and I close my eyes, I see giant crabs clack about. When I see a horse in a field, I think of Torrent the spectral steed. I consider laughing at the end of all my sentences. So yeah, to say my time with the closed network test was infectious is an understatement. But there’s just one detail rattling around my brain I simply can’t shake.
And it’s to do with where I stood in the game’s world. How strong was I? At what point do I take on the big dragon? Should I be here, or over there now? Souls games haven’t traditionally been good at letting you know these things, but Elden Ring felt more confusing. Time to investigate.

                    <span>Listen, folks, I&#x27;m going to hold up my hands and tell you something shocking. I don&#x27;t get Dark Souls. I&#x27;ve tried to play FromSoftware&#x27;s much lauded masterpieces several times over the years, but I&#x27;m simply not good enough at them to find them enjoyable. No matter how much you try and tell me about the sweet satisfaction you feel after finally beating a boss on the 57th attempt, I&#x27;ve come to realise I simply don&#x27;t have the time or the patience to see it through. I&#x27;m not sure I ever will, either. 
It&#x27;s the same reason I tend to veer away from a lot of other Soulslike games as well. I never really got on with Dead Cells, for instance, and don&#x27;t even get me started on Sekiro. But cor, I do also love it when a game proves me wrong. Hollow Knight was the first Soulslike to rekindle my rather begrudging relationship with these games, and now I&#x27;ve fallen hook, line and sinker for Death&#x27;s Door, the crow reaper sword &#x27;em up from Titan Souls creators Acid Nerve.

Both big FPS releases of the month, Call Of Duty: Vanguard and Battlefield 2042, have been at my fingertips this week and I&#x27;ve got some thoughts. Of course, Imogen hits us with news too. Valorant has another new character coming out, Fortnite pulls Travis Scott, and Imogen gives us the lowdown on just how much she&#x27;s enjoying Apex Legends&#x27; latest season.

                    <span>Rockstar yesterday launched the Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition, a collection of GTA 3, Vice City, and San Andreas rebuilt and remastered. Today, you cannot buy it at all on PC. Given that the Internet has been abuzz with screenshots of by how bad parts of the new versions look, it might be tempting to assume Rockstar pulled it from sale for being rubbo. However, they do seem to be having trouble with the launcher software which the game requires. Hmm! Either way, the game is a mess.

                    <span>Though Battlefield 2042 doesn&#x27;t officially launch until next Friday, it has launched today for people who pay extra. Folks who buy the Gold or Ultimate editions, or subscribe to EA Play Pro, can now hop on and start popping faces in Dice&#x27;s new FPS. Everyone else, hey, be glad that other people are paying to test the game for you so it&#x27;s in better shape later. Though reportedly voice chat won&#x27;t even be in by the time it properly launch so sheesh.

It&#x27;s a developer-focused event, but it&#x27;s free for everyone to watch, so if you&#x27;re interested in hearing some behind-the-scenes details about Valve&#x27;s handheld PC, it might be worth tuning in.

                    <span>Jurassic World Evolution 2 is, just like its predecessor, a very capable adaptation of cinema’s most beloved dinosaur franchise. From its music, to the quotations scattered on its loading screens, to the great steaming swamp of Jeff Goldblum voice acting, it’s a solid case study in how a studio can get its money’s worth from an expensive license. And at its heart, of course, is a stable of spectacular dinosaurs.
Using lessons learned from Planet Zoo’s development, which has more or less filled the time since 2016’s Jurassic World Evolution, Frontier have come back with the most beautiful, the most real dinosaurs ever to trudge and honk their way across a monitor. It’s proper John Hammond, spared-no-expense, sunglasses-off-and-gawp stuff. Which makes it all the more painfully frustrating to realise that they’re trapped, once again, in a seriously wonky management game.

The PvE spin-off from tactical shooter Rainbow Six Siege will have players diving into missions in teams of three to fight aliens.

That&#x27;s where new iteration Pokémon TCG Live comes in, although you&#x27;ll have to wait a while longer for it than intended, as it was announced today that its open beta has been delayed until 2022.

                    <span>Starfield is a very long way away - actually, it&#x27;s set to release exactly one year from today. We know a little about Bethesda&#x27;s upcoming space RPG already, and last night director Todd Howard revealed a few more titbits about what&#x27;s in store. During a Q&amp;A on Reddit, he talked about the game&#x27;s character creator, mod support and potential robot companions, as well as mentioned that the developers plan on showing more Starfield next summer.

                    <span>I&#x27;m once again back, and I&#x27;m badder than ever! To mark my triumphant return to the Electronic Wireless Show podcast, I (Alice) suggested we talk about our favourite non-game celebrity appearances in games. Not because I&#x27;m very famous and important, although I am, but because I wanted to spend some time making fun of Chris Pratt.
In the end, though, we don&#x27;t talk much about Chris Pratt, partly because we are so very excited to be joined on the pod by &#x27;Bath&#x27;s Nic Cage&#x27;, and discuss the time he turned on Bath&#x27;s Christmas lights, and partly because we do talk about a lot of games this week. I hope you&#x27;re all proud of us. We&#x27;re showing personal growth. Digressions this week include Harrods department store, a lot about Garfield, and Nate doing fat rips on his vape.

                    <span>If Bright Memory: Infinite has one thing, it’s bombast. It’s a game where at one point you jump and electro-grapple onto an in-flight plane as it careens into a black hole, but it’s also a game where you can easily miss the poorly telegraphed jump three times in a row and wind up having to slog through the same brief firefight again and again. 
This is a short, linear shooter about riddling high-tech corporate goons and ancient mythical chinese warriors with bullets and blade wounds - a shooter that’s left me both razzled and dazzled, but not without reservation.

                    <span>The team behind much-beloved XCOM mod Long War today announced they&#x27;ve delayed the launch of their own alien invasion strategy game, Terra Invicta. It&#x27;s now due in spring 2022. Pavonis Interactive state the usual reason: they want more time to make it good. Please do! After Long War, I certainly want to see them smash it with an ambitious game spanning the entire solar system. For now, a new trailer shows some of their recent work, including 3D space fleet battles and giant alien beasties destroying cities.

                    <span>Ahead of Skyrim Anniversary Edition&#x27;s launch, a developer behind a vital modding tool warned that the release might also break mods for Skyrim Special Edition, badly. Well, Skyrim Anniversary Edition is out now, and as expected it has broken many mods. But, good news: the person who warned of this is making better progress on fixes than expected.
