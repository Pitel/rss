                              <span>Redfall currently has &#x27;Mostly Negative&#x27; reviews on Steam, reflecting a co-op shooter that feels sparse, unsatisfying and buggy to players. Our Ed is no fan either. In an interview with Kinda Funny earlier today, Xbox head Phil Spencer talked at length about Redfall&#x27;s issues.

&quot;I&#x27;m upset with myself,&quot; said Spencer, while defending the decision not to delay the game.

                              <span>Take one look at Luna Abyss and you&#x27;ll probably go, &#x27;Wait a minute, this looks like first-person Returnal!&#x27; And having played the first mission of the game at GDC, I can confirm that yes, this is very much in the vein of first-person Returnal. It&#x27;s a fast-paced, bullet hell shooter set on a strange alien moon where everything&#x27;s out to get you, but the shift in perspective makes everything in its titular abyss feel closer and more intimate, calling to mind the frantic, confined gun fights of Doom and Quake more than Housemarque&#x27;s seminal roguelike - games that creative director Benni Hill tells me were formative experiences for him growing up. 
There&#x27;s also a greater emphasis on story-telling in Luna Abyss, with Hill also citing Nier: Automata and Bioshock as other key influences. It&#x27;s a compelling mix, based on the first chunk I played, and arguably one of my surprise GDC favourite demos alongside The Thaumaturge and The Lamplighters League. Indeed, Hill tells me they started working on Luna Abyss a year before Returnal was even announced, and when they first saw it during Sony&#x27;s PlayStation 5 reveal stream in the summer of 2020, he and his team did a collective double-take.

Not only have we got upcoming games Life By You and Paralives offering more customisation options, more features, and more polish than The Sims, but now there&#x27;s Tiny Life as well, a new entrant that asks the question: what if The Sims was simply smaller? Tiny Life has just released into early access, and it’s aiming to scratch that Sim-itch in a leaner, pixelated package.

                              <span>For the past while, I&#x27;ve been playing a closed beta build of Park Beyond, and let me tell you, I am very bad at it. I can just about (by the skin of my teeth) make a profitable park, but my god, that park will have the worst layout you&#x27;ve ever seen in your cursed, vomiting in the bins at a Disneyland life. But look, if the park works, it works, right? The shareholders can&#x27;t complain!
Thing is, much like with the internet or your mum&#x27;s relationship with the binman, theme park simulators can really change while you&#x27;re not paying attention. While part of Park Beyond&#x27;s selling point is making literally impossible rides via the aptly-named method of Impossification (an upgrade to rides you buy by spending units of amazement gleaned from your slack-jawed guests, in order to strap a canon to a rollercoaster), I really was not prepared for how simulation-y the simulation bits are.

                              <span>You’ve probably head by now that Redfall is a few virgins short of a vampy picnic, mainly by un-virtue of its undercooked co-operative cryptid blasting. But there are plenty of PC performance problems to contend with as well, despite it getting a helping hand from DLSS and FSR 2.1.

                              <span>On account of not loads happening in the last week apart from the Actiblizz acquisition news, which I do not want to talk about under any circumstances, the Electronic Wireless Show podcast talks this week about DLC, because a couple of good games got some DLCs - good, but different games getting different kinds of DLC expansions. Thus we discuss DLCs in general and what the difference is between a live service game and a game that is supported with DLC for years. As usual, we all talk about what we&#x27;ve been playing - what&#x27;s up with Redfall, y&#x27;all? - and have some recommendations. The mini-game this week is to imagine feeding beans to Quentin Tarantino.

                              <span>Digital festival LudoNarraCon is back for its fifth year, showcasing games that are all about story-telling and narrative. It kicks off today, May 4th, at 10am PT/6pm BST and runs until next Monday, May 8th. The event is being hosted on Steam where you can sample 36 demos, enjoy discounts on over 140 games, and watch 15 panels through a livestream. Highlights this year include three ‘fireside chats’ with Ron Gilbert of Monkey Island fame, the designer of the OPUS series Scott Chen, and Life Is Strange: True Color’s staff writer Felice Tzehuei, who’s sitting down to chat with our lovely reviews editor Rachel.

(I also ran out of time to put our voting form together - apologies!). But as we all continue zhoooming our lightsabers around in Star Wars Jedi: Survivor or jumping aboard the stellar space train in Honkai: Star Rail, it still feels like an appropriate time to ask you this all-important question: what are your favourite space games of all time?

                              <span>When Nintendo first released their level-building game Super Mario Maker, many fans hoped for a similar set of tools based on The Legend Of Zelda series. The Big N haven’t gotten around to it yet, but indie developers Rokaplay and Firechick have beaten them to the punch with Super Dungeon Maker, which just released out of early access. It’s what the name implies: a game where you can build your own classic Zelda-like dungeons, share them online, and then play through other people’s whacky creations.

                              <span>&quot;What will ye do, when steel hearts break, and courage does abscond?&quot; reads the penultimate line of The Pale Beyond’s poetic prologue. Actually, it’s less of a poem and more a call to action: how on earth will you keep a ragtag bunch of sailors alive in the harshest conditions on the planet? If you hadn’t already twigged, The Pale Beyond is a narrative survival sim that puts you in the frostbitten boots of First Mate aboard The Temperance - a coal guzzling steam ship that set out on a polar expedition in search of its sister, The Viscount, which went missing five years prior. As Captain Hunt’s second-in-command, you’ll take daily requests from the crew, manage the food rations, and settle petty squabbles on the poop deck.   


Beginning life as a way for co-founders Michael Bell and Thomas Hislop to create World of Warcraft mods, Bellular Studios grew alongside its gaming and Warcraft YouTube channels into a fully-fledged development team based out of their hometown of Belfast, Northern Ireland. The Pale Beyond is their debut game that fittingly draws on Ireland’s rich maritime history, although, as Hislop tells me, this wasn’t always the plan. &quot;We initially didn’t set out to do so, but it quickly emerged as a core influence that we kept finding ourselves drawn back to,&quot; he says. &quot;The further we delved into the golden age of exploration, and its very local routes, the more it resonated with us personally.&quot;

TCG Live will be replacing the older version of the creature-card-collectathon Pokémon TCG Online, which was first released back in 2011.

                              <span>As you might expect from a roster of 12 Marvel superheroes (or 17, if you count the four extra DLC supes and its original, player-designed protagonist The Hunter), the lycra-clad buds of Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns all look and feel substantially different from one another when it comes to combat. When Firaxis were designing the moveset for each hero, creative director Jake Solomon says he and fellow lead game designer Joe Weinhoffer would take turns being &quot;point designers&quot; for certain characters. &quot;Joe was point designer on one hero, I was point designer on another hero,&quot; Solomon says, highlighting Magic and Iron Man as two of his own favourite heroes that he designed. 
Both are what I&#x27;d call quite technical heroes, with Magic relying on careful battlefield placement to boot enemies into nifty magical portals, while Iron Man&#x27;s most powerful abilities often only come from discarding other cards. But when I ask Solomon at GDC if he thinks he has a particular design &#x27;style&#x27; that unites his crop of Marvel heroes, he says he loves being &quot;bombastic&quot;.

                              <span>Back in February we posted a deal on Logitech&#x27;s K400 Bluetooth keyboard/trackpad combo device, which offered a convenient way to control Steam Deck, media PCs and other gizmos that don&#x27;t come with built-in desktop-friendly controls.
Today we&#x27;re back with a similar deal on the Logitech Wireless Starter Kit, which bundles a K380 keyboard and M185 mouse for £40 (down from £50). Both elements are surprisingly high-quality for the price, with a nicer-looking and better-feeling scissor switch keyboard with circular keycaps and a compact 2.4GHz mouse that provides better speed and accuracy than a trackpad.

Supermassive Games&#x27; Dark Pictures Anthology has grown into a pretty sizeable library of horror adventures. Now, the first entry Man of Medan is coming to Nintendo Switch.
Bandai Namco and Supermassive Games have launched The Dark Pictures Anthology: Man of Medan on Nintendo Switch today, as the first Supermassive title to hit the Switch. It will still have the core modes of play, in either solo, two-player online, or offline couch co-op for up to five players.

It&#x27;s not clear if there are plans to bring the full Dark Pictures Anthology, up to this point, over to the Switch. For now, you&#x27;ll just have to make do with Man of Medan. Or head to PC, PlayStation, or Xbox, where the whole series has been running for a whi…</span>

                              <span>From turtles and cars to one man&#x27;s mountain
Apple&#x27;s mobile gaming subscription service Apple Arcade is getting a fresh batch of new games. Today, Apple revealed 20 new games coming to the subscription service.
One of the leaders of the pack is TMNT Splintered Fate, a co-op roguelike adventure starring the turtles. The crew is searching for Splinter, and will journey around New York City looking for clues while also picking up randomized power-ups.
Triband, the studio behind What the Golf? and What the Bat?, is also here with What the Car? It&#x27;s a fittingly quirky take on motor vehicles, the kind that Triband has been especially good at over its other games.

Even more are on the docket, including some familiar faces like Getting Over It and Limbo. Here&#x27;s the full list of today&#x27;s games:
Games coming to Apple Arcade, May 2023

Playdead&#x27;s Limbo+
My Town Home - Family Games+
Octodad: Dadliest Catch+

It&#x27;s a pretty solid lineup, with some familiar faces and neat new additions in there. I personally like the idea of seeing someone trying to make their way up the hill of Bennett Foddy&#x27;s Getting Over It, and the ensuing frustration, in mobile form.
Apple Arcade has had some pretty stellar games hit the service over the years, from Hironobu Sakaguchi&#x27;s Fantasian to the recent mobile version of Game Freak&#x27;s Pocket Card Jockey. I&#x27;m certainly curious to see if some more hits await in this update.

                              <span>The DMCA claims another court victory
Bungie has succeeded in the latest of an increasing line of lawsuits targeting online cheat sellers — The Destiny 2 developer was awarded $12 million in damages this week in its case against website VeteranCheats and its owner, Mihai Claudiu-Florentin.
As reported by The Game Post, Bungie filed suit against Romanian Claudi-Florentin in 2021, accusing the website owner of committing copyright infringement and tortious interference through the development selling of various hacks and cheats, distributed through the VeteranCheats domain. The key software allows players to see through walls and auto-aim, alongside other in-game advantages.
Bungie argued that the sale of VeteranCheats had caused significant harm to Destiny 2 and its community, frustrating users and undermining the game&#x27;s intent. Bungie sought default judgment of just over $12 million USD, including statutory damages of $2,000 for each of the cheat&#x27;s 5,848 downloads, as well as an additional $146,000 for copyright violation, and payment for the studio&#x27;s legal fees.
The District Court of Washington found in favor of Bungie&#x27;s claim, and ordered a total damage reparation of $12,059,912.98. In addition, Claudi-Florentin was barred from engaging in any activity that opposes Bungie&#x27;s copyright act and DMCA rulings. As of this writing, the VeteranCheats website is still operational, selling cheats for other popular video games including Call of Duty and PUBG. The Destiny 2 hacks, obviously, have since been removed.
This lawsuit represents the latest of a series of successful suits Bungie has filed against online cheat sellers, having previously won damage cases against companies such as AimJunkies, LaviCheats, and Elite Boss Tech.

In early April, South Korean developer Npixel started posting a piece of concept art each day on their Twitter showing off their upcoming open-world action MMO Chrono Odyssey. Now they have released their first-ever gameplay trailer for the new title, and wow, it&#x27;s looking pretty epic so far.
Built from the ground up using Unreal Engine 5, Chrono Odyssey takes place in the vast open-world wilderness of Setera. According to producer Samuel Seo via a post on Playstation Blog, the world of Setera will feature a living and breathing environment that transforms with dynamic weather and seasons. Based on the video it looks like there will be plenty to explore within its massive world.

                              <span>Boxing. Just boxing.
Tuatara Games have dropped their multi-player alien-smacker, Bare Butt Boxing, on Early Access today.
Bare Butt Boxing is a physics-based fighting game. You don the big padded gloves of punching and duke it out with a fleet of other aliens doing the same. The goal is to clobber your friends and family enough to launch them into conveniently supplied portals to get points. There’s a veritable charcuterie of boxing arenas to throw down in, each with unique hazards and quirks.
https://youtu.be/1eSIWYGq4fo
I’m getting some real Gang Beasts vibes from Bare Butt Boxing, only less chaotic. There’s always a bit of chaos when you lean on physics, I’m just not sure that anyone here is going to get thrown into a grinder and be turned into a sausage.
Bare Butt Boxing comes to us from the esteemed developers of 2017’s Let Them Come. Needless to say, their follow-up goes in quite a different direction by presenting an alien’s take on the gentleman’s sport. It looks like some quick fun that might be a good time if you break it out at a family event. If you’re like me, and everyone in the neighborhood has a restraining order against you, there’s online play. That way, you can go fist-to-fist against strangers who don’t know about your sordid past.
Bare Butt Boxing is currently available exclusively on Steam Early Access. However, the plan is to release it on Switch, PS4, and PS5 when it hits version 1.0. Right now, the developers are planning on 10-12 months in Early Access.

Harmony: The Fall of Reverie is a bit different from Don&#x27;t Nod&#x27;s previous work. It&#x27;s not the setting, as the studio is well-known for supernatural mysteries, whether it&#x27;s Life is Strange, Tell Me Why, or others. It&#x27;s the look of Harmony, and the form the story takes, that make this a peculiar and intriguing new story for Don&#x27;t Nod.
Right away, the difference is felt in Harmony&#x27;s opening. It&#x27;s gorgeously animated, as protagonist Polly sets out for the day, surround by near-future tech. There&#x27;s a cutting-edge world pinned up against homes made in emptied pools that really sets a tone early on. Polly&#x27;s returned home to help search for her missing mother, Ursula, but soon gets swept up in much more than she bargained for in the Reverie.

Valiant Entertainment has announced that Blowfish Studios will be returning Shadowman to the world of video games in Shadowman: Darque Legacy. This will be the first game to feature the property since 2002’s Shadow Man: 2econd Coming on PS2.
We don’t have much to go on here. Valiant has released a short teaser for the upcoming title, and boy, is it teasing. It’s one of those teasers where it pans across junk lying around before finally settling on one particular thing. In this case, it’s a scythe. And then something sinister happens, and it cuts out.

Thankfully, the press release has a bit more information, such as this quote from Blowfish Studios:

Normally, this is the part where I talk about a featured game or two that&#x27;s hitting the Switch eShop (including ones Nintendo deems fit to trot out). Instead, Nintendo is touting the recent Fortnite Star Wars collab as the biggest thing going on this week, which tells you everything you need to know! Even if you delve into the full list below, things are pretty sparse.
Nothing really even wants to be coming out in the wake of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom next Friday, which makes a lot of sense. In reality, one of the few games of note hitting the eShop this week is the Hasbro Kids Bundle: consisting of PJ Masks: Heroes of the Night, My Friend Peppa Pig, and Transformers: Battlegrounds. Don&#x27;t get too excited: the triple-pack does not contain the controversial Peppa Pig: World Adventures, which features a tribute to the late Queen Elizabeth II.

                              <span>&#x27;I&#x27;m gonna take full responsibility&#x27;
Xbox Head of Gaming Phil Spencer has expressed his disappointment at the player reception to Arkane&#x27;s much-maligned vampire hunter Redfall, which launched just two days ago to overwhelmingly negative reviews from critics and players.
&quot;I&#x27;m disappointed, I&#x27;m upset with myself,&quot; said Spencer this morning, speaking on the kinda Funny Games show. &quot;There&#x27;s nothing more difficult for me than disappointing the Xbox community.&quot;
&quot;The critical response was not what we wanted,&quot; Spencer continued, adding &quot;We&#x27;re gonna continue to work on the game. We&#x27;ve shown a commitment to games like Sea of Thieves, and Grounded, to continue to go and build games. But I also know these games are $70, and I&#x27;m gonna take full responsibility for launching a game that needs to be great…</span>

                              <span>This is my island in the sun
The ultra-charming island adventure title Tchia has surpassed one million sales since its initial release last month — This accomplishment was proudly announced by publisher Kepler Interactive and developer Awaceb just six weeks on from the title&#x27;s release on PlayStation and PC platforms.
The sunny funny RPG puts the player in the role of the titular adventurer, who must explore a tropical island while searching for the whereabouts of her missing father. Blessed with the ability of &quot;soul-jumping&quot;, Tchia is able to leap into the bodies of other sentient and inanimate beings, using the speed, agility, and abilities of these creatures and items in order to navigate the world and overcome its obstacles. Tchia is also &quot;armed&quot; with a magical ukelele, which she can use to alter the game world, summoning animals, changing the time of day and weather, and affecting the landscape itself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;NBhlxXbcyC4&amp;ab_channel&#x3D;Awaceb
With its unique concepts, cartoonish and expressive visuals, and overall wholesome vibe, Tchia won over critics and fans, receiving mostly positive response from both. Already available to purchase in digital form, Maximum Games has announced that it will be releasing a physical edition on PS4 and PS5 on July 18, which should be readily available online and from high street retailers, which will no doubt add to Tchia impressive sales record. It&#x27;s a fine success story for a humble and heartfelt release, and the title itself is well worth checking out for a lazy weekend of fun in the sun.
Tchia is available now on PlayStation and PC (via Epic Games Store.)

According to Capcom president Haruhiro Tsujimoto, the veteran publisher is hoping that its next major release, Street Fighter 6 will sell a mighty 10 million copies over the course of its lifespan. Tsujimoto made the comments earlier this week in an interview with Japanese publication Famitsu.
&quot;The Street Fighter series is our flagship title, so we had no hesitation in investing in it,&quot; Tsujimoto said, in comments translated by VGC. &quot;Over the past few years, multiple titles in the Resident Evil series have sold 10 million copies, and the Monster Hunter series now has titles that are aiming for 20 million copies.&quot;
&quot;Street Fighter V has already sold over seven million copies, so if we can make use of our digital sales experience, we should be able to aim…</span>

                              <span>Diablo now more hellish than ever before
Activision Blizzard has announced that it will be holding a live stream presentation next week for its incoming adventure sequel Diablo IV — The stream, set for Wednesday, May 10, will focus on some of the new elements coming to the Satanic franchise, such as seasons, cosmetics, and the Battle Pass.
None more Satanic.
While mechanics such as seasons and Battle Passes are generally reserved for multiplayer-centric titles with a daily online grind, particularly shooters and battle royale releases, these elements are been creeping further and further into other genres, such as fighting games and more single-player-centric experiences. The inclusion of a Battle Pass in particular seems an odd fit for Diablo IV, a title that generally consists of one/two players pushing through a narrative campaign, while earning a metric ton of loot and gear en route.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;KsNDMHvz98M&amp;ab_channel&#x3D;Diablo
Regardless, we&#x27;ll soon know more about the controversial implementation of these features. Blizzard has already told us that they expect it to take &quot;around 80 hours&quot; to complete each Battle Pass, and that a Diablo IV season is expected to last in the region of around three-to-four months. Next Wednesday&#x27;s stream should finalize some of these details, as well as showing fans some of the cosmetic and other items that can be earned during Battle Pass progress.
The live stream will take place Wednesday, May 10 at 11:00 PT / 14:00 ET / 19:00 BST, and can be watched on the official Diablo social media channels, including YouTube and Twitch.
Diablo IV launches June 6 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms. Pre-order customers will be granted Early Access from June 1.
The post Diablo IV stream to detail how seasons/battle pass systems work appeared first on Destructoid.</span>

                              <span>Don’t Nod, makers of Life is Strange and Tell Me Why, has announced that its next title, Harmony: The Fall of Reverie, is coming this June and will get a playable demo this month. 
Steam and Switch players can pick up the game on June 8, whereas PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S owners have to wait until June 22. Harmony: The Fall of Reverie is a choice-driven adventure starring Polly, a woman who returns home to find her missing mother. It&#x27;s here Polly discovers she has clairvoyant abilities connecting her to a strange dimension called Reverie. While visiting this world, Polly becomes Harmony and encounters six powerful god-like beings called Aspirations, which serve as the hearts of humanity such as Glory, Power, Chaos, Bliss, and Truth. 


Polly must restore the balance between Reverie and our world and decide which Aspiration ultimately inspires humanity by making decisions represented by a system called the Augural. This web presents a multitude of scenes players will jump between that reveal possible futures that, in turn, unlock additional story branches. Polly does this by collecting crystals given to her with each choice and character bond she makes, which are used to unlock nodes on the Augural that alter the course of the story. 
Harmony: The Fall of Reverie sports a vibrantly illustrated art direction and a soundtrack by award-winning composer Lena Raine. You can try it out early thanks to a limited-time Steam demo launching today that will be available until May 21.

                              <span>Redfall has been a letdown for many players, but perhaps no one is more disappointed than Xbox head Phil Spencer. During an appearance this morning on Kinda Funny Games’ Xcast, the executive opened up about Redfall’s launch woes.   
“There’s nothing that’s more difficult for me than disappointing the Xbox community,” says Spencer when asked about his reaction to the game&#x27;s poor reception. “...just to kind of watch the community lose confidence, be disappointed, I’m disappointed, I’m upset with myself…”
Spencer continues by touching on the criticism of Redfall launching at 30 frames per second and how it goes against Microsoft’s original claim of first-party Xbox Series X/S titles always running at 60 FPS. “That was kind of our punch in the chin, rightfully, a couple of weeks ago,” he says …</span>

Gaming is pretty great these days, but there are a handful of things we miss from the olden times before everything went online. Game stores are a big one — there&#x27;s nothing like wandering down to your local emporium and seeing row upon row of actual genuine video games, consoles and accessories old and new. You know, as opposed to a wall of Funko Pops, a chair with blinking lights, and a cabinet of secondhand Samsung Galaxies.
Game magazines are another thing we miss. There are still some stalwart publications hanging in there, thankfully, and there&#x27;s something intimate and special about holding print in your hands and poring over physical pages for your gaming news and reviews. It&#x27;s a feeling we do our best to replicate on the site, which leads us to our newest regular feature. Introducing the Nintendo Life Mailbox.

Update : After yesterday&#x27;s report that Niantic&#x27;s Pokémon GO monthly revenue was the lowest that the game has seen since 2018, the developer has today responded, dismissing the claims as &quot;incorrect&quot;.
In a comment given to Eurogamer, Niantic stated that its revenue was in fact up on the same period from last year, though it did not specifically deny that April&#x27;s takings were down on a month-on-month basis:

It&#x27;s May 4th! Yes, May the fourth is with us (hmm, that doesn&#x27;t really work) and we&#x27;re republishing our ranked list of every Star Wars game on Nintendo consoles, but now with a twist! We&#x27;ve rejigged the ranked list below to be governed by each game&#x27;s User Rating in our database, meaning that the order is now dynamic and entirely reader-ranked — and subject to real-time change, even after publication.
In order to rate any of the games on the list below out of 10, logged-in Nintendo Life users can simply tap the &#x27;star&#x27;, assign it a personal rating, and refresh the page to see any changes reflected. With various of the games in the lower half of the list only having a handful of ratings at the time of writing, there&#x27;s plenty of potential for change in the coming days. It will be fascinating to see how the ranking shakes down as we move onto May 5th, May 6th, and other similarly un-Star Wars-y dates. Enjoy!

Publisher Assemble Entertainment and developer Digital Rabbit have today announced that Fall of Porcupine, a wholesome 2D adventure game about the trials and tribulations of working in the healthcare industry, will be heading over to Switch on 15th June — and there&#x27;s even a new trailer to go with it.
The game will see you playing as Finley, a newly-qualified medical practitioner, as he begins his first hospital job in the town of Porcupine. The anthropomorphised characters and storybook aesthetics give off a strong &#x27;cosy games&#x27; vibe like we saw with Beacon Pines last year, but, as was the case with the aforementioned title, Fall of Porcupine is not quite as cuddly as it may initially seem.

Industry legend Takahashi Meijin, best known for his work with Hudson Soft and his &#x27;16 shots per second&#x27; trigger finger, is (suitably) one of the supervisors on Star Gagnant, an upcoming rapid-fire shmup that flies onto Switch on 25th May.
Published by Regista, the game employs a unique rapid-fire system which will have you selecting a fire rate for various different situations and keeping an eye on your special gauge to ensure that it works as well as it can. There are four different modes available (arcade, caravan, challenge and rapid fire), each of which provides a twist on the standard shmup format so that the game can be played however you&#x27;d like.

                              <span>The revised digital Pokémon card game sets a launch date
The Pokemon Company has locked in a full launch date for its new digital card game platform. Pokemon TCG Live will fully launch on June 8 for both PC and mobile, with TCG Online sunsetting as part of the process.
This new app is The Pokemon Company&#x27;s updated way to play the Pokemon Trading Card Game online. Announced back in 2021, the app has been in open beta for a little while now and is finally setting a full launch date.
Pokemon TCG Live can be picked up through the App Store, Google Play Store, or the TCG website for their respective platforms. The company is also hosting a celebration ahead of next expansion&#x27;s launch. Paldea Evolved will be playable starting on June 8 in TCG Live, but players who log in between May 2 and June 6 will get some special accessories and cosmetics.

This also means the original Pokemon Trading Card Game Online app will be removed from mobile and PC on June 5, at 9 a.m. PT. Accounts use the same Trainer club account log-in, and you can read up on how to migrate those over here.
The heart of the cards
As someone who already collects Pokemon cards but doesn&#x27;t really play the actual competitive card game (I just like the cool art, okay), this update feels a little targeted at me. I&#x27;ve only played a little bit of TCG Live, but it&#x27;s definitely a visual upgrade, and there are systems in place to encourage learning.
I&#x27;m still hungry for the days of the Pokemon Trading Card Game on the Game Boy, which Arceus willing, will hit Nintendo Switch Online at some point. But hey, maybe I&#x27;ll run a bunch of code cards through the TCG Live service and see if I can rekindle the card game flame.

Get your card shuffler ready. Sunshine Shuffle, the narrative poker game from the creators of An Airport for Aliens Currently Run by Dogs, is on its way for a May 24, 2023 release date.
Sunshine Shuffle is a fusion of storytelling and poker. You climb aboard the S.S. Sunshine and play poker with a capybara and other less interesting critters. The twist is that these cute creatures took part in a bank heist. As long as you pony up and put your chips on the line, they’re willing to let you in on the details.

As a warning, the soundtrack apparently consists of ska. I don’t have an issue with the genre, but some people talk about it like it’s an auditory disease. I’d probably start breaking things if a game played modern, pop-country at me, so I feel a warning is fair.
I like the idea of a narrative poker game more so than I would a game that is just poker. Years of rotting my brain with video games means I can’t sit still for ten seconds without ample visual feedback. Poker Night at the Inventory toyed around with the idea by having various video game and video game adjacent characters banter at the table. Additionally, I’d really like to know how such a regal, perfect creature like the capybara could be driven to crime.
You can find out all the sordid details in Sunshine Shuffle on May 24, 2023 on PC or Switch. Or both. I’m not your game mom.

If you remember that a new Saints Row game came out in the summer of last year, then you might be pleased to hear that the open-world adventure&#x27;s first DLC expansion will finally arrive next week, nine months on from the game&#x27;s initial release on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.
The Heist and The Hazardous — which hits all platforms on May 9 — will see our uber-trendy gangsters on a mission of vengeance, tracking down the double-crossing Hollywood star Chris Hardy following a botched assignment. The expansion will feature new in-game events, story missions, and a wardrobe full of new clothing, weapons, and other related chicanery. The Heist and The Hazardous is the first of three paid DLC expansions planned for the title in 2023.

Saints Row, which launched last August after being delayed from its initial spring release date, saw the tongue-in-cheek crime franchise rebooted with an oddly elite fashion aesthetic and a cast of younger, entrepreneurial stars. While the game itself was serviceable, with high-octane action and an appetite for destruction, many critics and fans were non-plussed at the reboot&#x27;s general vibe, complaining about a dated mission design, obnoxious and offputting dialogue, as well as a slew of technical issues.
Developer Volition has been releasing updates to correct the latter problems, which has led to this long delay between launch and DLC drops. Soon after release, it was announced that Volition was being transferred from Deep Silver to another Embracer Group publisher, Gearbox Entertainment.
Saints Row is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox. But not Stadia. Not anymore.

                              <span>Hope there&#x27;s a Homer comeback
Square Enix has announced a release date for In Tanta We Trust, the DLC expansion for its mythical adventure title Forspoken — The new campaign content will arrive May 26 on PC and PS5.
While the action-packed trailer doesn&#x27;t offer much in the way of context, we can see that Frey Holland, now truly coming to terms with the incredible powers afforded her in the kingdom of Athia, has been seemingly joined on the battlefield by no less than Tanta Cinta herself. The two magic-infused warriors will face new enemies and threats as they search for a way to purge Athia of the energy-sucking anomaly known as &quot;The Break&quot;. Players can expect an extension to Athia&#x27;s already huge map, as well as new spells, skills, friends and foes. Will we get new cat familiars? I hope so.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;uc1xcGp1PyM&amp;ab_channel&#x3D;SquareEnix
Am I going to die on the Forspoken defense hill? No, I am not, the moment has passed and fate has made its decision. But that doesn&#x27;t mean that I agree with all of the flack directed towards what was, essentially, a perfectly fine adventure with some excellent stand-out setpieces and some lovely world and character design. While hardly the most original of open-world adventures, I really liked the synergetic combat, I really liked the costuming and special effects, and... fact is... I really liked Frey.
In Tanta We Trust will, quite possibly, be the last we ever hear from the Forspoken franchise, given its disappointing sales, and combined with the fact that developer Luminous Productions has essentially been assimilated into Square Enix proper. If so, I hope that Frey, Athia, and, of course, Homer, are all given a fitting finale that sends the audience home happy.
Forspoken is available now on PS5 and PC. In Tanta We Trust will launch on May 26.

Originally, the remastered version of 2018&#x27;s Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man was only available as a part of Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man: Miles Morales Ultimate Edition. Now, there will be an option to get Peter&#x27;s adventure all by itself for PlayStation 5 owners.

The quality of The Blue Blur&#x27;s games might be hit or miss, but one thing that&#x27;s consistent with the Sonic the Hedgehog series is its outstanding music. Some of the best Sonic songs excite us as blast through each stage at supersonic speed, battle bosses, and gaze at the wonderful visuals surrounding the hedgehog.
From fully vocal tracks like &quot;Escape from the City&quot; to the nostalgic 16-bit themes of &quot;Green Hill Zone,&quot; there are practically hundreds of compositions to choose from for this list. And so, chili dog in hand, let&#x27;s listen to the 10 best Sonic songs in the series&#x27; history.

                              <span>Looking ahead to the summer
Microsoft is locking in all the details for its summer showcase plans. The publisher now has both a date and time set for its Xbox Games Showcase and the Starfield Direct that will follow after.
The Xbox double feature will air on June 11 at 10 a.m. PT / 1 p.m. ET. It will stream out over Twitch, YouTube, and Facebook, and have an ASL stream option available as well.
https://twitter.com/Xbox/status/1653754086372818944
What&#x27;s it showing? Well, for the Xbox Games Showcase, Microsoft is making it sound like there will be some announcements. There will be &quot;new surprises and first-looks&quot; from its internal studios, as well as partners from around the world. The showcase will also discuss games coming to Xbox, PC, and to Game Pass.
As for the Starfield Direct, well, it&#x27;s going to be about Starfield. Bethesda&#x27;s big RPG is still a ways off, but getting closer every day. Xbox says there will be tons of new gameplay and developer interviews.
Then, on June 13, Microsoft will air the Xbox Games Showcase Extended at 10 a.m. PT / 1 p.m. ET. This stream will host some interviews based around the news from the showcase,  as well as game updates.
The summer game showcases draw near
We&#x27;re only a few days into May, but the time period for summer streams and news is now just a month away. The PC Gaming Show is set to follow right after the Xbox showcase, Ubisoft is airing its 2023 Forward the day after, and the Summer Game Fest kick-off stream will air on June 8.
Though Nintendo, Sony, and a few other companies still have yet to lock in any summer plans as of this writing, the summer&#x27;s already starting to stack up. Even in a year without E3, it seems like June will have some news and announcements in store.
It will be interesting to see what Xbox brings to its summer games showcase event, especially as Redfall didn&#x27;t land quite so well for some folks. We&#x27;ll see what&#x27;s in store on June 11.

                              <span>Hug a tree
THQ Nordic has announced that furry open-world exploration game Biomutant will be coming to Switch on November 30, 2023.
Biomutant originally launched on other platforms on May 21, 2021. It drops you and your hideously ugly fursona in a post-apocalyptic world where your goal is to maybe save the world tree if you think that’s a good idea. For the most part, it was very open-world and put an emphasis on crafting and exploration.
I liked it. Maybe one of the few, I think. I enjoyed the exploration, thought the world presented a nice amount of variety, and the crafting system is one of the best I’ve seen. Not only could you build weapons, you could take them apart and make them into better weapons. I don’t need to excuse myself for liking a game that other people bounced off of, but if I wanted to, 2021 was absolutely depressing. Any spark of joy just glowed brighter.
I’m not really sure how this is going to look on Switch. It uses Unreal Engine 4, which has built-in compatibility with the Switch. However, I feel like you’re going to need to substantially cut back on the vegetation and fur, and I’m not sure a naked version of Biomutant is going to look so hot. Still, gameplay-wise, it should be the same. We’re pretty far removed from the days when games needed to be scaled back to fit on handheld.
Biomutant is currently available on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S. It will be coming to Switch on November 30, 2023.

Every day we read stories about the potential (inevitable?) end of human creativity due to advances in AI. But meanwhile, in the Czech Republic, a brand new developer is creating a game utilizing embroidered animation, hand-painted backgrounds, and traditional musical instruments.
It&#x27;s titled Scarlet Deer Inn, and it is being produced by Attu Games. This studio consists of a husband and wife team that decided they wanted to craft a video game entirely in-house, and I&#x27;ve never wanted to cheer someone on more. While Eva and Lukas Navratilova have been tweeting about their game since 2021, it&#x27;s a recent Twitter post that seems to be catching the internet&#x27;s attention.

Modus Games and Secret Base are teaming up to beat Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons right into our faces this summer.
Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons brings back the brothers Lee, as well as a couple more dragons to make quadruple dragons. Marian joins the brothers, after becoming tired of bad guys constantly carrying her off. Meanwhile, I hope Uncle Matin is actually their uncle. There’s reportedly going to be a total of 13 playable characters, but the gameplay only supports two-player local coop. That’s probably a bummer for a lot of people, but I’m okay with it. I don’t like playing games with people who are out of Charlie Horse range.
The big combat change here is that it’s all “tag team combat.” You select two characters and can switch between them freely. There are co-op combos and other moves to pull off between your pair.

Secret Base is best known for Streets of Red: Devil’s Dare Deluxe. They’re applying a twist to the main campaign of Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons. You select the order you&#x27;ll tackle the levels, and that will affect the length and difficulty of the following stages. You can also gain cash by performing special KOs and upgrade your fighter.
This is, by my count, the dozenth return of the series following 2012’s Double Dragon Neon and 2017’s Double Dragon IV. Secret Base seems to be bringing their own style to the series, so it should stand out from other revivals. I dig the art style, and the animations really pop.
We won’t have to wait long, as Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons releases this summer on Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.

Devolver Digital has announced that its fantasy gunslingin&#x27; adventure Weird West is to receive a &quot;Definitive Edition&quot; release on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X platforms next week, bringing Wolfeye Studios&#x27; strange frontier of cowboys and monsters to the ninth generation of gaming.
Released in the spring of 2022, Weird West is an anthology title that tells the story of five distinct characters, each forced to face a bizarre and twisted version of America&#x27;s formative period. Utilizing a top-down perspective and with a heavy emphasis on exploration, combat, and environmental interaction, Weird West was praised for its pulpy writing, creepy character design, and interesting world, though some of its action and technical elements gave critics pause.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;0NS3lzv0Nw4&amp;ab_channel&#x3D;DevolverDigital
Weird West: Definitive Edition will see the game launch on modern platforms, boasting new 4K resolution options and running at 60 FPS. Hopefully, with these visual upgrades and the power of Gen 9, some of the game&#x27;s stiffer creases will be ironed out. Here&#x27;s hoping, as Weird West is certainly charming in its own peculiar way, and any fans of alternate realities, old-school horror comics, or twin-stick action would do well to test the murky waters of Wolfeye&#x27;s adventure.
Weird West: Definitive Edition launches May 8 on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X. It is already available on PC, PS4, and Xbox One in its standard form. Devolver has not yet confirmed a free upgrade option.

Vertical Reach and publisher Armor Games Studios have announced that their puzzle-focused retro horror title, The Tartarus Key, is chambered for a May 31, 2023 release.
Putting you in the shoes of the hapless Alex Young, The Tartarus Key takes place in a bizarre mansion where doors are locked with all manner of puzzles. Lifting the aesthetics of the PS1, it promises a horror experience without the use of jump-scares. That&#x27;s a fairly common goal for horror games. Hopefully, they can pull off the scares without all the jump.

The Tartarus Key reminds me somewhat of the recent Madison, which is itself part of the emerging escape-the-room sub-genre. I don’t mean that as a bad thing. I’m just bringing it up as a matter of classification. In one of my guide-writing gigs, I would sometimes be tapped to tackle puzzle games like this since, apparently, I have a mind for it. That, or the editor just really liked pumping up my ego. And it worked! I feel like a boss!
There are three different endings to find. You have the option to either rescue your fellow captives or leave them to their fate. We’ll see how annoying they are. If we’re talking something like the SNES’ SOS, where everyone else sucks, then maybe they should just be eaten by the house. The only NPCs worth saving are the dudes from Metal Slug.
https://youtu.be/1pEJ_7qwXrQ
In any case, I’m looking forward to checking out The Tartarus Key to see if anyone is worth saving.
The Tartarus Key is coming to PC, Nintendo Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S on May 31, 2023.

                              <span>Showdown with Lili &amp; Salt on the cards?
While Capcom&#x27;s upcoming scrapper Street Fighter 6 is already getting chests puffed out and shoulders heaved way ahead of its June launch, fans from all walks of life seemed to take time out yesterday from all the smack-talkin&#x27;, hitboxin&#x27; controversies to collectively fall in love with Delta Red agent Cammy White and, in particular, her new cat pal.
Cammy, who has been depicted as having an affinity for moggies ever since her 1994 Super Street Fighter II debut, takes her love of feline friends one step further in Street Fighter 6, with an as-yet-unnamed kitty that appears with her on the character selection screen, chilling out and wanting food, because all cats are constantly hungry 24/7.
https://twitter.com/ChrisxMoyse/status/1653314827295637507?s&#x3D;20
However, in a clip captured by myself during my recent playtime with a full build of SF6, We see Cammy&#x27;s kitty has taken to interrupting her glory moments, leaping onto the battlefield mid-fight in order to brush up to her and Demand Pets. While Cammy&#x27;s trademark stoicism is apparent, she cannot help herself, and squats down to stroke Mr. Mittens, (my name, not Capcom&#x27;s), before regaining her deadly composure for the next round.
The video has been extremely popular, with even Cammy&#x27;s own voice actor Caitlin Glass declaring her love for Street Fighter&#x27;s new four-legged superstar. One cannot help but wonder whether Cammy and her friend must now do battle with Tekken&#x27;s Lili and her new moggie, Salt. This is the real reason we need to see the return of Tekken vs. Street Fighter. A gen-you-ine Meow Mix.
Street Fighter 6 launches June 2 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms. Please take some time to check out my preview of the full build. A look at the terrifying online tyrant, JP, The 50 things I loved about the beta, as well as my 10 suggestions for DLC characters.

                              <span>Microsoft had already announced their annual not-E3 Xbox Games Showcase, but now we know when exactly to tune in: June 11th at 10am PT/6pm BST/7pm CEST. Microsoft are promising “new surprises and first-looks” from both Xbox-owned studios and third-party teams, but I&#x27;m sure most people will be tuning in for the (also previously announced) Starfield Direct, which is airing immediately after the Xbox show.

Planet Of Lana has been on the RPS Hivemind’s radar since its announcement thanks to its hand-painted art, evocative soundtrack, and comparisons to Ori and Inside - two excellent platformers in their own right. The newest trailer (embedded below) is just an extra treat.

Park Beyond is not just a complex theme park management sim, or a physics-ish coaster builder (although it is both of those), it&#x27;s also an anti-physics weird-ride expando-game, allowing you to unlock increasingly unrealistic upgrades for rides in a process the developers Limbic Entertainment call &quot;impossification&quot;.

Players can download the de_voyna map, which recreates an abandoned Eastern European city that’s not too dissimilar to the war-torn streets you might find in other multiplayer maps. The difference here is a secret underground room that contains information about the invasion: headlines, maps, newspaper clippings, and images of the war.

                              <span>RTS-FPS hybrids aren&#x27;t a new thing, but they also haven&#x27;t been the most historically successful ventures. Well, Arma 3 developers Bohemia Interactive are taking a punt at blending the two genres with Silica, in the hopes that you can both shoot and command things with equal levels of good. It&#x27;s the first project to hatch from Bohemia&#x27;s incubator program, which helps indie devs make cool games.
Silica is largely the work of one developer, Martin &quot;Dram&quot; Malicharek, who was previously the lead on Bohemia&#x27;s Take On Mars. Having given Silica a whirl for over an hour, I struggle to see whether the RTS, FPS hybrid can truly offer the best of both worlds. It does, however, make being a crab extremely good.

This time we&#x27;re chatting about our biggest Steam sins. That’s right, we’re revealing it all: shamefully ignored indie gems, outrageous playtimes, and games that we promise we’ll return to one day, honest! We also get into what we’ve been recently playing and then end, as always, with our hyperfixations.

We named Jump Over The Age&#x27;s dystopian RPG one of our favourite games of 2022 last year, and seeing as the game is also celebrating its first anniversary this month, it&#x27;s the perfect time to return the rag-tag world of Erlin&#x27;s Eye.

                              <span>Persona is a series with plenty of choice as you balance your alternate dimension demon-slaying responsibilities with your high-schooling social life. Playing as a student, you&#x27;re free to decide how to spend your free time, which characters to spend it with, and who to inevitably romance by the end of the game. Plenty of options, for sure, but Persona 3 Portable was the last time we could choose our protagonist’s gender in the series. Until now. Thanks to the simply titled “P5R Female Protagonist” mod, you can now replace the default male protagonist Joker in Persona 5 Royal with a she/her Joker. On paper, that would seem like a novel change in a lot of games, but in the mammoth-sized Persona 5, a change like that requires some very impressive modding.

                              <span>The new Apex Legends season, Arsenal, looks exciting from watching the new trailer. The 17th season is set to launch on May 9th, and features new character Ballistic, a competitor in the Apex Games&#x27; predecessor the Thunderdome Games, now making a comeback as the new legend. The popular World&#x27;s Edge map is also getting some healing, and there&#x27;s an Apex Museum within the map that celebrates Apex&#x27;s past, present, and future. Although the theme for this season seems to be nostalgia, there are still some new features to look forward to, particularly the updates to the weapon system and upgraded Firing Range.

                              <span>It&#x27;s rare to see discounts on compact keyboards, and rare to see discount on wireless keyboards, but today we&#x27;re got a cracker on a mechanical keyboard that is both compact and wireless. It&#x27;s the Cooler Master SK622, a gaming-optimised 60% design that offers low profile switches, a UK layout (with optional RGB backlighting) and the flexibility of wired (USB-C), Bluetooth and lower-latency 2.4GHz wireless.
The CM SK622 retailed for over £100 back in the day, but now it&#x27;s available for half-price: £49.98. That&#x27;s an awesome deal for any mechanical keyboard, much less one from a name brand with wireless connectivity!

The blindingly quick Ryzen 7 7800X3D processor has dropped to just £440 at UK, a fair bit better than than the £450+ price points and poor availability that greeted the launch of the CPU last month. You can pick up the 7800X3D for this price at Amazon, Ebuyer and Overclockers, so you have a fair few options too.

                              <span>The UK&#x27;s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) launched a new awareness campaign today hoping to educate kids on the risks of using the internet. The government&#x27;s decision to call the campaign &quot;CyberFlix&quot; is utterly bewildering. Not only does the campaign now share the same name as one of the most recognized movie piracy apps, but the first few pages of Google results only return piracy-related results, at least some of which lead to malware.

                              <span>Planet of Lana, the narrative sci-fi puzzle platformer with Studio Ghibli vibes, got a surprise release date today, and it’s just a couple of weeks away. 
On May 23, players can embark on an adventure as Lana, joined by her cat-like companion, Mui, to rescue her sister. The game is set in an alien world teeming with strange creatures and dangerous robots, which Lana and Mui overcome by working together to solve platforming puzzles or sneaking unseen in stealth. Planet of Lana occupies a similar space as games like Limbo and Inside, though with a decidedly more vibrant presentation. Check out its new trailer below. 


Planet of Lana was first unveiled at E3 2021 and is being developed by Wishfully and Thunderful. It was originally supposed to launch last year before suffering a delay. The game is coming to Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC. It will be available on Xbox Game Pass at launch.</span>

                              <span>PlayStation has announced that a standalone version of Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man Remastered will hit PlayStation 5 later this month. 
Previously, Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man Remastered was only available by purchasing the Ultimate Edition of Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man: Miles Morales. Later this month, anyone will be able to play Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man Remastered. Players will be able to purchase it standalone or, if you own Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man on PlayStation 4 (or its Digital Deluxe Edition or Game of the Year Edition), then you can pay $10 to upgrade to Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man Remastered on PS5. 
This remaster is perhaps most famous for introducing a redesigned face for Peter Parker, but it also includes The City That Never Sleeps expansion starring Black Cat as well as some exclusive Spidey suits, such as those from Spider-Man: No Way Home. 
Owners of Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man: Miles Morales can still obtain Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man Remastered by upgrading to the Ultimate Edition through the main menu of the PS5 version of the game. If you&#x27;re looking to buy the remastered game standalone, it will cost you $49.99. 
PlayStation says this standalone version and upgrade path is coming later this month, but it doesn&#x27;t say exactly when.

                              <span>PlayStation revealed last December that Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2 will hit PlayStation 5 sometime this fall. And then, strangely enough, the voice actor behind the game&#x27;s Venom hinted on Twitter that Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2 will be released this September. While we still don&#x27;t have official confirmation of when we&#x27;ll be playing this game, we do know when we&#x27;ll get our next taste of Insomniac Games&#x27; Spider-Man world: this weekend. 
That&#x27;s because on Free Comic Book day, which is this Saturday on May 6, PlayStation will release a prequel comic book for Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2. 
&quot;When we initially sat down with the team at Marvel, we explored a few different ideas about what kinds of stories we could tell in a prequel comic,&quot; Insomniac Games narrative director Jon Paquette writes in a PlayStation Blo…</span>

                              <span>Billy and Jimmy Lee are making a comeback in Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons. This new co-op brawler is coming this summer and will revitalize the dormant series in a new tag-team-focused adventure.
Set in New York City after it’s been destroyed by nuclear war, Billy and Jimmy must take back what remains from the violent gangs that have since taken over. They won’t be doing it alone, though. The game features 13 playable characters, including Marian, the brothers’ old love interest, who now packs a pistol to blast threats from afar, and newcomer Uncle Matin, a tank-like fighter with a riot shield. 


According to a press release, Double Dragon Gaiden boasts “seamless tag team abilities and a multitude of strategies for devastating combos, defensive and offensive moves.” Solo players can swap characters on the fly to switch between their individual skills, such as the offense-focused Jimmy and more defensive Billy. The game supports two-player local co-op at launch (online co-op is coming in a post-launch update). 
Double Dragon Gaiden tasks players with toppling four gang leaders and features a unique dynamic mission select system. Missions can be tackled in any order, and this selection affects their length, difficulty, and the number of enemies that appear. Earning cash unlocks powerful special movies that instantly knock out enemies, and you can also obtain crowd control moves that can wipe out multiple foes. Other gameplay options include an adjustable difficulty, permadeath and infinite modes, and unlockable bonuses. 
Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons is being developed by Secret Base and published by Modus Games. It&#x27;s coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.</span>

                              <span>Microsoft has revealed that a &quot;deep-dive&quot; Starfield Direct will immediately follow an Xbox Games Showcase this June. 
Earlier this year, the company showcased various games, including Redfall and the shadow-dropped Hi-Fi Rush, at an Xbox and Bethesda Direct in January. Microsoft said at the time that a standalone Starfield show was in the works to &quot;dedicate the proper amount of time for a deep dive&quot; into the game, and now we know when that&#x27;s happening: June 11, immediately after the June 11 Xbox Games Showcase.

The Breath of the Wild soundtrack might have been something of a departure for the Zelda series with its grand themes and sweeping scores replaced by something a little more subtle, but there are still some top-notch tunes to be heard in there.
Many of us have been listening to the soundtrack on repeat in the run-up to Tears of the Kingdom, but this recent concert from the Ensemble G.A.P. orchestra in Japan is a pretty darn good reason to blast those themes all over again (thanks, Siliconera).

THQ Nordic has today announced that it is bringing Experiment 101&#x27;s Biomutant to the Switch, with a release planned for later this year.
Biomutant was released back in 2021 on the PS4 and Xbox One to mediocre reviews before getting a next-gen update the following year. We don&#x27;t know whether the game is going to be tweaked in any way for the Switch at the moment, so we are assuming that it is going to be the same combat-focused open-world adventure.

The Double Dragon franchise is back after a six-year absence with Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons, a 2D beat &#x27;em up with visuals and gameplay not too dissimilar from Ubisoft&#x27;s Scott Pilgrim Vs The World: The Game.
Developed by Secret Base, the studio behind Streets of Red - Devil&#x27;s Dare Deluxe, Double Dragon Gaiden features co-op action gameplay infused with roguelike elements to deliver &quot;classically informed, highly replayable Double Dragon-style brawls with a new edge&quot;.

Ever since Nintendo gave players the tools to develop their own levels with Super Mario Maker, there’s been talk about the Big N expanding the concept to other franchises, especially Zelda. This was allegedly discussed at greater length behind the scenes and eventually led to the addition of the Chamber Dungeons concept in the Link’s Awakening Switch remake, but there seemingly wasn’t enough will or interest to see it through to a fuller product, as we haven’t seen anything come to fruition yet. Spotting an opportunity to capitalize on the potential of this idea, an indie team called Firechick launched and successfully funded a Kickstarter late last year for a legally distinct top-down Zelda-style dungeon builder called Super Dungeon Maker. Now that it’s come to Switch, we can report that it’s a decent foundation, though it feels unfinished at launch and there’s clear room for improvement here.
First, a brief overview. This is a game that apes the gameplay of the Game Boy and SNES Zelda games as closely as possible, right down to that annoying worm boss that spins in circles in a cramped room. Instead of playing as Link, you play as a chicken named Fink who has the same basic sword and shield alongside a small arsenal of tools like a hookshot or bombs. Using these, you navigate dungeons, solve puzzles, and kill baddies, all in the quest to find the golden egg at the end of each dungeon.

It&#x27;s been a while since we last heard from the arcade-inspired baseball series, Super Mega Baseball, but thanks to a new official reveal trailer, we now know that the fourth entry in the franchise will be swinging its way onto Switch from 2nd June.
Super Mega Baseball 4 continues much of what we have seen before, bringing over 200 baseball legends back to the field in a chunky, big-head visual style. This time around, the game has received some fresh new animations and stadiums, improved in-game audio and soundtrack, and a couple of more tweaks for good luck.

Are you a fan of Shovel Knight? How about Mega Man? If you&#x27;ve answered &quot;yes&quot; to either of those questions, then you may be entitled to compens... Wait, no, that&#x27;s not right.
If you&#x27;ve answered &quot;yes&quot;, then we&#x27;ve a feeling you&#x27;re going to love Bat Boy, an 8-bit action-platformer from X PLUS Games that takes everything great from Shovel Knight and Mega Man and lumps it all into a neat little package that frankly looks awesome.

We know that The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is going to be set in the same Hyrule that we have each spent many, many hours exploring in Breath of the Wild. Sure, we imagine that there are going to be a fair number of tweaks (hi Sky Islands!), but it looks like the basic skeleton is the same. So, what&#x27;s the best way to prepare for this return? Replay the first game? Stare longingly at the map? Get yourself a horse and head out on a real-life adventure on your own? You could do all of the above, or you could have a crack at HyruleGuessr, a BOTW-set map quiz (thanks, Polygon) — it&#x27;s your call...
As the name suggests, this is a twist on the original Geoguessr game, where you are dropped at a random spot in the world (via Google Street View, not literally) before having to guess your location based on clues like road markings, street signs and nearby landmarks.

                              <span>Is there worse box art than that for the first Age Of Wonders, back in 1999? Probably - but I still wouldn&#x27;t have seen it and bet on the series continuing 24 years later. 

Yet here we are. Age Of Wonders 4 is out today.

Now Super Mega Baseball 4 has been announced, and for the first time it&#x27;s got a roster of pros to play with - or former pros, at least.

As of today, any Game Pass subscriber can offer up to five friends a 14-day free trial to PC Game Pass. So I guess it&#x27;s time to bug your friends.

Having played the vampiric FPS for a clutch of hours now, I&#x27;d say it feels more like an &quot;absence&quot;. Arkane&#x27;s latest strikes me as an open world shooter with a few simple strands that never seem to go anywhere. Occasionally, there are flashes of a team that - as we all know - are capable of brilliance, but Redfall has me following a path of irritation, and feeling a slight sadness for what might&#x27;ve been.

Indie book publisher Lost In Cult have launched their latest campaign to crowdfund Cycles Of The Eye, as well as their next art book focused on the game&#x27;s dystopian cyberpunk world.

                              <span>It was a Wednesday in March, and the Dreamworks dream team of Steven Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen had flown into Seattle to join Bill Gates for a press conference. The four men, seated on tall Hollywood director’s chairs, were estimated to be worth a combined $11 billion - and that was in 1995 money.


Together, Dreamworks and Microsoft were going 50-50 on a new game studio, investing a total of $30 million. “I’m spoiled,” said Spielberg, as recorded by the LA Times. “I worked with the best studios and the best actors, and it would be silly to get into the interactive business without Microsoft. They’re the best company in the world. It does seem like a marriage that was destined to happen.” It was a marriage that would produce a famously strange child in Jurassic Park: Trespasser.

                              <span>The Kingston NV2 is a budget PCIe 4.0 drive, designed to be assembled from the cheapest available components to deliver a decent baseline of performance. That makes it often an aggressively priced SSD compared to others at similar speeds, and today Box are offering the 2TB model for just £77.50. That&#x27;s the lowest price we&#x27;ve ever seen for a 2TB PCIe 4.0 SSD and a deal worth writing up, IMO.

                              <span>Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns may be a turn-based tactics game first and foremost, but it also has a substantial RPG element that drives both the story and the interpersonal dramas of its superhero teams between missions. When you and your squad head back to your Abbey HQ, there are side stories and quests to investigate around the Abbey grounds, items to find, and more. It&#x27;s a sizable part of the game, but at one point it was even bigger, creative director Jake Solomon tells me at GDC. 
&quot;It&#x27;s crazy, if you go online, you can see all the Midnight Suns cutscenes and they&#x27;re three hours long. That&#x27;s as long as a movie,&quot; he says. But during the last year of development Solomon reveals &quot;we cut 30 conversations from the game, like 30 scenes. We cut a ton, because we realised this is just simply too much.&quot;

                              <span>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor’s PC has had a particularly bumpy launch on PC with our hardware boss James concluding that “sluggishness and stuttering are problems on higher-end graphics cards, even before adding the strain of ray tracing effects.” EA have now released their first post-launch patch, aiming to fix a host of issues.

                              <span>I first played co-op third-person shooter Glitch Busters: Stuck On You at Summer Games Fest last year, and came away really impressed. I played with couch co-op with two members of developers Toy Logic, which was lighthearted, slightly chaotic fun; everything couch co-op should be, right?
So, I thought I&#x27;d give the game a whirl but as a solo player. How would a game built for up to four players cope when there&#x27;s just one person taking the reins? Well, sort of fine for a bit, then quite agonising, actually. That&#x27;s not to say it can&#x27;t be a fun time, but bots definitely aren&#x27;t a substitute for real people.

And every Monday (or Tuesday, after a holiday weekend like this), I bring you a selection of these snaps and clips. This week, my eye has been caught by weird musical contraptions, a quiet moment on the balcony with a cup of coffee, chill building, frozen sledding, and the ability to skip a game&#x27;s tutorial so hard that it sinks to the bottom of the sea. Come admire all these interesting and attractive indies with me!

Yep, embroidered as in using needles, thread, and fabric to stitch together every animation in real life, from the protagonist&#x27;s big jump to a sheep’s wagging tail. This stitching is then scanned into the game by developers Attu Games, creating a uniquely beautiful platformer with a slightly physical touch.

                              <span>The underwater scares of Dredge are about to run even deeper. Developer Black Salt Games have revealed a roadmap for their spooky fishing game, promising four new bits of content coming over the next year including a chiller passive mode, nice quality-of-life additions, and a larger paid DLC pack with a new non-eldritch horror threat.

                              <span>In the incredibly rare circumstance that you might have had a Kinder Egg as a kid, was the toy ever your favourite part? It sure wasn’t for me. I was all about the chocolate. Sure, I’d crack open the yellow canister inside, let out some variation of, “Oh, an elephant!”, and promptly toss it in the bin and walk away, its destiny consigned to landfill. In the landfill of my brain, I’m currently carving out new space for Street Fighter 6’s World Tour mode. It&#x27;s available to try now in demo form on PC and consoles, but I&#x27;ve been able to play a larger build of it that covered the first two chapters. Sadly, I can&#x27;t say it left much of impression.
In case you&#x27;re equally bemused by what SF6&#x27;s World Tour actually is, this is a new, open world, RPG-style mode in which you make a custom fighter, run around small areas of Metro City and other locations around the globe, and level up. There are moves to learn, side quests to complete, and you can even do mini-game activities such as making pizza. Between all of that, you fight people. Other fighters, unruly gang members, random folk making their way to work in the morning. You can punch almost all of ‘em! There’s a glimpse of the Street Fighter you know and love here with its side-on 1v1 bouts, but everything else around it is unnecessary fluff. In other words, World Tour is the token toy inside the more delicious Street Fighter chocolate.

                              <span>The true meaning of wrestling
If there’s two things I love, it’s wrestling and cuddling. Both of these things are already very adjacent, but Wrestling With Emotions: New Kid on the Block is looking to flying elbow-drop them into one sexy package.
The sequel to Team Lazerbeam’s 2016 indie title, Wrestling With Emotions: New Kid on the Block looks to continue the team’s weird take on love and suplexes, and it’s everything I want it to be. It’s got meat, it has all types of hunks, and it’s about rugged embraces and tender smooches. It’s what wrestling is all about!
And now, there’s a demo, and after playing it, I can confirm that this is the next big thing in big things.

                              <span>No heroes on the go
Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns is getting new content and some new platforms next week. But alongside the launch confirmation comes some bad news for Switch holdouts: Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns is no longer planned for a Switch release.
In today&#x27;s blog, 2K and Firaxis confirm the news, saying that a &quot;Nintendo Switch version of Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns is no longer planned.&quot;
As one of Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns&#x27; delays, Firaxis had pushed the hero strategy game and also further delayed some console versions of it. While the PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S versions arrived last December, the PS4, Xbox One, and Switch versions fell back.
For PlayStation 4 and Xbox One owners, Midnight Suns lands on those platforms on May 11. Alongside the new platform launches is a new character update, as Sto…</span>

Video game composer Ryo Nagamatsu announced that they have left Nintendo following a 17-year tenure that saw them produce music for titles franchises including Splatoon, Mario Kart, Super Mario, and Smash Bros.
Speaking in a succinct message on Twitter, Ryo Nagamatsu implied that he has left Nintendo (amicably) in order to spread his creative wings a little further across the industry.
&quot;I have made a decision to leave the company of April 30, 2023,&quot; writes Nagamatsu. &quot;I will work a little wider and more directly to help those who need my help and to help the industry. Thank you all for your kind support! I look forward to serve you in the future! (an amicable settlement)&quot;
Joining the studio in 2006, Nagamatsu plied his trade on some of the biggest releases for Nintendo platforms, composing music for Wii releases Super Mario Galaxy 2 and Wii Sports Resort. 3DS titles The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds, Mario Kart 8, and Mario Party: Star Rush, and in more recent years oversaw music composition and voice recordings for Switch titles Splatoon 3, Mario Party Superstars, and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.
We can very likely look forward to hearing his exciting and evocative compositions in future works.

Another Riot Forge production is on the way, this time exploring the world of League of Legends&#x27; Ekko. Converegence: A League of Legends Story is a 2D action platformer starring the time-and-space-travelling fighter, and it arrives on May 23, 2023.
Developed by Speed Brawl studio Double Stallion Games, Convergence follows Ekko as he deals with a threat to the city of Zaun. From today&#x27;s trailer, it looks like Ekko will be interacting with his future self, as well as rewinding time in the short-term too, in order to foil some catastrophe.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;_qqdGiHBStk
Convergence&#x27;s platforming and action also makes use of Ekko&#x27;s unique time abilities. From gaining an advantage over foes to rewinding a missed jump, it definitely feels like something Prince of Persia: Sands of Time should be keeping an eye on.
The story follows Ekko through the undercity of Zaun too, so Arcane fans should get a little bit more out of this than other locales. But of course, there are champions to fight too. Alongside Ekko, three other champions have been confirmed: Jinx, Camille, and Warwick.
Time after time
It feels like only yesterday that The Mageseeker, the latest Riot Forge production, came out. While that one followed the magical rebellion happening within Demacia, Ekko&#x27;s exploits in Zaun will be a bit different, both in setting and gameplay.
All of these, as well as the upcoming Song of Nunu, are part of Riot Games&#x27; publishing arm Forge. The idea has been to expand the world of League of Legends through third-party projects, and so far, it seems like it&#x27;s been doing alright. Games like The Mageseeker and Ruined King were solid, fresh approaches to Runeterra. Maybe the streak can keep up with Convergence.
Convergence: A League of Legends Story goes live for PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch on May 23.

Square Enix has announced that its blocktastic range of releases known as the Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster series has now surpassed two million total sales across PC, console, and mobile platforms.
The range of classic RPGs first launched on PC and mobile platforms in the summer of 2021, drip feeding each title over the course of the following six months. The entire collection finally arrived on PlayStation and Nintendo Switch just last month, and consists of legendary releases Final Fantasy, Final Fantasy II, Final Fantasy III, Final Fantasy IV, Final Fantasy V and, you guessed it, Final Fantasy VI. The new console reports have received praise from both critics and fans alike.

Each release sees the games that defined a genre sharpened up for modern displays, while retaining the nostalgic and warmth-inducing sprites and environments of their 8-bit and 16-bit roots, overseen by original artist Kazuko Shibuya. Audio has been restored by composer Nobuo Uematsu, and a fresh run of balance tweaks and bug fixes have been made to the releases, fixing issues that have existed — in some cases — for nigh-on four decades. The console editions of the games include the option to switch to each title&#x27;s classic soundtrack, as well as utilize an easier-on-the-eyes &quot;pixel font&quot;.
The Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster series is available now on PC, PlayStation, Nintendo Switch, and iOS and Android platforms.

As for why the Switch version has been canceled, Firaxis doesn&#x27;t provide anything more than, &quot;Note that a Nintendo Switch version of Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns is no longer planned.&quot; This follows news from earlier this year that the game&#x27;s director (and the director of Firaxis&#x27; modern XCOM games), Jake Solomon, is departing from the studio. 
PS4 and Xbox One players that purchase the Legendary Edition of Midnight Suns or the game&#x27;s Season Pass will get the new Blood Storm DLC as well as all previously released DLC, which alongside Storm adds Deadpool, Morbius, and Venom to the game.

                              <span>Citizen Sleeper was one of our favorite experiences of 2022, and as it approaches its first anniversary on May 5, the team behind it reveals it&#x27;s begun work on its next project.
Gareth Damian Martin, the solo developer behind Jump Over the Age, is again joining forces with indie publisher Fellow Traveler, character artist Guillaume Singelin, and composer Amos Roddy on a new game. There’s no information about what this next title entails, but the team promises to reveal more in the “near future.” The coming days serve as a celebration for Citizen Sleeper, with the game receiving a 33 percent discount on PC and Switch starting May 4. 
Citizen Sleeper is a sci-fi choice-driven adventure where players guide a robot possessing a human consciousness through life on a space station, fighting for survival while also helping the lives of its inhabitants. In our review, we scored the game a 9 out of 10, with editor Wesley LeBlanc writing that &quot;Its hopeful and inspiring message is backed by a branching, heartfelt narrative, and a great gameplay loop, making it tough to put down. Add in its enriching visual style and my favorite musical score of 2022 so far, and Citizen Sleeper is a game I&#x27;ll be thinking about for years to come.&quot; Citizen Sleeper also earned a spot on our Top 10 Games of 2022. 
Citizen Sleeper is available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC.</span>

Electronic Arts acquired developer Metalhead Studio a year after the launch of Super Mega Baseball 3, meaning that the developer had the benefit of creating this fourth entry with the added resources of its new parent company.
The result appears evident. For the first time in series history, more than 200 legends of the sport (including cover star David Ortiz) are included in the roster alongside the fan-favorite cast of players from the earlier games in the series.

                              <span>We got our first sneak peek at the upcoming Gran Turismo movie back in January, and now the film&#x27;s first full-length trailer provides a better look at PlayStation&#x27;s latest cinematic adaptation. 
Unlike other many video game movies, Gran Turismo is actually based on real events. The film tells the true story of Jann Mardenborough, a British professional race car driver who began his career by winning GT Academy, a European televised contest that pitted the best Gran Turismo players against each other for a chance to earn an actual racing career with Nissan. The film follows the teenage Mardenborough&#x27;s ascension from, as the poster below puts it, gamer to racer and all the trials that come with it. 















	



  
    

  
      
            


      
  













Mardenorough is portrayed by Archie Madekwe and the film also stars David Harbour, Orlando Bloom, and Djimon Hounsou. Neil Blomkamp sits in the director’s chair. 
Gran Turismo premieres exclusively in theaters on August 11.</span>

Street Fighter 6 may feature thrilling 1v1 fights, but one of its most exciting features is its World Tour mode. This single-player sandbox story mode is a dramatic shift in what the series has offered, and players recently got to sample a small slice in a recent demo. On a trip to Capcom’s U.S. headquarters in San Francisco, I ventured beyond the demo for a more comprehensive look at what World Tour has to offer.  
World Tour gives players robust tools to craft a custom fighter, then take them to the streets of Metro City and other locations on a journey to create the u…</span>

                              <span>Redfall is now available for players worldwide, but unfortunately, I’ve only been playing for a few days and cannot provide a full review yet.
Writing this Redfall review-in-progress is painful because Arkane Studios is one of my favorite game developers, and its new game is largely disappointing. While the open world is beautifully sculpted with intriguing vistas, it’s weirdly empty, often implying that the harbor town’s vampire usurpers invaded during the offseason. 
As a whole, Redfall’s gameplay is unbalanced. Several puzzling decisions, like a lack of stealth takedowns or the inability to pause the game in single-player mode, are far from what I’d expect from an Arkane game. Rampant technical issues hinder the brighter moments of the experience, including frequent server crashes, inputs failing to work, NPCs and enemies spawning duplicate versions of themselves, and one very frustrating bug which prevents me from closing the world map and main menu in cooperative play. 
On a positive note, I like the four launch protagonists, each with unique skills you can upgrade via a straightforward-but-effective skill tree. Also, a handful of weapons are neat, like the heavy-hitting stake launcher or ultra-violet raygun that turns vampires to stone. A few locations, like a deranged scientist’s mansion, a cliffside lighthouse, and a hangar repurposed as a prison quarter, provide enough challenge to incentivize intelligent pathfinding. Unfortunately, most locations and enemy placements feel haphazardly designed – certainly a byproduct of creating two open-world maps. 
However, my evaluation may change in the coming days. I’ve completed roughly 50 percent of the game and its first story arc, but I’ve only played for a few days and have more content to see.

We’re reviewing Redfall on PC. Here are our computer specs: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090, AMD Ryzen 9 5950X 16-Core Processor, 64GB RAM</span>

Almost two decades later, movie studios known for their cash settlement model are obtaining subpoenas regardless. Their latest target is Cox Communications, because that makes complete sense.

                              <span>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor is a pretty great game that, unfortunately, isn’t running as well as it could be for some players. The PC version has been especially problematic, and Respawn is addressing these issues with a performance update. 
The PC version of the game has reportedly been plagued with a variety of bugs and glitches, notably affecting frame rate. Today’s update, which is now live, is only stated as being “performance improvements for non-raytraced rendering&quot; in the patch notes. 
That doesn’t seem like the most helpful update on the surface, but it&#x27;s worth noting that the multiple improvements coming to the console versions, which are listed below, have already been implemented on PC:
Multiple crashes fixed across PlayStation and Xbox Series X/S and various areas of the game.
Fixed crashes that were tied to skipping cinematics.
Performance improvements across PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.
Fixed an issue with dynamic cloth inside the Mantis
Fixed various rendering issues.
Fixed an issue with registered Nekko colors not saving.
Fixed an issue with registered Nekko disappearing from the stable.
Fixed issues with cinematic dialogue overlapping.
Fixed various collision issues.
Fixed an issue with enemy A.I. remaining in T Pose during photo mode.
Fixed a freeze that occasionally occurred while talking to Doma.
Fixed a bug where the BD-oil VFX did not properly render.
Fixed an issue where players were getting stuck inside the Chamber of Duality if you didn’t save after leaving the chamber and die. 
Hopefully, today’s PC patch does some significant help, but if not, Respawn, at least has other updates in the works. If you’re playing on PC, how has your experience with Star Wars Jedi: Survivor been? Has today’s update helped at all? Let us know in the comments.</span>

                              <span>The Super Mario Bros. Movie continues to be a massive success and became the first film of 2023 to leap past $1 billion at the global box office. 
The film achieved this milestone on Sunday, less than a month after its U.S. premiere on April 5. According to Variety, the film has grossed $490 million in North America and $532 million internationally, adding up to rough total of over $1 billion. Despite a tepid critical reception, Illumination’s adaptation of Nintendo’s flagship franchise has already become the highest-grossing video game film ever, the highest opening weekend, and the top-grossing film of 2023 so far.  
The Super Mario Bros. Movie is also just the fifth movie to cross the billion-dollar threshold since the pandemic started. It joins the coveted ranks of Avatar: The Way of Water, Spider-Man: No Way Home, Top Gun: Maverick, and Jurassic World Dominion.

Také Ubuntu dostalo nové LTS obrazy.</span>

                              <span>Vampire Survivors is going Hollywood thanks to the announcement of an upcoming animated TV adaptation. 
Developer poncle has confirmed that it&#x27;s working with gaming consulting company Robot Teddy and media company Story Kitchen to bring the hit arcade bullet hell game to the small screen. Story Kitchen is helmed by names such as Dmitri Johnson (co-producer of the Sonic the Hedgehog films), John Wick creator/writer Derek Kolstad, and APA agent Mike Goldberg. There’s currently no other details about what the series will entail, such as the cast or a premiere date. 
“The most important thing in Vampire Survivors is the story, so it&#x27;s a dream come true to see what started as a little indie game I made on my weekends come to life as an animated TV show! It’s also great to be partnering up with such experienced and talented people to make the show. I do wonder if they&#x27;ve realised that there isn&#x27;t a single vampire in Vampire Survivors, though,” says Luca Galante, founder of poncle in a press release.
If you&#x27;re tilting your head wondering how a pixelated arcade game can be translated into a show, it&#x27;s worth nothing that Vampire Survivors has been brought to life in animated form before. Its two expansions – Legacy of the Moonspell and the recently launched Tides of the Foscari – both featured slick animated trailers, so those could be reference points for how this series may potentially appear. 
Vampire Survivors has been on quite a roll since it launched to widespread acclaim last year, scooping up several end-of-year awards and walking away with a couple of BAFTA trophies this year, including winning Best Game. You can read our review of Vampire Survivors here.</span>

Original Story: The live-action Twisted Metal TV series got its first poster today, courtesy of IGN, ahead of a teaser trailer scheduled to drop later today. The upcoming adaptation of the classic PlayStation car combat series is set to premiere this July. 
Twisted Metal is being developed by Peacock and stars Anthony Mackie as protagonist John Doe, a “smart ass” delivery driver who transports supplies between settlements in a post-apocalyptic America. He has no memory of his past but gets a chance at a better life by making one special delivery across the dangerous landscape. 
We have the exclusive new poster for @Peacock’s #TwistedMetal show starring Anthony Mackie.

Tonally, the series is billed as an action comedy. Other characters include Sweet Tooth, who will be voiced by Will Arnett and physically performed by pro wrestler Samoa Joe. The cast also includes Stephanie Beatriz, Thomas Haden Church, Richard Cabral, Tahj Vaughans, and Neve Campbell. The show is being produced by Sony Pictures Television and PlayStation Productions, and it&#x27;s the second TV adaptation of a first-party PlayStation game to arrive this year following The Last of Us. 
Twisted Metal premieres on July 27 exclusively on Peacock and consists of 10 half-hour-long episodes. We&#x27;ll update this story with the teaser trailer when it becomes available.</span>

Lego has continued to build out its Nintendo universe of sets with Super Mario and now, hot on the heels of The Super Mario Bros.

We can&#x27;t wait to see how the four Expansion Sets inspire kids to discover the new wild and colorful jungle from the Donkey Kong universe, whether that&#x27;s hanging out in the tree house, riding a mine cart, jamming out with Dixie Kong, or exploring with Rambi.&quot; 
Let&#x27;s break each of these sets down:
Donkey Kong&#x27;s Tree House Expansion Set
$59.99
555 pieces

Diddy Kong&#x27;s Mine Cart Ride Expansion Set

                              <span>When tackling direct infringers becomes impractical, rightsholders can take legal action against entities that are indirectly involved. Intermediaries and service providers are obvious targets but tend to enjoy protection under so-called &#x27;safe harbor&#x27; provisions. In Australia, digital platforms want these protections too, claiming they will boost anti-piracy cooperation. Rightsholders believe that cooperation is directly linked to a credible threat of liability.

                              <span>The Star Wars Jedi: Survivor experience on PC is, at least here on release day, a generally pleasurable Far Far Away fantasy marred by some ugly performance issues. After a few hours&#x27; worth of attempts to get it running on the Steam Deck, I can now – with a face similar to that of Ewan McGregor cry-laughing over child murder – report that Jedi: Survivor is in even worse condition on the handheld. It’s unplayable.

                              <span>With 30 million-odd pre-registrations under its belt prior to coming out, Honkai: Star Rail was always going to be a pretty big deal when it eventually launched. The turn-based anime RPG did exactly that earlier this week, and it&#x27;s already been downloaded over 20 million times in just a single day, according to a tweet from analyst Daniel Ahmad. Perhaps not surprising for a free-to-play game, but still. That&#x27;s a lot of people. I must admit, I could never quite gel with Genshin Impact, another very anime RPG made by the same developers, but Honkai&#x27;s turn-based battles look a lot more up my street. So I downloaded yesterday, which I guess makes me part of that enormous 20 million number. Are you planning on giving it a go as well?

                              <span>Hargh blargh games are bad, roguelikes are worse, whinge moan complain. It is that time once again. You know whether my complaints will bother you, so consider this a massive recommendation if they dont: Shardtide Verminp... Punktide Verminsha... Shardpunk... goddamn it. Hang on.
Shardpunk Verminfall is, as Graham reported, an excellent mash-up of several familiar games and concepts, yet doesn&#x27;t feel like a knockoff of any, or lack its own identity. I would resent it a lot less if it wasn&#x27;t also a roguelike. Even with its standard mono-save system and unlocking things and &quot;repeating the whole thing from scratch ad infinitum&quot; though, I can&#x27;t pretend I don&#x27;t enjoy it anyway.

                              <span>Valve revealed a swathe of new features coming to Steam&#x27;s desktop client beta last night, and there are lots of new features that caught my eye. They&#x27;re overhauling things like the in-game overlay, creating a new toolbar to house achievements, friends chat and discussions, and creating a new hub that shows you everything that&#x27;s happened in the game&#x27;s community since you last played it. It also introduces a cool pin feature that lets you stick overlay windows on top of your game - handy if you&#x27;re following a guide, say, and don&#x27;t want to keep alt-tabbing out. But there&#x27;s one thing I&#x27;m quite upset about, and that&#x27;s the new Notes app. I love a good notebook game, you know? Fiddling out puzzles in Tunic, remembering patterns in The Witness... Notebook games are great. But I fear this new Notes app will kill that kind of note-taking dead. And that makes me sad.

                              <span>I quite enjoy the vwing-vwing lighstabering at the heart of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, which is why it now pains me to have an extended moan about the PC version&#x27;s technical troubles. 


Despite the odd glimmer of joy, like better-than-expected performance on its lowest system requirements, much about playing Jedi: Survivor on Windows suggests it could have used a little more time in the bacta tank. Sluggishness and stuttering are problems on higher-end graphics cards, even before adding the strain of ray tracing effects, and FSR upscaling often fails to deliver a significant performance boost.

                              <span>Bloober Team and Anshar Studios have released a new Layers of Fear gameplay trailer to demonstrate the game&#x27;s performance in Unreal Engine 5. 
Layers of Fear combines the experience of the first two Layers of Fear games, as well as both games&#x27; DLC, into one single game. It will also feature a new chapter called &quot;The Final Note&quot; that gives players an alternate perspective on the first game&#x27;s story. Layers of Fear is being developed from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5. You can check out the game&#x27;s performance, as well as its new mechanics and visual enhancements, in the gameplay trailer below: 


Layers of Fear will support Ray-Tracing, HDR, and 4K resolution. Plus, it uses Lumen global illumination (you might recognize the word &quot;Lumen&quot; from Epic Games&#x27; Unreal Engine showcase back in 2021), Niagara visual effects &quot;to create particle effects in real time&quot; and Action System Controls &quot;to improve the development process and optimization of all gameplay mechanics,&quot; according to a press release. 
&quot;Creating games with Unreal Engine 5 is a great opportunity for the whole team, as it means our game development process can skyrocket in quality,&quot; Anshar Studios lead programmer Tomasz Bilnicki writes in the press release. &quot;It has an incredible power when it comes to the implementation of dynamic lighting, shadows, and potentially beautiful worlds for players to explore. We hope that – thanks to the engine – we&#x27;ll provide players with the unique, immersive, visually stunning, and atmospheric experience in graphical fidelity.&quot; 
Layers of Fear will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC in June.

                              <span>From Software, the developer behind last year&#x27;s critically acclaimed Elden Ring, announced Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon at The Game Awards 2022. Now, less than six months later, we have a release date, and it&#x27;s probably sooner than you expected. 
That&#x27;s because Armored Core VI hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on August 25, 2023. From Software announced this out of nowhere with a surprise trailer today that runs more than three minutes long. It features plenty of flashy mech action and some teases about what might be going on in this beautiful (but distraught) sci-fi world. 
Check out the new Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon is a drastic departure from the fantasy worlds of late that From Software has been creating, but this still looks decidedly From Software. And we can&#x27;t wait to check it out in just a few months. 
The trailer also reveals what you can expect from the game&#x27;s various digital editions and the special Collector&#x27;s Edition – check them both out below: 

Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon launches on August 25, 2023. While waiting to learn more, check out the reveal trailer from last December. Read about From Software&#x27;s Shadow of the Erdtree expansion for Elden Ring after that.

                              <span>Redfall, the vampire FPS from Deathloop developer Arkane Studios, is out in less than a week and to prepare players for what awaits, the team has released a new launch trailer aptly set to a cover of Soundgarden&#x27;s &quot;Black Hole Sun.&quot; 
It&#x27;s a nice cover, and it goes quite well with what&#x27;s happening in Redfall, Massachusetts, as a total eclipse has made it a haven for the game&#x27;s enemy vampires. The launch trailer itself is more of what you&#x27;d expect from a Redfall trailer – vampires, cooperative action, special abilities, and plenty of FPS gunplay. Check it out for yourself below: 


For more about Redfall, read about how the game will only launch with a Quality Mode (although a 60 FPS Performance Mode is planned for post-launch), and then read about how Microsoft canceled a PlayStation 5 version of Redfall after it acquired Arkane parent company Bethesda. Listen to our thoughts on the game after going hands-on with Redfall after that. 
Redfall launches on Xbox Series X/S and PC next Tuesday on May 2.

                              <span>I spent time last week watching old, Japanese PlayStation game adverts after puzzler Humanity referenced them in its own trailer. Among those adverts were several for Fantavision, a little-loved colour-matching puzzle game about firework displays from 2000.

                              <span>Live A Live was originally released in 1994, but only on SNES and only in Japan. It was short as far as Square Enix JRPGs from the period go, but was unique in that it featured 8 inter-connected stories set across 8 time periods. 

Last year, a remake brought the game to Nintendo Switch, and as of today it&#x27;s also available on Steam.

Might &amp; Magic: Clash Of Heroes was a surprise delight on Nintendo DS in 2009 and an HD release made its way to PC in 2011.

Now it&#x27;s getting a Definitive Edition release courtesy of Dotemu, with updated character art, quality-of-life improvements and rebalanced multiplayer.

                              <span>The Case Of The Golden Idol was one of my favourite games of 2022, but one twist I didn&#x27;t see coming from the heir to Obra Dinn&#x27;s detective crown was more of it, or more of it so soon, for that matter. Happily, developers Color Gray Games have announced a new DLC pack is coming for The Golden Idol next week called The Spider Of Lanka. Set in 1741, a year before the first scenario of The Golden Idol proper, this trio of new cases looks set to shed extra light on the titular idol whose mysterious powers set the original game in motion. I&#x27;m afraid I can&#x27;t tell you much more than that, as most of the announcement details have been slapped with big black REDACTED marks. Have a watch of the reveal trailer below instead.

Clever game mechanic, or narrative copout? Maybe both? Maybe neither? Or maybe it’s just a reason for Nate and I to gush about Titanfall 2’s singleplayer campaign while Alice considers the temporal implications of save scumming. To know the answer, you yourself must travel back to the past, specifically Tuesday, when we recorded it.

It gives us another look at the titular rural town, haunted by fanged monsters, violent cultists, and psychic anomalies that distort the environment in weird and wonderful ways.

                              <span>Armored Core 6: Fires Of Rubicon is dropping into action on August 25th, developer FromSoftware have announced. Last December, the studio most famous for Dark Souls and Elden Ring announced they were returning to their mecha action roots, and we now have the first gameplay trailer showing off those chunky mechs and huge explosions. Take a look below.

                              <span>For me, developers Deconstructeam are the GOAT at fleshing out characters through the subtle art of conversation. Whether it’s revealing the dark secrets of corporate espionage from the mouths of loose-lipped employees after a cocktail or two in The Red Strings Club, uncovering the cut-throat life of a hitman as he arranges beautiful bouquets in Eternal Home Floristry, or unravelling the personal philosophies of an old man who claims he can speak to God through a radio in Interview With A Whisperer, their games are detailed portraits of complex people. And after playing through an hour-long preview build of the team’s next game, the fresly unveiled The Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood, I can already tell that this adventure is one of their most complex portraits yet. This time, folks, we&#x27;re dealing with divination, cosmic gods and sweet, sweet revenge.

                              <span>When Firaxis first unveiled their new tactical superhero RPG Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns in August of 2021, its card-based battle system proved to be a point of contention among its audience, so much so that when the game was delayed a short while later, rumours started flying that the studio was going back to the drawing board on the game&#x27;s combat and dropping the cards entirely. 
&quot;Hah, that was wishful thinking for some people!&quot; laughs creative director Jake Solomon when I ask him at GDC how he felt about those rumours at the time. It&#x27;s well-known now that the delay was simply about polishing the game rather than anything more drastic, but to Solomon&#x27;s credit he does also concede that he was perhaps &quot;a little naïve&quot; at the time for thinking it would go down without question.

                              <span>I don&#x27;t feel very strongly about Age Of Wonders 4. But I’ll be fair; it&#x27;s definitely good.
I&#x27;ve enjoyed most of my time with it, and the parts I didn&#x27;t were probably down to caning it too hard in too short a time. Such is that reviewz lyf. Played less intensely over a longer period, I imagine more of its intricacies becoming clear, and more custom playstyles emerging to encourage more replays and challenges. As it stands though, its generally high quality and interesting systems just haven&#x27;t captured my imagination.
It is not unimaginative, though. Some of its playable races are the usual elves and goblins, but most have a twist, like the cannibalistic dwarves, gold-obsessed necromancers, or the &quot;cursed toadlings&quot; I picked almost reflexively: a people transformed along with their warrior Queen Charming. Each comes with a starting hero and traits for their cities units, plus a set of spellbooks that determine what research you&#x27;ll have access to upfront.

                              <span>“Why am I so slow”, complains my partner, minutes into being cajoled into playing Dota 2 for the very first time. “Ah, you’ll need to buy boots,” I say, with the hard earned wisdom of someone who’s spent over 4,000 hours clicking on wizards. “I have boots,” she says, somewhat indignantly. “Those are slippers,” I reply. “What?” she asks, somewhat more indignantly. “They don’t give you move speed,” I respond. I see a flicker of anger in her eyes, as well as maybe, just maybe, a spark of interest.


A new Dota patch came out last week, and it’s a biggun. Is it a good time for lapsed players to jump back in? Yes! Is it a good time for entirely new players to dip their toes in, while experienced players are still befuddled by a map that’s 40% bigger, featuring dual Roshan pits, new minibosses and a host of other changes? Perhaps! It’s certainly a good opportunity to test your relationship.

The XCOM and Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns director and designer announced he was leaving Firaxis back in February, but his final day at the studio where he made his name and worked for more than twenty years was still very fresh in his memory. &quot;It&#x27;s surreal,&quot; he says. &quot;For probably the next ten years, I&#x27;ll refer to it as &#x27;we&#x27; when we talk about Firaxis, and it&#x27;s sad to think it&#x27;s not the right pronoun anymore. It&#x27;s exciting, but a little terrifying.&quot;
On the face of it, that panic might seem unfounded. Over the last decade, Solomon has become one of the most revered names in turn-based strategy games. Having cut his teeth on many of Sid Meier&#x27;s Civilization games in his early years at Firaxis, he went on to become the designer who spearheaded the revival of XCOM with Enemy Unknown in 2012, before going on to direct its even more beloved sequel XCOM 2 and its War Of The Chosen expansion a few years later. Most recently, he was creative director on Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns, which allowed him to marry his life-long love of Marvel comic books with the thrilling tactical combat he&#x27;s so well known for. 
Solomon&#x27;s next adventure, though, won&#x27;t have the certainty of Midnight Suns&#x27; supercharged attack cards, or even the tease of an XCOM hit percentage backing him up. For not only is it Solomon&#x27;s third day of unemployment when we speak; it&#x27;s also the day after he revealed his plans to leave turn-based tactics games behind altogether. Instead, his sights are now set on the life simulation genre, a move that, at first glance, seems at odds with his career as a strategy designer. But over the course of our hour-long chat, it becomes increasingly clear that life sims have been a life-long obsession for Solomon, and he might have even made one by now had the development of XCOM 2 gone a little differently.

                              <span>Long-running sci-fi MMO Warframe has just released its biggest update yet, The Duviri Paradox, for free. Jumping into any 10-year-old game can be intimidating, especially an MMO, but developer Digital Extremes say this is the first story-driven update that’s not progression-locked based on skill level or experience with the game. In other words, this is a new experience within Warframe that’s immediately available to newcomers, while also adding weird cool stuff for old-timers.

                              <span>Forgive me, I&#x27;m someone who&#x27;s recently got a Steam Deck and I&#x27;m going through the honeymoon phase. Except it&#x27;s a phase which is unlikely to end? Anyway, it&#x27;s proven to be an excellent way to rinse Vampire Survivors, a game I wouldn&#x27;t - I have nothing against those who do -  play upright on a monitor. Survival is best served on the couch, curled up like a shrimp with the blood draining from my arms as I hold the TV slab at some atrocious angle.
Anyway, I&#x27;ve come to realise that Vampire Survivors might be a game about running away, but actually peaks when you come to a standstill. There&#x27;s a special kind of joy to be had when you&#x27;re able to stop and idle.

                              <span>After a few weeks in time limbo, Quantum Break has returned to storefronts on PC and Xbox. Publisher Microsoft had said “some licences that expired” were to blame for its removal from Game Pass (for consoles), which was probably the same reason it was pulled from storefronts too. It’s now rewound the clocks, available to buy, and as a nice bonus, it’s joined PC Game Pass for the first time since it was previously only available on the console version of the service.

The statistics are nothing short of extraordinary and measured in billions of visits per year. Fmovies, Bmovies, Bflix and 9anime are just a few of the sites causing problems for rightsholders. Despite U.S. concerns, Vietnam seems unwilling to pull the plug.

                              <span>Confession time, everyone: I&#x27;m still only about 2.5 hours into Disco Elysium. Games journalism sin or what? Somehow, despite being primed by the excellent time I had with its demo five years ago, I just bounced off this one. I very quickly got stuck in a frustrating loop of fatally ballsing up no matter what I did - presumably I badly biffed my stats right out the gate to get soft-locked in the first area - and despite deciding I&#x27;d restart in a day or two, several years later my play-time hasn&#x27;t extended past that first session. Sad times all round, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll agree, but what&#x27;s it got to do with Betrayal At Club Low?
Well, when I picked up Betrayal At Club Low for the RPS Game Club this month, I was transported back to my abortive run at Disco Elysium. It&#x27;s not that I&#x27;ve never played a stat-check-heavy RPG before. Far from it. But somehow, each game&#x27;s presentation resonated together in my weird brain mush. It must have been something to do with the combination of a surreal, seedy, not-quite-our-world-but-still-very-recognisable setting, and the constant presence of numbers reminding me of my character&#x27;s strengths stacked up against their many, many weaknesses.

                              <span>Last time, you decided that unit veterancy is better than rerolling dice. I&#x27;m not surprised, given that rerolling dice is a pretty niche thing only seen in a handful of games, but oh what a glorious niche thing! Fine, fine. We continue. This week, I ask you to choose between the mechanism for controlling magic and the mechanism for controlling a big daft rock. What&#x27;s better: cool spellcasting gestures, or seizing control of a rolling boulder trap?

                              <span>Here&#x27;s an idea! You know that 2.5-inch laptop drive that you have sitting around ever since you upgraded a year or two back? How about repurposing it as a portable SSD or HDD with this USB-C enclosure? For £6, you can give that drive a new lease on life. Your new drive will be useful too, ideal for backups, moving video files to your TV or just moving game directories between PCs. 
n.b. Face in image above is unrelated, I just wanted to fill out the space without drawing attention to the USB cables that stop at the edge. Thanks to my pal Ross for the illustration.

                              <span>In my preview of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor I said it was a competent game that essentially offered Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, but more. Playing the full thing reveals I was correct, both for better and for worse, which is why you should never doubt me. Are we done here?
Oh alright. Star Wars Jedi: Survivor is a third-person action game where you play Cal Kestis in his second rip-roaring adventure across a localised part of the galaxy, fighting both the Empire and a very naughty little Sith, with a flanking attack from Cal&#x27;s own regrets about getting people killed all the time. Crucially though, at least for the purposes of having fun, Cal has one of those hot glowsticks that goes *whummmmm* and cute robot friend BD-1 - but you will often be deploying both in the effort to get a new pair of trousers.

                              <span>My name is Katharine and I&#x27;m a reformed Pokéaddict. I thought I&#x27;d get that out there right at the start, because you can&#x27;t really talk about Cassette Beasts without talking a bit about Pokémon. Admittedly, the idea of an open world Pokémon-like might have lost some of its shine now that the actual Pokémon games have finally gone and done it themselves with last year&#x27;s Scarlet and Violet releases, but Cassette Beasts, the debut game from UK micro team Bytten Studio, is banging a different kind of drum to Nintendo&#x27;s primo monster catcher.

                              <span>A sequel to 1992’s classic action-platformer, Flashback 2 is releasing this November on PC and consoles, publisher Microids have announced. The sequel was first announced a couple of years ago with Flashback’s original creator Paul Cuisset in charge, and we finally have our first proper look at gameplay. Take a look at Flashback 2’s updated cyberpunk world below.

                              <span>Microsoft’s proposed acquisition of Activision Blizzard King has hit a large snag on the road. The UK’s Competitions And Markets Authority (CMA) previously released their provisional findings on the $69 billion buyout, laying out concerns over less competition and innovation for UK gamers. Microsoft were allowed to respond to the CMA’s findings, but it seems they weren’t able to quell the regulator’s concerns, as the CMA have now vetoed the merger.

It’s a colourful, dodgeball, tactics game from ustwo, the developers behind the perspective puzzler series Monument Valley and the environmental cleaning of Alba: A Wildlife Adventure - both very cool games. Ed enjoyed his two minutes of hands-on time last year, and with a pedigree this good, it’s probably worth checking out for fans of sleepy sports.

                              <span>A big new update to unofficial mod tools for Alien: Isolation has greatly expanded the range of mods people can make. Modders can now add custom models, materials, textures, and more to Creative Assembly&#x27;s horror shooter. To quickly demonstrate the new capabilities, the toolmaker has whipped up a small example: importing classic Counter-Strike map de_dust2 into Isolation. You can see the xenomorph stalking Dust2&#x27;s sandy corridors in a fun little video below. I imagine modders are already planning bigger, more complex, and less silly uses for these new capababilities.

This woman is something of a mystery and seems to have a flair for the dramatic as she kicks off the whole game by playing an invisible violin along to the classic Baroque epic Pachelbel’s Canon as massive, intergalactic monsters invade a spaceship.
It’s an incredibly cool opening, the kind of thing that John Wick would watch to get pumped up before, well, John Wick-ing all over the place. It’s pretty clear that Kafka isn’t a hero, but they’ve woken you up, and since you’ve got no memories, you must be one of the good guys. This setup feels familiar, but there are enough changes to make it feel new and get the blood thoroughly pumping.

Horizon Forbidden West: Burning Shores serves fans a substantial dessert that brings the main course of the campaign to a satisfying close. A dangerous new sandbox and a compelling story await Aloy, offering a nice wrap-up that also provides some tantalizing glimpses into the future. 
Unlike Zero Dawn’s Frozen Wilds DLC, which was a good but skippable side story, Burning Shores has enough relevant plot advancement to make it closer to required playing. Taking place immediately after the sequel’s conclusion, this abbreviated tale sees Aloy travel to the volcanically fra…</span>

                              <span>Join hosts Wesley LeBlanc and Kyle Hilliard as the two take a quick look at Bramble: The Mountain King, a spooky and horrific adventure game inspired by Nordic Folklore that plays like Little Nightmares. It comes from Dimfrost Studios and features gorgeous (if not terrifying) visuals and a fun loop of traversal and puzzle solving. And fortunately, you don&#x27;t have to wait long because it hits PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC tomorrow on April 27. 
If you&#x27;re wondering whether it&#x27;s a game you should pick up, check out roughly 13 minutes of new Bramble: The Mountain King footage in the latest New Gameplay Today:

                              <span>Humanity is a new puzzle game from the same publisher as Tetris Effect. In the game you, as a dog, must direct an endless stream of humans as they mindlessly walk forward. It&#x27;s up to you to make sure they reach safety. Join Charles Harte and me as we play a few puzzles (without revealing the final solutions) and make sure Humanity can live on. At least, I think that&#x27;s what the game is about.
As a bonus, the game is also fully playable in VR using PlayStation VR2, so we took the time to show off that version of the game, as well. It is functionally the same, but it&#x27;s nice to have an alternate, encompassing way to play.

If the only thought in your mind upon completing 2019’s Jedi: Fallen Order was that you wanted more, then I have excellent news. Picking up where its predecessor left off, Jedi: Survivor isn’t just more of the same but more of virtually everything, with meaningful advances and improvements across the board. It’s a longer game with greater levels of customization, more enemies, more diverse approaches to combat and puzzles, and more storytelling and character development for its compelling cast of characters.

                              <span>Flashback 2 got a fresh gameplay trailer today showing off the sequel’s modernized graphical facelift as well as a November release window.
The sequel to the influential 1992 adventure game was first announced in 2021, but we haven’t seen much of it since its last teaser at Summer Game Fest last year. Today’s video provides a look at how hero Conrad B. Hart (and his A.I.-powered weapon A.I.S.H.A.) faces off against the shapeshifting aliens known as the Morph once more. Though the action largely retains its 2D roots, the game now sports 3D levels for more depth of movement, especially during firefights. Flashback 2 is helmed by original creator Paul Cuisset alongside the development team at Microids Studio Lyon. 


Flashback 2 launches in November for PlayStation and Xbox platforms as well as Switch and PC.</span>

                              <span>Microsoft has released its financial results for Q3 of its 2023 Fiscal Year, which consists of roughly January through March of this year. In it, the company revealed that Xbox hardware revenue is down but its Xbox content and services revenue is slightly up thanks to Xbox Game Pass subscription growth. 
More specifically, Xbox hardware is down 30% and Xbox content and services is up 3%. Overall, Xbox&#x27;s gaming revenue is down 4%, though. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella says that the company set third-quarter records for monthly active users and devices, and that Xbox&#x27;s gaming subscriptions (see: Game Pass) reached almost $1 billion this quarter. Despite this growth and revenue, though, Microsoft did not release new numbers regarding Game Pass subscription count – the latest count was 25 million in January 2022. 
As for the dip in hardware revenue, Microsoft says the decline comes from the comparison of this quarter this year to the same quarter in the previous fiscal year, which gained a boost thanks to increased console supply. 
Here are some other numbers from Microsoft&#x27;s financial results: 
Revenue was $52.9 billion, an increase of 7% (or 10% in constant currency)
Operating income was $22.4 billion, an increase of 10% (or 15% in constant currency)
Net income was $18.3 billion, an increase of 9% (or 14% in constant currency)
Xbox hardware revenue is down 30%
Xbox content and services revenue is up 3%
Overall, Xbox gaming revenue is down 4%
These results arrived yesterday, shortly before the Competition and Markets Authority, a U.K. regulatory agency that serves the same purpose as the Federal Trade Commission in the U.S., blocked Microsoft&#x27;s $68.7 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard today. You can read more about that here.

The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom has the unenviable task of following what many consider to be one of the greatest games in recent memory. When it launched in 2017, Breath of the Wild revolutionized the longstanding franchise formula in innumerable ways, giving players the biggest world the series has ever featured and mechanics that allowed them to experiment with the game&#x27;s physics. After spending more than an hour playing some early moments of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, the answer to how this game plans on following such a tough act is a bit clearer.

The Competition and Markets Authority, a U.K. regulatory agency that serves the same function as the Federal Trade Commission in the U.S., has blocked Microsoft&#x27;s pending $68.7 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard over cloud gaming concerns. 
This news is somewhat shocking, as quite a few experts predicted the CMA would allow the deal to go through, and while this block presents a large barrier to Microsoft&#x27;s progress forward toward this acquisition, it&#x27;s not a be-all, end-all for the purchase. Microsoft says it remains dedicated to this acquisition and will appeal the CMA&#x27;s ruling.

“We’re so excited to officially drop our anchor in Barcelona, the hometown of my great-grandparents, and start building a strong team for our journey of exploration together with NetEase Games,&quot; Ehreth writes in the press release. &quot;Our studio’s motto is ‘Per Aspera, Ad Astra’ (‘through hardships, to the stars’) because we want to build an adventure that will stay fresh and provide a unique experience that will surprise and delight people each time they play, and I want us to acknowledge the challenges we are setting out to face. We&#x27;re grateful to NetEase Games for giving us the creative freedom and resources to build this interconnected world that will expand beyond games and reach into other mediums as well.”

Anchor Point Studios plans to develop action-adventure games for console and PC that &quot;push the boundaries of entertainment and bring elements of surprise into the gameplay.&quot;

The studio is based in Barcelona, Spain, but the team will be hiring up to 100 employees across Europe and North America, &quot;seeking developers, technical artists, and designers to work in its offices, remotely, or in a hybrid capacity.&quot; 
There&#x27;s no word on when we can expect to see or hear about the studio&#x27;s first game.</span>

                              <span>Ahead of an upcoming open playtest, Blizzard have released their latest developer design video on Diablo 4, this time tackling player choice and the action RPG’s different classes. My favourite detail is that you can become a werewolf and “do werewolf things”. Although getting to that stage may take a while, as associate game director Joseph Piepora recently said it would take around 150+ hours for an average player to hit the Level 100 cap. Sounds like a week’s worth of content then.

These units normally retail for $64.99 in the US, but today the Electric Volt colour is down to $39.99 at Walmart.

The Wasteland Theatre Company previously tackled Shakespeare and A Christmas Carol, and they&#x27;ve now reconvened with a post-apocalyptic performance of Alice In Wonderland, appropriately adapted as Alice In The Wasteland.

Regardless, it&#x27;s an extremely capable PCIe 4.0 SSD - and now it&#x27;s available for $134.99 for a 2TB model after a discount at B&amp;H Photo Video in the US. To get this price, which represents an oustanding $45 discount, you just need to add the drive to your cart - easy enough, right?

Larger space regimes require more work, so this expansion is for fans of big government, focusing on Stellaris&#x27; collection of leaders, expanding the council system, and introducing deeper character progression. It’s also adding a new Origin delving into the leader who founded your galactic empire, which you can see teased in the very short, very non-descript trailer below.

After playing the Steam demo, I can tell you that it&#x27;s one of the most charming games I&#x27;ve played all year, and it looks like I&#x27;ll be able to play the rest soon because Mail Time is out this week on Thursday April 27th.

                              <span>Owners of AMD Ryzen 7000 processors, you may wish to reconsider any overclocking plans. This hardware family may include some good gaming CPUs but several users have recently reported cases of fatal overheating, sometimes even with their processors burning the motherboard socket in the process.


Investigations by Tom’s Hardware and YouTuber der8auer suggest the culprit is SoC (system on chip) voltages being pushed beyond safe levels during memory overclocking attempts. AMD haven’t confirmed this directly, but are supposedly working on a fix that would prevent this accidental overvolting from happening again.

                              <span>To celebrate Apex Legends’ upcoming Season 17, developer Respawn have announced the newest hero to join the roster: old-timer Ballistic. The battle-royale&#x27;s last season had no new Legend, disappointing a few Apexers, but Ballistic is coming out of his comfy wine-fuelled retirement and joining the fight on May 9th, just for you guys.

                              <span>A draft law that aims to criminalize and prosecute those who &quot;create conditions for online piracy&quot; has been approved by Bulgaria&#x27;s Council of Ministers. The proposed amendments are Bulgaria&#x27;s response to heavy criticism from the United States, most publicly via the USTR&#x27;s Special 301 Reports. It&#x27;s hoped that prison sentences of up to six years will send a deterrent message.

                              <span>Funko Fusion, the mash-up co-op action game featuring a bizarre assortment of disparate properties, is the first game from 10:10 Studios. The studio was founded by TT Games veterans like Arthur Parsons, who worked as lead designer on about a dozen of TT Games&#x27; Lego games.
The game features Funko characters and worlds from Jurassic World, Back to the Future, The Umbrella Academy, The Thing, Child’s Play 2, Masters of the Universe, and other NBCUniversal properties.


Many of the properties featured in the trailer above are R-rated, and characters lose limbs and heads, use flame throwers, and get eaten by monsters. It never veers into full, non-cartoon violence, but compared to the Lego games the team worked on in the past, Funko Fusion seems like it is going for a more mature audience.

Funko Fusion is coming to consoles and PC next year.</span>

                              <span>Netflix has released the first official teaser for its upcoming season of The Witcher alongside the release dates for Volume 1 and Volume 2. 
The Witcher: Season 3 still features Henry Cavill as Geralt of Rivia but it will be his last season in the role as Netflix announced last year that Liam Hemsworth would be replacing him as the titular Witcher in Season 4. If this new Season 3 teaser is anything to go off of, Cavill&#x27;s final season as Geralt looks like a great one to go out on. We get a new look at Geralt and what might be his biggest fear, Yennefer and other mainstay characters, and most interestingly, Ciri, who appears to be running from the Wild Hunt, which were the main antagonist of the last mainline Witcher game, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. 
Check it out for yourself below in the Season 3 teaser for Netflix&#x27;s The Witcher: 


As you can see, this teaser features plenty of teases for what&#x27;s in store in Volumes 1 and 2 of the series. And speaking of volumes, this season will be the first split season for The Witcher, taking a page out of other Netflix mainstays like Stranger Things. Volume 1 will drop June 29 and Volume 2 will drop roughly a month later on July 27.

Introducing something new to me in action combat is rare. In games that feature it, you’re likely using either guns to kill enemies or melee action to take them down, and I’m not often surprised by how this can work. I can, of course, fall in love with familiar combat despite that, but it’s always exciting to experience something I haven’t before, which is what Strayed Lights manages to do.

                              <span>Just a few days away from the launch of Horizon Forbidden West&#x27;s Burning Shores DLC last week, Guerrilla Games has teased more adventures with Aloy. 
This news comes from a statement released by the studio to announce that studio director and executive producer Angie Smets is leaving Guerrilla to serve as the head of development strategy for PlayStation Studios. It&#x27;s a move similar to the one the team&#x27;s former managing director, Hermen Hulst, made in 2019, transitioning from that director position to head of Sony Interactive Entertainment Worldwide Studios. 


Within that statement, Guerrilla teases what could be Horizon 3 or at least, a third game in Aloy&#x27;s world, as reported by PlayStation Lifestyle. 
&quot;We have full confidence in our new leadership as they steer Guerrilla towards a bright future, expanding the world of Horizon with Aloy&#x27;s next adventure and our exciting online project,&quot; the statement reads. 
As you can see, Guerrilla isn&#x27;t trying to hide it – the studio has plans for another adventure with Aloy. And while rumors and speculation point to the &quot;exciting online project&quot; being some kind of multiplayer game within the Horizon world, this statement made sure to separate Aloy&#x27;s next adventure and that online project. 
In terms of the studio&#x27;s new makeup, the management team now consists of studio and production director Joel Eschler, studio director and general manager Hella Schmidt, and studio and art director Jan-Bart van Beek. Technical director Michiel van der Lee will &quot;be focusing on the future technology and strategy for the Decima engine.&quot; 
This statement also includes some words from Smets, who leaves Guerrilla after &quot;an incredible 20 years&quot; there:

                              <span>Super Replay returns, and we&#x27;re checking out Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts &amp; Bolts! Join us today Friday on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central as we kick of the adventure, which will continue each week until we roll credits. We&#x27;ll also have every episode available the next day on our Game Informer Shows YouTube Channel. 
Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts &amp; Bolts was released for the Xbox 360 on November 11, 2008. The third (and, so far, final) entry in Rare&#x27;s beloved platforming series centers on vehicle creation, where players collect and slap together hundreds of parts to assemble their own wacky contraptions to explore. The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will I land on it? Let&#x27;s find out.
Join me, Marcus Stewart, alongside Kyle Hilliard as we explore one of the Xbox 360&#x27;s biggest hidden gems to see whether it holds up or falls apart like a poorly constructed doohickey.

                              <span>PlayStation has acquired Firewalk Studios.
The company announced this on a new PlayStation Blog, noting that it&#x27;s been in a publishing partnership with Firewalk Studios and ProbablyMonsters since 2021 and that it&#x27;s now happy to expand that relationship by bringing the studio under the PlayStation umbrella. The studio has been working on its &quot;first original AAA multiplayer game&quot; for PlayStation and it sounds like development on that will continue. 
&quot;Since announcing our publishing partnership with ProbablyMonsters and Firewalk in 2021, we continue to be impressed by the team&#x27;s ambitions to build a modern multiplayer game that connects players in new and innovative ways,&quot; Head of PlayStation Hermen Hulst writes in the blog. &quot;The studio shares our passion for creating inspiring worlds grounde…</span>

                              <span>One of the most exciting and mysterious elements of Street Fighter 6 has been a World Tour, a single-player open-world exploration mode Capcom had previously only shown glimpses of. Thankfully, today’s Street Fighter 6 Showcase finally pulled the curtain back on what World Tour entails and it looks delightfully bonkers.
World Tour begins with players creation a custom fighter that serves as the mode’s protagonist. Upon creating your avatar (which can be used outside of World Tour in the online Battle Hub), you’re dropped into Metro City from the Final Fight series, one of the World Tour’s many explorable city hubs. Other destinations include the developing Asian city, Nayshall. 
As a fledgling fighter, you’ll embark on a quest to become a world warrior. You’ll accomplish this completing qu…</span>

                              <span>Much like its predecessor, Street Fighter 6 will have an ambitious post-release content plan. While we knew there would be downloadable content, we now have a much better idea about the cadence with which the new characters will arrive.
&quot;A big part of Street Fighter&#x27;s charm is the cast of characters from around the world that appear in each game,&quot; executive producer Shuhei Matsumoto said during today&#x27;s Street Fighter 6 Showcase livestream. &quot;We believe that Street Fighter is where players can take control of unique characters with their own awesome fighting styles. For the players – and for us as well – the appeal of the characters themselves is the most important element of the series. With Street Fighter 6, we&#x27;re continuing development to deliver new characters to you every year.&quot;
During Year 1, which kicks off when the game launches, we will receive four new characters to the Street Fighter 6 roster. Rashid, A.K.I., Ed, and Akuma are the characters who will be made available during this first year of content. Rashid, who debuted in the base version of Street Fighter V, arrives in summer 2023. A.K.I., an all-new character, will arrive in fall 2023. Ed, who debuted in Street Fighter IV but was first playable in Street Fighter V, arrives in the early parts of 2024. Akuma, the Great Demon who first appeared in Super Street Fighter II Turbo, joins Street Fighter 6 in spring 2024. These characters will also appear in World Tour, the single-player RPG-inspired story mode, giving players some insight into their backgrounds.
If you buy either the Deluxe ot Ultimate Editions, you get the Year 1 characters included in that version. Street Fighter 6 arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC on June 2. For more on the game, check out our exclusive coverage hub here.</span>

                              <span>HeR Interactive’s The Vampire Diaries and Nancy Drew: Secrets Can Kill are now ready for testing in ScummVM!
The Vampire Diaries follows Elena Gilbert, a high school student who discovers vampires are living in her hometown after one of them attacks her younger sister. The game is loosely based on the book series of the same name by author L. J. Smith, which later got adapted into a hit TV series.
Nancy Drew: Secrets Can Kill is the first installment of the long-running Nancy Drew game series, also based on a book series of the same name. In her first adventure, Nancy seeks to uncover the killer of a high school student who seems to have been disliked by all of his classmates.
You will need the data files from the games’ original install CDs, and a fresh daily build of ScummVM. Apart from the original release, Secrets Can Kill’s Russian translation is also supported. The ScummVM wiki pages for The Vampire Diaries and Nancy Drew: Secrets Can Kill contain information on which datafiles are needed. Please, report any problems you encounter in our issue tracker.

                              <span>OpenTTD 13.0 has been out for two months and we’ve found some bugs to fix. Most notably, we’ve fixed two kinds of crashes: Road vehicles inside multi-track level crossings no longer crash into the side of trains. The game no longer crashes when a spectator in a network game tries to interact with a town’s local authority. For NewGRF authors using the new engine variant feature introduced in 13.0, we’ve added a callback to select how the engine’s name is displayed in the buy menu. As always, there are plenty of other bugfixes, which you can find in the changelog. Download Changelog Bug tracker</span>

                              <span>We are proud to announce that network-enabled Humongous Entertainment titles are now playable online! Anyone who has a copy of Backyard Football, Backyard Baseball 2001, and even Backyard Football 2002 (which was originally a LAN-only title) can download the latest daily build* of ScummVM and play online games against real people!
This all became possible because the three developers from the Backyard Sports Online fork had joined the team and brought their services with them to the ScummVM. These are LittleToonCat, Jim “jibbodahibbo” Westerkamp and Sam “QuestionMonkey” Kupfer.
Please note that Backyard Football and Backyard Baseball 2001 require online accounts for the complete online experience, so you need to register to Backyard Sports Online, which is our fantastic online-play service and a thriving community of fellow Backyard Sports players, they even have a couple of competitive online Baseball and Football leagues, if that&#x27;s your style, you can find more information in their Discord server! People who already have a Backyard Sports Online account can log in using the latest daily build and play, but if you do not, you can register right here! This is not required to play Backyard Football 2002 online.
If you encounter any issues playing online, please let us know via the issue tracker.
This fantastic art is done by a fellow BSO community member Peppyrus.
* only the Windows, macOS, Debian, Raspberry Pi, and Android builds are compatible with network play at the moment. And only the 2.8.x branch of ScummVM has this functionality.
