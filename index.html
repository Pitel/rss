                              <span>DQX Offline localisation rumours resurfaced this week.
Dragon Quest has already been in the headlines this week after new trailer uploads for Dragon Quest X Offline appeared on YouTube, and now, Square Enix producer and director Yosuke Saito appears to be teasing something.
According to a translation of a social media post (via Eurogamer), he&#x27;s recently had a &quot;fun recording session&quot; at work, and apparently more will be revealed once it&#x27;s all been finalised and approved. What&#x27;s really got fans excited is a photo attached to this post showing off a script.

Hello, and welcome back to another edition of Box Art Brawl, folks!
Before we get cracking, let&#x27;s take a peek at what went down last week. The delightful Wario Land: Shake It! entered the ring with a classic three-way brawl. It was, expectedly, a tense battle, but the European design took home the rhetorical trophy after landing 44% of the vote. North America came in second place with 32% and Japan in third place with 23%.

Capcom shared its latest earning results earlier this week, and as part of this, it&#x27;s also published a Q&amp;A revealing its intentions to release a &quot;major&quot; unannounced title early next year.
As highlighted by fans of the Japanese company, this game will arrive before the end of its current fiscal year, which is set to end in March 2024. The same title will apparently help the Japanese company reach its end-of-year sales targets, but there&#x27;s no information beyond this.

Time Extension recently got the chance to speak to Coleco exec Bert Reiner about the history of the American toy and console maker. According to his account, there was a time when Nintendo almost ended up buying and marketing the 1982 video game system &#x27;ColecoVision&#x27; for Japan but negotiations fell through.
The former Coleco vice president of product development claims Nintendo wanted to do its own deal, and eventually, it got to the point where its company president Hiroshi Yamauchi said Nintendo would develop its own console. This exchange was followed by the launch of the Famicom in 1983.

                              <span>There was a time when print media and pixel art were like peanut butter and jelly. Before the advent of polygon-based graphics and online storefronts, nearly every game was made from chunky grids of color, and at retail, every game came with a printed instruction manual showing how to play it.


Flash forward to 2023, and the bulk of the world&#x27;s biggest games are molded from three-dimensional shapes and are downloaded directly to hard drives. The mosaic beauty of dot art, and the tactile experience of turning a page in a book about that art, have both become niche enterprises. 


But if there&#x27;s one thing we&#x27;ve learned in games over the years, it&#x27;s that even the tiniest niches can find ways to thrive. Believe it or not, even the mighty Minecraft was once a humble indie game only known to industry enthusiasts and insiders. And it&#x27;s possible that Waneella, who contributed environmental art to games like River City Girls and Pocket Rumble, could break through in a similar way. She may not have her stuff sold in the toy section of Target any time soon, but I could see her work blowing up in the fine art world in the years to come. 


Decade is a new book from talented pixel artist Waneela





A case in point is her current collaboration with Darren Wall (Read-only Memory, A Profound Waste of Time) on &quot;Decade,&quot; an artbook that collects ten years of her still pictures. Initially inspired by the pixel art of Superbrothers Sword and Sworcery EP, Waneella has since grown in popularity as an independent creator. Her compositions translate great to glowing screens, but bringing them to books makes even more sense. It&#x27;s easy to picture people from all walks of life cozying up to a warm mug of the drink of their choice, cracking open her book, and being transported to places that sit somewhere between games and the real world, dreams, and reality. 


You can find the Volume crowdfunding effort for it here!

9. Gekko (MGS4)


Features: The Gekko units don&#x27;t require a pilot and can work as a team.


The Gekkos are very disappointing from a design standpoint. They&#x27;re the legs of Metal Gear RAY stitched to the torso of REX but without the charisma of either model.


Metal Gear Solid 2 began by introducing Metal Gear RAY, which owns, and then went on to introduce Arsenal Gear, an even bigger and crazier Metal Gear. The Gekko was the first new Metal Gear model introduced in Metal Gear Solid 4. The Gekko isn&#x27;t very impressive, so I kept waiting for some wilder threat to show up. Nothing e…</span>

                              <span>In the early to mid 2000s, it was popular to turn every survival horror game into a movie. Resident Evil, Silent Hill, and… OK, maybe there weren’t that many actually. In recent years, the tables have turned with iconic horror films like Friday the 13th and Texas Chainsaw Massacre, both receiving video game adaptations. This begs the question, what other horror movies deserve their own game?


Horror movies that should definitively have a video game

#10 - Tusk (2014)

Soon I’ll be able to put that hypothesis to the test, as the next game from the creators of shopkeeping-sim-turned-dungeon-diver Moonlighter looks to throw endless horrors at your custom-made grand design.

At one end of the Pokémon character design spectrum, you have some of the cutest little guys to have ever graced our screens. On the other, you have pure, unapologetic nightmare fuel. As we approach Halloween, it seems only fitting that we take a look at the latter, right?
Okay, perhaps delving into the complete horrors of the Pokédex would be stretching things too far (and we have already considered which &#x27;mon would be the tastiest in the past if you&#x27;re really after some horror), but spookiest... now that&#x27;s another question entirely. These guys are not necessarily the most terrifying to look at (you won&#x27;t find any Guzzlord, Mawile, or Machamp in his black little pants here) nor are they the ones with objectively the most worrying abilities (sorry, Mr. Mime.

Update: With Mario Party 3 now available on Nintendo Switch Online&#x27;s Expansion Pack, we&#x27;re republishing this list to celebrate. Let&#x27;s-a-go!

If you had a Nintendo 64, there&#x27;s no doubt you managed to wrangle your family (or friends) in for a few games of a few multiplayer games featuring the Italian plumber at Christmas. But, of all of them, Mario Party may have spawned a few too many arguments that have spawned an amusing life-long legacy of familial rivalries and blistered hands.

This week, we asked you what&#x27;s your favourite version of Super Mario Bros. 3 in honour of its 35th anniversary, a group of us NL writers had a good old natter about Super Mario Bros. Wonder, we chewed over the most difficult Mario games and we jumped for joy as Mario Party 3 was finally added to NSO. It&#x27;s a lot of Mario, yes, but can you blame us?

In addition to this are new survivor skins including Cheelai, Lemo, Bulma (Snow Gear) and Mr. Satan. This skin is available via Dragon Tier and the rest will be unlockable with TP Tokens. In the trailer above you can also spot a Gogeta cameo!

That plan has changed. Dreamlight Valley will leave early access on December 5th but will remain a paid-for game.

                              <span>If you love The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker but wish it had more blood, death and inclement weather in it, consider Sands of Aura. Released out of early access today, this is a top-down fantasy action-RPG set in a swirling, post-apocalyptic world in which you build up a town and sail between island dungeons in a sandship.
The sandship, or rather, &quot;grainwake&quot; sailing sees you bouncing merrily from dunes as vast, ominous structures loom out of the haze. The combat takes some inspiration from the Souls games, but the top-down perspective makes it feel like a classic arcade action title. Boss battles involve dodging or parrying colourful streaks, waves and clusters of projectiles. The developers, 12-person Chashu Entertainment, say it&#x27;s a difficult experience. It looks it.

Today we&#x27;re going one better, with a 27-inch model that costs just $160 with free shipping from Monoprice. The Dark Matter 27-inch monitor is one we&#x27;ve recommended before, and though it lacks the Fast IPS panel we prefer it&#x27;s still a solid option at this incredibly competitive price point.

                              <span>After spending hours poring over Alan Wake 2 this week, corkboards full of photos, red string and important little clue nuggets have definitely been on my brain. Alas, Remedy&#x27;s horror-fuelled detective &#x27;em up keeps its problem-solving a little too much at arm&#x27;s length for my tastes. Every piece of evidence you collect has its own set place on the board, for example, and heck, even the thrill of joining the dots with a set of pins and string is taken away from you, as its deduction work is all swept up in a wave of automation. 
Happily, other developers are stepping in to fill that string-based gap, and chief among them is the French-made Chronique Des Silencieux, whose Steam demo I played over lunch today. You play as a rookie detective in this charming point and click game, and your entire raison d&#x27;etre is to point out contradictions Phoenix Wright-style between testimonies you gather and the evidence you accumulate. Only instead of shouting, &quot;Objection!&quot; you do it by manually sticking pins and red string between the offending bits of information. It&#x27;s delightful, and well worth a nose if old Alan leaves you wanting this weekend.

                              <span>Capcom have unveiled the next generation of their in-house RE Engine, which came in alongside Resident Evil 7 in 2017 and has been used by a bunch of projects over the years, from the excellent Devil May Cry 5 to the forthcoming possibly-excellent Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2. RE Engine&#x27;s successor, the REX engine, is a response to three things - 1) RE Engine productions getting bigger in terms of assets, and more diverse in terms of genre, 2) RE Engine games being increasingly made by overseas developers who speak different languages, and 3) unflattering comparisons with various commercial tools, like Unreal Engine and Unity.

                              <span>I lost my way with Lunacid last year, early on after stumbling through a small warren of spongey enemies. Trying it again this week rewarded my patience and taught me that I&#x27;d had the tool I needed all along, but dismissed them because it didn&#x27;t work immediately. Playing beyond that has elevated it from &quot;not my thing but I should cover it because it&#x27;s someone else&#x27;s&quot; to &quot;wait, this might be my thing? Damn it&quot;.

                              <span>I&#x27;m braving the long dark of Moria, and the major dilemma at present is that I can&#x27;t line up my feasting table with my hearthfire. In Free Range Games&#x27;s plucky dungeon sim The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria, you&#x27;re a dwarf trying to reclaim the once-proud undercity of Khazad-dûm, tunnelling between procedurally generated networks of halls and crafting your own havens and upgrade facilities from long-wrecked forges and mansions. 


 The game is set after Sauron&#x27;s defeat at the end of The Return of the King novel (spoilers, I guess?), at a time in Middle-earth canon when most of the big names were busy shaking hands and doling out promotions, but there are still plenty of orcs, trolls and other threats to worry about in Moria. Right now, though, the real headache is that I can&#x27;t make my base of operations symmetrical.

                              <span>Earlier this week, Square Enix decided to ruin over a decade&#x27;s worth of CD collecting by sticking all of their incredible Final Fantasy Piano Collection soundtracks online, for free, on pretty much every streaming service imaginable. The sheer cheek of it! Honestly, I&#x27;m still mildly shocked by it all. Just the thought of all that brilliant music, available to everyone, for zero pence and import fees. What an outstanding gift to the world. (Well, the real gift would be re-printing the fabled Final Fantasy X-2 Piano Collections CD and/or sticking that online as well, if you ask me, but hey, I&#x27;ll allow them this one little omission). 
After all, there&#x27;s an absolute treasure trove of music you lucky lot get to dig into now, so if you&#x27;re wondering where to start or just fancy yet another guided tour through some of Final Fantasy&#x27;s best music tracks, allow me to forcibly volunteer myself to regale you with some of my personal favourite highlights.

                              <span>The psychiatrist Viktor E. Frankl posited that humans are motivated, above almost all else, to search for meaning in their lives. He would probably be unsurprised, if more than slightly confused, to see that spirit manifest in a rumour that the rubbish performance of Cities: Skylines 2 is being caused by excessive teeth.


A widely-shared reddit post suggests that rendering the highly detailed chompers of Skylines 2’s citizenry, who lack the LOD (level of detail) implementation that would reduce their model quality at a distance, is a major cause behind the game’s inability to pump out frames per second. Developers Colossal Order disagree, and have put out a statement denying this &quot;bizarre story.&quot;

                              <span>You can probably guess what’s coming. Alan Wake 2’s PC performance has been the subject of nervous uh oh-ing since well before the release of its onerous system requirements; Remedy comms director Thomas Puha even implored players to &quot;look at the image quality&quot; instead of framerates, like Dean Learner exalting the storytelling of Punch of Judy.
Actually, that’s not fair. Alan Wake 2 is much more enjoyable than Punch and Judy. And, like Remedyverse predecessor Control, there is something impressive about just how much visual tech you can choose to put on show: ray tracing, path tracing, Nvidia Ray Reconstruction, frame generation via DLSS 3, the lot. This wealth of options has produced the most intricate settings guides I’ve put together in ages, and you can consult it yourself lower down this page.

                              <span>Crytek&#x27;s Hunt: Showdown may yet receive a single-player campaign, if the stars align, as the developers dig ever deeper into the asymmetrical multiplayer shooter&#x27;s wonderfully plague-ridden narrative backdrop. Originally released out of Steam and Xbox early access in 2019, the game introduced single player PvE trials back in June 2020, much to Alice0&#x27;s enthusiasm. It also now sports a scripted, voiced tutorial in which you stalk around farmhouses, learning the ropes and murdering wooden dummies at the behest of a leathery dude in the bushes. Could some kind of proper story component follow? Crytek have certainly thought about it.

                              <span>You haven&#x27;t even downloaded Remedy&#x27;s Alan Wake 2 yet, assuming you&#x27;re planning to, which means it&#x27;s already time to start thinking about what you&#x27;ll do once you&#x27;ve finished it. Apologies, the news beat is a cruel mistress and the present is always past, but in my defence, jumping irresponsibly around the timeline does make sense for a supernatural horror game that follows two characters through different dimensions.
Remedy&#x27;s plans for the game include a chunky New Game+ mode, aka &quot;Final Draft&quot;, which will hopefully arrive in late November, and two DLC packs, Night Springs and The Lake House. The first concerns Alan Wake&#x27;s fictional in-game TV show, a homage to the Twilight Zone, while the second involves &quot;an independent government organization&quot; that can surely only be the Federal Bureau of Control.

                              <span>Since Insomanic revealed its Wolverine game two years ago, fans have wondered if it’s set in the same universe as the studio’s Spider-Man games. In an interview with Kinda Funny, Spider-Man 2 director Bryan Intihar confirmed the answer is yes
When host Greg Miller asked if it had been previously confirmed or denied whether or not their spin on Wolverine shared the same Earth as its Spider-Men, Intihar replied by saying, “They’re all 1048. I think I got that right, but yeah.” Inthiar is referring to Earth-1048, which is the designation for the Marvel universe Insonmiac’s superhero games occupy.
You can watch the clip beginning at the 1:10:44 mark (thanks IGN). 


Whether or not that means we’ll see any Spider-Man references in Wolverine, which does not have a release window, remains to be seen, but that’s exciting news regardless. Marvel’s Spider-Man’s New York City is chock full of references to other heroes, such as Avengers Tower, the Sanctum Sanctorum, and the Wakandan Embassy, so it made more sense to imagine Logan doing his thing somewhere out there.
Beyond this update, we know little about Wolverine other than that it will be a mature-rated title exclusive to the PlayStation 5. As we wait to learn more details, you can read this opinion piece on why I&#x27;d like to see the two game series share the same universe.</span>

A target appears on your back when you’re a long-reigning champ. No longer the enigma you once were, contenders begin studying your body of work to figure out the path to ending your time at the top. The best way to fend off would-be challengers is to continually build and evolve. Developer EA Vancouver seems to understand this because while no legitimate contenders have emerged in the mixed-martial-arts genre, EA Sports UFC 5 retools several key areas to show the franchise isn’t resting on its laurels.
Like its predecessors, UFC 5 apt…</span>

                              <span>A new gameplay video for Little Nightmares III offers a lengthy look at its two-player cooperative gameplay. Like the previous games, this third outing looks every bit as moody and unsettling. 
This pre-alpha footage shows playable characters, Low and Alone, exploring The Necropolis, a desert-like zone, working together to overcome its many obstacles. For example, when attacked by flying beetles, one shoots them down with a bow while the other smashes the downed targets with a wrench. The kids’ biggest threat, at least in this slice, comes in the form of a giant, rampaging doll aptly known as &quot;Monster Baby&quot;. It’s supremely creepy, and you can see for yourself below.


Unlike the first two games, which were developed by Tarsier Studios, Little Nightmares III is being made by Supermassive Games, makers of Until Dawn and The Dark Pictures Anthology. It’s scheduled to launch next year for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.</span>

                              <span>Before Insomniac created its stellar Spider-Man trilogy and before Treyarch redefined web-swinging with the 2004 Spider-Man 2 movie tie-in game, the folks at Neversoft gave Spidey fans the best example of wall-crawling video game excellence with its 2000 take on the character. Spider-Man sees the friendly neighborhood hero battle a star-studded gallery of villains in an original adventure chock full of comic book goodness. As Spider-Man&#x27;s first fully 3D action-adventure game, it laid the groundwork for mechanics such as web-swinging, a variety of web shooter attacks, and wall-crawling stealth gameplay. Let&#x27;s see how it holds up 23 years later.

The annual event attracts thousands of horror and theme park enthusiasts every September to experience a park that transforms into a twisted, macabre version of itself at dusk all the way up to Halloween.

                              <span>After weeks of in-game teases and more, Epic Games has officially confirmed that the next season of Fortnite will bring players back to Chapter 1. With Fortnite loading screens hiding secret dates that point to Chapter 1: Season 5 and props from that season landing on this current season&#x27;s map, players have remain convinced that the next season, Chapter 4: Season 5 will actually bring everyone back to an older chapter of Fortnite; now we know it&#x27;s happening. 
Today&#x27;s reveal comes by way of the official Fortnite Twitter account, which posted, &quot;Sprint (or Mantle, your choice) back to Chapter 1...see you soon 11.3.2023 #FortniteOG&quot; with an image of the Fortnite battle bus.

As you can see, the above Tweet confirms what many have been speculating: Fortnite is going back to its Chapter 1 roots. And while not officially confirmed, it&#x27;s likely the Chapter 4: Season 5 map will have some Chapter 1: Season 5 integration on it based on teases over the past few weeks. 
Fortnite Chapter 4: Season 5 launches November 3.

                              <span>Earlier this year, Atari announced that it acquired Berzerk, its sequel Frenzy, and 10 other classic arcade properties. Then, earlier this month, Atari revealed Berzerk: Recharged, the first Berzerk game since the original 1980s arcade game. At the time, the company said it was coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC, and now we know exactly when: November 9. 
&quot;On November 9, Evil Otto once again invites you to his maze of maniacal chaos in the newly reimagined Berzerk: Recharged,&quot; an Atari press release reads. &quot;The latest entry in Atari&#x27;s acclaimed Recharged series, Berzerk: Recharged will have you almost begging for mercy as you face off against Otto&#x27;s droves of robotic menaces, all while the grinning incarnation of evil draws ever nearer.&quot; 
Alongside this release date news, Atari has released some additional Berzerk: Recharged screenshots you can check out below:

                              <span>Yesterday was a great day for fans of the most emo Batman in the Caped Crusader&#x27;s cinematic history because Robert Pattinson&#x27;s suit from The Batman was seemingly added to Batman: Arkham Knight. But the fun was fleeting because just a few hours later, the suit was removed.
Strangely, the suit, which first appeared in director Matt Reeve&#x27;s 2022 The Batman, was only available in the Epic Games Store version of Arkham Knight, as noticed by GeekVibesNation on Twitter and verified by GameSpot; Game Informer was not able to check the game for the suit before it was removed.

At first, fans thought the suit was a well-made mod making the rounds online before more and more people realized it was actually added. As for why it was added, nobody knows, but Game Informer reached out to Warner Bros. Games to ask about the suit and will update this story if we learn more. 
The Batman suit joins a plethora of other movie suits already in Arkham Knight, like Michael Keaton&#x27;s from the 1989 film, Batman, or Christian Bale&#x27;s from The Dark Knight. Here&#x27;s hoping The Batman suit returns soon because if screenshots players have captured are any indication, it fits right in with the dark Gotham of Arkham Knight. 
While we all wait to learn more, read Game Informer&#x27;s reviews of Arkham Asylum, Arkham City, and Arkham Knight. After that, read Game Informer&#x27;s Batman: Arkham Origins review, which is a game that just celebrated its 10-year anniversary this week.

                              <span>The first Alan Wake game was released 13 years ago, in 2010. As is the case with any cult game, new fans have been discovering it in the years since, and a recent remaster means many more have likely played the game recently. For those who played it when it came out, however, jumping into Alan Wake 2 can be confusing. The list below outlines a handful of characters worth remembering before diving into the ocean that’s not a lake.
I fully acknowledge that simply being reminded of a character with the knowledge that they will be relevant to the sequel could be conceived as a spoiler. Some of the characters below appear in person, some only in passing in documents, but they are the ones that forced me to pause the game and do a quick Google. No major story elements of Alan Wake 2 are spoiled,…</span>

                              <span>In this week&#x27;s episode of The Game Informer Show, I&#x27;ve assembled a panel of experts – including Blake Hester and Charles Harte – to discuss Alan Wake 2, the 13-year follow-up to Remedy Entertainment&#x27;s cult classic thriller. After Charles gives the rest of us a refresher on all things Alan Wake, Blake regales us with his favorite non-spoiler moments from many hours into the newly-released sequel. Later, we talk about the written and physical comedy of Super Mario Bros. Wonder and how web gliding is a game changer in Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2.
Stick around &#x27;til the end of the show for a series of listener questions about soulmates, the afterlife, and the best years in gaming.

                              <span>I sincerely don’t envy the position Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth is in.


The middle entry of a trilogy is always a precarious thing. On one hand, it lacks the opening act to introduce the cast and get players excited for the story. At the same time, middle entries also can’t culminate in the story’s ultimate climax. Combine that with being part of a remake of one of the most beloved RPGs of all time, and you have a game that really needs to come prepared to impress. After all, Final Fantasy 7 Remake already indulged us in seeing Cloud and friends in glorious HD. Can Rebirth leave a lasting impression after that novelty has worn off?


In search of an answer to this question, I attended an event hosted by Square Enix to play some of Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth for myself. This demo took me through …</span>

                              <span>Nintendo recently got competitive fans of its various franchises riled up after releasing a list of strict guidelines for community tournaments. 


The gaming giant posted their new tournament guidelines on their respective websites in Japan, the U.K. and the U.S. on Tuesday. Since the announcement on October 24, fans have taken to the streets (of Twitter) to express their dismay.


The guidelines in question


After looking over the guidelines, it is clear that several facilitate fiscal policy. Some of the other guidelines put emphasis on the number of players who were allowed to participate.


Here are a few of the guidelines that stood out to fans:



Community tournaments may not “generate commercial revenue except as permitted by these guidelines”


Only 200 players can participate fo…</span>

                              <span>I met the man who would become my husband at about the time that I started venturing more into horror games. I had just discovered that a switch had flipped in my head, and I was now immune to video game scares. 


He suggested Fatal Frame to me, insisting that it was the scariest game ever made. He even went as far as buying me a copy of it for Xbox. It was my introduction to the series, but the first game I wound up completing was Fatal Frame: Mask of the Lunar Eclipse for my review right here on Destructoid. I didn’t complete it back in 2016 in my first experience with it.


There were a few reasons for why I dropped it, but they’re pretty boring. Being scary wasn’t one of them. Though, its controls are horrifying for a different reason.

                              <span>It looks like Gameloft’s Disney Dreamlight Valley won’t be a free-to-play title after all. 


Dreamlight Valley is the Disney meets Animal Crossing game that entered Early Access back in September. Players could get in the game by purchasing a Founder’s Pack. Each pack included some cosmetic items and varying amounts of Moonstones, the game’s premium currency. 


The game is set to officially launch on December 5. Ahead of the full release, Gameloft has made an announcement ending the free-to-play plans. “As we look ahead to the official launch, with the learnings we&#x27;ve gained from Early Access, we’ve made the decision to remain a paid game for the foreseeable future,” the developer wrote.

                              <span>The Tekken series is renowned across the world, and Tekken Tag Tournament is one of the most memorable titles in the series.


Why is it so special? Well, you can switch characters mid-combo, giving the 3D fighting formula a nice kick in the pants; but funnily enough, it only took Namco two months to develop the game (according to Tekken steward Katsuhiro Harada).




“The project took 5 minutes to plan and only 2 months to develop (arcade version),&quot; said Harada recently on social media. Harada says the game &quot;made a considerable profit&quot; because the cost was low. To add more context, Tekken 3 was completed, and then management at Namco &quot;ordered [Harada] to release&quot; a 3.5 version &quot;within six months.&quot; At the time, the team was working on a prototype for Tekken 4, which was eventually released…</span>

                              <span>Licensed games have tried their damnedest to nail the original theme songs and other aspects of film scores. Horror games are no different, and we&#x27;ve seen plenty of successful examples over the years. 


Going as far back as the tinny notes of Halloween on Atari 2600, there&#x27;s something about the limitations that make these soundtracks even creepier. Without access to orchestration or even proper synths, retro horror games have held on to a unique kind of spookiness. They&#x27;re equal parts charming and, in some cases, manage to nail the vibe of their source material without carrying over every single note. In honor of those unusual, haunting melodies, we&#x27;ll take a moment to touch on a handful of them.

                              <span>I can’t remember the last time I was as upset with a game as I am with Sonic Superstars.


I don’t talk about this enough, but growing up, I was a bit of a Sonic kid. There was a time when I considered Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles one of the greatest games of all time, and I’ve continued to appreciate it as time goes on. That title wasn’t just great because of its finely tuned platforming mixed with breakneck speed. It also offered memorable levels, amazing music, unique characters that offered replay incentive, and a story with twists and turns told without words.


Sonic games, at their best, are legendary. And when Sonic Mania came out back in 2017, the potential for another golden age of 2D Sonic games seemed tantalizingly real.


That brings us to Sonic Superstars, which has the key ingredients…</span>

                              <span>The Creative side of Fortnite just got a new experience, courtesy of developer Torus Games and publisher Starbreeze Entertainment. Turtle vs Turtle sets two teams on top of moving platforms and puts them in a battle of base destruction. 


Turtle vs Turtle is essentially the Fortnite that you know and love with a slightly different hook. The game supports two teams of up to eight players. Each team gets a moving platform, and team members need to get to work building defenses and turrets. The goal is to keep your own platform stable and on the move while blasting your opponents’ to bits. 


Bill McIntosh, CEO of Torus Games (LEGO 2K Drive, World War Z) released a statement saying: “Creating Turtle vs Turtle has been an exhilarating journey for us at Torus Games, and the support from Starbreeze has been pivotal in bringing our vision to life.” 


Starbreeze Entertainment, mostly a live service games publisher with titles like Roboquest and Payday 3, will be supporting Torus on Turtle vs Turtle as the game continues to evolve.

Creative 2.0


The game was built using Unreal Editor for Fortnite as part of the Creative system, which Epic released in March 2023. The toolset lets developers create new games inside Fortnite. It also lets them cash in on their work. Each month Epic pays a portion of its Fortnite revenue to creators based on player engagement with their games.


Starbreeze&#x27;s other recent live service release, Payday 3, debuted in September to mostly negative reception. Fans ran into frequent matchmaking problems and were frustrated by the game’s need for an internet connection even during solo play. An update addressing some of the issues has faced multiple delays.


Turtle vs Turtle has a solid foundation as part of the Fortnite ecosystem, but Payday 3&#x27;s rough start might make some reluctant to give it a shot.

                              <span>Ah, Unity. Truly a textbook case of how some companies are so far removed from reality, that they make Elon Musk look relatable. The fiasco surrounding the borderline offensive Runtime Fee not only pissed off developers, but apparently even staff members didn&#x27;t approve of it.


According to a report from Mobilegamer.biz (via Eurogamer), sources at Unity itself say that there was &quot;resistance to the Runtime Fee idea,&quot; but concerns were said to have been ignored. It goes on to say that some people at the company weren&#x27;t even aware of the new pricing system.




On top of that, insiders also claim that the controversial policy was &quot;rushed out&quot; and was &quot;driven by Unity and IronSource’s intense battle with Applovin over the mediation business.&quot; It&#x27;s even been claimed that one mobile game publisher told former CEO John Riccitiello, &quot;F**k you, we’re not paying.&quot;


Unity has been rather quiet lately


For those who aren&#x27;t aware, it was revealed not long ago that Unity would be introducing a new pricing structure. In a nutshell: it would require developers who use the company&#x27;s engine to create games would need to pay a fee per user installation.


As you can imagine, the backlash was quite severe. Many indie developers took immense exception to having to pay money every time someone installed their game. At the original point of the policy being announced, there was no indication of how Unity would handle illegal downloads and installations. At the time, the fee would make studios pay for both new installs and re-installs.


Since then, the Runtime Fee has been dialed back a bit, but is still going ahead. Riccitiello has also left Unity, so the future is uncertain about what will happen going forward. Many developers have since jumped ship to alternative engines, but the insider knowledge suggests that even people working at Unity were not happy with the upcoming fees.

                              <span>Blizzard has announced that Diablo 4 will receive a free PC trial that is live now through October 30. Players can jump into Sanctuary on Battle.net and play up to Level 20 before needing to purchase the game. It doesn&#x27;t look like the trial is available on the Steam version, and is only available through Battle.net.




Unfortunately, the trial is also only available on PC. Console players won&#x27;t have the option to try out the game before buying just yet.


Great time to try out Diablo 4


Season 2 of Diablo 4, Season of Blood is now in full swing, having been out for a little over a week. Season 1 was a bit rough, but this season is much better. Leveling is the fastest it has been yet, and all classes seem to have several viable builds. Furthermore, five new bosses have been added, which also gives players the ability to target farm Uber Unique Items.


With BlizzCon around the corner, it&#x27;s likely we&#x27;re going to see some Diablo 4 announcements. We already know Blizzard plans to release quarterly seasons and annual expansions, so it&#x27;s possible we will see the announcement of both.


For players that try out Diablo 4 during the trial and want to continue, the ARPG is currently on sale for 25% off.

                              <span>Your citizens may not have the best life in Cities Skylines 2 right now, but Paradox and Colossal Order are working on performance issues in the new city builder. And while there&#x27;s a long list of what&#x27;s wrong, citizens&#x27; teeth aren&#x27;t among the biggest concerns - so says the devs.


Right - I&#x27;m talking about the people of your fantasy city having resource-hogging teeth, but apparently it&#x27;s not quite as bad as players initially worried over. On Reddit, user Hexcoder0 shared an image of... teeth. Well, more like a screenshot of teeth meshes you can find on citizens by poking around game files.


Originally, they hypothesized Cities Skylines 2 performance issues were made worse by the game rendering individual teeth and no LOD (level of detail) to generate those chompers with less detailed vers…</span>

                              <span>Forget Halloween! PowerWash Simulator is taking us back to the 1980s with some Back to the Future content, and it&#x27;s recently been announced that the DLC will be hitting 88mph on November 16.


The reveal trailer is a rather simple affair. Over on the FuturLab YouTube channel, we get a 20-second teaser that shows a dirty facade. A rather standard sight for those who&#x27;ve played PowerWash Simulator already.




Then comes the washing. As a poster on the door is sprayed of all its dirt, we get the reveal of the DLC and the launch date. Fans of both the game and the iconic film will be giddy with glee about getting to clean the DeLorean.


More immersive jet washing


Before the DLC arrives, you can check out PowerWash Simulator on Meta Quest, which is releasing November 2. Nothing says immersive gaming like the thrill of hosing down mud-caked walls in virtual reality (that sounds like I&#x27;m being sarcastic, but I&#x27;m really not).


The base game is currently available on Xbox Game Pass, so it&#x27;s worth checking out if you haven&#x27;t already.


There&#x27;s been a bunch of content for the chore-based simulation game since it was released in 2022. We&#x27;ve had crossovers with Warhammer 40K, Final Fantasy 7, SpongeBob SquarePants, Tomb Raider, and now Back to the Future. 


It seems there&#x27;s a lot more potential for digital facsimiles of a power washing business than you might think. The simulator genre itself is evidently doing pretty well, and one can&#x27;t help but wonder what popular franchise PowerWash Simulator will incorporate next. PowerWash Simulator meets Doomguy? Ooh, fun!

                              <span>In Starfield, Earth has become a desolate wasteland with only minimal evidence that humans ever lived there. To rectify this, someone has made our home world that little bit more lush with fresh fauna and sea life.


Over on Nexus Mods, user Ainsy has managed to restore Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, breathing a bit of life into the dead planet. While it&#x27;s not a complete restoration, the mod does give back the atmosphere, as well as the oceans, some creatures, all culminating in basically turning it into a jungle biome.

Starfield all but abandoned our planet for the main story, but this download will give you at least one more reason to revisit this extinct rock we once called terra firma.


Life finds a way...or is at least modded into existence


With life restored, Ainsy&#x27;s mod means that Earth now has some signs of life again, which includes outposts, enemy bases, and some mining facilities. So if you were hoping to land here in order to get away from danger...nope. It&#x27;s business as usual.


Since launching at the beginning of September, Starfield has been at the mercy of the modding community. New content and tweaks to the vanilla experience continue to make their way to the surface. The fan-made Community Patch - the collaborative effort of a series of modders – is also here to fix any bugs that Bethesda has yet to address.


Now that hype for the has died down, a lot of players may be starting to see the lack of staying power that something like Skyrim has. Custom mods will keep people coming back for more (on PC at least), but it won&#x27;t be long before conversations surrounding the elusive Elder Scrolls 6 begin anew.

                              <span>On Twitter, @charlieINTEL posted images of what is alleged to be an upcoming PS5 Slim bundle. The bundle features Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 along with the new PS5 Slim. 




This would have been interesting enough on its own, but things got more intriguing when Twitter user @The_Stebe zoomed in on some fine print. At the bottom of the bundle&#x27;s box is a message that reads: &quot;Internet connection required to pair Disc Drive and PS5 console upon setup.&quot; 


On the surface, this doesn&#x27;t seem like much of a problem. It says nothing about a constant connection being required, and it wouldn&#x27;t be the first PlayStation to need to be connected to the internet, as owners of the current digital version of the PS5 have to download their games from the PS Store. 


There are some fringe cases where it may be an issue. Most notably, it leaves you dependent on Sony&#x27;s servers to set up your console. Hence, in a scenario where Sony&#x27;s servers shut down, it would potentially be impossible to pair up a new disc drive with a console. 


Sony hasn&#x27;t commented on the matter. The PS5 Slim launches in November, and you&#x27;ll be able to pick from the standard version and the digital edition which you can add a standalone disc drive to.

The first Ghostbusters game Nintendo fans got their hands on was a NES port of the David Crane-designed 1984 home computer game, but in the decades since there has been a good selection of spooky emissions on Nintendo platforms, several of which rank among the very best Ghostbusters games anywhere.

After being in early access for the past year, Gameloft has today revealed that Disney Dreamlight Valley will be officially launching on 5th December. There is one small change to the proceedings, however, as the publisher announced that the title will &quot;will not make the transition to be a free-to-play game&quot;, despite being described as one up until this point.
In a blog post on the official Disney Dreamlight Valley website, it was noted that this decision to remain as a paid title is to ensure that the game can &quot;continue delivering on a premium game experience for all players&quot;, while the developer pledges to keep delivering free content updates into the future.

Dave the Diver is a game about a diver named Dave. It&#x27;s also about a restauranteur, archaeologist, marine researcher, and social media genius — also Dave. Poor ol&#x27; Dave has to wear all these hats in Dave the Diver, and living out his toilsome existence makes for one of the best games of the year and easily one of the Switch&#x27;s most clever indie games in ages thanks to its oddly gripping loop, charming writing, consistent sense of humor, and immaculate vibes.
Anyone who&#x27;s worked at a bar or restaurant with a small staff will tell you that those jobs aren&#x27;t just about prepping food, waiting on tables, or mixing cocktails. They&#x27;re full of in-between, one-time tasks, like running to the grocery store for some fresh citrus during a dinner rush or taking last-minute catering deliveries to visiting businessmen on the other side of town.

This DLC pack will set you back £6.49 / $7.99 / €7.99 and includes a boatload (or, certainly carload) of iconic items from the 1985 movie that are in line for a good clean. There&#x27;s the DeLorean, Doc&#x27;s van, the Time Train, Holomax Theatre and the Hill Valley Clocktower all waiting for a scrubbin&#x27;.

Earlier in October, Nintendo reconfirmed Hogwarts Legacy would be coming to Nintendo Switch on 14th November 2023. Now, in a new update, Warner Bros. Games has revealed there&#x27;ll be a &quot;Day 1&quot; patch for both the physical and digital versions, requiring players to download an additional 8 GB.

Each game&#x27;s title has been updated to &quot;Top Racer&quot; for the collection release (this is actually what the series was called in Japan) and includes Top Racer (Top Gear), Top Racer 2 (Top Gear 2), Top Racer 3000 (Top Gear 3000) as well as the &quot;unprecedented crossover&quot; with Horizon Chase, Top Racer Crossroads.

Unlike The Walking Dead: Destinies, The Walking Dead Match 3 Tales is a puzzle RPG set within the universe of Robert Kirkman&#x27;s original comic. Through match 3 puzzles, players will combat Walkers and various other enemies while playing as various characters from the series, with each having their own set of unique skills and weapons to aid you.




Both heroes and villains are selectable in the mobile title. Characters of note include Rick, Michonne, Carl, Glenn, The Governor, Maggie, Abraham, and more. There&#x27;s weapon crafting outside of match 3 rounds that can give you an edge. As well as a mode to build your own settlement which leads to unlocking …</span>

                              <span>Suika Game is a game about fruit. It’s also one of the most addictive, yet infuriating things I’ve ever experienced.


Suika Game (aka “Watermelon Game”) on the Nintendo Switch is a charming, simple affair. You start with a box into which you are instructed to drop various fruits. When two fruits of the same type touch, they merge together into a bigger fruit, generating points. The goal is to merge as many fruits as you can to eventually create the largest fruit: a watermelon.


It feels like Suika Game should be a fun and relaxing experience. The screen is filled with colorful fruit with little faces on them. The music is bouncy, and there are satisfying little popping noises when fruits merge together. The gameplay is simple. So why do I feel like throwing my Switch against a wall?

                              <span>Occasionally, I&#x27;ll try a &quot;weird controller&quot; challenge: I mean, playing things with a DDR mat is just a fun idea. But have you ever considered beating Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom bosses with an ocarina? 


Reddit user gvmimi just did it. And for multiple fights, too!

I beat the Wind Temple Boss with my Ocarina as a controller
byu/gvmimi intearsofthekingdom


Here they are fighting the Wind Temple boss. And the Water Temple boss. And astonishingly, the Lightning Temple boss. Their goal is to beat the whole game with said Ocarina controller, which subs for a traditional control method for the Switch.


How are they doing it? As gvmimi notes: &quot;I have a program on my computer that allows me to map different musical notes/frequencies to different inputs.&quot; They also pointed out that they&#x27;ve cleared Breath of the Wild with an Ocarina, so their determination is now tenfold.


Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom will be talked about for years


When I first experienced Tears of the Kingdom in complete isolation during the review period, I knew it was going to be big when it came to showing off emergent gameplay online (bold claim, I know!). There are just so many divergent puzzle solutions that it&#x27;s a blast to see how someone else handled a problem. In fact, I specifically sought out other people who also cleared a lot of puzzles by throwing a bunch of stuff in a pile until it built a giant contraption. It was straight out of that scene in Home Alone 2 where Marv builds a little structure to help him and Harry get out of the basement of Uncle Rob and Aunt Georgette&#x27;s townhouse.


Where was I? Oh, Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is a fun game to both play and watch: which is becoming a rarity as many other AAA games rely on old open world tropes.

                              <span>Hyperstrange and Mekworx have announced that the second episode of the Early Access FPS Supplice has been released into the wild.


If you’re not familiar with it, Supplice is a new FPS built-in GZDoom. Kind of like Selaco but not quite as flashy and also available now. It’s being constructed by prominent Doom modders. I have the early access, but I’ve not made it much further than the second mission. That’s not a condemnation. I just got distracted and haven’t gone back. I guess you could interpret that as a condemnation of my attention span.


The new episode boasts five new missions, some new monsters to drill into, and “new environmental interactions. Whenever someone uses that word, I immediately think of flushing the toilet in Duke Nukem 3D. When Mekworx uses it, they mean sucking monsters out of airlocks. Those are two similar concepts, but one is much deadlier.


Supplice follows Zorah Null as she shows up for her first day on a terraforming job to instead find monsters. It’s worth noting that, unlike Doom, Supplice has more of a narrative, complete with voice acting. Like many retro-inspired shooters, the idea is to blend old and modern design. The fact that it uses an old engine just makes it more convincing.


Supplice is available in Early Access for PC already. The new episode is available now.

Another decent promotion to take advantage of involves the free Game Trial for Cult of the Lamb.

                              <span>Respawn has revealed the next season of the battle-royale FPS, titled Apex Legends: Ignite. The highlight of the new season is the electrifying new Legend: Conduit. 


For the first time ever, Cross Progression has also been added to Apex. Following the seasons electrical theme, the Storm Point map has also been energized and overhauled.




Electrifying new Legend: Conduit


A new support Legend, Conduit, makes her way to Apex Legends in Season 19. Her passive ability &quot;Savior&#x27;s Speed&quot; gives her a burst of speed specifically when running towards allies outside of her Tactical range. This syncs up with her Tactical &quot;Radiant Transfer&quot; This ability causes Conduit to send out a surge of energy to a teammate, generating temporary shields to the ally and herself. Her ultimate &quot;Energy Barricade&quot; allows her to deploy an array of shield-jamming devices that damage and slow enemies in its range. With this arsenal, Conduit has a versatile kit allowing her to cut off enemy rotations.

Energized Storm Point &amp; Cross Progression


Revamps to the Storm Point map have reduced its size while amping up the intensity, leading to players getting into more fights quicker. Players can also explore Wattston&#x27;s Town Takeover - Pylon and engage in fights at ZEUS Station. Following with the theme of Apex Legends: Ignite, the map is electrified.


With the implementation of Cross Progression, players can now brag about their collected cosmetics, badges, and achievements across all platforms and accounts. This means you can unlock a cosmetic on PC, then jump on your Xbox and still have that cosmetic.


I&#x27;ve been out of the Apex Legends loop for a while now but this seems like a great time to jump in. Cross Progression is huge and caters to casual players like me who might want to jump in here and there on different platforms.


Apex Legends: Ignite goes live on all platforms on October 31.

                              <span>Alan Wake is the cornerstone upon which Remedy Entertainment&#x27;s magnum opus rests. This magnum opus is, however, not any specific game, but their interrelationship, resulting in the creation of the Remedy Connected Universe.  


And, though Control established RCU in concrete terms, understanding how it all began is crucial.


Naturally, it all began with Alan Wake proper. As Remedy&#x27;s Sam Lake will attest, neither Quantum Break nor Max Payne are a part of the official RCU, and they will therefore be left aside for the purposes of recapping and explaining the full story of Alan Wake. We will, however, need to take a look at Control and American Nightmare to make sense of what&#x27;s been going on, and how it all sets the stage for Alan Wake 2.

Check your local library


This might be a shock to you, but there are libraries that let you rent out video games for free. While I was living in Edmonton, I used the library so much because of this. While it took a long time to get new releases (around a month typically), I was able to catch up on franchises like Resident Evil and Fire Emblem because of the library near me.

                              <span>Risk of Rain Returns, a remake of the 2013 roguelike platformer has announced its release date, and it’s sooner than you might think. You can jump into the randomly generated action in just a couple weeks, on November 8.




In a post on Twitter, the official Risk of Rain account showcased a new character, the Pilot, designed to be a crowd-control prioritized combatant. Armed with a standard Clusterfire attack and a secondary attack called Target Acquired, players can make quick work of any enemies that cross their path. 


But, they also look to be rather agile, which lets them put space between themselves and enemies. The Pilot also has a utility ability called Rapid Deployment, which makes good use of their parachute. 


Risk of Rain Returns is introducing The Pilot, in addition to another new survivor, The Drifter. The Drifter looks to be more of an up-close-and-personal melee fighter, using their sleeping bag and other everyday items as instruments of blunt force trauma. 


In addition to Risk of Rain Returns’ release date, developer Hopoo Games also announced a celebration of the series’ community called The Festival of Gup, also set to occur live on Gearbox’s Twitch on November 8 at 10:30 a.m. PST / 12:30 p.m. CST / 1:30 p.m. EST. 


Risk of Rain Returns will be available for PC and Nintendo Switch on November 8.

                              <span>It was recently brought to people&#x27;s attention that the Master Collection of Metal Gear Solid was near unplayable on Steam Deck. Fortunately, Valve has been quick off the mark, and a fix is rolling out.


According to a recent Twitter/X post from Pierre-Loup Grifais – coder for Valve – a hotifx has been deployed.  This should tend to the crashing issues people have been having with both Metal Gear Solid 2 and Metal Gear Solid 3.




As is often the case when it comes to the Steam Deck, the problem appeared to be related to compatibility issues with the device&#x27;s operating system. This new patch – sent out literally moments ago – addresses issues with Proton, the Linux-based software the Deck is built around.


What was the problem?


In a recent report/video from GamingOnLinux, the recent release of the first three Metal Gear Solid entries were shown to be not suited for the Deck. While MGS runs fine, it seems to maintain its old-school 4:3 aspect ratio, and the game is locked at 30fps. This may not be an issue for some, but others may take exception to the sizeable black borders and lower framerate.


However, at least it was running on the device. The same could not be said for the second and third games, neither of which would play at all. Both Sons of Liberty and Snake Eater were crashing to the Steam Library, meaning they couldn&#x27;t be played at all.


Given the popularity of the classic Metal Gear Solid games, it&#x27;s not surprising Valve was pretty quick to act. Hopefully, MGS2 and MGS3 should run now, as the update&#x27;s purpose is to &quot;address a blocking crash in cutscenes.&quot; At the time of writing, a fix for the missing audio in cutscenes is still being worked on.

                              <span>A magnificent seven?
Unless you’re a Neo Geo diehard, Visco isn&#x27;t as recognisable as Namco, Konami, Capcom, or the other big hitters they used to roll with in the early &#x27;90s arcade scene. And, although the company made strong impressions with the likes of Vasara, the majority of its work was for SNK’s Neo Geo hardware, as represented by the seven games in this collection.
Publisher PixelHeart, who acquired a license to at least part of Visco’s library, has been mining the company’s back catalogue with real vigour recently. It has published Ganryu 2 and Andro Dunos 2, both from independent developers, as well as releasing various ports, reproductions, and even a branded bartop arcade machine. This VISCO Collection, jointly published with QUByte Interactive, is either a culmination of sorts, or another brick in the wall; but, while there are a few unfortunate omissions in the library, it remains a solid and well-represented lineup.

                              <span>After 13 years, Alan Wake 2 is nearly here. But since the long-awaited sequel has been tossed around for over a decade, it&#x27;s fair to assume not everyone has a clear memory of the events of the first game, and some people likely never got around to playing it at all. If that sounds like you, you&#x27;re in the right place; here&#x27;s everything you need to know about the first Alan Wake to prepare for the sequel.
Arriving at Bright Falls
The game takes place in the town of Bright Falls, Washington, where the titular protagonist Alan Wake is going on vacation with his wife, Alice. Wake is an author known for his Alex Casey novels, but he hasn&#x27;t written anything new in three years. After being recognized in town several times by fans (especially Rose, the waitress at a local diner), Wake receives keys…</span>

This news comes from a new report at The Verge, which writes that Microsoft head of studios and corporate vice president Matt Booty has been promoted to president of game content and studios, and that Microsoft corporate vice president Sarah Bond has been promoted to Xbox president. She will oversee all Xbox platform responsibilities. 
The Verge also reports that after 32 years, chief marketing officer Chris Capossela is stepping down from Microsoft. 
In Booty&#x27;s new position, he will &quot;lead an expanded organization inside Microsoft Gaming that now includes ZeniMax and Bethesda,&quot; according to the publication.…</span>

                              <span>Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2 hit PlayStation 5 exclusively last week and it&#x27;s already Sony&#x27;s fastest-selling first-party game. While we loved the game – read Game Informer&#x27;s Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2 here – once players got their hands on the game, some encountered a few bugs and issues, like one where their character model became a small white cube that looks like tofu. Plus, players discovered a Cuban flag was displayed inside and outside the Morales household rather than the expected Puerto Rican flag. A new update for Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2 out today fixes both of these issues and more. 


Version 1.001.003 is now live in-game, and it brings a few fixes to the game, including the aforementioned flag issue and white cube issue. It also addresses an issue where The Amazing 2 Suit&#x27;s spider logo appeared too bright in-game, and improves the game&#x27;s stability. Here&#x27;s the full update breakdown: 
Addressed an issue where an incorrect flag was displayed
Addressed an issue where models would not load properly after long play sessions
Addressed an issue where The Amazing 2 Suit&#x27;s Spider logo appeared too bright
Improved stability
Developer Insomniac Games has also released a statement alongside the above patch notes specifically addressing the flag issue. 
&quot;Today&#x27;s patch corrects an error where the Cuban flag was incorrectly displayed instead of the Puerto Rican flag,&quot; it reads. &quot;We understand that accurate representation matters, and greatly regret this error. We sincerely apologize and will do better in the future.&quot; 


Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2 hit PlayStation 5 exclusively on October 20.

                              <span>Alan Wake 2 is almost here – it hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on Friday, October 27. Its release this week comes after developer Remedy Entertainment delayed the game 10 days earlier this summer. While there are plenty of visual options for players playing on PC – check out Alan Wake 2&#x27;s PC spec requirements here – there are only two graphics modes for those picking it up on PS5 and Xbox Series X (and just one on Xbox Series S). But first, be sure to read Game Informer&#x27;s Alan Wake 2 review.  
Below, we&#x27;ll dive into the two graphics modes for Alan Wake 2 on PS5 and Xbox Series X, and then a handful of Game Informer editors playing the game will share the mode they&#x27;ve opted to experience Remedy&#x27;s latest in.

Remedy is known for being experimental. It mixes live-action footage into its video games, plays with player expectations, rewards those devoted to the developer’s history and gameography, and in the case of Alan Wake 2, eagerly performs big-budget lunacy for our entertainment and sometimes confusion. The highs of Alan Wake’s follow-up adventure are tall, but there are frequent lows that drag the whole experience into The Dark Place. I also encountered a number of bugs that forced frequent restarts and one full reinstallat…</span>

It didn&#x27;t quite land for us – Game Informer gave it a 6 out of 10 – but a new update that launches later today fixes one of the major problems we had with the soulslike. That&#x27;s because the new Pumpkin Patch update that launches at 2 p.m. PT/5 p.m. ET today comes with reduced enemy density. Plus, the patch brings full crossplay to the game alongside performance and stability fixes and more.

                              <span>Earlier this week, Microsoft revealed the launch of Starfield led to a 13% increase in overall Xbox content and services revenue in its Fiscal Year 2024 Quarter 1 financials. Now, Capcom has released its latest round of financials – the six-month period that ended in September – and in it, reveals that both income and profit are up thanks to the excellent launches of its Resident Evil 4 remake and Street Fighter 6. 
Total game sales are up from 21.3 million this time last year to 22.6 million units, resulting in a net sales increase of 53%, from 49,067 million Yen to 74,934 million Yen. Operating income is up 55%, too. As for why, Capcom points to the release of its Resident Evil 4 remake, which it released back in March, Street Fighter 6, which hits PlayStation, Xbox, and PC in June, and its Monster Hunter series. 


Resident Evil 4 has sold 5.45 million units, while Street Fighter 6 is at 2.47 million units sold. Monster Hunter Rise, with its Sunbreak expansion, has crossed 6.5 million units sold. Capcom has also revealed that its remake of Resident Evil 2 has sold more than 13 million units, with its remake of Resident Evil 3 sitting at 8 million units sold. The recently released Monster Hunter Now, a Monster Hunter take on Pokemon Go, has been downloaded more than 10 million times by players as of last week. 
Capcom says the entire Resident Evil series has sold more than 150 million units, with Monster Hunter crossing 95 million. The Street Fighter franchise sits at 52 million. Here are some other series highlights: 
Mega Man: 41 million units sold
Devil May Cry: 30 million units sold
Dragon&#x27;s Dogma: 7.9 million

                              <span>Alan Wake 2 finally hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC tomorrow, on Friday, October 27. After the wait was extended by a 10-day delay, the game&#x27;s release is almost here. After getting a new launch trailer yesterday that showed more of this spooky world, developer Remedy Entertainment has another pre-launch update to share: New Game+ will arrive sometime after the game&#x27;s launch. 
This New Game+ mode will allow players to retain all unlocked weapons and upgrades. Plus, it will feature a new Nightmare difficulty level and an &quot;alternative narrative&quot; that includes new manuscript pages and new video content. Remedy says it&#x27;s due sometime after launch but that the release timing of it is still to be decided. 
New Game+ coming after launch.

For more about the game, read Game Informer&#x27;s hands-on with a Saga Anderson section of Alan Wake 2 and then read what we thought about playing as Alan Wake. After that, watch this Saga Anderson-focused Alan Wake 2 NGT and then check out this Alan Wake-focused NGT. Make sure your PC is ready for Alan Wake 2&#x27;s beefy system requirements, too.

                              <span>Foxhole is a massively multiplayer battlefield in which players can be frontline soldiers or part of a rear detachment providing supplies and logistical support. A major free update is out today, Naval Warfare, which as the name suggets brings that persistent online war to the sea, with gunboats, destroyers and beach landings to contend with.

                              <span>Even after several years of updates and an excellent expansion, Cyberpunk 2077 still isn&#x27;t bug-free. I said as much in my Phantom Liberty review. The difference now versus launch back in 2020 is that the bugs are now within acceptable limits.

CDPR continue to fix them, too. Patch 2.02 is out now.

                              <span>Ubisoft&#x27;s multiplayer Jolly Rog &#x27;em up Skull and Bones is caught on the reefs once again. Recently tipped to appear in early fiscal year 2023-2024, it&#x27;s now due to make landfall in the publisher&#x27;s FYQ4 - sometime between January and March 2024. What&#x27;s the Golden Age of Piracy equivalent for &quot;vapourware&quot;? I&#x27;m picturing a spectral vessel like the Flying Dutchman, crewed by glum-faced producers and with a big grimacing statue of company CEO Yves Guillemot affixed to the prow.


The troubled naval combat sim isn&#x27;t the only Ubisoft project experiencing misadventures. As revealed in their latest earnings report, the publisher have also pushed back a mysterious &quot;large game&quot;, originally due to launch before the end of their current fiscal year, to the next fiscal year, which means at some point after 31st March 2024. Speculation runs rife that the anonymous blockbuster is Ubisoft Massive&#x27;s Star Wars Outlaws.

Now it&#x27;s virtual reality&#x27;s turn, with the launch of SteamVR 2.0.

The first patch is out now and it includes optimisations for rendering, fog, depth-of-field and more designed to make the citybuilder&#x27;s framerates less gridlocked.

It&#x27;s much more common to see 27-inch monitors at this resolution, with a 24-inch screen providing a sharper image as a result of a higher DPI. This model from Chinese manufacturer Koorui also comes with a Fast IPS panel with 1ms GtG pixel response times and a 165Hz refresh rate, making it a great choice for fast-paced gaming too. 
This Koorui monitor has also been reduced in price, dropping from an initial MSRP of $400 to just $200 after a cool 50% reduction - with a $15 gift card thrown in too.

                              <span>Ask RPS returns for another installment today, this time focusing on some of our daily food and drink habits. Technically, I have mashed two supporter questions into one for this post, as to me they seemed inherently linked, because what is the point of tea/coffee if not to also have a nice biscuit and a sit down at the same time?
With that in mind, today&#x27;s questions come courtesy of caff, who asked: What is your favourite biscuit? and PolygonClassicist, who asked: What are the caffeine habits of the RPS staff? (along with the extra sub-question clarifications of: when do we like to have our coffee, espresso, tea, soda and/or energy drinks? How do we like to consume them? And how much caffeine do we all consume on a daily basis?) Come and find out how we all get through the day (in a, err, not at all dark way) below!

                              <span>OK, so there&#x27;s plenty in Worldless that won&#x27;t remind you of Silksong or its predecessor, Hollow Knight. Rather than a medieval bug exploring a labyrinth of bioluminescent rot and lore, you&#x27;re a vaguely humanoid cloud of shards and points, roaming an abstract landscape of soft curves and shafts of light. You&#x27;re Rayman but fancy, basically, and the world is no world but an uncreated expanse of elemental forces, though you&#x27;ll find you can run and jump on it much as you can the ledges of Hallownest. The combat is a different beast, too. Rather than Souls-inflected 2D hack-and-slash, it&#x27;s turn-based battling with a twist - each turn gives you a countdown in which to perform real-time combos, mixing melee and magical attacks. 


So why does Worldless make me think of Team Cherry&#x27;s work? Partly it&#x27;s the underlying touch of metroidvania, a word the press materials seem oddly hesitant to use. The map extends in all directions and you&#x27;ll need to acquire new abilities to reach certain areas. Partly, it&#x27;s the shared enchanted grotto atmosphere, with all sorts of tiny animate details festering for attention as you explore. And partly, it&#x27;s the dash move you unlock early on, and the process of chaining it with a platform-conjuring ability to unlock routes while traversing them, which puts me strongly in mind of those horizontal gauntlet runs from the Silksong trailer. All told, if you&#x27;re beginning to crisp up for lack of Hollow Knight news, you might want to give the demo a whirl ahead of Worldless&#x27;s release on (drum roll) 21st November 2023.

                              <span>The Alan Wake 2 review embargo lifts today, but ours needs a bit more time in the oven. Review code only came in late Sunday night, and for a game so heavily reliant on the thrust and resolution of its story, it&#x27;s imperative I get to the end of it before I deliver my final verdict. Alas, the business of running a website does not play nicely with tight review deadlines like this, but what I can tell you after 15-odd hours of play is that it&#x27;s really sunk its claws into me good and proper. 
Alan Wake 2 is a much creepier, more unnerving kind of horror game than its predecessor, doubling down on its fiction-meets-reality schtick while also piling on the scares and interlacing it with unsettling imagery of teeth-gnashing, inkblot-stained doppelgangers to ratchet up the tension. In many ways, this is a game that owes as much to Resident Evil 7 as it does its own lineage in the genre, and the dual narratives of its two protagonists, FBI agent Saga Anderson and Alan himself, arguably make this Remedy&#x27;s most sophisticated tale yet.

                              <span>What better way to follow up my interview with Just Stop Oil than by writing about a horror game set on a haunted oil rig? The game in question is, of course, Still Wakes The Deep from Dear Esther and Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs developer The Chinese Room. Set off the coast of Scotland in the 1970s, it sees you navigating collapsing gantries and flooded rooms while avoiding an unearthly terror apparently extracted from the ocean floor. Mind you, the worst thing in the game could be the weather, which you can witness for yourself in the latest gameplay trailer below. Never mind the dreadful moaning on the other side of the pipes - how about that drizzle?

                              <span>At EGX earlier this month, climate change protestors cosplaying as the Ghostbusters interrupted a Tekken 7 tournament, spraying player screens with orange paint and attempting to make a speech before being hauled off by security. The three protestors, who were later arrested, are members of Just Stop Oil, a British activist group officially founded in February 2022 who carry out acts of nonviolent obstruction and vandalism in the hope of rallying support against the UK government granting new fossil fuel licenses and production agreements. In the case of EGX, which is run by Rock Paper Shotgun&#x27;s parent company Reedpop, Just Stop Oil were protesting against the sponsorship of one EGX stage by Barclays Bank, who have financed billions of dollars of fossil fuel investments (Barclays have provided some official comment down the page). They were also trying to call attention to oil giant Shell&#x27;s sponsorship deal with Fortnite, which includes a special themed map &quot;powered by Shell V-Power(r) NiTRO+ Premium Gasoline&quot;.
I&#x27;ve written a bit here and there about the overlap between games, video games and protest movements. I&#x27;ve also been on a JSO protest march myself - albeit, slightly by accident (no, I didn&#x27;t glue myself to anything). I was curious to hear more about the EGX protest, and specifically, whether the group&#x27;s tactical use of cosplay for both dramatic effect and subterfuge represents any broader understanding of games as a form of protest art. JSO put me in touch with Oliver Clegg, a 20-year-old student who joined the group early on and has participated in some of their better-known direct actions. The below is a transcript of that conversation which has been edited down for length and clarity.

                              <span>Metal Gear Solid 3 arrived on PC for the first time yesterday thanks to the stealth-action series’ Master Collection. Unfortunately, it seems to be a fairly underwhelming PC debut for Hideo Kojima’s frog-munching masterpiece, with Snake Eater’s Steam page full of negative reviews about the barebones port’s restriction to 720p resolution, reported startup crashes and lack of Steam Deck support.

                              <span>Ark: Survival Ascended, the remake of dinosaur survival game Ark: Survival Evolved, has resurfaced with its first gameplay trailer, showing off its flashy Unreal Engine 5 graphics, improved physics-based destruction and overhauled user interface. The biggest reveal, though, is that the Ark remake will apparently drop on Steam later today.

                              <span>We first saw Manor Lords a couple of years ago, when its mix of Crusader Kings-like simulation, Ages of Empires-y city-building and sweeping battles a la Total War made it one to watch. We weren’t alone in that anticipation either, as the ambitious medieval strategy game - created by a solo dev, no less - rocketed up the Steam charts to become one of its most wishlisted games.

                              <span>It&#x27;s hard to imagine blockblustery first-person shooting today without Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare&#x27;s online progression systems, which - inasmuch as you can assign this much clout to a single game or developer - transformed the genre back in 2007 by reinventing multiplayer as a kind of RPG. Shooters without COD-style gear levelling ladders do exist, not least Counter-Strike 2, but most of the juggernauts depend on such fixtures, especially now that free-to-play service models have become the norm. So it&#x27;s jarring to hear from Mackey McCandlish, one of Modern Warfare&#x27;s original developers, that the old Infinity Ward team were split over the act of using XP to unlock guns, with some worrying it would be &quot;unfair&quot;.

                              <span>Last time, you decided that present decisions deciding past events is better than that puzzle where switches turn on some things while turning off others. I can&#x27;t say I am surprised by the result, and suspect it was heavily influenced by spite, but I am very grateful to the people who stood up and explained why they like that puzzle where etc. I do try to make a case for both things but won&#x27;t pretend I understand (or appreciate) every thing in games, so I appreciate your help. This week, I ask you to pick between two ways of being there and then not. What&#x27;s better: summoning spectral animals or blink teleports?

                              <span>When two of a game&#x27;s weapons are nailguns, you should probably expect players to be enthusiastic about construction. Following last year&#x27;s excellent Brutalist Jam map pack, Quake mappers have reunited to release another free load of levels inspired by Brutalism and concrete. The 30 maps offer good honest fragging in everything from concrete cities to murderous mystical puzzle boxes. Honestly, I&#x27;d recommend downloading the pack even if only to see the hub level and marvel at quite how good Quake can look when made for modern PCs.

                              <span>If you&#x27;re weary of Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3&#x27;s whimsy, or you&#x27;ve finished gnawing the bones of Diablo 4 and are hungry for more of that sweet, sweet grimdark, you might like to check out Beast from Polish developer False Prophet, which goes into Steam early access today. It&#x27;s a turn-based tactics RPG with a Gothic historical setting, an extremely late-noughties insanity mechanic, a heavy metal soundtrack, plagues, heresy, dynastic feuding, and a protagonist with a dramatic eye scar and possibly non-metaphorical &quot;inner demons&quot;. Amongst other things, it looks like you can run people over with a horse-drawn carriage. M-Rated enough for you, edgelords? Here&#x27;s the trailer.

The developers include a few thoughts about what performance means for a management sim like Skylines 2, revealing that they considered delaying release to improve and stabilise the game, but felt that postponing launch would be &quot;unfair&quot; to those who are less bothered by such things.

                              <span>“Not everyone is Nintendo,” Hilmar Veigar Pétursson says. “Corporate entities, historically, are not very long-living. By being 30 years old, CCP is old by company standards.” As we talk, his fixation on persistence and artefact becomes clear. Though, he’s never hidden it. In 2014, Pétursson’s company, CCP, unveiled a five-metre-tall sculpture with the names of every active player in their MMO, EVE Online, etched into its surface; this year, they expanded the monument to add the names of players who have subscribed in the decade since. “I&#x27;ve been obsessed about doing things like printed books, magazines, models of EVE Online...,” Pétursson tells me, “like there&#x27;s this need to leave a footprint.” 



Pétursson has discovered a company that uses cow stem cells to 3D print calfskin. For the studio’s 30th anniversary, he plans to commission a poetry chapter inspired by Iceland’s epic history book, the Prose Edda, write it on the artificial skin, and put it in a Reykjavik museum. It would sit alongside an ancient calfskin copy of the Icelandic sagas. “It was written 1000 years ago, but as an Icelandic person, I can still read and understand what it says,” Pétursson explains. He tells me that it’s an effective way of storing data because if you sent a USB stick 1,000 years into the future, where would you even find a computer with a drive to read it? This appreciation for artefacts and need for legacy has led to his current project, a new game from CCP using blockchain technology, currently known as Project Awakening.

                              <span>American McGee has spent the past several years trying to make Alice: Asylum, a third entry in his series of action-horror games inspired by Lewis Carroll&#x27;s Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland. That fight produced a crowdfunded 414-page design bible but came to an end earlier this year when rights-holders EA rejected the pitch, and McGee declared that he had &quot;no other ideas or energy left to apply toward getting a new Alice game made.&quot;

McGee reiterated similar sentiments in a new video discussing the project&#x27;s end, but he did suggest one &quot;ray of hope&quot; to the community. &quot;The design bible as produced is the perfect thing to feed into an AI system to have it completely build the game that is outlined in that design bible.&quot;

                              <span>In 2008, Robert Downey Jr. debuted as Tony Stark in Iron Man. Outside of being an excellent movie in its own right, Iron Man proved to be one of the most influential films of the 21st century so far, paving the way to the biggest film and TV franchise of the last decade and a half, the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The post-credits sequence of Iron Man served as a teaser for what was to come, as Samuel L. Jackson&#x27;s Nick Fury informed Stark that he was a part of a bigger universe.
At the time, &quot;The Avenger Initiative&quot; felt like a throwaway tease for something that would never happen (even for those involved in writing the scene), but films starring Captain America, Thor, and Hulk started building an unprecedented interconnectivity.

                              <span>Alan Wake 2 is almost here. It hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC this Friday, on October 27, after developer Remedy Entertainment delayed it 10 days earlier this summer. With just two days until launch, Remedy released the Alan Wake 2 launch trailer during today&#x27;s Xbox Partner Preview, which is where we also saw our first gameplay from Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater and Ikaro: Will Not Die, the new game from the makers of Powerwash Simulator. 
In the trailer, we see dual protagonists Saga Anderson and the titular Alan Wake come to grips with the latter&#x27;s ability to influence the real world with words written on his typewriter. Like the game, this trailer mixes Alan Wake 2&#x27;s live-action elements with gameplay, and both look great. The gameplay continues to deliver the spooky action thrills previously seen in other trailers, and we get a new glimpse of the game&#x27;s story. 
Check out the Alan Wake 2 launch trailer for yourself below: 


Alan Wake 2 hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on October 27. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer&#x27;s hands-on with a Saga Anderson section of Alan Wake 2 and then read what we thought about playing as Alan Wake. After that, watch this Saga Anderson-focused Alan Wake 2 NGT and then check out this Alan Wake-focused NGT. Make sure your PC is ready for Alan Wake 2&#x27;s beefy system requirements, too.

                              <span>If you’ve been curious about The Finals, Embark Studios’ game show-inspired free-to-play shooter, you can sample a taste of the game in an open beta starting tomorrow. First revealed last August, the game has only been playable in closed playtests over the last year. 
A new trailer premiering during today’s Xbox Partner Preview shows off the first-person shooter, in which teams compete in virtual arenas for the delight of a cheering audience (and potential sponsors). Arenas, which are based on recognizable real-world locations, are fully destructible and can be altered by players.
The open beta adds the new Skyway Stadium to the map rotation. The beta also introduces a new game mode called Bank-It, in which four teams of three fight to gather coins, with the winner either hitting a max limit first or having the most cash banked at the end of the round. 


Players will have access to 20 weapons, 26 gadgets, and 9 abilities used to reduce targets into showers of gold coins. Item progression will feature 5 Mastery Levels per weapon as well. 
The open beta is cross-platform, so players on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and Steam can jump in. It will run until November 5. The beta includes a free battle pass with 16 exclusive, permanent rewards that carry over to the game’s eventual full launch.</span>

                              <span>Today during Xbox&#x27;s most recent Partner Preview livestream, developer Studio Wildcard showed off its remake of Ark: Survival Evolved, titled Ark: Survival Ascended. And fittingly, it did so by showing off a whole host of dinosaurs.
 We got flying dinos, stalking dinos, and swimming dinos. You&#x27;re hunting dinos, riding dinos, and hanging with dinos. And most notably, it looks great, having been rebuilt from the ground up with Unreal Engine 5. 
Check out the trailer below:


Interestingly, Survival Ascended will have cross-platform modding on all platforms, as revealed in a post on the Xbox Wire. It looks like PC players will have the ability to actually make modes, as it requires the Ark Devkit, downloaded from the Epic Launcher, but playing mods will be available for everyone.
The original Ark: Survival Evolved was released back in 2015.</span>

                              <span>Today&#x27;s Xbox Partner Preview brought us a new look at Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, the remake announced earlier this year. In the trailer, we get a first look at the game&#x27;s use of Unreal Engine 5 alongside some quick snippets of tactical espionage action.
While what&#x27;s shown is definitely gameplay, it doesn&#x27;t appear to be final as the trailer calls it the &quot;first in-engine look.&quot; Plus, the gameplay is watermarked with a &quot;pre-alpha footage&quot; tag.
Check out the Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see in the trailer above, we see Big Boss sneaking through jungles, over wooden bridges, through World War 2-esque trenches, and more. There&#x27;s nothing pointing toward the game&#x27;s story in this trailer but it does make one thing clear: this remake is going to be beautiful if today&#x27;s showing is any indication. And the gameplay looks solid and intact – exactly what you&#x27;d imagine a 2023 remake of this 2004 classic would look like. 
Revealed back in May, coincidentally during a PlayStation Showcase, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is a from-the-ground-up remake of the third Metal Gear Solid game originally released in 2004. Like the original, this remake is a 1960s-era prequel to the Metal Gear series that tells the origin story of Big Boss. As such, it serves as a foundational narrative to the wider Metal Gear universe. 
Here are a few screenshots from today&#x27;s showing:

                              <span>Today’s Xbox Partner Preview brought us a good look at Still Wakes The Deep, the new game from The Chinese Room, a studio known for projects like Dear Esther, Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs, and Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture.
The new project has distinct horror vibes as it drops players into the shoes of a character navigating a ruined oil rig. A strange, alien-like tentacled form reaches up from beneath the roiling ocean waters – seemingly the source of the oil rig’s trouble. As the protagonist navigates the catwalks and beams of the rig, we hear distant and troubling screams. After traversing several tunnels, the first-person lead drops through a hatch into the very water that seems to be the source of the strange tendrils.
The Chinese Room is clearly interested in building atmosphere and tension in this trailer and, presumably, doing the same in the broader game. There’s clearly some awful threat at play aboard the rig, but its nature and what is happening to the others on board the rig remain a mystery.
Nonetheless, the first-person visuals and tense exploration are looking great, leaving us excited for the game’s launch on Xbox Series X/S (including Game Pass) in early 2024.</span>

The game is billed as a momentum-based action roguelite, with players zipping around neon-soaked cyberpunk world dishing out rapid melee attacks while executing air dashing and somersaults to evade and outmaneuver enemies. Check out its first trailer below. 


Ikaro Will Not Die doesn’t have a release date, but it’s coming to Xbox Series X/S and PC.</span>

Both the disc drive and digital model are getting upgrades, but alongside this news, the company also revealed a new detachable disc drive. This optional drive can be added to a new slim model of the digital PS5, turning it into a console that can use discs. It seems this drive will require an internet connection to use, however. 
Some images of a potentially upcoming Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III slim PS5 bundle have leaked online (thanks, CharlierIntel) and in the small text on the box, it says, &quot;Internet connection required to pair Disc Drive and PS5 console upon startup.&quot;

Understandably, many players and video game preservationists aren&#x27;t enthused about the online requirement as there could come a day when the servers the console and disc drive attach to are offline, making the optional accessory useless. Given the text on the box, it sounds like the internet connection is a one-time thing, only needed to pair the disc drive with the console, but it&#x27;s unclear if it&#x27;s required after that. 
Game Informer has reached out to PlayStation to ask about the internet connection requirement and if a connection is required beyond initial setup; we will update this story if we learn more. 
The same leaked images that you can see above also point to an unannounced Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III slim PS5 bundle that comes with the console, a DualSense controller, and the game.
For more, catch up on all the biggest Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III news from a recent COD Next livestream, and then read about how Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III won&#x27;t come to Xbox Game Pass this year, even after Microsoft acquired Activision Blizzard earlier this month.
What do you think about this disc drive requiring an internet connection? Let us know in the comments below!</span>

                              <span>Starfield hit Xbox Series X/S and PC last month, and it became the biggest Bethesda game launch ever, later earning it the top spot on best-selling games in the U.S. last month. Now, thanks to Microsoft&#x27;s Fiscal Year 2024 Quarter 1 financial results, we know more than 11 million players have played Starfield to date. Starfield&#x27;s excellent launch resulted in a 13% increase in overall Xbox content and services. However, despite the financial boon on the Xbox services side, overall Xbox hardware was still down 7%. 
That&#x27;s according to Microsoft executive vice president and chief financial officer Amy Hood, who also revealed during the financial results call yesterday that Xbox Game Pass experienced &quot;better-than-expected&quot; subscriber growth; Microsoft did not share any updated Game Pass subscri…</span>

That makes it a good teaching tool as much as it is a game. Or made it a good teaching tool, anyway - Rocksmith 2014 has been removed from sale almost ten years to the day after it launched.

                              <span>Massive SATA SSDs are getting ever more affordable, and this is the best 4TB deal we&#x27;ve ever seen here at RPS. You can get a TeamGroup T-Force Vulcan Z 4TB drive for just $138 at Newegg, down from a previous price of $180. 
In fact, this is half the price of a deal we were eagerly posting about just one year ago, which really speaks to the speed at which SSD storage has collapsed in price in 2023.

                              <span>LG&#x27;s C2 OLED is my top TV recommendation for PC and console gaming, and the 42-inch and 48-inch versions can even work as PC monitors. Today the 48-inch model has dropped to £824 at Ebay when you use codes BONUS10 and SAVE100OLED, a great price for what is a class-leading 48-inch OLED. For context, this year&#x27;s basically identical 48-inch C3 OLED costs £1100, so you&#x27;re saving nearly £300.

                              <span>A few weeks ago I wrote about Grand Theft Auto players describing the movement of planes in random GTA promotional art as evidence of a forthcoming GTA 6 reveal, timed to intersect with the waning gibbous moon. I thought that the furore might die down after GTA 6 failed to materialise in accordance with the lunar cycle, but it turns out this rabbit hole has no bottom.
Come now, gaze upon the above, just-posted Rockstar promotional image for a new Red Dead Online outfit. To my eye, that picture looks like a weird dude in a mask, gazing at you through piles of skulls. Standard Halloween gamer fare. But it turns out that when you draw lines on it using MS Paint, you end up with the below.

                              <span>One of the most unnerving things about Geometric Interactive&#x27;s lush insect puzzler Cocoon is how intuitive it feels. For my money, anyway. The premise is perfectly brain-bending: each world contains or is contained by another world, and you&#x27;re a beetle who can not only leap between them, but pick one world up and use it as a puzzle prop inside another.
The game doesn&#x27;t really verbalise any of this: there&#x27;s no equivalent for Atreus in God Of War: Ragnarok, ostentatiously nudging you towards each solution. And yet somehow, I find myself flowing through Cocoon like I&#x27;m being poured out of a bottle, switching scales and putting together the pieces in a way that feels effortful yet graceful, earned yet... eerily frictionless. This is no reflection on my knack for solving puzzles. It&#x27;s a show of how elegantly the game is made so that while there&#x27;s difficulty, there&#x27;s rarely frustration.

                              <span>Puzzle game Suika, or &#x27;That Watermelon Game&#x27;, is currently having a bit of a moment online. It&#x27;s been available on Switch for a couple of years now in Japan, but this week it received an English eShop version, and it&#x27;s taken off a bit with streamers and Twitch folk. It&#x27;s also spawned dozens of clones, including an unofficial free web browser version that I&#x27;ve been giving a go over the last couple of lunch times to see what all the fuss is about. It&#x27;s a neat little time waster. It&#x27;s a teensy bit different to the proper Switch version, but the basic concept is the same: it&#x27;s a essentially physics-based fruit Tetris meets Threes, where you&#x27;re dropping similar-looking fruits on top of one another to combine them into even larger fruits. 
The goal is to combine them enough times to get the big watermelon for mega points, but honestly, I&#x27;m not sure how much longer I can keep playing this free version of Suika, because so many of the fruits you meet along the way to the watermelon just look so gosh darn sad that it&#x27;s breaking my heart a little. Then again, if I was a pear, I&#x27;d probably have a pretty sour-looking face, too, if I&#x27;m honest.

                              <span>I like to-do list games. Take Wytchwood, where your to-do list is stuff like &#x27;craft trap to catch lizard to use lizard eyes to craft weapon to defeat ghost to...&#x27; and so on. My Little Universe, which is clearly best played in co-op, and would be good to play with kids if you have sourced any of those from somewhere, is like a to-do list game that reduces crafting to the barest minimum. You are basically collecting raw resources and pouring them into a bottomless maw. Despite that description, it&#x27;s quite charming.

                              <span>Stretch and compress rooms to make your escape in Stretchmancer, a nice little puzzle-platformer you can play for free. Your heroic gecko is a Stretchmancer, see, able to bend the dimensions of spaces to push walls far away and draw distant objects near. This is handy when trying to defeat an evil space empire. Stretchmancer is in a similar vein to Portal: a first-person puzzle-platformer which uses one neat trick to change how you see the world, and builds on that while a baddie taunts you. It&#x27;s short, it&#x27;s free, it&#x27;s fun, and you might enjoy it slightly breaking your eyes.

                              <span>Cities: Skylines 2 is, much like the wonkily roaded, pollution-choked helltown I’ve built within it, a work in progress. Developers Colossal Order upped the citybuilding sequel’s system requirements well in advance of launch, and more recently admitted to have &quot;not achieved the benchmark we targeted&quot; for PC performance. Instead, future improvements are promised, to patch Skylines 2 into better shape.
I wish I could say that this is all just pessimism, born from an overabundance of caution and expectation management. But no, it is just a bit of a mess, one capable of putting freshly mixed concrete shoes on even the fastest graphics cards. I’ve worked out a best settings guide that, compared to the available graphics presets, can better balance performance and visuals – though be warned that this will feel more like urgent repair work than a dream remodel.

This is just a quick Codec to let you know that Konami&#x27;s stealth blockbuster bundle Metal Gear Solid - Master Collection Volume 1 is now available to buy. Did you ever play Metal Gear Solid, Snake? It&#x27;s this sprawling philosophical epic about war, surveillance, AI, nationalism and anti-heroism, a baroque metafictional saga spanning generations that is also a complex series of videogame design experiments. I know - it&#x27;s a lot to take in, Snake, but you can sort of boil the series down to the difference between two varieties of wall. There are the ones you hide behind, so as to get the drop on your foes, and there are the ones you break, because they&#x27;re fourth walls, Snake. Do you see?

                              <span>The Elder Scrolls 6 is going to be a mixture of new ideas and RPG systems that go all the way back to The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion, according to Bethesda&#x27;s former design director Bruce Nesmith, who was lead designer on The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim and senior designer on Starfield. In particular, Nesmith reckons it will &quot;absolutely&quot; continue with Skyrim&#x27;s approach to levelling and progression, whereby you improved skills by performing the associated actions. He also thinks the game will &quot;probably&quot; retain elements of the magic system he designed for Skyrim, which broke away from Oblivion and Morrowind in being simpler to understand and more immediately powerful, at the price of flexibility and inventiveness.

                              <span>In August, Night Dive Studios announced it was remastering the classic ‘90s first-person shooter Star Wars: Dark Forces. We now know that this modernization of one of the most beloved Star Wars games is coming on February 28. 
Night Dive, a studio specializing in reviving classic games such as its remake of System Shock that launched in May, is shining up the 1995 Star Wars title with 4K resolution and a 120 fps bump (on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC). Textures and lighting have been enhanced, and controls have been modernized to support today’s gamepads. That includes platform-specific features such as gyro/motion controls, rumble, and a new weapon wheel. The cherry on top is that Dark Forces Remaster has achievements/trophies.


Dark Forces stars Kyle Katarn, a mercenary who defected from the Galactic Empire and joined the Rebel Alliance. He’s tasked with infiltrating the Empire and foiling its plans to create an army of powerful new stormtroopers and battle droids, better known as the Dark Trooper Project. It was the first Star Wars FPS game and is remembered as one of the better Doom-inspired games of the time. 
Star Wars: Dark Forces Remaster is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. You can watch some former GI editors play the original version in this classic episode of Replay, and learn about the making of Dark Forces in this retrospective feature.</span>

However, some players have spotted a mishap related to one of the game&#x27;s main protagonists, Miles Morales. His mother is Puerto Rican, and Miles is too, which is why some players found it odd that a Cuban flag hung both inside the Morales home and outside of it. After pointing it out the mistake, developer Insomniac Games has revealed a fix is on the way, as reported by PushSquare.

                              <span>Final Fantasy XIV’s achievements are no joke, as proved by the 10 years it took the first player to earn every achievement in the MMO. But director and producer Naoki Yoshida is up for making even more difficult achievements, if the achievement-hunting pro is game for the challenge.

                              <span>Final Fantasy XIV’s latest Fan Festival took place in London over the weekend, running two days of panels with the MMO’s development team, its director Naoki ‘Yoshi-P’ Yoshida and legendary series creator Hironobu Sakaguchi. In-between announcing a new job for expansion Dawntrail, revealing anecdotes from the early days of Final Fantasy and a whole bunch of crossovers on the way, Yoshi-P and Sakaguchi found time to kick back with some very silly hijinks during the game’s boss battles.

                              <span>I always love spotting deals on budget mechanical keyboards, as they bring what is - in my mind at least - the single biggest keyboard upgrade available to prices that you can&#x27;t say no to. The LTC Neon75 is far from a big-brand choice, but the keyboard ticks all the boxes for me when it comes to features and design. There are beautiful &#x27;pudding&#x27; keycaps, a compact and convenient 75% layout, tri-mode wired/wireless connectivity and hot-swappable key switches. Its US MSRP is a reasonable-sounding $70, but now it&#x27;s available for a 50% off &#x27;overstock&#x27; price on Amazon - that&#x27;s just $35.

                              <span>When I was a kid I sort of hated Frasier. It was one of those shows you’d find in the 6pm slot on terrestrial TV, back when you had to show up for TV episodes on time or miss them forever, and as far as 10-year-old me was concerned, 6pm was Simpsons hour. Who was this strutting Seattle intellectual, with his glass of sherry and his call-in psychiatry show and his passion for silverware?
I couldn’t abide Frasier and developed a pathological aversion to headliner (and surprisingly convincing X-Man) Kelsey Grammer – but that was before The Simpsons spoofed Frasier and showed me the error of my ways. I still wouldn’t say I’m an outright Frasier fan - or Frasien, as they prefer to be known. Some of the humour is kind of eeesh, in hindsight. But I’ve experienced and enjoyed enough to find Edward La Barbera’s Fraiser Fantasy pretty funny.

                              <span>Hexworks are making some pretty comprehensive adjustments to fantasy Soulslike RPG Lords of the Fallen, rejigging the AI so that enemies won&#x27;t pursue you quite as far when you run past them, and patching how the New Game Plus options work to give players more control over the difficulty curve. The game&#x27;s latest patch, out now, allows you to choose whether to progress to a harder NG+ setting after finishing a run, or restart at the same difficulty threshold while retaining your character and progression. 


&quot;This will allow trophy hunters and completionists to seek out any outstanding tasks without having to contend with increased difficulty, should they so choose,&quot; the developers say in Lords of the Fallen&#x27;s latest patch notes. And these are just the first of &quot;some fundamental changes to ensure everyone continues to enjoy the NG+ experience&quot;, according to Hexworks. Heft that magic lantern and read on.

                              <span>As Rare famously discovered back in the 90s, if you stick a pair of eyes on an inanimate object, it immediately becomes the most adorable thing you&#x27;ve ever seen in your life. Take Subpar Pool&#x27;s cue ball. What could have been just a straightforward mash-up of pool meets golf is suddenly given a new lease of life, warmth, charm and character, just because it has little eyes and a dumb, goofy smile plastered on its face. Some of its &#x27;Chonker&#x27;-sized pool balls even have coiffed miniature moustaches for crying out loud, and they all babble cute nonsense noises at you as you ping them around its procedurally generated boards; hrnnnnngh they&#x27;re just so gosh darn endearing that I simply cannot help myself. They make Subpar Pool a very easy game to like, which is precisely why it&#x27;s so heartbreaking I can&#x27;t quite bring myself to love it in the same way I do Grapefrukt Games&#x27; previous puzzle game, Holedown.

                              <span>If you&#x27;ve been looking at the current crop of Silent Hill sequels, remakes and remasters and pining for the foggy streets and busted doorknobs of yesteryear, I recommend trying the demo for Heartworm. This is survival horror just the way Mother used to make it - before Mother read all those forbidden books and decided to sacrifice you to Samael, Lord of Serpents and Reeds. You&#x27;ve got your 3D engine with fixed camera perspectives, your thick coating of TV static, your sluggish vehicular control scheme, your enemies that could be either demons or metaphors and will murder you either way. 


There&#x27;s a big dollop of Resident Evil here, too, and a gentler dusting of Fatal Frame. The main character is driven by grief, sports a fiesty tank-and-shorts combo, and is equipped with a flash camcorder for exorcising spooks rather than a firearm. In other words, she&#x27;s the point on the Venn diagram between Jill Valentine, Miku Hinasaki and Harry Mason. The individual camera choices are more Evil than Hilly: the game frequently switches to a close-up face-on perspective when you enter a room, forcing you to step into the blindspot. That endless inter-dimensional staircase, though? Pure Team Silent. Other influences include Half-Life, Puppet Combo and Donnie Darko.


I&#x27;m pretty sold on Heartworm, though I&#x27;m still waiting for it to spark its own identity from all those grated-together shards of older horror games. So it&#x27;s a bit sad that the project is in enormous trouble.

                              <span>I know some things aren&#x27;t for me: The sitcom Friends, a small bowl exclusively filled with olives as a side dish, V-neck t-shirts. But I appreciate that while I might not get on with them, many others will enjoy the bite of an olive on its own, or the increased airflow to their larynx as they chortle at Joey doing the silly thing he does at Rachel, or whatever. Ghostrunner 2, a first-person cyberpunk slasher and sequel to Ghostrunner, has joined the echelon of things that aren&#x27;t for me but might be for you.
That&#x27;s because the game&#x27;s relentlessly unforgiving, and sets margins so small you&#x27;re rarely afforded much freedom. Sometimes it really does put you in the RGB kicks of a cyber ninja as you dash between the halves of cyborgs you&#x27;ve cleaved in two, but these moments can often be the weary culmination of agonising trial and error. If you&#x27;re into that, great! If you&#x27;re not, then I&#x27;d slink back into that shadow.

                              <span>Everybody knows some version of the story around Final Fantasy XIV: it came out, it wasn’t very good, it was remade as A Realm Reborn, and now it’s beloved. Over the decade since A Realm Reborn’s release, its reputation has grown with every single expansion. FFXIV’s producer and director Naoki Yoshida (more commonly known as Yoshi P) is now so synonymous with the game that it’s easy to forget he was only brought onto the project in 2010 - after XIV had been released, to overwhelmingly negative reviews.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been 11 long years since the unveiling of Squadron 42, Star Citizen&#x27;s singleplayer campaign, seven years since developer Cloud Imperium Games broke Squadron 42 off into a standalone purchase, five years since Crytek took them to court for allegedly breaching their CryEngine license, three years since Crytek and Cloud Imperium settled that lawsuit, and three years since director Chris Roberts sought to justify the game&#x27;s mammoth development time to Kickstarter backers, declaring that &quot;it would be doing a huge disservice to everyone working really hard on the project and all of you that are looking forward to it to deliver something that isn&#x27;t great.&quot; Well, all that waiting has finally paid off, as Squadron 42 is now officially... &quot;feature-complete&quot; and &quot;into the polishing phase&quot;, meaning that the Wing Commander-inspired space sim is almost guaranteed to release before the death of our sun.


Cloud Imperium have released a new trailer walkthrough to celebrate, which does admittedly look spaceworthy. It&#x27;s a whistle-stop tour of Squadron 42 gameplay and story materials - from dogfights in asteroid belts that use a new precision targeting feature, through &quot;OMG my CO is Gillian Anderson&quot; cinematics, to physics-based puzzling malarkey involving a Half-Life Gravity Gun-adjacent gizmo. If I were, say, Starfield developer Bethesda, I&#x27;d be particularly worried about those planetary surface flyovers. Mind you, by the time Squadron 42 launches we&#x27;ll probably be playing Starfield 2. I kid, Roberts, I kid!

                              <span>The Outlast Trials launched into Early Access on PC earlier this year, and players have been enjoying it, with more than 27,000 Steam reviews falling into the &quot;Very Positive&quot; category. If playing the game isn&#x27;t enough, you can soon listen to the game&#x27;s soundtrack on streaming services like Spotify, Apple Music, and more starting this week. 
More specifically, The Outlast Trials soundtrack will be available to stream on October 25, just in time for Halloween. Plus, in collaboration with Laced Records, developer Red Barrels has pulled back the curtains on a limited edition vinyl release for the game&#x27;s music. We have more details on all of that below, but in the meantime, Game Informer can exclusively provide a preview sampler of The Outlast Trials that you can listen to right now:

                              <span>Back in 2020,  Amazon Studios announced that it was creating a Fallout TV series. Three years after it was announced, we now know that the show will premiere on April 12, 2024. Check out the short announcement teaser below.

As is the case with many high-profile video game adaptations, the project is attached to some pretty big names. Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy (the married duo behind Westworld) are executive producers, along with Bethesda Game Studios&#x27; own Todd Howard. The show will star Walton Goggins (Justified) and Ella Purnell, who fans of gaming will recognize as the voice of Jinx in the critically acclaimed League of Legends series Arcane. Filming for the series began in July 2022.
Over the past few years, video game adaptations have been getting better and better. This year is no different, with HBO&#x27;s The Last of Us and The Super Mario Bros. Movie being two of the biggest hits of the entire year. Hopefully, Fallout with follow suit.

                              <span>Xbox will debut its new broadcast format, Xbox Partner Preview, this week where we&#x27;ll hear from its third-party partners like Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio, Remedy Entertainment, Studio Wildcard, and more. This new show will feature more than 20 minutes of trailers and new gameplay footage, and goes live at 10 a.m. PT/1 p.m. ET on Wednesday, October 25. 
You can watch the Xbox Partner Preview on Xbox-owned channels for a look at games coming to both Xbox and Windows PCs alongside new information about some upcoming Game Pass titles from the company&#x27;s third-party partners. While Microsoft finally completed its acquisition of Activision Blizzard earlier this month, Xbox says the Xbox Partner Preview &quot;will not feature any additional news, game reveals, or Game Pass information related&quot; to the deal. 


Xbox says viewers can expect the latest information on in-game activities for Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, a launch trailer for Alan Wake 2, the first gameplay for Ark: Survival Ascended, a &quot;dive into the social world of Dungeons of Hinterberg,&quot; and more. 
The Xbox Partner Preview will air at 10 a.m. PT/1 p.m. ET on Wednesday, October 25 for roughly 20 minutes. 
In the meantime, catch up on Microsoft&#x27;s $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard and then check out our list of every Activision Blizzard game Xbox now owns. Read our thoughts on Alan Wake 2 after going hands on with both an Alan Wake gameplay section and a Saga section.

                              <span>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 has only been available for three days, but the critically acclaimed sequel has already become the fastest-selling PlayStation Studios game in the brand’s history.
In a press release, Sony Interactive Entertainment states that over 2.5 million copies of the game have been sold within the first 24 hours of launch. The publisher didn’t provide a breakdown in terms of physical vs digital, but that’s an impressive number for the PS5 exclusive.
This feat continues the series&#x27; record-setting trend; 2018&#x27;s Spider-Man also became the fastest-selling first-party PS title at the time (for PS4 specifically with 3.3 million sold within the first three days of launch) and, later, became the best-selling superhero game ever in the U.S., a record it still holds today. Time will tell if this sequel can supplant its predecessor, but it&#x27;s off to a strong start regardless.

                              <span>The Metal Gear franchise has been quiet since 2018&#x27;s somewhat bizarre Metal Gear Survive. The series&#x27; creator, Hideo Kojima, publicly left Konami in 2015 shortly after the release of Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain and since then fans just weren&#x27;t sure what to expect, or even if to expect anything from the property. That changed recently when Konami finally revealed some plans for the franchise. Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater is being remade and retitled Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, and the Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Volume 1 is releasing this week.
The collection contains the NES and MSX releases of Metal Gear, Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake, Snake&#x27;s Revenge, Metal Gear Solid, Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, and additional bonuses like soundtracks, scripts, and more. It&#x27;s far from a complete collection of all things Metal Gear (hence the Volume 1 part of the title, presumably), but it arguably finally gives players access to the best of Metal Gear&#x27;s past on modern consoles. The game releases on Xbox Series X, Switch, and PC October 24, but ahead of that release, Alex Van Aken (a Metal Gear newcomer) joined me (an old Metal Gear sicko) for an extended look at almost everything the collection offers.
We had early access to the PlayStation 5 version of the game and you can check out the full video below:

                              <span>Super Mario Bros. Wonder is officially out on Switch today and in honor of the occasion, I played through the game&#x27;s opening hour. I collected a bunch of Wonder flowers, heard Mario&#x27;s new voice, rode some &quot;marshmallow buffalos&quot;, and made it to the first Bowser castle. This is far from our only coverage of Super Mario Bros. Wonder, however. You can find Game Informer&#x27;s Super Mario Bros. Wonder review here, guides for the Search Party and Flower Coins and Wonder Seeds, and you can even read the full cover story for the game online for free right here.

                              <span>LG makes some of the best monitors going, in my opinion, with their Fast IPS panels being the basis of many great gaming monitors from other manufacturers too. 
Today we&#x27;re looking at one of their first-party options, the 27GP83A, which combines a winning spec sheet with a reduced price: $279.99 for a 27-inch 1440p 165Hz gaming monitor.

Specifically, he&#x27;d like to build on Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire&#x27;s combat system, and use a &quot;scripted 3D camera&quot; that avoids some of the fuss of exploring the world and navigating the interface of Larian&#x27;s game.

                              <span>Gaurav* wakes up at 4am on Saturdays and Sundays. His routine is the same each time. He quickly turns off his alarm. He slowly shuffles out of bed, keeping the light off to avoid waking his wife and his 18-month-old son. He goes out through the bedroom door, and along the hall, to his office. He sits back in his chair, and he gets high. 


In the last nine months, Gaurav has spent £2,000 on his secret addiction. He admits to a total spend over eight years of more than double that. That is, £4,250 is the amount he admits to when talking to me – he’s never told his family. But Gaurav isn’t addicted to drugs, or alcohol or even online poker. The reason Gaurav only gets a few hours of sleep each weekend, is because he can’t stop playing FIFA Ultimate Team.

                              <span>I loved the premise of Deadnaut. It&#x27;s the tactility of chunky spaceship interfaces combined with the frustration of the corporation cheaping out on everything and not caring that it&#x27;ll get everyone killed. It&#x27;s the desperate crews exploring derelicts out on the fringes of the known, where terrible, unspeakable things have been unleashed. Alien by way of Duskers.
I didn&#x27;t love playing it, though. It was too frantic, too awkward, too short. Deadnaut Colon Signal Lost changes all those things and more. It&#x27;s more like a re-interpretation of its own ideas than a direct sequel. Consequently, it&#x27;s sanded off a little of its unique nature, but overall is a much better game.
Even though it&#x27;s a bloody roguelike. Godddd.

                              <span>Remember way back when in the depths of 2021 when we last redesigned the RPS homepage and a good number of you asked if you&#x27;d ever be able to personalise what you saw there so you didn&#x27;t miss the stuff that really mattered to you? WELL. Have I got some good news for you. Today, our tech team have launched our brand-new &quot;For You&quot; section on the RPS homepage, which shows the latest articles about any topics you&#x27;ve followed on the site. Give it a try! We&#x27;d love to hear what you think of it.

                              <span>Paradox&#x27;s space 4X strategy game Stellaris is getting a new Astral Planes expansion, in which you send ships through rifts to &quot;completely different realms of existence, where fundamentals that were certain at home may not always be true&quot;. I&#x27;ve read a few sci-fi novels in my time, and have come to the conclusion that tunnelling into other dimensions is seldom a wise move, but there&#x27;s no turning back at the threshold when you&#x27;re nurturing a mighty galactic empire, I guess. Find a trailer below in which some poor science ship pilot gets his brain fried by a crackling window of purple impossibility.

                              <span>At the beginning of September, the soundtrack for Tunic disappeared from streaming services. The composers, Lifeformed and Janice Kwan, said they&#x27;d received several false DMCA takedown notices for their work, which had resulted in the removal of both Tunic&#x27;s soundtrack from numerous platforms, as well as three more of their albums. For a while, things looked very uncertain about the likelihood of their soundtracks returning. Left without much recourse against their distributor, the composers eventually filed a counterclaim to try and better protect their work and get them back online. Thankfully, they were successful, and all four soundtracks are back where they belong.  
It&#x27;s been a messy saga about that&#x27;s highlighted several issues about how DMCA claims can be manipulated like this, and they&#x27;re not the only ones it&#x27;s happened to recently, either. Fortunately for the Tunic duo at least, the situation&#x27;s since been resolved and their soundtracks are now back where they belong - and to celebrate, they&#x27;ve released a whole new set of Tunic tracks that they describe as &quot;initial piano concepts&quot; for some of its major themes. And hey. You know me. I love a good piano collection of a video game soundtrack, so it is probably no surprise whatsoever that I&#x27;ve more or less had this on repeat for the last month. It&#x27;s so, so, so good.

                              <span>Activision Blizzard rolled out Diablo 4&#x27;s Season 2, also known as the Season of Blood, this week, together with an absolute deluge of quality-of-life improvements across console and PC. The publisher have also now launched the hitherto Battle.net-based PC version on Steam, and are trying to attract newcomers with a discount on Valve&#x27;s platform and a free 10 hour trial this weekend (that&#x27;s 19th-22nd October) for Xbox players.


Have the Season 2 updates - which you could summarise as &quot;slay vampires to get vampire powers&quot; and &quot;spend less time and have more fun grinding/farming for loot and levels&quot; - salvaged Blizzard&#x27;s action-RPG from the ashes of Season 1? I&#x27;ve been trawling the reactions this morning, and while the new Diablo appears to be evolving in the right direction, the big picture is still of a game with just as many raters as haters.

                              <span>Cor, it sure is good to be back in Commander Video’s running shoes again. I know Bit.Trip Runner and Choice Provisions’ assorted Bit.Trip rhythm games have been available on Steam for absolutely yonks (and still are, in fact), but my memories of these are all on the Nintendo Wii. That’s where I encountered most of the games first - and I haven’t really been back since. I dabbled in Runner 2 on the Wii U, but positively bounced off the 3D-ness of Runner 3 when it came to PC, preferring instead the clean, simple lines of its stark pixel sprites. 
It&#x27;s with some surprise, then, that I’ve had such a good time with Bit.Trip ReRunner, the recently released fancied up version of the auto-running original that brings its rhythmic courses kicking and screaming into that third dimension. But it’s really more of a compilation game than anything else, packing in extra protein in the form of EP soundtracks and freshly-created course selections from all eight games in the series (mashing tunes from Beat, Core, Void, Fate, Flux into a Runner-style format), as well as lots of new tricks and abilities up its sleeve. But the crown jewel in ReRunner isn’t so much the joy of getting a fresh dose of OG Runner again, but seeing what its player base has already started making with its brilliant Runner Maker level editor. Yep, much like Super Mario Maker before it, Bit.Trip has opened itself up to the whims of would-be game making audience, and they are running with it (sorry).

                              <span>The first-person action parkour sub-genre of games is a small but great one. It features the likes of EA’s Mirror’s Edge series, Respawn Entertainment’s Titanfall franchise, and One More Level’s Ghostrunner – one of my fav orite games. I first played this game two years after its 2020 release, in the summer of July 2022, jobless and depressed. It felt good to exist in a world where capitalistic business executives make inhumane decisions about the last of humanity living in their Dharma Tower, except instead of suffering under their thumb, I, or rather, protagonist Ghostrunner, took a katana straight to the top to bring it all down. The game concludes with humanity free and Ghostrunner liberated from the A.I.-powered Cybervoid trappings under a new name: Jack.

Notably, Spider-Man 2 takes place on the same open-world map as the first game and its quasi-sequel, Miles Morales. That being New York City. Similar to how Ryu Ga Gotoku Studios handles its primary Kamurocho open world in the Like a Dragon (formerly Yakuza) series, Insomniac opted for an iteration over reinvention approach for its New York City – with some big changes. Those changes are the additions of the Queens and Brooklyn boroughs on top of the existing Manhattan map and the switch from PlayStation 4 to exclusively PlayStation 5 (Spider-Man 1 and Miles Morales are also on PS5, but cross-platform). It&#x27;s on a much larger ma…</span>

With less than a week to go, the studio has released the PC specs required to run Alan Wake 2 and it looks like you&#x27;re going to need a beefy system to play it.

                              <span>Developer One More Level and publisher 505 Games have pulled back the DLC curtain plans for its upcoming first-person parkour-action game, Ghostrunner 2, ahead of its release next week. As previously announced, all Brutal Edition owners of Ghostrunner 2 will get the Season Pass, which includes all of the DLC announced today. Otherwise, the Season Pass will cost $19.99.
As for what to expect, One More Level has revealed four cosmetic packs and a new way to play the game called Endless Moto Mode. Given that we know Ghostrunner 2 features a motorbike for protagonist Jack to ride, we&#x27;re guessing this new mode has something to do with that. In each cosmetic pack, players will receive three sword skins, three hand skins, and one motorcycle skin. The first one – Ice Pack – goes live in-game on December 7. 
Check out the Ghostrunner 2 Season Pass trailer for yourself below: 


Sometime in February, the Dragon Pack will go live followed by the Heat Pack in June of next year. The Endless Moto Mode is due out sometime in September of 2024, with the Anniversary Pack following it in October. 
Buying the Brutal Edition of Ghostrunner 2 gets you all of this DLC and 48-hours of early access to the game, meaning you can jump in starting October 24 ahead of the game&#x27;s standard October 26 release date. 
For more, check out the Ghostrunner 2 soundtrack list (and listen to a full song from it right now), and then watch this gameplay trailer from earlier this year.

See below for comparison shots of the Chrysler Building in Spider-Man 1, captured on a base PlayStation 4, and the new building in Spider-Man 2. 
Sony did not respond to our request for comment in time for publish (though it might be safe to assume the reason it gave us three years ago might still be the case here. More on that below).

                              <span>The latest Pokémon Trading Card Game expansion in the Scarlet &amp; Violet series is nearly here, bringing more than 180 new cards. Paradox Rift features new Ancient and Future Pokémon, playing off a story element of the Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet games, as well as type-shifted Tera Pokémon EX cards to play off one of the core mechanics of the latest-generation video games. 
Speaking of Pokémon EX cards, Paradox Rift offers more than 15 new Pokémon EX cards, but it doesn&#x27;t stop there. Collectors and players alike can also expect more than 20 new Trainer cards, as well as 15 special illustration rare Pokémon and Supporter cards and 28 ultra rare full-art etched Pokémon EX and Supporter cards. There are even seven hyper-rare gold-etched cards to cross your fingers for.
The Pokémon Company sent along a bunch of booster packs from the Paradox Rift expansion for us to open in order to see what we could pull. After the last expansion focused squarely on the original 151 Pokémon, Paradox Rift largely shines the spotlight elsewhere (though a few Kanto creatures still show up). I loved the Yveltal and Garchomp EX cards I pulled, but my favorite is probably the Armarouge EX. I also loved the Ancient and Future Pokémon, but I&#x27;m disappointed the ones I pulled weren&#x27;t foils. However, the gold-etched Iron Valiant EX card more than made up for that.
Check out my favorite pulls in the gallery below:

SPOILERS AHEAD FOR THE END OF MARVEL’S SPIDER-MAN 2.
With Peter and Miles’ big team-up adventure now complete, developer Insomniac Games seems ready to suggest a new spider-powered hero, introducing this universe’s version of Cindy Moon, aka Silk.
Silk is a more recent addition to the Marvel canon, first appearing in the 2014 relaunch of The Amazing Spider-Man series. The character, created by Dan Slott and Humberto Ramos, is one of several heroic leads that have expanded the scope of the Spider-Man universe.

You&#x27;ll need to log in to your GI account and click &quot;okay to print&quot; for your letter or question to go through. We&#x27;d also love it if you included your location (city, state, or country will do). We&#x27;ll look through the questions and pick a few to include in our next issue, which releases on October 3.
For each issue, we ask our community a question for our SoundOff section. This time around, we want to know...
&quot;What is your proudest gaming accomplishment?&quot;
You can answer this question and/or include any other feedback/questions you want. Thank you again for your support throughout the years, and we hope many of you get the chance to have your letter printed in an upcoming issue!

                              <span>There&#x27;s fierce competition in the 2230 NVMe SSD space right now, as these pint-sized SSDs are the only ones that will fit in PC handhelds like the Steam Deck and ROG Ally. Previously Sabrent were offering the cheapest option available at the 1TB price point at £85, but now Scan has reduced the price of the WD SN740 to just £80. This is a good deal on a PCIe 4.0 2230-size SSD, offering speeds of up to 5150MB/s on the ROG Ally and around 3500MB/s for the PCIe 3.0 Steam Deck.

                              <span>Lords of the Fallen developers Hexworks are still busily carving a path through the game’s various bugs and performance issues. The latest Lords of the Fallen update, Patch v.1.1.207, is a thrilling litany of technical gremlins that have now been tracked down and slaughtered.


Amongst other things, the developers have turned off collision detection for an entire library, to avoid tanking the frame-rate when you - for reasons best known only to yourself - attack the books. In other news, the game will no longer crash itself in &quot;revenge&quot; when you hit walls too often (a rare, and rather amusing-sounding bug - best be wary when looking for secret rooms I guess). Hexworks have also identified the source of a crashing problem when playing Lords of the Fallen on Steam Deck, though the fix for that particular issue hasn’t yet passed QA. Oh, and they&#x27;ve made the continue button &quot;sexier&quot;. Look, don&#x27;t ask me, I just work here.

A change in life priorities and an absence of trusted and skilled successors were mentioned as the main reasons. The decision triggered an outpouring of support and two people have stepped forward to keep the site going. This includes &quot;God&quot;, one of FileList&#x27;s original founders.
