                              <span>When playing as Saga Anderson, you&#x27;ll need weapons to protect yourself from the creatures of the darkness. The sawed-off shotgun is one of the first weapons you can find for her. 


It packs a punch, and thanks to being sawed-off, it doesn&#x27;t take as much space in your inventory. You&#x27;ll have to do a bit of work and some smart thinking to get the weapon. This guide will show you how to solve the puzzle and acquire the sawed-off shotgun in Alan Wake 2.

Where to find sawed-off shotgun for Saga Anderson in Alan Wake 2


The sawed-off shotgun is encountered in Chapter Two: The Heart. During this chapter, you&#x27;ll have to visit the general store in Bright Falls to retrieve something in the freezer. 


Once you&#x27;re in the general store, you&#x27;ll find the shotgun in a case on the wall. The only problem is that a padlock stops you from opening it. To unlock the padlock, you need a three-digit code. Fortunately, there&#x27;s a post-it note that gives you a clue: &quot;Check with Lady Fortuna at the counter.&quot; 


Head to the counter and you&#x27;ll find a lottery ticket on top of a notepad there. There&#x27;s a bunch of three-digit numbers on the notepad which can be confusing. Look at the last two digits of the numbers on the notepad and compare them with the numbers on the lottery ticket. You&#x27;re looking for the lottery numbers that are on the notepad but haven&#x27;t been scratched out. 


The answer is 739. Head back to the padlock and enter the code from top to bottom. The shotgun is now yours. To easily equip your new weapon, assign it to your Favorites which you can do by selecting it in your inventory and selecting the Quick Draw option.

                              <span>In Starfield, Earth has become a desolate wasteland with only minimal evidence that humans ever lived there. To rectify this, someone has made our home world that little bit more lush with fresh fauna and sea life.


Over on Nexus Mods, user Ainsy has managed to restore Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, breathing a bit of life into the dead planet. While it&#x27;s not a complete restoration, the mod does give back the atmosphere, as well as the oceans, some creatures, all culminating in basically turning it into a jungle biome.

Starfield all but abandoned our planet for the main story, but this download will give you at least one more reason to revisit this extinct rock we once called terra firma.


Life finds a way...or is at least modded into existence


With life restored, Ainsy&#x27;s mod means that Earth now has some signs of life again, which includes outposts, enemy bases, and some mining facilities. So if you were hoping to land here in order to get away from danger...nope. It&#x27;s business as usual.


Since launching at the beginning of September, Starfield has been at the mercy of the modding community. New content and tweaks to the vanilla experience continue to make their way to the surface. The fan-made Community Patch - the collaborative effort of a series of modders – is also here to fix any bugs that Bethesda has yet to address.


Now that hype for the has died down, a lot of players may be starting to see the lack of staying power that something like Skyrim has. Custom mods will keep people coming back for more (on PC at least), but it won&#x27;t be long before conversations surrounding the elusive Elder Scrolls 6 begin anew.

                              <span>On Twitter, @charlieINTEL posted images of what is alleged to be an upcoming PS5 Slim bundle. The bundle features Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 along with the new PS5 Slim. 




This would have been interesting enough on its own, but things got more intriguing when Twitter user @The_Stebe zoomed in on some fine print. At the bottom of the bundle&#x27;s box is a message that reads: &quot;Internet connection required to pair Disc Drive and PS5 console upon setup.&quot; 


On the surface, this doesn&#x27;t seem like much of a problem. It says nothing about a constant connection being required, and it wouldn&#x27;t be the first PlayStation to need to be connected to the internet, as owners of the current digital version of the PS5 have to download their games from the PS Store. 


There are some fringe cases where it may be an issue. Most notably, it leaves you dependent on Sony&#x27;s servers to set up your console. Hence, in a scenario where Sony&#x27;s servers shut down, it would potentially be impossible to pair up a new disc drive with a console. 


Sony hasn&#x27;t commented on the matter. The PS5 Slim launches in November, and you&#x27;ll be able to pick from the standard version and the digital edition which you can add a standalone disc drive to.

Unlike The Walking Dead: Destinies, The Walking Dead Match 3 Tales is a puzzle RPG set within the universe of Robert Kirkman&#x27;s original comic. Through match 3 puzzles, players will combat Walkers and various other enemies while playing as various characters from the series, with each having their own set of unique skills and weapons to aid you.




Both heroes and villains are selectable in the mobile title. Characters of note include Rick, Michonne, Carl, Glenn, The Governor, Maggie, Abraham, and more.

                              <span>The psychiatrist Viktor E. Frankl posited that humans are motivated, above almost all else, to search for meaning in their lives. He would probably be unsurprised, if more than slightly confused, to see that spirit manifest in a rumour that the rubbish performance of Cities: Skylines 2 is being caused by excessive teeth.


A widely-shared reddit post suggests that rendering the highly detailed chompers of Skylines 2’s citizenry, who lack the LOD (level of detail) implementation that would reduce their model quality at a distance, is a major cause behind the game’s inability to pump out frames per second. Developers Colossal Order disagree, and have put out a statement denying this &quot;bizarre story.&quot;

                              <span>You can probably guess what’s coming. Alan Wake 2’s PC performance has been the subject of nervous uh oh-ing since well before the release of its onerous system requirements; Remedy comms director Thomas Puha even implored players to &quot;look at the image quality&quot; instead of framerates, like Dean Learner exalting the storytelling of Punch of Judy.
Actually, that’s not fair. Alan Wake 2 is much more enjoyable than Punch and Judy. And, like Remedyverse predecessor Control, there is something impressive about just how much visual tech you can choose to put on show: ray tracing, path tracing, Nvidia Ray Reconstruction, frame generation via DLSS 3, the lot. This wealth of options has produced the most intricate settings guides I’ve put together in ages, and you can consult it yourself lower down this page.

                              <span>Crytek&#x27;s Hunt: Showdown may yet receive a single-player campaign, if the stars align, as the developers dig ever deeper into the asymmetrical multiplayer shooter&#x27;s wonderfully plague-ridden narrative backdrop. Originally released out of Steam and Xbox early access in 2019, the game introduced single player PvE trials back in June 2020, much to Alice0&#x27;s enthusiasm. It also now sports a scripted, voiced tutorial in which you stalk around farmhouses, learning the ropes and murdering wooden dummies at the behest of a leathery dude in the bushes. Could some kind of proper story component follow? Crytek have certainly thought about it.

                              <span>You haven&#x27;t even downloaded Remedy&#x27;s Alan Wake 2 yet, assuming you&#x27;re planning to, which means it&#x27;s already time to start thinking about what you&#x27;ll do once you&#x27;ve finished it. Apologies, the news beat is a cruel mistress and the present is always past, but in my defence, jumping irresponsibly around the timeline does make sense for a supernatural horror game that follows two characters through different dimensions.
Remedy&#x27;s plans for the game include a chunky New Game+ mode, aka &quot;Final Draft&quot;, which will hopefully arrive in late November, and two DLC packs, Night Springs and The Lake House. The first concerns Alan Wake&#x27;s fictional in-game TV show, a homage to the Twilight Zone, while the second involves &quot;an independent government organization&quot; that can surely only be the Federal Bureau of Control.

                              <span>After weeks of in-game teases and more, Epic Games has officially confirmed that the next season of Fortnite will bring players back to Chapter 1. With Fortnite loading screens hiding secret dates that point to Chapter 1: Season 5 and props from that season landing on this current season&#x27;s map, players have remain convinced that the next season, Chapter 4: Season 5 will actually bring everyone back to an older chapter of Fortnite; now we know it&#x27;s happening. 
Today&#x27;s reveal comes by way of the official Fortnite Twitter account, which posted, &quot;Sprint (or Mantle, your choice) back to Chapter 1...see you soon 11.3.2023 #FortniteOG&quot; with an image of the Fortnite battle bus.

As you can see, the above Tweet confirms what many have been speculating: Fortnite is going back to its Chapter 1 roots. And while not officially confirmed, it&#x27;s likely the Chapter 4: Season 5 map will have some Chapter 1: Season 5 integration on it based on teases over the past few weeks. 
Fortnite Chapter 4: Season 5 launches November 3.

                              <span>Earlier this year, Atari announced that it acquired Berzerk, its sequel Frenzy, and 10 other classic arcade properties. Then, earlier this month, Atari revealed Berzerk: Recharged, the first Berzerk game since the original 1980s arcade game. At the time, the company said it was coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC, and now we know exactly when: November 9. 
&quot;On November 9, Evil Otto once again invites you to his maze of maniacal chaos in the newly reimagined Berzerk: Recharged,&quot; an Atari press release reads. &quot;The latest entry in Atari&#x27;s acclaimed Recharged series, Berzerk: Recharged will have you almost begging for mercy as you face off against Otto&#x27;s droves of robotic menaces, all while the grinning incarnation of evil draws ever nearer.&quot; 
Alongside this release date news, Atari has released some additional Berzerk: Recharged screenshots you can check out below:

                              <span>Yesterday was a great day for fans of the most emo Batman in the Caped Crusader&#x27;s cinematic history because Robert Pattinson&#x27;s suit from The Batman was seemingly added to Batman: Arkham Knight. But the fun was fleeting because just a few hours later, the suit was removed.
Strangely, the suit, which first appeared in director Matt Reeve&#x27;s 2022 The Batman, was only available in the Epic Games Store version of Arkham Knight, as noticed by GeekVibesNation on Twitter and verified by GameSpot; Game Informer was not able to check the game for the suit before it was removed.

At first, fans thought the suit was a well-made mod making the rounds online before more and more people realized it was actually added. As for why it was added, nobody knows, but Game Informer reached out to Warner Bros. Games to ask about the suit and will update this story if we learn more. 
The Batman suit joins a plethora of other movie suits already in Arkham Knight, like Michael Keaton&#x27;s from the 1989 film, Batman, or Christian Bale&#x27;s from The Dark Knight. Here&#x27;s hoping The Batman suit returns soon because if screenshots players have captured are any indication, it fits right in with the dark Gotham of Arkham Knight. 
While we all wait to learn more, read Game Informer&#x27;s reviews of Arkham Asylum, Arkham City, and Arkham Knight. After that, read Game Informer&#x27;s Batman: Arkham Origins review, which is a game that just celebrated its 10-year anniversary this week.

                              <span>The first Alan Wake game was released 13 years ago, in 2010. As is the case with any cult game, new fans have been discovering it in the years since, and a recent remaster means many more have likely played the game recently. For those who played it when it came out, however, jumping into Alan Wake 2 can be confusing. The list below outlines a handful of characters worth remembering before diving into the ocean that’s not a lake.
I fully acknowledge that simply being reminded of a character with the knowledge that they will be relevant to the sequel could be conceived as a spoiler. Some of the characters below appear in person, some only in passing in documents, but they are the ones that forced me to pause the game and do a quick Google. No major story elements of Alan Wake 2 are spoiled,…</span>

                              <span>In this week&#x27;s episode of The Game Informer Show, I&#x27;ve assembled a panel of experts – including Blake Hester and Charles Harte – to discuss Alan Wake 2, the 13-year follow-up to Remedy Entertainment&#x27;s cult classic thriller. After Charles gives the rest of us a refresher on all things Alan Wake, Blake regales us with his favorite non-spoiler moments from many hours into the newly-released sequel. Later, we talk about the written and physical comedy of Super Mario Bros. Wonder and how web gliding is a game changer in Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2.
Stick around &#x27;til the end of the show for a series of listener questions about soulmates, the afterlife, and the best years in gaming.

Dave the Diver is a game about a diver named Dave. It&#x27;s also about a restauranteur, archaeologist, marine researcher, and social media genius — also Dave. Poor ol&#x27; Dave has to wear all these hats in Dave the Diver, and living out his toilsome existence makes for one of the best games of the year and easily one of the Switch&#x27;s most clever indie games in ages thanks to its oddly gripping loop, charming writing, consistent sense of humor, and immaculate vibes.
Anyone who&#x27;s worked at a bar or restaurant with a small staff will tell you that those jobs aren&#x27;t just about prepping food, waiting on tables, or mixing cocktails. They&#x27;re full of in-between, one-time tasks, like running to the grocery store for some fresh citrus during a dinner rush or taking last-minute catering deliveries to visiting businessmen on the other side of town. These extraneous tasks that the owners can&#x27;t afford to hire someone new to take care of define working at a mom-and-pop establishment almost as much as working on the line or behind the bar.

                              <span>Suika Game is a game about fruit. It’s also one of the most addictive, yet infuriating things I’ve ever experienced.


Suika Game (aka “Watermelon Game”) on the Nintendo Switch is a charming, simple affair. You start with a box into which you are instructed to drop various fruits. When two fruits of the same type touch, they merge together into a bigger fruit, generating points. The goal is to merge as many fruits as you can to eventually create the largest fruit: a watermelon.


It feels like Suika Game should be a fun and relaxing experience. The screen is filled with colorful fruit with little faces on them. The music is bouncy, and there are satisfying little popping noises when fruits merge together. The gameplay is simple. So why do I feel like throwing my Switch against a wall?

                              <span>Occasionally, I&#x27;ll try a &quot;weird controller&quot; challenge: I mean, playing things with a DDR mat is just a fun idea. But have you ever considered beating Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom bosses with an ocarina? 


Reddit user gvmimi just did it. And for multiple fights, too!

I beat the Wind Temple Boss with my Ocarina as a controller
byu/gvmimi intearsofthekingdom


Here they are fighting the Wind Temple boss. And the Water Temple boss. And astonishingly, the Lightning Temple boss. Their goal is to beat the whole game with said Ocarina controller, which subs for a traditional control method for the Switch.


How are they doing it? As gvmimi notes: &quot;I have a program on my computer that allows me to map different musical notes/frequencies to different inputs.&quot; They also pointed out that they&#x27;ve cleared Breath of the Wild with an Ocarina, so their determination is now tenfold.


Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom will be talked about for years


When I first experienced Tears of the Kingdom in complete isolation during the review period, I knew it was going to be big when it came to showing off emergent gameplay online (bold claim, I know!). There are just so many divergent puzzle solutions that it&#x27;s a blast to see how someone else handled a problem. In fact, I specifically sought out other people who also cleared a lot of puzzles by throwing a bunch of stuff in a pile until it built a giant contraption. It was straight out of that scene in Home Alone 2 where Marv builds a little structure to help him and Harry get out of the basement of Uncle Rob and Aunt Georgette&#x27;s townhouse.


Where was I? Oh, Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is a fun game to both play and watch: which is becoming a rarity as many other AAA games rely on old open world tropes.

                              <span>Hyperstrange and Mekworx have announced that the second episode of the Early Access FPS Supplice has been released into the wild.


If you’re not familiar with it, Supplice is a new FPS built-in GZDoom. Kind of like Selaco but not quite as flashy and also available now. It’s being constructed by prominent Doom modders. I have the early access, but I’ve not made it much further than the second mission. That’s not a condemnation. I just got distracted and haven’t gone back. I guess you could interpret that as a condemnation of my attention span.


The new episode boasts five new missions, some new monsters to drill into, and “new environmental interactions. Whenever someone uses that word, I immediately think of flushing the toilet in Duke Nukem 3D. When Mekworx uses it, they mean sucking monsters out of airlocks. Those are two similar concepts, but one is much deadlier.


Supplice follows Zorah Null as she shows up for her first day on a terraforming job to instead find monsters. It’s worth noting that, unlike Doom, Supplice has more of a narrative, complete with voice acting. Like many retro-inspired shooters, the idea is to blend old and modern design. The fact that it uses an old engine just makes it more convincing.


Supplice is available in Early Access for PC already. The new episode is available now.

Another decent promotion to take advantage of involves the free Game Trial for Cult of the Lamb.

                              <span>Respawn has revealed the next season of the battle-royale FPS, titled Apex Legends: Ignite. The highlight of the new season is the electrifying new Legend: Conduit. 


For the first time ever, Cross Progression has also been added to Apex. Following the seasons electrical theme, the Storm Point map has also been energized and overhauled.




Electrifying new Legend: Conduit


A new support Legend, Conduit, makes her way to Apex Legends in Season 19. Her passive ability &quot;Savior&#x27;s Speed&quot; gives her a burst of speed specifically when running towards allies outside of her Tactical range. This syncs up with her Tactical &quot;Radiant Transfer&quot; This ability causes Conduit to send out a surge of energy to a teammate, generating temporary shields to the ally and herself. Her ultimate &quot;Energy Barricade&quot; allows her to deploy an array of shield-jamming devices that damage and slow enemies in its range. With this arsenal, Conduit has a versatile kit allowing her to cut off enemy rotations.

Energized Storm Point &amp; Cross Progression


Revamps to the Storm Point map have reduced its size while amping up the intensity, leading to players getting into more fights quicker. Players can also explore Wattston&#x27;s Town Takeover - Pylon and engage in fights at ZEUS Station. Following with the theme of Apex Legends: Ignite, the map is electrified.


With the implementation of Cross Progression, players can now brag about their collected cosmetics, badges, and achievements across all platforms and accounts. This means you can unlock a cosmetic on PC, then jump on your Xbox and still have that cosmetic.


I&#x27;ve been out of the Apex Legends loop for a while now but this seems like a great time to jump in. Cross Progression is huge and caters to casual players like me who might want to jump in here and there on different platforms.


Apex Legends: Ignite goes live on all platforms on October 31.

                              <span>Alan Wake is the cornerstone upon which Remedy Entertainment&#x27;s magnum opus rests. This magnum opus is, however, not any specific game, but their interrelationship, resulting in the creation of the Remedy Connected Universe.  


And, though Control established RCU in concrete terms, understanding how it all began is crucial.


Naturally, it all began with Alan Wake proper. As Remedy&#x27;s Sam Lake will attest, neither Quantum Break nor Max Payne are a part of the official RCU, and they will therefore be left aside for the purposes of recapping and explaining the full story of Alan Wake. We will, however, need to take a look at Control and American Nightmare to make sense of what&#x27;s been going on, and how it all sets the stage for Alan Wake 2.

Check your local library


This might be a shock to you, but there are libraries that let you rent out video games for free. While I was living in Edmonton, I used the library so much because of this. While it took a long time to get new releases (around a month typically), I was able to catch up on franchises like Resident Evil and Fire Emblem because of the library near me.

                              <span>Risk of Rain Returns, a remake of the 2013 roguelike platformer has announced its release date, and it’s sooner than you might think. You can jump into the randomly generated action in just a couple weeks, on November 8.




In a post on Twitter, the official Risk of Rain account showcased a new character, the Pilot, designed to be a crowd-control prioritized combatant. Armed with a standard Clusterfire attack and a secondary attack called Target Acquired, players can make quick work of any enemies that cross their path. 


But, they also look to be rather agile, which lets them put space between themselves and enemies. The Pilot also has a utility ability called Rapid Deployment, which makes good use of their parachute. 


Risk of Rain Returns is introducing The Pilot, in addition to another new survivor, The Drifter. The Drifter looks to be more of an up-close-and-personal melee fighter, using their sleeping bag and other everyday items as instruments of blunt force trauma. 


In addition to Risk of Rain Returns’ release date, developer Hopoo Games also announced a celebration of the series’ community called The Festival of Gup, also set to occur live on Gearbox’s Twitch on November 8 at 10:30 a.m. PST / 12:30 p.m. CST / 1:30 p.m. EST. 


Risk of Rain Returns will be available for PC and Nintendo Switch on November 8.

                              <span>It was recently brought to people&#x27;s attention that the Master Collection of Metal Gear Solid was near unplayable on Steam Deck. Fortunately, Valve has been quick off the mark, and a fix is rolling out.


According to a recent Twitter/X post from Pierre-Loup Grifais – coder for Valve – a hotifx has been deployed.  This should tend to the crashing issues people have been having with both Metal Gear Solid 2 and Metal Gear Solid 3.




As is often the case when it comes to the Steam Deck, the problem appeared to be related to compatibility issues with the device&#x27;s operating system. This new patch – sent out literally moments ago – addresses issues with Proton, the Linux-based software the Deck is built around.


What was the problem?


In a recent report/video from GamingOnLinux, the recent release of the first three Metal Gear Solid entries were shown to be not suited for the Deck. While MGS runs fine, it seems to maintain its old-school 4:3 aspect ratio, and the game is locked at 30fps. This may not be an issue for some, but others may take exception to the sizeable black borders and lower framerate.


However, at least it was running on the device. The same could not be said for the second and third games, neither of which would play at all. Both Sons of Liberty and Snake Eater were crashing to the Steam Library, meaning they couldn&#x27;t be played at all.


Given the popularity of the classic Metal Gear Solid games, it&#x27;s not surprising Valve was pretty quick to act. Hopefully, MGS2 and MGS3 should run now, as the update&#x27;s purpose is to &quot;address a blocking crash in cutscenes.&quot; At the time of writing, a fix for the missing audio in cutscenes is still being worked on.

                              <span>League of Legends publisher Riot Games debuted another in-universe music group called Heartsteel, and their debut single &quot;Paranoia&quot; dropped earlier this week on October 23. Alongside the single, several new skins are being added to the MOBA. 




Despite the boy band being completely new to the LoL world, several members of Heartsteel may sound familiar. A few of Heartsteel&#x27;s members are voiced by popular artists in real life; Kyan is voiced by Cal Scruby, K’Sante is voiced by Tobi Lou, Sett is voiced by Øzi, and Ezreal is voiced by Byun Baekhyun.


Heartsteel-inspired skins make a debut 


Players of League of Legends will not only have a chance to enjoy Heartsteel’s music, but will also be able to mimic the looks of their favorite members with new skins for each member of Heartsteel in-game. Although each member will recieve their own skin, only Kayn and Yone will get different tiers of skins. Kayn is set to recieve a skin with a Legendary status while Yone is set to get a Prestige skin, in addition to their originals. 


Fans can catch a glimpse of the new skins in Heartsteel&#x27;s &#x27;Paranoia&#x27; music video. Alongside the music video, an official skins trailer from Riot Games has also been released. The &#x27;Paranoia&#x27; skins will be available to players on November 8.




Riot Games has been debuting in-universe music groups for a while now. Some of their most popular groups were virtual K-pop group K/DA (2018) and hip hop group True Damage (2019). The in-universe music group approach that Riot Games has been taking is seeing a lot of success. K/DA blew many away with their debut single &quot;POP/STARS&quot; in 2018, which truly kicked off the League of Legends band legacy. 


Heartsteel is set to make a similarly large impact on the League of Legends universe through exciting music, entertaining visuals, and taking on the title of Riot’s first in-game boy band.

                              <span>If you&#x27;ve been waiting for the all-important Payday 3 patch to start rolling out, hopefully you won&#x27;t have much longer to wait. While there&#x27;s no release date for it just yet, the developer has at least tried to explain why it&#x27;s taking so long.


In a post on the Payday website, Starbreeze Studios has issued yet another apology, acknowledging that it&#x27;s been a bit quiet recently. However, the message &quot;lifts the curtain&quot; a little to give some insight into what the developer is working on.




It turns out the reasons behind the patch being delayed are &quot;long and complicated.&quot; As it transpires, the team has discovered &quot;critical errors&quot; which has lead to a &quot;significant risk to player progression being wiped&quot; if the problems aren&#x27;t addressed.


There&#x27;s light at the end of the tunnel


Fear not, though, as the update &quot;has been sent off and is currently going through a testing and certification process.&quot; Keep an ear out for further details as it sounds like the patch could be ready to launch soon. We just don&#x27;t know when yet.


Upon release, Payday 3 was met with largely negative feedback. For starters, unreliable matchmaking was causing headaches for many players. On top of that, the game requires a constant internet connection, even when playing solo. That alone was a thorn in many people&#x27;s sides.


While the patch has been delayed a couple of times already, many will be hopeful Starbreeze will be able to resolve the issues and get it sent out. The studio may also be considering an offline mode.

                              <span>It&#x27;s almost Halloween, so you&#x27;ll probably be wanting some horror games to see you through the end of October. How about some Capcom games, then? As of right now, the studio is temporarily discounting quite a healthy selection of its releases.


We all know that Capcom has a myriad of choices, especially when it comes to horror, so it&#x27;ll be quite unfortunate if you can&#x27;t find at least one franchise that&#x27;ll suit you.




For example: Resident Evil 4 Remake is currently 30% off (and comes as a special double pack featuring the Separate Ways DLC). Want more Resident Evil? How about Village for 60% off? Even the weaker entries (you know the ones) are discounted.


You can also get all the mainline Dead Rising games in a special Halloween Pack. Or maybe you have all the games mentioned above but want some DLC. Those are in the sale as well.


This devil...he may cry...


Of course, if horror is not your thing, there are other things in the Capcom sale. The Monster Hunter and Street Fighter series are included in the discounts as well. As is Marvel vs. Capcom. 


Hell, even Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective is 34% off. You can check out everything that&#x27;s currently on sale either by going to the developer&#x27;s website or just heading straight to Steam. It looks like the event will be going on until November 7, so you&#x27;ve got a bit of time to decide.

It&#x27;s an unexpected reveal that&#x27;s come from a fairly unassuming source: a recent livestream posted by Destiny 2 streamer Datto. Players have been asking for a better way to preview, filter, and group shaders for the longest time now, with threads explaining these cosmetics popping up every so often. 


The crux of the issue, really, comes from the fact that even though the Shaders&#x27; icons only show four colours and textures at a time, they actually hold way more of them, which can lead to situations where one picks a mostly grey shader, only for it to apply …</span>

                              <span>Alan Wake 2 is a paradox. It&#x27;s inspired by television shows like Twin Peaks, books like Paul Auster’s Book of Illusions, and games like Resident Evil 2 Remake. Yet it feels like nothing else out there. 


With its FMV scenes, mind-bending plot, and references to Control, the game is easily identified as a Remedy one, but it manages to do things even the most avid Remedy fans won’t anticipate.


I happen to be one of those avid Remedy fans and after spending several hours with the game, I feel like Alan Wake 2 may be one of the most interesting and experimental games in recent years, both in terms of its metafictional plot and unorthodox gameplay.

                              <span>Snappy roguelite Ninja or Die: Shadow of the Sun first hit PC in August, and now it&#x27;s set to dash and slash to Nintendo Switch next week.


Marvelous Europe unveiled plans for the Switch launch, which is locked in for November 1, 2023 around the world. The simplified action from developer Nao Games will be available on the Nintendo eShop for $14.99. Pre-order and you&#x27;ll get 10 percent off. Beyond its roguelite stylings, the main hooks for Ninja or Die are its speed and one-button controls. As detailed way back when we first took a look at it, you jump to where you point and slash through foes. 


You can see a very brief sample in Marvelous Europe&#x27;s announcement.




Ninja nonsense


The story of Ninja or Die has you taking on the role of a pickpocket who becomes a deadly, lightning-fast ninja. The cataclysm that caused this change also turned the ramen seller into a samurai and the maiko into a lethal geisha. Now everyone finds themselves trapped in a chaotic loop. That&#x27;s where the roguelite aspects come into play. Death can be overcome with the help of permanent upgrades and stat boosts at your village. 


With its focus on replayability, Ninja or Die might end up being a solid fit for Switch. It&#x27;s a tough entry in the sub-genre that lives up to its speedy claims. We&#x27;ll see how repeat runs pan out on Nintendo&#x27;s console when the ninja world unfolds before us very soon.

According to the post, the update also allows Steam to add new features in the future on a faster and more frequent basis. The release comes exactly one month after the beta for SteamVR 2.0 started.

                            <span class="media-object__text">
                              <span>It wasn’t so long ago that Atari revealed the next in their line of Recharged games, Berzerk Recharged, but now they’ve announced a release date for it. It will arrive for PS4, PS5, Switch, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PC, and Atari VCS on November 9, 2023.


Berzerk Recharged is an updated version of the classic 1980 arcade game by Alan McNeil. It’s maybe not as well-remembered as titles like Pac-Man or Space Invaders, but Berzerk is pretty great in its own right. The 2600 port is among my favorite games on the system, even though I’m not a huge fan of that era of games. There’s just something about the feel of Berzerk that gets my endorphins pumping.




If you don’t think you’ve ever heard of the game, it was referenced in Futurama’s season one episode, &quot;Fear of a Bot Planet.&quot; Two robots quote the game, saying, “Get the humanoid. Get the Intruder.”


As part of Sneakybox’s Recharged line of games, Berzerk Recharged will be updated with new visuals, leaderboards, and power-ups, and progression. Most importantly, I feel, is the addition of a twin-stick control scheme. 1975’s Gunfight was the first game to use the control scheme, while it would later be popularized by 1982’s Robotron 2084. I really started digging it after I played 1990’s Smash T.V., which was a spiritual successor to Robotron. I’m getting off-track here, but twin-stick is a great control scheme and should definitely benefit Berzerk’s formula.


Berzerk Recharged will release for PS4, PS5, Switch, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PC, and Atari VCS on November 9, 2023. Also, as a reminder, Berzerk Enhanced Edition will launch on Atari 2600 on November 17th alongside the Atari 2600+.

                              <span>A magnificent seven?
Unless you’re a Neo Geo diehard, Visco isn&#x27;t as recognisable as Namco, Konami, Capcom, or the other big hitters they used to roll with in the early &#x27;90s arcade scene. And, although the company made strong impressions with the likes of Vasara, the majority of its work was for SNK’s Neo Geo hardware, as represented by the seven games in this collection.
Publisher PixelHeart, who acquired a license to at least part of Visco’s library, has been mining the company’s back catalogue with real vigour recently. It has published Ganryu 2 and Andro Dunos 2, both from independent developers, as well as releasing various ports, reproductions, and even a branded bartop arcade machine. This VISCO Collection, jointly published with QUByte Interactive, is either a culmination of sorts, or another brick in the wall; but, while there are a few unfortunate omissions in the library, it remains a solid and well-represented lineup.

Switch, eh? You think it&#x27;s had its final bookend game and then another all-timer comes along to extend the library. Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom looked like the perfect finale for an extraordinary console that kicked off with Breath of the Wild, but then Nintendo goes and puts out the best 2D Mario in 30 years with Super Mario Wonder. And between those and continuing on into 2024 you&#x27;ve got fantastic games like Pikmin 4, and (hopefully) the upcoming WarioWare: Move It! and Super Mario RPG extending the bookshelf even further. It&#x27;s a heck of a console with an extraordinary library that Just. Keeps. Going.
We love it, but we&#x27;re also well aware that it&#x27;s not perfect, and as we begin sliding into the closing months of 2023, we at Team Nintendo Life have been pondering what lessons the fabled &#x27;Switch 2&#x27; really needs to learn from its long-lived predecessor. The six-and-a-half years we&#x27;ve spent with our Switches has given us ample time to discover all the wrinkles that we hope to see ironed out in future hardware, and below we look at things we believe are essential fixes, as well as a wishlist of non-essentials we&#x27;d sure like to see.

The latest Japanese charts are here courtesy of Famitsu (thanks, Gematsu) and it showcases an absolutely stellar debut from Super Mario Bros. Wonder.
Nintendo&#x27;s latest flagship platformer has managed to shift an astonishing 638,634 units since its launch on October 20th, 2023, managing almost a full 600K more than Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2, which debuted at number two. (Update: The original article stated that Mario Wonder sold 668,634 units. However, this was an error from Gematsu and we have updated our article with the correct figure.)

EA Sports FC 24 kicked off on Switch last month and, in a move that we still can&#x27;t quite believe, it runs... well. Yes, after years of full-price legacy editions, the Switch finally has a good version of the yearly football (or soccer, if you want) game under its belt — albeit with a new name slapped on the cover. Now, the latest edition of the beautiful game has been given a beautiful update, so let&#x27;s take a look at what&#x27;s involved, shall we?
Title update 4 looks to tackle a number of issues that arose shortly after the game launched including the one bug that saw the ball uncannily sticking to the dribbler&#x27;s calf allowing it to be literally run into the goal — freaky. There are also changes made to the curve on precision passes, penalty accuracy indicator errors and many more issues as well

While it might not be the announcement of a full movie, The Pokémon Company has released a new short film focused on Ryme City&#x27;s top investigator, as &#x27;Detective Pikachu and the Mystery of the Missing Flan&#x27; gives another bite-sized boost of case-cracking goodness.
The new short was shared on The Official Pokémon YouTube channel yesterday and it is really rather sweet. This one follows Detective Pikachu and Tim as they attempt to track down the latter&#x27;s missing flan — a crime that we can all agree, is completely unacceptable. At only six minutes in length, the mystery is pretty much an open-and-close case, but there is enough story here to keep things interesting. And an adorable-looking Munchlax, which never hurts.

Xbox recently held a Partner Preview event to showcase some upcoming third-party games, including the likes of Alan Wake II, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, and Ark: Survival Ascended.
One of the highlights, however, was Sega&#x27;s upcoming Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth from the talented folks over at Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio, launching January 26th, 2023 on PS5, PS4, Xbox, and PC. The game is the next mainline entry in what used to be known as the &#x27;Yakuza&#x27; franchise before its official name change, and it&#x27;s long been known for its willingness to venture into sheer absurdity.

As global companies go, Nintendo is notoriously relaxed about individuals and other companies picking from its vast catalogue of beloved IP, adapting it for their own works, and profiting from the results. Hang on, that doesn&#x27;t sound right...
In a move that surely has the Ninjaphone ringing off the hook in Nintendo Lawyer HQ, the latest release from American rapper Asianae, &#x27;Motion&#x27;, samples Koji Kondo&#x27;s Super Mario Bros. theme. If you&#x27;re thinking, &#x27;Oh, it probably has a little coin sound in the background or something,&#x27; er, no. We&#x27;ve linked the &#x27;Clean&#x27; version below (still live on YouTube, for now), which has the artist rapping over the theme pretty much as is.

                              <span>Knot the best port.
Gordian Quest, like many games of its ilk, is bogged down by dense, cumbersome menus and volumes of small text. But unlike a lot of other games in the strategy and deckbuilding genre, it&#x27;s much easier to wrap your mind around and isn&#x27;t mired in frustratingly long tutorials and steep learning curves. Weaving tabletop inspirations into deckbuilding gameplay creates a fun, replayable game that lacks teeth, but provided enough satisfaction to keep us engaged, even if its myriad of meddlesome menus made it a struggle.
The game is presumably named after the Gordian Knot, a mythical knot so difficult to untie it became a proto-Arthurian, sword-in-the-stone-type legend used to anoint Alexander the Great as the Chosen One / God-King / Emperor over the Macedonian Empire after he, as the legend has it, sliced it atwain. If that&#x27;s the case, it&#x27;s ironic that this game&#x27;s menus are so difficult to navigate that they too require some divine sense of inspiration to be able to cut through. This may sound like hyperbole, but doing something as simple as equipping a weapon felt like a Sisyphean task, even when its menus were clearly legible.

Sega may have only just released Sonic Superstars, but that doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean it&#x27;s done with Sonic Origins just yet.
The game has today received a Version 2.0.2 update. As highlighted by Sonic Stadium, this update fixes the &quot;Tails in water bug&quot;. Beyond this, there have apparently been some additional bug fixes (via Steam).

But since the long-awaited sequel has been tossed around for over a decade, it&#x27;s fair to assume not everyone has a clear memory of the events of the first game, and some people likely never got around to playing it at all. If that sounds like you, you&#x27;re in the right place; here&#x27;s everything you need to know about the first Alan Wake to prepare for the sequel.
Arriving at Bright Falls
The game takes place in the town of Bright Falls, Washington, where the titular protagonist Alan Wake is going on vacation with his wife, Alice. Wake is an author known for his Alex Casey novels, but he hasn&#x27;t written anything new in three years. After being recognized in town several times by fans (especially Rose, the waitress at a local diner), Wake receives keys…</span>

                              <span>Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2 hit PlayStation 5 exclusively last week and it&#x27;s already Sony&#x27;s fastest-selling first-party game. While we loved the game – read Game Informer&#x27;s Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2 here – once players got their hands on the game, some encountered a few bugs and issues, like one where their character model became a small white cube that looks like tofu. Plus, players discovered a Cuban flag was displayed inside and outside the Morales household rather than the expected Puerto Rican flag. A new update for Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2 out today fixes both of these issues and more. 


Version 1.001.003 is now live in-game, and it brings a few fixes to the game, including the aforementioned flag issue and white cube issue. It also addresses an issue where The Amazing 2 Suit&#x27;s spider logo appeared too bright in-game, and improves the game&#x27;s stability. Here&#x27;s the full update breakdown: 
Addressed an issue where an incorrect flag was displayed
Addressed an issue where models would not load properly after long play sessions
Addressed an issue where The Amazing 2 Suit&#x27;s Spider logo appeared too bright
Improved stability
Developer Insomniac Games has also released a statement alongside the above patch notes specifically addressing the flag issue. 
&quot;Today&#x27;s patch corrects an error where the Cuban flag was incorrectly displayed instead of the Puerto Rican flag,&quot; it reads. &quot;We understand that accurate representation matters, and greatly regret this error. We sincerely apologize and will do better in the future.&quot; 


Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2 hit PlayStation 5 exclusively on October 20.

                              <span>Alan Wake 2 is almost here – it hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on Friday, October 27. Its release this week comes after developer Remedy Entertainment delayed the game 10 days earlier this summer. While there are plenty of visual options for players playing on PC – check out Alan Wake 2&#x27;s PC spec requirements here – there are only two graphics modes for those picking it up on PS5 and Xbox Series X (and just one on Xbox Series S). But first, be sure to read Game Informer&#x27;s Alan Wake 2 review.  
Below, we&#x27;ll dive into the two graphics modes for Alan Wake 2 on PS5 and Xbox Series X, and then a handful of Game Informer editors playing the game will share the mode they&#x27;ve opted to experience Remedy&#x27;s latest in.

Remedy is known for being experimental. It mixes live-action footage into its video games, plays with player expectations, rewards those devoted to the developer’s history and gameography, and in the case of Alan Wake 2, eagerly performs big-budget lunacy for our entertainment and sometimes confusion. The highs of Alan Wake’s follow-up adventure are tall, but there are frequent lows that drag the whole experience into The Dark Place. I also encountered a number of bugs that forced frequent restarts and one full reinstallat…</span>

                              <span>Publisher CI Games and developer Hexworks released Lords of the Fallen, its soft reboot of the 2014 Lords of the Fallen, earlier this month, on Friday the 13th. It didn&#x27;t quite land for us – Game Informer gave it a 6 out of 10 – but a new update that launches later today fixes one of the major problems we had with the soulslike. That&#x27;s because the new Pumpkin Patch update that launches at 2 p.m. PT/5 p.m. ET today comes with reduced enemy density. Plus, the patch brings full crossplay to the game alongside performance and stability fixes and more. 
The Pumpkin Patch update also brings a special in-game Halloween celebration to the setting of Mournstead that starts today and ends November 2.

                              <span>Earlier this week, Microsoft revealed the launch of Starfield led to a 13% increase in overall Xbox content and services revenue in its Fiscal Year 2024 Quarter 1 financials. Now, Capcom has released its latest round of financials – the six-month period that ended in September – and in it, reveals that both income and profit are up thanks to the excellent launches of its Resident Evil 4 remake and Street Fighter 6. 
Total game sales are up from 21.3 million this time last year to 22.6 million units, resulting in a net sales increase of 53%, from 49,067 million Yen to 74,934 million Yen. Operating income is up 55%, too. As for why, Capcom points to the release of its Resident Evil 4 remake, which it released back in March, Street Fighter 6, which hits PlayStation, Xbox, and PC in June, and its Monster Hunter series. 


Resident Evil 4 has sold 5.45 million units, while Street Fighter 6 is at 2.47 million units sold. Monster Hunter Rise, with its Sunbreak expansion, has crossed 6.5 million units sold. Capcom has also revealed that its remake of Resident Evil 2 has sold more than 13 million units, with its remake of Resident Evil 3 sitting at 8 million units sold. The recently released Monster Hunter Now, a Monster Hunter take on Pokemon Go, has been downloaded more than 10 million times by players as of last week. 
Capcom says the entire Resident Evil series has sold more than 150 million units, with Monster Hunter crossing 95 million. The Street Fighter franchise sits at 52 million. Here are some other series highlights: 
Mega Man: 41 million units sold
Devil May Cry: 30 million units sold
Dragon&#x27;s Dogma: 7.9 million

After the wait was extended by a 10-day delay, the game&#x27;s release is almost here. After getting a new launch trailer yesterday that showed more of this spooky world, developer Remedy Entertainment has another pre-launch update to share: New Game+ will arrive sometime after the game&#x27;s launch. 
This New Game+ mode will allow players to retain all unlocked weapons and upgrades. Plus, it will feature a new Nightmare difficulty level and an &quot;alternative narrative&quot; that includes new manuscript pages and new video content. Remedy says it&#x27;s due sometime after launch but that the release timing of it is still to be decided. 
New Game+ coming after launch.

                              <span>Ubisoft&#x27;s multiplayer Jolly Rog &#x27;em up Skull and Bones is caught on the reefs once again. Recently tipped to appear in early fiscal year 2023-2024, it&#x27;s now due to make landfall in the publisher&#x27;s FYQ4 - sometime between January and March 2024. What&#x27;s the Golden Age of Piracy equivalent for &quot;vapourware&quot;? I&#x27;m picturing a spectral vessel like the Flying Dutchman, crewed by glum-faced producers and with a big grimacing statue of company CEO Yves Guillemot affixed to the prow.


The troubled naval combat sim isn&#x27;t the only Ubisoft project experiencing misadventures. As revealed in their latest earnings report, the publisher have also pushed back a mysterious &quot;large game&quot;, originally due to launch before the end of their current fiscal year, to the next fiscal year, which means at some point after 31st March 2024. Speculation runs rife that the anonymous blockbuster is Ubisoft Massive&#x27;s Star Wars Outlaws.

                              <span>Valve have spent the past year or so gradually updating the Steam interface, partly to bring parity across its various forms such as the handheld Steam Deck and on-the-telly Big Picture mode. Now it&#x27;s virtual reality&#x27;s turn, with the launch of SteamVR 2.0.

I hope Colossal Order are having a similarly fun time trying to fix the performance issues present in Cities: Skylines 2, which launched earlier this week. The first patch is out now and it includes optimisations for rendering, fog, depth-of-field and more designed to make the citybuilder&#x27;s framerates less gridlocked.

It&#x27;s much more common to see 27-inch monitors at this resolution, with a 24-inch screen providing a sharper image as a result of a higher DPI. This model from Chinese manufacturer Koorui also comes with a Fast IPS panel with 1ms GtG pixel response times and a 165Hz refresh rate, making it a great choice for fast-paced gaming too. 
This Koorui monitor has also been reduced in price, dropping from an initial MSRP of $400 to just $200 after a cool 50% reduction - with a $15 gift card thrown in too.

                              <span>Ask RPS returns for another installment today, this time focusing on some of our daily food and drink habits. Technically, I have mashed two supporter questions into one for this post, as to me they seemed inherently linked, because what is the point of tea/coffee if not to also have a nice biscuit and a sit down at the same time?
With that in mind, today&#x27;s questions come courtesy of caff, who asked: What is your favourite biscuit? and PolygonClassicist, who asked: What are the caffeine habits of the RPS staff? (along with the extra sub-question clarifications of: when do we like to have our coffee, espresso, tea, soda and/or energy drinks? How do we like to consume them? And how much caffeine do we all consume on a daily basis?) Come and find out how we all get through the day (in a, err, not at all dark way) below!

                              <span>OK, so there&#x27;s plenty in Worldless that won&#x27;t remind you of Silksong or its predecessor, Hollow Knight. Rather than a medieval bug exploring a labyrinth of bioluminescent rot and lore, you&#x27;re a vaguely humanoid cloud of shards and points, roaming an abstract landscape of soft curves and shafts of light. You&#x27;re Rayman but fancy, basically, and the world is no world but an uncreated expanse of elemental forces, though you&#x27;ll find you can run and jump on it much as you can the ledges of Hallownest. The combat is a different beast, too. Rather than Souls-inflected 2D hack-and-slash, it&#x27;s turn-based battling with a twist - each turn gives you a countdown in which to perform real-time combos, mixing melee and magical attacks. 


So why does Worldless make me think of Team Cherry&#x27;s work? Partly it&#x27;s the underlying touch of metroidvania, a word the press materials seem oddly hesitant to use. The map extends in all directions and you&#x27;ll need to acquire new abilities to reach certain areas. Partly, it&#x27;s the shared enchanted grotto atmosphere, with all sorts of tiny animate details festering for attention as you explore. And partly, it&#x27;s the dash move you unlock early on, and the process of chaining it with a platform-conjuring ability to unlock routes while traversing them, which puts me strongly in mind of those horizontal gauntlet runs from the Silksong trailer. All told, if you&#x27;re beginning to crisp up for lack of Hollow Knight news, you might want to give the demo a whirl ahead of Worldless&#x27;s release on (drum roll) 21st November 2023.

                              <span>This isn&#x27;t a Mega-Scoop for the Ages, but it&#x27;s a fun little story. Tucked away in one dark corner of Remedy&#x27;s latest horror extravaganza Alan Wake 2 you&#x27;ll find an arcade cabinet machine dedicated to the very first game the Finnish developer ever made.

                              <span>The Alan Wake 2 review embargo lifts today, but ours needs a bit more time in the oven. Review code only came in late Sunday night, and for a game so heavily reliant on the thrust and resolution of its story, it&#x27;s imperative I get to the end of it before I deliver my final verdict. Alas, the business of running a website does not play nicely with tight review deadlines like this, but what I can tell you after 15-odd hours of play is that it&#x27;s really sunk its claws into me good and proper. 
Alan Wake 2 is a much creepier, more unnerving kind of horror game than its predecessor, doubling down on its fiction-meets-reality schtick while also piling on the scares and interlacing it with unsettling imagery of teeth-gnashing, inkblot-stained doppelgangers to ratchet up the tension. In many ways, this is a game that owes as much to Resident Evil 7 as it does its own lineage in the genre, and the dual narratives of its two protagonists, FBI agent Saga Anderson and Alan himself, arguably make this Remedy&#x27;s most sophisticated tale yet.

                              <span>What better way to follow up my interview with Just Stop Oil than by writing about a horror game set on a haunted oil rig? The game in question is, of course, Still Wakes The Deep from Dear Esther and Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs developer The Chinese Room. Set off the coast of Scotland in the 1970s, it sees you navigating collapsing gantries and flooded rooms while avoiding an unearthly terror apparently extracted from the ocean floor. Mind you, the worst thing in the game could be the weather, which you can witness for yourself in the latest gameplay trailer below. Never mind the dreadful moaning on the other side of the pipes - how about that drizzle?

                              <span>At EGX earlier this month, climate change protestors cosplaying as the Ghostbusters interrupted a Tekken 7 tournament, spraying player screens with orange paint and attempting to make a speech before being hauled off by security. The three protestors, who were later arrested, are members of Just Stop Oil, a British activist group officially founded in February 2022 who carry out acts of nonviolent obstruction and vandalism in the hope of rallying support against the UK government granting new fossil fuel licenses and production agreements. In the case of EGX, which is run by Rock Paper Shotgun&#x27;s parent company Reedpop, Just Stop Oil were protesting against the sponsorship of one EGX stage by Barclays Bank, who have financed billions of dollars of fossil fuel investments (Barclays have provided some official comment down the page). They were also trying to call attention to oil giant Shell&#x27;s sponsorship deal with Fortnite, which includes a special themed map &quot;powered by Shell V-Power(r) NiTRO+ Premium Gasoline&quot;.
I&#x27;ve written a bit here and there about the overlap between games, video games and protest movements. I&#x27;ve also been on a JSO protest march myself - albeit, slightly by accident (no, I didn&#x27;t glue myself to anything). I was curious to hear more about the EGX protest, and specifically, whether the group&#x27;s tactical use of cosplay for both dramatic effect and subterfuge represents any broader understanding of games as a form of protest art. JSO put me in touch with Oliver Clegg, a 20-year-old student who joined the group early on and has participated in some of their better-known direct actions. The below is a transcript of that conversation which has been edited down for length and clarity.

Oproti zlib používá rychlejší algoritmus DEFLATE od Intelu a Cloudflare, dále pak SIMD instrukce procesorů x86, ARM, IBM Z a POWER9.

                              <span>In the year 2024, a new Castlevania-like title is coming our way - for the Game Boy Color.


Coming to us courtesy of Incube8 Games and the development team at Spacebot Interactive, Dracula: Dark Reign is unique in that it&#x27;s the first video game ever to be equipped with the Stoker license. Bram Stoker published his iconic novel Dracula in 1897. 













Bram&#x27;s great-grandnephew Dacre Stoker created the StokerVerse label alongside his partner Chris McAuley. The duo aims to publish games, comics, and novels under the StokerVerse banner. Each of these is inspired by the works of Bram Stoker. 


Because Dark Reign sports the StokerVerse license, it&#x27;s able to take a deep dive into the world of the 1897 novel. Players will take on the role of the story&#x27;s protagonist, Jonathan Harker, as he attempts to escape the vampire&#x27;s castle. The upcoming Game Boy Color Metroidvania title even features a never-before-seen prologue to the original book that&#x27;s pulled from Bram Stoker&#x27;s personal notes. 


Incube8 Games promises a &quot;unique blend of storytelling, exploration, and action&quot; within Dracula: Dark Reign. All of which is based on Stoker&#x27;s source material from many, many years ago. 


Dracula: Dark Reign makes its physical Game Boy Color cartridge debut in 2024 for $59.99. A future Digital Edition is also planned that will be playable via PC or Mac emulators. A demo is available for players to try out on the Dracula: Dark Reign demo page.

                              <span>Many indie titles in the past several years have taken visual inspiration from previous generations. Some draw from the NES and SNES eras, but lately more are taking cues from the PS1/N64 generation. 


These distinctive visual echoes from years past have undoubtedly made it far easier to appreciate the aesthetic while playing something notably contemporary. At least, that&#x27;s how I view many of these games, since occasional visits to previous generations can sometimes be painful.


That said, some of the best games from the last several years have retro games to thank, be they platformers, survival horror, or RPGs. Some of these are the best in their respective years with others being quite underrated gems.

                              <span>Publisher Hooded Horse and developer Slavic Magic revealed today that the upcoming medieval strategy title Manor Lords has a release date. Players will be able to don the mantle of Medieval Lord as they oversee their own medieval manor on April 26. Manor Lords will also launch as a Day One title on Game Pass for PC.




Yes, mi&#x27;lord?


Manor Lords features a unique playstyle, allowing players to manage the city-building of their manor while also fighting off threats such as bandits and rival lords. As a lord, players will exploit the local resources to build up their castle and surrounding kingdom. As you expand your settlement you will establish trade routes and master your surroundings as you seek to meet the demands of your people.


In terms of combat, Manor Leads features a real-time tactical combat system where you rally your working population in your manor as militia to join you on the battlefield. As your military is also your workforce, each death on the battlefield can result in a labor shortage once the war is over.


It was also revealed that Manor Lords will eventually make its way to consoles as well, at which time it will also be a Day One on Xbox title.


I&#x27;ve had my eye on Manor Lords since it was revealed. There was a demo during a Steam Next Fest months ago and I know a lot of people enjoyed it. Even though I didn&#x27;t get a chance to play it, the bits I saw looked like quite an experience. It looks like things have been even further optimized as well. It&#x27;s always cool when you get to build things and then also go down in first person and explore.


Manor Lords releases on April 26 on PC and as a Day One on Game Pass title.

                              <span>HoYoverse has posted a new developers discussion detailing some quality-of-life changes coming soon to Genshin Impact in Version 4.2. While the developers note they are &quot;still working on many other optimizations,&quot; the fixes revealed below should streamline several things for long-time players.


Skip prerequisites for weekly bosses


First on the list is a change to how weekly bosses are unlocked in Genshin Impact. Some weekly boss domains are normally unlocked by progressing through certain quests. If you don’t have time to complete these quests, those domains remain inaccessible in your world, meaning you don’t have easy access to valuable weekly drops.


With a new change to the weekly domains, you can now access the boss fights through the Adventurer’s Handbook starting from Adventure …</span>

In the new trailer, Ichiban arrives via dolphin (what else did you expect?) at DonDoko Island and gets free reign over the isle. We trade in the turn-based brawling and dramatic stories for quiet spearfishing and bug catching. Instead of running and battling around Kamurocho and Honolulu City, you get to swim in clear blue water and give wholesome presents to people. There are even fun mascots to cheer you on, just like Animal Crossing. Though I&#x27;m not sure these would make the cut at Nintendo.

Launching alongside the DLC pack is update 1.5. The massive update will rework warfare, companies, and how local prices works in Victoria 3. According to the video for the DLC, this is the biggest update to military, economy, and diplomacy in the grand strategy title yet.

                              <span>It&#x27;s hard to imagine blockblustery first-person shooting today without Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare&#x27;s online progression systems, which - inasmuch as you can assign this much clout to a single game or developer - transformed the genre back in 2007 by reinventing multiplayer as a kind of RPG. Shooters without COD-style gear levelling ladders do exist, not least Counter-Strike 2, but most of the juggernauts depend on such fixtures, especially now that free-to-play service models have become the norm. So it&#x27;s jarring to hear from Mackey McCandlish, one of Modern Warfare&#x27;s original developers, that the old Infinity Ward team were split over the act of using XP to unlock guns, with some worrying it would be &quot;unfair&quot;.

                              <span>Last time, you decided that present decisions deciding past events is better than that puzzle where switches turn on some things while turning off others. I can&#x27;t say I am surprised by the result, and suspect it was heavily influenced by spite, but I am very grateful to the people who stood up and explained why they like that puzzle where etc. I do try to make a case for both things but won&#x27;t pretend I understand (or appreciate) every thing in games, so I appreciate your help. This week, I ask you to pick between two ways of being there and then not. What&#x27;s better: summoning spectral animals or blink teleports?

Every October it pops up to make your Halloween season orange and flickery with a host of digital carved pumpkins on display in a lovely gallery you can take a calming walk around. I hope this comes to be a seasonal tradition on RPS as unshakeable as Skeal at Christmas. And it&#x27;s pay-what-you-can on Itch!

                              <span>When two of a game&#x27;s weapons are nailguns, you should probably expect players to be enthusiastic about construction. Following last year&#x27;s excellent Brutalist Jam map pack, Quake mappers have reunited to release another free load of levels inspired by Brutalism and concrete. The 30 maps offer good honest fragging in everything from concrete cities to murderous mystical puzzle boxes. Honestly, I&#x27;d recommend downloading the pack even if only to see the hub level and marvel at quite how good Quake can look when made for modern PCs.

It&#x27;s a turn-based tactics RPG with a Gothic historical setting, an extremely late-noughties insanity mechanic, a heavy metal soundtrack, plagues, heresy, dynastic feuding, and a protagonist with a dramatic eye scar and possibly non-metaphorical &quot;inner demons&quot;. Amongst other things, it looks like you can run people over with a horse-drawn carriage. M-Rated enough for you, edgelords? Here&#x27;s the trailer.

The developers include a few thoughts about what performance means for a management sim like Skylines 2, revealing that they considered delaying release to improve and stabilise the game, but felt that postponing launch would be &quot;unfair&quot; to those who are less bothered by such things.

                              <span>“Not everyone is Nintendo,” Hilmar Veigar Pétursson says. “Corporate entities, historically, are not very long-living. By being 30 years old, CCP is old by company standards.” As we talk, his fixation on persistence and artefact becomes clear. Though, he’s never hidden it. In 2014, Pétursson’s company, CCP, unveiled a five-metre-tall sculpture with the names of every active player in their MMO, EVE Online, etched into its surface; this year, they expanded the monument to add the names of players who have subscribed in the decade since. “I&#x27;ve been obsessed about doing things like printed books, magazines, models of EVE Online...,” Pétursson tells me, “like there&#x27;s this need to leave a footprint.” 



Pétursson has discovered a company that uses cow stem cells to 3D print calfskin. For the studio’s 30th anniversary, he plans to commission a poetry chapter inspired by Iceland’s epic history book, the Prose Edda, write it on the artificial skin, and put it in a Reykjavik museum. It would sit alongside an ancient calfskin copy of the Icelandic sagas. “It was written 1000 years ago, but as an Icelandic person, I can still read and understand what it says,” Pétursson explains. He tells me that it’s an effective way of storing data because if you sent a USB stick 1,000 years into the future, where would you even find a computer with a drive to read it? This appreciation for artefacts and need for legacy has led to his current project, a new game from CCP using blockchain technology, currently known as Project Awakening.

                              <span>American McGee has spent the past several years trying to make Alice: Asylum, a third entry in his series of action-horror games inspired by Lewis Carroll&#x27;s Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland. That fight produced a crowdfunded 414-page design bible but came to an end earlier this year when rights-holders EA rejected the pitch, and McGee declared that he had &quot;no other ideas or energy left to apply toward getting a new Alice game made.&quot;

McGee reiterated similar sentiments in a new video discussing the project&#x27;s end, but he did suggest one &quot;ray of hope&quot; to the community. &quot;The design bible as produced is the perfect thing to feed into an AI system to have it completely build the game that is outlined in that design bible.&quot;

                              <span>In 2008, Robert Downey Jr. debuted as Tony Stark in Iron Man. Outside of being an excellent movie in its own right, Iron Man proved to be one of the most influential films of the 21st century so far, paving the way to the biggest film and TV franchise of the last decade and a half, the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The post-credits sequence of Iron Man served as a teaser for what was to come, as Samuel L. Jackson&#x27;s Nick Fury informed Stark that he was a part of a bigger universe.
At the time, &quot;The Avenger Initiative&quot; felt like a throwaway tease for something that would never happen (even for those involved in writing the scene), but films starring Captain America, Thor, and Hulk started building an unprecedented interconnectivity.

                              <span>Alan Wake 2 is almost here. It hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC this Friday, on October 27, after developer Remedy Entertainment delayed it 10 days earlier this summer. With just two days until launch, Remedy released the Alan Wake 2 launch trailer during today&#x27;s Xbox Partner Preview, which is where we also saw our first gameplay from Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater and Ikaro: Will Not Die, the new game from the makers of Powerwash Simulator. 
In the trailer, we see dual protagonists Saga Anderson and the titular Alan Wake come to grips with the latter&#x27;s ability to influence the real world with words written on his typewriter. Like the game, this trailer mixes Alan Wake 2&#x27;s live-action elements with gameplay, and both look great. The gameplay continues to deliver the spooky action thrills previously seen in other trailers, and we get a new glimpse of the game&#x27;s story. 
Check out the Alan Wake 2 launch trailer for yourself below: 


Alan Wake 2 hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on October 27. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer&#x27;s hands-on with a Saga Anderson section of Alan Wake 2 and then read what we thought about playing as Alan Wake. After that, watch this Saga Anderson-focused Alan Wake 2 NGT and then check out this Alan Wake-focused NGT. Make sure your PC is ready for Alan Wake 2&#x27;s beefy system requirements, too.

                              <span>If you’ve been curious about The Finals, Embark Studios’ game show-inspired free-to-play shooter, you can sample a taste of the game in an open beta starting tomorrow. First revealed last August, the game has only been playable in closed playtests over the last year. 
A new trailer premiering during today’s Xbox Partner Preview shows off the first-person shooter, in which teams compete in virtual arenas for the delight of a cheering audience (and potential sponsors). Arenas, which are based on recognizable real-world locations, are fully destructible and can be altered by players.
The open beta adds the new Skyway Stadium to the map rotation. The beta also introduces a new game mode called Bank-It, in which four teams of three fight to gather coins, with the winner either hitting a max limit first or having the most cash banked at the end of the round. 


Players will have access to 20 weapons, 26 gadgets, and 9 abilities used to reduce targets into showers of gold coins. Item progression will feature 5 Mastery Levels per weapon as well. 
The open beta is cross-platform, so players on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and Steam can jump in. It will run until November 5. The beta includes a free battle pass with 16 exclusive, permanent rewards that carry over to the game’s eventual full launch.</span>

 We got flying dinos, stalking dinos, and swimming dinos. You&#x27;re hunting dinos, riding dinos, and hanging with dinos. And most notably, it looks great, having been rebuilt from the ground up with Unreal Engine 5. 
Check out the trailer below:


Interestingly, Survival Ascended will have cross-platform modding on all platforms, as revealed in a post on the Xbox Wire. It looks like PC players will have the ability to actually make modes, as it requires the Ark Devkit, downloaded from the Epic Launcher, but playing mods will be available for everyone.
The original Ark: Survival Evolved was released back in 2015.</span>

While what&#x27;s shown is definitely gameplay, it doesn&#x27;t appear to be final as the trailer calls it the &quot;first in-engine look.&quot; Plus, the gameplay is watermarked with a &quot;pre-alpha footage&quot; tag.
Check out the Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see in the trailer above, we see Big Boss sneaking through jungles, over wooden bridges, through World War 2-esque trenches, and more. There&#x27;s nothing pointing toward the game&#x27;s story in this trailer but it does make one thing clear: this remake is going to be beautiful if today&#x27;s showing is any indication. And the gameplay looks solid and intact – exactly what you&#x27;d imagine a 2023 remake of this 2004 classic would look like. 
Revealed back in May, coincidentally during a PlayStation Showcase, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is a from-the-ground-up remake of the third Metal Gear Solid game originally released in 2004. Like the original, this remake is a 1960s-era prequel to the Metal Gear series that tells the origin story of Big Boss. As such, it serves as a foundational narrative to the wider Metal Gear universe. 
Here are a few screenshots from today&#x27;s showing:

                              <span>Today’s Xbox Partner Preview brought us a good look at Still Wakes The Deep, the new game from The Chinese Room, a studio known for projects like Dear Esther, Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs, and Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture.
The new project has distinct horror vibes as it drops players into the shoes of a character navigating a ruined oil rig. A strange, alien-like tentacled form reaches up from beneath the roiling ocean waters – seemingly the source of the oil rig’s trouble. As the protagonist navigates the catwalks and beams of the rig, we hear distant and troubling screams. After traversing several tunnels, the first-person lead drops through a hatch into the very water that seems to be the source of the strange tendrils.
The Chinese Room is clearly interested in building atmosphere and tension in this trailer and, presumably, doing the same in the broader game. There’s clearly some awful threat at play aboard the rig, but its nature and what is happening to the others on board the rig remain a mystery.
Nonetheless, the first-person visuals and tense exploration are looking great, leaving us excited for the game’s launch on Xbox Series X/S (including Game Pass) in early 2024.</span>

                              <span>Ikaro Will Not Die is a new game from Powerwash Simulator and Velocity developer Futurlab that made its debut during today’s Xbox Partner Preview. Players presumably control Ikaro, who, as far as we can tell, has one purpose in life: to move really fast and look really cool.
The game is billed as a momentum-based action roguelite, with players zipping around neon-soaked cyberpunk world dishing out rapid melee attacks while executing air dashing and somersaults to evade and outmaneuver enemies. Check out its first trailer below. 


Ikaro Will Not Die doesn’t have a release date, but it’s coming to Xbox Series X/S and PC.</span>

Players will be able to build the island to their liking – including customizing their homes, building infrastructure, and interacting with the island&#x27;s inhabitants. You can see the mode in action below:


While Infinite Wealth is out on January 26, 2024, developer Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio has more games up its sleeve. Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name, a bridge between Yakuza 6 and Yakuza: Like A Dragon, is out this year on November 8. Additionally, back in February, the studio released Like a Dragon: Ishin, a remake of the 2014 game Ryu Ga Gotoku: Ishin, which never came to the States.</span>

                              <span>Earlier this month, Sony revealed new slim models of its PlayStation 5 hardware. Both the disc drive and digital model are getting upgrades, but alongside this news, the company also revealed a new detachable disc drive. This optional drive can be added to a new slim model of the digital PS5, turning it into a console that can use discs. It seems this drive will require an internet connection to use, however. 
Some images of a potentially upcoming Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III slim PS5 bundle have leaked online (thanks, CharlierIntel) and in the small text on the box, it says, &quot;Internet connection required to pair Disc Drive and PS5 console upon startup.&quot;
Hey, @PlayStation &amp; @cerny, we need to talk!

Understandably, many players and video game preservationists aren&#x27;t enthused about the online requirement as there could come a day when the servers the console and disc drive attach to are offline, making the optional accessory useless. Given the text on the box, it sounds like the internet connection is a one-time thing, only needed to pair the disc drive with the console, but it&#x27;s unclear if it&#x27;s required after that. 
Game Informer has reached out to PlayStation to ask about the internet connection requirement and if a connection is required beyond initial setup; we will update this story if we learn more. 
The same leaked images that you can see above also point to an unannounced Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III slim PS5 bundle that comes with the console, a DualSense controller, and the game.
For more, catch up on all the biggest Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III news from a recent COD Next livestream, and then read about how Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III won&#x27;t come to Xbox Game Pass this year, even after Microsoft acquired Activision Blizzard earlier this month.

Now, thanks to Microsoft&#x27;s Fiscal Year 2024 Quarter 1 financial results, we know more than 11 million players have played Starfield to date. Starfield&#x27;s excellent launch resulted in a 13% increase in overall Xbox content and services.

Ten od vydání letošní verze XWayland 23.1 přináší zlepšení v podpoře nastavení geometrie / rozlišení vnořeného X11 serveru, volitelnou integraci knihovny libdecor pro poskytování titulků oken či jejich dekorací. XWayland 23.2+ zase přináší dynamicky měnitelnou velikost těchto rootful oken.</span>

In fact, this is half the price of a deal we were eagerly posting about just one year ago, which really speaks to the speed at which SSD storage has collapsed in price in 2023.

Today the 48-inch model has dropped to £824 at Ebay when you use codes BONUS10 and SAVE100OLED, a great price for what is a class-leading 48-inch OLED. For context, this year&#x27;s basically identical 48-inch C3 OLED costs £1100, so you&#x27;re saving nearly £300.

                              <span>A few weeks ago I wrote about Grand Theft Auto players describing the movement of planes in random GTA promotional art as evidence of a forthcoming GTA 6 reveal, timed to intersect with the waning gibbous moon. I thought that the furore might die down after GTA 6 failed to materialise in accordance with the lunar cycle, but it turns out this rabbit hole has no bottom.
Come now, gaze upon the above, just-posted Rockstar promotional image for a new Red Dead Online outfit. To my eye, that picture looks like a weird dude in a mask, gazing at you through piles of skulls. Standard Halloween gamer fare. But it turns out that when you draw lines on it using MS Paint, you end up with the below.

                              <span>One of the most unnerving things about Geometric Interactive&#x27;s lush insect puzzler Cocoon is how intuitive it feels. For my money, anyway. The premise is perfectly brain-bending: each world contains or is contained by another world, and you&#x27;re a beetle who can not only leap between them, but pick one world up and use it as a puzzle prop inside another.
The game doesn&#x27;t really verbalise any of this: there&#x27;s no equivalent for Atreus in God Of War: Ragnarok, ostentatiously nudging you towards each solution. And yet somehow, I find myself flowing through Cocoon like I&#x27;m being poured out of a bottle, switching scales and putting together the pieces in a way that feels effortful yet graceful, earned yet... eerily frictionless. This is no reflection on my knack for solving puzzles. It&#x27;s a show of how elegantly the game is made so that while there&#x27;s difficulty, there&#x27;s rarely frustration.

                              <span>Puzzle game Suika, or &#x27;That Watermelon Game&#x27;, is currently having a bit of a moment online. It&#x27;s been available on Switch for a couple of years now in Japan, but this week it received an English eShop version, and it&#x27;s taken off a bit with streamers and Twitch folk. It&#x27;s also spawned dozens of clones, including an unofficial free web browser version that I&#x27;ve been giving a go over the last couple of lunch times to see what all the fuss is about. It&#x27;s a neat little time waster. It&#x27;s a teensy bit different to the proper Switch version, but the basic concept is the same: it&#x27;s a essentially physics-based fruit Tetris meets Threes, where you&#x27;re dropping similar-looking fruits on top of one another to combine them into even larger fruits. 
The goal is to combine them enough times to get the big watermelon for mega points, but honestly, I&#x27;m not sure how much longer I can keep playing this free version of Suika, because so many of the fruits you meet along the way to the watermelon just look so gosh darn sad that it&#x27;s breaking my heart a little. Then again, if I was a pear, I&#x27;d probably have a pretty sour-looking face, too, if I&#x27;m honest.

                              <span>I like to-do list games. Take Wytchwood, where your to-do list is stuff like &#x27;craft trap to catch lizard to use lizard eyes to craft weapon to defeat ghost to...&#x27; and so on. My Little Universe, which is clearly best played in co-op, and would be good to play with kids if you have sourced any of those from somewhere, is like a to-do list game that reduces crafting to the barest minimum. You are basically collecting raw resources and pouring them into a bottomless maw. Despite that description, it&#x27;s quite charming.

                              <span>Stretch and compress rooms to make your escape in Stretchmancer, a nice little puzzle-platformer you can play for free. Your heroic gecko is a Stretchmancer, see, able to bend the dimensions of spaces to push walls far away and draw distant objects near. This is handy when trying to defeat an evil space empire. Stretchmancer is in a similar vein to Portal: a first-person puzzle-platformer which uses one neat trick to change how you see the world, and builds on that while a baddie taunts you. It&#x27;s short, it&#x27;s free, it&#x27;s fun, and you might enjoy it slightly breaking your eyes.

                              <span>Cities: Skylines 2 is, much like the wonkily roaded, pollution-choked helltown I’ve built within it, a work in progress. Developers Colossal Order upped the citybuilding sequel’s system requirements well in advance of launch, and more recently admitted to have &quot;not achieved the benchmark we targeted&quot; for PC performance. Instead, future improvements are promised, to patch Skylines 2 into better shape.
I wish I could say that this is all just pessimism, born from an overabundance of caution and expectation management. But no, it is just a bit of a mess, one capable of putting freshly mixed concrete shoes on even the fastest graphics cards. I’ve worked out a best settings guide that, compared to the available graphics presets, can better balance performance and visuals – though be warned that this will feel more like urgent repair work than a dream remodel.

This is just a quick Codec to let you know that Konami&#x27;s stealth blockbuster bundle Metal Gear Solid - Master Collection Volume 1 is now available to buy. Did you ever play Metal Gear Solid, Snake? It&#x27;s this sprawling philosophical epic about war, surveillance, AI, nationalism and anti-heroism, a baroque metafictional saga spanning generations that is also a complex series of videogame design experiments. I know - it&#x27;s a lot to take in, Snake, but you can sort of boil the series down to the difference between two varieties of wall. There are the ones you hide behind, so as to get the drop on your foes, and there are the ones you break, because they&#x27;re fourth walls, Snake. Do you see?

                              <span>In August, Night Dive Studios announced it was remastering the classic ‘90s first-person shooter Star Wars: Dark Forces. We now know that this modernization of one of the most beloved Star Wars games is coming on February 28. 
Night Dive, a studio specializing in reviving classic games such as its remake of System Shock that launched in May, is shining up the 1995 Star Wars title with 4K resolution and a 120 fps bump (on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC). Textures and lighting have been enhanced, and controls have been modernized to support today’s gamepads. That includes platform-specific features such as gyro/motion controls, rumble, and a new weapon wheel. The cherry on top is that Dark Forces Remaster has achievements/trophies.


Dark Forces stars Kyle Katarn, a mercenary who defected from the Galactic Empire and joined the Rebel Alliance. He’s tasked with infiltrating the Empire and foiling its plans to create an army of powerful new stormtroopers and battle droids, better known as the Dark Trooper Project. It was the first Star Wars FPS game and is remembered as one of the better Doom-inspired games of the time. 
Star Wars: Dark Forces Remaster is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. You can watch some former GI editors play the original version in this classic episode of Replay, and learn about the making of Dark Forces in this retrospective feature.</span>

However, some players have spotted a mishap related to one of the game&#x27;s main protagonists, Miles Morales. His mother is Puerto Rican, and Miles is too, which is why some players found it odd that a Cuban flag hung both inside the Morales home and outside of it. After pointing it out the mistake, developer Insomniac Games has revealed a fix is on the way, as reported by PushSquare. 
In response to a tweet by Dantes61680 pointing out the incorrect flag, Insomniac&#x27;s director of community and marketing James Stevenson wrote, &quot;Fix is coming for that.&quot; As for when, that remains unclear – a post-launch patch for Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2 has not yet been released but presumably, when the …</span>

                              <span>Final Fantasy XIV’s achievements are no joke, as proved by the 10 years it took the first player to earn every achievement in the MMO. But director and producer Naoki Yoshida is up for making even more difficult achievements, if the achievement-hunting pro is game for the challenge.

                              <span>Final Fantasy XIV’s latest Fan Festival took place in London over the weekend, running two days of panels with the MMO’s development team, its director Naoki ‘Yoshi-P’ Yoshida and legendary series creator Hironobu Sakaguchi. In-between announcing a new job for expansion Dawntrail, revealing anecdotes from the early days of Final Fantasy and a whole bunch of crossovers on the way, Yoshi-P and Sakaguchi found time to kick back with some very silly hijinks during the game’s boss battles.

                              <span>I always love spotting deals on budget mechanical keyboards, as they bring what is - in my mind at least - the single biggest keyboard upgrade available to prices that you can&#x27;t say no to. The LTC Neon75 is far from a big-brand choice, but the keyboard ticks all the boxes for me when it comes to features and design. There are beautiful &#x27;pudding&#x27; keycaps, a compact and convenient 75% layout, tri-mode wired/wireless connectivity and hot-swappable key switches. Its US MSRP is a reasonable-sounding $70, but now it&#x27;s available for a 50% off &#x27;overstock&#x27; price on Amazon - that&#x27;s just $35.

                              <span>When I was a kid I sort of hated Frasier. It was one of those shows you’d find in the 6pm slot on terrestrial TV, back when you had to show up for TV episodes on time or miss them forever, and as far as 10-year-old me was concerned, 6pm was Simpsons hour. Who was this strutting Seattle intellectual, with his glass of sherry and his call-in psychiatry show and his passion for silverware?
I couldn’t abide Frasier and developed a pathological aversion to headliner (and surprisingly convincing X-Man) Kelsey Grammer – but that was before The Simpsons spoofed Frasier and showed me the error of my ways. I still wouldn’t say I’m an outright Frasier fan - or Frasien, as they prefer to be known. Some of the humour is kind of eeesh, in hindsight. But I’ve experienced and enjoyed enough to find Edward La Barbera’s Fraiser Fantasy pretty funny.

                              <span>Hexworks are making some pretty comprehensive adjustments to fantasy Soulslike RPG Lords of the Fallen, rejigging the AI so that enemies won&#x27;t pursue you quite as far when you run past them, and patching how the New Game Plus options work to give players more control over the difficulty curve. The game&#x27;s latest patch, out now, allows you to choose whether to progress to a harder NG+ setting after finishing a run, or restart at the same difficulty threshold while retaining your character and progression. 


&quot;This will allow trophy hunters and completionists to seek out any outstanding tasks without having to contend with increased difficulty, should they so choose,&quot; the developers say in Lords of the Fallen&#x27;s latest patch notes. And these are just the first of &quot;some fundamental changes to ensure everyone continues to enjoy the NG+ experience&quot;, according to Hexworks. Heft that magic lantern and read on.

                              <span>As Rare famously discovered back in the 90s, if you stick a pair of eyes on an inanimate object, it immediately becomes the most adorable thing you&#x27;ve ever seen in your life. Take Subpar Pool&#x27;s cue ball. What could have been just a straightforward mash-up of pool meets golf is suddenly given a new lease of life, warmth, charm and character, just because it has little eyes and a dumb, goofy smile plastered on its face. Some of its &#x27;Chonker&#x27;-sized pool balls even have coiffed miniature moustaches for crying out loud, and they all babble cute nonsense noises at you as you ping them around its procedurally generated boards; hrnnnnngh they&#x27;re just so gosh darn endearing that I simply cannot help myself. They make Subpar Pool a very easy game to like, which is precisely why it&#x27;s so heartbreaking I can&#x27;t quite bring myself to love it in the same way I do Grapefrukt Games&#x27; previous puzzle game, Holedown.

                              <span>If you&#x27;ve been looking at the current crop of Silent Hill sequels, remakes and remasters and pining for the foggy streets and busted doorknobs of yesteryear, I recommend trying the demo for Heartworm. This is survival horror just the way Mother used to make it - before Mother read all those forbidden books and decided to sacrifice you to Samael, Lord of Serpents and Reeds. You&#x27;ve got your 3D engine with fixed camera perspectives, your thick coating of TV static, your sluggish vehicular control scheme, your enemies that could be either demons or metaphors and will murder you either way. 


There&#x27;s a big dollop of Resident Evil here, too, and a gentler dusting of Fatal Frame. The main character is driven by grief, sports a fiesty tank-and-shorts combo, and is equipped with a flash camcorder for exorcising spooks rather than a firearm. In other words, she&#x27;s the point on the Venn diagram between Jill Valentine, Miku Hinasaki and Harry Mason. The individual camera choices are more Evil than Hilly: the game frequently switches to a close-up face-on perspective when you enter a room, forcing you to step into the blindspot. That endless inter-dimensional staircase, though? Pure Team Silent. Other influences include Half-Life, Puppet Combo and Donnie Darko.


I&#x27;m pretty sold on Heartworm, though I&#x27;m still waiting for it to spark its own identity from all those grated-together shards of older horror games. So it&#x27;s a bit sad that the project is in enormous trouble.

                              <span>I know some things aren&#x27;t for me: The sitcom Friends, a small bowl exclusively filled with olives as a side dish, V-neck t-shirts. But I appreciate that while I might not get on with them, many others will enjoy the bite of an olive on its own, or the increased airflow to their larynx as they chortle at Joey doing the silly thing he does at Rachel, or whatever. Ghostrunner 2, a first-person cyberpunk slasher and sequel to Ghostrunner, has joined the echelon of things that aren&#x27;t for me but might be for you.
That&#x27;s because the game&#x27;s relentlessly unforgiving, and sets margins so small you&#x27;re rarely afforded much freedom. Sometimes it really does put you in the RGB kicks of a cyber ninja as you dash between the halves of cyborgs you&#x27;ve cleaved in two, but these moments can often be the weary culmination of agonising trial and error. If you&#x27;re into that, great! If you&#x27;re not, then I&#x27;d slink back into that shadow.

                              <span>Everybody knows some version of the story around Final Fantasy XIV: it came out, it wasn’t very good, it was remade as A Realm Reborn, and now it’s beloved. Over the decade since A Realm Reborn’s release, its reputation has grown with every single expansion. FFXIV’s producer and director Naoki Yoshida (more commonly known as Yoshi P) is now so synonymous with the game that it’s easy to forget he was only brought onto the project in 2010 - after XIV had been released, to overwhelmingly negative reviews.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been 11 long years since the unveiling of Squadron 42, Star Citizen&#x27;s singleplayer campaign, seven years since developer Cloud Imperium Games broke Squadron 42 off into a standalone purchase, five years since Crytek took them to court for allegedly breaching their CryEngine license, three years since Crytek and Cloud Imperium settled that lawsuit, and three years since director Chris Roberts sought to justify the game&#x27;s mammoth development time to Kickstarter backers, declaring that &quot;it would be doing a huge disservice to everyone working really hard on the project and all of you that are looking forward to it to deliver something that isn&#x27;t great.&quot; Well, all that waiting has finally paid off, as Squadron 42 is now officially... &quot;feature-complete&quot; and &quot;into the polishing phase&quot;, meaning that the Wing Commander-inspired space sim is almost guaranteed to release before the death of our sun.


Cloud Imperium have released a new trailer walkthrough to celebrate, which does admittedly look spaceworthy. It&#x27;s a whistle-stop tour of Squadron 42 gameplay and story materials - from dogfights in asteroid belts that use a new precision targeting feature, through &quot;OMG my CO is Gillian Anderson&quot; cinematics, to physics-based puzzling malarkey involving a Half-Life Gravity Gun-adjacent gizmo. If I were, say, Starfield developer Bethesda, I&#x27;d be particularly worried about those planetary surface flyovers. Mind you, by the time Squadron 42 launches we&#x27;ll probably be playing Starfield 2. I kid, Roberts, I kid!

                              <span>The Outlast Trials launched into Early Access on PC earlier this year, and players have been enjoying it, with more than 27,000 Steam reviews falling into the &quot;Very Positive&quot; category. If playing the game isn&#x27;t enough, you can soon listen to the game&#x27;s soundtrack on streaming services like Spotify, Apple Music, and more starting this week. 
More specifically, The Outlast Trials soundtrack will be available to stream on October 25, just in time for Halloween. Plus, in collaboration with Laced Records, developer Red Barrels has pulled back the curtains on a limited edition vinyl release for the game&#x27;s music. We have more details on all of that below, but in the meantime, Game Informer can exclusively provide a preview sampler of The Outlast Trials that you can listen to right now:

                              <span>Back in 2020,  Amazon Studios announced that it was creating a Fallout TV series. Three years after it was announced, we now know that the show will premiere on April 12, 2024. Check out the short announcement teaser below.

As is the case with many high-profile video game adaptations, the project is attached to some pretty big names. Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy (the married duo behind Westworld) are executive producers, along with Bethesda Game Studios&#x27; own Todd Howard. The show will star Walton Goggins (Justified) and Ella Purnell, who fans of gaming will recognize as the voice of Jinx in the critically acclaimed League of Legends series Arcane. Filming for the series began in July 2022.
Over the past few years, video game adaptations have been getting better and better. This year is no different, with HBO&#x27;s The Last of Us and The Super Mario Bros. Movie being two of the biggest hits of the entire year. Hopefully, Fallout with follow suit.

                              <span>Xbox will debut its new broadcast format, Xbox Partner Preview, this week where we&#x27;ll hear from its third-party partners like Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio, Remedy Entertainment, Studio Wildcard, and more. This new show will feature more than 20 minutes of trailers and new gameplay footage, and goes live at 10 a.m. PT/1 p.m. ET on Wednesday, October 25. 
You can watch the Xbox Partner Preview on Xbox-owned channels for a look at games coming to both Xbox and Windows PCs alongside new information about some upcoming Game Pass titles from the company&#x27;s third-party partners. While Microsoft finally completed its acquisition of Activision Blizzard earlier this month, Xbox says the Xbox Partner Preview &quot;will not feature any additional news, game reveals, or Game Pass information related&quot; to the deal. 


Xbox says viewers can expect the latest information on in-game activities for Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, a launch trailer for Alan Wake 2, the first gameplay for Ark: Survival Ascended, a &quot;dive into the social world of Dungeons of Hinterberg,&quot; and more. 
The Xbox Partner Preview will air at 10 a.m. PT/1 p.m. ET on Wednesday, October 25 for roughly 20 minutes. 
In the meantime, catch up on Microsoft&#x27;s $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard and then check out our list of every Activision Blizzard game Xbox now owns. Read our thoughts on Alan Wake 2 after going hands on with both an Alan Wake gameplay section and a Saga section.

                              <span>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 has only been available for three days, but the critically acclaimed sequel has already become the fastest-selling PlayStation Studios game in the brand’s history.
In a press release, Sony Interactive Entertainment states that over 2.5 million copies of the game have been sold within the first 24 hours of launch. The publisher didn’t provide a breakdown in terms of physical vs digital, but that’s an impressive number for the PS5 exclusive.
This feat continues the series&#x27; record-setting trend; 2018&#x27;s Spider-Man also became the fastest-selling first-party PS title at the time (for PS4 specifically with 3.3 million sold within the first three days of launch) and, later, became the best-selling superhero game ever in the U.S., a record it still holds today. Time will tell if this sequel can supplant its predecessor, but it&#x27;s off to a strong start regardless.

                              <span>The Metal Gear franchise has been quiet since 2018&#x27;s somewhat bizarre Metal Gear Survive. The series&#x27; creator, Hideo Kojima, publicly left Konami in 2015 shortly after the release of Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain and since then fans just weren&#x27;t sure what to expect, or even if to expect anything from the property. That changed recently when Konami finally revealed some plans for the franchise. Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater is being remade and retitled Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, and the Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Volume 1 is releasing this week.
The collection contains the NES and MSX releases of Metal Gear, Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake, Snake&#x27;s Revenge, Metal Gear Solid, Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, and additional bonuses like soundtracks, scripts, and more. It&#x27;s far from a complete collection of all things Metal Gear (hence the Volume 1 part of the title, presumably), but it arguably finally gives players access to the best of Metal Gear&#x27;s past on modern consoles. The game releases on Xbox Series X, Switch, and PC October 24, but ahead of that release, Alex Van Aken (a Metal Gear newcomer) joined me (an old Metal Gear sicko) for an extended look at almost everything the collection offers.
We had early access to the PlayStation 5 version of the game and you can check out the full video below:

                              <span>The Alliance for Creativity and Entertainment has awarded INTERPOL&#x27;s digital piracy unit and Portuguese cybercrime police unit UNC3T for their role in the dismantling of piracy release group EVO last year. The notorious group was one of Hollywood&#x27;s prime targets and often the first to release high-quality movie screeners. The group&#x27;s leader was arrested in Portugal and will be prosecuted.

                              <span>Super Mario Bros. Wonder is officially out on Switch today and in honor of the occasion, I played through the game&#x27;s opening hour. I collected a bunch of Wonder flowers, heard Mario&#x27;s new voice, rode some &quot;marshmallow buffalos&quot;, and made it to the first Bowser castle. This is far from our only coverage of Super Mario Bros. Wonder, however. You can find Game Informer&#x27;s Super Mario Bros. Wonder review here, guides for the Search Party and Flower Coins and Wonder Seeds, and you can even read the full cover story for the game online for free right here.

                              <span>LG makes some of the best monitors going, in my opinion, with their Fast IPS panels being the basis of many great gaming monitors from other manufacturers too. 
Today we&#x27;re looking at one of their first-party options, the 27GP83A, which combines a winning spec sheet with a reduced price: $279.99 for a 27-inch 1440p 165Hz gaming monitor.

Specifically, he&#x27;d like to build on Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire&#x27;s combat system, and use a &quot;scripted 3D camera&quot; that avoids some of the fuss of exploring the world and navigating the interface of Larian&#x27;s game.

                              <span>Gaurav* wakes up at 4am on Saturdays and Sundays. His routine is the same each time. He quickly turns off his alarm. He slowly shuffles out of bed, keeping the light off to avoid waking his wife and his 18-month-old son. He goes out through the bedroom door, and along the hall, to his office. He sits back in his chair, and he gets high. 


In the last nine months, Gaurav has spent £2,000 on his secret addiction. He admits to a total spend over eight years of more than double that. That is, £4,250 is the amount he admits to when talking to me – he’s never told his family. But Gaurav isn’t addicted to drugs, or alcohol or even online poker. The reason Gaurav only gets a few hours of sleep each weekend, is because he can’t stop playing FIFA Ultimate Team.

                              <span>I loved the premise of Deadnaut. It&#x27;s the tactility of chunky spaceship interfaces combined with the frustration of the corporation cheaping out on everything and not caring that it&#x27;ll get everyone killed. It&#x27;s the desperate crews exploring derelicts out on the fringes of the known, where terrible, unspeakable things have been unleashed. Alien by way of Duskers.
I didn&#x27;t love playing it, though. It was too frantic, too awkward, too short. Deadnaut Colon Signal Lost changes all those things and more. It&#x27;s more like a re-interpretation of its own ideas than a direct sequel. Consequently, it&#x27;s sanded off a little of its unique nature, but overall is a much better game.
Even though it&#x27;s a bloody roguelike. Godddd.

                              <span>Paradox&#x27;s space 4X strategy game Stellaris is getting a new Astral Planes expansion, in which you send ships through rifts to &quot;completely different realms of existence, where fundamentals that were certain at home may not always be true&quot;. I&#x27;ve read a few sci-fi novels in my time, and have come to the conclusion that tunnelling into other dimensions is seldom a wise move, but there&#x27;s no turning back at the threshold when you&#x27;re nurturing a mighty galactic empire, I guess. Find a trailer below in which some poor science ship pilot gets his brain fried by a crackling window of purple impossibility.

                              <span>At the beginning of September, the soundtrack for Tunic disappeared from streaming services. The composers, Lifeformed and Janice Kwan, said they&#x27;d received several false DMCA takedown notices for their work, which had resulted in the removal of both Tunic&#x27;s soundtrack from numerous platforms, as well as three more of their albums. For a while, things looked very uncertain about the likelihood of their soundtracks returning. Left without much recourse against their distributor, the composers eventually filed a counterclaim to try and better protect their work and get them back online. Thankfully, they were successful, and all four soundtracks are back where they belong.  
It&#x27;s been a messy saga about that&#x27;s highlighted several issues about how DMCA claims can be manipulated like this, and they&#x27;re not the only ones it&#x27;s happened to recently, either. Fortunately for the Tunic duo at least, the situation&#x27;s since been resolved and their soundtracks are now back where they belong - and to celebrate, they&#x27;ve released a whole new set of Tunic tracks that they describe as &quot;initial piano concepts&quot; for some of its major themes. And hey. You know me. I love a good piano collection of a video game soundtrack, so it is probably no surprise whatsoever that I&#x27;ve more or less had this on repeat for the last month. It&#x27;s so, so, so good.

                              <span>Activision Blizzard rolled out Diablo 4&#x27;s Season 2, also known as the Season of Blood, this week, together with an absolute deluge of quality-of-life improvements across console and PC. The publisher have also now launched the hitherto Battle.net-based PC version on Steam, and are trying to attract newcomers with a discount on Valve&#x27;s platform and a free 10 hour trial this weekend (that&#x27;s 19th-22nd October) for Xbox players.


Have the Season 2 updates - which you could summarise as &quot;slay vampires to get vampire powers&quot; and &quot;spend less time and have more fun grinding/farming for loot and levels&quot; - salvaged Blizzard&#x27;s action-RPG from the ashes of Season 1? I&#x27;ve been trawling the reactions this morning, and while the new Diablo appears to be evolving in the right direction, the big picture is still of a game with just as many raters as haters.

                              <span>Cor, it sure is good to be back in Commander Video’s running shoes again. I know Bit.Trip Runner and Choice Provisions’ assorted Bit.Trip rhythm games have been available on Steam for absolutely yonks (and still are, in fact), but my memories of these are all on the Nintendo Wii. That’s where I encountered most of the games first - and I haven’t really been back since. I dabbled in Runner 2 on the Wii U, but positively bounced off the 3D-ness of Runner 3 when it came to PC, preferring instead the clean, simple lines of its stark pixel sprites. 
It&#x27;s with some surprise, then, that I’ve had such a good time with Bit.Trip ReRunner, the recently released fancied up version of the auto-running original that brings its rhythmic courses kicking and screaming into that third dimension. But it’s really more of a compilation game than anything else, packing in extra protein in the form of EP soundtracks and freshly-created course selections from all eight games in the series (mashing tunes from Beat, Core, Void, Fate, Flux into a Runner-style format), as well as lots of new tricks and abilities up its sleeve. But the crown jewel in ReRunner isn’t so much the joy of getting a fresh dose of OG Runner again, but seeing what its player base has already started making with its brilliant Runner Maker level editor. Yep, much like Super Mario Maker before it, Bit.Trip has opened itself up to the whims of would-be game making audience, and they are running with it (sorry).

                              <span>The first-person action parkour sub-genre of games is a small but great one. It features the likes of EA’s Mirror’s Edge series, Respawn Entertainment’s Titanfall franchise, and One More Level’s Ghostrunner – one of my fav orite games. I first played this game two years after its 2020 release, in the summer of July 2022, jobless and depressed. It felt good to exist in a world where capitalistic business executives make inhumane decisions about the last of humanity living in their Dharma Tower, except instead of suffering under their thumb, I, or rather, protagonist Ghostrunner, took a katana straight to the top to bring it all down. The game concludes with humanity free and Ghostrunner liberated from the A.I.-powered Cybervoid trappings under a new name: Jack.

Notably, Spider-Man 2 takes place on the same open-world map as the first game and its quasi-sequel, Miles Morales. That being New York City. Similar to how Ryu Ga Gotoku Studios handles its primary Kamurocho open world in the Like a Dragon (formerly Yakuza) series, Insomniac opted for an iteration over reinvention approach for its New York City – with some big changes. Those changes are the additions of the Queens and Brooklyn boroughs on top of the existing Manhattan map and the switch from PlayStation 4 to exclusively PlayStation 5 (Spider-Man 1 and Miles Morales are also on PS5, but cross-platform). It&#x27;s on a much larger ma…</span>

With less than a week to go, the studio has released the PC specs required to run Alan Wake 2 and it looks like you&#x27;re going to need a beefy system to play it.

                              <span>Developer One More Level and publisher 505 Games have pulled back the DLC curtain plans for its upcoming first-person parkour-action game, Ghostrunner 2, ahead of its release next week. As previously announced, all Brutal Edition owners of Ghostrunner 2 will get the Season Pass, which includes all of the DLC announced today. Otherwise, the Season Pass will cost $19.99.
As for what to expect, One More Level has revealed four cosmetic packs and a new way to play the game called Endless Moto Mode. Given that we know Ghostrunner 2 features a motorbike for protagonist Jack to ride, we&#x27;re guessing this new mode has something to do with that. In each cosmetic pack, players will receive three sword skins, three hand skins, and one motorcycle skin. The first one – Ice Pack – goes live in-game on December 7. 
Check out the Ghostrunner 2 Season Pass trailer for yourself below: 


Sometime in February, the Dragon Pack will go live followed by the Heat Pack in June of next year. The Endless Moto Mode is due out sometime in September of 2024, with the Anniversary Pack following it in October. 
Buying the Brutal Edition of Ghostrunner 2 gets you all of this DLC and 48-hours of early access to the game, meaning you can jump in starting October 24 ahead of the game&#x27;s standard October 26 release date. 
For more, check out the Ghostrunner 2 soundtrack list (and listen to a full song from it right now), and then watch this gameplay trailer from earlier this year.

See below for comparison shots of the Chrysler Building in Spider-Man 1, captured on a base PlayStation 4, and the new building in Spider-Man 2. 
Sony did not respond to our request for comment in time for publish (though it might be safe to assume the reason it gave us three years ago might still be the case here. More on that below).

                              <span>The latest Pokémon Trading Card Game expansion in the Scarlet &amp; Violet series is nearly here, bringing more than 180 new cards. Paradox Rift features new Ancient and Future Pokémon, playing off a story element of the Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet games, as well as type-shifted Tera Pokémon EX cards to play off one of the core mechanics of the latest-generation video games. 
Speaking of Pokémon EX cards, Paradox Rift offers more than 15 new Pokémon EX cards, but it doesn&#x27;t stop there. Collectors and players alike can also expect more than 20 new Trainer cards, as well as 15 special illustration rare Pokémon and Supporter cards and 28 ultra rare full-art etched Pokémon EX and Supporter cards. There are even seven hyper-rare gold-etched cards to cross your fingers for.
The Pokémon Company sent along a bunch of booster packs from the Paradox Rift expansion for us to open in order to see what we could pull. After the last expansion focused squarely on the original 151 Pokémon, Paradox Rift largely shines the spotlight elsewhere (though a few Kanto creatures still show up). I loved the Yveltal and Garchomp EX cards I pulled, but my favorite is probably the Armarouge EX. I also loved the Ancient and Future Pokémon, but I&#x27;m disappointed the ones I pulled weren&#x27;t foils. However, the gold-etched Iron Valiant EX card more than made up for that.
Check out my favorite pulls in the gallery below:

SPOILERS AHEAD FOR THE END OF MARVEL’S SPIDER-MAN 2.
With Peter and Miles’ big team-up adventure now complete, developer Insomniac Games seems ready to suggest a new spider-powered hero, introducing this universe’s version of Cindy Moon, aka Silk.
Silk is a more recent addition to the Marvel canon, first appearing in the 2014 relaunch of The Amazing Spider-Man series. The character, created by Dan Slott and Humberto Ramos, is one of several heroic leads that have expanded the scope of the Spider-Man universe.

You&#x27;ll need to log in to your GI account and click &quot;okay to print&quot; for your letter or question to go through. We&#x27;d also love it if you included your location (city, state, or country will do). We&#x27;ll look through the questions and pick a few to include in our next issue, which releases on October 3.
For each issue, we ask our community a question for our SoundOff section. This time around, we want to know...
&quot;What is your proudest gaming accomplishment?&quot;
You can answer this question and/or include any other feedback/questions you want. Thank you again for your support throughout the years, and we hope many of you get the chance to have your letter printed in an upcoming issue!

Motive general manager Patrick Klaus has shared new details about the game in a studio update released today, including that the Iron Man game is being developed in Unreal Engine 5. 
Motive released its Dead Space remake earlier this year, and Klaus says with that behind them, the studio&#x27;s focus &quot;has switched to the Iron Man project, giving us the opportunity to work (and play!) with another extraordinary property.&quot; He says the team is still in early pre-production and taking its time to set the best possible foundation for development, but despite that, it is finding &quot;so many opportunities to explore story, design, and gamep…</span>

However, that wasn&#x27;t final. And now, Game Informer can exclusively share the first-ever look at Return to Moria&#x27;s final map, in full detail, as well as two different variants. In the gallery below, you&#x27;ll find the final map in English, a second in English with annotations, and a third in the Runic Alphabet language from The Lord of the Rings.

                              <span>One Punch Man is great and often hilarious manga/anime about Saitama, the namesake of the franchise, who defeats every foe he encounters with one punch. It functions both as a great parody of anime characters who are constantly struggling to become stronger and as great action anime on its own. As a video game, however, it struggles somewhat as Saitama must defeat everyone in one punch, which isn&#x27;t particularly fun gameplay, forcing you to play as the many other characters of the franchise, who sadly aren&#x27;t Saitama.
One Punch Man: World is currently in closed beta and while it doesn&#x27;t particularly solve any of those issues, it does look great and showcase some impressive action. It is a free-to-play game, though, which means there are gacha mechanics and lots of different currencies to deal with. Join Marcus Stewart and me as we check out the game and share our thoughts on the One Punch Man anime.

In the technical world of city-builders, 2015’s Cities: Skylines made a name for itself as an uncompromising but delicate game where players needed to spin a variety of municipal plates to keep things in order across their fantasy cities. Eight years and millions of digital building permits later, Colossal Order has returned to construct a convincing sequel in Cities: Skylines II. The iterative additions don’t arrive without consequential imperfections, but Cities: Skylines II s…</span>

                              <span>There&#x27;s fierce competition in the 2230 NVMe SSD space right now, as these pint-sized SSDs are the only ones that will fit in PC handhelds like the Steam Deck and ROG Ally. Previously Sabrent were offering the cheapest option available at the 1TB price point at £85, but now Scan has reduced the price of the WD SN740 to just £80. This is a good deal on a PCIe 4.0 2230-size SSD, offering speeds of up to 5150MB/s on the ROG Ally and around 3500MB/s for the PCIe 3.0 Steam Deck.

                              <span>Lords of the Fallen developers Hexworks are still busily carving a path through the game’s various bugs and performance issues. The latest Lords of the Fallen update, Patch v.1.1.207, is a thrilling litany of technical gremlins that have now been tracked down and slaughtered.


Amongst other things, the developers have turned off collision detection for an entire library, to avoid tanking the frame-rate when you - for reasons best known only to yourself - attack the books. In other news, the game will no longer crash itself in &quot;revenge&quot; when you hit walls too often (a rare, and rather amusing-sounding bug - best be wary when looking for secret rooms I guess). Hexworks have also identified the source of a crashing problem when playing Lords of the Fallen on Steam Deck, though the fix for that particular issue hasn’t yet passed QA. Oh, and they&#x27;ve made the continue button &quot;sexier&quot;. Look, don&#x27;t ask me, I just work here.

It’s important to say that, because it helps with the context, and it’s context that I’m struggling with. For a follow-up, Cities: Skylines 2 is basically good. I’ll even continue playing it, which isn’t that common after a review, especially for such a timesink. This time around, it has grabbed me, and yet it&#x27;s such a small step forward that I don&#x27;t feel entirely comfortable recommending it outright.

                              <span>Roccat makes some good mechanical keyboards, especially their Vulcan line which combines &#x27;floating&#x27; low profile keycaps with pleasant tactile switches, a volume dial and a wrist rest. These keyboards are normally available around the $70 mark, but today you can pick one up from Amazon in black for $48 - a good deal for a full-size mechanical keyboard from a major brand.

                              <span>I had, shall we say, a bad experience some years ago. Several days of lying in a darkened room eating cold party leftovers were to be expected. The amount of comfort I got from playing Alpha Centauri throughout, though, was a surprise.
It&#x27;s less about mere familiarity than you&#x27;d think, given how late I first played it. Sid Meier’s Alpha Centauri By Sid Meier endures partly because its design has aged well, but mostly because it&#x27;s an unusually human 4X strategy. Its high concept story asks for interpretation, for a philosophical response. Where so many others are about the arbitrary icons of nationalism, or stock elves/insectoids/robots, it&#x27;s a game about ideology and personality. Where a sequel to Civilization&#x27;s &quot;send a colony ship into space&quot; ending could have asked &quot;what if lasers and aliens&quot;, Alpha Centauri instead asked: Where is humanity going?

                              <span>Space Tales is a new real-time strategy game from Vietnam-based Saigon Dragon, who worked with Numantian Games to develop the brilliant They Are Billions. In They Are Billions, you scraped together walls and turrets to hold off a world&#x27;s worth of undead, and prolong the miserable lives of a tiny handful of non-zombified humans at your settlement&#x27;s core. Space Tales is breezier of demeanour - like the confusingly named 2014 RTS Space Rogue, it takes inspiration from 1940s retro-futurism, with brightly coloured maps and chunky chrome unit design. But there are similarly grim overtones. The game puts you in charge of a Starship Troopers-esque expeditionary force, carving out secure nooks on very-much-inhabited alien planets and flogging them as holiday destinations.

In episode 35 of The Electronic Wireless Show podcast we briefly discuss Just Stop Oil&#x27;s game-themed protest at EGX this weekend, as well as re-highlighting a guide from the Arma 3 devs so you can tell when someone is trying to share fake war footage (originally created during the early weeks of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, but now relevant again with the spread of fake Israeli-Palestinian conflict videos). For our larger theme we discuss games that flip-reverse their theme when you least expect it, which is usually seemingly-cute games becoming horror - much like Harvest Island.
Plus: James gives us a rundown of fun games he tried at EGX, which sound very cool!

                              <span>After busting down the castle door with their chaotic, siege-based citybuilder Diplomacy Is Not An Option last year, the last thing I expected to see next from developers Door 407 was a chill, meditative puzzle game that&#x27;s just about, well, building tiny cities. In Urbo there are no sky lasers, no oncoming hordes. Nothing. Just dinky little grid-based maps, and an endless stream of tiny adorable buildings to plonk down on them in the pursuit of sweet, sweet point scores.
This being a puzzle game, the aim here is to place three buildings of the same type altogether, either in a line or right-angled cluster, at which point they&#x27;ll all shzooge together to level up to the next building type. This is where the Threes comparison comes in, though you can zhuzh more than three of the same building together if you&#x27;re smart to earn more points. But it&#x27;s not quite as simple as that. You see, your buildings will only shoump onto the tile you placed down last, and careful city planners will likely want to think about placing their buildings in reverse so they end up with their fancy new house in the place they actually want it, not in an awkward middle spot that cuts off two precious tiles from play, or awkwardly sits in the middle of another chain of dwellings accidentally. And yep, that&#x27;s where the Dorfromantik connection comes in, and I really do like it very, very much.

                              <span>Recruit an army of soldiers, accountants, demons, dogs, dog-catching robots, nanite grey goo, zombies, priests, slimes, whales, fires, nuclear bombs, vampires, and other oddities to liberate the United States in Million Monster Militia. It&#x27;s a roguelikelike deck-building strategy game where you draft units who drop onto a grid in random positions, enabling all sorts of abilities and combos depending on where they all land. It&#x27;s kinda like the roguelikelike slot machine Luck Be A Landlord dressed for a Halloween party in a turn-based tactics costume. Million Monster Militia is ropey in its current early access stage, but I have enjoyed discovering weird builds and I am cautiously curious about its future after some updates.

Pokemon being one of several new custom gametypes knocked together by intrepid Halo players using the Forge map editor&#x27;s new AI toolkit, added in the Halo Season 5: Reckoning updates, which allow you to bring campaign AI into Forge maps and tweak its behaviour at length. I choose you, Master Chief!

Yesterday’s 1.1 patch for the Steam version has now made offline play possible, but in a move that simultaneously makes loads of and absolutely no sense, it’s only available on the Steam Deck.

The free cooking game Little Chef disagreed, and dubbed my dish &#x27;Eggy Mess&#x27;. Everyone&#x27;s a critic. But it&#x27;s fun to puzzle out potential recipes, dragging ingredients into the pot, brushing my cursor against little physics-simulated spoons and plant fronds, and discovering what fresh horror I&#x27;ve concocted. It&#x27;s free and playable in your browser, so hie thee to Itch.io and get experimenting.

                              <span>Immersive sims like Dishonored or System Shock can be very fulfilling, but they are also oddly stressful. After all, the flipside of the genre mantra of solving problems through imaginative application of the tools is that when you achieve a boring solution, that&#x27;s all your fault. Did you miss the final jump while trying for a complex, third-storey infiltration in Deathloop, resulting in a sadly non-immersive firefight in the courtyard below? Did you fail to combo those magical abilities and terrain variables as the developers hoped - nay, dreamed you would, forcing you to rely on ye olde cover-shoot tactics to reach the checkpoint? Shame on you! Don&#x27;t you know how much imsims cost to develop? Go back to Open-Ended Systems School and retake that course in The Power of Choice. Also, consider playing Mosa Lina instead.

                              <span>Building a small form factor PC with the great PC cases I keep writing deals posts about? Need a great SFX-L power supply to go with it? Newegg are currently offering a deal on Corsair&#x27;s SF1000L, a compact 1000W 80+ Gold rated fully modular power supply - it&#x27;s down to $150, from $180. 
That&#x27;s still a lot, but this is quite a fair price for a 1kW PSU from a well-known manufacturer, let alone an SFX-L one as these are often more expensive due to their level of miniaturisation that is required. This basically allows you to use even the most energy-intensive CPUs or GPUs available*.

Upcoming PC game Planetiles is about tiles - they’re right there in the name! - and looks to continue the immensely satisfying chill puzzling of Dorfromantik and its ilk.

                              <span>Asus make some of the best gaming laptops going, and their Flow Z13 (discounted today!) is one of the most interesting too. It&#x27;s an ultraportable 13-inch machine with high-end specs, a 1200p (1920x1200) 120Hz touchscreen and a detchable keyboard. Plug in Asus&#x27; discrete GPU (or any other eGPU solution), and you&#x27;re left with an extremely powerful gaming machine - then unplug and you&#x27;ve got a thin and light laptop for getting work done or consuming media on the go. Nice. 
Anyway, this laptop retailed for $1300 when it first debuted last year, but now it&#x27;s down to $700 at Woot in the US. That&#x27;s a substantial savings and a good deal for a 13-inch laptop with a Core i5 12500H CPU, 16GB of DDR5 RAM and a 512GB NVMe SSD.

                              <span>Last time, you narrowly decided that a diegetic HUD is better than quick restarts. That result was a narrow victory—53% vs 47%—which shows how important it is to engage with the formation of scientific consensus. If you disagree with the newly established fact, well, you can&#x27;t quick-restart your way out of this one. Onwards! This week, I ask you to decide between two different ways your decisions can have unusual outcomes. What&#x27;s better: present decisions deciding past events, or that puzzle where switches turn on some things while turning off others?

                              <span>Two people connected to T411, once France&#x27;s most-visited torrent site, have been handed prison sentences by a Criminal Court in Rennes. The pair, who were tracked down through PayPal records and IP-addresses, are also on the hook for 489 million euros in piracy damages. One of the defendants, a Ukrainian sysop living in Sweden, informs TorrentFreak that he will appeal the judgement.

This week, Sky and anti-piracy group FACT reported a similar operation using clear and unusually specific language. That&#x27;s a welcome change; back in January, police forces all over the UK were instructed not to discuss visit numbers due to fears that the deterrent effect would be watered down.
