                              <span>Capcom&#x27;s 7-in-1 retro collection arrives later this year.
Capcom is gearing up to release its Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection on the Switch later this year, and as part of this, it&#x27;s spotlighting each game with a new trailer. The latest one features Marvel Super Heroes, which originally made its debut in arcades in 1995 and followed with a home console release in 1997.
This is the second fighting game crossover with Marvel, featuring an all-star cast made up of characters like Spider-Man, Iron-Man and various other heroes and villains. You&#x27;ll be able to &quot;pummel your opponents with air combos&quot; and &quot;use powerful gem abilities&quot; to control the battle. As part of this collection, there will also be a training mode and digital museum to browse.

                              <span>Black Myth: Wukong is an action RPG that leans a bit into the Souls camp and a bit into the adventure camp. And either way, it&#x27;s a spectacular journey that works for mostly everyone: those after challenging fights against Chinese mythological creatures, and those after the same thing, but with a little less challenge than your typical Soulslikes. What separates Black Myth from the crowd, though, is its slick presentation and a sense of generosity. You&#x27;re to witness the most lavish, cinematic worlds and its creatures. And you&#x27;re to enjoy battering everything with your staff as a highly athletic monkey with copious spells at his furry follicles and fingertips. It&#x27;s been a while since I&#x27;ve played anything quite as impressive as this.

As is tradition for big 2.0-style updates, some players absolutely loathe it, with recent Steam user reviews dragging the consensus underwater.

                              <span>Any gags I could make about an update that lets Total War: Warhammer 3’s dawi play tall are far too obvious for the discerning comedic palette that brought you such bangers as that time I just wrote “(penis)” a bunch so the Overkill’s Walking Dead page wouldn’t quote me out of context, so let’s just dive right in to the details. The strategy game’s 5.2 update is on the horizon, and tagging along with it are the first of the “extra bits” the team teased in June. I’m very excited about them. They sit somewhere between the usual patch fare of stat tweaks and errata, and the weightier faction facelifts that come alongside paid DLC. They’re also focused right where Immortal Empires needs them the most: depth, rather than width. In the dawi’s case, quite literally.

                              <span>The mountain biking of Lonely Mountains: Downhill was sometimes a relaxing ride down gentle slopes, and at other times a hairy hurtle down declivitous cliffs. Alongside the likes of the Descenders and Riders Republic, it offered a more laid-back game, open to furious time trialling but always remembering to let you stop and appreciate the view. Both the stakes and the poly count were low. Happy news then, that it is getting a snowy sequel. In Lonely Mountains: Snow Riders you&#x27;ll be swapping your bike for a pair of skis, and you&#x27;ll be able to barrel down the mountainside with friends in co-op.

                              <span>For years, our PC storage has wobbled and buckled beneath the tyranny of gigantic Call Of Duty installs. Like 13th century peasants straining to convey huge, teetering loads of freshly quarried LMGs, our SSDs cry out for justice. Perhaps scenting imminent rebellion and a mass audience desertion to low-poly shooters with more civilised file sizes, Activision have relented. Future installations of the much-padded FPS will be &quot;smaller and more customised&quot;, though in a last cruel stroke of villainy, they want you to download a large update to prepare the ground.

                              <span>It wasn’t long ago that Owlcat Games (Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader, Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous) announced that they were getting into the publishing business, and now they’re ready to show off their partnership with Emotion Spark Studio to publish their upcoming adventure game, Rue Valley.


They’ve provided the first real trailer for Rue Valley, which helps show off the game’s detailed art style. The game is about a man trapped in a time loop. While stuck here, they need to interact with the various characters in the area to try and figure out what’s going on. The press release mentions that players will be able to alter their approach and personality each time the game loops, which makes this sound like Groundhog’s Day. I’m not sure I’ve met a game similar to Groundhog’s Day that I didn’t like.




Even with the trailer, it’s a bit difficult to really grok how Rue Valley plays. It’s clear that it’s choice-based and features dialogue trees, but then there’s also splashing in puddles and vomiting. Apparently, you do all this talking and puking in order to gather evidence that will enable you to escape.


The art style seems to be the central focus here. It has a graphic novel-like appearance and takes cues from Into the Spider-Verse and Disco Elysium. It’s simultaneously cartoonish and detailed, which gives it a good effect.


I think it looks interesting. I enjoy time loop games, for the most part, even if they’re something of a rarity. The Legend of Zelda: Majora’s Mask is a pretty high-profile example, but even the new Earth Defense Force 6 got in on the time-twisting.


No release date has been provided for Rue Valley, and only PC has been stated as a platform.

                              <span>Fortnite&#x27;s Chapter 5, Season 4: Absolute Doom is all about joining the fight against Doctor Doom alongside your favorite Avengers characters. You&#x27;ll encounter quests along the way, from eliminating players with specific weapons to discovering the newly-added Dr Doom and Avenger&#x27;s Chests this season.


Where to find Dr Doom and Avenger&#x27;s Chests in Fortnite 


Dr Doom and Avenger&#x27;s Chests are exclusive rare chests found in the three Doom POIs on the northern side of your Fortnite map and in The Raft. Below is every location where you&#x27;ll find these chests:



Castle Doom


Doom&#x27;s Courtyard


Doomstadt


The Raft



While normal treasure chests are small and wooden, these appear as much larger green crates with a symbol on top. They&#x27;ll also glow orange and appear as a treasure chest on the radial wheel in the center of your screen if you have visual sound effects turned on, much like regular chests.

Fortunately, they have pre-determined spots, so you can memorize their locations. While I have yet to find them all, the picture above shows one I spotted in a tower in The Raft, and I&#x27;ve also seen one on the upper floors of Castle Doom.


Dr Doom and Avenger&#x27;s Chests often have valuable rare, epic, and occasionally legendary-grade items inside. More often than not, you&#x27;ll find weapons and consumables that&#x27;ll help you during your match or ongoing event quests. Just be careful, as you&#x27;ll often find other players going for these chests and defeating nearby bosses. Watch your surroundings, and use any loot you find to take out others before focusing on upgrading your setup.

                              <span>If you&#x27;re unhappy with the default plays in offense and/or defense in Madden NFL 25, you can choose to change them to your liking.


Not every playbook plays out in the same fashion, and certain ones will align better with your squad. Then there are the ones like Cleveland&#x27;s defense, which works well with almost every team I have tried so far. The same applies to offense - I love the Miami Dolphins&#x27; offensive playbook for their motion plays. By changing the default playbooks, which is really easy, you can customize your in-game experience as much as you want.


How to switch playbooks in Madden NFL 25


The default playbooks can be changed from the main in-game settings.



Go to the Game Options tab in settings.


Scroll down to go to the default offensive and defensive playbook section.

The critically acclaimed game from CD Projekt Red has won over 200 Game of the Year awards and is often considered one of the best RPG games of all time.


Even though The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt came out all the way back in 2015, it is still a game worth exploring, as the game takes you on an adventure as Geralt of Rivia, a Witcher who slays monsters for coin.


PS Plus Game Catalogue for August 2024


Among the list of games coming to the Game Catalogue for PS Plus Extra members, is Cult of the Lamb. The roguelike game from indie developer Massive Monster and publisher Devolver Digital is another headliner in the PS Plus titles for August 2024. Player…</span>

                              <span>As part of today&#x27;s RuneScape Ahead, developer Jagex revealed the upcoming roadmap for the popular MMORPG RuneScape, through the rest of 2024 and into 2025. Players can expect to see 110 skilling updates, new combat bosses, new storylines, a highly requested new area expansion, and the addition of the highly-anticipated Group Ironman mode.




The new Group Ironman mode will allow up to five friends to start a brand new RuneScape adventure without any sort of XP bonuses and without the ability to benefit in any way from players outside of the group they start with. In an effort to make the mode more functional, those participating in Group Ironman mode will have access to Group Storage as well as unique rewards including cosmetics and milestone capes. The new mode is expected to be released later this year alongside the new Harvest Hollow seasonal event and the addition of a new Necromancy Conjure Ability titled Phantom Guardian.


Before the new mode, players can expect to see the release of an all-new boss dungeon called the Sanctum of Rebirth alongside a skilling update to 110 Mining and Smithing, and a new skilling boss titled Gate of Elidnis with its own launch event and story quest.


Heading into 2025, 110 Runecrafting and Crafting will also get a skilling update, as well as a skilling rebalance and the addition of two new story quests and a new combat bass, the Amascut Showdown. Finally, in late 2025, a new area expansion is planned for release in RuneScape.


Those interested in seeing the future of RuneScape as the developers delve into more detail about the new roadmap can do so by checking out a special live stream taking place tomorrow, August 16 on the official RuneScape Twitch channel.

                              <span>In Madden NFL 25 Franchise mode games, you can add an extra layer of complexity by fine-tuning the Game Style.


Quite different from the in-game difficulty modes on offer, Game Style determines how the AI will play. From reacting to your selected play to managing the subs, there are three different styles of AI you can use in a game. Naturally, all three are pretty different, but there&#x27;s no right or wrong choice. When it comes to Franchise mode, one particular style certainly outdoes the remaining options.


What are the three Game Style in Madden NFL 25?


There are three different options to choose from.

                              <span>Life sim contender Inzoi is hoping to knock The Sims from its perch when it launches (supposedly) later this year. There will soon be an opportunity to judge whether that feat is likely. Krafton have announced that they&#x27;re releasing a time-limited trial of Inzoi&#x27;s character creator next week on August 20th.

                              <span>I am forever looking for a game to replace Transport Tycoon (or OpenTTD) in my affections. I know there are several railway management sims kicking around Steam, but I haven&#x27;t found the one that does it for me yet. Could it be Railroad Corporation 2? It&#x27;s a train tycoon game in which you lay tracks through the early 20th century, and it&#x27;s launching in Early Access on September 9th.

It now has a release date: September 17th.

Let&#x27;s Build A Dungeon marries the business aspects of Game Dev Tycoon with a more hands-on approach to constructing your company&#x27;s game, and there&#x27;s a first trailer below.

Last time I checked in, it was school trips to other dimensions. Now, it&#x27;s Cosmic Storms. Due for release alongside the Stellaris 3.13 Vela update on September 10th, these are a paid &quot;mechanical expansion&quot; (priced at a rather chunky £11, $13 or €13, and available as part of the current season pass) that builds upon the game&#x27;s existing Space Storms, &quot;providing a deeper experience with strategically meaningful gameplay and beautiful upgraded visuals&quot;. Wash that down with new civics, precursor narratives, anomalies, archaeology sites, techs, edicts, a new Ascension perk, and new galactic community resolutions.

It now has a release date - 23rd September 2024.

Also, Trevor’s been banging on about lady Custodes for five months straight and nobody wants to be around him right now. Thank the Omni-trevor, then, for the three-player co-op of Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2. “Warhammer with the boys?” said Horace as he stretchily dished out preview keys from an entirely different postcode. James, Edwin and Nic were initially all booked-up for the week, but Horace repeated himself, making it absolutely clear that it wasn’t a question.

                              <span>Earlier this week there was some minor Discourse about the removal of the Erotica photography tag from the Dead Rising remaster. Some readers characterised this as a familiar species of cultural hypocrisy regarding video games - emphasising violence is A-OK, but for the love of god, don&#x27;t mention sex. Good news, those people: Dread XP&#x27;s latest horror signing The Lacerator has both. It casts you as hirsute 1980s porn star Max - surname not given in press release, but presumably something like Jackin&#x27; or Girth - who has been abducted by a large scary individual called the Lacerator.

                              <span>I was all set to plunge into Blackbird and Gearbox&#x27;s Homeworld 3 this spring when I received a slightly underwhelmed intergalactic transmission from Nic, praising the game&#x27;s atmosphere and story while ruminating over fussy controls and a want of tactical depth. Like a herd of frigates scenting a pride of destroyers lurking behind a nearby asteroid, I rerouted hastily and took up a holding position approximately one astronomical unit from the Buy button, hoping that the developers might iron out a few of the wrinkles.

                              <span>Over 2000 hours spent in various factory games makes me a bit of a purist, I suppose. In theory, I should then be the ideal reviewer to enjoy Shapez 2. But I&#x27;m also the ideal reviewer to tear it apart over the most minor hiccups and defects. I&#x27;m the Anton Ego of factory games. I don&#x27;t like food, I love it. If I don&#x27;t love it, I don&#x27;t swallow.
Ah, you needn&#x27;t worry. This is by far the most fun I&#x27;ve had reviewing a game, and Shapez 2 has, in my mind at least, turned the holy trinity of factory games (Factorio, Satisfactory, Dyson Sphere Program) into a holy quartet. Its pared back, everything-is-free-forever approach is quite liberating, and I&#x27;ve never had so much fun placing conveyor belts in my life. But 40 hours into my save file, I&#x27;ve often found myself yearning for a bit more creativity in the challenges, a few more curveballs sent in my direction.

                              <span>It’s an oddly Halloweeny summer week for games, this one. Dragon Age: The Veilguard’s October 31st release date leaked earlier, Steam have put together a Summer Fright Night bundle featuring RPS fave Hauntii, and I’ve got a strange urge to gorge on Haribo and mini Double Deckers until blood comes out of my eyeballs. What a perfect time, then, to dive into the alpha demo for vampire management game Blood Bar Tycoon, especially since Two Point seem to be resting on their laurels a bit too comfortably for my liking.
The idea here is you build a swanky bar serving claret cosmopolitans, ichor-ish coffees and uh, viscera vampiros to your undead clientele. But (with the sorta exception of the crimson-sapped Dracaena cinnabari) blood doesn’t grow on trees, so you’ll also be moonlighting as a human-nabber. You’ll research a slew of “whacky contraptions” to extract their blood, which I greatly enjoy, because “zany exsanguination” is a real winner of a feature. You can’t frivolously phlebotomise with impunity, however - you’ll also want to be on the lookout for vampire hunters aka the fun police.

There was mud everywhere.

But the internet will ever internet, and thanks to some slip-up or other, we have the knowledge just a smidge early. Will I tell you what the actual release date is? Sure. I guess so.

                              <span>Steam’s seeing a good few sweeping changes of late. They’ve recently added a ‘Trending Free’ tab to separate the no money down and no, money down playables. And, as of September, they’re cracking down on links to other websites in store pages. Now, horror of horrors, they’re coming for your ascii gigachads and “nobody is going to read this review so I’ll just say I’m gay” bangers. The changes are part of their ‘New Helpfulness System’, outlined here.
The new system, which will be enabled by default but can be toggled off, aims to “help potential players make informed decisions about the games they are considering purchasing by understanding the attributes of the game that other players like or don&#x27;t like.” Ah, so a sort of ‘review’, if you will. I like it!

The Coded Sword is one of the best you can find, and for good reason. This weapon is fantastic for dealing Holy damage, and luckily, it’s not hard to get your hands on. We’re here to show you where to find the Coded Sword.


Where to find the Coded Sword in Elden Ring

                              <span>Sorcerers are eating well in Season 5 of Diablo 4, utilizing any of the popular builds. One of them is the Fireball build, which requires the Gloves of the Illuminator. So, if you want to get your hands on this pair of gloves (no pun intended), here’s what you need to do.


How to get the Gloves of the Illuminator in Diablo 4


The Gloves of the Illuminator can be obtained either as a very rare world drop or a boss drop from Grigoire or The Beast in the Ice.


If you’re looking to get it as a world drop because you don’t have access to the ladder bosses yet, it’s best to try and play the endgame activities currently in the game. Such activities include Nightmare Dungeons, The Pit, Helltides, PvP, Whisper Caches, and the newly introduced Infernal Hordes. 


Chances are low from world drops,…</span>

                              <span>Earth Defense Force 6 is among the strangest games I’ve ever played. I don’t mean strange in an Earth Defense Force kind of way; I’m no stranger to EDF. To explain how fascinating this game is, I’m going to get deep into spoiler territory. There’s no way around it.


For those of you who would rather not have the game spoiled, here’s a spoiler-free summary of my thoughts: It’s Earth Defense Force 5 if one of its developers woke up from a fever dream with deranged inspiration for how to extend it by nearly 150 missions. Even if you finished EDF 5 a few months ago, you might go into EDF 6 and not see much has changed aside from more dirt, a new narrative, and a couple of other small additions. It is not much of an upgrade, but you couldn’t ask for a better continuation.


But calling EDF 6 a…</span>

                              <span>When you start playing Once Human, one of the first problems you&#x27;ll likely face is figuring out how to repair your rapidly degrading Pickaxe. You can repair your motorcycle, as well as weapons and armor, and you can technically use the Pickaxe as a weapon, but can you repair it?

Unfortunately, you can’t repair the Pickaxe in Once Human. It’s one of the more puzzling things about the tool, besides perhaps the fact that it’s called a Pickaxe when it looks like an axe and can be used both to chop down trees and mine ore. However, don’t despair: As you unlock the different skills in your Cradle, you’ll learn to craft stronger Pickaxes that don’t deteriorate as quickly as your scrubby beginner one.


What can you do with your breaking Pickaxes in Once Human?


Screenshot by Destructoid


Don’t use your Pickaxes until they break! That will cause them to vanish from your inventory, lost forever. Instead, use them right up to the breaking point, then stash them away until you make a trip to town, where you can sell them for a few quick Energy Links. The sturdier Pickaxes are worth more money. 


It’s an odd little inconvenience, being unable to repair Pickaxes even though your base is filled with workbenches. Perhaps developer Starry Studio will decide to make the Pickaxe in Once Human repairable eventually. But for now, they’ve probably got other things higher on their priority list, like preparing for the coming server reset.

That&#x27;s where the rucksack comes in to put your mind at ease with organization, and we&#x27;re here to show you how to craft and use the Bundle in Minecraft.


How to make Bundles in Minecraft


Bundles are a returning item that first appeared in Minecraft back in 2020. They were previously removed because their functionality wasn&#x27;t quite there yet, but now they are back in the Beta and Preview versions.


If you aren&#x27;t familiar with the Bundles, they are essentially little backpacks you can place in your inventory. So, instead of having items overl…</span>

                              <span>Each week in Destiny 2 brings a new Nightfall mission and a weapon to grind the god roll for. This is the go-to for most endgame players as you get access to some very strong Adept weapons sporting some fantastic perks.


One such weapon has a unique god roll thanks to its archetype, and it only comes around ever so often. Here&#x27;s the god roll for the Undercurrent grenade launcher in Destiny 2.


The best perks and attachments for the Undercurrent in Destiny 2

The Undercurrent is part of the Wave Frame archetype of grenade launchers, which means the grenades it shoots send out a wave when they hit the ground. This damages all enemies in a line and makes the weapon great for ad clear. However, this also means the iconic build of running Disorienting Grenades, Auto-Loading Holster, and Vorpal Weapon doesn&#x27;t work. However, the following build does nicely:



Launcher Barrel: Quick Launch


Magazine: High-Velocity Rounds


Perk 1: Demolitionist


Perk 2: Voltshot



Quick Launch lets you get that shot out from the Undercurrent much faster, giving better weapon ready speed and projectile speed for a good combination. High-Velocity Rounds expands on that, giving you an even faster reload and projectile speed for follow-up shots. Demolitionist makes for a great flow between regenerating your grenade charge, throwing it out, and then repeating the process with a reloaded grenade launcher. Finally, there&#x27;s Voltshot, which seriously improves the ad clear potential through jolt.


If running this with a grenade build isn&#x27;t your forte, then Ambitious Assassin is a great alternative perk, provided you can get several kills with one grenade. You could also run Lead from Gold to seriously improve your ammo economy.

                              <span>Paradox Interactive announced today that the new Stellaris: Cosmic Storms expansion for the sci-fi strategy game is set to launch via PC on September 10, 2024. The new expansion brings new technologies and edicts to respond to the new Cosmic Storm threat as well as the all-new Storm Chaser origin and two new precursor stories.




While storm systems already exist in Stellaris, the new Cosmic Storms expansion adds 8 new types of Cosmic Storms that replace the existing Space Storms and randomly spawn across the map. The new Cosmic Storms are Electric, Particle, Gravity, Magnetic, Radiant, Stardust, Shroud, and Nexus. The storms will automatically grow, shrink, and change speeds as they work their way across the galaxy.


Alongside the storms is the new Storm Chaser Origin, an empire of people that seek to push themselves beyond their own limits. As such, they strive for enlightenment by engaging with the new fierce Cosmic Storms that the universe sends at them.


With the new Storm Chaser Origin comes three new civics: Astrometeorology, Storm Devotion, and Environmental Architects. There are also two new precursor stories that discover the stories of the Ancients, vanished masters of the storms: Weather Manipulators and the adAkkaris Convention of Benevolence. Completing each narrative will unlock a new relic.


Stellaris: Cosmic Storms will be released on PC via Steam on September 10, 2024, at the price point of $12.99. It&#x27;s part of the Season 8 Season Pass and will also be added to the monthly Expansion Subscription for Stellaris.

                              <span>The left winger position is a game changer in FC Mobile. These players are basically all about speed, skills, and dribbling. Practically speaking, they are the ones who carry out the team attack by pulling the defenders and generally creating the chance to score.


To help you find the best players, here’s a rundown of the top ten left wingers in FC Mobile that will truly shine in this role, balancing both offense and defense.


Who are the best left wingers in FC Mobile?


1. Kylian Mbappé

At the top is Kylian Mbappé. He is a French player who has 99 OVR with a value of €136 million. His stats are very impressive, even as a left-winger. Also, he practically has greater finishing ability than Nico Williams, who is the second-top player on the list.

                              <span>Destiny 2&#x27;s Salvation&#x27;s Edge raid weapons are all rather unique, if not in function then definitely in appearance. Each one is about as weird as the visuals of the raid itself, not that this makes them any less powerful.


Among them is a new sword that, while not including Eager&#x27;s Edge, has a rather potent DPS combo for certain boss fights: The Summum Bonum.


Here&#x27;s the god roll for the Summum Bonum sword in Destiny 2.


The best perks and attachments for the Summum Bonum in Destiny 2


Image via Destructoid.


The Summum Bonum sword sports the highly sought-after Wave Frame archetype, allowing its heavy attacks to send out a wave in front of you. This gives your sword a little range if you either get pushed back or are still approaching the enemy. The following perks and attachments should pair nicely with it:



Blade: Hungry Edge


Guard: Balanced Guard


Perk 1: Relentless Strikes


Perk 2: Chaos Reshaped



Hungry Edge immediately provides max sword ammo, which is something swords tend to struggle a lot with. Any buff there helps a ton. Balanced Guard gives a much better guard, though you shouldn&#x27;t worry about ittoo much since you won&#x27;t be using it. Relentless Strikes is where things get interesting since it gives back sword ammo on continuous light swings---which you&#x27;ll be doing many of. Finally, we have Chaos Reshaped, increasing damage based on how long you&#x27;re in combat. A great buff for boss DPS.


How to get the Summum Bonum in Destiny 2


The Summum Bonum comes from the new Salvation&#x27;s Edge raid. It can drop from the second encounter (Herald of Finality), the fourth encounter (Verity), or the fifth one (The Witness). On top of this, the object that appears after defeating The Witness lets you spend 20 Spoils of Conquest to get a deepsight version of whatever weapon you want, including the Summum Bonum. Getting five of these grants you the ability to craft it.

These evolved cards possess a special ability that an original card lacks. Plus, they have better stats to make up for the low appearances that can happen in a match.


Every card has an allotted cycle, which is required to unlock the evolution potential. For instance, if a card has two cycles, the third deployment of the same card will be a Card Evolution.

This is a great card especially for beginners as it&#x27;s pretty easy to obtain. There&#x27;s just one task, and it&#x27;s really easy to get the required fodder as well. Let&#x27;s take a look at how good the new card is, and if you should invest your resources in it.

The solo task has certain conditions that you&#x27;ll need to meet while submitting the squad. 


Task 1 - Casey Murphy



Min. Team Rating: 88


Min. 1 Players: Any TOTS or TOTW



EA FC 24 Casey Murphy FUTTIES SBC solutions


The Casey Murphy FUTTIES SBC can be completed for about 40,000 coins. 


Task 1 - Casey Murphy



Mapi Leon: 89


Irene Paredes: 88

Any 88-rated TOTS/TOTW card


Marie Katoto: 88

Joshua Kimmich: 88


Lucy Bronze: 87

Compared to women goalkeepers, Murphy has decent height at 6 ft. However, I am not comfortable using anyone apart from a really tall goalkeeper in my team. It suits well considering the aerial meta of the game at the moment. That said, a 97-rated card can be incredibly useful to complete SBCs like Mia Hamm Icon or David Ginola Heroes. If you have the spare fodder, which you should, make sure to complete this FUTTIES SBC.

                              <span>Skills are the bread and butter of Old School RuneScape. The gameplay loop of Jagex&#x27;s iconic MMO revolves around the dopamine hit of seeing your skills and XP go up. The slow crawl to 99 is excruciating, but there&#x27;s nothing quite like the moment all your hard work pays off. 


We&#x27;ve separated our Old School RuneScape Skills Tier List into two different categories: free-to-play and members. The game&#x27;s paid content is so much more in-depth that it&#x27;s difficult to directly compare the two. That&#x27;s not to say OSRS isn&#x27;t worth trying for free: It&#x27;s still a classic MMORPG, but you&#x27;ll have a lot more fun with the skills as a paying member.

                              <span>The Wholesome Games Steam event is here to announce new games and spotlight current releases, and one of today&#x27;s reveals is Ritual of Raven. This witchy farming sim comes from Spellgarden Games, who previously worked on Sticky Business. It&#x27;s currently due out through publisher Team17 sometime in 2025.


Beyond Steam, Ritual of Raven is eyeing a release on Nintendo Switch. Spellgarden is aiming for maximum coziness with this one, as previewed in the announcement trailer below.




Ritual of Raven describes itself as a farming sim, but you actually collect and enchant Arcana Constructs to work on your magical herb garden for you. While these magical creatures help grow ingredients for rituals, it&#x27;s up to you to embark upon quests, befriend various characters, and get to tradin&#x27;. You&#x27;ll also want to suss out what&#x27;s up with all these portals that have been popping up throughout the land.


If the crux of your coziness lies in customization, it seems there&#x27;s plenty of it to go around here. You can decorate your farm as you see fit, and you can also apply a bunch of customization options to the wider world of magic beyond your farm&#x27;s borders.

So far, it all looks like it&#x27;s eyeing a nice balance between chill sim gameplay and a touch of mystery lurking around the edges. If you want to try it out for yourself and happen to be heading to gamescom, Ritual of Raven will be playable at the event. Look for the demo at the Indie Arena Booth in Hall 10.2 | F010 E019 for all your occult-adjacent cultivating needs.

Publisher The Arcade Crew and developer Assoupi have revealed a brand-new platformer called Mainframes. It&#x27;s a refreshingly unique take on the genre in which you take on the role of Floppy who, in an effort to discover its true function, sets off on a quest of self-identity.
The cool thing with this one is that the levels are essentially built to look like a computer desktop, with the platforms being actual program windows that you can alter at will. You&#x27;ll encounter cute characters on your journey and relax to some lighthearted music tracks that feel perfectly suited to the pixel art world.

Collecting trading cards, especially vintage cards, has gotten considerably dicier — seemingly overnight.
Over the past month, multiple people have come forward to demonstrate how various X-ray technologies can reliably see inside unopened trading card products. The concept of X-raying packs has been rumored for as long as X-rays and trading cards have existed at the same time, yet most believed the idea apocryphal, or at least impractical. Today, you can literally pay someone to do it for you.

Elrentaros Wanderings is a brand-new game from Rune Factory creator Yoshifumi Hashimoto and his studio, Hakama, which takes place across two parallel worlds: one in a present-day Japanese school, and one in a fantasy land where a small village is plagued by monsters that live in nearby dungeons.
Your character — male or female — must be the one to clear out these dungeons, making friends with the locals and upgrading weapons to take on progressively harder dungeons. But sometimes, when you go to sleep at night, you wake up in that parallel universe... and all the characters seem like the ones you just got to know in the village. How strange!

                              <span>Yes, we want one.
There have been some truly gorgeous video game statues in our time, from the likes of the First 4 Figures Samus Gravity Suit statue from Metroid to the ludicrous Ghosts &#x27;n Goblins statue from Dream Figures.
We love one-off designs though; statues that likely won&#x27;t be made available to the general public, but nevertheless showcase a level of originality that simply can&#x27;t be replicated elsewhere. And yes, we&#x27;re a little bit jealous that we can&#x27;t get our hands on them, too.

Amiibo support is seemingly set to make a return in the upcoming release The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, and ahead of the game&#x27;s launch next month, Nintendo is apparently restocking two themed amiibo in the US.
If you weren&#x27;t able to secure the Link&#x27;s Awakening amiibo or Wind Waker style Zelda amiibo, now is your chance to order them in this new wave of stock from retailers like Best Buy, GameStop and Target. They&#x27;ll set you back $15.99 each, with some listings mentioning how they are scheduled to arrive the same day as the new game on 26th September 2024.

With the Ryzen 9000 series the Zen 5 cores have a full 512-bit data-path compared to the &quot;double pumped&quot; 256-bit data path found in the Zen 4 processors as well as the Strix Point SKUs. In this article is an AVX-512 enabled versus disabled comparison for not only the Ryzen 9 9950X but also the prior generation Ryzen 9 7950X and looking too at the CPU power use, thermals, and peak frequency when engaging a variety of AVX-512 workloads.</span>

                              <span>Vroom vroom. That is the sound of 11 rivals revving their engines as they blink the sweat out of their eyes and exhale years of self-doubt from their lungs. Today is their day. We have lined up these racing games on a starting grid and are interested to see how things shake out. Will the realism-obsessed driving sims take the lead with their sublime physics engines? Might the futuristic combat racers simply destroy the opposition with explosive rockets? Or perhaps a nippy arcade crowd-pleaser will soar to the finish line, propelled by the sound of roaring cheers. It&#x27;s all to play for here at our incredibly messed-up grand prix with a worrying lack of rules or regulation. Start your engines, everyone, these are the 11 best racing games on PC. 3! 2! 1! ...

                              <span>The next advance in video game graphics technology is not ray-tracing or tray-racing or any variation thereof - it&#x27;s janky stop motion and rubbish plastic dolls, and it actually began about 30 years ago, when I watched the Adam and Joe show for the first time. If you never watched the Adam and Joe show, they used to do home movie recreations of famous films like Titanic and Saving Private Ryan using stuffed animals and action figures. I found these &quot;Toymovies&quot; hysterical as a kid - I suspect they are less so now. Probably, they are full of jokes we might tentatively class as &quot;of their time&quot;. The point is, Reptilian Rising is sort of Toymovie: The Game.

                              <span>The Crimson Diamond is a proper old-school style puzzle adventure. It&#x27;s 2D pixel art, with a limited colour palette as in EGA games, and you control it with a text parser, like King&#x27;s Quest or one of them other Sierra adventures old men like Graham remember. It&#x27;s important to mention this up front because it&#x27;s very possible that, despite The Crimson Diamond&#x27;s tale of betrayal, murder, and mineral rights in 1914 Canada, the text parser element will be a Rubicon you instantly can&#x27;t be arsed to cross. A not unreasonable stance - though I think the text parser in The Crimson Diamond is fantastic. Such beef that I have with this adventure game is down to the specificity required to solve some of the puzzles.

                              <span>KIBORG: Arena feels like a throwback in several ways that I quite enjoy. It’s a free prologue to the upcoming cyberpunk puncher KIBORG. The titular arena is a large room in which you, a large man, bash a large amount of enemies. You have to punch a gong between waves to trigger the next, and this struck me as a nice pre-emptive nudge that every problem you face in Kiborg can be solved by rapidly moving your fist towards offending objects, which turned out not to be too far off the mark.

                              <span>Satirical space RPG sequel The Outer Worlds 2 was announced back in 2021. Since then, we&#x27;ve heard nary a peep about it, with developers Obsidian focusing on Pillars Of Eternity successor Avowed and their ace survival game Grounded, which left early access in September 2022. According to Obsidian&#x27;s studio head Feargus Urquhart, the project is rubbing along nicely. But it was not ever thus: during the opening years of the Covid pandemic, there was apparently &quot;talk of &#x27;do we stop Outer Worlds 2 and just throw the whole team on Avowed&#x27;.&quot;

                              <span>Valve have made no secret of their plans to make SteamOS – the Linux-based operating system that powers the Steam Deck – available to other games-playing devices, including rival handhelds. After a recent beta update mentioned adding support for the Asus ROG Ally’s inputs, The Verge confirmed with Valve that SteamOS support for non-Steam Deck portables is still very much in the works. The Deck’s long-promised dual booting capability, on the other hand, sounds further down the to-do list.

                              <span>It’s been looking grim for Super Earth recently. I mean, not really. Multiplayer shooty Helldivers 2 is still sitting around 35,000 concurrent players, which is perfectly respectable, if only around 10% of its peak back in April. Still, a clutch of disgruntled ‘divers have recently found a novel way to protest an increasingly unpopular series of nerfs: laying down their guns and letting the bots take the damn planet.
“If Super Earth wanted to remain safe, they would stop nerfing our guns,&quot; reads one comment on the subreddit, in response to a post titled “Let the bots advance. Let the Super Earth burn.” It seems to have picked up some steam inside the actual game, too. As of earlier this week, there’s only around a thousand players actively trying to stop the bots advancing perilously close to the home planet, via Gamesradar.
Whether this is all massively overblown for the sake of a dramatic yarn or not, Arrowhead themselves have taken note of player concerns over nerfs. Yesterday, game director Mikael Eriksson unveiled a plan for the next 60 days, directly addressing player feedback over the controversial ‘Escalation of Freedom’ update.

                              <span>Finding and sharing Free Stuff is one of the time-honoured duties of the video game journalist or SEO-monger. Back when I was OXM&#x27;s online editor, &quot;free Xbox games&quot; was one of our golden Google pillars, the other two being &quot;Minecraft Xbox 360 update&quot; and &quot;Skyrim something something&quot;. Well, uncle Valve has just rudely torpedoed that ancient investigative initiative by adding a Trending Free tab to the Steam frontpage, encompassing prologues, demos, free-to-play games and that most treasured of jewels, a full free game with no monetisation elements, such as Grimhook.
Do not cry for us pitiful electronic scribblers, crowded on our melting internet icebergs. Play free games instead! Thanks to that new tab, I&#x27;ve just discovered a demo for neato wide-format tower defender Frontline Crisis. Hah, that&#x27;ll keep the awareness of steady livelihood erosion at bay.

                              <span>File-hosting service Uptobox was taken offline last year following complaints from entertainment industry giants including Amazon, Disney, and StudioCanal. The platform&#x27;s servers were targeted in a police raid just months after a French court ordered ISPs to block the site. Uptobox tried to reverse this decision, arguing that it&#x27;s not the piracy haven rightsholders make it out to be, but the court denied that challenge.

                              <span>Top tier French football leagues, Ligue 1 McDonald&#x27;s and Ligue 2 BKT, have obtained a new court order to block dozens of pirate IPTV platforms. As presented on the Paris Judicial Court&#x27;s website, the list of domains amounts to a wall of merged text simply asking to be misinterpreted. Fortunately they&#x27;re more easily determined in the downloaded order, but that doesn&#x27;t mean precision blocking won&#x27;t be needed. Perhaps now more than ever, one mistake could go terribly wrong.

                              <span>Aside from being a game where you run around a shopping mall murdering the living dead, the original Dead Rising from 2006 is a clownish satire of sleazy tabloid photojournalism. It expresses this by way of its scoring system, where you earn &quot;Prestige points&quot; for snapping pictures that fit one of five categories: &quot;Brutal&quot; scenes of characters being slain; moments of &quot;Horror&quot;, such as the spectacle of an approaching horde; comical &quot;Outtakes&quot;, like characters caught in bizarre poses; moments of &quot;Drama&quot;, such as people reacting to discoveries; and &quot;Erotic&quot; photos of women alive or undead, which range from snaps of exposed underwear to close-ups of cleavage.
The Erotica tag has, however, been chopped from the Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, in what Capcom gingerly suggest isn&#x27;t &quot;a response to a changing cultural climate&quot;, but expressive of the view that earning points from such photos is not &quot;an appropriate reward for survival and not a skill required of a journalist trying to stay alive&quot;.

                              <span>The Steam Deck’s competitors, whether they’re the old guard Ayaneo family, the luxe Asus ROG Ally X, or the shapeshifting Lenovo Legion Go, usually share the same attack line: they can play more of your games. The Deck’s compatibility issues aren’t nearly as issue-some as they were at launch, but between its Linux-based SteamOS and its relatively mild processing power, but it is true that beefier Windows handhelds will more likely cater to your entire cross-launcher library.
Unless, that is, you get something else to run them for you. Streaming games on the Steam Deck has emerged as a nifty workaround for the portable PC’s lingering compatibility woes, making even officially unsupported games playable. Usually with much better performance, too, as the actual rendering work is done remotely – what you see on the Deck’s screen is basically a video feed of that remote device’s display output, with your control input beamed the other way via a low-latency connection. And because you’re not using SteamOS or the internal hardware to actually run the game, it’s not bound by their limits.

Games like Maelstrom, Ambrosia&#x27;s Macintosh clone of Asteroids, and the proto-shmup Crystal Quest from Patrick Buckland, who would go on to make Carmageddon. Little did I know that the humble premise of a small 2D spacecraft shooting baddies on a wrap-around screen would reach the glittering heights of Nova Drift. Had you shown me this game back in 1995, I dare say I&#x27;d have shmupped myself.

I’m starting to regret giving Burt a gun, honestly. Every time he bumps into a magazine rack he starts screaming like someone’s eating his face, and the little circle above his name turns red to indicate he’s in danger. That’s a mannequin, Burt. They can’t hurt you. They’re actually known for not being able to move.

I’m currently trying to puzzle out what the titular Mother Machine in The Curious Expedition studio Maschinen-Mensch’s upcoming co-op platformer refers to. But, if it’s a reference to forming a parental bond with what the game has saw-me-comingishly named “chaos gremlins”, I&#x27;m way ahead of you.
Ah, the press release speaketh! Probably should have read some more before I began exclaiming “Chaos Gremlins!” over and over. Have an announcement trailer.

                              <span>Among the many, Gigery beauties of 2014&#x27;s Alien: Isolation is that you save using an in-game, wall-mounted Emergency Phone - a maddeningly analog process of slotting a keycard into the machine and waiting for three beeps. Doing this requires you to stand upright in full view, with your back turned upon an entire space station&#x27;s worth of shiny domed technology and guttural industrial noises. Delightful!
Amongst the players harrowed and compelled by this fixture is Fede Álvarez, director of the 2013 Evil Dead remake, 2016&#x27;s Don&#x27;t Breathe and, most recently Alien: Romulus - the seventh and avowedly &quot;back to basics&quot; Alien movie. Isolation is the Alien experience that convinced Álvarez the Alien could still be scary, after decades of milking the creature&#x27;s dugs for spin-off movies and making it share a screen with the Predator, the Pepsi Max to Alien&#x27;s Dom Pérignon 1921. In possibly self-defeating homage to Creative Assembly&#x27;s work, he&#x27;s filled the movie with Emergency Telephones, turning them into a straightforward-sounding form of foreshadowing.

Abiotic Factor is the courageous game that has been correcting this historic oversight. It&#x27;s fun, and the fun just got funnerer. The &quot;Crush Depth&quot; update, released yesterday, adds a heap of new areas to the game&#x27;s messed-up scientific facility, including a dangerous Security Sector and a vast reservoir zone called the Hydroplant. On top of that there are new weapons, tools, workbenches, drivable vehicles, fishing rods, and quite a bit more. It&#x27;s all shown off in the trailer below.

There&#x27;s a BMW (no, not the German multinational manufacturer of vehicles) benchmarking tool out now that lets you preview how the game would run on your hardware.

                              <span>Valve&#x27;s third-person hero shooter Deadlock hasn&#x27;t been officially revealed yet, but thousands of you unscrupulous devils have been playing it thanks to stolen development builds. Speculation abounds that these &quot;leaks&quot;, coupled with Valve&#x27;s obstinate silence about it, are a calculated publisher psyop. Are they deliberately letting people play the game early so as to temper the marketing rollout in some way? Perhaps handle any initial player criticism under cover of non-announcement? It seems unlikely, but as other writers have pointed out, this is Valve, unaccountable elder god of PC gaming. I guess we should be thankful it isn&#x27;t another Half-Life tease.

Well, root my toots. Unless you’re Australian, in which case don&#x27;t do that. Just enjoy the now very much confirmed-looking release of the original Red Dead Redemption on PC. That’s according to a listing on the PlayStation Store, which contains the currently inaccurate but tantalising phrase “now on PC for the first time ever.”

Last week, Russian telecoms operators gave RuTube another boost by massively throttling YouTube. On Friday, RuTube&#x27;s apps were suddenly removed from Apple&#x27;s App Store and Google Play.

The early access game is on our best immersive sims list for a reason, you know, and now it has an autumn release date for the final version, along with a new trailer.

                              <span>Last week, Bethesda released a remastered edition of Doom and Doom II on Steam, with lots of extra episodes and improvements. One of these new features is a built-in browser for mods, and support for many existing mods that previously required a different version of the game. Basically, lots of good fan-made mods are now playable on the Steam version of ye olde Doom. That&#x27;s neat! Ah, but there is some demon excrement on the health pack, so to speak. The mod browser lacks moderation and lets people upload the work of others with their own name pinned as the author. That&#x27;s prompted one level designer to call it &quot;a massive breach of trust and violation of norms the Doom community has done its best to hold to for those 30 years.&quot;

Four joke topics appear at the bottom of the screen. Ridiculous celebrity kids names. Action figures for news anchors. Diet water sales boom. You cautiously slide that last one over to the microphone. Throwbrien emits a string of chirps, like a flame-crested lyre bird with a wounded voicebox trying to mimic human language. “Have you folks heard about this one…”
There is an implied terror in this seemingly friendly opener. What if they have heard this one? What will Throwbrien do then?

The Hi-Fi Rush studio have been acquired - alongside the IP for future games in the rhythm action series - by South Korean company Krafton, who also own PUBG Studios and Striking Distance, among others. “This strategic move will include the rights to Tango Gameworks’ acclaimed IP, Hi-Fi Rush,” Krafton said in a statement today. I particularly enjoy the hand-rubbing, grinning use of the word ‘strategic’ here. Great news though.

The reason the same question still gets asked countless times even today, is simple: the answer, should one even exist, is never true for long, even if we assume it was initially true. So what&#x27;s the harm in asking?

I know it&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve made you aware of this project, but it&#x27;s been going on since I moved to Glasgow.

                              <span>The Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) has repeatedly taken a tough stance on piracy, condemning freeloaders and calling for tough enforcement measures. In a recent earnings call, UFC parent company TKO noted that ESPN price hikes haven&#x27;t made things easier. On the contrary, the company directly links price increases to the &quot;jacked up&quot; piracy numbers.

                              <span>Serie A&#x27;s bid to force Cloudflare to participate in Piracy Shield, Italy&#x27;s pirate IPTV blocking system, has failed. The Italian football league filed a legal complaint in April, claiming that Cloudflare assists and protects pirate services. In a decision handed down this week, the Court of Milan said that it has no legal authority to compel Cloudflare to join the program. The Court also denied Serie A&#x27;s application for an injunction, for reasons that suggest this battle may not be over.

The project in question is Tramstertram. Aside from being a terrifying feat of punmanship, it&#x27;s a browser-based building toy from Matt Stark, creator of the really rather lovely Viewfinder.

The same is apparently true of the multiplayer Control spin-off Project Condor and the Max Payne 1 &amp; 2 remakes, on which Remedy are collaborating with GTA and Max Payne 3 developers Rockstar.

And when I pan to the lighthouse piercing the sunset beyond the security spikes it&#x27;s not out of any feeling of wonder, or even curiosity about possible escape routes. Please understand: I do not see these people, these objects at all, just the boneless, faceless traces they leave upon my own servitude to the lens.

                              <span>The first Splitgate was a cracker mash-up of Halo multiplayer gunfights and Portal&#x27;s nifty spacetime windows. It was a gimmick that made flanking fun again, at least until you died to a distant rifle that was right next to you all along. Its sequel, Splitgate 2 is continuing that gimmick but is also sprucing up the free-to-play arena shooter with a few modern additions, like bum-sliding around corners and big deployable bubbles called &quot;time domes&quot; that slow down your enemies yet speed up your allies. All this and more comes from a gameplay trailer that went up yesterday.

In God Of War Ragnarok, the action kicks off a during the apocalyptic fimbulwinter, which is probably bad for some characters I don’t care about, but it is good for me personally, because there’s a lot of snow to play with.
How much snow, you ask? 190 flippin’ gigs worth, apparently, according to Sony’s system requirements.

                              <span>Yesterday, Nic took James and I on a tour of Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2&#x27;s co-op campaign. A merry old time was had, romping through fortress cities like a small herd of crusader buffalo, using the game&#x27;s absurd jetpack functionality to pancake invading Tyranids, and getting our screens so slathered in gore we couldn&#x27;t work out who was killing what.
It looks like the gargantuan action game&#x27;s PvP multiplayer will be even messier. Saber and Focus Home have released an extended trailer that walks you through two major modes - the PvE boss and wave-slaying frenzy of Operations, and the 12-player PvP carnage of Eternal War, which spans a range of match types. The ecstasy of dying for the Emperor aside, both give me frightful flashbacks to the early days of Gears Of War.

In a new post, its lead developer has laid out what to expect from Early Access. In the main: a polished, 40 hours-or-so experience with no known major issues, and a post-release roadmap waiting to be defined by player feedback.

                              <span>Did The Gentlebros come up with the pun &quot;Pi-Rats&quot; and then work backwards from there in deciding that Cat Quest 3 should be pirate themed? Or was &quot;Purr-ibean&quot; the initiating pun? I feel that the action-RPG sequel had to begin with one of wordplay or another, given that its Steam page boasts that it also has &quot;furr-ocious spells&quot; and &quot;gla-meow-rous costumes&quot;.

It&#x27;s also claws-out now on Steam, which has me feline fine.

The decision to ban all access to the game and platform was taken by the Turkish Information and Communication Technologies Authority (BTK), who also blocked access to Instagram in the country earlier this week.

                              <span>You&#x27;re a long time undead. 7 Days To Die was shuffling along in early access for 11 years, until version 1.0 finally burst through the windows. In that time, many other survival games have sprouted, blossomed, and gently faded away. I first visited the burnt-out ruins of this zombie-infested world a decade ago and I returned to it this week to find a tree-puncher that, despite bearing the pockmarks of early access, retains much of what made it enjoyable back when the survival genre was still wearing its baby onesie. Instead of a review, I figured I&#x27;d scribble together a mini starter guide for new (or returning) players. Partly because the game is a proper time sink and it was taking me so long to get through everything. But mostly because I wanted to use that numberful headline. So, here you go: 7 dos and 7 don&#x27;ts in 7 Days To (7) Die.

                              <span>I was partial to a scrappy little strategy game even before idiot billionaires doomed the planet, and the UK to brain-steaming heat just when you thought we&#x27;d escape it this year. Khaligrad is plenty scrappy. Its edges are rough and you have to figure it out yourself, but it&#x27;s more intuitive than it appears, and easy to operate once you discern some basics. It&#x27;s scrappy too in that it&#x27;s, well. It&#x27;s Stalingrad. Not really: its world is so fictional it&#x27;s their 15th century. But the invaders are explicitly fascists and the defenders communists embroiled in a long and brutal semi-guerrilla city war with World War 2 technology. Thankfully, it&#x27;s stripped of any actual fashy or genocidal play-acting beyond each side doing &quot;hail the empire/union&quot; bits as a sign off.
I think that&#x27;s why, despite its brutal and difficult setting, it&#x27;s this year&#x27;s entry in the long tradition of Low-Intensity Strategy Games For When Hot Why Hot Please Stop You Cannot See My Begging Tears For They Evaporate.

                              <span>WolfEye&#x27;s debut game Weird West attempted to pack a little of Dishonored&#x27;s immersive sim sorcery into a top-down action-RPG. For the studio&#x27;s next game, co-founders Raphaël Colantonio and Julien Roby are leaning into comparisons with their old endeavours at Arkane more earnestly. The new game - currently untitled and without a release date - is a first-person sci-fi RPG set in an alternate-1900s North America, which ostensibly combines the ingenuity and gadgetry of Dishonored and Prey with a &quot;real RPG&quot; experience redolent of Skyrim and modern-day Fallout.

                              <span>Hm. Hmmmm. Right. So, what have we got here? There’s my Blood Donor card, which reduces the value of the hearts I play, but also heals me. That’s fine, actually. Reduced score means I can squeeze in another card for more healing. If I can pull my Tarot card, I&#x27;ll deal damage with each heal, and I’ve already pulled two scratch cards for yet more quick damage. Now, if I can just pull a Jack, I can plonk down the King Of Space And Time for a brutal finisher. That’ll transfer everything on my side over to my opponent’s, forcing a bust for a nice final chunk of hurt and…

                              <span>Spaceship likers, come hither. Long-running space sim Elite Dangerous has just unloaded a new interstellar vessel into its universe, and she&#x27;s a beaut. The new Type-8 Transporter is a medium freighter capable of hauling a maximum of 406 tons of cargo. It&#x27;s got a default jump range of 17.55 light years and two big prongs sticking out of its face like a sci-fi forklift. Cool. The catch is that this ship can only be bought with real money for now, say the developers. This is part of Frontier&#x27;s new strategy of having paid-for ships in the game. I don&#x27;t really play Elite Dangerous anymore, so I don&#x27;t have strong feelings about that. But I do have strong feelings about the space trucker advertisement the developer has put together for the new ship. Come watch it with me.

                              <span>I’d initially assumed that puzzle game Sliding Hero counts was a Sokoban-like, until I realised that it’s actually you, not endless boxes, that do the sliding here. Still, I wasn’t entirely convinced. The only thing that’s fun to slide back-and-forth indefinitely is a lounging cat on a smooth kitchen worktop. Still, after messing around with Sliding Hero’s Steam demo, I think this one might have much longer legs than its restrictive-sounding concept suggests. All the better to endlessly slide with.

Do I let it spin on forever, a gleaming machine of prosperity bathed in an eternal twilight, or do I, as the case may be, unleash a horde of voluptuous hellwomen to gather spirit energy for the resurrection of my tragically slain beloved? If you picked option B you should probably play My Lovely Empress, a plush empire management sim with a dastardly twist, from Indonesian team GameChanger Studio. Find a trailer below.

                              <span>It is I, the wound salter. The injury insult adder. Life By You, the simulation life-em-up from Paradox, was canceled in June after being delayed indefinitely. The day after the cancellation - which Paradox CEO Fredrik Wester implied was down to a “lacking”, unfixable development state - designer Willem Delventhal spoke about his time at the subsequently shuttered Paradox Tectonic. He claimed the team spent a month “in purgatory” prior to being told of the game’s cancelation and studio shuttering two weeks before launch, despite being told by higher-ups that work was “exceeding expectations.”
We’ve now got another look at a game we’ll likely never get, thanks to a thread by Twxbbly user SimMattically collating unseen screenshots from portfolios by several artists who worked on Life By You.

Estimates show that over 1,300 pirate sites offer manga and in a recent single month, 100 new pirate manga sites appeared online. Cost to the industry: $800m per month.

                              <span>When ISPs are instructed to block pirate sites, tampering with their own DNS records is often the weapon of choice. This type of blocking can be circumvented by switching to public DNS offered by companies including Cloudflare and Google. Tests carried on several ISPs in Malaysia this week reveal that requests to Cloudflare and Google public DNS servers are being hijacked and diverted to local ISP DNS servers.

                              <span>The RIAA and several other organizations condemn AI startup Anthropic for allegedly flaunting copyright law. The criticism appears in an amicus brief in support of a court injunction requested by music publishers, who want the AI company to stop using lyrics without permission. According to the RIAA, Anthropic&#x27;s defense relies on the same rhetoric as Napster once did.

By stacking blocks, twisting knobs and clicking chunky buttons, you create your own track - then record it to a cassette tape you can keep.

It now has a release date: August 15th.

Maybe I&#x27;m forgetting some classic arcade racer, but Victory Heat Rally feels less laser targeted and more a modern take on the spirit of the genre. It&#x27;s a 2.5D, &quot;neo super scaler&quot; arcade racer with split screen, drifting, car tuning and a lot of pep.

Other measures are designed to improve voice actor working conditions, and stop companies using their voices and likeness as fuel for generative AI tools without their consent. It&#x27;s both a praiseworthy endeavour and an interesting breakdown of the voice-actor&#x27;s trade.

Now, he&#x27;s back to share a little about the horror game&#x27;s difficult development, offering details of cut materials, a complicated relationship with parent company Krafton, the impact of Covid, and abandoned plans for a sequel.

                              <span>What if the company that sold your cheese also sold your PC gaming hardware? This is not the murmuring of some poor sod on a nineteen-hour Dota 2 binge who’s started thinking that the crumbs in his keyboard resemble a viable snack, but a bold new reality, one I recently found myself staring down during a trip to Asda. The supermarket chain – third biggest in the UK by turnover and purveyors of ill-fitting clothes and surprisingly good doughnuts alike – has added light-up gaming mice, keyboards, and headsets to its mountain of own-brand wares.
Asda being what it is (Americans, if you’re unfamiliar, think Walmart with less gun violence), it’s all dirt cheap as well. £17 for a full-size keyboard. £16 for an FPS mouse. Overwhelmed with curiosity, I ended up taking home a complete starter set (keeb, different mouse, headset, and mousemat) for £45, or about a third of the price of the Logitech G515 Lightspeed TKL that I’d shortly kick off my desk. Could this be a new frontier in affordable PC hardware, bringing tech to the masses in a way no specialist retailer ever could, or should supermarkets stick to cereal and meal deals? Surely the Asda Tech (real name) 4-in-1 Gaming Kit would have the answers.

The blockbuster JRPG isn&#x27;t out on PC yet, and developers Square Enix have not given a concrete release date for it, but this does seem to be prep work for the inevitable. And with Squeenix in attendance at Gamescom, it&#x27;s possible we&#x27;ll know more soon.

                              <span>Back in June, strategy bods Creative Assembly put out a chunky, chatty video discussing the next expansion for Total War: Warhammer 3. Aside from a not-so-subtle hint that the orcs, ogres, and Khorne pack would feature at least one colossal squig, it also ended with a tease at smaller bits of new content coming alongside regular patches. As of the game’s latest hotfix blog, we’ve now got a better idea when we’ll start seeing some of these “smaller bits and pieces.” Bits and pieces? In this economy? Yes, and this month in fact. “Late August” to be precise by quoting a vague statement precisely.

                              <span>Uruguay&#x27;s Ministry of Industry issued a decree in October 2022 which heralded the country&#x27;s first pirate site blocking program. Since then the country has blocked over 300 pirate domains following requests from various broadcasters. Some other figures of interest; in December 2022, there were around 573,000 pay TV subscribers in Uruguay. A year later that figure had fallen to 496,000. Pay TV revenues were less affected than one might expect.

                              <span>In the grim darkness of the far future, there is only War, unless you don&#x27;t have a 64-bit PC with an Intel Core i5-8600K equivalent and at least eight gigs of RAM, in which case you&#x27;ll have to, I don&#x27;t know, live in everlasting peace, or something. I&#x27;m pretty sure not having eight gigs of RAM is heretical, but never fear, you can probably compensate by taking a leaf from the God-Emperor&#x27;s book and arrange for a host of dying psykers to pour their brain energy into your motherboard.

                              <span>As the wait lengthens for Hollow Knight: Silksong, other Soulsy creature features are scurrying to fill the breach. We had Deviator last week - now, it&#x27;s time for a bumper helping of the heebie-jeebies in the shape of Perennial Order. The title makes it sound like an eBay delivery of potted geraniums. The game festering beneath is actually a &quot;plant horror&quot; boss rusher with twin stick melee controls, unlockable &quot;Instinct&quot; abilities and one-hit deaths.
In a gift to headline writers everywhere, the developers, four-person Gardenfiend Games, are calling it &quot;Hollow Knight meets Titan Souls&quot;, and who am I to deny them? It&#x27;s got one of those &quot;painterly&quot; art styles, too, though other words come to mind, such as &quot;rotted&quot; and &quot;unhallowed&quot; and &quot;manky&quot;. It&#x27;s out on 6th September. Find a trailer nested below this paragraph like a venus flytrap poised to clamp around your fingers.

                              <span>Okay, listen. The Roads To Power expansion coming to Crusader Kings III is focusing on the Byzantine Empire. But forget that. Because today developers Paradox revealed the ins and outs of another feature from the DLC that is way more exciting than some fusty old Greeks. It&#x27;s called &quot;landless adventurers&quot; and it&#x27;ll let you play as disgraced dirtbag travelling the world in a sort of medieval gig economy. You&#x27;ll be making camp, gathering followers, taking random jobs from local rulers, and catching infectious diseases as you try to travel safely through war-torn regions. It sounds amazing.

                              <span>I don&#x27;t play much Call Of Duty any more. My feelings about the series have settled back from self-righteous fury over its Pentagon-sponsored war-fellating to a quieter, regretful sense that there have maybe been enough Call Of Duty games now, and that it would be nice if we could fill that infamous late October/early November release slot with, I don&#x27;t know, games about witches instead, or maybe just turn it into a public holiday and spend the week lying on a mattress regarding the ceiling. Still: I&#x27;ve skinned and filleted enough COD in my time to know that Black Ops 6&#x27;s new &quot;omnimovement&quot; system is going to ruffle as many feathers as it smooths. The short version is that it turns you into Max Payne.

                              <span>In his Vampire Survivors review, Matt Cox described the game as something he could play with &quot;one hand in a packet of crisps&quot;. I think about this quite often, actually, as someone whose largely offline friends (or Fortnite/FIFA pals) ask me to recommend them a game that&#x27;s good or interesting. Show them something popular like Elden Ring and, despite its grandeur, it might prove too much in all facets. But Vampire Survivors? It&#x27;s an easy sell: simple, digestible, ridiculous value.
All of this is to say, One BTN Bosses is from the same school of the easy sell. You can fight bosses with one hand in a packet of pickled onion Space Raiders, after all.

                              <span>You’re dead at the start of rhythm-combat  RPG Nocturne, just arrived in some sort of afterlife waiting room after the apparent extinction of humanity. You get your bearings, and you soon meet up with another, only slightly irritating, small child. His name is Kimothy, which sounds like something you’d only say as a joke to annoy friends named Kim, and then only once because it would be stupid to say it again. It’s fine! Leaves flutter, rays of sun cavort through trees, and the music is utterly gorgeous. The game opens on twinkly piano and mournful strings, infused with a good dose of stirring JRPG whimsy, and soon transforms into whatever the genre of music is called that makes you want to immediately go on a massive adventure. Potion-punk. Slime-swing. Limit breakcore etc.

                              <span>Is early adoption a chump’s game? I dunno about that, though between the Asus ROG Ally X and the Steam Deck OLED, those who stayed their hand on their earlier handheld gaming PC counterparts do have a couple of quality second-genners to choose from. Valve’s effort manages to wring multiple performance, design, and battery life improvements out of its new display, while the ROG Ally X makes similar upgrades with a bigger-yet-better take on the original ROG Ally.
The only thing to do, clearly, is make them fight. It’s probably in the Irish Code Duello or something: &quot;Should one portable games box impugn another’s honour by releasing shortly after it, satisfaction must be claimed through a comparison article.&quot; My hands are bound here, folks, though if you yourself have been playing the waiting game on a handheld purchase, perhaps this little head-to-head can help you pick the right one.

                              <span>Cinematic platformer Bionic Bay opens on a scene of a very large egg doing very bad things - easily my third favourite genre of speculative fiction. You awake to a world of tree trunks that twist like viscera and corroded contraptions powered by luminous goop that’s stored in the balls, uh, big glass orbs. A beam of light soon fills your character with newfound vigour, which is a nice moment of triumph in what otherwise feels like a deeply oppressive rust pit, all unsteady platforms and jagged pipes.
It doesn’t take long before you start spotting examples of the reason Bionic Bay went viral earlier this week. Above your head hangs a painstakingly detailed mass of vents and cables, looming lifelike with dust and shadow and history. I stood and stared because I’d seen how the sausage was made, but I like to think I would have lingered longer than usual anyway. It really is just that impressive.

I randomly watched one of Stay/Night&#x27;s many anime spin-offs, Fate Zero, during the pandemic lockdowns. It triggered a short-lived obsession with the Fate series - I even dipped a toe in the long-lived mobile gacha game Fate/Grand Order. As such, I think I&#x27;m the nearest thing RPS has to a Fate &quot;expert&quot;. Join me for a brief and sporadically informed tour of a universe that has Shaped The Culture like few others.

                              <span>What is it with monstrous eating mechanics in games of late? Last week it was carnivorous post-Soviet elevators, now it’s retro fantasy RPGs that devour themselves. In Super Dungeon Muncher, you are a teeny-tiny hero navigating a corridor-shaped map full of fireball traps and crumbling platforms, spinning coins and patrolling critters. That’s the “Super Dungeon” part. The “Muncher” part refers to the corpulent red monster guzzling the whole level in your wake.

For example: it&#x27;s thanks to Resetera member AstralSphere that I know about Alistair Aitcheson&#x27;s Magic Box and BizHawk retro emulation tools, which - amongst other things - allow you to play old Sonic the Hedgehog games in giddy parallel, shuffling between them whenever you collect a ring.

That I have nothing to do with.

                              <span>One of the neat things about Norland&#x27;s fantasy medievalism is that specialist knowledge is tied to characters. So if there&#x27;s only one person in your village who knows how to brew tastier beer, and they die after being freakishly savaged by a passing wolf (it happens), suddenly your village will have no artisanal lager master. The results may be devastating. Luckily, you can share knowledge in a number of ways - by copying books, or having &quot;wise conversations&quot;. The exception to this is child characters, whose pea-sized brains can&#x27;t learn specialist knowledge, only soaking up basic attributes like &quot;manners&quot; from the teachers you assign to them. Well, until now. The developers for the Rimworld-meets-Crusader Kings catastrophe simulator have made kids a little smarter. They&#x27;ll now learn more important things from their adult teachers.

It seems just yesterday I was getting very jealous at Matthew Castle (RPS in peace) for getting to preview the sequel to my beloved Shadows Of Amn. Fast forward several turns, Larian’s RPG banger is officially one year old since release, and there’s now a much higher chance that strangers at pubs will understand why my failed romance with Jaheira as a youth was such a deeply heartbreaking experience. Baldur’s Gate 3 itself looks to be done and dusted following the upcoming patch, but Larian now seem to be gearing up for their next charm offensive with a new “community focused” YouTube channel, as well as further teasing their two games currently in development.

With my last remaining un-fugged brain cells, I have wrenched this column back from its hiatus, and who better than to get us into the swing of things once more than Baldur’s Gate 3 lead writer and bloody RPS legend Adam Smith! Cheers Adam! Mind if we have a nose at your bookshelf?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve never learned to drive, but every so often a well-meaning friend tells me I&#x27;d be good at it, because &#x27;look, Edwin, you play all those driving games, surely they&#x27;ve taught you the basics&#x27;. Friend, here is what driving games have taught me: traffic lights are there for regional flavour; drifting is the same thing as cornering; other cars exist to serve as bumper cushions when overshooting a turn. Certainly, nobody wants a guy whose ideas about automobiles come from 2018&#x27;s Wreckfest to be involved in the school run. On which note: THQ Nordic have just announced Wreckfest 2 - a fresh helping of destruction derby with fancified visuals and newly animate drivers who flinch and gesticulate when other drivers smash into them. Witness the carnage in the announcement trailer below.

                              <span>It&#x27;s a hell of a thing to showcase a remake weeks after kiboshing the developers of the original game. In early July, Gothic creators Piranha Bytes were reportedly shuttered as part of Embracer Group&#x27;s mad race to trim costs, following their decade-long acquisition binge. Watching THQ Nordic&#x27;s new Gothic Remake trailer, below, feels a little like watching a vivisectionist parade about in somebody else&#x27;s skin. Still, the remake&#x27;s developers Alkimia Interactive aren&#x27;t to blame for Embracer&#x27;s fuck-ups, and I am selfishly happy to see Gothic return as an Unreal Engine 5 production - even if I didn&#x27;t play the original back in 2001.


Sin did play the original game, and in her 2016 retrospective, she paints an absorbing picture of a dark fantasy &quot;microsociety&quot; in which every community &quot;has a reason to exist, a means of providing for itself, a social order, and a long term goal&quot;. It&#x27;s a setup that reminds me of my beloved Roadwarden, even as the sight of grumpy lizards slinking through undergrowth has me silently mouthing &quot;fus roh dah&quot;.

                              <span>Titan Quest 2! Now there&#x27;s a name you can set your watch by. No colons, no bespoke jargon, no tortuous subtitles like &quot;Gaia&#x27;s B.O.U.N.T.Y.&quot; or &quot;Hyperion&#x27;s Wild Rumpus&quot; - just the steadying prospect of a titanic quest that, who knows, may involve actual titans. The action-RPG beneath the moniker appears similarly straightforward: it&#x27;s about following a plot thread through a mythological world in top-down view, smashing Ancient Greek giga-crabs and the like to obtain shinier, pointier varieties of gear. I&#x27;m sure I don&#x27;t need to tell you that there&#x27;s an endgame in which you farm monsters for crafting materials.


Like Pandora opening her box, but without the accompanying tidal wave of sickness, curses and death, THQ Nordic have released a new trailer that talks you though all of this in detail. Here it is...
