                              <span>Don&#x27;t panic, but the floor *is* lava
It&#x27;s a great feeling to be the good-news bearer when one of your favorite co-op games gets new content and you get to excitedly tell your partner all about it. For those of us who like the puzzle-platformer antics of Human: Fall Flat, there&#x27;s a new level, Tower, out now on Steam. Including the original and post-launch stages, it&#x27;s the 21st level.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;BkzAQCA4r1o
The name speaks for itself. With such a precarious layout, I&#x27;m afraid of my pudgy boy plummeting to his doom, but at least Human: Fall Flat is generous with checkpoints.
&quot;Dreamed up by creative mastermind Fennecai and brought to life by the fiendishly talented David,&quot; Tower is the winner of the game&#x27;s 5th Anniversary level design competition. And right on cue, Curve Games says there is &quot;still more to come.&quot;
As usual, console players have to wait
Unfortunately, the console versions aren&#x27;t in sync with the Steam edition, so PS4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch players will have to wait to play the Tower level in Human: Fall Flat. That said, if it&#x27;s been a while, you might have new-to-you levels ready to go.
I recently checked back in and found a couple of levels — Red Rock and Lumber — in our backlog. We blasted through them. Even with overlapping ideas, I&#x27;m still having fun.
With 30 million copies sold and more content updates lined up, I&#x27;m wondering when, if ever, we&#x27;ll see a sequel. I&#x27;m pretty happy with the split-screen performance on a PS5, but it would be nice to see an overhauled sequel that feels more refined. Just a bit.
For now, they&#x27;re squeezing every last drop — and I&#x27;m okay with it.

                              <span>The slimy indie hit returns
Lots of great indie games have been getting a lot of love this year — Stray was Annapurna&#x27;s biggest launch by far, and Cult of the Lamb had over a million players in a week. Now it looks like Slime Rancher 2 is joining those ranks, because it has reached a big milestone of over 100,000 copies within the first six hours of its release. Nick Popovich, co-founder and CEO of the studio behind the Slime Rancher series Monomi Park, shared a tweet yesterday thanking fans for making the game a success.
For those who may not be familiar, the first Slime Rancher game came out back in 2017 after about a year of being in early access. In the game, players take on the role of a farmer tasked with collecting and breeding different types of slimes on their very own ranch, all wrapped up in an open-world FPS-style packaging. Critical reception to Slime Rancher was favorable, but over the years it garnered something of a cult following, and got PlayStation and Switch releases years after its initial launch for PC and Xbox.

Anecdotally, I&#x27;ve seen love for the Slime Rancher series spread through word of mouth more than anything — it&#x27;s another one of those cozy farming-style games that players just can&#x27;t seem to get enough of. It&#x27;s exciting to see the devs put out a sequel to the beloved indie game that has been met with nearly universal praise, because maintaining that momentum can be difficult.
100,000 may seem like a relatively small number compared to some huge launches that can be in the millions, but for an indie studio, that can be life-changing. Here&#x27;s hoping we continue to see more great things from Monomi Park, because they&#x27;ve managed to tap into a certain kind of magic that we don&#x27;t see very often.

                              <span>Hey, it&#x27;s a lot less confusing than the Zelda timeline(s)
Shovel Knight Dig is out this weekend, and right on time, Yacht Club Games has swooped in to give a bit of context to this spinoff. Well, prequel, actually!
Speaking to Nintendo Life, Yacht Club Games Marketing Manager Celia Schilling confirmed that Dig does indeed take place before the events of every game/DLC:
&quot;Story wise, Shovel Knight Dig is the first game in the Shovel Knight series. That makes it a prequel that takes place even before Specter of Torment! You might remember the intro line from the first Shovel Knight game - &#x27;Long ago, the lands were untamed, and roamed by legendary adventurers.&#x27; Well, Dig takes you back to these good ‘ol days, when Shovel Knight and Shield Knight quested together, fighting baddies and seeking treasure! We hope fans will be interested to play the events leading up to the original saga.&quot;


Technically, it goes Shovel Knight Dig, then the Specter of Torment flashbacks, then King of Cards, then Specter of Torment, Shovel Knight Showdown, Plague of Shadows, Shovel of Hope (the core original release), then Pocket Dungeon is officially a sequel, and the last game in the series at present.
Schilling even goes into detail about the Hexcavators (the new crew/bad guy rogue&#x27;s gallery group), and why its leader (Drill Knight) wouldn&#x27;t want to join the Order of No Quarter: he&#x27;d see it as a downgrade. Also at this time, Specter Knight is still in his non-Order form of Donovan, and other characters are off doing other things before they meet up for the events of Shovel of Hope.
It&#x27;s great to see that after eight years and counting, Yacht Club cares enough about this series to dive into the minutiae of character-specific lore. It&#x27;s a big reason why I enjoyed Shovel Knight Dig so much, as that Hades approach to slowly uncovering more about the game world was so obviously present.

                              <span>The upgraded top-selling games list paints &quot;a more complete picture&quot; of what&#x27;s hot on Steam
I&#x27;m not here to convince you that charts are exciting, but as someone who routinely keeps tabs on the games that are resonating with Steam&#x27;s massive audience, I was eager to check out the new Steam Charts hub. At a glance, it might seem like more of a presentation upgrade than anything, but there are some under-the-hood changes.
That said, it&#x27;s nice to be able to easily bounce between &quot;live charts&quot; for the top-sellers (by revenue), most-played games (including concurrent player counts and daily peaks), and prior weekly charts. Steam now includes how many weeks a game has been in the Top 100, as well as its rising — or falling — position compared to the previous week. Neat!

                              <span>A Sam Fisher for the times
A new job listing on Ubisoft&#x27;s career page indicates the Splinter Cell remake will be modifying the story of the original. Specifically, they&#x27;re taking a look at updating it for a &quot;modern day&quot; audience.
As spotted by PSU, a scriptwriter opening for the Splinter Cell remake is open on Ubisoft&#x27;s site. Alongside working on the Snowdrop engine to rebuild a stealth classic, it looks like the writing staff will also be retooling the narrative.
Here&#x27;s an excerpt from the listing:
&quot;Using the first Splinter Cell game as our foundation we are rewriting and updating the story for a modern-day audience. We want to keep the spirit and themes of the original game while exploring our characters and the world to make them more authentic and believable. As a Scriptwriter at Ubisoft Toronto, you will join the Narrative team and help create a cohesive and compelling narrative experience for a new audience of Splinter Cell fans.&quot;

It&#x27;s unclear what that entails, outside of possibly incorporating modern ideas into the spy story. Maybe Sam will have to quietly distribute food deliveries along his intended route. Or perhaps he&#x27;ll get distracted during a pivotal moment when one of his tweets goes viral. We do live in really weird times.
The return of Splinter Cell
The Splinter Cell remake got confirmed at the end of 2021. Ubisoft Toronto is heading up development on the remake, using the same Snowdrop engine powering Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora.
The team&#x27;s been pretty quiet since though, outside of confirming a few things. The new-old Splinter Cell will remain linear and not open-world, so in some ways it definitely sounds like they&#x27;re adhering to the original.
Still, a &quot;modern&quot; story for Sam has me, at the very least, curious. Hopefully we learn some more about the Splinter Cell remake soon.

                              <span>Including the t-shirt that Miyamoto wore in the Direct
Although Pikmin 4 isn&#x27;t actually out until sometime next year, Nintendo is getting ahead of the curve with, you guessed it, merch. A new wave of Pikmin 4 My Nintendo goodies are out, including stuff you can buy directly from the store, and a few small digital rewards.
As far as merch goes there&#x27;s two versions of the Pikmin logo t-shirt that Miyamoto wore in the Direct, as well as plush toys for Chappie [also called Bulborb or Chappy] (the big creatures that you typically murder in the series), Olimar, and yellow/blue/red Pikmin.  The decorative drinkware decals from 2020 for 400 Platinum Points are also back in stock. My Nintendo rewards include a printable pop-up card for 30 Platinum, and a wallpaper (landscape and portrait) for 50 Platinum.
Recent My Nintendo rewards (that are still in stock, outside of the last bullet) include:
A Splatoon 3 shopping bag (800 Platinum)
A Splatoon 3 sticker set (400 Platinum)
A Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes memo pad (600 Platinum)
An upcoming Kirby keychain
As a reminder, if you want physical rewards, you can find our full Platinum Point guide here, which has been updated with details on weekly missions: bookmark it for when you need quick points for a reward. A handful of points is incredibly easy to get, as that’s basically just 15 minutes with Super Mario Run, or a quick sign-on to the 3DS or Wii U 3Shop. Also remember that any shipments are bundled together, so you can pay a flat rate for multiple items instead of paying it each time. Just know that items go out of stock on My Nintendo frequently, and some are never restocked.

                              <span>The pop princess returns
Electronic diva Hatsune Miku certainly gets around. The latest diversion for the turquoise-haired Volcaloid icon sees her bouncing around with the silly, madcap world of Mediatonic&#x27;s multiplayer title, Fall Guys, with a limited-time event.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;PuVQumBjtyk
As part of the new in-game event for Hatsune Miku &quot;The Sound of the Future,&quot; players will be tasked with bagging glowsticks and spring onions as they battle their way through Fall Guys&#x27; typical 1 vs. 100 battle royale action. Players can earn themselves Miku-themed nameplates, as well as new Miku-based fan gear for their Beans, by completing challenges.
Season pass holders who battle all the way to level 100 will earn the grand prize, a super cute bean skin of the holo-singer herself, complete with her iconic uniform and long pigtails. It&#x27;s a cool skin, perhaps one of the best in Fall Guys to date, but it&#x27;s going to take a lot of rough &#x27;n&#x27; tumblin&#x27; before you can take to the stage as Hatsune Miku herself. The Sound of the Future event is now live, and runs through October 3, so get cracking.
Fall Guys is available now as a free-to-play game on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.

A new World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King Classic trailer is out on Blizzard&#x27;s YouTube channel, and it comes from an unlikely source: a fan and content creator.
Fresh off of their unofficial Black Temple trailer in 2020, Blizzard decided to give Hurricane a shot for an official trailer spot. It showcases the encroaching threat of the army of the dead nicely, while showcasing a ton of in-game Wrath of the Lich King expansion locations that are fitting for an after-the-fact re-release trailer. A lot of key players are present to give the trailer that official feel, and frankly the war itself looks more urgent than it does in the actual game. Lich King players (the millions out there) will likely enjoy seeing some of the nostalgic locations, too.
And it seems like it took a lot of work! For their previous video, here&#x27;s how Hurricane did it: &quot;The trailer took 10 months to make and it&#x27;s been made entirely in Cinema 4D (meaning no in-game footage has been used). Its development has been made possible due to the extensive use of the Marlamin&#x27;s Export Tools and Jeromnimo&#x27;s WoW Model Viewer).
The actual World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King Classic expansion is out on September 26, at 3:00PM PT exactly (which sets the pace for the worldwide launch).

                              <span>It&#x27;s out &quot;this fall&quot;
A Disney Dreamlight Valley Toy Story update is on the way, and now we have a full-length trailer to see what that actually entails.
Like most character-based things in Dreamlight, it&#x27;ll feature new quests (with Woody and Buzz), as well as an additional space to roam around in, and new items. Based on the trailer you&#x27;ll enter the new space similar to the other lands in the game (like Moana): through a special door in the castle. This time, the Toy Story realm is symbolized by a drawing of an alien head.
Disney Dreamlight Valley kind of snuck up on me. The Early Access release model + the monetization scheme + Gameloft being involved kept me wary, but after a few positive hands-on impressions, I decided to give it a shot. It&#x27;s not bad! There is some free-to-play nonsense baked in, but there&#x27;s a lot you can do, especially upfront, in the current build. It&#x27;s a different take on the farming/simulation genre in many ways, as it&#x27;s heavily tied to quests and key characters, which makes sense for an IP factory like Disney.
In any case, there&#x27;s time to shore up some gameplay-related concerns before it launches next year, but I&#x27;m not hopeful about the monetization element — especially post-launch.

                              <span>Over on the game&#x27;s Japanese Twitter account
Fire Emblem Engage was announced roughly a week ago, and it&#x27;s coming out in January. Naturally, a lot of what the game has to offer is a mystery, but we do know that it features a new polarizing protagonist design, and will allow players to summon classic characters from the series. It really feels like a lot of the gaps are filled in already. We know the full release date (January 20, 2023) and that it&#x27;ll be roughly 15GB in size. We also have a bit more to go off of than the initial trailer reveal thanks to some Fire Emblem Engage gameplay strewn about the Japanese Fire Emblem Twitter account.
All sorts of things can be discerned from this footage, including movement ranges (which will likely carry over to the final build, given that it&#x27;s out in a few short months), animations, map design, class nuance, sound effect quality, and Japanese vocals. Plus, we even get a look at some downtime and character dialogue! This latest batch includes a young-ish character voiced by Kohei Amazaki, described as a guardian who assists the divine dragon. We got a look at another guardian, voiced by Yoji Ueda, last week.
It&#x27;ll be hard to top the tri-story nature of Three Houses for many fans (though I know there are people who will be happy to get back to basics), but I&#x27;m hopeful for Fire Emblem Engage. There&#x27;s bits and pieces I dig so far, namely the idea of mining nostalgia; I just hope it&#x27;s done well from a gameplay perspective.

https://twitter.com/NY_Comic_Con/status/1572979063656005632?s&#x3D;20&amp;t&#x3D;FJcw9pEAcjZ34Qi8a6o7_A
The teaser trailer will make its grand debut during October&#x27;s New York Comic Con event, which is a regular stomping ground for previews of upcoming films and TV shows. The trailer will be made available online, October 6, at 13:00 PT / 16:00 ET / 21:00 BST, and will give us all our very first look at the new movie in action.
While nothing has been revealed in regards to the movie&#x27;s narrative or visual style, we do, of course, know that the famous pipe-plunging hero will be portrayed by Chris Pratt, star of the great Guardians of the Galaxy and terrible Jurassic World movies. Joining Pratt in the Mushroom Kingdom will be Anna Taylor-Joy as Princess Daisy, Jack Black as Bowser, Charlie Day as Luigi and... sigh... Seth Rogan as Donkey Kong.
Look, we&#x27;ll see soon enough, ok? And, either way, we&#x27;ll always have the Bob Hoskins flick... Oh wait, that was pretty dreadful. Well, the Sonic movies are kinda fun.

                              <span>&quot;Let us have competition&quot;
Microsoft&#x27;s purchase of Activision Blizzard is still under scrutiny. But in a new interview with Bloomberg, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella expresses confidence in the Activision Blizzard deal getting approved.
The UK Competition and Markets Authority is investigating the deal. After an initial phase, the regulator has opted to conduct a more in-depth &quot;phase 2&quot; investigation. The CMA is looking into whether the deal will have a realistic prospect of substantially lessening competition in gaming.
Speaking to Bloomberg, Microsoft CEO Nadella says he&#x27;s confident the company will gain regulatory approval for the $69 billion acquisition.
&quot;Of course, any acquisition of this size will go through scrutiny, but we feel very, very confident that we&#x27;ll come out,&quot; said Nadella.
The CEO also points to Sony, which has made a number of acquisitions itself. &quot;So if this is about competition, let us have competition,&quot; Nadella says.

Major mergers
Tensions have been rising around the Microsoft and Activision Blizzard deal. The potential merger has been under scrutiny since it was announced earlier this year, but recently, both Xbox and PlayStation have been addressing it a bit more candidly.
Reports circled that Microsoft had committed to keeping Call of Duty on PlayStation for &quot;several more years&quot; beyond the existing deal. In a statement to GamesIndustry.biz, PlayStation CEO Jim Ryan said the offer was &quot;inadequate on many levels&quot;.
Sony has indeed been picking up several studios. The PlayStation manufacturer has brought on Returnal developer Housemarque, Demon&#x27;s Souls remake creator Bluepoint, and Destiny studio Bungie to name a few.
The size and scope of the ABK deal for Microsoft is massive, though. The latter expects the deal to close in fiscal year 2023.

Dunkey has been a part of the YouTube gaming scene for over a decade as a gaming channel (and in the past few years, a comedy/commentary channel), and has amassed a pretty massive following with over seven million subscribers on the platform. After he released a video this week announcing that he&#x27;s starting his own indie game publisher known as Bigmode, fans and developers alike have plenty to say about videogamedunkey&#x27;s new career move.
In his video, Dunkey expresses the sentiment that over the years, he has tried to &quot;slam dunk soulless cash grabs into the garbage can and lift up and praise the truly inspired works of art in this medium,&quot; and then goes on to list titles he has featured in his videos like Enter the Gungeon,…</span>

                              <span>TNTVillage was once the most popular torrent site in Italy. It had an ethics policy that prevented newly released content from being shared but that stood for nothing when the owner&#x27;s home was raided in 2018. Despite the site closing down in 2019, legal action continued for another three years as copyright holders attempted to take down a solitary remaining hyperlink.

                              <span>Standing here, I realize that this Super Replay will be a cut above the rest because we’ll be slicing and dicing in Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance! Join us today on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central to enjoy two hours of what will be a full playthrough of the cult favorite action game streaming weekly each Friday. 
Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance serves as a sequel/spin-off to Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots that puts cyborg ninja Raiden at the helm. Instead of sneaking around in boxes, players eviscerate foes in fast-paced, stylish action courtesy of developer Platinum Games. Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look. Will I acquire a new appreciation for the game nine years later? How many watermelons will I slice? You’ll have to tune in to find out. 
Watch on Twitch!
Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Blake Hester as we revisit Raiden’s beloved solo adventure. If you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes. You’ll also be granted entry to the official Game Informer Discord channel, where our welcoming community members, moderators, and staff gather to talk games, entertainment, food, and organize hangouts!</span>

                              <span>Nintendo is squids in.
It happened almost overnight. One day in May 2015, Splatoon merch appeared everywhere in Japan.
Baby inklings dangled from kids’ backpacks. Squid-girl stickers adorned pencil cases. Convenience stores advertised raffles for figurines, coffee cups, and Splatoon-branded bags. This explosion of Splat-swag was perhaps more of a surprise given that the Wii U sold only 3.3 million units in Japan. Lifetime worldwide sales of Nintendo EAD&#x27;s first ink-based team shooter would come to rest at 4.95 million units, a very respectable figure — especially for brand-new IP — but hardly an indicator of the utter phenomenon the franchise would become in Nintendo&#x27;s homeland.

Splatoon 3 is a game where victory tastes extra sweet, especially when you can take on players online, and it hasn&#x27;t taken players very long to discover exploits within the game. And in Japan, some players are being called &quot;cheaters&quot; for abusing the &#x27;Tenta Missiles&#x27; special weapon.
Siliconera has reported on this issue which has been making the rounds on Twitter, where Japanese players are expressing their frustration at this exploit. The exploit itself has been around since the game&#x27;s launch, but there seems to be a specific strategy to getting the best out of this trick.

It&#x27;s nearly the weekend, but — more importantly — the next Splatoon 3 Splatfest is almost here! Revealed during the September 2022 Nintendo Direct, Deep Cut announced that we would all need to answer that crucial life question: &quot;What would you bring to a deserted island?&quot;
It&#x27;s a hard one, especially given the options! But the three-team Splatfests opens up the opportunity for the biggest question in life, and even more difficult decisions, so we understand. The choices this time are for Team Gear, Team Grub, and Team Fun. We could honestly make a case for any of them — we need ways to simply get by on the island, easy food would make life much easier, but we also need fun in our lives — especially on a deserted island.

                              <span>Let&#x27;s start at the very beginning.
Since the initial launch of Shovel Knight back in 2014, Yacht Club Games&#x27; 2D adventure title has since blossomed into a bonafide franchise thanks to the inclusion of spin-off titles Shovel Knight Pocket Dungeon and Shovel Knight Dig. The latter is the latest release from the franchise and is available now on the Switch eShop; be sure to check out our full review for all our thoughts on the roguelite platformer.

REVIEW Shovel Knight Dig - A Finely Formed Roguelite That Strikes 16-Bit Gold

Of course, in addition to the three downloadable story campaigns for Shovel Knight, the introduction of Shovel Knight Dig means that the overall narrative and lore for the franchise has also expanded significantly. It begs the question: when does Shovel Knight Dig take place, and what is the full Shovel Knight timeline?

Receiving a Steam release earlier this year (to positive reviews) followed by a Japanese Switch release back in July, publisher Regista has announced that the sci-fi shoot &#x27;em up Moon Dancer will be flying in for Western consoles on September 29th.
After having a blast with Radiant Silvergun earlier this week, our little shmup bellies were full of fly-ey shooter-y goodness. But just as there is always room for dessert, there is always room for more shoot &#x27;em ups.

The Mortal Kombat logo is arguably one of the most recognisable in all of gaming: the silouetted dragon swooping around to resemble the Yin and Yang symbol is stunning in its sheer simplicity.
It almost wasn&#x27;t to be, however, if co-creator John Tobias had listened to a comment from his sister, who mistakenly thought that the original sketch of the dragon was actually a seahorse (thanks, IGN).

In 1990, Ron Gilbert created the seminal point-and-click adventure The Secret of Monkey Island. It grabbed hearts and hasn’t let go for 32 years. In 1991, he concluded Monkey Island 2: LeChuck’s Revenge on a bombshell cliffhanger. In 1992, he departed Lucasarts, and the secret third part of his trilogy went down in legend like a sunken ship. Fan communities theorised and fantasised for a couple of decades about where the story might have been going, desperate for confirmation from Gilbert or his colleagues.
In 2013, Gilbert wrote, “I always envisioned the game as a trilogy” – one he could only make with “complete control over what  was making and the only way to do that is to own it.” In 2015 he wrote, “Monkey Island is now owned by Disney and they haven&#x27;t shown any desire to sell me the IP.” The fans’ final gasp of what if? was snuffed. He bemoaned April Fools’ day annually on his blog, staying proudly “Fools’ day free” for 18 years. He once tweeted, “If I ever get to make another Monkey Island, I’m going to announce it on April 1st”.

We&#x27;ve previously been given a deep dive into monster recruitment and how these factor into your treasure-hunting endeavors, while an earlier update shed some more light on the game&#x27;s primary protagonists, Erik and Mia.

We all expected Splatoon 3 to be a huge hit in Japan, but the third mollusc shooter has taken the entire world by storm since its release two weeks ago. It&#x27;s even made an impact in countries where it hasn&#x27;t been released! One such case is in China — as highlighted by Niko Partners Senior Analyst Daniel Ahmad — where 46% of streamers across several Chinese streaming services streamed Splatoon 3 since its 9th September launch.
This data has been taken from Niko Partners&#x27; China Games Streaming Tracker, and it shows that not only are 46% of streamers broadcasting their ink-tastic gameplay, but 72% of tips on the three services listed (DouYu, Huya, and Bilibili) have also gone to Splatoon 3 streams.

September 2022&#x27;s Nintendo Direct opened with the official reveal of Fire Emblem Engage, a brand new Fire Emblem game, which is releasing next January. And, in the days since, the official Japanese Fire Emblem Twitter account has been sharing clips of some of your future squad members in combat — and it looks pretty darn beautiful.
First up is the main protagonist, who the internet has dubbed &#x27;Colgate-chan&#x27;. They&#x27;re actually called Alear — not quite as catchy, is it? — and they&#x27;re a Divine Dragon. This short snippet shows our red and blue-haired hero inflicting a critical hit on his opponent, and from the animation to the beautiful colours, we&#x27;re impressed.

We&#x27;ve heard before about the Shovel Knight developer Yacht Club Games working on a &quot;new 3D project&quot; and now it seems to have come up again during an interview Ars Technica. Yacht Club&#x27;s game designer Alec Faulkner has revealed how the Mina the Hollower engine is also powering a new &quot;unannounced 3D game&quot;:

&quot;This engine is actually brand new, made from scratch by our team. That’s been our secret for the past five or six years—it’s being used to develop both this game and concurrently our unannounced 3D game.”

                              <span>Everyone&#x27;s talking about Trombone Champ. Not since Untitled Goose Game have I heard this much excited chat about a game from pals who don&#x27;t usually talk about games.

As I play Trombone Champ myself, I come to really appreciate that. It&#x27;s a rare rhythm game where playing badly doesn&#x27;t frustrate or berate me, because the worst-case scenario is making fart noises, and fart noises are funny.

                              <span>Steam now has a fancy charts section that shows the top selling and most played games in real time. If you want a broader picture of what’s trending on Valve’s storefront then you can check out the new weekly rankings of top sellers, along with the top new releases each month. It’s a useful way of seeing what’s trending across the platform if you’re really into that kind of thing.

If you signed up to the alpha anytime in the past few months since the game was announced then you might want to keep an eye on your emails for an invite. The FPS is currently only playable on PC, but the Hyenas team have said that’s set to change in the near future.

Ubisoft Toronto are looking for a scriptwriter for the new Splinter Cell, which they say uses the original as a “foundation” and aims at a “new audience of Splinter Cell fans”. I hate to break it to you Ubisoft, but I’m not certain that the kids dig Tom Clancy military espionage hijinks.

My money’s on Rick And Morty’s Rick Sanchez, but Stripe from Gremlins and the DC Universe’s Black Adam are still set to arrive too. You’ll have to wait until 6pm BST/7pm CEST/10am PST to find out who the next fighter is, according to a tweet from the MultiVersus team.

Kindly, they&#x27;re going to check in across the day, texting us all with updates on what they&#x27;re seeing, doing, and (I imagine) eating. And Ollie might join in from home with cat photos.

This morning, the official Ubisoft Support Twitter account seemingly confirmed a Ubisoft Connect requirement for Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope. It was met with immediate dismay from fans, on the very day the game had gone gold. After the tweet was swiftly deleted we reached out to Ubisoft for comment — but that same account later cleared things up.
The new tweet states rather succinctly: &quot;A Ubisoft Connect account isn&#x27;t mandatory for players to play Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope, contrary to what has been wrongfully mentioned by one of our previous tweets.&quot; It seems to be a definitive statement on the matter, as a direct follow-up and acknowledgment of the prior error. In any case, with Nintendo heavily involved, it would be a bad look if a single-player adventure game required a third-party sign-on.
Ubisoft has been pushing Connect wherever it can, and is still operating the Ubisoft Connect launcher (formerly uPlay) and storefront. Conversely, several studios have closed down or otherwise downplayed their launchers, in favor of migrating to more prevalent platforms. It&#x27;s one thing to have it strewn about an Assassin&#x27;s Creed game for bits and bob bonus points, but it&#x27;s not going to get quite that same pass with Sparks of Hope.
The mere mention of a login requirement really brought me back to the 2010s, and the battle of the launchers, though: when you had the added baggage of extra logins, but none of the bonuses like cross-play. It was a dark time.

                              <span>I buckle a mean swash
If you were a friend of mine around the launch of the Special Edition of Secret of Monkey Island, I probably tried to thrust it upon you. I was in the midst of exploring the point-and-click adventure genre, as I had passed it by when I was young, and Secret of Monkey Island was the new high point. Maniac Mansion is a wonderfully well-designed puzzle box, but Secret of Monkey Island is a symphony. Its puzzle design is near perfect, and its humorous script makes it extraordinarily rewarding to solve them.
Monkey Island 2 might be better than that, but following those two hits, the series took a dive. Curse of Monkey Island, Escape from Monkey Island, and Tales of Monkey Island are all fine. Okay even. But the first two games weren’t fine, they were magic.

                              <span>You&#x27;ll be able to build homes from scratch in the sequel
For as many granular simulation games as we get these days, it&#x27;s not that common to see a full-on numbered sequel. But 2018&#x27;s House Flipper broke through with three million copies sold across PC and consoles, and that was enough for House Flipper 2 to get the green light. Here&#x27;s our first look at gameplay, including a noticeably less &quot;basic&quot; art style.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;aOQCo2rLpdU
I liked the original game for what it was, though I ended up craving a more complete experience with a bigger scope. Cleaning up nasty homes and renovating them is a concept that pretty much sells itself in the simulation space, so I&#x27;m happy to see the developers at Frozen District try again, presumably with more runway this time.
The big change: on top of the returning Story mode, there&#x27;s going to be a Sandbox mode in which you can &quot;build homes from scratch&quot; rather than just shore up existing ones.
 &quot;We’ve put a lot of heart and story into House Flipper 2, polishing our trusty tools, focusing on player creativity, and adding mysteries to uncover,&quot; said lead producer Jakub Bujas in a press statement. &quot;We think returning fans and brand new players alike will enjoy relaxing, creating, and exploring the community of Pinnacove.&quot;
With the widespread warm reception to PowerWash Simulator recently, I feel like more people are giving these sorts of games a chance. And as much as some publishers take a shotgun approach to figuring out the next big sim subject matter (with plenty of duds in the process), among those games that do resonate, the quality bar seems to be rising.
If I&#x27;m being honest, I&#x27;d play a simple &quot;home-cleaning simulator&quot; — it&#x27;s oddly relaxing! — but having a well-rounded renovation and home-building loop will go a long way.
House Flipper 2 is coming to Steam sometime in 2023, and PlayStation and Xbox versions are also planned.

                              <span>It&#x27;s out on December 9
Dragon Quest Treasures is sneaking up on us, as it poises for a December 9 release on Nintendo Switch. It hasn&#x27;t exactly been on my mind given the sheer number of games coming out in October and November, but this new overview trailer perked me up.
In short, this spinoff deals with Erik and Mia, a brother and sister duo who &quot;dream of exploring the world in search of grand treasure.&quot; To do so, you&#x27;ll team up with various monsters, who can provide various abilities to the party to find...more treasure. The gameplay loop seems incredibly carefree, mixed with the signature style of the Dragon Quest series.
In the below four-ish minute video, Square Enix runs you through the basics, including treasure hunting itself (including the various means of traversal), as well as recruitment, the hub/base mechanic, and the main storyline (which deals with rival gangs and the narrative involving the seven rare Dragonstones). Party building in particular looks fun, as your minions can also act out of combat: serving as mounts, and abilities of sorts (like having one throw you up in the air).
Like Monster Hunter, I always at least give these Dragon Quest spinoffs a second look. The series has built up so much goodwill at this point, and if I can fit it into my schedule, Dragon Quest Treasures seems like it&#x27;ll be a breezy December/winter game.

The fantasy-themed Borderlands spin-off game Tiny Tina&#x27;s Wonderlands might have seemed like an experimental one-off, but it&#x27;s been successful enough that Gearbox considers it a new franchise, with &quot;future experiences already under development.&quot;
Gearbox Entertainment CEO Randy Pitchford spoke about Wonderlands at Embracer Group&#x27;s annual general meeting, as transcribed by Video Games Chronicle.
Summing up Tiny Tina&#x27;s Wonderlands as a &quot;major victory,&quot; Pitchford added that the fantasy-tabletop-inspired game &quot;shattered all of our target expectations, both critically and commercially,&quot; and that &quot;in addition to great financial rewards from this victory that will be coming our way in the coming quarters, we have established a firm beachhead.&quot;

Ooblets is one of those games I followed from its announcement all the way back in 2016 up to its release, so it suffices to say this was a highly anticipated game for me. Stardew Valley meets Pokemon is a hell of a logline, and the combination of those gameplay elements compared with the game’s cute, colorful art style basically made it feel like it was made specifically for me. The game went into early access in 2020, but this month it got its full 1.0 release.
You’ve got all the usual mechanics you’d expect from a game like this — farming, fishing, foraging, cooking, befriending villagers — as well as some new twists. You can see clear inspiration from farming sims like Stardew, and yet Ooblets still manages to fe…</span>

                              <span>Valhalla will wait a little while longer
Valkyrie Elysium is right around the corner. But its companion re-release of an old Valkyrie title will take some more time. Square Enix confirms today the re-release of Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth is delayed to December.
Originally a PSP port of the PlayStation 1 classic Valkyrie Profile, Lenneth is set to get a PS4 and PS5 version too. It was meant to coincide with the launch of Valkyrie Elysium on September 29. But to bring it all together, Square is taking a little extra time.
&quot;As we celebrate the launch of Valkyrie Elysium, we unfortunately need a bit more time for Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth to improve the quality of the title and have decided to move the release date to December 22nd, 2022,&quot; the statement reads.
https://twitter.com/ValkyrieGame/status/1572913851783421952
Those who pre-ordered the Digital Deluxe version of Elysium will still be able to get their copy of Lenneth. It will, however, be arriving several months later than expected.
Swapping profiles
It&#x27;s hard to not be curious about why this particular part of Valkyrie Elysium&#x27;s rollout has been pushed back. It would put Valkyrie Profile on a modern console, which would be a huge boon for folks who want to dive back into that story.
Still, a little more time is worth it if it means a good port. And now this puts Lenneth squarely within the holidays. No better way to celebrate family and give thanks than recruiting soldiers for the impending war of Ragnarok.
Valkyrie Elysium, meanwhile, is still arriving on September 29 for PS4 and PS5. I got a chance to check out the demo ahead of its launch. The combat is surprisingly solid, even as it moves the needle from RPG over to action. That demo is available now, if you want to give it a shot.

Epic Games Store has revealed the two new titles that it will be offering up gratis this week. As of Thursday, September 22, all EGS users will be able to download Studio Wildcard&#x27;s Ark: Survival Evolved and Asmodee Digital&#x27;s Gloomhaven completely free of charge.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;5fIAPcVdZO8
Released for PC and consoles way back in 2017, Ark: Survival Evolved is — as its name denotes — a survival title set in an anachronistic prehistoric world. As a human outfitted with more modern technologies, players must build bases and habitats within a huge open world, gathering resources and increasing defenses while fending off attacks from rampaging packs of dinosaurs and potentially hostile human players. Players can also capture and tame dinosaurs for transport and guard duties.
Originally released for Steam Early Access back in 2015, developer Studio Wildcard has slowly built upon the original title in the ensuing years, adding more features, PvE modes, additional dinosaurs, and expansive new lands, objectives, and questlines. Ark: Survival Evolved would be ported to mobile and Nintendo Switch in 2018, and the Stadia platform in 2021.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;-SGDEP-zFHo
Developed by Flaming Fowl Studios, Gloomhaven is a digital adaptation of the fantasy tabletop title of the same name. Set against the backdrop of the grim titular &#x27;berg, players guide packs of class-based mercenaries on quests and missions, utilizing their characters&#x27; unique skills and abilities to overcome any opposition. The digital edition of Gloomhaven is, more or less, a direct adaptation of the tabletop game, following the same rules and objectives of its physical source.
Both Ark: Survival Evolved and Gloomhaven will be free on the Epic Games Store from September 22 until September 29.
Next week&#x27;s free games will be Runbow and The Drone Racing League.

Diddy Kong and Pauline are the latest free DLC/update characters for Mario Strikers: Battle League, and they&#x27;re out now.
Originally confirmed in the recent September Nintendo Direct, this is actually a full-on update for Battle League, billed as version 1.2.0. It not only adds the aforementioned content (Diddy Kong, Pauline, the Planetoid stadium, and more gear), it also serves as an adjustment patch of sorts. CPU teammates are now snappier, charge times for perfect passes have been tweaked, and you now earn more coins in general. Clubs will also now be barred from participating in a season for 30 days of idle time as opposed to 90 days if no one appears online during that time period.
Note that this follows the prior July update (1.1.0), which added Daisy, Shy G…</span>

League of Geeks, the team behind Armello, is diving into the vault and bringing back a cult-classic. The studio&#x27;s next title is a reimagining of Solium Infernum, a political strategy game that pits would-be rulers against each other for the highest seat in Hell.
Originally released in 2009, Solium Infernum did not receive a ton of widespread attention. Victor Davis&#x27; strategy game, created under the studio Cryptic Comet, did latch on with some particular journalists and blogs though. Long series like one over at Rock Paper Shotgun dove deep into the politics and strategy, finding a lot to like about it.

                              <span>It&#x27;s out on September 27
A Capcom Fighting Collection update is on the way, and will feature several quality-of life enhancements like viewable hitboxes.
Due out on all platforms on September 27, Capcom has boasted the following updates:
Viewable hitboxes
New gem colors for Puzzle Fighter
The option to see your opponent&#x27;s connection status
So the first one is obviously the crown jewel, as it&#x27;ll allow players to view more technical information when training, presumably across the entire array of games in the collection. It&#x27;ll be fascinating to see if any new tech arises from some of the more obscure titles in those scenes. Gem color options for Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo is just how it sounds, and seems like an aesthetic update, but will actually add more options for colorblind players. The network connection status addition will be more helpful, especially since Capcom is teasing that it works while viewing potential matches in lobbies.
As a recap, here are the games included in the Capcom Fighting Collection:
Darkstalkers: The Night Warriors
Night Warriors: Darkstalkers’ Revenge
Vampire Savior: The Lord of Vampire
Vampire Hunter 2: Darkstalkers’ Revenge
Vampire Savior 2: The Lord of Vampire
Hyper Street Fighter II: The Anniversary Edition
Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo
Super Gem Fighter Mini Mix [Pocket Fighter]
Cyberbots: Full Metal Madness
Red Earth

                              <span>&quot;Conch shells obtained before voting may disappear&quot;
A Splatoon 3 Splatfest bug has been detected — but the good news is that Nintendo has officially recognized it, and has provided a workaround.
Here&#x27;s the full rundown from Nintendo: &quot;A bug has been found in Splatoon 3 in which conch shells obtained before voting may disappear and will not count towards the Splatfest results.&quot; And here&#x27;s the temporary workaround: &quot;To avoid this issue, we recommend players vote in the Splatfest before collecting conch shells.&quot;
So breaking this down, you basically just want to choose your side in the Splatfest immediately, or as soon as possible before playing matches. After that, everything you earn will be above board. Nintendo notes that the bug &quot;will be fixed in the future,&quot; so thankfully it&#x27;s just for this particular Splatfest. Again, this only applies to the event happening this weekend.
In any case, it&#x27;s good to see Nintendo pounce on these issues quickly, before they get out of hand. The first few weeks of support can be crucial for maintaining a long-term playerbase, and I&#x27;m looking forward to whatever &quot;long-term solution&quot; they have for Splatfest 4v2v2 Tricolor matches. The pre-launch event was pretty much the only shaky experience I had with this game, so if they can nail that, they can add some momentum.

Shovel Knight may never die — and I&#x27;d be completely okay with that! The franchise, born in 2014 with the original entry, created a cottage industry for Yacht Club Games, who incorporated the series into multiple projects and has spawned an empire of sorts. While we wait for Mina the Hollower to arrive, there&#x27;s more Shovel Knight coming your way this month.
Shovel Knight Dig, a roguelite platformer, is the latest attempt to mix things up. Thankfully, it&#x27;s very close to the spirit of the original game.

                              <span>Running it back
The Dark Souls III PC servers were back up, and now it seems they&#x27;re back down again. Players are reporting in, unable to access the game, and the social account has acknowledged a confirmed issue.
As noted by PC Gamer, speculation had started picking up yesterday on the Steam forums, where users were starting to have issues with the servers.
A new tweet from the Dark Souls brand account on Twitter notes that there is a confirmed issue with Dark Souls III online play, via the Steam platform.
&quot;We are investigating the source of the problem and will inform you as soon as more details become available,&quot; the update says. &quot;Thank you for your patience.&quot;

Rise again, Ashen One
The PC servers for Dark Souls III were off for quite a while. Users discovered an exploit in the Souls series that has kept its PC versions offline for most of the year. Online PC services only just recently came back online for Dark Souls III. The team behind the updates had previously said they were working on bringing services back for the other back-entries in the Souls series, but now it looks like Dark Souls III may need more attention.
Meanwhile, Elden Ring had the specific vulnerability addressed pre-launch and has been cooking along just fine. So for PC players, the only FromSoft multiplayer game in town is Elden Ring once again.
It&#x27;s a bummer, as each game has had its own meta-game and PvP communities. Numbers even seemed to jump up a bit for Dark Souls III after the fix was implemented.
Though no specifics have been given, hopefully this fix doesn&#x27;t take months like the others have. We&#x27;ll learn more as the Souls team works on getting the Dark Souls III PC servers back up.

                              <span>Star Citizen passes yet another impressive milestone
It&#x27;s a known fact that it takes a long, long time to make games, but Cloud Imperium Games is testing gamers&#x27; patience with their in-development title Star Citizen, which began pre-production all the way back in 2010. The game was officially announced in 2012 with the launch of a Kickstarter campaign to raise funds for development, and while it was anticipated to release in 2014, the game was delayed multiple times... and still is yet to receive any sort of official release window.
Ten years after the launch of the Star Citizen crowdfunding campaign, the game has reached an incredible milestone by raising over $500 million — the official count as of today is $500,075,150 from 4,096,384 backers. (Thanks, Eurogamer.) I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m mor…</span>

Significant on the AMD side is extending GPU support back to GFX9/Vega. Thus it&#x27;s a good time for a fresh round of benchmarking for showing how the AMD Radeon HIP performance against that of NVIDIA&#x27;s existing CUDA and OptiX back-ends.</span>

                              <span>Finally, golf for everybody (with a Switch).
Clap Hanz is a studio closely linked with PlayStation, producing hugely popular titles Everybody&#x27;s Golf / Hot Shots Golf across multiple generations (over the course of 20 years+). Recently it loosened up its swing and went another way, however, releasing Clap Hanz Golf on Apple Arcade. It&#x27;s that title which is now on Switch as Easy Come Easy Golf; yep, brand identity with this developer can get a bit muddled.
For those that never jumped into the PlayStation games, this is a welcome chance to experience the studio&#x27;s blend of easygoing visuals, cartoonish caricatures and decidedly addictive golf. It&#x27;s a refined round for sure, and thanks to those smart device origins it supports multiple ways to play — you can opt for touchscreen swipe controls in portable mode, while on a controller you can utilise stick swings or the more classic three-button press. All are certainly functional, but this reviewer is a boomer that insists golf games be played with the three-tap meter, and it works nicely here.

If you are unfortunate enough to have not graced Twitter in the past 24 hours (we don&#x27;t necessarily blame you), then you probably will have missed the meteoric rise of Trombone Champ, and with it&#x27;s Mii-style visuals, it had us feeling a bit reminiscent.
This Guitar Hero-inspired game from Holy Wow Studios is an absolute hoot (or should we say toot?) and the internet has gone wild for videos of people butchering musical classics such as Beethoven&#x27;s &#x27;Fifth Symphony&#x27; and the national anthem for both the UK and US.

Recently we were invited down to Nintendo&#x27;s UK headquarters by Ubisoft – we can only assume they got permission first – to have a bash at the upcoming strategy bwaaah-athon that is Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope.
We sat down and were able to play around three hours of the turn-based tactical crossover sequel, and despite one somewhat embarrassing oversight in the game&#x27;s mechanics in one part of one of the planets we visited, we had rather a good time with it, to say the least.

                              <span>After a copyright blunder led to a major boost for the horror genre, George A. Romero&#x27;s Night of the Living Dead became a public domain classic. But in a terrifying new twist, YouTubers are now completely surrounded by a horde of Content ID notices claiming ownership and monetization rights. Screams for help are being ignored as Universal Music-owned Ingrooves gorges on the spoils.

Research by Parks Associates reveals that this percentage has increased significantly in recent years. According to some experts and insiders, this can in part be explained by the fragmented streaming landscape.

                              <span>Illumination’s Super Mario Bros. film will get its first teaser trailer next month. It also has a new premiere date for the film following its delay in April. 
The animated film, starring Chris Pratt as the titular plumber, will hit theaters on April 7, 2023. The biggest question regarding the film has been what Pratt’s Mario performance will sound like, and we may finally get to hear it in just a few weeks. The movie’s first teaser trailer premieres on October 6 at 4 p.m. ET during the New York Comic Con.

The Super Mario Bros. cast also includes Charlie Day as Luigi, Anya Taylor-Joy as Peach, Jack Black as Bowser, Keegan-Michael Key as Toad, and Seth Rogan as Donkey Kong. The film was delayed to ensure quality, though Nintendo was reportedly been pleased last year with how the film was shaping up at that point. Pratt recently described his performance as “unlike anything you’ve heard in the Mario world”, and it apparently won&#x27;t have an Italian accent.</span>

                              <span>The RPS-beloved turn-based strategy game Solium Infernum is back from the dead. Announced earlier today on stage at EGX London 2022, Armello creators League Of Geeks will be resurrecting and reimagining the game in 2023. Originally released in 2009 by solo dev Vic Davis and his studio Cryptic Comet, Solium Infernum cast you as an Archfiend hoping to stake a claim for Satan&#x27;s empty throne. With a strong emphasis on political intrigue and Machiavellian backstabbing over taking things by force, this strategy game from hell was a firm RPS favourite back in the day, spawning an eight-part diary series of the team&#x27;s play-by-email multiplayer adventures. Alas, it never quite found the audience it deserved back in the early 2010s, eventually causing Davis to shut up shop completely in 2015 and pursue a career in tabletop.
League Of Geeks are here to change that, though, and after speaking with studio director and co-founder Trent Kusters (both at EGX earlier today and during a hands-off presentation of their pre-alpha demo late last week), it&#x27;s clear the team have taken great care in bringing Solium Infernum up to date for modern audiences. It leans into all the same kinds of mind games as Cryptic Comet&#x27;s original, and its simultaneous turn structure is still very much intact – just with lusher 3D visuals, and all-new, revamped menu screens. And it looks devilishly good.

                              <span>Playing Wayward Strand feels like navigating a detailed clockwork mechanism. It reminds me of those cuckoo clocks where on the hour every hour a tiny door opens revealing two mechanical dolls that come together and have a &#x27;lil smooch. That’s essentially how Wayward Strand works but on a bigger scale. Characters are set on strict routines, following predetermined paths and schedules that are often invisible to you. They welcome an interruption - a friendly natter or helpful hand - but whether you’re there or not, they’ll go about their business regardless. The world keeps on spinning and all that.
It’s an interesting way of capturing the passage of time, and in Wayward Strand how you choose to spend that time is pretty important in a game that makes a point of not waiting for you.

                              <span>Nvidia stuck to the high-end goods for their GeForce RTX 40 series announcement, revealing their next graphics card generation with only the premier RTX 4090 and two flavours of RTX 4080. All three are coming soon with varying degrees of price bumps over the RTX 3090 and RTX 3080, though Nvidia reckon the performance and feature improvements of the 40 series’ Ada Lovelace architecture will make them worthy investments. Especially with the aid of DLSS 3, a new and significantly upgraded version of Nvidia’s DLSS upscaler that will only work with RTX 40 series GPUs at launch.

                              <span>Long-troubled sci-fi action RPG Cyberpunk 2077 is experiencing something of a comeback, almost two years since it was released on PC and consoles. CD Projekt have revealed in a tweet that the game has seen one million players every day this week so far, across all platforms. They say this figure includes players new to Night City, as well as those returning. I’ve never played it, so don’t look at me.

Oh, and they&#x27;re cheeping little tinging cheeps! And they hop back if I step towards them! And they flutter into the skies if I charge! And form a big flock if I chase long enough! Ah. Yeah, I think I see how our character earned a place in superhell.

                              <span>Indie rhythm game Trombone Champ released on Steam last week, and it deserves a round of applause for its sheer commitment to the brass majesty of the ‘bone. Maybe it’s the selection of classic bangers such as Old Grey Mare and Take Me Out To The Ballgame, or perhaps it&#x27;s the constant prompts of NASTY and PERFECTO, but devs Holy Wow seem to be on to a winner. If you haven’t already witnessed the game in action then please do yourself a favour and watch the trailer below.

FromSoftware confirmed that PvP multiplayer for the Steam version of the game had gone offline in a tweet, and said they’d provide an update once details were available to share. When I published this post, no explanation was forthcoming about what the cause of the downtime might be.

                              <span>Have you ever played a game and thought, &quot;Are we actually the bad guys here?&quot; Usually, the whole &quot;we&#x27;re fighting on the wrong side of history&quot; line is a deliberate plot device in RPGs, offering moments of clarity to not only peel back the curtain and provide fresh impetus for the events yet to come, but also to cleverly reframe everything you&#x27;ve achieved so far. I don&#x27;t say this to spoil the events of The DioField Chronicle, the new real-time strategy game from Lancarse and Square Enix, but it is a question I found myself asking a lot during its middle act - and it never quite delivers the punchline you&#x27;re looking for. 
Around 8-10 hours into the game, there&#x27;s an extended portion of the campaign that sees your band of Blue Fox mercenaries bringing an entire region of DioField Island to heel because they&#x27;re, err, pro democracy. Of the cast&#x27;s central quartet, only one stands up as a voice of reason when motions are made to quell these despicable riots, but he&#x27;s repeatedly shot down every time he tries to offer an alternate view. Eventually, one character says to him, and I quote, &quot;Isca, what has got into you? You ought to know the danger posed by the ideology of democracy.&quot; It&#x27;s an odd stance for someone clearly not a villain to take in 2022, although really, I should have probably seen it coming. Our mercs work for a duke after all, and most are aristocratic nobles who are handy with a sword. Oh no. I think this might actually be played: Tories - The Game. Yuck.

The T2A series is powered by Ampere Altra processors and complement the Tau T2D series powered by AMD EPYC 7003 &quot;Milan&quot; processors that launched last year.

                              <span>The Apple TV show Ted Lasso has proven to be one of the most popular and well-liked series of the last few years, introducing viewers to a lovable cast of characters whose lives and storylines largely revolve around the fictional English Premier League football club, AFC Richmond. Through its first two seasons, the series has taken home numerous awards, including the Primetime Emmy for Outstanding Comedy Series in 2021 and 2022, with several of its actors – including Jason Sudeikis, Brett Goldstein, and Hannah Waddingham – taking home awards for original performances. Now, Ted Lasso reaches into a new realm: video games. 
EA Sports today announced that Ted Lasso and AFC Richmond are joining the FIFA 23 roster of teams. Lasso is joined on the sidelines by Coach Beard, with the pitch being populated by some of the team&#x27;s biggest stars like Jamie Tartt, Roy Kent, Dani Rojas, Sam Obisanya, and Isaac McAdoo. While the actors&#x27; likenesses are included in the product, EA Sports hasn&#x27;t indicated if we&#x27;ll be hearing Jamie Tartt and Roy Kent&#x27;s signature crowd chants (though it seems doubtful, seeing as how Roy Kent&#x27;s chant would probably bump the ESRB rating up to M for Mature).
Regardless of that fact, you can play matches at AFC Richmond&#x27;s home ground, Nelson Road, and even take control of Coach Lasso or AFC Richmond through Career Mode. AFC Richmond is also playable in Kick-Off, Online Friendlies, and Online Seasons. FIFA 23 Ultimate Team is also adding several AFC Richmond customization items, including kits, TIFOs, and the option to select Ted Lasso or Coach Beard as your FUT club&#x27;s manager. All the AFC Richmond content in FUT will be obtainable through objectives and challenges.
You can see Ted Lasso and the AFC Richmond squad in action through the trailer below.


FIFA 23 arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4. Xbox One, PC, and Stadia on September 30.</span>

When Gun Interactive revealed The Texas Chain Saw Massacre last year, I was underwhelmed by its short teaser but excited about its potential. It’s one of my favorite horror movie franchises, partly because of how much it still scares me – every good haunted house has a Leatherface at the end that chases you out to the exit, right? – but also because of its backdrop: Texas. Horror, be it movies or games, typically draws attention to dreary atmospheres, spooky ambiance, perhaps some bad weather, and nighttime. The Texas Chain Saw Massacre bucked that trend in the 1970s.

                              <span>Last time, you decided that impossible geometry is better than games playing the music CD left in your drive. As someone definitely not attempting to rig the vote, I respect people on both sides yet am pleased by this outcome. This week, ah sure, why not have another crack at pitting two similar-ish things against each other. It feels against the spirit of the competition but I&#x27;m curious. Let&#x27;s try two sounds. What&#x27;s better: ding! or the Howie scream?

                              <span>I&#x27;m a sucker for invention when it comes to story in video games, and Beacon Pines drew me in with what looked like a choice-driven adventure. As you explore the down-on-its-luck farming town of the title, you discover &#x27;charms&#x27;. Each charm is a word which can be deployed at set points to branch the story in new, severe ways. More importantly, you can flip back and forth between these pivotal moments at any time, allowing you to deploy new words in earlier chapters to see what happens.

Except, Beacon Pines is far less choice-driven than I expected. Instead, it&#x27;s something far rarer and more ambitious in video games: it is a good story, well written, with strong characters you grow to care for.

Creator Derek Yu said that more updates are planned for Spelunky 2, but the next step is to get feedback on multiplayer to improve the experience now its basic features are there. Don’t expect any more additions to single-player though, as the focus there is bug fixes.

The company said they became aware of the attack early yesterday, after an “unauthorized third party” managed to access the credentials of a vendor to 2K’s help desk platform. The hacker then fired off a message to some accounts that contained a malicious link.

He’s still packed to the circuit boards with machine guns, lasers and drones, even if he is an own-brand alternative to the Armoured Avenger.

                              <span>The best way I can explain the difference between Devil Daggers and its surprise sequel is comparison to another pair of goth-o-ramas: Devil Daggers is Dark Souls to Hyper Demon&#x27;s Bloodborne. Both first-person score attack shooters are dressed in similar beautiful cloaks of skulls and gurgling industrial soundscapes, but while Devil Daggers nudges you into cautious survival, Hyper Demon shoves you into aggression. In Hyper Demon, a long and cautious run will likely score lower than a short burst of ultraviolence. What glorious ultraviolence it is!
When I first saw Hyper Demon&#x27;s trailer, I felt excitement, wonder, and fear. Here&#x27;s the important thing to realise: the unearthly and incomprehensible violence you see in that trailer is genuinely what the game looks like to play. That&#x27;s how it feels to play, too.

Nope - the game wasn&#x27;t what I expected at all. At least, not the 45-minute portion I got to play. Rather, my demo was more of a hardcore puzzler with some exploration elements and the teeniest smattering of action. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it was still unsettling and grotesque! Just in more of a brain-training way, if the brain-training was for MIT graduates, or like, the human calculators on University Challenge.

                              <span>Eerie two-person adventure The Past Within is turning the Rusty Lake escape room series into a co-op experience on November 2nd. If you’re easily spooked like me then you’ll need to pester a friend or family member to play along with you, as one person plays in the past while the other plays in the future. Watch the trailer below, and stop checking your shadow.

                              <span>As expected, Nvidia have announced the GeForce RTX 4090 during their GeForce Beyond livestream – and confirmed the RTX 4080 for good measure. Both GPUs are based on Nvidia’s new Ada Lovelace architecture, and will launch this year: the RTX 4090 on October 12th, and the RTX 4080 sometime in November. 


Key features of Ada Lovelace, and thus these new cards, include 3rd Gen RT cores, 4th Gen Tensor cores, and a new streaming multiprocessor. These supposedly add up to twice the performance of Ampere (that’s the RTX 30 series architecture currently dominating our best graphics card guide) in standard rasterised games, and up to four times the performance in ray traced games. And since Nvidia were clearly in a ray-tracey mood, they also took the opportunity to reveal Portal RTX: a semi-official mod for the original Portal that upgrades it with RT lighting and reflection effects. Corrrr.

Today, Marvel Games and Motive Studios have revealed they’re working together on a new game starring the armoured Avenger. Marvel announced the project with a single shadowy image of Iron Man and his shiny gamer highlights on Twitter. They described the game as an “all-new single-player, third-person, action-adventure title”. The dev team is being led by Olivier Proulx, who previously worked on Eidos-Montréal’s Marvel’s Guardians Of The Galaxy. Motive are known for 2020’s Star Wars: Squadrons and the upcoming Dead Space remake.

Except the game didn’t seem to be following the naming convention of its predecessor Yakuza: Like A Dragon, instead ditching the part associated with the Japanese crime syndicate. The head of series developers Ryu Ga Gotoku, Masayoshi Yokoyama, has since confirmed the change in a recent interview (thanks IGN).

                              <span>For what is now the fifth time in a row, Valve have announced that waiting Steam Deck reservation holders will get their SteamOS handheld earlier than anticipated. That’s thanks to yet another uptick in production speed, according to a Steam Community post, so everyone whose delivery estimate was in Q3 2022 should now have received their confirmation email. Fulfilment of the final remaining Q4 batch is now fully underway, after a smaller handful of lucky Q4-ers were bumped forward into Q3.

Paradox have added a new difficulty setting aimed at easing in new players aboard Stellaris’ long-running interstellar skiff, along with some new adjustments they’re hoping will challenge more experienced players. The update also rebalances relics, improves UI and AI, and brings back Culture Workers.

Well, that’s exactly what’s happened for some of us today. Hyper Demon seems to be all about the disembodied, infernal craniums too, but don’t call it a sequel. Brace yourself as you watch the nightmarish trailer below. It&#x27;s a wild one.

What’s more, according an interview with Gamers Nexus, their reasoning is a lack of “respect” shown to them by Nvidia themselves. Suffice to say, there won’t be an EVGA version of the RTX 4090 or any RTX 40 series GPU that might be announced during Nvidia’s GeForce Beyond event later today.

It’s also emerged that the same hacker may have been responsible for a breach of rideshare platform Uber last week. Uber say they’re in contact with both the FBI and the U.S. Department Of Justice over the hacks.

                              <span>The Sonic the Hedgehog brand&#x27;s expansion throughout multimedia has given fans plenty to enjoy in recent years. Whether you&#x27;re talking about the two well-received films, the fun Sonic Boom animated series, or the long-running and beloved comic series, people who enjoy the Sonic the Hedgehog video games have had plenty of other avenues to expand their fandom. The next project to land on that list is Sonic Prime, the upcoming Netflix series that gives us all-new adventures with Sonic and his friends/enemies.
Today, Netflix and Sega released a teaser trailer giving us a taste of the action. It doesn&#x27;t show much, but if the 40 seconds of action are any indication, it&#x27;s bringing plenty of style and fun (as well as several classic characters). You can check out the trailer in the header above.
Sonic Prime is set to release exclusively on Netflix this winter. For more on what else Sonic is getting up to this winter, check out our exclusive coverage hub of Sonic Frontiers here. For our thoughts on the latest Sonic video game release, Sonic Origins, head here.</span>

Funkce je určená pro kvalitní náhodná čísla a již nějakou dobu nepoužívá arc4. Jason kritizoval spíše způsob inicializace (seed) a připravil rozhraní pro funkci getrandom() v jaderném vDSO (virtual dynamic shared object). Ta jde pak použít jednoduše i v user-space a má všechny výhody a bezpečnou náhodnou inicializaci jaderné implementace.</span>

                              <span>To plant my piratey flag up front, I am an extremely huge fan of the Monkey Island series, and am therefore almost exactly who Return To Monkey Island is aimed at. After several adventures with other devs, sometime-mighty pirate Guybrush Threepwood (a name that invites as many tedious jokes as Benedict Cumberbatch, which is a trap I won&#x27;t be falling into) is back with his some of his original progenitors Ron Gilbert and Dave Grossman - Gilbert being the director for the first two Islands Monkey.
I was expecting Return To Monkey Island to be a delightful croquembouche of point and click puzzles artfully piled up with puns and meta jokes, all slathered in the sticky, sugary caramel of nostalgia. And it is that. But I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to contain a gentle rumination on getting old and figuring out what things are really worth caring about.

                              <span>Asus&#x27; Zephyrus G14 is my favourite all-AMD gaming laptop, and today the latest generation model is going cheap at Best Buy. This specification packs in a Ryzen 9 6900HS processor, Radeon RX 6700S GPU, 1TB NVMe SSD, 16GB of DDR5 and a 14-in 1440p 120Hz screen - and it&#x27;s been discounted from $1650 to $1350, saving you $300. That&#x27;s an awesome price for this level of performance, all in a compact 14-in chassis that&#x27;s easy to tote around or work with on the go.

The AimJunkies defendants, who previously distributed &#x27;Destiny 2 Hacks’, deny any wrongdoing and have now filed a countersuit. Turning the tables, they accuse Bungie of hacking, stealing computer data, and circumventing the DMCA.

                              <span>The RTX 4090 is all but confirmed now, based on the sheer volume of leaks, rumours and speculation showing off the next-gen Nvidia GPU in a variety of guises but sharing the same specs. That&#x27;s pushed the prices of current-gen GPUs way down, and that&#x27;s especially true for high-end cards. Ergo, it&#x27;s not a massive surprise to see the Nvidia RTX 3090 Ti, Team Green&#x27;s flagship card, down to just $999 at Amazon after debuting at twice that figure.

                              <span>EVGA may be getting out of the graphics card business, but they&#x27;re still one of the premiere brands for high-quality power supplies. One massive 1600W 80+ Platinum unit has been highly discounted over in the States, where the EVGA SuperNova 1600 P+ is down to $200 from its original price of $500. That&#x27;s an awesome deal on a power supply ideally suited for high-end, multiple-GPU systems - and doesn&#x27;t cost much more than a Platinum-rated 1000W PSU.

                              <span>A huge number of videos purporting to show in-game development footage for GTA 6 have been plastered across various internet forums this morning, because apparently no one can wait until a video game is actually anywhere near finished before they feel compelled to spoil it for all and sundry. 
The 80-some clips seemingly show everything from full, in-game scenarios to clearly unfinished bits of grey boxing, but you won&#x27;t find a link to them here, because the truth is, they&#x27;re simply not worth looking at. What possible benefit could they provide anyone right here, right now? The leaker gets their five minutes of fame and an influx of new followers, sure. But GTA 6 itself isn&#x27;t going to look anything like what you see in those clips when it&#x27;s actually finished, so someone please tell me, what is even the point?

                              <span>In the wake of the Hotfile lawsuit, the Motion Picture Association asked the court to keep some anti-piracy information forever out of the public eye. That was too long for Judge Williams who, after a slight delay, unsealed the contested documents last week. Among other things, the information reveals that for infringing video content to be flagged, it must exceed a certain duration.

The problem is so bad that the researchers fell prey to multiple ransomware attacks. Intriguingly, the findings also suggest that pirate sites are &#x27;safer&#x27; than before, although that greatly depends on which studies you look at.

                              <span>Half-Life: Alyx demonstrated that Valve&#x27;s first-person shooter series could work in virtual reality, but who knows when Valve will release another one. Thankfully some modders have stepped in to fill the void. There&#x27;s now a publicly playable beta of Half-Life 2: VR Mod available on Steam that makes the nearly 20-year-old shooter playable with a headset and motion controllers.

                              <span>Castle Dimitrescu was one of the many highlights of Resident Evil Village, so it makes sense that Capcom are returning to it in the game&#x27;s upcoming DLC adventure, Shadows Of Rose. Set 16 years after the events of Village, this story expansion centres on Rose, the daughter of Village protagonist Ethan Winters, as she comes to terms with her emerging mold powers. She was just a teeny, tiny baby when her dad was fighting off the very tall vampire lady in the base game, but now she&#x27;s all grown up and wants to be rid of the supernatural spore abilities that have been plaguing her family ever since the events of Resident Evil 7. 
It&#x27;s not yet clear what role Lady D&#x27;s castle has to play in Rose&#x27;s journey, but man, it sure is nice to be back roaming its ornate hallways again. Or rather it would be, if it weren&#x27;t for all the ashen mold men stalking its corridors, and its rather gross (but strangely hypnotic) rivers of undulating strawberry jam gore that have been plastered all over the walls, floor and ceiling. Ach, now it&#x27;s on my shoes. Great. And the gate&#x27;s locked behind me. Fantastic. I knew coming back here would be a bad idea…

Why do I always let my holiday days slide down and clump at the end of the year. Better make the most of comfortable swimming and cycling while I still can.

Both parties have now submitted their statement of claims to the jury. The record labels believe that the ISP is liable and seek significant damages. Grande disputes this assertion, noting that it never induced or encouraged subscribers to pirate anything.

                              <span>Hot on the heels of this week&#x27;s announcement of Ken, Dhalsim, Blanka, and E.Honda in Street Fighter 6, Capcom has posted the opening video of World Tour mode from the highly anticipated sixth mainline entry in its legendary fighting franchise. Through the video, the publisher reveals the full fighter roster at launch, featuring a good mix of fresh faces and familiar foes.
The launch lineup of fighters includes 18 characters to choose from. You can see the full list below.
Blanka
Cammy
Chun-Li
Dee Jay
Dhalsim
E. Honda
Guile
Jamie
JP
Juri
Ken
Kimberly
Lily
Luke
Manon
Marisa
Ryu
Zangief


Many of these fighters made their first appearances in Street Fighter (Ken and Ryu) or Street Fighter II (Blanka, Cammy, Chun-Li, Dee Jay, Dhalsim, E. Honda, Guile, Zangief). However, some fresher faces include Juri (debuted in Street Fighter IV) and Luke (debuted in Street Fighter V), and six all-new characters: Jamie, JP, Kimberly, Lily, Manon, and Marisa.
Check out the opening movie above and start plotting who will be your main when Street Fighter 6 launches on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC next year.

                              <span>Logitech&#x27;s G29 racing wheel and pedals is down to $230 at Amazon, offering a great chance to pick up a highly-regarded budget wheel at a fair price. 
The G29 set works with PC, PS4 and PS5, making it a good pickup for anyone with at least one of these systems that likes to play titles like Gran Turismo 7 or F1 22. There&#x27;s also an Xbox Series, Xbox One and PC model, the G920, that&#x27;s available at the same discounted price and of course will work well for games like Forza Horizon 5, F1 22 and the upcoming Forza Motorsport scheduled to arrive early next year.

                              <span>Higher speed, lower latency DDR5 is becoming more affordable, and in the US we spotted a great deal on TeamGroup memory over at Amazon. There, you can find a 32GB kit of DDR5-5600 CL36 memory for $150, reduced from its normal price of $180. That&#x27;s more expensive than 32GB of DDR4, but you&#x27;re getting a substantial increase in bandwidth and reduction in latency compared to the DDR5-4800 CL40 JEDEC standard.

You know, Nightdive, them what are remaking System Shock and who, erm, tried to remaster Blade Runner. It’s coming to Steam and GOG early in 2023.

                              <span>Man, I was worried this week. I&#x27;ve had a string of possible reports that were all disappointingly tepid. Then I played Trail Out, a chaotic crash-and-ram racing game with, for some reason, a story mode about a former stunt driver who is very much some guy. I&#x27;m still not sure if he&#x27;s talking to himself, through the fourth wall, or to his dog. His best friend wears a gas mask and lifts weights in the junkyard without breaking eye contact.
The racing is very solid, but more importantly it has character. Odd, odd character.

An in-game celebration of all things Bavarian that’s riffing on the actual Oktoberfest, Arktoberfest runs until October 3rd. It’ll bring themed festival foods to the game, along with some staggeringly well-balanced beer steins. Arktoberfest is the first big event to come to Lost Ark in the West that wasn&#x27;t in the original Korean and Russian version of the game.

                              <span>The Steam Deck’s Asia release has taken it to the Tokyo Game Show, following a solo launch event that included several surviving Steam Deck prototypes. In my report on the latter I made some passing references to a novelty oversized Deck that Valve were building for their TGS booth, completely unaware of how often I’d find myself admiring it a few days later. See, the Steam Deck booth at TGS, from the towering scale model to the weirdly impressive elegance of its logistics, might be the finest event booth I’ve ever seen.

                              <span>Clearly in direct response to that one moan I had about the lack of reliable GeForce RTX 40 series info, Nvidia are now teasing what’s very likely a launch event for their next generation of GPUs. The official Nvidia GeForce Twitter account has been vagueposting about something called #ProjectBeyond, starting with a coded image on September 8th and more recently listing a date and time: 8am PDT (4pm BST) on September 20th.
Given it’s about time in Nvidia’s preferred biannual cycle for a new graphics card generation, and it being the GeForce account rather than one of Nvidia’s non-gaming brands, and Nvidia also dropping the cryptic stuff and just straight-up confirming a &quot;GeForce Beyond&quot; show on the 20th, you can bet your sweet memory bus that September 20th will see some kind of RTX GPU announcement. The RTX 30 series, which has contributed most of the past two years’ best graphics cards, will finally begin its journey into semi-retirement.

                              <span>Yesterday at the Tokyo Games Show, Capcom formally announced the addition of Ken, Blanka, E.Honda and Dhalsim to the Street Fighter 6 roster. Technically, none of this should come as a surprise. Not only are they all Street Fighter faithfuls, but pretty much the entire cast list got leaked back in June thanks to some rogue character art. One thing that has been pleasantly surprising, however, is learning that Ken, pictured in that leaked document as looking rather dishevelled and rocking a bit of a &#x27;sad, middle-aged dad&#x27; look, is anything but.
Indeed, when I went to play the latest build of Street Fighter 6 at Capcom&#x27;s UK offices earlier in the week, Ken was absolutely killing it. Rather than suffering from a mid-life crisis, Ken was hauling it across the screen like an absolute battering ram, clearly full of the same mad protein shakes his mate Ryu&#x27;s been hawking down since their last SF outing, as both of them have gone full-on Redfield Beefcake this time.

                              <span>Beastie-battling action RPG Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak is getting a second free update on September 29th. While there’s some new monsters to square off against, I feel the most critically important part of the update is the layered weapons system. This gives you the option to unsheathe some truly bizarre weaponry, including something that appears to be a comically huge ear of sweet corn. Witness for yourself by watching the trailer below.

                              <span>Hop on your horse and head out for revenge in Card Cowboy, a delightful new indie game you can get for free. Your adventure unfolds by making decisions using cards which represent allies, resources, and events, which often have weird and surprising consequences. Weirdly, the game it most reminds me of is Townscaper: throw pieces together, uncertain what will happen, then be surprised and delighted what the system produces. Like accidentally making your cowboy confess his love for his horse, leading to a fresh new baby horse card in your hand. Oh no.

                              <span>I’ve always thought each of the sixteen colossi in Shadow Of The Colossus is kinda cute in their own special way. There’s just something about the animal-like antics of those immense, lumbering creatures that make them naturally adorable, even though they wouldn’t hesitate in breaking every single bone in my small, weak body.
Zürich-based developers Stray Fawn Studio totally get what I’m on about, and have created their own lovable rocky giant in their city-building sim The Wandering Village. Their creature, Onbu, is a colossal six-legged beast, and the walking platform on which your village sits, a plateau of flat land mass on its back making for an excellent settlement ground. Onbu is best described as a gentle giant. They move slowly but carefully, love to munch on fields of wild mushrooms, nap in meadows of soft pink flowers, and tuck in their paws and tail when sleeping.

                              <span>Tokyo Game Show provided an opportunity to try out the latest build of Street Fighter 6. Although Capcom just pulled the curtain back on the next batch of fighters to join the roster, my demo included the first playable sessions for the last trio of reveals: Guile, Juri, and newcomer Kimberly. Since Kimberly was the wildcard of that bunch, I opted to spend most of my hands-on time discovering what she brings to the table. After only a few rounds, I had a tough time wanting to switch to anyone else.
If you haven’t been keeping up, Kimberly is a ninja pupil of Guy who adores the ‘80s and graffiti. She incorporates the latter interest into her acrobatic offense, such as throwing exploding spray cans like they’re shurikens. That’s silly and fantastic. She’s also set to play a pivotal role in t…</span>

The Pokémon franchise has been more prolific than usual as of late, with multiple releases over the past year and another big entry coming soon. However, those without a Switch or looking for a suitable monster-battling alternative should focus on Temtem, which has emerged from years of early-access development. While borrowing heavily from the formula of Nintendo’s massive franchise, its world is fun to explore, and collecting and learning all about the titular Temtems is satisfying.

                              <span>I adore Final Fantasy VII, and I was similarly enamored with Remake. Given the latter game’s events and the tantalizing trailer for its second part, Rebirth, it had me thinking that it may be a good time to dust off my copy of 2008’s Crisis Core. Square Enix read my mind by announcing a remaster of Zack Fair’s PSP adventure, christening it with the subtitle “Reunion,” giving newcomers the answer to the question of “who the heck was that black-haired fella in Remake?” As for me, I thought I had a good reason to return to the game. After playing a decent chunk of Reunion at Tokyo Game Show, I’m all good. 
My expectations were always reasonable. Reunion is a remaster, not a remake the scale of, well, Remake. That means that feature-wise, the best way to sum it up is “That PSP game? You can pl…</span>

                              <span>Let me fill you in on a little secret most people won&#x27;t tell you: the real way to enjoy a video game show is at home, comfortably on your couch, watching the event on YouTube. 
Over the years, the game press has done a remarkable job tricking you into thinking otherwise. The shows look extravagant, energetic, and almost like we&#x27;re getting glimpses into the future, which we then curate into bite-sized news stories and on-demand trailers for our faithful readers back home. 
The reality is much more depressing.
Whether it&#x27;s E3, PAX, Gamescom, or in this case, Tokyo Game Show, going to a video game trade event means dealing with the near-lethal combination of jetlag and overwork. The brutal FOMO of being in some of the coolest cities in the world but spending all your time in convention halls. The unbelievable cacophony of thousands of people talking at once. The unbelievable smells of thousands of people all standing too close to each other. The never-ending lines of thousands of people all needing to use the toilet at the same time. This doesn&#x27;t even touch on the unavoidable safety concerns of having a video game conference in the midst of an ongoing pandemic. But I digress.
All that said, there&#x27;s some fun stuff to look at, like big, gaudy statues and giant booths that likely cost tens of thousands of dollars for games you&#x27;ve never heard of and likely will never play. Stuff that really makes it all worth it. 
While we&#x27;d love to fly each and every one of you out to Tokyo, sadly, we only had the budget to fly out two of our full-time employees. So in lieu of attending yourself, please enjoy my curated batch of pictures of what I saw on the show floor. 
Well, there you have it, folks. All the fun of TGS without actually being there. See you next year!</span>

And speaking of Resident Evil 4 Remake, producer Yoshiaki Hirabayashi confirmed during Tokyo Game Show that the remake will also be coming to PlayStation 4, as reported by GameSpot. 
When Resident Evil 4 Remake was revealed during a PlayStation State of Play held back in June, Capcom said it was coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, with no mention of old-gen consoles like the PS4 and Xbox One. Now the company has confirmed that the game will be available on PS4 when it launches on March 24, 2023. There&#x27;s no word if Resident Evil 4 Remake will come to Xb…</span>

                              <span>Konami has revealed Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remaster Gate Rune and Dunan Unification Wars, a remaster of the first two classic Suikoden JRPGs, and the two will be released as a single package sometime next year on consoles and PC. 
More specifically, these two remasters will be packaged into the same collection and this remastered duo is due out on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC (via Steam) in 2023. The first Suikoden was released in 1995, and its sequel, Suikoden II, was released in 1998. Check out what the remastered versions of these classic games look like in the announcement trailer below: 


As you can see, these remasters are looking excellent, especially in the way that the original look and feel of the sprite imagery remains intact. Here&#x27;s hoping they feel as great to play as they did back in the day. 
Here are some highlights of this remastered collection from the game&#x27;s Steam page:

Integrating numbers from HowLongToBeat, most Game Pass games&#x27; pages now suggests how long a game is in several playstyles: finishing the main story; doing the main story and optional extras; and absolutely 100%ing everything. While I usually find talk of game length is tied into awful opinions that longer is better, I think this is great info to know on Game Pass.

                              <span>The Corsair iCUE 5000X is the Californian company&#x27;s best mid-size computer case, thanks to its clean tempered glass design, excellent cooling support and a range of features that make it easy to build in. The 5000X normally costs quite a bit - the RRP is £220 and even discounts drop it to £155+ - but today it&#x27;s down to £116.66 when you buy from Box via Amazon.
That could be a misprice, given the vast price discrepancy between the RRP and sale price. With only two units available you&#x27;ll have to move fast to pick this one up...

                              <span>This week on the Electronic Wireless Show podcast we, prompted by friendly listener OurSuperior, talk about the best changes of eras in games. As you can imagine, this is an easier task for Nate than it is to me, because many of his favourite games are predicated around era changes. Thus I find myself in the position of arguing semantics. How the turn tables have turned.
I&#x27;m able to win Nate around on at least one of my desperate bids to classify things that aren&#x27;t eras as eras, although he does promptly shut me down on the most ridiculous one. It may surprise you to know that we don&#x27;t actually talk about too many history games (although time travel comes up a lot). And stick around for a thrilling Cavern Of Lies. Will the Red Baron (me) be shot down at last?

That’s the message from dev Toby Fox, who’s posted an update on how Deltarune’s coming along. Fox’s message to those eagerly awaiting more from the game was published to mark the seventh anniversary of his indie RPG smash Undertale. It shares some new screens, GIFs, a video and even some tunes.

                              <span>Hand Of Fate was such a singular thing. On the one hand, it was a tabletop deckbuilding game that saw you picking through roguelike-style dungeons by choosing different cards dealt out by its mysterious Dealer. On the other, it was also an action-packed hack and slasher, bringing its fantastical fight sections to life in fully 3D combat arenas - and there hasn&#x27;t been anything quite like it since. Voice Of Cards certainly had a go, but its tedious battle system landed it straight on its own discard pile. Thankfully, we&#x27;ve now got the infinitely more engaging Foretales, a new narrative card game from French developers Alkemi, and it comes pretty damn close to capturing that Hand Of Fate goodness. 
It doesn&#x27;t ever venture into the realms of 3D admittedly, erring more toward the Inscryption school of tabletop combat encounters, but it does nail the delivery of telling an artful, swashbuckling adventure through cards and cards alone. And much like Hand Of Fate, this isn&#x27;t a one and done affair, either, as there are multiple paths to take through this entertaining fantasy yarn, and several game-changing decisions you&#x27;ll have to make as you try and avert a string of terrible visions threatening to destroy its anthropomorphic animal world. You won&#x27;t succeed at preventing them all during a single playthrough, but its hard choices only make its overarching story that much more gripping.

                              <span>Disney Dreamlight Valley is a glittering life simulator in which you — having somehow slipped out of the real world into a kind of Disney-sponsored coma — find yourself living alongside all of your favourite intellectual property. Your mission? Emotionally manipulate the awful dog-beast Goofy by gifting him dandelions and bream until he becomes your best friend, then set about working on Scrooge McDuck and the rest.
Before we dive too far into this thing: if you’re here because you’ve got a kid and you just want to know if Disney Dreamlight Valley will make them happy, and that the rat from Ratatouille doesn’t say the f-word, and that at no point does Ariel drag herself onto the beach to try to recruit them into a multi-level marketing scam, then you’re golden. Disney Dreamlight Valley is a top-marks Animal Crossing rip-off that will make fans of too-big mice irreversibly giddy. Your children may eventually need a special operation to stop them smiling.

                              <span>Epicly long action RPG Assassin’s Creed Odyssey is leaping onto Microsoft’s PC Game Pass subscription service today. The move was announced by surprise during this morning’s ID@Xbox stream at Tokyo Game Show, which I guess is appropriate for something to do with assassins. Odyssey’s predecessor Assassin’s Creed Origins was already plonked on to Microsoft’s subscription service in June this year.

September 29th is the date you’ll want to mark in your runic calendars, which I assume are constructed out of some variety of standing stone formation. The date was announced during last night’s ID@Xbox stream.

During today&#x27;s Call of Duty: Next livestream, Activision revealed a ton of new information surrounding the next phase of Call of Duty, which kicks off this fall. It begins on October 28 with Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II, the next mainline entry in the franchise, but perhaps culminates on November 16, when Call of Duty: Warzone 2.0 lanches free for everyone. Today brought us a look at what to expect when those experiences arrive later this year, as well as a glimpse at a mobile version of Warzone coming next year.

All of this Street Fighter 6 news came during Tokyo Games Show, which officially began today, and if you’re a fan of Capcom’s long-running fighting game series, strap in because there’s a lot.


Let’s start with the fighters. 
Joining the Street Fighter 6 roster of fighters is Ken Masters, the former US National Fighting Champion and ex-VP of the Masters Foundation, Blanka, a kindhearted defender of nature and adventure tour guide, Dhalsim, a monk and yoga master, and E. Honda, a global sumo wrestler phenomenon.

                              <span>Saturnalia is an upcoming survival horror game with an extremely unique art style announced last month. Now, we know when we can play it because Saturnalia has captured an October 27 release date. 
That&#x27;s when it will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC (via the Epic Games Store). Developed by Italy-based studio Santa Ragione, the team behind games like Fotonica, MirrorMoon EP, and Wheels of Aurelia, Saturnalia is shaping up to be a great time. You can find out why in the New Gameplay Today segment we recorded that&#x27;s all about Saturnalia, featuring more than 15 minutes of gameplay, below: 


&quot;[Saturnalia] is a kaleidoscopic adventure inspired in equal parts by authentic Sardinian folklore and classic Italian Giallo horror films,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;The story involves a mysterious, centuries-old ritual that occurs every year on the night of the winter solstice in the Italian village of Gravoi. Each of the game&#x27;s four playable characters must utilize their unique abilities and confront their own personal revelations in order to expose the secrets haunting the town and ultimately escape their doom.&quot;
Here are some additional Saturnalia highlights from Santa Ragione: 
Seek clues in a maze-like village with no markers or compass to guide your steps.
Explore the ever-changing town of Gravoi using matches to keep the dark at bay.
Flight and stealth are your only options, as you cannot fight the creature that hunts you.
Immerse yourself in the stop-motion animation and vibrant expressionist art style of Saturnalia for an eerily beautiful atmosphere that is as enthralling as it is chilling.
Control your fate through non-linear progression and a dynamic, adaptive narrative, with unique endgames dependent on player choices.


Saturnalia hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC via the Epic Games Store on October 27.

                              <span>Deathloop, the Arkane Studios-developed PlayStation 5-exclusive game released last year, is finally coming to Xbox next week. Plus, a new update for the game, which will be available on all platforms, includes an extended ending for Deathloop, Crossplay, and other additional features. 
More specifically, Deathloop will hit Xbox Series/X and PC on September 20, and if you’re a Game Pass member, it will be available there on day one. It will also launch onto PlayStation Plus that day, meaning all Extra and Premium members can also download it. The Goldenloop update will be live that day on all platforms and will add new enemies, weapons, abilities, and more to Deathloop.

                              <span>Kiriko is the newest support character arriving with the launch of Overwatch 2 PvP on October 4. She wields kunai, teleports through walls to allies, burst heals teammates with talismans, and can make nearby allies briefly invulnerable with her Protection Suzu move. Oh, and her ultimate summons a fox spirit who rushes ahead and buffs friendlies that follow behind. 
Kiriko will be free for all Overwatch 1 players, or you can earn her by reaching Tier 55 on the battle pass&#x27; free track. Of course, you will instantly unlock the character alongside newcomers Sojourn and Junker Queen by purchasing the premium battle pass. Not only is Kiriko the first support capable of keeping up with fast characters like Tracer and Genji, but the development team informed us her healing output should be similar to Moira and Mercy. 


Kiriko&#x27;s Abilities In Overwatch 2
Protection Suzu – Upon impact, allies in the area become briefly invulnerable and are cleansed of most negative effects.
Kunai – Thrown projectile that deals increased critical damage.
Swift Step – Teleport directly to an ally, even through walls.
Healing Ofuda – Channel a burst of healing talismans that can seek targeted allies.
Kitsune Rush – Summon a fox spirit that rushes forward, accelerating the movement, attack speed, and cooldowns of allies that follow its path.
Wall Climb – Jump at walls to climb up them. 
Season 1 of Overwatch 2 releases for free on October 4 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.</span>

                              <span>At Gamescom 2022, we spoke to James Worrall and Adam Olsson, Creative Director and Art Director on Dead Island 2, to learn more about the long-awaited sequel, how the team is balancing comedy and horror, and how exactly they plan to make zombies monstrous again with their procedural FLESH system. Set within the once-bustling city of Los Angeles, the game pulls inspiration from 80s action movies like Die Hard and George A. Romero&#x27;s Dawn Of The Dead and features iconic locations overrun with hordes of zombies you can eviscerate piece by piece.

It feature more Sonic Frontiers gameplay, which consists of the blue blur climbing colossal machines as if they&#x27;re mountains, but when he reaches the top of one, he stumbles upon something very special: a Chaos Emerald. As any Sonic fan likely knows, collecting all of these will help the hedgehog transform into Super Sonic, a Saiyan-like version of the character that&#x27;s faster and stronger. And sure enough, that&#x27;s exactly what happens in this new TGS Sonic Frontiers trailer. 
Check it out for yourself below: 


As you can see, this is the first appearance of Super Sonic in Sonic Frontiers&#x27; marketing thus far. It&#x27;s also the first confirmation that Super Sonic is in the game. This trailer is another exciting Sonic Frontiers trailer showcasing more of what we can expect when the game hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on November 8.

                              <span>Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio has announced that its Yakuza-adjacent Judgment series will make its way to Steam for the first time. The best news: they&#x27;re out on Steam today.
Judgment and Lost Judgment come to Steam on September 14. This marks the first appearance of each game on PC (though Judgment has been available to stream on PC via Stadia). 
This news is especially significant given that RGG Studio originally planned to release Lost Judgment on PC when it launched last year. However, that version was nixed when the talent agency representing actor Takuya Kimura, who portrays protagonist Takayuki Yagami, enforced strict policies about allowing Kimura’s likeness on PC. Both parties&#x27; inability to agree threatened Judgment’s future as a franchise since RGG Studio has pushed for more of its titles to come to Steam; every mainline Yakuza game is available on the storefront, for example. It would appear those issues have been ironed out, which bodes well for the potential of a third game. 
The Judgment games are noir action thrillers that adhere to the same open-world design template as the Yakuza series. Though the plots largely unfold in Kamurocho, the series stars a new cast of characters and emphasizes investigative gameplay. Players control Yagami, a disgraced lawyer and private detective who works to unravel a pair of conspiracy plots. In Yakuza fashion, he also has his hands full helping his colorful clients and random citizens solve more light-hearted – or comically absurd – problems.

                              <span>Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio, the team behind the popular and long-running Yakuza franchise, revealed yesterday that it&#x27;s remaking Like A Dragon: Ishin and releasing it for the first time in the West next year. That reveal trailer looked great, but it was short and sweet. 
Now, RGG has released a new &quot;Ambush&quot; trailer that showcases more than five minutes of Like A Dragon: Ishin, giving us a better look at this upcoming Yakuza spinoff. Like A Dragon: Ishin was first released on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 3 in 2014, but it never came out in the West. This new release rebuilds Like A Dragon: Ishin from the ground up, and you can check out how great it&#x27;s looking in the trailer below: 


Like A Dragon: Ishin takes place in the Late Edo Period of Japan, in the 1860s. After completing his special sword training, Sakamoto Ryoma returns to his home in Tosa, only to find conflict against a prestigious samurai. You can read more about it in our story here.
Like A Dragon: Ishin hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on February 21.</span>

                              <span>Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio announced that Yakuza 8 is called Like A Dragon 8 today, and that game&#x27;s announcement trailer revealed that former series protagonist Kazuma Kiryu is back alongside Yakuza: Like A Dragon protagonist Ichiban Kasuga. Now, RGG has announced Like A Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name, a new Yakuza game that will follow Kiryu&#x27;s life following the events of Yakuza 6: The Song of Life leading up to Like A Dragon 8. 
In the reveal trailer, which aired today during the RGG Summit 2022 showcase, we see Kiryu at a monastery. Having left behind his former Yakuza life, as well as his name, Kiryu, who now goes by Joryu, is trying to live the life of a monk. However, he&#x27;s seemingly pulled into one more job – an escort mission – and if today&#x27;s Like A Dragon 8 trailer is any indication, it seems this final job pulls him back into the life he had put behind him. 
Check it out for yourself in the reveal trailer below:


As you can see, The Man Who Erased His Name is shaping up to be a treat for longtime Yakuza fans and it seems like necessary playing in the leadup to 2024&#x27;s Like A Dragon 8. Like A Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC in 2023.

When I played the original version of Resident Evil Village on PlayStation 5, I didn’t pay too much attention to the environmental details, like this painting. In this playthrough, I am frequently distracted by them. Even though this version is essentially the same game, it takes on new life through PSVR2’s stunning display.
The headset’s OLED display delivers a wide 110-degree field of view capable of presenting games in vivid 4K HDR. Unlike most VR headsets on the market, I’m not seeing any general pixelization, artifacting, or graininess in the text – everything looks sharp.

                              <span>The eighth mainline installment in the popular and long-running Yakuza franchise has been revealed and it&#x27;s called Like A Dragon 8. 
Set up as a direct sequel to 2020&#x27;s Yakuza: Like A Dragon, which starred a new protagonist, Ichiban Kasuga, and turn-based RPG mechanics rather than brawler combat, it was a hit amongst fans. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s no surprise Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio is following it up with another Like A Dragon game. Check out the Like A Dragon 8 reveal trailer for yourself below:


As you can see, the former protagonist of Yakuza, Kazuma Kiryu, is back. He was the protagonist in the first six Yakuza games, and now he&#x27;s back in Like A Dragon 8. Ichiban tells Kiryu it&#x27;s Hero time – remember, he&#x27;s a big fan of the Dragon Quest series which stars plenty of heroes – before the trailer cuts to both of their faces, revealing that some time has passed, with both characters looking at least a little older than when we last saw them. 
Like A Dragon 8 is due out PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC sometime in 2024. 
In the meantime, read about Like A Dragon: Ishin, a Yakuza spinoff first released on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 3 in 2014 finally making its way to the West, rebuilt from the ground up, next year.</span>

                              <span>Today brought a doubleheader of platform-holder livestreams. Our day kicked off with a Nintendo Direct, which brought us more than 40 minutes of headlines, gameplay trailers, announcements, and even name reveals. We finished off the day with a PlayStation State of Play, giving us trailers and information for the PlayStation family of consoles, including PlayStation VR2.
Now that the dust has settled a little bit, we want to know what caught your eye. Was it something from Nintendo&#x27;s digital event? Perhaps the name and release date reveal of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom? Was the impressive list of Nintendo 64 games coming to Switch Online&#x27;s Expansion Pack? Maybe you&#x27;re super hyped for Fire Emblem Engage?
Or was it something from the PlayStation State of Play event? Tekken 8 was an expected but exciting reveal, while games like Rise of the Ronin and Like a Dragon: Ishin look like an absolute blast. Of course, we can&#x27;t talk about the State of Play stream without mentioning that God of War: Ragnarök footage.
Let us know in the comments below what you&#x27;re most hyped about coming out of today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct and PlayStation State of Play. If you happened to miss any of the announcements, you can check out our news hub for all our coverage from today.</span>

                              <span>Sony revealed a brand new story trailer for God Of War Ragnarök during today’s State Of Play stream. The video showcased otherworldly imagery, including astral jellyfish, giant dinosaur-like creatures, and notably, a pivotal scene wherein Atreus appears to usher in Fimbulwinter, the end of the world, alongside Sköll and Hati – two wolves that are the offspring of Fenrir. According to Norse mythology, Sköll and Hati are two wolves who exist to one day spark the beginning of Ragnarök by chasing and devouring the sun and the moon. It’s pretty clear that’s what is happening in this new trailer, but why is Atreus helping them?
Additionally, it seems Atreus is hiding critical information from his father, Kratos, so why is Kratos following orders from his teenage son? Why is Freya holding a sword up to Atreus’ throat in the trailer? Is she holding Atreus hostage or trying to show Kratos the same pain she suffered after her son Baldur was killed in the first game? The trailer creates more questions than answers, precisely what I want from pre-launch marketing. 


We’ll have to wait to find the answers to these questions when God Of War Ragnarök releases on November 8. In the meantime, let me know your story theories in the comments below!</span>

                              <span>Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio, the team behind the beloved Yakuza franchise, has announced Like a Dragon: Ishin. This spin-off entry was first released on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 3 in 2014 but never came to the West. Now titled Like A Dragon: Ishin, the game has been rebuilt from the ground up, and it&#x27;s coming to Western markets next year.


The game takes place in the Late Edo Period, in the 1860s. After finishing his sword training, Sakamoto Ryoma returns home to Tosa, only to get into a fight with a prestigious and highly ranked samurai. Now, players can change the course of Japan&#x27;s history in this Yakuza spin-off game.
Like a Dragon: Ishin is set to launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC in February 2023.</span>

                              <span>PlayStation and Team Ninja have announced Rise of the Ronin, a new action game coming exclusively to PlayStation 5 sometime in 2024. 
It was revealed during today&#x27;s PlayStation State of Play, and if you&#x27;re at all familiar with Team Ninja&#x27;s other games, you&#x27;re probably going to be into this one. It&#x27;s not quite clear if it&#x27;s taking up the Soulslike mantle that other Team Ninja games have (looking at you, Nioh), but there were a few gameplay sequences that showed some combat similar to From Software&#x27;s hit series. 
Check it out for yourself in the reveal trailer below: 


As you can see, Rise of the Ronin looks quite interesting. The combat looks fast, brutal, and explosive, and the characters look fun. The world looks especially unique, too, with some of the game seemingly taking place in more rural areas of Japan and others taking place in more dense villages and towns.

Unfortunately, it might be a while before we learn more because Rise of the Ronin won&#x27;t hit PlayStation 5 until 2024.

More information on the future of The Sims will be coming on October 18th too, EA said, at an event dubbed the Behind The Sims Summit.

                              <span>Grim futuristic worlds do love their giant robots, and newly revealed third-person mech battler Synduality is no exception to that. The game’s part of a “transmedia sci-fi franchise” being worked on by very bluntly named devs Game Studio, according to publishers Bandai Namco. The game’s out in 2023, though. Suit up and boot up by watching the trailer below.

                              <span>At risk of turning RPS into a Ryu Ga Gotoku fansite today, I must inform you that the rumoured release of the Judgment series on PC has happened. Available now on PC through Steam, The Judgment Collection includes Judgment, its sequel Lost Judgment, and The Kaito Files story expansion all into one handy bundle. That sure is a whole lot of judgment. Watch the trailer below for more than your daily recommended dose of kick-punching action.

As much as I admire delicious dishes, I am very glad that something that&#x27;s wholly unintentional (and often unwanted by developers) is still in the running. Games are weird and daft magic tracks, and that&#x27;s great. This week, you must choose between oddity and serendipity. What&#x27;s better: impossible geometry, or games playing the music CD left in your drive?

I’ve already reported on Like A Dragon 8, which stars Kiryu and new series main character Ichiban Kasuga, but devs Ryu Go Gotoku Studio also revealed that another game is coming in 2023. It&#x27;ll explain what happened to Kiryu in his temporary absence from the series and is called, and I’m not making this up, Like A Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name. To prove it to you, you can watch the trailer below.

It shows off the weird, wonderful and complex ways you can look for love in all the wrong places in Fallen London. Although, as you can see in the trailer, you can also look for friendship, attraction, romance, or a combination of the latter two. Plus: mystery! Who isn&#x27;t intrigued by a romance game where someone utters the immortal phrase, &quot;There&#x27;s been a murder&quot;?

                              <span>During this evening&#x27;s State Of Play livestream, Team Ninja announced their next game. Rise Of The Ronin is an open world game set in Japan in the wake of country opening its borders to the West, with the trailer showing hang gliding, horse riding, rooftop stealth, and combat involving both swords and guns.

It&#x27;s also referred to as a &quot;console exclusive&quot; for PlayStation, which means it&#x27;ll probably come to PC.

                              <span>Bandai Namco has revealed Tekken 8, a new sequel in the popular and long-running fighting game franchise. 
Tekken 8 was revealed in a new cinematic trailer that aired during today&#x27;s PlayStation State of Play. It began with a few shots to set up the scenery before cutting to two series mainstays, Kazuya and Kazuya&#x27;s son, Jin. The two duke it out in what appears to be a fair fight, that is until Kazuya calls forth the power of the devil gene inside him to finish the fight. 
Check it out for yourself in the reveal trailer below:


Unfortunately, this trailer doesn&#x27;t reveal much else. Tekken 8 looks very much like Tekken, which is great. The trailer also doesn&#x27;t reveal a release date – it just says to stay tuned for more information.

                              <span>As one of the most influential and beloved shooters of all time, GoldenEye 007 is a special game for many who played it in the late &#x27;90s. However, it&#x27;s been a long time since the game has been playable on modern consoles. That changes soon, as the revolutionary first-person shooter received a duo of announcements today. First, we learned about a Switch version as part of the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack N64 catalog. However, we also learned the title (which was developed by now-Microsoft-owned Rare), is also coming to Xbox as a part of Game Pass and Rare Replay.
When the game arrives on Xbox, it will include the classic campaign, complete with the original difficulty settings and cheat codes (no word on if &quot;DK Mode&quot; will be renamed to something more generic like &quot;Big Head Mode&quot; for the Xbox version). The Xbox version will also include the split-screen local competitive multiplayer mode that made the game such a mainstay for get-togethers in the N64 era.


Unfortunately, it does not appear as though the online multiplayer available in the Nintendo Switch Online version will make the jump to the Xbox version. However, the Xbox version of GoldenEye 007 does include improved control options (including dual analog stick support), native 16:9 resolution up to 4K Ultra HD, a consistent refresh rate, and full achievement support. 
GoldenEye 007 is coming to Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One as part of Game Pass. Everyone who already owns Rare Replay will also be able to download the game at no additional cost. We don&#x27;t know exactly when GoldenEye 007 arrives on Xbox, but according to Rare, the game will land simultaneously on Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch Online.</span>

For nearly 30 years, I looked forward to each workday, eager to see what game news would break, what I would be writing about, and on the best days, what I would be playing. In the time it took to create 330 monthly magazines, I was privileged to work alongside some of the most talented and amazing people I&#x27;ve ever met. For a kid who couldn’t get enough of video games growing up, I was living a dream. I knew how lucky I was and never took it for granted. I worked hard. I wanted Game Informer to be the place to go to celebrate games. I think we accomplished that tenfold and have created an outlet unlike any other.
In the weeks ahead, I’ll transition from writing game news to creating it. I’m entering the world of game dev…</span>

                              <span>We&#x27;re rapidly approaching the midway point for Mario Kart 8 Deluxe&#x27;s Booster Course Pass content. With two of the six promised waves of new courses already out, Nintendo has begun teasing what players can expect with the third wave, which is due out this holiday season. During today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct, we learned the first two courses coming in the third eight-course wave of new tracks.
Fittingly, the first course we learned about for Wave 3 of the Booster Course Pass is Merry Mountain. This holiday-themed track first made its debut in Mario Kart Tour in 2020 as part of the Winter Tour. Meanwhile, for those looking for something not holiday-themed, Nintendo is also bringing Peach Gardens, a track that first appeared in Mario Kart DS in 2005.
Wave 1 brought fan favorites like Coconut Mall (Wii), Choco Mountain (N64), and Sky Garden (GBA), while Wave 2 gave us access to tracks like Kalimari Desert (N64), Mario Circuit 3 (SNES), and Mushroom Gorge (Wii). Each wave has also given us two tracks from Mario Kart Tour, with Wave 2 also including an all-new course in Sky-High Sundae. 
Mario Kart 8 Deluxe – Booster Course Pass Wave 3 is scheduled to arrive this holiday season.</span>

                              <span>In the lead-up to Nintendo Switch Sports, Nintendo promised two major free updates following the launch. The first free update, which came out earlier this summer, added the ability to use the leg strap accessory for entire soccer matches instead of just shootouts. The second, more anticipated free update is set to add a new playable sport to the package: golf. Originally set for release this fall, Nintendo today announced a small delay to the update, saying it now arrives this holiday season.
The Nintendo Switch Sports version of golf lets you tee up across 21 holes carried over from the Wii Sports series. You can play locally with other players or hit the links with up to eight players online in the new Survival Golf mode. In Survival Golf, whoever takes the most strokes each round is eliminated.
This free update to Nintendo Switch Sports arrives this holiday season. For more about Nintendo Switch Sports, you can check out our full review here.</span>

                              <span>Ever since its summer 2019 announcement, fans have been dying to know the official name of the sequel to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. During today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct presentation, we not only learned that but also, finally, a release date. We now know the game&#x27;s name is The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.


In The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, players can explore the surface of the version of Hyrule they traveled across in Breath of the Wild as well as various floating islands in the sky. In the new trailer, we see Link go from the sky to the surface, then from the surface to the sky.
There&#x27;s still so much we don&#x27;t know about Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, but in addition to the official name, we also now have a release date. The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingom arrives exclusively on Nintendo Switch on May 12, 2023.</span>

                              <span>Dauntless developer Phoneix Labs has announced a new title that, needless to say, is dramatically different than its monster-slaying RPG. Fae Farm is a cozy life simulation that whisks players to a world of magic and wonder where you&#x27;ll flex your green thumb as a farming savior. 


As the name suggests, the bulk of the experience involves running a farm as an adventurer and newcomer to a community in the land of Azoria. Though you’ll work to bring peace to this troubled land, you’ll also kick back and leisurely explore various environments, collect resources, and build homesteads. Fae Farm is built with cooperation in mind. The title features drop-in/drop-out co-op, both locally and online, allowing players to farm and quest together. 
“With Fae Farm we wanted to take our favorite elements of the sim genres we love, infuse them with magic and beautiful art, and wrap everything in a light-hearted cooperative experience,” said creative director Katie De Sousa in a press release. “I can’t wait to see what kind of cozy homesteads players build in Azoria.”
Fae Farm is slated to release during Q2 2023 exclusively for Switch.</span>

                              <span>Today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct was loaded with surprises, including an enhanced port of the 2011 Wii game, Kirby&#x27;s Return to Dream Land. On this colorful adventure, Kirby uses a variety of copy abilities to solve puzzles and platforming challenges. These abilities, like a sword and whip, can also be used for combat encounters. This updated version of the game also includes a new Mecha ability, which adds long-range rockets, a close-range dash, and a mighty blast to the arsenal.
Up to four people can play cooperatively using Joy-Cons on the same system. Multiplayer is also available in the expanded minigame collection, giving players a new challenge called Magolor&#x27;s Tome Trackers.
Kirby&#x27;s Return to Dream Land Deluxe launches exclusively on Switch on February 24, 2023. Preorders begin today.</span>

                              <span>Capcom is bringing its best horror games to Nintendo Switch later this year via the handheld&#x27;s cloud gaming capabilities. Resident Evil Village, Resident Evil 7: Biohazard and the recent remakes of Resident Evil 2 and 3 will all be available on the eShop before the end of 2022. While we don&#x27;t know every game&#x27;s exact release date, Capcom announced that Resident Evil Village Cloud is launching on October 28. Additionally, a free demo of Village will be available later today on the Switch eShop if you&#x27;d like to test the quality of the cloud version yourself. 
This release coincides with the global launch of the Resident Evil Village Winter&#x27;s Expansion, which introduces new story content surrounding the protagonist&#x27;s daughter, which is also arriving on October 28.

                              <span>I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m writing this: Pikmin 4 is real, and it&#x27;s out next year. 
Let&#x27;s get right to it – check out the official Pikmin 4 announcement trailer below: 


Here&#x27;s what Nintendo had to say about Pikmin 4 in a press release following today&#x27;s reveal: 
 
Pikmin franchise revealed a tranquil park and a napping Bulborb, but it was still missing one important element … Pikmin! Where could they be? More details about this new title for Nintendo Switch will be revealed ahead of its 2023 launch.&quot;

 
Pikmin is a very special franchise to many people, but despite its niche popularity, it&#x27;s never quite reached the heights of other Nintendo franchises. In total, the franchise has sold more than 8 million copies. Pikmin 3 Deluxe on Switch proved the franchise still had some (fruit) juice in it by selling roughly 2 million units in less than a year – a quarter of the series&#x27; entire sales – and fans speculated this had proved to Nintendo that it was time for a proper sequel. 
Pikmin 4 was mentioned by series creator Shigeru Miyamoto back in 2015 when he told Eurogamer that it was in development and &quot;very close to completion.&quot; Time passed and then Hey! Pikmin, a 2D Pikmin spinoff, was announced and then released in July of 2017. Some speculated that this was the Pikmin 4 Miyamoto was referring to back in 2015 but in June of that year, Miyamoto told Eurogamer that &quot;it is progressing,&quot; seemingly confirming that he did not view Hey! Pikmin as the fourth sequel. Unfortunately, that was the last Nintendo or anyone there referred to Pikmin 4...until today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct!

Nintendo showcased a short and sweet teaser trailer that gave us more of the luscious world of Pikmin before flashing to a title screen that revealed Pikmin 4 is coming to Switch next year. As for exactly when, that remains unknown  – Nintendo simply stated 2023. But hey, that&#x27;s better than wondering when, if ever, Pikmin 4 would actually come out!

                              <span>Square Enix has announced Theatrhythm Final Bar Line, the next entry in the Final Fantasy rhythm series. This first console entry in the series includes modernized visuals for the backgrounds and nearly 400 songs included in the base game.
The soundtrack includes favorites like &quot;One Winged Angel,&quot; &quot;Torn from the Heavens,&quot; &quot;Suteki Da Ne,&quot; and plenty more. With 385 songs included in the base game, Square Enix understands it might be difficult to sort through them all, so it included a way to sort by game. The game can be enjoyed by two players locally or four players online.


Theatrhythm Final Bar Line comes to PlayStation 4 and Switch on February 16. Square Enix also announced that players can look forward to paid DLC from the Saga, Nier, Octopath Traveler, and Live A Live series for a total of 90 additional songs. There&#x27;s also a Season Pass which will add 27 extra songs.</span>

                              <span>Nintendo today announced GoldenEye 007 is coming to Switch via Switch&#x27;s Online Expansion Pack membership. No gameplay footage was shown during today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct, but Nintendo said the game will feature online play.
GoldenEye won&#x27;t be alone when it arrives on Switch. Nintendo also announced players can download Pilotwings 64, and Mario Party 1 and 2 at some point in 2022. In the following year, Mario Party 3, Pokémon Stadium 1 and 2, 1080 Snowboarding, and Excitebike 64 will release on Switch.

                              <span>Nintendo has revealed when we can expect to take part in the first post-launch Splatoon 3 Splatfest, and we don&#x27;t have to wait too long. That&#x27;s because it&#x27;s happening later this month!
More specifically, the first post-launch Splatfest will begin at 5 p.m. PT/8 p.m. ET, on Sept. 23 and end at 5 p.m. PT/8 p.m. ET on Sept. 25. As for what we&#x27;ll be fighting for, you can choose to be on team Gear, Grub, of Fun (in regards to what you&#x27;d bring with you to a deserted island). It should be a great time if the pre-launch Splatfest held recently is any indication.
Check out the Splatfest trailer for yourself below: 


The trailer above also reveals that some additional Splatoon 3 updates are on the way, too, although it stopped short of telling us exactly what to expect.

                              <span>Adventure platformer Little Orpheus was meant to launch on PC back in March but was delayed at the last minute. At the time, the announcement said the decision to delay was taken &quot;in light of recent events&quot;, referencing without directly naming the Russian invasion of Ukraine. 

Well, as of today, Little Orpheus, which is a scifi adventure about a Soviet cosmonaut in 1962, has been released.

                              <span>One of the best developments in PC gaming over the past five years has been the arrival of the entire, silly, joyous Yakuza series on our platform. Well, now it looks like Yakuza&#x27;s detective agency spin-offs are also heading to PC, as 2018&#x27;s Judgment and 2021&#x27;s Lost Judgment have both received an ESRB rating for &quot;Windows PC&quot;.

                              <span>The XIII remake, when it was released in 2020, was a disaster. Players complained of poor AI, bugs, missing multiplayer and an art style that abandoned the iconic, cel-shaded look of the original. After almost two years of further work by a different developer, the remake of the XIII remake is now live.

                              <span>I only just realised, while mentioning the dev&#x27;s next game, that we never posted about excellent indie horror game Mothered. Not to be confused with the unrelated Remothered games, it&#x27;s the tale of a young girl returning home after surgery to find everything is weird and her mother is some sort of eerie mannequin. It might be my favourite horror game of 2021? Now&#x27;s a good time to raise Mothered because: 1) it finally has a demo for newcomers; 2) for veterans, that demo actually hides a secret expansion continuing the game&#x27;s story.
